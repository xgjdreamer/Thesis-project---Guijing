S0517	oh as oppose to the lpt ones
S0571	yeah
S0517	mm yeah
S0570	he say he's still really angry
S0517	about what
S0570	well he's like i'm the second highest qualify coach now and on the lowest pay
S0517	have he still not have a rise
S0570	he say he's gonna ask once he's sixteen
S0517	he be sixteen
S0570	well i dunno yet
S0517	he be sixteen in march
S0570	maybe he have have a rise i'll ask him tomorrow we always talk about it
S0517	mm
S0571	have you tell him you've have a rise then
S0570	yeah i tell him i have a rise yeah
S0517	do he wish he'd do the coach course
S0570	he do that's his point
S0517	no no no sorry not the coach course
S0571	the the referee
S0517	the er tournament organiser course
S0570	i dunno cos it doesn't two of us to run it
S0517	mm
S0571	he doesn't seem to enjoy coach anyway though do he
S0517	no he doesn't
S0571	be he a good coach when he do coach
S0570	yeah well he he know enough doesn't he because he just relay information that he's be tell over the years doesn't he
S0517	he's have a lot of information give to him
S0570	quite he's bright isn't he so
S0517	yeah
S0571	do he do more technical coach than you do do you think
S0570	it's hard to do technical coach in a group session
S0517	be that why they don't do it
S0570	yeah cos you can't really
S0517	well why not why can't they like line everyone up and and make them serve and tell them what they're do wrong
S0570	cos when you're line up wait for your someone to serve one by one and there's nine of you in the group you have to wait at least nine minutes
S0517	i know but well that's what annoy me about
S0570	that's why they do that's why it's tactical
S0517	the academy it's not
S0570	well they can't they physically can't really do it unless unless you put them all just into match and you go round one by one and pick something out
S0571	see what i don't understand though be that you you you can do drill in group can't you
S0570	yeah
S0571	yeah so why can't one person be do some drill and just the other person take people aside for ten minutes just to say look
S0571	this isn't quite right i'd really like you to work on this this and this
S0570	what so
S0517	yeah i i yeah
S0570	no cos you don't do drill for long enough drill last five ten minutes
S0571	alright well it
S0517	oh it's just when you're do hit at the end why not take one person aside and say okay
S0570	cos you don't have time to do everything
S0517	and and that's that's what
S0571	but you you could do half if if you've get the same but you've get if you've get people in a course for i dunno six weeks or eight weeks term yeah
S0570	yeah
S0571	well in that term if you've get twelve
S0517	i've have load of wine
S0571	if you've
S0517	i'm gonna not i'm gonna have a headache tomorrow
S0571	if you've get twelve people in the group why can't they just identify two people each lesson and say right in this lesson we're gonna focus on these two and the rest we're just gonna continue do generic stuff with but they'll have other stuff that they've be think about
S0570	well i think the big difference be which be what me and don't get be always say when people go to do their serve and stuff they've all be tell specifics of because the academy's not just a squad be it you've get a fitness part of it you've get your tactical part which be the squad
S0517	mm
S0570	and you've get your technical part which be the lesson
S0517	oh
S0570	so he
S0517	so you're not get and
S0570	yeah
S0517	be get one out of the three
S0570	so ninety per cent of them have be tell technical stuff to work on
S0517	okay
S0570	already which be why it doesn't happen
S0517	so out of the
S0570	so
S0517	people in the academy how many be do all three
S0570	well most of them be do all three and if they're not do all three they're average at least one a month of a private lesson
S0517	so it's only you two for instance isn't do anything he's not do the fitness or the private lessons
S0570	so he's just do the tactical
S0517	oh okay
S0571	but i i i think that tactical be a load of rubbish i really do
S0517	yeah i think you'd you you'd benefit from the technical private lesson
S0571	because
S0517	over the tactical
S0571	the
S0570	i've say that all along but i dunno why you're tell me
S0517	i know well we i know i know
S0571	doesn't make any difference tell me
S0517	we didn't manage to get out of it do we but
S0571	but even when you speak to him we we leave it down to you to tell him and he you have a chat with him and he he talk you round didn't he
S0517	who
S0570	what the squad
S0571	yeah
S0570	that's because i i
S0517	he talk us round
S0570	in
S0517	so you can't have a go at him
S0570	in the squad i
S0517	he talk us round
S0570	in the after say he quit the only person i hit with in that squad be with
S0517	quit be the past tense
S0570	so
S0517	of quit
S0570	there be no reason not to so
S0517	quit
S0570	and then
S0517	get it
S0570	everyone drop out so it end up be a lesson anyway so it be a win win for us and
S0571	oh so it have be good for you
S0570	well i then i'm do the five lessons anyway
S0517	this have on the tuesday now when i say to he can't do this because of his exams and his revision and his
S0570	everyone's drop out apart from him
S0517	everyone's drop out which be why he say
S0570	i be the only one
S0517	okay i'll transfer the money over to and you can have four private lessons instead
S0571	right
S0517	but what i'm think be it's within our it's only do the one a week because he can't do the wednesday anyway it's within our interest to say oh gosh that's a real pain this have change that's change can't do anything we'll just put him down for a private lesson once a fortnight
S0571	okay
S0517	forty pound a month and just see if he improve cos he do need i mean he's the best at his age group there but he's hang on by a thread now isn't he
S0571	yeah he be but he's get it mentally
S0517	he's get it mentally
S0570	he's only the best there
S0517	he want to win
S0570	cos he's the fittest
S0517	he's fittest he's get it mentally
S0571	but they all say
S0517	but
S0571	be the one that will
S0517	he's
S0571	find a way to win
S0517	and he's the one that they all want to beat
S0571	so that must be that must be tactical
S0517	he's the one they want to beat be the one they want to beat at that age group
S0571	yeah
S0517	they've all say that haven't they i mean even 's dad say oh he'll be make up he's get a set off they all want to beat but he be hang on by a thread two of those he win on third set tie break he be hang on

S0517	he know that
S0572	you know you know i lose i be lose to him today
S0517	who
S0517	when
S0572	when i play him today
S0517	the squad
S0572	yeah play play play
S0517	yeah but when it matter you can always manage
S0571	what be the score today
S0572	three two er it be on the serve i be serve it be
S0517	when it matter you just you compose yourself you gather your thoughts and you pull it out the bag doesn't he
S0570	can i have one of these cookies
S0571	i think with a bite of technical help
S0517	mm
S0571	you've get all the physical ability to do it
S0571	you just need a bite more technical help that's all
S0572	yeah
S0517	which be why we're gonna
S0571	cos i think if erm if they give you a bite more work on your serve your serve'll be
S0572	yeah
S0571	a real weapon
S0572	yeah i need serve as well but
S0571	yeah you do yeah you do and then cos and then you just need to get that forehand right because it be er a it will be huge but at the moment you're just finish in the wrong place your backhand's come on fantastically
S0572	yeah i think er all i need to do cos we do you know how we're do one person could attack one person could defend and then if it be me against i think i just need to defend more like hit the ball just so it's you know
S0571	well not with i think you need to be aggressive with
S0572	i be win more point though be defensive
S0571	well
S0572	just make sure he doesn't come inside the
S0571	oh okay okay
S0570	now do you wanna listen to
S0571	the other thing
S0517	so
S0571	you didn't do you didn't put a single lob up against him when you play in the match not a single lob you er you try to pass him and he he and he anticipate every pass shoot and make the volley but he's short he's get no legs
S0571	he's quite quick so he can get back
S0517	you can't say that
S0571	but if you if you hit it hit hit it over the top of him and then hit one short to get him to come back and move him backwards and forward he'll move side to side all day but backwards and forward be er you you remember the the the shoot that you find the most difficult be that short ball
S0572	yeah
S0571	that you wanna attack and put away and often it hit the top of the net doesn't it
S0572	yeah
S0571	where it go fly out
