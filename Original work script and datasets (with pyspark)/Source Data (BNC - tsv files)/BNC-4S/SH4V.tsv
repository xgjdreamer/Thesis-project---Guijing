S0278	yeah i know they do
S0013	they sit in the car do they
S0278	well they must have be
S0370	well i don't know they might have just stop you see or they might have be just move off again
S0278	mm
S0370	but er it's not a good idea to stop on the motorway
S0278	oh it's not it's it's horrendous i would try and avoid that at all cost
S0370	so how do they know he fell asleep so he's alive
S0278	oh i don't know he he he he's alive but i if you've get a bus full of girl cheerleaders how can he fall asleep when they're on their way to go cheerlead
S0013	he's yeah but how do they know he fell asleep
S0278	they would have be noise
S0370	or be they on their way back
S0278	the noise no they be on their way to cheerlead
S0370	well maybe do another job before you see
S0278	well i don't know
S0370	if he be over on his drive hours they would arrest him
S0278	oh he might have be
S0370	because that's illegal
S0278	yeah
S0370	and if he be drive believe it or not i mean when you go one the motorway all the bus all the you know the city to city bus they're all do seventy aren't they they're all break the law
S0012	yes they do yeah
S0013	they be
S0370	cos they're not allow above fifty six
S0013	why do they do that
S0370	it's fifty six on a motorway for a lorry or a bus
S0013	yeah
S0012	but the point be
S0370	or a people carrier not a people carrier
S0013	yeah no
S0370	erm a transit erm
S0012	yeah mini bus
S0370	mini bus
S0278	the psp
S0370	but they all go they all go above fifty six but because the cameras be not set up to catch that speed
S0013	oh i see
S0370	it's only the car drivers who get do
S0012	trackometers they've get a trackometer in there the little
S0278	tako
S0012	tako
S0370	yeah yeah
S0012	which
S0278	they don't show them
S0012	so when they get back to base
S0278	mm yeah
S0370	they all go they all go at seventy though
S0012	yeah
S0370	don't they
S0278	yeah they do go fast yeah
S0013	yeah we've often well we
S0278	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0370	and yeah i think i'm right in say it's fifty six
S0278	i have sixty in my head but it doesn't matter it's near they're near enough i know they don't it's not suppose to be
S0013	have a
S0012	they're talk about go at eighty now
S0370	but they've normally get erm
S0278	well they have a sticker on the back say so they might as well
S0012	go on put it in
S0278	they have a sticker on the back that say what their maximum speed be don't they
S0370	no not now no
S0278	oh really continental ones do
S0370	oh maybe yeah no i think eighty would be probably quite reasonable for cars on the motorway now with modern cars they're design to go at that speed
S0278	they've still only get four bits in contact with the road
S0370	yeah i know but the the the bits in contact compare to a
S0278	be it better
S0370	what cars use to be like at seventy
S0012	they have it on top gear the other day they have
S0370	yeah
S0012	a a new car you know a fairly new car
S0370	yeah
S0278	mm
S0012	and they'd they'd put the a barrier up the end of this er runway
S0370	mm
S0012	and they have a fairly new car say say two year old car and they have a car ten years old and they go at eighty miles an hour
S0370	mm mm into the barrier
S0012	and the car the new car stop about thirty they have a white one where they be suppose to put the break on
S0370	yeah
S0012	and they the new car stop about five six meter away from it the old car the older car
S0370	slam into it
S0012	slam straight through it
S0370	yeah yeah yeah
S0278	well with abs i mean if you think think about it break be totally different now thank dear

S0370	you know you you put your foot on the break on the old days for your drum break

S0278	half way come round the wash on one one journey back from and erm my windscreen wipers have a fight on the on this one they start bang each other like this one open what have happen they

S0278	no
S0370	no
S0278	and and i pop every i pop it back a couple of time and then it come out again and i end up drive back i be sit across the mid break so i could see out the one side and just leave it disconnect yeah
S0370	yeah

S0370	well once you're commit to drive that's it you get to get with it haven't you
S0278	yeah and i think i be run short of fuel as well at that stage and there's nowhere to refuel there's nothing
S0012	that's worry that be
S0278	yeah
S0370	well apparently on my car you can drive from london to to scotland without fill up
S0012	that's great
S0013	yeah
S0012	on ours that'll tell you how much fuel how how far you can you and what fuel you've get leave
S0013	mm
S0370	so do mine
S0012	and when it's on the red you think ooh i've get to get some fuel and you look you look to see erm how far you can go and it say two hundred and sixty miles or something stupid like that
S0370	really
S0012	yeah
S0013	really
S0012	when it's on the red
S0013	get to check that out
S0278	i think this this one do will do about ninety won't it i think when it start on the red you've get about ninety to go on it or something funny you've get a lot or nineteen maybe it be
S0370	no fifty odd
S0278	be it
S0370	i think
S0278	oh right doesn't it make a difference the price that fuel be now when you think well i i've put in i've put in i've always put in a around about thirty pound when i fill up
S0370	mm
S0278	and then i go put thirty pound in and it go up to three quarter full and not half full doesn't it it make a big difference from what
S0370	oh right yeah cos you you can get
S0278	we we're we're get so i put in generally around about thirty pound
S0370	yeah
S0278	yeah cos i always
S0370	and then that go half full
S0013	well it's not surprise
S0370	fill up fill up mine
S0278	yeah
S0370	it be not the polo the people carrier
S0013	you put fifty pound in whereas it be sixty before wasn't it
S0012	yeah it be yeah
S0370	er i be close on to a hundred pounds' worth when i fill it up at once stage

S0370	if i stop at a garage i fill it
S0012	you might as well yeah
S0013	yeah
S0370	erm and the polo be considerably less now yeah it be quite noticeable
S0013	mm mm
S0370	cos it be i think come up here no when i set set off for erm i fill up in that's right and cos it say i have ninety miles to go erm but it be quite low about a quarter or something well i only manage to get thirty odd quid's worth in there
S0013	mm

S0012	yeah
S0370	it will copy everything off your computer onto your hard drive
S0278	well that's not the way i have it and it's a good job i didn't because say dad do you want to hold your stuff off the computer and cos the one that's all lock up in safe mode you can't do anything to it didn't have my document on so i could just unplug it and put it in my laptop and carry on you see if they'd be on that computer

S0370	right go on
S0278	be that i've get this box i'm work off and i've get the other box that i ought to back up onto i be terrify of copy and paste in case i lose it on the way i lose everything
S0370	no if you're copy it you can't lose it if you
S0278	be you absolutely sure i can't
S0370	if you do if you do delete and paste
S0278	there's no way it can't go wrong
S0012	yeah it can
S0370	you could
S0278	no but if you're copy and paste and it go all pear shape and jam up
S0370	it doesn't matter because all you're do be copy it the original one be still there it's not move the original it's copy the original
S0278	but if while it's try to move it it muck up
S0370	right if i say to you right this be exactly how it be right i'd like you to copy this on that piece of paper there be you go to lose that no
S0278	i know that but be be the technology go to behave
S0370	yes that's exactly how it work
S0012	i just think you're only make excuse
S0278	well i've have so much trouble with the things
S0012	i really do only because of your incompetence
S0278	well i don't know it be
S0012	yes mostly
S0013	yeah i think it's time we move
S0278	that's alright
S0370	it's time i move probably
S0012	you'll have to go down and sort him out
S0370	what
S0012	you'll have to sort all those problem
S0370	i don't understand these computers you know
S0013	you can do it though
S0012	mm
S0013	you can do it
S0370	all these computers stress me out
S0013	you can
S0370	so barclays card this even fill it out put don't know if you don't know right if you can make up a reasonable guess make a guess and send it on they're never go to check they'll just be please to give you the money and get rid of it
S0013	they be a bank i mean they just want
S0370	they don't want anything to do with it any more it must cost them so much money sort it
S0012	yeah
S0370	aside from the payouts they must have so many staff work on it
S0012	mm
S0013	yeah
S0370	nightmare but then they shouldn't have be naughty should they naughty bankers
S0013	how do they start it off then say this be illegal to have dine
S0370	well it's just one of those things somebody somebody try to make a claim
S0012	yeah
S0370	and they've say well you're self employ you you don't get anything and then they phone up money box and there we be say look i've pay this money in for the last five years i've be ill erm and they're not pay me anything cos i'm self employ but they never tell me that
S0013	they be cover mortgage mainly weren't they
S0278	oh they be they be all in insurance policies and things they probably you didn't know you be pay it some of the people cos
S0370	oh that's right yeah
S0278	i be sell it when erm actually just before i move up here i think and i remember i make a phone call to i be i think i be try i have to put i need to make one payment and there wasn't enough i didn't have a big enough allowance on one card so you can put two card together for a short period
S0370	yeah
S0278	you see so you can amalgamate the allowance from one card to another so you can make that payment in one payment it be buy the house
S0370	make sense do it
S0278	probably it's to do with buy the house it be and so i erm when i phone up to do that you get a call i get a call centre in say
S0370	mm
S0278	and the lady say while you're on the phone erm would you like erm an insurance erm that if you can't work we'll pay off your balance and i say well how much be it go to cost and she say it won't cost you anything if you don't owe us anything well i didn't owe them anything
S0370	mm
S0278	when i do that but then they don't tell you what you're go to have to pay if you do owe something
S0370	okay right
S0278	that's the problem but she didn't ask me whether i be self employ
S0370	that's where they make the mistake
S0278	that's their big mistake and it be just while i be phone about another thing i be sell it
S0370	mm
S0278	and
S0370	and they be they do it
S0013	yeah
S0278	that's fine that's fine it's not go to cost anything erm it's not go to cost anything i may as well have it
S0370	yeah yeah
S0278	which anybody would wouldn't they
S0370	yeah
S0278	but there's no such thing as a free
S0013	we don't get insurance things for anything anyway i think if it go you know er goods we don't pay
S0370	i don't tend to i sometimes think about it erm but
S0013	think about it but usually
S0370	invariably i think well okay the hoover will probably last three years anyway i play sixty quid for it well twenty quid a year for a hoover i don't want to pay another forty pound to insure it
S0278	no no
S0370	and then it go bust a month after the three years be up
S0013	mm
S0278	yeah
S0370	and anyway they they cover it for the first three years but the first year's cover anyway
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0370	so it's only two years you're pay for
S0013	and then you usually want a new one anyway if it do go completely
S0370	right there's your note
