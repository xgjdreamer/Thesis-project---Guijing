S0328	i also think like her mum's really attractive and like quite like sexy and you know it be her and her and like for age when she be like a single mum like she's really smart and she's aware of like
S0330	yeah
S0328	how that beauty and that femininity affect people
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0328	and like you know
S0330	for sure
S0328	she'll she'll have notice that and absorb it and she also
S0330	definitely
S0328	be like very pretty use to like get a lot of attention and compliment
S0330	yeah yeah
S0328	cos she's like she must just be like so fuck like fascinate and ready for that power and shit that she
S0330	yeah
S0326	yeah cos erm even when with my mum like use to get hit on by like just like in the during the day like all the time
S0328	yeah what who
S0326	yeah or like cos i remember everyone all everyone try to hit on my mum like when she be just get petrol and stuff you know
S0330	yeah yeah and and like if you imagine how that if er if you be a girl what what would that make you think about
S0328	i remember once say like you know er the reason that all boys always stare at you when we cycle round on the bike it's cos you're so pretty and so handsome
S0330	ah
S0326	you're a handsome woman
S0330	ah pretty and handsome
S0330	that's sweet
S0326	what
S0328	only that much i think you be look at me cos the wine's go

S0328	mm
S0330	really weird
S0328	but in a way like it be how the world be
S0330	yeah
S0328	and it's like you know it's a bite sooner but i don't think that's too much for someone to take on and like i er i mean some er like friends of people i've know like talk about like be really sexually aware from a really young age
S0330	yeah
S0328	i think it's also just like
S0330	yeah yeah no for sure i just think that like erm in my mind that you know i think about the next generation of women and how for them it'll be easier cos you know people will've pave the way and blah blah blah but actually they just might like massively take just completely understand femininity and and be a woman from from the closest woman to them
S0328	mm
S0330	like whoever that may be
S0328	yeah
S0330	which be actually much closer than you think but
S0328	say she be just like that
S0330	yep
S0328	when she be a kid she er she be she be like well up for it
S0330	yeah but i think it's so it's so much like erm yeah for some girls it's just what you be like what what you get attention for you know it's so obvious when you when you have like my nephew's my youngest nephew and he's like erm he's just really structure and
S0326	that one

S0330	and cos his er his older brother be really like beautiful and and and and very social and everybody basically give all the attention to him
S0328	mm
S0330	cos he's ginger and like just really vocal and you know and and the little brother's basically ignore and so he just fuck trash like trash everything
S0328	mm
S0330	cos that's the only way that he get
S0330	any attention and it's so obvious but like as soon as you see the two of them you can tell you can tell exactly what's gonna pan out and then they and then they fulfil it in every single way
S0326	yeah it's like
S0330	and all the adults around them totally fulfil that that that whole like everybody know what their role be and it's completely fulfil and every box be tick

S0331	no no no like he's a dick but

S0330	i'm a hundred percent do i'm a hundred percent do
S0326	how come he use to hang out with quite a lot
S0328	yeah i think even 's like like even 's like
S0330	even
S0328	's gotta sort his shit out man like
S0328	fuck what a mess
S0328	but er say he's like shoot up on the train and shit like that by himself like
S0330	really
S0328	i think or like maybe not shoot up on the train
S0331	no probably like
S0328	shoot up be a separate thing but like
S0330	well probably i wouldn't be surprise
S0328	get like do heroin on the train like by himself in the toilet that's quite bad i reckon do you reckon that's bad
S0330	that's really bad
S0331	yeah yeah
S0328	i dunno anyway i'm gonna see him
S0330	i think i think if you be to say something to him it would er be good
S0328	heroin
S0330	yeah but just but just a like also about his general
S0328	i know like 's tell him you know 's tell him
S0331	he doesn't care what anyone think though
S0330	but i think but the thing be
S0328	's
S0330	i think he he like build up what he he you you know if you like keep him on if you keep him on hold for a while then maybe he's sort of you know would respect your opinion more and i feel like because he's definitely talk to you about about whether like still like him or not any more then if be to say something he might actually listen
S0331	yeah
S0330	because you've like keep him on on hold for a while cos he's be
S0331	he's a he's a
S0330	such a bad boy
S0330	you know what i mean
S0328	bad man
S0330	just like just like
S0331	no no
S0330	no because because
S0328	yeah i know i don't i don't i don't know it's weird like heroin feel like less any of my business and then and then the rest of it all the way that he act anyway i don't really wanna talk to him about any of it
S0330	no it's not it's not very nice but it's but that
S0328	he won't change though you know
S0330	no but it seem a bite like at the same time it's either like you just tell him that he's be a dick or you just don't see him any more
S0328	yeah
S0330	and it's like one or the other and i'm and i would just like i'm do i'm not gonna tell him unless he ask
S0331	yeah or the third option which be what i'm do be just like just be his friend and
S0330	i'm i'm i he's be way too rude to too many people and to me like i'm i'm fuck do i'm bore of that
S0331	yeah but you yeah no no i be just i be er just say the third option
S0330	hang out with like dicks like that
S0328	but what's your what's your
S0330	just hang out with a dick
S0331	i be just say the third option
S0330	's third option be hang out with people who be
S0328	ah
S0331	er i can explain like my
S0330	yeah but he's really rude
S0331	yeah but he's also like a friend
S0331	like with plenty of flaw but who be like i think genuinely a good person
S0330	okay well that's yeah that's your opinion i disagree
S0328	i think i'm obviously more in the middle like i i i don't know if i don't know if honestly i think that he's a good person but
S0331	i think he have fuck shitloads of flaw
S0328	like i think when it come down to it if he can get away with it he do like you know whatever he want
S0331	yeah he's also like er like if you hang out with him sometimes it can be way better than hang out with other people
S0328	yeah
S0331	cos he's not that he's not very bore
S0328	but the then that's i guess what i be gonna say i don't really think at the heart of it that he's a good person that's not why i like him but there be
S0331	no it's more the fact that it's quite funny to hang out with him
S0328	history and stuff that
S0331	yeah you're right no it's not cos he's a good yeah
S0328	he's kind of a friend in a way and er you can have lolz with him i dunno yeah on balance it's a bite fuck but i will i will see him and like be mat but just keep it one on one you know i ain't bring him to any party
S0331	yeah
S0328	i guess it's funny cos like 's the latest person to really like him and really wanna give him a chance and he's like someone who like us and like meet him like work with him
S0330	work yeah
S0328	like when he's sober and he's like totally like
S0331	yeah the same with us as well
S0328	great to have around
S0330	he's the best he's a hundred percent best
S0328	yeah
S0331	we meet him work at
S0328	funny like make it like fun just like i think he be a really cool guy
S0330	and you have that glimmer of like like you and you see the like brilliant side of him that no one else really see
S0328	yeah no one see
S0330	no one see that
S0328	like which i didn't even figure out till much later it's like oh shit you're like that all the time to everyone else
S0330	yeah
S0328	i think it be just you know i catch him on the odd bad night but yeah like now have like really really get so much time for him want to help him all that stuff but it's interest that 's like i'll never do that again you know
S0330	what at lapland
S0328	like no before at er or whatever like i can't even remember who tell me that maybe someone say that last night but i don't know but he give him quite a few like come get clean like have a job you know create an opportunity that's what want to do
S0330	yeah yeah i dunno i just feel like there's nobody else who i've ever know to be that consistently rude with other people ever like that rude and to like still be give a chance i think it's a bite i find it a bite frustrate
S0328	mm
S0330	like i find it a bite like like i don't know i don't know why i have to give him any more slack i don't wanna give him any more slack
S0328	i guess like i wouldn't give him another chance
S0326	don't give him any more slack
S0330	just like totally do totally do
S0328	i i wouldn't give him a chance in the sense of like i wouldn't invite him to anything and introduce him to anyone like you know there's no like i wouldn't i just i just expect the worst from him you know but like talk to him
S0330	yeah yeah i guess i guess i
S0330	yeah you're right i guess i've i've probably never really consciously have er any friend who who i would
S0328	mm yeah it's definitely a weird one erm
S0330	er i i just find it i feel like he i feel like for him he have a whole different set of rule to everybody else and everybody else be like have to behave in this certain way and he doesn't because he's like can be funny sometimes
S0330	and i and i and i don't really i i don't like i don't really like feel comfortable with that at all
S0331	no i don't think that's the case because er it's not inexcusable the things he do people don't talk to him he know that people don't talk to him he get upset about it
S0330	yeah but i think the only reason he get i don't think the reason he get upset about it be to do with any kind of like conscience or
S0328	if he could away with it he would
S0330	pardon
S0328	if he could get away with it he would
S0330	yeah exactly that's that's the thing and er and i and i understand that everybody have their bad side and like you know we could all be fuck horrible if we want to i just don't like there be like
S0328	i wanna try it
S0330	yeah
S0328	i wanna see how far i can push it
S0330	yeah like
S0331	how horrible can you be
S0330	like really horrible
S0331	oh really
S0330	horribly horrible
S0331	yeah
