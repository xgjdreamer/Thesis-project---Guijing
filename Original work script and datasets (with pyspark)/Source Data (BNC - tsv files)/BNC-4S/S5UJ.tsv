S0086	he do
S0084	he do he call them
S0086	and he say it would be like two hundred two hundred and fifty quid
S0083	no
S0084	yeah
S0086	yeah it would be cheaper to buy another one
S0084	because of that because of that the part in that machine he'd have to come out and his his hourly rate be fifty quid and he'd have to come out twice
S0083	well i'm sure you could find somebody else
S0086	no
S0084	well he he find him because he's an expert
S0086	yeah and it's because it's the same price
S0084	so he be go to try and fix himself but then he think he might just have to buy a new one cos they're you know like a hundred and eighty quid aren't they
S0083	no that one be a lot of money
S0086	it be two hundred quid and and i say to him because he can only buy the meat today and i say look i'm sure my mum won't mind hold it in the fridge for one night and i'll bring it back and he be like no i don't want to do that and it's like well will have it in her fridge she won't mind

S0083	he's hopeless
S0084	i be just go to say if he just get the chicken out in the morning it would defrost by lunchtime so it won't be a problem
S0084	so it's just it's better that it freeze rather than not keep cool that's the better way around
S0083	but it be quite cool so what's wrong with if the flat's not heat it'll be fine i would say
S0084	yeah so it's not a problem
S0083	and he doesn't have a cat to worry about
S0084	thank god if both of you have cat it would never get out
S0085	you wouldn't even have to worry about oscar if there be chicken lie around he only like go cat

S0086	it's get um he's
S0084	jarod leto
S0086	he's from from a band isn't he

S0085	he's in um fight club
S0086	he's a bad actor and a bad singer
S0084	he be in the first thing that er clare danes be in my so call life which be like a teen drama in the nineties
S0085	have you see um freak and geeks
S0084	it sound awful
S0085	to watch it and it's from um like the nineties or the eighties and it's really old but it's get jam franco in it
S0084	mm
S0085	yeah
S0084	oh
S0085	but it's quite funny
S0086	i watch er man on a ledge today
S0085	oh my god
S0086	awesome film
S0085	no way
S0086	awesome film
S0085	i haven't see that i've see man on wire and that be terrify
S0084	that's really good
S0083	what's the man on a ledge
S0086	it's a film and it's get um
S0083	that's be that the one between the twin tower
S0086	it's get billy elliot in it
S0085	yeah
S0084	yeah

S0086	yeah but to prove he be innocent
S0084	well but he's not innocent be he
S0083	oh this be ridiculous
