S0109	cos they're a paper
S0110	it must be expensive but

S0108	yeah 's be not very please about the number of young people in i think it's embarrass enough be amongst your colleagues when you're well sweaty rather just you're pupils or ex pupils doesn't em
S0110	oh could be couldn't it
S0109	huh yeah it do
S0110	could well be it's only a park

S0108	well what do you need other than a treadmill and a run machine you know and a cycle machine
S0109	cross trainer
S0108	cross trainer
S0109	weight
S0108	yeah weight be
S0109	well 's pretty serious about it all he's pretty well build he's quite quite special and
S0108	as in he's pretty well build in euphemistic term
S0109	he's not he's not like naturally beefy but he's do a lot of gym work so he's get a lot of muscle
S0110	be he the one that you use to talk about before who go to the gym at
S0109	no that's he's he's pretty uh hench as well
S0108	i haven't hear that one
S0109	haven't you
S0108	no
S0109	it's quite common he's but generally in a more sarcastic term um you know yeah they're both
S0109	hmm the thing be i think it would be a pretty cool thing to do but it's just so expensive
S0108	yeah go some work go work somewhere where there's a free gym
S0109	yeah
S0108	i wake up this morning and i think i'd like to do the to cycle ride this year i have no idea where that think come from
S0109	huh
S0108	yeah
S0110	it's fun i think
S0108	oh people do it with heavier
S0110	i remember as in do it on the cycle ride and i think afterwards go out and buy a completely new bike she say hers it be just so heavy
S0108	well as mountain bike go it's not a particularly heavy mountain bike but it's not as heavy as a a hybrid or a town bike
S0109	another retort
S0108	hey if at work can do it i can do it
S0110	do you have to go into train for it
S0108	no
S0110	you'd just do it
S0108	yes
S0109	how far be it
S0108	sixty miles
S0110	how much hilly country be there
S0108	uh there be a few hill but i don't think it's anything extreme
S0109	oh be they be that the race that be on when i come to visit you
S0108	yes
S0109	in the summer
S0108	yeah
S0109	oh
S0108	it be just before my birthday so
S0110	yeah
S0108	maybe it be watch that guy um do the thing last night
S0107	like sort of
S0108	yes but he be do five
S0110	yeah
S0107	some some of them be give until combine to do it or
S0110	never say whether he get to the top or not do he
S0107	no there's a lot of
S0110	let's stop and look at the rock
S0109	the view
S0110	oh look here's one i just saw hard to find lie on the grind
S0108	but the thing be you'd get to the top and then they'd be so much cloud you wouldn't be able to film and then it would be all pretty disappoint wouldn't it
S0110	it go back down again i would enjoy that
S0108	that would be scary
S0110	hmm do you see that
S0107	i think it's just a at the time that you can endure the other ones they be all sort of the sort of usual this be really nice or this be interest it didn't actually come across like that at all
S0110	no out of the four program i think that be the the least sort of
S0107	the drizzle cold and
S0110	yeah
S0107	it's quite scary and quite the best of time
S0110	it be scary
S0108	i know
S0107	so i think that it's the
S0110	i doubt it be a bite more interest than i think it be go to be
S0107	the strange thing be consider that be bbc scotland be you get less
S0108	hmm it didn't have very many scottish people in it either
S0110	no
S0109	could have do with neil oliver
S0107	maybe the
S0108	yeah he's have love
S0107	maybe they scottish make a very scottish
S0110	no it just it just seem to me an awful lot of repetition
S0107	you just well that be just the splice together wasn't it it be
S0110	yeah
S0108	yeah it be uh you have ten minutes of program and then you have five minutes of recap
S0110	hmm
S0107	why he be on with you'd have to sort of positively work to keep it in a straight line but to have have a adapter a sort of gyroscopic type
S0110	oh look at those big lollipops big stick of rock
S0109	there's no point in them really you're never gonna be able to finish it
S0108	well you'd never be able to eat it cos you wouldn't be able to get your mouth round it
S0109	no you just have to lick it
S0110	when's daffodil season

S0110	yey and it's a
S0107	do you think it be just a slightly bigger fiesta and still have the same or

S0108	yeah i don't know
S0107	what's your budget
S0109	i don't know well i i don't think expensive or technically i haven't get my present yet because it say there's be an error with the ship or whatever but yeah not not i wouldn't think of anything over fifteen pound i don't think i don't know i say to her don't get me anything expensive um
S0108	why don't you do something with her
S0109	yeah well that's the thing i initially think that would be when she ask me what i want i i be think maybe i should just say uh could we do something then i be like uh what should we do what's there to do what do i want to do i don't know
S0108	well at the most basic go for dinner
S0109	hmm
S0110	go for what
S0108	dinner
S0110	dinner you could go somewhere for the day somewhere a bite different go to what be it the there go to the funfair at the
S0108	go to
S0109	hmm
S0108	go to probably more
S0109	i don't know
S0109	yeah there's probably stuff to do in go and find something to do in yeah
S0108	hmm what be she into
S0109	uh i don't know i don't know really i don't know
S0108	you don't know really
S0109	well like
S0108	well what do she do in her free time do she have any free time
S0109	yeah i don't know see friends
S0110	sound like you both need to take up a hobby
S0109	oh
S0108	i'm sure mum will now be on both of your case
S0109	yeah
S0110	hold on i forget my card after all that
S0109	she get a camera for christmas a good camera for christmas i think she have the intention of start to get into kind of take photos but um i don't know like cos you know um sarah and nathan from church they're both very into photography and
S0109	and um yeah i think she's kind of like um maybe i'll do that but i'm not sure she have really
S0108	what type have she get a sort of just digital camera or i'm go to say this wrong pixilar what's it call
S0109	snl
S0108	snl
S0109	i don't know
S0108	i don't know
S0109	i don't know well i just know she get it for christmas but i don't think i've ever see it or it tell you what you need to know
S0108	uh huh phil buy a camera the other day other month at church and he hasn't stop use it he put on facebook things like well they go on a men's weekend away and he come back with photos of toast and marmalade you're really into this now aren't you eh so i don't know what you'd do with that do you do things like get her a book on it and then she won't read it
S0109	oh yeah no
S0108	oh
S0109	no i don't think that's a very good avenue like we're get quite similar music taste like she's go to see coldplay with a friend in june at the emirates stadium in london eh em and she quite like muse she go to on the sunday last year and saw muse i'm very jealous yeah the line up come out on monday i think quite a few people be like well we might go depend on the line up whereas in the previous year's it's be like yeah we're go to regardless
S0110	do they share tent or do they all have their own tent
S0109	i think they all share
S0108	so i don't know whether you want to do camp at as your second experience in camp or whether you need to do something in between to show you that camp can be nice and then introduce the horror
S0109	i don't know i'm not do well camp but if if there's like a day when there's like either a really like band i'd like to see like there be there be rumour of green day possibly play or if it's a day when there be like a couple of band that i'm quite interest in then i be i would like to go um
S0108	what date sorry
S0109	i'm not sure
S0110	it's the last weekend bank holiday weekend
S0108	wooly time
S0110	when be the date for wooly then
S0108	eighteenth to the weekend after so saturday the eighteenth through to sunday the whatever it be
S0109	twenty sixth
S0108	twenty sixth plus a day of absolute exhaustion afterwards although i have say to i be only go if you can sort my sleep arrangements so i'm not share with so many people and i'm not between two dorms of kid that might be quite selfish but i think some sleep be kind of necessary no
S0109	oh yes
S0107	i do too i think those be acceptable constraints
S0108	uh
S0107	i'm just say it to be but it doesn't actually
S0110	yeah
S0108	she say she didn't see my well she say it be silly not to go if there be a way of solve it and that she well she think that it be possible cos she's on the um plan team and things she would uh if i write her an email she will then see if she can do anything officially about it cos they do want me to go cos they want me to do the arts and craft and they also want more female leaders this year so
S0107	i think you should write a fairly sort of succinct love to come but you would be unable to attend unless
S0108	i could think of craft ideas though i reckon we should do clay pigeon shoot
S0110	why
S0107	something different
S0107	imagine shoot at static target would be safer
S0110	yeah
S0108	sorry
S0109	i imagine shoot at static target should be safer for a
S0108	uh no i mean that we're gonna do clay uh but i'm gonna advertise it as clay pigeons
S0110	do you actually make pigeons
S0108	i will make one pigeon for eh for the advert and then basically they just turn up and do whatever they like i think mainly the craft be very tenuously link into the theme eh but when they turn up the kid just do whatever they want so we'll do the shirt paint which will be make your own sport kit or whatever eh and then they'll just come and get their friends to sign their t shirt and that will be their attempt at make their own kit and the boys will all sit and make friendship bracelets
S0110	don't they don't they want to make design and do you have fabric pen and things
S0108	oh yeah you have they have all the equipment that you could want it's just kid these days they lack creativity if i do something they will copy it like last year i make a photo frame with blue and white triangles on the border and everybody come out with photo frame with blue and white triangles on the border
S0108	be you do the holiday camp this year
S0109	hmm
S0108	be you do the holiday camp this year
S0109	yeah
S0108	do grace do it too
S0109	um she do last year but we be talk about it yesterday and she be say that well last year she do she help in the coffee tent in the morning which be for like mums and eh well parent that be that drop the kid off in the morning and then hang around for coffee and cake and stuff and then she go and help in the craft tent in the afternoon well that's what she do last year and um apparently the woman that be run the coffee tent last year have quit cos she wasn't very happy about the way things be run last year so um so she's not sure whether she'll do the coffee tent then she's not sure whether she'll do it at all but i be like do it join the refreshments team
S0108	go and play game
S0109	yeah
S0110	no
S0109	yeah
S0110	i mean seem to think that she she like drama
S0109	she's very good at drama
S0110	she be
S0109	she's get grade eight in drama
S0110	have she so
S0109	uh huh
S0110	i mean be there any possibility of her get involve in drama for
S0109	i don't know
S0110	do they do drama on holiday camp
S0108	drama's fun
S0109	yeah yeah well it's really weird cos like oh you would not know that she have any interest in drama whatsoever apart from the fact that once or twice we get talk about it and she's talk about how she's get a grade eight in drama like i don't think i've ever see her like act or do any kind of
S0110	well why do she do it then
S0109	i don't know
S0108	do she like theatre full stop
S0109	um i don't i don't think she's get a passion for it like i think at the in the last couple of months she's like be to the theatre with like her family like a couple of time but she's not be like rave about it but
S0110	she doesn't do english literature do she
S0109	no
S0108	oh no what a shame
S0109	she say she's get civilisation
S0110	on sort of speech and and drama type stuff and what we use to call elocution well which be kind of develop a bite more since the days when it be just say
S0108	hurricanes hardly ever happen
S0110	the rain in spain fall mainly on the plain um maybe it's to do with that as it obviously something with grade it's not your gcse drama be it
S0109	no
S0108	no but it could be um guildhall
S0110	could be yeah
S0108	no not guildhall that's the one in london what do i mean
S0109	i don't know
S0108	i have no idea what i'm talk about
S0109	um yeah well she i be say like that's like absolutely amaze um and she be like oh no it's not actually that hard it's like you do it be just me and a friend perform to two examiners and we do a like five minute piece that we prepare before and then we get give a uh subject and we've get like five minutes to discuss to devise a drama and then perform it and i be like oh that's still really difficult and obviously like you're amaze because you it's like grade eight so i don't know
S0110	do she play an instrument
S0109	she use to play um the drum
S0108	oh
S0109	but i don't think she's play in a long time she apparently she didn't like her teacher so she quit
S0108	well i could understand that you don't get on then i want to play the drum
S0110	do she have a kit
S0109	uh i don't well not that i have see mind you i think i have see all of the house now but i mean i'm not sure whether there'd be a drum kit hide behind somewhere i don't think so
S0108	well if she like drama then you could go and see something
S0109	i don't get i don't get the maybe i should try and like bring it up a bite more in conversation but i just didn't really get the impression that it be really like her thing like i don't know it's a bite weird but we'll see
