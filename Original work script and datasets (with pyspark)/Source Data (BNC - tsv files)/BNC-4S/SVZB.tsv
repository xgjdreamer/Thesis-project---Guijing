S0199	not his hair he's just lose it
S0192	just lose the plot in general
S0193	like 's lose the plot no it's just erm i think it be the way erm erm since he meet his his girlfriend fiancée sorry he's get engage
S0192	oh they're engage
S0193	yeah
S0199	get marry be it this year
S0193	no next year yeah since he meet he uh become everything in the relationship and more and more he have less time for his his kid see them ah very little very little time be devote to them very little time be devote to the grandchildren
S0192	mm
S0193	there be one occasion last year or be it the year before 's fortieth where and turn up and he didn't come and acknowledge his new granddaughter
S0192	what
S0193	because i be sit near and and she have the first wife syndrome
S0192	no come on
S0193	that's what we call it there's no other way to
S0192	so she's quite jealous protective
S0193	insecure
S0192	yeah insecure
S0193	and you know
S0192	neurotic
S0193	yeah and all that stuff so erm there be a big hoo ha and the kid in there say you know he didn't he didn't come over he didn't gel he couldn't be civil how you do how ah look at isn't she gorgeous and i could say yeah she be just be civil
S0192	yeah
S0193	i've never have anything against or anything i welcome her erm when he be ill the first time to come in and and say hello and sit with him
S0192	do you see him ever
S0199	no
S0193	but there's too many things that have happen
S0192	seem like whenever there's a divorce the man just doesn't just lose all contact with the rest of the family altogether
S0193	i think he find it hard
S0192	i mean who have contact with my dad nobody
S0193	eh
S0192	i be just say who have contact with dad nobody absolutely nobody
S0193	no no nobody on our side do they this be what happen the family divide it's horrible it really be horrible
S0192	mm
S0199	i think unless the two people stay friends unless there's no animosity unless there's like no bad feel
S0193	his brother the youngest one be
S0199	then you can still interlock the families
S0193	him him
S0192	i mean when do be ever end amicably it doesn't it doesn't
S0199	no
S0193	it do it can do
S0192	it can do but
S0199	no but over a period of time it's like you know your dad and i talk
S0193	well bitterness set in
S0199	well you know we have our spat or have do in the past
S0193	yeah but you can't sit down like i couldn't and and at a family do and have a laugh with his new eh erm wife or him with
S0199	i don't know i think now that we could i think now we could be civil enough to each other
S0193	i don't think you could
S0199	i could why would you say i couldn't
S0192	with dad
S0199	yeah
S0193	well i mean you could but i i just think i think you'd get irritate
S0199	well maybe yeah
S0193	if you're be honest you would get irritate
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	i mean only last time i be home there be a whole bunch of crap wasn't there
S0199	oh god but that be two years ago let's forget that
S0192	i know i know
S0199	it's do and go and sort
S0193	yeah but we're not bother we're just generally talk about the whys and wherefore it happen and i think
S0199	you know i've chat to your dad i've chat to your dad a number of time since then
S0193	i think there's irritation involve by one party oh god you know wind me up look what he's do
S0193	or it could be the other way you know and then there's and the other thing be bitterness
S0199	but when i look at
S0192	yeah i know of course
S0199	when i look at and and erm her ex they've stay all friends and and him be now really quite good mat
S0193	that's good that's wonderful
S0199	and now the in laws have stay friends
S0193	i take my hat off to people that can do it really really do
S0192	seem to be that ten percent doesn't it
S0199	but then 's mum and dad be still erm in contact with 's ex and close with her
S0193	i mean if i saw i'd stop and chat to him and i'm sure you would with
S0192	yeah
S0199	yeah definitely
S0193	because it's like all those years family laugh and stuff you remember it all
S0192	he's just no yeah
S0199	course you would course you would
S0193	i think what happen be when when it divide like when a marriage break and it divide you you pick up new root with a new part of a family don't you
S0192	yeah yeah
S0193	like you have with 's family he have with what's her name
S0199	's family
S0193	's family
S0192	and i know he didn't move far but it make a difference he's not in the same area at all so you're not really just go to bump into him i guess unless he's at work
S0193	well i mean i be in aldis the other day walk in there and he they don't speak it's awful
S0192	really
S0199	he be in there as well
S0193	yeah with

S0199	he need to sort that out he need to do something about it

S0193	no
S0192	be they
S0199	and when you do you only get blame for things so

S0199	it's it's be erm i think it's erm
S0193	she's not good
S0199	if you're a weak person emotionally that way i think you can be lead by the woman that you're with or the man that you're with
S0193	i always say with and and his side of the family cos that's not be easy all of the time have it
S0199	no
S0193	at all and i always say and she will you will say erm you know have you ring or have you this and why don't you ever go and see them and all those things
S0199	er support them
S0193	yeah support
S0199	mm
S0193	what you should and shouldn't do at time make the effort cos men i think can sometimes just go after the easy life
S0199	life's hectic and busy
S0192	or huh i think not necessarily myself but we're more black and white
S0192	less emotionally attach
S0193	and i think er you've get a good
S0192	so maybe he be just think i i raise them i do my job and
S0193	they know where i be
S0192	now i need to focus on my partner now because if i don't have my partner i guess he's think he need somebody
S0193	yeah
S0192	and he can't
S0193	and i think
S0192	and he's be put in a position where he go
S0199	yeah but can't you have both
S0192	well normally you'd think yeah but maybe this lady's give him an ultimatum and he's think
S0192	i'm no spring chicken i can't find some other lady so
S0193	with yeah
S0199	i mean we have touch of it didn't we with dad our dad she wasn't the right influence on dad to encourage him to keep our relationship go now
S0192	be that
S0193	well one she's racist for god's sake
S0193	they use to tell me we wouldn't have a black man in our factory
S0199	mm
S0192	that's terrible
S0193	and i er oh and load of things but yeah unfortunately he's with somebody that isn't really support him in the right way and encourage him and talk about things
S0192	so be it
S0199	you see if that be i'd be say to him go and sort that out with your children you cannot leave it
S0193	yeah
S0192	so no of course so the girls be frank with with but be they frank with
S0199	yeah
S0193	oh god yeah
S0192	they will tell her straight what be you do to my family
S0193	bonk her one
S0192	this
S0193	bonk her one
S0192	course she do
S0193	when they last go round because he chuck out and he he be texting her how she'd break a very small vase of 's that be special and it wasn't i'm sure
S0193	erm
S0193	and ring her and er you know silly things
S0193	oh you know er if if it be rain and 's wash be on the line she'd get hers and 's in and leave hers out all sort of things that go on
S0192	just petty
S0193	yeah
S0192	stuff that you just think what and she and she notice it and she know what be go on erm and they didn't speak for about six months when she in the last six months so
S0192	mum say she be live there and they weren't speak
S0193	yeah erm and erm
S0199	just so sad
S0193	just choose rather than support and
S0193	and have some contact with his other children
S0199	or try to sort it out with all of them
S0193	he choose to erm put all his efforts into her because she be the one with the insecurities and need his time and everything
S0192	yeah
S0193	and erm
S0199	i mean you can understand if you've get a woman that's kind of like erm i'm not happy with this and your children think that and your children say this and you know the man would be say think oh my goodness i can't cope with this
S0193	yeah but isn't it up to them to work it out
S0192	which path be easier
S0199	yeah what do i do my kid be grow up they've get their live i need to yeah but there be men that think that way
S0192	yeah i mean in my eye it do make him weak but
S0199	mm yeah
S0193	yeah
S0192	i would never do that but
S0193	yeah no exactly
S0192	then i'm take the weaker path and choose not to have children in the first place so
S0193	i mean look you know
S0199	at the moment
S0193	you you and you and in the begin somebody new you know huh you know break up marriage kid can react we know that we've be there ourselves but you know if wasn't the sort to make some effort
S0193	towards and
S0199	mm
S0193	because he love you
S0199	mm
S0193	because when he take on you he take on and
S0199	yeah definitely
S0193	and when you take on you have to take on
S0193	and that's how it work
S0192	i mean

S0192	yeah
S0193	and yeah and you make the choice
S0192	and to me it felt like an ultimatum

S0192	no no
S0199	when you go onto the road
S0192	no
S0199	it's just that
S0192	but i never do go onto the road nobody ever go up there i just kind of go right next to it and just say
S0193	so do you go past the it's like we use to go past in didn't we always look at the house and how you visualise it or remember it it's like quite massive in your mind
S0199	mm
S0193	we sort of visualise it as a
S0199	i bet it would be really small now
S0193	yeah
S0199	if we go into it
S0193	well your house be that you've get be quite a nice size house what's your dad's like
S0192	big
S0193	be it
S0192	yeah it's like four bedrooms
S0199	it's a nice house lovely house
S0193	four bed what modern
S0199	nah it's old
S0192	nah it's kind of old it's detach it's stupid because they have a pretty nice house with a pretty nice back garden on a really crappy street in a really crappy location
S0193	oh
S0199	be it
S0192	so that yeah the whole street be basically terrace and then there's like two detach house right at the end
S0199	be they set back aren't they
S0192	so that's why they've be they've be break into and the people next door have be break into
S0199	oh you're joke

S0199	yeah
S0192	it's not cheap i don't know what it be obviously they have a massive mortgage on it again but 's family be fairly well to do i think that's why dad doesn't want to marry her to tell you honestly i don't think especially with her be
S0193	what oh i think they didn't get marry
S0192	no especially with her be sick i don't think he
S0193	how be she by the way
S0199	because she'd think that the family think that'd be the only reason
S0192	i don't want yeah them to think that he's you know gold dig so i don't think he want to marry her for that reason have she not get sick maybe they'd have get marry but
S0193	yeah yeah but its put him off how they might perceive him
S0192	yeah because their family be quite well off
S0193	as long as she write him in the will that's the main thing
S0192	whether or not she will
S0193	how be she
S0199	i'm sure they will i'm sure she would right
S0192	erm i mean she's get her own children to look out for doesn't she so she

S0192	pretty much yeah pretty much i'm glad he get with and he saw some other girl briefly i go and meet her in do you remember
S0199	i do yeah
S0192	that's when i get my tattoo didn't like her don't remember her name she be a bite rough a bite more rough around the edge
S0192	and 's more you always say she be very nice and homey
S0199	she's a lovely lady yeah
S0192	she's very nice very very victorian
S0199	she's quite old fashion or she be erm but she's yeah i mean she's lovely
S0193	yeah
S0199	from what i remember
S0192	she's she can listen to liberal things it's not that she's you know completely old fashion she surprise me as i've get to know her more
S0199	no
S0199	yeah
S0192	but at first i find her to be a bite
S0199	i mean i didn't know her that well do you know what i mean she just come from a older kind of background you know what i mean
S0192	yeah
S0199	just
S0192	yeah horse rid bite of money
S0199	you wouldn't imagine her to go club and stuff like that when she be young
S0193	oh kind of erm what do you call it not erm conservative a bite
S0192	just middle class really yeah
S0199	or maybe yeah
S0192	we're all we're all work class aren't we and erm she's middle class
S0193	mm
S0192	i wouldn't say she's upper class
S0199	but then her ex wasn't at all
S0192	no
S0199	he be really quite rough and ready
S0193	so she marry beneath her
S0192	terrible
S0199	there shouldn't be any of that should there
S0193	god i'd marry but there be there always will be in this english society way it's always be the aristocrat
S0192	out of your caste
S0199	yeah yeah yeah
S0193	the royals the top ones the aristocrats then you've get the power of government
S0192	mm the elite
S0193	and then you've get the business white collar workers then you've get the workers
S0199	yeah i think it's just from what i remember i think her mum and dad be quite posh i think
S0193	and then you get the low life and the poor scroungers
S0192	the yeah they seem it
S0199	so that's come from
S0193	people use to think i be posh
S0192	people think i be because of the way i talk
S0193	because one can just deliver a conversation of high quality and and then
S0192	perhaps
S0199	or fart
S0193	yes
S0193	just at the touch i know
S0199	just to make sure they know you're not
S0192	yeah
S0193	and how do you get on with 's erm side
S0192	yeah i i don't really know them very well we've be pretty lucky
S0192	not really be around each other's families
S0199	this be go to be it's go to be a shock isn't it for them this next year
S0192	i mean you've never meet her have you i don't think
S0193	yes once
S0192	you do meet her
S0193	i'm sure i have once
S0192	she's meet i don't know why
S0199	she's meet
S0192	i be talk to her the other day she seem to think she's meet but not you
S0193	maybe i haven't meet her
S0192	she seem to think be up that time she be up
S0199	ah maybe
S0192	she describe
S0193	maybe i've see picture of her and i think i've meet her but i haven't
S0199	you think you have
S0192	yeah but i don't really know her family that well obviously her parent be erm i've meet them a few time at uni but that be years ago now
S0199	be say that you be the first person that meet when when they drop her off at uni
S0192	yeah literally the first person yeah literally the first person
S0193	really
S0192	she be in my flat so i've live with her for ten years
S0193	and then say erm say what do you say something about yeah and they get together straight away or something and then but say well not straight away
S0192	no
S0199	because they be friends first
S0192	it be about six months
S0199	yeah
S0192	i get with about three or four girls in between that
S0199	and
S0193	eh
S0199	see how i know and me and
S0192	mum's probably meet them about as much as
S0199	i meet them at the airport
S0193	that's it
S0192	say hello
S0199	we have an hour conversation
S0192	i mean it's useful for us we just kind of keep the family separate and it's nice and easy but that's why the whole idea of like have a wed and get our families together just sound ghastly i can't think
S0193	oh bloody hell we'd be like beam with pride
S0192	it's not go to happen it's not just you guy though be it it's then get together dad and his lot and and then try to think of mum and dad together and
S0193	oh that no that would be something your mum and dad would be fine over
S0199	go to worry about that
S0192	yeah it's the cost as well because i think we're just go to
S0193	oh yeah
S0192	we're just go to do it as cheap as it come
S0199	yeah but you know families will put money into it as well everyone just want
S0192	yeah but i don't want them to put the money into a honeymoon and i'll go on holiday
S0193	at the end of the day
S0199	yeah you can still have a pub get together couldn't you
S0193	at the end of the day you do what you want to do
S0192	and i have say you know years down the line if we've get if we've get money then we may erm we may you know have a second wed well not even have a second wed have a wed because this time we're not go to have a wed we're just go to get marry so
S0193	what be it you guy want to do
S0193	be you get marry what for because your
S0192	for visa purpose really
S0193	oh right okay
S0192	so we in our eye when i propose to and she say yes we be marry and really i probably wouldn't have propose because neither of us be particularly traditional but we have discuss seriously and not just vaguely discuss but seriously discuss get marry to the point of talk about who be go to come where be we go to do it how much be it go to cost
S0193	okay
S0192	because if we're go to the middle east we have to doesn't matter that we've be together for ten years
S0193	oh i see right yeah
S0192	i couldn't touch her i couldn't see her i couldn't be in the same room as her
S0193	yeah
S0192	couldn't do it
S0199	do she need to wear
S0192	a burka yeah
S0199	how the heck would she cope with that for a year
S0192	well when she's teach she'll be in an all girls university and i'll be in an all boys university
S0193	she hasn't she's get to wear a thing
S0192	so in the compound where we live she won't have to wear it at work she won't have to wear it but only when we get out on the street but i mean i'll be wear a full on white head to toe thing
S0199	but do she also have to walk behind you
S0192	there'll be rule that will apply
S0199	gosh that be so tough
S0192	she can't get a she can't fly out of the country without my permission even though we're marry and that kind of stuff it's not an easy place to live
S0192	's go too right
S0192	but so
S0193	control
S0192	after we think about it like practically
S0193	why be you go there for for for what study money
S0192	no for work yeah pay well it pay well
S0193	oh pay well
S0192	and the job be good i can i can say
S0199	and after pay for
S0193	what about dubai isn't that nice to go to
S0192	yes if we can get a job in dubai or uae or bahrain that'll be slightly more liberal
S0193	yeah yeah
S0192	and it'll be easier but have get more job and you need less experience we only need to do one year in once we've do one year we can get job in uae and we can get job in dubai and all these kind of place
S0193	right so you're do it and be it safe to go there
S0192	you need middle east experience oh yeah it's fine
S0199	and be happy with all those restrictions
S0192	yes absolutely for one yeah i mean we both be kind of excite to live in a place that crazy we like travel we've be in pretty crazy place so i mean live there for a year i it's a year we know how quickly a year go
S0193	yeah it's challenge for you guy isn't it it's excite
S0192	it won't be a problem yeah it won't be a problem so when we kind of really talk about it and i kind of think oh that's not very romantic be it we're not go to have a wed we're just go to have a sign a piece of paper i think she at least need a proposal and i think well we're go
S0193	what about a send off before you go bloody out there you can't
S0199	god hold on he's only just get back he's not go anywhere
S0193	no but he's talk about marriage we're talk about the marriage thing and he doesn't want
S0192	we may not even get marry if we if we
S0193	to go there you have to
S0192	yeah but if we get a job that's not there we're not explicitly go there i mean if we get a job in kazakhstan or iraq or any number of other place that also pay well then erm we don't need to get marry then we may never sign the paper so it's only if we have to that we will
S0193	mm
S0192	she might not even change her name
S0193	so basically oh right that's what i be go to say so basically you're you're live as man and wife anyway
S0192	yeah
S0193	and you see each other as marry you just haven't get it down on paper
S0192	yeah
S0193	you're not the traditional way
S0192	no
S0193	yeah
S0192	i mean i get her a wooden ring not a not a metal ring
S0193	yeah when when your mum say
S0192	which she love she really like it and i kind of say to her you know it's not permanent like a metal ring but whenever it break or get scratch i'll replace it i promise her that i would replace the ring forever
S0193	yeah
S0192	and she can have a different ring every time
S0193	so she's
S0192	and it's nice as well because she doesn't i tell her that she doesn't need to feel like she's get to wear it all the time or anything or worry about it wear it when you want to wear it wear it when you if you feel it go with your clothe or do whatever so she doesn't wear it all the time she wear it when we go out and that kind of stuff
S0199	oh i'll bet i bet that mean the world to her
S0192	yeah she be pretty choke
S0199	mm
S0192	i think she wouldn't be surprise i think she'd expect it
S0193	what choke that it be only wooden joke
S0192	but erm i mean it be a hundred quid for a ring you know what i mean why be i go to spend thousands of pound on a ring it's just ridiculous
S0199	mm
S0193	yeah
S0192	she know that
S0199	you're not those type of people
S0192	she wouldn't want me to she'd think i

S0193	yeah i'd think what could i do with two grand
S0192	yeah well that's exactly it and i
S0199	go on a fantastic adventure together
S0193	i'd be absolutely chill if it be like anything like five six seven eight hundred i'd be like oh my god i can't wear it out what if you know
S0192	that's the thing with she doesn't feel like there's no none of that stress to like worry about
S0193	to me that amount of money and what and spend on their weddings be like about what be it twenty grand each twenty grand for a wed
S0192	yeah
S0192	it's ridiculous
S0191	hey mummy

S0193	what be what be like
S0192	that be years ago i go there in two thousand and eight straight after uni i go there but i go to and for like five months
S0193	oh yeah
S0192	but erm i'm just say about the cost five months in scuba dive paragliding my flight all my food all my accommodation all my two thousand pound that cost me so two thousand pound i could travel for five months and do all of that stuff or i could have well that's not even one that's just the ring isn't it that's not
S0193	on your travel that you've do what couple of or be there something at the top of the list that you will always remember
S0192	there's place definitely
S0193	yeah
S0192	there's experience that we've have definitely if we have more time
S0193	and what be they
S0192	oh i mean there's so many you need to kind of just be around me and i'll tell you a story at some point but
S0193	well do anything stick out that be really remarkable i know there must be so many
S0192	ah hike in the would be one of them be in the and would be another all the ruin in in all the ruin all that kind of stuff
S0199	do you still feel the wow factor
S0192	i've see a i've see a volcano erupt from and we've literally stand on top of a four and a half thousand meter mountain watch a two and a half thousand meter volcano erupt just like constantly erupt in front that be pretty special erm get bite by a dog that be quite excite
S0192	we've get lose numerous time i've see some amaze animals see beautiful snake very deadly snake when i've be travel all sort of things there's so many so many stories i've get but erm
S0199	he need to write a book doesn't he
S0192	i can't just say it i well if i'm around you long enough i'll like tell you a story but there's too many to count really and i want more and i have get our sight firmly on africa
S0193	oh
S0192	once we've do africa i think we'll feel like more content
S0193	yeah yeah one more that you've get to see
S0192	you know maybe we'll start think about settle down a bite more but erm the main plan now be do the ma do one year in and then one year there i can save enough to do my delta which be another teach qualification
S0193	a
S0192	a delta
S0193	delta
S0192	i've already get a celta it's an acronym for diploma of english language teach
S0193	yeah
S0192	it's the equivalent of a master but once i've get that we'll have enough money to travel africa for a year so i'll probably travel from south africa to egypt and just follow the east coast down and then i might feel a bite more content
S0193	fabulous
S0192	but say that we're already think that we want to go back to and travel more there so it's we feel
S0199	will the travel bug ever stop
S0192	yeah i don't know we've get at least ten years more i think
S0193	and do you think you'll have children between you both eventually be it something on your that you've both talk about
S0192	we've both say you know part of us that's a massive experience to miss out on
S0193	can you imagine like indiana jones there'd be a it'll be a junior with his travel
S0193	come on son we're off to africa again
S0193	okay dad
S0192	i don't think there's enough time or money be the problem if i have another ten years another ten years i think i could
S0199	mm
S0192	if if and i could spend the next ten years you know do our ma do our phd travel get to the point where we're qualify professors at a western university
S0193	yeah
S0192	that kind of thing which we could do by the time we're forty i think we can have kid at forty
S0193	where do you see where do you see yourself course you can
S0192	oh no we can't 's 's mum hit the menopause at thirty nine as do her sister
S0193	yeah i do at forty
S0192	and we're like so maybe maybe we'll adopt
S0192	be what we've discuss if
S0193	oh you think you might adopt do you angelina jolie or a or a madonna
S0192	if we get to like if we get to like forty and we're comfortable
S0193	yeah
S0192	we feel educate enough we've get a good enough job we feel that we can provide for our children comfortably
S0193	i should think you will be able to
S0192	then erm maybe at forty we'll start think about about have children but it won't be until then
S0199	come on in it's rain darling
S0192	like we've really seriously discuss it and i can't see how we could have children until
S0193	mm mm you're happy with your live
S0192	yeah
S0193	come and sit here darling you're happy with your live the way they be go and you're enjoy more importantly enjoy it enjoy the experience and the countries
S0191	i'm hungry
S0192	it's yeah that that also but that make it sound selfish and it's not purely you know
S0193	not really
S0192	but it's also i look around and just see eh the world that you're bring your children into how many children already exist and how many problems there be with that then we need to have our own child or
S0193	yeah
S0192	we'd take a child and a home
S0193	i mean the way you talk it sound absolutely you know i can understand travel you you you're learn and the way to learn be travel around the world
S0192	yeah it bother me as well that i feel like at the age of four you kind of have to give your child up for the state and just kind of like oh yeah school be now you've get to do it you get to give your child up and i don't really agree with the way they teach in school or how school be in general and the idea for me to have a child and then think i get that child for four years and then the state take it until it's like sixteen or eighteen and they decide what the child learn and they decide who the child be with and all that kind of stuff and they control them for me i that's not the kind of environment i'd want my child to be in
S0192	i'd much rather you know we teach the child i mean and i have say if we could just work part time both of us and we alternate and we make sure that because we have think that and if you know i'm at home with the child
S0193	when she's
S0192	when 's at work erm
S0193	yeah and you raise you teach your own child
S0192	but that's not particularly easily do so
S0193	you don't know where you're at in ten years do you
S0192	we might try and get dual citizenship with another country we've seriously consider you know maybe maybe erm try to do our phd you know and i need to see how the master go first maybe that'll be too difficult and i won't be good enough to do a phd but say that i be if we could get to do one in canada or argentina or even unite state somewhere that's bigger where if we get where we may be able to afford property where we may be able to have some land or something like that then we'd kind of like to do that because let's face it i haven't get
S0193	keep the legacy go
S0192	yeah
S0199	mm
S0192	i haven't get any inheritance come 's not from a 's from a poorer family than we be
S0193	yeah
S0192	i'm not there's no way we're go to get on the property ladder in it's not go to happen
S0193	yeah
S0193	well the only inheritance you'll get be a share of mum and eh 's house and your dad and 's house
S0192	that's not go to happen though i don't think it's i mean
S0193	not for a long time
S0192	ah they've get he's not go to be that old when they pass as a fact and i mean i can't see you live beyond eighty and even then he's still only go to be in his early twenties and mid mid to late twenties at best
S0192	so i mean he's go to need most of the
S0199	no not for thirty years
S0199	fifty fifty three sixty seventy eighty no he'll be thirty four
S0192	i mean let's face it who who oh okay
S0193	i think that be a bite wrong
S0192	okay but i mean when i
S0191	hey
S0193	young man
S0192	i'm not actually expect mum to live to her
S0192	i mean who in our blood family have live beyond seventy nobody
S0191	you say one
S0193	erm
S0191	you be lie
S0192	how old be nan when she pass
S0193	sixty nine be seventy two oh nan our nan be sixty nine your nan be seventy two
S0192	i mean i'm not wish away your life or anything
S0193	darling no no your toy
S0192	i'm practicality like chance be be go to need that money or if that doesn't even happen you know we're not from a well to do family so they'll probably end up go in to some kind of care or something and that just take all your money i'm not i'm just say i'm not i'm not i don't think if i do anything brilliant but i think a lot of my friends can pretty much rely on the fact that they're go to be get hundreds of thousands of pound
S0193	yeah you're you've talk about it yeah
S0192	no worry so they don't have to worry about that kind of thing
S0193	no my kid aren't my kid haven't get anything come their way we get i think we get about well 's still alive so he's keep the house you know that hasn't be sell yet like our dad die and you know there be nothing from our dad which be still there there'll we won't get anything
S0192	well i i both i mean seem to do pretty well like he's get side
S0199	property
S0192	no so i just you know
S0193	i think it's up to kid nowadays anyway it's nice to have a windfall it's nice to have something to pass on but nowadays kid go out and make their own way in life don't they
S0192	so different in so different
S0193	be it
S0192	they erm they erm you know pretty much ninety five percent of the country go to uni and of that ninety five percent that go to uni ninety five percent have it completely pay for by their parent they live with their parent until they're in their parent no worry erm their parent will leave them everything at the end it's all about family there it's all like
S0193	yeah yeah
S0192	i'm not actually say it's necessarily a good thing because they have a lot of problems
S0193	no they
S0192	but they can't understand to think when i tell them that i live on my own at the age of seventeen and i start travel when i be like eighteen nineteen
S0193	they're like what the hell you're still a baby
S0192	they can't they can't comprehend it
S0193	yeah
S0192	can't comprehend it it be really weird when i first go to and they mollycoddle you and kind of say do you know how to make a cup of tea do you know how to use an atm machine and i feel like turn around and tell them i'm on the opposite side of the world without my family without my friends and you're ask me if i know how to use a cash machine
S0193	yeah
S0192	this be ridiculous they have no idea of really what we be do or like because they don't they don't travel
S0193	so they're very very
S0192	they don't live without their family
S0193	so they're very protective
S0192	yeah
S0193	and they stay in one spot rear the children make sure they've get everything and then leave it all to them and go
S0192	yeah but they're they really push them it's terrible what they put their children through it's horrible they may have the second best school in the world but it's horrible i mean if you take the average high school they have no childhood none whatsoever they all do private school so from the
S0193	what do you mean they don't play
S0192	i mean they play at school i guess but
S0193	it's chores when they come home and
S0192	it's not chores it's school again i mean
S0193	oh study
S0192	yeah if you take the average high school student they pretty much in a lot of the school live on site they'll go to school they'll go to school at like seven be they'll finish school at like five or six then they go
S0193	that's a long day
S0192	then they go to a private school at like eight and then stay there until midnight
S0193	what
S0192	so they study all day all day they have no life and then they finish school and then they go
S0193	and this be normal for what
S0192	yeah for everyone and then they finish school and they go to university and then they the boys have to do military service for two or three years and then a that come in the middle of uni and then they come back and they finish uni and then they're get in to their late twenties and if you're not marry with children by the time you're thirty you're weird in you're really strange so there's a lot of pressure for them they have no life they go through the whole of school then they do uni army then they get marry they have children
S0193	so they can't get into trouble get drink
S0192	no
S0193	and
S0192	i mean they do get drink it's a country of alcoholics they drink a lot a hell of a lot they can
S0193	and what do the girls the girls' life be that much the same study study
S0192	yeah the same yeah oh the same absolutely they just don't do the military service bite it's sad the suicide rate be so high there and all that kind of stuff
S0193	be it
S0192	yeah really high really high
S0193	what because the kid can't hack it
S0192	yeah and it's get worse because i mean the country's come on so far in fifty years fifty years and it be one of the poorest countries in the world and now it's one of the richest and it's like
S0193	what
S0192	yeah its really really i mean it's not
S0193	it's one of the richest
S0192	it's it's in it's the top five in in and it would be in the top fifteen in the world yeah have you see there's like three hundred countries in the world they're really powerful really strong country they're do a lot of development in a lot of countries and all that kind of stuff but erm i mean they get it's like england they have a population of about fifty million people and the size be about the same it's really clean they actually oh careful of her foot there's erm some of their service be a hell of a lot better than they be in england you go to a bank you want a new cash you want a new card they'll make you for you right there and then they'll wait on you and serve you you go to a cash machine you can deposit money into a machine you can pay all your bill at the machine you can transfer money at the machine you can do everything they have service there i mean you get load of free stuff crazy you buy something you pretty much you always get a gift like something else
S0193	oh
S0192	it's a on a on a bunch of ground on a bunch of things they do a they do things better than we do it's really very modern and very like
S0193	and do their children when they go go to university go to university over there or come to other countries for their degrees
S0192	if their parent be load they'll send them abroad but if most people don't i mean it's a thing although i see the population be the same as england but in england we've get about a hundred and twenty universities in the whole country in korea they have over three hundred so they've get almost three time the amount of unis that we've get because like ninety five percent of people go to uni in fact this be they call it school they don't really see it as something different in england we wouldn't we wouldn't say universities as school it's not school it's almost mandatory
S0193	yeah it's just like school yeah no yeah
S0192	so they kind of call it school
S0193	yeah
S0192	and they don't really understand when i'm like no uni be not school then they're like yeah it be but like
S0193	yeah
S0192	i mean the word mean school and university be which mean like grand school you know what i'm say
S0193	yeah
S0192	it's school you know so on the one hand some of their society
S0193	it's quite regiment in their study
S0192	yeah absolutely
S0193	very important
S0192	and it's sad because they're very naïve and very like not they're not wise about the world they don't have much street wisdom or anything
S0193	but then when they study and they're do all this erm when then study so much and they're come out with university degrees and good job do they then go abroad or do they just stay
S0192	some do they're get better they're definitely travel more and travel more be open up their eye to ways other people live and what's go on so the society i come back to england and i say oh they've build a new school or something but really england's change very slowly it's not it's not really change like be change very very quickly and they like they don't leave any build to stand every time a build hit forty years old they knock it down and build something else so like nothing they can't understand when i say that i grow up in a house that be you know they just find that and like there's a church down the road that's like six hundred years old they just they can't believe it nothing in their country be older than forty years old
S0193	wow oh that's strange isn't it
S0192	but they follow the american same as the state it it stimulate economy it's capitalism so in the state they do the same they don't change a build they knock it down and build a new one so if your
S0193	but you see that would that's sad to me
S0192	it be sad it's waste material
S0193	it's it's sad because there's so much history's be so interest
S0192	yeah
S0193	isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0193	our forbear father and you know and it's like the way things be
S0191	be your six pack like that
S0192	it be a part huh my six pack like that definitely bigger than that i've get like a twelve pack of beer
S0193	it's it's hard to not it's hard to erm
S0193	knock down get rid of
S0192	though part of part of that it have its pros and con i do love all the architecture but it it keep us a bite stagnate in england it make it difficult to change things like policy and like social
S0193	yeah
S0192	the way people be about things it's very difficult to push things through in government because we have all these rule and regulations on how things must be
S0193	yeah
S0192	whereas in countries like things can change quicker
S0193	yeah
S0192	you know if something go wrong i mean do you hear about that ferry sink
S0193	yeah
S0192	terrible three children die
S0193	yeah
S0192	just off the coast terrible plan they'll never admit it really but the whole reason be because they listen to order from above and the order come out do not move so everyone sit in the ship and it take the ship an hour to sink and for age they're just sit on this ship slowly tilt and by the time its tilt and all the rescue crew be there they can't get them out and they stay in there because they'd be order to stay in there it's ridiculous
S0193	mm
S0192	so they've now complete change policy and like really step up on their like health and safety on boat and all this kind of stuff but it's it's sad that things that that's part of their it's part of their social problem really be they they do they have what's call a confucian hierarchy i don't know if you've ever hear of confucius he's have you hear of him he be like a
S0193	i've hear the name but i don't know what it mean
S0192	he be a philosopher
S0193	yeah
S0192	in china and they they follow their confucian a lot of countries and confucius believe that there be an innate erm hierarchy between father and son between teacher and student between there be all these different kinds of hierarchies
S0193	yeah
S0192	and then there's your place in society and what you must do it's kind of like a caste system affectively but it's like through peer and through youe your people that be above you
S0193	yeah
S0192	so they believe that you know if if a teacher tell them stay there well they they honestly believe that because the teacher be in be in superiority
S0193	yeah
S0192	whereas in in the west we be very independently mind we'd have never sit there we'd have be like ah hang on a minute i want to have a look out the window and see you know what's go on
S0193	yeah freedom of speech yeah
S0192	i'm on a boat that's go to sink i'm not go to stay inside
S0193	yeah
S0192	but three hundred people three hundred children die
S0199	whatever happen to those children that be abduct from that school we hear any more about that
S0192	in
S0199	no not in
S0192	in england
S0193	oh

S0193	no
S0192	no you all just don't get on
S0193	oh not with
S0192	no
S0193	oh no
S0192	don't want to talk to her or just
S0193	i've never meet her i've get no interest to meet her
S0192	no
S0193	i don't have a relationship with any more
S0192	oh not at all so you're not go to see him when you go down
S0192	oh okay
S0193	if want to he can but if he bump into them i wouldn't go you know how you do
S0192	no no
S0193	but
S0192	so where will you stay
S0193	oh i've i've hire i hire a cottage apartment thing
S0192	still in
S0193	in
S0192	yeah
S0193	yeah
S0192	nice
S0193	but erm he just i think because of what happen with the the break up and then me erm yeah the woman and all that hoo ha stuff i think he take very much 's side the children's side and all the hurt and pain that they go through
S0192	oh okay
S0193	and stuff and erm so do as well
S0192	do too
S0193	yeah
S0192	so you don't talk to her either
S0193	not very much no i i no she take the same approach so i just
S0192	why do people take side on things you know
S0193	because they be erm
S0192	shouldn't it be about be
S0193	narrow mind i don't know feel they get to fight the fight with a side with somebody and you know
S0192	well i mean i doubt they have much contact with do they so
S0193	i've no idea if he do
S0192	i doubt do they
S0193	anyway so that's how they be so be like that erm so that's fine it didn't bother me i wasn't extremely close to anyway i be i get on with him i never hat him but i think i probably love my dad too much to ever allow to be any closer to me
S0192	yeah i mean that's fair i understand that
S0193	you know so i i might and i be about what be i fifteen you be about thirteen
S0199	you be sixteen
S0193	sixteen
S0192	it's weird
S0193	you know at that age you're like i don't want to get to know you
S0192	because from our perspective as the the grandchildren he's the only grandparent anyone have yeah so he's my grandad
S0193	and he's the only he's your he's your grandpa yeah
S0192	which i find weird because what you're say like with he's never go to replace my dad or anything so he'll always be and i'll get along with him but if i be to have children then he would be a complete granddad with a biological or whatever else
S0193	mm mm mm
S0199	i find it hard with and the grandchildren because i love them like my own grandchildren and i will you know play with them take them up the park and do all of that stuff but i will never ever
S0192	i find the concept a bite strange
S0193	i'll tell you what you won't do when give you a grandchild and
S0192	if
S0193	if that happen
S0192	but you won't be acknowledge
S0193	you will feel you will feel you will feel differently because they be your blood
S0192	so the the children don't obviously so 's make sure of that that they don't
S0199	i'm sure i would but no yeah
S0193	be through some weird stuff haven't you
S0192	i mean tell me when we be away that they still kind of resent i think
S0193	oh yeah i think they do
S0199	i think i think that that have creep in yeah because they never ask about us or what we're do or where we've be or do we have a good holiday there's no general conversation at all it's all about them and their live and and what they're do erm he's in the bush i don't think he can get out
S0192	he's completely disappear do you want me to go and have a look
S0199	hold on he can't get out the garden can he
S0193	it's hard isn't it though the split up stuff
S0192	oh there he be he's hide in the
S0193	no he can't get out there at all
S0199	oh tinker
S0192	he's hide
S0193	that be a good one
S0199	what's he find
S0192	i don't think he's pay any attention to us whatsoever
S0199	no he's not
S0193	he's in a he's in a little world on his own
S0192	erm yeah
S0193	yeah
S0199	i think it's more the fact that they resent that hasn't get more granddad time or more time with them because he's have to share his time with
S0192	mm
S0193	it be though wasn't it it be that resent i think you fall pregnant the same time
S0199	yeah i mean it be bad time totally
S0192	i mean to a to a degree that's understandable isn't it she's probably think it's my turn to have children
S0199	yeah
S0193	yeah
S0192	and i want to be a granddad
S0193	i want my dad to she's go and get pregnant and that's through a child's eye
S0192	yeah
S0199	yeah totally and we understand that and we have the conversation of should we get rid of we have that conversation
S0192	well it's not too late
S0199	that's a cracker
S0193	oh god
S0199	because we know that oh my god this be the worst time ever
S0193	i love the sense of humour that's funny
S0193	that's a good one
S0192	i mean the same for us yeah to a certain degree as you're get older it would've be nice when i come and visit to like have you your attention you know fully but 's here and you can't change that so
S0199	mm
S0193	yeah no
S0192	i'm not go to resent it or anything like that it's just how it be
S0199	i mean i don't know for sure but that's how it seem to be
S0192	yeah
S0199	that's what be i feel be probably the the thing
S0193	they're a funny pair aren't they they don't pay enough attention to their dad
S0192	but i mean do you need them
S0199	no
S0193	no but they're 's kid aren't they
S0199	yeah course and you know i care for them and
S0193	but do you need them perhaps that's what 's think what say do you need them if you
S0199	it's not that need though be it it's about their family and i guess so yeah
S0192	obligation
S0199	it's erm i don't know really

S0192	yeah as long as they're british
S0199	do you want to get to fill those form in
S0192	i need you to consign it i need you to sign a consent form in a minute and then i have to go home and analyse it a little bite for what kind of dialectical feature that basically they're just see what your what your accent be they're not listen to what we're say they're listen to the word that you use and your accent that's it
S0199	we're go in a minute darling go home get tea get an early bed get up in the dark
S0192	erm it's go into a corpus so effectively everyone i record be be archive for history so forever if they ever want to look up what do british people sound like in two thousand and fourteen your voice will be on there you'll be record
S0191	then when you get to your hand turn it no no no no no no do that
S0193	that's an easy way to make some money
S0192	it's really easy yeah it's a really good job i be lucky to get it pretty lucky
S0191	open your finger
S0193	and what's do
S0192	it just so happen this be the first as far as i know this be the first time they've ever make a record corpus so before they've they've make a write corpus so they do a corpus like ten years ago and that be three hundred million word that they input in the corpus so there's a body of language and this be what british english be ten years ago write and now they want a speak one so they're pay
S0193	and what's do
S0192	the same
S0193	oh she's
S0192	but we're only contract under one contract which be a bite of a problem for tax purpose so i have to do my own tax on this and all that kind of stuff so i have to be self self employ so i have to at the end and yeah in april i need to file tax so who know how much they'll take on that but as far as i know i have i can do until june next year i can do an unlimited amount of record and i get pay eighteen pound for every hour that i do which be pretty good it's a pretty sweet job
S0199	come on go on and put the toy away now because we need to make a move darling
S0191	okay okay
S0193	so you've you've earn eighteen quid
S0192	yeah it's like the perfect job for me and while i'm while i'm study i don't have to go for a job interview and teach be quite stressful although i'm only teach you know fifteen hours a week i have to do another ten fifteen hours of plan
S0199	you might pick up some proofread as well
S0192	yeah i plan on do some proofread i'm go to sell all my cds and all that kind of stuff and just try and make any extra money i can on the side i might do this project for a couple of months and then they turn around and say we've get enough we don't need you to do it any more
S0193	mm
S0192	so i'm just go to try and get as much as i can while i can really
S0193	i'm sure you'll pick up if it's something easy down in as well
S0192	yeah i mean there's plenty of language school around there but i didn't want to be teach this degree be go to be pretty full on so teaching's stressful let's say i just do ten hours teach
S0199	but to sit there and have a conversation with your mat or whatever it's
S0192	yeah and once i sign the once i get your consent form i don't have to do it again every time i record you again i can just use that same consent form so
S0193	mm
S0192	it's pretty useful i may be able to get work transcribe it because they're go to have people listen to this phonologists and write it in a completely different alphabet the one i be talk to you about
S0193	mm
S0192	so they'll be listen to what we're say and write it out in a completely different alphabet exactly how it sound not the word but just the sound of the language i don't have as much train as i need in phonology to be able to do that but i'm get there so within another couple of months if this be go well i might approach them and say hey you know do you want me to try and transcribe this
