S0687	i can't though can i haven't get internet
S0689	what
S0690	she want to know sort of do she or
S0688	no i be just gonna say but he say he didn't all these erm grape the vineyards have all pick exactly the same variety don't they
S0687	no idea how you'd tell
S0690	i dunno how you'd tell the difference really
S0688	well they look the same though don't they they haven't get a different shape leaf or i saw a picture of a man erm sit and he be push something between the line of tree and i
S0687	yeah most
S0689	what be it like
S0687	most often now it's like a little motorise car thing and it and it electronically cut the grapes off the vine doesn't it
S0690	i dunno
S0688	he be
S0687	yeah
S0689	i doubt it's electronically i dunno
S0687	no it be honestly there's
S0689	so it cut the grape with electricity that doesn't really make
S0687	no
S0688	no
S0687	no no an electronic car thing
S0689	oh
S0687	a machine that drive at like
S0689	sorry i right i i understand
S0687	in between the vines
S0689	oh i think you be say
S0687	like i be say it's not a person who do it on like large scale produce
S0689	oh i think you mean it be like electricity that cut it and i be like
S0688	i mean these must be small scale producers mustn't they
S0687	i would have think so it might be like a franchise you know whoever sell their grapes to sort of a bigger producer
S0688	well they're probably they're obviously
S0688	i be gonna say like er they're probably cheaper win aren't they
S0687	er yeah i would have think so
S0688	i don't understand
S0687	although i don't know
S0689	how what work wine production
S0688	i be just say these must all be small producers but say maybe they just sell it to
S0687	like a bigger producer
S0689	possibly or they just
S0688	i think they make it here
S0687	yeah i do but i'm say they might sell it to like or you know one of the bigger
S0688	oh okay
S0687	do you see what i mean
S0688	yeah
S0689	either that or they just make their own wine for their own consumption
S0688	well some people do that cos i remember a guy from a restaurant in say that he'd travel around italy erm sample the win and buy just like from the box here there and everywhere for his
S0687	for himself
S0688	for the restaurant i wonder if he just retire or cos it just close down didn't it
S0687	what
S0688	the restaurant
S0687	which restaurant
S0687	where's that
S0689	isn't that isn't that a franchise
S0688	er
S0689	i be about to say harry
S0688	in
S0689	harry ramsden's a fish and chip shop
S0687	oh you and dad go there didn't you i've not be be that where you and dad go
S0688	yeah
S0687	up the road
S0688	well i've be there once with
S0690	have we
S0689	i be just
S0688	you know one thing
S0689	i be gonna say if you if you felt it be your time and you and you and you think you might sell the business or
S0688	i know that's what i mean but it definitely just close
S0687	careful shine a light he be go fast
S0688	we weren't very far over to be fair i'm a bite peckish
S0687	yeah
S0689	i keep think that that town would make a great you know like an establish shoot like at the start of a film where
S0688	yeah
S0689	i'm sure it's be use you know if you get if you get one of them like drone you know you can get like you know what i mean don't you
S0688	i do well i didn't understand how well those drone work that one that 's brother have it's fab
S0689	exactly if that's only a couple of hundred quid imagine what like a thousand pound one do or two thousand
S0688	well i don't know how much he pay for it she say she think he'd buy a good one although all his camera equipment and stuff's good
S0687	i tell you when erm when i be in america we go to erm the un one of the things oh no it be i think it be one of the things that they be debate at congress or something like that be
S0689	oh they've get really
S0687	they want to
S0689	oh sorry
S0687	they want to use erm drone for erm like commercial purpose so like amazon want to deliver
S0689	yeah
S0687	parcel use drone
S0689	do you not remember me show you that video mum i remember you show me that video there be there be a video that amazon release like last year i think and it be like an advert and like basically the the this thing be that the dog have eat one of this lad's football boot and it be say that like you can have new football boot deliver like within the hour basically you put like this big like it look like a qr code in your garden and the drone like catch onto that land drop your parcel on the qr code then fly back
S0687	mm
S0689	i'm sure i've show you the video
S0688	but er from how far away
S0689	like it be like a local depot thing i don't know but they be just trialling it then but yeah
S0687	i don't think they've get approval for it in a lot of countries cos it's
S0689	yeah
S0688	would be misuse
S0687	well yeah absolutely there's issue about like privacy and people don't er at the moment the law be that you can't fly a drone within so many metres of a residence because there's cameras on them and it's like an invasion of your privacy
S0689	i be just about to say there's
S0688	but not only that it's
S0687	yeah
S0687	and there's problems about like their be in airspace as well affect because like
S0688	aeroplanes
S0687	proper ones could go quite high and them affect aeroplanes and things
S0688	i think that vineyard must have be quite young cos it be all like one stick there be no branch
S0687	yeah
S0688	come off the tree that's the
S0689	i wonder why like in in the word vineyard and other things there's like silent letter why be there
S0687	sorry
S0689	do you know in certain word there's like silent letter
S0687	yeah
S0689	why be that
S0687	usually historically it be pronounce so like the you know in which where it's w h i c h
S0689	yeah
S0687	traditionally that would have be pronounce like which with a
S0689	hang about which
S0687	which
S0689	do you mean like witch on a broomstick or which
S0687	as in no no no as in
S0689	right
S0687	which book would you like to read
S0689	yeah
S0687	traditionally that it would have be pronounce with a ha
S0689	right
S0687	so and then the pronunciation over time have change but the orthography the spell hasn't be update
S0689	right
S0688	but what about an e on the end
S0687	like erm
S0688	vine
S0687	like vine erm i'm not a hundred percent sure about that to be honest different spell systems
S0688	i think
S0687	do things in different ways like spanish be very straightforward like how you see it be how you say it and then
S0690	there's no there's so there's no erm non non wordies non letter
S0687	sorry
S0690	silent letter
S0689	do you mean silent letter yeah
S0687	yeah no
S0690	which be why they say it's an easier language to learn they say that's why ours be so it's difficult to learn
S0688	i think an e on the end change the i like
S0687	yeah from fin to fine
S0688	yeah
S0687	yeah yeah so there'd have be like a need to distinguish between fin write down and fine so i'm guess but
S0688	do you see a sign this way
S0690	no i check on the map just cut that corner
S0687	it's really interest erm if you search on youtube listen to like erm old english medieval english and you would not honestly it's a completely different language you wouldn't understand it
S0689	well it's like ye old and all that isn't it they use to say like ye
S0687	oh older than that
S0689	oh right
S0687	i'm talk like old english you you just can't understand it at all but it use to be the case that like before like probably the sixteen hundreds like someone from cumbria wouldn't understand someone from the south it would be different languages
S0689	really
S0687	completely yeah
S0688	whereas now it's just the
S0687	because the dialects
S0688	different accent
S0687	because yeah because the dialect be so different because people didn't have any contact with people from southern england and
S0689	right
S0687	and as well
S0689	and i
S0687	things like caxton's like the introduction of dictionaries like
S0689	mm
S0687	stabilise spell cos before that everyone spell in spell the same word in different ways because there be no kind of standard and that and people the creation of dictionaries they call it the standardisation of english create a more standard pronunciation so like and that tend to be southern british english which be why that's become like the standard english that kind of you know be see as normal
S0689	yeah
S0687	and other accent be see as deviant from that
S0689	just go back to what you previous say about how we're all the same now it's not really true be it cos
S0687	no but we're
S0689	i mean i remember
S0687	but but you can
S0689	yeah we're a lot better
S0687	you can understand someone from
S0689	yeah
S0687	you know somewhere else
S0689	i know but we still have word like i'm try to think like like be tell me a while back he go to see his family in newcastle and they be say like all these like word and he didn't understand them and i'm try to remember what one be now
S0687	yeah there's quite a lot of erm word like that
S0688	local
S0687	yeah they're like dialect word
S0688	it's like things like brew
S0687	yeah
S0688	that's what they be say about the spanish nurse that they've bring across erm
S0687	they didn't understand things like that
S0688	they didn't they didn't understand you know if a patient say can i have a brew or
S0687	yeah
S0687	idioms as well people learn foreign languages really struggle to understand idioms because you can't understand the mean of it from look at the mean of the part
S0689	what's an idiom
S0687	an idiom be anything where the mean of the whole isn't constitute of the mean of the part so like like
S0689	in english please
S0687	so like give me an example of an idiom
S0689	i don't know
S0688	i don't know what an idiom be
S0687	like you're the dog's dinner
S0689	oh
S0687	things like that
S0689	right
S0687	doesn't literally mean you be the dog's dinner we're gonna fee you to the dog so that's very difficult for someone learn english to understand because they think what could that possibly mean you have to just know what that mean by like someone tell you or
S0688	but it's not just in english that that happen be it
S0687	no no there's idioms in every language and that's what's really difficult to master once you've learn the language of like to be really fluent you have to master all the idioms
S0689	so be like up the apples and pears an idiom or not
S0687	exactly yeah
S0689	right
S0687	and like you'd be surprise how much of language be idiomatic
S0690	so will in a hundred years there be fewer languages will everybody gravitate towards english and spanish
S0687	language it's
S0690	chinese
S0687	in the last hundred years there's be like mass erm language death in place like well in the past kind of couple of hundred years since we've start since globalisation start really you know like tribes in
S0689	indonesia yeah
S0687	peru and africa who
S0688	have their own language
S0687	who each each individual tribe of like fifty people would have their own language but now it's like there's there's more of a there's a there's a not a desire but there's there's benefit like for example in like erm papua new guinea there's there's still lot of individual languages but a lot of them be die out because people view like spanish or english or like the the national language rather than their tribal language be view like with a prestige with higher education higher social class so that's kind of influence people to move towards that rather than erm like maintain their own local
S0688	which be a shame isn't it
S0687	and as well things like trade as well erm you know opportunities to work outside the village or trade your fish outside the village you need a language that you can communicate with other people so that that's like more erm what's the word like
S0687	erm no more erm motivation to drop your own individual language and acquire
S0690	so be there any examples of big languages you know not just a villagey language a sort of state or even a country language that be die out as a result of globalisation
S0687	erm i'm not sure about a like a national language really erm
S0688	be you
S0687	it's more it's it it it's more languages with like very small number of speakers that die out
S0690	but by the same logic do you think in time it will gravitate towards big languages drop out
S0687	mm i don't know really it's like i mean at the minute the most widely speak language be erm
S0688	english
S0687	it's no it's spanish
S0688	be it
S0687	spanish and then no i think it's either erm mandarin
S0689	i be about to say chinese'll be the
S0687	well the
S0689	biggest one won't it
S0687	yeah the top the top three be either mandarin or cantonese i'm not sure which one be speak by more spanish and then english erm
S0688	can i have a sweet
S0689	er yeah
S0687	but no i i i don't know about national languages
S0689	no they're not
S0688	well that's just by the sheer er number of people that be there you know isn't it it's not
S0687	yeah but if you look at southern erm south america there be there would have be like thousands and thousands of tribal languages erm but most of them a lot of them be erm move towards whatever dialect of spanish it be in that you know brazilian or or erm peruvian or
S0688	i mean the mandarin or chinese it's just because of the countries the people that be there be it's not quite widespread across the world across the world english be probably
S0687	mm well chinese be speak by the most people erm
S0690	but will english by number of territories then be that
S0687	well yeah and like you know things like in i don't know when it first start but send you know missionaries over to underdevelop you know barbaric countries to modernise them and teach them english and convert them to christianity and all that rubbish
S0688	still a few that
S0687	yeah eat
S0688	yeah some be cannibals
S0687	do they
S0688	yeah
S0689	i be about to say you know there be some pretty people
S0688	oh that's sweet look at that little church
S0689	i saw on facebook today there'd be a quote from an icelandic player and erm he be say cos you know iceland's such a small country
S0687	mm
S0689	he be say that he one of the ways that say i could i could notice and like and i i know like i know of about thirty percent of the crowd

S0687	to the right here dad
S0689	i've cut my finger and i don't know how
S0687	mm
S0689	i've cut my finger and i don't know how
S0688	like a paper
S0689	oh that be i'm just curious about all your opinion but what do you think the way forward be for like the energy wise
S0687	that's a big question
S0688	well do i tell you the hospital have find a water source bury underneath and
S0687	like a
S0688	mm a reservoir he say erm
S0689	who tell you this
S0688	the guy who i can't remember what his title be erm something to do with operations they've find this water source so they're gonna by two thousand and
S0687	just open that
S0688	and eighteen
S0688	we'll be self sufficient for water and energy
S0687	heat isn't it
S0688	yeah
S0689	that's really good
S0688	uhu
S0689	what be they do they're like so hydropower or
S0688	they'll have to treat the water
S0689	yeah i understand that but how be you gonna get energy from the reservoir
S0688	there you're put erm
S0687	you're put turbines down
S0688	solar panel and some kind of energy
S0689	think about it solar panel in a reservoir
S0688	no we're gonna have our own water source and energy for heat and electricity
S0689	yeah i understand that but how where be you gonna get this energy from
S0688	that's what i'm say they're gonna use solar panel and some other it's a really new machine that convert
S0687	i imagine they'll pump the water through a
S0689	yeah and then
S0687	a turbine
S0689	a turbine yeah
S0687	and then use the solar power to heat it
S0688	thank you
S0689	i must say i think that nuclear be the way forward but
S0687	what be
S0688	nuclear
S0689	nuclear
S0689	renewable energy source aren't gonna be able to sustain our need by themselves
S0687	well they be if we reduce our need
S0689	eh
S0687	they be if we if we reduce our need
S0689	yeah well we're not
S0688	it's not a good argument be it
S0687	what
S0688	say well we're not so
S0687	yeah
S0689	we're not though
S0687	we're not when you leave every light on in the house
S0689	be you prepare to have short be you prepare to not watch telly at certain time of the day or
S0687	we don't watch telly anyway
S0689	but that's what i'm say you you're never gonna get a populous to agree with that so
S0688	i think the idea be be not to put all your egg in one basket isn't it
S0687	mm
S0688	an idiom
S0687	exactly can we have the crisp please
S0689	the amount of energy that nuclear power produce and if it's control
S0687	yeah but what happen if something go wrong and that's the uk go
S0689	that's why it have to be control
S0687	that's why it have to be control yes but there's always human error isn't there
S0689	not if you have multiple fall back options
S0688	look at chernobyl
S0689	look at chernobyl cos they be in mum they be right chernobyl be under ussr control and didn't control it properly
S0688	but it be in the ukraine wasn't it
S0689	under ussr control
S0688	yeah didn't didn't plant it in their own backyard do they
S0689	nobody would nobody
S0687	the point be there's always human error and sooner or later something would go wrong and there would be mass devastation
S0689	that's why when be the last time a nuclear power when be the last time a serious nuclear power station like explosion happen
S0688	chernobyl
S0687	tell me it happen a couple of years ago in cumbria there be an accident and it be all hush hush
S0689	yeah it it wasn't major though
S0688	be there
S0687	yeah cos one of the modules 's do this year be like the history of nuclear power how it all start and what's happen now and there as er also when we be in the un build there be this chart of how many nuclear bomb test each country have do since chernobyl and it's absolutely amaze there's thousands each the uk be one of the worst uk russia and america have do thousands of nuclear bomb test since chernobyl
S0688	where
S0687	where
S0689	there's be
S0688	what's that do to the atmosphere
S0687	exactly
S0688	but it's all secret
S0687	oh that be it there be something say how many as well as that there be something say how many nuclear
S0687	how many nuclear
S0688	bless you
S0687	bomb test will have be do today so far and there be like something like thirty each day i don't know how they know that these crisp be nice
S0688	they be
S0689	i i dunno i think you're what'll happen be if we don't if if we don't have a nuclear arsenal then you know and north korea come knock on our door
S0687	exactly but that's what every country say isn't it
S0689	yeah but i think i'm not try to be rude but i think the way you two think be like we should all get on happily and let's hold hand and dance around a circle chant but it's not gonna happen be it
S0688	you're be silly now
S0689	right i do say i'm be silly
S0688	well there's nothing wrong with live peaceably and work towards korea disarm themselves
S0689	but mum korea's never gonna disarm itself you know it's it's you know it's a bite that really because you're vote for a bloke who want to get rid of trident which put us at a complete disadvantage
S0687	do you know how much trident cost us a year
S0689	yes but it's worth it
S0687	really
S0689	yes absolutely if we ever come under attack and we didn't have trident what would we do
S0687	if we come under attack there'd be nothing we could do about it they drop a nuclear bomb and millions of people would be dead so how do it make it any better for us to do the same to that country how do that resolve anything
S0689	so you're say if we if we er
S0687	if someone drop a bomb on us how do it make anything better if we do the same to them
S0689	so you're say if if a nuclear bomb get drop on our house and we all die you wouldn't want anything to happen
S0687	yeah
S0689	to the perpetrator
S0687	what difference would it make we'd be dead
S0689	but you you wouldn't want anything else to happen to the perpetrator
S0687	i will not say i wouldn't want anything to happen to the perpetrator but drop a nuclear bomb on thousands of innocent people have nothing to do with the perpetrator
S0689	so you're say that if kim jong un bomb right and we somehow survive you wouldn't want any you wouldn't now want either of them to bomb them
S0687	not the people no they could get him but drop a nuclear bomb damage so many people and organisms and bio systems for years and years to come
S0688	we really have to work hard at preserve what we have cos you know for future generations
S0689	so if we're go if we're go off that thing do you not think we should have an army
S0687	of course we have to protect ourselves but i think you're be very lighthearted about something that could literally wipe out the world
S0689	i be aware of that
S0687	if a nuclear if a proper nuclear war start it would like it would threaten the world
S0689	okay i understand that but what i'm say be so you think we shouldn't have trident at all
S0687	i don't know it's such a complex issue what i'm say be i know that it cost trillions and trillions of pound each year to maintain and that money could be well spend elsewhere i mean have we ever use it and would we ever
S0689	no
S0687	want to use it
S0689	but we have to keep it there just in case
S0688	i think i think i agree with both of you you need a deterrent but i'm not sure it be it work in that way that it be a deterrent
S0689	so right if if we have a nuclear bomb just say say we do back in world war two and we know that if we drop it on we could kill hitler
S0687	mm
S0689	or it may kill other people would you drop the bomb
S0687	i don't know
S0688	you see the thing be you could draw a parallel with erm saddam hussein
S0687	well yeah i be gonna say
S0688	we get rid of him and look what look what come of that
S0687	and look at like you know we're use drone attack now aren't we to kill people like you know people that be high up on the hit list
S0688	the leaders of isis
S0687	yeah exactly but you know there's there's always collateral damage
S0688	and there's always people ready to take their place isn't there
S0687	exactly there's always another nutter ready to step up you know so it be like literally it be like cut off the head it grow another head and come back angrier and more vengeance with more vengeance against the rest of the world
S0689	well then what else be you gonna do just let it let it
S0687	it's change it's educate and change ideologies to to make like real societal change you have to educate people
S0689	alright i agree with that but you be never ever gonna bring
S0688	oh
S0689	an isis loon to not believe that his action be stupid there's no way
S0687	absolutely not but there's always a reason why people like that have so much hatred against us and america against the against the west there's always reason people don't just wake up with a hatred there's always reason behind it
S0689	yeah exactly but it's be drill into them so you know what be our other option let's er
S0687	well
S0689	educate and let's send a load of you know let's send a load of
S0688	yeah i don't know whether i always i don't know whether i agree with that sorry to interrupt you erm they want complete control they don't want women to be educate
S0687	exactly
S0688	it's about control isn't it
S0687	uhu
S0688	oh wow
S0689	but then at the same time could you not argue that's
S0687	we're quite high up
S0689	that's the culture of certain countries
S0687	uhu
S0689	so i mean what can you do for that you can't educate them can you because you know
S0687	i know it's very difficult but i just don't know if like mum say more violence or retaliation against them doesn't make them go alright we'll stop then it make them worse and
S0688	it kind of justify them and mean
S0687	it it it just exacerbate the situation
S0688	i hear erm i hear someone on the radio say if donald trump get into power that'll be that's what isis want because he play right into their hand he justify
