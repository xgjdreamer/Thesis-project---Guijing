S0235	i have no idea if they think like a friend of us look at the computer and he just think that there might have just be a glitch so i save everything like on my hard drive and then on an external hard drive
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah

S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah it's probably better but when i have a friend look at it he ask me if i'd email it to myself and i open it up with the email because apparently if you do well so if you email your document to yourself and then you open it up from an email and carry on type apparently that can cause it to just disappear
S0192	there's all sort of glitches on computers aren't there

S0235	vagina awesome
S0198	yeah terrible
S0192	we we've consider adopt i think we we mainly think the best thing would be to adopt like an eighteen year old just before they go to uni
S0235	like seventeen and a half right
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	pay for uni and then come to an agreement that when we're old they would look after us
S0236	mm
S0235	that sound wise
S0192	yeah
S0235	i like the idea of adoption
S0192	mm
S0235	but it's a real pain in the ass
S0198	to get the
S0235	but there be i be read about it not long ago and they be say that they're gonna change all the regulations and stuff now because they've get so many children
S0198	to make it easier
S0235	yeah to make it easier
S0198	yeah
S0235	for people to adopt because the process be like two two and a half years at the moment
S0192	mm
S0235	to adopt a child
S0198	that's ridiculous
S0192	why
S0236	mm
S0235	because they just
S0198	i think that for some
S0192	they have to evaluate you for two and a half years
S0235	yeah they and they go it's crazy this be this be what would be problematic if we and decide to adopt they interview your families
S0198	oh
S0192	oh no
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	i don't think your families get nothing to do with you do you know what i mean
S0235	yeah i know exactly
S0192	mm
S0235	but yeah they have they interview all your family
S0198	all of your kid and between your two families now and
S0235	yeah

S0198	we actually get exactly the same grade we both get sixty seven point five
S0192	really exactly the same sixty seven point four yeah sixty seven point four
S0235	er do they not write
S0198	and then we get completely different grade
S0235	oh they round it down
S0192	so it's just sixty seven
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	but i mean i be like i be teach english we be study japanese
S0198	oh yeah like sixty eight
S0192	we be busy with other stuff
S0235	yeah
S0192	so i kinda tell myself maybe i could've do better
S0198	i mean that's fine for an undergrad
S0235	yeah the thing be with an undergrad anyway you don't really pay too much attention do you it's just
S0192	no
S0198	no no no
S0235	you just try to
S0192	i want to do it
S0198	no exactly
S0235	no no
S0235	but then as have get like a third and she's do her master
S0192	it do limit you you know
S0198	yeah that's true

S0198	yeah i have an irish teacher
S0192	what slap a turd on your desk
S0198	when i be beginner he's like you can get a first or a second but you don't want a turd no i want some turd and i know he must say every year to like
S0192	mine be
S0198	to like freshmen every year you know and he do it with the straightest of face you don't want a third no one like turds
S0192	well two two's a drinker's degree isn't it a third be just what happen
S0198	yeah i know i know
S0192	i just get a third
S0235	a third one be do you know where your uni be
S0192	yeah yeah
S0198	exactly
S0235	that's the first question
S0192	you remember your student name right i think that's six digits
S0198	cos i remember i be i mean the first year i just scrap pass but that thankfully doesn't count
S0235	yeah

S0236	everyone's quite
S0235	yeah
S0236	and i as soon as i find out you need forty
S0198	yeah
S0236	or a or a forty one
S0192	the truth though
S0198	yeah yeah it look bad on your transcripts
S0236	cos if you if you want a they take into account the first few
S0198	mm
S0192	yeah
S0236	grade
S0192	and also for us like
S0198	oh that's true yeah
S0192	abroad
S0198	take it after us
S0192	they don't really care so much about the degree they wanna see our transcripts they wanna see what
S0198	yeah it's true
S0235	yeah
S0192	modules we do and what grade we get so
S0236	mm
S0192	actually it do kind of matter because it show
S0236	mm
S0198	yeah

S0235	yeah i know that's quite new in england a forty's very high
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	but that's another problem
S0192	that's another problem as well
S0198	yeah because actually
S0192	they're like you only get a sixty seven that's terrible you know
S0235	yeah
S0192	cos americans will get like ninety fives

S0198	no one get near a hundred
S0235	no
S0236	and they kick you straightaway
S0235	but when erm yeah like

S0236	and then they have three more
S0192	exceptional
S0236	yeah

S0235	think think of someone specific
S0192	just think of someone in particular

S0198	yeah he say that to me that's frighten i mean actually it's kind of good for the baby for her
S0235	yeah
S0192	yeah for her but i mean if you don't want children have the menopause isn't gonna
S0198	but if you haven't have kid yet and you're consider it

S0192	we've just enough to carry us through
S0198	if we can keep record
S0192	we've get enough money to like pay bill pay for food get to uni and back for the whole year
S0235	yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	but like we wanna come and see you guy and and go to other place we need some spare cash
S0198	yeah we would like to walk to a pub or do anything
S0192	and this thing pay about eighteen pound an hour which be
S0235	wow that's good
S0236	pretty good yeah
S0192	but it's actually quite difficult to record people
S0236	mm
S0192	you guy be like sound but like
S0235	can you not will you be able to take it to uni
S0198	yeah maybe
S0235	record your classmates
S0236	just take a
S0198	well no i don't know if it have to be conversations not er
S0192	you need
S0235	but it could be seminars
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	it can't be lecturers seminars i wonder about this but you do need
S0235	yeah
S0198	but we have to get as long as we get permission it's okay
S0192	you do need write permission from everyone we're gonna give you the form in a bite it's like a two page form that you have to fill out
S0235	yeah
S0192	but provide once i've get everyone's permission in a class then i can just record every class
S0235	you keep do it yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	if i want to
S0236	yeah
S0198	yeah that might be as long as people be will they might be will
S0192	mm
S0235	also you can just go like go to the like the the group study area in the library and just like go and
S0198	yeah
S0192	attack someone yeah
S0235	stand near someone hey friend
S0192	i've be through linguistics recently
S0236	yeah
S0198	would you like to do
S0235	would you tell me about what have you be do
S0198	in the school
S0192	as long as it's something in our field be what be like cambridge university press so
S0235	yeah well it's like diaries
S0198	legit i mean it be legit but
S0192	a bite lucky the problem be just make the hours i think i work out that we need an extra fifty quid a week each i think on top of what we've get to survive and this be if we get twenty hours twenty five hours a month we just hand them twenty hours and we get another like twelve hours so
S0235	you know what be like look at like be say like bar work and stuff as well
S0198	yeah like that's also an option
S0192	yeah
S0235	just you like an even
S0192	definitely
S0236	it's also kind of at the uni as well cos your master know like er with the
S0235	yeah you have to have tutorials
S0236	they only employ master students stuff like that
S0235	they
S0198	oh really
S0236	because you know it's just type
S0192	well we'll look into that
S0198	oh really
S0235	yeah
S0192	we definitely
S0198	oh that's fantastic
S0235	yeah
S0198	cos that's just one off stuff
S0236	it's a more open job
S0198	just to earn you a bite more money
S0235	yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	they be good things to do
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean we could teach in i google like english language school and they're like forty
S0235	yeah there're so many
S0192	like here or something so i think we could get some i don't know if they hire us part time but i think maybe we could get some hours fail that i might put some posters up for like private tuition or
S0235	yeah
S0192	proofread or something like that
S0235	i be gonna say like your proofread and like copy proof and that stuff
S0192	mm
S0235	would probably be
S0192	we be proofread like
S0235	just
S0192	in our last job like phds theses and stuff
S0236	mm
S0192	but that be terrible
S0198	yeah
S0235	because they're
S0198	because they have to produce them in english
S0192	the standard in korea i don't know how it's like you know
S0198	ah i don't think it's the same standard
S0192	no it's not the same standard at all
S0198	it's terrible
S0192	well i mean fair play to them they're produce a a phd thesis in a foreign language
S0198	that's true
S0192	that's really impressive
S0235	it be impressive
S0192	but the content of what they be write be so repetitive i mean we probably get pay they split a thesis between four people and we be two of the people and we probably get a hundred pound each i think for do maybe we do like twenty page each or thirty page each something like that
S0235	i guess that's not too bad
S0192	no the money be okay it be like it be about three pound a page or something like that maybe i can't remember exactly how much it be and which you can get pretty quick if you go through depend on how it be like sometimes
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah they be quite
S0192	it's really hard what be she try to say

S0235	you have like one meet a month it be like three four grand a year i suppose or something like that
S0192	it doesn't cost so much
S0198	yeah
S0192	but you can get complete fund
S0235	which isane yeah you can
S0198	yeah you can try to get scholarships and things
S0235	yeah because
S0198	then they want specific phds
S0192	we be we be consider
S0235	usually yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	if we do a phd which we'd like to do then we're try to do it we'd consider do it in like america or canada or something so that a we can get a foot in the door
S0236	mm
S0192	to potentially get dual citizenship somewhere else and then b there's a lot more fund for foreign students
S0235	yeah
S0192	than there be for
S0235	generally be you're a foreign student there be a lot more fund
S0235	in england as well
S0236	mm
S0235	like
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah it's depress like i go in the er they've get all these like things and we don't you know we can't go for any of them

S0198	do you get a discount for be a student
S0235	yeah i do
S0192	like a grand or something
S0235	before it be different though because i what they do be they offer a they offer like a a bigger discount if you just go straight through
S0198	yeah straight though yeah
S0235	so you finish your mba or whatever you do and then you go straight into your ma but because i come under a alumni i think i get like ten percent off
S0198	okay
S0192	mm
S0235	something like that
S0192	fair enough
S0235	it's better than a kick in the teeth
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	and my tuition fee
S0235	weren't bad either like 's tuition fee
S0192	yeah
S0235	be like

S0235	yeah
S0198	but we yeah we go to but they put theirs up to eight
S0192	we apply eight it go up to eight
S0198	and we think the cost of and also like once we're actually in edinburgh we be like ah slightly defeat the object of be in england
S0192	brand new
S0198	cos no one's gonna visit you in edinburgh i mean maybe once in the year
S0192	yeah this be a good a really good location
S0198	but they're not gonna
S0192	people would come and visit us which be what we want
S0198	yes
S0235	yeah
S0192	we'll be back for a year
S0198	yeah
S0192	but we're not i think we're gonna move on after that so that's kind of and career's abroad
S0198	that's gonna
S0192	and also once you've kinda live out of england you start to price yourself out of the market a little bite
S0236	mm
S0192	you come back and you're like a pint in a pub be five pound
S0235	yeah it be
S0198	on a bad day
S0192	i be just in cambodia where a pint be fifty cents
S0198	mm
S0192	it's just like thirty p you're like thirty p five quid i think i'll drink at home
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah i think that's normal though like everything have go up quite significantly
S0198	yeah
S0235	in the past few years as well like
S0198	it have in the last few years it's quite a lot
S0236	yeah
S0198	you're
S0192	but
S0235	crazy enough
S0192	we've be impress by how the price of food i guess cos of how much we be pay in korea but like
S0198	yeah
S0192	all the food's cheaper here than it be in korea
S0198	yeah food isn't cheap supermarkets aren't that cheap in korea
S0235	yeah
S0192	everything else be cheaper in korea
S0235	yeah
S0192	but food be not cheap
S0198	especially stuff that we wouldn't buy
S0235	yeah
S0192	like a bag of potatoes would be like four pound or something like that
S0198	yeah
S0192	it be like one carrot be two pound fifty
S0198	yeah yeah stuff fluctuate there a lot with like season and stuff like that
S0235	yeah that make sense
S0198	they do it
S0235	but like if you get
S0192	like if you buy
S0235	and you learn to buy the season
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0235	then things will be cheaper
S0198	there be things that
S0192	we have to do seasonal in korea
S0198	although some things that be all year round and they be obviously import cos they be
S0192	yeah
S0198	they weren't grow bananas
S0192	but then be a lot of
S0198	but they would fluctuate
S0235	yeah
S0198	one week they would be like three pound and
S0192	it's like the very same come
S0198	the next week they would literally be seven pound for a bunch of bananas and then the next week it would be down again like you feel like the supermarket just keep do what they want to make more profit and
S0192	watermelons they get like in england they're about that big aren't they for like er one
S0236	mm
S0235	like this big
S0236	oh yeah you get much more
S0198	yeah you can get bigger ones yeah yeah
S0192	i haven't see bigger ones since i've be back but then you get them in korea we get ones like that they're huge ones
S0235	wow
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean they're like ten kilos or something
S0198	in season yeah
S0192	and when they're in season they're like three pound two pound fifty for like a big one it last us a solid week no worry we've eat as much watermelon as we want everyday
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	but out of season that same watermelon would be like fifteen pound twenty pound for the watermelon it go up to like thirty thousand wons thirty five thousand wons
S0198	yeah it be hard to predict what your bill be gonna cost each week
S0192	yeah
S0198	whereas here it's consistent we just know
S0192	it's consistent
S0235	yeah we
S0198	we buy the same things and like
S0235	yeah and you don't really
S0198	sometimes strawberries will get cheaper in the summer and that's good but
S0235	yeah i think that's the one good thing about british supermarkets be you're gonna be pay like the maximum price and the only way it'll go be down
S0198	down yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	it tend to be and it
S0198	and it do yeah yeah yeah
S0235	happen every january
S0198	and there's a lot of as well
S0192	i've be impress by that
S0235	oh yeah
S0198	and supermarkets
S0192	we be get you know most of the week shop for like twenty five pound i reckon maybe we spend thirty to thirty five pound for the two of us for the most of a week's shop
S0235	yeah that's pretty good
S0192	yeah
S0235	you need to go to like lidl
S0235	be you go to lidl
S0198	yeah we've be go to aldi
S0192	aldi yeah

S0236	i think there're less staff as well
S0235	customer because
S0236	cos there're never all the till open
S0235	yeah they never have they
S0198	yeah yeah
S0236	they they always have the minimum amount of staff they need

S0192	it doesn't matter how busy it be you always queue for the same time
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	if there's like five people in there there's only one person on so you still queue for the same time
S0235	yeah
S0198	for the same amount of time yeah that's annoy
S0235	but yeah they do pay really well actually
S0198	what's the minimum wage now

S0235	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0235	kind of yeah
S0198	we haven't have any bill through yet
S0192	no we have a problem korea that we couldn't just go to one supermarket could we they're all in different directions and like everyone stock different things you can't find cheese at that one and you can't find pasta in that one so it be
S0235	oh right

S0198	yeah we never know what the term mean
S0192	i go to america i think some guy be try to insult me and he be like you're a hipster i be what
S0235	yeah like i guess i would kind if someone call me a hipster i think i would consider it quite a derogatory term
S0198	yeah yeah i think
S0192	i think he he end up call me a hipster pin up cos i think he realise that i actually have no idea what a hipster actually be and therefore be actually a hipster without try to be a hipster

S0198	we didn't know before we get to south america we haven't hear hipster before
S0236	mm

S0198	oh yeah yeah just people try hard
S0236	no no i'm never quite
S0192	if if a hipster be a a bite of a hippie that doesn't buy clothe but it's still a bite more in i guess maybe
S0235	yeah i'm not sure cos i always think a hipster be one of those people that
S0198	that burden
S0192	a bite geeky nerdy
S0235	no i guess like someone who like purposely like things that they know everyone else hat

S0236	like the jargon and
S0235	like everything's there
S0198	language go on
S0235	yeah that somehow

S0198	's bedroom rubbish bag
S0192	from the one time that he clean his fuck room

S0192	they could've steal the toilet bag or something you could've find like tampon and shit you know what i mean
S0198	or the kitchen's just
S0235	yeah that's pretty yeah
S0198	i mean that's fine but
S0192	yeah really
S0198	it be specific 's
S0192	it be just 's i think there be like shotty bottle beer can condoms and
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	then like a big poster of dinosaurs or something
S0192	something like
S0198	it be definitely 's
S0192	yeah something really random
S0198	you end up with some random stuff at uni though
S0236	mm
S0198	even when you choose who you live with which you do in the second and third year you move into house but jesus you still don't really know people that well
S0236	mm
S0192	do you enjoy your bachelor
S0236	yeah it be good yeah it be fun
S0198	mm good fun yeah yeah
S0192	i have good fun i feel not sorry for them it's not like pity but i feel like everyone should have that experience of live with your mat
S0236	mm
S0192	and be a bite carefree and that kind of stuff
S0198	yeah yeah it's definitely
S0192	i take it the ma's not the same kind of experience
S0236	no more work
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah a lot more work
S0192	we've do it for one year
S0198	be you take like i don't remember be nervous when i first go into my bachelor class and stuff but i'm gonna be like next week i'm gonna be
S0236	mm
S0198	genuinely very nervous
S0192	yeah do you think it'll be harder or easier do it in one year
S0236	er probably easier
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0236	cos obviously you'll have more work to do but then we be work which be why we've do it part time so we have
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	yeah
S0236	just the same workload anyway
S0198	just the amount of workload yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	i guess it depend on the hours
S0192	the problem be we're go into work and another addition for us be that we've just come home after years of live abroad so
S0236	mm
S0192	load of people wanna see us and visit us
S0236	mm
S0192	and all this kind of stuff so i think we've already get a pretty hectic schedule
S0198	just gotta keep on top of it
S0192	they give you a read list and i'm do four modules this semester and
S0236	mm
S0192	and each read list they give you like ten core book and then another twenty extra book
S0236	mm
S0192	you've get like thirty book per module
S0198	yeah
S0192	it be like a hundred and twenty book that i mean to read until before christmas
S0198	i feel that's surely they'll just focus you on some chapters
S0236	fuck off
S0192	we've already read all of those they're up there
S0198	yeah yeah yeah have we
S0192	yeah i've pretty much read all of those i haven't read your second language acquisition one
S0198	well i haven't read your book
S0192	yay
S0198	i always go for the skinny ones that one
S0192	it's expensive enough do it in one year i i suppose
S0236	mm
S0192	it's kind of cheaper do it in two years
S0198	maybe there
S0236	well
S0192	if we be live in england i'd probably do it part time but
S0236	yeah we didn't get any cos we think
S0235	yeah
S0236	we think that we weren't gonna get not have to pay council tax but then
S0235	yeah but that's the that's the main thing
S0198	yeah you do yeah yeah you have to be full time
S0236	cos you're not full time mm
S0235	yeah that be er but then i classify we both classify as full time in our second year
S0198	oh okay
S0192	oh why
S0235	cos you just have to be a and
S0236	cos we be do more hours or something
S0198	oh right
S0235	modules and because you're do your er your dissertation
S0198	dissertation
S0192	that count
S0235	and that count for me anyway it count as two erm my dissertation be the equivalent of like
S0198	two modules

S0192	which be the same as forty five american credit
S0235	oh really

S0235	it hurt your throat doesn't it
S0198	oh that one's weird try that
S0192	what's that
S0198	i feel like that's way better than the one that our friend have in korea but it do taste slightly stronger it's stronger oh that's actually quite
S0192	it's isn't it er
S0198	we have one that be bullshit ones in korea
S0236	what's the flavour
S0198	watermelon
S0192	watermelon
S0198	yeah
S0236	yeah that's the strongest one see you do get a little bite of a throat tingle off it
S0198	ah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah yeah
S0236	which be what
S0198	which be what we like
S0198	but they're different how much be the then
S0236	it's er
S0198	the instrument and then the disc be that vapour
S0236	yeah at first you you just buy the and you get the case and the charger and i think that's twenty quid and then the erm
S0198	oh yeah you can don't you
S0198	yeah
S0192	where's the other tea towel
S0198	in the wash machine
S0192	that suck
S0198	oh no you can still get it out
S0192	alright well
S0198	just don't wipe anything on there
S0236	the rest be like a fiver
S0198	oh okay and how long do that last
S0236	mm i don't know normally about a week or so if you
S0235	yeah it depend what you do like cos m do that before he give up smoke
S0198	mm
S0236	mm
S0235	but he be there like he use to smoke it literally all the time because you don't have to roll a cigarette it's just there
S0198	yeah i see yeah
S0236	it just go off you don't have to roll
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0235	yeah and you literally just like that whereas i
S0198	i think it could be like increase your nicotine level
S0235	well we be talk to
S0192	well there's
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	yeah yeah
S0235	so we be talk to about those
S0198	mm
S0235	i remember when we saw him on like new year's or christmas
S0236	mm
S0192	be he tell you about the dna marker or something like that
S0235	yeah
S0235	well he be say about how like they're start to these be almost all well can be just as bad if not worse for you than smoke
S0198	yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	but that's but because of the fact that you get social smokers who don't normally smoke all the time who just wanna give up the social smoke would start those and then end up smoke that
S0198	more than they would've do with roll cigarettes
S0235	more than they would've do
S0192	yeah
S0235	so and that's like so be very much a social smoker
S0236	mm
S0235	he would maybe have a cigarette and that be it but then when he be on that he would just smoke it continuously
S0198	continuously yeah
S0235	from like morning till night
S0198	yeah
S0235	and so that's why i'm try like i just don't touch it unless i'm drink
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	that's a good rule of thumb
S0198	it would make it replace what you're do with cigarettes at least
S0235	well i do yeah exactly i didn't smoke at all
S0198	you don't do it any more yeah
S0235	i haven't smoke i don't know
S0198	without alcohol
S0235	without alcohol for like four years something like that
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	so it would be
S0198	yeah i don't i can't do it every time you light a cigarette i'm like
S0192	i don't do it a lot by i do occasionally have a cigarette or stuff
S0235	there's only like a few occasion when i've be like wish i be drink
S0198	yeah
S0235	i just think i want to smoke and then maybe i'll pretend that i'm drink
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah
S0235	oh this lemonade er er er
S0192	this be the problem we be on cigarettes 'd be like let's have a beer then
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	we have like two
S0235	yeah you have to intensify it cos as i be say
S0192	we're gonna study
S0198	yeah
S0235	when you start sort of
S0198	we we be down in south america when we decide to quit we be like
S0192	oh
S0198	we're not gonna smoke unless we're drink but then it would be like twelve o'clock
S0235	oh
S0198	oh it's beer o'clock
S0192	yeah
S0198	i don't have to go to work today so there's nothing wrong with this
S0235	it's i think it's like
S0198	cos when we're drink it's like
S0235	a good kind of rule of thumb
S0198	yeah it's a good
S0235	to do because i think some people when they kind of be go on to the stag of quit smoke some would just be like i'll just have a cigarette in the morning or i'll just have a cigarette after dinner
S0198	yeah
S0235	or just have a cigarette before bed whereas if you just say oh i'll just have a cigarette when i'm when i'm drink
S0198	drink
S0235	or drink then you can kind of control that because you can say okay well i'm not gonna drink
S0198	drink yeah
S0235	and then i'm not
S0192	if i'm
S0198	in a social situation
S0235	you'll find you're not alcoholic yeah but you know as long as you can remove yourself from that situation you can't remove yourself from eat or wake up or go to sleep
S0198	no that's true
S0192	quite a few alchies in korea weren't there we live there be a lovely girl but i mean she would probably i would see that girl drink three bottle of red wine to herself
S0235	wow
S0192	three bottle of red wine
S0235	that's a challenge
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	she would she would on average get through fifteen to twenty bottle a week and i would be no worry she just
S0198	well she have a lot of people over as well all the time but
S0192	she do but the more we get to know her unfortunately korea's a really bad place if you're an alcoholic cos you you don't have that support network of your friends and family to kinda maybe help you out
S0236	mm
S0192	so you kinda just get a bite lose
S0198	or break
S0192	and people come and go so they don't know the full extent of how much you be an alcoholic you know what i mean
S0235	yeah
S0192	she have a really alcoholic friend we have like a gather we do a barbecue on the roof it be a and we get together with the office as well so we be a bunch of people so we be try to be a bite more you know the decorum be a bite you know it be
S0198	yeah it be we have a big we have a a few
S0192	one in the afternoon i'd have a beer but
S0198	christian ladies that work with us and stuff
S0192	yeah but he be he turn up down a bottle of champagne to himself a bottle of champagne down a bottle of wine to himself go off and shag some bird and like gather another three of those bottle of and then come and just vomit all over himself
S0198	it be a mess
S0235	oh my god
S0192	and just no he didn't vomit over himself
S0198	no no he pour chilli on himself
S0192	he be eat a bowl of chilli and he spill a tiny little bite and then he be like fuck it and just pour the bowl all over himself
S0192	and he be a wreck the guy be a wreck
S0235	oh my god
S0198	it be a mess i think he like know people around him know he be a mess
S0192	jesus yeah
S0198	yeah there're definitely some really terrible people that shouldn't be teach
S0192	no how do you guy get into teach
S0235	i mean that's like in england
S0198	yeah i guess it's the same for every job
S0192	every every free
S0235	that's worse in other job yeah
S0198	yeah
S0235	it's like i be say to a friend of mine who go into teach remember her dad give her such a hard time for go into teach and be like her dad be like some high flyer lawyer who be send his kid to like
S0198	oh
S0192	those can do those who can't teach
S0198	teach right
S0235	yeah and that's how he be
S0192	i hate that say
S0235	he always say to her and i be like that i believe that say it be it be true but not for the reason that people say it like it's easy to go into teach if you can't do what you wanna do and that's where the say come on it's not the say of like you know
S0198	that you're not good enough to do something else
S0235	you're not good enough to do anything else
S0198	yeah
S0192	mm some people actually want to teach
S0198	yeah
S0192	we need teachers
S0235	load of people that's why it be so terrible when i do my pgce because i
S0192	you've do your pgce
S0235	i do like the first take but then i be like no i'm alright
S0198	yeah yeah you do that
S0192	ah okay
S0235	i end up in like the boys grammar school
S0192	i've hear it's pretty intense
S0235	and it be fuck insane
S0198	oh do you where in
S0235	literally this be the fun well my last thing
S0192	be that a shit
S0235	it be really it be like a couple of hundred years old like three four hundred years old it's turn into an academy now and they be all expect to go to erm they be all expect to go to like cambridge oxford like the top ten top kind of yeah a good ten top unis all we'd just go to uni it wasn't even on discussion
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	and i'm not very good at like take command of a room of people i'm very kinda like ah hi how be you say something funny and i always kinda look like i a ghost erm and
S0198	oh no you don't i know that you can
S0235	but it be obviously
S0198	oh
S0235	i'll explain what happen
S0198	yeah
S0235	er
S0192	classroom management classroom management
S0198	something bad about the class
S0235	so yeah it be
S0192	classroom management's definitely a part of it
S0235	it be it be so so so bad erm so i be just monitor the class while they be i think they be write like a gsce paper or some rubbish and they be mean to be work on this kind of like oh it wasn't just it be an oral it be an oral project like have to do like their oral exam so you have to like
S0198	mm
S0235	write up a paper and then you're gonna read it out like in the exams
S0198	oh okay
S0235	and i be walk round the group and the group and there be this kid in my class who i mean it be like year ten because they would do their gsce then
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	so who be like fourteen fifteen he be a bite of an emo kid he have like a fringe cross face he be very dark haired and he i walk past him and i saw on his computer that he be research gang rape on wikipedia and he be talk about i know right and be like talk about it and laugh about it so me be me be like okay i can't ignore it i need to address it because he know i've hear because i smile because it's funny
S0198	yeah
S0235	and
S0198	it's not funny
S0235	so i be like i don't think that's very appropriate you know you need to be research for your for your oral presentation and he kinda make this comment and i be like you know what actually i be like maybe it would be suitable for you to give a presentation to the whole of the class erm on why this be not an appropriate thing to talk about like not the actual subject itself but why research a subject like that which be so offensive to a large group of people why that's not an appropriate thing to talk about
S0192	gang rape
S0235	yeah he turn around and be like oh my god i can do it for my gcse oral i be like you fuck bastard
S0198	he turn it against you
S0235	what can i do with that and i literally kind of just sit there for a minute laugh a little bite to myself and go get on with your work

S0198	yeah
S0235	as well the woman that be do child protection class be say like all of these things that she's talk about and all have come from experience that she have personally have as a teacher not just
S0198	ah okay
S0235	in this school but in other school
S0198	yeah
S0235	over the past like ten years one of them involve a boy not be in her class so at the end of her class she go to go to reception to find out if there be a reason why he wasn't in that class meet him on the corridor and be like why where be you this morning you've miss my class and he be like oh we find out my girlfriend's pregnant so we have to give her an abortion and she be like you have like less than three second to decide if that kid's lie or if there's like a fourteen year old girl bleed to death in her house and she be like what the fuck do you do and i be like i'd just fuck go home
S0235	i'd just i'd just go home
S0192	i'd resign

S0192	i'd resign
S0235	yeah i would just go home i'd just be alright you might wanna go to his girlfriend's house you might not you might wanna just get
S0192	no
S0198	go find out
S0192	we never never want to teach in a public school in england
S0235	it's it be
S0198	no no no no but it korea
S0235	so horrible
S0192	i mean teach teach in a public school in korea wasn't a cake a walk in the park
S0198	no no no that's an all boys' school
S0192	it be okay and then we avoid all of this
S0198	they be like animals
S0192	kind of stuff because it's in a foreign language
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah but because we weren't natives
S0192	and we
S0235	yeah if you yeah
S0198	we weren't responsible for that side of things
S0192	we weren't but also because we weren't natives we weren't respect as much
S0198	no yeah
S0192	which mean that we have to put a lot more effort
S0198	lot of students didn't understand you
S0236	mm
S0192	and quite often you quite often have cool teachers but for the most part i be leave on my own and you get like between thirty and forty students that don't speak your language that be just like try to understand
S0198	they just go mad like like an all boys' school they're like animals
S0192	it's like there's a lot of discipline i have a brick throw through my window once
S0198	not whilst you be teach
S0192	i didn't like no that be in at the night time and
S0198	i do have one in my classroom that do smash whilst i be teach
S0192	one of my students well the girls would often come in with bruise on their calve where their teachers have hit them or like my male students get their head shave like in school like just the whole school get their head shave
S0198	oh but that's common these days though isn't it
S0192	i be at a bad school i be like
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean so you go to my feeder school in the end and that be a really bad school as well but erm one time i saw the head so i have to invigilate exams in my in my high school and i be put with the head of english who naturally couldn't speak any english
S0235	yeah
S0192	cos you know it be
S0198	man because he's old
S0192	so i invigilate it's really bore walk around for hours just do nothing but the first exam i ever invigilate be a two hour exam and i remember really clearly that this student fell asleep within about ten minutes of the exams completely down on me and i remember look at the the head of english and kind of give him a look you know communicate without word kinda look at the student
S0235	yeah
S0192	be like you know be that okay he kinda nod at me and very suddenly walk round the back of the class and stand behind the student look at me again as if to say be this the student and i go yeah yeah
S0235	he's asleep obviously
S0192	smack him twice in the head
S0192	in his fuck head the student get up get grab the pen start write
S0192	i be wow oh my god like
S0235	you'd literally wouldn't be able to do that here
S0192	i would never could've point that out if i know
S0198	yeah yeah you're not mean to do it in korea any more but
S0192	no oh it get ban while we be there
S0235	no right no oh really
S0192	yeah
S0198	but within reason we'd still do it like they know like in my boys' school they know their parent like if they hit them a little bite they know their parent aren't gonna complain or anything
S0192	no
S0198	we're mean to be look after this child and then the most common form of punishment now be just put them in like different permissions and
S0192	which we have to do eventually
S0198	they spend i mean like even from primary school though from a really young age
S0192	but i
S0198	they'll make them like walk down at the corridors and squat at the same time
S0192	i use to
S0198	or like make them hold a position for age
S0236	it work
S0235	wow
S0192	i'm i use
S0198	yeah yeah i mean
S0192	dunce cap
S0198	within reason i mean yeah
S0192	i genuinely use one i i get the student up stand next to me you try and get them to help you
S0198	yeah the cap be good
S0192	help me teach you know what i mean do the board and stuff but it just doesn't really work so i get them they have to balance this cup that i'd draw an unhappy face on they have to balance it on their head and if it fell off
S0198	some people would
S0192	then you know i'd get angry and
S0198	actually you know
S0192	you get a red card or whatever and that'd be like bad thing so they really like try balance this this cap
S0235	that's good
S0198	it be kinda harsh
S0235	that be crazy
S0192	they would stand balance
S0235	that's but then i do think there's like
S0198	you can do that yeah
S0235	there's nothing necessarily wrong
S0236	at school we have that
S0235	with that thing
S0198	in
S0236	yeah
S0235	in school at the moment kid be like very very aware of like
S0198	the
S0235	not just in school i think generally people
S0192	yeah right
S0235	be just really aware of like their right
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	and what you can
S0198	especially
S0235	and cannot do as parent
S0236	of what they can tough they know you can't touch them
S0235	and like as a teacher
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	i remember one of the things i get teach while i be train to teach be like if you have a kid for detention you sit at your desk the kid sit in their chair if they have an allocate chair or they just sit somewhere
S0198	mm
S0235	and if that kid decide to get up and walk out the class like at no point can you interfere with that like you can't grab the kid you cannot at any point shut the door while you and the child be there
S0198	you can't trap you and your child in there
S0235	you can't stand in the doorway because that's see as like predatory
S0198	mm
S0235	you can't chase the kid down to his house
S0198	yeah it's all about your behaviour isn't it
S0235	yeah so all you can do if like a kid be in your class and he's like fuck it i'm gonna kill myself and run out of the class you all you can do as a teacher be sit there in that class ask er another pupil to go and inform reception
S0198	inform reception
S0235	that the student have vacate the classroom and have say this that's a reception problem
S0198	yeah
S0235	and that's it
S0198	mm
S0235	it's it's
S0198	i mean i think it's school it's the behaviour be not that good in korea you think like the like you say it can't be like they're definitely get worse and also the parent because they like make the student study so much like ridiculous hours from such a young age that they kind of allow them to behave however they want like in general
S0235	yeah
S0198	and also cos parent like pay for their children like his standard that you probably get pay to go er you parent will pay you to go to afternoon class at an institute it mean that when they actually come to school they don't care cos their parent don't care about their grade at school cos they be not pay for that
S0235	oh
S0198	they be pay for their afternoon one and that's when
S0235	yeah
S0198	the students be mean to study so the smart students i have some really smart asses that be like well my my parent don't pay for me to be here i'll do what i want and that's
S0192	yeah
S0198	but then they wouldn't say that
S0235	that's unfair
S0198	in english as in in another language
S0192	they work them to death the students would be like
S0198	also they like
S0192	my high school they're go to they live on high school they live on campus they go into seven they finish at about six or seven they then have an hour or two where they quickly eat a pot noodle and then they go to private school until midnight or something of the sort
S0235	that be what do in russia that be the thing
S0192	in russia
S0235	and have like he go to like normal school then he would finish and have like private of tutor at like an art school cos his mum be an artist and really want him to get into art so then he go to like art
S0198	mm they make
S0235	school for a couple of hours and he would eat and then he would go and do private tutor
S0198	oh god
S0235	he be really good at maths though
S0236	mm
S0235	that guy be like phenomenal on maths
S0198	yeah
S0235	but and also
S0198	yeah
S0235	he like make carnivals be interest in
S0192	pretty good at make car noise
S0235	yeah he go there with a really weird face of like even find him insane
S0198	oh do he how long be dinner
S0192	five minutes
S0198	oh five minutes
S0235	yeah it's kind of i have a really odd kid in my school erm who be everything about him he be like the geek kid he be the kid that in any other situation would've be and he probably be just severely bully like really ostracise maybe have like one friend but even that one friend didn't like associate themselves
S0192	oh
S0198	yeah
S0235	i felt terrible for this kid
S0198	oh
S0235	his mum use to walk him to the school door this kid be like we're talk
S0198	secondary school yeah
S0235	he be yeah secondary school so year seven he be his mum use to walk him to the school door the reception door and he would go through the door and then she would meet him at reception door
S0198	oh to pick him up
S0235	and walk him home
S0198	be he special
S0235	no no no no his mum be a bite special but he
S0198	ah
S0235	you know she be just so obsessive over him but we have this he he be it be a really surreal kind of scenario because this kid be doze in class and i mean he be he he hadn't really do anything that bad but it be bad enough that even cos i'm mean to you always have to make examples of year sevens because it kind of set set their path
S0198	yeah
S0235	and he do something and the teacher be like right after school detention where you have to obviously check with the parent and the mum be like no and he need to be home so we could never give him after school detention
S0198	after school detention ah
S0235	and he know we could never give him after school detention
S0198	really
S0235	because the mum refuse to let him stay because
S0198	yeah
S0235	she want to like i don't know like comb his hair or something at home
S0198	oh no oh oh oh
S0192	lovely
S0235	so he could just do whatever he want so he be like he would swear he would purposely like so he be this real he should've be a really smart kid who
S0198	yeah
S0235	who work really well because he have no friends and his library be
S0198	he be the other end of that
S0235	but yeah because he know he could get away with stuff he kinda figure that that be his way in like he could be the naughty kid and ergo he would make friends and it doesn't matter because he'll never get in trouble really
S0198	trouble really yeah
S0235	so he just become this really
S0198	oh
S0235	odd kid that never really fit any kind of social group
S0198	yeah you always get those at school definitely get them in
S0235	and i just don't really know well in like in chapter we there be that family wasn't there do you remember the really weird family and the mum use to walk all the kid to school
S0198	oh yeah
S0235	i don't think any of there be an older boy who i think be in our six form and then they have daughters like she have daughters but none of them be in our year and they always use to wear like fluorescent tracksuits
S0198	oh jesus i don't remember that
S0235	and she use to wear
S0192	it's the mark of a cool person isn't it fluorescent
S0198	and
S0235	yeah
S0192	tracksuit
S0235	she use to walk them like straight to the door
S0198	oh
S0235	like even this kid the kid must've be about like sixteen
S0198	yeah
S0235	seventeen the older boy
S0198	yeah i know no fuck off
S0235	yeah i think really
S0198	i teach like if there's something in korea that's not well acknowledge be any kind of different mental abilities or
S0192	oh god yeah we'd often have like three special need students in our class but nobody know what's wrong with them
S0198	and we
S0192	and then nobody help you with them
S0198	and there be definitely kid that be like i don't know if they be make they be really intelligent they'd be like the top set and they'd know like i have one boy in particular he'd like he would you'd say you're from england and then at the end of class he come up and he have an entire map of england with all the counties and all the cities and he'd ask me where i'm from that he'd hand draw and he would like memorise like the entire national anthem
S0235	wow
S0198	for the different countries and stuff like so i think it be like
S0235	sound awesome
S0192	er kind of autism mm
S0198	autism yeah
S0235	yeah autistic spectrum
S0198	but at the same time like all the students hat him because they didn't he didn't like
S0235	at school
S0198	socialise in the same way
S0192	mm
S0235	and he would do things like i be try to draw a face like don't forget to blah blah blah that be in their textbook and he stand up and he be like don't forget to wash your ball and like
S0198	in my lesson and i think that be hilarious
S0192	don't forget to wash your ball
S0198	the other boys they don't think in english
S0192	one draw a big penis didn't they or something
S0198	ah yeah that be another student draw a massive penis in class boys be funny man they're just
S0192	don't forget to wash boys be easier to teach than girls i think genuinely
S0235	i think boys generally be easier than girls
S0236	girls yeah
S0198	girls be a little bite more insane but my boys i think my boys' behaviour
S0236	boys be louder
S0192	boys be louder
S0198	be much worse than your girls' behaviour
S0192	but i could get them to work easier
S0236	mm
S0192	i have girls that be just didn't bring a pen didn't bring paper refuse to do anything just sit at the back of the class and don't do anything and like
S0235	yeah
S0192	i have a girl in my last class
S0198	i like to teach boys
S0192	and this be a uni and they're a lot better behave but i mean first class i go to check on her work and she brush me away like this she be like and i think a few other teachers that work at our uni would've immediately dislike her and have a problem with it but i guess i i just saw it as a bite of a challenge like i'm gonna get her to like me and be
S0235	yeah
S0192	but by half way through she really open up and i don't blame her she didn't wanna speak english she didn't wanna study english i can't really blame her for that
S0235	yeah i think that's the thing when you're kind of force into
S0198	she be straight out of high school so she
S0192	yeah yeah
S0198	still carry on with high school attitudes
S0192	you have to understand these things as a teacher i often think that some of the best teachers will probably be students who weren't very good students i wasn't a very good student at school so i can understand the students
S0235	yeah i guess you
S0192	that aren't really good at school yeah
S0235	have like empathy with them
S0192	i think
S0198	don't take things too personally
S0192	i wouldn't have like to have teach me at high school
S0235	i don't think the two of us
S0192	be you two bad

S0192	mm it be expensive here but the quality here's good
S0236	mm
S0192	and you pay for what you get
S0198	more or less yeah
S0192	i like the culture here as well like the work that stuff i miss that in korea a lot
S0198	there's like crazy look people a lot of people that you're like man he's get a hard life
S0235	yeah
S0192	yeah so that
S0198	you don't think that so much well definitely not in korea anyway
S0192	no
S0198	but you're like look
S0235	look
S0198	yeah
S0236	i them up north
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah basically
S0192	i've get to get my in korea
S0198	yeah
S0236	i let them run that park
S0235	yeah we watch a really interest but strange surreal probably a better word like vice documentary
S0198	mm
S0235	about north korea
S0198	mm
S0235	and erm
S0236	it be in korea
S0235	yeah a guy go in and do like i don't know just some journalisty kind of thing in north korea
S0198	yeah
S0235	but they be like he have kind of secret service men with him like all the way round and i guess like a lot of it be kind of like a stylise and like er what's the word kind of dramatise for television and stuff but they be like they be in the car and like drive for one place to another and they be like oh i'm hungry let's stop here and so this gent go okay that's fine we'll stop here but then they be go to this restaurant and everything be like kind of like just there wait no one be there eat because they can't afford to eat in a place like that
S0198	yeah no one's gonna eat there just tourists
S0192	mm
S0235	and he say the thing be be the service will make out like this big spontaneous thing but there's like a place serve like ready for one person
S0192	mm
S0198	mm
S0235	so they know you be come like days ago
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	and erm yeah it be just really it be really interest because i guess as like a westerner you never really get to see much in north korea apart from
S0198	mm
S0192	yeah
S0235	apart from the tv
S0198	whatever be on tv yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	it be definitely strange live there it be something that you know it be always in the back of your mind and it do flare up a few time when we be there what it really effect be the exchange rat
S0235	mm
S0192	as soon as something start go down we lose money and i've watch the exchange rat for like five years in korea now and what we be on i suppose like fourteen fifteen grand
S0235	oh
S0192	and that would fluctuate by five k depend on the exchange rate so at the very worst we be on ten k year at the very best we be on fifteen sixteen k yeah so it really make a difference like
S0235	wow
S0192	it really change what you're earn basically
S0198	yeah
S0192	and i there be a few good things they sink that boat there be there be the sink of the cheonan they five shell at yeonpyeong island so there be like probably three or four quite big events while we be there
S0236	do they shoot the missiles over japan while you be there
S0192	yup yeah we be over there
S0235	oh
S0236	that's
S0198	oh yeah the entire test like
S0192	and then you get your family ring you up and worry about you
S0198	but then you that worry
S0235	i would've
S0198	yeah
S0236	who be the next one
S0198	yeah the the media definitely
S0236	well i like crazy fuck your crazy neighbour
S0192	whatever yeah
S0198	they could just be like
S0236	it doesn't matter
S0198	weapon test that the media turn that into
S0192	the media spin it
S0235	yeah
S0198	oh
S0192	definitely
S0198	yeah they definitely do
S0192	they leave korea for a while and you you see them they're like they'll bring up north korea every six months to a year when people be just kinda forget about it they spin that plate again and go oh don't forget about north korea this be why we're have problems with nuclear weapons all this kind of stuff and they'll bring it back to the fourth run and then you forget it again and then they're back again
S0235	yeah
S0192	so koreans be use to that it's be go on year in year out for fifty years so
S0198	yeah forever
S0192	they don't when this stuff kick out they're not bother
S0236	yeah
S0192	it really doesn't affect them it's sad
S0192	because if you ask the older generation they wanna reunify if you ask the younger generation they don't
S0236	mm
S0192	so chance be they're not go to
S0198	it's not a good idea
S0192	in general yeah
S0198	in general they don't think it's realistic
S0192	definitely crazy be you know north korea be one of the craziest countries in the world and like it seem in ten years
S0235	it do sound pretty insane

S0198	mm
S0235	you start at nine and you finish at seven
S0198	yeah
S0235	so you can't work
S0198	mm
S0235	you could only work so she work saturdays and sundays to pay like her bill and stuff and they pay the scholarship or whatever she get erm of this like the laurence olivier award be enough for her to not have to work for a year
S0198	oh nice
S0192	i i only find out recently from and
S0198	what be how long be that course
S0192	they be say
S0235	three years
S0192	they be say that if you go to uni at at one of the oxbridge like oxford or cambridge you can't work
S0235	mm
S0192	you're not allow to work
S0198	cos to get to university yeah
S0235	yeah they do not allow you to work
S0236	i didn't know that
S0192	mm
S0235	yeah you just go to university
S0192	alright just to make it even more elitist
S0198	and also they say if someone say to
S0235	yeah yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	just in case you
S0236	the reason be they want you to focus full time
S0192	cos they want you just to
S0198	oh yeah
S0236	on your study
S0198	they if like you're not study you have to be participate
S0235	yeah
S0198	in an extra curricular stuff
S0192	yeah but you need to have enough money so that you can survive
S0236	yeah
S0235	but the only good thing be be like when the tuition fee go up oxford and or oxbridge be now technically in like
S0192	the same yeah
S0235	the grand scheme of things they're like one of the cheaper universities
S0236	affordable
S0235	to go to
S0192	yeah
S0235	because they offer like
S0198	oh
S0235	really really really really good package for erm i wouldn't say like
S0236	they've get quite a lot of program for you that you can't work
S0235	underprivileged but people from low income
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	no you can't work but you there's no way you'll pay half of what like the kid that have come from eton will pay for your tuition
S0192	yeah
S0198	tuition ah interest
S0235	they'd still be like kind of mean test they whoever they be
S0192	mm that screw me that mean test thing my parent have recently divorce so they be give i live on my own for a year to save up money that's how i could afford to go and then i didn't know at the time but you have to be live on on your own for three years to be self assess
S0235	yeah
S0192	i didn't know that
S0236	mm
S0192	so i try to be self assess after a year they tell me i couldn't be i have to go get my family assess so then they be assess their partner who get nothing to do with me i don't know who they be and basically they're deem that
S0235	yeah
S0192	because their partner they have enough money that but but then they didn't give me a penny
S0236	mm
S0192	i haven't have anything from them so
S0235	yeah that's not good
S0192	i felt like i get a little bite raw deal on that one
S0235	i miss out on the mean test
S0192	other people be get load of like benefit
S0235	they finish mean test the year before i start
S0192	yeah
S0198	oh do they
S0235	yeah so everyone just pay of like everyone pay like a flat rate
S0198	you didn't get i think
S0235	and i could not
S0198	oh okay
S0235	you get more money from
S0198	you get extra grant though then
S0235	yeah you get like extra grant
S0192	yeah
S0235	like maintenance grant and all the loan and stuff
S0198	oh that wasn't like that when we be there the tuition still cost the same
S0192	i'll tell you what
S0198	but
S0198	you just get more in grant or more in loan
S0192	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	i'll tell you what
S0198	but you didn't get anything
S0192	if i have know about this access course i might have just screw a level have fuck around for a few years and then do an access course if my brother's
S0236	yeah
S0192	get in to a pretty good uni
S0198	yeah
S0192	that's like a top thirty uni you know what i mean and he's
S0235	oh yeah but like he be
S0236	that's what we have access course
S0235	like four twenty three twenty four
S0192	yeah
S0236	and they look more favourably upon it cos you're older
S0192	yeah you get a better you get into a better
S0235	yeah
S0192	uni because of it
S0236	mm
S0192	but he completely screw up his college and his a level and all that kind of stuff
S0235	yeah and that's exactly what we do
S0192	but get into a good uni
S0236	mm
S0235	we do access
S0236	yeah
S0235	which be just a like a quick way to get into it
S0192	i wish i'd know that one year of college
S0198	just work for a couple of years and then
S0192	yeah
S0198	do the access
S0235	it be good i think it be it's good as well because nine time out of ten by the time you've do an access or you get round to do an access course all of your friends have already go on to do better things like
S0192	yeah
S0235	or go to uni or go travel or whatever it be
S0198	it's a motivation
S0235	so you be a lot more kind of like
S0198	motivate
S0235	dedicate
S0192	mm yeah
S0198	you would sit down like an easy year work full time when
S0192	mm
S0235	yeah and like i don't wanna do anything so
S0198	they don't know how shit that be
S0192	i personally think that in general i don't think that you should be allow to go to university until you're twenty one
S0235	no
S0192	i honestly think that they should be a break and you should travel work do whatever it be
S0235	mm
S0192	but it make me laugh that you're seventeen and eleven months and you're not you can't be try under the the law the proper law like as an adult but as soon as you click over to eighteen here's a fifteen grand debt
S0236	mm
S0192	a debt that's gonna last for thirty years of your life i honestly think that if you put uni back and say that you're gotta be twenty one to go to uni some people that wouldn't normally go to uni would end up go to uni because they would've figure their life out a bite more and other people that be just float through maybe wouldn't have go in the first place
S0235	yeah
S0192	because you have to consider it a bite more
S0235	no i don't think it be a bad idea i think it's probably quite a good one
S0198	many access course be like say it be the only thing that we can do
S0192	mm
S0235	but part of that the access course originally you have to be nineteen
S0198	yeah
S0235	and over the
S0198	like they've change that now
S0192	mm
S0235	but now they're talk no they be talk at one point about take it down to like sixteen
S0192	what
S0235	so you could just do that instead of do your a level
S0198	and then go to university when you're younger
S0235	i guess so
S0192	what
S0236	mm
S0235	and i be no you like it's completely completely pointless so
S0198	yeah i don't think it's some er
S0235	it deceive the point like and also part of the reason when you do
S0198	experience of uni
S0235	you do an access course as oppose to do a level
S0198	yeah
S0235	you don't have to sit with a bunch of like sixteen year old kid who do not wanna be there
S0198	senior olds
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	and they're not gonna learn
S0192	but now you're gonna have to be with sixteen year olds
S0235	well if they do it i don't think they will do it
S0198	but you could potentially be with sixteen no no no
S0235	because there be a lot of pressure to get there
S0192	yeah
S0235	because it's it's the a level for adults you know
S0192	when they put the price up for uni
S0198	i don't think that's
S0192	there be protest go on right
S0235	yeah load
S0198	there be a lot of protest yeah yeah yeah
S0235	there be things at my uni like everything
S0192	anything happen
S0235	lot of of what yeah lot of unis be like
S0192	as in do they make any grind do they
S0235	yeah er we're not gonna do it and then they do it anyway
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	well there's not really much you can actually do
S0192	so protest be kinda pointless isn't it really
S0235	yeah and it doesn't really work very well
S0198	you don't achieve so much with that
S0192	yeah they've get so whip here
S0235	there be a really good option that i be really pro for erm as oppose to the increase tuition fee which would set like student tax so you didn't pay to go to uni but after you finish uni for the rest of your life you would have tax
S0192	you pay a tax so it's like
S0198	tax which be what they call my student loan yeah
S0192	which be effectively what our student loan be yeah
S0235	yeah effectively it's
S0192	student tax
S0235	you pay like ten percent of your wag so if you're on a hundred grand it's obviously a lot more
S0192	yeah yeah
S0235	than if you're on fifteen but over a certain amount you pay a student tax
S0198	yeah
S0235	and then everyone pay it
S0192	do you guy still have bachelor loan
S0198	that's kind of more fair because then they're like
S0235	yeah yeah of course mine's like twenty grand
S0236	mm
S0192	yeah fair enough so more than ours then
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah well she you have to top up fee didn't you
S0235	yeah i
S0192	as yours be three grand
S0235	yeah mine be three grand a year
S0192	oh what's that top up have a bank account
S0235	oh it be yeah
S0192	they just look for some modern terminology didn't they everyone's top up their phone
S0235	yeah oh yeah
S0192	we'll er we'll top up our bank account top up fee
S0236	yeah that's good screw themselves
S0198	oh yeah yeah yeah it's
S0235	yeah well let me know i'm pay this it's like
S0198	yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah
S0236	well i didn't pay it you've steal the money from me and i haven't get any money so far
S0235	and it's like
S0198	no yeah you've get a certain amount haven't you
S0235	this be the thing with student loan be you yeah you have to earn
S0236	yeah
S0235	and with a nine grand you now have to earn like twenty thousand or something of like this
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0236	yeah
S0198	with the fee i be gonna say
S0236	yeah me
S0198	it depend on which country you're get it actually
S0192	oh it's be ridiculous in korea
S0235	mm
S0192	we've be pay off about fifteen pound a month on our student loan
S0236	mm
S0235	mm
S0198	on average it's go sometimes it's three pound it go up to thirty pound for a short time and then they be like er we make a mistake
S0192	cos we weren't make enough we be make enough money to clock over so i basically owe
S0198	but in korea it's different they our
S0192	exactly the same as i owe before i've just be pay off the interest
S0236	mm
S0198	our student loan be like
S0235	you don't have
S0198	if you earn over fifteen grand or whatever you pay nine percent but because we be live in korea it's anything over nine grand if you live in india it's anything over like four grand it depend on your country they're assess because they know
S0192	yeah it change country to country
S0198	that in that country you're actually earn
S0236	mm yeah
S0198	a small
S0192	yeah it's equitable
S0236	mm
S0198	yeah
S0192	your loan will actually be clear quicker than ours i look into them
S0198	your top up fee
S0192	and the top up fee will be clear thirty years after you start after you take the loan so
S0235	yeah
S0192	when you take the loan say if you're twenty you only pay
S0235	but then there's
S0192	like by fifty they'll wipe it
S0198	oh really
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah i think it's after twenty
S0236	yeah
S0198	really
S0192	thirty years
S0235	be it i think it be twenty five
S0192	i look into that twenty five thirty
S0235	be it thirty yeah
S0192	whereas ours
S0235	it's
S0192	ours be
S0198	until we're we're sixty five
S0192	until we're sixty five
S0198	or that
S0235	oh really
S0192	so because we take out the other loan they won't wipe that until we're like sixty five so
S0235	but i mean it's kind of one those it's not like they're not gonna come take your tv
S0198	no no no exactly
S0192	no no
S0235	and so it's
S0192	but
S0235	i don't really have
S0198	we've have some
S0192	they do send some very threaten letter
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	and they
S0235	do they
S0192	yeah to us
S0198	they send letter and stuff
S0192	because they live abroad and like there're time when we
S0198	and it's just miscommunication
S0235	oh
S0198	and shit on their part
S0192	when we go travel they don't believe us that we're not work so they send out load of letter to our family and they're quite threaten letter all red like you owe us this all this
S0198	they actually threaten us and something like this
S0192	all lie just complete lie they're not real you haven't be pay this you owe us this we're gonna send the bailiffs round and do this and they do all through a subsidiary company call company which when you google it
S0198	it's
S0192	isn't real it's just student loan company
S0192	it's just the same company
S0198	they create a secondary company yeah
S0235	ah
S0192	but they scare you by think that it's this
S0235	yes
S0192	and they put the word law in it company
S0235	yeah yeah so it sound
S0192	yeah
S0198	my friend's
S0192	but they don't have the right to do anything but
S0198	say recently
S0192	but it still scar our family they be like ah we the bailiffs
S0198	they've be take to court about it recently
S0192	who
S0198	because it's unethical say that the
S0192	oh because of this yeah
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	so we've receive quite a few dodgy letter from them and it's a bite of a pain in the ass to tell you the truth every month log into this website just to pay them ten pound or something fifteen quid cos in england it just come automatically and it's not the same really
S0198	yeah they take it from your wag
S0235	yeah they take it from my wag but it isn't high
S0192	we need to get
S0235	i pay when i be like in recruitment they take out money for like two years
S0198	yeah yeah it's
S0192	oh yeah your recruitments so that be good money
S0198	yeah but you you be two years in recruitment
S0235	yeah but even then like i be on pretty good money i be on really good money
S0198	yeah
S0235	but
S0192	what do you earn if you don't mind
S0235	like well i have a basic of like twenty which isn't that impressive
S0192	mm no that's fine
S0235	but i get commission
S0192	mm
S0235	and i get quite good commission rate and all the job er the minimum amount we sort of recruit for be like sixty five seventy k a year
S0192	yeah
S0235	so like ten percent of that
S0192	nice
S0235	and so it's quite good
S0192	it's top up by another six seven grand on top of everything
S0235	well depend on how many people you employ and i be quite good at recruitment if i
S0192	you be
S0198	say so myself
S0192	we almost we almost
S0198	gift
S0235	if you get recruitment can be really good
S0192	before i know
S0198	like
S0235	like if you get into the right
S0192	my cousin be a recruitment consultant she love it
S0235	if you get into the right type of recruitment if you do high street recruitment your life's gonna be horrible and miserable and lead by people who like you have some really horrible
S0192	it's get to be
S0235	horrible people on recruitment you hear some really scary stories about people who erm because like you kind of you don't own a candidate but you kind of do
S0192	mm
S0235	and you help people that own the job and so it's it's almost work at a job and you find the candidate and you split fifty fifty but a friend of ours who work in she work for like high street kind of recruitment and her manager would like steal erm cvs from her and like take them over and would like lock down her computer and like
S0198	oh that's just in in in job that
S0192	cos it's commission there's a bite of a fight yeah really
S0198	oh yeah
S0235	yeah so would like yeah like
S0198	i think you mean like from customers
S0235	no no like customers i mean customers
S0198	no recruit
S0235	but like yeah the actual fellow fellow staff and would possibly
S0198	your colleagues
S0235	yeah fuck up your day so that they would get your money and you wouldn't
S0198	ah
S0192	i've always have kind of ethical issue with
S0235	but
S0192	the middle man job you know what i mean like recruitment consultancy and stuff do you feel like you be help the employees
S0198	state agencies
S0192	or be it purely just make money out of the employees and the employers
S0235	i mean it's hard the thing be it's difficult because the recruitment i be in it be like really a high level so
S0192	mm
S0235	it be like sales directors and managers and
S0192	mm
S0235	like people who like build satellite and stuff
S0192	yeah
S0235	like that so really smart people who be really good at their job
S0192	so you're put these people in touch with each other basically
S0235	so yeah so all i be do if someone would hire me like for example it's like a big satellite company erm or just general telecommunications and they would be like we want this person and then you would go and try and find that person you use like linkedin and stuff it's a big recruitment tool and go find them
S0192	mm
S0235	and then just like push them through an interview
S0192	yeah
S0235	nobody get the job that they so there's part of it that do i mean one guy that i always have a problem with well it be not so bad but there be a guy who work for and he work for like and they offer final year salaries and that mean that every year you will continue to be pay the last salary that you're on so if you retire on seventy grand a year they will continue to pay you seventy grand a year to you kind of crock
S0192	cop it yeah
S0235	erm
S0198	wow
S0235	yeah so
S0198	it's a massive incentive to stay
S0192	a massive incentive to kill you after this
S0235	yeah yeah exactly his wife be probably like
S0235	erm so yeah so i get him to leave that job
S0198	that job
S0235	go to don't offer er final year salaries but the guy be also in his mid forties be incredibly well educate very very smart so there's a part of you that think i feel bad because i'm persuade him to leave a very good job to go to an equally very good job where it's more about kind of career progression rather than just sit on er like sit safe at until he retire
S0192	yeah
S0235	but then so i i kind of felt bad for that but then i also think well you're a lot smarter than i be you know what my job be
S0192	yeah
S0235	you know i'm here to like
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0192	to do this yeah
S0235	make you yeah you know i'm here for the money
S0198	at the end of the day and like assess the situation
S0235	yeah of course and he i mean you're not talk it's not like quick turnaround either like people be on like three month like
S0192	yeah do you get money depend on
S0198	yeah
S0192	if they pass the probationary period and that kind of
S0235	so no you would get like a a fee so the recruitment company would charge a fee to fill the job they the job they get the fee and then what would happen be if someone walk out after like a day then you would have to refund the fee a hundred percent
S0192	yeah
S0235	and then like the longer it go on
S0198	oh the fee decrease
S0235	and the fee decrease so i think it be up to about six months
S0192	ah okay
S0235	if they
S0192	so you be already hop that they stay there
S0198	oh six months there it's still quite a long time
S0235	yeah but mostly they
S0192	do they drop out much
S0235	i have one woman erm something who be work for one company and i get her a job at another company and then she be miss load of days and it work out she'd never leave her old company she'd stay
S0236	ah
S0235	and she wasn't sure what to do so she'd take the job at the new company and because the
S0198	have she
S0235	well because they're all really high level
S0198	yeah
S0235	they can just not go into the office for like
S0198	they get like office hours and meet that kind of stuff
S0235	or yeah and then they're like i'm in a meet or whatever and she be just work with the other company
S0198	work from home
S0235	and then just make a decision after a couple of weeks and be like i'm just gonna stay
S0192	i mean i guess at that level of recruitment i understand that it's probably quite difficult for some people to get in contact with their job as in when they drop out
S0198	well you're provide the service to the company
S0235	yeah
S0192	you be provide a service
S0198	it's not necessarily the people you're hire yeah yeah
S0236	yeah it's the company
S0192	yeah really
S0198	yeah it's the company that have to deal with this shit
S0236	their own people
S0198	yeah yeah like we've get so much money
S0192	it's the lower down shit munchers that kind of think be a bite harsh like cos you're take money off pretty much every hour
S0198	like you say the high street recruitment
S0192	i'll tell you what i really have a problem with like er job seekers allowance now and i we sign up before i don't know if you ever guy have ever sign up for that
S0235	i do
S0236	i go once cos i be tell i be entitle and it turn out that i wasn't
S0192	yeah
S0198	you give up
S0192	all the effort
S0198	oh
S0192	pointless
S0236	they only say you should be able to claim this cos er you know
S0192	they make me jump through hoop last time we be here we only sign up for a month i be gonna sign up this time because i want my teeth do
S0198	want to sign up to get free dentistry yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	yeah i need some some dental work and i know that's gonna cost but i've hear about people and like your brother and other people once they've be on it long enough they make you do a really shit job like poundland or
S0236	mm
S0198	mm
S0192	something and you still get the same fifty pound a week
S0235	yeah
S0192	but you have to work forty hours and then you're on about one pound twenty a week
S0235	yeah
S0192	so what you're say be that job be available cos we can put you in it but we're not just gonna give you the real job where you get pay a real wage
S0236	mm
S0192	we're gonna make you do the job for one pound twenty an hour
S0235	yeah
S0236	yeah
S0192	what i understand at this point why you don't just go
S0235	yeah
S0192	there's a job here it be
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean rather than we're gonna make you do that job
S0198	well just if you're gonna force someone to work and just force them to take the job
S0192	yeah there's a job fill the job
S0236	mm
S0192	i don't understand why there're load of job under under the
S0192	why they don't just give you a job cos
S0235	yeah
S0192	there're always job that need fill so
S0235	i mean there's yeah i agree and i don't
S0198	there're people that need them
S0235	i think i with the
S0236	yeah to find a job
S0192	not gonna happen be it
S0236	no cos they don't want the job
S0198	yeah yeah it's the reason that you be say they don't want the job
S0192	but that's what i'm say put them in the job
S0236	mm
S0192	if there's a job seekers allowance
S0198	yeah but they don't want to do the job they fuck it up
S0235	if
S0192	i don't see why they should keep your benefit if they go they find you a job and you don't wanna do it well that's the end of your benefit
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah but then
S0192	we find a job
S0198	it's within reason now of course cos obviously you put people there that be completely
S0192	yeah i i know of course you need to do something within your qualifications or
S0198	it should be after a certain amount of time or something
S0192	or it need to hit certain
S0236	mm
S0198	after the next three years maybe you will be able to do something
S0192	but now they've change the law and we can't
S0235	yeah it's
S0192	we couldn't sign up you have to have be in england they just change the law this year for three months
S0235	yeah
S0192	before you can sign up
S0235	yeah it's all because of the whole like
S0198	immigration
S0235	immigration thing
S0192	immigration yeah
S0236	yeah but then that's stupid anyway cos it's like erm what's his name the american fella who i be at uni with
S0235	oh er
S0236	yeah well when he come with his girlfriend they'd be travel a lot like you guy and they come to england to do he's do his master with me she be work but when they come he couldn't claim benefit it be physically impossible for him to claim benefit because he wasn't english and he'd just move here you have to be like
S0235	yeah
S0236	six months a year or something before you can even think about it
S0192	yeah
S0198	oh really
S0236	so suddenly he find out he can't take his benefit but
S0198	it's bullshit they couldn't do it
S0236	they can't
S0192	they can't
S0236	they physically can't do it
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	we try and say to people when
S0236	yeah and even if they do wanna get the job they'll take their job and they don't pay tax but they do pay tax
S0198	yeah they can't they
S0236	cos that's an english job so the fact be
S0192	they have to pay tax yeah
S0198	they have to pay tax yeah i know
S0236	illegal immigrants and illegal immigrants aren't mean to be here anyway so
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah exactly
S0236	that's already a crime and be against the law
S0192	that's the problem yeah we're try to explain to people
S0198	that's what we families like
S0192	we be immigrants
S0236	mm
S0192	in a different country work
S0198	i say i work in korea
S0192	i er i'm an immigrant
S0236	mm
S0198	and i didn't spend my money in korea i save it and i've blow it all on an ma and my rent in england
S0236	mm
S0192	so all that money we save in korea
S0198	anyway
S0235	yeah
S0198	but that's exactly what people be do
S0192	will actually be spend in england so
S0198	and they're like oh no it's different
S0236	yeah but they still pay tax on that one don't they
S0192	people people seem to think it's just a british problem
S0198	yeah yeah exactly
S0192	with all this immigration but it's not every single country
S0235	yeah no no there's a huge
S0192	allow immigrants in to work
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0192	every single country
S0235	of course they do
S0198	yeah it's ridiculous
S0192	so
S0198	they take our job
S0192	they take our job
S0235	it be just yeah it be it be completely ridiculous
S0192	mm
S0235	and i always feel bad as well people get so angry about er sort of hollister you know like use to work at hollister
S0236	mm
S0235	so hollister's like i don't know if you know it's a really horrible high brand store but you go in and it's pretty much pitch black and they have spotlight on the clothe
S0235	everyone look like they've just walk off a beach in malibu like you don't you don't go for a job there you're like erm what's it call
S0198	headhunted
S0192	headhunted
S0235	like headhunted so a woman would come up to you on the street and be like would you like to work for hollister and you're classify as like a model
S0198	yes
S0235	and this be how like americans get round hooters thing because technically it's illegal to hire people on look but you're hire a model and so that's how they
S0198	oh really
S0235	negate it and that's how they do it in england with hollister and there's a couple of other company that do it as well and that's fine like in the day it's like you pay like a hundred and ten pound for a pair of like second hand jeans and in the even a friend of us work there in the even like do like shelve and whatever and she be the only english person that work there everyone else be like i don't know where like from india like the kind of erm eastern europe like all that kind of part of the world they what they make them do be completely illegal like they work insane hours they be underpay and it be terrible and then they would go home and there be like five or six guy all live like in a one bedroom studio house in gravesend
S0198	yeah
S0192	mm
S0235	and people get mad at that and i'm like how could they're live in like such bad condition
S0236	yeah yeah
S0198	bad condition
S0192	yeah they're work their ass off
S0235	and it's not their fault yeah they're work their ass off like they're offer all these opportunities and
S0192	quite often you speak to these people as well and they're all like i be a doctor in my country
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah right
S0192	and now i work at aldi
S0198	yeah it's so
S0235	and it's like
S0192	i be a policeman and now i work at like hollister or something
S0236	mm
S0235	and technically it's not even it's not their fault you blame the company you don't blame
S0198	they're people who be try to make a fuck live there
S0235	the people who be
S0192	no can you imagine if somebody say
S0235	yeah
S0192	to you hey you can go and work in a shit job in that country
S0236	mm
S0192	and earn double what you're earn in this country
S0235	yeah of course why would you not do it
S0192	you go for it you go for it
S0235	it make perfect sense
S0192	so you can't blame them for that at all
S0235	no no no i don't think you should
S0192	people do that and then
S0235	but it's erm

S0236	so i pull my trousers up and pull my sock down but there be no teeth mark so
S0198	no it's just yeah yeah i get three
S0192	we er we've have a few problems with dog and we quite often we like to hike in the middle of nowhere and we have to pick carry a stick or a rock or something like that only recently in er china a tibetan mastiff go fuck crazy you know they're big fuck dog
S0236	mm
S0235	mm
S0192	and they er obviously be tell me let's not go in there it doesn't look safe
S0198	yeah we clearly we be go to look at some like temple thing
S0192	and i'm like no no let's go
S0198	in china and there be it be clearly like the the
S0192	it wasn't clear
S0198	the ticket stand like it be out tomb raider like it be clearly abandon and stuff like that which obviously
S0192	there be like a whole
S0198	it automatically make me think dog
S0192	i think that be a castle not for people
S0198	cos we've be in so many situations
S0235	yeah
S0198	now that we get chase away by fuck dog so we walk in you be try to get be quite a bite
S0192	i get a bite further away from
S0198	ahead of me thankfully
S0192	so when the dog come out freak
S0198	so when this dog come pound out like
S0192	i have to run back
S0198	go mental
S0192	and i just have to block and this dog's proper snap at us and snarl and like kinda jump up and i kinda like have to very slowly walk back cautiously to get back
S0198	he be just defend his property or whatever but
S0192	but you know how many time that happen to us
S0198	so many time
S0192	like very closely i could be maul by a dog right now like and it's not a small dog
S0198	i think they're just defend their property
S0192	they're like big massive it's a big fuck dog
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah that dog be massive
S0236	mm
S0198	yeah it's massive
S0192	it would kill me that fuck dog would kill me
S0198	but i've be to the point i get bite like that happen to us load before then
S0192	yeah
S0198	and we just accept they be just you know
S0192	that's when you get bite
S0198	defend their property so yeah that's why i get bite cos i didn't even
S0192	be get a bite about it and you just kind of
S0198	i didn't even turn around to look at the dog
S0236	yeah
S0192	just kind of yeah
S0198	that be behind us but i look at it it probably wouldn't have do anything but if it be quite a small dog that's okay
S0192	that improve my spanish didn't it i have to go to like five different hospitals over ninety days to have this thing do every time the hospital didn't realise that they have the newer version of the vaccine so they be tell us
S0236	mm
S0192	no this gotta go in your stomach and it's gonna be ten injections and this but actually some dusty old box somewhere they have the new vaccine it go in your arm but every single hospital we go to didn't know that
S0198	yeah it be yeah
S0192	so in spanish i have to communicate to them every time you know she's be bite before we've already have two injections you do have the injection
S0236	mm
S0192	you need to look for it and this be what happen but it be pretty hard the first couple of time that we go to hospital
S0235	my god
S0198	mm the first hospital be horrible cos they be like you're gonna have to have the old school rabies injection which be like ten injections over ten days or twenty days in your stomach they're big and painful
S0192	you don't need all that
S0236	mm
S0198	and they're like you need be you sure you can't bring in the dog they're like
S0192	yeah no no
S0198	cos the the they be like bring in the dog and put the dog in quarantine for ten days
S0236	mm
S0198	to see if it actually have rabies before they put you through the procedure
S0192	cos we be in the middle of nowhere so there's no dog
S0198	and then they do find this vaccination which be a massive relief but the instructions be in english so have to sit on google translate
S0192	i have to translate it into spanish
S0198	like medical jargon into google translate
S0235	yeah
S0192	so that they could administer it
S0198	translate everything into spanish then you have to administrate the vaccination
S0192	and even then they didn't have the immunoglobuline and you're mean to have some extra
S0198	which be
S0192	injection that go in the wind
S0236	yeah
S0198	i could've still get i could've definitely still get rabies even though i be have these injections
S0192	well i be worry as well because i have an open cut in my hand and i be clean her wind and stuff and i'd never have any injections or anything so i didn't really mention it cos obviously have be bite but a part of me be think you know half a year in like
S0236	mm
S0192	maybe i've get it or something cos
S0198	they can take it up to two years
S0192	yeah we didn't know that
S0198	it's the longest case of rabies
S0192	we be like if she's get rabies we're wait until she show some sign and
S0236	mm
S0192	and then we're gonna get it sort but then when we look into it a bite more yeah once you start show sign game over
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	you can't cure it it's
S0235	yeah you're right
S0192	you're gonna die
S0236	mm
S0198	yeah once it's penetrate you
S0192	do you have as well
S0235	they're allergic to water aren't they
S0192	water yeah it's acrophobia

S0235	yeah it's just that
S0236	one on your phone
S0235	yeah yeah yeah that 's
S0236	mm in a guitar
S0198	but you have to keep retuning it like a guitar when you first get it so yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah the well it's it's a
S0198	even if it's a good instrument
S0235	we've erm so she would like a student instrument like this like
S0198	yeah
S0235	the to me like quite they're not you know this isn't erm as when you say it be gonna it be like a i can say it cos 's not here like a cheap shitty violin like it's not it's a half decent violin
S0198	yeah i don't know how much he pay for it
S0235	you can do that because of the peg
S0198	ah okay
S0235	because they're like the cheap ones tend to be plastic
S0198	oh okay yeah
S0235	and still they actually wood which be quite cool
S0198	ah yeah
S0235	but when you you might wanna just take it to
S0198	yeah
S0235	someone just to but what you can do you could erm go for a lesson
S0198	yeah yeah just to get the
S0235	er and i mean it's more
S0198	they'll tune it up
S0235	yeah and they'll just like put it all in it will probably take like probably it'll take about half an hour maybe not that long just because what's happen be like i be show it to so you've get like the little hole
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	so like the the string need to go through that hole and then like twist round and then
S0198	oh which be
S0235	it's a
S0198	it's hard to do
S0235	it's really and it won't so bad but because
S0236	you're blind as a bat
S0235	oh no it's not that
S0198	so it's get more isn't she blinder
S0235	it's because it's the erm because it's the eighth string it's
S0198	oh
S0236	let me have a look
S0235	really fiddy its right at the very back
S0236	oh god i can do it
S0198	get it in the
S0235	no he can do it so it
S0236	the string
S0198	don't you have your glass er
S0235	mm
S0198	sorry i call you as soon as your sister phone i'm like call you by a different name
S0235	so you like take it out you see that little hole
S0236	oh yeah yeah
S0235	so that need to go all through there
S0198	oh
S0235	and then you twist it
S0236	through where sorry
S0198	do you know what you i so do you
S0235	through that
S0236	oh yeah
S0198	do you need your glass for
S0235	long distance
S0236	long distance
S0198	long distance so you're short sight
S0235	yeah
S0198	do you know what your eye be in either side
S0235	well i just they're exactly the same
S0198	oh what be that
S0235	i think it's one point five or point five
S0198	oh that's nice
S0235	or something like that
S0198	oh yeah they're quite small still my eye be this one's minus er four point two five and this one's
S0235	oh really
S0198	three point seven five they're really really that's really bad like my lenses be like this thick if i actually have my glass
S0235	you wear contact lenses don't you
S0198	but i get use yeah i do wear them erm
S0235	i'm
S0198	yours still feel stronger than that though i wonder if we just like juxtapose i don't know they feel stronger
S0235	do you get your glass you er
S0198	my contact in yeah yeah
S0235	but that affect it
S0198	well no it should just give me the it should be the same as me put on
S0235	oh as if you be
S0198	normal side yeah not more than anything on your glass
S0235	yeah
S0198	but usually i do it to people to see them i'm usually like oh like i put them on my nephews the other day and i be like he doesn't need to wear glass like
S0235	no
S0198	you know when you be really like when i be wear lenses my brothers everyone get persuade to wear glass and then you you wear them all the time and your eye can get worse so they just get worse anyway or you don't wear them and your eye never really get any worse and i tell my brother
S0235	oh
S0198	don't make them cos start wear them all the time and he really doesn't need them and i be try to stop him from do that because i think it will weaken his eye rather than help him but yeah when i put yours on i could notice quite a big difference
S0235	yeah it be like
S0236	oh what's this thing
S0198	but yeah i wear lenses like
S0235	and they get worse if i've wear them all day
S0198	not to see people i don't usually if i'm not see or go anywhere
S0236	have you get a thin thing
S0235	what's a thin thing
S0236	well something that's thin enough to go in there and manipulate that wire
S0235	no er
S0236	something thin thin or thin
S0198	like a pair of tweezers or something more
S0236	yeah a pair of tweezers would be lovely
S0198	yeah i don't know if a pair of tweezers would work
S0235	you need erm
S0198	maybe i have something up there
S0236	oh
S0235	that's so strange i've never see this before
S0236	what
S0235	well normally these hole here have erm like this and they're like fine tune so what happen be like when it go out of tune you if it go out a lot then you can do it by the peg but if it's a
S0236	little
S0235	small yeah like fine tune you do it with these bottom peg
S0198	oh yeah
S0235	cos it's only get one for the eighth string you don't have one for the other string but i've i'm not say that be wrong i'm just say that i haven't see that before
S0198	oh but you've never see that before oh that's so that could be it could be
S0235	no so mine have
S0198	yeah it's get one for each
S0235	yeah so so you just can find
S0198	so you might find that these wooden peg don't mean much
S0235	no not necessarily it might be that because i've only ever deal with mine and mine's get plastic peg
S0198	yeah
S0235	but plastic slip
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0235	be a lot easier so you they don't tend to you have to make a big difference with them for them to really hold so that's maybe why but i mean
S0198	oh yeah
S0235	it's get the fine tune eighth string so there must be a reason for it
S0198	something else
S0235	because someone's obviously tune
S0236	yeah
S0235	or like string string it string it i don't know
S0236	string string it
S0198	oh that seem quite good though as it's level four i'd love to hear you play
S0235	oh no that be terrible
S0198	and next time i'm home next time i'm in i'm gonna make you play the violin
S0235	it's really it be so awful
S0198	i don't
S0235	no that's that's a good thing probably
S0198	yeah it's get no damp oh the damp
S0235	it's a fuck shithole erm
S0198	i'm sure it's not a shithole
S0235	it really be i hate it
S0198	oh
S0235	the whole of downstairs for us be a complete write off
S0236	mm
S0198	ah
S0235	like i hate it it's so bad
S0198	where be the kitchen
S0236	could you just hold
S0235	because it's that and often it's upstairs and through the top floor be fine
S0198	where be the kitchen then
S0235	on the middle floor
S0198	oh be it oh it's three floor
S0235	yeah
S0198	oh

S0235	yeah it be but it's just
S0236	well it's a panel house yeah
S0198	yeah yeah
S0236	yeah it's
S0235	awkwardly

S0235	yeah and because the basement be below grind level almost like the street be erm to the window i suppose of of the basement
S0198	ah okay
S0235	it's kind of like a basement so it's really cold and
S0198	be that the grind floor

S0235	yeah you need to put it in that hole and then you can twist it or see the peg go backwards erm
S0236	twist backwards
S0235	yeah so you tight them by turn them like this way
S0236	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	do that make sense erm i'm sure that's pretty much what i'd do i could've put that but i didn't yeah so and then the middle floor you have like the kitchen and the live room and then you go downstairs and you've get like a little kind of annexy erm sheddy kind of thing erm and then like a porch i guess
S0236	oh

S0198	what floor be the bathrooms on
S0235	on the grind floor

S0235	ah see doesn't like wash up so doesn't do it either
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah exactly that be very typical
S0236	yeah we get a wash machine after a while
S0192	i i hate that even more
S0198	have you get a dishwasher
S0192	i hate dishwashers
S0236	yeah dishwashers that's it
S0192	because you end up do it twice
S0198	i ten year dish into the wash machine
S0235	no but it's
S0236	yeah
S0192	you the problem with the dishwasher be
S0198	break up glass
S0192	you end up do it twice you wash the dish to put them in the dishwasher
S0236	yeah but you you you
S0198	yeah
S0236	and er
S0192	to then stick it to then unstack it and then put it in
S0198	no you don't have to you don't have to
S0192	it seem like more work to me which be why we end up wash up
S0236	no yeah no you can't expect like make sure it's clean as well
S0198	get a dishwasher
S0192	i don't want one
S0198	no okay
S0236	i can't agree with him when you start use it it work out
S0235	you need to get on the cook
S0236	cheaper as well that's the only reason cos we have it when we first move out
S0192	a wash machine be cheaper than just do it
S0198	dishwasher
S0236	yeah
S0192	a dishwasher it's still a wash machine
S0235	it's a wash machine but
S0198	oh yes but we call it wash machine or wash machine
S0236	mm
S0192	it's a dishwashing machine
S0235	yeah
S0198	it's a silly name isn't it the wash machine
S0235	when we live in and then they say that
S0236	cos i say that they they do need a freezer then they start use it and their bill
S0235	break down yeah it really break down
S0198	yeah
S0235	but we're fuck anyway now cos we're on a meter
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0236	mm mm
S0192	no no we don't even know what's go on with that water
S0198	no we our like our the water company we're for half an hour
S0192	it still doesn't get through to it
S0236	mm
S0192	then i mention it to a plumber and they be like
S0198	but when we go outside and check and she be like she doesn't think that we be and we be just we be five on five
S0192	i'm like we're like a or something
S0235	really
S0198	i don't think that they can put some more water
S0236	mm
S0192	yeah there's five in this one build
S0235	that's whom you say
S0192	one two three four five
S0198	two three four five yeah
S0235	be it the one in the roof
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	and they must be quiet big as they've get the whole big
S0198	it be a double front house it's not like
S0192	yeah so
S0235	oh yeah no no no i get the four
S0192	what we've get
S0235	but i i think like
S0198	and there's one upstairs too
S0192	but actually this flat
S0235	they must have like a
S0192	get the raw deal because the two bottom ones get a garden
S0198	no only this one get the garden
S0192	no
S0198	oh they get
S0192	they get can't you see the garden outside
S0198	oh they get oh that's the other part
S0192	yeah that's the other part that's the other garden so the two bottom ones get a garden we get the little balcony and a little bite more space
S0235	mm
S0192	cos here we've get the extra space but theirs they're miss this alleyway bite and they're miss the balcony
S0198	cos they're
S0235	but would they not just be
S0192	so it must be quite small
S0198	they haven't get this extension
S0235	reverse
S0192	they've get yes they do
S0198	oh they do oh yeah yeah yeah
S0192	if you look out of the window you can see there's another window
S0198	oh yeah it's quite small
S0235	so wouldn't theirs just be the reverse to yours
S0192	but we just have the yes minus from the front door through to the balcony because that's our extra bite
S0198	yeah they wouldn't have that section yeah yeah
S0192	cos we get the balcony so they're miss about that width
S0235	oh
S0192	a lot
S0198	yeah bedroom
S0192	so theirs be smaller than our apartment basically they'll be miss that strip from the front door width to the balcony
S0235	but then the people downstairs be probably pay like an extra fifty quid a month for that
S0192	probably
S0198	yeah cos they have the maybe
S0192	mm and to tell you honestly this be enough of a garden for us
S0198	but
S0236	mm
S0192	we have a nice big window the sun come in
S0198	the garden be right next to the kitchen with our plant
S0192	i feel like it's this be our balcony that's our garden in there yeah but if we be in here i couldn't sit out there and smoke i'd feel really conscious of people
S0236	mm
S0192	look down on me
S0236	mm
S0192	for like whatever that be
S0198	i mean we wouldn't
S0236	yeah when we have a garden in we never use it
S0235	yeah yeah you don't you never use it
S0236	cos half of the time be winter and when
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	half of the time it's shitty english weather so
S0198	and it's
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0198	when it's rain i just don't
S0236	but i mean it's nice in the summer but the by the time summer roll around cos you leave it cos winter
S0192	yeah
S0198	it just grow over the summer
S0235	cos it's like
S0192	and this be perfect because we feel like we're sit outside but if it rain
S0236	mm
S0192	you don't get wet
S0235	you've get the window yeah
S0198	yeah it's cos it's get sash windows there if they be normal windows they only open a little bite don't they
S0192	mm
S0235	mm
S0192	they're a bite noisy though and they're not very good in the winter
S0198	and they're not very good in the winter
S0235	yeah that's true
S0236	no you need to put some of the stuff
S0192	yeah
S0235	it's gonna terrible like that yeah
S0192	to be honest i think i mean we
S0198	we just put a blanket
S0192	we live in korea with no heat and it get down to minus ten pretty consistently there like we it be see your breath in your house
S0198	minus twenty
S0192	it get up to minus twenty yeah
S0198	that one year yeah
S0192	yeah about to minus twenty but like i mean it doesn't get below about minus ten in england do it i don't think ever maybe minus seven or
S0236	yeah
S0198	it's usually in the it's still usually like
S0235	yeah it's normally single digits
S0198	but your dad make your dad make a very good point
S0236	yeah
S0235	the worst have be like minus ten
S0198	of say england be a much damper cold
S0192	it be yeah yeah
S0235	yeah
S0198	and that make a bite different
S0192	but damp at two degrees it's probably the same as minus ten degrees in
S0198	it's not necessarily the cold it's the way the cold feel
S0192	yeah
S0198	and i can tell even today's be like like a cooler day
S0192	mm
S0198	i mean there's a dampness to the air that korea doesn't have
S0192	they don't need another temperature chart cos they're always like ah it's twenty five but feel like seventeen
S0236	mm
S0192	because of the wind well it's not twenty five then be it
S0198	no
S0235	it's seventeen
S0192	so and it's like yeah it's minus ten but you know it actually feel like two or something well that's not the real temperature then be it
S0235	yeah
S0192	tell us what it feel like not what it be but feel like something else
S0198	yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	it's probably strange
S0198	but yeah
S0192	it be cold but so we we live a couple of winter see our breath and we just think we would always have a duvet around we sit on the sofa with the duvet
S0236	mm
S0198	we do have access to heat but we just didn't wanna pay for it
S0192	it's too expensive
S0236	mm
S0192	i didn't wanna pay for it and we'll probably do the same here i mean you guy come and visit we'll turn the heat on whatever but
S0236	mm
S0192	like if it's us
S0198	i mean the storage heat stay the same so
S0235	you don't have to turn the heat on
S0192	come on we're twenty eight
S0235	they're pretty good
S0236	mm
S0192	we don't have to live with a jumper on
S0198	i don't know
S0235	yeah if you
S0192	be they good storages
S0235	yeah i think storage heating's mean to be quite good aren't they
S0198	they're mean to be economical like you put
S0235	yeah
S0198	them on at night when the electricity be on a cheaper tariff and then it's mean to store the heat
S0235	yeah
S0198	for half of the rest of the day
S0192	but who want the heat on at night
S0198	well it keep it warm
S0192	the only time you the only time you want the heat on
S0235	yeah it just stay it's like a big cylinder block and you just turn it on
S0198	yeah yeah when you're cold
S0192	yeah yeah like a brick or something
S0198	i'm sure if you turn it on at anytime of the day
S0236	mm
S0192	i'm sure the only time you really want heat be when you wake up in the morning
S0235	mm
S0236	yeah
S0192	and then
S0236	when you go to sleep
S0192	probably when you go to bed like an hour or two before you go to bed
S0236	mm
S0192	once you're in bed you're fine you don't need the heat on
S0236	mm
S0235	no
S0192	but like that bite when you get into bed be freeze cold or whatever
S0198	it's nice to have it at that time the central heat but
S0235	yeah
S0198	obviously that
S0192	but this thing if you put that on at night you'll be good in the morning but come the even it's not gonna work it's gonna be like
S0192	run out

S0235	yeah be really good
S0198	yeah
S0192	i rarely watch movies that i think that be really good
S0198	we even saw oh sorry i
S0192	but i really like erm the last movie that i think and it's terribly stereotypical cos it's fuck tarantino but i think django unchain be really good
S0235	yeah django be really
S0192	and
S0236	anything tarantino make it be fuck
S0198	i know it be stereotypical
S0236	especially the basterds what's his name
S0235	christopher waltz
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah he's
S0192	i really like inglorious basterds
S0236	christopher waltz be he chritopher waltz be he the
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah the nazi who's come for his
S0235	yeah
S0192	yeah yeah
S0236	he's just too good just he can speak three languages well and act
S0192	yeah
S0236	like a beast
S0192	he's he's also in inglorious basterds isn't he
S0198	which be why the film be like
S0192	he's the guy like when they're underneath the
S0235	he's the dentist
S0236	he say i can't speak any more french why don't we speak in english
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah he's fuck good yeah he's really good
S0236	yeah he's fuck amaze
S0198	he's film like that
S0192	i like any tarantino
S0198	well that be a good fuck film
S0192	pretty much
S0235	yeah i mean
S0236	mm
S0198	it's hard to find anything else
S0192	because i need in a film i need
S0236	mm
S0192	dialogue and i need good fuck dialogue so
S0236	mm
S0192	when i watch all a lot of modern movies if it's mostly action i'm not gonna enjoy it
S0236	mm
S0192	it's the plain truth i don't like it
S0235	yeah no i think
S0198	that's the odd thing that we'll like it for what it be
S0192	i need good dialogue
S0198	or if we're on the right mood we'll
S0192	we quite like snowpiercer only because er do you see that one
S0236	no
S0198	yeah it's a shame it's really
S0192	erm kind of sci fi movie about like the world's end and there's this trade it's similar to a bunch of concepts
S0236	mm
S0192	but it have some korean actors in it and it come out in korea
S0198	it be really big in korea
S0192	about six months before it come out in england strangely even though it be like er an american movie i think american korean movie that be actually quite good again quirky act decent act decent script
S0198	i like the dialogue yeah
S0192	decent dialogue and an interest
S0198	be limit at the same time
S0192	of course there's gonna be hole in it it's a one and half hour movie you can't
S0236	mm
S0192	ever make a good the problem for me be the whole format i don't think you can tell a story in an hour and a half particularly but i never like short
S0198	and there'll be an extent of two hours and forty minutes
S0192	i
S0198	but if it's the wrong film it's like
S0192	mm i like i do creative write
S0235	yeah
S0198	an hour
S0192	and i never like short stories cos i just felt like you couldn't really get it out and i feel the same about movies i love series but movies be just a bite shallow for me i don't feel like you can really get enough in it whereas like tarantino's movies be usually two to three hours and it get more out not so much happen and there's just more talk
S0236	mm
S0198	i guess it's just appreciate different form and
S0235	yeah it's get more dialogue
S0192	yeah and that's what i like basically anything with a lot of dialogue i'm usually
S0236	that's what tarantino's good at talk
S0198	they don't necessarily
S0235	yeah he's like
S0236	he can make two people talk wicked
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	really good yeah yeah
S0236	like the french guy and the nazi
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	they're just talk
S0192	yeah
S0236	but then they go through three languages what they're say be wicked
S0192	yeah
S0236	and this like little stupid
S0192	as it's a clear
S0236	joke and like
S0198	the dialogue yeah
S0236	he's like massive fun
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	yeah ridiculous fun
S0192	i don't need transformers or you know the science fiction ones or anything like that
S0235	yeah yeah
S0236	or even transformers would've be good cos obviously i i be bear in the eighties and like i watch transformers it would've be good if it be about transformers but it's not it's about these moronic people wander around when this transformer's in the background
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	do shit you can't make out you gotta squint and what's that oh it's just look like a metal mush of cgi shite
S0198	yeah yeah it hurt your eye
S0192	er no it give me a headache when i can't watch it
S0236	yeah it's cos it's just shit go on and
S0192	and we normally go in a bite drink so it's kinda like
S0236	if it just make what a transformer's not human just make transformers
S0235	yeah it's true
S0198	but we cos the cinema be cheap in korea so we get the habit of go in drink
S0192	we quite like that matthew mcconaughey leonardo dicaprio movie
S0198	which mean some of the movies we criticise maybe it be because
S0192	what be that
S0236	wolf of wallstreet wolf of wallstreet
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	yeah but then that be er er er
S0198	scorsese yeah exactly
S0235	scorsese
S0236	scorsese yeah scorsese
S0192	that be alright again yeah
S0236	it can't go wrong
S0192	yeah again
S0235	yeah never see a bad film
S0198	yeah yeah yeah that be funny actually
S0236	even er the depart
S0192	erm the depart be good
S0198	cos in korea like er film like be we be surprise that in korea they be show them
S0236	yeah have you see that er infernal
S0192	no
S0198	but obviously some big hollywood film would come to korea

S0235	ahh
S0198	it's not very common with this type of film

S0235	mm
S0192	you know arty kind of movies it be like a swiss film crew follow this postal killer that go around and he he the killer's like very you know kind of charismatic and like he's talk like to the the camera and stuff but he basically go round and steal from old women and rap them and stuff and like it's pretty graphic and stuff and he eventually go on and he kill the film crew like the the that's in it but it's quite a dark movie i remember like that when

S0235	i never really like city of men though
S0236	no it wasn't as good it wasn't as good
S0192	i never saw it that be a sequel
S0198	ah yeah i never saw it either
S0192	be there a series or something
S0235	there be like a tv series

S0192	no the remake be call metathesis it's in spanish
S0198	yeah with mexican character
S0235	ohh
S0192	it's for for a mexican audience
S0198	it's character yeah
S0235	really
S0192	same story same character same everything
S0198	it's really bizarre
S0192	google it have a look and the the trailer for it be exactly the same but with different people
S0235	that's so weird
S0198	they just like we can captilise it it's gonna work really work then
S0236	mm
S0192	it's the same thing but it's call metástasis
S0198	the spanish community
S0192	it's call metástasis which be spanish for cancer i guess so maybe it be
S0235	god that's really odd
S0236	mm
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	i'm quite excite about it because i like to speak spanish and i kinda wanna brush up on it
S0198	so maybe the story
S0235	the story
S0192	and i like and i like break bad so i've get some of
S0236	cos there're some mexicans in break bad aren't they
S0192	exactly
S0198	yeah yeah exactly
S0236	cos they they're go over the boarder so when they go when the boarder bite come in
S0198	they even have some senior
S0192	but the the confusion be yeah what's that we can tell the americans
S0198	i know
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah yeah i be gonna say they can they can like
S0236	cos that be a big part of it that they can't tell wasn't it
S0198	the be like the american mafia or something
S0235	no it's cos they don't speak much in portuguese
S0192	no they could
S0236	yeah
S0198	yeah they could go into guatemala or something like that
S0192	no the cartel would be like guatemala
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	do you know what i mean they could in mexico and they're go to guatemala or so but
S0198	or el salvador or something yeah that's true
S0192	that be pretty sketchy when we be there we go to some pretty like as far as it's mean to go fairly risky countries that be in that area i don't know if you know much about el salvador but it's get a lot of gang problems and like
S0236	mm
S0192	it's mean to be one of the like the worst gang countries there
S0198	oh el salvador be actually quite friendly
S0192	free lift all over the place in the whole region but i mean
S0198	free all over the place
S0236	mm
S0192	definitely in that region in central america
S0198	guatemala be the the
S0192	i have a guy on the bus live in he just like live like a
S0198	oh i don't care that's a nice girl i don't know why you're show the
S0192	and i'm like alright cool i don't know why you're do that but that's fine we have a big black woman throw
S0198	we'd be like
S0192	stand at us and like rock at us and like shout at us and shit
S0198	it wasn't just at us it be like at everyone
S0192	she be just crazy i don't know
S0198	that be that be in honduras
S0192	she be definitely shout at us she be shout at us
S0198	that be in honduras
S0192	i have another guy on the coast of honduras i go to step on like a wooden jetty you know what i mean like
S0236	mm
S0192	where a boat be or something
S0235	mm
S0192	it look really shabby go to step on it a guy come out with a shotgun and he's like point it at me
S0198	no that's just for the patrons at this tower
S0192	tell me in spanish like you've gotta get the fuck off that thing and that be basically like you're gonna shoot me if i stand on this wooden jetty you know
S0198	but he be in that it be a dodgy part of the coastline so anyone stay in that hotel probably want gun protection
S0192	there be a lot of like military police with like big machine gun
S0198	bakeries be arm
S0192	on the back of cars and stuff yeah people protect bakeries with machine gun with like it it be crazy
S0235	oh my god good pasty though i would kill for the pasty
S0198	yeah yeah i know i know exactly
S0192	yeah a nice
S0198	the worst one er no the worst just like the one thing that you're not mean to do be go through guatemala city on the local bus
S0192	mm
S0198	because the local bus there're gang and stuff
S0192	i mean the crime rate guatemala city have like one of the highest crime rat in the world which i only find out afterwards
S0236	mm
S0192	i didn't know that before
S0198	but no we know we weren't mean to go on this bus but we know like we get off the city bus like a city
S0192	inter city bus
S0198	inter city bus that arrive arrive at the city and like the the quickest cheapest thing for us to do be to get on a local bus
S0192	take a local bus
S0198	to get to the next bus to get out of the city
S0192	it be so gangster it be like run by gangsters
S0198	this the bus be the bus have be black out
S0192	the bus be like all paint black and like
S0198	inside with like
S0192	it's all like gangster music and shit
S0198	gangster music and the guy run the bus be all fuck gangsters arm and shit and they be just like you know
S0192	i be like well this bus be crazy
S0198	imagine be on a red london bus but completely gangster
S0235	but do you get on this bus
S0198	no yeah yeah we get on the bus
S0192	yeah we ride in it for a while
S0198	thankfully some other guy
S0192	they be really friendly this guy help us
S0236	mm
S0198	yeah
S0192	he take us off the bus and take us to the other bus stop where we have to wait there at the bus stop
S0198	he be with a he be with the bus that we arrive with someone's get on and then he get off he get off with us and get us on the next bus
S0192	but everything in your lonely planet so do not take local transport
S0236	mm
S0192	before he pop on to whatever bus but i mean like the people that live there have to catch these city bus
S0192	yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	and we think that we be gonna travel like normal people we be not
S0198	but it's because like it's because mug and like gang crime be so high that you it's not recommend
S0192	we be tell that there be load of americans we meet be like guatemala man it's the fuck place
S0236	mm
S0192	it's the indo euro of central america you know you've gotta go to guatemala
S0198	guatemala yeah
S0192	and we actually have our worst time in guatemala didn't we
S0198	yeah well i think americans be
S0192	beautiful country load of amaze place but like so many americans that've come from here they're not travel in our eye properly they're not take local transport
S0236	mm
S0192	they're take tourist bus they're not stay in the local place they're stay in one guest house everyone together
S0198	they're stay in like the local kind of hostels
S0236	mm
S0192	so like we basically we discover it at the end of our trip we be quite poor we be probably get a bite cabin fever we be try to quit smoke we argue a bite like as it be get on at this point
S0236	mm
S0192	and it be like we want to meet people but we didn't have enough money to stay at the expensive tourist place so we be stay with all the local people there's no foreigners anywhere
S0236	mm
S0192	and then they're tell us this place be really cool and like i get into arguments with the local people cos they be real fuck arseholes i find the local people there
S0198	they be just really try to rape you
S0192	to be
S0236	mm
S0192	real assholes compare to
S0198	and then we find them
S0192	mexico there be really nice people but guatemala we actually get kind of rob at machete point in we get feed up with people tell us like you can't walk here you can't hike that you can't do this
S0198	you're gonna get mug yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	and for a while we kinda follow it and
S0198	you need to pay for this you need to pay for that you need to pay this
S0192	and be like okay in the end it be just like fuck it you know i'm here i wanna walk around
S0236	mm
S0192	i'm sure it's fine i speak enough spanish we'll be careful we won't take any shit with us and this one time we hike and what really piss us off in latin america they charge for everything and
S0198	no latin america in general the south
S0192	central sorry south be better central be like you wanna hike up this beautiful mountain okay i'll pay a little price but they'll charge you like twenty dollars or something and it's only like two dollars for a meal so twenty dollars be a lot of fuck money
S0236	mm
S0192	and like i think we pay like five to ten dollars this time no the first time we didn't pay and there's about half way point or a third of the way up you could go and there's this cross and you get a beautiful view of the lake and you're already like four thousand metres or something you're very very high up and we didn't pay and we scrabble up this really dangerous like cliff i suppose it be we manage to get up there and we
S0198	rather than take the path we just go up
S0192	we didn't pay so we just kinda take our own route and it be really skecthy
S0198	and i be like nod that
S0192	kinda say right we won't do that again but we wanna go right to the top
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0192	so we'll do this again and we'll pay so we pay it's about a three four hour hike up to the top we get to the top and there's this guy up there and he's like ah hi okay we kind of ingored him we haden't see anyone else on the whole hike and then he's like oh yeah you need to pay erm i pour out my ticket and i go no no no i already pay for that i pay down there it be quite expensive i'm not pay again
S0236	mm
S0192	and the guy be like no no no you pay this village but you need to pay my village you've get to pay here
S0198	and we live back there like the other side
S0236	mm
S0192	and we live on the other side of the town you've get to pay us and it's the same price again another ten dollars per person or something and i be like no i'm not gonna pay so we kinda walk on he follow us and he be like he start pull out his phone he start ring people he's like i'm call my friends you have to pay this money we're not let you down effectively until you pay this fuck money and he get to this point where there be a very thin path and he block he come in between and i and he come in between us and then just i didn't see the machete before but
S0198	no no
S0192	he just have this machete in his hand 's here and i'm here and he's tell me my friends be come and you gotta pay this fuck money and i end up what do i give him like two dollars or something i wave some money at him and he go to grab it and i pour it back and i be like you give me my girl and then you have the fuck money
S0198	i be quite cheap really
S0235	yeah that's a real bargain
S0192	well i just no i just i didn't wanna give him a lot but i have some cash in my pocket so i kinda
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	and he go to grab it and i manage to do an exchange
S0236	mm
S0198	and i don't think
S0192	and we just run down the mountain
S0236	mm
S0192	we didn't i don't think he'd've stab us or anything
S0198	yeah i think like he be
S0192	he want to rob us
S0198	there's a lot of there's a lot of
S0235	mm
S0198	there's a lot of problems in like poor place of course that when tourists start to all go to one place because it's recommend then the rest of all the other poor villages aren't see any of that money
S0192	mm
S0235	yeah
S0198	and they get really quite envious of that so they try to get money from them
S0192	we understand we understand
S0198	but half of that problem be because people will just follow things like lonely planet and they'll go to that one place whereas you could go to
S0192	mm
S0198	these numerous place but no one fuck do
S0235	yeah
S0198	cos they wanna stay with all the other fuck tourists
S0192	yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	the problem with central america be the price be really bump up because americans didn't give a shit about how much things cost they don't know
S0236	mm
S0192	that it's only two dollars for a meal
S0198	we stay like
S0192	so they don't care that the bus be twelve dollars
S0236	mm
S0192	i mean twelve dollars doesn't sound like a lot of money but actually the bus be only two dollars
S0236	mm
S0192	but they're rip you off like mad because they know that most people don't give a shit but for us
S0235	yeah
S0236	yeah
S0192	it be like we just start live
S0198	we just at that point
S0192	like a local and use local money you can't and pay my budget's only twenty dollars
S0236	mm
S0192	so twelve dollars on this
S0236	mm
S0192	three hour bus be kinda ridiculous so we have a real problem there didn't we we i start to get a bite worry that it be us that we've be travel for too long and we're not you know we're in a bad mood but as soon as we cross into mexico we have a great time and everyone be really friendly
S0198	yeah
S0192	and we have a really nice time i don't think it be us
S0198	mexico be much better
S0192	i think it be
S0198	no it be only guatemala that really test
S0192	it be but americans love the place
S0198	honduras be
S0235	yeah
S0192	they're like it's a real place it's guatemala so
S0235	i can imagine that kind of just happen or it doesn't you know a few
S0236	yeah like

S0198	that's exactly what our friend cos er his dad's act as military but he's be private contract him since they go to iran
S0236	mm mm

S0198	yeah yeah and they pay you a lot to be out there
S0236	i mean the american get like er kfcs and mcdondald's stuff but

S0236	they've get a cup of tea
S0192	a canteen
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0235	yeah a canteen where they bacon butties
S0236	so they say like people
S0198	if you're lucky
S0192	if if if you go to the middle east i mean we will be earn about two k maybe two and a half ks so that's twenty five grand a year or something but you can apparently save eighty per cent of what you earn there
S0198	so you're not they pay for your accommodation
S0192	so you can save like fifteen hundred pound
S0198	you're not spend money on
S0192	sixteen hundred pound a month
S0235	no but yeah the thing that i mean like in the middle east and stuff
S0192	but 's gonna have to wear a burkha
S0235	yeah you can't like you can't buy alcohol
S0236	there's a lot of restrictions
S0192	yeah you can't smoke
S0235	you can't drink out there
S0198	yeah
S0192	you can't smoke you can't drink
S0198	it depend on the country
S0192	no yeah you may
S0198	in the middle east
S0192	erm
S0198	some countries you can get
S0235	dubai bahrain
S0192	dubai bahrain they're a little bite more liberal
S0198	in some countries you can get a foreigner permit and you can
S0235	but then
S0192	but the problem you're gonna go to the middle east
S0235	yeah
S0198	saudi
S0192	this be why
S0235	but then still we're talk about get a a permit to buy alcohol you're not gonna be like out drink every friday
S0192	no no
S0198	oh of course not no no but that's fine that might do us a favour actually
S0192	but we know that we need to calm down
S0235	so it's gonna be yeah but that's what i mean like you're gonna save
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	shit load of money on that
S0192	but that
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0192	that's really we're not particularly traditional that's the main reason that we're get engage really it be we be talk before and like we we've speak
S0198	sorry i've get it
S0236	no no it's fine
S0192	we've speak about marriage quite a bite and
S0235	mm
S0192	this time it actually get to the point where we be talk about practicalities of marriage
S0236	mm
S0235	mm
S0192	who would come where we'd do it how much it would cost when we'd do it and at this point i kind of think that's really not very romantic be it like we're just gonna get marry but this so i kinda think i should propose do something at least a bite romantic while we're travel and then if we have a really shit cheap wed it doesn't really matter for us cos we're gonna get marry anyway
S0235	no no no yeah
S0192	that's why i propose i mean
S0198	yeah yeah it be a surprise there wasn't any reason to propose
S0192	obviously but but erm we may never get marry if we get a job in kazakhstan and it doesn't require it or whatever and they have good job in kazakhstan then we won't need it but if we go to the middle east
S0198	yeah they have good job in kazakhstan
S0192	then we will probably get marry next april or may
S0198	i don't think we have enough experience for the good job in kazakhstan
S0235	it might be like a good if you know it might be a good thing just to do and like go away
S0198	just yeah yeah yeah
S0235	if you're like engage and in your mind you're marry anyway like
S0198	for us
S0235	it might be a good thing just to do because then
S0192	yeah
S0198	for us that we're abroad all the time it's always better to be like marry
S0192	how much more marry can you get we have joint bank account
S0236	mm
S0192	we live together every day
S0235	yeah
S0192	we've live together for nine years
S0235	and then there's isn't it
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	we live abroad
S0235	it's like me and er me and have be together a long time
S0192	you guy be marry
S0236	mm
S0198	do you have anything in england it's like a legal
S0236	yeah tax break cos david cameron's er
S0235	you get tax break if you're marry
S0236	bollock things
S0192	but do you get any kind of recognition for be
S0198	but do you get anything like cos in canada and in
S0235	no
S0198	in canada i know for sure that
S0192	it's over seven years
S0198	if you've be together for over seven years then you're legally a partnership
S0236	oh right
S0235	yeah you we're consider
S0236	there's similar things but we don't get our tax break or anything like that
S0235	yeah you don't get tax break if i there're certain things like if die i'd inherit his shit if i die inherit my shit
S0192	uh watch out
S0198	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0198	oh she want your dvds
S0235	's get
S0192	she want your dvds
S0235	's 's get a lot more to leave me
S0236	's get a car she's get some other shit
S0192	it's a multi game now
S0235	yeah
S0236	yeah
S0235	so if i die under suspicious circumstances erm but apart from that and i don't even know how it would work i think as well like because we've live in like share house and we haven't necessarily be register as those house like i don't know if in term of like
S0198	if it count legally
S0235	legal like we might actually be
S0192	yeah
S0198	if you can that
S0192	be able to
S0235	be two years or something that
S0192	yeah
S0235	i don't know
S0192	we we find a joke that in an islamic country the fact that we've be together for nine years count for nothing
S0236	mm
S0235	mm
S0192	but if we get marry if we be marry for a month
S0198	a christian marriage
S0192	with a christian marriage that apparently hold some weight but
S0235	yeah it be it's just how it be it's to like keep the church go
S0236	it's more like
S0192	we've be this yeah i agree
S0198	yeah and it's
S0192	we've be so pragmatic about marriage that you might not even change your name because it's only forty pound to get marry it's a hundred pound to change your passport so like it triple the price of the wed just to
S0235	yeah
S0192	change your passport and i'd feel bad as well because we're kinda like collect stamp in our passports and suddenly you have this brand new passport and nothing's in there
S0235	eventually you'll have to get a new passport
S0198	anyway
S0192	we already have yeah we get through our first one and like we have to get a new one
S0198	we buy a bumper one acutally that's quite big
S0192	we have we get like a bumper one and like a bigger one
S0235	oh
S0192	what's the joke though be that we finish our passports early and we didn't quite finish it there be a few page leave but quite often they stipulate you need like five page leave or something for them to let you in
S0236	mm
S0192	so we get a bumper passport pay for an extra twenty page or something and then they're like oh because you finish your other passport early we're gonna give you an extra nine months or something so i actually we actually ten years and nine months but
S0235	oh
S0192	time's not the issue
S0236	mm
S0192	space be the issue but i i
S0235	yeah
S0192	think it's not gonna last ten years and nine months so
S0198	just give me more page
S0192	just give me more page
S0236	mm
S0192	up until recently americans could have page add at a consulate for free
S0198	yeah yeah they do often
S0236	oh really
S0192	they just go to the consulate and get page put into their passport no worry but they've just change that and now they don't
S0198	yeah yeah they do it often yeah we could never do that
S0192	so we didn't but we couldn't
S0198	it's like
S0235	yeah
S0192	have tell you about the pension they owe us
S0236	no
S0192	this be a bummer be british man not only be out of the five native english speak countries so you have to be a native english speak english person to teach in korea you can do it illegitimately if you're german or something like that
S0198	yeah
S0192	but really like you have to be from australia england ireland you know what i mean these kind of countries
S0198	south africa
S0192	and then basically england be the most expensive country out of all the other countries
S0236	mm
S0192	maybe australia be a little bite more expensive in certain regard but they're pay more out of all those countries we're the only one that don't have a reciprocal deal with korea whereby we refund their pension and therefore they refund our pension
S0235	oh
S0192	so we've be pay into the pension every year that we've be there every month
S0235	that suck
S0192	and they owe us five thousand pound and every other person each and every person that leave korea get give that money when they leave
S0236	mm
S0198	the worst thing about it be
S0192	and it get double fuck
S0198	yeah the worst thing be you pay in like four per cent and your company have to match that
S0192	match that and then at the end
S0198	and then at the end of it americans canadians claim
S0192	you get it
S0198	the entire eight per cent not just their money but also
S0192	so they
S0198	their school make
S0192	so they walk home with like five to ten thousand pound
S0236	mm
S0198	so they're actually double their money
S0236	oh
S0192	no worry and we don't get that
S0198	for some bizarre reason
S0192	and there's only one other people that don't get it and that's south africans but they don't have to pay
S0198	but they don't have to pay yeah yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	so they don't pay it every month but we have to pay it as brits but we don't get it back
S0198	and that's because i think it's because we have
S0235	how come that
S0192	because we don't have a reciprocal deal
S0198	i yeah a because like australia australia and america have a huge and canada huge population of koreans
S0192	of koreans england doesn't really
S0235	mm
S0198	massive millions like thousands
S0236	mm
S0198	like it's huge like england doesn't also we have national insurance
S0192	we have one pot
S0198	which completely cover all our health care and all of that kind of shit
S0192	mm nobody get a refund on national insurance nobody
S0198	obviously the rest of the the other countries don't
S0192	so
S0198	have it like that in korea it's break down the and our
S0192	you do your health care you do your pension you do your something
S0198	wag that have like our tax our health care our pension like it's break down into different fund whereas in england there's one pot so that
S0192	so we're a bite bitter about that
S0235	yeah that but then know that like you be like five grand plus like
S0198	yeah it would it would
S0192	mm mm mm
S0198	it would be nice for them to change that law or there's be huge petition and stuff
S0192	we're hop we've be do petition and like contact the government and it's
S0198	but also there's not that compare to like america's military there and stuff like that so compare to the other nations it's it's like
S0192	we
S0235	even if you give your
S0198	four thousand british people
S0235	like even if they just give you your four per cent back
S0192	mm
S0198	yeah exactly
S0192	yeah i know that's what we say just give us what i pay for
S0198	isn't that reasonable
S0235	do you know what i mean like you might just your four per cent back
S0198	i know
S0192	we have the same problem with health care there we have to pay
S0235	and that's it
S0192	about it's only about sixty pound a month into health care but then when you add it up after the four years that we've be there and you end up spend about
S0235	yeah time
S0192	two and a half grand do you know what i mean on on health care
S0198	and they never use the doctor
S0192	and the problem be in their country
S0198	and also it's subsidise so you can actually get it for free anyway
S0192	yeah yeah so you go to the doctor's
S0198	if i want to go
S0192	and you're already pay for health care but it's subsidise so you still have to pay to go and then in korea
S0198	at least the service be a little bite better
S0192	if you have anything serious and serious can just be asthma or diabetes they don't let you even live there they deport you immediately so if you get anything serious they deport you so basically we're pay this money for insurance for nothing out of the whole two it's four years we be there
S0198	it's as if you have an accident or something
S0192	i need to do you ever go to the doctor's i go once cos i have a terrible ear infection i get antibiotics
S0198	i can't remember when
S0192	but i spend about two hundred two and half grand for those antibiotics
S0198	yeah he have an infection
S0192	it be just a bite like
S0198	but you have
S0192	when you're only on fourteen grand
S0198	some like again americans think it's amaze even if it's expensive
S0192	yeah they're like wow it's so cheap but
S0235	yeah
S0198	but even with insurance we have a friend and she get appendicitis when she be there
S0192	mm
S0198	and erm she have to go into hospital for like five days or something and into a room and i think at the end
S0192	yeah like a grand or something
S0198	i think it cost her
S0192	maybe two grand
S0198	a couple of grand and she think that be incredibly cheap cos she say in america it would cost her so much more and i be like well if i need to go into a hospital in england and have anything do it's free
S0236	i don't pay for it
S0198	i don't have to worry about
S0192	yeah but that's the thing it's not we've already pay for it
S0198	with the tax yeah
S0236	yeah
S0192	we're tax out of our asses
S0198	but regardless work but i still resent the fact that i would i mean korea be deduct a small amount through my tax
S0236	yeah well
S0198	but it's
S0236	someone
S0198	but it's like yeah
S0192	yeah

S0192	no
S0198	i don't want i don't know
S0192	personally i'd rather they didn't tell us about tax and we just get money
S0236	mm
S0192	and like tax be already deduct you know what i mean i don't see it come out
S0236	yeah
S0235	you just don't know about it
S0192	it's just my pay it's

S0198	sorry i think you have a new one
S0235	no no no it's fine
S0198	shouldn't let your mouth run dry
S0192	it baffle me
S0236	mm
S0192	it baffle me why seventy million people in this unite country pay tax
S0236	mm
S0192	instead of simply tax the corporations
S0236	mm
S0192	so let's say there're seventy million people and there be twenty thousand corporations okay
S0236	mm
S0192	the only way for us to earn money be through corporations
S0236	mm
S0192	therefore instead of fuck around with seventy million people just tax
S0236	tax the
S0192	twenty thousand company
S0236	mm
S0192	and they've gotta pay me so therefore they should pay tax
S0236	they can pay yeah
S0192	yeah i don't understand why we don't just tax company or basically the company get away with pay nothing
S0236	mm
S0192	pretty much and we have to pay everything but it just seem like less work
S0236	mm
S0192	we don't need seventy million bits of paperwork
S0236	mm
S0192	we just need twenty thousand
S0236	mm
S0192	tax the company that's it and then i just get pay what i get pay
S0236	mm
S0192	the tax be already deduct and all this kind of stuff cos it's kinda depress to get your paycheck from all the work's go through that
S0236	yeah
S0192	and that's go through that i'd rather just have that already go with it
S0236	mm

S0236	mm
S0192	what be you gonna spend your money on

S0198	when you add vat
S0192	yeah seriously twenty per cent income
S0198	go on about the tax oh don't even get him start
S0192	ten per cent ni twenty per cent no but i agree with what 's say that he doesn't mind pay tax because

S0192	but
S0198	it's like they know they should never
S0192	but do you realise how much your money be spend on warfare every year
S0236	yeah yeah quite a lot
S0235	yeah yeah of course
S0192	er the amount we spend on warfare in one
S0236	mm
S0192	year

S0192	be enough to fee clothe and educate the entire world
S0236	mm yeah
S0192	one year of warfare that's it
S0235	yeah
S0192	if we just say we have an amnesty this year we're not gonna have war in fifty countries we no war this year
S0236	mm
S0192	you could fee clothe and educate the whole world the whole world
S0235	for a year
S0192	one year no well yeah i don't know the extent of that statistics
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	the statistics be yeah dubious
S0235	yeah
S0192	and not to be trust in general
S0235	yeah well no of course
S0198	no of course
S0192	but er i ignore statistics i don't like
S0198	but i do like i do agree
S0236	mm
S0192	i like statistics i do like
S0192	that's what i like you know
S0198	there shouldn't like even in like america people think korea's really cheap and stuff like that
S0192	i don't
S0198	but you do your er health the health care there be still only subsidise you still have to pay for it
S0192	mm
S0198	when i be in that that primary school in my first year one of the children have epilepsy and she have a fit and my teacher be tell me and i wasn't even in like a really rural poor area and erm she be like
S0192	we be pretty poor
S0198	they be really quite worry about the child because the mother didn't wanna she be like the mother should take her to hospital or more but she doesn't cos of the cost
S0235	mm
S0198	and even the cost be mean to be reduce it still cost and i don't think any parent should ever be in a position that they hesitate to take their child
S0192	mm
S0235	yeah
S0198	and in england no parent be ever ever in that position
S0236	no sure no
S0235	no you take your child to hospital at any
S0198	or in europe and that should be the standard you should never ever hesitate
S0236	mm
S0198	about take some especially if something's serious as epilepsy
S0192	yet conversely we have old people die because they can't afford to put their heat on you for me
S0198	of yeah really
S0192	to say that we're a first world country we have an amaze health care system yeah our utilities be through the roof
S0198	yeah no that's amaze
S0192	our public transport system be quite frankly bonkers
S0235	yeah i er yeah
S0192	it's completely bonkers
S0198	the underground how much do that shit cost lately
S0235	oh my god don't

S0236	mm
S0192	gotta stop in heathrow for four hours
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	so the journey take eight hours to get to canterbury
S0235	that make no sense
S0198	and the price be so high
S0192	so i don't like this you know say oh we're first
S0198	i i
S0192	we're develop

S0192	until utilities
S0236	we're more economically develop but but not
S0198	it's just interest cos whenever you we
S0192	until utilities be free i don't think we're develop

S0192	it's really harsh i mean if one student's like japenese
S0236	mm
S0192	or something or vietnamese or philippino or whatever
S0198	because the koreans be mark koreans be like
S0236	but it's the same in thailand and laos and er
S0198	they're all the same
S0236	aren't they quite tight knit
S0198	yeah
S0236	amongst themselves them few countries
S0192	they have quite a big history
S0198	yeah
S0236	they get this sense that they're all
S0192	around that area

S0192	there're a lot of russian prostitute
S0198	you know like all of them go to university all of them be after the best job possible no one want a farmer anymore so they they be bring in other south eastern asians er east asian nations to marry these farmers and one of my friends that be be work in one of these small place she she always go to an academy rather than a school one of the private academies they treat really badly and she have to go on like a foreigner women's trip or something and she be with a bunch of these immigrants philipine er vietnamese women and she say some of them be as young as sixteen pregnant with these like korean old farmers
S0236	fuck
S0192	they treat them like shit

S0192	there's a lot of russian prostitute as well
S0198	they really fit in a workforce
S0192	and like western girls if you
S0236	mm
S0198	just out of the immigrants but like
S0192	if you're blonde as a foreigner you'd be confuse for a russian prostitute like quite frequently
S0198	only in certain place
S0192	i mean you have be do quite often
S0198	wasn't blonde though
S0192	yeah she wasn't blonde but then there be something
S0198	there be something different about she often she's south african but there be some she be quite tall quite lenghty
S0192	south africans be sound by the way
S0236	mm
S0198	she wear like a i don't know if it be her flurry dress
S0192	just to give you an example
S0236	yeah yeah

S0235	she racist
S0236	she er what do they have er like black housekeepers and stuff
S0235	she use to have a nanny that use to yeah
S0236	and they use to because they need job we we're pay them for a fair day work
S0198	i don't think that's
S0235	yeah we have to pay them
S0236	yeah you racist do you own slave
S0235	but then they have them
S0192	i can't imagine
S0198	no none of
S0192	what it's like grow up there
S0236	mm
S0198	none of our friends be racist in south africa
S0192	i think be a little bite
S0198	
S0192	yeah i think erm
S0198	who else
S0192	be ah i get the
S0198	i don't think or be our friends
S0235	i think it's a bite
S0198	we barely hang out with them
S0192	i get i get the impression no but from what they she's
S0198	and be not racist
S0192	they're conscious in general i don't think they're racist
S0198	be dark for a start
S0192	as such but they're segregate which be a form or racism
S0235	yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0192	i think
S0235	that's the same with wasn't it it be like she wasn't actually racist
S0236	yeah when you be twenty eight you have to you you couldn't
S0235	but it be like you be bring up as like a young
S0192	they're culturally racist effectively but but they're they're racist themselves
S0235	white girl
S0198	white girl yeah yeah
S0235	like you don't get the train you don't get the tube if you can't get drive
S0192	no yeah
S0235	you don't go
S0192	that's what they're like
S0236	mm
S0235	and that's because
S0235	the it's all crow by black people who tend to be
S0192	it be yeah
S0235	the impoverish
S0198	yeah
S0192	they actually have it a little worse than that i kinda feel a little bite sorry for them cos
S0198	but i don't think that ever mention anything about colour
S0192	they really for some reason and it suck be south african there's a big difference between be south african and be a white south african
S0235	mm
S0192	there's quite a big difference
S0236	mm
S0192	but their passport be the same
S0236	mm
S0192	so if a south african want to go and live in europe that's really hard and like there're numerous place
S0198	or even to travel like
S0192	to travel numerous countries where they've they
S0192	they get she get interview all the time like
S0198	just to go to just to go to any european country
S0192	and like it's really hard to go to place
S0198	they have to go thourgh a massive visa
S0192	they're very very limit because they're south african
S0236	mm
S0192	their passport doesn't give them access
S0198	which be why a lot of them be in a lot of them
S0192	we in england have one of the best passports in the world
S0198	be in korea
S0192	we can access
S0235	that's true
S0192	because
S0236	british best in the world that's all we need to know sonny
S0198	basically
S0192	because we colonise the world basically it's ours for the day
S0236	yeah
S0198	no but
S0235	ah us and the french
S0198	there's no fear of us like suddenly
S0192	and the portuguese and spanish the dutch
S0236	mm
S0198	run off and try to live in one of these countries cos they're like well your country's fine
S0236	mm
S0198	but they yeah
S0192	no effectively we've enslave the world and we why do you think india have a a devalue currency
S0236	mm
S0192	or other we have purposefully devalue these countries' currencies and say well you know no one a p be one pound eighty european's one pound why so i can get cheap resources off of you
S0236	mm
S0192	that's it so we've purposefully make countries poor by say that your currency be not worth very much we've basically turn around and say your currency be not worth very much so it's really difficult for you to leave and come to our country but it's easy for us to buy products from your country
S0235	yeah
S0198	basically if you have a good amount of resources you're fuck
S0192	you're fuck yeah if you if you're that's why i read something interest about why america be one of the most successful countries in in the world and they believe that it's because it doesn't have many resources as a country for how much space it's get it's not particularly you know
S0198	it have some
S0192	your resources aren't particulatly ubiquitous whereas like because of that they've have to conquer other place they've have to go to other place and take their kind of stuff and it's i mean and they've get very very rich
S0198	but
S0192	minerals in latin america central america i don't know if you know much about reagan and the contra war
S0198	they're just an extension of england really
S0192	and all this kind of stuff but
S0235	no about reagan no
S0198	though there's you can't really say america it's just really an extension of
S0192	oh it's not just oh america be an extension of the british empire i don't see it in any difference but
S0198	yeah
S0192	but the same america as a country be be for thar i really like central america be a real mix of people that be we meet so many people that could i guess because they speak some english they want to talk to us but the amount of time we be on a bus for twelve hours and then some drink fucker that want to talk to us and be kind of a bite aggro
S0198	that want to practise his english
S0192	and he want to practise his english he's live in amercia for a few years they kick him out and he's try to get back in but it's not easy to get back in and that be a really common story we meet load of people that'd live there
S0198	they're on their way back up to
S0192	get kick out
S0236	mm
S0192	they wanna get back in but they're a bite bitter about the whole thing so they come off to you as kind of bitter and like aggressive and like do you know what i mean they be not happy people
S0236	mm
S0192	and i don't blame them for that but
S0235	yeah
S0192	it wasn't safe to kinda travel around because i mean the population of honduras be like four million people and there be one million of them in the state like one quarter of their entire population and that's normal for central america like a quarter of their population be at any moment live in the unite state illegally or legally
S0236	mm
S0198	trade in america's interest they have a massive massive hispanic population
S0192	they're very mix mix but segregate
S0198	yeah but
S0192	not like england we're try to explain that it's not just a dodgy area it's a dodgy street you know
S0236	mm
S0192	because we all live together so
S0236	yeah
S0198	we're so much smaller
S0192	whereas they're like well you know
S0198	concentration
S0192	i'm from that's mostly white
S0236	mm
S0192	but don't go to memphis because it's you know it's all
S0236	yeah
S0198	well it's not even that it's just like
S0235	yeah
S0236	the thing the thing that be the cos the the streets be maybe a lot closer in term of history
S0198	yeah it be a lot closer yeah
S0192	well they ban slavery a hell of a lot later than anyone else
S0198	yeah yeah
S0236	yeah we yeah and like
S0198	and a lot of that
S0236	but in other countries like the impoverish be it's it's not
S0192	us
S0236	it's not do on a race or a creed or religion like it's everyone
S0198	race no no no yeah yeah
S0236	in that area be impoverish because the area
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	whereas i think the americans
S0198	yeah yeah exactly
S0236	whereas in america it's obviously like their racial history with slavery and stuff
S0198	they're worse yeah yeah
S0236	so the yeah more minority group be still struggle out of
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	definitely and like
S0236	the impoverish and rather than
S0198	and they'll never get out of that
S0192	and the people
S0198	because it's such a big enough place that they can have an entire town
S0236	mm
S0198	or entire city
S0236	mm
S0198	where they just completely turn around and well i'm not gonna live there i'm gonna live here
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0192	and the americans that we meet in korea
S0198	whereas we're not
S0192	be from the demographic of white middle class america
S0198	but the once that well they have to have a degree to be there
S0192	most most of them would
S0236	mm
S0198	so yeah
S0192	and therefore already
S0236	mm
S0192	what i find
S0198	some of them be really really nice
S0192	a clear divide between british people i meet in korea and american people i meet in korea american people always regardless of how liberal you think they be be patriotic at heart
S0235	oh yeah i think
S0192	and they love where they're from
S0236	mm
S0192	pretty much every single american love where they're from i didn't meet a single british person that love where they're from
S0236	that's why they fuck off
S0192	not one
S0198	yeah
S0192	exactly we go there to escape to a certain degree
S0236	mm
S0192	they go there as a break
S0235	mm
S0236	mm
S0192	before they get a real job and we find that a little bite offensive cos this for us be our real job but the amount of people that turn around and go yeah this i'm gonna go and get a real job this be just fuck around for a while
S0198	generalise but
S0192	oh this job be so easy yeah if you don't take it seriously it's easy
S0235	mm
S0192	but if you actually try to teach and like it's not actually that easy but i can see how we don't get regulate so i can see how people do teach there and just don't do anything
S0198	they're they're like now
S0235	yeah
S0192	they're get stricter
S0198	yeah you gotta have yours
S0192	i mean back in the day you didn't need a degree or anything now you must have a degree
S0198	now you
S0192	now you must have a tefl certificate of some sort
S0198	yeah
S0192	and you must have so they're get stricter but the american demographic that we meet be not representative of the country as a whole whereas i feel like the british demographic
S0235	yeah
S0192	we meet be i feel like we be more representative
S0235	mm
S0192	of the work class of the people there
S0198	or at least their families be and stuff like that
S0192	most of the americans be we take back our closest friend 's erm father just buy a bunch of land in kentucky equivalent to fifty american football pitch
S0236	mm
S0192	like you and that
S0198	and then he's do his private contract in afghanistan
S0192	he just buy that didn't cost very much yeah
S0198	he's an afghanistan
S0192	he's get black money from afghanistan or whatever
S0235	yeah
S0192	erm they've get a lovely detach house in the middle of nowhere like
S0198	that's cheap in america that's cheaper
S0192	load of space yeah only about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars
S0198	yeah cos
S0192	and they've get like a massive detach house with a pond and load of land and a forest and all this kind of stuff
S0198	that be so much cheaper
S0192	we're we go there and we're shoot like m sixteens and shotguns and shit like in their house as normal
S0235	with licence
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	and we're try to explain to them that effectively we live in terrace house
S0198	we need to have license
S0236	yeah
S0192	i try and say to koreans that how we live in england isn't too dissimilar to how you live in korea they all live in high rise they all live in high rise
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah that's cos
S0192	all of them pretty much
S0198	that's cos for one reason there's mountains everywhere
S0192	yes so it's actually quite equitable their land size's about the same as england and their population be about the same as england as well
S0198	ignore like ignore scotland and wales
S0235	oh
S0192	yeah just england about fifty million people in england
S0235	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	forty five fifty million
S0236	mm
S0192	they have fifty million people the land size's equitable however korea's seventy per cent mountains you can't build or live on them
S0236	mm
S0192	so they have to build up and i kinda say to them england's pretty similar the only difference be we don't we take those high rise build and we turn them on their side
S0236	down mm
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah and it's what terrace be
S0192	and that's terrace yeah that's what it be
S0235	yeah
S0198	and that's what it be yeah
S0192	americans don't really know terrace they don't seem to have it
S0236	yeah
S0235	i mean there's some like where we live at the moment it's so so densely populate
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0235	like our road be all terrace house
S0198	yeah yeah
S0236	yeah but hangover from when
S0235	and then you go out in the back and then there's like
S0236	there be a dockyard industrial revolution workforce close so they build up all these terrace
S0198	yeah yeah exactly
S0235	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0198	yeah exactly this be why i explain to american frinds that these
S0236	mm
S0198	these house that be around factories and dockyards
S0235	yeah they be
S0192	they can't believe that we walk out of our house and there's a church down the road
S0198	house
S0192	that's eight hundred years old
S0236	mm
S0235	mm
S0192	what
S0198	but they would say like why would you wanna live on top of each other and i'm like
S0192	they knock everything down every four years
S0198	yeah exactly
S0235	yeah
S0236	bricks not wood
S0192	cos it's the same
S0198	yeah they they hate that they don't like brick house and like or concrete and stuff they're like but i'm like yeah
S0235	i mean many years ago
S0192	but they knock everything down americans be like it stimulate
S0236	mm
S0192	the economy when this business go under we they don't use that build again and put another business in they knock it down and build another build
S0236	mm
S0192	korea's the same they will knock a build down and rebuild another build they build numerous high i mean in they dredge they literally drench an area of the sea up they've do it twice and like we be live in the first area that they dredge this be all under water
S0198	like ten years ago
S0192	like ten years ago but now we be live in it and then this other area call
S0198	population
S0192	they dredge from the sea and just build shit load of high rise there shit load and it's probably run at about ten to twenty per cent capacity there's like hundreds upon hundreds of flats there china have the same problem apparently chinese people from what i've hear cannot take large amount of money out of the country they're not allow therefore they have to reinvest in their own country so they build all these high rise that nobody need yet but they presume they will need in the future
S0198	they will in the future
S0192	so there's just massive areas when we be in china just high rise after high rise after high rise and no one in it there be like no one live there and yet there're still homeless people
S0236	mm
S0192	why be there homeless people when there's
S0235	that doesn't make any sense
S0192	no
S0198	no yeah exactly
S0192	but it's the same in america you could i again some statistics but i think that you can home the homeless people in america like twenty time over with the amount of free accommodation there be the amount of people that have two home or three home or something
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	there be no reason for there to be homeless people effectively
S0236	no it's the same thing in london there're load of place people in london they go around for house have be vacant for a certain amout of time they try and contact the owners and stuff
S0235	mm
S0198	yeah
S0235	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	to say this need to be fill
S0235	yeah
S0236	this be london we need house
S0198	house yeah they just
S0235	yeah
S0236	sort it out or they'll take it from you
S0192	yeah
S0235	in as well a lot of them be middle eastern
S0236	yeah
S0235	in fact it be that they come they come over for like
S0198	people that yeah invest in a property
S0235	well because
S0236	and then just forget about it and abandon it and just fuck off
S0235	the guy have like
S0192	oh i'm now rich
S0236	yeah
S0192	just forget i own that shit
S0235	yeah the guy have a thing what be it
S0236	oh the before they get marry
S0235	yeah before they get marry they have like a summer or year sometimes in the uk
S0236	a year where they it's almost like
S0235	and it's just like an extreme blowout like just do whatever you want it's fine
S0198	oh god go to england
S0235	but then it's it's great because
S0236	mm well it's because they're rich isn't it so it's like
S0235	they kind of
S0198	yeah yeah yeah why not
S0235	and they like have their super cars like ship over at least like like 's girlfriend work at and the shit she bring up from like because obviously 's populate with like arabs that be spend like millions and millions and millions and millions of pound on like
S0198	yeah
S0235	i don't know like a scarf and they come in and they
S0198	better be a fuck nice scarf
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah and they like park up outside in their like incredible amaze like super cars and some of them be like one be velvet like actually velvet and there's like neon like just the like one be pure gold just gold and it's so tacky and so horrid and that's just they have like a big year and they so they buy they they just a buy house because in their future's well i guess it's probably quite hard to come over and like rent a house for a year
S0198	yeah yeah it's easiest to buy a house and then just forget about it
S0235	so you just buy a house and then they leave after the year they ship their car back and they just kinda forget that the house be there
S0236	yeah like go back and then get marry and they take over their parents' business before
S0198	yeah basically
S0235	so then the house be just there and like
S0236	so they get a year to do what the fuck they want
S0235	yeah they spend just like insane amount of money
S0192	oh get squattors right on that shit
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah right that's what i would do
S0198	yeah they be
S0235	but there're all these incredible incredible house like whole house in that they own like whole house not like a flat and a house a whole house they're talk like five six seven eight nine ten million
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	it's crazy
S0235	and they just forget about it
S0198	and they're just vacant
S0235	and they're just like goodbye
S0192	i'm try to get
S0235	there be a woman that go in and there be like still like paperwork and stuff like they leave like their clothe everything they literally she be like
S0198	yeah i know
S0235	she fly in an hour i'm gonna go now and then just leave
S0198	it's a complete
S0192	i'm that rich
S0198	that's actually one of the
S0235	it's literally like
S0198	i mean they probably won't get those students but apparently one of the really difficult things in teach in like saudi and place like that be that in universities and stuff
S0192	be that they're too rich
S0198	you're just teach a bunch of spoil cunts
S0235	yeah
S0236	they get pay to go to university don't they
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	yeah
S0198	and like
S0236	and they get a wage
S0192	probably
S0236	so long as they turn up in class they get a wage
S0192	it's not very easy teach like that
S0198	at least they're not the most of the isn't the same
S0236	no i know
S0192	even if we're marry
S0198	that's not like they're select these course they're just do them because
S0236	mm
S0198	they have to and
S0192	even if we're marry you still have to walk behind me in public couldn't leave the country without my write permission
S0198	without write permission
S0192	that she can leave and on top of that neither of us can leave the country
S0235	ah
S0192	without the write permission of our boss so when
S0198	who take on our passports saudi in particularly bad
S0192	when we go there they take your passports yeah
S0235	oh my god
S0192	so it's not like a normal country when you're
S0198	it's not all of the countries it's in saudi
S0235	no no no no of course not
S0192	it's not like a normal country where you apply for a visa and then when the time run out they kick you out effectively in saudi arabia when you go there you're there forever until they let you go
S0236	mm
S0192	so you apply to leave
S0198	stuff like that
S0192	so they take your passports you can't go and then to go i have to apply to leave and
S0198	you have to apply
S0192	and have to get my permission to go also
S0198	but it's never be particularly a problem
S0192	strange
S0198	they don't like
S0192	if we weren't marry
S0198	oh if we be marry yeah it's different
S0192	couldn't see each other touch each other be in the same area we couldn't be in the same room together as it be even marry we'll be teach at an all boy all blokes or an all girls university
S0198	university yeah they're segregate
S0235	yeah yeah
S0192	the difference be that we would be on a compound so like on a compound apparently i'm sure it's quite promiscuous
S0198	that'd be a western compound
S0192	if it's a compound a little bite i'm sure people would kinda get enough or whatever
S0236	mm
S0192	but it's a western compound you can find out
S0236	yeah that's what
S0192	you've get a swim pool
S0198	yeah
S0192	you've get guard and all that kind of
S0236	definitely you can get
S0198	yeah i don't know in saudi saudi's pretty
S0192	we might go back to korea because
S0236	yeah
S0192	once we get maybe not for a while because we need to work in another job but there be job in korea we get on to the university level
S0236	mm
S0192	and this be great because suddenly we're not we have a lot more responsibility and we take a massive pay cut as well i don't know if say but we
S0235	yeah
S0192	we take a pay cut like three or four thousand pound each to like just for in year to like do this job but we have no office hours and in the last six weeks we be run a funny course where we only do three hours in the morning so we be do at eleven every day do we'd do eight to eleven do and then we'd finish so that be lovely
S0235	oh
S0192	but we be on the bottom ring of the university ladder if you have an ma and a few more years experience there're job still today they give you five months' pay vacation so you work for seven months of the year and you'd get five months off
S0198	only three of those teachers be at the university
S0192	yeah and also and at uni
S0198	they're the ones that be teach like english light major
S0192	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	so our uni there's like twenty five
S0198	or english german major we be just teach english language
S0192	there be like twenty five teachers at our school
S0235	yeah
S0192	out of these twenty five three of them get five months' holiday and they teach english literature or or something like that tesl
S0198	like they're probably on a little bite more than us
S0192	a little bite more than us maybe like fifteen grand eighteen grand
S0198	like two maybe even more
S0192	something like that but they get five months' pay vacation off then there's probably another four or five people like and those kind of people
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	they get maybe three months off three and a half months off
S0198	yeah but it's it's not conceptive
S0192	but it's not and it's not set then there be the rest of the shitmunchers which be us we weren't on the bottom ring there be another rank below us but we be allow on that one we get two months' vacation and that kind of stuff
S0198	yeah
S0192	if i can have a job that give me half the year off
S0235	yeah that's amaze
S0192	that's my job that's
S0236	mm
S0192	and i wanna find the job with the best money with the best vacation basically
S0235	yeah
S0192	that's our goal
S0236	mm
S0235	no that sound amaze
S0192	but know all that i'm sure by the time we qualify those job won't exist anymore so
S0235	i'm sure they will maybe just not in korea
S0192	i don't know they're definitely cut down and other place aren't do it saudi give you like two months off
S0198	but it depend on the university
S0192	what kind of technician
S0236	it's still good
S0192	it's good yeah
S0236	four weeks
S0192	it's good yeah
S0236	twenty days
S0192	it's eight it's eight weeks then isn't it
S0198	what be
S0236	yeah
S0192	two months eight nine weeks maybe
S0236	yeah well yeah
S0192	maybe even ten
S0236	twenty twenty days extend to twenty five throughout the year
S0235	yeah
S0192	the good thing about england though be you choose when you take that
S0236	mm
S0192	and it's be really hard for us we get like a family wed or like something else be go on you wanna come home you can't
S0236	mm
S0192	you can't like you we may get good vacation but it's when they dictate it's not
S0236	mm
S0198	it's cos when the school's on recession
S0192	yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	you can't just pop home when you need to
S0235	but then that's the same in english school
S0198	yeah yeah that's
S0235	you're not gonna be able to
S0192	yeah
S0235	take like a six week holiday
S0192	no
S0235	during term and you can only have holiday during
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah it's part of teach
S0235	yeah there's there's it's kind of like the the worst bite about the job i guess
S0192	like the process yeah
S0235	it's that you
S0192	it's definitely hard though like live abroad's be tough sometimes like you wanna be there for your friends you wanna be there for your family and you can't sometimes
S0235	no but i think that's just
S0192	you lose your job
S0235	that's just life though isn't it really you can't always be there
S0192	yeah
S0236	mm
S0192	just take a while to realise though and you can't always yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	it's nice though that we come home and like you get some pretty close friends that you come back and you just crack straight back on and like carry on like nothing's really happen
S0235	yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	it be always kind of the same though when you come back it's always like you never leave
S0198	you never leave yeah
S0235	i always get really excite when i first see you and i'm like this be really weird 's here like this year be really strange cos i haven't see you for like two years
S0198	yeah
S0192	that's the longest we haven't see anyone
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah the last time be yeah
S0192	but the weirdest thing i think and maybe you'll all agree with this
S0235	yeah
S0192	be how quick those two years go
S0235	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	so then you come home and you're like fuck me it's be two fuck years
S0236	mm
S0235	i think like
S0192	it's be five years since i meet you guy
S0236	mm
S0192	you know what i mean
S0235	i think the first time
S0198	oh no we're get older and it's a terrible thing
S0235	yeah when you leave i be twenty five
S0198	why don't i get ided anymore
S0235	it be erm
S0198	i be twenty one before
S0235	i don't know i think like i think probably this time it hasn't go as quick but then because when you leave i be like right 's gonna be go for two years
S0198	yeah
S0235	and then i be like fuck that's a really long time but then once you
S0198	you
S0235	get to like the last six months like it go really quick
S0198	it go really quick
S0235	so i go to
S0236	mm
S0235	and i think it be six weeks
S0198	yeah and i think that's
S0235	until you come back and you're like no six months
S0235	and i be like oh okay
S0192	oh okay
S0235	and then it be six weeks like within like a heartbeat and i be like
S0198	it do go quick yeah
S0235	fuck it's actually and now it's like today and like
S0198	it doesn't erm yeah
S0192	well i hope if we live a little bite closer and you guy be finish with your ma and you get a bite more spare cash
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	then we can kind of if not come to where we be maybe meet in our holiday like meet somewhere in europe

S0235	you don't really wanna it so it's kind of
S0192	you you want you want that member of your family not not the money you know what i mean
S0235	yeah of course you do and it be only i think that only i probably
S0236	it be the insurance
S0235	yeah i wouldn't have have anything it's because my mum have life insurance
S0236	mm
S0198	oh really
S0235	that be the only reason i get it
S0198	oh right
S0235	because obviously i mean the house
S0192	so they do pay out on that shit then
S0235	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what it be
S0192	and they pay the mortgage didn't they
S0235	they pay off the rest of the mortgage
S0198	oh really
S0235	yeah that's why like
S0236	mm it be
S0235	a house yeah
S0192	fair play to you for hang on to it
S0198	yeah yeah yeah i didn't realise that that be on life insurance
S0192	i'm sure your erm i'm sure your mum would be very proud
S0235	yeah my mum have no money
S0198	how long have she have that policy for
S0235	how long have she have it she my mum have the policy after my dad die
S0198	that be a really long time
S0235	my dad have yeah so my dad have life insurance which be obviously fortunate because then when he die then they pay off the house so then she be fine but then you know she sell the house and move up north
S0198	oh really
S0235	and then that kind of disappear cos take half the money when they separate
S0198	yeah
S0235	and then
S0192	how long ago do your dad pass if you don't mind me ask
S0235	when i be like
S0198	three or four
S0235	three like eighty nine quite a long time ago
S0192	you don't remember much
S0235	no i don't remember so yeah so then she have
S0198	she decide to take a policy
S0235	to take a policy yeah she's always have a policy
S0198	ah
S0235	but like
S0192	very formal think wasn't it
S0236	yeah
S0198	the thing out of that cos she
S0235	oh my god
S0236	cos she'd be pay it
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0235	yeah
S0236	as soon as we insurance company
S0235	but then like my sister who's get like
S0198	yeah
S0235	phenomenal like
S0192	sign me up
S0236	yeah
S0235	insurance policies so because then you can get house insurance well like er insurance on your poperty or your mortgage that my mum's or have get erm who she meet when she be like sick in hospital and it's an insurance it's it's like if you get a critical illness they'll pay off your mortgage so have it and have leukemia like my mum and they pay off their mortgage and that be it
S0198	wow
S0235	so my sister have so if i think if anyone get
S0198	how how how high be it though
S0235	it's quick and you're talk like an extra hundred pound or something like that with all i think with all of the insurances together it's about an extra hundred hundred and
S0236	it depend how old you be and what your family history be and all that shit the more kind of risk you have
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah cos
S0236	the more expensive it will be
S0235	yeah cos your family history
S0198	you will be more high risk and that kind of stuff
S0235	my family history it will cost a fuck fortune
S0198	yeah
S0235	but it might balance out
S0198	yeah
S0235	but yeah but like if i think if anyone get ill and like even little things like if go deaf
S0236	mm
S0235	they'll like pay off like ten grand er towards mortgage like load of weird
S0192	be he go deaf
S0235	weird little things no no no he's not he's not deaf
S0198	no no no it's an example
S0235	but like you know like if
S0192	just random examples
S0235	yeah just a random example if someone like lose an arm or
S0192	if if someone go deaf yeah
S0235	you know something like that
S0198	so it might mean that like
S0236	it's just money so you can take the time off work
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah exactly cos somebody have to take
S0236	so you don't have to worry about that yeah
S0198	time off work if your child go deaf then you need extra care
S0236	yeah yeah of course
S0235	so you just out but if you get like a critical illness and like leukemia be

S0198	anything yeah
S0192	yeah
S0235	and they're not pay for the mortgage
S0236	no they're just bloody
S0198	oh that's crazy though cos that's because it's become so common now
S0235	yeah well i guess it's like it's not a bad thing to have
S0198	no yeah exactly it's kind of like
S0235	you know
S0198	a good thing to have actually
S0235	especially if like the main like if anything like if get sick be like the main breadwinner

S0192	er maybe like a month or something yeah a couple of months something like that
S0198	a couple of months maybe
S0192	it be pretty scary and i think
S0198	it be a couple of years ago
S0192	i think that be game over
S0198	yeah
S0192	and she's kinda sad after my parent split like i think my dad might've marry her but she's quite wealthy and he's not
S0235	mm
S0236	mm
S0192	and now she's sick he doesn't wanna marry her because he feel like it'll be like he's try to get her money so he's not
S0236	mm
S0192	anyway there's nothing to do anyway
S0198	no
S0192	she's pretty ill
S0198	yeah she's pretty
S0192	out of my mum's three best friends her three best friends one's already dead from cancer one have have stomach cancer and the other one be my dad's partner who's have cancer twice already so it's just like and her mum die of cancer and it's so rife
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0192	the statistics you know the average person live to eighty bullshit
S0236	mm
S0235	what's that one in three people
S0192	where do that statistic come from
S0198	yeah exactly
S0192	be that
S0236	mm it's the average
S0198	i don't know where that statistic come from
S0192	be that only be the stastic like
S0236	average yeah
S0192	anyone that live beyond seventy will live to eighty do you know what i mean
S0235	yeah i just think it's
S0236	like
S0235	yeah
S0192	it but no think about this
S0236	so people like my great nan who's a hundred now and still pick on
S0198	yeah and she's still live you tell me she's still play the piano
S0235	yeah
S0192	well
S0236	she's she's so active
S0192	okay
S0236	so she's drag the average up a little bite
S0192	okay so we're talk about the average the the average be
S0198	she really be though isn't she
S0192	think about
S0198	dah dah dah dah dah dah
S0235	i'm go to all of you
S0235	all of you
S0192	all of you the thing about average be i understand what you're say that move the average up
S0236	mm
S0198	oh i think she'd die
S0192	okay but like let's say
S0192	if the average age be eighty and your nan be a hundred
S0236	mm mm
S0192	and she's pull the average up but there're people that die when they're three and when they're five
S0236	yeah infant mortality in
S0192	so you think that for the
S0236	some countries doesn't count
S0198	count towards mortality
S0192	yeah this be what i'm say
S0236	so a child that die be infant mortality
S0192	because if if
S0198	yeah i don't think it count
S0192	i don't think that any death before thirty can count
S0198	i reckon i reckon it's
S0192	because if you die before thirty and you wanna make an average and the average be eighty and you'd die at twenty seven well then somebody's gonna have to be live to a hundred and forty
S0236	mm
S0192	for the average to come to eighty so
S0236	ah yeah but then you've get the majority of people
S0192	i feel like they just
S0198	yeah
S0236	if they live to say say the average be eighty if a large number of people would live to say ninety ninety five which isn't out of the question
S0192	who be these people
S0235	they're all like not
S0236	but women tend to live longer anyway so the women be drag the average up
S0235	they're huge
S0192	be they in your family cos they're not in mine they're not in 's
S0236	as men die younger
S0235	no
S0192	i mean who be these people
S0235	my like
S0236	mm
S0198	i have one granddad that live till ninety
S0192	it's a myth
S0235	my nan's like seventy five or something
S0192	mm nobody in my family have live beyond seventy nobody
S0198	my granddad get to ninety two
S0192	nobody
S0198	i think my dad say he live until ninety two
S0192	i only know one grandparent ever
S0198	my dad's seventy
S0192	nobody's live
S0236	i've my my granddad be still alive
S0235	i think it's like do we have do we have like
S0198	how old be your dad
S0236	er fifty two
S0198	yeal that's the thing that i find that be become
S0236	my be fifty five
S0198	the most common
S0192	he's not old
S0198	the stop between the age between like fifty and er forty and sixty
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0198	i feel like people be like it's become much higher
S0235	it's change
S0236	well it's that age because obviously they're the children
S0198	i feel like the statistic need to change
S0236	of like the sixties and seventies
S0198	the sixties which be why my mum say
S0235	yeah they have like
S0236	they be smoke and drink and shit like that
S0198	yeah yeah she say
S0192	and that come to us
S0235	yeah
S0198	exactly my mum say she live
S0192	you know what i mean we're gonna be like the the age of thirty to fifty
S0236	the generation before us
S0235	yeah yeah
S0236	when cocaine and pills
S0198	yeah
S0236	but we be too young for that
S0235	yeah long ago
S0192	not that we
S0235	i feel like i don't think we're that bad a generation like we might've all start smoke and stuff a lot a lot younger
S0236	mm
S0235	but i think most of us like
S0198	i don't think
S0235	most of us will stop by the age of thirty because everyone
S0236	yeah well you get home it's like the crest of medicine and science
S0192	i think i think i think there's be a massive
S0198	but i think like the damage have be do
S0192	i think there's a massive push
S0235	but before if you could smoke
S0198	because actually like even like
S0235	like at twenty five
S0236	like seven years approximately
S0235	you like pretty much have to
S0198	yeah but i don't i feel like
S0236	yeah
S0192	no i'm gonna agree with to a certain degree
S0198	still the stress's be put in your body
S0192	okay
S0236	yeah but then your body be still recover
S0198	yeah
S0192	okay then it's normal stress i be gonna agree with cos to a certain extent say i think i'm lose track of what i'm say what be we talk about
S0198	yeah i don't know like
S0192	what be we talk about
S0198	death age
S0192	how long people live for
S0235	yeah
S0198	the damage with
S0235	oh no but i like
S0192	damage with
S0235	that
S0192	i think it's more about healthy live and healthy eat and all this kind of stuff
S0235	yeah
S0192	people recognise sugar's bad for you and all this kind of stuff nowadays so i'll agree that people be kind of move more towards a healthier live
S0198	i still
S0192	however you ladies drink a hell of a lot more than ladies ever do in the past i honestly think
S0235	i don't know
S0198	yeah my mum still
S0235	i don't know you say
S0198	my mum hesitate when i say that and i be like no but surely
S0235	yeah
S0198	she's like
S0192	you you only get to think that alcopops be invent in the nineties
S0198	she be a bad example
S0192	they didn't just
S0198	but that be no
S0235	yeah no but they use to drink wine
S0192	and prior to that a woman would have a glass of wine or a martini or something now
S0198	she do say that
S0235	wow
S0198	she would women would never order a pint
S0192	never have a pint never have a beer
S0235	no no no no
S0198	like
S0192	this kind of stuff
S0198	whereas we do it completely all the time don't we
S0235	my mum use to drink like a lot of southern comfort and stuff like that
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0235	but she still use to drink like quite a lot
S0198	yeah
S0192	but
S0235	i think when we be not but
S0192	i would say that the average woman drink
S0198	i think we still can drink more than our parents' generation
S0192	more today than the average woman do before
S0198	yeah i still think so
S0235	yeah
S0198	cos they would still be the ones that knock on from the generation before
S0192	but it's difficult to say we didn't live in the past so there's a lot
S0236	mm
S0235	but then we have like other things as well like
S0235	our diet be a lot better than what maybe our parents' diet be
S0198	depend on depend on
S0192	but but
S0236	different time as well
S0198	the kind of food you're talk about
S0192	but the food be more poison the food it require more pesticides it's more mass produce it's cheaper to produce er the world in general be more poison than it be even fifty years ago
S0235	yeah i guess so
S0192	so it's pretty difficult to tell
S0236	mm
S0192	it's i agree with what you're say but i'm
S0235	i guess it's just
S0192	sceptical because we don't know
S0198	i do say cos i like argue with my i i go on about like diet and food with my mum at one point and she be like well now she have alzheimer's but she didn't die until she be like eighty four or something
S0235	yeah
S0198	and that be like a mental disease or whatever and my mum be like she never eat very many vegetables or fruit and things like that
S0192	yeah i
S0198	and i say but up to a certain point like quite late in her life she wasn't eat much shit either
S0235	mm
S0192	yeah
S0198	but what she do eat grow up would've be
S0192	be wholefoods
S0198	mostly locally make and like
S0235	mm
S0192	yes it be quite vary cos she didn't have many mass produce but it be wholefoods
S0235	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	it be wholefood package
S0198	and like manufacture process food wouldn't exist at the time it didn't exist then
S0192	acidity regulators whatever sugar and stuff they out in
S0235	mm
S0198	and at the point she get older she didn't like foreign stuff that
S0192	but i'm sure all of us in this room grow up on two bowl of breakfast cereal a day which effectively be just sugar
S0236	more than that
S0198	i didn't
S0192	yeah no i do i use to eat weetos
S0198	but yeah
S0235	i
S0192	like two or three time a day
S0235	yeah i like have any
S0198	i have marmite on toast but that's no better either
S0235	we use to have toast i've never be like a cereal person
S0198	yeah i
S0236	mm
S0198	no me neither
S0192	it's what the blokes have
S0198	i think it's a boy thing yeah
S0235	and the yeah
S0192	i have a lot of cereal
S0236	it's er more of er smokers
S0198	oh really
S0192	cigarettes and stuff
S0198	oh whatever
S0236	yeah yeah that's it
S0235	i never
S0236	cos it's easy it's nice
S0198	yeah i love my toast
S0236	you get a free drink
S0198	toast be just as easy
S0192	yeah yeah
S0236	a free sugar drink
S0198	it be it be refresh actually
S0236	a lovely sugar drink
S0192	and a free toy in the in the box
S0235	in the box
S0192	they use to put in the package
S0236	do you oh my god
S0198	oh yeah yeah you would accidentally eat that shit
S0235	yeah
S0192	or they come with yours no i think it be unhygienic cos you'd always get
S0235	some of them do
S0192	one member of the family stick their hand right
S0236	yeah
S0192	like shit wow yeah of course they didn't it's too sugary to get it all
S0192	i think i'd live on that
S0235	it'd kill some bacteria
S0198	they need to ban some stuff
S0192	fruity loop or that sort of sugar
S0198	in america that shit be rife
S0235	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0235	i mean
S0198	you can get anything you can get marshmallow cookies
S0192	we we try to avoid
S0235	i think
S0236	mm
S0192	process food as much as possible but it's not easy it's really hard actually
S0198	and then we drink what we can
S0235	oh i know
S0192	like you're talk about like iceland pretty much just to avoid freeze food like all together
S0235	yeah i mean it's like well
S0198	we eat a lot of freeze
S0192	i'm not say it's a bad thing just
S0198	produce
S0192	we're try to so we've try to for a while
S0235	yeah i know we should
S0198	i don't know we just haven't be there lately
S0192	we no we freeze our own produce we don't buy freeze when be the last time
S0198	but we have freeze vegetables in korea but only cos we have to
S0192	only cos we have to
S0198	yeah
S0192	you couldn't buy er green bean unless they be freeze so we have to buy that we wouldn't have buy them like that if we
S0198	yeah
S0192	could just buy green bean chicken you couldn't it be so expensive to buy a fresh chicken but freeze chicken be affordable so we'd buy freeze chicken that kind of stuff you couldn't get lamb or beef cheap so we'd have to get in on the internet and then freeze it
S0198	i guess if we go to iceland we might find some of these things be really cheap
S0192	yeah they probably be
S0198	yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah
S0198	i've never be to iceland i don't know
S0192	the problem be like the preservatives that they put into
S0236	yeah it'd be ten pound in iceland
S0235	yeah that's really tentative for meat
S0236	meatballs meat
S0198	no it's
S0236	for chicken
S0198	oh yeah three for ten pound they do that
S0235	yeah they do like
S0198	at morrison's too
S0236	it's three pound yeah
S0192	what be three for ten pound
S0235	like meat
S0236	meat
S0198	meat yeah
S0235	so you can have chicken bacon
S0198	like you can get a massive pack of sausages or something
S0235	sausages i don't know
S0198	yeah and that's like a week's worth of meat
S0236	or meatballs yeah stuff like that
S0198	for ten pound
S0236	it's er what we do with meatballs be wicked cos we we meat
S0235	meat oh i'm like a huge i love meatballs
S0192	do you not make your own
S0198	oh no it's what you recommend
S0236	ohh
S0235	no no no no so what you do
S0192	it really
S0236	so you so then you've get
S0235	you put them in the foil and then put them in a freezer
S0236	yeah
S0198	oh so then you need to defrost as you need
S0236	so then when you have to eat and then it's saturday night and go well that's a portion for me if we're both in
S0235	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah
S0236	two of them
S0192	oh nice yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	so instead of defrost them all
S0198	yeah exactly that's a good idea
S0192	have you ever make them
S0236	no
S0235	er i have like once and they be a complete disaster
S0192	oh
S0235	they would just fall apart
S0192	they're so easy
S0235	yeah i know which make it worse that i just can't
S0192	no i mean
S0236	but then they be three for ten
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0236	more meat
S0192	yeah yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0236	you've get chicken meat and
S0192	i mean that's that's just use a lot of spice and then just egg
S0198	they just they just reroll them for you
S0192	and breadcrumbs
S0236	mm
S0192	that's it
S0235	yeah no
S0198	i haven't see this prerolled meatballs
S0192	and maybe mushroom but they're
S0236	mm
S0192	no you get freeze ones and it's nice and easy it's all do but
S0198	no these be just fresh they've
S0235	yeah they be fresh they're
S0236	yeah it's fresh
S0198	haven't you see them with the fresh meat and then the meatballs
S0192	i have yeah i have and i'm sure they're better than the ones we make but
S0198	i don't know if they're better it's just convenient it's easier
S0235	no actually it's just better to make them at the moment
S0236	it's just easier it's just easier
S0192	we make
S0236	they're probably better if make them cos you can put what you want in it
S0235	yeah you can put like and stuff and also
S0198	you make the
S0192	but it's it's not like we're use good meat to make with it either
S0236	mm

S0192	if you
S0236	after a
S0192	if you buy it i'm sure it's fine
S0198	yeah exactly
S0192	well the thing be we've be in countries where they eat bug so it's just like can't be that bad
S0236	yeah good source of protein bug good source of protein
S0198	yeah
S0236	it's good stuff
S0192	definitely put you off we've get our friends and like an and no way could we tell them that there be bug in it
S0235	no

S0235	yeah no i mean unless it's
S0198	there weren't any
S0192	there be no maggots in the food tonight
S0198	no here it's okay their stock rotation be not so good sometimes
S0192	mm
S0198	actually we er we inported we order the from a website in
S0192	that be the problem we have to get all of our spice and things
S0198	korean call
S0192	from indians
S0235	oh that's insane
S0198	and i think it be like an indian company
S0192	yeah
S0198	that be set up and we'd buy like our meat certain meats like lamb from there which you can't buy them beef be cheaper
S0192	it wasn't very regulate
S0198	but sometimes you'd get it and you'd be like
S0192	i'm sure we buy beef once and it be not beef
S0198	oh yeah definitely it wasn't it be it may be lamb it might be mutton
S0198	yeah but it wasn't like beef
S0235	yeah
S0198	it be like i know the difference and this isn't quite beef we eat it anyway whatever whether it be lamb or
S0192	we're not picky
S0198	incredibly fatty i mean lamb's fatty anyway but this stuff be amaze
S0192	actually the lamb here be not that fatty
S0198	no not compare to all we have
S0192	no that i cook not fatty at all
S0198	no
S0198	yeah yeah i don't think they grind it up
S0235	no
S0192	it affect the flavour in fact
S0236	yeah well i mean obviously
S0236	coronary heart disease be still number one killer
S0198	yeah
S0236	sorry i tend to trim it off
S0198	uhh
S0192	i'm not sure that come from fat too much do it
S0236	yeah so fat will clog your artery so that will lead to er
S0192	but the thing be there be culture that just eat fat
S0236	yeah
S0192	pretty much people koreans eat load of fat
S0236	mm
S0192	but they're really thin
S0236	mm
S0192	and they don't have a particularly high rate of heart disease
S0198	but then they
S0236	no but then it all come from erm
S0192	they have a high rate of stomach cancer
S0198	how frequently do they eat that quantity of fat then
S0236	yeah
S0192	fat quite often i mean any time they have any of their meats i mean the literal translation
S0198	yeah but how often do they have every week
S0192	fairly i mean they're all their restaurants be full all the time
S0198	yeah but they don't go to them every i mean some of the students will go to them weekly but families though
S0192	but i mean every other meat they have literally mean three fat pork it's like a piece of bacon
S0236	mm
S0192	but with three thick chunk of fat in it
S0198	but they're kinda what they
S0192	i bet you're really go to like fat i think it's really tasty but
S0236	mm
S0198	what they have in their food at home be fuck side dish
S0192	when we first arrive there you go yeah
S0198	with rice
S0192	but to say they don't eat out frequently be bullshit
S0198	no they do but they don't like
S0235	at least they
S0192	but i mean take the inuits
S0235	wow
S0192	inuits basically live on fat they live of like seal blubber and shit it's fat
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	they live on fat i don't think they're die of heart disease
S0198	that that get them through the winter
S0192	i think the problem with this be your cheap oil and your margarines and stuff i think that's what's cause heart disease
S0198	yeah it's the fat in everything
S0192	there's there's different type of fat isn't there it's like
S0235	yeah there's good fat and there's bad fat
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	i don't think the fat from an animal be bad for you i think that like fat from oil or or fuck margarine or something
S0235	what be the what be the fat that be bad for you
S0235	be bad for you
S0192	well you've get you know a lot more than i do about it so fair
S0198	be the animal fat the bad fat
S0236	yeah it be yeah it out of it
S0198	yeah ah okay
S0235	i guess it's like anything it's like it's about
S0192	in moderation
S0235	yeah eat in moderation
S0236	yeah
S0235	like if you sit and eat like
S0236	and you could eat hundred percent fat diet but if you're only take in like two thousand and five hundred calories
S0192	doesn't matter yeah
S0236	that's basically your
S0192	it's a bite of a shame
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0236	metabolism will burn it off anyway
S0192	i hear about i didn't actually watch it my friend tell me about a documentary where they realise like in the eighties or something that sugar be terribly terribly bad for you
S0235	mm
S0192	like really really bad for you but at the time decide that it be easier and better for the food industry to focus on fat
S0236	mm
S0192	and then they focus on and it's a shame that fat be synonymous with be fat because you're like well if i'm eat fat then it's gonna make me fat but that's not the truth
S0235	mm
S0192	and it's what you're say be
S0236	no
S0192	like depend how many calories you're eat now fat be highly calorific so you're get a lot of energy for what you're eat but the thing be sugar be really what cause people to be fat and they think that like erm sugar be very acidic i think and there be that theory that you know when fruit be ready they're very sugary and like usually that's a time that we want to plump up it's in harvest it's in like september october
S0235	ah
S0192	we need to plump up a bite for the winter so apparently when you have sugary fruit and sugary foods your body put on weight to store it for the winter but now we're eat these things at all time of the year and they they're very acidic and they're cause a lot of kind of problems for people
S0236	i think it come from further back than that even in in time cos obviously you eat when there be food
S0192	yeah
S0236	so your body be still
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah yeah you didn't
S0236	in excess but then obviously if your
S0198	yeah
S0236	mostly it would well maybe once a week
S0192	what do you think about the fast diet have you hear about this
S0236	yeah
S0235	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	theory that fast generate more
S0236	yeah yeah
S0192	it may be cheaper
S0236	yeah it's cheaper but then it's just
S0235	i don't necessarily think it's
S0236	try i don't know because if you go for starve and your body starve obviously your body want to take in and store the calories you do take in
S0198	yeah exactly
S0235	mm
S0198	it's a very dangerous thing isn't it
S0236	so it's yeah it's difficult
S0192	but theoretically and i understand the theory behind it
S0198	it depend what you eat
S0192	if your body be not receive food it's gonna have to step up a gear to help you find food
S0236	yeah
S0192	they believe that yeah you're not mean to be able create new synapsis or something in your brain but they i some research think that maybe starve yourself would actually create new wire in your brain effectively because you be have to become cleverer to find more food because you don't have any food so your body's like on a fight or flight kind of situation
S0235	yeah i don't know
S0198	yeah it's quite erm
S0192	and also apparently again it's easier for your body to regenerate when it's not process stuff if you empty your body of stuff then your body can regenerate easier than when it's constantly have to digest food
S0235	digest
S0192	and do all this kind of stuff so
S0235	i don't know i mean like
S0236	the thing that's best be to have a balance diet
S0235	yeah like
S0198	yeah
S0235	i think that the thing be it depend on what you eat
S0236	like that depend what you're do like with athletes
S0236	obviously they need a large amount of calories so high on their diet would be things like carbs but with the general person the majority of them should be fruit and vegs and then like a smaller amount of like bread and carbs and stuff
S0192	meat
S0236	even a smaller amount of
S0192	proteins
S0236	and a amount of fat
S0192	bean
S0236	cos you need fat obviously to break down stuff
S0192	lentils
S0198	yeah
S0192	protein foods
S0236	but the majority of diet should be fruit and veg
S0198	yeah
S0235	the thing be as well with like those kind of
S0236	for the average person
S0235	like fast diet as well be the psychology behind them as well because if you know that say that
S0236	you're just gonna starve for two days you're gonna starve for two days
S0235	tomorrow you're gonna starve for two days you're gonna eat more
S0192	you'll eat more before
S0235	and so you're probably gonna be
S0198	oh yeah yeah
S0192	you'll just end up with the same amount of calories
S0198	yeah yeah and you're
S0235	yeah you're not gonna
S0198	you're and like in our culture you're go to a shop and you'll be like well i can't eat this and this and this which be terrible
S0192	it doesn't matter whatever yeah
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah you're just
S0236	it's not most most the you'll cheat
S0198	you're not gonna grab anything from the shelf
S0236	anyway like
S0198	it's like go through a
S0236	if you're be good you overestimate if you're be bad you underestimate it's what
S0235	yeah
S0236	most of us do
S0198	yeah
S0236	so you get up and run mile and say oh i must've burn off two hundred calories or whatever so now i can eat all this and then if you're eat well we go or if you've eat something bad you think oh that it be bad but maybe it's only two hundred maybe i'll go out for that run
S0235	it doesn't make sense
S0236	but then you're overestimate the good stuff and underestimate the bad stuff
S0192	yeah i never we go hike and we do like an eight hour hike
S0198	yeah
S0192	i don't give a shit what we eat we don't talk about it
S0236	mm
S0192	whatever it be just i feel
S0236	that's well you should take chocolate cos it's full of energy
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	we take nut and chocolate and cheese
S0236	mm
S0192	and that kind of stuff and it's like it's good for when we're hike i don't give a shit about it because we're burn i mean over a six eight hour hike you're burn a couple of thousands calories i'm pretty sure so i don't really give a shit what we eat at that point
S0235	and also it's kind of like low intensity as well isn't it and that's gonna be like burn
S0236	well it depend what
S0192	the hike
S0235	the fat rather than just
S0236	yeah well it depend on the intensity you're work at
S0198	yeah
S0235	but i don't know i'm not really into diet
S0192	no
S0198	no no
S0235	as you might have guess
S0198	as a student
S0192	to eat and drink
S0236	mm
S0235	yeah to excessive eat and drink to cheese and cider
S0198	yeah
S0235	that's like

S0235	load of kid like library students
S0236	and
S0198	to understand what a library be
S0198	yeah yeah
S0235	and he's always try to get kid in and they do like lego
S0198	they do summer er
S0235	after school and summer
S0198	summer program and stuff
S0235	yeah
S0198	i recommend that they do
S0235	yeah they have to the thing be at the moment be like load of libraries be change libraries at be grow they're gonna be call hubs
S0198	oh okay oh
S0236	i think it's bullshit
S0235	it's ridiculous so if you like meet
S0198	they need terminology
S0235	a person who's like oh i'd like to go to the library you'll never go find a library because it's not call a library it's call a hub it's ridiculous it's really
S0198	internet so
S0235	well you can use yeah you can use things that you can remember but but also it's like you you're pay
S0235	park fin council tax they're literally like no
S0198	no what
S0235	joke it's so bad and then
S0198	they're make it into like a city centre then
S0235	yeah with book erm but the worst thing be it's like there's like a first contact point so naturally because we're english everyone just want to queue at the start point
S0198	yeah i know you see a queue woah woah woah a queue
S0236	mm
S0235	woh hang on let me join this queue so they start at the queue and just like take back a library book and then they're like no you don't do that here there's the library how people will be so annoy it's just so bad
S0198	they need to signpost that
S0235	it's just so bad but you have to
S0236	you have to pay
S0198	yeah
S0235	there're certain things that they're say that like you have to all like certain book i think it's either discharge or return that they have to go to the contact point but then some not it's a complete like arse they didn't need to do it they could've just
S0198	mm
S0235	make it carry on with be a library
S0236	it be just cos
S0235	and then
S0198	pay the difference
S0236	you have the whole thing
S0235	yeah
S0236	the er
S0235	a big world or
S0236	it's society
S0235	society
S0236	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0236	be it cos of that cos they're try to say it's not a library
S0198	no cos they want libraries volunteer
S0235	no
S0236	it's this so we can still employ librarians and stuff
S0235	no because the thing be with the big society thing be it just say that you know if you wanna have more of this new community you should just do it for nothing and the issue be that if you're gonna do that then libraries be a big thing so people don't like have tax money spend on libraries to pay librarians to do the job so then they be just say well volunteer be mean to do it it's not that hard
S0198	mm
S0235	but it be hard it's not like if it be that easy then anyone would do it i guess right all librarians
S0198	yeah
S0192	be a librarian
S0235	so so yeah so that's why now like
S0198	it's not that easy
S0235	you will never you'll never get a volunteer job as a librarian like there's proper lockdown because they think
S0198	mm
S0235	that once they send one in then like load of people come in then eventually the government will just be well hang on these volunteer be do your job
S0198	we don't need to pay anyone to do anything anymore
S0235	you don't need to pay anyone to do it so you can and that's
S0198	be this be the council fund it
S0235	no well
S0236	the tax go to everyone so no you pay tax
S0235	no no no it's like
S0198	it's not a private company be it i'm sure
S0236	you pay tax towards it you should be able to go and get a book if you wanna read a fuck book
S0198	mm
S0235	but libraries be like they do like amaze
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0198	yeah
S0236	yeah
S0235	things but the problem be with libraries be this they're kind of like
S0192	yeah
S0235	incredibly update with like the internet and ebooks and everything like it's
S0198	this be why they now have to call it the hub
S0235	yeah which be why they probably now have to call it
S0236	mm
S0235	the hub
S0192	so in the future we're go to have hubs rather than libraries
S0198	rather than promote libraries for what they give for
S0235	yeah maybe in the future like now
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	tomorrow
S0235	like tomorrow yeah some poor like traveller who's just try to find a library to find out what the bus time be or something they're never gonna find it cos they need to find a hub and no one know

S0198	every single day that you don't see it
S0192	i've admit to not move
S0198	find other things
S0192	things to look for things but the fact of the matter be i know where i put shit

S0198	nine time out of ten it's nine time out of ten it's where you're not you haven't lift something up it's like
S0192	you're twist history again

S0235	yeah it's record
S0192	i say that every time
S0235	this be technically now a
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah you will but do you know what this be a pretty good sample of natural conversation i mean nothing's be force for hours can't really argue on that
S0235	some edit but it'll be fine
S0192	yeah there's yeah i'll go back and do that
S0235	a couple of edit
S0192	what be you about to do with that do not put that in your ear
S0198	yeah why do everyone have to carry tissue for these devices
S0235	no i don't know do i don't think anyone else do
S0236	it's just cos then they leak off and so i like to clean it before every time i top it up clean it up
S0192	that's fair
S0236	to stop it leak cos it's horrible to drink
S0192	i don't trust them i don't think cigarettes be good
S0198	ah yeah that's probably what's be happen to us when we try other people's and they just haven't take that out
S0192	you're not mean to drink it it's toxic so you're mean to smoke it
S0235	oh
S0198	i feel like we like get like perfume spray in our mouth when we've try it before
S0192	it's disgust
S0198	it's horrible
S0235	yeah sound pretty horrible
S0192	it's be like spicy liquid that

S0192	you obviously you can't
S0198	you can't smoke it on a wow
S0235	no
S0192	it's be really harsh about it
S0198	why
S0192	cos it's like
S0236	cos they're like
S0192	they don't like to look at the what be what be it
S0235	well er i
S0236	well i i think the only thing i can think be cos obviously they can look out if they see smoke puff off somewhere they know they can come over and say get the fuck out
S0235	yeah
S0192	even if they
S0236	rather than take a second step to that what be you smoke oh it's one whatever
S0198	but you can smell cigarettes

S0236	yeah yeah yeah
S0198	yeah
S0235	yeah
S0192	maybe you could just go he go yeah 's smoke and you go yeah mate it's a vape and then the conversation end
S0236	mm yeah i don't know i don't know much about it to be honest

S0236	yeah probably that shit cos this be quite long
S0198	oh i guess
S0236	obviously for
S0192	i mean that doesn't look bad
S0198	i guess it's more
S0192	i would say that that bag have be design not to need to do that
S0198	yeah yeah that's why the
S0236	mm no
S0192	but like i think he be talk about like general bag but that's a little bite it's not gonna catch on much
S0236	yeah
S0192	although those little hook might catch on something
S0236	yeah
S0198	i think they're like
S0192	but they look a bite too what do you slip stuff in that front bite be that what it's for
S0198	too
S0192	i don't know they're like elastic strap or something that you
