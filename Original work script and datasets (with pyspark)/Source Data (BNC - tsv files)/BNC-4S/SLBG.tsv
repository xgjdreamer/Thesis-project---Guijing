S0415	you know what i mean you can see it
S0416	i can see er look if you look there you can see a crack very close
S0415	yeah but look the thing be it er the only thing now be that we can't shut it down or if you close it it'll shut down
S0416	or you can just press that down
S0415	okay but the the good thing be that erm they're gonna fix it for free
S0417	will they and so what erm do we need to provide our evidence anything
S0415	well no erm i i'll log in under my email address but
S0415	because the service tag be still there it's they know from the service tag when the warranty's up
S0417	yeah

S0417	yeah
S0415	address
S0417	yes
S0415	come to my no it definitely come to here

S0415	well you be here so it would've get come send to here
S0416	you be the one who find the laptop
S0417	i think i think it come here
S0415	mm cos er sometimes i'd send it to erm just across the road cos she'd be there during the day and i wouldn't
S0417	mm
S0415	it's probably i probably just
S0417	yeah
S0415	but anyway they won't like if you have the laptop that's good enough for them
S0417	yeah
S0415	erm
S0417	so what do we do now do we can we do it now just or be a bite more long or shall i do it
S0416	the sooner the better really
S0415	be just easier and better to do it on a
S0418	hello
S0417	
S0415	it would be easier and better to do it on the computer
S0418	down down
S0417	down
S0417	you know what down be down
S0416	to call them
S0415	it would be easier to just you'd probably be able to
S0415	i tell you what
S0416	what
S0415	write down the bloody tag underneath and just give it to me
S0416	okay
S0417	
S0415	no

S0415	mm okay so write down the tag
S0416	okay
S0417	be you sure you don't mind do it
S0415	do what i won't have to do anything apart from send off an email or whatever well or else if there's a number to ring i'll give it to you and you can just tell them
S0417	okay okay
S0415	the laptop be on but the screen you can't run any diagnostics can't run any diagnostics with the screen anymore because you can't see them so it's get out of jail card
S0417	yeah
S0415	to make it all simple
S0417	okay i know you're busy
S0415	they be very good they be very good well er like
S0415	it'll be ten minutes or else tell you to ring them and i'll
S0417	okay
S0415	stuff can get quite hard to find on their site the number
S0417	okay
S0415	but erm they're quite good in the sense that if you there's no bullshit if you have a collect and return warranty for one year they'll come and collect and return it they'll fix it
S0417	yeah
S0415	they'll come back to you they'll try to sell you an extend warranty it's generally they'll try and sell you two years
S0415	probably around two hundred euros now that's half the price of the laptop nearly so
S0417	yeah
S0415	it be quite steep you've gotta be weigh that up against like that's why i never get them because never usually i don't have problems with laptops like if i have a laptop i never have a problem
S0417	yeah
S0415	it's when the kid have them and they
S0417	yeah you
S0415	they can overheat them and er like blanket and things
S0417	you take care of them though don't you
S0415	like it's just
S0417	yeah and then they kind of just leave them on in the blanket that's the cos they just go off
S0415	i've tell them a million time
S0417	mm
S0418	what what
S0415	what what what
S0415	be that a
S0415	what
S0417	a load of stuff i don't really know
S0415	what's that
S0416	here's the service tag and sorry for not say thank you
S0415	thank er be that be that be it
S0416	mm
S0415	
S0416	mm
S0415	i better not lose this
S0417	okay i could always take a picture of it with my phone
S0415	this be write down you could always
S0416	no i can just
S0415	okay say hello to there see as you have nothing else to do now give him a few weeks after that he'll've be on the xbox the whole time
S0417	well he'll be he'll be with his dad then and they'll be er like they're go on like three holiday so
S0415	when be he go
S0417	it's quite soon really the first of july so it's a week and a half i think
S0415	
S0417	wednesday i think
S0415	and what three holiday be he go on
S0417	iceland
S0415	yeah
S0417	and kind of two by the sea in england i think somewhere just somewhere nearish
S0415	uhu
S0417	so it's not really like they're er and it'll often not be near wifi and that kind of thing
S0417	and obviously 's not that great about make sure he keep take care of things in a way it's probably probably best
S0417	well the thing be he probably won't
S0415	i mean it's a moot point now cos they won't be able to collect it and fix it in time by the time he go anyway so
S0417	yeah
S0415	well it's unlikely
S0417	yeah yeah i think some the things within warranty be rare enough though i'd i'd just be grateful if ever i've have something go wrong it's always like not in warranty any more
S0415	well
S0415	's cpu
S0415	have to get hers hers in warranty or maybe
S0417	they be in warranty be they
