S0446	when do it start
S0352	when do it start
S0326	he's a scot
S0329	you're really
S0352	if only if only our horse have start run just a little bite earlier we'd've win
S0329	i think soll be gonna i just for such a long time i think soll be gonna win
S0446	we have multiple bet on him
S0326	yeah
S0352	have about three bet yeah
S0329	have three bet
S0352	all our all our horse be in in the run at one point
S0326	that's cos know what he's do
S0352	yeah
S0352	yeah
S0329	this be really
S0326	i want to teach me
S0329	teach
S0352	you've just get you've just gotta you've just gotta keep up with it cos like when he he say put saint be each way and i click on that my horse be do over the year
S0326	yeah
S0352	it be like if you if you know you'd be he's run five race thank and come first third third third and third
S0326	yeah that might that might mean he's tire though if he run the horse might be tire then
S0352	but five race wasn't that many
S0446	anyway to be consistent over a year not a horse you punters
S0352	well we don't don't quite know
S0326	i've i've i've win it every time i bet on it you know what i remember bet and get twenty
S0352	yeah but how many time do you bet when you didn't win cos like
S0326	no just the grand national always win it
S0352	we do every year
S0326	no we didn't
S0352	we do it three time
S0326	no we didn't do it every year
S0352	erm yeah 's horse fell it be it be rubi and the grey horse that fell over
S0446	hey if you put a ten
S0446	ten pound on the favourite on on every race for every year odds be that you could be
S0352	favourite never win favourite never win
S0352	but i do think that the favourite be gonna win
S0446	well if the favourite never win there's something wrong
S0446	who be
S0352	it's the bookie's favourite not not our favourite
S0446	it's the odds be calculate by how much money's on on a particular horse
S0446	er so the more people come in that say i want ten pound on
S0352	no but you would start the odds start at some number whatever
S0446	and then that change as to how many people be bet on it
S0352	yeah
S0446	oh right
S0446	so you
S0446	i i have a friend who just spend every day just sit in the bookie's
S0352	can i yeah i know some of his mat

S0352	they're quite similar to giant couscous though
S0446	i think it's the basil like
S0352	mm
S0329	you think that doesn't go
S0352	the what
S0446	doesn't go with anything
S0352	the what

S0329	what be your what be the people what be the space like where you go so when you go to school what be that
S0352	i have i have the old build i have the main build
S0329	mm
S0352	outside's the law of the main build everyone else fuck off to like some shitty so that when you
S0329	actually that's good so you feel important
S0352	i feel like that when you walk in you feel like you're you be at university whereas some people be just somewhere in the build
S0329	so go to that build
S0352	law and land science but law be like grind floor and basement and they go there so

S0329	as i observe
S0329	we this clean lady before and cos she be really rubbish and her but her her daughter who's the exactly the same age as be really good
S0352	no she be
S0329	so sorry and erm she
S0329	but she use to come with her mother on the school holiday and she'd for someone who be such a rubbish cleaner she do a really really good and she would pick up all 's knickers and fold them
S0329	absolutely couldn't bare it that this girl
S0329	and he would be sit there kind of slobbed out and this pretty girl she be
S0352	mm
S0329	she be pretty as well wasn't she
S0352	she be alright
S0329	she be pretty anyway right so
S0326	she be actually like quite cool i think
S0329	so you've get to get up and someone's come to empty your bin
S0329	okay
S0329	can see that as quite stressful way to start the day
S0329	i make coffee in my little thing that you buy me
S0446	oh you you don't even go to the kitchen
S0326	i don't go to the i don't enter their kitchen
S0352	you're like that weird boy aren't you you be the weird boy

S0329	yeah be nice to him
S0329	might be like might have problems
S0326	i think it's actually totally understandable that if you don't wanna really use like a weird share kitchen and like
S0329	why don't you want to use a kitchen
S0352	why's that weird
S0326	and you have to like do like weird chitchat with like people you know

S0352	compare to like two pound less three pound less four pound less
S0329	a week

S0329	two pound less a week
S0352	so i'll pay four pound less a week
S0352	cos i've get a worse
