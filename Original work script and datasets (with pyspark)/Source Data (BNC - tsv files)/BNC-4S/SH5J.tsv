S0104	suddenly
S0110	suddenly
S0104	everybody's the the authorities have get scar but so from go do nothing they're they're
S0110	nothing
S0104	go mental over arrest everybody
S0379	but then why be these people like jimmy savile give so much power
S0104	i don't know why he be yeah
S0379	to walk into a hospital and
S0104	well i
S0379	the nurse say don't let him be anywhere near me
S0104	yeah
S0379	and make sure you don't leave him in the room at the same time
S0104	because the the the if if the individual nurse make any er they be sack weren't they cos the because i can only think he raise so much money for these place
S0379	oh yeah i'm sure he do i know he do
S0104	yeah
S0379	a lot for stoke mandeville
S0104	but that's why they let him get away with it because it without him they didn't you know stoke mandeville be a charity hospital wasn't it without him they lose a massive massive amount of revenue income
S0379	so they're put all their patients
S0104	yeah
S0379	at risk
S0104	it would seem so you know the odd
S0379	for money
S0104	the odd patient get grope
S0110	it be nineteen seventy
S0104	yeah it be a very different age with different attitudes wasn't it we've get to remember that
S0167	that's
S0379	well you say about
S0110	mm
S0379	stuart hall and
S0104	yeah
S0379	all them people it's a knockout
S0104	yeah
S0379	kid jenson will they investigate all of them now then
S0104	well i think if there's allegations make against them they'll investigate everybody
S0379	and what happen about dave lee travis then
S0104	well he be acquit i mean he's just be destroy hasn't he
S0379	mm
S0104	but i do believe there's another case come up against him at some point
S0379	because when you look on the telly when they arrest that rolf harris his
S0104	yeah
S0379	wife be
S0104	oh my god she's
S0379	she
S0104	like an old she look like his mother
S0379	yeah and she look absolutely horrify surely she must have have an idea
S0104	i don't know but his daughter stand by him all the way through
S0379	mm
S0104	but even though it be her best you know childhood friend who make the allegation
S0379	mm terrible
S0110	i mean that's
S0104	but i just i i'm you know if they do it they do it and they deserve whatever but i just can't believe that all of them do that
S0379	yeah it's like they're look who can we have that
S0104	yeah
S0379	shock factor on now because like
S0110	all these people there's somebody oh oh actually i remember when somebody touch me you know
S0104	yeah
S0110	you know somebody felt my arse when i be you know
S0104	mm
S0110	so it happen get over it
S0104	yeah
S0379	but then to go
S0110	cos my isn't it
S0379	but then to go
S0110	otherwise everyone would be in jail
S0104	you know
S0110	wouldn't they you know
S0379	to go to portugal and
S0104	mm
S0110	yeah
S0379	and question cliff richard
S0104	yeah
S0110	yeah
S0104	i can't believe it of him but like the the dave lee travis thing for instance now i'm not talk about the full paedophilia here the jimmy saviles i think stuart hall
S0110	yeah
S0104	probably all that those who really seriously abuse children
S0110	mm yes it's different
S0104	that's a different thing but the dave lee travis you know you've get to remember we're back in the seventies here he be a good look young dj with a lot of
S0379	yeah
S0104	young girls chase after him round corner and i'm not say it be right but it be kind of socially more socially acceptable
S0379	acceptable
S0104	then for them to for fifteen year olds who probably look about nineteen you know quick quick grope in the corridor or a quick hand up the skirt and it's wrong and i know but it
S0379	but it happen
S0104	it happen then
S0110	it happen yeah that's what i'm say it's
S0104	and i'm not say that it's not good but er that's
S0110	yeah
S0104	you know it's good that that have change and
S0110	yeah
S0104	men can't
S0110	yeah
S0104	go round
S0110	yeah
S0104	put
S0110	yeah
S0104	their hand up girls' skirt
S0110	no
S0104	and everyone giggle and think
S0110	yeah
S0104	it's a bite of a laugh but that's a it be a and you can't judge past things on today's standards
S0379	no
S0104	and i don't think he do anything wrong by the standards of his day
S0110	no
S0104	i don't think he be a paedophile i think he be a young man
S0110	mm
S0104	with a lot of
S0110	yeah
S0104	silly young girls chase after
S0379	yeah
S0104	him
S0104	i mean when you look at these pop concert of the bay city rollers
S0104	yeah
S0379	and girls faint
S0104	yeah
S0379	and the beatlemania
S0104	yeah
S0110	mm
S0379	and i'm sure you just get sweep along
S0104	i know completely disagree with me on this one
S0110	oh do you
S0104	don't you
S0110	do you
S0167	oh i don't wanna talk about it again
S0104	oh no go on because it
S0167	i just can't be bother to
S0104	it's quite
S0167	this morning i just can't be bother
S0110	yeah
S0104	oh
S0167	we've talk about it before
S0104	i know but i can't remember what your argument be and it be it be a valid argument it make sense but i just i just still
S0167	i just don't wanna get can i just say it and then
S0104	yeah
S0167	i just
S0110	yeah right
S0167	can't be bother to get into a big debate
S0104	we won't we won't debate it
S0110	no we won't comment no
S0104	you just say
S0167	i can't be bother to get into a debate
S0110	right
S0167	this morning
S0110	right
S0167	but i just say that they firstly your comment about them run around arrest everyone be untrue they're only arrest people there's allegations against and you can't not arrest people if there's
S0104	yeah
S0167	an allegation
S0104	yeah fair enough
S0167	and the other thing be
S0104	but i don't think they're look into the
S0110	but but
S0104	investigations far enough before they
S0167	okay well that's a different issue
S0104	before they're make the arrest
S0167	they have to make the arrest
S0104	yeah
S0167	or whatever and if they do do it be still illegal at that time and it be still a criminal offense and then they're only put them away for as much as they would have be put away at that time they're not judge it on the sentence of this day which be
S0104	mm
S0167	what they always do with any historical allegations anyway
S0104	mm
S0167	and if something be do illegally and someone complain what else can the police do other than erm send them to prison or do whatever the law say that you can do like if you say
S0104	mm
S0167	someone's burgle my house oh well
S0104	
S0110	what be i do with this
S0104	that one
S0167	that's bad no one get hurt never mind
S0104	yeah no i yeah i see your point
S0167	if someone's make the allegations what can they do they have to
S0104	mm i can see your point but i
S0167	i just don't see another way around it
S0104	don't think these allegations against you know i'm talk
S0167	yeah i'm sure there's a lot of fake ones
S0104	i'm not talk about children i'm talk about late mid to late teens where i don't suppose at the time he think he be do anything wrong because it be
S0167	no no i agree but
S0104	kind of the mm
S0167	if it's illegal and he do it and then that
S0104	yeah
S0167	person's complain whether how rightly or wrongly that be something
S0110	yeah mum's say they shouldn't complain and they should
S0104	yeah
S0110	have move on by now
S0167	but that's a different
S0104	move on with your life
S0167	that's a different issue though isn't it
S0110	get on with it you know yeah
S0167	the fact be they have complain
S0104	because er maybe at the time
S0167	and there's no other way around it

S0110	yeah no
S0104	but
S0110	mm
S0104	have have winnie for a month and winnie's lovely and
S0110	mm
S0104	i enjoy have her
S0379	what be she
S0104	she's a cross pug and french bulldog
S0110	horrible thing
S0379	she's really sweet
S0104	she's quite ugly but in a cute sort of way
S0110	get things about this legs about that thick
S0104	anyway
S0110	that arse it's horrible
S0104	i quite enjoy have her but it make me actually realise that i would never ever get a dog of my own i can't cope with that everything you do you have to equate the dog into the factor and and consider them everything you can't just pop out and think oh let's go out
S0379	i must admit we use to with edie she wasn't a problem
S0104	yeah
S0379	she could bark though but use to tell her to be quiet it's alright edie 's here and she use to shout
S0104	why
S0379	i'm all alone but use to say it's alright edie
S0104	what do she shout through the wall to her
S0379	yeah
S0104	oh right
S0379	oh i'm all alone i'm oh i'm all alone
S0104	yeah
S0379	and erm we'll see i think because i make her into a pudding and alice it's my fault and now we
S0104	so why didn't you with edie then why be you
S0379	it's a different type of dog i mean when you look at edie lucy and alice
S0104	yeah but you say you
S0379	they're all completely different
S0104	yeah but you say you've make them you you've mollycoddle them which you didn't with edie that's what you say
S0379	i don't think i mollycoddle edie as much as i do lucy and alice
S0104	why so didn't you learn your lesson with lucy
S0379	i don't know but then i think alice be what i would call a very happy dog
S0104	mm well edie be a happy dog
S0379	lucy weren't
S0104	no no lucy be a psycho dog
S0104	but anyway winnie be really sweet and i guess maybe it's because she wasn't mine and i be a bite more aware of i didn't want her to you know if we go out in the even oh can we leave winnie for that long can we and one day it wasn't
S0379	but do you leave her here
S0104	yeah we do leave her for a few time but one it wasn't too bad because mum be stay here at the same time so during the day if i be sleep or if i be on the twelve hour shift but then mum go and stay with for a week one week while we have her and erm so i be on a twelve hour shift on a monday so i be well actually two lot of mondays and i think well what can i i can't leave her on her own for twelve or thirteen hours by the time i've get there so i have to leave work and luckily be on so i i wasn't the only train nurse in the build leave work for an hour come home at lunchtime take her out for a walk fee her or not fee her she would get her food and go back to work
