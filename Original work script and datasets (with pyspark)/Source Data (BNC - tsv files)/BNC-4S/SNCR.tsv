S0654	yeah would be amaze
S0653	i think lot of people would like to do that
S0652	mm
S0653	what do think they would do it for
S0654	mm
S0655	what do you mean
S0653	what do you think they would use their power for
S0654	mm probably see erm if they get the answer wrong in the spell test or get the answer wrong on something and then they could see the ways to make an amaze machine and then they could create it do it instead of the person that do it and
S0653	mm
S0652	or maybe fast forward time to see what the lottery number be and then pick them and win
S0653	do you know what the lottery be
S0655	yeah erm you buy a card and then you write down number from one to nine or be it one to ten
S0653	so can you be it five number
S0652	yeah
S0653	i've never do it
S0652	five number from one to fifty isn't it or one to forty nine
S0655	yeah it's five yeah
S0653	you've get to choose five number
S0655	yeah
S0652	and a bonus number
S0653	and if you and a bonus number why the bonus number
S0655	mm
S0652	that's the bonus ball
S0653	what be that
S0652	you get five number and then the bonus ball so if you get all five number plus the bonus ball you win
S0653	so it's six number then that's six number then isn't it
S0652	er
S0653	why be it a bonus ball why doesn't it just have six number
S0652	well because you win a prize for five number as well so if you get four number and a bonus ball then
S0653	okay so last week two people in this country win thirty three million pound each
S0655	oh there be some people who through they'd win the lottery but hadn't enter it properly
S0653	oh no
S0652	yeah
S0655	and then they and then they
S0652	just imagine
S0655	and then they have win really
S0653	oh yes they hadn't get their credit or something or i don't know
S0655	yeah and then they and then they they couldn't afford a lawyer cos they be break
S0653	right
S0655	i think or something like that
S0653	they just need to admit defeat i think don't they
S0652	mm
S0655	no but the want but they really want a case
S0653	but can the prove that they get the ticket that they do the number
S0655	not sure yet
S0653	i guess if they're the number they choose every single week
S0652	mm
S0653	but last week cos it be a very big one the the internet kind of the website keep break cos so many people be try to last minute buy a ticket which be just ridiculous i think thirty three million pound be too much for one person to have i think they should just make it smaller amount of money so like five hundred thousand pound and more people to win i think that would be better
S0654	yeah yeah
S0653	cos then they would all carry on with their live as normal but their live would just be a little bite easier
S0654	yeah
S0653	but thirty three million your live your live completely change don't they
S0655	mm
S0652	mm
S0653	not always for the better
S0652	if i win thirty three million pound
S0653	you'd buy thirty one million pound worth of chocolate spread
S0652	how do you know these things
S0652	i would buy
S0653	yes
S0652	an entire apartment block in
S0653	right
S0652	and i would invite friends and family to be able to stay there whenever they want but the top one would be mine
S0653	okay
S0652	so hard up people hard up friends friends who be struggle
S0653	mm
S0652	would be able to have one to themselves
S0653	forever
S0652	forever
S0653	what if they trash the place
S0652	i'd kick them out but they wouldn't trash the place cos they'd be particular people wouldn't they
S0655	yeah
S0653	what would you guy buy
S0652	there'd be a raffle i'd do a raffle so it would be fair raffle off apartments
S0653	mm
S0655	well i think if i have three million pound
S0654	if that happen you'd have to let me and live in the top apartment with you
S0652	of course
S0654	cos you're cos you're soon gonna marry her
S0652	of course
S0655	i'd probably
S0652	and there would be babysitters on hand just in case mummy want to pop out and do the hoop for a while
S0652	which would be downstairs in the in the basement gym which have swim pool and jacuzzi
S0654	i would definitely get
S0652	and water slide
S0653	let say what he want to do okay what would you like to do
S0655	if i have three million pound i'd probably add a pole from my room
S0653	a fireman's pole you're obsess with fireman's pole in your room aren't you
S0652	oh right okay
S0655	and then that would lead down to the live room
S0653	okay
S0655	so whenever you say can you come down here to because want to cuddle you and then i could go okay and then i could see mm water slide or pole
S0652	wow water slide
S0653	oh there's a water slide as well
S0655	yeah there's a water slide erm there's there's half stairs and half water slide so you can use the stairs
S0653	instead of stairs would this be in our house
S0655	yeah an escalator to the top
S0653	but our stairs be very thin
S0655	well an escalator to go up and a water slide to go down and a pole and a po
S0653	what if it's a cold day though
S0652	i think we might have to extend the house out into the garden and not have a garden in order for that to happen or what you could do be build it up and have a flat roof and have like a a garden terrace on the top
S0652	that would be nice wouldn't it
S0654	yeah and a swim pool on and a jacuzzi
S0652	what on the top as well
S0653	and a jacuzzi
S0655	well you would like
S0652	swim pool and jacuzzi on the top
S0654	no in our bedrooms
S0655	yeah we could like take the roof off and build an extension up and then put the roof on so we can have some
S0652	i think we might have to possibly buy another house if we want all this
S0655	mm
S0653	i know you won't want to do that will you
S0655	no
S0652	now what we could do be we could keep the house at the moment not not sell it and get another house and then when you're old enough if you want to use that house or live there you could
S0655	and pay the or i could pay the neighbour to move out
S0653	i tell you he wouldn't want to move from that house
S0652	which which ones which neighbour would you tell to move out
S0653	cos then you could build on the grind couldn't you quite a lot
S0652	mm
S0655	yeah
S0653	oh you be funny i say to the other night i say if you show a house in with a swim pool and a gym and a lovely massive garden you could have a adventure playground in there and like a tv room and all this kind of stuff you'd still want to have the house that we live in now
S0655	that that be true that be true
S0654	we could have the like slide to go in that house
S0655	mostly because that house do not exist in
S0652	yeah
S0653	i couldn't hear what you be say if you decide to go in that house be that what you say
S0654	if want to live in that in our house
S0653	he can
S0654	and
S0653	but you're go to be in the one with the swim pool
S0654	but he want but he want to also go in the other house he can just go
S0653	he could go and visit the other house couldn't he
S0654	i'm go to slide yeah and and then go there for wee yay
S0653	go there for swim
S0652	i can just see get get out the back of a limo with big sunglasses and load of shop bag
S0653	yeah
S0652	stroll up to the
