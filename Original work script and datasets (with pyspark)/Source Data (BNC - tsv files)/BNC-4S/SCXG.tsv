S0588	yes
S0590	in situ
S0588	yeah
S0590	you know to to where i want to trim it
S0591	now these be the ones
S0589	er they sell that make yeah but they do it online
S0591	you have

S0588	really pay dividends
S0590	yes
S0588	then didn't it

S0588	all those years ago cos it
S0590	cos er i've do i mean i've do i do our din room ones at at er
S0588	yes
S0590	i mean we we don't have it any longer we sell it
S0590	when we move down to number from
S0588	yes yeah
S0590	but that be more difficult because the seat you couldn't remove they be
S0588	oh
S0590	part of it
S0588	yeah that must be
S0590	so that er be more challenge i think
S0588	mm
S0590	but no i think they look they look yeah yeah
S0588	that must be quite a fun process actually cos you have all er depend on what you're do
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	some be more challenge than others and
S0588	yeah i mean this these sort of things
S0588	yeah exactly
S0590	be stitch
S0588	yes
S0590	job erm
S0588	well do they
S0590	you know
S0588	they must stitch them
S0590	i mean i never ever
S0588	when they're
S0590	ever get onto something like this i wish i have
S0588	do they stitch them before they've put them on
S0590	well they they must stitch things like this cos that's all all stitch and pip so they
S0588	yeah pip yes
S0590	obviously take templates and things and
S0588	yeah
S0590	and measure that but then these that bite be stitch in situ and
S0588	oh so it's all
S0590	you need a very special
S0588	all about the measure and
S0590	a needle yeah yeah
S0588	shape and the
S0590	yeah
S0588	pattern
S0590	and the pattern
S0588	and the yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	mm
S0590	yeah
S0588	quite a fine art
S0591	it's a period piece
S0588	that chair
S0591	yes mm
S0588	oh i think so yes
S0590	mm
S0588	so far as i know
S0590	yeah
S0588	that's 's chair though isn't it so she might want that back as well
S0591	well yes
S0590	she may not want anything back actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	when she when she's redesign everything i should think
S0589	yeah
S0588	cos be she go for something different er to her usual style
S0590	mm
S0590	it's look very modern isn't it
S0589	i don't know
S0590	yeah
S0588	mm
S0589	just look like a municipal hospital
S0590	what you mean you think her her design be
S0589	that's what everyone say
S0588	maybe she like that look though
S0590	oh no i think it be a rather beautiful design and and make clever use of it's a design that allow for privacy for neighbour as well as lot of light and windows for themselves
S0588	yes
S0590	you know so it it work to the benefit of of everybody because the people
S0590	the house that's behind them be actually higher up erm
S0588	mm
S0590	but there's quite a big garden
S0588	yeah
S0590	to the wall of the wall garden where their place be
S0588	they be yes
S0590	so they're not sort of here and there it's not a totally in your face thing
S0588	uhu
S0590	but erm if they build it up well when they build it up the the the first floor that they're build because of course it's a bungalow at the minute would be above the level of the wall so you'd be able
S0588	mm
S0590	to see into the garden and things so but the design that 's create er negate that very well actually
S0588	mm clever
S0591	it's a good one
S0590	yeah
S0588	mm
S0591	they've gotta find bloody job first before then can
S0590	yeah
S0591	do this
S0588	there's always that
S0591	fancy business
S0588	slight inconvenience isn't there
S0590	convenience yes
S0590	well we actually think that they be in for five years to save all their pennies in order to be able to do the
S0588	that's what i think
S0590	new development
S0588	but they've
S0590	but they
S0588	spend it have they
S0590	well yes when you think they've be to they've spend it on travel and they'll most certainly be spend it
S0588	come back again
S0590	by the time they've get back to the uk
S0591	yeah
S0588	yeah mm
S0590	it it will all have go and so
S0588	it's easy to do though isn't it
S0590	i mean yeah i mean they've have a fabulous
S0588	well exactly
S0590	er thing i mean they go off
S0588	yeah
S0590	to australia in about three weeks' time and then
S0588	and they it's not like they're gonna have a problem get a job really cos they've both get
S0590	no no no

S0590	dog have master and cat have staff
S0589	mm
S0590	it's like that's
S0589	if that's not it
S0590	that's even better actually
S0589	it very well could be
S0588	it be quite good
S0589	that's rather better than the one i'm try to think of actually
S0590	well be a wordsmith
S0590	i've just wake up to the fact that erm what's that team call
S0589	arsenal
S0590	arsenal be do rather badly
S0589	yeah terribly since the new year top of the league er on new year's day
S0589	be they
S0591	mm
S0589	and they haven't win anything since then
S0589	they've win a couple of game
S0590	yeah
S0589	they've be knock out
S0590	and
S0589	of two competitions
S0590	really so how can they go from be top of the league to be nobody at all
S0589	well
S0590	and
S0588	good question
S0589	good question
S0590	yeah and how's leicester
S0589	they're still top dear
S0590	to think they i mean that'll be amaze if they go because weren't they on the point of relegation or something
S0589	er last year they be yeah
S0590	yeah
S0591	what do you think of the erm welsh english game
S0589	terrific
S0591	yeah another ten minutes and the wales the welsh might have win them
S0589	yeah
S0591	they leave it too late the
S0590	or conversely if they'd wake up ten minutes earlier
S0591	well yeah the
S0590	er in the match they yeah
S0591	they be run off their feet in the first half really but we haven't hear from have you since
S0590	no
S0591	that's right
S0590	cos come over for the match
S0591	there's
S0589	do he
S0591	there's devotion
S0590	yes well i mean he come over very regularly to see his parent actually but it coincide with a match if it can
S0591	in cardiff
S0590	which be the other end of wales of where his parent live it must be say but his son live there so yeah
S0591	where do they live do you know where it be
S0590	no
S0589	in wales
S0590	can't quite no it's in the north of wales yeah
S0591	it be yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	what do you think of plan for all school to become academies
S0590	well
S0588	what do it mean exactly
S0590	well it it mean that they they cease to be under control of the of the local
S0588	authority
S0590	county council the local authority actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	they get fund directly by the government so it actually mean that each school have more control over how it spend its money
S0588	oh okay
S0590	erm
S0591	i think it's all explain in
S0590	so
S0591	in the independent isn't it
S0589	we'll read that
S0591	yeah
S0590	be it indeed
S0588	yeah be that
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	a good thing or a bad thing
S0590	erm it very much depend
S0588	well a double
S0590	well it depend
S0588	edge sword then or
S0590	er
S0588	yeah
S0590	because some counties be probably very good at handle the finance of all the school within the county
S0588	yeah
S0590	conversely some head will be very good at handle their own but
S0588	yes
S0590	but er some head will be completely at sea
S0588	mm
S0590	it'll probably require each school to have much more of a business manager
S0588	oh yes of course yeah
S0590	within them erm
S0588	mm
S0590	so er you know it's er it's a very sort of sweep statement
S0588	i wonder why though
S0590	they've also they've yeah good question
S0588	but do you know what the motive for it be
S0590	no
S0588	they've usually get a motive
S0590	yeah
S0588	this government haven't they
S0590	they they've also say there be no need for school up until now it's i didn't realise this actually there be a statutory requirement to have
S0590	parent at least one parent governor
S0588	yeah
S0590	erm and that be no longer a statutory requirement although i actually think it's a very good thing to have a parent governor
S0588	mm
S0588	compulsory maths lessons
S0588	until eighteen
S0590	the other thing they're suggest or the
S0589	crazy
S0590	be that
S0588	mm
S0590	the school day should be extend by an hour so instead of three
S0588	yeah
S0590	would go on till four
S0588	it seem awfully short
S0590	well i quite agree with you actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah i think
S0589	well it's never factor in when people have the debate about the percentage of privately educate students get into say oxbridge as oppose to from erm
S0590	from a state yeah
S0589	state school they never mention that
S0588	that they get an extra hour
S0589	if you go a private school you you've have
S0588	an extra hour
S0589	an additional half day saturday at school
S0590	yeah yeah
S0589	every week that you've be at school
S0588	yeah
S0590	plus hours for each day
S0589	plus additional hours
S0588	so five five hours a week
S0589	every single day so the sum of your education
S0590	be twice as long
S0589	be be vastly
S0590	yeah longer
S0589	yeah longer than someone from a state school
S0588	five time a hundred and fifty two
S0589	cos you see state school students i mean you know old a level students wander home at half three four
S0590	oh well school finish at three
S0589	well
S0588	yeah
S0589	we'd be midway through your day
S0590	yeah exactly
S0588	yeah
S0589	you still have two hours or lessons
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	i mean it's that's not rocket science either be it
S0590	no
S0588	the reason why
S0590	yeah
S0588	they're more successful
S0589	mm it's only one of the reason there also be obviously an inbuilt institutional
S0590	expectation
S0588	social reason
S0589	institutionalise poshism
S0588	social reason
S0590	well there be
S0588	oh well no
S0590	no i think there be also sort of build in expectations
S0588	yeah that's the social reason
S0590	which and usually erm almost inevitably not necessarily for good reason but there's far more parental support than in a state school a state school
S0589	yeah
S0590	you know there oodles of well i in fact i remember somebody be once eventually expel from the local upper school you know for and you know you can imagine if somebody eventually get push out a state school you know they've really go beyond the pale the parent be absolutely delight he could go off and start earn
S0589	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	you know that that be actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	the parental
S0588	but
S0590	response
S0588	yes
S0589	whereas at my school
S0590	and of course that be the reason you know why the boy be as far off track as he be actually
S0588	mm exactly
S0589	and at my school it's just assume it's not even a question that
S0591	hello
S0589	you go to university after a level
S0590	yeah exactly
S0589	that's why you do a level
S0590	yeah yeah
S0589	cos that determine what university you go to
S0590	yeah and you tend to come from a parental body
S0589	and
S0590	who've be there before you anyway
S0589	yeah but also no matter what your academic ability that be the assumption
S0590	yeah yes
S0589	er the only exceptions be a few people who be go into their parents' business
S0590	yes yeah
S0589	but that i mean we're talk about
S0590	yeah
S0589	one percent
S0590	yeah
S0589	and i can only think of one one or two people who do that
S0590	yeah
S0588	i need to check the potatoes
S0589	let's just get this flame again
S0590	yeah i think yes it's
S0589	oh it be open that's strange oh so be that er wouldn't expect that to go whoosh
S0590	mm
S0589	with the vent and everything
S0590	i be er well i say to how be you neighbour and it be only when i be ask her that that i suddenly think i mean and i be refer to these and then i suddenly think hang on there wasn't anybody there in february when i be last here
S0589	uhu
S0590	so they you know the neighbour who have just move in be the ones over the road
S0589	yeah
S0590	but you've now get them there and next door

S0589	tell them off when they'd dump some stuff they didn't want on the street
S0589	so go to tell them off and have they have to ring a friend
S0589	who speak some english and then take it off the
S0590	off the street yeah
S0589	the street it be quite good
S0590	actually that's that's what you have to do actually really in a sense quite nicely just say to people well actually we don't do that

S0590	here
S0589	uhu
S0590	yeah
