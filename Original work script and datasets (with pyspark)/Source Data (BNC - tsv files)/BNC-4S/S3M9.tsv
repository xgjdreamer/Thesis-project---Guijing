S0331	youtube
S0326	remember what
S0328	yeah
S0326	can remember what
S0328	what question be ask
S0326	all that kind of and like be they say ask what your favourite food be and say honestly i just i really like apples
S0326	and 's like and 's like
S0328	that's a bite
S0326	bullshit i've know you for ten years and i've never see you eat an apple
S0330	that's really good
S0328	it's like what we should have say be dishonestly
S0326	or
S0328	apples
S0328	but yeah basically
S0330	no i've never see him eat an apple
S0328	cos we be like
S0331	i want an apple
S0328	i would like to see you like hungry
S0328	drive up to a roadside after a long drive there's two options apples
S0328	or hot tacos
S0328	yeah
S0331	do you eat load of tacos
S0328	uhu yeah it's harder to come by a taco than we would have like in miguel
S0331	really
S0328	it be like two place like street food place
S0331	yeah
S0328	and they're they're not always open
S0331	so what what about this restaurant 's restaurant or not
S0328	
S0328	his restaurant i i actually think be like not very good it's quite fancy like
S0331	it do look look a bite fancy
S0328	i think it's for tourists
S0331	yeah
S0328	he have a really good reputation
S0331	yeah
S0328	but it's it's quite it's a
S0331	be it
S0328	it's a little bite er a little bite like with a mexican twist
S0331	right
S0328	you know
S0330	yeah yeah
S0331	yeah yeah
S0326	but actually i think that the food that he or they make on that on like the chef's dinner be it be much better his normal food
S0331	yeah
S0326	that stuff be good
S0328	oh yeah yeah that be nice he do like a mexican dinner
S0331	oh
S0328	but i guess there's yeah
S0331	so it's be just like
S0328	it's just there's a certain way
S0331	load of people act
S0328	there's a certain way to make money
S0331	but you know it's different though cos that's what everyone like to eat
S0328	also in that kind of spot maybe that's
S0331	everyone like
S0328	you know the
S0331	like to eat normal food but sell
S0331	expensive food it's a bite funny
S0328	i think that's the thing maybe it's just like my take this be there be like it be like super like
S0331	no
S0328	mm
S0331	great
S0328	really like beautifully carefully make but it wasn't like just like street food and i think i just like one or the other it be it be a bite like showy like
S0331	yeah
S0328	sort of semi fancy but just like expensive normal stuff
S0330	yeah
S0326	it be like that
S0328	but he do really well you know
S0330	that's cool
S0328	they're open up this they're it's like a ranch er in the country like
S0330	a ranch
S0328	they've buy the land and they're fix it up so it should be ready like some time next year his girlfriend be like i be like what be you gonna have on the ranch she's like i dunno like horse porks
S0330	what
S0328	cos she be mexican so
