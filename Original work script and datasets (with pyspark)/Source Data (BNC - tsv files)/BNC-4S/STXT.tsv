S0246	you can go on benefit if you're too fat to work
S0249	do you want a
S0245	yeah
S0249	where my jacket's thing or
S0246	yeah he he's on benefit cos he's too fat to work
S0245	yeah
S0246	yeah i didn't know that be a thing
S0245	yeah
S0249	yeah yeah he be
S0246	it's cos he cos it's a class as a
S0249	do you know you know that you know
S0246	be it class as a disability
S0249	yeah because you know the really really the fattest man in britain
S0246	yeah
S0249	the one who's an absolute dickhead
S0246	mm
S0249	he get so big he couldn't work and he earn more than someone who have a full time good job earn right and then he have to get a a bypass because no what's it call
S0400	gastric band
S0249	gastric band and then he lose load and load of weight to obviously because he couldn't eat as much so they take he a lot of his carers off him so he start kick off about that
S0246	oh yeah i saw that
S0249	say how he deserve this
S0246	no he be like
S0249	his money halve
S0246	yeah cos he be like he wasn't he like i wish i'd die
S0249	yeah and like everyone be like so do everyone fuck else
S0246	cos they take his care away
S0249	take his care care allowance off him
S0246	well i just think that be because he be so fat he couldn't walk but he have load of other health issue so he wouldn't have be able to work anyway i didn't realise like if you be obese
S0249	yeah
S0246	like that
S0249	yeah
S0246	and you can but you can still walk
S0249	yeah
S0246	that you can be on benefit
S0249	yeah
S0249	cos you've get health issue cos of it because you get swell knees and stuff like that don't you and like your feet you your feet like start hurt and it can be a
S0246	see
S0249	bad for your bone when i'm just like
S0245	bad for your bone
S0249	really stop eat all them foods
S0246	do you see that erm oh what be it do you see that thing and it be like nineteen forties britain or something like that and they like go back to benefit then and they bring load of like people that be supposedly disable there be a guy and he be in a wheelchair cos he be bear with some sort of like disease but he want to work he want a job and stuff like that so basically what they use to do be cos obviously after the war they lose a lot of men so there wasn't a lot of workers be they'd bring people that
S0246	be on like that be disable
S0246	and that suppose they couldn't work here they'd give them an assessment by a doctor send them somewhere like basically say you can do this this and this maybe and then they'd go and assess them in a work placement somewhere
S0249	mm
S0246	and then if it be too much for them then they'd be like you can't work there we'll try and find you something else or they'd like make them like do it and there be this one woman on it and erm what they do to her be they she go to see a doctor and she be like i've get all these things wrong with me and he be like right okay he say but you can work you can sit behind a desk and you can type he be like
S0249	mm
S0246	there's nothing wrong with your finger
S0249	yeah
S0246	and that and then basically bring around like a house spy cos apparently they use to send these people round
S0249	yeah
S0246	to come and assess them in the live situation but what they be actually do be spy on them to see if they be actually like properly disable or they be just like basically take the piss
S0249	yeah
S0246	so this woman go in basically say she's fine to work she be proper kick off and everything refuse she be like i'm not work and then the benefit office be like well a doctor and this woman's clear you for work you either work or we take all your benefit off you and she be like nearly cry and they be like no they be like you've be clear you can work you're go to work
S0249	piss me off it's like
S0246	and er but that poor lad in the wheelchair all he want to do be work
S0249	yeah a lot of them do though
S0246	and that cos he be bear with it and he couldn't and then he go and do this thing and he be dead happy cos he be outside and everything like that in this fresh air and that and then they be like it's too much it be too much hard labour on on his upper body or
S0249	yeah
S0246	stuff or it be so sad
S0245	it distress me if there's no fish i keep expect there to be a fish but there never be

S0249	and like take them home i should have buy one shouldn't i and then we could have have it today
S0245	yeah
S0246	do you know
S0400	basically what he's just say be i've have a job so i be allow to be fat
S0400	because the government's pay for me to be fat because i haven't just sit on my arse i have have a job oh dear
S0249	the people no the best people be the ones where they're on benefit because
S0246	mm
S0249	and they sit and say well my mum and dad work all their live
S0246	oh yeah
S0249	so i'm entitle those be the people that i that i don't like
S0246	yeah there be a lass in erm the paper and erm her and her boyfriend get that many benefit cos they have a child mainly so they would get money er they have a flat in london that be proper beautiful flat they have all the expensive things in it because they'd get basically like in a year they probably maybe get sixty grand worth
S0249	oh my god
S0246	of benefit and her excuse be well my parent have work all their life and pay tax so i'm just basically take back what they've pay
S0245	yeah definitely
S0249	yeah
S0246	and like
S0249	those be
S0246	well you haven't though
S0249	well we be talk to 's friend she like she's from she live in and like i dunno what's go on with her but she live with her mum but i think her mum's move in with her boyfriend it be something like that i
S0249	er so she's have to pay for a flat on her own and like and she be say for like basically do you remember what have like when he be in the flat
S0246	mm
S0249	yeah that
S0246	a bedsit
S0249	yeah like a bedsit thing except they call it a studio apartment like basically like that five hundred pound a month
S0246	fuck it
S0245	amen
S0246	mm that's what 's in at uni
S0245	mm
S0246	like her own bedsit
S0249	but what be hilarious be that when move to when she come for a year well she be on this bus to come for a couple of months and she end up stay for the year she be like stay with like her mum's friend for a while which they live like just outside so she just use to like commute in kind of thing but cos she work in a café and she say basically that she like after like i think it be like a week or something like that she have to leave because erm like her mum's friend er be have problems with her husband and they be like essentially like gonna get a divorce and stuff and she'd find out like a load of stuff that he'd be do and things like that so cos it be so awkward for her to be there
S0246	mm
S0249	she she have to leave
S0246	mm
S0249	erm and stuff and i be just like awkward
S0246	mm
S0245	awkward
S0246	no my sister erm her bedsit it's like quite expensive cos the bed they're like a a apartment but cos she get a single one it's not as expensive as some of them and there's a lass she know who get a double one pay triple the price and her room's smaller so like how do they work that out
S0249	it's like it be like that at cos basically you pay more if you have like a double bed and stuff
S0246	mm
S0249	like that erm but when we be apply they have a discount off so basically the the price of have a double bed be basically the the normal price of have a single one
S0246	mm
S0249	but they have no single bed leave at this point cos we be like really late in apply
S0246	mm
S0249	so we have to get a double anyways but like i would be more than happy with just have a single bed like our like i'm so use to sleep in a single bed
S0249	and that but yeah it consider how much we be pay
S0246	mm
S0249	the size of our flat for five people be unreal
S0246	mm
S0400	oh that one that we stay in
S0249	yeah five of us live there and that kitchen be like what to that fish tank to there

S0246	that be do my head in cos the bedrooms weren't even very big be they
S0249	no they weren't 's be like the biggest but what be really bad for him be because he be back on to the live room if like he be go to bed and someone be still up watch the telly or whatever like would come in and play her guitar then he could hear everything
S0246	mm
S0245	yeah
S0249	and sometimes she would come in and she would sit down and she would just sit and have a bitch about them all and
S0245	especially if you're
