S0231	six
S0198	what do it say
S0231	when it say speak speak into it
S0198	six kilometres into miles six kilometres into miles i didn't wait for it to say speak now kilometres to miles send me to a google page do i click on it
S0231	yeah
S0198	do it not work i think i miss it slightly
S0231	no
S0198	i'm not very good with technology yet i've haven't have those fangled devices for as long as
S0231	six kilometres into miles three miles
S0198	three ah
S0231	i wanna punch in the head
S0198	no yeah that's right though
S0231	six kilometres
S0198	yeah yeah yeah it's three point what miles
S0231	three point seven miles
S0198	it's just the way the computer pick up the language that's one of the things actually that
S0231	you have to be quite loud
S0198	yeah it's one of the that's one of the things that some linguistics have go into like people that do my master's it's how to programme stuff like that that do pick up the different accent
S0231	oh right
S0198	so like some of the stuff that i can this research be use for be how to make technology better so that when someone with a strong accent use it actually it pick up on it so one of the biggest criticisms of the iphone the siri thing be that it can understand my my friends could write texts message use just voice command on their iphones rich people

S0231	unless there's a cycle line that run up beside the
S0198	yeah yeah which would be nice if there be but i don't actually know i guess we'll figure that out pretty quickly

S0231	but this do everything it's only little but it do everything that their phone do
S0198	so where do you find your phone and your contract cos i'm at the moment
S0231	three network
S0198	be it three network do you find it online on the internet or do you go into a shop

S0198	all the new ones
S0231	with that
S0198	no
S0231	i've try it
S0198	maybe it's still slightly different software then
S0231	but that's a smart android phone
S0198	yeah ah how long have you have that actual phone
S0231	since christmas
S0198	christmas ah that's
S0231	well mum buy that for me it be a christmas present cos my other one pack up
S0198	but it didn't it didn't come with the sim card you get that sim card through
S0231	no yeah i get a contract separate
S0198	alright then i'm try to make decide what the best cos i don't i don't particularly like this phone either that dad's give me it's really er
S0231	what be it let's have a look
S0198	it's men i'm i didn't know but my friends've tell me it's rip off a blackberry
S0231	oh
S0198	and now we don't know what blackberry's use to be like
S0231	oh be this what have
S0198	no dad have it for age i think he get it from a boot i don't think he get it from anyone else
S0231	he give it to the didn't he for a little while
S0198	oh do he but whenever
S0231	where's that other thing you have
S0198	i've just have flip phone which i've still get upstairs
S0231	oh
S0198	and it's really simple and i tempt to go back to it because this thing be really easy to unlock like somehow i keep send blank text message to people which be probably er literally and it will send it won't just send one it send four message in a row within a minute because it like lean on the one set button and it'll just keep do it and also the button be kind of really close together
S0231	too small ain't they
S0198	yeah really close together so like normally you have that amount of button don't you and then they're like twice the size
S0231	well it's
S0198	but a part of me really like they i like the size and the feel of that
S0231	i mean if you go if you go to a three shop right
S0198	mm
S0231	you could probably get a contract that's probably about thirty quid now
S0198	mm
S0231	and er er if you slide it down you get the rotation and if you're do a text message that off and turn it sideways
S0198	yeah
S0231	and then you get it make the key bigger for you
S0198	bigger see i've get have you see my mp3 player it's like that this be basically a phone without be a phone samsung
S0231	oh i think that be a phone
S0198	no it's not a phone all it be be an mp3 player that can pick up wi fi so it's an it's call an iplayer it's a samsung
S0231	oh right like an ipod
S0198	yeah oh yeah the ipods can do it as well can't they
S0231	yeah i think so
S0198	like er watch all his videos on there
S0231	yeah he watch youtube everything
S0198	so provide like i can't receive data i can't get internet anywhere but if there's a wi fi i can use the wi fi for free
S0231	oh right
S0198	and then it act like a like a phone
S0231	i think that be a phone
S0198	no it's really confuse cos in korea people don't believe me when i say i don't have a phone they think i'm lie to them cos i've get this out or whatever and they don't believe me i'm like no no it's not a phone it's but it have the same thing on it it have a keyboard on it that you can work with that your turn sideways er it's the same as yours and you know that's much easier to type on
S0231	yeah
S0198	than that
S0231	well if i'm honest with you go on the internet more than what i do
S0198	yeah do oh yeah but you get you don't have wi fi in your apartment though flat
S0231	i don't need to cos i've get
S0198	no cos you've get that yeah
S0231	i've get free internet there's no need for me to have
S0198	it's really change hasn't it the way phone it's like do you remember like in like a really short amount of time as well
S0231	in the space of about five years
S0198	yeah i've go from my vodafone flip phone to be a bite out of date
S0231	yeah you have wi fi
S0198	to everything
S0231	and that basically if you've get free internet what be the point in wi fi
S0198	no yeah oh yeah to have wi fi i guess it's still for erm
S0231	unless
S0198	it's still for
S0231	them big tablets and all that but
S0198	yeah or for like computers laptops still
S0231	oh i know but i've get tv guide thing app i download the other day
S0198	mm and still useful for if you want a proper computer still
S0231	yeah i mean
S0198	then it's useful to have the wi fi
S0231	i do all my job search on here everything
S0198	yeah i know it's really handy
S0231	but i don't tell the job centre that
S0198	no
S0231	i say i have to go to the library
S0198	yeah well
S0231	they haven't pay me for about nearly a month
S0198	it's good that you're so good with it cos sometimes i i lose my patience use a device but you seem to get on quite well with that
S0231	mm yeah it's strange innit
S0198	but it depend how well it function as well because this be really an mp3 player i don't think its its like internet function very good whereas i think all these smartphones be a bite smoother
S0231	my mat sometimes it take longer sometimes it don't
S0198	it take longer yeah same with this i guess
S0231	i mean normally that tv guide would be there now but i think
S0198	handy though cos
S0231	cos we've get dodgy signal
S0198	yeah
S0231	i don't go out and buy the paper and that
S0198	no and also it mean like you say it's cos the other day when i be er before i go over 's dad dad say something like i call you and i say well i'll try facebooking him in case he check his facebook often and that's a free way to contact someone now isn't it
S0231	and
S0198	and call them
S0231	yeah
S0198	you can do face facetime or whatever
S0231	if you if you be on there on facebook could i ring you
S0198	yeah i think i don't know if i maybe i haven't get this isn't
S0231	have you get the messenger app it's that
S0198	no i haven't get no
S0231	that little
S0198	that little thing
S0231	with the yeah
S0198	no no no i don't have that see i still access to the er facebook on this through go into the internet not the facebook application because the facebook application on this device doesn't really work very well do you know what i mean have
S0231	oh right
S0198	i didn't know the facebook picture thing
S0231	yeah
S0198	you just click on it and automatically it's
S0231	well that's the facebook app
S0198	yeah yeah
S0231	so
S0198	whereas i go through i go into google and i log in manually every time
S0231	yeah yeah i don't like that one i've get i've get one with this one better
S0198	cos i can't no this one this device isn't quite it's like half an mp3 it's kind of an afterthought the internet on this it's also one of samsung's earlier model and i think they be just like try out rip off stuff to be honest except it doesn't work quite so well but it be yeah me and be just say today like he work with cos obviously in his job he get some like saturdays staff and things like that just some younger people work there and he say he remember when dvds come out he say this at work the other day and they be like
S0231	i remember when video tap come out
S0198	he be say the people he work with there be like well we we never know anything but dvds cos they be bear in like the nineteen nineteen ninety five or whatever have you see er it's a youtube video and they give some little children i don't know if it's legit or not but they give these small children a walkman and they ask them what it be
S0231	oh yeah yeah i've see it yeah
S0198	a cassette walkman and they don't know what they're look at it and only one of them figure out that it's a walkman cos she know
S0231	for the old tap
S0198	they think it's like a remote control or something they don't know what it be cos they've never bloody see a tape before they be say it be only
S0231	well who's get tap now
S0198	it be only when i be a teenager that we even have internet in our house like and that be dial up and that wasn't until i be thirteen

S0198	mm
S0231	and he will just sit there watch minecraft videos
