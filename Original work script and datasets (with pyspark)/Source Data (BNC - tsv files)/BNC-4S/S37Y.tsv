S0144	fourteen
S0012	yeah
S0013	they be thirteen ninety nine
S0144	and how much be the print
S0013	erm the print i'll tell you

S0024	that should be in the cost
S0012	oh i see i think you mean we that's how we're cost it
S0024	could you get me a knife
S0144	you've gotta put the hours of labour into it as well

S0024	so ten pound for the print okay
S0144	and fourteen so that's twenty five
S0024	that's twenty five pound and then the paper let's say thirty pound just to produce it
S0144	yeah
S0013	mm
S0024	thirty something pound to produce wow that's quite a lot and then the gallery will take thirty three percent
S0013	mm i reckon seventy for that
S0024	thank you
S0013	seventy for the smaller ones
S0024	seventy for the smaller
S0013	i don't think it's much much different really be it now
S0012	no that's the matter of time innit and
S0013	yeah

S0013	well the frame be slightly cheaper that's all really
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0144	why be you take that out

S0024	we we be say though we could
S0013	i've get this awful feel we'll come back think oh
S0024	we could turn up and they say oh well we haven't get time today to look at them we'll have a look at them another time mightn't they mum's gonna take her tiger and her bridge
S0144	yeah the tiger's brilliant
S0024	yeah
S0013	i don't like it now i've look at it again
S0144	that's amaze that be
S0013	oh
S0024	all the more reason to sell it then
S0013	yes it be i don't i'm happy to sell it now it's funny isn't it i really be i i
S0024	whereas polperro you want to keep forever don't you until well it's the same as like that camel picture

S0144	okay so what be we call them what be we call that one darjeeling
S0024	can you write it all down for me
S0144	call that one the space between
S0013	but i think that i think they will say they want they would sell it more than seventy maybe more than eighty probably be the gallery
S0144	yeah well if they want thirty percent
S0013	cos they if they want their thirty percent they would the higher the price the more the money they get don't they
S0144	yeah
S0024	you be right this be much easier with a knife mum
S0013	yeah
S0024	yeah yeah say
S0013	it's true isn't it
S0024	yeah yeah i think if they like the picture and they you know they've get more of idea of what will sell
S0013	well i think that the paperwork would do for twenty pound
S0144	yeah well i'd leave the cost to them yeah
S0024	well they ask us for for approximate cost for them
S0144	oh do they
S0024	yeah
S0144	hmm well
S0024	erm
S0144	well as long as you know how much it cost to produce them then
S0024	well that's what i need to write down can you get me some paper cos i'll forget i'll forget it all won't i
S0144	yeah
S0024	i i can't remember just tell me what er how much to sell it for
S0144	cos there's no point there's no point drive all that way for like a fiver profit
S0024	no that'll be the petrol anyway
S0144	yeah exactly
S0012	you what
S0024	that's the thing you don't realise do you how much
S0144	it's quite difficult sell art isn't it

S0144	well it's textiles yeah
S0024	look at that cos it's come right off the page look
S0144	yeah but how many hours
S0024	i know that's why we we're sell that for five five ninety
S0144	do you know what i mean you that's what people don't think about when they're buy art like that
S0024	no they don't they just look
S0144	like even if you think minimum wage that would have take her
S0024	yeah
S0144	you know a hundred hours probably
S0024	i've lose my vinegar oh i know
S0144	a hundred hours at minimum wage be like six hundred quid
S0024	because because it's like a hobby she forget how long she's spend on it so she can
