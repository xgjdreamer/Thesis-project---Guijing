S0223	er part of er compute which i've be in for many many years and if could get involve in it you know at this time i think he could have quite a good career so
S0202	yeah cos that's one of the like that's the sort of trade that you need to learn isn't it really so
S0223	yeah at the moment in the in the city the biggest things be about anti money launder
S0224	mm
S0223	erm know your client where's the money come from
S0202	yeah i know i know that yeah
S0223	prevent the finance of terrorism it's huge and the french bank get fin by the americans billions of dollars recently for breach erm sanction rule and you know the regulators be watch what the bank be up to the bank aren't actually that bother about where the money's come from as long as they're make profit so more and more the pressure's be put on them to question where the money's come from
S0202	yeah
S0223	and there's huge career in that whole area of compliance and
S0202	yeah
S0223	regulatory
S0225	be you still eat prawn cat
S0223	you know i mean it's it can be probably a bore but also quite an excite place to be at the moment
S0202	yeah
S0223	and i i recognise this two or three years ago and i actually joke about you could get your son a compliance manual and he's get a career for life
S0202	yeah
S0223	you know there's a lot a lot in that it's the biggest grow department in every financial company be their compliance team
S0202	yeah
S0223	so and they're all try to keep up with erm those people that be try to break the rule
S0224	yeah
S0202	the
S0224	cos the fin be enormous
S0223	oh the fin be
S0224	completely
S0223	astronomical
S0224	outweigh the cost yeah
S0202	yeah but that's the point it's just try to
S0223	there's
S0202	deter it happen again
S0224	mm
S0223	there's like a trillion they've work out there's trillions of dollars of fraud fraudulent money go through the bank system every year
S0224	mm
S0223	it's absolutely huge
S0202	where do this so these fin where do that money go i've always wonder that like if a bank be fin where do that money go like do it go into the government pocket
S0223	it go to the regulator and the regulator use it to fund their more investigators for more bank or to change the rule or to tighten up the rule or to prosecute so it's a fine
S0224	mm
S0223	that kind of go back to the central govern body
S0202	mm
S0223	so that they can then make themselves better and they be and they're buy software like my company's get so they're gonna be more advance than the actual financial company themselves to be able to go and do those sort of analysis project and things like that so you know it's it's a bite of a race against time at the moment but what we've find be with anti money launder be that erm those that be involve they'll set up a shell company
S0202	mm
S0223	erm geneva or the cayman islands or portugal anywhere but they won't do anything they won't trade in it for years three years four years maybe and then they start put transactions through and they're launder money through it and there's lot of step in the transaction
S0202	clean the money
S0223	and what we're try to do be we're try to identify pattern in those step so if a trade start in switzerland go to a swiss bank and end in switzerland it's probably safe but if the trade start in switzerland go to the cayman islands and then go back to i dunno colombia then that should start ring bell
S0202	mm
S0223	but not everybody look at the whole the whole chain each bank look at them and the next party who could be
S0202	yeah
S0223	another friendly bank that next bank have a friendly bank in another country they know each other they maybe get together once a year they're er they on first name term that bank's on first name term with another country and in as as individuals everything look okay you know
S0202	but if you look at it as a whole
S0223	but if you look at the whole transaction you think mm that's why why be they do the transaction like that so bank in all countries france spain portugal have relationships with another institution in another country and on the surface it look fine and it probably be but you if you put all the piece of the jigsaw together you start identify what could be attempt to to move money around illegally
S0202	so how do how do you get into that then like that's a really specific field to be in like
S0223	because i've be in financial service for all my career and i be look for a new job and erm one of my contact say look i work for a company why don't you come and meet our head of sales
S0223	ah it's oh erm just by the drink cabinet inside erm i get in i've get have you ever hear of linkedin
S0202	yeah
S0223	well i'm on linkedin and er i've i've always use it and i've be a member of linkedin for quite a few years
S0202	it's how you network ain't it and make
S0223	yeah it's really good for in in my industry and and probably in others but i we use it a lot and a guy that i've meet in the past say my company's look as though we want another sales person and when i join them i didn't really know what they be sell erm and it turn out that the most interest project that we've get or product be this forensic analysis tool and it be develop in south africa for er fraud prevention
S0202	yeah
S0223	and now we've get ex copper that work for us and we've get these data architect type and you know techie really techie people but also that understand erm investigations so i've
S0202	a real mix of people
S0223	i find it very excite actually cos it's kind of it's not just financial service it can go and be use to analyse industrial espionage it can be use to analyse construction project where people might be erm claim to work on two project the same time and put timesheets in it pick up things like that it pick up where bid be be win erm constantly over maybe other firm it might connect up the fact that somebody over here be marry to somebody down there things that you don't see on a day to day basis
S0202	yeah
S0223	if you ingest all the data and start kinda shuffle everything around and throw it back it it start make connections which be really excite
S0202	yeah
S0223	so
S0202	cos there's a lot of that i bet that go on in the in er different industries like bribe and so and so's
S0223	yeah yeah
S0202	marry to so and so so we're gonna get this contract and
S0223	i mean one of the things be erm a company where the guy's a manager and he's sign off stationery i mean company buy stationery all the time
S0202	mm
S0223	so he's always buy paper and pen and things like that but as it turn out he be get his firm to pay for fictitious invoice and he be the owner of the stationery company so you wouldn't know that unless you say give me detail of all the company directors on company house and compare them to my staff
S0202	mm
S0223	have a look at the email of my staff so it's quite interest
S0202	right yeah it be really interest
S0223	we find a lot of unknowns and every time there's fraud or some insider deal or some transactions that have erm that look a bite dodgy typically when it come to they've find somebody that's do something wrong the evidence be already there it's always be there it's just kinda hide in email sort of text message
S0202	different place where not necessarily
S0223	not
S0202	look at all at once
S0223	absolutely
S0202	yeah
S0223	you know and what we're try to do be connect all the dot and i think it's a great so
S0202	yeah it sound really interest
S0223	the big one of the big project i'm work on be for the
S0202	mm
S0223	they're look for a new investigative system
S0202	right
S0223	to help them with fraud across all aspects of fraud you know because the be that it's get most of the financial
S0202	sector in there
S0223	fraud they want to get it right and then they want to start shift it out to other part of the country so we're bid we we haven't win a bid but we're in a process of bid erm and i just think that's fantastic cos my mum use to work for police she be a civilian in the office
S0202	right
S0223	put all the case together for court bring everything
S0202	yeah
S0223	so i kind of feel a little bite of a connection there
S0223	mm
S0223	well have some more drink
S0223	don't rub your eye
S0224	don't pick your nose
S0223	so yeah it's good you know there's a lot i mean be sort of toe and froing about what do he want to do now that he's not do that well with his ass and he's go maybe i should get an apprenticeship maybe i should do sixth form i'm think no in it's rural it's low wage forget it so eventually with a bite of persuasion he's decide
S0202	on his own yeah
S0223	yeah yeah
S0223	and he's gonna come and live in with me
S0202	yeah
S0202	see that'll be good cos you can keep an eye on him as well
S0223	yeah i mean i'm not gonna
S0202	like
S0223	sort of pussyfoot around him but
S0202	no but like you know what he's you know what i mean
S0223	i think the if he
S0223	but if he live with me for six months then decide he want to go and move in with some some mat from work that he's meet perfect you know job do
S0202	mm mm
S0223	he's launch he's get a job he's on the career ladder and he's live in what better position could we be in
S0202	mm
S0223	you know so
S0202	well i'm work on something at the moment which be similar in a way to what you do but not it be investigative but it's not fraud so i work for erm something call the british national corpus and basically what they do be part of my degree be study languages and different dialects in england
S0223	yeah
S0202	so like you can tell i'm from the north and i can tell you're from the south it's just a way of speak and the way
S0223	mm
S0202	that you use your tongue and pronounce things differently to how i do
S0223	mm
S0202	so like i'll erm drop ts i'll drop word out of a sentence and stuff like that whereas people who be generally from the south don't normally do that they normally speak a proper sentence so to speak
S0202	erm and erm i i erm work for the british national corpus collect data erm and record stuff with people talk so me and 'll have conversations and we'll record them and send them off to erm the person who's head of this project
S0223	yeah
S0202	and what they do be they put this erm record through a piece of software that pick out word and pick out erm how dialects be different in different part of the country and how things be pronounce
S0223	mm
S0202	so this british national corpus be normally use for erm like language study speech therapists erm all that like how language be use and what it's use for in what way
S0223	yeah
S0202	stuff like that so that's sort of a similar thing and it's
S0223	yeah
S0202	just collect a lot of data and then find out
S0223	it's what you do with the data after you've collect it really be the key thing and you know people have now be catch on to the fact that there's so much information out there if you can harness it you know you can do so much and learn so much that you couldn't see before you know cos most people work in isolation company even if you work for a big bank and i've work for a big bank my last firm be which be a big american bank they've get like twenty eight thousand staff around the world in silos the bank industry's renowned for it you do your job in your department and you don't really know what's go on over there and over the years multiple computer systems have grow up because maybe they've acquire a company or they've develop something quickly and they end up with lot of databases of information no one ever get the big picture and if they do it take them months of management time
S0202	yeah and a lot of organisation
S0223	a lot of staff pull data out and stick it into spreadsheets and things like that so nobody really have a view what's go on across the company and they might have clients in here and clients over there and they're not use
S0202	yeah
S0223	that information
S0202	not use it
S0223	so there's so much more we can do and i think every sort of five or six years something new come up in technology which
S0202	that allow it
S0223	kind of blow everybody away and you know big data be the big thing at the moment it's a the buzzword
S0202	it be er
S0223	it's quite interest actually now that i've update my er linkedin profile where i talk about big data and smart data i get a lot more people enquire on my my my linkedin profile that
S0223	be not relate to what i'm do in my day to day job so i think that
S0202	mm
S0223	if you're out there in the industry and you're look for people that have get experience in this latest technology you start search around to see who have so i think it's it's quite good it's quite profile build actually at the minute
S0223	what we're do keep
S0202	see the
S0223	update it
S0202	yeah that's what i like about my degree because a lot of people think that er an english degree be like a mickey mouse degree they don't really understand erm what's involve in it so they just assume oh it's english you're an english speak person it's easy because they know nothing about it but a lot of what i do be erm or what i will be do in my second year be collect data and research it
S0223	mm
S0202	analyse it and then break it down into an essay or into a research project stuff like that and i think
S0223	well a lot come out of the universities a lot of what industry pick up come out from research that the universities do and i think they do a a good job
S0202	mm
S0223	and sometimes some of the competitive products that be out there in the market have come from universities you know
S0202	yeah
S0223	i mean what be it mumps program language which be use probably eighty er in the eighties and the nineties and there be still some systems base on mumps be massachusetts university something program
S0202	mm
S0223	you know it be actually a university develop programme
S0202	yeah
S0223	which be still use across the world you know as one of the underlie program languages with things have move on but a lot of it come out of the technology and the study that people do so
S0202	yeah
S0223	it can really go place
S0202	i think the universities be fantastic
S0223	yeah
S0202	like the the office they offer like erm especially like if you decide to go into a career in academia like that be basically your job you teach and you research like a lot of my tutor go off on erm sabbatical research sabbaticals they basically spend a year be pay to research and do things like that
S0223	mm
S0202	and it's it's really interest stuff erm
S0223	be we gonna eat inside tonight do you think
S0223	hello
S0223	be that you it's get it's get dark quite early now isn't it bite of a shame really
S0202	just go and get a jumper hello
S0223	oh goodness we put the cover on the pool when we come up earlier
S0223	to keep the heat in there so that's all sort
S0223	nothing to do down there
S0202	oh it smell fantastic
S0223	oh excuse me how's get back from her babysitting
S0223	i think i'll go and lay the table in the other room actually i'm get a bite cold
S0223	if we're gonna eat in there yeah okey dokes take my various liquids
S0223	shall i erm lay out for as well be she back in time to eat
S0223	but be here isn't he and erm
S0223	i'm gonna i'm gonna lay out the table in here cos we're gonna eat in here
S0223	yeah
S0202	saw load of i'd never hear of erm i've hear er you and speak about before but i'd never hear of it like in england or anything i saw load in america they're absolutely everywhere aren't they
S0202	like i think she er when she be talk about it she just mean like a bank in the city
S0202	if that make sense like i didn't realise that that be it its actual name but it's huge like they're everywhere in america they're absolutely everywhere
S0224	i've get the boar marinade for tomorrow
S0225	oh excellent
S0202	oh be we have boar
S0224	so i need to get up early and and do that
S0202	i'm not here we're not here tomorrow night
S0225	oh no you're not here no
S0202	can you save us some please
S0224	might be a little bite save
S0202	thank you
S0224	little snack size piece
S0202	i love your boar stew it's amaze
S0225	do you shoot it
S0224	erm i don't know
S0225	mm
S0224	be the answer
S0225	okay
S0224	i shoot one whether this be part of that one i don't know
S0225	so it's a bite like a world war two fighter pilot everyone's claim to have the kill
S0224	no no no no
S0225	no
S0224	what it be be that what what we do when we go up there it's very democratic actually it's very good be we decide base on who's find trace of boar in woods where we all we each go out and check our own little area
S0225	mm
S0224	and that help us decide where we should go shoot one in the morning and one in the afternoon usually erm and then depend on how many people there be we mark out post around the area we're gonna be hunt so basically what happen be beaters go in with dog flush the animals out and they come scream out of somewhere and you shoot them as they go past sort of thing
S0225	mm
S0224	but what it mean be that there's no favouritism as to who get which slot and you know this be my post i'm here all the time sort of thing so you actually get to see a lot of the countryside and a lot of different things rather than just stand in one place every time you go out
S0225	mm
S0224	to a particular place and then if anything get shoot it get butcher when we come back at lunchtime and then just leave and when we come back in the even anything else get butcher and then it all get share out again er depend on how many people be there it get put into so many bag so if there's twenty people
S0223	what do you do with the fork
S0224	with the what i didn't do anything with them they're in the sink to be wash
S0223	you know you put the fork somewhere earlier
S0224	i put them in the sink to be wash
S0223	in the sink
S0224	yeah
S0223	okay
S0224	but they i think they've be do you wash them
S0223	he say they're in the sink
S0202	the sink oh they're in the erm dishwasher
S0224	oh right they go into the dishwasher i leave them out cos we need them for tea
S0202	oh right sorry
S0202	it's not on
S0224	erm so if there's twenty people then what get kill get put into twenty bag
S0225	divide yeah okay
S0224	and again lot be do so that whoever's butcher it doesn't get to say you know i'll keep the fillet steak this side sort of thing
S0225	mm
S0224	so you end up with a bag that could be one that you kill it could be one that someone else kill you know and depend on how many have be kill that day you might not get anything some days
S0225	mm
S0224	erm so genuinely you don't know i mean people know who kill it when it get shoot cos obviously the person who's point their gun at it when it fall over it's fairly obviously who shoot it some case it isn't when it's run across a field and everybody's shoot it and you don't know who actually shoot it
S0225	oh dear it doesn't stand a chance there
S0224	well no they they do get away especially the bigger older ones i mean they they don't run down the paths if they know they're be hunt they don't follow the track cos they're
S0223	we can't find the fork i definitely saw you put them aside earlier
S0224	yeah say she put them in the dishwasher i don't need to go in look in the dishwasher and
S0224	and find them yeah she's find them
S0225	mm
S0224	and then when you get the meat you keep it in the freezer for three months because there be a parasite that boar can have that be not good for you
S0225	oh right so it's it it take three months to be absolutely sure this thing be er
S0224	yes be dead
S0225	yeah okay
S0224	so the stuff we're eat be basically something that be shoot during last season and have be in the freezer since you know october november december whatever
S0225	mm
S0224	the time we run the things so what i do when i bring my meat home be i leave it in the fridge for a day and then i carve it off into lump to make stew basically
S0225	mm
S0224	and one i'll start do now be i will start carve more interest piece cos you don't just have to do stew cos although it's very good for slow cook it can be a tough meat if you get a younger one a smaller one you know fifty kilos something like that it's it can be quite nice meat you could actually barbecue it or
S0225	mm
S0224	do other things with it as well
S0225	yeah
S0224	the trouble be that the stew be just so nice it's just like you almost don't wanna do anything else so if you marinade the meat overnight and then cover it in flour and and just fry it off and then put it in the slow roasty thing for the rest of the day it's amaze there isn't a cloud in the sky now
S0202	i know
S0225	yeah i mean you know who would have think
S0224	yeah
S0223	be it
S0223	shall we finish it off
S0223	i won't have any
S0223	might
S0223	well i'll put some on the table just want any
S0202	yeah i've get some now thank you
S0202	yeah it's nice yeah
S0202	yeah
S0202	mm
S0223	ah excuse me i be just look for that
S0202	oh sorry
S0223	no no i i be look for it upstairs
S0202	i'm hide it
S0223	food's almost ready i just try home again
