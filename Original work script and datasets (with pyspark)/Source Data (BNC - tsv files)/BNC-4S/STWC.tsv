S0331	yeah
S0326	like feel good
S0331	yeah
S0330	oh
S0326	like they have like mind game
S0330	shit cool
S0330	shall we open a casino
S0331	yeah well let's just let's just buy up some naked land and then

S0331	yeah well
S0330	i once go to the casino in melbourne think it would be funny and it be so depress
S0331	i get kick out of that yeah
S0330	do you what for
S0331	i only once go well i've only be only once
S0331	when i be like eighteen
S0326	once get kick out of a casino never again
S0331	get kick out of a casino
S0330	what for
S0331	i dunno well
S0328	probably
S0331	probably
S0328	like
S0331	yeah
S0328	he's a spacer
S0330	you probably do
S0331	i probably do someone
S0330	it be so depress i walk in one end and go out the other convince a whole load of people that go there like
S0331	yeah it be just not
S0330	after a party
S0331	an excite place at all it's it's really er
S0330	it's like there's there's erm there's like a food court go on there sort of thing
S0328	oh no
S0331	it's quite bad
S0330	and it's just feel like it's like depress
S0331	yeah
S0330	there's no like you know like
S0328	why do you get throw out you can't even remember
S0330	oh but bet it be so bad you can't tell them
S0331	erm
S0331	well maybe like well i be under age or something stupid probably like like a probably act stupid you know
S0328	what's wrong with that
S0326	the skin
S0328	don't like the skin
S0331	everyone go to the casino
S0328	that's where all the brain fuel be
S0331	everyone go to the one in sydney now because when i just go back in october all the license laws have change so pubs can open after one be
S0328	be that for a casino
S0331	and sydney's usually full twenty four hour bar so they've recently just
S0330	why have that change
S0331	because load of people be die or be put into comas from like king hit which be like
S0330	what
S0331	someone would pull up in a car run up and punch someone in in the back of the head or just like unexpectedly
S0331	say you and me be walk along
S0326	a happy slap
S0328	a happy slap but punch
S0331	what's a happy slap
S0326	happy slap that's when you go to like
S0331	right like a random person
S0326	and slap someone and you film it and then put it on the internet
S0331	yeah kind of like that except like a punch and like every weekend someone be either in a coma or dead from a from the from this
S0328	wow
S0331	so like they instead of like target that they just stop and like i've get friends that have work in like pubs in like central sydney for years like managers and stuff and it's just fuck all the completely fuck them cos they be like make money between one be and eight be or whatever
S0330	but like erm
S0331	so they they cut the
S0330	do that have that solve the problem
S0331	er when i be there it be really fresh so it be like it have only happen like a month before or something so i think they probably use statistics in their favour it be just in the so it be like within a five mile radius or something er but anyway the casino be not a part of it so it didn't apply to them somehow so we go to the casino at after this wed
S0330	doesn't make any sense
S0331	and it be
S0330	it mean they get a big bribe from the casino
S0331	so crap it be like yeah yeah
S0326	do you know do you what happen all those probably er
S0331	pay by the casino
S0326	the casino have get like friends in politics who they've get
S0331	yeah absolutely like it
S0330	yeah probably
S0326	be that how it all work
S0331	but you know the it be really fuck awful and that i i didn't really
S0328	and a punch
S0331	have a good time in like in october when i go over and maybe cos of that and like things associate with that and like it be just really aggressive and like i forget that what's it it be like in that way like with load of fight and load of like senseless you know yeah it be really depress
S0330	i can't see anything depress about it cos it's so long ago i think i might have change
S0328	i didn't find it like that at all but that cos yeah cos you cos when we go like it be completely fine and then then we meet and then we figure out maybe it be cos you be with a girl like a mix group mix gender group
S0331	when you be there
S0328	yeah
S0331	yeah
S0328	and so you're less likely to get pick on for fight and stuff
S0331	yeah we have we get like you know
S0328	cos we didn't like we didn't get any hassle at all from anyone
S0331	it's cos i'd be to a wed and like and even without it be like me and five other dudes and like when you're in those group like people like wanna fight
S0328	and people want to fight you
S0331	yeah yeah like not
S0328	i didn't have the
S0331	not
S0326	yeah
S0331	didn't want to

S0330	that's horrible
S0328	no that's not very happy be it
S0331	no
S0328	do you ever use to get like bad feedback at on twitter or anything
S0331	yeah a little bite
S0330	yeah a little bite we've discuss since then most of the in depth
S0328	i know those those ones at the end though but like in the class like how do you handle it but everyone be really good but we i get three complaints this weekend i've never really have a complaint before
S0326	on the sunday thing
S0328	one today one for an er no two for an two two for order one be right i do need to give her like a revision section on this one cake unfortunately they're get that wrong but like i don't know what to say
S0328	erm
S0330	embarrass i don't it's never really happen before
S0328	we
S0326	oh
S0328	never really have any any complaints er we we have a couple of complaints er specifically about staff members
S0330	mm
S0328	erm yeah
S0328	not actually about that be before
S0328	that be before that erm and and we just just i like i follow follow 's example cos he have load of complaints all the time cos it's like a big restaurant with load of customers it's standard like rich people fuck try to like you know make a statement and bullshit like that erm just mean really really professional and like erm even if you and and also like express gratitude that they've you know contact you about it or whatever er and then erm yeah just say like firstly he would he would sort of give the reason as to like like it it it depend if you disagree but like so if she
S0330	yeah
S0328	so with something like food poison for example he would always like
S0330	oh god i
S0328	no but it's like a common thing
S0328	but it's like a a sort of simple example he would like state the reason why like the things you have in place already as like systems you know we already have a a set of systems that we follow you know and staff train blah blah blah and then say er how you're gonna like take what they say and and and look into it further erm basically
S0330	i just saw it like straight away it be like cos one be on twitter the other two be email
S0331	what have you get what what do they say
S0330	just get three complaints this weekend about stuff everything look beautiful on but on
S0331	but what be the complaints about
S0330	but i don't know if this be just a thing of like volume like if you get over a certain amount of thing then like suddenly you get people's opinions one be that a cake be like not super light it be a vanilla cake and she have be do that and like i do need to practise it with her erm they say it look great but it wasn't like very light and they want a light cake or whatever
S0331	they want they want a light oh bloody hell
S0331	yeah cool
S0330	another one be like
S0331	yeah fair enough yeah
S0330	another one be like
S0326	yeah what do they what what be the complaint
S0330	that the sponge wasn't very light
S0331	it wasn't light
S0330	which be true that's a lovely recipe and she's just be make it wrong and fine it's a bite fussy but
S0331	the lady want a light cake
S0330	they they probably be right
S0331	it's a sunday she want a light cake yeah
S0331	but that one be
S0331	okay
S0330	to order so she probably spend a hundred quid on it you know
S0331	oh it be a whole cake i think it be like a mini one the kind of
S0330	yeah no no no it be like
S0330	it be to order she be very nice she be she write a a really nice email
S0331	yeah
S0330	and i'd be chat to her for a while so that be fine another one be a cake to look like a brain and she hadn't do it before and she didn't do it very well again fair enough the other one be a guy on twitter who seem like a bite of a dick who say that his walnut cake be stale i say it definitely wasn't stale but like i'm sorry you have a bad experience and erm we make everything fresh and like he be like well it be really dry like any suggestions and i just nored it and say if you want if you wanna come in and try something like it's on me
S0331	yeah if you wanna come in
S0330	but then i think
S0331	then fuck you yeah
S0330	maybe that's a bad idea because
S0328	yeah
S0330	everyone will start fuck complain on twitter
S0328	yeah
S0330	to get a free cake
S0328	but on twitter on twitter what do be he always say i'm i'm sorry to hear about that please email me the here's my email address and and i'll like deal with it and discuss it further cos the last thing
S0330	mm
S0328	like twitter's so powerful cos so many people potentially read it that like what you wanna do be just take it off as soon as possible and like and let and then you know deal with them separately cos basically it's it's like a it's
S0331	yeah it's a really good thing
S0328	it's it's such a shit thing to
S0331	that's a really good thing to say just come in just er just email me
S0328	yeah just
S0331	sorry about that
S0328	so so
S0330	i i just say it
S0331	yeah
S0330	and then i didn't and then i just
S0330	like
S0326	get back to them again
S0328	email me you know and i'll try and you you know we can discuss it and we'll try and sort it out or whatever erm because that's what they should have do in the first place if they have an actual real complaint that they want to express to you they should have send you it in an email it's like it's a bite whack to do it on twitter
S0331	yeah
S0330	mm
S0331	yeah it's not fair to do it on twitter really
S0330	but it's definitely make me feel bad
S0330	mm
S0331	what's the score on yak
S0326	i've get ten
S0331	who's on ten
S0326	i'm er i be
S0331	you be what be i on
S0326	oh wait you i'm not on ten i'm on
S0331	what
S0326	you're on
S0328	mm
S0331	i'm on six apparently you're on four
S0331	four
S0326	but it say i have ten like on my thing
S0331	yeah but it's probably
S0328	maybe they take it away
S0331	bring it down again
S0326	oh yeah there be the funniest that i saw today be fuck and send your revision note
S0331	yeah i i like that that'll get a like
S0328	but yeah so so i guess the main thing be that he would like then say okay i'm you know this this be what i'm gonna do to make sure it doesn't happen again thank like be like thank you for your feedback i really appreciate it cos we're always strive to like be better
S0328	and you know like
S0331	that's very
S0328	like because because but because people cos people have er you know if you accept if you recognise that you're not one hundred percent perfect then people remember oh of course like
S0330	mm
S0328	like people make mistake if you think that the mistake be valid
S0330	mm
S0328	as well erm you know oh we'll look into it and try and work out ways to do it blah blah blah
S0330	yeah
S0328	erm and then i guess you just have to decide whether you're gonna like like whether you're actually gonna do anything or just
S0330	or not
S0328	no whether you're gonna do it but but also something that he do be he have a like an email formula that so
S0331	ha
S0328	so so that
S0330	how many complaints do he get
S0331	that that yeah isn't it
S0328	quite it's quite a lot
S0330	be it auto reply
S0326	yeah a macro
S0328	quite a lot
S0328	yeah i mean it's a big restaurant like you could like like all all big restaurants get complaints all the time like it's completely normal
S0330	mm
S0328	it's part of the job it's part of the thing and so you have like a you know an email formula and then you just so so that you spend as little er emotional energy on it as possible
S0330	mm
S0328	i think for long term he would sort of for age he like find it really exhaust and would like write a really like a like angry email and but then like delete it then
S0328	rewrite it again
S0331	oh god
S0328	and be like oh actually like really really like polite and nice
S0328	erm
S0330	my instinct be always to give somebody something else that you know be nice and then it's like
S0328	yeah but if if but if you're happy to do that
S0330	because it cos also it's just cos
S0328	then just do it
S0330	i feel bad and i want them to have a good cake
S0328	yeah of course
S0331	they continue to think they're right though
S0328	no but that's but that's what
S0331	ah but if you're sure they're right yeah yeah
S0328	but but if you're but if you feel like if you sort of yeah if you kind of rationalise and and you know say you know just just give like a balance thing like or you know this be
S0330	yeah
S0328	like
S0328	you know so the whole thing be balance and not in your favour or their favour it's like you know you know just general kind of erm cos you don't wanna because if they cos there be a way that you can make people feel a bite like they've win but also that you've win too
S0330	yeah
S0328	like there's definitely a way of do that
S0328	erm
S0330	i think also if i sort of say it you know it wasn't me that make that cake
S0331	yeah
S0330	and have a
S0331	that's the best one
S0330	no but then it's like
S0331	that's it full stop
S0330	oh you know our bakery have
S0331	sorry i didn't make it
S0330	high standards and you know
S0330	and we have a new employee and i probably should have spend more time with him on you know and we can offer you something in compensation
S0328	well
S0331	i wouldn't say i wouldn't say
S0328	no
S0331	i should have spend more time with him
S0328	don't yeah don't say what you should do
S0331	no
S0328	say what you're go
S0331	it's none of their business
S0328	like in the future
S0331	it's none of their business how much you're like
S0328	i will like i will look into this and so we've get a new employee thank for let like thank for let me know
S0331	yeah
S0328	in the future i'll make sure like to keep an eye on certain thing erm
S0331	it's er
S0328	of like like we do a lot of order per week you know of course you know i'm i'm really glad that that that you let me know cos i want everything to be awesome every time you know
S0330	i hope it's not a thing of like just after a certain like you be say about scale like after a certain point it's just a matter of course you get a bunch of like negative
S0331	no that just sound like bad luck
S0330	er response
S0331	three time in one day
S0328	yes that that's
S0331	i mean it's and not gonna happen next week
S0328	but but how many positive ones do you get
S0330	a shit tonne
S0328	yeah there you
S0330	yeah it's true it's always nice that people write a positive you know what i mean i feel like that count for more than a negative one in a way
S0328	yeah definitely
S0330	if they feel like compel to say like how nice it be
S0328	no absolutely a hundred percent cos it's like yeah if someone go out of their way to write a positive email like people will complain at the drop of a hat but if they erm
S0330	gonna sack her and close the bakery fuck it
S0331	yeah
S0331	well i would
