S0058	so basically the order doesn't really matter you just need oh
S0026	yeah
S0179	um
S0026	oh we've actually secretly get four
S0026	that double one be masquerade as a single one
S0179	er three lemons

S0179	mm oo it's not easy it's near it's close to complex
S0026	so

S0058	close to complex
S0026	could i feasibly record conversations and sell them to
S0058	yeah yeah
S0026	to your department

S0026	really
S0058	you you do you want me to send the info to you

S0026	cos i've get quite a good mp3 player with a microphone build in
S0058	ah yeah yeah
S0026	so
S0058	i'll send you the info that's fine oh professional we should just get a garlic press
S0179	yes well er who need one
S0026	no i garlic press be pretty inefficient though you end up with load of garlic stick around the place and
S0058	true they be nasty to clean
S0026	i i just like chop it
S0058	fair enough
S0179	you can cut finer than that man honestly
S0026	sorry yeah you can get it finer than that
S0179	you call that chop um right what else be i suppose to do um
S0058	er basically now be just
S0179	i'll just open all the tin

S0026	get your act together
S0179	ah
S0058	be you snaffle
S0179	yes
S0026	it'd be quite an interest job
S0179	we want four tin of anchovies
S0026	do the transcribe i reckon for these
S0058	yeah
S0026	cos you must have some very strange conversations go on
S0058	well i
S0179	well our conversations be fecking weird cos
S0026	and i bet a lot of the conversations be just about the the the the thing itself
S0058	yeah
S0179	a lot of the conversations be very sort of artificial whereas we've just be
S0026	yeah
S0179	literally so we be drive up to 's grandparents four hours in the car
S0026	yeah
S0179	on the entire time
S0026	yeah that's good
S0179	and that's yeah but it's very natural
S0026	it's high quality that's probably what they want
S0179	we we we just forget it's there
S0058	mm
S0026	yeah
S0179	yeah unfortunately we do have a massive argument on one occasion which mostly get record
S0026	so do you get pay per record or per hour or
S0058	per hour of record yeah
S0026	and how how much be it per hour
S0058	eighteen
S0026	eighteen pound that's really good
S0058	yeah
S0179	and tax
S0026	i'd i'd happily
S0058	yeah there be tax
S0026	tax they tax it do they
S0179	unfortunately yes well
S0026	and how who tax it how be it tax
S0058	well as in um it mine be take out through my payslips so
S0026	oh right but how would i get tax on it
S0179	um well actually you wouldn't you you
S0026	i'd just
S0058	you you declare it on your um
S0026	oh er so i have to do like i have to fill in a an extra tax return for it then
S0179	in theory yeah
S0058	hang on you don't need four tin of anchovies you're not seriously gonna put four tin of anchovies in
S0179	we normally have two for
S0026	for two
S0179	so i be just gonna put four in cos i like my anchovies
S0026	be expect to be feed
S0179	no i don't reckon
S0058	he say he's have a co op sandwich
S0026	a what
S0058	co op sandwich

S0058	there's some oat cake and there's some of those
S0026	oh we've get quite a lot
S0179	there's virtually none of those i'm concern about this now oh there's some alright who feel like a run down to marks's
S0026	not particularly not right now
S0179	oh fuck it
S0179	oh well we've get some that'll probably be enough to be get on with
S0026	so what what er what exactly be you be you make

S0026	cos we've get quick a similar hob in our house it's
S0058	oh that's gonna in
S0026	that's gonna go in thing be there's a they um there's they retain so much heat so
S0058	yeah yeah i know
S0026	take age to respond
S0179	no it doesn't it's pretty good
S0058	to cool it down it's quite hard
S0179	yeah yeah to once you've finish cook to cool it's a pain but er
S0026	that's what i mean cos i just turn it down but it'll be a while before it actually get to that temperature
S0058	yeah
S0179	oh no but it be actually fairly responsive to that
S0058	you reckon
S0179	yeah
S0026	well it'll depend if you've get something sit on it or not
S0026	i guess
S0179	well sort of um use sort of heat transfer the er rate of heat transfer be proportional to the temperature difference so it cool like from high to medium it cool pretty quickly but it take a long time to finally stop
S0058	oh um cool that's quite a lot of oil
S0026	oh it'll be alright
S0058	never mind
S0058	it'll fry
S0026	none of us be fat
S0179	what the fuck's happen to that
S0026	there haven't you
S0058	have you destroy it

S0179	no er it do actually but i won't explain it to you
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	um
S0058	fair enough yeah
S0026	explain it for the sake of the record device
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	it mean i'm have very violent sex
S0058	oh
S0179	with her such to the point
S0058	oh
S0179	where it become
S0058	god
S0179	painful there we go
S0058	thank for that such a joy
S0026	that's the point where i'd abandon all attempt and just leave it
S0058	wow you really have chew a bite in the side of that that's impressive
S0026	sorry
S0058	there's a bite go out of the side
S0179	i know
S0058	of the tin that's impressive
S0179	i think this be go a bite
S0026	do you want me to er let me have a go with this one i'm curious
S0179	okay um
S0058	um okay so basically now it's just
S0179	add things
S0058	cook pasta to to get ready um
S0179	do we have er tuna
S0058	er tuna yeah
S0058	tuna
S0179	er i'm pretty ah god actually that be quite dangerous that go there
S0058	what do
S0179	that sharp bite of
S0058	oh right
S0179	as in that be about five mil
S0026	what that one
S0179	that be about five mil from the vein on my wrist
S0058	nasty
S0026	nice
S0026	it didn't cut it didn't cut the skin though do it so
S0179	no just mark it but yeah but still the point be
S0026	mm
S0179	this well that's good shit
S0026	see that's that's good cheap cheap tuna
S0058	well yes the thing be it's not even the cheap one it's quite a posh one
S0026	right
S0058	but no one actually look at the price per hundred grams
S0026	yeah that's the thing you see
S0058	that's the that's the key thing you see
S0026	i spend so long in the supermarkets look at like
S0058	yeah
S0026	price per unit
S0058	yeah um
S0026	price per gram or whatever
S0058	i'm really sad but you know it
S0026	cos some of the some of the big brand be actually not as bad as you think
S0058	mm
S0026	they just they just
S0058	that's true yeah
S0026	sell more more or less than the most
S0058	mm
S0026	amount
S0058	exactly
S0026	so as long as you can accept that
S0179	so um something quite funny happen at work with that so we get this want these blank um chemically etch
S0058	should i put these in
S0179	with our laser driller and er so they're small components about the size of a business card
S0026	yeah
S0179	and um we get a quote which be about two quid a unit for fifty so i say actually yeah we kind of want a hundred and the unit price increase
S0026	yeah
S0179	and i point this out to them and they say no sorry there's nothing we can do and i just say okay well i'll have two lot of fifty then please
S0179	cos the quote be still valid and they be oblige to honour it
S0026	yeah
S0179	um
S0026	that's weird
S0058	that's
S0179	it be like how
S0026	they're not i don't know if you be oblige to honour a quote
S0179	no you be um
S0026	cos like if if a supermarket advertise something for a price and the price turn out to be completely wrong
S0179	no they be
S0026	then they then no they're not
S0058	well no like tesco's advertise their ipads
S0026	cos there be a there be a thing about um ipads
S0058	yeah
S0026	and they and they er just decide not to sell it for that price
S0179	no if actually if you push it you could've do that um
S0026	no no no you can't
S0058	i i think it's because they
S0026	no they no no
S0058	yeah
S0179	no it's er no no
S0058	yeah they're allow to change the price of something up to something like ten days before you they deliver it
S0179	no no it's a oh yeah that might've be a certain exception
S0026	no they they can sell
S0179	but there's a
S0026	they can sell things for as whatever they want up to the point that you actually give them the money
S0058	yeah
S0026	there's no
S0179	not no that's not
S0058	okay
S0179	exactly how it work i mean there's a that might be how they're say it work but this be a bite like the church of england say women can't be bishops when their completely against you anyway the um
S0058	what love
S0179	well it be an interest example this come up when i do one of my law taster day things
S0179	one of the example question they set us be so what happen if someone put a poster advertise a reward for a information on a lose dog and then change their mind but fail to take one of the posters down and um
S0058	decide they didn't don't care about the dog anymore
S0179	well no say um for example they take some of the posters down and miss one
S0026	no they wouldn't they're they're not you can't be force to honour something like that
S0179	legally you be
S0026	no you're not
S0179	you be
S0026	no cos it happen all the time online like someone'll get a price wrong and every time it happen it's like er forums explode
S0058	yeah
S0026	and they say oh they have to they have to honour the price now and it's just not true they never do
S0179	no it's no one force them to but in because it would take a lot of time and money to get that through the court but you actually be
S0026	no i don't i don't i don't think that's right i think you can er you can sell stuff for whatever price you want and if you advertise it wrong then you can always go back on it
S0179	mm er i
S0026	well i dunno
S0179	possibly i'm gonna go with the oxford law professor on this one
S0026	right

S0026	but you haven't you haven't agree to anything you haven't agree to buy to to buy something you haven't agree to a deal until the money have exchange hand or you've sign a contract just by see er something
S0058	yeah
S0026	for a price no no no agreement have be make for that by either party

S0058	can i put some caper on the top
S0179	i'll give you an example so it's also the reason that all quote have um a er valid until er it's generally like six months but point be that circumstances might have massively change their cost beyond that point so the point be you can

S0026	oh right
S0179	so that be quite
S0026	that's quite
S0179	well no i disagree with but um i dunno it's quite it's incredibly unique to be incredibly self motivate and self reliant as in there's no i've get no direct superiors no direct supervision as such
S0026	yeah
S0179	i might be work with a project leader but it's my it's er almost how much work i choose to do on my project how much time i devote it's all up to me
S0026	yeah
S0179	um in a way it's quite a nice size of company cos it's it's big enough such as it's stable
S0026	yeah
S0179	but it's small enough such that
S0058	oh er pasta's do

S0026	yeah
S0179	whatever um and um so when we be up with sarah's er grandpa in hospital he be complain that his nasal cannula be really sore cos it have be in for days
S0026	yeah

S0058	there's a plate there if you want er
S0026	right
S0179	so
S0179	let's er let's think about ways we can make this better for people and be there a way you can have a non contact one um
S0026	right
S0179	so i do some come in monday take my ipad in it's get a little cfd app on it we do a little bite of um and i do a little bite of er play around for half an hour or so we get a good idea um tuesday go over to one of our talk to er one of our designers he give us some more ideas chip in some stuff about plastics take it to one of our artists to draw up a sketch of
S0026	yeah
S0179	and it so happen that one of um our guy be in er the state pitch to a company who would be very who would potentially be interest
S0026	yeah
S0179	so we've gotta pitch on thursday
S0026	that's pretty good so rapid then
S0179	yeah so it's like but like
S0179	literally come up with this idea off the er top of my head

S0179	on sunday
S0026	mm
S0179	by thursday it be be present to one of the biggest pharmaceutical company in the state
S0026	that's quite good isn't it
S0058	um
S0179	er it's like because it's small you get that opportunity
S0026	yeah
S0179	and there so i'm just
S0058	you
S0179	someone else squeeze
S0058	cool
S0179	okay sting now
S0058	oh you don't have to do them in quarter that's gonna take
S0026	why sting have you get a cut on your finger or something

S0058	what
S0179	sorry just try to keep that filthy side up
S0058	again excellent

S0026	if you think about it you could like really artificially do one of these er one of these record and just like deliberately make the whole thing full of innuendo
S0026	or like completely mislead someone and only reveal reveal at the end
S0026	what you're actually talk about be something completely innocent and
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	well what amuse me be the idea of um we have it on in the car so if we get involve in an accident that would be quite a good black box
S0026	yeah

S0179	or what you could do if you could actually kid somebody into think you'd have an accident
S0058	yeah you could do all sort of things well er we saw that police car speed which be a problem because there be nothing we could really do about it you're like er that's not a good record just go look a police car speed that doesn't really count
S0179	yep okay
S0026	well er police cars be allow to speed aren't they

S0026	presumably she's in not even in her fourth year yet
S0058	no she's on her year abroad
S0026	oh right
S0058	i think er
S0026	mm
S0179	as a linguist obviously
S0026	yep
S0179	mm
S0058	be there anything else you do a year abroad for
S0179	sorry
S0058	guess there isn't
S0179	er no engineer can so can most most science subject actually
S0058	okay
S0179	but we actually spend a year study
S0058	ooh
S0179	well no objectively she's not really study
S0058	she be she's at uni
S0179	she's attend a few course
S0026	i think i think it's incredibly difficult do a year abroad
S0179	yeah i agree it's difficult but i mean she's study er
S0026	it's a whole year i mean er
S0179	well she's study german as a foreign language in italy in italian
S0026	yeah that be hard
S0058	mm
S0179	er i agree that's hard but it's not like
S0058	and in all fairness she doesn't know you know that's er i think that's really difficult you know
S0026	yeah i think that's really difficult
S0179	mm but in term of sort of time spend work versus time spend wander round italy
S0179	it it's it's she's get a pretty good ratio
S0026	right
S0179	go on i think you could quite honestly say
S0058	still nice work if you can get it
S0179	mm yeah indeed
S0026	mm quite nice caper by the way
S0179	i'm not sure really but they're quite nice
S0179	oh actually last night you'll never guess where we go

S0179	so the type of restaurant that we go to
S0058	mm
S0026	be it um mongolian
S0179	close
S0026	really what geographically close or
S0179	um sort of
S0026	just in term of obscurity
S0058	mm
S0179	er in term of obscurity something more obscure
S0026	be it um north korean
S0058	that's quite funny
S0179	um close in term of political lean
S0026	oh really
S0179	yep
S0026	be it like um
S0058	well
S0026	well chinese um
S0058	as in mental you mean
S0179	mm
S0058	rather than as in

S0058	it do a lot of stuff that
S0179	let's try that
S0026	what sort of food be it
S0058	a lot of it's similar to greek
S0026	don't say iranian
S0058	so so like a lot of it be um very very similar to greek
S0026	yeah
S0058	so either different name for hummus and taramosalata
S0179	well they're slightly different
S0058	tzatziki or slightly different but it's they're the same idea
S0179	yeah
S0058	and pitta bread
S0026	yeah

S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah

S0026	and with someone who's chinese
S0058	yeah
S0026	who know what to order
S0179	mm actually no i've have a good education there
S0058	hmm

S0026	yep
S0058	and they cook this amaze chinese feast
S0026	yeah
S0058	basically it be so good
S0179	apparently duck feet oh chicken feet
S0026	mm
S0058	chicken feet's a big thing
S0026	i have chicken feet in thailand
S0058	be they good cos they they say they would cook them for us
S0026	no they be stupid i mean there's just nothing on them at all
S0026	it's just
S0058	yeah
S0026	mostly bone and sinew and stuff
S0058	yeah
S0026	i don't really know what the point in them be you'd probably get a bite of meat off of them if you're really hungry but
S0058	yeah and the other thing be duck tongue which i don't really get the idea of
S0026	mm
S0058	like surely that's just pointless
S0026	must be really small
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's probably a delicacy
S0058	the beak be quite small yeah apparently
S0179	you know caviar slightly odd thing to eat but
S0058	oh that's true i guess er
S0179	you know people er
S0058	don't really like it
S0179	don't really like it what do you think of the food by the way
S0026	very good thank you yep mm
S0179	mm it's just essentially tuna with pasta
S0026	it's an interest flavour combination
S0179	but nice
S0026	yeah
S0179	mm
S0026	yeah it work really well
S0058	i like cinnamon in it i think
S0026	cos normally i put cinnamon in sweet stuff
S0058	mm
S0026	i've never really put it in like savoury stuff before
S0179	mm
S0058	it's really good in moussaka as well
S0179	it balance the lemon as well
S0026	mm
S0058	it be quite an easy way of get quite a lot of food
S0026	we've get um get a slow cooker in our house
S0058	mm
S0026	we've all start use this slow cooker recently it be really cheap it be like fifteen pound or something apparently
S0179	not for meat please
S0026	not for what
S0179	not for meat
S0026	yeah of course
S0179	oh god
S0026	slow cook chicken be fantastic honestly it's er it's very different
S0179	oh er chicken okay
S0026	slow cook meat be very very different to er i mean obviously you'd never slow cook steak
S0026	that'd be ridiculous
S0179	fine thank you
S0026	you know and stir fry be totally different again it's a different way of cook meat
S0058	mm
S0026	and you've gotta sort of get that in your head first
S0058	yeah
S0026	i mean it mean that you can like buy really cheap cut of beef and stuff
S0058	yeah
S0026	like braise steak
S0058	mm
S0026	well it's when it once you've slow cook it for like ten hours it just
S0026	fall apart and it's really really tasty
S0058	yeah we could do that i'd be quite keen to try it that's one thing we don't have a slow cooker
S0179	mm bear that in mind then
S0179	how do it work
S0026	er i i agree like i wasn't sell on it
S0058	mm
S0026	er er er either but you can make
S0058	no you
S0026	make some really er cos everything taste fantastic
S0179	mm
S0026	when it's be cook like slowly for ten hours
S0058	so you just you it in with some
S0179	the the problem be
S0058	some wine and some stuff
S0026	mm
S0058	um herbs and spice and whatever and
S0026	yeah and just leave it
S0179	that's essentially a marinade
S0026	well er
S0058	yeah but it cook it though
S0026	not really
S0058	so
S0026	you just marinade be like before you cook it you soak it in some sauce or something don't you but
S0179	yes and you
S0058	yes but it's basically the meat be cook in the sauce for
S0179	the point be it take it into the structure
S0026	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	so but do the slow cooker do the same or be it just on the surface
S0058	well
S0026	what do you mean on the surface
S0179	mm
S0058	well it's in the sauce for that long
S0026	it's just a slow cooker be just like a huge pot a deep pot
S0179	right
S0026	that warm up to maybe you know eighty or ninety degrees and sit there for eight hours
S0058	you put it on in the morning
S0026	you put it on in the morning
S0058	and you come back for your dinner
S0026	and you come back and
S0058	yeah
S0026	you eat it in the even and it's ready it's like a it make it make basically big casseroles and stew
S0179	actually i'm sceptical about casseroles and stew because you er well for example your mother
S0179	have this knack of ruin perfectly nice meat
S0058	mm
S0179	by stew it for hours
S0026	right
S0058	but she also cook everything
S0026	hmm
S0058	oh excuse me
S0026	yeah no i mean you don't put you don't put i mean things like crispy green vegetables you only put them in
S0058	yeah
S0026	for like the last fifteen minutes or something just to warm them up rather than stew them for twelve hours
S0058	yeah well be it
S0179	not if you're her mother
S0058	i have someone who have some
S0026	well i make a i make a thai curry in there and it be actually really good cos normally you just stir fry stuff
S0058	yeah
S0026	for thai curry but it make it very differently it's um
S0058	mm
S0026	it's pretty nice
S0058	i have something er be it be it neck it think it be lamb neck that she'd buy and it be really cheap and stick it in and that be really good
S0026	and stuff like lentils as well cos lentils have to be soak anyway
S0058	mm
S0026	but if you just put them in
S0179	i'm not a lentil fan
S0058	true yeah
S0026	i like lentils
S0058	mm
S0026	i think they're really good they're really high in protein as well
S0058	mm i think you're bias cos of your dad
S0026	lentils and meat be a winner
S0058	yeah
S0179	i always think lentils be a carbohydrate source
S0026	they be they're also a very good protein source like all pulse like haricot bean and kidney bean be also good protein source for vegetarians
S0058	you're just bias cos your dad's a massive lentil fan
S0179	mm i you don't live with any veggies do you
S0026	me
S0179	mm
S0026	no
S0179	mm thank god
S0026	but a few you know er a few people in my house live sort of almost live vegetarian and eventually i'll probably do that
S0179	mm
S0026	i'd like to i don't i don't wanna be i don't wanna be a complete vegetarian but i'd like to only eat meat once or twice a week
S0179	why
S0026	cos i just think ecologically it's more of a sustainable way of eat
S0179	fair enough
S0058	mm yeah
S0026	you sound quite you look quite upset my that pete
S0179	i'm not upset i be just consider it
S0058	sound fair enough
S0026	it's just i er just it's just a standard food chain argument of if we want to fee everyone it would we could fee them much more efficiently if we
S0058	eat
S0026	didn't raise crop on huge areas of land instead grow sensible you know
S0026	balance crop instead
S0058	mm
S0179	or alternatively if we want to fee everyone we should just use bloody gm and stop whinging about it
S0026	no i also agree with that
S0026	i do agree with that
S0179	er that's something that really fuck me off when you get these very sort of very middle class anti gm people and oh
S0058	yeah
S0179	yes you can afford
S0058	you yeah
S0179	food can't you
S0026	yeah
S0179	so get out of the way
S0026	no no i agree i agree completely
S0179	mm
S0026	mm
S0179	yeah when someone's stand in waitrose organic produce section
S0026	mm
S0179	who's have a go at gm it's yep
S0058	something wrong with that yeah
S0179	ah
S0026	but i think you'll find that third world countries don't generally object to gm
S0058	mm yeah
S0026	it's generally middle class people in in
S0179	yeah it's a bite like um so er bulimia or what do you call it anorexia doesn't exist in the third world just can't understand the concept
S0026	no that's not to say that isn't a real thing though
S0179	no indeed but it's it's very mm
S0058	hmm
S0179	not not on an individual basis but on a society basis a very self indulgent problem to have
S0026	mm possibly but it do exist as a thing
S0179	yeah i agree with that
S0026	and it should be take seriously
S0179	mm
S0026	yeah i think
S0058	but yeah on on yeah definitely like it's it's a very um privilege position to be in to be able to say i don't want to eat
S0026	mm
S0179	mm
S0058	crop that have have any chemicals or
S0179	because that technology you know it's not gonna be develop anywhere else and it doesn't filter down to people who actually need it
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean i don't understand how stupid these people be like everything you've ever eat be
S0179	genetically modify in some way shape or form
S0026	yeah cos it's be selectively breed
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0179	exactly so will you not understand that you retard
S0179	sorry
S0058	oh you get very annoy
S0179	yep
S0058	with the waitrose set
S0179	but it's interest actually
S0026	waitrose be a good good supermarket though i might add
S0058	i've never shop there
S0179	i don't it's good for some things not good for
S0026	one of my housemates occasionally go
S0058	okay
S0026	but it's really good
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's not good for fruit and veg i've find
S0026	mm
S0179	like for fresh produce it's not very good
S0026	it's good it's good for red meat
S0058	oh okay
S0026	they have really good steaks and burgers and stuff
S0058	mm
S0179	mm
S0026	their burgers be really really nice i don't know what they do with them but
S0179	oh yeah actually my mum get those cos we've be get a lot of our steaks from er m and s
S0026	right
S0179	really
S0058	they're they're good
S0026	we er we er we kind of me and evaluate quite a few
S0026	burgers so we do um waitrose sort of nice burgers we do tesco nice burgers
S0058	mm
S0026	and we do co op nice burgers and er the waitrose be definitely the best
S0179	i could've predict that possibly
S0026	but the co op be nicer than the tesco
S0058	okay
S0026	which be interest
S0058	mm yeah actually what's really good the m and s two dine for ten pound you can if you can get a steak on that
S0179	you can
S0058	you get steak and chip and
S0026	what what for ten pound sorry
S0058	er two dine for ten pound so you can get like
S0026	oh be that in their oh their
S0058	in their
S0026	take out meal thing
S0058	yeah
S0026	yeah
S0058	so you get like a main course a side dish a dessert and a bottle of wine
S0026	right
S0058	for ten quid
S0026	oh that's good
S0058	which be really good
S0179	steak chip nice bottle of wine
S0026	the bottle of wine make it
S0058	yeah
S0026	quite a nice deal yeah
S0179	well the wine's normally six quid by itself
S0026	mm wow
S0058	if you don't drink wine it's not so good but we do
S0026	mm
S0058	so
S0179	you don't say
S0058	no as in we drink wine normally it's not like a a rare occasion when we drink a bottle of wine so
S0179	mm good choice of album actually i'm enjoy this
S0179	don't know if i ever listen to it
S0026	i think it be the only full album you have on that ipod i think
S0179	that's really not true
S0026	no the only full stereophonics album
S0179	oh yeah yeah
S0026	not like but
S0026	also there aren't very many
S0058	i sneak this on you
S0026	full albums on there
S0058	i i sneak this on you cos um you be go through my music and look for ones you like i i look for ones i think i think you'd like and i figure you might like this one
S0026	cos i go through all the um i go on er the artists thing and i go in all the artists that i really like and there's generally like one song in there
S0026	rather than an album
S0179	i've get quite a lot of compilation albums which might explain that
S0026	mm
S0179	um yeah i've get maybe half a dozen artists i've get sort of six albums er of and then a couple i've get one album of and then most of the others be from either one off songs or compilations
S0026	right
S0058	mm you've get quite a lot of disturb albums
S0179	brilliant work out music
S0058	hmm
S0179	that's quite good drive music if you're tire
S0058	yeah someone shout at you basically
S0179	it's really good music though and you actually admit you quite like them
S0058	mm
S0179	as in er it's not just scream white noise it actually sort of
S0058	yeah i agree with that for
S0179	well the lyric for example
S0058	yeah
S0179	do kind of make sense
S0058	if that's the best you can say about a band you like you know there's there's lyric and they kind of make sense
S0179	well no as in a lot of metal's just random shite
S0179	i mean if you listen to rage against the machine it's just nonsense what they're say
S0026	no i disagree with that i love rage against the machine
S0058	i've never listen to enough of it to make a judgement
S0179	er
S0058	i've only really hear
S0026	i don't agree with their politics but er i think there's a
S0179	let me rephrase that the politics be very adolescent they're very i'm sort of fifteen and angry at my father sort of
S0179	to
S0026	no they're not really
S0179	to quote from but the
S0026	they're a bite more sophisticate than that i don't agree with most of them but they're more sophisticate than that
S0179	i'm not well it's i only have one of their songs in all fairness
S0179	which be
S0026	at least there be actually some sentiment to them like i've have a lot of pop music that's so sterile that
S0058	yeah exactly
S0026	the person who's sing it hasn't write it which be not necessarily a problem but
S0026	like it's just
S0058	i know what you mean
S0026	it's just generic and
S0058	it doesn't mean anything yeah
S0026	bore i can't even listen to the radio anymore i hate it
S0179	yep
S0058	yeah i use to listen to the chart and now i'm like
S0179	this be a sign of age
S0026	i know i'm aware of that
S0058	i'm get into my folk music i think i'm forty
S0026	it's the inevitable slide from radio 1 to radio 2
S0058	yeah
S0026	and then radio 4 but that happen quite
S0058	oh
S0026	a few years ago for me
S0058	yeah radcliffe and maconie have be um put on 6 music but they be the best thing on radio 2
S0179	you see that happen to me about
S0026	mm
S0179	simultaneously with puberty
S0026	mm
S0058	when you stop go to school disco you discover radio 4
S0179	er well yeah i
S0179	never actually go through puberty i kind of have a mid life crisis instead
S0026	the thing be like
S0058	yeah
S0026	um the thing that i find be that well what that's weird i mean
S0179	oh
S0026	we sort of grow up in the nineties
S0058	yeah
S0026	but i be still too young in the early nineties to appreciate the music at the time so like the grunge movement that appear
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0026	and that be the music now
S0058	we be around but
S0026	that i i only listen to like early nineties grunge pretty much
S0058	mm
S0179	what be grunge
S0026	it's like the music that come out of seattle in the nineties so alice in chain nirvana
S0179	oh nirvana
S0026	pearl jam that sort of music
S0179	okay
S0026	and people like silverchair and well pearl jam be still go as well
S0058	mm
S0179	i i literally know nirvana out of that lot
S0026	right
S0179	but okay
S0026	but that be just my sort of i just i just love it
S0058	yeah
S0026	like like there isn't anything else now cos i've go back to that and i think
S0058	yeah yeah i know
S0026	it's just it just kind of suit me so well
S0058	mm
S0179	you see i still enjoy i mean i've probably the broadest range of music i like of anyone i've ever meet um which
S0058	you'll listen to anything
S0179	sorry
S0058	you'll listen to anything
S0179	yeah
S0179	and like i will um my ipod be vary if nothing else which mean put it on shuffle's a bite dangerous
S0026	mm
S0179	um so i've get sort of almost entirely instrumental celtic folk music from you through to
S0179	pretty hardcore
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	death metal and almost everything in between um
S0058	bite of hilary duff
S0179	whose first album be brilliant whose second album be gobshite

S0026	i'd like i'm not sure what i'd like to listen to but i'm interest to know
S0179	well there be one or two
S0179	very good songs on it and there's a couple of okay songs
S0058	pretty much standard with pop albums
S0179	um but the second album's
S0179	completely different and awful but i didn't really realize this until after i'd buy it
S0026	well

S0026	my second year or third year or something
S0026	must've be third year
S0179	mm

S0026	who's the other person
S0179	um you may have meet him he's er a friend like of mine but specifically 's from school um

S0179	um
S0026	right be he one of these memorable character
S0179	yeah
S0026	right
S0179	um lovely lovely guy very memorable
S0026	mm
S0179	um
S0058	in what sense you have to explain now
S0179	well for example he's piss against the outside wall of the bar
S0058	yep
S0179	um
S0058	so do you have a night out with him and you remember it
S0179	i don't think through a window but er
S0179	oh no sorry it be the it be the flower bed under a staircase
S0179	just between there and the bar
S0058	nice that's that's that's classy
S0179	he's the only person i've ever know who's take a leak inside um
S0026	there must be others though i bet there be others
S0058	oh there would've be others
S0026	yeah
S0058	probably fellows
S0026	yeah lecturers have do that
S0058	lecturers have do that
S0058	i can see that happen i love
S0179	he's get a he's get a room in a so you know
S0058	
S0179	yeah
S0058	have he
S0179	yeah he's first floor a he's get a
S0058	oh
S0179	study
S0058	okay
S0179	um er
S0058	actually no but
S0179	actually no no one would do that cos most people know that there be toilets inside every
S0179	staircase
S0058	yeah
S0026	yeah
S0179	the funny thing be he be
S0058	depend how piss you be
S0179	probably piss against the outside wall of a toilet
S0179	he could've just walk round into
S0058	god
S0026	must've be desperate
S0058	what can you do
S0179	he must've be hammer
S0179	solution
S0026	mm
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0026	well unfortunately i won't be here this summer so i won't can't er can't volunteer to do your cross channel craziness
S0058	and you're not mental so yeah
S0179	sure you don't
S0026	i'm not mental either
S0026	i can swim but i don't swim really so
S0179	sure you don't feel like it
S0026	not really sorry
S0058	fair enough
S0179	it's a great to full body strength
S0026	i don't know that's for you we we me and you have very different definitions of strength
S0179	well as in er you're use pretty much all of your body's muscle for a long time
S0026	but i strength be how much you can lift it's not how long you can use a muscle for both be valuable obviously but
S0058	mm
S0179	one help the other so i've very strong legs but i very rarely do weight with them it's just cos of run and er to be fair that's where a fair amount of my chest strength come from
S0026	yeah you do get you do get some from but the most effective way to get stronger be to lift heavier weight cos that be the
S0179	i think a lot of people would
S0026	the definition of strength be how much you can lift
S0179	i think er
S0058	yeah it it depend how you define it exactly yeah whereas if your definition be how long you can go for then obviously you need to do different things
S0179	in all fairness though er it's quite well recognize that sprint train be a very good way of get extra leg strength
S0026	but sprint trainers always do heavy weight because that's the only way they can get strong enough to compete with other very strong sprinters
S0179	mm yes i know
S0026	sprinters do have very strong legs i admit
S0179	but er
S0026	definitely they have to have
S0179	er yeah but a lot of that
S0058	yeah
S0179	do come it's not all from the weight a lot of that come from the run
S0026	but that's more power rather than strength
S0179	subtle distinction
S0179	but alright
S0026	no there be a there be a distinction though
S0058	mm
S0026	cos power be effectively how fast you can lift the weight
S0058	hmm
S0026	er it's that be how it's manifest really
S0179	okay
S0179	um
S0026	and that's why power lift be be a bite of a misnomer because it's
S0058	yeah
S0026	not about how fast you can lift the weight it's about strength it should really be call strength lift
S0058	yeah yeah i know what you mean ah
S0179	um
S0058	interest
S0179	mm
S0026	but yeah
S0026	sprinters do a lot of weight train cos it's good for sprint
S0058	mm
S0026	a lot of power relate sprinter train as well like fast explosive
S0179	mhm
S0026	sort of er squat and things
S0058	yeah
S0179	um but yes um er if you change your mind
S0026	yeah i don't really swim very much though
S0058	huh
S0026	i can swim about last time i go swim i do about i do about one or two lengths and i be completely exhaust
S0058	swimming's really knackering
S0026	like i'm not unfit you know
S0058	yeah
S0026	i can play football and i can run reasonable reasonable distance but as soon as i start swim i'm just terrible at it i just i have i mean i'd be good if i practice but i don't i er hardly ever swim so i dunno i don't really enjoy it that much if i'm really honest like it's alright but
S0058	shall i er
S0179	okay
S0058	plat away
S0179	um
S0026	but good luck with
S0058	thank you
S0026	your er thank you good luck with your cross channel
S0026	attempt
S0179	mm
S0026	it's quite adventurous that
S0179	well yeah er it i love swim in open water and i'm pretty resistant to cold
S0026	yeah
S0179	so between the two it's seem like quite
S0026	be you gonna grease yourself up for it
S0179	there's two school of think on that
S0026	be you gonna wear like a huge suit or something
S0179	no no you can't you um in order for it to be recognize um you have to do it in speedos and a swim cap and goggle and that's it
S0026	really
S0179	um so er but er you can wear grease
S0179	er apparently one of the main advantage be protection from jellyfish sting
S0026	oh really
S0179	yeah
S0026	oh that's interest
S0179	well it's the initial thermal shock and then the jellyfish protection
S0026	yeah
S0179	so i'm pretty
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah
S0026	interest
S0179	yeah i think er it it it could just be a very challenge ten hours
S0026	yeah i think you're probably right there
S0179	however um that didn't work
S0026	what be these things
S0179	minions
S0026	minions
S0179	you haven't see the film despicable me have you
S0026	i don't think so i sort of recognise them from some film but i don't think i've see that film
S0179	er
S0026	despicable me
S0179	yeah
S0026	be it a pixar film
S0179	er it's animate i'm not sure it's pixar it might be
S0026	it might be dreamworks then or something
S0058	it's i think it's dreamworks
S0026	right
S0179	brilliant film
S0026	right what's it about
S0179	um it well it's actually it's er it's a children's film in principle um but it's brilliant um
S0179	this super villain gru
S0026	right
S0179	hence the g
S0026	okay
S0179	um a very likeable super villain he's the er protagonist and
S0058	he try not to be likeable at the begin
S0179	and he's try to he's be a bite old and a bite past it and there's this sort of younger villain call um
S0026	oh hang on i think i might have see it
S0058	call vector
S0179	call vector
S0026	i have see it
S0179	attitude and direction
S0026	be he be he be he purple the the main guy
S0179	no
S0058	no he's
S0179	that no that's megamind
S0058	oh that's megamind
S0026	oh i mean er megamind
S0058	it's kind of similar
S0026	it's the same it sound the same like
S0179	it's yeah it's similar
S0026	a villain who's not really a villain he's actually quite nice
S0179	er yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's a very similar concept only
S0026	megamind's quite funny
S0058	megamind's good
S0179	yeah this be subtly better
S0026	right
S0179	er
S0026	no i haven't definitely haven't see this then
S0179	okay um tut what i suggest be if i go and print the map out and work out where the hell we're actually go tomorrow
S0058	yeah
S0179	i'm just gonna pack kit in the morning since we've get a bite more time now
S0058	yeah well there's not really anything to pack um
S0179	well rucksack walk kit
S0058	yeah but as in it's not gonna take hours to pack it's just a case of get it out and throw it in a bag
S0026	it's just lunch right isn't it and
S0058	oh yeah i'll make lunch tonight i think
S0179	um yeah so um if you two wouldn't mind clear up while i go sort the communications out
S0026	that's fine
S0179	i'll also ring at the same time
S0058	you could put on speakerphone
S0179	yeah indeed find out what's up
S0058	with his date er
S0179	well i also need the detail for this walk
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	so er
S0026	oh i saw something print out anyway that's fair enough
S0179	yeah that's um something my dad do
S0026	okay
S0179	er a while ago i need to find it on the os map and sort of and um but yeah and bunch of his people from work be do um tut this er forty mile walk um tut in the lakes um it's not over hill it's along pretty flat terrains but
S0026	yeah
S0179	er i call him while i be in you know but it's non stop so they'll complete it in about sixteen hours
S0026	yeah
S0179	um it's a charity thing um but they need a support team um i e well car to take food and clothe cos they can't carry that
S0026	right
S0179	well they could to to be fair but
S0058	yeah
S0179	they're not um so i volunteer to be the support team
S0026	mm
S0179	er which should be fun which be really not cos i'd actually love to be do it with them
S0026	me and um and the guy that i live with be do this thing call tough mudder
S0179	oh yes
S0026	do i tell you about it it's like a twelve um
S0179	the website's bizarre
S0026	it's a twelve mile endurance course with obstacles and er
S0179	you endurance
S0026	on fire and yeah i can run
S0026	i love endurance course be like er
S0179	um
S0026	it's not just just er run it's you know carry they make you carry log and stuff as well
S0058	wow
S0026	and er climb over big tall things and get electrocute
S0058	sound quite manly
S0026	yeah
S0179	you know it's er essentially that's what all my train focus be on
S0026	yeah
S0179	um as in it be sort of er initially focus around army endurance and just
S0026	i love i love the idea that you don't think i like endurance i play football every week
S0026	twice
S0179	that's not endurance
S0058	oh
S0026	that be endurance
S0058	that make a really cool noise
S0179	um anyway the um but but it's really funny though cos you er you go on the website it's like er yeah we think marathons be for pussies and then it then it
S0026	no i don't think they say that i think they say we think marathons be bore and i agree with them i wouldn't ever do a marathon i can appreciate people who do but it's not really my scene i appreciate that you have to be incredibly fit to do one
S0179	i think it it well no i think um yeah you have to have a very you need to be a good marathon runner you need like like if you line up a load of runners i could spot the marathon runners just from their body type as in you have
S0179	no upper body strength moderate core strength and not particularly leg strength
S0179	basically you need to be as light as possible cos that make each step so much easier it's disturb if you look at how thin some of them be like just the legs you expect anyway um
S0058	oh you can put that on the hob if you want
S0179	but um i dunno it's just like some of the obstacles like run through an electrify field why
S0026	yeah it's awesome
S0026	why not
S0179	like er like some of the things be just like if they just take like a military assault course fine but some of these things be just like design to inflict pain for no good reason i mean i like pain like the next man but it
S0026	so why be you er why aren't you keen to have it inflict on you for no good reason
S0179	well no there have to be a good reason for it though
S0058	you're will to put up with pain
S0179	ooh it's
S0026	i think it's quite fun
S0058	oh
S0058	oh it's
S0026	er do we need to load this dishwasher then
S0058	um it's load um i'm just gonna wash all the other bits up by hand
S0026	okay do you want me to do it i don't mind do it

S0120	site um so there's the control build and there's the there's two pump kiosks
S0026	yeah
S0120	each with two pump in and it's troughs to carry power and control cable across
S0120	between kiosks
S0120	one have to go underneath the access road so it have to be quite reasonably reinforce
S0058	so
S0120	fuck big thing though one and a half metres deep
S0026	what the whole the the cavity itself
S0120	the
S0026	oh the trough
S0120	yeah
S0026	yeah
S0120	the whole
S0026	oh right
S0120	um
S0058	so do you get it wrong with the
S0120	yes
S0026	get it right
S0058	yeah you've gotta get it right or people will
S0120	no but
S0058	fall into the trough
S0120	the calculations be check by better people than i
S0120	and er yeah very anyway
S0058	excellent
S0120	um but it'll be nice eventually to see all the my design in the grind
S0058	in a road yeah
S0120	not that many weeks' time i guess
S0058	mm
S0120	it's er part of it be a bite of a build er build and design situation rather than a design and build situation
S0058	what what so they're build it first
S0120	well it's almost that
S0120	it's so tight
S0058	oh right okay
S0120	um
S0058	so they've get
S0120	they're try to get it do a s a f p
S0026	yeah
S0120	um and er
S0058	oh
S0120	it's kind of er a bite construction's happen in parallel with design
S0120	and er they're
S0120	use us
S0058	no
S0120	as well it's er
S0026	mm
S0120	it's not that terrible i mean it's not situation
S0026	well it's er it's good in that you can sort of fee back things that need to be do like instantly that that
S0120	yeah
S0026	you might otherwise have kind of finalize design and you'd never have think of it until you start build it
S0120	yeah
S0026	but
S0120	um
S0026	it's not often that you have a situation where
S0026	design can't be finalize properly you know just
S0120	mm i mean it's like
S0120	we we design the pipework and send that to the the pipework fabrication subcontractor
S0026	right
S0120	who then develop as build draw about how they plan to make it so they might you know weld and a bunch of stuff
S0026	yeah
S0120	instead of necessarily take different section and
S0026	yeah
S0120	bolt them together
S0026	yeah
S0120	or whatever you know and we just take those propose join and comment on them and blah blah blah and make sure that they're alright and then once they're fix and it's alright you know that's what's gonna be use and then we use their fabrication draw and our main layout draw work in
S0058	um
S0120	for example
S0058	ah
S0120	reasonably interest yes how about you
S0026	yeah work's alright i've get um
S0026	yeah i've i'm really enjoy work there we've i've get um sort of kind of get three project on at the moment one of them be one that i start when i first start it's like a research project
S0120	mm
S0026	and the company's finally decide they want to stump up for this bite of kit
S0120	mm
S0026	which would kind of validate my research
S0120	oh excellent
S0026	er so if we get this bite of kit we can do lot of like it's it's control loop model my research project so a lot of the control loop for a a power circuit
S0120	mm
S0026	and um but you can't test if my theory's correct if my model be right until you get this bite of kit and they're like oh we'll go and buy this bite of kit now not because of what i'd but because they decide we need it anyway so i'm go back to that project i'm not do it for a few months when we get this bite of kit i've get another one which be like reverse engineer which be really weird where a japanese car manufacturer have ask us to work out how a european competitor vehicle
S0026	um do
S0026	do er do its safety feature
S0058	nice
S0026	so we buy a vw polo
S0026	and it's a really good one it's a gti so it's like stupidly powerful a hundred and eighty three horsepower engine
S0120	yeah
S0026	well a proper boy racer car tiny little car
S0026	and we've just i've just be like take it apart and like log load of data
S0058	cool
S0026	um plot it in matlab and do analysis and stuff like that so that's kind of
S0120	sound pretty awesome
S0026	it's quite basic stuff it's pretty basic stuff but i've actually learn a bite about how an engine work cos i didn't really know
S0120	mm
S0026	much about mechanical stuff before that
S0120	you actually get to take stuff apart and play with
S0026	yeah nice
S0120	play with gadgets and
S0026	and my other project which be start on monday be a european fund project to do with thermo electric generators so there's some
S0120	mm
S0026	like eu fund thing to work out if it's worthwhile put these generators on the tail pip of truck like exhaust pip so you run a heat engine well it's not really a it be a heat engine it's like a
S0120	mm
S0026	electrical solid state type thing between a hot source which be the exhaust gas and a cold source which be the engine coolant and try and charge up a battery so they're hybrid truck that they're propose
S0120	right
S0026	um and we're like a subcontractor for one of the main people
S0120	be the engine sort of really the coolest thing
S0026	well it it be a reservoir
S0120	oh okay
S0026	i mean the only other thing you could use be air
S0120	yeah
S0026	but it's not like easy enough to transfer to
S0120	right
S0026	it'll be typically be ninety degrees the exhaust gas could be like pre catalytic converter they could be like four hundred degrees or something
S0120	oh right
S0026	there's enough of a differential to use the engine cooler as yeah
S0120	right
S0026	as the cold source apparently i mean i don't know anything about the thermodynamics but i think the stuff that i'm gonna be do be like model probably in matlab the they want they want a one d thermo electric model and i don't even know anything about this yet cos it's kick off tomorrow well like our first meet er on on monday so i don't really know but it sound pretty interest
S0120	yeah hmm
S0026	yeah i'm quite i'm quite enjoy it quite a lot of different stuff go on so
S0120	mm
S0026	have you be in london today
S0120	sorry
S0026	have you be in london today
S0120	yeah yep
S0026	how do it go be you row
S0120	yeah
S0026	who for
S0120	cantabs
S0026	what's that be that like graduate or something
S0120	no um no it's just one of the town club
S0026	right
S0120	um cantabrigian row club er you know the you noviced didn't you
S0026	yeah
S0120	you know the last boathouse you pass before you get to
S0026	right
S0120	um that's it
S0026	oh okay
S0120	so it's way it's the furthest out
S0026	yeah how do do be they row today
S0120	i didn't find out because i only i get the e mail from the cantabs people about our result but i don't know about er selwyn it would be interest to compare
S0026	hmm
S0120	and i think cantabs m2 and selwyn m2 might be interest to compare
S0026	be you in different divisions then
S0120	we're in different categories
S0026	right
S0120	um er selwyn m2 be in novice category
S0026	mm
S0120	cantabs m2 be in im2
S0026	be that intermediate men or something
S0120	yeah
S0026	right
S0120	um well yeah i think we're in im2 um or er i think it's just the intermediate
S0026	it's quite a funny thing the selwyn
S0120	um and then
S0026	selwyn m2 be novice
S0120	selwyn m1 and cantabs m1
S0026	yeah
S0120	be also in different categories
S0026	selwyn m1
S0120	mm
S0026	what's selwyn m1 be they in the novice category as well
S0120	i dunno as in
S0058	wuh
S0120	selwyn
S0026	what be they in what
S0120	what be they in
S0026	yeah
S0120	oh er can't remember which category one of the ims
S0026	oh right so not okay yeah
S0120	i think i think cantabs m1 might be a um
S0120	something above im
S0026	right
S0120	something else i don't know
S0120	kind of seed i think
S0026	mm
S0120	so my boat come two hundred and thirty fourth
S0058	hmm
S0026	out of
S0120	four hundred and four
S0058	mm
S0026	that's very good
S0058	pretty good yeah
S0026	be that your division then or just everyone
S0120	everyone
S0026	okay oh right cool
S0120	it take a fuck long time
S0026	yeah i bet it do
S0120	so er at the start yeah so they're seed and so everybody go in order of their expect um roughly expect result
S0026	mm
S0120	so leander one go past you know perfect
S0026	who's leander one
S0120	er well first boat of leander which be one of the one of the boat club on the thames
S0026	right
S0120	and leander be generally accept as the best in the country
S0026	okay
S0120	molesey be another one again on the thames kind of up there with leander and they're the first two and then there be the czech crew
S0026	oh right
S0058	nice
S0120	in three and they be they be um come up hard behind molesey so i i'm interest interest to see how they do there be a few
S0026	what the czechs
S0120	a few different european club
S0026	oh right
S0120	um cambridge or the oxford and cambridge lightweights race but not the blue
S0026	right
S0120	cos they've get they don't they wouldn't waste their time
S0026	yeah so the the blue would be the best boat if they be race would they or would they not
S0120	i don't know
S0026	mm
S0120	don't know i mean it's basically the same course as the boat race
S0026	yeah
S0058	so you could probably find out
S0120	just it's just backwards
S0026	right
S0120	and obviously not on the same day and the tide might be very slightly different although both be do both be organize so that it happen when the tide be go with you um mm yeah so they might
S0058	should've ask um would any of you like a drink
S0026	um
S0026	i'm alright i think for now
S0058	do you wanna drink
S0120	um might be nice
S0026	peter's gonna open his whisky soon anyway
S0058	um
S0120	i'll avoid whisky but um
S0058	what would you like there's you know what there be
S0120	er
S0058	there's beer probably some ah the your formal wine be in the fridge if you'd like your formal
S0120	um
S0058	and our formal wine if you'd like that
S0120	i'm er i'm lean more towards beer
S0058	yeah beer's cool yeah just scrub the er
S0120	guess i know where to find it wahey
S0058	er would you like a glass or like
S0120	i'm alright
S0058	ooh
S0120	mhm
S0058	ah
S0120	i er meet up with and
S0058	be it good
S0120	nice er
S0058	have a nice chat
S0120	yeah um ooh i be gonna ask um you don't have savlon and a plaster do you
S0058	i've get a plaster we might have
S0120	or something antiseptic
S0058	dettol antiseptic wash it's like savlon
S0058	probably yeah um
S0120	dettol sound like what you
S0058	oh yeah it's it's just for it's be for hand it's not it's just for skin it's it's not um like stuff that stick
S0120	ready to use skin wind spray
S0058	yeah
S0120	yeah right
S0058	it's it's um
S0120	okay for break skin as well
S0058	i think it i think it's just the same as um
S0120	get myself a nice blister
S0058	savlon but
S0120	as you can see
S0058	yeah
S0120	but er it appear and then rip and it be
S0058	uh
S0120	quite agonize at least i only start notice it once once we'd finish
S0120	but um er yeah
S0058	nasty
S0120	get a plaster
S0058	yes i have um what type would you like just a little a long one of them or a thicker bigger one do that sting
S0120	well no not really
S0058	oh one of them be that good
S0120	um yeah
S0026	what have you do
S0120	get myself a massive blister
S0026	oh nice
S0120	i think it's get bits of thames in it
S0026	oh no
S0058	oh diseases
S0120	yeah i hope i haven't get leptospirosis
S0058	what's that
S0026	be that worse than
S0120	weil's disease
S0026	i be gonna say be that worse than weil's disease
S0120	it's the same thing
S0058	oh right
S0120	cos if anything be certain it's certain that rat have piss in the thames
S0026	yeah
S0058	yeah nice
S0026	can i play with your ipad
S0058	yeah sure yeah um should i put the password in
S0026	yeah i don't think i've ever use one before
S0120	although to my body's credit it also seem
S0058	there you go
S0120	seem to have already re graft the skin slightly
S0026	right
S0058	nice
S0120	where the blister
S0026	that's pretty good go
S0120	open up
S0058	be it clean that'll do
S0026	hmm
S0058	still have the inclination to do
S0026	's read a wind turbine recipe book
S0058	oh yeah that be from his um fourth year project
S0026	this be his fourth year project
S0058	the um book in the er um ibooks or whatever it's call be from his fourth year project yeah ah right
S0120	oh yeah 's actually get his drive book back now
S0026	you can tell this be a
S0058	yeah
S0026	a book for electrical engineer
S0026	just say an inverter be just a big box of electronics
S0058	nice
S0026	no it's so
S0058	nice
S0026	there's so much to it
S0120	i don't even know what the inverter do
S0026	there's so much to it
S0026	it's not just anything
S0058	excellent
S0120	what do an inverter do
S0026	dc to ac
S0120	oh okay yeah
S0026	it's the opposite of rectifier
S0120	uh huh
S0026	let's see
S0120	i know you can er you can achieve a really crude um ac to dc with a few diodes and a capacitor
S0026	yeah
S0120	or two
S0026	that's a simple
S0120	be that basically it
S0026	a simple rectifier yeah but inverter go the other way
S0120	mm
S0026	it's for like what you use to
S0026	what you use to power motor and things when you've gotta like generate signal for phasers and stuff
S0120	it be nice er have the door open to me you know when i knock this time
S0058	oh yes
S0120	unlike last year last
S0026	do that not happen last time
S0120	no i be quiz
S0058	mm
S0120	last time
S0026	quiz
S0058	you can't give us an enigma and then not answer
S0120	mm sorry
S0058	you can't give us an enigma and then not tell us
S0120	yeah i could
S0058	you do
S0120	i do
S0058	do eventually let you in
S0120	successful
S0058	yeah
S0058	ah might make lunch
S0120	in fact i'm er oh must of er finish about twenty five minutes ago
S0058	finish
S0120	last the last um ooh 's awake
S0120	oh be that
S0058	yeah it's a new one yeah
S0120	oh hello
S0058	how do you know the name do i tell you this
S0120	yes
S0058	oh fair enough
S0026	yeah you've be record
S0058	yeah
S0026	since the moment you walk in
S0058	that's fine 's er 's use to it
S0026	you'll be you'll be know as
S0120	this be the third time
S0026	you'll be know you'll be know as number four on this transcript
S0058	yeah it's that's true
S0120	what
S0058	we
S0120	oh
S0058	number the speakers base on the order they speak in you're number four
S0120	okay fair enough
S0058	er that's how it work yeah nothing you can do about it now ah
S0120	mm
S0058	i can't be bother to go to bed but i should
S0120	um mm
S0058	get the tuna off the the splashback
S0120	hope i er hope i get a text tomorrow
S0058	any text
S0120	about er
S0120	about the um stay up
S0058	ah
S0120	situation
S0058	yes when do she find out
S0120	otherwise it it be just a an elaborate ruse to let me down gently
S0058	oh when do she find out
S0120	hmm
S0058	when do she find out or do she not know
S0120	i don't know
S0058	okay oh
S0120	but i mean she be gonna go home this weekend
S0058	right so er she's either
S0120	so
S0058	go home or isn't
S0120	well
S0058	go home
S0120	no she act she she's probably stand in the corpus playroom right now do
S0058	okay
S0120	the get up
S0058	oh so she might be go home tomorrow
S0120	yeah
S0058	but might not be
S0120	yeah i dunno
S0058	she'll she'll probably tell you aw
S0058	bless
S0120	my mind get
S0058	uh
S0120	ever more pessimistic as
S0058	uh
S0120	as time wear on
S0058	oh
S0120	just a standard theme for me
S0058	aw
S0026	what get pessimistic
S0120	my mind
S0026	your mind
S0120	yeah so basically um on oh when be it thursday i ask a girl out and um she's a finalist at lucy cav
S0026	right
S0120	um and i have have terrible time cos it's the end of term
S0026	oh yes
S0120	and she be she be gonna go home this weekend but she's try to get college to let her stay up so she can work a bite more on her dissertation here anyway so if that work
S0120	if that work
S0120	we've get a date this week if not no
S0058	so you're on tenterhooks
S0120	yes
S0058	aw
S0026	well good luck with that
S0026	what's she call
S0026	how do you know her
S0120	um act stuff
S0026	oh right
S0120	um yes the one play that i actually act in in be when i meet her um note on another life the monstrosity of players do
S0058	monstrosity in a good sense
S0120	in um our third year
S0058	er how do how do you mean monstrosity
S0120	it be well i dunno
S0120	huh the play be er would've could've do with a lot of rework or rewrite
S0058	there yeah it wasn't the most obvious fresher play
S0120	the you could you could see what he be try to do and er there there be something possibly good in that approach but it could have do with rewrite it entirely really
S0026	can i have a hand
S0058	yeah sure
S0026	yeah
S0058	oh my knees just sit down
S0120	and then er on sunday i just randomly bump into her er in the street and
S0058	have you
S0120	we have ice cream because it be sunny and um she mention she
S0026	very good
S0120	be do a play this week um
S0026	awesome
S0120	and i go to see it on wednesday and she be very good she actually write it
S0026	where's it be perform
S0120	it's quite abstract um corpus playroom
S0026	right
S0120	mm the little one
S0026	's get an app call volvo s60 on his er on his ipad
S0120	an app oh wow
S0026	i'm gonna see what it be here we go volvo s60
S0026	mm very dramatic mm it's just a video oh dear
S0120	such a volvo addict
S0026	i do er i do sometimes wonder if he's a bite of a bite of a slave to market
S0026	this be funny excuse me build to inspire impure thoughts of punctuality what interest oh you can style your s60
S0120	er yeah can imagine he spend a lot of time on his with his fruit ninja
S0026	fruit ninja what's that mean
S0120	oh have you come across fruit ninja
S0026	no i don't think i have
S0120	oh it's a game you can get on smartphones and so on
S0026	ooh
S0120	and ipads
S0120	um you just you just you just slice up fruit basically
S0120	it's addictive
S0026	you slice up fruit
S0120	yes
S0026	mm
S0120	it's just one of those silly and addictive little
S0026	yeah
S0120	game like angry bird
S0026	right i don't i just don't see the attraction of angry bird i find it really
S0120	i've never try it
S0026	i find it really bore i just don't understand why everyone play it
S0120	mm
S0026	in fact to be honest like i find most game on phone really bore can knockdown let's try that
S0120	oh dear
S0026	i wonder if we get er wonder what we've gotta do on this game
S0026	play yeah so apparently we're drive to the peak district tomorrow
S0120	yeah apparently
S0026	quite a long way how do you do this yeah
S0120	wahey
S0026	ah there's a bite of a knack to this yes take that can huh ooh interest oh that's not fair
S0120	do you have to flick it can you yeah
S0026	yeah turn out you've gotta do it in a really specific way though it isn't doesn't seem quite
S0179	uh you do have a drink right i be about to say you don't have a drink i'll get you one um oh that's brilliant that game
S0179	good shoot what's your high score
S0026	i dunno i've only just start
S0120	twenty nine
S0026	i find it quite weird the way you've gotta do it like it's not as intuitive well once you get it it's fine but
S0179	yeah
S0120	er
S0026	oh
S0120	oh
S0179	yeah you suck um sorry you sure you'll be very good
S0120	he start play it thirty second ago
S0026	yeah come on pete give me cut me some slack
S0179	no there's no slack in this house um i've just find the route um well i just find the detail of where we're gonna go
S0026	okay
S0179	um yeah we're start from an er really desert lay by from the look of things
S0026	right
S0179	where the car's gonna be park all day so er yeah that's gonna be fun so we might finish the walk and get back and find the car's go
S0026	well hopefully not
S0179	um yeah i hope not too actually oh yeah that's a bitch that one
S0026	i get it all in one last time
S0179	yeah you if you get it right you can it's really addictive this i should point out
S0179	i take i take it log you onto it
S0026	no i just guess your password
S0179	mm yeah um
S0179	cos it i'm not sure if you actually know what the pin number be for it so
S0120	mm no
S0026	i don't
S0179	thank god for that right um
S0026	have you get facebook on here

S0179	well it it doesn't have any free weight which be one of the
S0026	be this the one we go to
S0120	yeah the their insurance
S0179	no no

S0026	which one be you talk about
S0179	er it's at the university centre we be and i be members of it in third and fourth year
S0120	i'm now a member there
S0179	it's a very nice gym um for what it do it's it's get certain drawbacks
S0120	yeah
S0179	um
S0120	the only upper body stuff that it have be chest press and those things
S0179	shoulder press
S0120	sorry
S0179	shoulder press
S0120	er alright yeah
S0179	um
S0120	that's it
S0179	well it's get i suppose it's get no it's get it's um
S0120	well they've get that crazy hand pedal thing
S0179	oh i do love that there's
S0120	i've only try it like
S0026	mm
S0120	once for a couple of minutes as a warm down
S0179	i do a five minute session if you like it like you can have a lot more
S0026	it's interest
S0179	um yeah i like that one um uh i dunno i use to do sort of i use to come off a run and then do five minutes of that um
S0120	mm
S0179	but it's a little weird what do they call it um arm row seat row something like that
S0026	which one
S0179	er
S0179	do that
S0026	look like box or something that i know i think i know the thing you mean
S0120	no it's sort of like pedal
S0026	mm
S0179	oh um yeah we've get one in the gym we be in um today um really cool um er really interest er move i've discover um it's to do um sort of er er er it's er what's the word er shadow punch no that's not it but just um sort of practice jab but with um sort of a dumb bell in each hand circuit last week and it's quite difficult
S0120	mm
S0179	actually
S0026	have you hear of this site call fitocracy before
S0120	yeah
S0179	no i don't er
S0026	have you hear of it
S0120	i've hear of it
S0026	it's good it's really good
S0179	i don't tend to google well i don't tend to use the internet in fitness actually no that's not true i
S0120	i know there be an xkcd comic about fitocracy
S0026	yeah that's what i that's where i get it from but it's actually really useful
S0120	i think i've hear of it before that but
S0026	take me a long time to get an invite to it
S0179	an invite
S0026	so it's like
S0120	yeah
S0026	it's kinda like
S0179	like facebook
S0026	sort of social media
S0179	right
S0026	but it's not really like facebook but it's aim at exercise
S0179	right
S0026	so every time you do a work out or any form of exercise you log it
S0179	mm
S0026	um and you can track your progress and you can like join group and people er people who do similar stuff and like compete against people and get well yeah get sort of award and things but it's the i just use it for track cos otherwise i just track it in an excel spreadsheet
S0179	mm
S0026	but you can track it on the website and then export it as a sort of csv thing and then you can but er you can also like see what you've do in the past and view it quite nicely as bar chart and stuff
S0179	oh right
S0026	so if i go on my profile and history and then like select an exercise so that's bench press and you can you can kind of it's a bite slow on normally you can like expand this thing i don't know how you do it on this but anyway normally you can drag that wider and see what you've do and you can sort of like see all your history of like what you lift when and stuff very cool
S0179	ah
S0120	mm
S0179	um
S0120	that's quite an amuse
S0179	mm incidentally um
S0026	do you like that
S0120	mm
S0026	it just randomly come to me some time i be like that would be a good username
S0179	what be it
S0120	probably an actual word
S0026	das rumpsteak that's probably what the germans call a rump steak yeah it wouldn't surprise me
S0120	mm
S0026	so like i look back at what i do this week and i've get like football and then what i do then and if i wanna enter what i do today i just
S0179	you see i've get one like this with the with the card um it sort of sign you up to one but i it you you enter your schedule for the week and then it send you e mail reminders to do the exercise
S0026	mm
S0179	which be quite weird i dunno i'm not totally on board with that huh
S0120	mm
S0026	oh dear it's slow no that's not right but anyway it's er okay
S0179	mm i should point out this be the internet not the ipad um
S0026	yeah no i i understand that
S0120	mm
S0179	um anyway yes er bleurgh
S0026	yeah that
S0179	so how do you get an invite
S0026	um i'm not er someone i know who be already on it invite me but i'm not sure i can probably try and invite you if you want though i just think it's like er quite just quite a convenient way
S0120	mm
S0026	of track stuff really
S0179	ooh huh
S0120	mm
S0179	so there's only basically
S0120	it's er
S0179	two number i need to keep track of well three maybe which be er which be treadmill endurance time um run time and swim um twelve hundred metres time so it's fairly easy to keep um those in your head uh huh
S0026	but it's good if er if you do like weight and stuff cos it's just nice to see a history of it
S0120	mm when you've get a number a vary number of things to track
S0026	yeah cos i use to just i track it on an app that i have on my phone which be quite good as well but this be nice cos you can show off to other people how much you're do as well
S0120	mm
S0026	although i only know one other person that use it but it's
S0120	mm in one and a half weeks i've get a lovely two k test to look forward to yay
S0026	two k test
S0120	yep
S0026	as in a
S0120	yep
S0026	or something
S0120	um that one be just um an initial one so that you've get so that they dish out target for the next test which four weeks after that um twenty first of april i'm gonna be do oxford town bump
S0026	really
S0179	er
S0120	they do them all in one day they compete in fours
S0026	right
S0120	and anyone can join can join you don't just have to be in the oxford area

S0120	so we're gonna enter i mean we're gonna have i mean we've get an m1 and m2 we we can have four crew we can have four fours
S0026	mm

S0179	i plan on get up about seven
S0026	that's quite early so
S0179	it's quarter past eleven
S0120	in my experience of your get up at the weekend time when you say you want to get up at seven you generally get up twelve
S0026	oh yeah we've gotta get
S0179	yes the difference be we actually do have to go somewhere
S0026	we have to go we have to go and get me a gym
S0026	induction at nine and it's a very strange situation
S0120	what
S0026	me and go to the gym tonight
S0120	oh
S0026	in order to get me into the gym er we have to agree that i be gonna go for a induction tomorrow
S0026	to cover the back of the lady who very nicely let me let me use the gym tonight without an induction so hopefully it'll be like five or ten minutes but i'm never gonna use the gym again it's
S0120	i think we be leave
S0026	yeah i think we be leave earlier as well
S0120	i think we be leave at seven thirty
S0179	that be the
S0026	yeah i think we be as well
S0179	original idea um
