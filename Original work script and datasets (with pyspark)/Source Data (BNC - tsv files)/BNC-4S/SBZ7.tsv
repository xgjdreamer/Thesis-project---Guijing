S0544	i don't know
S0564	i know want to go to a city
S0544	city
S0564	or something don't you
S0543	i want to go travel for a bite we be think of erm
S0544	yeah we wanna travel for a bite
S0543	i don't know if you still wanna do it but erm
S0544	definitely
S0543	after we graduate i be think of do this be me erm after graduation over the summer do like er maybe like a six week internship or something even if like that's just a little experience i get before i do anything else but
S0564	mm
S0543	think of do that like a pay internship over the summer and then after that i'm think of go travel and then after travel i'm gonna decide whether or not i wanna go into job or whether i wanna do further study and i haven't decide what i wanna do whether i wanna do one or the other of those but i'm think of because i wanna earn money for this record thing over summer and then i'm gonna try and after that save up from then cos i'm think if i'm positive it'll persuade me more to save even more
S0564	mm mm
S0543	for after graduation
S0564	mm
S0543	erm and even if like i'm just gonna see how much er i save and then see what i can do with that money
S0564	mm
S0543	erm travel wise and then i'm we're gonna ask people that we live with our friends at uni if they wanna come with us like like a big group travel thing
S0564	safer
S0543	exactly yeah there's that and also it'd be more fun to share it with load of people to be honest erm
S0564	mm
S0543	er but yeah and then see how what like what we do with that and then i'll decide what i wanna do afterwards
S0564	mm internship in what
S0543	i don't know
S0543	erm anything linguistics wise really i don't i wouldn't i don't really have a preference erm the thing that do interest me you know do that erm where she do transcribe for people i don't think
