S0251	there's not too much write about it yet because it's so new isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	so it's a bite difficult to find article and information about it
S0368	mm mm
S0252	academic trail
S0368	mm absolutely but they're on sale now be they
S0251	yeah yeah
S0368	be they on sale now these watch
S0252	erm yes
S0368	mm yeah
S0252	they're about four hundred pound
S0368	be they mm
S0251	be that the cheapest
S0252	yes the most expensive be about ten thousand pound for a
S0251	ooh
S0368	oh gold one mm
S0251	i think it'll only be a fad
S0368	mm
S0252	i think the battery life be too short it only last one day
S0368	one day
S0252	yes and then you've get to recharge it at the the mains point
S0369	what's that then
S0252	the iwatch
S0368	the apple iwatch
S0369	oh yeah
S0368	the battery last one day before it need renew er recharge
S0251	charge so you'll have to charge it up every night won't you
S0252	yes
S0251	i think people will get bore with that
S0368	mm
S0369	it do to charge things up er well the only thing that get charge up which be on permanent charge in the holder be my electric toothbrush
S0368	mm
S0369	but all else i've really get to er
S0369	mm mm
S0251	mm they're always flat when you pick them up aren't they
S0368	mm
S0252	i do have the strategy of have a charger in the car
S0368	oh yes
S0252	that's
S0369	in er it's like a lot of these things in theory they're pretty good
S0368	mm hm
S0369	in practice
S0251	too much mess about on them
S0369	yeah you've other things to do
S0251	out with
S0369	you want to you know
S0368	and you need really good eye sight to see it wouldn't you
S0252	yes
S0368	won't be any good of me
S0251	no mm hm
S0368	i can barely see the mobile
S0251	mm hm
S0368	not without my glass
S0251	no
S0369	no they're er i doubt the practicality really of them
S0251	mm i think it's just a novelty and a gimmick really
S0369	yes it be
S0251	but an expensive one
S0369	mm and then they're want people to buy them to pay for it
S0251	mm it's just for show off i think
S0368	mm
S0251	with lot of spare cash who don't know what to do with it
S0369	of course another thing it's get that as far as i can gather not that i know anything about it really but er it's get that many things on it er seventy percent will never be use
S0368	mm
S0251	i know
S0369	because you haven't the time or
S0251	learn to work it all and
S0369	or probably even the know how to do it
S0251	no
S0369	i mean some of the things i've get like my er kodak printer
S0368	mm sorry
S0369	thank you mother
S0369	er photo and scatter er you know i still haven't i do when i be here but you see since i've have my memory test er
S0368	you've use up all your power
S0369	i've do it look i do i spot them
S0251	oh yeah
S0369	on my old singer kodak
S0251	mm hm
S0368	mm hm
S0369	so you know that's er that's good i've i've two thirds there
S0251	yeah
S0369	but nevertheless er not like completely
S0252	mm
S0369	hey that's be a bloom smash isn't it really
S0251	yes haven't work out what the problem be yet with that aeroplane have they
S0369	no
S0252	no
S0369	no
S0251	should have just be routine cos it wasn't really that far be it
S0369	no no and yet they're sort of rule out er a terrorist
S0251	foul play
S0369	mm hm but
S0252	it could have be hijack rather that it be a a bomb
S0368	mm
S0369	but something's happen it and there be no er mayday call or mm anything
S0251	no they must have realise it be lose a lot of altitude
S0369	mm
S0251	say it go from about thirty eight to about eight thousand
S0252	mm in eight minutes mm
S0251	everybody will have felt that we're go down we're go down we're go down you can feel it as it start descend can't you
S0368	mm mm fall you know yeah
S0251	yeah you're lose height but
S0369	well it's a joint er between britain germany and france be that airbus isn't it
S0252	erm yes well a lot of the part be make in those three countries and they be assemble in toulouse
S0369	in where
S0251	toulouse
S0369	toulouse in france yeah and i should imagine i don't know but we'd have make the roll royce engines
S0252	yes
S0251	quite likely
S0252	not all of them be roll royce some of them be general electric
S0369	some have
S0252	be general electric
S0369	oh be they
S0252	yes
S0369	american
S0252	yes
S0368	but what we that particular one be that a roll royce
S0252	i would say for the airbus air three twenty the general electric tend to be more popular
S0369	mm
S0252	because it have a lower fuel consumption than the roll royce
S0368	oh right
S0252	the roll royce tend to do best on the long range aircraft
S0369	mm
S0251	i'd have say something if we be lose that altitude that quickly
S0368	well well i'd have say that more than that
S0252	well be another thing be
S0251	you'd be scream wouldn't you
S0252	they be wonder whether
S0368	it'd be terrify absolutely terrify
S0252	they'd lose oxygen and the crew be unconscious
S0251	oh right oh
S0369	well it's funny you mention that because there have be er an enquiry go on and that of a pilot who pass out
S0252	mm yes
S0369	with the air be recirculated er and and it's sort of recirculated er through the engines
S0251	oh right so you're get poisonous fume in
S0369	well er along those line say enough for him to pass out and the copilot have to take over
S0251	good job he be alright he could have be the same
S0369	mm i mean you can't open a window or anything there cos they're all pressurise you see
S0251	i want a bite of fresh air
S0369	yes mm
S0368	shoot of
S0369	they could have put er oxygen mask on
S0251	yeah i be go to say they might have some tank of oxygen canisters
S0369	mm but er in a way there's not enough er what i hear this morning on the news and on the telly be the er not enough place for a helicopter to land the rescuers and investigators who have go down so far have go down on rope cos there's nowhere for the helicopter to land properly
S0251	oh so they won't be able to take any equipment really or cut equipment and
S0369	that's the sort of terrain no but they have get er er one of the black box although it's damage the black box be orange by the way
S0251	right obviously
S0369	yeah but when
S0251	not
S0369	they get the other one it could take er some time to er
S0251	unravel it
S0369	yeah and then they will have more but there be you know the fact that i mean if they be in trouble and eight minutes go by there be no
S0251	scream
S0369	maydays mm
S0251	i'd let off a mayday
S0368	they'd hear you in the next country
S0368	yeah definitely
S0251	i think something's wrong
S0368	well it must absolutely a nightmare
S0252	it's also strange they lose contact with the air traffic control
S0368	mm
S0369	mind you once it get down you know in the alps there they could lose contact though couldn't they
S0251	you might lose your signal because of the mountain top
S0369	mm in the air mm
S0368	mm
S0251	yeah
S0369	at york
S0251	he's just go out for a walk apparently but he'll be back for his lunch
S0369	oh yeah er well where's his car then
S0251	well he'll have go to the start point maybe he's go to to walk round and he's take the car there and then
S0369	oh i see
S0251	perhaps that i don't know i wasn't inform so i don't have all the detail
S0252	i'm go into the university tomorrow afternoon
S0368	be you lad
S0252	just have a meet with one of my tutor
S0368	yeah
S0369	good
S0251	that's about the cv isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	think that's go quite well
S0252	it be
S0369	yes that's er quite an important part as well isn't it
S0251	it be i think you need to start early and keep chip it away and get feedback and do things extra to put on if you perceive any little gap that might need
S0368	mm
S0252	say that he think mine be erm nicely fill
S0251	build it up
S0252	with various interest things and that some people he have have do absolutely nothing extra
S0369	er two or three weeks ago we in our daily mail er we get like a a couple of piece which be of business a pull out thing like there's only two or three page on it you know and it be say about er how to be look at cvs which be and it be give some tip and i think yes that's a a good point they make er by say what you have to offer
S0368	yes
S0369	you know that type of thing and er which you would think would benefit er
S0251	that particular company
S0369	you know the the company or whatever
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	very often you be limit to erm
S0251	no space
S0252	it's get to be erm one back to back a4 sheet of paper
S0251	you can only do two side one back to back a4
S0369	mm hm
S0368	mm it's
S0369	what er size print
S0252	well it's a bite of a balance act it's
S0368	oh
S0252	require some very sort of clever organisation really you've get to make sure the margins be as wide as they can be so you can get as much material in
S0369	yes
S0251	mm
S0368	yeah
S0252	you don't want the type to be so small that you need your glass on to read it
S0368	that you don't
S0369	difficult yeah difficult to read
S0252	so but on the other hand you don't want it to be size eighteen that it take up too much space so it's just get to be somewhere in between really
S0251	too much space
S0368	mm yeah
S0252	i think fourteen be generally the recommend
S0368	be it yeah
S0251	font size
S0368	mm
S0252	and also things like sort of grade and result you might want to try and consider put them side to side so you don't waste any space have them down
S0368	mm just in a list yeah
S0252	yeah
S0251	in a list yeah
S0252	and there's just this area without anything on it
S0368	yeah mm oh it's an art form isn't it
S0252	it be so i sort of
S0368	yes
S0369	well it do it's trick of the trade really
S0252	i have to sort of sort out text box and that type of thing
S0368	mm
S0252	and also you don't want it to look as though you have use a text box so you've get to move the
S0251	the line yeah
S0252	the line
S0368	oh yeah
S0252	sometimes i do a little erm
S0251	like a grid isn't it
S0252	a grid to ensure it's perfectly in line and then obviously remove the grid line so
S0368	mm oh yes yes yeah
S0252	so it doesn't look as though you've be
S0369	yeah this be it it's er there's a way of go about it isn't there
S0252	there be
S0369	you've just get to hit on the correct formula really
S0252	mm
S0368	so when do you present that then
S0252	erm well it's basically just go through it with my tutor tomorrow and then when you apply for any internships or job then that's what you would send along with a cover letter
S0368	oh right yes i see
S0252	the cover letter would have to be more tailor to what you're apply for
S0368	yes i see
S0252	so it's a bite hard to do that in advance
S0368	mm yeah
S0251	just try to get forearm aren't you that's
S0368	mm yeah
S0252	there's be some placements they might might be open for two months or something the application period
S0368	mm
S0252	but if they start select after the first seven to ten days
S0368	mm
S0252	you've a better chance if you get it in the couple of first few days it's open rather than the day before it close
S0251	mm mm wait till the end mm
S0368	mm
S0251	yeah we have another good sale on ebay didn't we with some noddy cars
S0369	oh do you
S0252	yes mm yes
S0368	oh do you yeah yes

S0368	no no
S0251	i can't believe it

S0369	yeah i think it be two pound wasn't it
S0368	i i can't remember what it be now
S0369	yeah but it's not what we think it be be it but it be
S0368	i don't know i can't remember what it be now
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0369	i just might be wrong on this bite but it it be you know cos i'm just try to remember what be write there er it be something er original from nineteen twenty
S0368	mm
S0369	so you know it's a pretty old one
S0368	mm
S0369	but it's all there but there's not a lot there to be all there
S0368	no
S0369	er
S0368	it's a small box a smallish box
S0369	mm yeah
S0368	i can't remember what it be now
S0251	yes he do use those book actually
S0368	oh right
S0251	i think the same night that you bring them
S0368	oh yes
S0251	erm he have a question about how i think you have to give a critique of a certain thing what be good about it what be bad about it
S0368	mm
S0251	but we didn't really know what it be
S0368	oh right
S0251	so we couldn't say what be good or bad about it
S0368	no no
S0251	and then we find it in that book
S0368	oh really
S0369	what that grandma point out
S0251	mm yeah yeah
S0369	yeah
S0252	one thing about the university text that be give be it's not always very good in just sort of be very subtle and clear exactly what be good about it and what be bad about it and just generally what it be
S0369	mm
S0368	yeah
S0252	it go into a lot of detail and it can be quite hard to just
S0368	pick out what
S0252	find exactly what you're look for
S0251	i think it presuppose that you've get a lot of background already
S0369	yeah
S0251	and if you haven't
S0369	yeah
S0251	you don't know
S0368	you can't
S0369	but the thing be you can't have it all
S0251	understand the relevance
S0368	no
S0369	you can't have it all and so that's what reference book be for
S0368	mm just to tell you what it be in the first place
S0369	you know with mm
S0251	yeah
S0368	well that's good anyway isn't it
S0369	yeah that yeah
S0251	mm yeah yeah it's good
S0369	because they're only fifty p each
S0251	mm
S0369	mm we say well they're er
S0251	so they're really please
S0369	the paperbacks be fifty p all paperbacks be fifty p and er they're new really aren't they
S0368	yeah they're brand new
S0252	mm
S0369	that's i mean i i say
S0368	sound quite
S0369	oh yes i say we'll take them because if he doesn't want them we can always bring them back we won't chuck them sort of thing like but er er and they be not all that old be they
S0368	no
S0369	and these term and word you know pose in these question
S0368	mm
S0369	you know you probably don't understand the question for one word or something
S0251	yes
S0369	or whatever it be now when we watch a few quiz really don't we
S0251	mm
S0369	and very often we look at each other and i say well i don't understand the question
S0251	no
S0368	we we even watch university challenge
S0369	mm hm
S0368	and well i say well i don't understand the question and it's so convolute as well you know
S0251	yeah
S0369	mm
S0251	you forget the first bite
S0368	you you yeah
S0369	yeah can't even
S0368	yeah but we like it when we get one or two
S0251	oh yes especially if they don't
S0368	oh yes we yeah
S0251	fancy not know that that's disgraceful
S0368	yeah
S0369	yeah yeah mind you on the odd occasion we get one and we look with a know smile

S0368	no i don't the murder in the first place be horrify
S0251	mm
S0368	but not to know where she be
S0251	i know
S0368	that's that's
S0251	mm i think the implication be it might be more than one place as well
S0368	mm
S0369	mm
S0251	they might not never know i don't know
S0368	no and that's that's as you say you can hardly live with that can you

S0368	mm
S0251	terrible
S0369	that's how good it be
S0369	that's the other kind of the of the ladder and that you know
S0251	no but i can't start make some of the things
S0369	that's where it come form
S0251	you know i can start make some of the elements
S0369	but i haven't find a of it yet but it do pop up you know about name the angels
S0368	yeah
S0251	for next time you just put them in a box and them quicker
S0368	yeah and you can pick it up again
S0369	and that start to give the
S0251	yeah yeah yeah that's good
S0369	order of rank you know like in duke's marquis and their lord
S0368	because you you must use load of bits and piece
S0251	yes yeah
S0369	you know and that'll take a thing to give up your status actually where you sit at the table
S0368	little
S0251	yeah
S0368	do you get another erm
S0251	no i need one
S0369	the kind would be there
S0368	yeah
S0369	the next would be dukes
S0251	yeah just break through wear
S0368	mm you've have it quite a while haven't you
S0369	and the next would be the earls you know and it come down the table right down to right at the end be the lowest rank whoever they may be like mm
S0252	a hierarchy
S0369	but you know it would come out as you pick it out whereas we sort of be he back
S0251	no i think it's the
S0369	er there be a er bite on telly i don't know do you know i think that be a university question that
S0368	what
S0369	about this dutchman who er sort of discover the cure for beriberi
S0251	mm
S0369	which be a you know quite a serious er disease or
S0251	deficiency mm
S0369	infliction like er just by give them and i think it be it be some type of rice
S0251	oh yes
S0368	mm
S0251	i think be it if you have white rice you don't get all the nutrients but if you have brown rice you do
S0369	mm well there's the something like that
S0368	and there's a difference between the polish rice as well isn't there
S0369	but it cure this er beriberi
S0251	yeah
S0369	which in other word it be just a deficiency
S0251	yes and quite simple to solve once you know how or what
S0369	exactly so we start talk about it didn't we love
S0368	mm
S0369	and say er how we come to rickets
S0251	yes vitamin d
S0368	and where do we get our vitamin d from
S0251	mainly the sunshine
S0369	milk
S0251	if you can get it
S0369	milk
S0251	mm yes
S0369	be a be a strong one and in particularly in the north of england er west yorkshire and and lancashire and that rickets be commonplace
S0251	yeah
S0369	i mean when i make that joke er in 's do there like that be true
S0251	mm
S0369	we have five well four leeds blokes during the war you have to be in er what do they call it it be like a proper job shall i say
S0251	yes
S0369	and there be a an order
S0368	reserve occupation
S0369	mm
S0368	reserve occupation
S0369	er well it would be a reserve occupation yes but they'd have a and they there be an order and it be er it be the direction of labour order
S0368	mm
S0369	and these four from leeds be direct to east yorkshire water service at hull
S0251	mm
S0369	to work there because the the transport be more important
S0251	yeah
S0369	transport get people to the factories and to work and to brough and all that business you see and er they come and er two go to and two be at one of them be in our shop call there be all a small statue
S0251	mm
S0369	and they be all a bite bow legged
S0251	mm
S0369	and then just to cap it all er we get a new chief engineer
S0251	mm
S0369	er as time go on they never go back to leeds by the way they stay and er er they call him and he even speak right yorkshire
S0251	mm
S0369	you know lad and all that like and he be bow legged mm so right now then there's a a that be rickets
S0251	and beriberi
S0369	and that beriberi er there be mm
S0368	anaemia
S0369	er anaemic
S0251	mm
S0369	iron
S0251	short of iron yeah
S0369	yes so you look for your source of iron now my mother at time er use to eat nearly raw liver for iron
S0251	gosh
S0369	that be consider the now that take some do she hat it but she be really low on iron
S0251	wouldn't a bottle of guinness have pepped her up more
S0369	well she use to have that as well like mm but er you know that's that be that and er i flash up on this screen one time didn't i er on a thing and when they go into it it be say i be low on iron didn't they
S0368	mm
S0369	when they test my blood they say you're a bite low on iron it want to be point fifteen
S0251	mm mm
S0369	and i be about eight
S0251	mm
S0369	mm but er he say just eat meat
S0251	yeah
S0369	er and that's when i get that book with all these things in
S0251	yeah
S0369	and what be good on vitamins and all that
S0251	yeah
S0369	and it come out that funnily enough i you know you could hardly believe it one of the source which be really strong in iron be er watercress
S0251	mm oh yeah
S0252	and spinach
S0369	now who would think watercress
S0251	mm
S0369	but it say by all mean cultivate watercress not pick out of the stream
S0368	no
S0369	because that water
S0251	might not be
S0369	by now will be pollute
S0251	mm
S0369	it'll have because er you could say sixty five seventy percent of the complaints of people be waterborne
S0251	mm
S0369	you know from the water
S0251	yeah
S0369	somewhere along the line it might even just be swim bath
S0251	yeah
S0369	you know stuff like that
S0251	horrible
S0369	er so suppose to be so healthy
S0251	mm
S0369	and so innocent and yet you come out and you've get er verruca's
S0251	yeah athlete's foot
S0369	you know oh dear oh dear
S0368	mm mm
S0369	you know that that just a start
S0251	mm
S0369	but er er so that iron be another and that be for er anaemia anaemic
S0368	and diabetes
S0369	mm
S0368	diabetes
S0369	diabetes what would that be
S0368	no i don't know
S0369	no but but we've get about six things
S0251	mm
S0369	which be just like vitamins in your ordinary food
S0251	yes
S0368	mm
S0369	er which we don't really in our normal day to day life don't attribute
S0251	much importance
S0369	importance to them
S0251	mm
S0369	and you can still go yeah there be another one i'm surprise you haven't tell me about it scurvy a very serious complaint
S0251	oh yes mm
S0369	er particularly er for seamen
S0251	mm
S0369	cos you see when they go on these voyage these long voyage i mean you're talk about er maybe four months to get to australia
S0251	mm yeah
S0369	and they use to take with them on board er er like cage with chickens in for egg
S0368	yes
S0369	er they'd they'd take pig with them and a goat
S0251	mm yes
S0369	and fee it what they could
S0251	yes
S0369	but careful like you know
S0251	mm
S0369	to give them
S0251	mm
S0369	er and when they use to go to some of these islands they would go back and put er a couple of pig obviously male and female on to this island
S0251	yes yes
S0369	and chart it
S0251	mm
S0369	so when they come back they'd go hunt
S0251	yes and try and catch
S0369	there'd probably be thirty or forty pig run around now and that's where they get the the er
S0251	mm more supply
S0369	yes this be it because there's a lot on there's nothing waste on a pig and i bet they didn't
S0251	no
S0369	so scurvy and that be the lime for a start and that's why the aussie's call us limeys from the lime because it be from
S0251	mm it's pay off
S0369	the vitamin c
S0251	mm
S0369	er and that that's another you know just things like that er another one and i be always tell to have this i think it's suppose to have about six a day be bananas
S0251	oh yeah oh yeah that's reasonable isn't it
S0368	mm what be that for
S0369	do you remember that
S0368	yes
S0369	and it's
S0251	be that potassium
S0369	mm
S0251	be it potassium
S0369	er
S0368	yes
S0369	yeah it be
S0368	potassium
S0369	it's yes but it's something with begin with f really
S0368	maybe that's potassium the way you spell it
S0369	yeah
S0369	cos i laugh i say good grief you're go to be swing from the chandeliers
S0251	mm
S0369	soon if you're have er six or seven bananas a day
S0251	well it's not practical be it
S0369	mm
S0251	if you have one a day
S0368	yeah
S0251	you'd get tire
S0369	oh sometimes they take some
S0368	but they take some digest though
S0369	digest don't they
S0251	they're just not quite ripe or something
S0368	well it always amaze me when we see them eat banana in between er
S0369	at tennis
S0251	oh yeah
S0368	a tennis match i think
S0369	they go sit down and pull a great banana out stuff that in and it's
S0251	yeah quite difficult to digest aren't they
S0368	mm mm
S0369	it's a word almost like forensic or something
S0251	ferric do you mean
S0369	mm
S0251	ferric like
S0369	no not ferric no i think er mother or new mother need this
S0251	folic acid
S0368	oh folic folic
S0369	er i think it be folic acid yes yes that's it and they're really rich in that and that's what that's it what he be short of folic acid be our
S0251	oh right oh
S0369	so there's another one just from a banana now then during the war er oranges
S0251	mm
S0369	and bananas well bananas and they use to put radio message out er for like on the bbc to take er there's somebody in say sheffield hospital be er really in need of er of bananas so now then you think well where be they get the bananas from
S0368	why
S0369	they would er ship like navy ship in particular
S0251	yes
S0369	call in at the west indies would get bananas on board
S0251	mm yeah
S0369	and they'd bring them back for their families
S0251	hand them out yeah
S0369	so if yeah you know it's er and they say you know would you send them
S0251	mm
S0369	to this hospital because they need it like that and that's how things be short and that's how it go on and and then oranges do come on didn't they
S0368	mm
S0369	and they be ration weren't they
S0368	yes
S0369	mm and er and that type of thing now then when the americans come they bring a lot of stuff on their ship
