S0012	bear i couldn't i couldn't clean between his legs i have use the scrub brush
S0024	they leave that afternoon so this be in
S0013	what happen when you have no idea of what people be talk about
S0024	who
S0013	when you're transcribe
S0012	we've still get that on then
S0024	if you haven't get if you don't get the context
S0013	yes
S0024	you have to listen to it through all the way through don't you
S0144	mm
S0024	to get the general idea cos some word you just can't know
S0144	you couldn't write it down could you
S0024	no
S0144	but you'd be able to write it down
S0024	you'd type it and try and figure it out somehow em but some word like i've be write these word and until you get the context of the whole situation you hear you can hear something completely different
S0144	yeah
S0024	you because your half of hear be do in your brain isn't it
S0013	yeah
S0024	so you catch little bits and then you type
S0144	yeah
S0024	i've forget some of the examples now i don't know and then you
S0144	you can hear whole sentence it's weird and when you listen to it again
S0024	yes you listen to it again and after you know what they're say next
S0013	right
S0024	and then you go how on earth do i think that they and you've write a whole different sentence
S0144	that be weird
S0024	i mean you can tell maybe they'd sound similar not not that similar to be able to do it it's hard isn't it but that's because they're you know a lot of hear be so you have to listen to it again i suppose until you get the context until you understand everything that's go on but there's quite a few business word that i don't know tom like the word for eh the word for meet i try to look it up on the internet and i just can't find it some sort of meet i say be it a board meet no it's not a board meet it's this so and so meet it's just i have i look it up but like with the letter that i think be the word and like there's lot of people say the same why be they not spell it right can't figure it out
S0144	oh you'll find out what it be
S0024	what
S0144	em
S0024	i'll tell you the letter in a little bite
S0012	there you go dry all the
S0024	what do you think they might have write about it before or what your business class say
S0012	anything else
S0024	that's it where have my glass go
S0013	i put it there in the wash up here you go
S0024	but i only just get it out just before dinner
S0013	well it doesn't matter now
