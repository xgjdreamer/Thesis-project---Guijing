S0370	yeah but not the same as napoleon do
S0278	not the same as napoleon no

S0012	that's right they do yeah
S0370	it's absolutely fine you know you can have a mistress and that's why a lot of them get themselves in to trouble still but still the french concept be it's it's okay

S0278	you can't get them in sainsbury's i like sainsbury's now the stuff be be nice
S0370	overprice lidl
S0013	they be overprice
S0278	no it's not if you're there at eight o'clock in the morning as you're go round they put out they put out all the stuff they want to reduce and they're mix in with everything else they don't put it separate
S0370	oh right
S0278	and so if you're the first you know it's the early bird who'll the worm
S0370	oh i see but cos the lidl's stuff's probably cheaper than their old
S0012	yeah
S0370	stuff no seriously lidl vegetables be really be really good
S0278	they be yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	tesco's vegetables
S0278	morrisons don't seem to last
S0012	tesco's vegetables
S0278	oh i think they're awful yeah
S0013	i've get no complaints about morrisons
S0370	but tesco's terrible shock
S0012	we like morrisons don't we
S0370	yes
S0278	they i i i think where tesco's have go wrong be they they become too big
S0013	yeah
S0278	management have become slack
S0012	yeah
S0278	and they're use to have a job now which be not hugely demand
S0012	yeah
S0278	cos it wasn't and they swan around do nothing the the when you go to a tesco's store there be always too many people do nothing
S0012	yeah
S0370	you know and you go to pay for something and there be two people there in the tesco garage on the way to i go to the tesco's in watford to fill up with petrol two people there that be supposedly serve plenty of people fill their cars up outside only one person be take the money so there be a queue and the other one be count up the money in the till well i'm sorry if there be customers
S0013	yeah
S0370	you put that to the side you serve the customers and then you carry on when it's quiet you know and she just ignore us
S0013	that's not what they do
S0370	and i think that be just typical tesco
S0012	mm yeah
S0370	you know you go to you do the you're own scan and you go to check out and you need somebody to okay that you're over eighteen for your bottle of wine right erm
S0012	yeah
S0370	you would think they could scan you wouldn't you
S0012	you would wouldn't you
S0370	and make a rough guess but anyway so you're wait for that the red light's flash right and these other people be stand around tesco staff be stand there do nothing
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	mm
S0370	while you wait for the one who be mean to be do who have probably go off to the loo or something and finally come back and start do something else and suddenly finally notice that you've get a red light flash
S0012	yeah
S0370	and deal with it to my mind if the red light's flash right they should be multi talk train you haven't get a customer over there at customer service you come straight over and say right be you
S0013	yeah
S0012	yes that's right
S0370	do that and go back
S0012	sometimes you have to wait age when that light's flash
S0370	yeah yeah and that that's that's that's wrong you see and they get that wrong all the way along
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's funny cos this morning
S0370	and it be that that they do wrong
S0278	yeah yeah
S0370	yeah a lot of staff
S0012	this morning on
S0370	i'm i haven't finish yet

S0012	oh wow
S0370	so i get my bike at half price and tax free
S0013	yeah
S0278	mm mm
S0013	that's what and didn't they they get their bike
S0012	yes they do yeah yeah
S0370	yeah
S0012	it's a good idea
S0013	they just take off so much per week anyway didn't they
S0012	yeah in
S0013	out of their wag
S0012	you can pick up a bike ride it to where you want leave it there somebody else will come along and pick up the bike ride it where you wanna go leave it there somebody else come along pick up the bike ride it leave it there you can leave your bike all
S0370	oh the white bike scheme
S0013	mm yeah
S0370	yeah they do that in oxford as well but the people start nick them by the lorry load
S0012	do they
S0370	well they turn up at night and just load them on the lorry and drive off
S0012	do they oh god
S0013	mm
S0370	you see which be a shame cos that's a nice way of do it
S0012	yes it be
S0013	it be lovely yeah
S0012	yeah well they still they still
S0013	well usually they're so old look aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah but they've out to eastern europe or something so
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm yeah
S0370	they wouldn't have be sell in this country
S0013	no
S0370	they all africa
S0278	they send they send a load out to erm gambia once cos the kid walk about sort of four miles to school and four miles back
S0370	that's right yeah yeah
S0278	so they give them to kid but when they leave the school they have to hand them in they be for kid to use at the school
S0012	they give them puncture outfit
S0370	school school now give every single pupil a erm a samsung equivalent to a er a a chromebook
S0012	yeah
S0370	every pupil get one
S0012	samsung help with that
S0370	right they pay a deposit and they have to return it when they leave right
S0278	mm
S0013	yeah
S0370	alright the thing be they buy them in bulk you you can get them now for probably forty forty pound i should think
S0012	yeah yeah
S0370	if you buy in bulk yeah erm and what's brilliant about it they've all get a chrome book right so they can all log onto google drive
S0012	mm
S0370	yeah as an educational establishment if you join google drive right you have limitless storage
S0012	wow
S0370	okay and all your pupils you can set them up with a gmail account in advance and you can do that on the you can't do that unless you you've enrol
S0012	no
S0370	it doesn't cost anything
S0012	no
S0370	right all google want be to people to be think google
S0012	yeah
S0370	there's nothing else in it for them
S0012	no
S0370	no advertise on it at all so when they log on to google drive you don't have to have any there's no software on a chromebook you see cos you go in the cloud and you use the word processor and the excel well not excel but the spreadsheet the presentation software that's on google drive so it's all in the cloud right
S0278	yeah
S0370	erm all their they have access to folders cos if you if you set up google drive you can give different people access to different folders to see different folders of yours you can share the access with them so those who be on the geography gcse course the head of geography share or somebody on the behalf of them share all the folders that they need for their geography work so the read material the assignments the homework it's all there
S0012	wow
S0278	clever innit
S0370	right so you don't need to hand out you don't need to print off homework sheet
S0278	yeah
S0370	so all that photocopy during the year you don't have to do assignments be hand in online
S0013	yeah
S0370	you don't have it's absolutely superb yeah
S0013	brilliant absolutely brilliant
S0278	but how do you know the person who's get that book be actually the the lad that's suppose to be do the work to hand in the assignment could he
S0370	you don't no
S0278	could he give it to his brother to do all the work and then put
S0370	yes but they can do you can do that anyway once you word process it at home and print it out what's the difference
S0013	yeah
S0278	homework
S0370	there's no difference
S0012	homework
S0013	yeah
S0012	you get homework from the teacher
S0370	you know do you have sample of their handwrite when you're mark to check it's their hand write no
S0013	yeah
S0278	but you you get to know a lot of people's handwrite
S0370	precisely so that's all you need so if the work clearly be way above their ability
S0278	then i suppose how
S0013	yeah you have to question it
S0370	and lot of school and colleges they use what's call turn it in which will scan will scan a piece of work and say whether it's all be write by the same person
S0278	oh i see right
S0370	right well it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't but it it's reasonably reliable at pick out passages that have be copy off the internet
S0278	didn't they they do that for the end of of uni don't they i think
S0370	yeah unis use turn it in as well yeah yeah
S0278	so they so they know you haven't pinch it all off the internet
S0013	mm
S0370	that's right unless you pinch it all off the same place on the internet
S0012	yeah
S0278	the only only thing i'd brilliant idea and the thing be be we gonna end up with a whole load of kid who who won't be able to write
S0012	this be a problem
S0370	well the question be do you need to
S0278	won't be able to work to that well you yes you do if the whole lot go completely tits up and pack in
S0370	well how can it
S0278	if there's a big war and infrastructure get zap then it'll all pack up i doubt if it's work in the ukraine at the minute
S0012	plus
S0370	the ukraine i mean you can you're your computer you at a guess they could easily design computers that run off battery actually well they do don't they laptops sorry
S0278	but you need power to charge them
S0370	huh
S0278	you need power to charge them if if you so what do you do
S0370	yeah
S0012	but there's also
S0370	generator generator
S0012	there's also a grow sun spot
S0278	no fuel
S0370	what
S0278	no fuel
S0370	well in that case you're kaput anyway you know forget about that
S0278	but if you
S0013	yeah
S0370	you know if if so if you're down to the level where you've get no electricity no fuel nothing
S0278	mm
S0370	well everything's go
S0013	yeah
S0370	you know forget about technology your food process won't take place nothing will happen your food won't be able to be package nothing will work
S0278	well that's true but but but it's get you at the minute we could go back to basics couldn't we the real basics we've still get cash we can still write you know we we we could go right back to basics couldn't we
S0370	yeah
S0278	and we we we know how to cook we know how to forage we know the things we
S0370	sorry no gas i think you say no fuel
S0278	no no we wood
S0013	no yeah
S0278	wood
S0370	yeah but
S0278	pot outside
S0370	yeah but
S0013	it would be difficult but
S0278	it would be difficult but we could cope and we could cope and we could keep warm and we could survive but when you get everybody rely completely on the technology and it can't be do without it
S0013	i still think
S0278	then
S0370	they could still go out in the wood and chop some wood
S0013	still most most people would
S0370	you'd do the basics you'd just forget about the rest but the rest will go anyway you know but i mean everything will go if you've get no fuel nobody be go to be deliver food to the shop
S0278	no
S0370	there'll be no food move around
S0012	no
S0370	you'd have to go forage for yourself so
S0278	can you imagine what it be like say i know we talk about this about the fuel about er electricity the network feed in but if it all go if london lose its power completely erm for for say a week because of some disaster something get flood or you know erm i don't know what would happen say the thames go into the flood into the underground system well i mean it's up above it anyway isn't it
S0370	mm
S0278	and if that get into it and then the whole all the electrics go and and it
S0370	mm well the underground have get their own electricity
S0278	i know but but once it's flood then you can't you've get to unflood it to get it go again haven't you and then and then that would probably knock out other bits so
S0370	no it won't cos it's their own
S0278	oh okay well
S0013	yeah but if everything do go
S0278	if everything do go in the whole of london
S0370	yeah yeah
S0278	erm there's no power at all in the whole of london
S0278	mm
S0278	absolute chaos wouldn't that be
S0013	it would be
S0370	it would be yeah yeah
S0278	cos everything would stop nothing would be able to work cos it have to be everything
S0012	there's one of the thing that can wipe out just about every computer in the world and that's the sun
S0278	well there's the what be it they teach us in the army there's electromagnetic force
S0012	there's sun spot
S0278	emf yeah which come from the sun
S0012	sun spot which come from the sun and they
S0278	yeah
S0012	they they can they can wipe out all the satellite the whole lot of them
S0278	mm well they could do the satellite but they they do all the main computers be protect they're inside a screen so the emf can't get in
S0012	yeah but you wouldn't you wouldn't get the cloud anymore you wouldn't get all the because that'll work from the satellite
S0370	no it doesn't the cloud be nothing i think that
S0012	do you
S0370	the word no they're not
S0278	it's not no they're not
S0370	they're all on the grind
S0278	mm
S0012	oh right
S0278	a lot of the the the
S0012	nevertheless that would wipe out a lot of
S0370	i that's exactly what i think they say in the cloud i assume it be a satellite
S0012	yes
S0370	and it's not no in actual fact they tend to be in the cold areas of of of the world
S0013	oh right
S0370	right near the pole so that they don't have to cool them
S0012	have you see google's
S0013	oh
S0278	it's not one there's lot of them lot of them all work together yeah
S0370	oh there's load of them all over the place
S0012	have you see google google's stuff that they get their their their er what do you call them er hard drive things they're bigger than several football pitch put together
S0278	right
S0012	and the heat that's why the keep them up there up there the heat be so intense come off they have to keep them
S0278	that's why
S0012	cool
S0278	the the pole be be melt
S0012	be melt
S0370	it's the hard drive google's hard drive
S0278	yes
S0278	yes it be i it kind of i i do we we're get right away from the way we be mean to be
S0370	i don't think i don't think it i think the we're we're in the technology age aren't we
S0278	yes we be
S0370	okay
S0278	but we've be in both
S0370	the computer age but when the industrial age start i bet people say
S0278	it's exactly the same thing
S0012	they have riot
S0370	you know we use to have potter and weavers and so on it's all now do in a factory what happen if the factory shut down nobody be gonna have any shoe or any pot or any clothe
S0278	mm mm
S0370	exactly the same thing
S0012	yeah oh
S0278	now what be it i i read just yesterday the guy that invent the world wide web
S0012	yeah he's english
S0278	he's he's worry about he's worry about some of the erm
S0012	or british
S0278	of the way the way it's go and i can't remember what it be it be it be yesterday i read it
S0370	oh right
S0278	i read it on the bbc news on the internet and he's he's worry about the way one particular area be go
S0012	he actually give it to the world
S0278	mm
S0013	social
S0278	maybe it be to do with erm these television these samsung televisions that actually could listen in to your conversation
S0012	oh isn't that terrible
S0013	yeah
S0278	yeah but but how do we know there's not load more things like that
S0370	they could well
S0278	how do we know they're not listen in on the cloud to what's go on here there and everywhere
S0012	well they probably do
S0370	they do
S0012	yeah
S0370	every single mobile call be record
S0278	oh and yeah yeah
S0012	and every single email can be read by the ghq in england or in america
S0278	mm well that's fair enough cos if you're not up to mischief then you you shouldn't have any worry about it but i dunno
S0013	we think a long time ago that television
S0370	they they don't seem to do it very well do they cos but the the i i i think quite often the the the secret service or whoever it be you know they do this little bite of publicity about you know well in actual fact you know there be thirty five terrorist risk that be you know prevent because of our work and i think oh yeah that's what you say you just to make that you're still get the for sit around nothing
S0012	well yeah and what they do be look for key word
S0370	around yeah
S0012	key word if they look at we we have a programme well we've probably tell you about this we have a programme on our first ibm computer right and we could talk and it be voice recognition and everything and we talk into it didn't we
S0370	mm
S0013	we talk into it and it print out
S0012	and then it print out what we say
S0370	yeah
S0012	well accord to what we'd say we'd say that reagan and margaret thatcher be get ready for a world war and that be all on
S0013	and we and we be only
S0012	and we be only talk like what you and i be talk now
S0013	yeah and then we think we'd read out of a book like jack and the beanstalk
S0012	yeah jack and the beanstalk
S0013	and it be the same kind of thing
S0012	and it come out the same thing
S0370	well there we be
S0013	mm
S0012	and this be an ibm computer so you know nowadays we'd have have the fbi round here with gun and what have you because they'd think we'd have say something wrong yeah
S0013	obviously it's more sophisticate now
S0012	well that be more sophisticate now but it weren't then be it
S0013	you can ask them question can't you
S0012	but don't it make you wonder what's go to happen in twenty thirty years time

S0013	yeah
S0278	oh there be there be a good reason for that it's alright
S0012	ah
S0278	he's fantastic he's very good and this time when i go down and take back i'm go to the dentist so it doesn't cost
S0012	yeah

S0012	no you don't no
S0013	the clean cos i don't like it anyway cos it hurt my teeth for about three weeks and erm i tell her i didn't want it again she say well you really should have so i agree cos it be a new dentist and it and it crack i've get a crack in my tooth now and and i now
S0278	yeah yeah yeah mine put a funny brush in the paste
S0012	yeah
S0278	he have a brush and he dip it in some paste and and he do it he's he's not he's not the hygienist it's not something they normally do they have a separate hygienist cos he know i come his parent live at so he know how far i come and erm and he always clean them for me as well
S0013	yeah well i don't
S0278	part of the inspection
S0013	i'm not go to have it er do again cos i i know they pick out all the little particles if there's anything there's gonna come out they pull it out
S0012	yeah
S0278	well you want it come out so that the
S0013	not really no
S0370	it be probably loose anyway
S0278	it would have come out eventually
S0013	well i don't full time
S0012	yes well you're you're fill fell out be that vibrate out
S0370	probably yeah
S0012	yeah and that's why they do it
S0013	yeah
S0013	get some work
S0012	let me see what we can find out what go wrong and maybe oh yeah it's gonna fall out eh here it come out come
S0278	to ask it's always embarrass when i go cos he's now get the nurse that i send the valentine card to all those years ago
S0013	be she still there
S0278	she's still there yeah but she's work her way up now she's his nurse they're a brilliant team
S0370	i've get a wisdom tooth come through
S0278	but it's kind of embarrass cos it's
S0012	now you will be wise
S0370	it's a bite sideways no all the others i've have this be my last one
S0278	oh right
S0370	cos you either get them early or you get them late don't you
S0278	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	that's why they give them
S0370	and it's it's a bite tight behind this molar at the back and it's come out a bite sideways
S0278	oh they might have to pull it
S0013	that's how mine be and they decide to move it remove it
S0012	oh you have to go to hospital didn't you
S0013	mm
S0278	you do for something like that
S0013	they want to save the back tooth and they have to remove the thing from inside it
S0278	oh that's unless they're a surgeon be be if they're if he's a surgeon if they're a surgeon they can do it in the practice
S0370	yeah mine mine do surgical yeah but he er he he he think it's alright at the moment
S0012	yeah but it's free free in hospital
S0370	oh right
S0012	there you go see
S0013	he say i have to go to hospital he say
S0012	he say you have to go to hospital so he do
S0278	well he so he might not have be a surgeon he might have be a dental practitioner
S0370	i'll tell you what he say on mine
S0013	they do put me out though
S0278	yeah they can do that
S0370	he give me a prescription for erm this colgate toothpaste that's higher in fluoride you can't buy it over the counter
S0278	oh right
S0370	you oh sorry no you can't buy it from a an ordinary chemist you have you can buy it from the dentist or you can get a prescription you get it from the chemist
S0278	yeah
S0370	er so because i'm over sixty he give me the prescription and erm what it do it people with softer teeth even when you're older it reduce the amount of work you have to have do cos you've get the fluoride
S0012	yeah
S0278	oh i'll ask him ask him about
S0013	i don't want to touch any to touch any fluoride
S0370	i can tell you the name of the stuff if you want you brush them at the end of when you go to bed and you don't rinse after your brush
S0278	mm mm okay
S0013	oh
S0370	you just spit
S0013	oh don't like that
S0370	because then it leave well it leave some of the fluoride there what it say be ideally you you don't want to rinse or wash your mouth out afterwards for thirty minutes that's why he say to me look just once a day before you go to bed when you brush your teeth and if you want you can brush it with the other toothpaste first and rinse out and then brush it with this and then spit but the fluoride remain in the gap you see where it's likely to be affect
S0013	you should really well and
S0370	and it build up the fluoride in that but
S0278	well that's good that sound good
S0013	i always rinse it really well but maybe you shouldn't
S0278	well if you want to find out about ask
S0370	oh yeah yes oh it's the same i'll bring the tube down yeah
S0278	she'll tell you about it i didn't realise then the other day i look at the macleans packet that's gsk as well so macleans aquafresh and sensodyne they're all gsk but i didn't know the macleans be

S0013	yeah you get it for fifty pence if you're
S0278	i get it

S0013	nice one
S0278	at at at our show two years ago there be colgate take a stand right in a prominent position
S0278	oh yeah that's not
S0370	this be five thousand you see part per minute
S0278	yeah yeah and you can see that's not a retail pack cos no one would be encourage to buy that the way it be
S0370	well the box be quite nice to isn't it
S0278	well
S0013	one gram contain five milligrams of fluoride
S0278	duraphat duraphat
S0013	correspond to five thousand
S0278	part per part per millilitre
S0013	be it
S0278	probably ppm
S0370	i think it's normally about a thousand in the normal toothpaste so it's five time but not little kid aren't mean to use it
S0278	no
S0013	no
S0370	erm
S0012	they won't
S0278	in the water it's in the water now
S0012	that's in the water yeah
S0370	i think if we'd have fluoride tablets when we be kid our teeth probably would have be much better
S0012	yeah
S0278	that's right we have awful teeth haven't we
S0370	yeah
S0013	well there's fluoride water in when we come to norwich so
S0012	yeah
S0013	week
S0278	well anyway
S0013	and buy tablets
S0278	when when colgate take a stand at the show they be all hand out colgate bag you know cloth bag with colgate write on it
S0012	yeah
S0278	with free colgate free toothbrush and all sort of bits and piece in the bag to everybody at the show and i get one i think ah i could and i forget about it long enough and then i take it down to her i say oh i have it as a christmas present i say and she open it up and say wow this have give me an idea she say so they'd never think of go to erm you know agricultural show or these sort of show and put a stand up with
S0012	yeah
S0278	she say i i can use this idea and she'd probably fee the idea as as come from her but colgate they be really clever cos the guy theyhad a photographer they have a photographer that be there er i i know what he be try to do he say i'm try to get some picture of this i'm i'm from the colgate so i'm try to get some picture nice picture of this the the guy jump over their erm they they have a articulate lorry they they jump over it with their bike and spin they let go of the bike completely over the top
S0012	oh yeah yeah
S0278	and come down the ramp the other end they be do that and he say can i go can i nip through and he must yeah go on and he nip around and take picture and the way he be take the picture be to get the guy fly and in the background be the colgate sign and
S0013	oh right
S0012	oh right
S0278	and so that be i don't know if he could use it without their permission but
S0370	no
S0278	but but if if you want if they want to set up a photoshoot with that go on you know it be the two of them fly be out together and both let go and they grab the bike and land it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm it it would cost a fortune wouldn't it
S0370	oh yeah
S0278	so maybe he'd take the picture and then say well can we use it and we'll pay you so and so probably probably that way round might work erm so anyway be we be we be we be you do woodwork now or have you
S0012	we be gonna go and play weren't we
S0370	yeah yeah can we just check to see if we can get that sleeve finish that order
S0012	yeah we can finish the order yeah

S0013	yeah
S0278	actually i couldn't do card for i could
S0013	yeah course you could
S0278	because they they're nice little christian card erm and and people would understand the way i've write it that it's a christian card
S0013	yeah mm
S0278	so i don't know i'm there's so many there's so many things i can do
S0013	yeah well you know we be plan
S0278	but i seem to get snow under with these ridiculous
S0013	we're plan an open studio
S0278	be you okay
S0013	erm summertime i don't know 's come up as well
S0278	right
S0013	and and bring her stuff
S0278	yes i know
S0013	you're gonna say something now
S0278	i'd have an yes i've be have an idea
S0013	yeah
S0278	who 's come up as well okay i can do that but also we erm because of something they find in the church at i'm not suppose to say too much about it but it it's it's of great importance apparently erm when we open the church we've get to man it now it's get to be man we can't open it and just leave it open
S0013	right yeah
S0278	erm so erm what one one of my thoughts be that when the heritage lottery go through and we get the tower do it's now gonna help get the tower do if we've get something really important in there can't let it fall down around that
S0013	yeah yeah
S0278	so erm be that when it's open we if we remove some of pews at the back we can have an area where people local craft could be sell
S0013	yeah
S0278	if we're gonna get more people come
S0013	yeah
S0278	i know you'll say that they're not gonna come but it they may well do when they know about this so
S0013	they might do but
S0278	but then we've get to have extra car park and everything down there as well
S0013	isn't it one of the little church that should be leave as as it be without remove pews and change things
S0278	no what i'm think be at the back if if say that's that's the we we never well these you can put them in if that's the church and there's the alter up there
S0013	right mm mm
S0278	now if when you come in the door where we stand when we have you know it's a good place for social as well
S0013	yeah
S0278	we never use to have pews in its people would stand
S0013	yeah yeah yeah
S0278	the font's there
S0013	yeah
S0278	all these old folk be stand around you know prop themselves up here there and everywhere round that
S0013	yeah
S0278	if one of the part of the plan be that the pew that's there you move that forward and that's get a high back and that'll give a little kitchenette area
S0013	yeah
S0278	there the loo's get to go in the tower that's important loos get to go in the tower
S0013	be there loos there now
S0278	no you go round the back of the church
S0013	yeah well i don't think there should be loos
S0278	you just wanna go and piddle round the back of the church do you
S0013	no
S0278	you can't invite people to come expect people to come and visit the church if there's no loos in the area
S0013	but there be in the in the hall isn't there
S0278	yeah but yes but in the winter there's the the another thing be
S0013	yeah but it's so historical type especially if they find something really unusual there
S0278	mm that's that's
S0013	they should they should keep the church as a historical build
S0278	cos then you take out all the pews cos the everyone use to just stand in it and the vicar use to park his horse in it and
S0013	oh
S0278	and it have a and it have a
S0013	yeah you're go to extremes now
S0278	no i'm not he use to park his horse and it have a it have a originally as it be it just have soil on the floor and people weren't bury in in in any casket and the smell be awful that's the history
S0013	that's the history
S0278	so you keep improve it everyone that's be there have improve every church evolve with the people church be for people
S0013	yes
S0278	we don't own the church the church belong to the village we just happen to be use it
S0013	well i know that yeah
S0278	and look after it erm but if that have erm that little kitchenette there so you can make cup of tea that's basically what it's for then there be a little area in front of that where you remove say two pews and you and put a table in the middle and people sit look at each other
S0013	mm
S0278	erm the area where people could sit and have their teas and coffees as well
S0013	yeah
S0278	but you could also and then i've see it do in my old church at where you've get the pews you just put a plank a wood across the end nice piece of wood and you put you sell the stuff across the end of the pews you see
S0013	no one use the hall and it's right next door
S0278	yes
S0013	no one use the hall do they on a sunday
S0278	no
S0013	so why can't they just move across to there and have a lovely get together with all the little table and they get the kitchen there
S0278	well
S0013	and the loos
S0278	i'll tell you why it can't happen
S0013	why
S0278	why it can't happen be because heritage lottery will not fund just to repair something they will only fund erm if it's go to benefit if what you do be go to benefit the community and people who visit
S0013	well
S0278	they won't repair the tower if we don't make an effort to make it better when people visit
S0013	mm
S0278	it's get to be free
S0013	okay
S0278	and one of the things that they suggest be to put in a loo and to have a little tea make corner
S0013	really
S0278	for people that visit so it's it make it so people will want to visit no one be gonna and improve the heat system people won't want to visit in the week
S0013	yeah it just it just seem a bite silly when right next door they've get all the cup and saucers and everything there
S0278	mm yeah yeah well imagine right you're you're there you've just come you've park your car in the snow you've go into the church which be warmer we've have the service
S0013	yeah right
S0278	and you want a cup of tea at the end of the service do you want to then
S0013	you've still get to leave haven't you
S0278	lock the church up walk walk through the snow to get to
S0013	no i don't think that's a problem
S0278	to the hall it's
S0013	the distance be not a problem
S0278	but if we didn't ask to do things like that they wouldn't repair the tower
S0013	right
S0278	that's the part that's the point
S0013	seem that seem rotten to me
S0278	well they won't repair the tower unless you make it accessible to everybody that build
S0013	yeah
S0278	so that's what
S0013	there must be a cos it's an it's a protect build isn't it
S0278	yeah they're all they're all
S0013	they're all erm
S0278	they're all grade yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	that's a grade two list
S0013	so you've get to be very careful how what you do
S0278	i know i know yeah so we don't can't can't spoil the fabric at all we won't be spoil the fabric
S0013	oh oh
S0278	look what we do at now when we haven't get the pews
S0013	i know
S0278	look what we can do there it's wonderful it's amaze
S0013	yeah
S0278	so many things and you just move the chair around
S0013	mm
S0278	the only pew the pews be the best that people could do
S0013	yeah i
S0278	after people be stand
S0013	i kind of agree that
S0278	you see
S0013	pews aren't the best
S0278	but there's twelve of us go every sunday and the all these pews be all empty about twelve
S0013	twelve at
S0278	yeah that's all and the twelve of us have get to sort out and get the tower repair
S0013	yeah right
S0278	so there's only about twelve of us go but if you can encourage people to come more people to come to the place they you they won't fund it unless you're improve it for people to come to it and part of it will be have erm a new path so you can get wheelchairs up there
S0013	yeah a new path that make sense yeah
S0278	chair up there a path possibly go across cut across which may be difficult cos it'll go across some grave but easier to get to the hall
S0013	mm
S0278	erm er i mean at the moment we have to get the water out the tap
S0013	yeah
S0278	the dog tap in in bottle and leave it in bottle in the tower
S0013	mm
S0278	and we've get tea make stuff in the tower which be just a urn that warm up you see but there's nowhere to sit cos you can't sit all face
S0013	but that's why i think why go to all that trouble when you have a purpose build build right next door
S0278	but it's no good in the winter if you've get the people go would you how would you like it alright you're live in here and your kitchen be over there outside
S0013	yeah yeah but it's a church service
S0278	if you
S0012	what's that what be you talk about
S0278	well well
S0013	when we're go to have erm
S0278	well when we have when we have the the folk group when we have the folk group we have the folk group
S0012	yeah
S0278	play
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm everyone have to go across and get their drink from the hall and carry it back now that be fine unless it's bung it with rain
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm you see it it it it you it's as if erm right you're invite people to one place and all the facilities be in the house next door that's what
S0013	i just don't think that's
S0278	it's like you wouldn't have a village here you have to go to the house next door to use the facilities would you
S0370	unless
S0013	yeah
S0278	that's what it be but they won't cos the main thing be they will not fund repair unless it improve the accessibility for everybody
S0013	mm
S0278	and that's disable access a loo be imperative erm you know poor old he have trouble in the cold
S0013	yeah
S0278	and he's tell there and he's have his coffee after a service and and he start go like this and like this and say be you alright no i need i need the toilet
S0013	mm
S0278	and so be do something else can you take take round the back please and i have to go slowly with right the way round the tower round to the back and he stand in the corner and widdles in the corner and i wait for him and then i fetch him back
S0013	yeah
S0278	cos he couldn't get he couldn't get to the hall
S0013	yeah mm
S0278	so i think it be important
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's not and it's not nice i mean i don't mind that i mean like i don't mind help out but see that sort of thing happen and ladies find it even more difficult
S0013	mm
S0278	i think erm well it and the other thing be that the church actually suit some events better than the hall you can get more people in it look in one direction
S0013	yeah
S0278	in the church than than the hall so it would be good if if there be anything and then they can work together that's not it's not there's not two separate things they can work together but the only way we can get the tower repair be to make it all work together that's the thing
S0013	yeah it's get to be do really well though
S0278	and they're even think about they're even think about try to sort out somewhere a field somewhere for a car park because there's always a problem when there's an event there
S0013	yeah
S0278	in the hall whether it be in the hall or the church
S0013	yeah
S0278	so there need to be a car park somewhere you know just erm gently just so it's not doesn't upset erm but i'm sure it we will get it sort
S0013	well they they have to don't they
S0278	yeah they have to
S0013	they have to do it
S0278	well i mean it doesn't matter to us because
S0013	it's a list build
S0278	yeah but we don't have to do it we can say go well okay i suppose ultimately if we can't get it repair we just go and worship in we could hire the hall for six pound an hour on a sunday morning no worry worship in the hall and let the tower fall down but that's not not really an option but that's you could say well okay well we'll worship in the hall
S0013	yeah
S0278	because we can't go in there cos the tower's fall down erm it doesn't matter where we be but it's it would be nice i mean if we can really get the whole thing all work together it would be brilliant
S0013	mm
S0278	it's a lovely spot that have you see what they've do right round the work they've put in
S0013	they think it be go to be up for sale when we first come here
S0278	mm what the hall
S0013	the church
S0278	the church do they
S0013	mm
S0278	oh cos there be nobody use it
S0013	yeah
S0278	ah
S0013	they think it might go up for sale
S0278	mm mm
S0013	like lot of church need lot of people lot of church be sell aren't there chapels and things
S0278	yeah but what i don't know what you could do that i'm sure i mean it would cost you that tower just repair the top bite of the tower be a be a hundred and twenty thousand pound
S0013	yeah
S0278	and that's without anything else
S0013	mm
S0278	without do the the path to it and
S0013	yeah
S0278	the road need do outside as well that maybe we could include that you see improve the road
S0013	yeah yeah
S0278	erm but it's a chance this be a chance
S0013	it do need do that's right
S0278	we've get a chance to improve that whole area down there
S0013	right
S0278	look how it it's churn up in the winter
S0013	so how much will they give
S0278	mm
S0013	how much will they give then
S0278	you can ask for what you want
S0013	oh i see
S0278	provide they think it's a good thing
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm but it's get to involve the community
S0013	mm
S0278	and improve it and improve all the access
S0013	which mean they've get to pay more than just for the tower anyway
S0278	and interest yes they will
S0013	get a lot more a lot more
S0278	they they they won't if you just say we just want the tower do they wouldn't do it cos you're not improve the place for accessibility it it's it's
S0013	right
S0278	it's not just the build they be interest in attract more people to see the beauty of the build
S0013	yeah mm mm
S0278	that's that's what they're try to get if it we couldn't have school visit if we didn't have a loo
S0013	yeah
S0278	things like that but erm
S0013	mm
S0278	it it's very interest and there's an awful lot but the other thing be that we're try to find i i don't can't take it on they want somebody to head it all up all this
S0013	to what
S0278	to head it up they want one person one person need to be in charge of all of this
S0013	yes yeah
S0278	one person but we're all get job every every one of us that go to that church do something
S0013	yeah
S0278	whether it be clean or or do the cater for it or clean the outside area and maintain it or do we all do something
S0013	mm yeah
S0278	and it's a full go to be a full when it start it'll be a full time job of somebody
S0013	yeah
S0278	and we haven't find that person yet i i you know keep look
S0013	could be you couldn't it
S0278	well it could be if i didn't have anything else to do
S0013	well shortly you never know do you
S0278	well i don't know but at the minute i'm still
S0013	yeah
S0278	i'm still commit
S0013	mm mm
S0278	and if i stop signwriting then know he doesn't get any sign for his church cos i'm the one that i put in the bid for i put in the all the stuff that's go in for permission to do it and about about a year down the line they might get the permission to do it
S0013	right
S0278	and if i'm not there then they get to start again
S0013	well you be still here though
S0278	no point be if i stop signwriting to take on this job
S0013	yeah yeah
S0278	mm
S0013	well it wouldn't be full full time you can still do a couple of sign in the even couldn't you
S0278	well i probably could yeah i probably could i
S0013	just the odd odd one or two
S0013	mm
S0278	i probably could yeah but it it's well
S0013	mm well you never know mm
S0278	i think i mean and we need a team as well you see and no one's volunteer for the team either we all do our bits and keep things as it be but it and erm
S0013	mm
S0278	i think see a lot of them they be retire a lot of them be retire but they they feel it's gonna be one i say to i think for me at the minute that would be one bite of straw too too much to take to take that on and i i'm not go to do it
S0013	yeah you can't take too much on
S0278	i don't think i could take on another one of something erm at the minute
S0013	no
S0278	but we'll see but the point be well i i'm think about this
S0013	yeah
S0278	be that when the church be it's gonna be open wednesdays wednesday afternoon from ten till start in april
S0013	yeah it be open we go we walk down that way last wednesday
S0278	it's always open one on a wednesday cos that's when the boys be there play they're they're do all the clear round lovely look right across the field it's lovely
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm and so there they be on a wednesday that's not a problem they're normally there on a wednesday just
S0013	mm
S0278	saturdays it's open ten till four as well now when it's open ten till four on saturdays possibly i have to say once a month bottom
S0013	mm
S0278	erm why don't we have local craft
S0013	yeah
S0278	for sale in there
S0013	mm
S0278	i mean they don't all have to be there if they come down and just set it up and you can do on the end of the pews you can put they do it at at they have a nice piece of timber with block underneath and it just lock in to the end of the pews so it can't fall
S0013	right okay
S0278	and you could put things on and if they're all price up then whoever be man you need two people man as well for safety apparently to man the place so that we would that would maybe
S0013	more craft yeah
S0278	if it do become famous i dunno we'll see i don't know maybe of no significant importance but i think it be
S0278	it be i think so
S0013	well they make enough er on their christmas craft didn't they in down the down the christmas fair thing
S0278	do they do alright
S0013	there be local craft weren't there they make a thousand pound well they take a thousand pound and it be seven hundred and fifty i think profit
S0278	oh wow really over all the what people take
S0013	mm yeah
S0278	that's good isn't it
S0013	that's good isn't it
S0278	it be yeah
S0013	cos it's very small
S0278	that be small yeah that's brilliant i do i wouldn't have think that you would they would have sell that much some of the things be
S0013	well apparently they do over a thousand pound worth
S0278	well that's good oh and they do teas and things like that as well didn't they and that's a good one
S0013	yeah they do mm
S0278	oh
S0013	then obviously you've get to take out some
S0278	mm
S0013	i mean some of the plant i think they're not all donate well only some of them be theirs cos they they've get to take the some money out
S0278	mm so you could do that
S0013	seven hundred and fifty quid
S0278	i could go down i could sit there could sit there and play the organ and i'd learn the organ at the same time
S0013	yeah
S0278	but the fact that's the other thing be i'm be if if if for instance down the back right where the font be just that's that's an no one ever sit at the back it's cold in that corner anyway so a little tea make bite just just it just need wash up bite and and and
S0013	yeah
S0278	doesn't even need a hole we just need electricity there just so that you can yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	that's all it need a little wash up area everything have to be part away from there they can all take someone take it home in a box and fetch it back
S0013	oh right
S0278	erm and then a little square area there so the two pews be leave turn one round so it's face that way and with the timber you could make a big long table just to go in between
S0013	mm mm
S0278	so they could sit there and have their cup of tea there yeah or erm you could just remove that bite and move that table i don't know the way you could probably find a way to collapse it probably and it would stand up in the tower out the way erm
S0013	mm
S0278	erm i be go to say something else about that have an area that what be i think erm oh yes yeah what i be think be that if we're keep it open and there's someone's get work to do they could bring their work down with them and do it there in the church
S0013	they can what
S0278	bring their work down and do it in the church i could
S0013	yeah
S0278	you see if i've get some work to do i could fetch it down and sit there at the table there do the work while i'm wait to look after the place for people to visit
S0013	oh i see yeah
S0278	you see what i mean you at the minute there's nowhere to sit and do anything
S0013	no no
S0278	so that little area could be if you want to get on with something
S0013	mm mm
S0278	well actually i could do one of the things i want to do be glass paint i want to get away from the chemical i want to paint it hand hand paint glass
S0013	yeah mm mm
S0278	erm i could do that there
S0013	yeah
S0278	you could do all that and just let it dry and take it back stick it in the oven
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm or calligraphy i i could do hand paint sign
S0013	well you can do lot of things can't you you're very you're very artistic
S0278	yeah and i or i can sit and play the organ or i could play music and play my which i've do before erm so i i'm happy
S0278	i'm happy to spend saturdays there but not every saturday look after the place but i could see can you can you see imagine a long each each pew have a put the board along
S0013	mm
S0278	with a nice drape over and card for whoever would work wouldn't it
