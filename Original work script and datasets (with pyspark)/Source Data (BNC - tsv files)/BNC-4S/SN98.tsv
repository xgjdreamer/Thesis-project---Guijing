S0230	yeah
S0192	sound like the place need more money doesn't it

S0230	care community you know a care place anymore it's run as a business
S0192	yeah
S0230	erm a money make business

S0230	and and it's not it shouldn't
S0198	no
S0192	no it's a service for old people that need help
S0230	mm
S0198	there should be nothing private about it it should be a public service that meet the requirements that you'd want for yourself but the people that run it be never go to be in a home like that be they
S0192	carers never get pay very well either do they
S0230	no
S0198	no

S0192	i think currently she's a bite in more of a managerial position locate somewhere with a with a bunch of people a community
S0230	mm
S0192	but still the pay's no good i think she's get more responsibility but no more pay and it's

S0192	what about your birthday
S0198	birthday i probably won't be at home that's my day no it's not really birthdays should sort of be for the parent they're the one that push you out
S0192	i'm gonna be really i've get three exams the week after new year
S0230	have you
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	but worry yeah it's like the first week in january
S0198	the modules he's choose be all like about break it down break down the language and he get
S0192	it's more scientific
S0198	he get these forty eight hour exam paper they take away but you only have forty eight hours
S0192	i've get three different modules with it and they're all gonna hit me on the first week of january so
S0198	i'll have i'm have my biggest assignments in n2 though we'll have some before christmas and then the biggest one be at the end and just after christmas typically
S0192	so i'm gonna be erm busy we're gonna be busy
S0198	yeah but there'll be time for christmas
S0192	hopefully so
S0198	there will be baileys in your coffee
S0192	yeah we'll just skim your birthday
S0230	so you'll you'll you'll be come home for christmas
S0198	oh yeah
S0230	what what be you do
S0192	erm as a joke i be gonna go to my 's instead of my mum
S0192	but she'd kill me so
S0230	oh you're go to mum
S0192	i've gotta go to my mum
S0198	technically it's his dad's turn
S0192	yeah it's my dad's turn
S0198	the last time we be in england for christmas you do spend it with your mum
S0192	when be that two thousand and six
S0198	that be quite a while ago
S0192	it's the last christmas i have with my parent i think obviously so
S0229	eight years ago
S0230	be that must have be yours as well then
S0198	because we no yeah two thousand and seven no it be two thousand and seven
S0192	be it seven
S0198	cos we go to amsterdam for new year
S0192	i'm sure the only christmas i do be the first year at uni
S0198	two thousand and six we be in paris two thousand and seven we go i go home and then
S0192	what i do i do i don't think i really go home
S0198	do you not go home
S0192	i don't think i do maybe for a day or two
S0198	and then we go to
S0192	after my parent split christmas just become a bite er
S0229	no
S0192	not a really big fan of it anymore probably go to my dad's on box day and my mum's on christmas day probably
S0198	mm but yeah two thousand and seven probably
S0192	not that long ago only seven years
S0198	cos two thousand and eight we be in
S0192	well hopefully the next few place we'll work we'll be a little bite closer so
S0230	mm
S0192	if we're go middle east we can get home for christmas we can do those kind of things that's why the middle east be probably
S0198	well it doesn't it depend on their work holiday
S0192	on the vacation yeah whether we get this time off
S0198	so if the country doesn't celebrate christmas the chance be
S0192	which they don't
S0198	we won't have them off
S0230	oh
S0192	if we go to the middle east then the weekend be a thursday friday
S0230	oh be it
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah saturday sunday you work that's like monday tuesday
S0198	they have different days of the week
S0230	oh
S0229	oh right
S0192	yeah so thursday friday be the weekend so bite strange
S0230	that be weird isn't it
S0198	i'm not sure why
S0230	oh
S0198	wednesday must be a significant end of something
S0230	perhaps it's their erm
S0198	i mean there's no reason saturday and sunday should be the weekend be there just cos our culture do it
S0192	we've just set it well saturday be the sabbath wasn't it
S0198	well some and sunday be the church day
S0192	and sunday be the day the sun
S0198	so they maybe they go to church on a thursday or friday
S0230	yeah perhaps perhaps their religion be sort of
S0198	yeah
S0230	different days for church yeah cos they're muslims aren't they
