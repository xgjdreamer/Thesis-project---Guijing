S0529	i don't even know if i'm allow to do it on this like cos i didn't wanna tell them that this
S0530	mm
S0529	but like i dunno whether in the seminar they be like talk about like this be kind of what you have to do for the essay or not i don't know
S0530	i mean do you know how to write your like erm
S0529	no
S0530	have you get like
S0529	i have no idea
S0530	the body of the essay
S0529	no not at all i er no not really
S0530	okay okay
S0529	i just don't know
S0530	don't worry we can fix this
S0529	mm
S0530	what you can do be to actually do this essay you could sort of read load of like not even like academic article just like things from like the daily not even in the
S0529	the daily mail
S0530	not the daily mail
S0529	yeah
S0530	but read like
S0529	no like from i know what you mean
S0530	read yeah like the telegraph or something like that
S0529	yeah
S0530	like really just general like mainstream news article so it'll be understandable at least and it'll it'll be informative because it's you know it's a well respect paper but it won't be like gobbledygook hopefully
S0529	mm
S0530	erm they you'll you'll be able to do it like i think somebody if you be like do you remember in primary school or like early high school and they're like right go away find out about something and then write an essay on it and then write about like what you find out like literally just treat it as that like they tell you to go and find out about something and you just kind of approach like find out the pros and con and then write what you think and then just see it
S0529	yeah
S0530	very basic rather than oh shit hit everything
S0529	sorry
S0530	no don't i hit myself and you apologise
S0530	oh that
S0529	on that shitty bed
S0530	automatically make it
S0529	i hate those bed
S0530	your fault
S0529	be your bed like this with the wooden thing
S0530	yeah yeah it's annoy
S0529	yeah they're annoy those aren't they i hate them
S0530	cos you can't like
S0529	you just feel like they're cots or something
S0530	oh my god they do
S0529	yeah erm i don't i don't know it's like the thing be it's just the write bite like i just don't have the right it sound stupid but i literally like when people write essay i don't know how to do that anymore
S0530	mm
S0529	you know er
S0530	i know yeah i mean cos you
S0529	i just don't
S0530	kind of you kind of get out of the habit of write essay don't you
S0529	yeah
S0530	like you like you just don't mm
S0529	the last essay i write be the one like for english coursework and i read back i read it back and it be like really shit but it get full mark but it be so shit but like i think my standards be quite high also
S0529	and so i don't know why it's
S0530	that's probably why you're struggle so much because i think you're
S0529	well i dunno
S0530	i think maybe you're
S0529	mm
S0530	you're you don't even know you er you're expect a high standard of yourself
S0529	yeah
S0530	but you don't like you don't
S0529	but i'm not gonna be able to
S0530	yeah
S0529	deliver it like this cos i i
S0530	maybe you've get like an idea in your head of what it should be like but that's completely like almost unobtainable
S0529	mm i dunno
S0530	like
S0529	i don't feel like it's unobtainable like the way you write yours
S0530	it's
S0529	that's how i would want mine to sound in that kind of
S0530	that essay wasn't very good though
S0529	yeah but it no it be though it be like the way it it sound like it be just
S0530	mm
S0529	understandable and
S0530	cos that that wasn't even a well that be a review
S0529	yeah no no no
S0530	cos i couldn't even express myself
S0529	yeah
S0530	properly
S0529	not the structure but it's like
S0530	but yeah
S0529	more the word and the
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	the language
S0530	the word
S0529	and stuff just i i just don't know how to make mine sound like that cos i'm so shit these days that it like i can't do it
S0530	i mean mine didn't sound like that straight away like you have to read through it a few time
S0529	yeah
S0530	and try and like make word sound a bite better and you
S0529	yeah
S0530	vary your language a bite and make it a bite like juicy but and like to be honest
S0529	mm
S0530	cos i think the more you worry about it the more it build up and the more unable you be to do it
S0529	yeah
S0530	so maybe if you get a piece of paper and then just write down maybe even write down some just some facts that you find out and then write just write good list of just random point bad conclusion i think it's good or bad
S0529	yeah
S0530	like just read a bite around it
S0529	oh see the annoy thing be it's it's not even this one that's the hard one
S0530	no

S0529	i do have quite a high tolerance to be honest to like to pain
S0530	burn and stuff yeah
S0529	or just pain in general really
S0532	yeah cos i erm i be just take some stuff out of the bake tray
S0530	mm
S0532	and
S0529	i'm so clumsy
S0532	get it on my plate and i and i my hand meet the edge of the thing for like a second but it be already

S0530	in go
S0529	like a weekend shop together
S0530	yeah
S0529	present for everyone
S0532	oh yeah
S0530	that would be
S0529	they've already get light up
S0532	oh i'm really excite erm cos like er christmas time yes okay it be the most crowd
S0529	oh i'm so jealous
S0532	fuck thing ever cos they like they yeah
S0529	for christmas
S0530	they do it really nicely
S0529	they do so nice
S0532	be like
S0529	we've never be there during christmas i've always want to go
S0532	decorate like the john lewis thing it's like they put like huge display up
S0530	mm
S0532	it's really cool it's
S0530	it must feel really christmassy in like
S0532	mm
S0530	you know when sometimes you just don't feel like christmas happen
S0529	yeah
S0530	like do you feel like christmas come last year
S0532	yeah i do yeah i definitely
S0530	yeah
S0532	i i prefer the run up to christmas to christmas
S0530	yeah rather than christmas day
S0532	erm more purely because i'm not in when it's christmas i'm at my grandparents' house and i don't like be there and i
S0530	where do you grandparents live
S0529	do you go there every year
S0532	yeah
S0530	oh okay
S0532	we have to go they're too old to travel we never use to we use to erm like take turn so i've have christmas at my house a couple of time but now it's not possible for my grandpa to like go anywhere
S0530	mm
S0532	really so and i just don't like go my parent and my mum hat it i mean like mm i see where she's come from she doesn't like christmas because we always get really nice kind of expensive present for the family
S0530	oh yeah you say this yeah
S0532	and yeah we don't get anything kind of back on the same sort of level and i don't like you know you can't really give someone a thirty pound gift and expect a thirty pound one in return if you don't have thirty pound to spend her argument be be why don't we get them some cheap crap like when they get us cheap crap erm i dunno i feel like i'm do overspend a little bite i think sometimes
S0530	mm
S0532	some of the present be like really excessive
S0530	i mean how much how much do you spend on them
S0532	well one time i buy my cousin a camera i mean so i dunno how much that be probably about fifty quid or something but erm
S0530	yeah yeah
S0532	and like i get like a pair of like earrings like from claire's accessories and i mean i think it's that kind of like i feel like it should be closer
S0530	mm
S0532	kind of
S0530	yeah that it should be less of a gap
S0529	well i mean no one want earrings from claire's accessories
S0532	it wasn't well actually
S0532	from claire's accessories like erm like you know if you know when you just get it on like a piece of paper with the earrings like put in like the thing that hang on the loop like it wasn't when i say earrings i don't mean like the one that come in a little box that you open up it's
S0530	mm
S0532	on the cushion like not that kind of erm just like some drug store generic things i just feel like you know er something that be like twenty quid would have be fine like like that's still kind of multiple time more expensive than what they get us and and then it doesn't like it's nice but it kind of must be a little i would be a little bite embarrass if like i have spend that little on someone and they have get me something like that
S0530	mm
S0532	but erm and it's not just the expense that kind like i don't really care too much about
S0530	be they very well off
S0532	my parent yeah but not them
S0530	oh yeah
S0532	no no no not them
S0530	yeah
S0532	erm which be why i think my dad spend so much i think he kind of have this weird guilt about be kind of like us be like the
S0530	the richer family
S0532	rich extend family and they're not like his sister like literally shovel horse shit for a live and she make like ten grand a year
S0530	be she a farmer
S0532	shovel crap no she's not a farmer she's erm she it's just horse she's in a stable
S0530	oh right she work at like stable and things
S0532	yeah she's just in a stable
S0530	that's what i mean i didn't mean a farmer
S0532	no no no well you know
S0530	cos farmers be well they don't make load but they make a alright amount of money
S0532	mm well she have a degree and everything but she just didn't wanna do it didn't wanna work erm she like horse though so i guess that's you know
S0530	i've always be a bite wary of horse myself
S0532	i've always be cos i go horseriding when i be younger like i
S0530	you've be safe around horse
S0532	i'm not yeah i'm not kind of
S0530	yeah
S0532	er like at all erm weirded out by horse but i be er like cow for example cow freak me out
S0530	cow you you don't see much of cow probably do you
S0532	no
S0530	cos like you know when we be do about the evacuees like they'd never see a cow
S0530	that's like you
S0532	i remember i remember that exact assignment and it also they'd never see a cow but everyone else in my class have to pretend that they've see a cow
S0532	what fuck idiot's never see a cow but like well to be fair now i have see cow like you know obviously you do leave london occasionally go on holiday to place where there be cow
S0530	whereas in my school it be like who the fuck's never see a cow before
S0530	basically
S0529	where would you go on holiday somewhere with cow
S0532	i dunno if erm
S0530	wales there they have sheep and cow
S0529	or like
S0532	we use to go on holiday to wales
S0529	like france you know spain
S0532	there's lot of cow
S0530	it have sunflowers
S0529	yeah
S0532	if the
S0530	and field
S0529	oh yeah i suppose it do yeah
S0532	oh yeah no everywhere everywhere pretty much farm cow
S0529	mm
S0532	all the nordic countries do cos nothing
S0529	mm
S0532	actually grow there so i suppose that's laugh cow isn't even english be it
S0530	isn't it
S0532	no
S0530	what be it
S0532	mm i think it's french or something something i dunno generic and it's erm european european country it's not english like in one of the advert it i can't remember what language it be but the laugh cow speak and it's not in english so erm
S0530	i be gonna say spanish because it's a red cow
S0532	i think it might actually be spanish
S0530	really oh my gosh would it be like the angry cow then because i think like red bull be just like the ones that be kind of use in the fight
S0532	i dunno well i mean it's an on
S0529	well it's a woman isn't it i suppose
S0530	yeah it's a female cow
S0530	oh i love the advert when we be younger
S0532	oh i remember go to
S0530	they're so shit now
S0532	a farm when i be we go to a farm in year seven and for our geography and it's like
S0530	nightmare
S0532	if you're like already kind of like gross out out about like outdoors and like farm and things like be in it would really put you off like
S0530	do they have farm in
S0532	no all this be outside of
S0530	oh okay
S0532	in a coach to go there it be jesus christ it be it be literally like just a pool of cow pee like they be collect this pee into this giant pool and no one and then there be all like like that be collect all the it be kind of but look back on it i didn't think of much of much of it now but like the space that they be confine to be very small
S0530	oh definitely
S0532	and i think i be too
S0530	i don't agree with animal farm at all
S0532	i think i be too gross out about the animal shit to like actually i mean like maybe like a cow would have like it be it wasn't like the really horrific picture that you see but it be like maybe from here this corner to halfway down this table like that corner be the size that a cow would have
S0530	mm
S0532	by itself and then all like separate as well so they couldn't like walk around and talk to each other or anything not that they would cos they're cow but you know what i mean erm oh it be
S0530	mm
S0532	really really gross but it be really fuck gross
S0530	how far away be the farm like from where you live
S0532	just outside
S0530	so like
S0532	and just like it be barely like it's almost in london
S0530	oh okay so you didn't have to go like two hours to find a farm
S0532	er it's weird it's not like erm like a gradual like super city less city less city less er slightly farmy slightly farmy very farmy like it's not like
S0530	it doesn't go like that no
S0532	yeah it it be kind of quite
S0530	mm
S0532	like you can cos it kind of like london have sort of like a lot of growths basically like little tumours of like place that sort of be er really like villages on their own and then that have get so close to london they even become part of london and then
S0530	mm
S0532	obviously that's kind of come that way and that's come out that way so you can be like not in london
S0530	mm
S0532	but you'd be surround by london on two side or something so yeah it be like that
S0530	that's cool
S0532	basically we be very close but it be yeah it be gross yeah i dunno i be just christmas isn't fun cos my grandparents like my grandpa be nice when he like wasn't completely crazy
S0529	hiya
S0530	hello
S0532	not crazy but like he doesn't really know where he be anymore and so that's kind of shit and then my grandma just doesn't like me
S0530	mm
S0532	and i don't really like her so
S0532	i'm so tempt to make chicken nuggets just because it's easy
S0530	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	what's
S0532	it's alright i mean i mean she doesn't like me and she'll get freak out by me cos i'm always really loud crazy
S0529	i don't think she like me though
S0532	yeah
S0530	who's this
S0530	be this 's
S0532	i don't think it's
S0530	oh okay that her name's i didn't know that
S0532	well probably she probably hear all those shit stuff it be like you tend when you when you talk to someone about people you tend like if they're be nice or whatever you don't really say anything but when they're annoy you you do
S0530	mm
S0532	so like you tend to hear all the shit stuff cos i come in and she already know about and i be a bite like
S0530	oh really yeah i mean i have a great impression of her because the first time i hear her be her have sex through the wall which be lovely
S0530	so now every time i see her i just kind of hear
S0532	i don't really hear her cos i'm not i've get er a little weird cupboard a boiler i think between me and so

S0533	mm
S0532	iron board that's better than the crap that we have here now
S0529	i haven't use it but

S0532	you'll yeah fewer contact hours
S0530	people
S0529	well you'll still have like a seminar a week for your thing and then a couple of lecture surely because i don't feel like you have a lot

S0530	like miss your coursework
S0533	it doesn't
S0530	deadline and have to
S0533	it doesn't make any
S0530	run in but you couldn't cos you miss the bus or the bus
S0533	cos you think that it's even if it's ten fifteen minutes
S0529	oh i know yeah that's
S0533	and the sort of
S0532	i might get a car
S0530	yeah
S0532	i might i might learn how to drive in that case
S0530	mm
S0532	i can just take nick my mum's car she doesn't like it like anyway she'll get a new one i'll nick hers
S0530	cos you think yeah i always think about move out but then again i feel like
S0532	well that's what i wanna do i just
S0533	it it it cost two hundred and fifty pound for three
S0529	but then think about how nice it would be to have like a little flat family and have like
S0530	it would be nice
S0529	like tv
S0532	oh like be near a sainsbury's
S0530	or like a lounge
S0532	so i can actually carry my coke load
S0529	you could have a little lounge and it would just be
S0529	your house
S0532	i literally like be it a really do a reason why i do deliveries be cos i cannot carry the amount of coke
S0530	mm
S0532	that i wanna bring
S0529	i think i would move out
S0532	eighteen can be not that bad this time it be better than when i be thirty two i think that be manageable
S0530	mm
S0533	like yeah i've get two of them
S0529	i
S0530	yeah
S0532	mm
S0532	along with everything else i be
S0529	be this all yours
S0533	it it wasn't that hard to carry
S0532	mm
S0529	be this all yours
S0532	yeah i just i'm prepare myself
S0533	what be you make
S0532	mentally to do some cook
S0532	but it will be cook i haven't do it yet but it's all out what other things will be good about live further away to be next to the shop i've see if we be to stay on campus would we be allow to move to a different accommodation
S0529	no i don't think so
S0530	no you have to stay in your college
S0529	cos you have to reapply for this anywhere cos it
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos people first years would wanna get in there as well and they probably have first pick
S0532	well i'd say if we apply for like early for second year
S0530	er you have to stay in your college
S0529	doesn't it yeah you have to stay in your college
S0530	you have to when you when you're assign a college you have to stay
S0529	yeah
S0530	in your college
S0532	yeah no i would then i would rather the only reason i i would consider move be if i be consider stay be if we move college
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	i don't want to think about
S0532	yeah i do think
S0530	i think that
S0532	i want to stay here next year but i'm not i'm start to think like not sure cos i don't really feel like the campus offer anything that you couldn't get live outside
S0530	yeah
S0532	like
S0530	i mean the only thing
S0530	keep me here be the think of like lecture just be very
S0529	just be
S0530	like cos literally you
S0529	but they're not even that close to be honest
S0530	yeah
S0529	to us like they still take twenty minutes to get to like
S0530	mm
S0529	when you're walk
S0530	yeah
S0529	especially to like i dunno
S0530	cos i'm just think how early you'd have to get up in the morning like to get a bus and then walk from the
S0529	yeah
S0530	bus to campus and then if you miss the bus say rather than just you could just run to a lecture kind of thing
S0529	but then again like most people in second year like my sister like most people in her year she say didn't go to the lecture they just go to seminars
S0530	okay
S0529	cos lecture just weren't important like you could just look them up
S0530	mm
S0529	they just have powerpoints
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i suppose that's
S0530	mm
S0529	you know you know
S0532	i mean there there be fewer of them and then if you have like a few for the whole day you would just stay on campus for the day to
S0529	well yeah exactly
S0532	kind of to work just
S0529	just stay and do your work
S0530	that's true you could just stay there
S0532	you'll only you'll only be do
S0530	yeah
S0532	like three trip a day like how we do you would just stay
S0530	for the day that's true actually
S0532	i mean it
S0530	yeah
S0529	if you think about it there be people in our year who live in like and stuff and
S0530	and it'll be cheaper won't it to live in a house than this
S0529	oh so much cheaper like be supposedly like one of the cheapest uni towns
S0530	mm
S0532	i want a nice one though
S0529	in england
S0532	with a dishwasher
S0530	a nice one with a dishwasher
S0529	i'm not sure i think dishwashers might
S0532	i want a double bed but
S0529	yeah you could get a double bed
S0530	some of them some of them have
S0529	my sister have a double bed
S0530	yeah some of them
S0529	have a double bed
S0530	yeah
S0533	i don't mind pay
S0529	you've just gotta get in really quickly
S0532	i would be will to pay
S0530	mm
S0533	i'd want something really modern and sort of
S0529	well what be we pay now something
S0530	yeah state of the art
S0533	yeah
S0529	about two hundred and twenty you'd be pay less than that in a house i reckon
S0533	you'd be pay less than this this be really expensive
S0529	yeah they're really expensive yeah
S0533	this be like you may not think
S0532	do you wanna know how expensive like a flat in per month now
S0533	no
S0529	i don't
S0532	i saw an article about it
S0530	hundred and seventy
S0533	no
S0532	hundred and seventy pound a month
S0530	a week
S0533	no no no you you can get something decent for about two fifty i think something
S0529	oh no
S0533	something like this for about two fifty i'd say
S0529	two fifty a week you'd say
S0533	probably yeah
S0532	it's about two thousand
S0530	a week
S0533	a week
S0529	fuck
S0532	a week
S0533	like here
S0532	no a month a month a month
S0533	oh right
S0529	i be gonna say two thousand a week
S0532	no no no no no
S0529	i would have be that would have be insane
S0532	but like it's like it's like four hundred i think a week normally
S0530	that's
S0532	that's crazy that
S0530	what for students
S0532	no
S0530	or just for live
S0532	no well no just like an average flat
S0530	okay
S0529	that's what it's like in yeah
S0532	well to be fair if you be if you be a student it's
S0530	it would still be expensive
S0532	it's quite likely you'd get special you would have to get whatever flat be
S0530	yeah
S0532	if i actually how do you do i don't think anyone do student house i think people would probably stay on campus if they want to go to a uni
S0529	mm
S0532	i think a great deal of people that go to unis be live in anyway
S0529	yeah not many of them have like that much accommodation
S0532	most people most people will just
S0530	mm
S0532	live at home for the whole
S0529	yeah
S0532	that's what i would do
S0529	i know some people from they be like live under a subway in like a tiny two bedroomed like thing it be disgust
S0530	oh my god
S0529	and they be at one of the best universities in like pretty much the world like it be really crazy like mm doesn't seem fair
S0533	for for here like this area it's quite expensive already
S0529	mm
S0530	what in
S0529	i think it be quite cheap here
S0533	one two six a week
S0529	i think it be like eighty a week or something
S0533	one two six a week
S0529	no
S0533	one two six a week for
S0529	oh oh oh here
S0533	what for what we're get here
S0529	that can't yeah
S0530	be ours
S0529	oh yeah that's a bite
S0530	one two six or one three four
S0532	why be our one more expensive than everyone else
S0530	because on
S0529	i don't think mine's one two
S0530	on in on the website it say how much be
S0533	one two six
S0530	it's one two six between one two six and one three four
S0533	but i think they obviously
S0529	mine's definitely not that
S0530	it's what
S0533	maybe do it
S0532	my one's one one eight
S0529	yeah so's mine
S0533	what's yours
S0530	be yours what
S0532	one one eight
S0533	one one eight a week
S0530	one one eight
S0532	yeah
S0533	one one
S0529	it's cos we have a lower a shorter lease and we've get a lot of disable room as well
S0533	i think mine's shorter lease
S0530	be yours a thirty six week i think that's mine
S0532	i think it's
S0530	as well
S0532	i think yeah my one be for
S0533	but i'm pay
S0530	and the thirty six
S0532	i think it be
S0529	if you have to move out in in easter like i do
S0530	mm
S0529	then you've get a shorter lease as well
S0530	okay so it's one one eight pound
S0529	yeah
S0533	yeah so be mine i've get a shorter lease but
S0530	okay
S0533	it's still one two six
S0532	but i've get a
S0530	i think it be
S0532	i've get fourteen weeks on mine for one one eight
S0530	oh okay
S0529	oh
S0530	that's strange
S0529	that's weird i don't know how it work out
S0532	oh i just think that and like i've see other accommodation and it be exactly the same it's like it be the complete
S0533	there's as well but
S0532	like a like 's room be a mirror image of mine like it's just flick the carpet be blue and they've get a pin board that be the only the difference
S0529	and a pin board
S0530	mm
S0532	no but like in their room a girl like a little one
S0529	mm
S0532	by where the coat hanger be
S0529	oh ah
S0532	yeah that be the only difference and she's get a really nice view
S0529	what colour's our carpet then if hers be blue
S0532	purple
S0530	purple
S0529	oh god it be i hate our carpet
S0532	i actually don't mind it cos it match my but erm yeah no oh she's really lucky cos she's like on the top floor of one of the things and she open up the
S0529	i'd love to be higher up
S0530	mm
S0532	erm she basically open it's like a like a very narrow carpark that's just get a load of tree in front of it so she just see tree top from her window
S0529	mm mm
S0532	and she that's so nice cos i see a path
S0532	i see a busy path
S0529	i just wanna live in
S0529	and like the townhouses in
S0532	mm
S0530	be lovely
S0529	i just wanna live in a townhouse
S0532	everyone i meet be in it's really depress
S0530	yeah they be everyone's in

S0532	yeah
S0530	they look quite nice
S0533	yeah yeah
S0530	the house
S0529	yeah yeah
S0530	but yeah
S0533	from on the picture online of the i be put off like i definitely be gonna choose from the online picture
S0530	oh okay yeah
S0533	cos they do look a bite
S0529	i don't think they have enough online picture
S0530	no
S0529	for accommodation
S0530	i can't remember what look like online
S0533	it's exactly what
S0529	i don't know if i've get one at all
S0533	it's exactly what the like what my room look like so
S0529	i think i apply to and to and
S0533	three
S0529	somewhere else

S0529	oh be it two well those two then
S0533	mine be
S0532	mm
S0532	yeah same cos i just i couldn't be bother so i just put in superior en suite
S0533	yeah
S0532	and then just go for the first two and it be alphabetical so and
S0533	mm
S0532	come up first and i be like yeah
S0530	mm
S0532	that's fine
S0533	i don't like
S0532	and then i i actually look on yeah it's all the way over fuck there
S0530	mm
S0533	it's not actually that far it feel longer when it's rain but it's
S0532	yeah but i be just think like have superior en suite if i'd go there i apply in like like june or something i apply really early i be er i have the option of every single place i could have have anywhere and i just be lazy
S0529	yeah you could have
S0532	just have

S0532	yeah
S0529	go anywhere
S0530	mm
S0532	and i didn't i just
S0529	mm
S0532	didn't think i be just go and they look superior en suite that's fine
S0529	like with me i i apply for the superior en suite and i wish i hadn't now cos
S0533	well
S0529	i don't actually care now about en suite i think i would rather have a share cos i do at and it be never a problem we have a nice couple of bathrooms like we have three bathrooms in one
S0533	but it depend on your room yeah
S0532	well and
S0529	no there's be never a problem like nobody be ever wait for shower or
S0530	mm
S0529	it be never like really dirty or leak or anything like that and it's just like have a toilet in your room it's a bite of faff cos mine leak all the time like the shower and it just
S0532	yeah i wish we have like proper cleaners and
S0529	and you have to clean and it's just like a bite annoy
S0532	's at and someone
S0530	mm
S0529	like cos they clean the toilets
S0532	someone clean
S0529	for you when they're not yours
S0530	mm
S0532	no at at have a cleaner that come
S0529	yeah
S0532	er once a week and the cleaner clean the kitchen and do all the like entirely like a proper clean and they come and clean the bathrooms as well
S0533	yeah they do it here as well in
S0529	but
S0533	they clean every day
S0532	they clean the bathrooms
S0533	yeah
S0530	oh
S0532	why be i not in
S0533	well no
S0533	a lot it's our room they they clean them every day
S0532	wait be you in the superior en suite
S0533	no like
S0532	no that's what i what i'm say
S0533	it it's share
S0532	have his own
S0533	oh right
S0532	he have a bathtub and a toilet and a cleaner come into his room personally and clean his own bathroom for him
S0530	mm
S0533	yeah that's nice
S0530	do have the option of have like no like share bathroom it doesn't do it
S0532	no it's completely en suite that's why like it's quite popular
S0530	mm cos i probably won't be able to afford this next year to be honest
S0529	mm
S0530	like if i stay here mm
S0533	yeah i'll maybe like just
S0532	i have to take this cos it be like
S0533	this
S0532	i be on clear so i wouldn't have have another option but they say on the thing like it's
S0533	for what we're get this be really expensive
S0532	it's basically
S0533	for a little room that i've get and a kitchen it's very
S0532	no it really doesn't feel superior to me in any way
S0533	yeah
S0532	yeah it
S0533	well you've get
S0529	well what be er what be the difference between this one and it's a desk it's the desk
S0533	be it
S0532	it must be
S0529	yeah they don't have a brown desk like
S0532	yeah
S0529	we do that's it that's the only difference i think it mean we'd get a bathtub i really
S0529	want a bathtub
S0532	well didn't you
S0530	you be that's a bite ambitious
S0529	well no cos my only experience of student accommodation be and he have a bathtub
S0530	mm
S0529	but that's very rare
S0532	well i didn't know that
S0530	i've never hear of anyone have a bathtub
S0532	i literally know
S0530	i've never hear that that's crazy
S0529	i know there's this cool person at university and they have a bathtub so and literally a hundred percent of the people i know that go to uni have a bathtub
S0532	mm
S0530	mm
S0529	i mean i do try and lower my expectations cos uni halls in general be just shit they they don't treat students very nicely they give them shit place to live that's just part of it like
S0533	i don't think this be as that bad
S0529	but it's not as bad as it could have be like we could have get you know
S0530	yeah like some people have like mould grow on the wall
S0529	yeah
S0533	do you know like that 's
S0529	well i have mould in my bathroom
S0533	's be
S0533	like like the best for the last couple of years
S0532	yeah
S0529	yeah i dread to think what standard accommodation
S0533	for our accommodation
S0529	be like if this be consider superior though like
S0530	mm
S0529	it must be really shit
S0532	but that's almost like i mean that's the only difference
S0529	mm
S0530	it look nice from the outside
S0529	no no it look a bite like an old people's
S0530	no but it's
S0529	i i say it look like very nice erm like a luxury house estate in soviet russia
S0529	it do it like
S0530	it do a bite
S0529	think about it
S0530	yeah yeah
S0530	like it look very
S0533	it look nice from outside i think
S0532	a luxury
S0530	look like a
S0532	house estate in soviet russia
S0529	well we have quite a nice place like i like where our location be
S0532	cos it's all very samey and like communisty look like all the
S0529	we have a good though kitchen though
S0530	mm
S0529	like this house be good in relation to where everything else be like cos just up there that's the way to
S0530	why do
S0529	and there's no cars here
S0530	most people in third year move back then
S0532	no i would have i would have prefer to
S0529	be right there
S0532	i would have prefer a build down there cos like
S0532	you do not have the main path that go with the uni grind outside your room like i see people move to their lecture
S0532	every day like i i can't remember the last time
S0529	yeah that's actually
S0532	i open my curtain i actually can't
S0529	open your curtain i know
S0532	yeah yeah you walk past most curtain will be close
S0529	yeah i always have artificial light in my room
S0533	i think you put a net up
S0532	er
S0533	i think you get a
S0532	can't even be bother to put it back up again it fell down and i haven't
S0529	it would have be nice if we'd be on like the top floor cos you can see out to the other side from that side
S0532	oh yeah ideally i would have like to have be on the top floor on that side but then when you get the bus to like you see all of the house that be like way back where we be and you just you think you're quite lucky to have them all quite close to them
S0530	mm
S0532	mm closer to everything else
S0533	i wouldn't wanna live out there
S0532	no cos they go
S0530	no
S0532	all the way down and they go all the way down that way as well
S0529	mm yeah would have be okay though
S0532	really i think look further
S0533	yeah that would
S0532	to me because it's all the way down there
S0529	yeah but the it's it's like it's erm it's actually one less bus or two less bus stop if you think about it
S0532	yeah yeah the bus never come
S0530	how come people move back here in third year then didn't go back
S0529	i think
S0529	cos he's a rep he get to but i'm not sure how else
S0530	he
S0529	how else you could do it really
S0533	third year can if you apply
S0529	you can
S0533	yeah if you apply early
S0530	cos they say a lot of third years do
S0529	yeah
S0530	for some reason maybe it's cos you get a lot of contact hours or something
S0533	not a lot of work to be you would be in the library quite a lot
S0530	that's the thing yeah like i suppose if you live in a house buy a printer couldn't you and have like buy ink and stuff cos it be
S0529	well i've get a printer
S0530	it be handy have the library there to just
S0529	i need to find out what printer you have cos my dad say that he'd buy me one and
S0532	it's a hp pavilion
S0529	i wanna find one that have cheap ink
S0530	mm
S0533	i've get an epson
S0530	oh yeah i've get that one at home
S0532	i have an epson at home as well but i i want like a particular one that i know will come with cheap ink cos sometimes you can get ink and it cost like forty quid or something
S0529	yeah mine be virtually but it be like thirty quid for the printer and the ink cost
S0530	that's really good
S0533	be it a printer
S0529	yeah
S0533	would it be a
S0529	it's not bad actually it's get a scanner
S0533	it would be a
S0529	and a
