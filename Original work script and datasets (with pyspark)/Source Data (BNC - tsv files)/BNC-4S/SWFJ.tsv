S0024	mm
S0144	mm some people just like to argue don't they
S0025	mm
S0024	what's this new there's a new trend with female circumcision
S0062	i know
S0062	well it's very big in egypt isn't it anyway apparently
S0024	be it
S0062	yeah apparently i think they still say it they make it illegal in egypt but it's still a very big part of their culture
S0024	i didn't know that
S0144	there's a lot more impact on their their organs than the male though it's quite a dodgy procedure
S0062	well they say because it's illegal now in egypt they be say how because they've force it underground and it still take place it cause there be a lot of quite a lot of death from it and everything because they it it it because it's do because it's do by dodgy people
S0024	really
S0144	yeah
S0025	because it's dodgy
S0024	oh that's not good that's not good
S0062	i think it say something like seventy percent of all egyptian woman have have it do
S0144	really wow
S0024	i never even know that
S0062	because you're not allow any pleasure
S0062	that's what that's what it's for to stop the
S0024	be it
S0062	yeah it's to stop the crave of it or the think about it
S0024	really i
S0144	yeah it make it extremely painful
S0062	i think in nigeria and place like that they do a lot of it as well
S0144	mm
S0025	how horrendous
S0144	mm hmm bad isn't it
S0024	but they say the trend be come to england quite a lot
S0025	really

S0144	it be very nice
S0025	see we'd love to cook we couldn't possibly cook anything with alcohol in it for mum she wouldn't like it
S0024	no cos now they watch a television programme which tell them that tell say that it doesn't boil off all of the alcohol so that's mum out with anything anymore
S0144	yeah but she be drink your sloe gin the other day
S0025	be she
S0024	oh yes she do she try it yes
S0144	yeah it do last about four days but she do drink it
S0025	what the one glass
S0144	yeah
S0024	i think dad might have polish that off
S0144	oh right
S0025	oh do you like it
S0024	but oh it be lovely yeah oh we really like that
S0025	we've get some more
S0144	that be well nice
S0024	mm
S0144	yeah in that little bottle with the the cork
S0025	yeah yeah oh good
S0024	mm it be really really lovely
S0144	yeah
S0025	make some erm well we have a bite of a disaster make some er fruit vodka where you boil down lot of like berry and stuff and then add some vodka and put it into the bottle and then you take off the sediment
S0024	mm
S0025	but we have our we be make lot of christmas present and one of the christmas present be erm onion chutney or onion sweet onion relish
S0024	no we've get onion erm marmalade
S0062	yeah
S0025	that's what we'd be make just before
S0024	yeah it's lovely
S0025	yeah that's lovely but then if you clean it but it smell of onions and then you make onion er onion vodka basically
S0025	onion fruit vodka so we've get a whole batch of onion fruit vodka
S0024	huh
S0062	mm you can try some in a bite
S0025	it just yeah it just smell of onions
S0024	sound lovely mm
S0144	onion fruit vodka
S0025	well because the pan just have so we'd wash it
S0024	yeah well because use the same
S0062	yeah the there must have be such a strong taste or smell in it
S0025	but you know sometimes you if you make a curry in a pan you can even though you've wash it you can still a bite of curry
S0024	yeah
S0025	well it obviously have a bite of onion still linger so now we've get onion fruit vodka
S0062	four bottle of onion fruit
S0025	two yeah two four four bottle yeah and we can't drink it now because it just every time we try it
S0024	and do it it turn liqueury
S0062	yeah that's the whole point of it yeah
S0025	yeah i want to try and make some of that
S0062	well you can try some later it's not horrendous by any mean
S0024	then i go to the shop and realise how expensive vodka be nowadays
S0025	yeah
S0024	i think it be really cheap stuff
S0144	really how much
S0024	yeah well i don't know
S0025	twenty quid a bottle
S0144	twenty
S0025	well we buy a massive one
S0062	no i don't it be about a tenner a bottle depend on which one you buy but at least a tenner a bottle
S0024	yeah but i think it be i think you could buy like cheap vodka to make liqueurs but i couldn't find it like even like the supermarkets own brand or something be still nine pound
S0025	stingy
S0024	yeah i think i be yeah
S0025	because you could make quite a lot with that probably so in the end it's actually quite
S0062	cos it triple in strength doesn't it if you put sugar in it and leave it
S0144	do it
S0024	mm
S0062	mm well be tell us about what they like in australia be vodka and erm fisherman's friends isn't it
S0025	moonshine and stuff oh yeah
S0144	fisherman's friends
S0062	and that yeah which i just think sound disgust but i will have to try it because he say it's like that's the big drink over there
S0025	so you just
S0144	be it really
S0062	if you put crush a few fisherman's friends stick it in vodka and leave it with a bite of sugar for a few a few months
S0024	menthol
S0025	yeah and it just blow your head off
S0144	yeah
S0062	but yeah leave it so it become like a liqueur or whatever but he say that's the big drink over there
S0144	wow mm
S0062	i just think fisherman's friends that's like disgust but
S0024	well i don't know it's like i quite like a menthol drink
S0062	yeah maybe it might be quite nice
S0144	yeah it might be alright mightn't it
S0024	how long do you have to leave it for
S0062	i think sort of two or three months
S0025	it's like a sambucary type
S0024	cos you have to put sugar
S0062	i think yeah you put the you crush up the five or six fisherman's friends stick it in bite of sugar to turn it to add increase the alcohol the percentage in it leave it
S0144	hmm yeah huh
S0025	the trouble be you just don't know how strong it be so it could be really strong
S0144	it could blind you
S0025	yeah cos that's what they say about moonshine isn't it cos i remember my friend at university make some moonshine and i tell dad and he say you could go blind
S0024	moonshine what be it
S0144	i remember
S0025	i don't know how you make moonshine but it's with vodka and i don't know
S0144	i don't know
S0025	potatoes
S0062	well no it's not like vodka it be the potato isn't it
S0025	it's potato so it's potato
S0062	well it doesn't have to be potato it could be lot of different things i think
S0025	yeah you could make well you could make alcohol out of just about anything can't you
S0024	mm
S0062	well i remember your mum and dad say about how they use to get the marrow
S0025	oh yeah
S0062	and they'd carve out the marrow add load of sugar in it pour do they even say they pour vodka in it
S0025	no i don't think they pour anything in it and they just leave it that it drip through the bottom because it ferment
S0062	oh yeah that's it it be just like yeah just just yeah put a hole in it put load of sugar in it brown sugar and then just leave it drip into a
S0144	your mum and dad use to do that
S0025	into a demijohn or something yeah and then you've get like proper pure alcohol ethanol
S0144	wow
S0024	from a marrow
S0025	yeah so you just hang it up in the air cupboard or wherever
S0062	i think i would personally choose something nicer than a marrow but
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm
S0062	melon would probably be quite good wouldn't it
S0025	yeah yeah
S0024	well you can do it with any any fruit can you
S0062	yeah
S0024	mm
S0025	anything that could ferment i guess
S0144	mm hmm
S0025	let's do it
S0062	well we'll try some onion fruit vodka in a bite
S0024	mm
S0062	and we'll see what you think about it it's not actually that bad it just see if you hadn't have say that and you taste it you might not even think about it
S0025	i know i shouldn't have say it because now you're go to think it taste of it
S0024	well love onions
S0144	yeah i love onions onions and
S0024	you eat onions raw and cook anything don't you

S0025	oh i don't know what do that man do on masterchef last night he fail didn't he because he they be like you should never ever ever put strawberries with ham and whatever he'd put for his starter it be all wrong
S0062	yeah that's true

S0062	so you just hear scream basically and they send the next lot in
S0025	and she go it's your turn next and you walk in and you're hold onto this rope and then all of a sudden this realistic underground er train would come and just come towards you and then brake right at the last minute so you it it's like you about to be hit by a train and there be a skeleton drive it
S0024	mm oh god

S0025	oh yeah
S0024	the day after the wed we go on the ghost tour
S0025	oh do you
S0144	we go we go underground into the you know the the old tunnel and stuff
S0025	yeah
S0144	but there be this guide it be ten o'clock at night it start and then this girl turn up with this big cloak
S0025	oh great

S0025	mm
S0144	because that be like big in edinburgh
S0062	burk and hare or whatever they be call
S0025	ah
S0144	yeah that's it and then you go underground into all these tombs and then
S0024	mm cos the underground network in be massive
S0144	it's massive
S0025	oh be it
S0144	yeah it's quite interest
S0062	it be like a big city isn't it edinburgh
S0024	yeah because the live down there
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah they use live right down the bottom
S0144	and it be quite weird because you would be down there and it would be like all drip and but then there would be load of nightclubs who have buy out all the cellars as well
S0025	yeah yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	so you you could hear all this like like like bass
S0025	really
S0144	but it be quite weird it add to the ambience a little bite it be a bite strange
S0025	yeah cos like something's go on over there that you can't see
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then there be all these weird witchy room with the circle and she she be like i don't know she be dare well not dare she be she be tell people not to stand in the middle of the circle and stuff and leave the room and
S0144	yeah yeah
S0025	otherwise you'll disappear
S0024	i wouldn't dare i didn't dare i be like it be quite spooky
S0144	yeah i be the same i be like yeah
S0025	yeah yeah sometimes you just want you don't want to tempt fate do you
S0024	and when yeah when it's completely black and you're stand there as well it be like i don't know it's freaky
S0144	yeah and then someone run past and and scream you know to make
S0024	mm but they didn't
S0144	but it have that one it have event that it all lead up to that one event of the scream it wasn't like your one where you
S0025	yeah
S0024	it wasn't like your one
S0025	oh it be it be constantly people chase you it be horrible
S0024	yeah it be like yeah that sound like really
S0144	yeah your one sound mess up
S0062	i think yeah if you go if you go on but you didn't really know what it be all about then i think it would be really frighten actually
S0024	mm
S0062	cos at the start when we actually pay for it we
S0025	we'd go through the back entrance so we didn't even se the build up outside
S0062	no that's right yeah
S0024	mm
S0025	outside the other side they be like go come over here come on come on meet your fate and all of this lot but we have go in through the back entrance so we didn't know what it be about
S0062	yeah and we go into this room and it be as we pay the money and it be like the history of tower bridge
S0025	about the history of the underground we be like oh god
S0062	and it be like oh no what you know like old seventies videos of the queen open the tower bridge and we think oh my what have we pay for here
S0025	and it be oh god we can't get out of this now i've pay twenty five quid each for that
S0025	so i've get to go and sit through some history lesson and i don't know if they'd do that deliberately
S0062	i yeah i think they probably have
S0144	maybe
S0024	maybe yeah yeah
S0144	that's quite clever then yeah
S0024	yeah
S0025	because it be like the shitiest video you have ever see and you're like oh god they've really spend like zero pence
S0062	yeah and it be only ten people that you're only allow ten people allow at a time which be really good so
S0025	yeah oh god it be so
S0024	thank you
S0144	that sound awesome that do
S0024	it do sound really good
S0062	it be it be one of the funniest things i've ever be on i must say
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0025	you know but we almost didn't do that didn't we because we be just like oh twenty five pound
S0144	i think they be great things like that little tour and stuff
S0025	but we be like come on you're in london you can either walk around for hours and not actually do anything or we can go and have a bite of fun
S0144	yeah yeah yeah cos
S0025	so i'm glad we do it i'd like to go to tower of london as well
S0144	yeah but one of the best things about london be there be lot of free stuff to do as well
S0024	lot of
S0062	yeah that's it you you could just go and do museums all day really
S0025	yeah yeah so you could balance it out
S0024	yeah
S0062	and things like natural history museum and the science museum be just incredible
S0024	yeah
S0025	i know we hadn't probably everything though
S0062	it's like some of the best the best attractions in britain really i think
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	yeah
S0025	oh god and then in the even we be like right okay let go to leicester square it's just so busy
S0062	oh it's horrendous it's just
S0025	you just can't believe that amount of people there
