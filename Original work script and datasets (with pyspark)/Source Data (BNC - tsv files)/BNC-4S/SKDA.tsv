S0229	i don't know
S0198	i might have the rogan josh
S0230	you get extra bits in all of them
S0192	that's what i be think
S0230	but i can't remember which curry you actually have oh that's a new one
S0192	this be different it's not the same as the one in
S0198	be it not
S0192	say it be the same no
S0198	oh no it doesn't look the same as the one in
S0192	doesn't look the same at all
S0198	in
S0192	maybe the spice be the same but
S0198	either but i think of ah they've change it since we be last here
S0192	they've get different whiskys on here as well
S0198	they've change it since we be last here
S0192	ah
S0198	when i when i order the burger last time it be down in this section they they've update their menu
S0192	it's more expensive this be two forty in
S0198	oh be it
S0192	yeah
S0198	we do one
S0192	so it be different different versions
S0198	unless it's just go up check your menu again
S0230	that's
S0192	i be only there like a few days ago
S0198	alright then
S0192	last weekend
S0230	that's sweet potato chickpea and spinach curry be a new one
S0198	oh right so they've update their menu again
S0230	yeah
S0192	you gonna go for that one
S0198	be you get the large jalfrezi or something
S0230	no i don't think so
S0229	or maybe er
S0192	what what tickle your fancy what do you normally have
S0230	erm the jalfrezi i think be it
S0192	yeah chicken jalfrezi
S0230	yeah
S0229	be that what i normally have
S0230	i think so
S0192	i might go for the lamb
S0198	mm rogan josh
S0192	be it curry all round then
S0229	yeah
S0198	yeah look like it doesn't it
S0192	sound like a good idea be you get a drink
S0198	ah probably
S0192	i mean it do come with it
S0229	it come with a drink anyway
S0192	it come with it seem a bite silly not to get it doesn't it
S0198	not to get a kronenbourg or something like that
S0230	i might have the rogan josh actually cos we don't often have a lamb one do we
S0198	i like it i'm tempt by the chicken tikka masala
S0229	i'll have a chicken tikka masala
S0230	well that's what you have normally off of that menu when that's what they do any er
S0198	anyway
S0230	anyway they always have that one you don't normally have that on not when not when it's curry day
S0192	that guess it's point not
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	the ambient sound
S0230	you could that's go large you can have that with all of them
S0229	right let's get that then
S0230	it doesn't matter which curry you have you can have that with it
S0229	alright rise petal go and get it
S0198	i'm still debate give me a second
S0192	you have chip with it er
S0230	so you make your curry large by add a vegetable samosa and a large onion bhaji
S0229	that's it that's it
S0198	ah
S0192	do it make the actual curry large or do it just
S0230	no
S0229	no
S0198	no you just get a bhaji and a samosa
S0192	you just get more
S0230	yeah you just get a bhaji and
S0198	i dunno whether to make one of ours large how much be a large then
S0192	we can make one of them large and we'll share the samosa and the bhaji
S0198	bhaji
S0229	and their portion of chip

S0198	poppadums yeah they're a bite of a nonentity aren't they
S0229	yeah waste of time really
S0198	i don't know whether to get a rogan josh or a chicken tikka masala
S0198	alright alright i i think i get the rogan josh last time
S0229	yeah you do
S0198	so maybe i'll get the tikka masala or a chicken balti
S0230	oh i think i might have have the rogan josh last time when you have it didn't i

S0198	they're not they're damp
S0192	but it could happen they've find in history that the gulf stream have reverse
S0198	it's go it reverse every x amount of thousands of years so at any point it could just plunge us into the worst winter ever
S0230	the ice age again
S0192	yeah

S0192	then poof
S0230	yeah
S0192	go
S0230	they die
S0198	have to say this don't we
S0192	although today we still kind of have i mean a crocodile be effectively a dinosaur
S0198	they're prehistoric
S0192	they're perfectly evolve they be around at the same time they grow up to like seven or eight metres in length in the sea which be like three or four time the length of your dad they're pretty big
S0198	just with a bite sharper teeth
S0192	yeah
S0230	what's that alligator
S0192	yeah crocodiles salt water crocodiles they're dinosaurs effectively
S0230	crocodiles yeah
S0192	mm mm

S0192	yeah
S0230	don't they
S0198	oh yeah no they definitely will be yeah that's where it do survive the prehistoric stuff so
S0192	but they don't need to evolve anymore
S0198	no yeah
S0192	they're perfectly suit to their environment it's all good
S0198	what do whale evolve from cos they're massive
S0192	they be sea creatures that come out onto the land and then go back into the sea
S0198	and then go back into the sea yeah
S0230	whale
S0192	hence why they breathe
S0198	yeah
S0230	oh and they're mammals
S0192	yeah mammals in the sea will have come out of the sea and go back in the sea
S0198	it's probably also why they're
S0192	theoretically it's
S0198	i mean maybe not why but they're incredibly intelligent as well so
S0192	yeah
S0198	that cross over
S0192	you may have find that they never truly leave the sea
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	they just kind of be a bite land sea base and then kind of go back in
S0198	yeah they be really
S0230	ladies run around
S0192	do you know there be
S0198	yeah you get worry about a centipede come towards you imagine a bloody whale come down
