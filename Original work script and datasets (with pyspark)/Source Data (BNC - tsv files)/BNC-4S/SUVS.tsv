S0617	yeah
S0614	okay that's
S0617	like i say it be just drag out

S0617	i be ask what will happen to her if they catch her
S0525	oh yeah
S0617	they say she will go to prison now because she's do it on this she's do it on various occasion
S0614	right
S0617	she must be a know offender
S0525	she might already have be a know offender when they they didn't know who she be they didn't they couldn't tell from
S0617	they didn't tell me that
S0525	she might they might do a crimewatch series on it you know they do crimewatch when they re enact to see do you see this person do you know this person and then they show the they show the picture
S0617	oh it go onto all like the want page there
S0525	yeah the police database the police will know
S0617	yeah and like i say they have get intelligence that work in the or around the
S0614	yeah yeah they'll but i i assume they will have cameras in the look at the public come in and out
S0617	yeah
S0614	and they'll be look for people like that won't they now
S0617	yeah yeah
S0525	they'll be monitor it
S0617	yeah like i say i don't know who they probably won't come
S0525	you'd recognise her if she come in the store again though would you
S0617	yeah
S0525	yeah
S0614	you see the thing be she'll probably go somewhere else now another centre i mean dudley or sheffield or manchester
S0525	well that's right yeah reckon she won't because she doesn't reckon she'll travel that far
S0617	no
S0525	you didn't think do you
S0617	even the policeman say they just buy the they just steal them to buy drug so he be very narrow mind like you say
S0525	oh well he's in the job he know do you tell him where he may get the drug do you mention
S0617	mum
S0525	any of your so call friends that have legitimate businesses which you think be somehow covert operations

S0614	no
S0525	no good for you they be nice policemen be they
S0617	yeah
S0525	they know you be new to this
S0617	i guess so yeah
S0525	they treat you nicely
S0617	okay one of them just didn't really talk because he be too stress i think
S0614	because he'd take
S0525	you didn't have to walk past row of prisoners which be your worry
S0617	no no
S0525	no cells no people be it a busy police station they weren't let out the drunks from the night before when you arrive
S0617	i didn't see anybody criminal wise
S0614	good
S0525	no criminals how would you have recognise one
S0617	no no i didn't see any other person other than the police officer and me
S0525	good
S0614	when i be stand for boot erm i don't know if it be in er in that's right they've get another the chemist there you know they er they quite often bring er obviously prisoners with prison guard handcuff to them
S0617	yes
S0614	for treatment so whether they be on drug
S0525	oh really
S0614	or whatever or they be there they they have come for their medication or whatever they they walk into the er into the hospital or the pharmacist
S0617	mm
S0525	at

S0617	he doesn't even work for
S0525	oh i erm view my bill online today which i never normally do
S0614	ah dear
S0525	i think i'll have a look at this cos i have erm a a couple of texts right this will make this i i think what be this yesterday be here right so i get let me just read this to you who send me a whatsapp
S0614	who have
S0525	oh right erm let's find it so this text say right your friends and family forty percent plan charge discount have be remove
S0641	okay
S0525	from your next bill date you will pay the erm plan charge in full remember to use to check your charge follow by at the same time good news your friends and family discount be now set up you will get forty percent off your plan charge every month on your bill remember to use to check your bill so i just think oh okay that that come through together yesterday so today i have your bill be ready to view so i i i never normally bother but i log onto it and it be ten ninety nine so that's really good so they've so they've give me the twenty one ninety nine as the new full price
S0641	mm
S0617	obviously they've get
S0525	obviously take friends and family into it then ten ninety nine there be a thirty seven pence for some random photo i think well i be not go to query that and then erm and then they put the vat on
S0641	so be ten ninety nine be that forty percent or be that just
S0525	well i don't know what it be but no no it's
S0614	it's half what
S0617	ten ninety nine that's ridiculous
S0525	that's actually more than forty percent because my i'm sure she tell me my bill be go to be twenty one ninety nine they've now apply a discount ten ninety nine plus vat so it come to thirteen it come to about just over thirteen pound now
S0617	for an iphone six
S0525	so i be very please with that
S0614	which be half of what we be pay
S0525	yes so obviously query it you know because it be weird cos i'm say to her oh my friends and family discount have finish so i i can't afford to pay
S0617	i think you tell me you didn't tell her it be finish
S0525	no no i yeah i do no when i phone her i say to her in good faith my friends and family discount erm apparently have be be go to be cancel from today because i get the year wrong
S0614	two thousand sixteen
S0617	yeah
S0525	gonna be cancel from today i can't afford the forty one forty two pound whatever it be you know what what be my options i just put it to her like that and she go away oh well you know you be on a very expensive charge she say actually a very expensive plan for only one gig of blah blah blah i say well i'm pay off the phone aren't i
S0525	she say erm no she say well yeah but it it be expensive she go it it vary at ee from week to week she go you can have a really good deal one week and the next week it's slash and the follow week it's double again
S0617	be that true
S0525	that's what this woman say
S0641	mm not really
S0525	and it follow by we be not suppose to do this and we wouldn't do it for anybody else you know the standard line but for you who i've be speak to for thirty second now and feel i know very well erm because i just say well what be my options do i have to give my phone back because i can't afford this she say we'll take it down to twenty one ninety nine so i say oh so i'm pay more or less what i'm pay before because the funny thing be she say to me at the start of this she say right i've get some security question think very carefully about your answer because if you give me an incorrect answer we have to end the call i go oh so first of all she say what be the total of your last bill roughly i didn't know i say what be he go i don't know so i go twenty four pound i don't know she go yes that's fine then she say do you set up your store your plan online in store or somewhere else and i i say i don't know what do you do
S0617	in store
S0641	i seem to remember her come in
S0525	well i do i sort of remember go in i do go in didn't i i remember that so i say in store so that be right then be there another question i just think crikey anyway so after she'd ask me all of that and then she talk to me but yes so so
S0617	when i call up there's always a password that you need to answer that you set up and i don't ever know what my password be and still wouldn't know
S0525	do she ask me a
S0525	don't think i don't think she i don't think she ask me a password on this one because i wouldn't know what the password be
S0614	you might not even have one
S0525	but it be the way she say she say think carefully
S0617	i've definitely get one but
S0525	because if you get it wrong we have to take your first answer and if it's wrong we have to end the call woah there's no like three strike and you be out nothing like that so erm
S0614	pretty easy then ask you other question then to to er
S0525	i know anyway
S0614	prove you be not that person or you be that person surely
S0525	i say to her i say to her anyway erm i i can't pay whatever it be she go and i so i say what's my bill go up to she say well it's get forty one ninety nine or forty two whatever it be that's what your bill be i think she mean that's what it be go up to that's obviously clearly what's on the account then they take the discount like you say i didn't really know how it work so she say that's what it say so i can't pay that it be very high she say for your one gig then she look at she be go to take me down to less data but she go oh you be only on one gig that's low anyway
S0617	do she know what phone you've get
S0525	i say i'd get a iphone six i tell her all this i i be be quite upfront i think my you know it be all expire so she say well i i i can put you down to twenty one ninety nine i say so that's what i'm pay anyway with the friends and family discount and she's just go yes to that so
S0525	i i think we be on different wavelengths because she go i say well okay and she say you can have another contract she go it tell you when online but probably about december time you can go onto if you be happy with your phone you can do a sim only but probably not until december she go it will tell you if you if you log onto your account i go oh okay then so we leave it there and then i have these and she go that'll happen on the twenty eighth which be the day later then i have those two texts which confuse me because you say they apply the discount after oh i didn't think i be have one
S0641	mm
S0525	anyway there we be log into the account ten ninety nine plus vat happy days so completely by fluke i seem to have halve it again
S0614	do that again and it'll
S0525	so
S0614	it will be down to five quid like mum
S0617	well yeah
S0641	i think yes it's work out really good
S0525	so it be worth well it be worth a phone i be just say it be worth a phone call
S0641	i'm still a bite sceptical though i i wouldn't hold your breath but i'd see what your next bill come in at
S0525	oh okay alright then
S0641	because i don't know what incentive she'd have to there's no obvious incentive or commission for her to save you money if you be tie into a contract i don't know why she would
S0617	but when i use to have a mobile when i have a phone before we be on this
S0525	it's be twelve i'm half way in aren't i she be
S0617	me and me we've always call and get them lower
S0641	mm
S0525	why be you eat that with your finger that's disgust
S0617	we have and i know what you mean about there's no incentive for them and i know you've work there but we i've i've always get my phone and then you get yours lower as well
S0525	because what's
S0641	yeah but if you if you find an iphone six for twenty two pound a month you couldn't find that on the internet anywhere that's impossible
S0525	no no i i be completely happy with the deal don't get me wrong and when she say twenty one ninety nine i think well that's more or less what i'm but i'm happy i'm really happy with the deal
S0641	mm
S0617	seem to think it be not a deal though he think you be lose out
S0641	i'm er yeah i'm a bite sceptical yeah no i think yeah it's it's work out really well but i think there's no way i could i don't know why anyone i don't anyone that would be able to offer that price it's almost too good to be true
S0617	yeah but there's something else behind the the background he think
S0525	well i but i also say now so what's to stop me cancel my direct debit i can't afford this price so she put it up to forty one cancel it
S0641	yeah but you'll get a bad credit rat you won't be able to get any finance
S0525	well i do say that yeah yeah you get a bad credit rat but if you be not look for finance i could get this phone unlock and get a sim only for next to nothing
S0641	you'd get a erm a county court judgement against you and everything they be pretty they be pretty harsh
S0525	oh would you you would right okay
S0617	i'll be do witness about you
S0525	well i well i i i wonder that and i the first thing i say
S0614	no no no no
S0525	to to your dad on the on the car when i be at i say oh i imagine if you do just do that you'd get erm a credit a ccj against you which you wouldn't want
S0641	people people that have like miss default payments like a pound from five years ago i can't remember what and all sort
S0525	seriously
S0641	really really really get fail by every mortgage provider because she take a phone
S0617	's mum
S0641	take a phone contract out on behalf of someone's name
S0525	oh you tell me that yeah and it didn't yeah yeah
S0641	and default
S0525	well i'm i'm amaze but that tell me this month it's thirteen pound
S0641	mm
S0525	something
S0641	very good very very good
S0617	yeah
S0525	that's why i'm amaze also i get through straight because when you when you phone
S0617	have it come out then that thirteen pound
S0525	it's come out on the eighth it say but when when you when you phone up i do the one five 0 and and and it ring and it say erm yeah you be in a queue if you would like to pay fifty p we can reprioritise to the top of the queue i think as you can wait a long wait and then they answer straightaway and this be this be saturday night on the way to and i be go out for a meal i think okay and
S0525	and and this woman straightaway look and go oh and instantly drop it because i just say you know i've i've lose my friends and family discount this be you know you've get the price of forty one i can't afford it what be my options
S0641	mm
S0525	you know cos
S0641	be it the retentions department or be it just general customer service
S0617	general
S0525	one five 0 i don't i don't know whatever
S0617	that's what we always use to call
S0525	i just do one five 0 and get through to speak to a person talk about the bill
S0617	before i have friends and family discount with you i i wasn't pay full
S0641	yes but
S0617	i be always pay the discount price
S0641	you'd never ever ever have get an iphone six for twenty two pound it's just not
S0617	i reckon if i call mine up today
S0525	no no you wouldn't would you
S0617	if i if i call them up tonight i reckon they'll put it down
S0641	i bet you i bet you couldn't get it to twenty two pound
S0617	i put it i'll call them up then
S0641	try it
S0617	shall i call them and see
S0525	you should do because you i couldn't believe that
S0617	i hope it doesn't mess up my friends and family though
S0614	well it sound it almost sound as though that will
S0525	well that i i didn't
S0617	it will mess it up won't it
S0641	yours will because yours be from someone that's gonna be in the company for quite a while so i wouldn't do it with yours really but
S0525	ah
S0641	i think it's really good and i think it's
S0525	somebody who's in the company for a while
S0617	because i'm not on i'm with a different person
S0641	yeah with like
S0525	well like i say i genuinely believe it be run out on that day because this this all this be do before i speak to you
S0641	yeah yeah
S0525	on on saturday night if i'd have speak to you on saturday night and i'd have read that i'd have go oh that's fine i only
S0641	maybe erm
S0525	i only do it because i think i be go up to forty two pound a month that be the only reason for do it
S0641	mm yeah
S0525	and now to come down to that so but i won't have affect anybody because that be that one be give to you by some guy that be leave wasn't it and you've get a a last
S0641	oh no not at all not at all yes
S0525	yeah yeah
S0614	do she go away in erm
S0525	but be it in your name though be it in your
S0641	it be now yeah it transfer over because i owe him one so
S0525	to to to your name but
S0641	it's complicate how it work
S0525	but i you know all i say be i i'm lose it and i can't afford this price she go oh yes it's it's show us forty one or whatever on your account i'll put it down to this then that text come through a day later two days later say your friends and family discount have be set up
S0641	it's it's yeah it's weird i i don't know what the yeah i think if it's come off though it's really good
S0525	but i think well let's just see what happen to that for a little while erm but if i'd have speak to you and because i send you that message and you'd say oh we'll look at it in a year and i think
S0641	i bet you i bet you sort of think a year
S0525	i though i think well i do i think
S0641	come on
S0525	i think well okay that
S0641	i know you be busy but
S0525	yeah no i think i think well that might work for you i think but i actually can't afford to pay full price for a year or i don't really want to pay a full price for a year so it be who say i say well i say to she go well just phone them she say i'm sure it's the one one five 0 number so erm because i never phone i think i can't be bother but that be complete
S0614	well you usually sit on the line for age wait so you give up
S0525	yeah yeah normally yeah and i'd have give up and you'd have say and i would have go oh well that's fine then but that be really strange
S0641	i think it's yeah
S0525	so let's see yeah like you say let's see
S0641	finger cross it's fool them off but it just baffle me how it's happen and why it's happen that a general customer service
S0525	but it say and it's the fact they've set up the friends and family what do that erm
S0641	maybe it be her last day and she felt generous or something
S0525	no who i don't i don't it's the way it's set up
S0614	she er want a well she hadn't complete her quota so therefore you get the the luck of the draw
S0525	it be the fact what be that one before friends ee oh yeah that's so that's the one i get yeah which you've get and i didn't read the year which be twenty seventeen i'd assume it be
S0641	yeah easily do because obviously twenty seventh be the same day as it just i mean that be just pure coincidence
S0525	twenty seventh be the be the day it come through so i yeah i think so i didn't even read the year and then yesterday so that that be when on saturday so then on monday they come through back to back
S0617	dad have you still get no yoghurts
S0614	yoghurts i might be able to get some tonight get the chicken okay
S0617	okay yeah
S0614	i'll see how much i've get
S0525	after i'd already change my plan i think i think what's that
S0641	and then once this one
S0525	that come through
S0641	okay
S0525	and then i think oh so i log on
S0641	be that the same bill date as normal
S0525	be it the eighth of the month be that the same
S0614	i can't remember how to do this
S0525	well shall i log onto my bill
S0641	yeah let's have a look
S0525	i do this and i think well i'll log onto that bill just to see in cos you the first thing you say be have they apply the discount i think well i wasn't ask for a discount so i assume it expire on that day
S0641	yeah
S0614	don't er
S0525	so hang on we've just get half half an hour of new oh no extra slow internet er log log in there be it
S0641	yeah
S0525	sorry we couldn't find this page
S0641	i think you need to flick onto your 4g to erm make it easier to log in sometimes
S0525	oh do it oh hang on it's it's do something oh here we go erm right let's let's there be some random amount for some photo send abroad which i don't remember but i think i'm not gonna i'm not gonna query that consider consider how low the bill be i'll let the thrirty seven p go
S0641	yeah
S0614	yes so you start query things and they look into it a bite further
S0525	do that say i can't do that say my name yeah
S0641	yes i think if you genuinely have get halfway through your contract and you've manage to get your iphone at twelve pound a month that's ludicrous isn't it i think it's crazy
S0525	oh yes absolutely yeah
S0641	even at twenty two it's unheard of
S0525	well for yeah for an iphone six i'm perfectly happy with this don't don't get me wrong and i'd have pay the family and friends discount for another twelve months happily
S0641	that's crazy
S0525	look at that it's say that's the amount that's go to come out so it's say oh like so a gig leave of data so i've not use any
S0641	i think it refresh today
S0525	oh i see oh right okay so oh so it refresh so it say extra charge nothing but it have it have thirty seven p on that earlier so have it have it have it go back to the old
S0641	yeah it must be this be the new bill now i guess
S0525	oh so can you see the last one
S0641	yeah i'll just er no
S0525	what happen then
S0641	something unexpected happen
S0525	something
S0614	so you be now pay
S0641	yeah
S0525	you see so yeah because this
S0614	we've not make in error
S0525	earlier it's change it because earlier today it have the thirty seven p and the bill itemise that it have that one itemise but
S0614	yeah it's fine look
S0525	obviously this one
S0614	previous bill history
S0525	oh
S0641	your monthly plan ten ninety nine
S0525	yeah ten ninety nine so it's put that thirty seven whatever that be and and and put the vat on oh i didn't go into that much detail what do that say i can't even read that it's too small
S0614	your contract will terminate in ten days
S0525	and will be fin
S0614	will be sack oh he's already go
S0641	yeah
S0525	have you phone
S0617	no just say not
S0525	oh oh yes because you be on a different person mm
S0614	how much do you pay again
S0617	twenty eight pound
S0525	you pay more than me cos you have more erm allowance and you have bigger data allowance
S0617	yeah
S0641	i don't know how this have happen i think i think it's crazy yeah because you it be correct it be
S0525	be you impress with that be we be we mega impress with this ten
S0617	if if i call them up i'd get discount i don't know why this be what we use to do all the time
S0614	i pay yeah but
S0641	yes but this be
S0617	honestly
S0641	okay
S0614	have get a new
S0641	why didn't you do it last month then
S0617	huh
S0641	why didn't you do it last month then
S0617	i don't know why i just think
S0641	why didn't you do it a month after you take out your contract
S0617	i just think i wouldn't do it because we're on friends and family on it
S0525	because we we be all happy with the friends and the family we be think we obviously we're get a good deal because we be on that but now
S0617	yeah you do there
S0641	really good very impressive
S0525	so
S0617	go on mum
S0525	like i say completely by luck than judgement but if that's what they be say
S0641	yes it it say your plan be mean to be twenty one ninety nine
S0525	oh it say that oh okay
S0641	and then you've get your friends and family
S0525	there we be so
S0641	but maybe because she's remove it now it'll come off next month i don't know
S0525	well no because the email say they'd just set it up
S0641	mm
S0525	the email say your friends and family be set up for it
S0641	it's weird isn't it
S0525	and because the friends and family doesn't end now until twenty seventeen i'm hop this will go on for twelve months but we'll see i'll look at it next month and we'll see
S0641	no it look it look good it look like it's fine i think er

S0525	yes
S0614	too late
S0525	i find him a job i find him a job which take him out of the house for three days a week well that's a bonus
S0617	three day every week
S0525	yeah every week forever
S0614	i offer a bite of help with his his project he's get go on there so erm and he's he's finally come back and say well look we'll go next do next week flog pip and clean out some er pip and stuff like that really erm and he's get like about sixteen consecutive days of and these pip come in which he need some help with so
S0617	so how many weeks be you go to do it for
S0614	well i'll do the first few days and see how we go know him it will all change
S0617	yeah yeah
S0614	yeah so we'll we'll start off next week that's the plan
S0617	so what day do you go
S0614	i don't know what he's go to arrange whether
S0617	be you get the the plane
S0614	or we might drive i think he say
S0617	oh be he back here now be he
S0525	who know where he be
S0614	i don't know where he be erm
S0525	you drive up be fine but once you be up there you be go to need a car cos you can't take yours on site it will get completely wreck also it won't cope because you need erm
S0641	be that the vw
S0525	you need
S0614	practice on the
S0525	the st giles golf that's a good idea you can't take yours on site there's no chance
S0614	no this be just the first shipment this be apparently there's others there's another one come after that so no there'll be a few potentially a few days' work involve which erm i don't mind i've get a bite of spare time i can do it
S0641	why scotland
S0614	yeah that's where the job be
S0641	oh okay
S0614	they're deliver up there
S0525	but the next one they get in erm should be local so if you if you get on well with this and you know what you be do then he can send you on that he will be train you up on canusa next to do canusa demonstrations then you'll be a real asset
S0614	really
S0525	you will be heat up pipe and wrap it
S0614	yeah
S0641	so be it quite physical involve
S0525	no
S0641	no
S0614	well he he be tell me
S0614	i no i've i've never do it but apparently they they make note of the
S0525	i have be in charge of people do it for many years
S0614	of the pipe number
S0641	yeah
S0614	because that's what the the other people the the the er they deal with and the contractors sign for to say they've have these pipe number and one of them would come back and dispute they've have them or not have them so but if we've get somebody there from our side say yes you have have them
S0641	oh okay
S0614	and there's a picture of what you've have blah blah blah then it save work in dispute
S0525	they get a wagon turn up and the wagon because these pip be erm hundred and twenty mil diameter thirteen and a half metres long
S0614	they be big pip
S0525	so they'll get they'll get four of these pip on a wagon and you'd probably get between four and six wagons a day turn up because they take two hours to offload these four pip they've get this clever device which have get these suction cap on that lift them up and plonk them down and then they they lay them out in a in a line so they be ready to be roll into the trench and put together erm or they use a crane offload so it just take a long time to offload this sort of pipe you've get to take all the tie off hold it on the wagon cos it's be transport by road so it's a big job so you've get maybe twenty to twenty eight pip turn up a day erm and all you've get to do so it's it's not high you know it's not a lot it's not like your leggings where you've get hundreds a day you've get maybe twenty piece and each one have get a pipe number on the end and you've just get to write the pipe number down on the delivery note and get somebody in charge to sign it so that they'll pay for it
S0641	mm
S0525	and every pipe number be traceable back to the production process in turkey or holland because i think they be be make in turkey then they've go to holland to be coat and line then they've go to site so if any of these pip fail over the next twenty years what they'll do be they'll dig it up they'll find the give the pipe number and they will want to trace it back and they might say oh there be a problem with that that batch
S0641	oh check that
S0525	yeah but there may be a
S0525	there may be a production problem
S0614	where be he now
S0525	and if they find there be a production
S0641	in the caribbean
S0525	it be like anything if they find there be a there be a production problem with a batch then they'll want to identify every pipe number in that batch to say you might have potential problems
S0641	a batch problem yeah
S0525	and we've have it we've have it in the twenty years we have be deal with these pip
S0641	it happen doesn't it
S0525	yeah so that's what it's for but then the other problem be the pipe number be normally handwritten on so when they start in turkey it's a six digit number usually maybe eight digits write on this pipe and then they go and get coat and that it's go over so somebody have somebody's write it down it have go into the coat plant and it's come out they've write it back on so you've get human error there because somebody somebody at pay five pound an hour be not gonna write the right number on then you've get the fact that the ones be do like that with the sevens
S0614	seven
S0525	get a line through it and the nines they do like that which look like fours to us so nines and fours ones and sevens
S0614	oh right yeah
S0525	so it's you know it's always gonna be fraught with
S0614	but for some reason apparently there's a there's a bite of erm wash of the pip or inside of them whether something get inside or something but they apparently they
S0525	well each each pipe each thirteen and a half metre pipe's suppose to have a a cap on it on the end of it a so people can't get in because i mean that's that's a big
S0525	oh we've have yeah we've have immigrants try and get in these pip to be ship over
S0525	so they have these cap on so it's seal but by the time they get there you can say probably twenty twenty five twenty five percent maybe
S0525	have come off so they be say right it's dirty inside it's get x y z but dirty inside doesn't matter because once they've lay this pipeline underground they have to blast it to clean it anyway cos cos it's get drink water
S0614	clean it sterilise it
S0525	go through it so they have to give it so it doesn't really so i can't quite understand i think this this need on this job for say you've get to clean every pipe be pointless because i think it's just erm a stall tactic for payments so there's go to be the a team on it then and
S0614	yeah
S0641	so definitely
S0614	it's not long sixteen sixteen days' work do in four surely
S0525	no do in sixteen years know
S0617	so you're go next week for how many days or don't you know
S0614	i don't know exactly now but probably it's wednesday thursday friday
S0617	how be you go to get your car there
S0614	at the moment i don't know when i be go it could be tuesday night could be wednesday morning but that's the plan but that could all change
S0525	excite in glasgow
S0614	yeah be alright
S0525	good
S0614	that's alright
S0525	say that erm have offer to go
S0614	yeah you be right who
S0525	in the office the fat guy but ignore him think be go just do it by himself now think nobody would go i say well he can't just give you twelve hours' notice like he do on wednesday night and say can you book the next available flight up on thursday well actually no can you give me some detail and we can
S0614	we don't know where to go
S0525	well yeah just book a flight to glasgow get on the next one
S0614	on the first flight
S0525	no not really
S0614	which one i'm in paris where be you oh in glasgow oops
S0641	do he do a lot of travel for work be he or not not so much any more
S0525	erm i it depend when the job come in but our erm work use to go in they call it amp phase asset to management periods and it go every four years so the water industry have a four year period and so in year one they would decide all the job that be go to be do year two they'd start place the contract and give it go out to tender year three they'd start buy they'd be buy well end of year two and three they'd be buy them they'd be you know they'd award the tender they'd be spend the money on it blah blah blah year four would be a massive cut back to make sure they weren't over spend on their budget so year two and three be your profitable years on an amp period and i think do say they be in year they they be in that stage now in that stage where these job be come up and the money be come in but you always know it's go in a cycle you be go to have a couple of years where it's go to be quieter and the money be not go to come in but of course when that happen you know get rid of everybody think he can't afford to keep employ people for the sake of it if there's no more business and now it's happen he's get the job and they've get no people leave because normally you know you don't send the md up to offload pip off a wagon
S0641	no
S0525	because i mean they use to say to him well you know well who who be you what be you do here he'd go well i'm the md of oh of oh oh and then there would be a bite more kudos and a bite more oh blimey they've send the md up you know this be and it will be a and he and he always like that but on the whole no why would you expect to see the md of a company
S0641	they can't believe it no
S0525	no it isn't need he should have people do that and it's a bite of erm an idiot's job to be honest you've only get to write you've only get to look at the pipe number and also
S0617	be you call dad an idiot
S0525	no but but but your dad's never but your dad's never
S0614	but he be
S0525	well he be but your dad's your dad's never do the job so you don't require any train for the job anybody can go out there and do it but the other thing i say you know to to do things like idiots don't realise if that wagon turn up so you've get your transport company and they arrive and your transport company be allow two hours for offload and after that they charge you what's call demurrage wait time
S0641	be it really extortionate as well
S0525	yeah and it's extortionate so if you've if you've if you've go over your two hours then they say right you know this be cost the driver sit there feet up cup of tea and and just put the the clock on basically and and then and they bill you
S0641	not bother yeah
S0617	and you have to pay them
S0525	yeah and that happen for the crane might break down the offload you know it's not to do with the wagon it's the crane's break down something's happen to the site they've all have to disappear health and safety reason there'll be something go on all the time it happen erm but then the transport company try it on and they'd like put hours and hours on demurrage well if you've have your own person on site you can say actually we have half an hour there we have two hours there right so we be not accept ten hours
S0641	yeah
S0525	we be accept two and a half hours and i say that's another thing you've you've get to clock
S0614	just keep in mind
S0525	yeah and and and make a note yourself because if you've get somebody on site you be clock that yourself and you've also get the guy in the wagon and you let him know you be clock it and then they don't
S0641	they won't take the mick
S0525	yeah and it's things like that that just add up because these be i mean this be a four million pound job so everybody try to
S0641	get a few extra quid here and there
S0525	of course they do
S0614	they're just all company aren't they try to make
S0525	of course they do
S0641	at it use to be about fifty pound an hour for that
S0525	demurrage
S0641	yeah
S0525	yeah
S0641	that's what i'm say and it soon add up
S0525	yeah yeah yeah
S0641	doesn't it if your lorry have break down for five hours
S0525	yeah that's right
S0641	that's two hundred and fifty quid for crazy
S0525	yeah that's it so if you've get you know and if you use company that you use a lot and you know you've get a good relationship with them then you know that they be probably okay but if you be use company that be local up there you they be go to put in everything they can get away with especially if they think you you don't know
S0617	be there a
S0641	of course they be of course they be
S0525	and you've get so many different people on site on a job like that that nobody be will to say weli i know
S0641	for your alibi
S0525	yeah nobody be will they just pass the buck and say oh you've just get to erm accept it so it's the that's that's the reason i mean we never use to have people on site for these job but then we never get pay unless we've not have them and but if we now provide a sign their sign delivery note with an invoice your guy have sign that you've have those four pip pay it oh then that's what you've get to do sign it
S0641	rather than just take their word and then
S0525	sign for every single pipe that come off that wagon
S0641	mm
S0525	that's what they've get to do
S0641	it's a shame it's get like that isn't it
S0525	but it do because they they they be pay probably eighty percent maybe eighty five percent of the value of this four million pound contract they be pay eighty five percent before it get deliver to site that's be agree it's be so as soon as it arrive in the uk they pay that
S0617	do you call grandma
S0614	i've already do you want some yoghurts
S0617	i need some too
S0525	that fifteen percent they will pay once it get to site and you give them the net thirty days but that fifteen percent somebody at in finance be think oh this be this be our save we can make we can save fifteen percent here because we can stall it we can say and and that and that fifteen percent be our profit so that they be look to save it we're look that's our money
S0641	yeah so both ways be try to do things
S0525	yeah and we and we've we've come across it time and time again and the only way to get round it be to have somebody on site twenty four seven and even then they'll they'll still query it but you know you've get the proof and if you be go to take it to court they've get very little place to go
S0641	yeah
S0525	so we've just learn that over the years because we think well great they'll pay the fifteen percent and then they come up with the demurrage and they come up with this and they come up that they haven't get the pip i think well you've have that pipe number three time well we guess because you can't read the number properly so we be not pay for that pipe three you know but you know you've have that many pip so yeah the number might be wrong but you've agree you've have you know five hundred pip oh it just go on it go round and round in circle
S0641	experience though i guess
S0614	last chance for anybody to come
S0617	no thank dad
S0525	say hi
S0641	say hi
S0614	see you later i'll get some chicken and yoghurts on the way back
S0617	thank you
S0614	anybody want anything else

S0525	mm
S0641	but eat more healthy rather than
S0525	protein and that so what what stuff what what have you cook you do the ginger beef what else do you do
S0641	erm i don't know if you've hear of him but there's er someone call the body coach at the moment which be quite popular and his er his cookbook's be out for about a month and he's sell like four hundred thousand copy it's really

S0641	just healthy eat
S0614	some dent metal in my my way
S0614	there's a pile of scrap metal in the way of my car
S0525	that's not a very nice way to refer to 's car be it
S0641	no that's not very nice
S0525	i'm just learn about the body coach you you need to tell me about about this guy
S0641	yeah he's good he's on the erm yeah he's make it on social media and now it's really popular but
S0525	have you have you have his recipes

S0617	i doubt it if it's mother's day actually
S0525	well can we make a decision because we need to know i don't know whether to make a chocolate bread and butter pudding what be that yuck don't you like it
S0617	no but yeah make that that's fine
S0525	well that only serve six
S0617	or
S0525	or a banoffee pie which serve probably ten
S0617	mm
S0525	well maybe six when you cut the portion i didn't know what to make and then i think well it depend if if how many of us there's go to be here he be
S0617	i doubt will come
S0525	it's probably not on the body coach's recommend foods anyway
S0617	banoffee pie
S0525	we're just talk about sunday
S0617	you be with your mum won't you
S0525	on sunday be you go to mum's
S0641	sunday
S0617	it's mother's day
S0525	it's mother's day
S0641	oh i guess so yes
S0617	yeah you will be with your mum
S0641	yes i will be yes
S0525	so you don't want lunch around here cos we will be do lunch
S0641	okay no thank you
S0525	right because i'm just wonder whether to make
S0617	to be fair will probably be in bed so why don't you do dinner for her
S0641	oh
S0525	oh it's go to be either chocolate bread and butter pudding or banoffee pie so i didn't know but if
S0617	well it's true though isn't it it sound awful
S0525	yes i know but you be not come so it doesn't matter
S0641	no i won't sorry
S0525	have you get the recipe for banoffee pie make your mother a banoffee pie do she like it
S0617	yeah that would be nice
S0525	it be so easy
S0641	yeah i could do actually
S0617	that would be really good what be you go to
S0525	do you want to take one
S0641	i will cook for her actually er but she be vegetarian isn't she
S0617	well i be go to say
S0525	i know well banoffee pie
S0641	she start eat meat actually now and then
S0525	oh what do you mean now and then
S0641	well she go to she's be go she's be vegetarian for about a year and a half then she go to new york with
S0525	yeah
S0617	she eat meat in new york
S0525	do she
S0641	yeah
S0617	be that do you reckon why she be grumpy
S0641	maybe
S0525	oh
S0641	yeah she she's i think i think don't
S0617	because she hasn't eat meat for age so if she eat it then that's probably like change the
S0641	it's be a good year and a half she go all through christmas with no turkey
S0617	that's probably why she be
S0525	oh right
S0641	and i don't think
S0617	i reckon it be the change in diet
S0641	alright
S0617	i'm gonna tell her
S0525	oh
S0641	oh
S0525	oh controversial
S0641	i don't think her body react too well to it i think it mess her around a bite because imagine not eat meat for a year and a half
S0525	no no that well yeah yeah that's right
S0617	what do she eat in new york
S0641	erm
S0525	chicken wing sausages burgers
S0641	yeah yeah bacon and steak and stuff
S0617	so go all out
S0525	why
S0641	i don't think i i don't think there be that many vegetarian options and i think she i don't know why actually because start since christmas fold but
S0617	she have turkey with you didn't she
S0525	oh i didn't realise be vegetarian as well
S0641	mm only only for about six months though
S0525	yeah it's funny because next door do you remember she be vegetarian for years and years and it be suddenly one barbecue and she go i really fancy a sausage you probably don't remember and she just eat it and we be all like but you're you've be vegetarian for like ten fifteen years she say i really fancy a sausage and she eat it and after that she just start eat meat and she didn't no nobody have a problem with it you know you you can you can stop you can start it's it's it's everybody's choice but it be a weird one for her to suddenly do it and we be like
S0617	i want a sausage
S0525	yeah there be one barbecue and just decide that be that back on meat just like that i think okay
S0641	it be weird isn't it
S0525	yeah
S0641	i mean and my mum they have both cut out meat
S0525	for reason they didn't like it or reason for
S0641	i think it's just i think it's just they think it's over produce i think obviously it's natural to eat meat of course it be but i think the way we mass produce it and mass slaughter i think we over produce
S0617	yeah think we eat too much
S0525	well well we we probably do because i like a vegetarian meal of a week and your dad be always like oh
S0617	the thing be dad like them
S0525	that that he'll eat it now but normally you don't tell him there's no that cannelloni the i do there's no meat in that
S0617	yeah i know
S0525	and that's a really nice and fill and i use to do quite a lot of pasta dish without meat
S0617	but he's the same though he'll never have it
S0525	you yeah but you say straightaway i'm not give well don't do cannelloni if be come because erm he's go to know there's no meat in it
S0641	hold on i wouldn't do that
S0617	yeah you you wouldn't want it if there's no meat in there
S0525	he would he'd eat it
S0641	i would yeah
S0525	and he might not even notice as they be as fill as they be
S0641	yeah since my mum's be back now she's be er she's come for an indian every so often and she's have chicken curry
S0617	oh yeah you take her for an indian didn't you and i didn't even ask what she have
S0525	yeah okay good for her
S0641	oh yeah she's be i think she's be for an indian and stuff and she's have vegetarian
S0641	options or like a

S0617	no
S0641	she'll she'll she'll have some salmon in the fridge and just fry up some salmon and some veg
S0525	yeah
S0641	which take ten minutes but a lot of the time she'll just have
S0617	sandwich
S0641	yeah so many time
S0525	because it's it's quick quick meal just for her
S0641	she sometimes doesn't get back from work till seven eight o'clock do she
S0525	mm
S0641	then she walk the dog
S0525	she never put a meal in the oven set the timer put the slow cooker on then do
S0641	no she use to when we be kid and stuff but
S0525	oh i suppose when yeah
S0641	then when she
S0525	it's just her now isn't it that she's cook for
S0617	be not there
S0525	mm
S0617	you be kind of at work and then do your own thing and i don't know it's just just different isn't it a different way of
S0641	and then obviously when she be erm she she stop when i be about nineteen she didn't do meals at all really i think
S0525	mm
S0641	at that age she be that happy with obviously my dad and stuff but erm
S0525	yeah
S0641	yeah she just she never cook now do she really
S0525	oh okay
S0641	it's really weird she just
S0525	she doesn't enjoy it doesn't want to do it
S0641	no i mean she have quite good lunch because obviously she work in a school and they've get an independent canteen
S0525	oh she have do she have the school dinners there
S0641	mm
S0525	do she go for the school dinners
S0641	i think so
S0525	yeah well they're they're heavily subsidise so probably a good good thing to have and then yeah
S0641	yep
S0525	have your main meal then have a have a snack later
S0641	well she's take she take on her own cater team so it's not through it's a private cater team because she don't
S0525	right
S0641	they they haven't do it through erm the council
S0525	mm
S0641	and i think they've get really good competitive healthy meals now
S0525	oh right
S0641	they actually make a profit on their school dinners which not many school do
S0525	no
S0641	mm she source all the ingredients from local erm the butcher do
S0525	that's so she's responsible for that because she do she do all the finance doesn't she there the budget
S0641	yes she's like she's just the business manager of the school
S0525	yeah
S0641	take on their own private cleaners she basically do nothing for council any more because i think it's not as competitive i think a lot of private firm be much better
S0525	oh right mm
S0641	i think a lot of the company that do sort of their paper and stuff and office supply probably because they get through like thirty er ream of paper every day or something daft
S0525	really
S0641	kid there be
S0525	oh mind you they be always send letter home aren't they whether they get home or not
S0641	yeah and all the worksheets and all the

S0641	i don't know i think so i don't i don't know what she's mean to be do she i the last time i speak to her i say here's our here's our number for the vat return and she file it
S0525	oh she do okay
S0641	yeah
S0525	and you have to pay presumably now on your vat
S0641	it's a direct debit so it will just come out yeah
S0525	so you yeah you you be not get a refund any more you're
S0641	no
S0525	no you're pay
S0641	and then it's erm it's the end of the month
S0641	again so it's our vat return again now so i haven't speak to her for three months
S0525	what month be we on the third be that your vat return
S0641	so the same with jan feb
S0525	may june
S0641	mm the last one end
S0525	yeah
S0641	november
S0525	so you you give her the figure she file it and you
S0641	yeah
S0525	your payment be on direct debit
S0641	that's it yeah i don't i don't know what else
S0525	be she she's on she's run payroll for you
S0641	yeah but we haven't it's set up but we haven't do a payroll yet
S0525	no
S0641	no we haven't set that up well we do say we be probably go to do that next month
S0525	fine but so she be on that because
S0641	i'm always very conscious that if if i do contact the team she be go to rack up a large bill i don't know how it work so i'm always a bite
S0525	yeah i i wouldn't i wouldn't have think so for for a few question i i think that's go to be kind of in your annual charge
S0641	yeah
S0525	because the annual do she quote you something for do the account your year end be when july june
S0641	i'm not sure oh i really don't know
S0525	when do you register when do you when do you incorporate the company can you remember the date
S0641	i can't remember
S0525	i think well i think it's go to be around june time june or july that'll be your first bill because that'll be your annual she be charge whatever per year and that be go to include vat return paye probably a few general query
S0641	yeah i don't think i don't think we ever agree on an exact price even the paye i think it depend on how much
S0525	be it go to see well there's only the two of you go through it
S0641	well there be yeah but
S0525	i think you'd be look around seven hundred and fifty or something for your annual account with all that include for the for the year but
S0641	because i remember my friend do er like work experience in an accountants and they just use to they'd literally be in an office and say oh we don't really like him that much put another three hours of work onto his account
S0525	he be he the kpmg guy or the price
S0641	no no he he be just through a a private company
S0525	oh
S0641	but it's a big company that he train there and they do they do a lot of but it they they literally sit in the office say i don't really like him that much we'll add add three hours work onto him
S0525	well i think when it when it when it come to the year end you should you know say to listen you know what do we come up with a figure wasn't it around seven hundred and fifty we be talk about don't you know
S0641	yeah i don't think obviously i mean she won't she won't take the mick in the sense of
S0525	no i don't think no i don't i don't think will but like i say i don't really have anything to do with her now but i mean i use to erm but she do she'll she'll do a proper job
S0641	i'm guess she's get all our data in that account so i guess she'll
S0525	yes yeah yeah
S0641	prompt her i suppose to meet up and to chase that up i would have think
S0525	mm she well she should do yeah because it's always the summer it's always kind of june july there's p eleven ds there's class one a national insurance there's various things to go on you'll also have to update your erm information at company house erm it it depend what she be go to charge because a lot of that you can do that online yourself you can do p eleven ds you can do er which generate a class one a and you can do your erm company house your what's that how how old do twenty three good old facebook
S0617	that's mum's friend her face have come up at twenty two three years age of age
S0525	oh i should be er what should i be then twenty year old
S0617	sixty three
S0525	sixty three
S0617	yeah
S0525	that's what i'll be
S0617	no i'm joke mummy
S0525	oh that's not good then no you know things like annual return have to be file every year and it's just a case of say yes this be at this address yes these be the directors yes these be the share that we hold it's just a case of confirm online and you have to pay twenty quid for the privilege because that's their charge but you don't want necessarily get to do that
S0641	yeah
S0525	but you want to start get a few a few date for that in the diary but i i i don't think she i don't think she will overcharge you for stuff i think she'll be pretty pretty good but that's the thing once you've once you've set up a limit company there's a load of legal requirements you've get to
S0641	yes
S0525	and it's good that you're pay you're pay vat to the hmrc because it mean you be make money if it's the other way generally you be lose money if they owe you so
S0641	yes yes
