S0142	ah
S0144	yeah huh
S0142	yeah
S0144	huh
S0024	funny
S0142	mm
S0144	there be some people in um since the revolution in tunisia um there's a section of society that have become a bite more radical kind of islamic because ben ali keep like on top of all that stuff
S0142	yeah
S0144	but now in er an area call la marsa where a lot of the foreigners frequent the these like extremists have kind of go in and cause quite a lot of problems aren't they
S0024	mm
S0144	and there be one girl who be wear i don't know a skirt
S0024	short the one

S0144	something like you foreign sluts you know
S0024	a weird act of yeah weird isn't it
S0144	yeah it be weird
S0024	there be there be quite a few of those things happen
S0142	the this be why the this be the fear of syria though isn't it you know they say they there be so many factions and different outlooks of thing you know group in syria
S0024	there's um there's so many different outlooks
S0142	that if they overthrow the government now
S0144	mm
S0142	which one would the un support
S0144	hmm
S0024	mm
S0142	you know the because the cos if they overthrow the government they'll all be at each other's throats it'd be like civil war
S0144	it's difficult cos you've get turkey right on their doorstep you've get israel which be right there
S0142	yeah
S0144	and you've get really strong link with iran as well so i mean this be like serious like you have to be very careful how you deal with syria
S0142	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's not like not like the others and that's why no one's do anything yet cos no one really know what the what to do
S0024	yeah
S0142	no no no that's what they say that it's no good aid the rebel because the rebel in each area of the country be totally oppose to each other
S0024	yeah
S0144	mm yeah
S0142	you know so what be you do you're arm a civil war
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0144	yeah and then you've get china and russia who be
S0142	couldn't care less in a way
S0144	yeah well they're disagree with what america be say aren't they
S0142	yeah
S0144	so that's just go to antagonise it as well
S0024	well no they disagree about go in there didn't they
S0144	yeah
S0142	mm mm
S0024	which i dunno i don't know what would be best
S0144	yeah
S0142	yeah but that yeah because their arm flow stop
S0024	oh they be oh yeah but we do it with everybody
S0144	well it's like us and libya then innit
S0142	oh yeah oh yeah yeah
S0024	we deal arm to to load of people and don't admit it
S0144	oh god yeah
S0142	we sell them to anybody
S0144	it's where a big portion of our gdp come from
S0142	mm
S0024	it's only cos our news want to say oh well that's because russia be deal with the arm that we know about it
S0144	mm hmm
S0024	otherwise it'd be all secret
S0144	mm yeah it's a big mess isn't it
S0024	it be a mess
S0144	i be watch a documentary the other day about you know those you've get problems in luton with the the edp and the the extremists they're at each other's throats
S0142	yeah bmp be it
S0144	yeah
S0142	yeah
S0144	and it be kind of look at both side of that but the muslims i've see there be completely unrecognisable to anywhere we've live it's not like the islam we know at all
S0142	that's right yeah
S0144	it's like this extremist version that exist in england
S0142	yeah
S0024	oh oh that programme oh my goodness
S0142	and that's why that's why they're in england because they wouldn't be tolerate in the countries they come from
S0024	yeah wasn't that weird that programme
S0142	cos we've take the dross from the world
S0144	mm
S0142	they've come here because they can't practise what they preach in their own countries and they're here
S0144	i dunno it be weird
S0024	yeah because there be regulations on on extremism in the muslim countries so that yeah
S0144	yeah yeah
S0142	yeah yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	it be where where be it
S0144	that be in luton
S0024	luton

S0024	and we couldn't believe it
S0144	no
S0024	well it's still difficult to believe
S0144	no it be
S0024	i i mean i almost need to go to luton to see with my own eye
S0144	but i mean the sad thing be that i be watch it kind of agree with the edp on a lot of things cos you could see where they be come from you could see the anger that be there
S0142	yeah yeah
S0144	and that's the scary thing that's what's grow in this bubble in this country these people be get more and more angry but think that represent islam but it doesn't
S0142	but i don't
S0024	and it doesn't
S0142	but i don't think they they you know because you're talk about racism in a way
S0024	yeah
S0142	erm you know not just this religious thing about muslims in luton

S0142	racism or or immigration because they're take our job etcetera blah de blah de blah now the recession be really grip

S0142	yeah
S0144	yeah and it's fuel it
S0142	yeah
S0144	and they must i don't think like they're make these stupid policies by accident they know that it's cause a lot of anger
S0024	mm
S0144	and make people more racist
S0142	mm
S0144	so there must be a reason they're do this it's not happen by chance
S0024	well yeah mm cos my mum and dad have a similar thing to that
S0142	well it take it keep the eye off the ball you're take the eye off the ball with all this aren't ya you know you're not watch what a corrupt load of bunch of thieve sod they be

S0024	ha
S0142	i mean it the but they've get that haven't they
S0143	one of these days she's gonna slap you so hard won't you darling
S0024	yep
S0143	one of these days
S0142	you know they can do that with cars to penalise people wrongdoers just like that it's automatic almost
S0144	yeah
S0142	oh that car it hasn't get an mot stop him you're fin no ifs ands and buts
S0144	yeah yeah
S0142	yep yep
S0024	look at this
S0142	yeah yeah
S0024	who's finish this
S0142	oh
S0144	who's be that
S0142	well it couldn't have be mine i would never leave that
S0144	yeah but i think there's another danger in have all of your stuff
S0142	erm
S0144	on a centralise system that be that sound quite orwellian really
S0142	well certain talk erm
S0144	where
S0142	yeah i know what you mean you've gotta be free
S0144	you get to the state where you you know you get to a
S0142	but the the police to control people by use that information but what could they use it for be your tax be your car tax insure and be it roadworthy now if what how be that orwellian by the authorities know that
S0144	well no no but once you've go the system in place it can be abuse later on for example
S0142	yeah go off this i think we're far too lay back
S0144	you can't travel on this road because you don't have the the correct authorisation
S0142	but you've get a national health number now the day you're bear you've get a number in this country haven't you
S0144	mm
S0142	they've get track of you wherever you go er because you can't get your passport um
S0144	yeah but it's become more sophisticate that's what i've get a problem with and i think it's quite scary
S0142	um mm i don't think it's use as well as it should be because cctv cameras in city centre they've save er lot of people they can spot somebody be assault mug
S0144	mm
S0142	and they're there for our protection if you look at it that way if you're a wrongdoer
S0144	mm
S0142	yeah beware but what would you ever do that you be really concern about somebody watch do when you're walk around the city
S0144	no that's not the point the point be once that system's in place
S0142	mm
S0144	it can be use for different purpose in the future once you've allow it to er get establish
S0142	mm
S0144	then later on it can really be use to oppress the people that's why i'm worry
S0142	erm if it get to that state where cctv image around city centre get to the point where it could repress people i would've think most people would have have the cameras down by then
S0144	no but that's what i mean
S0142	they'd have go arm with shotguns and they'd have blast it problem solve
S0144	no but i think most people be say what you're say how it it's it's a good thing
S0142	mm
S0144	but it's these they do things by such like little erm incremental step over such a long period of time that
S0142	yeah yeah softy softy yeah
S0144	that people don't notice it
S0142	mm
S0144	people don't question it and then before they know it like bang they've get all this stuff around them
S0142	no no it's a it's a separate issue now because from what i be say about fin
S0144	mm
S0142	now fin i think should be mean test
S0144	mm
S0142	because a millionaire now i've know people that be very very wealthy they'll park on the in the city centre right on the traffic light cos it's near their office and they get sixty pound fine a day
S0144	mm
S0142	so what
S0144	yeah yeah
S0142	i'll just claim that against the expense you know
S0144	yeah
S0142	and they think nothing of it but a bloke earn a hundred and fifty pound a week a sixty pound fine be as serious as whether his kid have a dinner every day this week
S0144	yeah
S0142	and that's the difference
S0144	mm
S0142	and so i think it you know it should be mean test like that millionaires can speed so what i'll get another ticket i've get another ticket and so it's only a five hundred pound fine this time
S0144	mm
S0142	somebody who's earn a million pound a year five hundred quid be sod all
S0144	mm
S0142	me it's like half a month's wag
S0144	mm but then okay why not mean test a a restaurant you go in and order a fish and chip for a poor person it's one pound fifty for a rich person it's fifteen pound
S0142	mm see go in a restaurant go in a restaurant be luxury yeah but there again you can say the same thing about go to the supermarket and buy your essential foods but
S0144	yeah can't you just mean test everything
S0143	
S0142	yes darling
S0143	i think i be do really well wash up think i've only get one more saucepan
S0024	and then we open the oven
S0142	oh yeah
S0143	yeah
S0142	have they cool down cos i wouldn't want you to burn your hand
S0143	ha thank you
S0144	well if you mean test everything
S0142	mm
S0144	i mean be that not go towards communism
S0142	erm
S0144	no i suppose it isn't
S0143	what's this water in this jug
S0142	lose it potato water or cabbage water
S0143	oh right
S0144	i don't know what that would be actually what would that be
S0142	no if you're if you're use a fine to punish somebody
S0144	mm
S0142	it's get to be relative to your income
S0144	mm
S0142	otherwise it's not a punishment
S0144	yeah
S0142	you know a thirty pound fine to a multimillionaire be sod all
S0144	no well i i agree with that yeah
S0142	but to somebody live on the breadline it's whether his family go hungry now there's a vast difference there isn't there
S0144	no well i agree with that yeah
S0142	you know so
S0144	but how you could implement it i don't see how it could work
S0142	in the court er you could say how much do you earn a year right he's get his roll royce outside
S0144	mm
S0142	er right you'll pay five hundred pound fine for a minor infringement
S0144	mm
S0142	bloke over there he's only gonna pay a fiver
S0144	hmm
S0142	which mean he's go to go without a packet of fag for a day
S0144	hmm
S0142	but the millionaire he say hmm that i earn that in three second
S0144	hmm mm
S0142	you know
S0144	mm hmm yeah hmm
S0142	no cos i've hear i've hear people laugh you know when they go hmm bloody get away with that one didn't i i only have to pay two hundred and fifty quid

S0144	yeah
S0142	we're sit on our arses and use our head
S0144	yeah go on facebook

S0144	yeah they're gonna need more calories
S0142	it's it's gonna burn it off and the er you know for him to maintain that it's fuel innit

S0142	yeah stuff that deadly fat in your face
S0144	yeah

S0144	i can see why
S0142	you know i think you're one of the last generation that's get a finger on the reality of that sort of thing
S0144	yeah well i i remember
S0142	you know i wasn't really strict with you be i
S0144	mm
S0142	you know like demand you know like victorian type dogma you know the but there be certain things i wouldn't let you get away with
S0144	mm
S0142	and that's make you a better
S0143	you didn't answer that
S0144	what's that
S0142	yeah he do answer that
S0143	be he victorian
S0144	victorian
S0143	yeah
S0144	er
S0142	no i wasn't be i
S0143	stop give him the answer
S0144	i don't know i'll have to think about that actually it depend in what in in what sense
S0142	i be quite strict at certain things
S0144	yeah
S0142	i can remember i certain things
S0144	no i think it's it's fine be strict
S0142	but but that's how you learn what's good what's bad
S0143	do he ever hit you
S0144	yeah i haven't get i haven't get a problem with that pardon
S0143	do he ever hit you
S0144	no he never hit me
S0142	there you go
S0144	i think he threaten to a couple of time
S0142	that's right yeah well that's it the bark be worse than the bite wasn't it no it isn't what's that what be that yeah and it's just tone of voice be enough wasn't it
S0144	yeah
S0142	don't you dare you know and that's it
S0144	yeah you've get a pretty scary voice when you're angry
S0142	yeah well that's right but that's but that's when you learn what you can do and what you can't do
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0142	and well now you're in that point you're at that stage in your life now where you you'll have kid probably
S0144	mm
S0142	hopefully
S0024	oh have i walk in on a
S0142	er only
S0144	hello
S0024	er
S0142	and i hope that the you know you're gonna give them some sort so
S0144	yeah they're gonna be discipline they're gonna know what to do when to do it and they're not
S0024	what be you talk about
S0142	er discipline young children be
S0024	oh er have you not see how strict i be
S0144	yeah be pretty strict
S0024	i'm pretty strict
S0142	well i i hope so too you know
S0144	no i think it's good to be strict to a you know not always
S0142	because there's certain that educational wallowers roam the streets now teach our children that be claim that you've get to listen to children and take their point of view
S0144	no
S0142	how can you ask a five year old a serious question and
S0144	mm
S0142	they're get no experience
S0144	mm
S0142	so why should you ever take their view you can listen to their view but they have to do as you tell them
S0024	yeah you have to listen though
S0142	and that's the that's the end of it
S0024	yeah yeah you have to listen
S0142	listen to them but then if they come out with something outrageous like why shouldn't you run across the road only because i haven't get my right shoe on it's not the right answer
S0144	mm
S0142	but that's what a child something stupid a child might say something it's only
S0144	yeah but not not just listen but also you need to show a degree of empathy as well
S0142	yeah and explain
S0144	me just sit there listen isn't good enough you have to show that you've understand and take on board what they be say
S0142	or explain why yeah yeah yeah but not to just blandly go bump okay we'll follow your ideas
S0024	oh no you don't want to do that no who do that
S0142	yeah a lot of people
S0024	what new new people parent today
S0142	a lot of people a lot of new parent yes they be fool into think that they must listen to their children and respect their children's wish like why shouldn't they go to you know they wanna stay up late they should be able to stay up late
S0144	yeah no er yeah i i think it have go like that to a degree yeah
S0142	you know and it do it it affect their education it affect their development in so many things but in fact mainly it affect their reason
S0144	well there's not authority no authority in the parent
S0142	yeah that's right when a child can go to school and the teacher say
S0144	and the teachers have lose their authority
S0024	yeah
S0142	exactly because of that yeah yeah
S0144	the police have lose their authority
S0142	you can't tell me to do that
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah that's this
S0142	why should you can't talk to me like that
S0144	yeah
S0142	you know ha er excuse me sunny jim yes i can no you can't
S0144	mm yeah
S0142	you've lose haven't you you've lose it
S0024	yeah
S0144	but on the other hand i mean you've get countries like japan and korea where the older generation be just completely revere and look up to and they're absolutely respect if they're older but i don't agree with that either because
S0142	oh shall we go to japan darling
S0144	because it it do it do depend i mean life be about what you've experience in the time that you've live
S0024	but it's completely different
S0142	yeah
S0144	and that doesn't necessarily equate to how old you be
S0142	that's right
S0144	i mean you can have a younger person who's a lot more knowledgeable and lot more spot on than someone who's older
S0142	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0144	i mean it doesn't necessarily work like that
S0024	well that's why you have to earn your respect and earn you know people's
S0144	well that's it exactly
S0142	that's it no but the youngsters nowadays especially inner city youngsters demand respect
S0024	yeah that's not good because you have to earn it
S0142	now that's totally wrong isn't it you earn respect you don't demand it
S0024	yeah
S0144	mm mm
S0142	you know the street corner yobs you know
S0144	mm mm
S0142	yo man you show me respect and all that crap you're like what
S0142	i wanna be like you
S0144	yeah yeah
S0142	yeah you know
S0144	so it's a battle of egos isn't it and it's yeah it always have be with teenagers i suppose
S0142	and that's not
S0144	but it's get worse i'd
S0142	yeah
S0144	or maybe we're just get older i don't know
S0024	mm
S0142	well it have it's get noticeably worse
S0144	mm
S0142	i cos i've witness two generations from you
S0144	mm
S0142	you know children of your age have have children
S0144	mm
S0142	children of your age now be grandparents
S0144	mm
S0142	how scary be that
S0144	mm
S0142	and when you've watch almost the decline in the standard of behaviour
S0024	mm
S0144	mm
S0142	i'm say not all you know i'm not you know not all children be like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	no no children like
S0142	i've i've meet some really wonderful parent and you know marvellous kid
S0144	yeah well of course
S0142	you know but you know it's like they're almost like feral rat now
S0144	mm
S0142	you know they be they're like that and you you think you've lose lose the plot
S0144	mm
S0142	how can you ever teach them or er how could you ever turn them round into be
S0144	have it not always be like that though
S0142	i don't think so i don't think so but i don't because i think the victorian era be the extreme the other way
S0144	mm
S0142	it be beat and beat and beat
S0144	but be it i mean
S0142	you will do
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean i mean my view of victorian be be the literature i've read and that's mostly from higher class apart from dickens but you get a warp kind of view of society i mean how i mean be it like that
S0142	oh yeah the higher class their their attitude to everything i think be wrong but dickens be a cos and other writers have well there's an
S0144	mm
S0142	and a couple of french writers that be the same they do describe it as it be
S0144	mm
S0142	abject poverty and so on people pompous arses and you know high bear people who sort of have lose touch altogether with common people
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0144	well what's different now
S0142	erm no i think it's because there be the common people haven't get this work ethic that they think they be workers in any way they demand respect and i want i want
S0144	mm
S0142	they walk around with a blackberry phone in their hand
S0024	that's yeah
S0142	er they haven't get two pennies to rub together they're live on benefit
S0024	but that's half of the problem be be from the benefit of
S0142	yeah and they think they be do everything right
S0144	mm
S0142	they can't see they can't see the wrong in what they're do you know
S0144	mm but you can't blame it on that generation because they be just a product of the older generation
S0142	no no exactly yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	so who do you blame
S0142	that's what i'm say but my my generation my generation be the off the start of it all i think
S0144	mm
S0142	cos we be the hippy era and the ones that rebel against our parent
S0144	what you think ironically it be the sixties that be the start of all this mess
S0142	er possibly
S0144	with all the good will and intentions
S0142	yeah yeah i yeah
S0024	mm
S0142	yeah because some you know it be
S0024	because of the rebellion because people rebel
S0142	the rebellion against what be you know
S0144	give everyone right and
S0142	you know we be the first generation that didn't act and dress like our father
S0024	yeah
S0142	we didn't think of own the suit
S0144	mm
S0142	be the first well you know the most important thing to wear now i want flare jeans and a flowery shirt want bell in my hair you know
S0144	mm
S0142	freedom man
S0024	but you know it when cos when when we're travel and stuff and everybody say oh well england's so great cos the government help you with the benefit and you know if you if nobody have get a job and they help you like that and we have to say well yeah that be pretty good but that be the cause of a lot of the problems as well because people think it's their god give right to have all of the have benefit
S0142	yeah yeah
S0024	so they've gotta give the right to to be treat you know to have a house to live in and everything like that
S0144	yeah
S0142	with our yeah
S0024	whereas you go to these other countries and if they don't have the benefit and if their family can't support them then they have nothing
S0144	mm
S0024	absolutely nothing
S0142	that's right
S0024	and they have to work themselves out of that but they can't
S0142	but that's it that's what people have to do isn't it
S0024	and then you appreciate england
S0142	yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
S0024	but you appreciate the benefit then but it be the cause of the bigger problem
S0144	mm
S0024	in i don't know there's there's a big
S0142	it's go around it's go the wrong way hasn't it benefit should be should be a safety net for emergencies
S0144	mm mm
S0024	a safety net yeah i mean that's a wonderful thing
S0142	not the norm
S0144	hmm
S0142	but that's what it's become it's become the norm
S0024	mm
S0144	well i think we're still live in a like post second world war mentality where people be like yeah we've win the war erm give me a
S0142	let's put our feet back and
S0144	yeah i put my feet up and give me the reward
S0024	give me everything
S0142	that's it yeah
S0144	and i don't have to work
