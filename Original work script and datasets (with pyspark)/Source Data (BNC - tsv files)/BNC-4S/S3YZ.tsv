S0041	ooh
S0086	that one's like half a tooth do i tell you that my friend's get shark teeth she have to have some teeth pull and there be a whole other line of teeth that come down that grow down into her adult teeth and they do an x ray of her head and there's a third set of adult teeth
S0046	shit
S0086	she's a shark it's true an actual shark
S0041	do you reckon that's how we're go to evolve i always think when people get these things like there's quite a few people with extra finger as well i think we're go to have another finger and i think we're go to have another row of teeth because as we're evolve
S0046	what do we need another finger for
S0041	our diet's change we need more teeth cos we're damage the teeth that we've get i think we're go to get a third set of teeth that be go to come in around age thirty five forty i think because we use to die at forty didn't we so i think we're go to evolve and have another set of teeth that come down at forty
S0086	yeah or just when you need them because they're probably always go to be there just like your adult teeth be there and they come down when your baby teeth go and then when they go your next row come down
S0041	yeah yeah
S0086	just like a conveyor belt of teeth
S0041	shark teeth
S0046	the thing be the thing be though it's we're we're preserve them a hell of a lot better than what they use to
S0041	they're still not mean you're teeth still aren't mean to love till as long as a hundred be they if people be live
S0086	and we're our diet's very different if you think about what we use to eat as carnivores compare to what we eat now you know pure purely like cavemen
S0041	yeah
S0046	mm true
S0086	like rip meat off bone
S0046	don't cos i really really still fancy chicken
S0086	em
S0046	or spicy spud i can eat them
S0041	spicy spud
S0046	yeah with lot of garlic sauce
S0086	just go to the dentist tomorrow and say look if you don't pull it out i'm go to and i'm go piss blood all over the floor so sort it
S0041	yeah have they tell you they won't
S0046	no they couldn't get in there too swell
S0041	it's really scar me the think of its really go through me cos i know exactly what you're talk about
S0046	but i don't know if it's crack at the back if it's crack at the back ill pull it if it's not
S0086	man alive what be that noise
S0046	that's me suck up
S0086	why cos you're scar the tooth be go to fall out
S0046	yeah it's like me filter everything

S0086	be it because you're not so because of that tooth you're not close your mouth
S0046	pretty much yeah
S0041	you're not swallow properly
S0046	yeah because i i it feel unnatural
S0086	yeah

S0046	so i'm try to find the best way forward
S0086	be you mean to be work tomorrow

S0046	mm hm
S0086	special trousers special trousers
S0046	no these these be like go out trousers but i get my security van pass
S0041	ah
S0086	ah i think they be work trousers
S0041	so what happen
S0046	it's just fill in paper legislation
S0086	cos you can't go on the shop floor like with your
S0046	no not really i can't anyway i'll scare the customers off
S0086	yes it be kind of kind of the idea
S0041	good
S0086	with security but yeah
S0041	yeah
S0046	well yeah it just kind of set the wrong impression though doesn't it you know you imagine walk into asda the first thing you see be a eat up face in an asda uniform what be you instantly go to think
S0086	mm bruiser
S0046	oh he's a thug
S0041	yeah
S0046	so that's that's that's get to be sort out in all fairness i won't need to stand at the stand at the desk i could i could i could go in asda sit behind the cctv desk within half an hour find a thief
S0086	right
S0046	so easy so easy to find a thief
S0086	well the one with the food in their pocket
S0046	yeah
S0041	i've be there
S0046	or the empty rucksack
S0086	well no because take rucksack to sainsbury's
S0046	do you
S0041	yeah
S0086	yeah
S0046	and walk out with them full
S0086	yeah
S0046	tut tut
S0086	yeah cos i'm save the planet man i've never be stop
S0046	no
S0086	but then i do have
S0041	i'll tell you what if somebody ever stop me when i wasn't steal something i would be fuck piss off
S0086	probably because you've get a backpack full of food that you have just pad for it's quite heavy you're try to get home
S0041	yeah
S0046	receipt be the way forward
S0041	i usually leave mine though i'm rubbish i take it off her and i i never know where i've put it
S0086	yeah i put it in a safe place but then if they stop me and then you've get bag of stuff and you're try to find your receipt yeah you'd be really annoy
S0041	yeah
S0046	bu then there's other question that they can ask as well how much do you pay for it and what till do you use
S0086	yeah
S0046	and then they can just search the computer and find out
S0041	i read half a book last night
S0086	be you enjoy it
S0046	half a book
S0041	about a hundred and thirty page of summat
S0046	what be you read
S0041	just can't put it down
S0041	it's call hunger game yeah i couldn't put it down so i've only i've get a quarter leave
S0046	what's it about
S0041	it's set in the future and basically the americans have a war and break break down into district a bite like state i suppose but they're all segregate nobody be allow to cross the border and they all produce different things for the country so one's agriculture one's mine
S0046	okay
S0041	blah blah blah and every year because they revolt basically the main people in the capital say right just to prove that this will never happen again we're go to each year you have to give two tributes like like a sacrifice basically two two people from each district one to twelve have to go to fight in the hunger game so they put them all in an arena and every year it change what the terrain's like and whether it's a jungle or it's a desert or anything at all and they're just basically make to fight till they die they just leave them there and the idea be that when one person's leave they're the winner
S0086	mm
S0041	yeah and they give them like at the very begin there's a big of the hunger game there's a big like
S0046	do you not want to go and see the film
S0041	yeah i do but i need to read it first from all different weapons and supply a piece of plastic or water bottle or stuff and they all they all have to stand on this like round thing till the gong finish chime then they're allow to go but obviously if you're go for the stuff then some of these people some of the district have people that really want to go and fight the hunger game and they train the kid up so that they're all huge whereas other district they're really poor would do anything not to be choose and they they still have to go
S0086	so you have to make a decision when you're on those little plinths do you run for the forest
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0086	or do you run and get the weapons cos if you try and get the weapons and someone beat you to they're go to blow your head off
S0046	they're go to actually there and then
S0086	whereas if you run into the forest you might survive a bite longer but you haven't get any of the stuff because you've leave the stuff behind
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0086	it's a real like when you watch it and i imagine when you read it it's really gut wrench cos you
S0046	have you see it
S0086	yeah i saw it in the cinema
S0046	yeah
S0086	you i think you're always put yourself in that position like even though it's obviously it's fantasy what would you do and it i don't know whether you get the sense of it in the book but in the film obviously it really question like our obsession the reality tv because everybody's watch it everybody watch on the big screen so they're also say like you you would be able to get rid of it all the kid they think you could be able to banish it if people just stop watch but there's this sick fascination with everybody tune in and everybody watch it it's kind of you wonder how far we be off that
S0046	and she she start to play the game a bite like she start try to like smile to the cameras and show her face if she's do something good or bad so that it get people watch so it's it's like she doesn't want to be their end she doesn't want to kill people but she have to them
S0086	cos then she get sponsor and she get little present and stuff when she's out there like things to help her
S0041	yeah i just get the bite where she's find em peter
S0086	oh okay
S0041	she just find him when he be camouflage in the river and she save him
S0086	that bite in the film oh my god but then i but then the film you're like how do they why would he even have the stuff with him to be able to camouflage him
S0041	no he's get it out he's make it
S0086	oh i see
S0041	he's be teach how to use wood and all that stuff
S0086	make it from what you've get
S0041	yeah and because of
S0086	they gloss over that in the film
S0041	he already know how to do it with ice and stiuff so he already have the skill he just didn't know the material of say before they go into the game when they have the three days of trail they kind of all work together don't they have three days of train one of the station they could go to be camouflage so he learn it
S0086	oh i see i see because they do have that bite in the film like there's like two minutes of him like paint his hand like a tree bark and then the bite when they're in the jungle and you can see him all camouflage it's so expertly do that you think where would he have get this stiff from it's not really explain like how why what don't understand
S0041	yeah she say that she look in the book it say she look down and she doesn't even realise it's him and she's like what the what and he open his eye and smile and she's like holy fuck
S0041	so she just rescue him and basically carry him clean him up get the pus out of his leg and manage to plop him somewhere in this really look like it's manmade so if we get spot we're fuck but he would have come look for me so and then he's talk and she have to shut him up so she kiss him and then they get send and sponsor of stew and so then she click like this be what want to see them like they're in love so oh god mm
S0086	they want to see
S0046	it get really good write up doesn't it
S0041	mm yeah it's really really good to read it's like on the same level as twilight book
S0086	mm not a challenge
S0041	like you can yeah it's not challenge at all it go in really easy you never have to reread a sentence lie you can just go through quite quickly
S0086	but quite a page turner
S0041	yeah
S0046	how far in the future be it set be it like real future future
S0041	eh
S0086	they don't give you any date do they
S0041	they give me a date in the book i can't remember what it be like twenty twenty seventy or something
S0086	it's this century isn't it
S0041	yeah it's still in twenties
S0046	so yeah it's not like ridiculously far on then
S0041	no but the way that i'm really excite i really hope it happen be real life i like that she get up in the morning and she go to the shower and she just push the button what she want whether she want it to be hot cold jet whether it have lemon stuff or whether she's go to have exfoliator and then she just press all these button she say there's like a hundred different offer for the shower she just stand there and do it and when she get out of the shower to dry her hair she just put her hand on this little screen and it send and electric current through her hair and dry it all
S0046	yeah do yeah
S0041	how good would that be for this hair
S0086	pretty nice
S0046	see i i i don't like film that be set too far in the future because they tend to go over the top ridiculously like total recall
S0086	that's hilarious
S0046	they're they're remake it aren't they
S0086	be they
S0046	yeah they're remake it
S0086	ah it's a classic especially when it become earth at the end
S0041	i don't think i've see it
S0046	yeah it be a good film
S0041	so cult classic it's very eighties
S0046	but that that be set in twenty twenties or something like that wasn't it
S0086	yeah but they make it forty years ago
S0046	no
S0086	late seventies wasn't it or early eighties
S0046	early eighties
S0086	so it's thirty year ago
S0046	yeah
S0086	so yeah they i think they think that by the twenty first century we we would be live one the moon
S0046	ah yeah proper ridiculous it be mar weren't it
S0086	hasn't quite work out that's mar well i don't think it be even mar i think it's just another planet that's uninhabitable if you go out of the bubble of oxygen
S0046	yeah
S0086	hilarious and at the end they be about to explode they're like come out their face it's so funny like the effect be so shit
S0046	arnold schwarzenegger film
S0041	i want to see it
S0046	yeah
S0086	you've get to watch it it's very much of its time
S0041	i think this one's set just enough far in the future so that you can believe it they don't go too crazy
S0086	well i think a lot of it it do isn't beyond the realms of possibility
S0041	no
S0086	you know our fascination with reality tv you think where will that end
S0041	yeah i it could happen
S0086	civil war that could happen

S0086	okay seventy kilos sound a bite intense and you have go run twice on monday poor little legs
S0041	yeah so obviously on the way home i'm die so i get here and i be like fuck my legs be burn ouch
S0086	be they massive do they not swell up
S0041	eh no but i think i'd go for a walk round the two miles here
S0086	oh okay
S0041	and walk them off and then i run that as well i stop more but on both i average a ten minute mile
S0086	do you think you might be lose your mind do you think you might have actually go bananas
S0041	eh yeah yeah i would go again tonight
S0086	but but but maybe this be because you're really enjoy it like be you enjoy the buzz that you get from it or be you just so determine to get your time up
S0041	no i just really want to win
S0086	yeah right
S0041	i just really want to win
S0086	that will it yeah okay
S0041	so that's why i think let's not run today
S0086	let's not run just sit
S0041	and it really take i be go to go to the gym after work
S0086	you're mad
S0041	i know i think i'm get a bite addict
S0086	you be get a bite addict this have this happen to stu that's why he go three time a day
S0041	do it i would go twice a day
S0086	because and he's fuck mental yeah well he do he go three time a day because he's just go wrong in the head so he go run he go swim and then he go and do weight
S0041	if my if my if my muscle could keep up i would go twice a day
S0086	em
S0041	but hey hurt a lot
S0086	i i mean i'm complain and all i do be weight and a bite of run on monday
S0041	yours might be a bite more extreme though
S0086	no i don't think so i think i'd like to maintain that they be that it be hello
S0041	hello
S0169	you alright good to see you
S0041	yeah
S0086	she just tell me all the stuff that she's be do so
S0169	oh be she
S0086	no
S0041	it be my own fault i go a bite over board yesterday
S0169	i think you have the day off
S0041	i be go to and then i
S0169	you change your mine
S0041	yeah well i be sit all day
S0169	typical woman
S0041	i get this i get this funny feel my chest sometimes so i be sit at work and when i hear people cos the gyms right next to work i hear people on the treadmill and i get this kind of anxious feel i think it's part worry that it's three weeks and part i really should be do that
S0169	guilty
S0041	and part and part i really want to do it so i sit all day and i be just fidget all day so then i decide it would be a good idea to run home from work which be just over two miles it's only like two point two but i walk from the hotel to the bus station to drummer street so that must be nearly the point two bite
S0086	mm
S0169	yeah bleugh so yeah do that can't keep pace at all em so i stop like three three three of four tin on the way home not stop still but stop and like walk maybe ten pace then start again
S0046	half a mile
S0169	every half a mile
S0046	ten pace be half a mile
S0041	ten pace be not half a mile
S0169	no no its
S0086	he's talk shit
S0169	no no just wind you up
S0041	i be say to think before it be by breathe i couldn't breathe this time my legs be burn to fuck so i decide early that day before i go to work to go to the gym and do the thing where you push the weight to up that to seventy kilos and before be only do forty forty fifty six i think fuck it you're go to have to learn to to do it and just do it
S0086	man alive
S0041	so and then i do this one and this ones and this one's as well so and i get home and obviously my legs be burn burn and i couldn't stretch out my calve at all no matter what i do they still hurt so i think right tell you what we're go to do we'll go for a little walk round the two two miles here so i start do that then i couldn't do that either and start to run that as well stop more often but still manage to overage a ten minute mile so i'm just obviously shit at keep my pace and my legs be burn to fuck so today come hell or high water i'm not do it
S0086	sit down make sure you don't leave we'll just barricade you in your room
S0041	yeah
S0086	you can't come out
S0041	so i think that be probably wise and i haven't be to the gym at all although i be go to go this morning except for i overlay so i haven't be
S0086	yeah i should have knock for you this morning but i just think you be there be a cos you do different shift everyday so i never want to knock for you in case you're not start and i'm wake you up
S0041	yeah so that's why that's why i can't run
S0169	how's his face alright
S0086	huh
S0169	be it get better

S0086	they need to be go now
S0041	yeah now
S0086	em be you em transfer it to muscle
S0169	yeah that's probably what's happen see when you first start do any sort of weight train you gain weight quite quickly you'll gain like a i can't work it i can't remember what it be bite it's something it's something ridiculous like you gain a kilo if you 'redoing weight train regular you can gain a kilo a week
S0041	shit
S0169	yeah because you're build muscle you see which you've not have before so that's go to be sort of the fat you lose your replace with muscle so you're not go to lose any weight
S0041	i'm go to get gun soon i can feel them
S0086	you're go to definitely get gun
S0041	they're better than the last time i try for gun look at this arm

S0169	this be some information for you just os you know
S0086	broadcast
S0041	get ready

S0041	right
S0169	okay for every kilo of your body weight
S0041	right
S0169	you can absorb two grams of protein every two hours yeah so just just say for example you can have twenty eight grams of protein if you have seventy grams of protein after twenty eight you're just go to poo it out it's actually useless to you yeah no there's no point over indulge in protein that's the thing
S0041	yeah there be cos it will fill you up and you just poo it out
S0086	yeah yeah exactly you're not you're not store it
S0041	you're not store it if you're not store it that's great isn't it
S0086	it's better than carbs because carbs stick to you
S0169	mm it's a bite of a waste though innit really you should at least eat a few carbs

S0086	right
S0041	cos he hat that so i'm clearly accept another wed
S0086	unless they've get a you know it's a bigger company than you realise and the chance of it be him be small
S0041	be pretty high
S0169	what be it you do
S0041	i arrange conferences and wed for a hotel
S0169	what you work in a hotel
S0041	yeah just in the back so i don't have to deal with all the people
S0041	then they just ring up and tell me what they want and then i give them advice and then if they don't like it i negotiate it or say no fuck off this be what it cost
S0086	mm
S0041	and then they come in or fly in and arrange stuff and have a look round i show them round the hotel show them all the bedrooms and then just sign the contract and then i basically do all of it like take payment for it send them the bill and like profile the do everything so that before they arrive the week before we have like a meet with the whole hotel so the manager of every department come and i have to go we have to go through each event that we've get come each day and tell them all everything that we've arrange so like if we've get a wed we have to go through it all and say you know you're go to be do this you're go to be do this foods and this time so chef say he need this and then when they come then i stand there hello nice to meet you i'm lovely to put a face to the name mm and then i smile and then that's it and then they go home and never say thank
S0169	oh so i've get the idea that you like set the table and all that
S0041	oh no we don't have to set the table
S0169	with all the confetti round them you know what i mean
