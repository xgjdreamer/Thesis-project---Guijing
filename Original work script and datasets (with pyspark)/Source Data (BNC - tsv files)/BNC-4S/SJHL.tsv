S0328	it'll be fine
S0329	so what more be what's more be to come in term of read
S0466	ah all the i mean if if we be do it properly and it be all be do in hebrew it then afterwards it take about another nearly an hour and the bite that we've just do
S0466	would normally take about a a an hour it depend how fast the person read be i've be to them where they just read it all and they read it properly whereas
S0466	my dad never do that
S0329	in hebrew
S0466	yeah in hebrew
S0328	do you reckon he skip bits
S0466	he never skip bits but it's like claudia roden say that in her family her father would go and that be
S0328	mm
S0466	that be a common phenomenon amongst in jewish families because nobody actually know what the hebrew mean there be very very few people unless they're an orthodox family who know what the hebrew mean you're just phonetically read it i don't know what it mean
S0328	it's like do his greek homework

S0466	mm
S0329	and say who's the man in the middle
S0326	and i think he'd be well chuff to see a picture of his children together innit
S0466	and be he joke
S0329	no
S0326	no
S0466	he really didn't recognise him
S0326	he send me a he send me an email like six hours later oh it's
S0328	mm
S0329	but when do last see him
S0326	i dunno they have a punch up
S0329	when they have a punch up mm mm
S0466	complicate all these complicate families imagine like another two generations down the line when you've all marry twice have two set of children and
S0466	fuck me work backwards from there be go to be impossible
S0466	so let's work it out be what
S0328	he can't even remember if it's his son or not so
S0466	's on his third wife and seventh child
S0329	don't say that in front of
S0328	which wife be you on
S0329	mm
S0466	oh so that thing of people call their erm their children a double barrel combination because they can cos the women be kind of ardent feminists so 's daughter be call
S0329	oh i didn't realise that
S0466	yeah that's what she be her real
S0329	she's
S0466	her real name be cos her mum's call and her dad's call so she's call and that's the but this be gonna get absurd what if she marry somebody who's double barrel
S0466	and she decide that have to stick and he get
S0328	sound like er so you've get an option anyway
S0466	or yeah or
S0329	yeah so
S0466	what's gonna happen
S0466	if she erm
S0328	yeah that's it then isn't it
S0466	be it gonna be
S0328	but also people be get much much more multicultural too so their names'll be like
S0328	and then you know
S0328	like
S0329	mm
S0328	more and more combos
S0329	have get cos he want to change his surname to erm but be a really good dj name but he want to spell it in in a variety of different ways
S0329	so that could be and could be
S0329	or
S0328	yeah
S0466	yeah but the point be the point of that that name
S0466	about be that that's not a make up name that be his name
S0329	er well it isn't his name
S0328	yeah
S0466	whereas a dj could call themselves anything

S0328	like
S0466	and that's fine but it it like yeah
S0329	no but he be i mean he be say he want to call himself
S0328	who he should definitely do that you should encourage him to
S0328	push him to into that one
S0466	or
S0328	the sillier the better i think
S0329	it's the kind of thing that he'll do drink one night and try and change his name my deed poll

S0466	so as not to reveal my ignorance but
S0466	but they be proper boys you know like spend every week er after after synagogue they'd go and do learn how to do hebrew so actually know quite a lot of hebrew as oppose to to just read it

S0328	yeah
S0466	but in modern hebrew they take the vowels away because it's just
S0326	erm they do have a thing in greek call iota subscript which be when the i slip underneath the letter which be similar
S0466	right
S0326	but it's not it's only on certain

S0326	er i think make them
S0328	as a matter of fact i do make those
S0329	i have those for breakfast
S0328	i work a rare saturday very rare
S0329	i have them for breakfast they weren't my pudding
S0328	no that that's when you should eat them
S0466	they be like macaroons
S0328	mm which ones
S0326	the ones that be leave for you be
S0466	yeah
S0329	mm
S0328	oh they be coconut macaroons
S0326	she er she scoff all the other ones
S0466	yeah
S0329	i didn't like
S0329	i mean
S0328	those so much that be 's favourite one i like the one that i i put your name in on the instagram the kumquat and erm black sesame one
S0329	mm
S0328	do you have that one
S0329	mm
S0328	that be a that be give you a like
S0326	sesame be good
S0329	i like this i could be your official cake taster
S0466	taster
S0328	come on in in the bakery
S0466	so there's no flour in this
S0328	mm mm no flour
S0329	it's sublime isn't it
S0466	amaze
S0328	flourless
S0329	but i don't think it be underbaked i think that
S0328	i think if it have a little bite more time it'd be more
S0329	i don't think so i think it's perfect and i think
S0326	we have to rush to come here cos you say seven fifteen
S0329	yeah and i think with this it's just a bite in another hour it would be the perfect consistency
S0328	mm but do you know what i do exactly cos i i'd be roast something before and i leave the oven at two hundred degrees when i put the cake in so it be too hot when i put it in so it be cook
S0329	mm
S0328	it be just a little like it just wasn't bake exactly right it be the right amount of time but just a little bite too
S0466	it's a very accurate little process you have to be accurate don't you exactly
S0328	especially with this cake
S0466	you have to have a cooker that you really trust an oven that you really trust
S0326	a book about the science of bake
S0328	yeah
S0329	i cook for my birthday i cook a a cake and
S0326	the most important ingredient be air be air
S0328	no it doesn't say most important ingredient
S0328	it say er a like an er an an an often overlook ingredient
S0326	where's that book anyway
S0466	be be what be air
S0329	air yeah
S0328	air
S0328	most of the step in the the the process
S0329	that's what be miss from the knödeln
S0466	yeah
S0328	be erm air be to to to to trap or or encourage
S0466	mm
S0328	you know air bubble to form
S0466	mm
S0329	but you be tell me that it didn't really matter today what erm the i didn't need to alter the temperature of the oven
S0328	definitely not to bake to bake a different size cake
S0329	to bake to bake the cake
S0328	no
S0329	no
S0326	although not
S0326	although not usually list as an ingredient air
S0328	can you do that in hebrew it's not traditional
S0328	afterwards everybody have to say what be it
S0329	i make a cake for my birthday in 's oven in france and i couldn't it be quite murky and i and i didn't have my glass and i couldn't actually properly read what i'd what temperature i'd set it on but
S0328	the temperature be important
S0329	but actually i i think that i cook it on the grill
S0329	it be good wasn't it remember it be the orange
S0466	yes it be delicious it be really wonderful
S0329	and and i make i hate you
S0328	you could do a grill cake
S0328	be nice
S0466	but get everybody i know have the same problems like you can't that you burn the bottom or you burn the top or one some bite of it burn because the oven isn't consistently deliver heat
S0329	in your oven in your france oven
S0466	the france oven be really difficult cos it's an old fashion gas oven you know it's like bottom heat there's no other form of heat
S0328	mm
S0466	and so of course that be the problem
S0328	you just need to get the hang of whatever oven it that's the thing be at home i erm just just haven't really use that oven very much
S0329	mm
S0328	but after a while you figure it out like where the hot and cold spot be and then you can move things around so
S0466	but what do you do if the heat be all come up from the bottom you can't it's i've get these two huge kind of ceramic tile in there
S0328	it should be okay if it's come up from the bottom yeah you can put like a stone in
S0466	that's cos it kind of disperse slightly but everything i ever cook in there can get bottom burn it burn at the bottom
S0329	so glad that wasn't my computer
S0326	something so funny i drop the book
S0328	what be it the punch line
S0326	from childhood
S0328	what it's true
S0326	i know it's nice
S0328	enjoy the book
S0326	the bite one be the best one be that
S0328	take that hat off before you make fun of me
S0326	don't don't be afraid
S0326	to get your hand dirty when you bake
S0328	it's true it be the it be a useful tool
S0466	how can you not
S0329	i've eat too much
S0466	me too
S0326	oh you should've read this bite mum there's a chapter on a note on tin size
