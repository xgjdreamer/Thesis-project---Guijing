S0251	yeah
S0369	wow
S0251	okay okay i'll put that there mm
S0369	pity didn't show the picture of the er of the school on fire really
S0251	that's the best bite
S0369	i mean we never get to write anything you know to do anything like that not that i remember anyhow
S0368	so would you prefer to get your information from a book or from your television your computer
S0252	erm
S0369	you get it where you can i think don't you
S0368	yeah
S0252	it's
S0369	you're do it in
S0252	probably go towards more the book because
S0368	yeah
S0252	of the sort of academic integrity part of sort of get to be able to chase your source and
S0368	source of
S0252	erm obviously you want it
S0368	information
S0252	to be reliable and so that's that's what they're look for
S0368	yeah
S0252	but probably increasingly it's erm online journals as well
S0368	be it
S0252	yes
S0368	oh right
S0369	you see what he would need as well but probably like reference
S0368	yeah that's what it be yeah
S0251	oh you do yeah
S0369	you know who do it and
S0368	yes
S0251	mm mm
S0369	whatever sometimes you don't just quite get it off the television in a way or catch it
S0252	mm but
S0368	mm
S0252	you can't really get something off a an unknown website and reference that it's
S0369	mm
S0252	not very good
S0368	no no it you have to get
S0252	i mean but er still like learn how to do something in mathematics websites can be quite helpful
S0369	yes it it's more er as you say academically er accept if it's a book
S0252	mm
S0369	with all of the
S0252	or journal yes
S0368	mm
S0252	journals you get you get a big one
S0368	mm
S0369	well i've er i've read a book of er it's the bomb churchill's bomb they call it
S0252	mm
S0369	and it's a thick book ain't it
S0369	and i've read it and it be quite interest really because er er in our day churchill be well cometh the man cometh the moment and it be churchill if it hadn't have be for churchill we would not er have be on the win side of the war
S0252	mm
S0369	and if it hadn't have be for churchill talk to er roosevelt and get him to get america
S0369	to help us
S0252	mm
S0369	to
S0368	yes
S0369	attack germany you know
S0252	yes
S0369	the d day land and all that business er and if they hadn't have succeed the germans the americans would have pull out and go back to america to take on japan
S0252	mm
S0369	and we would have never have be able to have do that er invasion we just it would have be impossible but with churchill talk to him and one thing and another because what one thing churchill could do be talk and convince people and he could always come out with sort of some cliché
S0251	mm
S0251	the punchline yeah wasn't it
S0369	yes he could always come out with things like that
S0252	mm
S0369	er and er but behind the he wasn't all that popular he make load of mistake and decisions
S0252	mm
S0369	and it's it's there like you know what happen and that and er but what i'm get to at the end of the book i bet there's that much
S0251	mm
S0369	of reference of where it's from and who's it
S0251	yeah
S0369	you know what a thing i think i be a lot more to read but i do i'd come to the end
S0251	yeah
S0369	but it's amaze how many people have
S0251	mm
S0369	contribute to that
S0251	it's very detail
S0369	you know the bodleian library
S0251	yeah
S0369	the ashmolean and
S0251	mm
S0369	it's mm
S0251	mm
S0252	well reference be possibly not as simple as some might think
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	because there be different style of reference
S0368	oh be there
S0252	erm i've have to sort of adhere to the harvard style of reference
S0368	oh right
S0252	but er but there be other style as well and
S0251	you know that girl i be talk to while i be wait for you
S0252	yes
S0251	to come she be do english and politics
S0252	yes
S0251	and she say i think it be in the english they have to do the harvard reference
S0252	yes
S0251	and in the politics they've get to do chicago reference
S0252	yes it's different for departments yes
S0251	well you'd think they'd just have one style for the whole university to make it simpler wouldn't you
S0252	oh
S0251	why be it different
S0369	cos they don't like do things simple i think
S0252	i their reason be that they try to choose what most people would academics would write
S0251	in that circle
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah oh i see
S0252	some departments even have more than one style of of
S0251	oh
S0252	er er reference and specify that
S0251	mm
S0252	erm each different essay that they're give
S0368	so be this just a style of write
S0252	erm
S0251	well it's a style of the reference
S0252	the style of reference
S0368	oh reference
S0252	so one
S0252	can be in text reference so it's
S0368	mm
S0252	one particular style be that there's a little number that they've above
S0368	oh yeah yeah
S0252	what somebody's say
S0368	yes
S0252	erm another way could be that in the text there's a bracket with the name of the author a comma and then the date that book
S0368	yeah
S0252	be publish
S0368	yeah
S0252	and then so that's have the text one could vary
S0368	yeah
S0252	at the back of the book you probably don't realise but there be actually different style for example what do you actually include in a reference
S0368	yeah
S0252	so usually there's a minimum the author title be include but also if it's a journal you've get the title of the journal now which journal it's from
S0368	yeah
S0252	so it could be title er and altruism and the journal be er sage or
S0368	oh
S0252	erm
S0252	the journal for management or something
S0368	oh
S0252	something like that and then you might have to give what er volume and the edition the journal be
S0368	oh yes
S0252	but that's usually give sort of about a year it would be fourteen and then in bracket which month of the
S0368	mm
S0252	and in other style there it can be something call the a doi doi
S0368	mm
S0252	and that's like a special number that if you type that in you get the page up with
S0368	oh
S0252	a lot of information of the book
S0368	oh
S0252	erm and some er disbn as well
S0251	mm
S0368	and you've get to put the title of the book in italics
S0252	yes well that
S0369	oh yeah
S0252	vary as well
S0251	oh right you might or you might not
S0252	yes and obviously
S0368	mm
S0252	there's a set rule generally there should be a set rule for each different style and if you get that slightly incorrect to be penalise in a an essay so
S0251	quite severely
S0368	mm
S0369	it's about er artwork as well by the sound of it
S0251	mm
S0369	quite severely
S0251	very severely i would say
S0368	mm
S0369	yeah
S0368	i know what you mean with those little erm letter and that cos
S0252	yeah
S0368	er erm you when my my history read
S0251	mm
S0368	erm you know they do that and then put it at the bottom of the page
S0369	and you haven't really get to the subject yet have you then
S0252	no
S0251	worth a lot of mark that
S0252	mm
S0251	i think a disproportionate amount of mark
S0252	mm
S0368	mm
S0251	because it's not to do with how you've argue
S0252	no
S0251	the case
S0252	no
S0251	it's just a technical issue
S0369	it's er unnecessary as well isn't it really to have that you know
S0252	and obviously little things like er it be in italics can that's enough
S0369	mm
S0252	to lose
S0368	yeah
S0252	a lot of mark
S0251	mm
S0369	but
S0368	thank you
S0369	this be what do they call it the discipline that you have to er adhere to see to see if you can can do that and and it's like the taxi driver er if everybody could do it everybody don't pass
S0368	sorry
S0369	but only those who can do it er would succeed like you know they don't if everybody you know if it's not them difficulties and that or hurdle out there
S0368	mm
S0252	but it would be quite easy to lose ten percent of the mark
S0369	yeah
S0252	just
S0368	yes
S0252	for one mistake or it's
S0369	oh be much as that
S0252	yes
S0369	well that's a that be unfair be that
S0368	mm
S0252	and there's a disagreement to what mean apparently a few mean two
S0369	oh yes
S0252	yeah so now i don't think it do a couple
S0368	no
S0252	be two
S0368	yes
S0252	and a few be three
S0368	three or
S0252	mm
S0368	more yeah
S0252	that's
S0368	mm
S0369	but you'd have to go along with them wouldn't you
S0252	mm
S0368	yes i agree yeah yeah
S0369	yeah tell them what they want to hear or
S0368	mm
S0369	put down what they want to read sort of thing
S0252	mm
S0368	so be you advise in advance which erm sort of
S0252	style it be
S0368	style it be
S0252	happily with the management school it be
S0368	yeah
S0252	it's always harvard
S0368	oh right
S0252	but that's
S0368	yeah
S0251	mm
S0252	it can get quite tricky for things like er one thing that tend to happen now be dictionaries tend to only be online now i i think oxford er university press don't seem to publish
S0251	a new one
S0252	the specialist dictionaries
S0368	oh
S0252	out as much you know like a
S0368	oh
S0252	a dictionary for finance or something
S0368	no
S0252	like that
S0251	oh right
S0252	so to get the most up to date one
S0368	you need to be online
S0252	which be what you want it be online and that be very hard to reference because if you do a direct quote you've get to have page number and you
S0368	no
S0252	don't get page number on an online
S0368	yeah
S0252	dictionary
S0368	mm
S0252	though
S0368	oh
S0251	oh i see
S0252	and i don't think harvard well i don't know the sort of reference style have sort of come up to speed with that
S0251	no
S0252	cos the big part of the university be reference
S0251	mm
S0252	and i've get to do a
S0369	mm
S0252	what's call a an academic integrity test which be purely about reference and
S0369	yeah
S0252	that type of but then i think one reason be they're very worry that you'd copy somebody else's idea without acknowledge it or
S0368	oh and that yeah
S0252	take into account somebody else's idea
S0368	yes
S0252	without
S0369	mm
S0252	acknowledge
S0368	well i suppose with these reference book you know like the you say the oxford things change so quickly now
S0252	yes
S0368	don't they
S0252	they do
S0368	so erm you know they're they'll print one and then it's out of print
S0252	yes
S0368	out of erm date isn't it
S0252	it be
S0368	and if you
S0252	and that's one of the good thing about the online one be
S0368	mm
S0252	it's usually the dictionary's date be twenty fifteen or twenty fourteen
S0368	yeah
S0252	so it's very up to date
S0251	yeah mm
S0369	and you can't get purchase those though that take a dictionary then
S0252	well you you don't the they kind of don't really exist as a a
S0369	mm
S0252	book as
S0368	no
S0252	such it's i mean it's they're very easy to use the online dictionaries
S0368	yeah
S0369	mm
S0252	i like them
S0368	yeah
S0252	i i think
S0369	well perhaps you be conversant
S0252	yes
S0369	er very much so with the computer or what it what you can get out of it
S0252	mm it's
S0251	mm
S0252	well print one good thing be you can type in to the dictionary what word you're look for and then it's
S0368	yeah
S0252	come up straight away
S0368	yeah
S0252	erm it
S0368	without go through the page
S0252	yes
S0368	look for it
S0252	and in different dictionaries it's not just the journal of of of the dictionary of finance it could be the dictionary of management or something
S0368	yeah
S0252	like that they're just like
S0368	mm
S0252	variations accord to the specialist area it's focus on
S0368	mm well one thing you be good with your computer aren't you
S0369	that's what i say he's very er adept to it you know
S0252	well
S0368	cos i don't suppose everybody be
S0252	no it it's it's it's very variable really
S0368	yes i think so
S0252	and possibly variable on certain things like some people be in regard sort of computers and phone either very orientate to sort stuff er maybe like facebook and
S0251	oh
S0252	that type of thing be experts at do that but
S0368	yeah
S0252	not sort of at certain other things
S0368	no
S0252	mm
S0368	no i can imagine
S0252	one thing that i have be do be erm be use a software call spss which be erm a statistical software to do the different type of texts and
S0368	oh yeah
S0252	erm use process data and that type of thing
S0368	oh right mm
S0252	mm
S0369	you're get above us er in incidentally i nearly bring my kodak printer back
S0252	uhu yes
S0369	because
S0251	printer right
S0369	i get so far
S0368	's write down
S0369	get so far and although i do it here
S0252	yes
S0369	and i say i've get it i've get it when i get back home
S0252	oh right
S0369	and try it it didn't so i i've try some other things and it that be it isn't no now i be gonna bring it back today actually but i think no no you've be up all and that and and i can print off on the other one
S0252	yes
S0369	it's go alright like but er i think really grandma's right i'll have to do it when you do it i'll have to write something down so
S0252	yes
S0369	how many stag there be and do it
S0252	mm the other option be be that i take a picture of each of the stag and then put a full explanation underneath say exactly what you're look for
S0369	the thing be er i think i show you them the like the booklet shall we call it
S0252	yes
S0369	er but it's in german or or spanish or something
S0252	mm
S0369	but i can't find my english one
S0252	yes
S0368	mm mm
S0252	i've erm buy a a new er cartridge for my printer
S0369	oh yeah
S0252	yes so
S0369	uhu
S0252	haven't be they seem to sort of rise in price a little bite but er i manage to get one for what i be sort of hop to
S0369	mm
S0252	get it for
S0369	be that
S0252	yes it be
S0369	mm mm mm
S0252	it tend to be most of the ink i tend to buy be possibly old stock from erm a business that no longer have that printer or something like that
S0369	yeah yeah they've update
S0252	and they just want to
S0369	mm
S0252	get rid of it really
S0369	yeah that's it and sell it off mm i mean i remember er our accountant and er a really nice bloke he be and i get on well with him er oh
S0252	mm
S0369	well he be go through the store to the stock and he call the store's manager and a couple in sort of thing and evidently er about how much stock they have do you know we'd get brakeshoes on stock at i don't know how much but we didn't have bus to fit them
S0369	and they go through all this and a lot of it be put into the and round to other company and that to sell off you know at reasonable to turn them into money and he bring this rule out if a a thing like if a a an article may be maybe some injectors or some plug or whatever hadn't move in other word hadn't be take out and refit them for three months they have to be they have to be er
S0252	renew
S0369	er renew
S0252	mm
S0369	and
S0368	than you
S0369	they then have to be er report
S0368	mm
S0369	to see why you know be they do something and that be the accountant into that and it be er it be amaze how much money be lock in this be the argument be lock into the store actual
S0252	mm
S0369	really in in in er which be no good you know it be go into a few thousand pound that have anyhow they get hold of that and then
S0368	what's that

S0252	but they be try to lift the amount from twenty pound to thirty pound
S0368	mm
S0252	that out use that you can do contactless
S0368	that's only a small amount be it
S0252	yes it's limit to
S0368	oh i see i didn't know that
S0251	mm be it just for small things like coffee and newspapers
S0252	yes
S0251	and magazines and that
S0252	yes it's
S0251	mm
S0252	as i say that it's currently a limit of twenty pound but now it's down to up to thirty pound
S0251	that's consider small change now be it people
S0369	well it be in a way isn't it
S0251	mm
S0252	i don't think it's intend to use if you're buy a television or
S0369	no
S0252	something it's
S0368	no
S0252	just for little
S0251	mm
S0252	everyday expense
S0368	mm
S0369	oh we do get our cheque again didn't we
S0368	mm
S0369	go back to the bank
S0252	yes
S0369	for our pensioner bond
S0252	yes
S0369	and er we do say to them like the about the cheque well they no yours would be alright well i say they're ask for a banker's cheque
S0252	mm
S0369	or or or a but
S0252	mm
S0369	he say another cheque as well i just forget like what it be banker's cheque and then a
S0368	banker's draft
S0369	a draft or something
S0252	mm
S0368	mm
S0369	he say really he say therefore
S0369	therefore
S0369	say you be buy a car
S0252	uhu yes
S0369	from a dealer twenty five thousand thank you say twenty five thousand pound or something
S0252	thank you yes
S0369	but if it's they'll want a banker's cheque because the bank have already get the money and they will give you the cheque
S0252	mm
S0369	er and so when you give the car dealer the cheque he know that the bank's you know it's get it it's get really from the bank in your name but if it wasn't just excuse me your own cheque he could you could give him that get in the car and drive off and that's it and you ain't get the money there it's just to ensure that the money be there the the bank be say it's there
S0252	mm
S0369	so we fill these in again that and they've come back again haven't they
S0252	the vw garage do now allow either you couldn't pay by cheque or banker's draft
S0368	oh
S0251	oh
S0252	have to be via debit card
S0368	oh
S0369	and that's that be the example our bank man give
S0252	mm
S0369	a car
S0368	what a great big sandwich
S0251	huge
S0369	what do you think to that little article
S0251	mm interest isn't it
S0369	mm
S0251	mm doesn't say where they find them rather crucially do it
S0368	no
S0369	no
S0368	or where they've be all
S0369	well that's it as far as i remember it be this end of the school which be the boys' end
S0251	mm
S0369	which be and the the other the other end wasn't really like that mm
S0251	could have be one of the teachers take them home and
S0368	mm
S0251	they've die and be find
S0368	mm
S0251	in their possessions or
S0368	mm
S0251	something
S0368	you don't know
S0251	there's part of the story
S0369	i don't know
S0251	miss
S0368	mm
S0369	take them home for mark
S0251	and keep them all this time
S0368	mm
S0251	some people be like that with mark and it take weeks to get them back
S0369	mm just go back to your dishwasher then
S0252	yeah
S0369	be there an instruction book on it
S0252	yeah there be yes
S0369	yeah mm for clean
S0252	well not for clean but basically
S0369	yeah
S0252	they say don't do anything unless there's
S0369	mm
S0252	somebody in there that
S0369	mm
S0252	as far as i'm aware once you open it there's a little pipe that's connect to that end who can just sort of lift it off and then just clean it like that
S0251	i think on pancake day i'm go to use the rice milk as the liquid and still put an egg in it
S0251	i try it with the egg replacement but it's not very good it be terrible in fact
S0368	what be that dry egg
S0251	mm
S0368	like a dry egg
S0251	it wasn't it be a dry product but it wasn't egg
S0368	oh right
S0251	i think and then i
S0368	oh i see yeah
S0251	there's some
S0252	very
S0251	substitute
S0369	mm
S0252	very hard to it wasn't it
S0251	it look terrible
S0368	mm
S0251	i've decide not only can you not make an omelette without break egg you can't make a pancake either
S0251	yeah
S0368	i notice in er morrisons they have some pack of already make pancakes
S0251	mm just to reheat mm
S0368	mm
S0251	well i'll only be get a third of an egg
S0368	mm
S0251	so
S0368	mm
S0251	it might be too much i don't know
S0368	actually i
S0369	so
S0368	i think you can
S0251	mm
S0369	how far into the test be you now
S0251	erm eight weeks
S0369	out
S0251	out of twelve
S0369	uhu
S0251	so two thirds
S0369	mm
S0251	i think it's go pretty well really i've adapt to most of the things i think after that it will still be another eight weeks just try to gradually
S0369	mm mm probably mm
S0251	try things and see whether
S0251	i get a reaction see whether you get a reaction or not
S0368	mm
S0251	i think it will have to be very gingerly
S0368	mm
S0251	erm
S0368	yeah
S0251	and some of the things you'll decide no it's still not alright so
S0368	mm
S0251	i'll have to be kick into touch for another
S0369	so
S0251	indefinitely really
S0369	when when do it come on can you sort of pick approximately a how long ago
S0251	i don't know really certainly in years it be i think
S0369	in
S0251	in term of years it be
S0369	in years
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0251	mm two three maybe four i don't really know
S0369	uhu
S0251	say to i be talk to er well somebody i know let's just say that
S0369	mm
S0251	who have a daughter in the year below no two years below isn't she
S0252	it be
S0251	two years younger than you she's at be at school but they don't have a sixth form and she didn't want her to go to school and er they try to get scholarships and that to go private but it didn't work out and they couldn't really afford it and but she's go to the catholic school this catholic comprehensive in i don't it do get a bite better result than school but i don't know how significant it be
S0369	no
S0251	they live at which i think be on the way to isn't it
S0369	where be it
S0251	say it's eight miles drive country roads to the main road
S0369	oh crumb mm
S0251	she's get a a car about ten or twelve years old
S0369	oh and the track there'll be track not roads be terrible in winter and that
S0251	obviously don't get grit
S0369	mm
S0251	have a bite of snow last week she say i wake up cos she have to take her daughter to school to the train station rather for eight o'clock
S0369	
S0251	to train station
S0369	mm
S0251	for eight o'clock
S0369	yeah
S0251	think it would be would it be about a half hour drive
S0252	well the the problem be if it's won't be able to pick up much speed so whilst it's probably maybe twelve miles
S0368	mm
S0252	it will be
S0251	maybe twenty minutes even yeah
S0252	at least twenty five minutes yeah
S0251	i think that's too early to get them to the train station
S0369	it be
S0251	for eight o'clock when you've that drive
S0252	i know
S0251	on country roads wake up it have snow she say i have a migraine the minute i wake up
S0369	mm
S0251	i say that be just what happen to me as soon as i wake up i know this day be not go to be
S0369	mm
S0251	alright
S0368	mm
S0251	and
S0369	so really anxiety bring that on with the the realise the problems that they've get now
S0252	mm
S0251	so well i wonder whether it be the food intolerance actually the same as me
S0369	mm
S0251	soon as you wake up
S0251	you know whereas when you go to bed you're maybe not so bad but something have happen in the night and i think it's the digestion process have get
S0369	yeah because of anxiety maybe
S0251	try to work on it yeah
S0369	mm mm i mean
S0251	and it's go wrong
S0369	i always say that don't i your stomach be like another like another brain
S0368	sense
S0369	really
S0251	yes
S0369	yeah very sensitive i mean if you're frighten about something
S0251	yeah
S0369	it's butterfly in your stomach
S0368	yeah and nausea yes
S0369	it's that that you feel it's not there really
S0251	no
S0369	and yet it be up there but somehow
S0251	it's all connect
S0369	mm
S0251	isn't it
S0369	mm
S0251	so she say to i can't drive i just feel terrible
S0369	mm
S0251	i'm not i can't do it so she have her medication she say we'll just have to wait now until i the medication kick in and i feel a bite steadier
S0369	mm
S0251	so she say we know that we're go to miss the train now
S0369	mm settle for it
S0251	so she say we wait half an hour and start to feel a bite better i don't know what tablets she oh i think she have the migrelief tablets doesn't she
S0252	mm
S0251	that i use to have
S0369	do you recognise them
S0251	yes
S0369	mm
S0251	so they set off she say i be only do about twenty miles an hour cos i be really scar the roads be really bad
S0369	mm
S0251	and we get to the bridge and she erm lose control of the car it skid on the ice and crash into a farmer's fence
S0369	mm
S0251	the exhaust separate from the car
S0369	mm
S0251	so they be ground
S0369	so they
S0251	they be ground
S0369	oh
S0251	they couldn't move
S0369	mm
S0251	so she be try to
S0369	cos it might have be partly in like in a ditch you know
S0251	yeah
S0369	that type of thing
S0251	at an yeah she say it be
S0369	mm
S0251	at an angle
S0369	mm
S0251	couldn't move it so she have to wait for a farmer to come with a tractor to er
S0251	pull her out
S0369	mm
S0251	and then somebody else come along in a car and they put the daughter in the car to take her to
S0369	to station mm
S0251	and she er try to get the farmer to pull the car out of that position and then he take her back to her house to ring the garage
S0369	he tow it back for her
S0251	no they just pull it straight
S0369	mm
S0251	but he take her back home but they leave the car
S0369	oh to the garage to go get it mm
S0251	then they ring the garage to erm bring the trailer
S0369	mm
S0251	or whatever
S0369	mm
S0251	to do that and then the next day she get a letter from the farmer say
S0369	er
S0251	he want three hundred pound to mend the fence she say it's only like pole with barb wire it's not
S0369	it's it's no wonder you know
S0251	you get a migraine
S0369	yeah at home
S0368	and then there's the
S0369	you can
S0368	car to repair
S0369	it's a wonder you don't
S0251	yeah
S0369	have a complete nervous breakdown isn't it
S0369	mm mm
S0368	really
S0369	and
S0368	she shouldn't have go out in the first place should she but then you don't know do you
S0369	and what about another fifty say or a hundred for trespass
S0251	oh yeah
S0369	mm
S0369	trespass oh mm
S0368	well he soon get that off didn't he
S0251	yeah of course they then i have to tell my husband which be another
S0368	mm
S0251	about the car crash about the bill
S0369	mm
S0368	yeah
S0251	then there's the bill to mend the car
S0369	yeah that would be something and be it worth mend anyhow
S0251	no not really well it's ten slash it's a bite like my old corsa i think it
S0369	mm
S0251	become a point where it's not really
S0369	mm mm
S0251	economical but there again if you don't haven't get anything
S0369	you aren't gonna get a bottle of milk mm
S0251	then she say do you know i say to my husband i never want to buy this house in the first place
S0369	mm
S0251	why can't we live somewhere sensible
S0369	yeah
S0368	oh
S0251	so they have that row
S0369	why do they live there
S0369	why do they live there
S0369	if they're not farmers then or anything
S0251	no he use to work at city council
S0369	ah well that then
S0251	do that explain shall i just
S0369	say no more
S0251	stop there
S0369	say not more
S0251	stop there
S0251	then he get make redundant didn't he
S0252	yeah i think so
S0251	he take the cash or whatever
S0369	yes
S0251	and then
S0252	they want to well he'd sort of semi retire and
S0251	semi retire they'd get this house and it's get a holiday let with it which she be go to do but the house need load of work on it
S0369	oh
S0251	they have to rent accommodation for about a year well
S0368	mm
S0369	that's
S0251	while
S0369	deplete the golden
S0251	it's
S0369	handshake
S0251	yes while he do the work he fell seriously ill
S0369	yeah because he be
S0251	without put too far a point on it erm and have operations et cetera so he couldn't do the work and then he get better then he get the work then they discover the damp course be wrong the erm the soil be too far at the side of the house
S0369	yeah
S0251	it be make all the damp the wall
S0369	yeah
S0251	damp
S0369	damp and
S0251	she be say it smell horrible in here and it be the damp and
S0369	mm
S0251	so that take a long time dig all that off and make that right and then they get it go erm and then what happen he get some consultancy work
S0252	in erm be it
S0368	oh
S0252	er in
S0251	in i think it's near london isn't it
S0369	that be that just outside er in london i think
S0251	so things be start to look up a bite because that mean he's away all week
S0369	oh dear
S0251	so she's just in the house with
S0369	yeah
S0369	ah
S0251	so she be feel a bite better
S0369	mm
S0251	and then he he just come home for weekend
S0369	mm
S0368	and ruin everything
S0369	yeah
S0251	and then
S0369	mm
S0251	you've get to spill the bean
S0252	yeah
S0251	she say i want to live in i think that would be better
S0369	mm well even so that could be yeah you've really get to look at
S0251	think about the weather
S0369	winter time
S0251	winter yeah
S0369	particularly in this area
S0251	mm
S0369	you see
S0252	mm
S0369	you know it's sort of er these place do get cut off and you might the main road be fine
S0251	yes
S0369	but to get to it they because a lot of these er farmers' hedge
S0368	yeah
S0369	now have get gap in
S0251	mm
S0369	and the wind blow through that
S0368	oh yes oh yeah
S0369	and it blow the snow and what have you
S0368	drift it yeah
S0369	and it all bank up and it because that's why they try and fill all them gap in to keep it off from blow up the field onto the road and block the road
S0252	mm
S0369	but you know these farmers they're er very military and
S0251	mm
S0369	what have you
S0369	and keep it and don't want to spend a penny
S0251	no
S0369	if they can get somebody else to do it
S0252	mm
S0251	yes they will do so
S0369	but that that's er a bite much isn't it to do that
S0252	probably wouldn't be as bad if you have a four by four vehicle
S0369	well that may be so but well i'm glad you mention that because er there be a a letter in our paper where there's be er there's be quite a few letter in about the council not keep some of these roads clear they do the main roads and then say the road er to or or be be a good one because bite of a hill there and that and they don't do anything there and you can't get out or it's you know it's dangerous and people be skid off and we saw one didn't we
S0368	mm
S0369	in the the ditch like you see
S0368	yeah
S0369	er cos i say to you didn't i
S0368	mm
S0369	oh that's gonna take a job get out and without do any damage like any further damage but this be the thing there'd be quite a few of these things happen and er another i mean to keep it to bring another bloke write a letter in and it make sense really because he say there's all this people who be live in these place who know that this be gonna happen and yet they won't fit winter tyres
S0252	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	if you fit winter now i don't know what winter tyres be but anyhow if you fit winter tyres you'd have none of this skid or anything like that and he say er for a matter of about three hundred pound you could get the four wheel do and when spring come take them off and put your others back on
S0251	yeah somebody in earlier say to me we've be trap in the house for three days because of the snow this be our first time
S0369	mm
S0251	we've be out since then and instead i've erm put my winter tyres on
S0368	mm
S0369	and
S0251	i say what be winter tyres
S0369	yes what be they
S0251	he say they're a bite fatter a bite wider
S0369	yeah
S0251	so you've get more grip i think
S0369	mm
S0252	also a different type of i think as well
S0251	do it
S0369	yeah
S0252	mm
S0251	do you need a bite more contact
S0252	mm
S0369	i know i know er some people use to i don't know the value of it but you know i can see the logic in it use to instead of have say thirty two pound pressure
S0251	oh let a bite out yes
S0369	they'd let a bite out
S0251	yes
S0369	and make it a bite so as it's softer
S0251	a bite spongier yes
S0369	and er so you know it's a bite fatter
S0251	a bite more soft
S0369	cos when you think that be the only contact with the road
S0251	yes
S0369	and so really you're probably look at er five square inch or something on
S0251	mm
S0369	on each er
S0251	actual yeah
S0369	each wheel like
S0251	mm
S0369	and that's your contact
S0251	mm
S0369	er and in certain instance it
S0251	yeah
S0369	it's not enough and
S0251	right
S0369	mm so the winter tyres
S0251	so you'd need to have a lot of supply lay in if you
S0368	yeah
S0251	have the potential to be cut off or
S0368	mm
S0251	well it be three days that time
S0369	mm
S0251	but it wouldn't necessarily be three it could be longer depend
S0368	no we didn't have that much do we really
S0251	no no and he say they didn't come the normal route they come do they say via or something
S0252	didn't say
S0251	to avoid some
S0252	that's this
S0251	country roads that they know would be
S0252	i suspect it's between and that they
S0251	mm
S0252	avoid which be essentially the back route between
S0251	yeah
S0252	and
S0369	you just look at that er where we have that nice picnic at something hall
S0251	yeah
S0369	hall
S0251	yes
S0369	at
S0252	yes
S0369	look at that route there
S0251	yes it's very er
S0369	and i'm not talk about big deep drift i'm just talk about say just a little dust of maybe
S0251	there be some bad hill there
S0369	and inch or so
S0251	sustain hill
S0252	mm
S0368	mm
S0251	with twist
S0368	mm
S0369	but you see
S0251	but it's quite a drive
S0369	the centrifugal force be do this and
S0251	yeah
S0369	you go and
S0251	and there'd be nobody to help you
S0369	there use to be a
S0251	it's really lonely
S0368	it be
S0251	down there
S0369	mm at fair because we go on it didn't we
S0368	mm
S0369	there be a a swing shall we call it and it be a you know like er wall of death it be a big round
S0251	mm
S0369	er
S0251	a drum
S0368	like big wheel
S0369	wheel sort of thing
S0251	mm
S0369	a drum
S0368	mm
S0369	and you you go in and there's all cage at the side and you go in one of these and they shut the cage like you're in
S0251	do you go in
S0368	mm
S0369	oh yeah we've be in mm
S0251	do you enjoy it
S0368	many years ago
S0251	oh
S0368	i must admit
S0251	cos oh
S0369	oh yeah this be when
S0251	mm
S0252	when we be jack and jill
S0252	er and they spin it real fast
S0251	yes
S0369	you see so and the flow go away from you
S0251	yeah
S0369	the flow actually go down
S0251	mm
S0369	and you're
S0251	push against the side
S0369	push against the the side like and that centrifugal force push you out
S0251	be that what you say that's centrifugal force be that
S0368	something like that similar
S0251	similar
S0368	and then the floor use to come back and
S0251	yeah
S0368	oh dear
S0251	and you
S0369	and then it slow down and you get out you wasn't shout that you wasn't shout
S0369	you shout help
S0369	help things like that
S0251	i bet
S0369	stop it
S0251	yes yeah
S0368	i want to get down
S0369	but you see a a car's like that as well
