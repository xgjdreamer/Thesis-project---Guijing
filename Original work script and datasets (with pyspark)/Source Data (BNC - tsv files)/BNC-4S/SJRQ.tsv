S0391	a comparison and you know that programme what's it call
S0390	i don't watch it

S0391	they they show they they get somebody's specification
S0392	mystery house

S0393	yeah
S0391	to meet what they require and then they throw in a wild card and chance be
S0392	mystery house
S0393	it's always a good idea isn't it
S0391	they like the mystery house
S0392	yeah
S0391	that's why it's good to look at a few
S0392	it's never very different to the normal house though be it really
S0393	no the mystery house instead of the usual seven bedrooms we're gonna give you what you need one bedroom
S0391	no but do you know what i mean it be worth compare
S0390	yes
S0392	however there be an outbuilding with a possible fifteen bedrooms
S0391	then you get to spot er bargain as well
S0393	step this way to walk into an aesop's fable agree
S0390	actually just a think of okay it's expensive live in just a think
S0392	it turn out to be it fall down
S0390	that's probably worth that's how my thinking's go at the moment because let's face it i'll start need certain things and you don't like to burden people and keep ask would you do this and would you do that

S0390	what
S0391	the pay as you go

S0391	i i never switch it off though
S0390	you switch it on there
S0392	oh with that button there
S0391	yeah but you might get a different make out of it
S0392	yeah i'd better not show you cos you might get a different one
S0391	they're all different
S0392	they're all different yeah
S0391	you don't want to learn how to switch it on cos once it's on you never turn it off do you see what i mean so once we'd
S0390	i just want to see that fox again
S0391	once we've switch it on for you show how you make a call
S0390	let's have a look
S0391	once we've switch it on for you
S0392	turn it on
S0390	yeah
S0392	you're in lock there so you just swipe it to unlock it
S0390	now where's the fox
S0392	that's on the other one
S0390	oh be that yours
S0391	you can you can put no that's 's you can put any picture on you want if you want a fox we'll get you a fox but if you show nanny how to do a text and a phone call
S0392	text
S0391	but but because once your phone's switch on you never turn it off
S0392	the message er new message and then you use the little keyboard to type like that
S0390	oh er yes yeah yeah yeah
S0392	yeah
S0390	well i'll yes i'm sure 'll show me
S0392	be your phone alright though surely
S0390	well it's okay but it doesn't
S0392	you can get a new one that's just like that if you want
S0390	you can't get those though
S0392	oh yeah you er you can get a similar little
S0390	your mum buy me that at least
S0391	yeah but you can get a similar there's a lot of them about if you don't want
S0392	yeah but you can get one very similar you don't need a fancy screen
S0390	well maybe i maybe i'm go to sort of come up in the world
S0392	well i don't think it's come up in the world
S0391	it depend what you need it for if you're only texting and call you don't need internet
S0390	i only text and call because that's all i can do
S0391	that's what i mean do you want internet as well oh you do right but you want pay as you go
S0390	if possible
S0391	depend you see if you have to decide how long you're gonna be on it and how many call and how much internet you're gonna use cos you might be better on a contract do you see what i mean that's what you'll have to decide
S0390	yes yes
S0391	because their pay as you go be really good but they don't use it much at all but if you're gonna be use the internet on it
S0390	mm
S0391	you might be better with a monthly contract
S0390	well i'll think about what er
S0391	do you see what i mean
S0390	yes i'm not go to be frighten of technology i'm go to get with it
S0391	no but but but but that's what i mean so you'll have to decide er
S0390	mm
S0391	whether you want a monthly contract or pay as you go
S0390	well we have a monthly contract and it be disastrous and i we be always frighten of lose the phone or
S0392	oh but if you're the best thing about a contract be if you lose a phone they just send you a new one free
S0391	you get a free phone
S0390	no but what happen if somebody use it or as soon as you've lose it
S0391	just tell them straight away
S0392	well that's the point of the contract there's no limit to how much you spend there's a limit that's the thing about it
S0391	you just tell them it's you've lose it
S0392	you will be worry if you're on pay as you go cos then they can spend your money if you're on a contract
S0390	it use to be the other way round you use to pay to rent it and then you'd pay for your call as well
S0391	ah it's different now though
S0392	oh no when
S0392	when be that
S0391	it's yeah it's different
S0390	the first one i ever have in nineteen eighty
S0392	what the eighties oh right okay
S0391	you see if if if if you're on er a contract you wouldn't have that worry cos that would include everything and if you lose it you would just tell them
S0392	how much do you spend a month nowadays
S0390	well i get fifty pound on my phone about nine months ago
S0392	ah right fifty divide by nine be
S0391	yeah but if she's gonna use the internet or
S0392	five pound something
S0391	that's without the internet
S0390	you can't
S0392	yeah but internet's free in most place
S0391	it be free like it's free here
S0392	you would only use mobile data if you be really push and you didn't have anywhere else
S0390	now i want you to come with me with my erm laptop and i want us to go into either or nero's or somewhere
S0392	come here
S0391	yeah
S0390	or here i would've bring it if i'd've and for you to show me how to get onto the wi fi here
S0392	yeah cos then once you can do that you
S0390	and then what to do when i get home
S0392	oh when you get home's fine
S0390	that's what everybody say and it never flame be
S0392	oh you've do it before
S0390	er no well you see i go down to 's and put it onto his and i have such a job to get it back onto the wi fi at home i'd no idea
S0392	i'll show you how you get onto wi fi anywhere whether it's home here anywhere
S0391	we'll show you we'll call in on the way back and he'll show you
S0392	yeah
S0391	yeah we'll
S0390	yeah cos then then i can give you those things
S0391	mm
S0392	and i'll tell you er and you i can sort out all your problems when we're there
S0390	you could maybe take
S0391	if it fit in yeah well just just show her now
S0392	i'll sort your problems there out when we
S0391	yeah
S0392	call in yeah
S0391	we'll head back and we'll we'll we can have a look
S0390	your dad's get his erm groceries
S0391	seed yeah
S0392	yeah well let's wait a bite we'll wait for him to come back then we'll move
S0391	right
S0392	yeah
S0391	that's a good idea but er
S0390	i haven't get a watch on anybody get a watch
S0392	no what time be it
S0391	you see if if you if you're happy carry your laptop around you might just want a phone that texts and call
S0392	yeah
S0390	i'm not happy carry it around
S0391	right
S0390	but sometimes i want to take it around
S0392	i think that you might be i don't know whether that
S0390	it's too heavy
S0391	right
S0392	that that if it's heavy if it's slow and it's just like not work it sound like it's like quite old or not
S0390	it's only flip a year and a bite old don't you tell me it's old
S0391	have a look at it
S0392	i'll have to have a look at it yeah
S0391	it might have a lot of stuff
S0392	might have a lot of rubbish on that we can just forget about and it's good to go again
S0391	yeah
S0390	mm
S0391	yeah it sound as if it do
S0392	it do actually yeah bloatware
S0391	cos if it's if it's only a year old it shouldn't be slow
S0390	er yeah and something else i don't know if it's get any protection on it say it have but i'm not sure
S0392	i'll check that it'll probably have a akg i'd have think
S0390	look i don't know i need you to show me okay
S0391	'll show you
S0392	i'll sort all that out for you
S0390	and fancy when i first saw you
S0391	mm
S0390	i couldn't believe that fifteen years later you're tell me all about how to do my internet
S0391	yeah yeah
S0390	oh it's well this be the second er
S0391	you'll have to
S0390	second day of your holiday
S0392	yeah
S0391	have to decide
S0391	i i when i'm think er if you're gonna be use the internet on something like that i think they're i think
S0392	i i think you'll get you won't like the screen
S0391	i think erm your tariff would be good
S0392	yeah but to be honest mobile data when you're on a pay as you go you're reluctant to use it cos it just sort of disappear you're better off just use your wi fi ain't you
S0391	yeah but er if you think er if you think nanny's gonna be in shop where it's free wi fi
S0392	yeah yeah yeah
S0391	so i think she be better on your tariff
S0392	but then we'll have to see whether you'll be able to get network in cos although they've get ninety nine percent coverage for the country
S0390	oh
S0392	i remember see on er do you get phone network where you live now on your
S0390	's bad get what
S0392	network
S0391	it go down doesn't it your mobile network
S0390	oh sometimes it doesn't work at all
S0392	can you pick up texts
S0390	well if i don't reply it's not work you know i always even if i just send one word back
S0391	mm
S0390	once i've get the text i feel i owe it to the person send it to let them know i've er it's arrive
S0392	yeah but we can't get signal in our house at all apart from one place you might find that however once you've move you'll easily get definitely there
S0391	oh yeah i be gonna say that's true
S0390	mm
S0392	so that might be a little encouragement to move so that your phone work
S0390	well that's the thing i'm make from when i when they invite me down to have a look at the flats i must ask if they have internet cos if they don't have internet
S0392	they don't have wi fi there's not
S0391	it won't be free wi fi
S0392	it will be it will be i'd've think
S0391	but it'll it won't i think nanny'll have to get her own
S0392	oh no it'll be free wi fi if it's like a house where lot of people be oh yeah definitely
S0390	oh i don't know we're all
S0391	i don't know
S0390	they won't be expect many people there to have computers and things
S0392	it will be even no what it'll be be they'll have it for the lobby office sort of thing downstairs
S0391	oh you mean you can just hook into theirs
S0392	and you'll be able to just they'll give you their password if you say yeah
S0391	oh that's true it's like like the university halls of residence isn't it
S0390	oh right yeah
S0392	yeah you get it free there because
S0391	then yeah
S0392	yeah
S0391	yeah it could work like that i'm not sure i don't know how they work
S0390	anyhow i'm compile a list of question to ask
S0391	it's a good point ask them
S0390	so if you're free when they invite me down
S0391	yeah
S0390	i mean it might not be for a while yet though
S0391	uhu
S0390	but i think i'll have a look at those house near erm
