S0687	uhu
S0688	be it straight on to rovinj
S0690	i think so
S0688	i think it say go back in the book but
S0687	well show you the map so
S0690	i think it's up here a bite and then turn right i
S0687	start off at porec then cut down here go up here down here and can you see how at the mouth of the that river there we're up here at the tip of it they make a bite there's no road over so you have to come inland to get over it to get back out to rovinj there can you see
S0689	that sound very confuse
S0688	yeah the book describe just go back but
S0689	that's a blind corner that innit
S0688	it be
S0687	that be an excellent cake that be better than our cake at properly a slice of that and
S0688	cup of tea
S0687	mm
S0688	cake be
S0687	they're better aren't they airy
S0688	yeah
S0687	and just taste of nothing
S0688	artificial
S0687	we do a proper cake
S0688	even not cake our fruit tarts be better aren't they
S0687	everything abroad be like like you know like where the birthday cake be like look like this glisten
S0688	yeah
S0687	like frost like costco cake
S0688	yeah just like that
S0687	i always use to want a costco birthday cake cos that be always
S0688	do you
S0687	mm
S0688	rather than the one i'd make
S0687	mm it wasn't that i didn't want the one you'd make i just think that you know like
S0688	that be the thing to do
S0687	cos you could have your name ice on it and everything
S0688	yeah sorry
S0687	it's alright
S0689	we have a horrible childhood didn't we
S0689	yeah
S0687	cruise
S0688	so yeah you've be you've gotta be careful with those truffles once you open them
S0687	mm
S0688	that be my think well how do they stay fresh
S0689	well when you sterilise it all the microorganisms can't respire so they die then
S0687	yeah
S0689	they they
S0688	but then she be say you've gotta keep some moisture in there so they don't
S0687	dry out
S0688	yeah
S0687	mm interest her say about in posh restaurants where they give you a meal
S0688	yeah and then you
S0687	and they give you your erm
S0688	gold grater
S0687	they they give it you at the side and you grate how much you want
S0689	thing be though you might get if you do a naff job somebody else might get the manky leftovers of yours do you understand what i mean if you do a naff job grate do you understand what i'm try to say or not
S0687	no
S0689	i'm
S0688	it to be honest it's it's like a slice
S0687	but it's like a wafer thin slice isn't it it's like you know like the cheese slicer
S0688	that's why i feel like i i've never see any i've see i think what's it call though the one who do all things it like what's that
S0689	heston blumenthal
S0688	yeah i've see him grate truffles into something but i would imagine it's like overwhelm if you're have just a thin slice
S0687	mm well
S0688	of it
S0687	yeah
S0688	you could taste it in there
S0687	it's so strong
S0688	and that's why i think we'd be better i don't
S0687	okay
S0688	but if you can make your own oil maybe it's better to get some oil
S0687	grate a bite in
S0688	buy one truffle and could make our own oil
S0689	if you dice the truffle dead thin
S0687	i think one truffle's a lot though isn't it
S0688	no you could make like three or four bottle couldn't you
S0687	yeah i be say the most expensive
S0689	how much be one truffle
S0688	depend on the size of

S0687	i no because i've work on the tobacco
S0689	yeah i know i get that
S0688	there's a house right on top of a hill there to your right can you see
S0689	so what else do they stick what else do they stick in cigarettes then to like fill them out
S0687	mm i don't know really but like
S0689	i don't know
S0687	not nice stuff
S0688	i don't i'd be the nicotine an intrinsic part of the tobacco
S0687	i think so
S0688	i truly don't know
S0689	cos i read once that they put rat poison in but i don't know if that be a lie
S0687	i don't think it's rat poison
S0688	i've hear that stuff that's sell on the black market
S0687	yeah
S0688	they put all kinds of rubbish in well it's all rubbish isn't it anyway not an issue to you
S0689	no i don't smoke
S0688	it's have a huge a huge impact on people die of heart attack and cancer
S0689	well lung cancer's the most common cancer isn't it
S0688	be it it's the most poorly treat
S0687	i think pancreatic be the more poorly treat
S0688	i don't think pancreatic's as common be it
S0687	it's not no it's get a very low survival rate
S0688	yeah
S0687	mm that's what my friend who shave her head be raise money for
S0688	pancreatic cancer
S0687	yeah i think her grandad have die from it so she be raise money for it
S0688	the thing be you can't survive without your pancreas can you
S0687	no well i didn't understand on twenty four hours in a and e be it or something like that no it wasn't that i can't remember what programme it be erm well i saw it on gogglebox there be erm there be erm a boy an eight year old boy who need a new liver and his dad
S0689	oh yeah
S0687	give it and his dad give his but i say how would his dad survive without a liver
S0688	no you can take a of it and it regenerate itself
S0687	oh
S0688	i mean it be amaze cos you've get your hepatic portal there and you've get all the blood vessels that support it they must have use his exist blood vessels to er
S0687	right anyway they give it him and it
S0689	reject
S0687	fail within forty eight hours and this little boy
S0688	oh
S0687	be really really ill so they bump him up the organ donor list and like six weeks later he he get erm he get a transplant and erm he be do well but you can imagine his dad go through all that and then he reject it the little boy
S0688	they must have do tissue type
S0687	they must have do yeah
S0688	yeah
S0687	but he say he say like literally forty eight hours after the surgery they know it hadn't go well
S0688	oh
S0689	i wonder could they have not use stem cells to like
S0688	well they're try to do that now aren't they they're er use stem cells to grow organs
S0687	mm there be erm a stem cell thing that be on erm that the vet be do the super vet he it be erm er what's it call where the ball and socket in your hip doesn't form properly
S0688	mm
S0687	where the sockets aren't
S0688	yeah he do
S0687	what's it call and he and he erm inject stem cells and it reform
S0688	it grow the cup part
S0687	it it it
S0688	it grow the
S0687	be like a socket part better than it be what's it call that
S0688	what
S0687	that condition
S0688	hip displacement
S0687	that's the one
S0689	i can't believe people be against stem cells it's such a
S0687	why be people against it
S0689	it's cos they're take from embryos so they say it's like
S0688	sometimes they be but we've get a company in at the hospital collect erm stem cells from placentas
S0689	yeah you can do it from placentas umbilical cord
S0687	oh so like be they gonna ask for if they want to donate
S0688	yeah well they can pay to have their own save or if they just donate the blood from the placenta er the hospital get about a tenner for it but the company be be it's it's like two chinese women
S0687	right
S0689	do it it's call
S0687	be it proper
S0688	it's call yeah it's kosher the hospital let's them come in they pay the hospital to be there
S0687	right
S0689	i think it's a really really cool thing to do i mean we learn about it in biology it's really clever how they do it
S0687	so women can pay to have their
S0688	yeah
S0687	stem be it their stem cells or the baby's stem cells
S0688	the baby
S0687	store from the placenta
S0688	yeah
S0687	or they can donate it
S0688	or they can just donate it to er then i presume they sell it on
S0687	you'd just keep it wouldn't you in case your child ever need it
S0688	well you would but you don't you don't need that really
S0687	you don't need all of it
S0688	also they're do that
S0687	to be honest i don't know i don't know what i think about donate it so someone else can sell it for a profit
S0688	yeah i know
S0687	donate it so that someone
S0688	can make money from it
S0687	yeah well well i be gonna say to help you know like if somebody need a new liver or whatever not donate for someone else to make a fortune
S0688	i i question them about it and they
S0690	it's not gonna happen unless someone make a profit
S0688	they're dead shady about it
S0687	i be gonna say it sound a bite questionable
S0690	yeah but
S0687	do the women know that they're donate it to be sell
S0688	well they don't give them all the information but i've ask and ask and ask them but you see the thing be
S0687	how many women do it
S0688	they're not well organise enough cos they the the they work from seven in the morning till eight at night at the moment but they're
S0687	these two women
S0688	yeah er but they're gonna be twenty four hours soon
S0687	right
S0688	erm cos they have to collect
S0687	so they can collect them quickly
S0688	yeah they have to collect it within
S0689	be it just those two women run it
S0688	they're work for company
S0689	well they must
S0688	but there be other company that use to come in before i've collect it before now
S0687	mm
S0688	when it first start
S0687	how long ago
S0688	about ten years ago
S0687	right
S0688	er no probably be more like about twelve years ago cos i be work in er women would come with the pack
S0687	mm
S0688	and we'd take it from the placenta and they and then ring the company and they'd come and send a van and collect it take it off for process
S0687	how much do people pay for it
S0688	and then they spend two thousand pound
S0689	wow
S0688	it's worth it though if you have it when you think people spend that on a pram
S0689	so people spend two grand on a pram
S0688	yeah it's ridiculous yeah i'd rather have a second hand pram and do that and save your baby's stem cells
S0689	i dunno why you'd save the baby's stem cells though
S0688	well if they if they have a problem
S0687	because if if if in the
S0689	yeah
S0688	an illness
S0687	in the future
S0688	i suppose in they first use it for leukaemia so if a child develop leukaemia they could use the stem cells to just inject the bone marrow and they can cultivate it so it's not like they use them up they carry on reproduce in the right condition
S0689	yeah but those condition be extremely hard to find
S0688	no in the laboratory
S0689	trust me mum we've do about it in biology they're try to find the way different the different like so they test different condition and what those different condition do to the way that the cells
S0687	reproduce
S0689	no it's call right basically a stem cell be an undifferentiated cell
S0687	yeah
S0689	so before when a cell be form it's not a a a liver cell or a
S0687	yeah exactly it's just cell
S0688	heart cell and a if it differentiate to become a certain cell
S0687	yeah yeah
S0689	so an undifferentiated cell mean that it's not pick what it be cell it be yet basically
S0687	yeah
S0689	so i'm say scientists be try to find the condition need to turn the cells in a er like when cultivate them to the cells that they want
S0688	oh i know but i what i'm say be in the raw form as an
S0687	yeah
S0688	undifferentiated cell
S0687	it can just
S0688	they can just inject that they can just reproduce
S0689	oh yeah sorry i didn't right yeah i understand
S0688	so that's what i'm say
S0689	yeah
S0687	i didn't think
S0688	run out
S0687	yeah i i it's not i didn't think it be like they've get a stem cell and then they grow a liver in a test tube they inject those to wherever it be in that and you within your body it it work i think be that right
S0688	no but they're try to grow organs now from stem cells
S0687	right
S0688	so they're try to
S0687	so like in vitro stem
S0689	they've work on mice and rat i know that
S0688	they yeah they've be put them into a pig haven't they they've just inject they take a they grow a heart in a pig
S0687	right
S0689	they've be grow insulin in pig for years haven't they
S0687	and then what do they take it out of the pig then and put it in a human
S0688	mm
S0687	so it be a bite questionable
S0689	yeah but
S0687	i suppose
S0689	a pig for a human you know
S0687	yeah absolutely if you know if it be and it be a pig or absolutely
S0690	bacon sandwich
S0687	pick apple pork
S0688	she just keep say to me it's a charity it's a charity or something
S0687	yeah do they speak good english
S0688	mm not bad
S0687	yeah
S0688	the thing be they've not get themselves well organise enough they come let so they'll come up to the birth suite and say be anyone in labour what woman want to talk about that
S0687	yeah
S0688	when she's give birth
S0687	i be gonna say
S0688	they need to do it antenatally
S0687	surely it should be something that they discuss with people beforehand and get them to agree to it beforehand
S0688	yeah
S0687	but you know like anyone who not be nasty but anyone who would understand why they would want their stem cells would surely want to save them for themselves
S0689	sorry i don't
S0687	for their child
S0689	understand what you're say
S0687	do you know what i mean
S0688	yeah i i suppose
S0687	like like why would you agree to give away the stem cells for some you know not be like
S0688	you'd be amaze
S0687	be completely
S0688	how few take or take it up
S0687	what to
S0688	i don't
S0687	to donate it
S0688	mm like erm
S0687	or to keep them
S0688	no take them
S0690	i think it's the road to rijeka isn't it the one mum say
S0687	i'm check it yes if you want to go on the toll yes although
S0688	yeah
S0687	i'd have i'd have still go the other way i don't know mum i don't know how
S0689	let's see how much the toll be
S0688	you won't know till you're come off
S0687	oh it tell you up there
S0689	can you see
S0687	depend how far you go
S0690	the and the map's too small to tell you the name of the road that take you up to montovun
S0687	i think there be no name for it dad it's just you come off from pazin
S0690	pazin
S0687	i think it's call junction three if i'm read this map right yeah junction three you're come off
S0689	certainly a cool thing to think about isn't it you know in er ten years' time we'll be able to replace entire organs
S0688	well it's such a gift isn't it
S0689	i
S0688	to be able to do that
S0689	have i tell you about nanomedicine i'm sure i've tell you about this mum
S0687	what's that
S0689	we do about it in chemistry it's about basically you you make you nanoparticles be particle be er a be be particles basically that be tiny basically it they they're a they're er average a hundred atoms like in
S0690	look at the size of that
S0687	don't know
S0690	sorry yeah i'm listen
S0689	erm a hundred atoms like you know erm
S0690	oh so it lead to a factory
S0689	erm and basically you can make these things call fullerenes i can't pronounce it's spell f u l l e r e n e s i think
S0688	fullerenes
S0689	yeah and er basically they're tube of carbon erm and they're be use like in like lubricants erm all sort of stuff and basically nanomedicine be the hope be through these carbon tube call fullerenes you'll be able to direct medicine medicine directly to cells so like
S0688	okay
S0689	so like
S0687	so like the cancerous cells
S0689	yeah so you so say with like not just cancer but like all type of cells like you know if you take a medicine it might damage your other cells and get you a bite groggy in like the future hopefully it'll just be able to target individual cells like that and then you'll recover quickly i think it be really really clever
S0688	they're say that about diet in the future though aren't they you know
S0687	what
S0688	not everyone everyone process food differently
S0687	differently yeah
S0689	mum would you speak up i can't hear what you're say
S0688	they're say everyone process food differently
S0689	right
S0688	so the idea be be that they'll be individually er like genetically er organise diet certain foods'll
S0689	oh so you'll
S0688	work better
S0689	right i understand what you're say so you'll like it's you'll be like
S0687	you'll have a genetic test and then they'll tell you
S0689	yeah
S0687	how you how you digest bread or
S0689	yeah that's clever
S0688	it's like different have different body shape don't they you know you store fat in different place
S0687	well it's like erm 's husband be say to me that people have different normal level of glucose
S0688	yeah i mean how can it be that erm women who don't have wide hips be more prone to heart disease so you know women who go straight down
S0687	yeah
S0688	and don't have a shape
S0687	yeah why be that
S0688	why be that it's like it's like they've get a more android digestion that that i suppose cos men be more prone to heart disease than women aren't they
S0687	strange
S0689	this road be dead isn't it
S0687	pardon
S0689	this road's dead
S0688	my ears be pop
S0689	be they
S0687	it might be pick up a lot of the erm
S0689	that's what i be think
S0687	road noise or rest on that i don't know you'll have to listen and make sure it sound okay
S0689	hopefully it will be
S0687	oh dear me isa hungry
S0689	i'm really hungry thirsty as well
S0688	you have that water didn't you
S0689	yeah be we gonna have a brew or be you gonna have a drink
S0688	when we get in
S0689	yeah
S0688	erm don't i'll probably have a cup of tea while we make something to eat need to get some diesel tomorrow
S0687	yeah
S0688	we need to make sure we bring everything in as well in case it rain again
S0689	what outside
S0688	yeah
S0689	yeah
S0687	be we gonna go out tomorrow or stay in
S0688	don't know
S0689	i vote stay but it's up to you guy
S0688	you vote stay in
S0689	i vote stay in but it's up to you guy
S0688	be you feel more relax
S0689	not really no i still have a i still keep have moments where i keep like have little i dunno
S0688	have little what love
S0689	like moments like i dunno like i feel like i should be work but then i have to remind myself i don't it feel it's not really sink in yet either that or i dunno maybe it's just reach a huge anti climax and that's it you know cos i think i'd be like sing and dance when i come out and i be just like oh right be that it
S0688	you be the same weren't you
S0687	i honestly can't remember it's so long ago but i'm sure i be
S0688	oh dear me lavender obviously be a big thing in this area isn't there
S0687	yeah
S0689	sorry what be that lavender
S0687	lavender
S0688	yeah
S0687	which exit be that dad
S0690	sorry
S0687	oh
S0689	i dunno if you know mum but you know like in american high school
S0690	three
S0687	yeah well it's exit three that you need i can't see a on this map
S0690	i know and i think this be exit two really
S0687	you think this well er i don't know you tell me which exit it be
S0688	it say three on it
S0690	it say three on the
S0688	sorry
S0689	i be say that like in american high school erm like twenty five percent or i think it might be twenty percent like your grade be just participation in class
S0690	so pazin
S0690	it say on or or pazin industrial so pazin next one
S0687	this be the only exit before pazin
S0690	be it well it say pazin straight on
S0687	well i'm look at the map and it's the only exit before pazin as far as i can see
S0689	cos like
S0687	and i can't see the name of the road to pick up to get up to get onto to motovun
S0690	i know it's such a it's such a poor map
S0689	this to me like american high school seem like kind of easy in comparison cos you do like load of like you don't really cos you test on well you so you your test count but like they can like it's it's other stuff
S0690	oh here you be motovun three hundred yards
S0689	like i know like twenty percent be participation and then like fifteen percent be like project you know like you'll do a project on i don't know mount everest or something it just seem like really really easy dunno maybe it's just me yeah but then you take that massive sit test don't you where it's like five and a half hours of like maths english science
S0688	i don't know
S0689	yeah
S0690	let's have a look
S0689	your sit like decide whether you which uni you go to and stuff
S0690	thank you
S0687	for english if you want thirteen
S0690	thirteen what have we get here no
S0687	what if you put a ten and then you've get some coin you've get a ten note in your wallet
S0690	have you get my wallet haven't you
S0687	no i do i give it to you oh
S0690	two
S0687	you've get a ten
S0690	three
S0689	how much be that about one fifty one seventy five
S0687	no dad top right bank bill
S0690	oh right
S0687	i think oh no maybe not i don't know i don't know
S0690	no i don't think it's that oh almost there yeah that's the right way
S0689	sort
S0690	sort
S0687	say pazin leave
S0689	do you know toll roads be they not run by the government be it like private company that run them
S0690	well private company put the money in to put them in in the first place
S0687	can you pop your window please dad it's cold
S0689	yeah so then they'll so they'll obviously take the profit won't they so it's it's private company
S0690	yeah
S0688	they usually be
S0689	i just can't think as much money cos it must cost you know millions of pound and if one pound seventy five per person
S0690	not gonna build much of a road be it
S0687	yeah bear in mind it's a monday even at half eight it's i'm sure it's
S0687	busier
S0689	that's true
S0687	should we fill up dad
S0690	no we'll do it tomorrow
S0689	you can see hill
S0687	mm
S0688	cos get home for the football
S0687	be that what he's rush for
S0688	yeah
S0687	be that why we go on the toll road
S0688	yeah
S0690	and spend a pound
S0689	it be you they're not wrong though be they let's face it no that's fine i wanna watch the football too it's fine they really on go to slovakia do you be it a bite of a
S0687	slovakia do you mean slovenia
S0689	think it be slovakia we're play tonight isn't it
S0690	yeah
S0689	yeah
S0687	why be you say you be gonna drive up to slovenia then what's slovenia get to do with it
S0689	try to tell me what team we're play i know more about football than you
S0687	no but you say why don't we drive up to slovenia to watch the match as if you be play slovenia that would make sense
S0689	why i didn't say that dad do
S0687	can't believe how much of this massive loaf of bread our have eat
S0690	yeah
S0689	trust me
S0690	that be only a pound as well
S0689	trust me
S0690	yeah what have you do with that fifty p regurgitate it immediately
S0689	it's
S0687	ouch dad can we slow down a bite i'm gonna be feel sick
S0689	i be just
S0687	the football will still be there
S0689	i be just think then i've not see any hairdressers you know
S0687	i have
S0689	have you
S0687	i've see load of barber's
S0689	oh i've not oh that sun's bright
S0687	oh there's a zip wire there
S0689	where
S0687	there to the right there oh my goodness it's across that galley we've get to come and do that come on
S0689	oh i can't even see it
S0687	let's see if we can see it well it say zip wire that way
S0688	be it advertise
S0687	and it's yeah look it's all oh no that's the electricity thing
S0689	no it's not let's not do the zip wire on that
S0687	can you not see the wire it must be over this like valley
S0689	where
S0687	i don't know i can't see it
S0688	would you do that
S0687	yeah i'd do that
S0689	she say
S0687	would you do that
S0689	i'd do it yeah
S0690	i know someone in the car who wouldn't do it
S0688	who
S0687	i'll
S0687	would you go and do a sky dive with me
S0689	i would i'd do a skydive
S0688	slow down a bite
S0687	don't wanna get stop by the po po
S0689	we certainly do not
S0688	the po po
S0689	plus they have handguns let's not get stop by the po po i find it weird how other countries have gun and it's just us that don't have gun you know what i mean
S0687	do you know which way you're go here dad
S0690	i'm follow the sign but you're welcome to check
S0687	yeah but we're not cos we don't want to go back to rijeka or pula or porec do we
S0690	well there be a sign that say that say er motovun this way but please check
S0687	well i don't know where we be dad be we haven't get a flame route
S0690	just come out of that place erm
S0687	i know we've just come out of
S0690	can't remember what it be call
S0687	i know we've just come out of pazin but this map be about as useful as a chocolate teapot
S0689	oh there's a quarry look
S0687	we're probs head in the right direction ish vaguely
S0689	another quarry in limestone maybe
S0690	yeah
S0687	there's another shrine there on the right
S0689	where oh yeah say you haven't have enough say you wanna try
S0687	didn't get any parmesan
S0689	oh we didn't dice with death that bird when they like fly across road
S0687	dad's gonna be dice with me be sick
S0689	please oh if you oh if you chunda i swear no already have one chunda this holiday
S0688	that overtake when we first get in the car the day before yesterday
S0687	sorry
S0688	it be like when erm
S0687	oh when he be overtake it be scary
S0688	yeah
S0687	yeah
S0688	what's he call the
S0689	sorry for that
S0687	yeah at least he apologise he must have hear us go oh they like their little hilltop towns don't they
S0688	they do don't they
S0689	say you haven't have enough say you wanna try it's in my head that
S0687	my ears just pop
