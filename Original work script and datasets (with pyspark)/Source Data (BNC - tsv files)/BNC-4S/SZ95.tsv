S0202	yeah
S0216	they be do like the night shift you know what i mean
S0202	yeah it's just not fair on people
S0216	and like i've notice right at my work i dunno if if someone do phone in sick then they just get proper slat like all day like yeah they couldn't even come in and i'm always like yeah but they might be ill and they're like yeah but they've drop us in it and it's like

S0216	oh god
S0202	so i have to do like another ten hour shift i get a two hour break and i've literally just go and sleep
S0216	yeah
S0202	and it be fuck awful i literally do about twenty six hours in
S0216	it's absolutely horrible
S0202	in just one shift
S0216	yeah
S0202	you don't get pay any extra cos it's overtime or anything like
S0216	yeah i know
S0202	cos at mcdonald's it's zero hour contract
S0216	yeah we don't get overtime or anything like that
S0202	so
S0216	we don't even get overtime on christmas day
S0216	like i'm work christmas day
S0202	you're fuck joke
S0216	nah
S0219	i don't even know what i'm do about christmas yet
S0216	do you not
S0219	no
S0216	well they've say like if you if you're work at christmas then you have to work christmas day like every single person it be a bite unfair on the people with kid and stuff but like they've say like literally every single person have to come in at one point on christmas day but
S0202	what the fuck be be you not spend it with your family then
S0219	christmas day
S0216	like well what they do be like they it'll only be like a three or four hour shift so they do everybody with little shift instead of like two people with big shift
S0202	yeah
S0216	it be better but like the the head like head office be decide whether they wanna open the pub on the night so that mean it'll be open till one like so then that'll be crap cos like i can deal with a day shift cos my mam just make like make the dinner a bite later and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0216	and like
S0202	you've gotta get out though as well haven't you
S0216	yeah
S0202	it's like a two hour trip
S0216	oh no it's like i work in in sunderland
S0202	oh okay
S0216	i'll just go back over christmas
S0202	oh right okay yeah
S0216	so i'll go back like christmas easter and summer so good but like yeah erm so i'm i'm really hop head office doesn't decide to keep it open on the night there will be it will be busy as well there will be people that like i think it's like lonely people come out on christmas day
S0202	mm
S0219	mm
S0216	like the regulars and stuff
S0219	cos i ah i dunno what i'll do
S0202	you should tell them you're go home you can't work
S0219	yeah
S0202	or ring in sick a few days and
S0219	no
S0202	say you're still not well
S0216	yeah you can
S0219	oh i'm not ring in sick
S0219	i can't ring in sick it's pretty obvious as well though innit
S0202	yeah like that's why i haven't get a job because i know be a student and shit like i would have to fuck work christmas and stuff and i just don't wanna do that
S0216	i i know like well i've not get a job this have one last year at but it be absolutely shit but like i just don't i don't think i can do it with uni work as well
S0202	yeah
S0216	just couldn't
S0202	do you get a full loan or d'you not have to have it so it's a personal
S0216	no no yeah i do well i i think i get like nine hundred erm per like semester because like my mam and dad own their own businesses so like they've do it as if like they can't determine how much my mam and dad earn
S0202	oh right
S0216	so like then i get the lowest amount well it's i don't think it's the lowest i think i've see people with lower but it's yeah it's like nine hundred but then one time i've get like one thousand one hundred so i think they're just i dunno like my my mam and dad have get an accountant and stuff so i dunno how i dunno how it i don't really understand
S0202	cos they're self employ
S0216	yeah
S0202	so like their their income will change from one day to the next
S0216	yeah
S0202	it's not a guarantee income
S0216	yeah
S0202	cos be self employ last year and that's how he get around the tax man like
S0216	yeah
S0202	and erm whatever you spend towards your business be you get deduct from your tax
S0216	yeah
S0202	so like last year earn twenty odd grand but he only pay two hundred quid tax because he put all his receipt in for petrol
S0219	oh
S0202	yeah
S0202	and like all the stuff that he buy and lot of things that he do so he have to pay two hundred quid tax that be it
S0216	yeah
S0219	that's alright
S0202	so for twenty grand like if you be work you'd pay
S0216	yeah i know
S0202	you'd pay a lot more than that
S0219	yeah
S0216	definitely
S0202	but
S0216	how much do yous get
S0219	erm erm i get i can't remember i get enough to cover my rent and that's it
S0216	yeah
S0219	erm which be
S0202	my mate next door she don't even get that she don't even get enough to cover her rent
S0216	oh my god
S0219	ah that's bad
S0202	her mum and dad have to pay it and stuff
S0216	that's so bad cos i like live off my loan but i give like
S0219	how
S0216	my grandad leave money so like that pay my rent so like that's all i live off my loan so like it isn't a lot but then it's better than have to like pay my rent at the same time
S0219	yeah
S0216	so i wouldn't
S0202	it's so unfair though that it go on your parent cos i'm not be funny or anything but like your parent if they have to give you money they'll give you money but most of the time so say like your mum and dad earn twenty grand a year each so they earn forty grand okay they they then get a mortgage and they have bill to how much money they get pay
S0219	mm
S0216	yeah
S0202	so if they didn't get pay that much money they wouldn't have things like sky they wouldn't have erm like they'd be careful heat and electric stuff like that but because they get pay a lot their bill be higher because they live to their mean
S0219	mm
S0216	yeah
S0202	if they don't get pay a lot and live to their mean
S0216	so i know
S0202	so for the student finance to turn round and say that your parent should have to should pay for you go through university
S0219	yeah it be yeah it be it's how many kid they have as well at
S0202	yeah
S0219	uni and stuff like
S0216	yeah
S0219	it be bad
S0202	and it's not your parent who be gonna pay your loan back it's you
S0216	yeah i know
S0202	and when you're eighteen let's face it you're not fuck
S0216	shouldn't be about anything to do with your parent cos like for example she's like move here like she doesn't really speak well she speak but she doesn't really live at home
S0202	yeah
S0216	like this be her house so it's like that's get nothing to do with her mum and dad it shouldn't
S0202	yeah see i be lucky cos i i look at it all before i apply to know how to wrangle it so i just cos i've not i've not actually live at home for a long with my parent for a long time and i'd work and stuff but i know that if i say that i live at this address for three years and i'd be support myself for three years
S0219	yeah you get more don't you yeah yeah yeah
S0202	then i get the full whack
S0216	yeah
S0202	and i purposely drop my hours at work so they put me on instead of a forty hour contract i be on a four hour contract but i just do the rest in overtime
S0216	yeah
S0202	cos overtime be not er
S0219	yeah
S0202	reliable income there's not always gonna be overtime
S0219	yeah
S0202	so
S0216	yeah
S0202	to them i be only i be only do four hours a week
S0216	yeah
S0202	so it go on my how much i earn
S0219	that's pretty good yeah
S0202	and i get like the full whack
S0216	oh that's really good
S0202	and i get
S0216	how much be the full whack
S0202	seven and a half grand ish
S0216	so like how much be that per semester
S0219	be it how much how much do you get i'm gonna check that
S0216	well per semester like nine hundred
S0202	i get about two and a half
S0219	it's like nearly three grand
S0202	i get about two and a half
S0216	yeah
S0202	per semester but i get a grant from uni as well
S0216	yeah
S0202	cos i'm poor
S0216	yeah
S0202	so
S0216	i don't i don't know if i get a grant i'm not sure
S0202	i get six grand last year then yeah you get three grand this year
S0216	oh my god

S0216	no i know
S0202	like ever it go straight to the uni anyway so there's no point
S0216	yeah
S0202	so i end up better better off for five five grand and then the grand lump sum that they give me
S0216	mm
S0219	yeah like i'm not suppose to be pay tuition fee this year but i think i'm still like student finance i think they're still pay it
