S0202	have you get
S0218	they can't do them for groom they do them for intent for groom because something
S0202	but the thing be they get put on the sex offenders register then and then people can know they're in the area do that make sense

S0218	i'm glad they don't like force him or beat him up
S0208	yeah
S0202	ah yeah
S0202	they stay within the law don't they
S0222	if they yeah if they force him or beat him up they wouldn't be able to do it again
S0202	the thing be though like he be to blame for this he shouldn't be put it on the fuck internet
S0222	i actually agree with her
S0202	yeah i do
S0208	mm
S0222	yeah but do you want that guy around her
S0208	rather no dad than a paedophile dad
S0222	yeah same
S0202	yeah but the thing be if like that's not anyone's choice to make
S0222	yeah but it be the
S0208	no i'm not say that but if i be grow up know that my dad be a paedophile i couldn't live with that
S0222	i wouldn't want
S0202	it's a mental illness though innit like you can't just turn round and say like i they're gonna be the same forever or like whatever but
S0222	no but you can turn around and say you don't want contact with your paedophile dad
S0202	yeah no but like they don't have that choice any more that choice be take away from them that be the point they don't have that choice like and yeah i wouldn't want a paedophile dad either but at least i would have a choice at least i would want a choice to talk to my dad or not they don't have a choice any more they get and the worst thing about it be as well they're gonna hear these stories they're gonna grow up with these stories and they're not gonna be able to ask him question not go to be able to ask him why he do it or
S0222	sometimes you don't need to i've hear stories about mine and it's like
S0208	true though yeah
S0222	it's the people that care about you that be still there and i'm not say he didn't care about them but
S0202	no i know but it's gonna fuck them kid up the fact that their dad kill kill himself
S0208	and they'll never get to ask why or like get closure
S0202	exactly they'll never get any closure they'll just get people's judgement and people say well they do it because of this reason or do it because of that reason but the fact of the matter be they can't ask any more because that choice have be take away from them
S0208	yeah have it not be make so public he might not have felt that commit suicide be the only way out but the fact of the matter be the reason that he commit suicide be because he know what the consequences be of his action and he would rather not face them so it's like why why do it in the first place
S0202	mm
S0222	exactly i think
S0202	well these people should get help like when you're go to prison for groom or be a paedophile or any of that you should get psychiatrical help
S0208	do you watch the erm louis theroux programme he do the documentaries on all the kind of stuff like this that like no one actually want to do documentaries on
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm he do one in a paedophile detention centre in america at some and they literally live like fuck kings i mean not literally not even joke they have more privilege than most people in the world like they all have playstations they have a common room they have an inside gym and sport complex they have they get to have party for halloween and christmas with like proper meals and like it be just absolutely ridiculous
S0202	it's disgust
S0208	it's like what be you teach them teach them that by be a paedophile they can come here and live well for the rest of their live
S0222	true
S0208	and be groom to then go back into community because they get let out afterwards
S0202	they should get help they should
S0208	it's shock
S0202	like there be there be a documentary once about erm these paedophiles and basically they have a problem so they get castrate because they be paedophiles and they want to hurt children and they know it be wrong like deep down they know it be wrong they didn't want to feel like that any more so they just castrate them they go and get castrate because they didn't want to hurt kid but in their mind them because they have such a deep psychological problem they couldn't stop themselves from get arouse around kid and stuff
S0208	yeah
S0202	so they just castrate themselves so they never do anything or could act on it
S0208	you know how she's study law
S0202	mm
S0208	be tell me that she be erm read a case and it be part of the evidence be like this group on facebook and it be for people who have er paedophilic thoughts but who didn't want to act on it
S0202	mm
S0208	and it be like a close group of people who could talk about it and like none of them ever act on it but it be like their own like little support sort of group but apparently it get use against all of these people when they obviously know that they have the psychological problem be seek help weren't act on it and they all get prosecute like just for be part of that group i think it's like it's really hard though to judge like what's right and wrong cos people
S0218	they do that online
S0208	yeah
S0218	why the fuck would you do that i understand the help but jesus christ you've gotta be stupid
S0202	yeah
S0208	i i know but
S0202	you could create a face facebook profile wouldn't you and just use that and be a part of that group with that
S0208	or just meet up in person i don't know like
S0202	yeah but it's not something you can talk about you would never go like if someone come up to you if i come up to you and say i'm have thoughts about do this to children like you'd just be like what the fuck like or if you be think the same thing you'd be like yeah me too like let's talk about it
S0202	no but like
S0208	let's go get a coffee yeah
S0202	no but like
S0222	get a coffee
S0202	you can hide behind a computer screen and have a facebook group because you're hide like it's not face to face you know
S0208	yeah no no yeah that's exactly why that's exactly why they be do it but they all get prosecute for it and like i felt kind of bad because like it's it's not their fault that they feel that way and they be try not to act on it and i just felt really bad
S0202	cos it be a psychological problem like very deep deep deep psychological problem and there's not very much you can do about it you've get to go and see a psychiatrist or you get to go and do whatever i'm go for a cigarette
S0222	which be better the five or the five c
S0202	erm
S0218	the five's more powerful apparently
S0202	yeah
S0218	high more high spec five c's just make of plastic
S0202	yeah five c's cheaper
S0208	be it
S0202	yeah it's just plastic it's like it's like the cheaper it be they make it so that people who couldn't afford a normal iphone could get an iphone so it's like their affordable
S0208	i always think that it be like more expensive
S0202	no it's cheaper it's not as good as them ones
S0222	so what's the difference between five and five s
S0202	erm five s the five s have get the erm touch so you put your fingerprint on it
S0222	yeah be that it
S0202	that's it
S0218	pretty much
S0202	that's basically it the camera be still just as shit and stuff like that
S0202	it be the camera's shit
S0208	i i think the cameras be really good
S0202	no they be good but i mean compare to other phone like 's phone his be like a fifteen megapixel ours be still eight
S0222	's be fuck amaze his be basically a camera with an inbuilt phone
S0202	yeah 's yeah
S0208	yeah cos some of them be more like orientate around that aren't they
S0202	like windows' phone cos the
S0208	yeah
S0202	software's shit they have to give you a good camera whereas iphones the software's fantastic so they're not bother about cameras cos people still buy iphones so
S0208	my dad when my contract run out he'll get erm the upgrade he really want to have that one and i be like no i like that phone i want to keep that phone i don't want an iphone six and he be like yeah but i want that one and i'm like well get your own
S0208	i'm just like
S0202	yeah but he could upgrade to an iphone five
S0208	i think if it come to it whatever i probably would just upgrade to like an iphone five s or whatever
S0202	yeah the only difference be the touchpad so that's it
S0208	but yeah exactly so like he then he could take my one cos it actually just work out cheaper for both of us when we do it that way
S0202	i'm just gonna go and get a glass of milk
S0208	alright
S0202	but yeah i i really don't agree with him put stuff on facebook
S0208	no i really don't either
S0202	it's it's wrong because that poor woman if anyone have know that that be her husband or whatever and have beat her up for it or smash her house up for it
S0208	cos it's not their fault
S0202	no
S0208	you can live your entire life with a person and not know them it's dangerous
S0202	yeah like
S0208	like him commit suicide
S0202	it's dangerous for the family
S0208	if
S0202	the thing be he can never be bring to justice now cos he's dead as well
S0208	no but also what really irritate me be like suicide like that be someone's choice
S0202	yeah
S0208	they can do what they want but he probably wouldn't have do that if it wasn't for this guy's influence and yeah be a paedophile's wrong anywhere like always face the consequence like if you're he's obviously aware like he say in the message he know that it be dangerous and that kind of stuff
S0202	yeah he know that what he be do be wrong
S0208	but like it's it's not you know what i actually think i think that they should have the police there when the person come so like do all the dirty work
S0202	just arrest them
S0208	the things that cost money and time and that the police can't do have the police there and they can arrest them there and then
S0202	but the thing be stinson can't do it if he doesn't put it on the internet cos people won't give him money for it
S0208	mm it just
S0202	cos the thing be as well
S0208	i agree with what he's do
S0202	like all of them will be on benefit
S0208	yeah
S0202	every single one of them people who be part of stinson's team will be on benefit
S0208	but like i really do agree with what he's do i mean dedicate his life to fight crime after be like after commit a crime himself
S0202	yeah i agree with it yeah of course
S0208	like that be great redemption but the fact of the matter be
S0202	it's the way he's go about it that's wrong
S0208	yeah and like it's not illegal but it's i don't think right i i do agree like yeah attract them bring them over to arrest them by all mean but
S0202	i agree with what he's do
S0208	like you don't have to put online and ruin not only that person's life but everyone around him
S0202	everyone attach to them
S0208	cos like like like i be say like i would not be able to live with it if ever i find out that my dad be a i literally could not live with that on my conscience
S0202	no you wouldn't want to know would you
S0208	no ignorance be be bliss
S0202	mm
S0208	like as long as he be take to justice or whatever i wouldn't want to have anything to do with it
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i wouldn't want to be affiliate and be know as the paedophile's daughter
S0202	mm cos it's not just the paedophile's life that he's affect it's all of the family what if they've get kid what if they're in secondary school
S0208	those children
S0202	and like everyone see it on facebook oh like your dad's a paedo and their life be now a misery because of what the dad's do
S0208	exactly exactly and the there's always those stupid ignorant people who think that it's like hereditary or whatever
S0202	yeah
S0208	so like oh your dad's a paedophile so you're go to grow up to be one it's like that's not how it work
S0202	yeah it be it be wrong they shouldn't have put it on the internet full stop i really don't agree with that i really don't agree with it at all
S0208	i think it's quite despicable
S0202	it be because yeah what they've do be wrong and yeah they do deserve to be name and sham but when they've be in court when they've be to court they've be prosecute they're go to prison or they're pay a fine or whatever it be that happen
S0208	yeah
S0202	then it's up to the police and the press to to do that
S0208	yeah and like okay the police don't always have the time and the resources to do it but the law enforcement be there for a reason they're the ones that be train and know how to deal with it correctly
S0202	yeah but what i don't understand this stinson hunter guy have be go around for age do this why be he not give the train that he need like why be he not train if they if they why don't they say to him you're gonna do this regardless of whatever so let us give you some train
S0208	yeah
S0202	like and we're go to show you how
S0208	or work for us
S0202	yeah we're go to show you how to do it properly
S0208	yeah that be one thing like people even today like no one be in agreement about how you treat things like that
S0202	no but i internet be wrong i think if you put it on the internet before they've be to court or anything like that be wrong
S0208	mm cos like what if someone see it on the internet and decide to deal with it themselves and go and kill them
S0202	yeah
S0208	they then become a criminal it's not their place to do that i'm sorry like no matter how awful someone be to you two wrong don't make a right like you don't just go and kill someone
S0202	eye for an eye make the whole world blind
S0208	exactly that's a brilliant say i love that
S0202	me too that's why it make me laugh so much when
S0208	may i please have a little sip of your milk
S0202	yeah oh four leaf clover yes
S0208	oh you find one as well this be a lucky house
S0202	well actually it's five leave i don't even know if it's a clover but i'm go to say it's a clover
S0208	i don't think that that's not a clover
S0202	oh no don't say that
S0208	you'll find one i've be look for three years and i find it completely by accident it it will happen
S0208	although it's all shrivel up and go weird
S0202	yeah but you should have put it in between a book
S0208	i do
S0202	it press it it keep it erm the same if you put it like flat the leave flat
S0208	yeah put it inside
S0202	yeah just leave it like that it'll dry out
S0208	it's all shrivel and weird don't wanna touch it cos the leaf will fall off and then no one will believe that it's a four leaf clover
S0202	mm erm but yeah that's why it make me laugh so much when and that accuse me of the ipad i'm just like fuck off as if i'd do something like that i be not you i'm a better person than that
S0208	yeah
