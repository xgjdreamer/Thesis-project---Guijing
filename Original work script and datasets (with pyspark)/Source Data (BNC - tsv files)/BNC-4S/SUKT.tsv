S0120	now i feel guilty for cause two kettle boil
S0058	no it's still
S0026	you don't have to boil it again it's still hot though
S0120	if there's water in it
S0058	yeah there's water
S0120	in which case you boil too much the first time huh
S0120	sorry
S0058	it's a habit from work because
S0120	i be a grateful guest
S0058	if you just if you just boil enough for one another three people will arrive
S0120	mm
S0058	while you're stand wait for it to to go i'm just gonna turn the sausages over they smell do grill oh
S0026	when i when i go to er
S0058	yeah they're do
S0026	i have i have an interview at ttp
S0058	oh right
S0026	um last year and we end up talk about kettles
S0058	okay
S0026	um
S0058	bite random
S0026	and i think it be the reason that they didn't they didn't offer me a job be the way i respond to this conversation about kettles
S0058	oh god
S0120	mm
S0026	um cos they're very into like the engineer not just be engineer but also be very good at business
S0058	okay
S0026	and like sale or that's the impression i get be like actual sell and stuff as well
S0058	yeah
S0026	um and i hadn't realize that um so we we get i can't remember whether they ask me about kettles or whether they say something like can you give me an example of something that you think you could improve on like an day to day object or whatever
S0058	yeah
S0026	i think that's what it be actually cos i i be quite annoy at the time i'd just realize that kettles be all crap you
S0058	right
S0026	you boil water and then it they normally sit there boil it for about five to ten second
S0120	mm
S0058	before yeah
S0026	when they don't need to do that if they just get to boil and then instantly turn off
S0058	yeah
S0026	so you don't need boil water for tea anyway you want it to be slightly off boil
S0058	yeah so
S0026	or whatever so i say i say that i say well this be a day to day object that actually
S0058	mm
S0026	really annoy me and the guy say so what do you think the reason be that um that no kettle will instantly turn off as soon as it boil cos he go
S0058	yeah
S0026	the technology's there surely well i mean he didn't didn't say that and i
S0058	yeah
S0026	i think i say that
S0058	yeah
S0026	i be well like surely it's it's really easy
S0058	huh
S0026	i mean you
S0058	ridiculous
S0026	must be able to fairly easily just like get a decent thermocouple that
S0026	tell it when to turn off and the answer he be look for be that it's just too expensive cos you people want a kettle that's cheap they don't wanna spend money
S0058	yeah
S0026	on
S0058	on a kettle
S0026	a kettle
S0058	yeah
S0026	and i didn't come out with that
S0026	um and cos they want their engineer to be very good at like you know like obvious business decisions
S0058	business yeah
S0026	and stuff
S0058	yeah
S0026	and that's that's so simple like i mean even i would've think of that if i'd really kind of twig but for some reason i didn't come out with it like well i don't really know cos i mean it must be fairly straightforward to make a kettle
S0120	mm mm
S0058	mm
S0026	but one of my colleagues also interview there and get reject and he cos they you can ask for feedback they're actually be quite good ttp be like
S0058	mm right
S0026	give feedback on on interview
S0058	okay
S0026	if you don't get in
S0120	mm
S0026	they say don't be afraid to ring up and ask we're quite happy to
S0058	that's really nice yeah
S0026	i mean i i don't bother kind of just i be just like i be too busy i be do like revision and stuff
S0058	yeah sure
S0120	mm
S0026	um but he my colleague who um also apply say something like oh they they say so weren't strong enough on the the the businessman side of it more you be very good on the engineer
S0058	right
S0026	but not on the sell and er sort of
S0058	oh that's interest
S0026	financial stuff
S0120	hm
S0026	so yeah obviously convince them
S0026	he be er good at that kind of thing
S0058	business acumen
S0026	yeah
S0120	mm mm
S0179	i find them
S0058	you find them
S0120	i will eventually need some business acumen
S0058	find what
S0120	but er
S0026	yeah
S0120	i think at they er
S0026	we have salesmen they have sales sales people with
S0120	develop that while you're there

S0120	yeah
S0058	you say the other name for um sarah millican's other name for top gear snog marry avoid
S0120	i think we've have a discussion about who we'd snog and avoid
S0058	oh yeah we have a quite a
S0179	marry be obviously jam may
S0058	then the other two it's just really not
S0120	i really do want to just slap that man he annoy
S0058	jam may yeah but you wouldn't want to be marry to richard hammond or jeremy clarkson would you
S0026	yeah he's by far the least annoy of all of them
S0058	yeah if you have to live with someone for the rest of your life
S0179	no i think jam may be the most annoy
S0058	you it would have to be jam may
S0179	er yeah cos he's the oldest he's gonna die first
S0058	oh
S0026	jam may
S0179	and
S0058	clarkson's oldest
S0026	clarkson's clearly the oldest

S0179	be he
S0026	yeah the other two be like ten or fifteen years younger than he be i reckon
S0179	well
S0026	he look
S0058	but perhaps it's
S0120	jam may do not give that impression
S0058	he give the impression of be quite old i don't think he be actually that old
S0179	i dunno
S0058	whereas clarkson be just a grumpy old man
S0120	captain slow
S0026	he's probably about forty jam may
S0058	i reckon about that
S0120	forty
S0026	whereas clarkson's probably about fifty five or
S0120	oh
S0058	yeah i be gonna say sort of mid fifties yeah
S0026	yeah
S0120	okay
S0058	hammond's probably early forties
S0026	er
S0120	i'd no idea jam may be
S0058	hm he's probably not that old
S0120	roughly um
S0058	i suppose he could be a lot
S0120	clarkson's age
S0058	it's hard to know he's sort of baby face but but yeah old huh ah
S0120	um but he enjoy things like um i i just particularly remember the when he be um compare the new new jag xk with the older um model of it or something

S0026	you've get the white one and i have not get the white one
S0026	be it still go strong
S0120	oh yes
S0026	the old san francisco from orange
S0120	i'm feel like well i i almost go go ahead and rout it and
S0026	mm
S0120	update it but i yeah it be look quite complicate and i i didn't feel so great about void the warranty this early on i i
S0026	i i i void within a
S0120	i wasn't
S0026	day of buy it
S0120	i wasn't too piss off about how it be work at the at the time so
S0026	yeah
S0120	work alright don't fix it
S0026	it be there's quite an involve process i
S0120	yeah
S0026	i be quite surprise i didn't understand what any of what i be do
S0058	hm
S0120	no
S0026	i just follow a few instructions it take about half an hour
S0120	but it be successful
S0026	yeah i mean it's i haven't it's no longer the lastest version of android but when i do it it be the lastest version of android
S0120	yeah it's just i the one thing i'm really piss off about with this phone be that when it start up when i power it on it turn on all of the it start up all of the applications cos if i switch on the phone and want
S0026	what do you mean all of the applications
S0120	like i turn okay i'll it's off at it's off at the moment
S0026	what ones you you the ones you've instal
S0120	um yeah include some of those um i'll start it up and i'll list what
S0120	crap it's start up
S0026	you mean it it
S0120	it's like switch on a computer
S0058	mm
S0120	and it open every single program
S0026	but but when you say start up do you mean like actually come on the screen as if you as if you just press the the icon
S0120	no but they're run in the background
S0026	yeah but that's how android do stuff
S0120	but it doesn't do stuff because there's so much crap run in the background
S0120	that it doesn't function properly it it's so slow it's not reactive to touch the screen
S0026	well mine's like that as well when you first start it up it's not to do with what's run it's just cos it's it's a slow growth sort of thing it do just take a while to start
S0120	no it's you you
S0026	cos with android you don't need to
S0120	you go onto task manager you start kill process and
S0026	yeah you don't need to do that with android though
S0120	as soon as you're do that
S0026	really
S0120	it speed up massively
S0026	be you
S0120	mm
S0026	well it might just be because one of the ones that's run be
S0026	a silly process that's like very processor intensive cos you know the
S0120	i dunno
S0026	you shouldn't in in you don't need to kill anything on android there's that thing call task killer pro or something
S0120	i haven't get that i've just get something call task manager
S0026	right but you don't need to do task manager like you do with windows cos the memory allocation's so good on android it just use all the memory
S0120	it's so not
S0026	it use all the memory cos that's the best thing to do well may i don't know maybe that's just cos it's an older version or something but
S0120	maybe
S0179	do anyone mind if i have a second bun
S0120	that's this be why i'm consider rout it
S0058	no you've i've get some toast instead so you can have a second bun
S0120	but um yeah so if it react to my
S0058	mm
S0120	oh oh oh
S0120	well right get to the right screen press the button come on
S0058	that's not gonna help it
S0120	right alarm bbc weather backup bluetooth share calendar camera dropbox facebook
S0026	oh that's not right
S0120	gallery
S0026	that be part of the
S0058	mm
S0120	google mail guardian app
S0026	why do they all start up
S0120	map market
S0026	and they're all run from the start
S0120	message well obviously messenger whatever that be something orange
S0026	yeah get rid of that
S0120	my upload my upload whatever that be orange headline fuck off orange headline
S0058	wow
S0120	photo settings skype
S0179	this isn't that interest
S0179	to us to be honest
S0120	something call touchpal voice search and another app call weather which be again an orange thing
S0026	and that's all run
S0120	yeah when you start up the phone that all run it's ridiculous now i've kill it all work brilliantly
S0026	that be kind of weird
S0058	mm
S0120	yeah very stupid
S0026	i think you should route it
S0120	i suspect i should anyway i'm gonna switch it off again now
S0120	and save battery oh it's so stupid urgh
S0058	you know what you need to oh i haven't get them you need one you need just a phone that you can ring people and text people on
S0026	how many sausages be there each
S0120	i dunno
S0179	three
S0058	three um
