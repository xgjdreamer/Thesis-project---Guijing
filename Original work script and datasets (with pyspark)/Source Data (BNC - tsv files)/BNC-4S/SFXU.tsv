S0024	mhm
S0012	i mean my cousin you might not a cousin it's er rosie's brother
S0024	mm
S0012	he run an ice cream firm sell just sell ice cream make a mint but that's all cash
S0024	mhm
S0012	right so he try to fiddle his book say that he didn't earn that much but when when they come to look to see how much he'd buy they know how much profit you've make or roughly how much profit you've get to make cos everybody have to make a profit to be able to survive
S0024	yeah
S0012	so if he'd make say a hundred pound that day he'd put down fifty pound and then they say how come how come you've sell all that ice cream and only make fifty pound
S0024	yeah
S0012	and then he use to take holiday abroad and have a brand new car every year and then they look into that and think how be you afford it when you're not make any money and of course they find out that you be fiddle the book
S0024	yeah they can find out easily i think
S0144	mm
