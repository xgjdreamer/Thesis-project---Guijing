S0294	really
S0012	mm
S0013	yeah

S0013	yes we do have to change it
S0012	so we have we have to change it put it all on the computer and change it
S0294	oh i see yeah
S0012	and then to save it as an mp3 rather than an mp4
S0294	yeah
S0012	but that take quite some time
S0294	mm
S0012	to go all the way through it and then take out bits and piece that we don't want in it
S0294	yeah yeah
S0013	everything's anonymous anyway they they don't
S0294	oh yeah no no i i can see it's a very generalise
S0012	well i mean it's it's the way the british be talk at the moment you know that type of thing
S0294	yeah
S0012	and they analyse it and
S0294	yeah
S0013	quite interest really
S0012	it's very interest you know and erm and who who they get one back but they be do see they actually transcribe
S0013	they actually do the transcribe
S0294	oh i see
S0295	oh i see
S0294	oh interest alright
S0013	and erm you know
S0294	well i in the guardian today it's say that the there's go to be an annual gdp calculation but also a feel good factor so perhaps they'll use something like this to see what people be feel
S0012	probably how they feel yeah
S0294	so i'm feed up
S0012	yeah feed up with the government
S0294	yeah
S0295	it's nice yeah really nice
S0012	oh good so when do you start dribble
S0295	pebbling
S0012	pebbling then
S0295	oh years ago i guess
S0294	yeah long time
S0295	yeah
S0012	oh right cos we have a lot of er that type of tea in of camomile and stuff like
S0294	yeah
S0295	yeah i think you would have
S0013	lemon and ginger as well
S0294	yes i like that yes
S0295	lemon and ginger
S0013	mm
S0012	and er apple cinnamon the one we have before isn't it
S0013	yeah
S0295	we have erm red bush
S0012	now i haven't have red bush i don't know what it taste like
S0294	well red bush be i it's yes it's a bite quite a strong taste but erm erm i be talk to about it and he say well just put a dash of milk in it and so i i do and it make a huge difference
S0012	do it yeah
S0013	oh right
S0294	just just erm take the edge off the bitterness and it's er
S0013	mm
S0295	then we get more muddle up
S0294	well you do yeah
S0295	no i didn't i didn't
S0295	every time i give him a cup of tea and it would come from one of my pot
S0294	we have we have a cupboard full of box with teabags in them and below it we have a shelf full of pot which normally have teabags in but most of them be empty at the moment
S0012	oh we've get that
S0013	yeah and we do that
S0012	we do that type of thing as well
S0012	we've get
S0013	and you think you've get lot of tea and then all of a sudden
S0012	and all of a sudden you've get none and oh
S0294	yeah
S0012	but i have to say that i be a a traditionalist with my tea
S0294	yeah yeah
S0012	i i don't like experiment with tea
S0013	we quite like earl grey don't we
S0012	earl grey yeah that's another one i i can drink
S0013	but we don't
S0294	yeah
S0012	but we're no milk and sugar in earl grey
S0013	by that
S0294	yes
S0012	i just have a drop of milk in in my tea i i don't have
S0294	mm yeah there be an item on the er television er last night wasn't there yeah what's it call the programme after the news on at seven o'clock
S0012	oh er the one show
S0294	the one show that's right
S0012	yeah
S0294	and they they be pick tea in england
S0012	oh that's right yes
S0012	i saw the start of that but i didn't see the end
S0294	yes well it be quite interest and er they've get i mean he's he's obviously try to sell his war but he's he's actually sell his english tea abroad
S0295	to china
S0294	to china and lebanon
S0012	to china it's like take coal to newcastle
S0294	but it's erm it's erm i mean it didn't seem to me that there's any good reason why it shouldn't be possible to do it in the uk because the sort of areas in india where it grow you know be wet and and er cooler weather
S0012	yeah
S0294	because it's up in the hill isn't it
S0012	it be yeah
S0294	my geography's not brilliant but er
S0012	usually on the south face of a hill
S0294	yeah
S0012	be colder hill like our north face
S0294	yes yes
S0012	hill maybe in india it would be cooler
S0294	anyway it be it be interest because erm where he he he make a success he's make a success of it and he have other people who be interest and so it be the possibility of have a special special tea growers i don't think there's anything very magical or very difficult about it
S0012	no i don't well you can grow camellias and
S0294	yeah that's right
S0012	that's a camellia innit
S0294	tea teas
S0012	yeah well it's just quite feasible i suppose
S0294	yeah
S0012	they grow grapes now in kent don't they
S0294	yes yeah
S0012	british wineries
S0013	well yeah
S0294	if you need a hillside it's a bite of a problem in
S0012	well there's plenty well we call erm molehills mountains here
S0294	yes
S0295	we go to that erm winery near the anglo saxon cathedral
S0294	oh yes that's that that be during that be do quite well with
S0012	what's that
S0294	that's right yeah
S0013	yeah yeah

S0012	yeah
S0294	produce your own special
S0295	but they would do i'm sure they be win prize
S0294	yeah
S0012	go to the erm distillery
S0295	oh yeah
S0295	the whisky one yes we've pass it but erm
S0012	and er he he bring a bottle up
S0013	enjoy that didn't he
S0012	he bring a bottle up have about that much oh that be good stuff
S0294	be it yeah
S0013	very expensive though
S0012	yeah
S0294	oh i can imagine
S0012	thirty five pound a bottle
S0294	oh right yes
S0012	that's why i only get thimbleful
S0013	yeah
S0295	well you can't afford to to taste for that can you
S0012	no but they be give tasters out there you see
S0294	yeah yeah
S0012	and er i suppose i get a thimbleful and he buy a bottle er

S0294	right
S0295	oh i see yeah
S0013	it's her son isn't it
S0012	that's her son yeah
S0013	mm
S0294	yeah oh right
S0012	they get this big discount which be quite a lot
S0294	yes yes
S0013	mm
S0294	well he must be feel erm if it's possible to feel this way quite good about what's be go on with ofsted
S0012	yes yes
S0012	oh well yes
S0013	yes it's quite isn't it
S0013	yes he's quite
S0294	it's
S0012	it's quite naughty isn't it
S0294	well there's the the guardian again erm have there's a double page spread but they just they be just ask for you know people to comment on their experience of ofsted
S0012	mm
S0294	and what they think be it be achieve or its strengths its weaknesses and so on
S0012	that be all on the television this morning
S0294	be it again yes cos it's gonna have an independent erm enquiry
S0012	enquiry now yeah yeah
S0294	but erm
S0013	they're not let it go then
S0294	no they can't i just i just don't understand how it be that people can accept any outcome from an ofsted inspection
S0012	no no
S0294	and there be a there be one comment from one headteacher who have be erm have a visit from ofsted go through the procedures and then erm he get a grade which require which require improvement so he challenge it and it be change
S0012	oh right
S0294	now the and there be the the schoolteacher have be say that when the ofsted inspector come into your class you must show your ability to teach in about four or five different ways in order to show that you've get a breadth of presentation and you know
S0012	yeah
S0294	and she say that's a totally artificial situation and they can't judge and they they not only judge her teach but they judge the school on what they've see her do
S0012	that's right
S0294	and they're in for about three days two days four days if you're lucky
S0012	yes that's right
S0294	and there's only a few of them three or four people
S0012	yeah
S0294	and erm i the whole thing be be really really flaw
S0012	i think it's just job for the boys to be quite honest with you
S0294	well i think there's a genuine attempt to bring standards up i mean there there be reasonable concern i think about some of the things that be go on in education but it's it's the the fundamental principle seem to me you go in and find fault
S0012	yeah
S0294	and you tell them what you're not do right
S0012	yeah
S0294	you don't go along there say wouldn't it be better if you try this or have see such and such and that's help a lot in certain as as the old system do you know the old hmi system do and er you know be positive
S0012	yes
S0294	offer offer solutions not just
S0012	yeah
S0294	offer an analysis of the problems
S0012	yeah this be your problem
S0294	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and you're gonna get this now because
S0294	what it's do be turn out people like better not say it on the machine
S0294	like like the lady concern who you know obviously manipulate the know know exactly what ofsted want and make sure that's it's provide exactly the way it should be provide
S0013	ah
S0012	she's get no conscience at all
S0294	well that wouldn't surprise me
S0012	i don't think she
S0294	no
S0012	no
S0294	now go onto twenty three thousand people just like her
S0012	wow there's education down the drain
S0294	she want head the twenty three thousand head apparently when he say i'd i'd like to clone her and have twenty three thousand head as good as she be that sort of thing
S0012	what oh dear oh dear oh dear he must have be as mad as a hatter
S0294	i think he see that's the other thing because it's all government
S0012	yes it's all government yeah
S0294	it should be it should be independent
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah she be on television last night when i be do you see her on television
S0013	no
S0294	well i saw her i do see her on once and
S0012	she be on last night
S0294	be she
S0013	oh be she
S0012	yes
S0295	mm
S0012	because there's suppose be an independent inquiry into the
S0294	yes yeah
S0012	and er she just walk down this corridor with a book in her hand and just place it in its proper
S0295	oh that's oh that's the thing yeah
S0013	bite of film then innit
S0012	same a bite of film yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah that's that's quite amaze absolutely amaze
S0013	mm
S0295	we can always talk to about it
S0294	oh yes because at the school that she be at in be a be a school which i think become part of their big academy
S0012	oh yes that big academy yeah yeah it's quite a big one now isn't it
S0013	yeah
S0294	the the labour party be just as bad as the tories actually academies
S0012	i don't know what who i'm gonna vote for this time to be honest with you
S0294	well
S0295	don't want to see
S0294	i mean we both know well what we what we the vote doesn't do any good at all
S0012	no
S0294	it might make the candidate feel better because they've get
S0012	well yes that's right
S0294	but we're not gonna win
S0012	no no
S0294	but i think i the more i think about it there be certain issue in the country which should not be party political at all they should be completely neutral with everybody contribute
S0012	yes
S0294	so the national health service obviously be one
S0294	yes
S0294	and education be another
S0012	yeah
S0294	because you know this be a fundamental and you you're
S0295	crime and punishment
S0012	and crime
S0294	yes crime and punishment yes that's right because you always get erm you know you're you're gonna change a government they've get five years a new and they change try to change you can't do it
S0012	yeah and they're push yes
S0294	the the inertia of the system won't allow anything to happen for the first three or four years anyway
S0012	they're like
S0013	yeah
S0012	push a ball up the up a hill all the time and you know they're well i don't think they've get any sense or any foresight at all
S0294	no
S0012	they just seem to be there for what they
S0294	well it's all this you know the the personal side's go out of everything hasn't it really
S0012	yes it have
S0294	everything's corporate and er
S0012	yeah
S0294	but erm it appear i mean i'm wait for i'm wait for miliband actually to do something i'm sure he's go to but pretty
S0012	i like do do you ever watch that have i get the news for you programme on
S0294	yes yeah
S0012	i think that's really brilliant the way
S0294	yeah yes it vary a bite but it's very good
S0012	yes i mean erm hislop be it
S0294	yes
S0012	oh he run private eye doesn't he
S0294	that's right yes yes
S0012	hislop and he's now talk like cos they've change the rule about er newspapers and everything report on things haven't they they've er and he say that he's gonna get sue every time he write now
S0294	oh right yeah
S0012	because because of some kind of erm news
S0294	yes unintended consequence maybe
S0013	they just put allegedly in everything doesn't it
S0012	yeah
S0294	yeah yeah
S0012	yeah you've gotta put allegedly before everything now
S0294	yeah
S0012	but i remember ted heath when when he be in government er at one time i think of course we be everybody be protest at the time and march
S0294	mm
S0012	he make it against the law to have more than eleven people congregate
S0294	yeah that's right yeah
S0012	be that still against the law
S0294	i don't know i think you can't but you can declare a state of emergency and all sort of other rule come in to play
S0012	yeah
S0294	and erm he he be he be the one who turn all the light out
S0012	that's right yeah
S0294	and er cos in fact i i be up for interview for the job at
S0012	yeah
S0294	when that be go on walk through the darken streets of at night
S0012	not very nice
S0294	but er yes and look that it's well when you start look at what be happen at that time you know it be a it be a it be gesture politics
S0012	yes it be weren't it yes yeah
S0294	the unions do need put you know rein in a bite but er not not the way it be do
S0012	well we didn't mind the the light go out at night cos we'd get to bed early
S0295	well we get stop by the police didn't we on our way through derbyshire
S0012	do you
S0295	and that be
S0294	oh gosh that be very frighten yes go through we use to go through

S0294	across the
S0013	sorry you just get stop
S0295	yes
S0294	yes
S0295	we be all go how long we be gonna be there
S0294	yes yes where be we go you know because it be the miners' strike you see and they have minibuses pack full of er policemen yes
S0012	oh they do didn't they yeah
S0013	oh
S0294	and er it be very very erm they be very tense and it be a very uncomfortable
S0012	well it be a police state at the time weren't it really you know
S0294	well it it i wouldn't like to take on the miners actually
S0012	well no but
S0294	but but the right and wrong of it be i mean be just bury and it just become a sort of
S0012	well it become a great big
S0294	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and we go erm i think it be maggie thatcher that
S0294	oh it be it be all her yeah
S0012	yeah she just she just just shut industry down didn't she
S0012	yeah she do didn't she and er i remember police up there try to fight against the the riot of course they be very
S0294	yeah

S0295	horse
S0294	horse
S0012	horses' hooves
S0294	oh yeah yeah well
S0012	that wasn't very nice be it
S0294	yeah well well you see that be the other thing i mean i don't know where these policeman come from but they they probably weren't local police
S0012	no
S0294	they've probably be draft in from all around the country
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0294	in order to
S0012	they be probably metropolitan
S0294	well could be yeah
S0012	literally nasty bits of work really
S0294	yeah mm
S0012	i watch a programme this morning er about the brain
S0294	oh yeah
S0012	of a man and a the brain of a woman
S0295	oh yeah
S0012	oh that be brilliant
S0012	that be
S0013	i i only catch little bits of it
S0294	now remember every word be be record
S0012	yes but that be brilliant because
S0013	put it in the middle here
S0012	that's okay it depend on how a person's bring up not only their brain but on how they be bring up
S0294	right
S0012	the brain apparently be identical only a little bite smaller in a woman which be natural i suppose
S0294	oh
S0012	no that's physical
S0294	that's physical science yeah
S0012	yes that's physical
S0295	be smaller than that
S0012	and the man's brain be just a bite bigger because he's bigger you know that's all but there's no difference
S0295	mm
S0294	mm
S0012	there's literally no difference and the only difference be er the brain erm be cut into two hemispheres
S0013	mm
S0012	right
S0294	mm
S0012	and you have the leave one and the right one and the difference between man and a woman be the woman use the right one and the leave one where the man only use the leave one
S0294	yeah yeah
S0012	and this be why woman can multitask and and hold er emotional and get even more emotional than a man
S0294	mm well that's not true any longer be it
S0012	no
S0294	men be men be cry on television every night aren't they

S0012	and then we we say well you're female and you're male we'll bring you up this way and we'll bring you up that way
S0294	mm
S0295	mm
S0012	and and that's how it's do and that's and that's the that's the only difference
S0294	yeah
S0295	mm
S0012	other than gender of course
S0013	yeah they do tend to give them that type of toy don't you
S0012	you do
S0294	yes yeah
S0013	but er
S0294	but it's that be change isn't it because erm it's it's interest where you get female car mechanics and painters and decorators and
S0012	that's right you do
S0294	bricklayers you know they're slow be
S0012	yeah
S0294	it's all get mix
S0012	that be get mix yeah
S0294	up and er the more that happen the less likely the dumper truck will
S0012	that's right
S0294	go in one direction
S0012	but er you know it's just how we we have be bring up
S0294	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0012	so we bring up and so on and so forth and that hasn't change
S0294	yeah
S0012	at all in fact that be even worse in victorian time
S0294	yeah
S0013	a lot
S0012	it's a lot better now but that be worse in victorian time whereas you know we be equal while er lot of people don't think we be
S0013	and lot of boys that we look after they er they love dolls
S0012	they do
S0294	yes
S0013	yeah wheel the prams around
S0294	yes of course you have all this yes yes of course
S0013	yes i mean it's just equal equal really isn't it
S0294	yes yeah
S0013	basically isn't it
S0295	the desire to have something that somebody else have get
S0012	yes that's right yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	but it's it's really weird because you get you get the in a crèche for instance where where they're be look after you've get the the little baby all the boys or you know like eighteen a year to eighteen month old
S0295	mm
S0012	even the women be give them toy

S0012	oh yeah
S0294	and they erm
S0012	we use to tunnel into them
S0294	that's right well and and you'd get the the the you get to the very top and then you slide off
S0012	that's right
S0294	and then you'd have about a ten foot drop you know
S0012	yeah
S0294	you use to you think think anything of it you know

S0012	no
S0294	but er
S0012	well we use to have a farmer call erm i think er i think his name be i think
S0295	oh yes yeah
S0012	and there be a farm er
S0012	up the back of ours of the down what we call and then you'd go over the red bridge which be an old roman bridge a very old bridge i think it's protect now but it weren't then when we be kid and that's where we use to catch crayfish you know lean over the top with a worm and catch the crayfish and er we use to play over there and oh the things we use to do i can't believe it i mean over the railway line and over the marshes and if i come home with a wet foot i be in trouble i be in trouble you'd walk over there and slunch down into the mud
S0294	mm
S0012	and then you'd pull your i you'd get your boot out and your empty all the stink mud and try and dry off yeah
S0294	mm mm
S0012	that be great fun though
S0294	yeah yes well
S0012	great fun
S0294	yes distance land enchantment
S0013	yeah
S0012	but we do have a tom girl tomboy come with us all the time she be she be always with us she
S0294	yeah yeah that's that's true we we have she be quite a tomboy she use to come
S0012	yeah
S0294	and yeah we and we have erm some erm oh what be they call they send them up from not refugees erm
S0012	oh the the evacuees
S0294	evacuees that's right

S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah so you have them live with you do you
S0294	yes we do
S0013	ah
S0294	my father be away and erm no we fill the house we have oh i say i say fill the house
S0013	yeah
S0294	the the s they be call and they come from kent and er we keep in touch with them for quite some time they weren't there for very long because of course er once the well the the bomb pattern settle down and there be some part of the south of england that didn't get it as much as others
S0012	yeah
S0294	and they'd come from kent so i imagine kent be relative well perhaps less dangerous than itself
S0012	well my my grandma get bomb out of her house up church street in in the blitz
S0294	yes yes
S0012	what they call the blitz
S0295	mm
S0294	yes

S0294	yes
S0012	they be make all the women be work at make er ammunition
S0294	yes that's right
S0012	so they try to bomb bomb 's i think they miss and just hit norwich
S0294	yeah
S0012	but they miss the cathedral and they miss a lot of the church
S0294	yeah well they get er it be erm one of the first place in the country to get zeppelin wasn't it
S0012	yes yes
S0294	and there's there's an article in the local paper about it the other day wasn't there
S0012	yeah
S0294	show the zeppelin damage do
S0012	they use to just drop the bomb
S0294	well what be weird be why anybody think it be a problem the zeppelins be a problem they fill them with helium you know it's
S0012	yeah
S0294	it's bang dead easy it seem to me
S0012	yeah
S0294	travel very very slowly and they're very very big how can you miss
S0012	you can't miss can you i mean you get them with a catapult don't you
S0294	yes but erm i mean it be probably more complicate than that i don't know perhaps they have perhaps they be very very perhaps they fly at very high altitude i don't know
S0012	i just think if if you do hit one that will go
S0294	take
S0294	yeah
S0012	i don't think i i didn't er see any zeppelins i be i be in the war i be bear in the war but er
S0294	well they i didn't see any zeppelins no
S0295	well i think we saw i don't remember we i remember go up to the civic centre and in the waste grind next to it there be this but i even know what it be
S0294	i think they're mainly propeller aircraft about

S0012	yes
S0294	which you use to scratch
S0012	scratch it off and then
S0294	because they they only have you know erm about two or three bedroom three bedroom house whatever it be
S0012	that's right yeah
S0294	and you'd have one warm room
S0012	that's right
S0013	oh
S0012	and that would be the sit room
S0294	that's right yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah well that be us at twenty four and we live in the kitchen
S0294	yeah
S0012	yeah we have to live in the kitchen yeah with of course you know
S0013	sit in the kitchen and everything
S0012	when the council house up there they be just like we we could only afford one warm room
S0013	because it be so cold
S0294	yeah
S0012	and they have them air bricks where you
S0294	yes
S0012	you know they'd be up up in your bedroom as well
S0294	yes
S0295	yeah
S0012	and they'd be freeze cold and we have a bell hang on the on this fireplace and the draft would ring the bell
S0012	that down how bad it be don't it
S0294	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	god that be bad
S0013	actually we try to light a fire there as well

S0012	yeah we
S0294	mm
S0013	just a little
S0012	mum use to sit in front of the fire
S0013	they're lovely
S0012	like this area in front of the fire and scald all your legs
S0294	yes
S0295	yes yeah
S0012	all the legs get scald
S0013	mm
S0294	yes
S0295	how's your time
S0294	sorry
S0295	how's your time because you're
S0294	no no it's fine i er be one o'clock be when i be suppose to i just a bite of we have a have a telephone call from er somebody from english heritage
S0012	oh yeah
S0294	erm she'd get my number from the website as a book officer for the hall and she's do a project look at rural school old well
S0013	oh
S0294	present and old rural school and of course the village hall be the school
S0012	the old school yeah
S0294	the old school so she want to meet she want to get into the hall and i say it would probably better if i meet you
S0013	mm
S0294	and then i can show you around and you know if you have question so erm i mean i don't know i just think it's it's worth i don't suppose she'll be able to help at all but it's worth have a contact with the english heritage
S0012	well of course it be yeah
S0013	yeah
S0294	it's just it's just
S0012	they may be able to help us out with the hall
S0294	that's right yes exactly
S0013	yeah
S0294	so i just need to do a little bite of homework just to check on when the when it be build what sort of what i be read erm a place of no consequence er you know yeah book
S0012	oh yes yeah and then to
S0294	very very badly write
S0012	yeah
S0295	er erm
S0012	yeah what happen to them they move out
S0294	they move
S0295	somewhere by the and the sea i understand but nobody seem to know where
S0294	mm
S0012	oh i hear it be erm er that near cromer somewhere near cromer
S0295	oh right
S0294	well maybe they they just cut themselves off we don't know
S0013	yeah it's a shame when they love it so much
S0294	yes that's right yes
S0013	obviously
S0294	but they they've erm because there's a i i i will tell i will give her the information which be in the book but the information in the book be different from the information that have get when she be do a history thing
S0012	yeah
S0294	eighteen forty seven and the story be that that the money be raise from local landowners and accord to the book erm most of them on their promise and it be the family that er most of it
S0012	oh right
S0294	erm but it's interest because erm this be go back to well go back to that time you see
S0012	yeah
S0294	nobody saw the need to learn to read and write
S0012	no they didn't no
S0013	mm
S0294	nobody do because they just work
S0012	well they work on the farm
S0294	on the farm
S0012	and that be it weren't it
S0294	and er it be it be always important to have at least one person who could read and write someone to keep the book and that kind of thing but as far as the general population be concern it be a totally unnecessary er process
S0012	it be weren't it yeah
S0294	and the other intrigue thing which i come across where i because i haven't read this bite for a long while be that erm it be always a small school because of course itself be be be very small
S0012	yeah
S0294	and er they didn't have a problem exactly but the younger children from be be send to in preference to the school
S0012	oh right
S0294	where i imagine this it be perhaps a more i don't know informal comfortable situation than have a a very big school
S0295	well there be there be three weren't there there be the one and there's the one and there be the one that by
S0294	oh right yes the erm yes what school it be call what's what's the name of the little there's a one of the lanes
S0295	fire
S0294	erm
S0294	there be a school there
S0012	that be a school be it
S0294	which remember as exist yes talk to him
S0012	oh right
S0294	he's come along to meet her actually cos he'll he'll fill in any gap
S0012	he will he's brilliant he
S0013	mm
S0294	but erm so it it i it's intrigue really as to why the education system eighteen seventy there be the education act
S0012	yes
S0294	and they have to do it then but er
S0012	do they have to pay for it pay
S0294	sorry
S0012	didn't they have to pay
S0294	oh yes it wasn't it be yes they still have to find money for it
S0012	yeah
S0294	but it be do it be it be this be really do by the church of england because the church of england want to take some sort have some sort of control i think of the population
S0012	yeah
S0013	so how many could they take how many pupils could they take there
S0294	there be oh in in the twenties or thirties or something like that
S0013	yeah
S0294	it be it be erm you know it would have fill the build
S0013	quite a lot yeah
S0294	the main hall there
S0013	mm
S0294	and the other thing which i think be wrong in the book there's a photograph which they claim be of the old school and i don't think it be
S0012	isn't it
S0294	because the they there's a the most significant part of the build be the bite which be on the front well that isn't the case and that porch which we use now be quite old and it's certainly
S0012	that be yes
S0294	the same sort of age as the rest of the build they're not aware that i think
S0012	the only thing new on that porch be the clock isn't it
S0294	yes that's right
S0012	yeah
S0294	but erm anyway well it's i'm not i'm not go to i'm just go to let her have the information that's in the book
S0012	yes
S0294	if she want to have the information time outdo or anything like that
S0013	mm
S0012	do you read it all do you the book
S0294	oh crikey no
S0294	i i mean i dip into it
S0295	very dense
S0294	it's it's it's a very difficult style it's a very academic style
S0013	oh
S0294	and totally unforgiving you know
S0012	yeah
S0294	there's no humour there there's no lightness there at all
S0012	oh i see
S0013	oh
S0294	and er she i mean do get a mention but it's the briefest of mention
S0295	well we didn't give her anything
S0294	well we have nothing to give her
S0295	no well that's it
S0012	what about the old
S0295	nothing
S0294	erm they they she do quite a lot on 's place
S0012	yes
S0294	the
S0012	yeah
S0294	and then there's the then the erm there be the forge be part way down
S0012	that's right all the way down
S0295	yes
S0013	mm
S0294	and erm there's the plum tree there's plum tree the old forge and then 's place
S0012	oh i see right
S0013	right
S0295	and er cos all the others all the others be so
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah cor
S0013	mm
S0294	but it be a it's an interest area in one sense because there be no in most areas you have the gentry
S0012	yes
S0294	the land of gentry but there's no significant family at all in this area
S0294	sorry
S0294	be yes they come years to it
S0013	yours must have be the most important house in mustn't it
S0295	well it's not at all that old it be
S0294	eighteen sixties eighteen eighteen fifty seven
S0295	it replace something you have to pay do you have to pay or do you know you have to pay extra tax didn't you
S0294	the the record they've look up what they can about and er they have to pay when it be build they have to pay a tax
S0012	oh right
S0013	oh
S0294	and er i mean she talk about well it it be even in our day it be it be two or three cottages
S0012	yeah
S0294	and because it be for the workers plural
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0294	in in the brick field in the brick yard erm
S0012	they find the old brick kiln didn't they apparently
S0295	yeah yeah
S0294	yes
S0012	didn't pull it down do he
S0294	erm
S0294	i think
S0294	i don't think it be well i would be surprise if it be any great significance
S0013	mm
S0012	oh too interest all this history
S0013	yeah it be interest isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0294	yes
S0013	and they grow up
S0295	we be tell that our house be call wasn't it
S0294	yes
S0295	but because there's a farm
S0013	
S0295	farm in the village
S0294	yeah
S0295	yeah
S0012	oh right
S0013	oh right
S0295	they they they be ask to drop the
S0013	mm
S0295	that's how it become
S0012	oh i see
S0295	so it give the impression that it's older than it be
S0013	yeah
S0295	i don't know whether that's true or just a
S0294	the the other thing which be intrigue and i again i don't i don't think the evidence that and er produce be be good enough they talk about there be obviously the post office be at the bottom of
S0012	yeah
S0294	and then there be another shop erm there's the and she say that there be a shop it at
S0012	oh
S0294	so it be the
S0295	well she sell honey didn't she so yes it would be
S0294	well i mean we're talk about when it be build
S0295	oh i see
S0294	when it be build and i can't see there's enough room but the the office be be er where the din room table be
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0294	erm and you can see the mark on the floor and everything to show where er desk be
S0012	there's a picture of they'd have a little more history about it weren't it
S0294	yes and of course when we move in we have a doorway from the from the dryer into that area erm block off so there would have be an office there but i don't perhaps they do sell things maybe i don't know but that's not likely i don't think
S0012	i don't think so i mean
S0295	well they have goats might sell goats' milk
S0294	well i think no the well the goats i think come later i mean that i don't know whether they be go on at the same time as the brick kiln
S0295	don't know they they sell erm well so they say they sell er milk to the hospitals
S0012	oh
S0294	oh it be a substantial yes there be a substantial erm er agricultural dwell but go back to the eighteen fifties because the house be build during the time of the brickworks be operate out of the money he make on the bricks on the brick from brickyard erm so i don't i don't know what time you're talk about but i would i would guess
S0295	oh i don't know what
S0294	i would guess that the goat farm be much more likely to be nineteen twenties thirties
S0012	strange that we keep goats as well innit
S0295	yes yeah
S0294	yeah
S0012	that's really weird innit
S0295	erm she be erm oh what be her name
S0294	i don't know who you're try to describe
S0295	the people who live in the house before us the old lady
S0295	the s
S0012	yeah
S0295	it be the s who tell me that and the and the shed you know the stable be
S0294	yes
S0012	cos this this land use to belong to that
S0294	yes that's right yeah
S0295	that's right
S0294	yeah
S0295	so but i don't know how much land they have altogether
S0012	no
S0013	yeah well we have get it in haven't we so the original
S0012	the original
S0013	parcel
S0012	yeah the original parcel yeah
S0294	yeah so the original parcel go up to the boundary between you and 's yeah
S0013	quite quite big
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0294	erm but then of course we would take in with the whole of the curtilage of 's temple
S0012	yeah
S0294	and the brickyard itself
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah mm
S0294	but when we come of course the the erm the land what start use the land which didn't belong to him
S0012	that's right
S0294	below his house
S0294	be that
S0012	oh it's probably some pi thing we never get phone call
S0013	i'll just check might be

S0295	oh okay
S0012	that'll just be some stupid
S0013	no number
S0012	no it's stupid this be the this be the indoor phone the home phone
S0013	yeah
S0294	landline be quite price be go up

S0012	yeah we have bt yeah
S0013	yeah
S0294	yeah well i i i haven't check to see what the affect it have on ours it have go up slightly but erm the erm they be comment in erm the article i be read in the paper that it's cheaper now often more cheaply cheap it's cheaper to use a mobile than it be a landline
S0012	be it
S0295	well you well you pay so much don't you for the phone
S0012	that's right yeah
S0295	erm
S0294	the rental
S0012	line to get to get er broadband
S0294	yes you can't you can't be without it well you can i suppose if you don't have wi fi or something i don't know
S0012	yeah well there's a satellite that you can clock into apparently ain't there
S0294	yes i mm i mean i find it i get very frustrate because i have my ipad and i there be certain room of the house i can't i can't use it in
S0012	no that's right
S0294	erm and i keep see these advertisements for for boost but erm
S0012	you put a plug in in the wall
S0294	about put a plug in yeah i'm just not sure about it
S0012	well bt make them bt sell them
S0294	yeah they do but they're forty to fifty pound
S0012	be they oh
S0294	and erm i do get one from them and it didn't work so i send it back and get my money back but that be because it be in the earlier days and erm you have to have a a wire connection
S0012	yeah
S0294	to the point where you be get the booster
S0012	i see
S0294	so that be
S0012	apparently though if you've get any metal in your wall anything
S0294	we have yeah
S0012	that won't work in that room
S0294	well we've get reinforce beam
S0295	we've get the yeah

S0294	cos they our our downstairs mainly downstairs in two separate room
S0012	yeah
S0294	and there's a an rsj across the middle
S0012	yeah apparently they don't work if there's
S0294	them at the the energy that's right yeah
S0012	yeah
S0295	ah well that's not much good be it
S0294	well it no it it you can
S0012	you could have a wire all the way through wire
S0294	no they don't have a wire i i i mean if i plug one of these things in it will go it it will almost certainly get in to the whole of the downstairs
S0012	yeah
S0294	cos we do the crossword you see and i have the ipad there and then i get a very weak message if i'm sit settee near the front door
S0294	and er then it will take me halfway through get an anagram and it lose its signal
S0013	oh it's awful

S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0294	at the the think
S0012	of course it's very sidewise think isn't it lateral type think
S0294	oh yes i mean there's the one with the number where the it be the seven time table
S0012	that's it
S0294	and they reverse the number
S0013	yes that's right
S0012	they reverse the number how brilliant

S0295	no
S0012	now have you ever do that puzzle where you've get to tell the colour say it's green blue red orange purple pink or whatever but on the top if it's yellow it say red and it's it's
S0013	you mean the write didn't you

S0013	it's it's write
S0012	it's write
S0013	in a in a different colour to it's yellow
S0012	but you've get to say the colour
S0013	but it's write in red
S0012	oh that's difficult
S0294	mm

S0294	yeah
S0012	and you have to say the colour i mean they they get really difficult

S0012	because you have to read the word
S0294	yeah
S0012	and tell you what the colour be at the same time and oh
S0294	yes
S0012	it it confuse you
S0013	mm

S0012	yeah
S0294	but they have some very obscure ones don't they gosh
S0012	they do but don't it make it good feel good when when you get the answer and they don't
S0294	yeah yeah
S0012	and you think why didn't they see that i could see i know that
S0294	mm well probably i mean probably a historian background and other sort of so
S0295	i need a long time to get them
