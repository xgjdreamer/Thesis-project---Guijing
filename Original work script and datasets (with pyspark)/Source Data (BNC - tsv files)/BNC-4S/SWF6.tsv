S0326	why it's become why it's become like couchsurfing
S0331	no no it's not for that it's for verification of your account cos she hasn't use it yet
S0330	that be so bizarre isn't it
S0328	yeah
S0331	and er she hasn't she doesn't use facebook enough not enough activity on facebook to verify who she be
S0328	mm interest i close my facebook account
S0331	oh have you use airbnb before though
S0328	i've get an app though yeah
S0326	yeah
S0331	oh then that's fine if you've use it have never use it
S0328	to get the app and then so 's reserve a place but you haven't book it
S0331	yeah and he keep do this thing where you accept the wrong days he say i can't change the days i say leave it for one day twenty four hours it'll expire i'll do it with the right days and just before it do it he reaffirm it and it's it's be this ongoing thing he doesn't quite understand
S0328	so
S0331	but he's like don't worry there's gonna be someone to meet you he say this be my number and it block number er you can't send a mobile number in a message
S0331	cos it just give you the letter scramble it cos otherwise you can bypass airbnb
S0328	so now what should i do
S0328	i'm lose
S0331	it's it's just so annoy but anyway we will get the book
S0326	why don't you just write like zero zero seven
S0331	what scramble it yourself put put it amongst
S0326	yeah
S0331	amongst a message
S0326	er you could just even write zero seven
S0331	but i can't communicate that to i mean it's really hard to talk to him
