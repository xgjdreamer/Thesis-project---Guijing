S0653	i don't know if you guy know but there be a lottery erm prize a couple of weeks ago like the biggest one in the uk wasn't it
S0652	mm
S0653	even though it be split so it have roll over the money have roll over for a number of weeks and then they it have to go so two people win
S0653	there be two ticket that be win and they get thirty three million pound each now the first couple they come forward and they go public so people have their you know take their photograph and everything but nobody come forward for age for the other one and load of people claim that they have the win ticket it's just
S0652	yep
S0653	it's just remind me of charlie and the chocolate factory
S0652	mm
S0653	where people be claim fake so they be say oh i have the ticket but i put it in the wash machine and it's all a bite break
S0652	and the and the date's rub off

S0654	but wait
S0654	how would they know it be the win ticket
S0653	yeah but the thing be they be completely lie
S0652	mm
S0653	because they have now find the person whose ticket it be and it wasn't one that be in a wash machine it be just a normal ticket and er quite sensibly they've decide to remain anonymous do you know what anonymous mean
S0654	yeah they don't they don't tell fib they just go silent
S0653	yeah it just mean they they they keep they don't say who they be so rather than be in a a newspaper say mrs mrs jones have win thirty three million no nobody else know unless they mention it so that mean that all those people that say that where it that they have it be lie
S0652	mm
S0653	but why would you do that just to see if you can i mean of course they're go to be rigorous in check your ticket aren't they well what would've happen if they couldn't hadn't find it it would've just go back in wouldn't it
S0652	yeah
S0653	i think they should er
S0655	
S0653	i think no hang on i think they should donate it to charity
S0652	they know that the ticket be because they will do receipt
S0654	please may i get down
S0652	in certain place find out that it be in
S0654	but i'm finish i'm finish mum

S0652	yeah
S0654	i'm finish
S0653	stay there
S0654	but i'm finish
S0653	but what if nobody ever claim it though
S0652	it would just go back into the pot
S0653	mm alright you can get down
