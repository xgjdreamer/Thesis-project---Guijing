S0227	oh what a persian
S0192	do you remember tandy
S0189	i don't know whether it's a persian possibly
S0227	oh i mean i remember tandy i don't know if do
S0192	oh yeah like you say
S0189	yeah i do vaguely
S0192	look just like
S0227	i
S0192	with a bite of brown on him though
S0227	i run poor old tandy over just before we be go on holiday
S0192	yeah
S0192	that be terrible
S0227	i know it cost quite a lot
S0192	it cost quite a bite and then he turn out he have lung cancer didn't he or something
S0227	no er erm neurological erm er neurological disorder so he be put down about six months later old tandy
S0192	be that just to save money at that point
S0227	no
S0192	cos obviously you'd spend a bomb on him
S0227	i'd spend a lot of money
S0192	but be he reparable at that point reparable
S0227	no i think they just the vet decide the vet cos he be fit
S0192	oh
S0227	seizures the vet think it be the best course of action be to plus er they do get to be very expensive i mean simba erm be be diabetic type 1
S0227	and er to keep him alive would've mean erm an injection every day plus a visit to the vet every three weeks and that would've cost an absolute fortune and would've tie you to the house because you it's one thing for you to do a favour for a friend or even a relative to say can you fee my cat pop round but can you fee my cat and give it an injection and
S0192	and take it to the vet
S0227	and if you give it an overdose this be what you need to do to to counteract the overdose so er erm have to inject a cat that's not will to be inject be it's not an easy thing
S0192	mm
S0227	so it be too much it be gonna cost about two hundred pound a month to keep him alive it be too much money
S0189	yeah
S0192	it's not worth it
S0227	well if you have a stupid amount of money and you have someone who could keep attend then you'd pay it but if you yeah because of the er the er affiliation but erm we didn't have the time you know to be constantly and you also he have he be hypoallergenic so he have to have a special diet he be eat human food really so it be a bite
S0227	you know i mean
S0192	i remember you serve up him up rice and fish or something
S0227	he he wasn't you know he er he er he
S0227	he wasn't young so erm if he be young you may've grin and bear it a bite more
S0192	how often do you see
S0189	erm maybe an average of like once a month
S0192	not too often
S0227	that's quite often he come up and see you then
S0189	yeah he be here today
S0227	be he still on a bike or car
S0189	a car
S0192	we go out to nando's didn't we but there be a bite of a problem

S0189	yeah i suppose
S0227	it's good for job cos a lot of the jobs'll say can you drive

S0227	yeah i give him five hundred quid towards the thing and then he stop
S0192	do he get that five hundred quid
S0227	i don't know i guess he do
S0192	where's my five hundred quid just be hand around
S0189	what five hundred quid
S0227	for when you be when you be twenty one i pay five hundred towards your drive er lessons
S0189	do you
S0227	yeah remember
S0189	oh right
S0227	your mum i think may have pay something i know i write you a cheque
S0192	what happen to that then
S0227	well he didn't pass
S0189	i don't remember that cheque
S0227	no but you remember the lessons it be with click i think clickdrive or something i do take some kind of interest since i'd invest in it it be either two fifty or five hundred i think it might have be two fifty i pay with the promise of another two fifty if you carry on you didn't carry on so i didn't carry didn't carry on or i pay five hundred with the er an offer of another five hundred i can't remember how much drive er er lessons cost nowadays
S0192	mm
S0227	er they be only about three pound a lesson when i be learn
S0192	not worth ask mum she claim that she pay my first year's tuition fee which be a load of crap
S0227	well in
S0192	she try to change history and tell me that that's what happen last time i be home i say i don't think so
S0227	no no that's er no you don't know you know so
S0192	yeah i say i definitely er
S0192	i say i think you buy me a laptop
S0227	yeah
S0192	but that be it
S0227	tuition fee that no i think you'd remember that
S0192	no definitely
S0227	well
S0192	well i know she didn't i've get the form say that i be give the grant for it
S0227	yes
S0192	which it get automatically pay into
S0227	yes
S0192	i don't see that money so
S0227	no
S0192	why would i have the fee why would i owe the student loan for it if she pay it
S0227	no no i dunno why she get that in her head erm do she accept your explanation
S0192	no we get into a bite of an argument over it
S0227	well oh tell him oh er no i don't think you do love we couldn't afford it
S0192	she's pretty convince she do and i'm completely convince she didn't
S0227	oh no well i like i say i i if she's right or i think like you say this morning about something and i say no i think she's right on that erm if she's right i'll i'll i'll go with that if she's wrong i'll say i i think she's wrong i think she's wrong because you would remember something like that where do she possibly get i mean she do get some inheritance i know that
S0192	yeah i think i get a laptop with that
S0227	but she didn't er she didn't underwrite you a cheque for erm the erm for your fee she wouldn't have do that cos she'd have have to have do something similar for and then put some money aside
S0192	and i'm pretty sure she'd have ask you for half of it wouldn't she i don't think she'd have just give me a grand or something she'd have say your dad'll pay and you pay
S0227	she would she would've treat you equally she wouldn't like have pay a year of your tuition and say to er here's a doughnut erm er
S0192	i mean a year's tuition be a little different now than it
S0227	it's a lot of money
S0189	it be before
S0227	yes
S0192	and i'm sure 's cost mum quite a bite up until his twenty fourth year i don't think i've cost you you or mum too much since i be eighteen or nineteen
S0227	no no so no she wouldn't have pay cos like you say things like that well you for a start you'd you'd be you'd you'd have a level of gratitude which mean that you wouldn't forget a gift er a a generous gift like that she be never in a position apart from when you have that money and like i say she would've treat you quid pro quo erm it wasn't it wasn't a sizeable amount of money
S0192	be you ready to play battlestar then
S0227	yes
S0189	that'll be cool
S0192	do you wanna help me set it up
S0189	yeah sure
S0192	be we play it in the lounge
S0227	er
S0192	it might be more comfortable
S0227	yes in the lounge
S0192	yeah
S0227	in the lounge
S0192	erm be it just the four of us won't be
S0227	no there'll just be the four of us
S0227	'll be do he he's gear up to move tomorrow
S0192	it take a good few hours to play
S0227	oh yeah
S0192	so we probably want
S0227	well we'll play up to a certain time and then whoever's in front win be you with me
S0192	game doesn't quite work like that but we can cut it earlier
S0227	well you can continue it on the monday or whatever
S0192	yeah
S0227	er we'll just put it aside and
S0192	we'll have to leave it all set up
S0227	yeah it's not a big board be it so it's not like it's huge
S0192	not particularly large there's quite a few piece on it
S0227	yeah
S0192	but i think we could remember roughly
S0227	yeah i mean like board game
S0192	but provide we just start it pretty soon after dinner we should get it do
S0227	yeah
S0192	if we play from like seven till ten or something
S0227	i'll crack on and start cook dinner erm as soon as we get back and we've clear the shop up and i've get change
S0192	yeah
S0227	what you should do be er you set the game up so that it's ready for after you know cos obviously after tea we've gotta do the wash up and stuff like that
S0192	yeah will do
S0227	then after all that we can we'll make a start
S0192	i reckon we can be do by seven
S0227	no not
S0192	don't think two and a half hours
S0227	unless there's a lot of well you probably won't start for before half six i'd imagine
S0192	well i say
S0192	no that's what i mean start at seven
S0227	oh right
S0192	i'm sure we can eat and cook
S0227	oh you mean do by i think you mean the game's over by seven
S0192	no no no do cook do eat
S0227	oh yeah yeah yeah sure no i think you mean
S0192	game'll take three hours and with you newbs i'm pretty sure even longer
S0227	do you manage to avoid er get into an argument while she be back
S0192	me
S0227	yeah
S0192	i do didn't
S0227	what you're suppose to be her best friend
S0189	i know
S0227	what be you argue about not the rent again
S0192	think i be the good child
S0227	what the hell be you argue about now
S0189	oh it's nothing important
S0227	just the tuition fee why be it you pay 's
S0189	no
S0227	and you're and you're not pay my
S0192	have you have any more er
S0227	oh you don't love me as much
S0192	i didn't even know you have that conversation with her
S0192	which one about you
S0189	no
S0192	or with mum
S0189	they have a conversation about me
S0192	oh she tell me that erm she be a bite upset from your conversation the other day
S0189	oh yeah yeah no i mean you er your conversation with her about tuition
S0192	oh right that be last time i be home she be try to convince me that she pay my first year's tuitions fee
S0189	what
S0192	and i be try to convince her no you didn't
S0227	no with the greatest respect
S0192	she couldn't prove that she do
S0227	well no
S0192	and i could prove that she didn't
S0227	she yes yeah
S0189	i mean she could've give you the money and you just spend it
S0192	yeah i don't think she do
S0227	i think there's a difference between give you some money and and and pay for the tuition cos the pay for the tuition would've mean she would've be write a cheque directly to them as oppose to give you a blank cheque although she could've give you a cheque for you to do it
S0192	regardless
S0227	but you would er
S0192	the the whole reason that i take a year off
S0227	yeah
S0192	before uni be to save up
S0227	yes yes
S0192	if mum would've
S0227	yes
S0192	i defer i didn't
S0227	yes
S0192	i didn't apply at the end of my year off
S0227	no
S0192	i'd already get into university the year before i defer
S0227	yes another way
S0192	i only didn't go cos i didn't have enough money if mum would've turn around and say i'll pay for your
S0227	yes
S0192	your first year i would've go
S0227	er another way that you would know that you this didn't happen would be that erm she would've write you a cheque she wouldn't have give you a bag of money be you with me
S0192	mm
S0227	it would've be a cheque and you'd have er a proof of that in your account
S0192	anyway it doesn't matter it be just something that we er be say last time
S0227	well it do to cos he's think now where's my where's where's my where's my year's tutorial
S0189	never mind i'm not greedy
S0227	right who's go i'm go i'll go
S0192	i don't think mum's get the money
S0227	probably hasn't i know i haven't get the money any more
S0192	definitely hasn't
S0227	cos er we've lose
S0192	's gonna be the wealthiest in the family
S0227	well yeah we'll have to all be tap him up for a loan
S0192	definitely
S0227	cos erm 's lose all
S0227	's lose her wage her pension be gonna be quite pitiful really it'll be something like about five hundred pound a year
S0192	god
S0227	and erm
S0192	pension will be five hundred pound a year
S0227	yeah and er sick pay erm er her sick pay and her pension come a distant to to the money that she's obviously lose by not go back to work
S0192	why be her pension so low
S0227	er because a she hasn't be in it that much and it's not that that good a pension erm
S0192	be this a private pension
S0227	er well no it's er it's a company pension
S0192	what's her like state pension
S0227	sorry that's the state she's get she's gonna get about five hundred pound a year
S0192	that's how much the state think you need to live on
S0227	yeah although although she'll well there's two other small pension cos the she wasn't a final salary which be a good one this be the one i'm refer to but there'll be two other smaller ones that the company her company change from a final salary pension to this your mum's pension'll be good because it's the same pension as mine the only difference be be the the rate that she's kick into it and the time that that she's be kick into it
S0192	be it worth pay national insurance for a pension cos i'm like a few years out they're tell me that i owe them
S0227	yeah well er you
S0192	years of national insurance and i have to pay thirty years to be able to claim
S0227	yes you need about thirty years to qualify which mean the retirement for you isn't gonna be until you're about seventy anyway
S0192	so be it worth pay in or be it just worth
S0227	well
S0192	make my own pension
S0227	well
S0192	and save my own money and just ignore pay into national insurance
S0227	this all depend if you're go to live in the uk you're go to get a job and you're gonna pay national insurance if you like it or not
S0192	regardless
S0227	but if you're live abroad and you're not intend to come back here then you will won't be entitle to a pension if i move abroad my pension will go abroad to wherever i be cos i've earn it i'm i'm more i'm pay up because er i i've kick in if you don't contribute then you won't get a pension you won't be entitle
S0192	but i mean five hundred pound a year doesn't really seem worth it
S0227	no er but that's not her state pension that's her private pension
S0192	that's what i be ask you i say er be it a private pension or be it a state pension
S0227	no oh it's the oh sorry it's the private pension not the state
S0192	how much should she get from the state
S0227	the state will be something like about a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty pound a week
S0192	not too bad
S0227	no on top of your private pension erm like i say your mum should be okay erm 's pension'll be shit cos it's private you've gotta put a shitload of money in and the return be not very good if he'd put and i doubt this very much that he's he's he's get a pension pot where he's put about a hundred and twenty thousand into a pension pot that'll buy him a pension of about six thousand pound a year it won't be index link i doubt very much that he's save a hundred and twenty thousand into a pension scheme
S0192	no it seem a bite like a con to me
S0227	cos
S0192	just gonna get older and older before we can even have one and then you probably end up live for about four years on your pension and then you die so you claim out about twenty grand out of the hundred and twenty grand that you put in
S0227	well the er the reason they're put er the argument i don't necessarily believe it be that people will live longer
S0192	don't seem to be people seem to be die leave right and centre
S0227	er no well they no they don't they don't seem to be at all erm the the er the one at least one in every three people bear now will live till above er over a hundred that i don't
S0192	that's absolute bullshit
S0227	that i don't believe at all
S0192	i haven't believe it either to say
S0227	no
S0192	something like the you know the er average person live to eighty years and then you think well what about all the people that die before they even get to sixty
S0227	yes
S0192	so be they just not count in this statistic
S0227	well
S0192	be this statistic just the the average person that live beyond sixty
S0227	yeah
S0192	get to eighty
S0227	if you look at if the if the it use to be er erm three score and ten
S0192	i don't believe it either
S0227	be your er your life that's seventy
S0192	well it's in their favour to tell us that so that we keep pay into it
S0227	well
S0192	cos there's all this massive dependent like
S0227	there be the the problem be be that i don't think people will live the length that they're talk but a lot the within about fifteen years the or less the majority of people live in this country will be old rather than young so the young you lot will be try to pay not for your own pension but for our pension er you er the next generation will be burden with you so there'll be a lot or small number of people try to support above them a big number of people because the the the population of this county be age
S0192	pension
S0227	you need one
S0227	trust me i i cash one in when i be younger than you i be 's age erm i i think at the time i've get three hundred and thirty three pound i could get my hand on erm do i need it now or should i wait until i'm sixty five to get it the the think behind it at the time be everything will society will've probably break down and it'll be a bite like mad max
S0227	so there's no point i might as well have the three hundred and thirty three pound now so i do but once you start kick into a pension and you get to a certain age you start think the wisdom of have one i can't congratulate myself erm for er have one because i have no choice if when i'd start the work er with the local authority at twenty eight if they'd have say to me we can you can have a pension or we'll or er and we won't take six percent of your salary or we take six percent of your salary and you'll have a pension i'd've say i'll er keep the six percent and that would've be a a bad move
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos now it
S0192	but what's annoy for me be that i've be pay it in for the last four or five years and i've pay in about five thousand pound and it's just disappear
S0227	mm but not but not not to this not to this erm society
S0192	not to anything it's just go
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's just be eat
S0227	to koreans you might have a korean pension cos all you've gotta do be turn up for er you know
S0192	i er do i not tell you how the pension work over there
S0227	probably bad there i should imagine
S0192	every so there's only about five six different nations that work as teachers in korea you have to be from
S0227	yeah
S0192	native english speak country england be the only one that have to pay into the pension but doesn't get it back
S0227	oh right
S0192	every other country pay in get it double and then when they leave they get it back
S0227	right so money back
S0192	so they owe me about six thousand pound and they owe six thousand pound and all of my american friends be walk away with a bonus six thousand pound
S0227	yes
S0192	because of their pension
S0227	mm
S0192	south africans don't have to pay in but they don't they can't claim it back but they don't have to pay in
S0227	right
S0192	so they're exempt but i've be pay in every month
S0227	yes
S0192	for the four years that i've work there
S0227	well er that that seem
S0192	it's be double and i don't get it
S0227	that seem that seem wrong
S0192	it's only british people that's it that's the only people
S0227	if you contribute by by right by european law you'd get something back from er for that
S0192	it's a reciprocal law apparently we don't do the same to koreans that come and work in england
S0227	right
S0192	we don't let them get a refund on what they pay into national insurance but it's pointless
S0227	right well if it's an if it's a legal document between us and them then yeah
S0192	but it's bullshit though
S0227	yeah but the law isn't always right
S0192	it's a lot of money i could really do with an extra six thousand pound
S0227	yes er yes it be yeah of course
S0192	and i be gonna keep our eye on the news there and if anything ever change we'll be take a quick flight to south korea
S0227	yeah
S0192	and withdraw about twelve grand in between us
S0227	yes
S0192	it's just annoy that i've pay into pension that money's go
S0227	yes
S0192	and yet british you know national insurance be contact me
S0227	yes
S0192	and ask for pension here
S0227	well you er you you just say well i've not i'm not live in the country
S0192	er yeah i mean they tell me it's voluntary i don't have to pay it but i guess i'm just at the point now where i'm like should i pay it
S0227	yeah erm this will focus your mind that you know if you stay here you either have will have to contribute for thirty years to get something or you don't factor in that pension and you get a pension by another way by buy a house and then buy a second house that you will then rent out as your source of income
S0192	mm
S0227	there's always mean and ways as i say private pension i wouldn't apart company ones now be like private pension and you can opt out but i would imagine if you opt out you won't get any more than the state pension further down the road if er cos they give you pension credit now er which i think be what's that's a bite absurd er people be pay into a pension and people who aren't pay in be get pension credit but i would imagine that that'll come to a a stop because they'll be go well you be work and you be give a choice of pay into a private pension you choose not to so therefore you'll get your you've earn your state pension but we're not gonna add you anything on top because you have the choice of a private pension er with with your workplace your workplace pension but you decide to opt out
S0192	didn't take it do you have anything to comment on pension
S0189	erm i'm a bite young to start think about it but i suppose i'm twenty four so
S0227	yeah he's er still get a few more years
S0227	at some time you have to think about it you you have to start big picture think
S0189	i don't really see the point
S0227	you don't trust me your your brain be erm it's like my brain work different from you two because i'm i'm a parent the chemical process of your brain change man and woman when you become a parent you you think differently you'd look at things that you didn't think about and care about before and you now look at em in a different way
S0192	why do you think it's pointless
S0189	well i see it as give money away willingly for someone else to invest and you may or may not get it back i mean i might as well save that money
S0192	it's a bite of a gamble isn't it
S0189	yeah
S0227	that be the trouble
S0189	invest it myself
S0227	that er that be the problem with a with a private pension er yeah with mine because mine's a final salary er i can work out almost to the pound how much i'll get every month i've get a little erm
S0192	and it's completely safe
S0227	i put it's it's copper it's it's gold plat the only reason that wouldn't become safe be there there's a there's be a nuclear war
S0192	yeah
S0227	apart from that it it's copper line yeah er i wouldn't transfer it into a tin pot pale comparison er pension it's not the best pension out there there be better pension but it's a bloody good one compare to private
S0189	if i have the option of pay into a pension now in fact i do in my job
S0227	yeah
S0189	and i didn't want to
S0227	oh
S0192	you opt out
S0189	yeah
S0192	do you remember how much that be gonna be
S0189	oh a couple of percent
S0227	you know it's erm something er that i would consider by thirty you don't really need need 's get more
S0189	thirty yeah
S0227	thirty for you be not that far away
S0192	no
S0227	for him it's still he's still closer he's still closer to twenty than thirty you're clearly not and in a few weeks' time i will be closer to sixty than fifty what a what a horrify think
S0192	jesus
S0227	yes
S0192	how do it work then how do a private pension work i give em the money
S0227	you buy an
S0192	and then
S0227	you buy an annuity
S0192	they add more money to it because they use the money to invest
S0227	they they put it on they put it they take their cut that's why you don't want to keep change pension company because every time you do this they take a cut admin fee and all that rubbish erm what they do be they invest it on the stock exchange they probably have they have and what's know as a portfolio they'll put some stuff in high risk medium risk and low risk and then you get an average of return some will lose some will gain some will do nothing so it erm that be how it
S0192	they're actually gamble on your save for your future
S0227	yeah yes exactly yeah they're not lose erm erm
S0227	and erm so they can't give you a figure apart from er a final settlement figure as to a projection because they don't know what the stock market's gonna be do so what happen be then be that you buy an annuity that annuity enable you to er a company will then erm take your money and they will then give you a yearly pension for the rest of your life but unlike mine yours won't be index link so say for argument's sake you get six a six thousand pound pension in twenty years' time it'd still be six grand it wouldn't have go up with inflation mine will if i ever give your mother some good advice i say to her when she be be still with me erm with the work part time for the council get on the pension and she do she follow that advice that be good advice i give her because that's now add to her length of service otherwise it wouldn't have be it would've be when she get her job properly full time dah dah dah it would've start run then so i think to myself at the time get into this pension cos er i'm in it if we're both in it you you know life'll be easier
S0192	yeah i guess come thirty i'm gonna have to start think about that
S0227	well you're gonna have to start think about a lot of things to be fair erm
S0227	you know erm er you you look at your life and you try and map it out i never really have that kind of plan my er i mean my wisdom come through
S0192	trial and error
S0227	experience experience
S0192	error error error trial
S0227	you're you're much more you're much more organise than i be at your age erm deal with things you have a plan a man with a plan will always beat a man without a plan
S0192	mm
S0227	i didn't have a plan i er i never expect where i turn up er end up and er i can't congratulate myself i can't berate myself either it's all just happenstance
S0227	that's what happen
S0192	from your background you've do pretty well
S0227	i've do better than my old man that's for sure but it be never a race between me and him
S0192	oh this be new sainsbury's local
S0227	yeah yeah so yeah er it be never a race me and him
S0192	the race now be between and i
S0227	it's between you and yourself in the end
S0192	and
S0189	you've get four years advance four years ahead
S0227	one of you will be bless with money maybe one of you won't you both be bless with money or you may not be bless with money i don't know
S0192	will be and he'll leave me in his will and he will die a shock and dramatic early death

S0227	er i didn't know you be
S0192	your favourite
S0227	i didn't know you be shop and i know we be low and some
S0192	do you buy some mushroom also
S0227	coriander and some
S0192	cilantro
S0227	lemon grass
S0192	why do you buy lemon grass don't you have lemon grass
S0227	yes but i don't want to chop any more off of your plant
S0192	no okay
S0227	so i didn't
S0192	yeah i appreciate that
S0227	see where i've already chop twice off of it and i think no erm you'll have nothing you know er unless we get more sun you won't have too much more growth so there's some for you to go and it will overwinter and then if you've look after it you'll get it it'll serve you for next summer
S0192	so it's not gonna do much more between now and next summer
S0227	well it will do but photosynthesis will start shut down in about october time
S0192	oh right
S0227	once you still cut it now it will still keep grow but i think well you might as well have it and cut off the big chunk while you you can now and it will grow back like i say once winter set in the the growth will just like grass it stop grow
S0192	in korea i just use a bag of dry lemon grass it work fine i have to steep it in a cup kinda like tea
S0227	right
S0192	for a while and it make like er smell like a lemsip
S0227	yes liquid
S0192	and then i just add the liquid to the thing
S0227	liquid
S0192	wasn't too expensive for a big old bag of the dry stuff it last quite a while
S0227	er what what you what you can do with your lemon grass to like to er if you've get an ice cube tray be cut it up fine
S0192	freeze it
S0227	with a bite of water freeze it into ice cub
S0192	yeah
S0227	that mean that you get as much harvest er as you can and then see how long that last you
S0192	yeah
S0227	and then i just drop the ice cub into the erm but you'd have to either use a blender which you probably haven't get or a knife to cut it up quite fine
S0192	yeah i need a blender to cook so
S0227	yes
S0192	we're 's parent have already get us one
S0227	have they get you one
S0192	yeah i think so
S0227	oh
S0192	it's kind of mandatory
S0189	i be think about that pull up bar
S0192	yeah
S0189	and er if it fit in your doorframes at your new place you can have it
S0192	do you not want it
S0189	i do but i think you're gonna get more use out of it than me cos i'm gonna be have the gym access every day
S0192	i mean that'd be awesome
S0227	if you wanna and you'll have i've get that bar i've get a bar and some weight that you can have
S0192	if you're happy to do that that would be great
S0227	oh i'm not use them you er not obviously you can't have the multigym you haven't get any
S0192	no no no but between the both of you a bar and some weight and i'm sort for the year
S0227	yeah it give you a bite to do
S0192	thank you very much

S0189	it be really noisy
S0227	but it's but it's cute it look really nice
