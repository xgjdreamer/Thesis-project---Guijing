S0012	that's a varicose vein on your wrist
S0013	hmm
S0144	so where do you wanna go and practise in the car
S0024	just round the block just so that i feel comfortable
S0013	yeah just so that you know how to drive that that particular car that's all
S0144	you'll have to practise all five gear so we'll have to get up to at least eighty
S0012	eighty
S0012	there's no roads around here that'll take eighty eighty can you imagine go eighty around here
S0144	god when you walk we're walk
S0013	what's nice be i mean you do actually when you start off you do just a normal sort of run don't you i mean it's just you just keep go
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm
S0013	yeah
S0144	we walk last time we go for a walk down that back road that one there
S0012	yeah
S0144	this car come past he must have be do sixty seventy
S0012	i know they're lairy absolutely stupid
S0144	he didn't slow down for us we have to jump up on the verge
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah i bet that be a young boy
S0013	mm
S0144	yeah probably i didn't really look he have that kind of car though
S0013	mm
S0012	cos when when they have the the road close through they send them up round this way and and round the back
S0013	and as well
S0012	and as well
S0144	hmm
S0012	and that down especially
S0013	you know it's all
S0012	there be
S0024	mm no i don't even walk down there ever because of the cars
S0012	no
S0024	there's be accidents
S0144	which one's that
S0012	that's that's the one just down the road there
S0024	by the social club just after the social club towards there's a road leave and it go all the way round to uncle 's
S0012	to 's we've walk
S0013	mm
S0012	we walk the footpath and and across
S0024	yeah when you walk the footpath across the field
S0144	mm
S0024	usually then we come in some point along this road but if you keep go you'll end up in
S0013	yeah you come into
S0144	right okay
S0013	mm
S0012	and when when they have the diversions through there there be so many accidents
S0144	huh
S0012	cos they think they can still drive as fast along a country lane as they can
S0144	yeah
S0013	and there's hardly any you know you've get to get in to do your pass cos there's only room for one
S0144	mm
S0013	one car
S0144	yeah
S0013	so you've gotta think ahead all the time and people don't they just think everyone else be gonna think ahead instead
S0024	yeah i know
S0013	mm
S0024	that's why i don't i mean otherwise i'd love drive along country lanes
S0013	yeah
S0024	but you just can't tell what other people be gonna do
S0012	apparently there's more accidents on the country on the rural roads than on motorways
S0013	we think the motorways it's space isn't it
S0012	more serious accidents
S0013	and i i i always think well keep in the the inside lane all the time
S0012	yeah the inside lane yeah
S0013	unless you've get the unless you've get tons of room to pass like erm caravan and stuff just keep there
S0144	mm
S0013	you're safe there aren't you
S0012	well normally in the on the inside lane anyway they're do at least sixty most of them
S0013	they be aren't they
S0012	but sometimes you come across a very slow move lorry or caravan and you can pull out nicely and overtake them
S0144	mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	but to stay in the centre lane you have to do seventy and if if you're not comfortable at that you know with all these great old lorries
S0024	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	some of them as you as you pull alongside or a lorry pass you it it you can actually feel it draw you in like that
S0024	yeah
S0012	you know
S0144	mm
S0024	yeah we've pass a well we get catch i don't know where what happen i don't understand maybe it be after
S0144	no you don't like lorries do you
S0024	no no i don't like the lorries
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0144	you get good at the end though
S0024	cos you do you feel that there's something to do with the wind next to the lorry
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0024	and it do something to the car
S0012	yeah it do well you've get enormous force
S0024	and i don't think you can feel control if there's some outside force
S0013	mm
S0024	somewhere
S0012	well you when you've get a forty ton lorry travel at around about seventy mile an hour can you imagine that wind force
S0144	hmm mm
S0012	come past
S0144	hmm
S0024	i mean cos it's so high
S0012	and when you when you hit it when that hit you
S0144	mm
S0012	that buff at you like like a plane in the
S0144	mm
S0012	in the in the
S0024	yeah turbulence yeah
S0144	turbulence
S0012	yeah turbulence that's what it be that's the word i be look for
S0024	and that's when people
