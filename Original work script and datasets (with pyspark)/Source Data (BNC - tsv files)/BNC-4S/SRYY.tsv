S0192	what be that
S0199	three
S0192	it look like a curry of some sort or some sort of
S0199	don't know it's something that erm
S0192	something marinate
S0199	yeah something make
S0192	oh be it 's

S0199	well just see what's
S0192	i don't know when i'm go to dad's or what's go down
S0199	just see what's in the freezer first use up what you've get you might need to get a few bits to go with it there's load of potatoes down there and there's pasta and rice
S0192	oh look that's burn
S0199	oh sorry
S0192	why be that burn
S0199	i don't know actually i think because 's be do his toast teacakes in it

S0192	these bean need to cook for a little while anyway
S0199	yeah
S0192	so you say your bloom bigger
S0199	yeah i'd be really upset if they didn't but i think i need to dig them up because they're get weaker
S0192	i take it that other plant i buy you die

S0199	well it must be a couple of years isn't it
S0192	yeah it say about a year
S0199	but it fly and the robin go in there
S0192	yeah it doesn't look like there's any kind of nest or anything
S0199	i think this should be okay now
S0192	but erm i think it have to
S0199	be it
S0192	it have to smell more more like a normal old thing rather than some new
S0199	yeah could you erm shut that toilet door for me please
S0192	yeah certainly
S0199	i've get a thing about it be so close to the kitchen
S0192	your pip be so noisy
S0199	oh i know
S0192	i be in there and you turn the tap on or something
S0199	when you it's awful isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0199	it's just like that's terrible we need to when we get more time well that's the one thing that we'll have more time once the band's finish
S0192	yeah i think you need it
S0199	well yeah that's it
S0192	how be you go to deal with the lack of money though on that front cos obviously you need to have a bite of money
S0199	well erm yeah i mean 's be tell by his boss that he can get overtime whenever he want it so he work out
S0192	oh they're everywhere
S0199	sorry yeah
S0192	wow that's what be that
S0199	it's a dustbuster
S0192	sort of black and decker
S0199	dustbuster
S0192	dustbuster
S0199	brilliant thing these be
S0192	awesome
S0199	just for a quick quick fix get the toast up erm
S0192	right so let's put the toaster back in shall we
S0199	yeah i'll just put it back over
S0192	all these clean things go back there
S0199	just turn them around there
S0192	yeah he's we work out that erm do a saturday morning or or possibly an extra hour a day he probably would make the same money he make from do the gigs and he wouldn't have the practice once a week and the double gigs at the weekend i mean you're talk about probably another full day's work by the time you've leave go and set up wait to do your gig pack up and get home you're talk probably seven hours
S0192	you do avon as well don't you still
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's terrible that you both work full time and yet that's not enough money you still have to do another job
S0199	yeah well it probably be we probably live above what we should be live
S0192	no i mean work full time you should have enough money
S0199	yeah
S0192	to be able to have a house and do these things and what have you
S0199	i know i know but money's like water through our hand you know it's kind of like but then you only live once don't you so
S0192	yeah
S0199	but erm
S0192	no point leave it in here
S0199	there'll be some money i'm sure stuff and through property
S0192	oh right right down to it
S0199	there won't be any save i don't think but
S0192	there's not go to be anything
S0199	there'll be a property with to sell
S0192	doubt of all you'll get funnel off into a home and then
S0199	oh yeah and then the state will take it all
S0192	the state'll take it all it's terrible so many of my friends be go to inherit so much money so many of my friends
S0199	really
S0192	it's ridiculous
S0199	well you're gonna have dad's inheritance as well aren't you
S0192	what's that
S0199	well whatever the property or whatever he's leave to and sell
S0192	well i doubt if he'll be leave with much
S0199	well it's half his home and
S0192	yeah i know i know
S0199	and and his whatever be his be yours isn't it yours and 's
S0192	that's why i mean he'll probably end up in a home at some point or you know after die i can't see that he's go to stay still he'll probably wanna go off and do something
S0199	mm
S0192	his pension's not particularly big
S0199	mm
S0192	no i'm talk about my friends who be go to be inherit hundreds of thousands of pound
S0199	mm
S0192	hundreds of thousands no worry i mean i've i'm pretty sure will make a million in inheritance i've get a few quite a few american friends that just seem like they're completely set forever
S0199	yeah
S0192	and not just american friends there's quite a few british friends as well just so like
S0199	you be bear into the wrong family weren't you
S0192	the it wouldn't be such a problem if erm be also but like it's the fact that both of us
S0192	be really not go to inherit
S0199	yeah
S0192	you know and of course you don't look for inheritance but it's
S0199	no it's nice to have a little bite of hand out
S0192	it's it yeah it's a security blanket
S0199	yeah
S0192	but then the friends that have get it they say oh you know why be you think about it we never think about it and it's like well that's cos you're gonna get it
S0199	yeah
S0192	you're go to get older and and you don't really have to worry about
S0199	yeah
S0192	pension or you know every get property or any of that stuff
S0199	but you're gonna make enough money in your own right to not need any of that
S0192	provide and i never have a child that's true but if we have a
S0199	do you think a child would change it then
S0192	if we have a child we'll be poor for the rest of our life
S0199	why would you be if you've get to the status of lecture or whatever
S0192	i mean you're only on about oh that's the thing to to get the status of be a lecturer we need to put in another ten years of solid work

S0191	let's do it let's do it let's
S0192	or elt project in the future or something
S0189	can i have all of these bean
S0192	yeah they're all yours effectively though they're just make an archive
S0191	i need to put my hand on there
S0199	get up then
S0191	let's do it let's do it do it let's do it let's do it do
S0192	if you think about it historically we will all be record in the archive of what do what do british people sound like in 2014 and you'll be a contribution to that
S0189	that's quite interest
S0192	so it's historical
S0189	yeah
S0192	i need to see how they're track my bag
S0191	be we can we do slow motion
S0192	so i just eat do you remember before i say i've just eat and i can't do it after i've just eat and what do you do you ask me again
S0189	it's a shame you can't go and sit in an old age pensioners' home and
S0192	oh this be terrible
S0191	but we're never go to play slow motion
S0192	i've give them dad's address and i can't get through to them today i can't get through to dad today and they're try to deliver it now it say on the thing delivery process initiate but to deliver they have to they have to have to ring him and he's not there to pick up the phone so it can't be deliver and i can't get hold of them to tell them to change the address and deliver it here
S0199	there be no way of change the address on there
S0192	there's nothing there's nothing on here it's just tell me what it be it's not
S0199	have you try your dad's mobile
S0192	he never have it on outside of work do he
S0189	it's worth try though
S0192	give it a try
S0199	just say dad i need to speak to you urgently
S0192	but still how be they still go to get hold of him
S0189	i don't know
S0192	that doesn't change anything what be i go to do tell him to go home and stand by the phone
S0199	well he might be at home
S0192	i don't think he be at home i think if he be at home he'd pick up the phone do you not think
S0189	he might be at the hospital though
S0192	i think they say something about a barbecue today i need to try and ring these people again i'm just annoy we have to sit there on hold for half an hour before i get through
S0199	mm you'll just have to do it put it on speaker phone
S0191	he's do ballet ding
S0192	cos it's now say delivery process initiate which mean before it be say they couldn't find one
S0199	okay try ring them then
S0189	well that's some good news at least
S0192	yeah
S0189	it's be find
S0191	oh
S0199	and especially if erm if it's not go to be deliver today and it's get to be deliver tomorrow you need to make sure someone's gonna be there
S0192	yeah i know tell me about it
S0199	i think you're go to have to sit on the phone and get the address change
S0192	i want to get it send just typical though i mean why can't they contact me by email i give them my bloody email address
S0191	a
S0192	they always prefer phone out of what be you look at
S0189	i be just see how long it's record
S0192	it's on for nearly forty five minutes we be with in the car earlier it might have to be cut out
S0189	why
S0192	i'll have to listen to it and see if anything
S0191	oh see see that
S0192	what have you do
S0192	you make him naked
S0192	why d'you do that
S0199	why be that funny don't be so silly
S0191	mm
S0192	what's funny about a bottom
S0199	if you didn't have a bottom you wouldn't be able to sit down comfortably
S0191	mm
S0189	you wouldn't be able to poop
S0192	no
S0192	bottom be necessary
S0189	uhu
S0199	don't be silly
S0192	nothing's funny about it
S0199	he'll get cold
S0189	if it wouldn't be funny
S0191	he's weird
S0192	no i know
S0191	look
S0199	he's do acrobats
S0191	he can do the split
S0192	i can't be bother to ring these people and stay on hold
S0199	think you're go to have to though
S0192	you just never know if they you're actually ever gonna get through or not
S0199	mm
S0192	you know what i mean i sit on hold for about fifteen minutes earlier or maybe ten minutes ten or fifteen minutes you're just like
S0199	and there's no email address
S0192	there's definitely some no
S0199	nothing you can reach them through
S0192	no there's no email address there's nothing i can do
S0199	no customer service bite
S0192	what do you mean that's who i'm ring
S0199	or yeah
S0191	mummy
S0199	oh yeah he's do all sort look as his muscle he's get a ripple body hasn't he
S0199	he's a get
S0192	why do you take off his clothe have you notice he's a eunuch
S0199	mm don't go there
S0192	well
S0199	it's enough of his interest of body part at the moment
S0192	remember the word eunuch and remember me when you finally discover what it mean
S0191	mm
S0199	right here you go he's hot he doesn't want his top on but he want to do some exercise now
S0191	his knee's break
S0199	his knee's break oh i think it that one's not no it's alright he can bend
S0192	how do he break his knee
S0199	what about his arm his arm's all twist round the wrong way
S0189	i'm surprise that you can just record anything
S0199	he want to run
S0192	why
S0189	just cos like you can imagine if two people be talk at the same time like if someone's interrupt you it make it hard
S0191	i'm sit on the toilet
S0189	and whatever algorithm they're use that analyse this
S0192	they're not use an algorithm to analyse it they're use people
S0189	oh right
S0192	mm people
S0189	someone's go to actually listen through to our conversations
S0199	be you go to come and help me put the wash out come and give me a hand put your shoe on
S0192	do you remember i be tell you about ipa
S0189	yeah
S0192	and how i want them to do it some people be go to have to transcribe all of these thousands of hours into ipa
S0189	wow that's go to take a lot of time
S0192	yeah it's go to take a hell of a lot of time unless i'm wrong and they do have a computer programme but one would presume that when the numerous people be speak how well they can do it they probably wouldn't be able to do that
S0189	mm
S0199	come to help me it's all warm out here now i'll text aunty and see if she's in er get your shoe and come and give me a hand
S0199	let's see if aunty be go to be in
S0191	i go like this
S0199	don't be silly
S0191	oh oh look at his six pack
S0199	mm he's get muscle hasn't he
S0192	erm they're want to discover the phonology i guess of how people speak in england and where they're from the form that you'll have to fill out will ask you where you're from where you live how many languages you speak what job you have all that kind of thing so there's a bite of sociolinguistic variation they'll probably be listen into what kind of word you use it won't be the content of what you're say just like what word you're use and your pronunciation probably
S0189	yeah it's gonna be a lot of work if they have to do it by hand
S0192	yeah i can't be certain of that but i can i think that's what it be i can't see that they'll have a machine accurate enough we have a lot of different sound and it would be very difficult for the machine to segregate all of those sound cos we just speak when when i'm speak to you right now there be no separation of sound whatsoever there be just a constant stream of sound
S0189	well voice recognition have get quite far
S0192	yeah it have
S0189	i mean it could pick out a word out of a sentence and then if it just look through all the data that it's accumulate look for that word and then find all the variations of it could improve its accuracy
S0191	be your six pack like that
S0192	but perhaps they're get the information to find the different variations of it maybe they don't have all the variations of the word
S0199	come on let's go and put the wash out
S0191	be your six pack like that
S0192	oh my six pack's better than that much better than that
S0191	let's see
S0192	erm yeah i really don't know
S0191	much better than that
S0192	but i mean they're not just break down the word they're not separate the word they be then break down all the sound of the word
S0189	mm
S0192	into the separate and i mean i from my research what's really really hard about erm voice recognition be
S0191	let's see let's see let's see if it's better and that let's see if it's better on that
S0199	mm
S0191	let's see if it's better on this this back let's see
S0192	once you get outside of command and you start use polysemy use word that have a mean that's more metaphorical it's very difficult for the machine to know whether i'm actually use
S0189	mm
S0191	let's see
S0192	sorry
S0191	let's see if yours be better than his
S0192	for example if i be to say i'm high how would the computer know whether that's spatial or whether it's metaphorical
S0189	it wouldn't
S0192	no it wouldn't
S0189	if it's out of context and you just say i'm high we wouldn't know either
S0192	no erm but it wouldn't ever be out of context
S0189	no
S0192	not really we always have a lot of clue that will tell us
S0189	yeah
S0192	what the context be but of course yeah if you take a sentence on its own and take it out of context then yeah it's very very difficult to tell
S0189	yeah
S0192	but that's where the computers have problems because there's so so many word that we use that be completely metaphorical
S0189	mm
S0192	they just don't really make any sense
S0189	mm
S0191	this isn't a stand up game
S0192	but be it not be it a sit down game
S0191	uhu
S0192	look like a stand up game to me
S0191	it's sit this be what you do you do do do
S0189	speak metaphorically be kind of like combine the multiple sense that make us human
S0192	mm
S0189	and like a machine can't do that
S0192	no
S0189	they're not that advance
S0192	but it's so common in our speech
S0189	yeah
S0192	it's ridiculous interestingly the word i be read an article about how the word literally how it's now come on to have a completely opposite mean
S0191	it's not a stand up game it's not a stand up game
S0192	what be it then
S0191	it's it's this game
S0192	it's a sit down game
S0191	yeah
S0192	oh okay it's fizzball isn't it
S0191	i don't know
S0189	yeah i see what you mean if someone say i literally can't wait
S0192	it mean figuratively
S0189	that er yeah yeah
S0192	it
S0189	that doesn't mean that they're actually go to go walk out
S0192	no literally have take the opposite mean it's take a completely opposite mean to what it use to be people say it all the time like i literally can't be bother to do this
S0189	then why aren't you walk out the door
S0192	yeah it's strange isn't it
S0189	yeah
S0192	but a computer wouldn't be able to pick that up and you'd have to have it so update all of the time with everything they really need still humans analyse this and as well problem again with the computer be with homophony or homonym where a word have the same pronunciation but a different mean and how would a computer be able to pick up whether i'm talk about a bat or a bat
S0189	mm
S0192	it would have to understand the entire context of the sentence
S0189	yeah
S0192	and what i'm talk about and i could be say it completely separate
S0189	yeah
S0192	so it would be really difficult for them to know again which word be be use what be you do
S0192	oh i think mum need your help it's too windy out there she be just call for you quick
S0191	no
S0192	show me how fast you can run earlier you be like i can run like super fast
S0192	go on quick i bet you can't do it in three second three
S0191	no
S0192	two
S0191	no you can't you can't you need to run
S0192	no look mum need help look how windy it be
S0191	you can't do it till i you can't do it till i'm erm on the grass i have to run round the run round three to
S0192	you just burp away there
S0189	i'll be fart outrageous
S0192	yeah would do
S0189	from them bean
S0191	i have to run round i have to run round the garden and you have to and i have to try and do it in three second
S0192	go on then if you can do it in three second i think mummy definitely need help
S0191	i'll try and do it in three second and run round
S0192	cool
S0191	in three second i only have to run round once only once
S0189	you should find er erm a pensioners' home just go and sit with them and listen to them natter
S0192	definitely
S0191	hey
S0192	just listen to them talk
S0189	yeah
S0192	i do have to get them to sign consent form but once they've sign once consent form like once i get you to sign the consent form that's it i don't have get you to kind of sign a consent form every time
S0189	see if you can get the like the whole group to do it
S0192	yeah to do it
S0189	or go to like i don't know i suppose that would be more difficult but like alcoholics anonymous or something and just sit i suppose there's a bite more sensitive
S0192	i feel pretty lucky to have come across this cos they don't make these corpuses very often
S0191	i'm do it in three second
S0199	go on then darling
S0192	in fact i'm not even sure if they've get one i think this be the first record one
S0189	mm
S0192	that they've do they've get a write one
S0191	have we count to three second when i'm on the grass
S0192	okay i'll be do that definitely erm but the last corpus they make
S0191	now
S0192	okay three last corpus they make be they get three hundred million word be the last corpus so that be all write so they use it they use the write corpus for things like if you go on the website
S0191	what be it
S0189	it be about eight second
S0192	it be about eight
S0191	oh
S0192	can you do it quicker
S0191	i'll try
S0192	you need to get it down to six try again just don't fall over be careful
S0191	okay
S0192	they erm you'll go on the computer programme and you'll type in a phrase an idiom a lexeme or something or other and then the machine will tell you how common it be or like other random statistics so then they use it for elt book that's how they make their money because then they make five so close one more time and i think you can do it in three
S0192	give it a try
S0189	it's actually about ten
S0192	so they use it in elt book so it will say in the elt book it will say a phrase and it will say accord to the cambridge corpus this be the tenth most use phrase in such and such so native and non native speakers can feel confident know that we native speakers use these word
S0189	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean that they're common in
S0189	careful
S0192	so i guess they will make money off this somehow
S0189	yeah
S0192	you may even find they take snippets
S0191	what be it
S0192	part of the consensus that they can it can be replay in other place
S0191	what be it
S0192	so you could find you get put in a textbook somewhere you know what i mean
S0189	i don't know you could be in a film somewhere or they've get this hologram that say
S0192	yeah i know
S0189	it can be replay
S0199	what be it
S0189	it's your voice
S0192	you do it in three second congratulations high five way have see these loom that everyone's into
S0189	yes i have just one of those fads like pokemon or
S0192	do yeah but it's a bite worse i mean it look terribly bore
S0192	do you do i'm kind of half convince some man with a massive warehouse full of small rubber band be like i really need to sell these
S0189	yeah like wacky wave inflatable tube man
S0192	yeah do they not look exactly like the same elastic band that go in people's brace
S0189	they do
S0191	hi
S0192	hello
S0189	i guess all they do be put a bunch of advertise on it and give it hand it out at school
S0191	this be what you have to have
S0192	have it get advertise then
S0189	well no but i mean they can do it come in package
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0189	loom band
S0192	yeah probably
S0189	well you have to have a name sound like a brand
S0192	loom it's loom
S0189	so that's your hat
S0192	oh careful
S0199	not back yet
S0192	he's not back
S0199	hadn't come back to me yet
S0192	oh she hasn't reply
S0189	oh would be perfect here she doesn't shut up
S0192	i know i'm i'm go this afternoon
S0189	yeah
S0189	there you go do all the family round it'll be such a good
S0192	problem be i think 's get to come and it's make it really really difficult
S0189	why do he have to come
S0192	i don't know unless he stay with you
S0189	mm
S0192	yeah that's exactly it and then it kind of make it difficult to record when he's there
S0191	i wanna come
S0192	i know you wanna come
S0189	do they need like child data
S0192	no actually you're not mean to record anyone that's less than eighteen and i have to get my mother to write consent for him but in general they don't want people but i can't what can i do about that there must be a lot of people that have i mean the children be everywhere
S0189	mm
S0192	you can't really avoid it can you
S0189	no okay so that dictaphone you've get
S0192	yeah
S0189	be don't know it look directional
S0192	yeah i think it slightly be i keep try to point it roughly at people
S0189	yeah
S0192	point at the ceiling at the moment though
S0189	yeah cos otherwise it would have it would have to come out of the device
S0192	yeah it's pick it up pretty good
S0189	mm
S0192	it's the sound quality's quite good it's about forty pound so two hours of record will pay it off 's get one too so hopefully she's do some record
S0189	that's good a sony
S0192	yeah obviously don't press any button
S0189	no i won't
S0192	we're get on for an hour
S0189	yeah
S0192	i pause it as well i pause it earlier while i be eat and then un pause it i make sure that i stop talk and pause it and then re start talk and un pause it but i don't know if that's actually allow i'm not so i might have to get in contact with them
S0189	well during moments of silence i don't see the problem
S0191	i can get them
S0192	no i don't see the problem either
S0189	and well i suppose the conversation would suddenly change you know
S0192	yeah
S0189	or the context and everything change as well
S0192	but it doesn't really that's another thing although i'm just record it it's not finish then i have to get these form and then i have to probably at least briefly listen to it again and it ask me what topics roughly be talk about and it ask me what kind of conversational clue be happen you know be it interrogatives be it question be it whatever so it's i have to fill out a little bite of paperwork for each one but i mean for eighteen pound an hour
S0189	yeah
S0192	i can't really complain
S0189	be you sure they're not go to like take your mp3 strip down all the empty space
S0189	and it's actually about four minutes of speak
S0192	yeah they could do couldn't they
S0189	yeah
S0192	i mean if we delete all of the er the blank and it can't too much empty space though
S0189	oh no
S0192	people talk pretty consistently
S0189	yeah
S0192	i just need to try and record as many people as possible well obviously if i'm go to be able to make this my proper job then i'm go to have to be do a lot of record
S0189	mm
S0192	and i to get the money that we want we we give ourselves a target of a hundred pound each a week to live off
S0189	yeah
S0192	while we be here and that mean we need to do five hours of record each week every week
S0189	yeah but that's
S0192	until next june
S0189	like that's what forty minutes a day and you're over it
S0192	yeah but it's find the people you've get to be able to find enough people i mean although i have i can apparently record people an infinite amount of time i still think that i'd like to make the research as vary as possible therefore i should get as many people as i can so although i will record all of my family and all my friends numerous time i will do probably make an effort to meet with random people that i don't know
S0189	it depend how much of a pain these form be
S0192	they're not too bad
S0189	no
S0192	it's just like two page just ask you some basic detail i think you hit the nail on the head though go to an old people's home they like to speak with people
S0189	they do
S0192	effectively just go and do some volunteer at an old people's home
S0189	yeah the old lady across the street love to chat she'd probably have good conversation with you
S0192	yeah
S0189	er like i go to pick up a parcel last week and i be stand there unable to escape for about half an hour
S0189	at the door
S0192	what be she talk about why couldn't you escape
S0189	oh she be just like oh she want to know about where i'd go and like my trip and then she start talk about her family and i'm oh well it wasn't that bad she seem like a nice lady
S0192	yeah
S0189	but like you really get catch there and you can't leave
S0192	yeah with old people they just talk don't they
S0189	yes they do but they get lonely so i kind of feel bad cos she say like oh you're the only person that's that's i've i've speak to in in three days
S0189	i'm like oh
S0189	i can't leave now
S0192	yeah guilting you into that
S0189	yeah i get reel in yeah
S0192	harsh but true i should probably ring these people shouldn't i
S0189	indeed if you want your bag back you'd better
S0192	yeah i kind of do want my bag back do you mind if i invite over
S0189	yeah no worry
S0192	in the next few days he'll probably come over be you friends with him or not i don't really remember
S0189	yeah i i've run into him a couple of time in the past couple of years
S0192	have a good chat to him
S0192	yeah he's a good guy he's get marry but he hasn't invite me the bastard
S0189	oh shit
S0189	that suck
S0192	yeah he's get marry this month next month
S0189	be we gonna mention that to him
S0192	no it's his prerogative if he doesn't want to invite me i guess i've realise that you know we can't be that close i do live abroad and i don't really see him that much so it's probably fair you do
S0199	yeah just gonna wash up and then we'll go and sort out some stuff shall we
S0192	i need to ring those people now so i'll do that now
S0191	six
S0199	okay cool
