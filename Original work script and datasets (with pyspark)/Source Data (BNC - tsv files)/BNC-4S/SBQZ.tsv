S0388	cos they talk about meet but chelsea they live in the most amaze house but i don't know what they do for a live i don't know how well they're
S0388	but i don't know what they do day to day one of them's in pr
S0262	right
S0388	one of them's in dabble in a bite of photography
S0262	right
S0388	erm like the only way be essex they have open shop in brentwood
S0262	right open
S0388	so they've all get beauty salons dress shop
S0262	so there's some sort of something
S0388	yeah yeah
S0262	just their live as in they set up a business and
S0388	but but i think the shop come after the show so they've go into that
S0262	ah
S0388	i and make the most of that celebrity
S0262	ah
S0388	cos brentwood you have holiday company bring all the young people who watch it and they stay in the motel and then they take them all round erm brentwood like sugar hut all round to the different shop so you see them totter around brentwood
S0262	right
S0388	erm and yeah it's make big business
S0262	around yeah oh right yeah
S0388	and brentwood be a tourist spot now
S0262	wow
S0388	which be very amuse
S0262	yeah
S0388	so
S0262	and and what and how when do that come about i mean through this tv programme so it's incredible isn't it how a tv programme can shape like the whole of brentwood now be about
S0388	yeah
S0262	you know this tv programme
S0388	yeah yeah
S0262	in a way
S0388	and a lot of them leave the show like mark wright he be like one of the original cast he's now a dj erm he's on strictly erm a couple of them do that dive they're do a lot of celebrity they've be in the celebrity house
S0262	yeah
S0388	they they go into that and some of them be still in the show but he's really move on now cos he's in strictly a dj and he's marry a coronation street actress next year
S0262	transform life
S0388	er yeah
S0262	and i guess
S0388	yeah
S0262	that's the appeal isn't it that's why people do want to do it
S0388	i would say he's the only one who's really make it
S0262	but you see he might've make it without that tv show
S0388	yeah cos he's get the good look
S0262	okay
S0388	he's get the
S0262	he would've make it probably
S0388	nice personality
S0262	it's just propel him a bite fast first
S0388	yeah yeah
S0262	and none of the others be quite
S0388	no they don't really make it
S0262	really
S0388	they haven't get quite that edge
S0262	no
S0388	to what he have that's why they're still in the show
S0262	ah they're still in the show so they're still in the show until they manage to somehow
S0388	well they go they go cos they want to find themselves
S0262	get their get their
S0388	and everything and then they come back because obviously they can't find themselves so they can't find any work
S0262	oh i see
S0388	so they come back to the show
S0262	right and the show just welcome them back in as a kind of like you know this ongoing character
S0388	character yeah
S0262	that just happen to come back in
S0388	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	but where's the steady flow of of people new ones
S0388	well because
S0262	be feed into it or
S0388	yes i think so yeah cos they all meet in the nightclubs they're all kind of
S0262	oh
S0388	a room of friends that
S0262	i see so you see them in the nightclubs on the tv show or something
S0388	well apparently yeah yeah they it's film there and apparently you do see them in their shop a lot of them be in their shop in brentwood yeah
S0262	it make me think of that erm er film call the truman show with er erm
S0388	oh yes yeah that's oh what's his name that
S0262	jim carrey jim carrey his name
S0388	that's it yeah
S0262	and that film be show years ago
S0388	that's yeah that's right
S0262	but it really make me think that if you be on these show in these show you be everything you're do be be watch
S0388	well they say for the only way be essex most of it be true but they set up scenarios that be for your entertainment
S0262	well yeah
S0388	so they're either the girls be usually at the beauty salon have their hair or nail do
S0388	there's er a chap who's gay so he's quite a character in it erm there's a big girl then there's you know one who dabble in sing but hasn't make sing her
S0262	oh no yeah
S0388	life and yeah it's an interest mix but it's compel i i love it
S0262	well it be in a way
S0388	awful really
S0262	it's well but part of it's compel because if you think about it it's base on theatre
S0388	yeah
S0262	as in all these different character
S0388	yes
S0262	put them all together see what happen
S0388	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	then we watch film which we see that happen then we see them in soap
S0388	yeah mm
S0262	eastenders whatnot
S0388	yeah
S0262	so really this be just move from that back to reality
S0388	yeah
S0262	cos apparently these people be real
S0388	yes yeah
S0262	and they be real
S0388	yeah but they're
S0262	but they've be erm what's the word they've be erm er it's artificial
S0388	yes
S0262	in the sense that
S0388	yeah
S0262	there's the fat one there's the gay one
S0388	yeah
S0262	there's the this one who doesn't know he's a you know this that the other and they're all put in together
S0388	yeah
S0262	that's a little artificial
S0388	yeah
S0262	for me cos i would say
S0388	they're all attractive and handsome
S0262	right
S0262	attractive handsome
S0388	that up there cos they have they've all have that they've get massive ones
S0262	oh for god's sake you see it just get more and artificial as it go on it really do
S0388	yeah it isn't until you start dig in it that you think er
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0388	the only way be way be essex but but you cannot not watch it it's a bite of relaxation and i just find it funny
S0262	you've get an interest
S0388	yeah and i know that pub
S0262	yes yeah yeah
S0388	oh look at that bite i like
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0388	but they're awful people their people
S0262	yeah absolutely
S0388	their language their and they're horrible
S0262	they swear a lot
S0388	yeah and they cause trouble some have be in prison drug
S0262	right
S0388	one be in drug he's suddenly out of the show
S0262	oh dear
S0388	he's be catch with cocaine
S0261	yeah so erm this like a little indian guy who's like super brain
S0401	yeah yeah
S0261	erm and there be er an african dad and his boy could play the violin like he be in an
S0401	yeah
S0261	orchestra and he be seven or something like that
S0401	yeah yeah yeah
S0261	that kind of thing so they kind of follow through this kind of experience of the kid be encourage to do stuff they're train stuff they and they would do
S0401	yeah
S0261	like four hours a day of their particular exercise
S0401	yeah
S0261	and and i think four out of five of them be heavily push by their parent and erm and then kind of the application process and interview and all of this kind of stuff
S0401	yeah
S0261	it's er very very very interest
S0401	yeah how many of them get in
S0261	i think just two and i think two get in one decide not to go
S0401	yeah
S0261	have be through the experience
S0401	yeah
S0261	and the other two be go to try again i think erm i think he be the one who choose not to
S0401	right
S0261	yeah i think he be really experience and good at all but he i think he be more aware that he want to do something more
S0401	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0261	yeah cos er they're only erm they're only push into
S0401	yeah
S0261	and if they never you know if they never reach this level
S0401	yeah
S0261	then then their whole world come down crash down around them
S0401	yeah
S0261	then they've gotta kind of rebuild from what they think be zero but they don't acknowledge that actually actually if they erm they do think though i do think that there be kind of an element of erm if you've if you've learn from this and you try to learn this extra information
S0401	yeah
S0261	then you can go up another level
S0401	yeah
S0261	but it depend on who yeah that's true
S0401	if you've already get that background it allow you to move up another level
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah erm but there's this big thing of how to waste a good deal with the concept of failure
S0401	yeah
S0261	and then in society failure be treat as failure
S0401	yeah
S0261	you're at the bottom of the heap you've fail not as a learn experience that's process
S0401	yeah
S0261	and that's what it be it's an experiment you find you need to change something and then you go and turn into
S0261	well there's of the way that they're erm they're they they they they're teach
S0401	yeah
S0261	if you go through school and you've get exam you're no longer the same as everybody else
S0401	no
S0261	but in fact you be the same as everybody else you're just
S0401	maybe
S0261	erm i'm very kind of interest in these like kind of alternative ways of education and there be a lot of new place that be try to be creative and they're outside of the box
S0401	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah try to challenge have to work within a curriculum
S0401	yeah yeah ofsted
S0261	yeah it's ridiculous
S0401	it be ridiculous
S0261	that's it i mean it's it's no different than erm can't think of the right word but it be so so straight lace and so down the line and so homogeneous
S0401	yeah
S0261	that it no longer no longer appreciate as as be er very different and individual
S0261	yeah
S0261	yeah sorry
S0401	it's where the children in the country live
S0261	okay
S0261	yeah well this be education er
S0401	yeah
S0261	montessori education erm
S0401	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0261	but that cost them a lot of money
S0401	yeah yeah yeah
S0261	and they i mean they're they're set up as they're kind of foundation business
S0401	yeah
S0261	or a franchise or whatever it be erm cos it's business interest but there be other others that be more open
