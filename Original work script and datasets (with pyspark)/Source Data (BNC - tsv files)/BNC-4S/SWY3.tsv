S0545	so and that's call a what a
S0392	a cajón
S0545	a cajón
S0392	they use to the african slave in south america use to erm want to play drum rhythms that they would do at home so they would use er fish box and fruit box they be load
S0545	right
S0392	that way they could disguise it so that people didn't realise they be have fun so to speak
S0545	oh okay right
S0392	and erm they could also use things that they all readily have as well
S0391	so they reckon it
S0392	and then
S0391	start in peru on the fish
S0392	yeah
S0391	er port
S0545	oh okay
S0391	you know where the
S0545	yeah
S0391	slave be in peru and just disguise their erm african drum

S0545	gosh
S0392	a popular local instrument as well
S0545	mm
S0391	yeah put a snare in
S0545	it's quite erm i mean it's quite a rich sound isn't it
S0391	yeah and
S0545	not

S0391	you should take it again
S0545	have you only take it once
S0392	yeah only once
S0545	oh okay
S0391	and it be so good the sound be really good
S0545	cos i could see on the peruvian gloria for instance
S0391	yeah
S0392	yeah
S0545	it'd be good in that
S0391	yeah
S0392	the congregation be a bite slow in sing back though they er they sort of halve the pace so we have to keep play slowly when they sing
S0391	yeah
S0392	and then quicker for
S0545	ah yeah oh
S0392	the worst thing i could've do be just to keep go at the same rhythm
S0545	oh okay
S0392	but i have to be i have to be heuristic
S0545	that's the that's the problem yeah
S0392	yeah
S0545	it need a strong canter then maybe just to them
S0392	yeah well it's
S0545	be it
S0392	yeah
S0545	be it oh well
S0392	yeah and he be a bite nervous so he start really high pitch
S0545	oh
S0392	so it be glory to god
S0545	oh okay right
S0392	and they be quite slow but still
S0545	i know it use to be quite common that er
S0392	yeah
S0545	sing in place
S0392	i like it
S0545	but i've never hear it in say our local parish they never sing
S0392	no
S0545	anything like that i like it too
S0392	it's a great instrument though cos you can pack it up and take it wherever you want
S0545	well i can see that
S0392	it's popular with buskers or tour musicians
S0545	yeah
S0392	you just have to zip it back up again and then take it with you
S0545	no it's good you get your own seat
S0392	yeah i know i i couldn't decide which one to get er there be some handmade ones up in the northeast but erm these ones be make in either spain by an italian company or italy by a spanish company

S0392	as oppose to a brown one
S0545	the colour change
S0392	yeah the colour green
S0545	really
S0392	green paint rather than brown cos brown's a premium one so they can charge fifty quid more for it
S0545	gosh
S0392	but quite like the green one
S0545	and what what what make it premium
S0392	just cos it look like wood so people want it i suppose
