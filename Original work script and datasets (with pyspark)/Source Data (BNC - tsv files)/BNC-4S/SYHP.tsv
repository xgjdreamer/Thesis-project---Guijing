S0262	yeah
S0361	the the whole of last year write a bloom dissertation
S0262	yeah
S0262	yeah yeah
S0361	so you you you end up under just pile of paper and
S0262	yeah
S0361	what you want be the the the the the thing to stand up in a corner
S0262	yeah
S0361	next to your monitor otherwise it's just gonna get lose
S0262	yeah that's so true
S0361	so yes
S0262	i reckon you could probably lie in bed and just sort of about you know rest it there
S0360	yeah
S0361	well
S0360	yeah
S0361	i could if i have to
S0262	you know you could have your little cup of
S0361	come and sit there
S0262	there you go
S0261	there you go
S0262	though you could have your cup of cocoa and you would have one hand free cos i find
S0360	yes
S0262	when i'm read in bed with the ipad er and then it start go
S0360	and then yeah and then you have to
S0262	on me and if i move
S0360	turn the page and you er everything's in come to a stop oh
S0262	and it
S0361	yeah
S0262	should be there a way of stop it from do that you know if you're lie down and you you go to get some water
S0361	and it
S0262	and you go that way and go
S0361	it doesn't automatic erm
S0262	it doesn't
S0361	depend on which app you're use erm
S0262	kindle
S0361	if you're use the kindle app for android erm when you hold it er you'll find there's a little lock icon that appear in the corner if you
S0262	oh
S0361	hit that it will lock it to whichever orientation you be currently use
S0262	oh brilliant
S0261	you can do it erm the same on your ipad
S0361	erm
S0261	and you just have to go on the settings
S0361	yeah i imagine
S0262	okay
S0361	the kindle app
S0262	yeah
S0361	for for ipad do it as well
S0262	yeah
S0261	and just
S0262	but erm
S0261	you need to go to settings
S0361	yeah
S0262	okay
S0361	erm it's
S0262	that's it
S0361	erm yes absolutely
S0262	yeah
S0361	and there be also there there should also be a a a mm a a an option somewhere in the menu that will allow you to do that for the whole thing so
S0262	okay
S0361	it doesn't auto rotate at all
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0361	erm which can be useful if er er and as you say if you if if you're on a bus or something
S0262	yeah
S0361	and it's just move
S0262	yeah that's right get quite seasick
S0361	yes
S0262	and it's like
S0361	absolutely
S0262	excellent
S0361	so yes
S0262	right let me just check this be record okay erm
S0360	which country have most influence my language or or oh i get
S0361	britain
S0360	well yes that's
S0261	how many years have you live in britain
S0360	erm
S0361	many
S0262	yeah
S0360	erm
S0261	half your life
S0360	fifty
S0261	yeah
S0360	fifty years
S0261	okay
S0361	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	the second half
S0360	yeah well er less than if you take out the the years i've live here
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah
S0360	because
S0262	fifty years
S0360	i move there
S0262	yeah
S0360	when i be eighteen
S0262	yeah yeah
S0360	mm
S0261	the so
S0360	so
S0262	yeah so
S0360	i move there
S0262	it's a big big influence
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0360	the most yeah
S0262	yeah massive
S0360	but they do say that the the the the the most formative years of your speech and language development and the accent you adopt be to five years
S0261	mm
S0360	or seven
S0361	seven
S0262	be
S0360	seven
S0262	be that oh
S0361	yes
S0360	yes
S0361	you form most of your vowel sound by the time you're seven
S0360	yeah
S0361	erm and particularly for men they never lose them
S0360	yes
S0361	women because they if they move into different communities will speak more with people outside their community
S0262	right
S0361	erm will often lose their their their local accent
S0262	yes
S0361	and only pick them up
S0262	that's what's happen to me yeah
S0361	yes
S0360	yes
S0262	my vowel sound
S0360	well women
S0262	that australian accent
S0360	women tend to be copycats anyway
S0262	yes
S0360	so you
S0361	yes
S0360	imitate they they imitate
S0361	and
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0361	absolutely and erm so because it's it's all it's predominantly about vowel sound
S0262	right yeah yeah yeah
S0361	to get the accent
S0262	yeah
S0361	erm you you find that er women will will blend in
S0262	mm
S0361	whereas men will will stay
S0262	will stand out
S0361	stand out much longer
S0262	yeah
S0361	certainly
S0262	yeah yeah
S0361	erm
S0262	that's interest
S0361	it be
S0262	yeah
S0361	isn't it i mean
S0262	yeah
S0361	and of course it's it's also the there's a very the the gender be predominantly because men will be with one particular community because they'll go to work
S0262	mm
S0361	whereas women will have to be will generally in the past be talk to a lot more people
S0262	yeah
S0361	because they're go into the community they're do shop
S0262	shop
S0361	they're look after kid
S0262	childcare
S0361	they're do
S0262	yeah that's it
S0361	all of that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0361	and so i think er it'll be interest to see as those roles change whether that change the way that
S0262	true with men
S0361	erm with people accent
S0262	if those males' vowels will change
S0361	yeah
S0262	or whether they can imitate yeah that's interest
S0361	so yes
S0262	yeah
S0361	mm
S0262	yeah
S0261	wow
S0361	so you've just hit another one of these random little things that i have a small
S0261	and you just
S0361	amount of
S0361	knowledge about
S0261	i know yeah it's
S0262	no that's great that's great
S0261	that you pick up tonight
S0262	because i mean i
S0360	i i often say to her be there anything you don't know
S0360	anything about
S0360	ah because you will answer or somebody will say something and she can come out with this and i'm think oh my god
S0360	yes right okay
S0361	it's one of the things about be a geek
S0361	you go you you're you're passionate about stuff
S0262	yeah
S0361	and so anything that that remotely tickle your interest you'll go and read about
S0262	yeah yeah
S0360	mm
S0261	mm
S0361	and
S0262	yeah exactly
S0361	we tend to also have good retention
S0262	yeah
S0361	so that yes when people
S0262	yeah
S0361	then mention
S0262	to see
S0361	it
S0262	for you to remember
S0361	you can you can blurt
S0361	all kinds of stuff and so one of the things
S0262	blurt and splurt
S0360	yeah
S0361	one of the things i very much have to do be be actually concentrate and make sure that when i start i i'm i'm i i i make sure that people be go mm
S0361	because
S0360	yeah
S0361	they don't always notice the social cue of people say shut up shut up you're go on
S0361	oh okay yes sorry
S0360	yeah
S0261	you know we be talk about brevity before
S0360	yes

S0361	i can do brevity when tell a story but
S0360	yes

S0262	so
S0261	excite about

S0262	mother like er
S0360	the thing be erm
S0262	new zealand
S0360	er so much of the sort of sociology and all er all that sort of stuff tend to er er go back to your father but particularly for women
S0262	right
S0360	it always fall back to the male
S0262	okay
S0360	erm it's for example er it be when i be work with erm a very large but vary erm asian community in the uk i discover the difference so so hindi and erm er blah blah blah blah er all these different people
S0262	yeah
S0360	you discover little differences that mark them out
S0262	right
S0360	and i can't remember which particular erm sect or want of a better word it it be but the women you you you you would be do their record thing right you're do data thing collection and the woman would say her name be whatever cors but her husband be something patel and i'm probably get that totally wrong
S0262	right
S0360	in term of ethnicity
S0261	mm
S0360	and whatever erm and you're think well you're marry to each other why aren't you mrs
S0262	yeah

S0262	right
S0360	she doesn't change to her husband's name
S0262	interest
S0360	which be

S0360	so you have all these mrs cors when
S0262	yeah
S0360	their mrs patel
S0262	yes
S0360	or whatever
S0262	yeah yeah yeah there's something like that in vietnam i remember we ask quite a lot of
S0261	mm
S0262	question
S0360	yeah
S0262	when we be travel in vietnam and there be something really specific about that
S0360	yeah
S0262	that it's actually up a paternal line
S0360	that's right
S0262	that er
S0360	yeah
S0262	they're interest in keep that
S0360	yeah
S0262	sort of thread alive
S0360	mm see that polish
S0262	so
S0360	polish er people when they get marry the woman become
S0262	yes
S0360	and the man remain
S0361	yes
S0361	erm you get
S0360	the man be
S0361	you you get
S0261	mm
S0361	the the the patronymic thing
S0360	yeah
S0361	erm in eastern european and and
S0262	yeah
S0361	towards

S0360	and the the other thing because britain own the world er they think that britain still own the world and i be british you know so you shouldn't be treat me like this
S0262	i understand now
S0261	yes
S0262	the gap
S0262	that for me have get less because
S0360	yeah
S0262	from live in australia
S0360	yeah
S0262	i go in with those set of eye as well
S0360	yeah
S0262	think it might be interest to look at er permanent residency and then from pr you secure australian citizenship i wasn't sure about go all the way into australian citizenship but i certainly think
S0360	yeah
S0262	gain pr would be
S0360	yeah yeah
S0262	useful and then of course you meet all these different people and they're try to go to the uk to do whatever they want and then you're have these discussions about just how difficult it be both side
S0360	yes
S0361	yeah
S0262	for different reason
S0360	yeah
S0262	really hard
S0360	yeah
S0262	really expensive and no guarantee
S0360	yeah
S0262	at the end so i see that the gap really for me personally have lessen because
S0360	right
S0262	of that because i now
S0360	yeah
S0262	see even now get this job at
S0261	mm
S0262	of course you need to get residency
S0360	yeah
S0262	of course you need a work permit these be all things i've grow
S0360	yeah
S0262	quite a accustom to now
S0360	yeah yes
S0262	you turn up and somebody go okay we'll have to sponsor you we now you have to fill out these form now fill out this and
S0261	mm
S0262	pay for this
S0360	mm
S0262	pay for that but it's good he's gonna get residency through me
S0360	ah right
S0262	as well which be really helpful
S0360	yeah yeah
S0361	yes
S0262	you know cos then you don't have to worry so much
S0360	yes
S0361	no absolutely
S0360	yeah
S0262	about him so
S0360	yeah yeah
S0262	and he can get the social security
S0360	oh right yes yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	through through this
S0360	yeah through it through from your work yeah
S0361	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0262	cos these be the things that people who never leave their country
S0360	absolutely
S0262	or even
S0361	and that's how
S0262	their town
S0360	absolutely
S0262	or village
S0261	they don't know all this
S0262	they'd never
S0261	mm
S0360	yes yes
S0361	for for all there be the anti european sentiment in the uk
S0262	mm
S0361	people forget what they gain from europe
S0262	mm
S0360	entry
S0361	the fact that they can go and live
S0360	uhu
S0361	without
S0262	yeah
S0361	anything you go you turn up you tell the police that you're stay
S0262	yeah
S0361	two weeks after you arrive
S0262	yeah
S0361	and you can stay indefinitely
S0262	that's true yes
S0361	in any
S0361	in in any country
S0261	eu country
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	yeah
S0262	you have to jump through
S0261	mm
S0262	a few hoop but it's
S0361	mm
S0262	guarantee that you will be
S0361	yeah
S0262	allow to
S0360	yeah
S0262	do it you know you have to fill out
S0361	unless
S0262	some form
S0361	you be massively unpleasant
S0262	yeah
S0361	then it's unlikely that they're gonna
S0361	kick you
S0262	that's right
S0361	back out
S0262	yeah
S0361	again
S0262	unless you're like the taliban or something
S0262	it's not happen
S0261	yeah it it's incredible how short term people's
S0361	yes
S0261	think be
S0360	yes yeah
S0261	erm i'm just do this course on online at the moment through er mit it's just one of those free
S0361	mm
S0360	yes
S0261	er online course and it's erm about a new generation of er of think and er let's say discover new ways of think to solve world problems and things
S0360	oh right
S0261	so it's about change
S0360	yeah yeah yeah
S0261	make and leadership and that kind of
S0360	yeah
S0261	stuff and the erm the people who run it have be research this stuff for nearly twenty thirty years or something and they set up a particular laboratory at mit and er mass and mass of data so they're present this stuff they've write their own book and they share some of their their book i start read it yesterday and one of the guy be german another guy be american and they erm he start off highlight this context of of europe versus er america
S0360	uhu
S0261	and talk through er various cycle of experience that we repeatedly go through
S0361	uhu
S0261	so we know that you know there be a a financial crisis and back in the nineteen twenties
S0360	uhu
S0261	and thirties and stuff
S0360	uhu
S0261	and yet here we be nearly a hundred years later do exactly the same
S0360	the same thing
S0261	thing
S0361	oh yes yeah
S0261	yeah and he highlight many different examples of these type of situations where in society we continue to make the same mistake and don't learn
S0360	yeah
S0261	from them
S0360	yes
S0261	not on an not on a small scale but it's when it get to a large
S0360	yes yes
S0261	scale
S0361	oh yeah
S0360	yes
S0261	that's when these problems come about
S0360	yeah
S0261	that we can operate to some certain degree as a group or as a a
S0360	mm
S0261	a small team or
S0360	mm
S0261	something or even a large corporation
S0360	mm
S0261	but take it to a larger scale it fail
S0360	yeah
S0261	we just cannot
S0360	yeah
S0261	get to a
S0262	learn
S0261	point
S0360	yeah
S0261	where we learn
S0262	mm
S0261	so he erm draw out some facts and figure and he identify that although people think america have the largest economy if you look at europe europe's economy be bigger than america's
S0361	yes
S0261	and it be the biggest in the world a slightly different population
S0361	right
S0261	but the concept of it's a similar land mass lot of people
S0360	uhu uhu uhu
S0261	on in the western hemisphere kind of thing that that's the scale of it and erm i just find it interest that he he your point about the eu and how it get form and the intention of it and erm and how in its beginnings it the intention be that it be to try and bring the people together
S0361	yes
S0360	mm
S0261	and to solve great problems together
S0361	particularly
S0360	uhu
S0261	as a community
S0360	uhu
S0361	have have two world war
S0360	uhu
S0261	post post war
S0262	yeah
S0261	and all of this
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	kind of thing
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0361	which be
S0261	and he
S0361	predominantly centre in europe
S0261	and he and he pick on germany as an example probably cos he's german
S0360	yeah
S0261	and he understand the background and erm then he come to the kind of contemporary situation where we be where europe's still in some financial crisis and that germany rather than have start up off with this you know all the dialogue be about a group kind of consensus
S0361	uhu
S0261	they decide that rather than europe work out the financial crisis that each individual country would be responsible for their own financial problems
S0360	mm
S0361	yes it's
S0261	so they so they so they
S0361	actually
S0262	yes
S0261	that that it be kind of like the pull the supportive rug out from underneath everybody
S0361	uhu uhu
S0261	and say you're all gonna have to work this out individually so now we've get thirty or forty different communities try to join together and work out what to do
S0360	mm
S0261	or not join together
S0360	yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	and all work in their own individual way
S0360	mm
S0261	whereas the european union be
S0262	the ideology
S0360	yeah
S0261	the
S0262	yeah
S0261	ideology
S0262	yeah
S0261	be be be to look at at the bigger picture and
S0360	yeah
S0261	how can we crack this nut
S0262	mm
S0261	and move on
S0361	but i think it's
S0261	with a new way
S0360	mm
S0262	mm
S0361	yeah i think it's very interest that that's happen at this time because it highlight the fact that when there be financial crises one of the things that tend to happen be a rise in nationalism
S0262	true
S0261	yes
S0262	uhu
S0261	mm uhu
S0361	erm and a and a move to the right within politics
S0261	mm mm
S0262	mm mm
S0361	erm and what be we see if not a move to the right within politics
S0262	yes
S0361	and er er
S0262	it's sort of
S0361	a fairly the major
S0262	off the the the scale in term of it's certainly
S0261	mm mm
S0361	well certainly within for erm for
S0262	sort of unprecedented
S0361	for european
S0262	yeah yeah
S0361	politics
S0262	yeah
S0361	the the move to the right be
S0262	mm
S0361	quite significant
S0262	mm
S0361	we're still fairly leave as far as the americans be concern
S0262	yes true
S0361	but erm yeah i mean it it's be very interest
S0262	mm
S0361	to watch it from er with with er an academic eye
S0262	yeah
S0361	erm
S0262	yeah well
S0361	also for to look at one's bank account and
S0361	go oh
S0360	yeah
S0361	but erm yeah
S0262	mm
S0361	it's er er there there's a lot of very interest stuff go on there and and
S0261	mm
S0360	and i think it's nice now that because we have these things like the the online
S0361	forums and stuff where people can actually go and and look
S0262	mm
S0361	you can
S0262	you can learn
S0361	you can er and
S0262	yeah
S0361	more people be
S0262	it's true
S0361	understand why these things be happen
S0262	mm mm
S0361	but erm something i saw fantastically on facebook yesterday the the the the ukip those
S0262	oh yeah
S0361	marvellous bunch of people
S0262	ukip yeah
S0361	put out an advert to remind expats
S0262	right
S0361	that they should register to vote
S0262	okay
S0361	for the ukip
S0262	i know
S0361	so these be people who have specifically take advantage of all of the things that the ukip would like to erm dissolve
S0262	yeah
S0361	but they should definitely vote for the ukip because
S0262	it's ridiculous
S0361	and and
S0262	isn't it
S0361	there be a there be a survey er do end of november last year that show that something like sixty percent of people believe that it be a right for british people erm to emigrate to be able to go to other countries
S0262	right
S0360	yes well this be
S0361	but
S0360	this yeah
S0262	sixty percent that's high
S0360	yeah
S0361	which be great and lovely and
S0262	yeah
S0361	and
S0262	yeah
S0361	i like the fact that they accept they acknowledge something that be part of the un human right charter that we have the that that everyone should have the ability to move freely around the world
S0262	uhu
S0361	unfortunately erm only thirty percent these be rough number of people er think that it be a right for other people to come to the
S0360	to britain
S0361	uk
S0360	yeah how do that work
S0360	that that that
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0361	which be
S0261	yeah
S0361	just
S0261	mm
S0361	that wonderful double standard of
S0361	i'm british and i
S0262	yeah
S0360	can do things
S0262	yeah
S0360	yes
S0361	but if you're not
S0360	yes
S0361	british and therefore
S0360	yeah
S0361	you can't do things
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0360	yes
S0361	erm so yes i er
S0262	but i'd be interest to know what you think about that because at the time that you come into er when when you come to the uk
S0360	mm
S0262	you know
S0360	yeah
S0262	to set your life up i guess also
S0360	mm
S0262	that what be the feel then and how much it's change
S0360	it it er
S0262	you know
S0360	right okay
S0262	with the european union
S0360	i
S0262	change
S0360	when i i decide i want to come to the uk to study nurse erm and er so i write to the hospital in i i think i only write to that one specific hospital because i have some erm distant remove relations live in that in in
S0262	right
S0360	who i'd never meet didn't know they be sort of on my my mother's paternal er my maternal erm sort of
S0262	okay
S0360	side from a different island
S0262	okay
S0360	in the caribbean
S0262	yeah
S0360	and there so i write to this hospital cos they give me the address and one thing and another and erm i don't know how i i i really can't remember now how the interaction take place erm between the hospital and trinidad
S0262	right
S0360	but then i be call for an interview in trinidad
S0262	right
S0360	so i go
S0262	cool
S0360	for an interview in trinidad and i can't remember there be nobody there represent the hospital
S0262	right
S0360	it be it it be and i know this be my memory which be really flaw to be quite honest and i have this interview and er and i be accept at the interview you didn't have to sign anything but it it be sort of take for grant that after your three years of train you if they allow you to go to do this train
S0262	right okay
S0360	you would return to work in the country
S0262	right okay
S0360	you didn't have to sign your life away to say
S0262	right
S0360	yes you would but
S0262	yeah
S0360	it it be sort of erm implicit
S0262	right
S0360	implicit yes
S0361	yes
S0360	so erm time come and i hear that i'd be accept to do my train at general hospital cos this be in the days when each hospital erm er put out their advertisements and garner their their students in
S0262	mm
S0360	for themselves it wasn't erm with project and
S0361	it be some
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0361	yeah
S0360	yeah and erm so off i go to the uk erm er to and i be greatly receive by matron there
S0262	uhu
S0360	erm she be very she actually be very erm maternalistic
S0262	right
S0360	towards her foreign students
S0262	okay yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	she be a really
S0262	that's nice
S0360	really i think she'd be in the war and erm
S0361	as so many nurse have
S0360	so she have a
S0262	yeah
S0360	sorry
S0361	as so many nurse have
S0360	yes and she
S0261	mm
S0360	have she have a much broader open mind
S0361	uhu uhu
S0360	erm and i really enjoy every year i remember they would er they would ask me for my passport which they then obviously send away to extend my stay
S0262	right
S0360	and at the end of three my three years they call for my passport and erm when it be return to me they say to me i now have citizenship
S0262	wow
S0360	they didn't ask me if i
S0262	they just
S0360	want it they didn't
S0262	they just give it to you
S0360	they they i
S0262	yeah
S0360	be just give
S0262	yeah
S0360	citizenship the right to stay in the uk
S0262	oh lovely
S0360	as long as
S0262	yeah
S0360	i want
S0262	yeah wow
S0360	and i think oh oh
S0360	this be nice
S0361	do you do you mean citizenship or do you mean indefinitely to stay because they're not the same thing i think you get you actually get
S0360	ah yes in
S0261	citizenship later
S0360	yeah yeah yeah er yes it probably would be
S0361	so you get
S0360	yeah
S0361	indefinitely to stay
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm mm
S0261	which again
S0262	yeah
S0360	be deeply difficult to
S0262	it yes
S0261	obtain
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah exactly
S0262	yeah that's so true
S0360	so i didn't have to from that day forward i never have to keep send my passport to
S0262	mm
S0361	to have it or or go wherever you go because i didn't know whether and then have to
S0262	yeah
S0360	find out
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah and erm and i say stay there the it be a couple of more years work there and then start move around the country
S0262	yeah
S0360	erm
S0262	yeah
S0360	quite freely
S0262	yeah
S0360	so i wasn't tie to that hospital anymore erm er which be sort of in a way a little bite similar when you get a work permit here for a place you
S0262	true
S0360	stay there and
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0262	it's
S0360	yeah
S0262	your sponsor
S0360	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0361	uhu
S0262	that's
S0360	erm yes that's exactly
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah right
S0361	yeah which be fairly standard around the world
S0360	oh right okay
S0361	with work permit they be to or for
S0360	yeah
S0261	cos they're
S0361	a particular
S0261	attach
S0360	yeah
S0261	they're for a purpose
S0262	mm
S0360	oh right yeah
S0262	you have to be careful
S0360	yeah
S0262	of that
S0361	so it's
S0262	to keep
S0262	to try and move somewhere else
S0360	yes
S0261	mm
S0262	or another company or something
S0360	yeah so erm
S0261	but you you you arrive in the mid sixties when there be the influx of people from the caribbean
S0262	mm
S0361	anyway
S0360	uhu
S0361	so erm there be obviously er an amount of of of backlash towards that that's it's something that they now teach in in in erm gcse history course
S0262	yeah
S0360	interest
S0361	the backlash to the windrush
S0360	yes
S0262	yeah
S0361	erm but how do you find be a black person
S0360	well that wasn't what i be go to come on to say because i have say throughout my life i have never ever face er racism
S0262	mm
S0360	nobody have be be face to face erm treat me with any er racial you know erm whatsit so personally i have never ever funnily i go i will say this i will go back and say this the racism that i experience be from other people from the caribbean
S0262	right
S0360	because the caribbean be the most racist bloody unit of islands in the world
S0262	be it i didn't know that
S0360	absolutely
S0262	i do not know that
S0360	you mark my word and it's
S0361	cos they all come from different part
S0360	of africa
S0262	ah
S0361	of africa
S0360	yeah
S0262	so there's a real peck order
S0361	and all it's all very
S0360	yes
S0361	very insular
S0262	right okay
S0361	so there be very er yeah there's very much a peck order amongst the islands
S0262	uhu
S0361	t and t have oil so be a much richer island
S0262	oh
S0361	than many of the others
S0262	right
S0361	and so you you get a whole bunch of things
S0262	ah
S0361	but also as you see in other erm non white communities there's the racism between
S0262	yeah
S0361	i'm very black you're not so black
S0360	er yes i be come to that
S0262	yeah
S0361	erm
S0360	yeah
S0361	which have be encourage i i read a lovely article about erm south america
S0262	uhu
S0361	the spanish encourage that level of racism
S0262	oh
S0361	erm that that whiter that whiter be better
S0262	yeah
S0361	from the sixteenth century
S0261	mm
S0361	when they first go over

S0361	when they first start mingle with the the natives if you be a mulatto if you be whiter you you you be a
S0262	you be
S0361	a higher status
S0262	and if you be gonna get
S0361	than if you be darker

S0360	so er
S0361	but you didn't get so much that that that thing that again i read a lot of article i have a lot of time on my hand so erm
S0361	the idea that you be you you be the the the representative of i'm not racist i have a black friend
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah yeah yeah
S0361	you didn't get that
S0360	no
S0361	so much from them

S0361	because as as much as anything you because you arrive so young you be able to settle into the er and you you become a professional
S0360	uhu
S0361	erm
S0262	yeah
S0361	you settle into a a that middle class white milieu without you weren't black
S0360	mm
S0361	so much it it didn't matter erm it's something er that i i be write about earlier er erm but while i'm mix race i pass as white in term of
S0262	yeah
S0361	my
S0262	okay
S0361	my facial feature
S0262	yeah
S0361	the fact that i i i'm basically pink
S0262	yeah
S0361	erm and so i've not have and because i i've grow up in a middle class white environment i've be socialise as white
S0262	yes yeah
S0361	so i don't have that connection to erm any of that side of my my my er my background
S0262	yeah
S0361	and so it can it it it's actually quite difficult
S0262	yeah
S0361	because
S0262	i can
S0361	i have
S0262	imagine it would be
S0361	i have no
S0262	confuse
S0361	i really do have no connection which mean that
S0262	yeah
S0361	when i'm in when i'm in the caribbean i'm another foreigner just like everybody
S0262	yeah
S0361	er er like any other
S0262	yeah
S0361	white
S0261	mm
S0361	person and so i it's
S0261	so you would have to actively work to create that connection
S0361	yeah i would
S0261	either with er through some
S0361	yeah
S0261	project
S0262	family or
S0261	to actually go out and meet and
S0361	yeah
S0261	talk to
S0360	yeah
S0261	people say within
S0360	yeah
S0261	the local community in
S0361	and at that point
S0261	in britain or
S0361	you start be a bite sort of well
S0360	yeah yeah
S0361	i i i'm solicit
S0360	yeah
S0361	black friends
S0361	that's not what i'm do that that's
S0262	yeah that's absolutely
S0262	i'm like white racists
S0361	a bite icky and all
S0261	yeah
S0361	and colonial
S0262	i now want a black
S0360	yeah
S0262	friend
S0261	but there it's the kind of
S0262	but i'm black you know yeah
S0261	if you want to
S0261	if you want to er assimilate with a culture you need to get in with the culture and go and meet people
S0361	yeah
S0261	and things like that and it's the same thing live in a place like this that if you want to get to understand how the system work it help to know how the locals go about it
S0360	yeah
S0361	yes
S0360	yeah yeah
S0361	absolutely
S0261	er
S0361	absolutely
S0261	so
S0361	and i mean i in some respect i i i have the privilege of erm if i do go to the west indies as least i'm not try to do it through a language barrier
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	whereas when when you come here you have at least to get some level of of of local language
S0261	mm mm
S0361	so at least you if if you're both do pidgin in each other's language
S0262	yeah
S0361	you're gonna at least
S0360	yeah you can
S0361	get somewhere
S0262	yeah
S0261	make some
S0262	yeah
S0261	some communication
S0262	yeah
S0361	but erm yeah
S0261	mm
S0361	i mean it's
S0261	wow
S0361	it be very interest
S0360	yeah
S0361	erm
S0360	the the the the that i erm until i go back to the caribbean in twenty ten i hadn't be back for twenty eight years
S0262	right be gonna ask you
S0261	incredible
S0262	that's a long time
S0261	long time yeah
S0360	and one of the reason be nothing to do with my family because we communicate i speak my sister would ring me with on the phone not skype six hours we would be talk
S0262	wow
S0360	on the phone and she
S0360	and then sometimes she's ring her and talk to her for an hour oh my god
S0360	so it be nothing
S0262	big phone bill
S0360	about the family
S0262	yeah
S0360	but there be incidents on previous visit that i have erm that that really just i i decide you know no i can't be do with this and er a couple of them be for example erm my husband and i my husband be english british we go to the the the the bank and erm while i be say whatever it be i want the girl be totally ignore me
S0262	oh
S0360	he speak and it be like she could lick the grind
S0262	oh okay
S0360	and i think what excuse me
S0262	mm
S0361	and that's a combination of race and gender it's
S0360	yes
S0361	it's it's quite a nice intersectional one actually it's it's
S0262	mm
S0361	erm and also the fact that you you don't have the local accent you don't have the local so you're clearly an incomer
S0360	mm
S0262	mm
S0360	er
S0262	mm
S0360	er my sister even within my family i be now treat as a foreigner
S0262	right
S0360	yes erm
S0262	wow
S0360	they and they
S0262	that must be so
S0360	verbally say that
S0262	strange
S0360	they verbally say that
S0262	that they feel that way
S0360	erm so there be er the outside element of that
S0262	mm
S0360	go on erm er and then there be an example i be erm er pregnant when i go the when the
S0361	one time
S0360	with yeah
S0360	and my husband and i go off to the beach one day and erm near the beach be this big hotel erm so we decide to have lunch at the hotel and as we be walk up to the hotel there be a blackboard which say fish and chip
S0262	mm
S0360	meal of the day
S0262	mm
S0261	mm
S0360	and this be be gonna be thirty nine this year so this be that long ago
S0262	okay
S0261	uhu
S0360	and i look at this blackboard and i say to oh my god don't tell me the british have bring fish and chip
S0360	bloody
S0261	would you believe it
S0360	i can't believe it
S0360	i cannot believe it
S0360	so we get into the restaurant and we sit down and the waiter come and he say to us erm i say to him what be the fish with the chip and he look at me and i say what fish be you serve with the chip
S0262	mm
S0360	and he continue to look at me so i start to name some of the local fish i say be it this this this and his eye be pop out of his head by now
S0360	and he say how you know the name of these fish so i say my dear boy i be bear on this island
S0360	i grow up here i live here long before you be a twinkle in your mother's eye
S0360	or your father's eye
S0360	so what be the name of the fish you be serve with the bloody chip
S0361	that be
S0261	so you be hand it out to this local lad
S0360	yeah
S0262	because but you sense that he'd already make some judgements about
S0360	yes
S0262	about you
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0360	judgment number two follow
S0262	yeah
S0360	or number
S0261	mm
S0360	whatever
S0262	yeah
S0360	follow by the the next question be who be your family
S0262	oh
S0261	yeah right there you go
S0262	okay
S0261	so what stand be be be you on
S0360	which be very like here
S0361	oh it's you very much
S0360	i think you into this place because it's so so so remind me like
S0262	wow
S0360	you know
S0262	yeah
S0360	the frustrations
S0361	well yeah
S0360	i just let them
S0361	the village
S0261	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0361	three hundred thousand people spread across
S0261	mm
S0361	the island but it's a village
S0360	yeah
S0361	everybody's relate to each other doesn't matter how far you go
S0361	along the tree i mean it's a village
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0361	and so it work if you treat it like a village you understand
S0262	yeah
S0361	how it how things work
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0361	yes if you say something in that ear it's go to end up in that ear very quickly
S0360	yeah
S0261	yes
S0361	and get back to you
S0261	mm
S0361	erm and so yeah it's
S0262	yeah
S0360	so i tell him who my father be and he say oh and like here they call you miss miss and your first name or mrs and your first name
S0262	right
S0360	rather than
S0261	mm
S0360	your title
S0261	mm
S0360	so he say oh miss your sister i say that would be correct
S0360	well everything change
S0262	oh right
S0360	everything
S0360	change
S0361	mm
S0360	and that be a big eye opener for me
S0262	mm
S0360	you know this the because it there i be on the one in the one few minutes before be treat as a foreigner
S0361	yeah as a tourist
S0360	a as as a tourist
S0262	yeah
S0360	erm but a tourist with well how how do you acquire this knowledge
S0361	mm
S0360	type of thing
S0261	mm
S0360	and ah yeah yeah yeah you might be tourist but you're connect to the island through
S0361	mm
S0360	this pathway
S0262	mm
S0360	er so oh god
S0262	yeah
S0360	so there be that and there be a lot of other things that just make me feel unwelcome
S0262	mm
S0360	i felt like a stranger in well what
S0261	a stranger in a yeah
S0360	i call my own country
S0261	yeah well
S0262	in your own home
S0261	what become a strange land
S0360	yes i have become
S0261	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	erm i decide i can't be do with this because i shall be rude to people i shall be all sort of things
S0262	mm
S0360	which would sort of make my father very angry with me because
S0262	yeah
S0361	and it would reflect back on the family
S0360	yeah yeah
S0262	go back on the family
S0261	yeah mm
S0361	do you know that your daughter be the
S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	oh my
S0261	yeah
S0360	god
S0262	argue about which fish go
S0261	with the
S0262	with the chip
S0261	yeah
S0360	yeah
S0261	and she give that lad what for you know
S0360	ah
S0262	she should just be happy to have
S0262	any fish
S0360	so er i decide to well it be not just that but it the whole life you know it be so expensive to travel to the caribbean then
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	erm when you could take two weeks holiday in france
S0261	anywhere in europe
S0360	spain anywhere
S0262	yeah
S0360	in europe
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	for half the money or
S0262	yeah
S0360	a third of the money
S0262	yeah sure
S0360	you know erm plus then add to that be the fact that if you be go that far two weeks in those days two weeks no you
S0261	mm
S0360	because there be no direct flight
S0262	yeah
S0360	so it be i use to take my whole year's holiday
S0262	wow
S0360	six weeks' holiday
S0261	at that time
S0360	to go
S0262	yeah
S0360	and the hospital would only allow you to do that once every sort of five years
S0262	mm
S0360	because they er i mean again go back to this matron she be very tune in to the health and wellbeing of her her er well her staff really
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	very good yeah
S0360	and whilst she appreciate the family connection and keep the family connection and stuff like that she felt that when you take all your holiday in one chunk like that then you have the whole rest of the year where you have no break
S0262	it's true
S0261	mm mm
S0360	and you could you're you're you then become subset susceptible to fall ill
S0262	yeah
S0360	etcetera etcetera because you become over tire to make mistake even
S0262	yeah
S0360	so all the all the sort of things that that entail so they wouldn't allow you to do it too regularly
S0262	right sure
S0360	so that that also put a on the whole thing and
S0262	yeah
S0360	and gradually you you keep think well next year i'll go next year and and yeah it's just as you do you know
S0262	yeah
S0360	tomorrow i'll do that and then the years just and i be wake up one day and realise it be twenty eight years
S0262	wow
S0360	and i think oh my god yes
S0261	they have to
S0262	but what be it like go back after twenty eight years to see your family members and
S0360	well when i tell people i be go and i hadn't see my family or they hadn't see me for this length of time people say to me will they recognise you
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0360	so i say
S0261	mm
S0361	so we get out the photos and
S0361	so
S0361	when we arrive
S0261	this this here
S0261	before and after
S0262	not much difference
S0360	well
S0361	clearly not much difference no
S0261	actually get a whole bunch of tattoo while
S0261	hang out in hang out in in london and right
S0262	oh god
S0361	i do sometimes wonder if i go to find
S0261	you see her down at the
S0361	a paint upstairs
S0261	market and
S0361	in the loft which be age for her
S0361	because i have more grey hair than she do
S0360	and i get most of that since come here
S0262	yeah right
S0360	ah but i think it's the sun that's probably it have something to do with it but yeah it's erm so er yeah i i go back i arrive i have no doubt that they would recognise me nor would i recognise any of them
S0262	yeah
S0360	and we go together didn't we yes
S0361	yes
S0360	two thousand and ten
S0361	mm
S0360	and erm i on the plane i didn't i the the the london thing of course you have a british passport they give you a thing to fill out
S0262	fill out
S0360	and i fill it out but i didn't fill out where i be go to be stay
S0361	oh god yes i remember this
S0360	yeah er so we get up to the woman at the at the immigration desk and she say ah oh you didn't er fill in the bite where you'll be say i say i'll be say with my sister who live five minutes up the road from here i have no idea what the address be

S0360	yes
S0361	not necessarily

S0261	i see
S0360	so i set about apply for that and er actually it wasn't as painful as i think it could be
S0262	yeah
S0360	er it would have be more painful if you think this place be bureaucratic gee god try to do anything in trinidad and tobago

S0262	it's it's it's clothe
S0360	yeah

S0361	because again be a small island while they do have some link to the us they they're behind the time in fashion and stuff
S0262	right
S0360	yeah
S0261	their thing yeah
S0361	so erm
S0261	and it tend to be more expensive
S0361	yeah
S0360	oh yeah

S0361	bring in stuff that you're that's that's up to date and er
S0262	yeah sure sure
S0361	erm
S0360	but there and there's still erm mentally erm i have a big link to the uk

S0360	because the uk have be
S0361	and a lot of the commonwealth place
S0360	the mother country
S0261	yeah there be
S0360	yeah yeah

S0262	okay
S0360	probably about right
S0262	yeah
S0360	yeah okay
S0262	be the flight expensive actually from when you go from here to to the uk and then uk to

S0360	but i i tend to
S0262	yeah
S0360	exclude this bite to the uk
S0262	oh okay
S0360	er mentally i don't
S0262	yeah
S0360	really

S0360	yeah
S0262	yeah okay
S0261	mm
S0360	yeah i i exclude that mentally i just think of the flight from england
