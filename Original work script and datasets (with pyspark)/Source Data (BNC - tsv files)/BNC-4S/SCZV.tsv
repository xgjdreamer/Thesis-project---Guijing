S0144	i mean they didn't test me but i just sit there and do it myself
S0013	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0013	let's hope it continue that would be brilliant
S0144	well my dad have good eye until he be about forty i think
S0012	so do i
S0013	mm
S0144	mm
S0012	i could read anything miles away or close up
S0144	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	until i be forty then i go go to the opticians and i say you know there's something wrong he say you're you're get forty what happen be
S0144	hm
S0012	your lenses harden
S0144	mm
S0012	and your muscle can't contract the lenses anymore
S0144	hm
S0013	yeah
S0024	if you steam your face would that help
S0144	hm
S0012	well there use to be an old indian way of do it the where you where you have to shut one eye an and look and try and focus as close as close you can go and then the other one
S0024	yeah but if your eye be harden you need to soften them
S0012	you can't do it
S0024	somehow
S0012	yeah
S0024	don't you think
S0012	you can't do it though
S0024	yeah
S0012	i've ask all about it and the only way to do it be have laser treatment and i don't want laser treatment i'd rather wear glass just in case anything go wrong with the laser treatment
S0024	yeah
S0012	i think oh well i'd a do it if i be younger but if you're younger you get longer to live with no sight
S0013	it's a very difficult thing to do i know
S0012	and
S0024	mm
S0012	when you're older you think well i might as well go on as i be
S0024	mm
S0144	mm
S0024	i'd be tempt
S0013	and we didn't realize you have to keep do it every two years sometimes
S0012	every two years
S0144	wow
S0012	it wear up
S0024	mm
S0144	mm
S0012	your your lenses
S0013	yeah
S0012	carry on either harden
S0024	mm
S0012	or
S0144	mm
S0012	you're get shorter sight or longer sight all the time as you get older
S0144	hm i'd say i know probably about ten people and they've have it do
S0024	they love it
S0012	yeah
S0024	they love it
S0144	they all love it
S0024	they mm
S0144	and they haven't have to have it do again either
S0024	no
S0012	no
S0024	no
S0013	hm
S0024	i don't know anybody who's have to have it do again
S0013	yeah
S0144	but maybe they've just be lucky i don't know
S0013	yeah
S0024	most of them say it's the best thing they've ever do
S0144	mm
S0012	yeah i bet it do yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	hm
S0012	it's about nearly a thousand pound for both eye
S0024	mm
S0012	but that might be
S0024	i think i should do it
S0013	be it no it's not quite be it
S0012	well they can do it for long sight a short sight one's easier than they can do it for long sight
S0024	mm
S0012	then let's say from three hundred and sixty five pound
S0013	oh right
S0012	each eye from
S0013	yeah
S0012	and that's the cheapest be three hundred and sixty five quid
S0024	yeah and you're unlikely to have the cheapest eye type
S0013	right
S0024	be you
S0013	no
S0012	no so
S0024	that be for someone with no stigmatisms
S0012	that's right yeah
S0024	no i don't know
S0013	yeah
S0012	so you can actually say a thousand quid that's go to cost you do you sort it
S0024	i'd like to do it i'd do it
S0012	you didn't sort it then
S0024	yes yes sort sort
S0012	you didn't say
S0024	well no but
S0012	oh i see i didn't mean to do that i think you'd do an mp3
S0024	no i couldn't do it i couldn't find your
S0012	no well you didn't sort it then
S0024	no i didn't say that i
S0012	that's what i be go to do sort it
S0024	well i didn't find it out
S0012	you didn't say anything
S0024	well no cos well
S0013	it's
S0012	oh
S0024	au naturel
S0013	mm
S0012	i think a little bite daft myself
S0024	why well actually yeah i press the button by accident and then i think oh
S0024	well i'll just keep go yeah
S0012	oh i see right
S0024	i don't know how to make an mp3 dad
S0012	no
S0024	no
S0144	you must be able to do it
S0024	mm
S0144	because the trouble be with the software we've get i don't think we can use an mp4 to listen to it
S0012	no that's right no
S0144	so
S0013	i think they be all just mp3
S0012	well i think well mp3 be suppose to be
S0024	i don't know anything about ipods
S0012	mp3 be suppose to be sound er yeah sound
S0144	mm
S0012	mp4
S0144	yeah you can watch videos as well
S0012	be support videos as well
S0013	oh right
S0012	so you've get the mp4 soundtrack on a video
S0144	mm
S0012	and that's what that try to do when we no try to change it back to mp4
S0144	yeah but it's complicate it now cos all of the previous software be just compatible with mp3
S0012	yeah
S0144	and they can't play mp4
S0012	no
S0144	so
S0013	oh
S0012	and my my um
S0024	i don't know
S0012	my little camera or both our little cameras record in mp4
S0144	mm
S0012	mpeg
S0024	mm
S0012	and there's hardly any players that play it back
S0144	mm
S0012	well there will be just like everything else but it seem stupid to me
S0024	like always
S0013	mm
S0024	well if there's no video why would you need the mp4
S0012	well that's right
S0012	but that's an mp4 track you see which which be compatible with video so i suppose you could put it on a video
S0024	oh
S0144	mm
S0012	your you know you could record a video and then stick that on
S0024	but they use to put music on videos before
S0012	you can put anything on video yeah you can you can put wave player on a video
S0144	mm
S0024	they just try and confuse you so you just keep up to date all the time so you just go oh i'll just have the the new one
S0013	yep
S0012	mm
S0024	those ipods though we've never go for the ipod have we
S0012	no
S0024	i've always want a mac computer once but never go for the ipod
S0144	i i think
S0024	cos everybody's usually break after a year exactly like on its birthday or something
S0013	that's right
S0012	oh be it oh i've have that
S0024	one year old kaput
S0012	yeah
S0024	i don't know why
S0013	mm
S0024	how long have you have that
S0013	like most things
S0012	how long have i have that since last birthday
S0013	no it be a couple of birthdays now
S0012	be it a couple of birthdays
S0024	so it's quite old then
S0013	must be
S0012	yeah
S0024	but you don't use it every day like most people use
S0012	no i don't use it every day
S0024	it every day don't they
S0013	we've hardly use it we take it away on holiday
S0012	yeah it's the only thing we could play we couldn't get radio on holiday
S0024	mm
S0012	in pembrokeshire
S0013	that's about it really
S0144	yeah
S0012	she couldn't get the radio
S0144	hm
S0012	couldn't even get bbc
S0144	yeah
S0012	one or two or whatever on
S0144	yeah
S0012	on an ordinary radio
S0144	well that's another thing they've update and
S0012	and it's useless
S0144	make it more difficult
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0144	and there's dab
S0013	yeah
S0024	dab
S0012	and the television since
S0144	digital
S0012	yeah
S0144	whatever it stand for
S0012	the television since they stop um what be it the aerial one
S0144	terrestrial
S0024	yeah analogue
S0012	analogue
S0144	analogue yeah
S0012	yeah since they stop analogue you get on this digital one you get all pixilation happen all over the top
S0144	mm hm
S0012	don't you
S0024	yeah your tv's always
S0012	and this one
S0024	do it isn't it
S0012	it didn't even record some of the stuff do it
S0013	no well we we're hop to sort that today aren't we
S0012	well i'm hop someone'll bring a
S0013	should be a
S0144	what be there someone come round
S0013	no
S0012	no we're we're have
S0013	we've order a
S0012	well the postman should bring us something today
S0144	oh right
S0013	a booster
S0144	oh okay
S0013	booster signal thing to go up in the loft
S0024	but why do you need a booster when they make you turn over to digital and it be all fine before and then you have to buy a booster
S0012	yeah yeah but if
S0013	but we think our thing up that's up in the loft that connect
S0144	right
S0013	two televisions
S0012	it connect all the televisions
S0013	we think that's very old now
S0012	around the house we can plug in most
S0024	oh i see
S0012	of the televisions
S0024	so the connector might
S0013	so we're guess anyway
S0024	just be a bite old
S0012	so the connector's go we think it have anyway
S0024	mm
S0144	mm
S0012	plus with the new digital television you're suppose to have a digital aerial
S0144	hm
S0012	on your roof you know to to to collect the digital signal and we've just get a vhs signal f aerial instead no an a uhf aerial
S0144	mm
S0012	but now they do digital aerials with all this
S0144	well they're just constantly change and like
S0013	it's too many letter isn't it
S0024	hang on they tell
S0013	mp3
S0013	vhs
S0024	all they say you need be a new television when the digital come in didn't they all you need be a new television
S0012	all you need be a box
S0024	when actually you need a new aerial a new television
S0012	yeah
S0024	new cable
S0013	mm
S0012	and when the wind blow if the wind's blow in the in a certain direction you would've still think the er the the wave would come through to the aerial
S0144	mm
S0012	that seem to blow them away
S0012	and you don't get a signal at all
S0012	and on on the sky box thing well that's not a sky box but a similar to the
S0013	satellite
S0012	satellite if it rain you don't get a signal at all
S0144	hm
S0012	so
S0144	mm
S0012	whichever way you can't win
S0024	mm
S0012	and yet analogue be brilliant you you never have any problems with analogue
S0024	before digital
S0012	yeah
S0024	what's analogue then just a company
S0012	no it's it's a way of it's a vh vhf very high frequency
S0024	oh
S0012	and that's that's what we use but now
S0013	i don't understand it the difference between wave and
S0024	it just it just seem really strange that they make you change it for something worse than
S0012	yeah
S0024	than you have before
S0012	well that be suppose to free up the the wavelengths on on er vhs
S0144	mm
S0012	f rather but whether it do or not i dunno
S0144	and with digital it can contain more information like embed in it
S0012	yeah
S0144	like you put the radio on
S0024	what subliminal
S0144	and instead of just go through the frequency range it tell you what channel you're on
S0012	yeah that's right
S0024	yeah
S0013	mm
S0144	and if you select bbc one you
S0012	and what's play
S0024	oh yeah
S0013	yeah
S0144	and stuff like that
S0013	that's quite nice
S0144	yeah
S0013	i like to know what's play
S0012	that tell you what's play but
S0144	yeah
S0012	can it see you
S0012	all these secret little things that they keep stick in like all this
S0024	well your computer camera you can't even cover it up it's just look at you all of the time
S0012	yeah
S0024	i have to turn ours round
S0024	i won't have those
S0144	sometimes it come on on its own
S0012	do it
S0144	yeah
S0012	oh
S0024	yeah
S0013	what's look at you
S0144	the camera
S0024	the camera
S0144	sometimes
S0024	on your if you sit at your computer i just want to cover it up
S0144	sometimes
S0024	that camera be there in your face
S0144	sometimes er the the light come on and it's activate
S0012	be it
S0144	just and there's sit you can go and you can get into anyone's computer and look through their webcam
S0012	oh right
S0024	oo

S0024	so we never have it point at us
S0012	no
S0012	oh well
S0024	i know
S0013	that's scary isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0024	that's why whenever you phone us on skype you always use to see the sofa before you saw us and we then we'd turn it round
S0012	oh and you you'd be upside down most of the time
S0024	oh i know i don't know why that be
S0144	yeah cos people haven't get if they haven't get their privacy settings correct on their computer
S0012	yeah
S0144	you can use their ip address get in
S0012	yeah you can
S0144	and then look through their webcam
S0012	yeah
S0144	and people have actually use it to see what's in people's house
S0144	and stuff like that and then go and rob them
S0012	yeah
