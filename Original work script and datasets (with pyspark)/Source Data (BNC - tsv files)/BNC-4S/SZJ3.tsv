S0266	and sometimes if it be
S0309	even a weekend
S0266	go to be a long shop my mum be put through cos she'd be talk and mrs would be in the run away and get all the stuff and there'd be the glass thing
S0268	mm
S0266	where she'd pay and they'd have all the
S0268	mm
S0266	paper on a spike

S0268	yeah
S0266	dash off and go down to woolworths to spend me pocket money on a
S0309	oh woolies yeah down
S0268	yes
S0266	on the latest erm record
S0268	mm
S0266	cos we use to have woolworths there
S0309	yeah i remember that
S0268	yeah yeah
S0309	mm
S0266	and do you remember
S0268	and a and a smith's and a smith's
S0266	yeah there use to be a smith's
S0309	smith's where be that
S0268	down
S0266	yeah
S0309	oh what
S0268	opposite woolworth's
S0308	yeah
S0268	so do you reckon this revival be gonna work
S0266	and gladworth's there use to
S0309	dunno i'd like to think it would because it's
S0268	because
S0309	it's a great shame they've mess it about so much
S0268	but it i think it's
S0308	there be some really nice architectural properties
S0268	mm
S0308	in but sadly they're they've be build in the wrong place
S0309	yes
S0308	if you know what i mean i when i say the wrong place they're not in the main hub of the centre of the town the main hub the centre of the town be like you've just say the planners have get a lot to answer for because they quite the they it's it's function of aesthetics
S0268	mm
S0308	the function be we want to create a little bypass round the main street so we can make it pedestrianised great idea
S0268	mm
S0308	so they take the road round the back but the road round the back then face the back of all the shop
S0268	yes
S0309	mm
S0308	and i mean that could be so attractive
S0309	and it be originally plan to
S0308	to make it the shop frontage
S0309	yeah
S0268	yeah yeah
S0309	there be gonna be more stuff along there and they never do it i mean this be when it be first moot
S0308	right
S0309	but originally when i first come they be gonna take the bypass the other way round and a i mean use to work where the arcade dental surgery be now be a what's it call
S0308	oh
S0309	i dunno but behind there be gonna go all round the back there
S0308	oh
S0309	and come out where the lion's hut be
S0308	right
S0309	but for some reason they never do
S0308	mm
S0309	erm and they when where they on the present route
S0308	it's a classic i mean i'm sure people do architecture of landscape or whatever town and country plan would be a an absolute pearl for them wouldn't it
S0309	yeah
S0308	how not to do it
S0309	well it's be quote in several architectural book
S0308	have it
S0309	yes
S0308	oh
S0309	yeah
S0266	but then why do they continue with that build if l think they realise their mistake with the library and the
S0309	mm
S0266	or whoever it be that build and then they allow sainsbury's to build that
S0309	well
S0266	monstrosity
S0309	exactly yeah i mean
S0266	i mean you'd have think they'd have learn
S0309	well
S0268	mm
S0309	yes of course they should have learn
S0266	cos that's recent so why have they do that
S0309	well i who know why do anything er thank goodness you've get up there now who might be able to
