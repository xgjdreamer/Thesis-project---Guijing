S0159	yeah i forgive you for charge me too much
S0003	i'm on vodafone and the signal be amaze like you can get signal anywhere but they give you no freebies
S0130	it's all down it's all down to basically if you get it depend on your tariff if you work for if you have pay as you go and you're there say oh oh you end up ring up complain oh i'm not get this it's because you've not ask for it most of the time or you don't know how to do it
S0113	i don't think many people on pay as you go now though it's a die breed
S0159	no
S0003	i know yeah it be
S0130	no you you say that though but the the the simplicity the simplicity tariff be twenty five pound you get like you get unlimited texts five hundred minutes i think unlimited data which be pretty much the same as a contract
S0159	isn't that only to o2 though or be that the other one
S0130	that's that's for o2 but you can but you know what i mean like you know you people pay like i've get a mate who i work with he pay thirty quid for his contract a month and for a fiver less
S0003	you can get the
S0130	he can go on pay as you go
S0003	but then you have to pay the you have to buy the phone don't you
S0130	that well yeah but that that's
S0003	and then so you can't have a iphone cos it cost a fortune
S0113	he's already get a iphone in contract
S0130	but at the same time if you're on contract if you this be a fact this if you're on what like say a twenty four month contract you end up pay about six hundred quid more
S0003	oh my god really
S0130	yeah honestly if you're on contract for say pay as you go and stuff like that this be this be no word of a lie if you're on if you're on em like em a a contract you pay so much but you pay it for so long you end up pay more back that's what than what the phone be actually worth
S0003	that it work out yeah yeah yeah i know i get what you mean
S0130	as well as the top up that's no word of a lie
S0159	yeah so far on my phone i've pay about seven hundred pound just for the contract
S0113	how long have it be
S0003	see do you know if you actually sit down and work it out
S0130	em do you know how much the phone's worth
S0159	about well when i get it it be about three hundred quid
S0130	well there you go then
S0003	yeah that's true actually if you actually do sit down but it's the it's people can't most people can't afford to pay off right can they the the money
S0113	no
S0159	yeah no
S0130	well that that's cos i when i be look to get a iphone at first i em i like i like price it up and stuff like that and it just come out as nine hundred quid
S0003	mm mm hm mm
S0130	go on contract
S0159	yeah

S0159	really
S0130	fifty fifty quid contract what do he get for that
S0003	he's get like unlimited internet and his iphone's like the biggest one that you can get oh i don't know you know what 's like
