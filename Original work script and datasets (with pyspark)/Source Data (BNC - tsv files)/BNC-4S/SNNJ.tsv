S0560	yeah
S0544	end of the day though it be just vulgar for the sake be vulgar

S0544	that be my text message thing
S0542	that be pretty cool
S0544	yeah
S0560	yeah
S0544	it be a good goal he celebrate with a chest slide
S0560	i love how far they slide on this it's like
S0544	i know
S0560	sol campbell
S0544	yeah
S0542	i never i never get that when you play like football before when people would do celebrations where like they'll slide on their knees i'm like you're just unnecessarily tear your knees up like why
S0560	you're ruin the pitch as well
S0544	sometimes you can get like a dry pitch it's like
S0542	that's the reason why i never do it cos the first time i go to do that it wasn't particularly
S0544	no we play once at and the it be just like just as night be set and so there be like i dunno why but the grass be really slick and i slide for age
S0544	it be just the perfect knee slide condition
S0560	oh right
S0542	i do do it once on a ridiculously muddy pitch where like you know play be impossible cos like you would just fall over
S0544	cos the ball get stick
S0560	i've do it before
S0542	but like when you're in goal as well like er cos you're just
S0544	yeah
S0542	and erm i dunno i for some reason i think it be when we be just like practise there i be just like oh i'll slide and i i i didn't wanna slide on my knees cos i know like the pain
S0560	er it be really good on scout camp once though cos i er it be a big organise one with like load of scout from like all over the country they have this massive like
S0542	that's quite rank
S0560	all the grass and like mud
S0542	i be tree man
S0560	yeah like swim short
S0542	oh right okay
S0544	you guy ever like chest slide on grass
S0560	er well apart from that
S0542	maybe once i don't know
S0560	not shirtless but it be like it be like really soak up wet grass so it wasn't too bad
S0544	oh right cos cos that burn
S0560	yeah i can imagine
S0544	i do it once and just hurt my chest
S0544	into into the grind
S0542	ah i i tell you you know your concern with robot and he be like
S0560	but the you might have more of a problem with the front wheel steer be what i be think
S0544	what's this robot
S0560	cos it's cos the yeah cos people be say it like
S0542	but like but as soon as you hit the block like that's it the power to the drive and
S0560	yeah
S0542	er steer all go like you can't
S0560	yeah but that's what i mean though it's cos erm the previous students be say about the fact it might be jump from side to side with the steer it might be more out of line because of one of those recent jump than other people's when they're do the rear wheel steer
S0542	hold on sorry i'm message dad

S0542	i'd love that to be honest
S0544	i wouldn't i'd be so i'd be like i'd probably end up in one dream i'll be you know what fuck this i can't be arsed any more
S0560	yeah i probably would as well to be honest
S0544	like i can't be arsed
S0560	it's like you'd have you'd have a deadline in the real world so you're just like fuck it i'm go ten layer down into this dream
S0544	and live my whole life
S0560	to be fair like if you think about it in that way like objectively
S0542	i really like this film so you be careful
S0560	yeah but why why shouldn't that reality be your reality like in life there's
S0542	oh no i don't
S0560	there's something to be say for like the reason you have a life other than to like just have a nice life
S0542	yeah
S0560	like
S0542	would that like it kind of no no but
S0560	this reality
S0542	it illustrate
S0560	and just make that your reality it's like
S0542	well that's what happen to all them people in india like they come to the erm
S0560	india
S0542	in the in the film he go oh it's not india it's erm be it india i dunno
S0544	no come on we're get deep go deeper
S0542	anyway erm yeah no when they go to like the chemist place to go and get all the er the compound
S0560	oh yeah
S0542	to be like sedate and he he show them underneath his like
S0560	oh yeah of course yeah
S0542	this chemical thing
S0560	yeah
S0542	and all the people like go in and like just sleep for like three to four hours
S0560	yeah
S0542	which be like well he say it's forty hours of dreamtime so they go there and they spend it's a way to like prolong your life as well you know
S0560	yeah
S0542	the only thing be i don't think you could ever like learn anything because if it's your dream it's stuff you already know and like
S0560	yeah
S0542	society would not progress if everyone do that
S0560	that part would kind of suck but
S0542	yeah you could do
S0560	it's kind of really selfish but it's kinda like
S0542	well would it not be kind of lonely in your dream because in in the film like all the other people occupy it be just your subconscious
S0560	yeah
S0542	so unless you could bring someone else into your dream
S0542	be this like how like nerdy and like social reject things like people talk about they're like oh if only we didn't have to deal with the real world
S0560	no the the the way it have occur to me
S0542	oh my god what be that
S0543	surprise
S0543	erm do you two have a ruler i can borrow please
S0544	er it's in my bag
S0544	it's in the second pocket
S0560	er the way that it have occur to me though be like er a future like virtual reality and like er humans er like i'm go
S0544	humans
S0560	i'm go really sci fi on this but like humans' evolution's like into the like digital like so we're all transcend the physical world and just just brain and wire and whatever
S0542	yeah
S0560	yeah that at that point like people would be against that but personally in my opinion like
S0542	yeah mm
S0560	it's like if it's a decent society that you're live in in the matrix why would you wanna leave it and go into this shitty one and change it
S0542	er i dunno i couldn't
S0560	well in the matrix it's the real world so it's not that great but
S0544	because it well the thing be when you see the film like that everyone want to see what the actual real world like look like like
S0560	yeah fuck it i'm go back into the world
S0542	i guess inception be the closest thing that do actually explore that cos it's like well
S0560	well well the matrix do
S0542	well the no but the matrix do but he like leave it but in inception arguably he accept his dream like
S0560	yeah
S0542	reality and just take that
S0560	yeah
S0542	but erm yeah no most of the film be just people be like er if someone do if someone do say to you
S0560	yeah curiosity would make you want to see the outside world yeah
S0542	so say the matrix like plot basically happen to you
S0560	i would i would probably go back in if i could but i i again the curiosity would make me want to see the outside world
S0542	i know i i'd be curious that's what i'm get at people would be curious to know
S0560	that guy that want to go back in and end up die
S0542	yeah
S0560	as i say it's like if that can be your reality then why reject it
S0542	i know i i get the logic of that but i'm just literally morbidly curious
S0544	get another fifa update
S0542	bloody hell this get well deep didn't it
S0560	yeah the thing be like know er humans and shit like if it's the same humans that be in that matrix world that be come out to the outside one it wouldn't be any better really would it
S0542	no
S0560	like cos humans be kind of shit in a way
S0542	well i i don't know i find it offensive that like this alien species would come in and well it's not even alien species it's just machine isn't it
S0560	yeah
S0542	erm that like we'd be abuse for like chemical power cos that's what they be do aren't they
S0560	it be it's symbiotic though cos they're provide a reasonable world for us at the same time so like
S0542	yeah i guess but i'd be like you bastards
S0542	you didn't have my permission i didn't sign up for this i be bear into it
S0560	yeah that's kind of fair
S0542	like i'm all for that but like there's gonna be people who be like no i don't wanna go back in
S0560	yeah if the choice be give i'd say it's perfectly fine but yeah it's
S0542	i'd understand why people would want to live there but i'd be like no you need to like kind of face the truth cos
S0560	yeah
S0542	this this isn't ideal
S0560	yeah
S0542	i mean it's ideal for you like personally but as a race do you not think we have a responsibility to not just lock ourselves into a room plug ourselves into a computer and live out whatever we want
S0560	yeah
S0544	wasn't that the plot of a futurama episode with the er fake women
S0560	fake women
S0544	the robot women
S0560	oh right yeah i don't think that's quite the same but
S0544	not quite the same but it's touch on the
S0542	oh yes i remember that
S0544	marilyn monroe bot
S0560	lucy lu robot
S0544	yeah
S0560	yeah it's like hey jimmy do you wanna go to the cinema no thank i'd er rather just make out with my marilyn monroe bot
S0544	yeah
S0560	i'm sorry i didn't get the report do i be have sex with my marilyn monroe bot
S0542	oh yeah then it like cut and like obviously like the robot's like not age at all and he's like
S0560	yeah he's just like an old man
S0542	he's like eighty odd he's like and then she just kind of well he die and the robot and what do the robot do after that
S0544	can't remember
S0542	like throw him in a skip or something like really morbid and
S0560	yeah
S0542	i think that's how it work
S0560	arnie use to be a sexbot
S0544	discuss
S0542	discuss
S0560	yeah it er not it be never explicitly state that like they could clothe can't travel wasn't it
S0542	yeah i know why don't the clothe travel
S0560	if it's make of wool or something that's
S0542	isn't it like organic matter over the skeletal frame cos he do bleed doesn't he
S0560	well that's a good point yeah the metal part shouldn't travel if clothe doesn't travel
S0542	i know
S0560	bullshit
S0542	i don't think terminator be really use for
S0560	yeah it's not very accurate let's be honest
S0542	it's not really accurate and the fact that and hasn't the most recent one just completely like destroy like all the previous
S0560	oh i haven't see genisys
S0542	i haven't see genisys
S0544	i don't want to see genisys

S0560	it's it's probably fairly similar both directions like distance isn't it
S0544	oh no we always go east though to go there
S0560	oh
S0542	yeah when you fly to the philippines do you have to erm
S0544	stop off in dubai or the middle east somewhere
S0542	yeah we stop off in dubai when we go to australia land at like three o'clock in the morning and it be like twenty five thirty degrees
S0544	australia
S0560	oh god yeah
S0542	it be like
S0560	oh yeah we have that when we go to cyprus
S0542	and then we get delay by seven hours the flight
S0560	yeah
S0542	er people be sleep like they be lie down on the bench and
S0544	yeah piss me off when they do that
S0542	and some be underneath the bench
S0560	efficiency
S0542	yeah i know it be
S0560	solution
S0542	cos there be just no we couldn't find seat anywhere
S0560	i've do that in quite a few european station actually just lay my bag down like big sixty five litre rucksack and just sleep on it
S0542	yeah
S0560	yeah
S0542	how often do you take a sixty five litre rucksack to train station
S0560	that be when we be go round europe
S0542	oh be it
S0560	yeah ah you could probably sleep in a station without it
S0544	just sleep
S0560	you know i i like be be prepare and have like massive rucksack like that
S0542	i didn't have a rucksack but just have a clip on you know that
S0560	oh yeah the belt strap
S0542	i forget to do that i don't know if it have a belt strap or not it might do cos something hang down and hit the like but i haven't look at it that closely
S0560	oh it's some of those smaller rucksacks be absolutely shit though
S0542	yeah i know but the chest one be good so as soon as i stop just as before i get to our street
S0560	yeah
S0542	erm i er i put the bag down cos i be like ah
S0560	sudden release
S0542	cos you have to if you don't have it on you have to kind of like bend your shoulder like that to stop it slip
S0560	yeah to stop it slip
S0542	slip off and i do that and i be like oh this be alright now
S0560	yeah it sort of transfer it across your chest doesn't it
S0542	how far be it from sainsbury's to here
S0560	it's probably further than it seem actually
S0542	do you reckon it's half a mile
S0560	maybe no idea
S0542	it's more than half a mile
S0544	i'd go for more than half a mile
S0560	i can never judge distance go through like urban areas cos it always feel so much shorter than it be
S0544	nod
S0560	i imagine it's that sainsbury's
S0544	that sainsbury's though
S0542	street be that it
S0544	no it's
S0542	it's eighteen minutes away
S0544	be it
S0560	oh yeah the google map always like massively overestimate the time it take to get walk somewhere
S0542	oh it be point nine of a mile
S0544	yay i be right
S0542	so i i walk a mile with like twenty kilos of shop on my back
S0560	so many
S0542	if you drive there it's over a mile and if you transport i don't know what transport mean but yeah
S0544	if you transport there
S0542	drive walk
S0560	transport yeah it'll be public transport probably
S0542	but would public transport not just be the oh i guess it will link to all the bus time and that rather than
S0560	but you can get a bus directly from here to er sainsbury's
S0542	yeah no but it still have to it still have to go the route though doesn't it be what i'm say
S0560	no i think the route's the same route you take the car i think
S0542	yeah i know that's what i'm say like it's it's a one way system
S0560	yeah and then you don't you have to get off at the bus station and walk but it's not very far
S0542	i be really tempt to get the bus back
S0560	well if you've get a bus pass you might as well
S0542	yeah i know i be like er i be like i i there i will get there and it'll be like oh bus leave in like ten minutes i'll be like ah i can walk it in fifteen
S0560	yeah yeah
S0542	i probably it probably take you a lot longer than fifteen to walk back
S0560	you would've if you'd do that
S0542	it probably take me about twenty minutes to walk back
S0560	yeah
S0542	i be gonna get some erm some coco pop be on offer and i be gonna get them and i kind of like look at the thing before i'd even pay
S0560	just carry it in your teeth on the way back
S0542	cos i have to erm i have to get er bog roll for upstairs bathroom
S0544	it's always a problem for us
S0560	just as a thank you for
S0542	yeah cos ours be grim
S0560	they do a very bad job if they do
S0542	er yeah i cos i i think as far as i know i think might have clean it once last term maybe twice and i clean it maybe ten time
S0560	well if use theirs you can't if do make a complaint you don't clean the bathroom you can say i don't use it
S0542	i don't use it any more but then 'll be like can you clean our bathroom like nah
S0560	to be fair you you'd still be better off with that if they take their turn do it
S0542	yeah i know i'm i'm happy just buy toilet roll and bleach to be honest that's all i buy i buy bathroom cleaner and
S0544	we bleach
S0542	a toilet brush holder
S0560	yeah i be gonna say don't do get em off bleach
S0544	we bleach
S0560	yeah
S0544	i forget which job be yours
S0560	be it be it end of the month or start of the month
S0544	start of the month
S0560	alright so it will be weekend after next i think
S0560	i don't actually know what day it be today
S0542	we need to put some supply for er
S0544	friday
S0542	well maybe not this year cos our house be er oh i didn't i tell what our landlord do
S0544	what do he do
S0542	so he come round and be like ah he basically he pull me from my room and make me follow him and his son around 's room and 's room
S0544	oh this be with the thing in the
S0542	look for the leak and then he be like do you have a number for the university i'm like okay like think he he'd actually call the like the university not like or something
S0560	er it's fair enough you do want him to paint cos bare plaster be horrible get dust everywhere
S0542	yeah but i didn't think that i should be the person to say oh yeah it's fix like i haven't be in 's room for like two weeks
S0544	yeah
S0560	well that's fair enough you can't say it's fix if er
S0544	if it's not
S0542	i just say it doesn't appear to be but
S0560	probably what's happen be he come round the university
S0542	i bet he be
S0560	well yeah he's he's
S0542	the fact that erm i be gonna go in erm with and to go and complain but erm this be when i didn't have a bus pass and i like would have to pay to go onto campus come back from campus
S0544	third time
S0560	for the banter
S0544	for the bant
S0542	well just cos the gap between lecture mean that
S0560	yeah it's like two or two or three hour gap
S0542	i'm gonna run out of stuff to do or you know have to go home or whatever
S0544	i always stay on campus i'm just i i go and sit in now
S0542	you're a ghost in
S0544	yeah can't get rid of me
S0542	what time do shut
S0544	eleven
S0542	eleven okay cos erm
S0542	and be on about do like actually do and complete like a a er you know all the college bar
S0544	er who be this
S0542	er friends in engineer
S0544	do it
S0542	well apparently yeah
S0560	all the society bar crawl start there but i dunno if that's cos of that or not
S0542	well i i think it's cos they say cos it's er quiet like they shouldn't shut at like ten or whenever they do but it's because there's no one there
S0560	oh right so they shut early
S0542	cos er they shut early but erm and er live in last year
S0544	it's a shit bar
S0560	but you wanna end up in 's the best
S0542	's not bad
S0544	i haven't be to since fresher's week
S0542	's a bite small sorry
S0544	i haven't be in since fresher's week
S0542	i haven't be in i haven't be in since i have that cloudy cider which i think i'd be alright i have one pint of cloudy cider and i dunno if it's just cos i hadn't have cider in a while but when i get the bus back cos we then have to like come here and start drink
S0544	well if it's like a nine or ten percent cider that's the equivalent of like two and a half pints
S0542	i dunno i dunno what i dunno what percentage it be but i don't think i drink it particularly quickly but i just kind of like leave i be like you know little bite tipsy i'm like oh right okay
S0560	just fall off the
S0542	but i i be really like
S0560	yeah you be spike
S0542	i know i be er i be like pretty sure no one spike my drink
S0560	like if it be on tap it's likely a very strong cider
S0542	it be it be on offer there er they be like they be have like a special erm er like you know a name that i'd never hear of or whatever
S0560	yeah
S0542	specialty thing
S0544	home brew
S0542	probably definitely blow your head off
S0544	yeah
S0542	so i have that and i be like mm but yeah that that's the only time i've be in bar this year but they they say that they want to do it in the erm apparently over the summer when we finish exams er we're gonna have like we'll still have lecture somehow er we be discuss what that would be that's probably gonna be we're probably gonna have third year lecture at the end of this year like prepare us
S0544	ah no i'm not have that
S0542	erm well we in engineer be anyway
S0560	okay
S0542	er like as in we'll only have like lecture two days a week
S0560	fair enough
S0542	but they be just kind of like discuss it and like oh right okay
S0544	doable
S0542	i be i be gonna say something about and i be like i'll ask
S0544	
S0542	can you get to stay open longer for us so we can actually do it
S0544	erm
S0542	probably not
S0544	probably not oh for fuck
S0560	i'm try to think the real ale one it's it's erm
S0544	well how long do you need
S0560	and then the other ones like the middle ones
S0560	yeah and if it's open
S0542	well yeah cos they be say that erm apparently be like always shut
S0560	and then
S0544	yeah but it's open it's open
S0560	yeah it's it's open like all day now isn't it or like every day
S0544	yeah cos last year be
S0560	like they they complain about it or something so they've they've rectify it
S0544	and be always shut during the day at one point
S0560	yeah bar be horrible though
S0544	bar be terrible
S0560	it's sort of like a horrible half mix between club and bar and it's just doesn't work
S0542	yeah it be the one that i'm think of then yeah
S0544	it's not great i don't like it it's like a social space like a social club if you get what i mean
S0560	yeah i can kind of see what you mean there
S0544	it be horrible especially when the er dj's put spotify on
S0542	be chat about erm
S0560	oh yeah that be weird yeah

S0544	oh yeah that be so weird
S0542	like what the fuck

S0544	yeah
S0542	cos i can't remember i be try to work out like what days they'd make it a pub and what days club

S0544	it work definitely much better as a pub
S0560	yeah pub
S0544	it's pretty decent as a pub but as a club it's just what the fuck be this
S0542	yeah cos there's a top floor as well er ain't there
S0544	yeah
S0560	and it be
S0542	it's normally close off because er hardly anyone there er to fill the bottom floor
S0542	what do it use to be
S0542	oh it be wasn't it yeah
S0560	i've never be to a i'd not even hear of em till i come to
