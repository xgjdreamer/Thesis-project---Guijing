S0119	okay we're record now cos be it be that okay if we put that in the start of the record
S0173	yeah
S0054	can can your voice be pick up
S0119	yes because i can see the wave form
S0054	eh okay
S0119	i seem to have a very distinctive voice i'm pick up on microphone
S0173	oh that's good em i think you should tell us about last night about the em comedy and how em it be receive by i'm sure you go to the bar afterwards
S0054	yeah
S0173	how well it be receive by people in the bar
S0054	em it well it seem to have go down quite well em which be please em but eh yeah the audience wasn't as big as we normally have for those gigs em largely because eh a sunday night be a very big social night for students so
S0173	yes i saw lot of people wear gown and suit and things and i think isn't that a bite strange on a sunday because obviously well i know it's student life but still
S0054	yeah it be a it be a a formal night mm
S0119	i think there be a formal go on wasn't there or something
S0054	yeah be always always have a formal on sundays
S0119	they always have suit on no matter when
S0054	yeah just everyone
S0054	em and eh yeah it's just in general just the the culture be that sunday be a big big night like there be various big club nights and stuff so em it's just a thing across the entire university that sunday be be a big social night and this be the last sunday of the term so
S0173	oh yeah it's true everything's happen this week
S0054	em yeah
S0119	do that mean that any lecturer doesn't actually you know like want to schedule a lecture for nine be or what on monday
S0054	oh no they if anything they're gain pleasure from do so
S0119	welcome to torture i mean maths one o the three i mean torture
S0173	yeah because usually wouldn't there be some kind of like you know major deadline in the last week of term
S0054	yeah the thing be it just vary from person to person not even from subject to subject like em some people end up have far too much to do at the end of term other people can have like a real ease down like em i remember sometimes for me i have like a everything would sort of amass around the seventh week of term and then the eighth week i be just sit there go well everything i have to do now i have until may to do so em
S0173	yeah and then easter holiday use to happen and then everyone go home and
S0054	yeah
S0173	presumably do no work or so they do lot of work i think i hear that cambridge students actually have to work load in the holiday
S0054	oh god yeah em i mean i mean we all have to so about half of us do em
S0119	wait a minute
S0173	everyone else go ski
S0054	em yeah probably i don't know i've never be ski i'm not rich enough
S0173	mm i go once i wasn't rich enough i didn't realise how much it be gonna cost like i pay sort of the upfront price but of course excuse me
S0119	that should be transcribe as cough cough cough
S0173	wasabi pea
S0069	wasabi pea
S0173	em yeah i i think it be like this be about six years ago in fact it be around the time i get my laptop em and i
S0119	so you take it ski and that's why it's so slow
S0119	it couldn't handle the cold and it's never recover
S0173	that could be it actually i i think i get it just after i go ski em i don't know how because i would have have no money at all
S0119	i just spend my money let's spend more brilliant
S0173	yeah it be really really necessary cos my previous laptop screen stop work everything else work fine but the back light stop work
S0119	oh
S0054	ah
S0173	so i couldn't actually see everything that be on the screen which be not useful but anyway so i go ski and pay like four or five hundred pound upfront which i think be a lot for a week but still
S0054	mm hm
S0173	okayish like cos i really want to go ski and then i get there there be like the ski pass lift pass something pass
S0119	lift pass yeah
S0173	yeah and that be another hundred and then there be sort of like pay for food and the entertainment and they be really expensive like bar and place
S0069	where do you go
S0173	oh be it la plagne la plagne in france i think em somewhere french definitely and i go with people who have be ski like one of my friends be a snowboarder he be amaze
S0119	they they kind of know about all these hide cost to begin with so like yeah of course you pay a hundred dollars for a lift pass
S0173	yeah
S0119	of course you do that
S0054	you just you just leak money when ski
S0173	that's the thing
S0119	i mean it's the thing that like you're in a ski resort be not like a metropolitan area or attach or anything cos it's in the a frigging mountain area
S0173	and so they can charge what they want
S0119	exactly
S0054	yeah
S0173	yeah
S0119	it's like it's like it's like be in a very extend airport but with more white and better maintain
S0173	basically there be a lot of white
S0119	less less hobos
S0173	yes there be definitely a lot of white and also cos you're do so much ski you're use energy all day so you're so hungry all the time so you have to buy enormous quantities of food to like keep go
S0054	yeah
S0069	mm
S0119	that sound delicious
S0173	it's amaze it's like a license to eat cheese and chocolate mm fondue
S0054	do you you need a license for that now this have get draconian
S0119	well you see you buy you buy the gold lift pass and then you get on to the lift and all of a sudden a pot of like fondue and a steak appear
S0173	that would be amaze that might be a business idea
S0069	so cool
S0119	what do you have for breakfast
S0054	i really hope that go into textbook that's
S0119	what do you have for breakfast i have chilli chocolate fondue steak
S0119	twenty one day age beef and you sort of get it and it's get a picture of jamie oliver wink on it and it's like nurgh
S0173	that's enough to put you off your food
S0119	yeah you think it's actually it's actually they've actually have to put ordinances out because people just throw them at skiers go past it's like it's like pigeons that dive bomb you when you're on the on the side walk
S0173	i wish that have happen to me it didn't happen to me
S0119	what pigeon dive bomb you
S0173	well not the pigeon part but the food
S0173	but all that end up happen be that i em didn't know how to ski which obviously would have happen and as it be my first time and the first step be like slide down a mountain for about fifty metres backwards go uuuaarh
S0173	to my friend who be at the top and couldn't help me
S0173	em yeah
S0119	be there some sort of just very large shrug of like oh i don't know
S0173	well basically i just didn't think i be ever go to stop
S0054	yeah i think i think ski be a gift to slapstick but em
S0173	yes
S0054	it's it's not not so great for you know personal health em
S0173	that's the thing and you could so easily like break your leg or die so
S0119	i like i like how those be two options it's either like well you can break your leg or you can just flat out corpse on the on the slope
S0054	well i have put off the idea of ski at all because em someone i know eh sudden well i mean i i don't know her well enough but it's on on facebook just eh she sort of vanish for a bite and then come back em okay it's fine everyone em i i i've be fly back back to the hospital in ireland so i'm well enough that's alright and then just post up all the picture of the metal which be now in her spine
S0173	ooh god
S0119	oh
S0054	break her back ski
S0173	ooh that be enough to put anybody off except it's not
S0054	yeah i'm i'm okay with not go ski because the expensive thing and the whole break the back thing totally up for avoid that
S0173	yeah and the cold i mean okay you've get like ski jacket and stuff but it's still freeze
S0173	yeah
S0119	it's the reason why all the sort of like the picture of ski resort have giant roar fire it's like must keep the cold out somehow
S0173	yeah mm yeah the even part of ski look great
S0054	the après ski
S0173	exactly
S0119	yeah but it's it's it's good just to be like around like you don't want the actual it's like
S0173	some people do that though like people's often people's wive or girlfriends or maybe husband too i don't know they go and they like just stay in the chalet and they don't actually ski
S0069	yeah i do that
S0054	yeah
S0069	have a sauna yeah
S0054	yeah there be there there be the whole thing about people who go ski just for the après ski
S0173	yeah
S0119	ski posers
S0173	yeah
S0119	mind you i could say the exact same happen thing happen my dad be heavily into scuba dive and like you'd often like we get drag along cos it be a tropical island in the caribbean and we be seduce
S0173	you're not go to say no
S0054	i like how you say drag along
S0119	well it be because it it it's exceedingly tedious and i be a bite of a dumb kid so it's like yeah why be i here
S0173	i suppose if you're a kid it's not
S0119	well it's like what's there to do it's like my parent be like or you can sunbathe i be like i don't give a fuck so oops shit eh damn it eh
S0119	break the no swear rule
S0173	your use of the english language be colourful
S0119	ah it's very nice they drag you drag drag to a caribbean island it be on it be on a massive discount because it be the last person last minute sort of drop out and they need to fill the space with like anyone who would be able to pay the half rate so we manage to get go to this caribbean island for
S0054	right
S0119	my dad do ski my dad not ski ski on the water but no go scuba dive and so i be kind of leave on the shore but it be the sort of thing where like that one or four or half of the group of not more be just there because they be drag along
S0054	because yeah
S0119	and em they didn't want to be away and also it be a good excuse to have a reduce rate sort of fly out there while other people go go scuba dive you just go and faffed around
S0054	yeah
S0119	em on shore and then basically yeah quite a lot of people be there with the with the for the first day they be very happy with it then the second day they learn that scuba dive include a lot of like tidy up after people and quietly get hack off about the whole thing
S0054	mm
S0119	because scuba divers would come back dump a load of wet gear on them and say here you can sort this out and it's like no what be you do and then scuba divers would then go into the pub and get drink so then they'd be no good to go till the next day when they'd get their kit back on and go back underneath the wave
S0173	that sound like such a bad idea scuba dive when you're hang over
S0119	well enough of them do it so
S0054	better than scuba dive when drink
S0173	well arguably
S0119	yeah well actually the worst thing you can do and it's arguably worse than be absolutely slaughter out of your mind be when you go scuba dive with an ear infection because you rely on your balance so go scuba dive with this ear infection you basically don't know your depth or your orientation and you can basically do the whole thing of like swim like think you're swim up but you're go down and end up kind of like put yourself into way deep pressure
S0173	ooh
S0119	it's kind of like mess up the things that can happen to you scuba dive
S0173	that's really weird
S0054	now i've be put off go scuba dive this be this be actually make my list of things to do before i die a lot shorter
S0173	so let's let's talk about sky dive
S0069	yeah
S0119	that's actually that cos the thing be sky dive be the most dangerous sort of sport activity and scuba diving's the second
S0173	really
S0069	really
S0119	yeah like if accord to insurance list
S0173	what about bull fight
S0119	that's not really to be consider a leisure activity
S0119	at least not like the british like insurance and so
S0173	more just like suicidal
S0069	yeah
S0119	yeah so you want to end your life
S0173	travel to spain
S0054	that sound like a self help pamphlet
S0119	so you want to end your own life and the government won't help you cos they're dicks so bull fight
S0054	vote
S0119	for a short but exhilarate life
S0173	ah you've get your new slogan
S0119	yeah i'm on this platform would you like to take a pamphlet
S0173	i i think em so so so tell exactly why he will love sushi see that it's his first time tonight he's a sushi virgin
S0069	you'll just love it
S0054	oh okay
S0069	i've tell you all week i like your glass by the way that's what i be think
S0054	thank you
S0069	they're really shiny how be your eye
S0054	em i i still feel drink
S0069	do you
S0054	it's weird
S0173	what be your glass like before
S0054	em not like this eh i i i have an interest experience em a week ago which i don't think i explain but essentially i be at a gig and my glass get smash off and stamp on by several people by accident em and i i manage to to fish them out and sort of em the frame be completely askew and em the lenses have come out and one of the nose pad have come off
S0173	oh no
S0054	i manage to kind of bodge it back together very unprofessionally and put the lenses back in em so by then i go to the optician the next day to put the nose pad back on which be a very cheap and easy procedure em and he say yeah sure come back in twenty minutes i do so and he go okay i'm really sorry about this but your glass kind of disintegrate when i when i try to do that but
S0173	so there be severe structural damage
S0054	yeah and i didn't tell him that that be because the previous night drink at the bar at the gig i be go come on you frame with the thing but em and very unprofessionally sort of hack it back into shape em
S0173	so you actually make it worse
S0054	i well i
S0173	nice
S0054	i i definitely well i think to be honest em i think they be beyond help they be very badly damage i've never damage i mean i've be wear glass now for like nineteen years and i have never damage them the most badly as that em so but but yeah it be great because because it actually snap while he be try to fix it and not me he say i'm really sorry have a free eye test and i'll pay for your glass up to the value of a hundred and twenty pound
S0173	oh nice oh that's amaze
S0069	that be good
S0054	which be great especially because i be due to need em some more glass in a few months' time anyway so i've literally just save myself there a hundred and fifty quid
S0173	that's brilliant that work out so well
S0054	yeah but yeah so em basically for the last week these be new today for the last week i be wear my old glass from about four years ago em and so that be a very different prescription so everything felt a bite wobbly then my eye adapt to that now i've get a new prescription which be four years newer so a little bite different and also a new type of lens which apparently take a while to get use to and sort of an entirely different shape and size and also the frame no longer go all the way round so i'm get this bizarre glare from the bottom of reflections it's it long and short of it be i feel drink
S0173	so do you think that if you actually drink alcohol you'd probably feel okay
S0054	that's what suggest em
S0173	like yeah even it up a bite
S0069	yeah
S0054	yeah well let's
S0069	we can test it out later
S0054	yeah we we can it's like i i have this theory that one of my friends em he have the most amaze bouncy way of walk he's sort of like tigger basically em and i always wonder that if he walk on a bouncy castle if he just walk like a normal person but it doesn't it's just like exacerbate things yeah and it's wonderful it's like he's do the hurdle or something it's it's it's glorious to watch
S0054	especially because he be one of the most ungainly clumsy people i know he's completely at home on a bouncy castle cos suddenly it's like it doesn't matter if i fall over
S0173	that sound hilarious ah i go the last i go on a bouncy castle be at a may ball
S0054	oh yes
S0173	em it be at may ball two thousand and ten and we be all wear obviously like ball dress and everyone be wear suit
S0054	yeah
S0173	and my ball dress because em for some reason i hadn't really get my head around the long ball dress thing and i get do you know the dress i wear to the fi and dan's wed it be like there be actually a picture of it on the laptop but anyway
S0069	yeah i'll know it
S0173	it's like like short with flower on
S0069	yeah
S0173	basically the point be that it be short and therefore not suitable for a bouncy castle
S0119	so you flash everyone then
S0173	i may have do
S0173	the
S0054	it should have come with a warn on that dress warn not suitable on bouncy castle
S0173	it should have do
S0119	warn your arse can be see
S0173	to be honest i didn't really read the label thoroughly so it may have contain that warn and i just like just overlook it so it could have be my own fault but anyway this be at about two be everyone have lot to drink and i just generally be exhaust em so i'm hop that no one nobody notice or just think it be part of the entertainment
S0119	part of the show
S0054	should have get a free ticket
S0119	nocturnal bouncy castle everyone always do that everyone do a back flip and then show their arse yeah you know
S0173	yeah luckily nobody make the mistake of take drink onto the bouncy castle which you would expect them to have do
S0069	yeah that's pretty good
S0054	well i think eh they tend not to allow you to eh i remember that selwyn may ball in two thousand and eight em they have the the best thing ever which be it it's a bouncy castle but they fill it with not not fill but like they they put load and load of those like playpen ball in like ball pit
S0054	so it's ball pit and bouncy castle and black tie
S0173	oh my yeah
S0069	oh wow
S0119	i have see a double side bouncy castle which be like double in both dimension and well it do have a circular ball pit in the middle and as well as bouncy castle it be great it be this
S0054	it but i genuinely
S0119	it be it be the best thing until someone i don't know why i fail i don't know who do it but i know someone someone do and it close the entire thing down but they take a bottle of ketchup with them on to it for some reason
S0119	just hold a squeezy bottle of ketchup and of course when lose control of his momentum in the air he just sort of like brrr and just squeeze down on the bottle of ketchup
S0054	oh i'm look forward to the transcriber try to spell that
S0119	yeah there's like tomato ketchup everywhere out of the squeezy bottle heinz all over the shop and yeah just horrify mess and yeah the proprietor be very upset because he buy it like two weeks before
S0054	oh and that be that be such a bugger to clean
S0119	yeah especially when you've get like you know an entire kit of playpen ball you've get to scoop out clean individually
S0054	yeah
S0173	oh yeah clean every single hose down
S0119	get your toothbrush out you know
S0054	no cos clean ball pit be genuinely quite difficult my my friend have a ball pit eh for a while in her room and and they do get
S0119	just cos
S0054	they get they get they get quite dirty em and em
S0173	yeah
S0054	you also end up lose a lot of stuff
S0173	earrings
S0054	yeah phone
S0173	money
S0054	em a lot of money
S0173	so there's probably a lot of valuable stuff on the bottom of the ball pit if you like dive down
S0069	yeah it's a bite of a bank
S0119	well it's like it's like sofa you know you just sit on the sofa and things vanish out your pocket
S0054	yeah
S0119	the ball pit be like active sofa removal of object
S0119	just sit down and all of a sudden it's like everything just slip straight out
S0054	it's it's like in my ideal house em there would be a room which be a ball pit em not entirely obviously and there would be a kind of like entrance where you could cos no shoe in the ball pit you take off your shoe then you sort of climb in like a swim pool kind of step but it it would be a glass floor and if you lose something you just go downstairs and go ah there it be
S0173	there it be pick it back up
S0173	actually my em friends do that
S0054	i like the way you're look as though there epiphany that's how i be i've be wonder why i hadn't solve this problem for years
S0173	when you design house
S0173	yeah my friends do that not with the glass floor though that would be difficult but with balloon they make their whole live room into a balloon ball pit
S0054	yeah
S0173	for a party
S0054	yes
S0069	that's cool
S0173	and it be like up till
S0054	love it
S0173	em neck height i'm but the problem with balloon be that they burst
S0119	yes
S0173	as soon as you're
S0069	yeah
S0054	well the one the one eh i i go once at a party in york where they do that with em the little polystyrene ball with the stuff that fill bean bag and they fill that and everything be knee high with that
S0119	it's impossible to get those things out of anything
S0054	it be and the that's the thing like we we be there and it be it be really really good fun but i mean you will find them about your person for the next week
S0069	oh god
S0119	yeah
S0054	and the the next the the the next day like we be all just there it be it be quite it be like my friend's twenty first birthday party and em eh so we all wake up the next day quite hang over there be like we be sleep in a in a different house and just like the polystyrene ball just everywhere all over clothe in pocket and then my brother just come out with the best line he just hang over come out of the toilet and just go i i just go to the toilet and i i mean i open my fly and there's no other way to say this all my ball fell out
S0173	oh dear
S0119	not quite a sort of good or numerous but you know when you get like someone who have eh put like confetti on a table especially when you have like little number for people's birthdays
S0054	yeah
S0069	mm
S0119	and they end up frigging everywhere and like if you've get any kind of mobile or live object like a cat for example who like

S0173	have you say that to me before
S0054	probably it's just my my only schrdinger's cat joke em oh apart from schrdinger's cat walk into a bar and doesn't but
S0173	yeah cos eh like my brain be like slowly work and i be think cat and physics schrdinger
S0054	yeah
S0173	that's all i know about it
S0054	yeah
S0173	i do know what it do at one point i think it be during my educate myself about science phase
S0054	i think that that guy have some really really good line
S0173	mm i kind of like his style like the way he be quite lay back about it
S0054	mm
S0173	and you weren't sure at first you be like be that a joke like oh that's really funny and
S0054	yeah
S0173	it slowly dawn on you so it be like slow speed comedy
S0054	yeah it's em i be worry about i didn't actually want to put him on last it's a it be a bite of a risk because it's the sort of sort of material which if the audience decide that they like it they will love it
S0173	and end on a good note
S0054	yeah whereas and it will be the highlight em but if it's if if the audience approach it like the first couple of joke with eh maybe then they're lose
S0173	yeah
S0054	it's a lose cause and the whole thing will die em i actually want the guy who end the first half the guy who start on the phone bite
S0173	yeah yeah
S0054	which i love that
S0119	he really he really act the whole thing
S0173	he be really good yeah
S0054	no indiscriminately
S0069	cos he be there be such a different like they be all such different style
S0054	mm
S0069	like he would so he clearly think about everything he be go to say and like he or that be just almost just his style
S0054	yeah
S0069	like his personality he just like he wouldn't sort of stutter or anything like that em whereas some of them be much more like high energy and sort of rush around
S0054	yeah richard the one with the purple hair he's very high energy
S0173	yeah
S0119	he's very purple hair and he
S0173	he's very in the air
S0054	he be and he's he's very difficult to calm down and actually like he he he'll he'll do a set and you go okay well that that be good but you know and you give some feedback and say well this bite eh drag on this bite you could have deliver funnier that kind of thing and he'll take it all on board and then not act on any of it
S0119	oh no
S0054	and he doesn't realise he's not act on any of it because when he's onstage he's essentially just be him but to
S0173	but more extreme yeah
S0054	or not even more extreme just he's actually almost try to tone himself down because if be up there just be himself he would abandon the script and just rant about whatever the hell not even rant that make him sound angry just rabbit on em so it's like he's try to tone down his own em craziness but as a result he he still kind of faffs around but not in a funny way and so you tell him not to do that and he doesn't realise when he's do it it's eh
S0173	so be he actually funnier when he's just be himself
S0054	em yes
S0173	so so but he's still not
S0054	he's actually a lot funnier not on stage
S0119	that's must be that's a really weird conundrum to have
S0054	yeah
S0069	yeah
S0173	but no isn't that the issue with stand up comedians there be some who be like have really good line and they're polish and then there be some who be just naturally hilarious people
S0054	yeah
S0069	yeah
S0173	and like everyone fall into one of those categories
S0054	yeah it's some comedians be famously really unfunny just as people like john cleese apparently like just like a really bore person to be around
S0119	he's a miserable sod
S0173	yeah i hear that he be miserable
S0054	and he's not funny at all em and he i i'm not very certain but i i have a deep suspicion that dylan moran be the same
S0173	yes yes
S0119	yes dylan moran dylan moran i i i'm i mean to but he seem to have a series of mask he can put on
S0054	mm
S0119	like he can put on his sort of act mask then he also have another mask of i be out of an act but i'm still on like if you ever see em one of his i think it's monster he have like a bite where he's be interview in his dress room
S0054	oh yeah
S0119	but it's kind of a level beyond his actual stand up in front of the camera where he's like he's he's get another mask over his visual one so it's like he's put on two different front and then it like cycle that it's very surreal to watch
S0054	well yeah what what what he's do be in in the context where normally that would be see behind the mask and see what he's what he's really like and what he's do be pretend that but actually it's a different mask
S0119	yeah
S0054	so yeah
S0119	it's like an it's like an additional it's like a additional sort of sub persona
S0054	yeah
S0119	on top of what he's already do
S0054	which be try to emphasise his onstage persona
S0119	yeah which be kind of crazy
S0173	see yeah i don't like there's too many mask too many personas like he just keep it simple
S0119	but he's still a funny man
S0069	yeah
S0054	my favourite comedians and they're the ones i essentially try to be like be the ones who come across onstage as be really genuine as as though they be just like people like dara o'briain and ed byrne em people who you watch them and you feel like it be almost just a conversation with them in the pub admittedly a very one side one but like they be just talk because they enjoy talk to you
S0173	talk yeah
S0054	as oppose to they're do a performance em and that's what i kind of go for
S0173	do you see that thing about meet dara o'briain
S0069	yeah it be weird
S0054	yeah i be just go to say
S0173	yeah our friend meet dara o'briain she go
S0069	in the pub in the isle of man
S0173	with her friend and who be like oh dara's just texted me he's come down we have no further detail than that
S0069	yeah and then it be like go she get back from the pub and then she say something like oh yeah i be at the pub with my friend like my friend and no be that i don't know
S0173	i think it be a different i think it be work whoever she be
S0069	right and friend dara come along from mock the week and be like oh
S0054	wow
S0173	the isle of man
S0054	the isle of man yeah well this be it
S0119	he he go there to get away like you know he go to ireland he get mob
S0069	maybe he be do it surely
S0173	yeah
S0054	it's always interest to notice so you're basically two link away from dara o'briain or be you three
S0173	two well if she's meet him two
S0054	well be it meet or know well
S0069	she's probably scar him off
S0069	that work quite a lot
S0054	a friend of mine meet dara o'briain just like he be just walk around a market i think and go you're dara o'briain and he go yes
S0054	and they
S0173	and that be it
S0054	and have a photo take with him and that be it apparently he's he's a really nice guy
S0173	i can imagine yeah
S0119	he do seem really likeable
S0054	and you really do get the impression partly because he do so much improv in his show you really do get the impression that that be just him have fun
S0173	yeah he's very natural
S0054	as oppose to him perform
S0069	yeah
S0119	i mean i i've see ed byrne before actually in the corn exchange
S0054	oh yeah
S0119	and it be basically an extend pub conversation
S0054	yeah
S0119	like he be wear sort of like you know he do a lot of hand motion and obviously this can't be transcribe but like hand motion out to the audience
S0054	yeah
S0119	like he be very sort of like and you and you and you and he'd sort of like go around and be very sort of like open and carry on em until he catch someone take a video of the
S0054	yeah and then he end up yeah
S0119	yeah i tell you about this before ooh it be so embarrass
S0173	oh no
S0119	but yeah i felt really bad for him but at the same time i be like ah you're derail your own show so eh
S0054	yeah
S0173	so he just start rant
S0119	he do he do he start rant he be like ah sell dvds as well i'm on youtube ah i it's oh god like don't go that mad you know
S0173	but he must be relatively successful so why be he
S0119	i know he seem to think he's not from his own mention of his own show he seem to think he's not
S0173	mm strange
S0054	yeah
S0119	yeah pretty embarrass
S0054	and that be that be such a shame because em also i i don't think that's much of a like phone videos on youtube awful to watch
S0173	mm
S0119	yeah but the thing the thing be that most
S0054	like nobody enjoy watch them
S0119	well the thing be that people
S0173	the the problem be actually people upload the professionally record things onto you tube
S0119	oh yeah
S0173	yeah
S0054	that's really the issue
S0119	yeah but also it's the fact that i mean the the thing be though you can say that they're awful but the thing be youtube especially see as the early days especially in the early days of youtube when it be like three sixty p or nothing or two forty p
S0054	yeah
S0119	which be garbage to look at like two forty by one sixty video be like look at a tea stain and say oh yeah it's the clangers so
S0054	eh that's metaphor
S0119	yeah so
S0054	wonderful wonderful
S0119	and i hope that go into a transcription somewhere this be not this be not how you use your metaphors children
S0119	you become like this insane man
S0119	well the the thing be you you'll you a lot of people be kind of use to youtube look like garbage but if the sound quality and video quality be okay they'll watch it like i have see people watch entire run of series at three sixty p resolution which look awful but they will watch it cos it's available and free
S0119	and it's right in and it's right in front of them
S0173	yeah
S0119	like it be literally in front of their face and they're like well i could've go down to hmv and nah and you know they've already and they're watch it right there
S0173	mm
S0119	so like it's one of those things we're so but i i don't really buy the argument of like oh this be why i'm in the poor house it's like no
S0173	because surely it just popularise his stuff like
S0119	well that's one argument you can take that's one of the thing that
S0173	so more people will go to see it live
S0054	and i and and also they they i don't know i don't really see that argument that he have because be i don't think the standa up comedians get much revenue from their dvd sales
S0119	i think he's em
S0054	like not compare to ticket sales
S0173	yeah
S0069	yeah
S0119	i think it's i think it's a nice bump though like it's a nice thing in the off season when you're relax
S0054	mm i mean it's not it's not quite as bad as music industry whereas if you where like if you buy an album for ten pound maybe two p be go to the band
S0119	yeah whereas you go to the
S0054	em it it it isn't quite that bad i imagine they do probably get like i don't know a quid for every dvd or something so but it's it would be a reasonable em proportion but compare to ticket sales that's that's why comedians tour you know
S0173	yeah
S0069	mm
S0054	that's where all of the money be generate
S0119	yeah
S0173	exactly they must spend much of it like on the road like
S0119	yeah
S0173	it must be quite difficult to like actually have a life
S0054	i i like i like what ed byrne say about this in an interview actually em he be ask like so so you're do like this you know hundred and fifty day tour or whatever em be be that like really exhaust and he go well kind of yeah but i don't really like it's it's it's a very small price to pay to do an awesome job like there be people do far harder job be far more exhaust i don't want to be sit here talk about oh it's so terrible work for two hours a night
S0173	yeah that's true
S0069	yeah
S0119	yeah
S0054	you know it's it it's it be a good point like sure it's exhaust but only as much as it's exhaust to travel you know
S0173	i've often wonder what people like stand up comedians and like even performers do in their daytime like i guess they have to rehearse especially stand up comedians because like they usually have a routine right but they probably don't vary all that much on tour
S0054	and there isn't much like sound check you have to do and stuff
S0173	yeah they don't have to like train or practice
S0054	mm
S0173	their line well you know
S0119	get rip
S0054	i think most of the time it's it's essentially a em the yeah they're all late starters and
S0054	and partially because i mean you you finish a gig at like half ten or something i mean
S0173	yeah
S0054	and that adrenaline kick be go to keep you awake till about two or three
S0069	so you get you end up get up like late morning or something
S0173	yeah
S0054	yeah em so you spend the day i think you know i get the impression on tour that the time which you don't spend literally travel in the car or on the train or whatever em you spend walk around the place that you're you've just arrive in
S0173	yeah
S0054	to get a feel for the place
S0069	yeah get the local newspaper and stuff
S0054	well yeah i mean that kind of stuff if if you have the time for press em em
S0173	so you can relate to your audience
S0054	yeah i mean a lot of comedians actively seek their first sort of four or five line that for that even show that afternoon em like they walk around and they talk about but the danger there be because you're unfamiliar with somewhere and you're look for material you'll probably end up just make an easy joke everyone's already hear like we all know that i don't know boot be upside down i i don't know it would what it would be you know like everyone would already know that thing which be obvious enough for that person to be make a joke
S0173	but then maybe that's fine cos maybe that help them to like maybe even though they know it's obvious it's just okay cos it help them establish a relationship
S0054	well it it depend on on the audience i mean it it some some people like you know predictable joke they almost prefer it if they could see it come that's why things like little britain be popular when they're gob shite
S0069	mm
S0054	and they em whereas em yeah i mean some people just really don't like hear an obvious joke
S0069	yeah it be just i don't know i think i vary between the two like if the obvious joke be really funny then that's fine even though it's obvious but
S0054	i think i think it's at how it's deliver
S0173	yeah
S0054	em like there's that mitchell and webb sketch the eh rocket scientist and the brain surgeon
S0173	yes yes yes
S0054	and you can see the joke come a million miles away but it's just deliver in such a way where they know you can see it come
S0173	yeah
S0054	and then they just
S0069	it's just so well set up
S0054	it's just deliver perfectly basically it yeah yeah
S0119	yeah i think it also depend on like em how conscious you be aware of it or how much you're i mean you might know it already but you might not actually give a crap about it and have it actually highlight be like oh that's oh wow okay
S0054	mm
S0119	so yeah i'm not i get the feel like cos i use i follow bill bailey on twitter for a good while em but i think he basically just go and eat scones for like his afternoon setup and he just go away and find a teashop and sit in that for a few hours
S0173	well he be from like devon or somewhere isn't he
S0119	point yeah
S0173	maybe it's some sort of
S0119	maybe he just like get beat into that sort of like yeah
S0173	yeah
S0119	you know
S0054	you do love stereotype
S0173	well he's from bristol
S0069	yes
S0119	of course
S0054	you do
S0173	definitely
S0054	i be read em dara o'briain's book oh on hang on guy
S0173	be it the number ten
S0119	the tenth the tenth wasabi pea
S0173	okay okay
S0069	so it be the tenth you'll like or the eleventh
S0173	ooh good question
S0054	be it after ten or on ten
S0173	i think you should have a second one just to be sure sorry an eleventh one just to be sure
S0069	well how do you feel about this one undecided
S0054	well i'm start to find them okay but i still wouldn't choose to eat them like
S0069	yeah try another one then
S0054	okay
S0069	yeah obviously not there yet
S0173	then you'll choose which one to finish the packet
S0069	you're not over that tip point
S0054	yeah
S0173	see i use to feel like that about wasabi i use to be like it's alright but it's a bite like unnecessary mouth pain isn't it but then suddenly i get hook like it's just like a a switch flip
S0069	it's just not yeah
S0054	yeah well it be
S0119	schrdinger no not schrdinger again em stockholm syndrome for food
S0119	the pain be good i like the pain
S0173	i do have i do have that with regard to wasabi and chillies i love chillies i'll put them in anything it hurt my mouth sometimes i'm just like this be really painful but i love it it's
S0119	no no they
S0054	phrase phrase
S0119	the chilli didn't beat me i fell down the stairs
S0173	and then sometimes i'm cut them and em like chilli juice on my finger and then stick it in my eye that's not a good kind of pain
S0054	i like the way you stick it like when on my god that's inconvenient arrghhh
S0173	yeah well rub my eye let's say
S0054	yes em
S0173	i'm probably not jab myself in the eye deliberately
S0054	yeah no i mean it's just the spicy thing i can i can handle eh handle that that spice it's i it's just the flavour of the spice i'm just not so fond of horseradish em
S0173	that's the thing yeah
S0054	i quite like that it if if the cos some of those have be really strong and some of them haven't be em and the ones which haven't be so strong i've really like the sort of underlie flavour
S0069	hit the the yeah the general
S0054	hit the actual pea basically
S0069	yeah
S0054	and em
S0069	the desiccate pea
S0054	yeah
S0173	it sound awful but it's just amaze i don't know how but horseradish right i've never have horseradish partly because we be never give beef like my family didn't eat any beef when i be young because of bse em and so we never have horseradish or beef and so i've never have it i only have horseradish in wasabi
S0054	yeah
S0173	do it kind of taste the same but white
S0054	it's the i i i honestly don't know because i don't like it so i don't eat it em
S0173	mm that make sense
S0069	no who do eat horseradish
S0173	i don't know
S0119	my dad
S0054	only freak
S0119	oi
S0173	do he eat it with beef or just out the jar
S0119	no he eat it with beef eh generally
S0054	i like the way you won't go urgh but then you do that with marmite em
S0119	marmite be good shut up
S0173	what you eat marmite out the jar
S0119	no i don't i do not what be i i'm be slander here
S0173	eat nutella out of the jar eat peanut butter out of the jar be normal but
S0119	no it's not why would you eat peanut butter out of the jar you need you need something to cut it with
S0173	cos it's amaze okay nutella
S0069	yeah yeah
S0119	okay yeah but that's kind of go on a bad that's go down a bad slope
S0173	yeah it be it's a massive jar
S0119	it's not the same as like eat it's not like it's not the same as eat like cake mix by the spoonful that's
S0173	that's pretty amaze
S0069	oh that's good yeah
S0119	that's that's require
S0119	it's it's brilliant it's actually nicer than the final product
S0069	it be it really be
S0119	ah yeah you can you can tell when a you can tell whenever someone's have killjoy parent cos he'll say but you'll get salmonella and it's like no your parent lie to you cos they be eat your cake mix while you starve
S0119	you've you've be deprive as a child
S0069	i think i don't believe that cos my mum always use to say that to me but no one ever tell me about the lion stamp mean that it be salmonella free
S0119	yeah
S0069	so i do get deprive and now i'll make up for it
S0119	and now and now you know your mum be hog all the cake mix
S0054	you see i be always when whenever em when eh yeah this be this be just i i i genuinely have completely forget about this just years and years ago eh whenever my mum be bake eh bake cake it be em we have to do it take it in turn between me and my brother who be allow to you know lick the bowl out
S0173	lick the spoon
S0069	lick the bowl yeah
S0054	lick the spoon and it be em like you know like a massive fun there be always so much leave it be so good
S0069	yeah it be really good yeah
S0119	yeah
S0054	and that be just me for half an hour
S0173	do you think your mum use to deliberately leave bits like leave plenty for you
S0054	i think she probably do because you'd look it and go and you could totally get another cake out of that
S0119	yeah
S0173	so basically just have some cake mix for dinner not process
S0069	good idea
S0054	yeah eh well i i think it be just a way of be certain that i would shut up for twenty minutes
S0119	probably why she bake so often
S0173	yeah
S0054	i i can't i can't confirm but i think i be a bloody irritate child
S0054	em i i i'm assume this because i think most children be bloody irritate and i be a talkative little git so em
S0173	if you're ask your you you have a brother and sister right if you ask them would they say that you be the loudest
S0054	well yes definitely i i be i always have the reputation of be the talkative one like far too talkative
S0069	be you the oldest
S0054	youngest
S0069	oh
S0119	get to make up for the age
S0054	but eh em yeah
S0119	hammer on
S0054	well well my brother be always the slightly more sort of peculiar one especially when it come to to food he he spend the first well after from the age of about sort of four till about sixteen he only eat peanut butter sandwich and freeze chip
S0069	that's not good
S0054	not even cook chip
S0173	didn't your mum like force fee him vegetables
S0054	try and fail he just wouldn't try anything new he's still quite bad at it but get better em he's sort of i i remember when he finally try pizza eh for the first time
S0119	how can he not eat pizza
S0054	and think well then he he he decide mm i sort of like it i know i'll keep eat it i'll force myself to have to like it so i can eat something at uni em that be in for the first year of uni he just eat chip and pizza basically
S0119	jesus
S0054	em now he's more into em vegetables and particularly chinese food stir fry and stuff but he's vegetarian not because of any ethical thing or not like meat he's just simply scar of try out new things and it's just easy to define himself as vegetarian because that mean he doesn't need to try these things
S0119	he doesn't need to explain the fact that yeah i'm a picky git
S0054	yeah
S0173	you could also probably rule out mm no i suppose there's gluten in bread mm i'm try to think if there be any other dairy oh dairy if there's cheese on pizza
S0054	oh he love cheese so well he love bland cheese and it have to be just cheddar or or mozzarella
S0173	all that weird cheese that you get in america that doesn't that's sort of mozzarella but be really just plastic
S0119	american cheese
S0173	exactly american cheese
S0119	squeezy cheese
S0173	yeah
S0119	aerosol can cheese
S0173	so he wouldn't eat like stilton or something
S0054	oh god i mean i i also hate that but em no he he wouldn't ever try em a new cheese because he he doesn't he never like try things
S0173	that's awkward
S0054	and yeah he's get a bite better he now he be like in his twenties but so you know
S0173	oh like if i'd be that picky i just would have starve
S0054	yeah
S0173	because my mum be just like you've get to eat what's
S0069	yeah
S0173	what's in front of you
S0054	yeah
S0173	so
S0069	like it or lump it
S0173	yeah exactly and
S0119	and i i i do that my mum try that for a good few years until she eventually realise like this stupid kid be not actually gonna bend much so it just kinda become that my house get fill with stuff i do eat like cucumber and carrots
S0054	cucumber
S0173	well good things
S0054	cucumber that's the other thing that my brother eat load of em
S0119	it's good
S0054	genuinely he and em an an entire cucumber just just nibble through as a snack
S0119	okay i couldn't do that much
S0173	but that's fine though
S0054	but to be fair i kind of occasionally do the same it's really good although i don't any more cos my fridge at home freeze cucumbers it freeze lot of things but cucumber be particularly vulnerable which be sad
S0173	well i'm glad to hear that he be get some kind of like roughage and vegetable intake during his teenage years
S0069	yeah
S0054	yeah
S0173	or whole life
S0119	back back up for a decade
S0054	yeah my my dad use to only semi joke that all the textbooks say he should have die already em and i i hope by that he mean the biological medicine textbooks as oppose to the ones on like ethics
S0173	yeah
S0119	the a horrible histories textbook there's a horrible histories textbook that say you should have die

S0173	come on that's a pretty catchy manifesto
S0054	let's talk about cake be you you'll get elect
S0173	yeah yeah
S0054	over for what be it for em
S0119	let's
S0054	an exhilarate but short life
S0119	hey who say that a exhilarate life would not involve cake it would involve cake
S0173	it would have to involve cake well
S0119	yeah look for a high speed exhilarate cake
S0119	a muffin cover in frost fly in your face constantly
S0054	just that's just remind me of that brilliant dylan moran bite where he say hil have you ever have venison before and she say em sort of so what do you mean be it like in a speed car you've get one leg in do you chew it and then spit it out what happen
S0173	have cake like shove into your face be probably not as fun as actually like take your time to eat it i don't know it's never happen to me but em yeah em
S0173	i'm make an an excite cake later in the week well it's not excite em it's just different in that it contain mostly figs like dry figs so i get a recipe book for my birthday em which i probably tell about but em basically this massive thick
S0119	be it like an entire family thing where everyone just keep give you book
S0069	oh dear
S0173	em no will get me them they're like em from the restaurant call leon which be in london and there's quite a few of it like of of different leon restaurants
S0054	quite a few of it right the whole grammar thing which we're try to represent here
S0173	grammar who need grammar
S0119	hey stop it you've get to its get to be natural
S0173	who need grammar anyway em
S0054	us
S0173	i'm from the north you should know
S0119	we do have the pedant here so you know
S0054	yes i'm from the north but i also know grammar
S0173	it's hard to do both things at at once anyway my cake be be make up mostly of figs and em also red wine and spell flour
S0119	what
S0173	it's really it's it's i know
S0069	oh wow it sound really nice
S0173	like well that's the thing as i'm go to make this cake i don't know what i'm go to do with it i be think that i should bring it to work then i be think maybe it's too weird for work em and then i be also think cos it's birthday be on wednesday i should probably make it for him for his birthday but also it's probably too weird for a birthday cake so i don't really know what i'm go to do with it
S0054	it need a context free trial run
S0119	yeah
S0173	can you suggest such a context free run
S0119	how about your mem
S0054	well a context free trial run literally mean just bake it and see if it's good
S0119	what
S0173	well i definitely plan to do that that's my usual routine of cake make
S0054	yeah
S0119	so you have to just you have you've start make two cake at one just to sort of stop yourself
S0173	mm no
S0054	i i think i think that
S0119	the defence cake and the a and you know the the the the shield cake which will stop you from eat both
S0173	well sometimes if i have a different mixture i do what mum should have do and make a little mini cake
S0119	oh yeah that sound good
S0069	oh
S0054	yeah
S0173	well then i get to eat it
S0119	go back to that very briefly oh go back to that very briefly the worst part of my childhood be when my mom get a silicon spatula which can actually like conform to the edge of the
S0173	oh no
S0054	silicone spatula sound like a band name
S0119	yeah it's it's also a but
S0054	oh yeah that's the next thing isn't it
S0119	yeah whoop
S0054	yeah
S0119	so what she get a spatula that basically conform to the side of this the the em bowl so you'd scoop up everything instead of have a wooden spoon that miss load of bits so you can eat it
S0119	so my mum's like here's the bowl and it's like there's fuck nothing in here what be you do to me you're kill me here
S0173	that's why you get to make your own ones
S0069	he swear
S0119	yeah that's how i start so i'm like well if you won't give me mixture i'll have a to make my own cake mixture maybe cake out of it maybe i'll just get fat let's find out
S0173	i saw some i be in john lewis yesterday eh the other day and i saw some cake like easter egg cake mould i be like surely that easter egg mould but they weren't they be for like part of this commercialization of easter you know try and make everything like an easter egg and you can make an easter egg cake but i'm not sure if you're suppose to put the two halve together or what to decorate it or what
S0119	it's just an excuse to have em ice which any excuse for ice will give an excuse for ice
S0173	it do well i think that's a good excuse for john to for john lewis to not john excuse i be go as i be go to say to make eh
S0119	that's his scanky brother
S0173	yeah
S0054	yeah who be less successful and just keep
S0119	well you know i do my best give me a break you know
S0054	like oh you know i i didn't have as good teachers and
S0173	be that what they say in scouse land
S0054	what
S0173	what be you talk about
S0054	i try to come up with the good excuse never mind
S0119	anyway cake back to cake
S0173	never mind back to cake be always the fail safe option em yeah so anyway em easter egg cake anyone
S0119	imagine you could have like a cos you can have a cream egg of a like cake shell with like butter ice in the middle so it'd like an it'd be like an inverse cake kind of
S0054	have you ever do that thing where you get a whole easter egg and fill it with in the like stuff in the cream egg so you have a giant cream egg
S0119	god no i'd have a heart attack
S0054	it's
S0173	how would you do that
S0069	really
S0173	like can you just buy cream egg inside
S0054	we we get absolutely load of cream egg and spoon out the ice in the middle and fill
S0173	but then you essentially have the same thing you have lot of chocolate and a cream fill chocolate shell
S0054	yeah
S0069	isn't that the same as have lot of cream egg
S0054	well well well well obviously yes but we be make it it's it's the whole pimp my snack thing
S0173	oh yeah
S0054	have you never see pimp my snack
S0119	that be the dumbest thing
S0173	it be a big thing on the on on the internet like a couple of years ago or something just make giant giant giant versions of
S0119	not not don't care
S0173	giant kit kat chunky
S0054	yeah yeah
S0173	like yeah gaint kit kat kit kat chunkys
S0054	it be really cool but yeah so we make it and it be properly disgust
S0069	be it
S0119	it sound like it sound like some sort of terror
S0054	that that cream stuff be really really tasty in the quantity you have it
S0173	cos it's like sugar
S0054	once you start experience it in any way touch it smell it see it em taste it in any way once once you have it in large quantity it's just i couldn't eat it those egg for a year
S0173	how do you like do you just cut them open and spoon it out
S0054	mm
S0173	okay
S0054	it take a long time and then we just realise like why be we do this and then someone else say well because we're sixteen and we get nothing else to do
S0173	it's better than go out drink on the streets
S0119	and you haven't get high speed internet line yet
S0054	we didn't even have internet till i be sixteen
S0173	plus you be in durham i'm allow to say that
S0054	you be not allow to say that
S0173	why i'm i not allow to say that i live somewhere even more than durham okay fair enough
S0119	you climb out
S0173	actually i like durham it's very nice
S0054	durham be beautiful but em it it doesn't have a lot in the way of stuff to do
S0173	hence the cream egg thing
S0054	yeah but equally i'm not really sure how anywhere else have more stuff to do if you know what i mean like
S0173	what about london
S0054	well well
S0119	even though you have to pay for it so it's
S0054	exactly basically for a sixteen year old you just want like free stuff to do cos you don't have any money
S0119	and your parent won't give you any cos you'll just be you'll just keep siphon it off of them
S0173	you must have a lot of money to buy all those cream egg though
S0054	we save up for about a month
S0119	pocket money
S0054	yeah no i do i do i do have a job when i be sixteen but i i save it all up to em
S0119	do something really dumb
S0054	well i in in the end how it turn out i spend most of it on be unemployed while i it while i be in between job and come
S0173	what be your job
S0054	em before eh this one it be eh sidney sussex in the admissions office and that be just a two month placement
S0173	what about the one when you be sixteen
S0054	oh that i be work in a go cart centre
S0119	oh wow
S0173	something to do
S0054	sound sound so much cooler than it be
S0173	stuff to do
S0054	no it wasn't actively not it be
S0119	isn't most of it just like rebuild tyre wall when idiots climb and smash into them
S0054	yeah yeah i be i be just marshal em
S0069	you didn't get free rid
S0119	no it be really go cart be not fun isn't it
S0054	go cart be amaze
S0119	no they're not
S0054	i be never allow to drive them
S0173	i want to go go cart
S0069	yeah
S0054	except for the pit way to the garage which be the bite with no corner
S0173	plos trip go cart
S0069	plos trip
S0119	i mean it's not it's not like you know
S0054	we totally you should go cart it be the most fun
S0119	how about bowl bowl be good though
S0054	no cart
S0119	i can't i can't i i literally cannot do cart
S0173	be that because you're too tall for a cart
S0119	no it's because i have no like space awareness whatsoever
S0069	do you drive
S0173	yeah isn't it like
S0119	god no
S0069	oh
S0173	i be gonna say isn't it like drive
S0054	it's
S0119	i can't drive and i
S0054	i absolutely i haven't be cart for far too long i love it
S0069	i've never be cart
S0173	i've never be cart
S0069	oh yeah come on let's get it do
S0119	i i i go cart once before and it be kind of where i show eh come apparent that i can't cart to save my like but like me and my bunch of friends for my mate's em seventeenth we go and purchase a hundred lap around the track and that be our like that be his birthday party be a hundred lap on the go cart track
S0173	a hundred lap that actually sound like it would take quite a long time
S0054	a a hundred lap be
S0119	it do i get to i get i get i get to seventy four and say fuck and leave cos i i di
S0069	it sound be a bite dull actually
S0054	i you would have to you can't do that like em in one stint
S0173	yeah
S0054	because it would for one thing actually require very significant physical fitness
S0119	well yeah well my friend my friend do it and he be like kinda physical it it be weird and i be like physically fit and so be he but he be destroy because of some he have crazy like sort of chest issue that would take me another half an hour to explain which would be bore but
S0054	mm
S0119	basically like most of my friends could do it but i just i sort of out and say no i can't do this i keep run me into wall every three turn and it's make the want to kill me
S0173	be it just like steer round wall and round be it like an obstacle course
S0054	well if if it's if it's indoors yeah there be tyre barriers eh outdoors there be strategically place tyre barriers where most people crash but em yeah
S0119	tyre barrier tyre barrier of best fit
S0173	strategically i e in the way
S0054	yeah but em yeah it's cart be em if you if you go reasonably fast em it it's very painful like you always get get out and there's just bruise everywhere
S0119	mm
S0054	because the force the g force be like quite quite something
S0119	and they're not exactly
S0054	and if you're not properly push it and be aggressive my brother em do go cart for em for at at university he be like president of the club and stuff
S0173	go cart society
S0054	yeah and em and do all of the race against all the other universities and stuff i would have do it at cambridge but a it's really expensive he literally just spend all his money on it and em i just didn't have time because cambridge be horrible
S0054	em i love cart
S0173	em do your brother like it because do he work there as well or do he just like it
S0054	yeah
S0173	yeah
S0054	yeah he also work at the cart centre it be the actual work be really really bore em it be literally just push people out of barriers when they crash and they be normally hang over or drink stag party
S0173	oh yeah oh that's like when i go paintballing in the summer like the there we be the only other group there and there be a stag party can't remember what the other one be like a office thingy or something like that where we just
S0119	team build
S0173	team build exactly we just do it from a groupon thing which be brilliant cos it be like five quid for two hundred paint ball which be amaze and i yeah that involve lot of bruise as well
S0119	yeah paintball be
S0054	yeah paintballing have never quite appeal to me in the same way as because
S0119	no
S0173	i want to try it
S0054	yeah
S0173	and try it i probably wouldn't do it again unless it be the same price or less
S0054	alright okay
S0173	or free basically
S0054	yeah
S0119	yeah i mean i do paintballing as well it be actually with the same friend who be into these sort of things obviously but em we go paintballing and you never really understand quite how painful it be to actually have a paintballs especially like most of its kind of okay because you've get a big jacket a big puffy jacket on
S0054	yeah
S0119	but most of your extremities or things that be bruise easily be expose like say your elbow
S0054	oh yeah
S0173	the top of your head
S0119	yeah
S0173	i get a green paintball it like skim over but enough to explode and like cover the top of my head with green paint
S0119	especially your because me and my friend we be like sixteen and completely stupid we mostly just like we we kind of like picture of stupid video game addict kid who think like you know we play a lot which be like a first person shooter where
S0054	mm
S0119	if you get shoot and die you just go to a chat window like you don't actually see your guy keel over or go ah or die or anything it's just like beep and you're in a chat window and you can go ha ha i die and just kind of wait for the other guy to kill them kill each other so you know there be kind of lot of lot of disconnect obviously and then give these like paintball gun and it's like sweet we're totally cool and then like of course like no trigger discipline whatsoever so people just like shoot massive bullets of paintballs like into people so it's sort of like you can be hit by one or five usually
S0054	yeah
S0119	so it would be like you get hit by three in your chest and go okay that's fine that wind me a bite two on your arm it's like ah and you just sort of like double over go like don't hit me again
S0173	yeah
S0119	and one of my friends have a brilliant idea of try to be a sniper which like paintball gun be not accurate whatsoever like in any way because they're kind of just all over the place and he like sneak up a tree and he be sit there try to snipe people horribly fail and as soon as he shoot someone everyone know where he be
S0173	yeah
S0119	and we we decide to it's like punish him for his hubris of try to be mr cool elite sniper man so we shoot him in the nadgers
S0119	by accident
S0054	that's that's the best end to any anecdote on that note i think we've be go for about a hour
S0119	no no we're still go we've get five more minutes
S0054	five more minutes okay
S0119	but i but it be it be the thing where like he he'd actually see this come and have a cup on cos he be like i know you guy would try and hit me in the nads and it be like damn em but he but we do hit him in the knees a few time and he couldn't really walk
S0173	knees ooh
S0119	he couldn't even walk straight for a while because he get he get like one welt just underneath his kneecap and so it hurt like hell when he would bend his knee in any fashion for the next two days it be kind of crazy and we never do paintballing again because there'll always be like one voice of reason who would rise up in the group and say like but that's really painful
S0054	yeah
S0119	and we'd all remember the bruise and the pain that mild sort of grumble
S0054	yeah
S0119	you know that sort of thing and like especially see as like i remember we have to do the pe and our teacher would just laugh at us he be like ah you're all idiots what be you do you don't go paintballing ha ha ha yeah
S0173	your teacher laugh at you that's terrible
S0119	he be he be a he be a very em ribald sort of just jolly chap who love take the piss out of his students he be the pe teacher what do you expect
S0054	yeah that's pretty much it
S0173	well yeah
S0119	he be also my english teacher it be the most weird sort of like split character you could have yeah
S0173	that be weird do he like combine the two and shout shakespeare at you when you be try to play rugby
S0119	he do whack people on the head with a copy of twelfth night at time if they if he think they didn't have passion for the work which be a lot because twelfth night be crap
S0054	because i i find that my my passion for something be only improve if someone bludgeon me with it
S0119	well it's all bludgeon
S0173	sarc mark
S0054	thank you
S0173	oh no
S0054	so so why do you hang around with claire well she's my portable punctuation
S0119	well you get you just down the you're just down at the pub
S0069	oh i could really do with one of them
S0119	she just she just sort of just stand there next to you and and say interrobang
S0173	that would be amaze that's totally my ideal job how much will you pay me
S0173	i like that link
S0119	i give you a full
S0054	occasional wasabi peas
S0173	yes occasional wasabi peas
S0119	yeah a packet of haribo a day
S0173	em yeah that link that you send around unnecessary quote that be brilliant
S0054	oh that's it it be it be my favourite thing to do especially on menus
S0119	i be send that as well it's a tumblr
S0173	yes yes
S0054	it be so much fun
S0119	it's a tumblr of em just quote put in place where they don't need to be so something like it be like it will say the the
S0054	quotation mark
S0119	yes quotation mark round round things they shouldn't be like but they be try to say free coffee but it be free in quotation mark
S0173	so what do i have to do to get this coffee
S0119	it come across as like free coffee it's like what
S0173	which be just highly suspicious
S0119	yeah
S0173	there be on the van like the van it say plumber like what be a
S0054	yeah yeah your neighbourhood plumber
S0173	yeah
S0119	the easy thing be imagine he's some sort of sarcastic prat
S0054	yeah
S0119	sort of like you know do the actual like air quote while you say
S0054	it it be great fun to i i want em like eh quotation mark the stickers and put them on an advert i think it would just
S0173	that would be really difficult to do yeah
S0054	it's it's a little bite like the whole the x k c d thing of put like put actual size on eh on all advert
S0119	i love it i want to do that
S0054	which be again another of those x k c d things they steal from well they didn't steal from me but i also think of it
S0119	yeah
S0054	slightly later but before i saw it
S0119	randel what's his face be on your wavelength these actively can't siphon it
S0054	yeah he be
S0119	well it's like it's like the one where
S0054	i think if i if i meet randel munroe we would get on very well
S0119	well he also love ball pit so you'll be you'd be on the same wavelength
S0054	yeah
S0119	but i remember there be there be one where like it say you could put on fake like sort of like accolades on products and like everyone else would have you do it like if you have some cereal and you put one hundred percent fat free it will
S0054	yeah
S0119	if you put a product that doesn't doesn't naturally have any fat take out or something that wouldn't be fatty to begin with and you
S0173	like coke
S0054	say that
S0119	and you put yeah and you put fat free on it everyone else in the market place everyone look at it think well the other ones must have fat in then obviously
S0054	yeah
S0119	so everyone else have to do the same thing
S0054	it's it's exactly what i say actually in eh eh em the begin of my set last night about em the
S0119	i think i be get that from somewhere
S0054	the the carling advert which say a hundred percent british hop and every beer that's brew in this country which be most mass produce lagers use a hundred percent british hop because to import them be nut we have a perfect climate for grow them here
S0119	yeah we have
S0054	we grow we grow and also the ones which be grow elsewhere be hop better suit to european style
S0054	i mean of course you're market it to british people of course you're gonna use british hop but
S0119	well it's like say eh you know when you make like guinness it's like oh yeah we use water from the liffy it's like you don't use what from the freak lithy you're make not guinness
S0054	yeah
S0173	yeah but why be you import water when you've get it yourself
S0119	yeah well that's the whole point yeah
S0054	cos the the implication in there be that em like someone as though they be previously not do that and so someone's go guy i think this be wrong i think what people want be for us to change our policy yes you're right let's change it and then let everyone know that we've change our policy to the better one yes let's do that because we be a conscientious company whereas actually be them go what can we say that we already do basically not invest at all but make more money mm well
S0173	well mm
S0119	we can appeal to brainless nationalism do
S0054	yeah
S0173	i be gonna say it's it's the nationalism
S0054	yeah
S0173	side of things
S0054	but then that's the slogan you don't have to go far for a better beer
S0173	that's brilliant
S0054	oh
S0119	yeah for two two two of
S0054	oh it's it's nothing nothing work better than anadin all over again
S0069	how do they not pick up on that how
S0054	i i think the only possible way that ambiguity could have go unchecked be if like in the board meet there be some people who be like yeah i think that that's really good it's really it really get the message across and there be like two or three people that be just go
S0173	snigger
S0054	and just like make eye contact and go i wanna see this shit happen
S0173	yeah because you presume that
S0119	they're already make their spoof blog
S0173	like if they've get that high up in the company
S0054	i'm buy me one of those coasters
S0173	they should be reasonably intelligent
S0054	yeah if if they're that high up in a
S0069	really
S0054	successful company they they should especially if your job be in like all of these slogans be always over think to the extent where it's just mind numb
S0173	so it's it's like what's that phrase be it you can't see the wood for the tree
S0054	yeah yeah
S0173	yeah when
S0119	it come overly
S0054	it must it must have be yeah
S0173	you need a second look to come and like
S0054	but you just need one person to come in and go no
S0173	yeah
S0054	like it's such an obvious i can
S0173	but that person have to be a powerful person
S0054	yeah
S0173	i suppose
S0054	otherwise they'll go like oh no no you're not see what we're see
S0119	well they have to be sanction by market as an outside observer you can have people who just come in and say well no and they can be you know people who be not it i mean it's one of the it's one of the things where you have to perfect an echo chamber at any cost because if with the same idea cycle cycle cycle like if something become become know as the thing de jour and everyone start parrot it it just turn to l and everyone just do the exact same thing
S0173	yeah
S0119	and we're we we've fill up our time
S0069	yeah
S0173	yey press stop
S0054	good
