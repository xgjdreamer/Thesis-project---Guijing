S0666	mm mm it's a hard one be it
S0493	no well oh it's very it's clever this game
S0604	couldn't it be though more fun and you know instead of like like be time like we both have to come up
S0493	yeah yeah you could there's a there's a timer
S0604	yeah but you know i could be think of one you at the same time and whoever
S0493	well yeah well you should see this now anyway
S0604	okay
S0493	because we're gonna use the same one
S0604	but you know
S0493	and
S0604	just so there's not sort of
S0493	mum if you mum if you wanna change seat with me or you wanna move opposite then you you should be do the same thing so i'll but that's from my perspective or unless you wanna change it now and it's always that never mind
S0604	no that's fine
S0493	okay so do it from my perspective yeah
S0604	yeah
S0493	okay
S0604	oh so
S0493	so i be look at it like that
S0604	so i have to turn it when i
S0493	shall we just put it this way then and i'll have to look at everything again
S0604	okay
S0493	okay
S0604	it's not because you weren't happy with your
S0493	no no i'm
S0604	and be be that that now it's not across
S0493	that's that's the bottom row there
S0604	oh
S0493	mm okay okay there mother nice easy start
S0666	yeah
S0493	let's say chichen itza two chichen itza
S0666	mm mm
S0493	two
S0666	okay
S0493	so so now you just tap them with your finger when you're sure
S0666	oh
S0493	okey doke so if you're wrong i'll put whatever card i should put on it but obviously we're blue so
S0666	mm mm
S0493	that's correct and if i put the black on it we've lose the game if we put a neutral on it not brilliant not a nightmare if i put
S0666	yeah
S0493	the red on it then we give three point
S0666	okay
S0604	you want neutrals as well though right
S0493	no
S0604	you don't
S0493	a neutral mean that a you're eliminate a
S0666	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0493	a potential one someone else but it's not a disaster
S0604	okay
S0492	mm mm
S0604	live oh no do little three
S0604	a really good clue
S0492	i be think then about the film and i be like what dr dolittle eh erm three doctor oh no
S0604	you can talk
S0492	okay
S0604	what be you think
S0492	er i'm well your dr dolittle
S0604	mm
S0492	i'm think definitely doctor cat and bat i be think whale but i pretty sure he didn't do anything to help whale
S0492	nor dinosaurs so logically as a be he a vet or be he just a
S0493	you can't you you can't
S0492	oh
S0493	say anything and you can't look er in any way
S0492	alright then so doctor cat bat
S0604	and can you put a blue on that
S0492	ah
S0666	get one for cat
S0604	yeah
S0492	oh dear
S0493	mm
S0604	so that be my fault i didn't see cow over there
S0492	ah
S0666	saw whale
S0492	do you see whale oh you can't tell me
S0666	no mm
S0492	okay
S0666	oh dear
S0493	alright then mother
S0666	yeah
S0493	tan
S0666	tan
S0493	no no i'm not
S0666	okay
S0493	gonna say it now cos i've say it tan two
S0666	that's quite hard because we're in wales or be we and in wales fire be tan you could get a tan if you go to greece you get a tan on the beach but then if you have a spray tan you'd go orange so it's expand it
S0493	very good
S0492	mm
S0666	more i can see more than two
S0493	tan two
S0666	that's not help be it oh we've also get fighter fire fighter
S0493	mm
S0666	mm okay tan okay then okay so i'm go beach and greece think that you're not think of welsh word
S0493	okay
S0666	mm
S0604	mm
S0666	mm
S0604	so
S0492	why can that be neutral and not wrong
S0493	cos it just
S0492	oh right okay
S0493	if so in the future if i say octopus two and it you find tentacle and you find or whatever they're call you can also go oh no he be right about fire or he be right about orange or he be about about whale and put a blue on a on a card that you think be right even though that's not for the clue so next go if i say something two you can put three card down you can put the two i'm look for and you can
S0666	oh
S0493	pick the one
S0666	why didn't you tell me that before
S0493	i don't know okay
S0666	okay
S0604	mm mm mm mm oh erm construction three
S0492	okay so construction yard construction you build a bridge construction deck mm maybe not user hook okay i'm gonna think i think construction yard and er you construct a bridge and i'm you say three and then hook possibly er could be do you say i can choose extras
S0493	you can go you could you can choose four
S0492	right okay do that lose me any point or be it worth do that
S0493	it's worth do it if you're right if you're wrong then there's you'll like
S0492	oh right okay oh no right okay so yard bridge hook
S0604	and this yeah
S0492	oh okay well that's better than
S0493	okay then
S0492	oh what else be construction
S0493	mother
S0666	yeah
S0604	not not a great clue
S0493	quite difficult this be
S0666	it be
S0493	okay hang on then lightning two
S0666	conductor bolt
S0493	oh sorry it's my fault oh sorry okay you've get a chance to do another you've get a chance to do three things if you want you've get a chance to do another clue if you want
S0666	to pick another one that go with lightning
S0493	ah in other word base on what i've say or base on what i've say before
S0666	another two
S0493	no you can do one more
S0666	oh yeah
S0493	that be tan
S0493	but i didn't see anyway
S0604	go on then tree mm no
S0604	i've say it now erm tree
S0604	two
S0492	spring do tree come to life probably not orange tree yes in the park you'd find tree erm be any of them possibly to do with construction not really what be the one before construction you give me the other clue
S0604	erm
S0666	doctor
S0604	yeah
S0492	oh dolittle
S0666	oh dolittle
S0492	no
S0666	oh
S0492	i can't can't put that either i don't reckon you'd think orange tree i think you'd go spring and park oh
S0604	erm yeah it's there neutral one yeah you're absolutely right to think tree and park cos that's logical
S0493	so we could win the game now if we get a three
S0666	mm mm
S0493	oh and they've get a two
S0492	the way i'm go that's quite likely not do very well
S0604	now it's me
S0493	blackbeard two
S0492	what do you just
S0493	see i just eight others
S0493	that could relate to blackbeard
S0666	smuggler fighter
S0493	be that your final answer
S0666	be i allow to give any more
S0493	yeah
S0666	no i'm leave it at that
S0493	black beard black beard
S0493	black beard where do we see a beard
S0604	don't know it's
S0493	i do not see him as a fighter
S0493	at all
S0604	of course he
S0604	he's not a lover be he
S0493	also you've get deck there as well haven't you
S0666	yeah
S0493	and he be famously a pirate
S0493	and that tan i didn't see greece or orange
S0493	i just don't see them
S0492	do
S0493	do you girls want a go
S0492	do
S0492	do tan mean fire then
S0493	in welsh
S0604	yeah
S0493	sam tan
S0493	but also in the
S0492	oh so it's sam tan
S0493	in the rule
S0492	sam fire
S0604	fireman sam
S0493	yeah
S0492	well what's
S0604	yeah
S0493	right
S0492	what's fireman then
S0493	but in a lot in wales especially like like you know ivor the engine
S0492	yeah
S0493	like your name if you be the brakesman you would be brake
S0492	yeah yeah yeah
S0493	or what's the one in the caf√© anyway you would be your name plus not necessarily your profession but what you've deal with
S0492	oh
S0493	like
S0492	okay
S0493	johnny coal if he be coal deliverer rather than johnny the coal deliverer
S0492	so that's why he's sam tan
S0493	so but in the rule i couldn't have go fire because then would have
S0492	yeah
S0493	cos otherwise you'd have three clue and there would be paris
S0492	yeah
S0493	and you'd go and you'd do it in a ridiculous french accent
S0492	okay
S0493	why don't you girls
S0666	no
S0493	have a go
S0666	no
S0493	be you sure it'll be funny
S0666	no i'm sure it would be
S0493	oh go on
S0492	yeah go on we can do it
S0666	no
S0493	go on
S0666	no no
S0493	you can do it
S0666	no no no
S0493	five minutes now there'll be new word
S0666	no
S0666	go on then
S0666	and then i'm go to bed
S0493	last one then so so hang on a second so just chuck them back so you can hang on mum so that's what me and be look at
S0666	yeah
S0493	right so obviously that be the black one there
S0666	yeah
S0493	it go across like that yeah so we'll need to be get all the blue so in this case it's this yeah
S0666	card
S0493	so you girls sit by there we can we'll put then we'll put the card round face you so it's a bite
S0666	okay you just think this be gonna be funny now don't you
S0493	bring the sofa forward if you want love and then you can both sit on it rather than someone on the floor what's that bottle
S0492	oh right it's alright it's on this do you want one
S0492	it's really annoy this big
S0666	i think it might actually fit on that
S0492	have you change that
S0493	no i'll put the word up first so you can start have a look at them and what have you
S0604	but we both know where the black one be
S0493	no and i'll change the grid as well
S0604	yeah yeah so don't worry about that
S0493	have we do these word
S0604	yeah we have seven like you score
S0493	quite excite so you obviously don't know which ones be gonna be blue and red but you can start like make connections on the off chance
S0492	that oh
S0493	okay okay so that's the bottom line there right
S0666	okay
S0492	okay what colour be we
S0493	we're reds
S0492	reds
S0493	so a bite like a you know everyone's sit there expectantly and you're just
S0604	well yeah
S0493	don't really get how how difficult it be and there's just silence
S0604	but that's why i think it's you know there's quite a lot of downtime that if
S0493	in both of them
S0604	well no in this
S0492	yeah
S0604	in the sort of wait you know and the whole team be wait for
S0493	and also in articulate even though you're it's not your go you're still listen so it's funny and it's just
S0604	yeah i mean yeah you're right it's a really good game and it's really clever
S0493	mm
S0604	but i think it's get
S0493	so each one of these be double side
S0604	yeah yeah
S0493	and there must be two hundred in the box
S0604	i think there should be some how
S0493	well just play it like hanabi where you're try to beat the score
S0604	i think it should be time you know time or
S0493	yeah yeah you go pretty quick though really
S0604	yeah there's just a lot of downtime and silence
S0493	mm so anyone can go first if er if somebody see like a good two or a three they can go first
S0492	see i've just be look at my colour now and i realise i've get to double check that it doesn't match
S0493	yeah
S0492	yeah
S0493	so that's why three's really hard to get really
S0492	mm
S0493	it's only a two you're really gonna get
S0666	i'm ready
S0492	i've get one yeah
S0493	alright who want to go first
S0604	well mum say first
S0492	yeah
S0493	okay so you go out with the blue then mum

S0493	yeah
S0604	not actually that many

S0493	yeah
S0604	things that there's not actually
S0493	well
S0604	there's not many that's a shoot like
S0493	mr mr wu's pig

S0493	well i get
S0604	but can you
S0604	but can you put three on
S0493	yeah i could do but i i i think it's more likely that mum didn't see the false answer rather than it
S0604	mm
S0493	it be a colour so i will guess roulette and circle
S0604	no
S0493	steady progress yeah
S0666	steady progress
S0492	music
S0666	mm mm

S0492	yes
S0604	and it's mint
S0493	but you can't say
S0492	oh i can't
S0493	you can't say that's right because he could just be really lucky and get a right one
S0492	oh okay
S0493	but you yeah
S0666	mm
S0493	alright so mum one two three four one two three four level peg so it's just the first team to get all their card down find all their blue spy
S0604	you know it could be like the first past the first to the post you know who who come up with a clue first get a go and then
S0493	yeah but you're just gonna say ones then so
S0604	like i
S0493	thirty second isn't
S0604	well without ones
S0493	isn't bad cos it just make you say funny ones which will be really wrong
S0666	yeah and that it's i think it's a good idea to have a timer on it cos then i'd have
S0493	yeah
S0666	be quicker i'm gonna say i haven't get one but i'm gonna say prehistoric
S0493	how many
S0666	one
S0493	oh right so i would i'd like to think it be
S0493	mammoth wouldn't you
S0666	mm
S0604	well it's you know there be woolly mammoths in at the same time as cleopatra be around
S0493	no
S0666	no way
S0604	uhu
S0493	really
S0604	yeah we don't think of it do we
S0493	they be mean to bring them back in the nineties and where be they here we be look sixteen years later haven't do anything have they
S0666	i don't want them back
S0493	i think
S0604	what do you mean you don't want them back
S0666	no well if they get extinct
S0604	leave them dead
S0666	leave them there
S0493	leave them be
S0604	losers
S0493	let
S0666	yeah
S0493	relax
S0666	yeah
S0604	dodos
S0604	what about what about dodos they mess around
S0493	can you imagine
S0666	just imagine mess around
S0493	imagine the cape you could wear with mammoth fur
S0492	erm
S0604	imagine the ivory
S0492	close for two
S0493	okay i'll go for dress and cotton
S0604	what's that smile for
S0493	oh
S0604	what be you do
S0492	but i think that but it be right at the end
S0492	that like i be oh
S0493	clothe tie then be it
S0492	tie
S0493	yeah but tie's less than clothe than dress
S0492	i know but i think the fact that you'd make me i it be look like oh this be a bite of a struggle that dress would be too obvious
S0493	no
S0604	you're but we're on the same team
S0492	no i know
S0604	i'm not i'm not second guess you
S0492	so i think you'd be like well she's really like she didn't she's really try to struggle those ones together so dress be a bite too obvious so it must be tie and cotton
S0604	how can a clue
S0604	be too good too obviously
S0604	didn't even enter my head that that would
S0492	no
S0492	didn't even look for tie though you just kind of go straight to those
S0604	dress be right there
S0493	if you'd if you'd see tie you would still have like the dress i'm afraid for clothe
S0492	oh
S0492	i really didn't have anything i be really struggle
S0493	i think sometimes it's a fault of pride as well like you don't wanna be the guy who go one so you'll do it
S0492	yeah
S0493	stretch to a two
S0666	two
S0493	and you'll stretch to a three
S0604	yeah but
S0666	yeah
S0604	she's i mean there's there's a case for you know
S0666	oh
S0604	there's a case
S0666	like the ones i have leave that be march shop dwarf and date how can you make something with those
S0604	well er march and date you know they're both indicators of time
S0493	you could say st st patrick's day or st david's day
S0492	or calendar
S0604	yeah
S0493	or calendar
S0666	mm shop for dwarf clothe
S0666	what do i do with that one then

S0492	what do you do with mole tick and die
S0666	dunno
S0493	if you have if you have say silk silk tie and silk be like a fabric it's like cotton and you could oh no dress be the bad one
S0492	a silk dress
S0493	do you
S0492	yeah
S0493	it's a minefield
S0666	it's a minefield
S0493	two assassinations then
S0492	uhu
S0666	uhu right i will see you in the morning
S0493	good though no
S0492	definitely yeah it be good
S0666	very good
S0493	it's hard isn't it
S0492	yeah
S0493	i think you need to be the person give clue
S0492	must have you play this with people students
S0493	no i could play it i could mm
S0492	these be for good level like it's hard
S0493	it's really difficult yeah
S0492	isn't it
S0493	yeah it be hard you'd only get ones or two
S0492	yeah
S0493	i think you'd just do it for ones or twos
S0492	if you get a two it's get to be something that's really obvious
S0493	well like a
S0492	no
S0493	no but like i have like pig pyramid and aztec so you
S0492	yeah
S0604	yeah but a lot of the connections be i think can be on a colloquial
S0493	yeah no yeah
S0604	or a cultural
S0493	yeah
S0492	yeah
S0604	rather than
S0493	no but i think if you you could make a lesson out of those ones there and like you could get that hour past because you'd just you'd be the one give the clue and you've get
S0492	yeah
S0493	the score chart there and just say
S0492	yeah
S0493	if you get four point then we're do really good if you get five point then
S0492	but it's pretty straightforward i think they'd find it
S0493	also also you can kind of make it where you've get antarctica and cold and like you can design the ones to choose actually you don't have to follow the grid get twenty five card in front of you
S0604	uhu
S0493	and just try and find link so you could just go
S0492	yeah
S0493	snow antarctica
S0604	yeah yeah
S0493	and just go cold and then
S0492	yeah
S0493	you know they'd feel happy they'd feel
S0492	it's quite a good game that you could have a pack of these in your classroom
S0493	yeah
S0492	and when anyone finish you can just say oh go and get them deal them out and just play to yourself like find the
S0493	but yeah the nuance and the intricacies come from be use colloquial language and
S0492	yeah
S0493	clever
S0492	have you get bag to put these in worry about bits and bob get lose
S0492	only little
S0493	but i think as well if you play like you'll appreciate it play it on the other side now like you've give clue i reckon you realise how hard it be and it's like
S0492	well i think i know how hard it be i don't think i
S0604	i think twice i saw the as soon as i say something it's like oh right
S0493	yeah
S0604	er well there's that
S0492	i only realise after about five minutes of find my own clue that i need to look at what 's ones be to double check that they wouldn't it's all well and good look for mine
S0493	uhu mm
S0492	so
S0604	well let me know then if there's anything you want when you know it's irritate

S0492	oh okay so i can't sleep on my back i don't know how people sleep on their back it make me feel a bite dizzy
S0604	do you know how the elizabethans sleep that be sort of upright
S0492	what sleep
S0604	yeah
S0492	like sit up

S0604	because er lie down be the sleep of the dead
S0492	oh jesus
S0493	they think they'd get they think someone would like a spirit would come and take them away if they be if they be lie down
S0492	but you can sleep sit up but it's or for me anyway it's when you're absolutely exhaust like i couldn't just sit and
S0493	train sleep
S0492	yeah
S0493	mm can't couldn't sleep in don't think i've ever sleep in a hammock

S0492	seriously
S0604	oh
S0492	bloody fly they're fuck annoy
S0493	sway like that
S0492	erm i sleep in a hammock not as comfy as you think actually
S0604	really
S0493	no i don't like them
S0492	no
S0493	i don't like the like it's for like bad reggae er it's or or pipe panpipes it's just enforce relaxation
S0492	no no i have no choice there be no other er it be on a beach and that be
S0492	what you sleep on
S0493	i'm just say
S0492	but like
S0493	that's why i don't like about them
S0492	i wouldn't i'd never do it again out of choice cos you're constantly at that or be i gonna fall out which
S0604	be that why you didn't like it
S0492	yeah like which stop you feel relax enough to go to sleep
S0604	mm
S0492	especially it depend how you sleep i think if you sleep on your back it would probably be quite nice but cos i can't sleep i on my side and it's quite hard to get on your side successfully enough
S0493	what's that smell
S0492	dunno just beer
S0492	i don't smell that
S0604	mm just that after read that it's in there
S0492	mm don't like look the flap not they're not interest
S0493	be that a fly
S0492	yeah
S0493	they be on the sweet sauce aren't they
S0492	something's wrong with them
S0493	maybe they've just live the city life as a fly and now they're out to the country to retire
S0493	and they've get the get up and go
S0492	oh maybe they're around a lot because of the sheep don't you get fly round sheep a lot
S0493	hear that before it think
S0492	or around honey
S0493	yeah that's the one
S0492	be that wasps or or be or fly fly around honey
S0493	what's your favourite insect
S0492	i dunno but the other day one of my students little kid suddenly go and say erm grasshoppers to me in spanish and i be like i know exactly what you're talk about thank god for hive
S0493	no
S0492	it's like it mean like jumper
S0493	you mean a mountain jumper
S0492	oh i can't remember
S0492	that's it i be like i know exactly what you're talk about
S0604	you've play hive
S0493	no i be talk about it with
S0492	oh
S0493	yeah it look really yeah
S0492	you'd like it it's very take a little while to crack though i think
S0493	no but you're i think you'd be over
S0492	yeah
S0493	overall good it's really good
S0604	you've get the travel in the pocket sort of
S0493	yeah it's so actually i've never see the erm real one but i saw it in a shop the other day and they be massive
S0492	what do it er
S0493	they're really nice like a bakelite one
S0492	do it come with a like a board
S0493	no
S0492	like a chess board if you buy the normal set
S0493	no off the board
S0492	oh
S0493	off for your weekend
S0492	but do it come with bigger piece
S0493	bigger piece and not the there be two bonus piece in our one the
S0604	yeah
S0493	mosquito and the ladybird
S0492	it would be cool i always think if it obviously the travel one's a bite different if it come with like a grid that be shape with groove the shape so that you be put them into the groove
S0493	you lose you cos sometimes don't know if a a move be legal because like you kind of not put one
S0604	oh okay yeah
S0493	one in exactly right and it kind of that's and whatever
S0492	cos that would look really cool like a big it would like like a hive
S0493	yeah
S0492	no
S0493	travel though isn't it
S0492	mm
S0493	travel light well it's good isn't it
S0492	yeah i like it it take me age to to crack it though i keep forget what they all do
S0493	not fun be it though it's like a thinker
S0492	no it be a thinker
S0493	but
S0604	you still haven't play that that game i
S0604	no no no it's that game i tell you about that and i play in montreal that i really really like but it be like chess but the you it's so exactly the same as chess the board but all the board be a different all the square be different colour
S0493	mm
S0604	and then you have all the piece be rook
S0493	mm
S0604	erm
S0493	that might be
S0604	and i think you have one one row er of you know you have one row to yourself and they have another row just rook and your your colour so if you move you know you move your red forward and it finish on a green square that mean then the other player's turn they have to move the green rook and then they move the green rook
S0493	oh okay yeah yeah
S0604	and and end on
S0493	yeah
S0604	you know purple mean you'd have to move the purple
S0493	right okay
S0604	and the aim
S0493	i haven't play that
S0604	and the aim of the game be to it be you know move you can only move forward couldn't move back and you have to position it so that the other person er couldn't move
S0493	ah okay what so
S0604	and you know and
S0493	when you're play
S0604	er and you could pick a go forward or diagonal
S0493	right okay
S0604	but really so you know you're
S0493	yeah yeah
S0604	really clever but you know really simple but really clever at the same time
S0493	yeah that duke be mean to be great again like chess but a smaller board but load you know say like nine square by nine or whatever erm and you've get piece vaguely similar to chess but not exactly and when er piece er and the piece be on tile so you push the rook one forward three space and when it finish its turn you flip tile over and it'll be a different character with a different move set
S0604	oh okay
S0493	so you know if i put this one in this position when i flip it over at the end of my turn it be gonna go in this one so you're kind of think
S0604	mm
S0493	if you be the head what's his name from it's erm one of his favourite game
S0604	be that the random one er be yeah cos they didn't they talk about a chess that be random you know it turn out it change the
S0493	well the these you you now then you flip it back so it's always gonna be the two things
S0604	okay mm
S0493	but no with that sometimes also with the problem with chess you just know you're kind of lose the other person need to make like a
S0492	an error
S0493	basic catastrophic error
S0492	yeah
S0493	to lose and you're just like slow defeat
S0604	and it's no draw it's as well
S0492	yeah
S0493	no once i think it be just like we're just go back and and it be a stalemate more or less but someone need to make a mistake cos you you start off with what's good about it you you can either move or introduce a new character so you start off with these two character two two what do you call it
S0604	insert
S0493	yeah and then you can either add a new one but you've get to add three each and then you can either move your like make an attack or add a new one in so you can have someone who's attack all the time but only get four insects as oppose to someone who's
S0604	yeah
S0493	kind of on the back foot but they've get six insects now of all the different type and they work well together and stuff i quite fancy a game now grasshoppers
S0492	it's not very like sociable though as a game
S0493	oh no
S0492	be it like it's you're not chat while you're do it cos you're quite concentrate and get like two or three move ahead of yourself aren't you
S0493	i think we do it
S0492	we use it always as a wait for something game
S0493	yeah
S0492	like wait for food cos that take a long time cos they often go to kill the animal
S0493	yeah
S0492	and bring it back on a on a
S0604	i think that's fine
S0493	you can have a serve and you've food right and they go yeah and they go alright and then it would be about honestly about two hours
S0604	oh right
S0493	and you usually we'd sometimes leave it till we be starve so we're run so we'd be on a walk or whatever and they you'd go have you get this and they go yeah and you can see him go off on a motorbike and then come back like
S0493	with the dead chicken
S0492	it's so like
S0493	tell that
S0492	just tell me like i really don't mind if you've only get two dish just tell me the ones you've get and i'll i'll have them
S0493	mm
S0492	it's fine don't tell me you've get it and then go
S0493	he'll just leave you in his restaurant and no one no one er
S0492	apparently one of the nepalese things be they don't like to say no so if you ask them for directions even if they didn't know where it be they would just tell you something
S0604	oh
S0492	cos they felt that be a better
S0604	like most men
S0493	no well like there's there's they it be the worst thing in their custom to do really isn't it so they they'll they'll do whatever it take to not to say no
S0604	as things go
S0493	yeah not a bad not a bad bunch i think
S0492	no they be nice

S0604	a print er yeah i didn't send it to you cos i think i i be gonna tell you when you come down or something but
S0492	oh how nice
S0604	yeah
S0493	so hopefully when they get their degrees
S0604	they should
S0493	er medicine in ten years' time
S0604	you should have you should have hear back by now though
S0493	and you get free treatment
S0492	maybe
S0604	and they come over here take british doctors' doctors' job and give us a free consultation
S0492	well they won't be able to come because unless they're earn a certain amount
S0493	eh
S0604	yeah
S0492	they won't be allow to work here pretty sure it take
S0493	well his english have get to be top notch as well hasn't it if they're from
S0492	i don't think you get the rate that the money that they're say you don't get that for a doctor for a while but then they might all come over cos our doctors'll go apparently a guardian survey have find that half of teachers will say they'll quit in the
S0604	saw that
S0492	in the next five years
S0604	yeah
S0493	they won't though
S0492	i know they won't but i think there'll be a big
S0493	yeah a big
S0492	i think a lot of them be go
S0493	exodus but they won't be half of the people
S0492	there's apparently junior doctor say the same thing didn't they
S0493	no i think you
S0492	i think they're a bite different cos that's seriously that's quite dangerous
S0493	and yeah but also you've train for all this for six years or whatever anyway i think you've get to say that haven't you to a show that to use that as a powerful weapon in negotiations
S0492	but didn't say that something like the day that it get that jeremy hunt's thing get announce that the interest or the registration for like be a teacher in australia go up by like i
S0604	yeah
S0492	two thousand percent
S0604	i mean if you know it's not like fifty years ago when it you can you can look for job really easily abroad
S0492	no
S0604	right you if you've get transferable skills and language
S0493	and it's really only australia and canada and new zealand
S0492	cos of the language thing
S0604	and america
S0492	that's hard
S0493	mm america's really really difficult to get in
S0604	difficult to get the visa
S0492	yeah
S0493	really difficult and australia be get more and more sort of a bite strict about their point and again if it's an you know they're pretty savvy if it's an industry that they need then they'll take you and if they don't they won't
S0604	but still you know that's more options than
S0492	mm
S0604	than britain right
S0493	yeah but erm i think they're pretty with the news events today to take the heat off
S0604	who
S0493	the tories
S0604	well it's well i mean it's er it's it's an absolutely embarrass and public u turn
S0493	yeah but
S0604	and
S0493	it's not gonna make the front page like it would have do
S0604	and it and it's still leave four point four billion you know
S0493	no yeah no it's just
S0604	well
S0493	people have short memories
S0492	what the u turn
S0493	people will priories
S0492	have say that they won't cut the
S0493	yeah
S0492	disability
S0604	it's not look good for the
S0493	it's so bad though
S0604	for the next election though be it i mean if you know a u turn on that you know the the you know junior the doctor strike
S0492	it's just so far away to the next election though isn't it
S0493	yeah
S0492	unless they keep fuck up until then
S0493	i don't see people you know
S0604	and he didn't apologise
S0492	who gordon erm
S0604	george osborne
S0492	george osborne no it's they never apologise they do that thing where they go well i'm sorry that you feel that
S0493	cos he mean to do it
S0604	yeah of course he do
S0493	i'm sorry if any offence be cause like what be your favourite insect then
S0492	mm
S0604	let's talk about the big ones ladybirds
S0492	ladybirds be pretty cool
S0604	obviously be quite nice
S0492	i always sometimes wonder if they're actually really mean and they've get like a really good press department
S0604	yeah yes maybe they're like the pretty girls in american high school
S0493	look the part but actually they're evil bitch underneath
S0492	yeah i'm not a massive insect fan though if i'm or completely honest
S0604	it's caterpillars for me
S0492	yeah do that then stop when they become butterfly
S0604	well that's why they're so great
S0492	yeah somebody ask something or i don't know be it on the radio the other day and it be a really good point and it be say about caterpillars do they know so when they go and spin themselves into their cocoon
S0604	uhu
S0492	be they do it because they're just really tire
S0492	and they're very full cos they've be eat a lot and they're get ready for that be they do it because they think they're gonna do it and then wake up do they know they're gonna become a butterfly and they're
S0604	yeah
S0492	prepare for it and someone's tell them you have to do this or do it kind of happen that like their body just do it for them
S0604	oh well yeah i mean you're ask a deep question about animal consciousness i don't
S0493	do anyone want a drink
S0604	which you can't ever know
S0492	alright for the minute thank
S0604	you know like bear bear don't i know how you you know like know to hibernate right i mean they do in like prepare and that's just what they do
S0492	so they do know to hibernate then
S0604	but er it's the word know like
S0492	right yeah
S0604	you know
S0492	they be aware that they're suppose to do you think be a better word or
S0604	well i don't like suppose i mean
S0492	yeah
S0604	they they they eat when they can right
S0492	yeah
S0604	i i i don't know if they're think oh it's it's august i really need do need to get a few in me by you know
S0492	yeah
S0604	by november or
S0492	or be somebody pass the message along
S0493	who's what
S0492	but like do do bear communicate with each other and tell them like it's come up like do mamma bear tell the baby bear like to pass on the knowledge like in the same way that they teach
S0604	no cos that's now that's
S0492	them to do everything
S0604	yeah but no but time be an abstract and the future be an abstract concept or it's not animals don't really they can communicate but i think
S0493	it's the change in temperature isn't it
S0492	mm
S0493	why they hibernate
S0604	well yeah it's a combination of things but it's
S0493	but if you artificially drop the temperature
S0604	no they still well they still need the food they still need there's scarcity of cos you know there's food the
S0493	no yeah
S0493	you can make an animal hibernate by put it in the fridge for example put a tortoise in the fridge he's gonna hibernate
S0492	where do they go
S0493	tortoises
S0492	no like bear
S0493	little burrow
S0492	do they go underground
S0493	yeah
S0492	they go make themselves a little
S0493	yeah
S0492	by themselves or do they go with
S0604	it's the well it's the mother and the
S0493	all the lads together isn't it
S0604	yeah the mother yeah i i don't think yeah on their own i think
S0492	and they generally just sleep
S0604	yeah
S0493	cos they're cold and it's
S0604	they might take a good book in with them if they can find it
S0493	it's not sleep like it shut down really
S0492	right
S0604	it's like in a coma almost
S0492	but it's weird though cos they be really prepare for that weather if anyone be gonna survive it
S0493	yeah but why why do it if you don't have to there's no food
S0492	yeah
S0493	at all get probably not the temperatures
S0492	do any other animals hibernate
S0493	tortoise turtle
S0492	a bear
S0604	yeah
S0493	yeah i don't know what else er squirrels no i don't think
S0604	no no cos they eat the nut in the winter
S0493	mm
S0492	no they stay they hoard them ready for the winter don't they
S0604	yeah yeah
S0492	collect them all
S0604	yeah so the you know they're active
S0492	yeah
S0604	in winter
S0493	bear be a bite cruel aren't they really different type as well load of different type
S0492	pretty mean though
S0493	mm
S0604	well
S0492	gentle ben they ain't
S0493	no quite cuddly though aren't they
S0493	no they be i mean i mean soft and furry aren't they pandas be pretty soft and furry
S0492	pandas just look like they be get the they be zone out of their mind
S0493	what do er
S0492	all the time
S0493	what do we all think about chris packham's view his illegal view
S0492	why what's that
S0493	he get rid of them
S0492	get rid of pandas
S0493	that's packham say that as well and he love animals
S0492	why do he say that
S0493	cos he think they're an evolutionary dead end his word i quite like
S0604	cos er
S0493	chris packham
S0604	they shouldn't need this much sort of er artificial er support you know to
S0492	no
S0604	survive
S0492	but have they not die about because people have deliberately
S0604	not
S0492	hunt them
S0604	necessarily
S0493	not really no
S0604	they don't have sex a lot and
S0492	oh right okay
S0493	they don't they you know there's plenty of their food it's just they they their diet's like so basic that it doesn't have a lot of energy and whatever and they need a huge amount of it cos they don't want anything else
S0492	right
S0604	even if they you know or whatever they'll have some bamboo
S0493	and they don't have sex
S0604	which be which be nut
S0493	you know they
S0492	but when their baby be bear they be they always always be artificially
S0493	a lot of them be yeah
S0604	well not but artificially in the sense like like they like genuinely show erm pandas porn
S0492	really
S0493	mm
S0604	but they do in they do artificially inseminate them as well now they they just don't they're not very
S0493	panda porn
S0604	panda porn though
S0493	don't have a lot of
S0604	you know
S0493	get up and go do they
S0492	it's quite true though really what he say really
S0604	yeah but then
S0493	well they keep it cos they're a nice looker anyway
S0492	yeah but it it
S0493	but maybe they'll change
S0492	they do cos a lot
S0493	maybe they'll change their ways
S0492	they take a lot of
S0493	to who they don't cost money they they make money
S0492	no but it term of it must be a huge amount of work to keep them and like
S0493	they make make money off them
S0492	if you say that
S0493	zoos make money off them in europe and er the chinese be them for political political gain
S0604	but again i mean
S0492	be we force nature though
S0604	but er yeah i mean that's that's
S0493	well we're force nature in every single thing we do but why
S0604	and that's a bad thing though right they're use as political tokenism and if if they barely survive in
S0493	yeah i'm not say they only keep them cos they keep them in a zoo do everything that man so make to preserve their natural habitats
S0492	how many be there in the wild now
S0604	yeah not many and even even sort of out in the wild they're you know people be you know they dress up in panda costume and you know
S0492	mm i think his point be that other species that er in bigger problems that aren't as aesthetically cute
S0604	no i well yeah yeah
S0493	er er and and
S0604	yeah
S0493	and deserve our money more because at least they're try
S0604	but also you know he's a documentarian and a and a naturist or whatever you don't you know you're you're ethically oblige not to savour a penguin that's be attack by a a seal right
S0492	well
S0604	i mean you just film that's that seal that penguin because that's nature that's you now you have to accept it in in
S0493	mm
S0604	its entirety right not just from a er that poor penguin's point of view
S0493	mm
S0604	and that's not really happen with pandas
S0493	no pretty cute though aren't they
S0492	yeah i saw one go to see it in mexico city zoo
S0493	bet that be shit
S0604	oh god
