S0273	be one of their
S0266	oh yes i've hear of that one
S0273	er what do be erm it it's erm very specific not quite textbooks erm she she produce book which don't look anything really they're a bite bigger than paperback they be hardback and she bring some home look i'm mention in the acknowledgements
S0272	ah how lovely
S0273	erm and these book sell for about eighty pound a shoot cos they're go to university libraries or some specific departments things like islamic family law women's legal position in china it's all very very specific and specialise erm so what she do obviously be sort of it's not to do with the content but it's to do with make sure it's all do properly
S0272	mm
S0273	and properly edit and everybody do their bite at the right time and all so she i think i think eventually she'll have about twenty or thirty book on the go at once but it's take a while to build up to that
S0272	yeah
S0273	so er yeah
S0266	what what degree do she do
S0273	english
S0266	mm
S0273	and then she do an ma in publish

S0273	so erm
S0266	so she's a baby isn't she really

S0266	compare to compare to son
S0273	erm so she get she go straight from her ma in fact she before she finish it she start this job she start it in june last year and she still have a dissertation to do as well but it be it be a maternity leave she be do and erm it's one of those sort of double edge things because it get to the point of april this year when this woman who she be replace would have to decide whether to come back or not and erm the baby be very sick and she decide not to so somebody else's misfortune really that get a permanent job
S0272	yeah i know that's a that's a really difficult one be when you get a job those circumstances
S0273	it be yeah erm so yeah but once she be permanent and full time they could start look for a house and sort themselves out and so i mean she's
S0272	what do do
S0273	something in computers

S0273	seven and a half weeks
S0272	seven and a half weeks
S0273	so mm
S0272	how wonderful i hope to do that one day
S0273	so i've already stipulate to the kid that i want one of them home each weekend to keep the cat company and make sure everything's alright
S0272	yeah
S0273	erm yeah haven't book any accommodation or anything else yet but we've get the flight sort
S0272	so you haven't be it an agent you get an agent to do that or have you do it yourselves
S0273	yeah oh that's really annoy cos my friend i mean she's lovely love her to bits but she irritate me intensely
S0272	oh
S0273	and her daughter's in new in australia so she'd be go pretty well every year she go off to australia and she keep extol the virtues of trailfinders in and how wonderful they be
S0272	yes i've use them they be pretty good they be pretty good but i haven't use them for age
S0273	and i sort of say say mm yeah ah we'll do it ourselves we'll sort ourselves out and we we look and we we do look at erm i mean 's get a star alliance loyalty point card whatever and we look at them and we work out an itinerary which more or less work and do what we want and i say oh just and i as it happen i be go into erm a couple of weeks ago now anyway say oh i'll just go into trailfinders just to shut up and of course they find us a very good itinerary it be pretty well exactly the same for about three thousand pound less in total so she's gloat and gloat and gloat
S0272	well ah that's amaze isn't it
S0273	erm but erm yeah they sort it all out and
S0272	yeah
S0273	take us through everything we want to do and
S0272	it's quite good to do it that way we do a big trip around eastern canada last year
S0273	mm
S0272	and we fly in we want to fly in to halifax in in novo scotia do a trip around novo scotia and then go over to new brunswick and eventually make our way through to quebec and fly home from montreal and erm we go in the end through an er a travel agent and i've never do this before but i come to the conclusion after the last big trip i'd do that where we just land and sort of just decide
S0273	mm
S0272	where we be gonna go each day that actually it become a little bite stressful after a while
S0273	mm
S0272	fine think by about two o'clock in the afternoon you really really have to start concentrate about where you're gonna sleep that night and it end up be a little bite stressful of oh will we get somewhere and then you know you happen to think oh we we'll stay in this place this night and then you start ring round or stop at an internet caf√© and then look and and realise how much time you be waste
S0273	mm
S0272	and then you be make lot of phone call and you'd perhaps there be something go on in that town and you couldn't actually get in and oh god so in the end i say to i don't think i wanna do that again actually so we go and saw somewhere er somebody up in and just spend a saturday morning with this woman
S0273	mm
S0272	who obviously have be in that area and she be able to work out well you know this'd be quite good if and you'd need two days oh sorry you need two days here and you need two days there and and then they so they book the flight the erm car the ferry rid because we have two
S0273	mm
S0272	three hour ferry rid across from st lawrence and across the bay of fundy which be really long ferry rid and the accommodation in the cities that we stay in
S0273	mm
S0272	but then they come up with the accommodation in various other place that we be go to and and say anything that start with quality completely put me off
S0272	so the quality inn in tadoussac be not somewhere we want to stay because we just know how awful it be gonna be so we then decide that we be gonna we book our own b and bs
S0273	mm
S0272	and have some fantastic place
S0273	mm
S0272	so it work really well so yeah hello
S0268	hi
S0273	hi
S0272	how be you oh look at those knees
S0268	be it still go
S0266	yeah it's still record
S0272	still record
S0268	i would kiss you but
S0272	no you've
S0268	not recommend
S0268	okay i'll leave you to it
S0266	how many how many be play
S0268	er we get rope in other people so we have four most of the time
S0266	oh good
S0268	yeah okay so you've get
S0272	yep
S0268	sort of
S0268	right see you later
S0272	see you later
S0272	so erm i i find them really good and i that work really really well so in the big cities i find that they be you weren't gonna get a sort of different accommodation
S0272	but so 'll start look for the
S0273	i have a little bite of a look at erm er hawaii hanoi vietnam and there be amaze hotels that you can get for next to nothing
S0272	yes that's be
S0273	be spoil rotten on the first little bite
S0272	oh i'm investigate cos this year we always we always promise ourselves to have a big holiday every other year while we can and so next year's our big holiday so time to book it now vietnam be on one of the things on my list what make you decide you want to go to vietnam
S0273	well i mean from time to time i've hear people say you know it's one of the new upcoming place lot of people go to and it's very nice and and go there
S0272	oh do she
S0273	from australia
S0272	yeah
S0273	and really like it er but as much as anything when you're look get from here to new zealand well we've be to hong kong we've be to singapore
S0272	mm
S0273	erm we've sort of do the big the main place the most obvious place that you probably would stop at oh let's do and i say what about vietnam or cambodia and we're go to vietnam
S0272	lovely
S0273	and there we go we're in vietnam over tet which be the vietnamese new year
S0272	oh be you
S0273	which be one of those double edge things so it'll be really good to see all the festivals and so on but the transport'll be awful and the service in the hotels'll be awful
S0272	yeah
S0273	so so we shall see we'll survive
S0272	of course you will
S0273	mm
S0266	i've get a good vietnamese phrasebook
S0273	oh could a borrow of that
S0266	i get quite good
S0272	have you have you be there
S0266	no i be teach a whole load of vietnamese in prison men and women over the years so i and they know virtually no english
S0272	mm
S0266	so i resort to not what i usually do but i do in that case
S0272	mm
S0266	it's a very difficult language
S0272	yeah i expect some of them'll speak english there i expect they'll get away with it that's the trouble everywhere you go these days everybody's be
S0266	speak english
S0272	yeah they do yeah so erm
S0266	a cultural sort of er differences of
S0273	mm
S0266	very great make it very difficult
S0272	mm
S0266	but wonderful people
S0272	mm so why the place in the state what why new orleans new orleans and dallas
S0273	er well we've be to again we've be to a lot of place and the place we would have quite like to go perhaps to boston or washington but we'd have go all the way round the southern hemisphere in nice weather and it'll be the end of march
S0272	oh so it'll be cold
S0273	so don't really want to carry winter clothe all the way round the world for the sake of two or three days in boston or washington particularly if they're go to have a winter like they do last year
S0272	mm
S0273	so we think somewhere where it's gonna be warm and we've do san francisco and los angeles and so new orleans be somewhere we have always think we'd like to go
S0272	mm
S0273	and then the plane stop over in dallas whether we like it or not and go to dallas earlier this year she go to texas for a week fortnight er cos one of her very good friends on her ma course be from texas
S0272	oh right
S0273	and she go to visit and she be very take with dallas say it be really nice so we think well if the plane's gonna stop there anyway
S0272	yeah
S0273	so we might as well have a couple of days could be
S0272	yeah good idea
S0273	two nights or something might only be one night actually
S0272	mm
S0273	cos it land early in the morning so we've get all day
S0272	yeah then the follow
S0273	all the next day on a lateish flight see something of
S0272	seven and a half weeks i i've be away for a month twice
S0273	yes a month be the longest i've ever do before
S0272	seven and a half weeks gonna be very
S0273	see if we're still speak
S0272	be gonna say i i would i still speak be speak to him after seven and a half weeks it's quite intense isn't it that sort of travel together for that length of time
S0273	mm
S0272	but that'll be good fantastic
S0273	be interest
S0272	mm would love to do something like that but i have to give up work first
S0266	well you'll have to reach retirement age
S0272	i know
S0266	work a bite harder
S0273	see it's all very well be the youngest
S0272	i know i've still gotta work yeah i realise that
S0266	oh be work
S0272	no
S0266	not at all
S0273	not at all no
S0272	no no he's give up he's sixty and decide well he absolutely hat the last contract that he do he really really really hat that it so he finish that and decide that he he didn't want to go back to lloyds ever again he really didn't wanna do that he i think he'd be happy to do something and use his skills but not do what he be do under the pressure he be under and the politics what he really like do be right he he use to be the way that that the bank work be that you'd be a project manager and you'd be responsible for i don't know ten twelve million pound project but it be a project you sort of have a start begin and end and it and it have a sort of boundary round it and that's what you be deliver and that's where he be really good at that and he'd always deliver really well on that but they've change the whole way it work now so that this project will be involve with this project that's involve in that project so the whole things be run together as one sort of programme and what be happen be that erm he'd spend half the week report on what he's suppose to deliver that week to the to the follow week into this into this group thing and he say you know all i be do be spend all my time report and i couldn't actually get the work do
S0272	and and it be constant politics and somebody you know lord it over each he just he just i can't deal with it now sorry i want to deliver a project and i know i can i'm good at that i can do do that but i can't deal with all this play around bite tell people what i'm gonna deliver but i haven't get time to do it because i'm spend all my time report and what i'm gonna deliver and that sort of you know ridiculous thing so in the end erm so he's give up i think if he'd love to do something else part time but nothing's come along
S0266	so do you get dinner on the table every night and erm all the housework do and
S0272	well sort of in theory
S0266	be he a house husband then
S0272	yeah in theory and we need update the kitchen actually so he's be do a lot of work on that it's quite a difficult transition actually i find it quite difficult with him be at home and me go out to work so there be time where it's quite stressful and other time it make it easier so i wouldn't say it's always plain sail so it vary really you can get quite resentful on occasion and i don't like that side of myself
S0273	yeah i find it quite difficult have home so much more
S0272	yeah mm
S0266	i i have i go to a party on saturday night and meet an old friend and her husband's retire erm from teach a head of department or whatever early retirement and he's at home all the time and she's get a job that's fifteen hours a week
S0266	er which she use to do i think in two days and she's not stretch it to four days so that she can be away because he's always in the house
S0273	i've be say for years i have to get a job when he retire
S0272	i i'll be honest with you that be quite
S0266	and she say it's drive her mad
S0272	it be it be quite difficult and and i think the things that erm because because he do this project work for the last eight years i suppose erm he erm you know he'd often do six months or a year and then have a few months off and but at the moment he have the he go back to work all the responsibilities of the house suddenly get hand to me even though i be work full time i never quite understand how this happen but because he be do a longer journey somehow or another i get it all those responsibilities but i'm sort of adapt but i do find it quite difficult sometimes think actually i open the fridge and think there's nothing in here i wanna eat cos i never get to go to the shop and he have and i don't actually i get feed up with that i wanna go and buy my own stuff but somehow or another it doesn't seem to happen and erm certain things i'd you know he do this he's quite a good cook he do the cook most of the time which be great but actually if i'm retire i don't want him i want to take back some of that i feel as though i've lose my kitchen
S0272	erm so i think there'll be another fight when i'm not work any more so how we work that one i don't know but he just do things in a very different way and i don't always want to do it that way i don't like the way he do it and i just think oh god why can't you do it like this
S0266	and all those years he's put up with you do it your way
S0272	he hasn't know any different have he
S0266	i don't know you might have secretly be wonder why you do it
S0272	mm
S0273	you obviously haven't be train him properly because he should he should be do it your way anyway if it's all be do like that all these years
S0272	i should should i yeah
S0266	and then do you find things store in different place
S0272	erm well that's not so bad no that's alright that's okay
S0273	that should be very interest we're have a new kitchen next month
S0266	mm
S0273	so i should be very interest cos 's still after twenty three years in that house if he empty the dishwasher on the rare occasion that he do there be little pile around the kitchen
S0273	cos i don't know where they go
S0273	so once everything move anyway i dread to think what it'll be like
S0272	oh dear i know yet he do get
S0273	do he do he cook
S0272	yeah mm
S0266	not at all
S0273	absolutely not
S0272	no
S0273	he's not interest in cook at all
S0272	i know that's difficult isn't it no be so that's quite good but erm but there be certain things like you know i i just get sometimes the other day he have a sort of thing about i've get these sort of pile of couple of pile of paper will you please sort them out no i'm not in the mood to sort it i be really tire and i'd have a really long day and i wasn't in the mood and he get in a real strop i say for god's sake it's a pile of paper it really doesn't matter and i do get a bite concern about that fact that his world's smaller so this have become a big thing in his life and it's so immaterial to me because of all the things i'm do so that's the erm only thing that i just sort of those sort of things sometimes
S0266	and what's it like have no children at home
S0272	oh that's fine
S0273	lovely
S0272	yeah i don't have a problem with that at all really consider they've stay around for so long really cos i have back for the summer and but at one point for two months we have both of them there and then move out and then she's move out about a month ago no i'm a great believer in you know they they need to run their own live
S0273	mm yeah
S0272	i actually be not worry about that at all
S0273	well all the way through it's never bother me at all
S0272	no it just it's
S0273	i be the mother dance in the playground while others be cry on the first day of term
S0272	yeah no
S0273	it's just they've get their live to live that's the next stage they go onto it and
S0272	that's right i'm sort of you know no i don't really and the thing be that i have a daughter be quite good cos they keep in contact you wouldn't know this not have a son
S0266	i can see it i observe it
S0272	boys don't hear from them so you can go you know so i i don't get to hear what's go on in his life
S0266	and you work in the same place and he live just down the road
S0272	i know it's funny isn't it
S0273	and even when you hear from them you don't get to know what's go on
S0272	he doesn't work interestingly he suppose to be move to i mean not that it's a thousand people that work there so i mean he's you know i might pass him at lunch on the odd occasion but it won't make any difference i won't see him any more
S0266	what you won't meet him for lunch there or anything
S0272	i can't imagine in a million years he'd want to meet his mother for lunch can you
S0266	why not it'd be nice
S0272	i can't imagine he'd want to do that erm but no i i doubt if that would happen i very much doubt that would happen but yeah he just i i i you know that's the only thing i find if he'd keep in contact a little bite more it'd be quite nice to know what he be do but no doubt i will if there's something go wrong
S0266	mm
S0272	erm but you know that's fine
S0273	people keep tell me that they get better
S0266	mm right
S0273	he must be just about at the point where they get better actually
S0272	yeah he's twenty three so maybe maybe i don't know we'll see
S0273	mm my cousin say that twenty three be about the point when her son grow up
S0272	yeah and he have grow up he have grow up and he's fine but you know it's erm but no i'm actually i'm i find it fine do you find it fine when they leave
S0273	mm well it be do in stag come and go
S0272	yeah yeah so i've have that come and go
S0273	away from university then back after
S0272	yeah yeah i've have the come and go as well
S0273	away
S0272	but i do think
S0273	but i do like them have them around
S0272	yeah no i like have them around but i also be very please that they have build their own live and they
S0272	have they do yeah absolutely erm really please about that
S0273	well and that they're able to cos there be so many kid that be stick at home because they can't afford to
S0273	or they don't have a job or
S0273	whatever
S0272	yeah no i find it okay actually i quite like have the odd occasion where i like be out play cricket last night it be lovely i have about four hours on my own ah bliss
S0273	that's a funny one cos even when they're all home i mean i haven't be work for several years now i've have have the house to myself most of the time but there's still always that if they all go out on a saturday i've get the house to myself i think i've have the house to myself all week but it's not the same somehow as have it when they should be there or would normally be there
S0272	no i think yeah i think that's the only thing that 's around a lot more so but it's just adjust isn't it it's a different stage of your life but you just do it
S0273	it's just have to allow for the fact that there's somebody else there because be away so much
S0272	mm yeah he be wasn't he
S0273	cos it's not as though he be even home every night for his tea so just have he doesn't care what i do but i've you know if i'm go out i've get to say i'm go out to i'm go to tesco or i'm go up to i'm go to see in in because it's common courtesy to say i'm go out i'm do this
S0272	yeah
S0273	but but i feel i use to be able to just go
S0273	i didn't have to tell anybody
S0272	yeah
S0266	mm
S0272	yeah that's it no it's get it's quite interest isn't it the different stag of one's life but you know he he keep say oh i'm gonna find some voluntary work or some other work and it just and a year have go by and he still hasn't so i just wonder but i can't imagine me not want to do anything in term of i want to do some voluntary work and stuff like that
S0273	but equally you probably need some time to to think about what you want to do and
S0272	i think you're er there i would think you're absolutely right
S0273	and get to the point where you be feed up of be at home and the novelty's wear off and you
S0272	cos 's do that hasn't she
S0273	mm
S0272	she's spend six she spend six months now isn't it
S0273	be it that long now
S0272	yeah she give up in the end of march yes
S0273	course it be yes
S0272	so she's have six months now
S0273	yeah
S0272	and erm of you know so i think that's a very wise thing to give up work at the begin
S0273	to take stock and decide
S0272	of the summer and have the summer off which be exceptionally this be a friend of mine live in er erm
S0273	she would have be here tonight if it wasn't her daughters' birthday
S0272	oh it's 's birthday isn't it and erm so it's a useful thing and i think to have some time just to think what what you want in life
S0273	not to rush into class in this and volunteer for that and so
S0272	yeah
S0273	mm
S0272	what be you write on these note then
S0266	just write the topics that we've be talk about
S0272	oh i see
S0266	mm
S0272	so how many minutes have we do we ought to keep go a bite longer
S0266	we've be talk for twenty i haven't get my glass on twenty nine minutes i think
S0272	mm
S0273	well that's never a hardship for us all to talk be it
S0266	so when be you go to retire then what what age ninety five
S0272	i'm not gonna make a decision i'm gonna just make a decision at the time i feel like it
S0266	but i mean you know pension wise and things
S0272	er well my pension kick in when i'm sixty have do we've be go through all sort of different scenarios and this that and the other spreadsheets be everywhere so erm ideally for another couple of years but i i'll see i'm basically gonna go on the basis of i'm fine at the moment when i cease to enjoy the job
S0266	cos how old be you now
S0272	fifty six and a half
S0266	oh god you're a baby you'll be able to work a few more years ten at least i'd have think
S0272	no i don't wanna work ten years it's very difficult to work in an environment when you're work for somebody where you're the oldest in the office and you keep go you see it with other people in the in the business where they're all just sort of oh god i wish they'd bloody retire they're too long in the tooth and i do not want to be in that situation so when i feel that i'm it's all get a bite of a trial and i'm repeat too much of the same thing and i'm find it hard to come up with new ideas and
S0273	yeah but you won't reach that for age yet
S0272	well i that's why i that's why i'm say i'm not make a decision on it i'll see how i feel see what else happen in life
S0266	and then you'll retire and will find some new thing to do
S0272	erm
S0273	well then you can have the house to yourself
S0266	at home
S0272	i think if he doesn't find something in the next year he won't erm but erm
S0266	do he do he ever go off for sort of holiday with other people
S0272	mm go ski on his own
S0266	mm cos that's quite a good thing isn't it
S0272	mm he's always at
S0273	individual
S0272	yeah
S0273	holiday have no friends
S0272	doesn't he
S0273	no
S0272	really
S0273	say dad hasn't get any friends have he all your friends be your friends well he hasn't keep in touch with anybody
S0272	hasn't he
S0273	he's have the you know he's have friends at school he have friends at university and they've all just fizzle out
S0272	and he hasn't felt the need for that then
S0273	no
S0272	isn't that strange now have get a huge amount of friends
S0273	don't you ever i mean you know if there's if if somebody in have a party and he'll happily talk to and
S0272	yeah absolutely mm
S0273	so on but nothing too
S0272	he doesn't search out i mean
S0273	no he's quite self sufficient
S0272	no just i come home tonight and 's down the pub with some friends you know have a drink no you know he's very sociable get involve with lot of
S0273	mm
S0272	have lot of friends and things but he's not bother
S0273	mm mm mm
S0272	he's very different
S0273	partly he say it as you say before he's get to do it all he's get to be so sociable for work
S0272	yeah
S0273	he's have to be sociable and get on with cos he get on with he can get on with anybody
S0272	mm i know
S0273	but he doesn't particularly
S0272	mm
S0273	mm
S0272	i think as you get older and your world get become smaller because of work i think friends actually be really almost more important aren't they
S0273	whereas i'm forever off with the girls and
S0272	mm
S0273	cos there's a bunch of us we're now the diamond
S0266	do do he go to this men's erm first friday of the month
S0272	mm
S0273	he's do one
S0266	the men's
S0273	and he be intend to go again but he didn't really like it
S0266	oh didn't
S0272	oh didn't he
S0266	do go
S0272	mm
S0273	with i don't know who be there when he go i don't think be there
S0272	no cos he just
S0273	cos he say there be nobody really he know
S0272	cos there's
S0273	and he say well they talk about stories from the daily mail and i don't he must
S0272	yeah he doesn't go every time i must admit
S0273	he he say he will give it another go but it just hasn't work out that he's be about to go but erm he wasn't impress that day anyway
S0272	oh dear
S0266	be that recently or some time ago
S0273	oh
S0266	cos
S0273	must must have be three or four months ago
S0272	be go
S0266	he's he's be twice now
S0273	mm
S0272	and how do he like it
S0266	i think i well you'll have to ask him
S0272	yeah mm
S0266	i can't speak for him but i think he enjoy it i mean it's it's funny isn't it because women we automatically go and
S0273	yeah and just
S0266	no no sort of issue or
S0272	no
S0266	anything but you know they it's all sort of funny about who's go and shall i go shan't i go and yeah it's like sort of erm
S0273	i mean there's a whole bunch of people turn up on fridays and
S0266	teenagers
S0273	i don't know they're people
S0272	yeah
S0273	you know there's quite a that that lady we be talk her son have just get marry i'd never meet her before
S0272	her son have get marry erm
S0273	erm he be an actor get marry at the the
S0272	oh erm erm
S0273	right yeah there's there's quite
S0272	she's just recently retire yeah
S0273	cos it's quite lot of people we don't know
S0272	i look down the table and think i'm the only one here work
S0266	the other problem be of course that you i don't know cos i haven't for years i mean i be in the original
S0272	why aren't you gonna come yeah we use to get you use to come didn't you yeah well you say you use to come
S0266	well no one use to well in the old days i do
S0272	yeah
S0266	ever manage it
S0272	i know you use to go
S0266	but i'm usually work and then you go and you sit in one seat
S0272	i know yeah
S0266	and you don't circulate
S0272	yeah
S0266	and i mean it's pot luck who you happen to sit next to
S0273	mm
S0272	mm that be that be the trouble with it
S0266	and you know sometimes you don't wanna give up your work time to go and sit there with someone that you don't wanna talk to for two hours well that's rude isn't it
S0272	well because i because i always don't get there until quarter past one because i don't finish work till one
S0266	ah so that's the trick you come in late and sidle in where you want
S0272	no you have to end up at the end
S0273	it depend where there's space doesn't it
S0272	that's where there's space so you end up at the end so we'll have to organise to come up
S0266	go arrive at quarter past one and then that'll be alright you see
S0272	that's what you
S0273	why don't you ring a bell and you all change seat
S0272	mm i think that would be a really good idea cos i often look down and think oh i'd really like to catch up with you
S0273	yes yes and or there's some conversation to have and it's oh that sound interest
S0266	yeah
S0272	mm mm i don't know
S0266	but it's a great idea that i think
S0273	i think it be because
S0266	to to meet once a month definitely on a set time at a set time but i mean how long have the men be do it now
S0272	mm not very long six months
S0273	yeah
S0272	i reckon 's be to two or three
S0272	but not
S0266	do you think it's work
S0272	mm i think so well the ladies one's be go a lot longer than that
S0266	yeah
S0272	and i think i wonder why you weren't
S0266	the ladies one's be go on and off for about thirty five years
S0272	well i know it have hasn't it i mean i use to go a lot when the kid be younger
S0272	we be always my
S0266	and the friday even one as well when
S0272	yeah no i find it very useful because cos your children be all much older i know it's not particularly much but quite a number of people be kid be much older i use to find it really all the advice use to give me and so forth it be really valuable i remember you give me one very valuable piece of advice
S0266	really
S0272	mm when the kid be younger erm two actually two piece of advice one be childcare don't worry about it only worry a year in advance because in the next the follow year they would have think they would have grow up and need something different cos i use to i must have have a conversation with you where i be plan well once i've do that and then they can go onto this and i remember don't worry about it it'll work out and actually i didn't after i just take one year and so that be a very valuable piece of advice
S0272	and the second piece of advice i take from you be erm you know how girls all fall out
S0272	and erm be it and erm that be always fall out or
S0266	no that's the wrong years it be and
S0272	right erm
S0266	it would have be
S0272	and erm
S0266	and
S0272	and i remember cos i and i remember you say leave it don't ever ring the mother don't ever ever get yourself involve because they would have go into school it would have be the end of the earth cos you remember they'd come home and sob their hearts out so and so's be really horrible to me and you listen to the story think that's absolutely dreadful what this child's do how awful they must have be bring up really bad you know all these stupid things that go through your head and the next day and you just dread them go into school and they're just really in a state and how awful it's gonna be then they skip out of school that even and you've have a dreadful day
S0266	they're fine they're best friends
S0272	and they're best of friends and in the meantime if you're not careful you've ring the mother and have a right go at her and i remember you say don't ever ever do that
S0272	and i never do so there you be see
S0266	oh well that's good well that's yeah that's very erm basic advice isn't it
S0272	i know but when you don't know
S0266	yeah
S0272	and i've give that advice to a few other people as well
S0266	mm it's good
S0272	who've also say thank god i never do
S0272	erm but erm but yeah i always remember
S0266	and then and then the same thing arise when you kid start do erm job you know school job holiday job and they get treat really badly
S0272	mm
S0266	then you think should i jump in shouldn't i should i jump in shouldn't i
S0272	mm
S0273	it's back to they've get to live their own live and sort themselves out haven't they
S0266	but i have on one occasion when one of them be at
S0272	oh right
S0266	waitress and she be be constantly swear at by the chef she be only about fourteen
S0272	oh that mm be that the south african
S0266	i don't know it must have be a long time ago
S0272	i don't know
S0266	and there be someone call who own the whole chain
S0272	oh yes that be that be right at the begin yeah
S0266	the whole chain of restaurants and i just ring him up i'm i'm not take this why should and i have a long you know very interest discussion i say look you've get children would you allow your children to be treat like that he say certainly not my so then why do you allow my children to be treat like that and he say well i'm really really sorry but that's the way cater be i say that's no excuse
S0272	mm
S0266	and he be very decent about it but i shouldn't have interfere probably
S0272	mm well there be some
S0273	cos sometimes you just feel you have to don't you
S0272	mm i know mm mm
S0266	but kid do get exploit sometimes
S0272	mm they do i agree i think if they're with a real exploitation like like i when i several time
S0266	they have be treat really badly
S0272	several time i've you know sit there give them
S0266	swear at the whole time
S0272	a lot of advice and say this and do that and you know i've never have to intervene never be quite that bad but erm but yeah see so those those lunch be very actually have a very useful thing over the years
S0273	of all wisdom and you didn't know it
S0266	well no i'd learn it from somewhere else it be all just pass down the chain it be just really useful
S0272	well yes exactly but it be certain things like that because
S0266	cos her children be much older than mine
S0272	yeah
S0266	i use to learn quite a lot from her cos she's very direct and i learn quite a lot from her
S0272	yeah but i have it you know there be a group of people that i be sort of i don't know six eight ten years younger than that i somehow seem to get involve and like really always enjoy that the friendship i have with all of them you know you and and and and all of that sort of group of people that i find it be really valuable to have your experience erm of of have go through all of the this you know those sort of people
S0266	have to deal with the different teachers at
S0272	yeah absolutely all of those things i find i find
S0266	cos that's quite important isn't it
S0272	really really useful erm over the years
S0266	mm and i find it useful also when they go to secondary school
S0272	mm
S0266	cos i use to worry about things
S0272	mm
S0266	you know what stream they be in or what they be for or whatever
S0272	yeah absolutely all of those sort of stuff yeah
S0266	or how they do sport or whatever
S0272	mm but yeah so
S0266	yeah so i must try to get there more often on a friday first friday of the month
S0272	yeah
S0273	i'll come and winkle you out
S0266	mm like i usually don't come cos genuinely i have something on but i will
S0272	well you need to put it in the diary and then work round it
S0266	it's that much of a i mean it be a priority but it's not that much of a huge priority
S0272	mm
S0266	right shall i press the button
