S0415	maybe his turn
S0417	be you gonna be in the sun over there
S0418	see see see
S0415	otherwise it's him
S0417	yeah but he can
S0418	see see see see
S0415	take him up on what
S0418	see see see see
S0415	see
S0418	what
S0415	see
S0418	see what what
S0416	i'm go to try and play it
S0415	what
S0416	civilization
S0415	i'm not sure maybe your thing
S0416	i'm gonna try it cos me and have a lot of the same taste
S0415	erm
S0416	so i be think
S0417	yeah see if you sit there i think you'd shadow him out
S0415	possibly
S0418	ah
S0417	yeah
S0418	mm
S0416	what's the classic era cos he say he be on the classic era whatever that be
S0418	mm
S0415	the game go in turn from four thousand bc to the modern age they divide it's just get four or five divisions like ancient age classic age industrial age modern it's in the middle it just mean he's
S0416	can you get
S0415	what
S0416	be there something
S0415	mm i i can't remember the exact name of all the i think there's one there's civilization beyond earth which be in space not
S0416	we have it don't we
S0415	no we don't no
S0416	oh
S0415	there's civilization civilization
S0416	mm
S0415	that's the easiest
S0415	i have a i have a version i have a version of civilization that's on the xbox but it's kind of a it's a very tone down casual version of it and er to be honest it's too small it's not as good mm cos you can play multiplayer on it which be probably good
S0416	what do you do in the multiplayer be it like but with another person help you or
S0415	i think you can do you can do either cos there be different ways to win you can win scientifically militarily just culturally all kinds of different ways and you can set different win condition but also so you could decide to cooperate or kill each other or two of you could gang up on someone else mm
S0416	that's so cool so like
S0415	or you could be help each other one minute then one of you could betray the other and then
S0416	could you like could you like so i know in civilization you're you're like into this world and there's like all different countries and stuff and eventually and then you're
S0415	well when you start you've get one
S0418	mm
S0415	one unit
S0418	mm
S0415	in the whole world there's no countries nothing
S0416	oh right okay
S0415	when you start build your first cities that become the start of a country so the world
S0416	what be it online
S0415	well you can play er multiplayer online
S0416	can you play that with your friend and then everyone else be like a computer
S0416	oh that's clever
S0415	but you can have as many players as you want so you can have just the two of you if you want
S0416	could we have like say like let's say at the sleepover at 's house everyone have and they all bring round their laptops and we all play it
S0415	mm
S0416	in the same world
S0415	at the same time but if you haven't play before
S0416	that'd be cool
S0415	you'd just be totally confuse then when you get to the end you get a score that's the higher difficulty level you play the higher score you get famous leaders so it could be like
S0415	you know like napoleon or someone or it could be like someone
S0416	do they have to be famous
S0415	possibly
S0417	something for your hand
S0415	you need to eat some food as well
S0417	put your hand on this you can put your hand on this
S0418	mm
S0417	mm you can wipe your hand
S0415	but then if you think if you're play yourself
S0417	uhu
S0415	you can go completely at your own pace you can be i'm go to build a civilisation that's gonna beat the crap out of everyone else or you can build a civilisation that's go to enlighten everyone else culturally or whatever you want to
S0417	yeah
S0415	and there's religion and science and
S0417	i remember you play it i think how far do you get
S0415	like you only get you only lose the game if you like all your units get kill and you get wipe out by someone else but
S0415	you can't avoid that but it's so the game do have an end
S0418	mm
S0415	so you get to the end of the game but then you know kind of how well you do with it but as well as you're go along er there's all these show compare to the other civilizations like to do with like longevity or education or or lifespan and all this kind of stuff
S0417	mm
S0418	mm mm
S0416	i have a question relate to population in the civilization universe
S0415	mm
S0416	do population matter
S0415	yes
S0416	like if you get like
S0415	yes
S0416	and you make it so far and then you make make it so your material comfort be so good and old age pensioners be so and things like that be so good would you end up like a germany kind of situation
S0415	the simple answer be yes but
S0415	the more people you have the higher your score be but then the more people live in your cities the more things they want and the more crowd it get and
S0417	so be you feel better now
S0416	i felt better after
S0416	not
S0415	and this one this side
