S0603	no
S0493	be permanent
S0603	i don't like that
S0493	also at the end of each game the group will make two game end upgrade to prepare your future game you will put stickers on the board card and your character as you play you'll learn about other ways the game will change also some elements of the of play be hide and seal with off before your very first game as you play you'll find instructions to tell you when to open these package do not open the package in the box until you receive instructions to do so the dossiers which be these red top secret things
S0604	mm

S0603	okay right oh
S0605	can we nail this flap onto the table
S0493	so what stay and what get
S0493	reset write on the board put stickers on the board or on card and possibly tear up or destroy components be permanent change in all other ways the game reset at for the start of each game the piece on the board card in hand outbreaks et cetera all start fresh game months pandemic legacy be break into twelve months start with january if your group succeed in a month you move on to play the next month if you fail you get one more chance to succeed in the current month start a new game with a current set of rule and objectives for the month you just lose if you lose again you must move on to the next month before your new game
S0605	even if you lose
S0493	yeah
S0603	so you get two attempt
S0493	you get two shots at it this be the legacy deck the legacy deck contain card that will describe what happen over the course of the game's twelve months it's arrange in a specific order do not look through or shuffle these card at the start of the game draw the card and read them one at a time until you get to a card that say stop on the back so you start here
S0603	start at the top right that
S0493	that so yeah you start there so it say stop
S0605	no you
S0603	no you start at the er
S0605	start at the other side
S0603	the other side right
S0493	no it say this be the end of the legacy deck
S0604	yeah yeah
S0493	please start from the other side of the deck
S0603	and then it say stop
S0493	stop yeah
S0605	well
S0603	then you turn over and you start on the other side
S0493	don't know it's er this card will tell you when if it's a new draw from the deck which might be mid game at the end of the game or at the start of the next month the legacy deck a one way trip even if you repeat a month do not put the legacy card back the tray be design with two space for use of legacy card one for the use card one for the card that will be use in future game
S0603	okay
S0493	if the legacy's deck become scatter have someone who be not play the game put the card back in their order use their number on the corner blah blah blah blah blah
S0493	so don't touch it basically
S0603	mum
S0493	so that's legacy deck zero one b so into the rise of the first legacy deck card to ensure this do not happen once you've remove it from its package leave the legacy deck in the store store tray
S0604	the
S0493	do that make sense more or less
S0604	yeah
S0603	yeah yeah
S0605	but how do the first card say stop
S0493	well
S0605	though
S0603	that's that's that's just like the dummy card isn't it
S0604	yeah
S0605	ah okay okay
S0604	so you can't look at the first
S0603	yeah
S0605	okay
S0604	and find out what it be
S0493	or draw this card and read the other side just before you set up your first game
S0604	yeah
S0493	so we'll do that probably oh no just before you set it up
S0604	yeah
S0603	be we gonna set it up now
S0604	so
S0493	so we do that now well shall i just read well do you wanna read the dossiers then
S0603	the dossiers er the five dossiers contain the stickers that will go onto the game as you go through the legacy deck you will come across card that have a dossier number or letter on them when you do open up and tear off use the pre cut corner the dossier doors
S0603	match the number or letter on the card one at a time resolve each one before open the next some of these dossier doors will contain one time stickers others will create a card that will be use from time to time in future game okay
S0604	oh
S0603	so you peel them off and you deal with them as as and when
S0493	as and when
S0603	er the package there be eight package in the game as you play through the game yellow box will instruct you to open specific package and then this be important before your very first game place the open package eight sticker next to the door eight of the package
S0493	check
S0603	check
S0604	yeah
S0603	okay
S0493	that's so you open this packet eight if you lose four game in a row
S0603	yeah not gonna happen
S0604	mm gonna happen
S0603	erm objectives at the begin of each game you will have an objective you need to complete in order to win the number of objectives need to win in a month be show on the board for that month so where be the objective card i guess that will be in the er deck
S0493	that might hopefully that'll be

S0603	okay so these be the objectives
S0604	wow january february yeah look oh so
S0603	ah
S0604	and the star may be difficulties like

S0603	the number of objectives maybe
S0493	yeah
S0603	er if an objective be mark as mandatory it must be complete in order to win you do not need to decide which other objectives you be try to accomplish at the begin of any game you may wait to see how the game unfold some objectives will remain in play until the game er until the group complete then others will expire at the end of a particular month as the year unfold new objectives will be introduce so january transform day

S0605	i er and then
S0604	a hammer and nail
S0605	nail it to the to the dinner table
S0603	erm right on one corner of the board be a section where objectives be place january we'll start with one er other objectives will be add
S0604	yeah
S0603	when you move the cub yeah disease track area here
S0493	yeah
S0603	er use these area use this area of the board to apply change to any of the four diseases and a panic level er cities be panic as these disease take hold er when whenever an outbreak occur in the city its panic level will go up by one
S0493	okay
S0603	the first time a city panic place the level one sticker
S0493	yeah
S0603	in the panic level box
S0604	right
S0493	yeah yeah yeah
S0603	near the city
S0604	yeah
S0603	after that place the next number sticker over the previous one
S0493	yeah
S0603	one two three et cetera
S0604	yeah
S0603	the effect of panic level be show below these effect be cumulative so level one state unstable no effect
S0493	yeah
S0603	level two state riot effect players cannot take direct flight or charter flight in or out
S0604	oh
S0493	right
S0603	research station be destroy and
S0604	what
S0603	cannot be rebuild that's well that
S0493	oh that's only for two though
S0603	that's two
S0604	oh my
S0603	that's for serious riot
S0493	yeah
S0603	that's in the full effect
S0493	yeah that's
S0603	oh
S0493	don't you again
S0603	yeah er level four so okay so that's level two and three so you get two level
S0604	yeah
S0603	with of riot so level four be collapse
S0604	so what that say what discard one card the city's colour to drive into it at all
S0603	discard one card
S0493	to move into it
S0603	of of
S0604	yeah
S0603	you need to discard a
S0604	wow
S0603	so you've gotta get rid of a card to get there
S0493	to either drive to to to drive into it to walk into it
S0603	to get there yeah
S0493	okay
S0603	or yeah anything er
S0604	so you probably just go around it or
S0603	that will be it would slow you down yeah
S0493	well you that's er if it's get three because it will have three cos it's an outbreak
S0604	yeah okay
S0493	that's amaze
S0603	so each time a city's a whenever an outbreak occur in a city
S0605	don't worry about it
S0603	its panic level will go up by one so yeah basically as soon as there's an outbreak you go up one
S0493	yeah
S0603	so in one game it's quite it's quite you know
S0493	so you really don't want outbreaks more so than usual
S0603	that like baghdad if you you get two outbreaks in baghdad you
S0493	yeah
S0604	yeah so what we be say dad er the cities have panic level now yeah good idea so these have panic level now that erm if people start riot so if there's an outbreak er more than more than
S0493	three
S0604	once
S0493	more than three cub on a city
S0604	yeah so if there's an outbreak of more than
S0605	and those be the civs that you er
S0604	don't know what
S0604	no don't
S0603	yeah i don't know what the civs do yet but
S0604	so that mean you know once they if there's more than two outbreaks that mean you know there be three cub on there more than er two time you can't get in or out no direct flight and you can't try to charter one in or out and you can't all the research station there be destroy and you can't so if there's
S0605	very realistic actually that's
S0604	yeah it's good
S0605	you know in
S0493	yeah
S0605	a logical
S0603	so that the we denote that sorry denote be that the word
S0604	that's the word yeah
S0603	yeah yeah the number of the sort of level of panic by put the
S0604	the stickers okay
S0603	stickers in the box next to
S0605	oh okay
S0603	the thing
S0605	i bet you the civs be involve in some kind of way
S0603	they're
S0604	yeah
S0493	yeah
S0604	they will do
S0603	er so yeah if it get to level five the state be fall discard an additional card of the city's colour to enter erm for a total of two card if your character be in a city when it fall it be lose
S0604	the character's lose
S0603	see lose character on page five
S0605	oh so they kill them then
S0604	oh
S0605	what forever
S0604	possibly
S0493	yeah
S0603	er each player have a specific character with special abilities to improve er each team's to improve the team's chance each player begin the game by er each player begin the game one by create a character to create a character select a character card and give your character a name rule sticker a will go here oh additional rule
S0604	oh cool
S0603	er these character will carry through the game through from game to game and they may become lose see below you do not have to play the same character in every game
S0604	yeah
S0603	okay
S0604	cool
S0603	scar
S0493	oh
S0604	dad what you do there
S0605	okay go on
S0603	character can be mentally or physically damage over the course of play when this happen choose an available scar and add it to your character's card character be scar when they be in a city that outbreaks and may be scar in other ways that will be note in future roles so if either if you're in a city and it have an outbreak
S0604	and it go
S0603	you you guess
S0493	ps ptsd
S0603	yeah you just go you lose it you go awol lose character er okay erm well go back to scar then whenever you must place
S0493	eight point nine that's not a session be it
S0604	oh no
S0603	wait what be it five nine
S0493	the pale ale
S0603	ipas be normally over five percent anyway but erm good session's what like be about three point six
S0493	yeah double it then
S0493	uhu
S0603	so you must place a scar on a character that have no room for it the character become lose so you can only have erm
S0604	that's who here
S0603	yeah
S0493	right come on now let's
S0603	so yeah you can only take two scar and then you then the character be lose
S0603	i think if you
S0604	take scar when
S0603	when you're in when it's
S0604	yeah
S0603	an outbreak
S0604	yeah
S0603	er so if you have to put
S0493	but i don't think that's gonna happen in now be it
S0603	a scar on on a character and there's no more scar slot or if your character be in a city when it fall your character be lose when you character be lose destroy your character card
S0493	oh that's great that
S0604	cannot
S0493	but oh you've get to set fire to it
S0603	yeah it cannot be play in this or in future game discard all card you have take
S0493	what if you lose this five character if you lose two then you can't play with
S0605	you can't play the game
S0493	four player
S0603	no what happen then be you take a civilian card match your pawn
S0604	ah
S0603	and place your pawn in a city with a research station this may be your current city if there be no research station to play place your pawn in atlanta if your character be lose during your turn continue with your turn keep any remain
S0493	but the be probably gonna have less power
S0604	yeah
S0603	civilians have no special abilities upgrade or relationships
S0493	oh
S0605	okay so the rule be we we have to set fire to it
S0603	eat it or eat the card
S0605	no you have you have to set fire to it and you can't you can't just rip it
S0604	rip it and burn it
S0603	right
S0604	okay
S0493	right then character reference now
S0603	okay i think we know the character but er the dispatcher
S0603	so you can move any pawn if its owner agree to any city contain another pawn or move another player's pawn
S0493	random
S0603	if its owner agree as if it be your own
S0493	at random
S0603	and we can pick we'd pick
S0604	gotta be random
S0493	you've get to be random
S0605	well you can be can i be medic oh i can't do anything else right i
S0493	okay
S0603	can't do anything else
S0493	i can only be the most important vital
S0605	oh no be it
S0604	no no
S0603	no no take the medic
S0605	it's just the only one i know what to do with
S0603	yeah that's fine okay so er
S0493	well do you wanna choose
S0603	er please be the
S0493	no god now you've get attach to it now i bet you're not you'd better not be a sassy black woman
S0603	no i'm not i hate you dispatcher
S0604	okay i'm a
S0603	alright
S0604	scientist i'm
S0603	i'm i'm a researcher
S0493	and i'm
S0493	and i'm
S0604	it's it be random
S0603	tell you what the dispatcher's the most be look it's list first cos it's best
S0493	i don't look at his face oh hello
S0493	alright then
S0603	so
S0493	oh yeah generalist be pretty good right
S0603	well a generalist like have have slot for four different
S0604	you're right
S0603	character upgrade and he get five action per turn everybody else have only get two upgrade
S0493	oh
S0603	the generalist can take five upgrade
S0493	okay so dispatcher then
S0603	four upgrade
S0493	i may as an action either move any oh so move any pawn player's pawn as if it be yours on my turn
S0603	uhu
S0493	as an action move any pawn to a city with another pawn
S0604	yeah
S0493	that's important so that
S0603	that's correct yeah
S0493	if you're in jakarta and 's in chicago for one action i can move from chicago to jakarta
S0604	yeah that card's mad
S0493	yeah
S0603	that's see it's
S0493	okay
S0603	the most powerful player in the game
S0604	yeah
S0493	he's the er he's pull all the string in the background
S0604	mm
S0493	he's phil neville to your gary neville
S0493	get from before move another player's pawn
S0603	he abbreviate permission
S0493	i just do that to
S0603	but but the you do that and not the card
S0493	not the card they're take it seriously
S0603	good so er when the dispatcher move a pawn as if it be his own use the dispatcher's scar and upgrade not those belong to the character he's move
S0493	okay
S0603	card that need to be play or discard come from the dispatcher's hand er a card discard after for a charter flight must match the city the pawn be move from

S0604	okay shall i draw it yeah do you wanna draw it
S0603	wait what wait what's happen
S0604	so this be the legacy deck and i think this this be what change every every round make it distinct and it's the mission brief so when play a month for the first time draw card off the top of the legacy deck until you reach one that say stop
S0493	uhu
S0604	read the mission brief and integrate new card if any into the game
S0493	okay
S0603	right so we that one you turn and and read yeah
S0604	yeah so i turn it over it say
S0603	january
S0493	january
S0493	mission brief oh
S0603	er er we're gonna be the one of these
S0493	you know the drill
S0603	we've get four viruses cause us problems they seem to be mutate faster than usual we have someone look into that
S0605	four
S0493	now
S0605	look i'm sorry i haven't a clue
S0604	keep it under control
S0603	er as one of them
S0605	mm
S0604	mm may grow beyond our capability
S0603	full stop
S0604	okay and it say keep draw so do you wanna read it again so we actually
S0603	you know the drill we've get four viruses cause us problems they seem to be mutate faster than usual we have someone look into that but now keep it under control as one of them may be as one of them may grow beyond our capabilities
S0604	okay
S0493	it say keep draw so i turn it over
S0603	but can we just look at that and then discard
S0493	yeah yeah it go in the erm objective
S0604	discover cure to the four diseases
S0603	so so it's a
S0604	okay regular game of pandemic
S0603	solid
S0493	regular
S0603	solid regular
S0604	so that and then we don't have this
S0603	i think well it's all go so should i
S0604	so yeah but that's gotta be face up yeah
S0603	be we go with five how many do we determine how many card
S0604	so put all structure initially they have research er nearby er erm place a research station in each city with a start research station sticker you begin er only one with in atlanta
S0493	yeah
S0604	in further in future game there might be others
S0493	yeah
S0603	permanent research centre
S0493	yeah
S0603	nice
S0604	place the outbreak alert er for cure marker vial side up erm er blah blah as a group let's decide which fund event card be gonna be in the player deck
S0493	erm
S0603	we get four
S0604	we get two
S0603	be it two
S0604	a four player game yeah
S0603	only two
S0604	yeah that's the
S0603	what okay i so we've get
S0604	so we've get
S0605	so we can choose
S0604	yeah the it's this be the fund compartment of the of the game
S0493	okay
S0603	mm
S0604	so do you wanna say the new ones
S0603	the new ones look like a flexible aid package which you can discard one to three city card from your hand account player take one additional action for every card you discard so if you need to
S0493	doesn't sound that strong i suppose if you cure if you cure a disease so you don't need the blue then you could get rid of them
S0603	you could just get and you get three extra er
S0605	that's not bad
S0603	so you you'd basically get
S0493	yeah
S0603	up to three extra action by discard card
S0605	be that for that round or be that
S0603	er just for that
S0493	one turn
S0603	so you'd play it and then you discard three card or up to three and then you get three action back erm
S0493	that's get two reactions for not discard anything
S0604	uhu
S0493	so i would say there's not in term of
S0604	yeah
S0493	the value in choose that one you can choose that
S0603	uhu er remote remote treatment that's the same so you can remove any two disease cub from the board and airlift you can get you can move
S0605	oh yeah
S0604	yeah
S0603	move anywhere but i think one quiet night be really helpful
S0604	yeah and i so i also think er the research station we haven't get
S0493	cos you haven't get yeah
S0605	what do that do
S0604	put a research
S0605	get an extra one
S0604	that's what you get yesterday to put a research station wherever you want it's not an action
S0603	and that's really handy so you can travel between
S0604	and you can you can strategically
S0603	yeah
S0604	put it in istanbul baghdad or paris or
S0603	i yeah i think
S0604	i would say that
S0603	i'd cos to start off we don't there's only one on the board
S0604	yeah yeah
S0603	so definitely a
S0604	so we could choose two of them yeah
S0603	that would yeah so that one there one quiet night it give you
S0604	that's the hail mary it's
S0603	it it give you a it give you a round free without any erm infections
S0604	but that's
S0493	airlift be pretty
S0604	but it
S0493	i think
S0604	but you've we've get a dispatcher who's get that skill set
S0493	yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0604	i think we er use
S0493	yeah
S0604	use erm the
S0493	yeah
S0604	one quiet night when we get three
S0493	alright
S0604	okay
S0493	so these two
S0603	the only other one
S0493	and they're go in the player
S0603	that you might want to contemplate
S0493	brazilian population
S0604	mm er er
S0603	brazilian population you remove one er any city card from the infection this card pile so it it doesn't ever get infect in that
S0493	yeah
S0604	yeah
S0493	i mean they're all useful forecast be quite useful
S0604	but that's that's pretty good yeah
S0603	i i think one quiet night save you
S0604	okay yeah
S0603	so
S0493	so do these go on the player deck
S0604	yeah they do yeah oh okay but
S0603	oh
S0604	er now divide the erm
S0493	player deck
S0604	player deck into five face down pile
S0603	uhu
S0604	and we're put five epidemic card in there
S0603	so divide

S0603	okay so that'll have a panic level now do we put panic level
S0493	no
S0604	no it's only when it breach
S0603	it's only when it breach yeah i don't wanna be get these things wrong straightaway card in
S0493	oh
S0604	well that's spread out erm

S0493	so yeah hong kong khartoum and
S0603	mumbai
S0493	mumbai
S0493	mumbai
S0603	shall i do you wanna make five pile
S0493	hang on hold your horse
S0604	washington

S0604	milan istanbul you do istanbul
S0603	yeah i do it

S0604	essen karachi
S0603	karachi
S0604	delhi
S0603	delhi okay we've get a we've get a problem
S0493	it's all go on in the middle east
S0603	in the middle east standard
S0493	alright so we need to put this into five really right
S0603	uhu uhu
S0493	more or less equal
S0603	yeah
S0493	one two three four five what do you reckon
S0603	yeah even stevens and i'm just gonna place these in the pile
S0493	and then we and then we shuffle them after that yep
S0603	rule master
S0604	oh so just just a a general er rule once you win a game once you win a month you get a bonus for the next month so that's the sort of incentive why you know you carry on you'll get to february whether you win or lose but you won't get
S0603	get the bonus
S0604	get that bonus
S0603	so there's like a cash bonus so we can
S0604	yeah
S0603	we can
S0604	yeah
S0603	spend on fund and then
S0604	yes
S0603	pharma we can all go on holiday or something yeah
S0604	okay and now i think it's it's it's all the same there now for the moment
S0493	so this deck we prefer like normal then
S0603	yeah
S0604	yeah
S0493	now be we mean to give players the city card before the epidemic card go in in a normal game you be
S0604	yeah yeah
S0603	oh we're suppose to deal card aren't we yeah
S0493	so how many
S0603	er two be it each two card each
S0604	but they need to be shuffle anyway
S0603	okay i do it
S0604	so yeah be it two card each
S0603	that's er
S0604	oh sorry sorry sorry sorry yeah we get two card each but our fund level for the first game be four so we can choose two more
S0603	yeah i think so
S0604	card
S0603	so like
S0493	right shall we just do all that again
S0603	yeah just take these out
S0604	get the epidemic card one
S0603	so we're get panic guy
S0604	two
S0603	we're get panic we've do this thousands of time
S0604	yeah
S0603	so we should go for a forecast and erm either resilient population or erm
S0493	i would say er because we've get the medic though two extra action could really make a big difference now
S0604	how many
S0493	if that's
S0604	forecast do we
S0493	six
S0603	six
S0604	that be good
S0603	so
S0493	i think that's good when you're in more serious dire straits
S0603	forecast then
S0604	well
S0493	i don't think four i i would say
S0603	two so
S0493	i dunno er no the forecast
S0603	yeah you need to
S0604	cos cos don't forget we're get we're gonna get extra
S0493	what i'm say like forecast i would save for later on rather than
S0604	oh yeah it's an end game thing but
S0493	no but for like a month it's mean to be
S0603	well it you can it's not yeah once you've
S0493	yeah yeah yeah i know i'm just say i can see why that would be handy when when your back's against the wall but now i think well hopefully you could do it without
S0603	well we don't know our back
S0493	but that because we've get a medic though
S0603	but our back could be against the wall
S0493	i think with the medic the two extra action mean that it that could be an extra three cub no
S0603	uhu
S0604	yeah okay
S0493	yeah
S0603	extra six cub but yeah
S0493	yeah
S0603	yeah
S0493	yeah no
S0603	uhu oh we should definitely borrow time then and what be the other one
S0604	brazilian population
S0603	which mean you remove the card from the
S0604	like this city be never gonna get infect
S0603	during the rest of that game so we could straightaway we could play take mumbai out
S0605	you could take one out of the er out straightaway yeah
S0603	yeah
S0493	okay what's the what's the option
S0603	er remote treatment which be remove two disease cub from the board resilient population flexible aid package where you discard up to three card and take additional action for every card discard an airlift where you can just move to any city
S0604	no we don't need the
S0605	no
S0603	or the or the forecast where you could rearrange you can view and rearrange the next six infections
S0605	oh that that sound quite good doesn't it
S0604	yeah
S0493	okay
S0603	forecast
S0493	okay
S0604	so
S0493	i it's two card per person now be they
S0603	yeah yeah
S0604	okay
S0493	yeah
S0604	er yeah it's face up or or do them again
S0603	uhu
S0604	apparently
S0603	okay
S0493	alright already get the
S0603	the forecast that's probably too early in the game to get a forecast isn't it
S0493	to get it too early
S0603	you know just gonna be hang onto that
S0493	yes that's but that doesn't count as your
S0604	take a
S0493	card limit
S0603	no er no it be include in your card limit
S0493	oh
S0603	it's yeah you can only hold seven include the
S0493	i do not know that
S0605	oh
S0604	no we weren't play that be we
S0605	we couldn't play that last night
S0604	okay yeah
S0603	yeah
S0604	yeah it do it doesn't
S0603	just gonna shuffle them all
S0493	that's not how you do it
S0603	no
S0493	no you've get to shuffle no
S0603	yeah that's fair
S0493	because then it's stagger throughout the game be that how you're mean to do it though
S0603	yeah but i mean sometimes that's just the way the cookie crumble isn't it
S0604	it doesn't actually say here
S0603	what your card limit
S0604	mm
S0603	it should do which ones have shuffle
S0493	all of them be hello
S0493	that's the house that that make you look more ridiculous
S0604	why didn't you use the other door
S0603	streaker
S0493	i'll mend it for you mum
S0603	with a hammer
S0493	with a chisel
S0493	that's not how you should go about your life
S0603	well just grow your nail really long
S0493	that's mad that's mad
S0603	right so let's
S0493	go on then
S0603	play board game who's get the biggest population i've get lagos which be erm eleven and a half million
S0493	that's ten million too many people
S0605	i've get seventeen million for beijing
S0603	oh well
S0605	can't see
S0604	erm fifteen million moscow
S0603	beijing then
S0493	doesn't make it entirely clear
S0603	yeah er discard card or play event card and so you have seven so cos seven be er
S0604	okay
S0603	the event card be include in the
S0493	okay then dad
S0604	dad if it's on the tripod
S0493	you've just gotta leave it then there dad
S0604	yeah
S0493	leave it up
S0604	there's nothing to do with
S0493	keep tick over you don't have to change the tape
S0605	no
S0493	yeah
S0605	i haven't get enough to film er the entire game
S0493	oh right
S0605	so i'm do it in segment and i'm try to get this start
S0493	okay let's start then be it
S0604	wow that be a long
S0603	that be long
S0493	come on then
S0605	okay which way around the board do we go and er
S0603	er
S0493	well how many more colour be we
S0603	the biggest population go first yeah
S0493	we don't know what colour we be
S0605	yeah no ask me that
S0603	you just change one
S0604	well no i'm
S0603	that's mad
S0604	the scientist with the white coat
S0605	well i'm or erm
S0493	you're brown this pass be pink and medic
S0605	which be brown though
S0493	you're dad you're that one then no
S0604	you're you're blue yeah
S0605	well i i think i be
S0493	orange
S0604	orange yeah there's no orange in this
S0605	that's a blow isn't it
S0604	it be yeah yeah
S0605	so i'm do the
S0604	just roll roll with those punch
S0603	what colour be i the dark one
S0493	you be brown now
S0603	okay yeah
S0493	and i'm pink
S0603	and you're pink that make sense
S0493	yeah
S0604	go on then
S0603	right the first go be to beijing with a population of
S0493	right let's really try and do this well then let's really try and go for this
S0603	i don't know if there's time for that
S0493	no it's
S0493	some serious serious business go on i'm afraid
S0603	well i'm i i wouldn't mind some nut i'm i'm confident
S0605	how do you actually play
S0493	right go on then
S0493	go on then
S0604	so
S0493	you can have a turn
S0603	er your go first then you professor fate you can do what you want you've get four action
S0605	how about if i just get washington out of the way
S0603	that sound good
S0605	alright
S0493	be there no way you can fly to mumbai or hong kong or khartoum
S0603	not yet
S0604	you can go you can
S0605	i could go to beijing
S0604	you can go to miami or go to miami and fly fly out to hong kong
S0603	oh that could be a good idea
S0605	okay how how can i do it
S0603	see because you've get the miami card
S0605	oh sorry yeah
S0603	you can take a direct flight the
S0605	okay
S0603	miami to anywhere
S0605	shall i do that and get in the zone
S0603	i think mumbai
S0493	yeah
S0603	would be more beneficial than hong kong
S0604	oh because you can sort out
S0493	you can go either way
S0604	yeah
S0493	depend on what come out
S0604	but the the er the downside of that be it's not as centrally locate as hong kong so if hong kong tip
S0493	i would say actually mumbai to khartoum anyway be one two three four it look close but it actually isn't so hong kong would probably be i'd say
S0604	but then you know you'd have to come
S0605	come back
S0604	yeah it's it's
S0493	no because but it's less to go from hong kong to mumbai than it be from mumbai to khartoum
S0604	yeah
S0493	plus he's get the beijing card so if he need to fly all over
S0603	so from miami
S0603	from miami to hong kong then and then deal with that
S0493	so count them out
S0605	one
S0603	uhu
S0605	and i can fly to do i have to discard that card
S0603	fly
S0493	you just fly anywhere you want now then
S0605	and so
S0603	and you can completely go against what we recommend
S0605	yeah
S0603	go to riyadh if you want
S0605	straight to hong kong
S0603	yeah
S0493	two
S0605	that's two
S0603	yeah
S0605	and three to clear everything
S0603	no only if it
S0604	no no he's medic
S0493	yeah
S0605	i'm medic yeah
S0603	doesn't it doesn't yeah okay yeah that's brilliant three
S0605	okay and i've get one more turn sort of start go this way
S0493	yeah
S0603	or you could go towards beijing so you can fly out there next time
S0605	oh okay okay that's better okay so one yeah okay
S0493	but if you go towards if you go to calcutta then you're only two away from mumbai where you you know
S0605	oh
S0493	you need to go and you're get further away from mumbai if you're go there
S0605	i know but i like say i've get beijing card
S0493	yeah but you're fly from beijing to mumbai
S0603	thank
S0493	you're lose a card whereas
S0603	thank
S0493	it would only be and one action whereas it would only be two action to go to mumbai on land
S0603	and i guess
S0493	i think you're only save the card's save you're only save one and lose a card
S0605	oh okay
S0603	keep the card
S0605	go on then
S0603	so do you want we'll
S0605	yeah
S0603	push it towards calcutta
S0605	yes
S0603	alright solid so now er you draw two more city card
S0605	milan an epidemic
S0604	oh
S0493	okay epidemic be it
S0605	so increase the infection rate marker draw the bottom card from the infection deck buenos air
S0603	oh that's fine
S0604	yeah
S0493	who win the war anyway
S0605	and er discard that card and intensify shuffle the card on the infection there
S0603	okay so now we're in trouble we could we could be go
S0604	so
S0603	we've get
S0604	hong kong can come out
S0603	well mumbai and khartoum be the issue
S0604	yeah
S0603	or buenos air so
S0604	yeah
S0603	we've get three in
S0604	that's
S0603	how many card have we get twelve out
S0604	yeah
S0605	yeah and this go just back on the this card
S0603	yeah
S0604	yeah so that's a really bad
S0493	well good job that i clear one then anyway
S0604	yeah
S0493	okay so we're gonna see two now ready the first one
S0493	karachi
S0603	that's level up to level two
S0604	no that's good it's en route dad for you
S0605	yeah

S0604	oh it's the
S0605	change that before it set like you can
S0603	can you pass thing i just wanna confirm what panic oh actually you've get it there what
S0604	yeah okay
S0603	so unstable
S0604	so unstable no effect
S0493	next one the if if buenos air go again no direct flight in or out
S0603	that's forever that's
S0603	that's gonna ruin it
S0493	exist research station destroy no new research station
S0604	that's nut that's really tough
S0603	that's nut
S0605	but if the
S0493	yeah
S0605	seriously when we you
S0605	we're five minutes into the game we're on january
S0603	this be the first go
S0605	that's what i that's what i mean
S0603	and we've have an outbreak in the first
S0604	so yeah that's it's
S0493	it's no longer a perfect game it's no longer a perfect board
S0605	once we're once we're in november and we've be play twelve time eleven time there's gonna be load of stickers
S0604	yeah yeah
S0605	and er
S0605	that's er
S0603	yeah it's not easy that
S0604	one two three i can get there and cure take one
S0493	it's not come out it's not come out again be it
S0603	yeah if it's out we just ignore them
S0493	unless you get an epidemic but i don't think you be
S0604	yeah but you know what i mean i've get nothing else go on at the moment erm who's get a yellow i mean
S0493	the other thing you can end up in somehow in chennai and i can give you chennai but i'm not
S0604	yeah and i don't wanna go there
S0603	okay okay just so
S0493	cos you only need four anyway
S0604	yeah
S0493	so you should be the black guy rather than the
S0604	so i'm gonna do that the the
S0603	you can anybody i just need to check anybody can take a card or i can give a card to you
S0605	you can share yeah
S0603	whilst we're in the same city
S0604	can i take mm from
S0493	you've get nothing to take dad should have take one from you dad should have take a blue off you
S0604	yeah
S0605	why tell me why
S0604	yeah
S0603	er a player who share knowledge with you on their turn can take any one of your city card
S0605	okay and
S0604	so
S0605	to share knowledge you can either give the card that match the city you're in to another player or take that card
S0493	yeah
S0603	unless
S0493	but because 's
S0603	unless i'm the
S0493	special skill be
S0605	ah
S0603	we don't need to be in the same city
S0605	oh okay
S0604	so that be a mistake and there's nothing i can get from
S0603	i can no
S0604	or me neither
S0603	i think i think we can share knowledge it need not match your city but where he share knowledge with you
S0604	but yeah but i'm say i've get
S0603	on the
S0604	i've get red and black and you've get blue and yellow
S0493	yeah and i've get a black so
S0604	so i'm just
S0493	we should have give dad a blue then
S0604	yeah
S0493	right yeah
S0604	one two three one
S0603	okay now erm don't draw an epidemic
S0604	okay current player take two extra action on the turn that's good baghdad okay i'll look likely to be
S0603	go to baghdad and build a research centre
S0493	cos cos 's a no cos he's a scientist he only need
S0604	i only need two
S0493	two more black
S0604	yeah
S0605	what be these
S0603	they're the the fund events that we haven't use
S0604	essen
S0603	oh yeah so everything's be reinfected now
S0604	and istanbul
S0603	istanbul
S0604	can you turn the card over as well istanbul's on three
S0493	yeah it's not come whereas mumbai and khartoum be come out so
S0603	mumbai and khartoum will come out next go so
S0493	i can okay so it's my turn
S0604	you might have to burn chennai to get
S0493	to stop mumbai come out
S0604	yeah
S0493	cos that's the thing now you've gotta think about
S0603	you're not gonna be collect black
S0493	no but i'm say if i if i fly to chennai i can take one or two off mumbai or take one off mumbai and move dad erm
S0604	what do we think what do we reckon see we're worry that we know all the card be
S0605	how do you know which be gonna come out
S0603	because they be infect and when you've get the epidemic card they go back to the top of pile so we know which ones
S0604	so know that
S0603	have already come out so
S0605	yeah yeah
S0603	they will be come out again
S0604	you just so yeah
S0605	or get me to do it
S0493	i could move i could move for my extra action
S0604	have you get an extra action
S0493	i could move dad to me yeah
S0605	yeah
S0493	i can move dad to me
S0604	have you get an extra action then
S0603	mm
S0493	no i i mean it take three action to take one off
S0604	yeah
S0493	mumbai er so i've get an extra action so i can either bring dad's mumbai so he take two off or i can move to dad and then can give
S0604	but he'd only take two off eventually you know next go
S0493	no i'm say i can move to dad so can give him a blue maybe
S0603	i think what we need to do be
S0493	so first chennai right
S0603	so get rid of mumbai
S0493	so first tonight right so i'm gonna fly one to chennai
S0603	burn it
S0493	two to move to mumbai three to take off a black i can take another one off i can move dad to me probably not worth it
S0603	action
S0605	why cos i can take two off
S0604	i think if you
S0493	yeah but then okay and then you're one closer to khartoum
S0603	i think i think move the medic to you
S0493	or i can move you to dad's so you can give him the blue probably not worth it
S0603	i think that i think we need to make sure that khartoum well khartoum might go off but
S0605	yeah yeah
S0604	yeah but where's where's dad now
S0493	dad's in
S0605	mm
S0493	be er it's move him slightly closer to khartoum but he's still not gonna get to he's gonna take one off
S0604	if if yeah if be move to there
S0493	no that's me this be dad's
S0604	yeah but you can move him to any yeah
S0493	yeah yeah yeah
S0604	and can end up oh he doesn't have to share or can he treat one there
S0493	who
S0604	see i'm think what be you gonna do on your next go
S0603	erm well i can't really i can't give nobody's with me so i can't give them anything
S0604	well not that can move you to give you
S0603	but i don't think
S0493	but he hasn't get anything for he hasn't get anything to give him
S0603	yeah i don't think my skill be as
S0604	you
S0603	and prominent as important as the medic at the moment
S0604	yeah yeah a bite of a but you're not all er what else be you gonna do here be you go to go to washington treat that and then stay up in europe
S0603	yeah and
S0604	whereas you could give dad the
S0493	but but but like we know know er because if get two blue on his turn
S0604	yeah
S0603	i could build a research centre but i don't
S0493	but anyway er isn't gonna give
S0604	maybe
S0493	that until might give dad a blue and then get get bring out a blue in which case
S0604	yeah yeah
S0493	it's a waste of time
S0603	i think we need to get the medic closer to the problem
S0604	okay
S0493	move dad to me
S0603	yeah and that's it
S0604	okay you think so
S0603	and use your special skills
S0604	do you think so
S0603	mm
S0493	he's closer but he's further way than from istanbul and istanbul's not gonna come out
S0605	no i'm not
S0493	well
S0605	i'm not that far
S0493	khartoum no but one two three four one whereas now you're at one two the same
S0604	okay
S0603	khartoum's

S0603	the problem
S0493	yeah
S0604	okay two pick up
S0493	khartoum
S0603	handy
S0493	algiers alright and infect two mumbai
S0603	no because the medic's there
S0604	no that's the quarantine specialist
S0493	no that's er er jackie brown but anyway it's good
S0603	be you sure
S0493	yeah i'm sure erm
S0603	i think that be only i read something in that
S0604	no
S0603	i'll check erm
S0493	khartoum
S0603	khartoum well it be gonna happen wasn't it
S0493	oh
S0603	the medic
S0604	go on then square
S0603	oh okay of cure diseases yeah if the disease be cure it would
S0493	right khartoum have explode we be in problem as
S0605	so
S0493	one
S0493	two
S0605	tell me what's happen there
S0493	three
S0493	oh so
S0603	we have an outbreak
S0604	in khartoum
S0605	and that's get or everything khartoum's connect
S0603	so everything connect take a hit of the yellow fever
S0493	and khartoum be now unstable
S0604	oh yeah what be the what be we call the diseases so yellow fever
S0493	but don't we decide that when don't you name them officially at certain point i think
S0604	in the game
S0493	i reckon the first time you cure it or whatever you get to name them
S0603	oh nice i think if you cure it
S0604	mm okay
S0603	yeah
S0605	that's a bite racist isn't it yellow fever it's just
S0493	well it would happen in china but
S0603	oh come on don't be turn it that one's upside down
S0604	that's fine
S0603	yeah come up well do right turn
S0493	oh we're do quite badly everybody
S0604	yes that's
S0605	and we
S0493	quite bad isn't it
S0603	this be
S0604	yeah
S0603	two three go two outbreaks
S0603	not a good ratio
S0493	and only one epidemic
S0603	yeah so there's more to come
S0604	okay
S0493	and there's five in there
S0604	yeah
S0603	don't worry we get a second chance in january
S0604	oh
S0493	we don't we don't want that in the first month though right
S0603	i'm gonna i can get to khartoum
S0493	it's not come out again though be it
S0603	no i can get to be johannesburg come out again or be that only infect
S0493	johannesburg have be infect twice by
S0603	by those one's weren't it okay wow this be a shitstorm so should i try and focus on europe erm
S0493	khartoum's not a bad you could fly one two three
S0603	i think that's make more i mean who's get
S0493	we need a research station actually don't we
S0603	yeah
S0493	actually no and i be think along that
S0603	i could build one in london but whether that's whether that's
S0604	probably worth it
S0493	no it's not worth it
S0603	it's not really worth it be it
S0493	and er that's all your action then
S0603	yeah i think maybe go to khartoum then because
S0604	yeah
S0603	because you guy be busy and if er if johannesburg go off
S0493	yeah
S0603	then that
S0493	johannesburg could be the three that come off from an epidemic as well
S0603	yeah i think get to khartoum so i'll fly to lagos
S0603	discard lagos
S0493	one
S0603	two three four try and calm the panic that's that that's go for
S0493	er forever

S0493	but no if if you leave that for dad milan's not come out essen might come out and trigger milan
S0604	yeah
S0493	if you leave that what else be you gonna do
S0604	he can go via dad and pick up a blue
S0605	uhu
S0603	i could pick up a blue one two take a blue
S0605	yeah
S0604	three four
S0603	i can take
S0603	i think erm any one i don't think i i think you can only you i can only take it once i can only take one card
S0604	okay be you sure
S0603	yeah you can give any one
S0493	yeah i think i i think that
S0603	otherwise yeah i think that would be
S0493	no i think i hear that
S0603	too powerful
S0605	how long's the record half an hour
S0604	as long as this
S0603	this it's by well this er
S0604	maximum time as possible
S0603	it's just until we've run out of things to say
S0493	i mean i think we run out of things to say about half an hour ago
S0603	i think that i'm just aghast now at the the state of well the world so yeah these be new aren't they have label on them
S0493	yeah when researcher when do the share knowledge action the researcher may give any city card from a hand to another player in the same city as her without this card have to match the city doesn't say anything about do it once per action only once per turn
S0603	oh it say you may give any one of your city card when you share knowledge so if i share knowledge more than once if i just yeah have four share knowledge action
S0493	i think i think
S0603	it's just an action isn't it
S0493	you can do it
S0603	yeah
S0493	yeah
S0603	yeah okay
S0493	it doesn't say that you can't
S0603	it doesn't say you can only do it once per turn right yeah i think you might be right so if i get
S0604	so four blue 's on the way to cure
S0603	so if i go one two and then i take milan and
S0493	so so but then then if essen come out we we be in trouble
S0605	milan and san francisco
S0603	yeah
S0493	the only thing though we're close to lose the game anyway so we we may as well lose it spectacularly
S0604	and try to save
S0493	but then that's the other thing you lose it spectacular you be be then you're make that board a lot more difficult
S0604	yeah
S0603	i don't think essen's come up
S0493	oh right well that
S0603	isn't
S0493	base on that solid reason then
S0603	okay tell you what we could do be use the forecast card
S0493	i think now be the best time to use it i think
S0605	what tell me the forecast card then
S0493	well i play it at any time
S0603	you look at the top six
S0493	go look at and rearrange the top six of the infection deck put them back on top we could have
S0605	so we could
S0493	do that before
S0605	that's a good card
S0603	well
S0493	be we use it
S0603	yeah
S0604	yeah
S0493	okay so
S0603	so you just turn the top one
S0493	so beijing
S0603	could have could have milk it
S0493	jakarta so jakarta's gonna explode delhi it's gonna go to three istanbul
S0603	that's okay
S0605	oh that's not bad
S0493	karachi we would have be
S0603	tell you that's gonna be come out
S0493	alright
S0603	just the researcher
S0604	no but the jakarta we need to know about jakarta
S0605	yeah because we
S0493	anyway we can rearrange them now
S0604	yeah
S0603	yeah
S0493	and then and then it's dad's turn next so dad's gotta get to jakarta
S0604	well no dad's get to
S0605	well no i've get three of them first
S0604	mm well you well
S0493	doesn't but yeah you should well well
S0605	i mean that be a good thing
S0493	well two 's dad's put jakarta there you've get to clear jakarta can you do that
S0604	where be i and er well i be gonna go to er well i be gonna pick up a black i can't erm
S0493	yeah you're gonna er to algiers with me if you go one two three you could fly to what have you get
S0604	bangkok
S0493	you could fly to sydney
S0604	oh yeah
S0493	you have to do that and abandon the black you might pick up a
S0603	you're not gonna
S0493	you're gonna pick up a
S0603	he'll have too many card anyway now you're on six as it be
S0604	yeah
S0493	yeah so you may as well burn one
S0603	well no cos you can you you you'll pick up
S0493	if you can't
S0603	if you pick up a
S0493	if you can't cure red and black at the same time
S0603	no but if you pick up algiers then cure it and then go for a red
S0493	be
S0604	yeah but i've gotta go
S0493	but er if it if this wasn't legacy we would let jakarta blow up
S0603	wait jakarta would just rearrange so we get
S0493	no
S0603	two go
S0493	that's come two be come on your go two be come on dad's go then two be come after 's go so we need to be the you're not cure it dad's not cure it need to cure it
S0603	karachi i mean jakarta
S0493	yeah so if if doesn't cure it then it will come out
S0603	so okay what if somebody go before
S0493	you can't do it because you be gonna take two from dad dad can't do it because he's gonna cure milan and essen cos he's right next to them and he can take six blue cub off but mad for him to do it and
S0603	if some if i move down and then you like piggyback on me you just and we move we move people down
S0493	by the time by the time it's my turn it jakarta will come out cos it's six card so those be your two those be dad's two then it's 's two
S0603	uhu
S0493	so one of you three need to cure it if you don't want it to explode like it'll be a legitimate tactic to let it explode if it wasn't a legacy game cos you're affect the board and we've have four outbreaks the outbreak there it happen so either dad's be it so it's important that dad do that be it so important you get two blue from dad
S0604	i think so
S0493	you think it's important that he he do
S0603	i think cos blue be
S0604	yeah
S0493	i think you're gonna get a black so you'd go and cure jakarta then
S0604	and forget about you
S0493	yeah fly to sydney
S0603	it's my go still isn't it
S0493	but no but i'm say that when it get to you could fly to sydney go to jakarta take one off
S0604	yeah yeah there's no way i can get to you one two so
S0493	and then you could go if you're forget the red you could go to bangkok and build a research station in bangkok or fly out of bangkok or er
S0604	yeah okay
S0605	yeah
S0493	so how be we how be we arrange these
S0603	well could get to jakarta his next go but he couldn't cure it
S0604	yeah but no he's
S0493	but dad's gonna do the
S0605	i've gotta do a
S0493	it's mad dad er so
S0603	yeah yeah to to run away from that
S0493	so jakarta's the last one cos 's do that so we want to jakarta and what hong kong
S0603	erm
S0493	or do you want karachi's gonna go to three as well
S0604	probably want it to be to be three last then don't we
S0603	so yeah last and then
S0493	karachi and jakarta
S0603	karachi
S0493	no
S0603	yeah
S0493	what about istanbul
S0603	well
S0493	first because
S0603	delhi delhi will be on three as well

S0493	so delhi's so delhi's gonna be on
S0603	those three on three yeah
S0493	okay do you remember once when so we do this me and deliberate for age about what order to do it and then he put it back

S0493	i can bring you to istanbul and give you istanbul
S0604	yeah ah okay red or black
S0493	okay you're fine then

S0493	you could go to bangkok and build a research station or fly to er
S0604	yeah on my next go i'll go to bangkok build a research station
S0493	but then we're lose reds like you're halfway to cure reds now as well that's the other thing
S0604	yeah
S0493	burn them okay
S0604	i'll sort that out okay karachi erm and jakarta
S0604	what about washington we're ignore that
S0493	we

S0493	i can i can go there now
S0604	we'll hang out er
S0493	you don't need me to give you a sample now

S0605	take me to er you
S0493	wherever
S0604	you could move dad
S0493	wherever
S0604	to beijing
S0493	we need more station
S0605	yes we do
S0493	i'm in algiers actually now i'm in algiers so i can go wherever i want i could go to washington we need to station there and and and and these be on three but they're not come out johannesburg be gonna come out at some stage and right i've get quite a lot of options yeah i'm in algiers with algiers which be nothing i'm in i'm near istanbul be in istanbul that's do nothing if we build a station
S0604	it's all
S0493	but that's close to khartoum
S0604	it's too close yeah you can you can fly somewhere
S0493	and bring if i build a if i one and build a station i can bring you there so it's easier for you but that's not
S0604	to cure it yeah
S0603	what do you think
S0493	but no i've get a lot of so i'm in algiers with the algiers card so i can obviously fly to washington washington be come out right isn't it
S0604	yeah so if you do one
S0493	so that's the most important thing
S0604	two and then you could even move yourself back to somebody else's you could go back to say istanbul or or over to jakarta
S0603	how do you get to jakarta
S0493	cos there's two pawn that's in place
S0603	oh who be in jakarta the the
S0493	yeah
S0603	medic down there or
S0604	no go to go to sydney
S0493	no no we do well we say so dad take three off milan three off
S0603	yeah

S0493	and build a station in istanbul i can move dad to istanbul no point move dad to washington could do could move dad to jakarta
S0603	we've get a research centre in khartoum
S0604	we've these be the problems there
S0493	i could move to atlanta and bring to a research station
S0604	but you can also yeah
S0493	or go to well istanbul's a good place for a research station it's just that say that khartoum's a bite close but
S0604	uhu
S0603	i think

S0603	you can move me to a research centre so i can go
S0493	be have a research station where he be if i do that to his in istanbul
S0604	but what's the benefit of that
S0603	i cure without move
S0604	yeah
S0493	one
S0603	and it's it's more travel
S0493	build
S0603	it's more travel link

S0493	and then how be get there

S0603	and any time you walk in enter a city with a cure disease it disappear because you're a medic
S0605	okay
S0603	technically
S0605	so i could
S0493	no cos he's get to enter
S0603	yeah
S0605	could i go to washington then
S0603	you could go to washington via new york
S0605	via new new york
S0493	no but that's one two three and it's that's not a priority cos it's on two well what blue card have you get

S0604	oh hang on sorry dad as a medic can just pass through them
S0493	yeah but there's
S0604	be there any chance to
S0493	no there's about six or six or seven different cities with blue on
S0603	yeah i mean one two three four take off four
S0604	but it's
S0493	i don't think realistically you'll cure it if it's

S0605	okay so
S0603	so wherever
S0605	so

S0604	it's that's
S0493	yeah
S0604	you know that's the game isn't it and it's i'm properly i'm pay i'm properly pay attention
