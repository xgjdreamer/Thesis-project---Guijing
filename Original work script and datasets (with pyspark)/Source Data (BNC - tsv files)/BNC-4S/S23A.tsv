S0032	first time i get these jar i don't really know how they work
S0094	mm
S0032	no tempt to make mead for
S0094	mm
S0032	for christmas
S0032	that be that be nowhere near as successful
S0094	oh
S0032	it be kind of undrinkable for people
S0094	oh
S0095	for people
S0032	it be highly advise not to
S0094	do the dog see it
S0095	the dog say
S0032	it's not ideal
S0021	definitely wouldn't do that
S0032	it's cos i try to rush it i try to do it too quickly and it i think it's gonna need another couple of months so i i try it out and it's just it's just not finish it's pretty horrible really
S0094	oh
S0032	i still i still bottle some up and bring it down anyway but
S0032	with er with the warn do not drink this
S0094	it's like this be my attempt make an effort but it's not really
S0032	mm mm
S0094	oh
S0032	hopefully by the time 's birthday come round
S0094	yeah
S0032	the batch should be okay
S0094	mm mm
S0032	i'm just amaze that you didn't like i she have specific instruction not to go in the larder and go into the larder like repeatedly
S0094	mm
S0021	i be drink when i be drink
S0032	and somehow allegedly didn't see anything i i
S0021	you genuinely saw nothing
S0032	so hard to believe
S0094	however for like months cos say that i'm make a secret thing you know that kind of thing and i like guess almost straight off that he be make like bootleg alcohol for me for christmas
S0032	mm
S0021	erm but then i be so i be also convince that actually he wasn't but i be like it's a reasonable enough theory that i can stick with it and like cos if i know he be do something i didn't know what it be i be gonna keep guess so i be like i'm
S0032	mm
S0021	just gonna pretend that that's the correct answer
S0094	then you
S0021	it be like a double bluff yeah
S0094	yeah
S0032	but you also guess that it be gonna be tasty alcohol
S0021	yeah that's true
S0032	that we'd be able to drink together no
S0032	completely wrong way off the mark
S0021	mm these be organic win
S0094	no it's like from this mm naked win place
S0021	mm well they're quite good for like small
S0094	yeah
S0021	yeah
S0032	have naked wine before we've give them once before
S0021	mm probably probably i don't think i've send you any bottle but i have
S0094	do you get it too
S0021	no i use to when i be in brighton use to drink shit tons of red wine
S0094	oh my god mm
S0095	shit tons
S0094	good point
S0021	the only erm workable volume level of it yeah
S0021	erm
S0095	shit tons
S0032	i think that's the right measurement
S0094	mm
S0032	of red wine for me i think that make sense
S0021	erm but d'you know i've notice recently i don't know if you guy have i have be on the quest for organic wine now in brighton it be quite easy to come by anyway especially in like some of the smaller shop but you use to be able to get it in the supermarkets you also use to like
S0094	all organic things it seem have go like
S0021	not all of them like
S0094	yeah
S0021	although there's definitely be a dip because like in my local asda for example i use to be able to get organic olive oil and organic sunflower oil and now you can only get organic sunflower oil mm
S0095	mm
S0094	mm
S0021	but you use to be able to get quite a few organic things there now you can't really get anything but like in pretty much every supermarket you could get at least one type of organic wine
S0094	mm
S0021	but now not even in co op which be you know one of the most ethical of the lot
S0094	mm see i haven't look for age
S0094	because we've get be get this box stuff
S0021	oh right yeah but i i can't find any anywhere
S0095	oh yeah cos that
S0021	i've be ask as well
S0094	but mm
S0095	it use to be like the mega easy way of choose which wine to get because you wouldn't have to really bother look at the leaflet
S0094	yeah just no
S0021	cos there'd be like one or two
S0021	exactly be like one or two
S0094	mm
S0021	organic ones and you're like oh there we go we'll just go for these like whatever
S0094	that's a point cos they do use to have a really nice one spar oddly enough
S0021	really
S0094	and it be really well price
S0021	mm
S0094	like about six quid or something
S0021	mm
S0094	and it have duck on and it have all the story about how the duck eat the slug and stuff
S0021	mm mm mm
S0094	erm
S0021	mm
S0094	but it be really nice wine too but they don't
S0021	use to get that in one
S0094	they don't sell that here any more but that be age ago they stop that one
S0021	mm
S0094	but i notice they sell at the art centre now in the art centre cafe but it's probably about twelve quid there
S0021	yeah yeah
S0021	but then the co op use to do a nice cos they still do their fairtrade ones but they
S0094	mm
S0021	use to do like an organic argentinian malbec i think
S0094	yeah
S0021	erm
S0094	yeah
S0021	they don't do any more they do fairtrade and no other ones
S0094	mm
S0021	shock
S0094	mm yeah cos i like their they have erm organic fairtrade just normal tea
S0021	mm
S0094	which be really quite nice and
S0021	mm
S0094	quite cheap and good and stuff but they stop stock that now here anyway
S0021	d'you reckon like people think in the recession people aren't gonna want organic stuff so we just won't
S0095	mm
S0021	well that be my theory
S0095	dunno
S0094	well it do seem to have coincide like quite well with that but then they stick all kinds of other completely unnecessary things anyway
S0021	mm mm
S0094	so i dunno
S0021	mm
S0032	what be that wine that we have in you be really excite about it be the organic
S0032	one with like no sulphites or anything in it
S0021	oh my god it be a no sulphite one
S0032	just happen to taste absolutely awful
S0021	it be also organic er
S0094	it be oh right
S0032	it be just the worst thing
S0021	it have like quite a lot of i don't think sediment be the word i think sediment be another thing
S0032	like wine
S0021	it be more like solid float mass in there a bite like
S0095	like a bite of pond scum in the wine
S0021	yeah pond pond scum wine that be a great description
S0021	mm
S0021	that's what they should've call it miraculously
S0095	be interest to see how that would sell
S0095	pond scum wine get a wine that brand itself as like have a taste of burn toast and things like that
S0032	yeah
S0094	think that's true mm mm
S0021	it might work quite well like when you're kind of force to go round someone's house for dinner and you don't really want to
S0094	yeah
S0021	we could
S0094	i bring you some wine
S0032	yeah
S0032	think we drink it all though didn't we
S0094	mm
S0032	think we
S0094	anyway
S0032	we make our way through
S0094	i think that be part of the problem the other day when you come home and say we be all giggle and everything we'd be drink that wine and stuff the first bottle of wine we have be like hardy's or something and it wasn't very good so i just think ah let's just get this over with so we can get on to the next one
S0032	yeah
S0021	mm mm
S0094	mm have you try the chutney i think it's nice try that
S0032	i'm not entirely sure how it go with this but
S0094	i be quite enjoy it but
S0032	i just
S0032	i just quite like sweet things so
S0032	well sweet appley things
S0095	see i'm normally quite an anti sweet kind of
S0032	i'm not into like chocolate or like
S0095	taste person
S0032	i dunno sweet chocolatey type things but apple pies and things
S0094	mm mm mm mm
S0032	i get behind those definitely
S0095	mm yeah
S0021	didn't you use to have a big thing for ketchup though
S0095	not really
S0021	not
S0094	he'll eat it whereas i won't touch it
S0021	oh
S0021	oh yeah
S0094	that's the only thing
S0021	mm
S0094	doesn't go wild over it we don't have any all at all
S0095	yeah i don't mind like i'd i normally prefer like tomato purée in place of ketchup
S0021	mm mm mm
S0032	no it's not have salt and sugar in it
S0021	i have like mm
S0021	i have like tomato ketchup emergencies if i run out of tomato ketchup like if i make a fish finger sandwich for example and then you've get no ketchup
S0032	that's not as bad as the barbecue that we have though
S0021	mm
S0032	we have a barbecue and there be no ketchup
S0021	no ketchup
S0032	like the condiments be all just miss
S0094	oh
S0032	and it be er i think our friend who have be stay around like she just like she just drink ketchup
S0094	that be like the thing about condiments
S0032	and we we have have like this enormous thing and it be just
S0094	yeah
S0032	go and none of us have notice
S0094	oh no
S0032	oh well we've get all these burgers no ketchup what
S0095	shock that be a little bite of a disaster
S0094	mm mm
S0032	it be kind of a disaster yeah it it didn't quite ruin the barbecue but people be definitely judge it harshly
S0032	all of this food and alcohol but they don't have tomato ketchup what be wrong with them
S0032	god
S0094	you
S0032	thing be
S0094	can get away without ketchup if you've get like plenty of other stuff instead though
S0032	there be there be not a lot of other
S0094	mm that be the thing
S0032	well it be an impromptu one it be a very impromptu barbecue
S0094	oh
S0032	it be one of the ones that sort of come together about like quarter to ten at a pub in summer and you go oh shall we have a barbecue now
S0032	oh yes 's house

S0095	er dunno really
S0021	i'm sure i be on the phone to you and
S0095	i've sort of forget
S0021	at one point and you be like we're just lay down the marble

S0094	oh yep ha
S0021	where do you get them
S0021	ebay

S0095	i find them they be kinda like second that have little chip in the corner and stuff like that
S0094	mm
S0021	oh nice
S0094	it end up be the cheapest floor option out of all the things we be consider that be possible really as well
S0032	get marble
S0094	yeah
S0032	there's
S0095	they're really thick slabs as well
S0032	well we wouldn't put cheap stuff
S0094	yeah
S0095	thick slabs
S0094	yeah they're so heavy like there's a tiny bite leave in the kitchen for put pan on stuff just feel that like it's pretty bloody heavy
S0021	really heavy
S0094	yeah
S0021	oh well your house ain't gonna go down
S0094	i could barely lift one like a full size one mm
S0021	this be weird you're still eat
S0032	mm i be
S0094	so be you
S0032	so be you
S0021	i know but
S0021	's normally significantly further ahead than this
S0094	oh
S0032	i'm only a little bite
S0094	but you have a tiny portion
S0021	mm
S0032	ah that's what it be
S0095	i'm a little bite slower
S0021	mm
S0094	yeah
S0095	i think i be a bite of guzzler this time
S0032	the wine as well
S0094	mm
S0021	mm
S0032	that's what it be
S0032	i take regular break for red wine
S0021	mm
S0021	i'm like a little orange tang on the edge
S0094	mm mm orange taste like orange
S0032	i'm the lack of bacon
S0094	don't worry there won't be any bacon
S0094	at all
S0032	it have be a very rich sort of weekend
S0094	mm
S0021	it have there have be a lot of
S0032	no it be christmas so you're mean to have rich food at christmas but
S0094	yeah
S0021	meaty meaty time
S0032	only for
S0094	i have make some really rich truffles
S0032	nice that be nice wine as well thank you very much it's quite nice isn't it
S0021	chile chile
S0095	so what be the conclusion with the wine thing should you pour it be it
S0095	better cos don't know whether you and do like double blind trials or something
S0021	mm
S0094	about area and do all this crap
S0021	mm
S0095	like where you whether you pour it between things or not
S0021	mm yeah
S0095	so what be the conclusion
S0021	i mean it do alter the taste
S0094	what's your honest conclusion now he's not here
S0021	erm
S0095	i'll
S0021	i mean it do alter the taste a little bite
S0094	mm
S0021	but it's not always like it depend on how you like your wine basically
S0095	so it just change it but not always for the better
S0021	it it change it mm i mean like a professional winer person or whatever they're call would like professional winer probably not the same er
S0021	erm they like
S0021	they would they would have it they would have it air because the true flavour of the wine will be more air than what you get when you first open that bottle
S0095	right so like what the manufacturers want you to taste be open air
S0021	well you can't think if you're have nice wine come off small estates you're not think any more about what a like if you're have jacob creek or bullshit
S0095	yeah
S0021	like you don't worry about whether you're air it or not
S0094	mm
S0021	cos what they want you to have be just drunkenness
S0095	yeah
S0021	and then more jacob's creek wine i presume
S0095	yeah
S0021	but like when you're buy it off like a small estate like a small batch then yeah they would they would like you to take your time over your wine i'm sure and like air it a bite
S0094	mm mm
S0021	and they can't do that for you like the wine be you know for whatever reason it necessitate be in this particular bottle shape or whatever
S0095	yeah
S0032	so what so if that's the case why why be the bottle like that
S0032	why d'you not have like a big like screw top of it yeah so it can like
S0094	it should have with a big neck yeah
S0021	mm mm mm
S0032	since then have to decant it into a thing
S0094	though maybe the metal would be oh cos but screw top
S0032	or just giant cork
S0021	mm mm
S0032	just really big cork
S0094	giant bung things
S0095	the the cork's like the vulnerable thing isn't it that's like the thing
S0021	mm
S0032	i suppose that's the bite yeah that
S0095	so the smaller that be the better in a way
S0021	mm
S0094	mm mm
S0095	but then there's the whole thing about select the cork for certain permeability and all that and like get all that sort of finely hone so that it
S0094	yeah be that a real one this time yay
S0021	mm i'll have to show you upstairs cos you've gotta see their bath
S0094	the bath itself be not very excite old scummy you know
S0021	there's in the bathroom
S0032	oh right i'm quite jealous of anyone with a bath we don't have one in our house
S0094	bathroom be no
S0032	just have a shower
S0094	we never use it
S0032	yeah when be the last time
S0094	you could have a bath though if you want to
S0094	at more than two years ago
S0032	yeah we didn't have one in two years
S0095	just feel weird have bath in other peoples' bath though
S0094	maybe three years ago
S0021	mm
S0094	maybe four it's true
S0095	it's not be it not it just be it be a bite weird
S0094	that be yeah well cos we're look after well we're not look after but we're go round to check our friends' erm house while they're over here
S0095	just just be weird in general
S0094	they they're worry about their boiler not work so and they say oh yeah you can have a bath if you want because they've get this like epic bathtub that's in the middle of this big bathroom kind of thing
S0021	mm
S0032	oh yeah one of those
S0094	they've just get into this new house and stuff but it's just like it's not that appeal especially as their house be really cold at the moment cos they're not there
S0032	no
S0021	mm
S0094	but in any case it's just a bite sort of weird
S0032	have a shower seem fine like it's like yeah
S0094	yeah
S0032	i can have a shower it's just fine but a bath's just
S0094	it's a bite more of a project as well isn't it and it use lot of water and you probably wanna
S0032	yeah
S0094	once you've get it like you've gotta be stay in there for a while and that's a bite weird round someone's house isn't it
S0032	it be yeah
S0021	mm
S0095	yeah
S0094	though if they're not there it's not so weird
S0021	but also
S0094	but then that's also a bite weird too
S0021	like when you're round somebody's house
S0032	yeah it's weird though you're think it's not weird because it be weird but since they're not there it
S0094	it
S0032	yeah
S0094	it's yeah
S0032	definitely
S0021	also like just be around somebody else's house even though you've be ask to look after like i would always be suspicious that other neighbour would be think there's a burglar in
S0032	there's a burglar in take a really long bath
S0095	er
S0021	well
S0021	i don't think he be take a bath especially if it's in the middle of the room
S0094	yeah but i mean if they're that observant neighbour
S0094	they would recognise our van or they would recognise us because
S0021	mm
S0094	we're round there quite a bite
S0021	mm mm mm
S0095	either way it'd be pretty hilarious if the police arrive and you be just lie in the bath
S0094	yeah just like
S0032	yeah you
S0095	hello
S0021	yes officer be you here for a dip
S0021	the water's just fine mm
S0095	well like for my birthday the other day
S0094	oh yeah
S0095	and the sort of like promise of have a go in their outdoor bath it's like
S0021	oh yeah
S0095	it's just kind of like get a fire underneath it
S0094	they've get their fire underneath it
S0021	mm
S0094	and they're out in the stick and you can see the star and stuff really well from there
S0095	that be quite cool actually
S0094	but it's still a bite like well we'll have to like go from the house and
S0094	go out and have a bath and come back and
S0021	you see that's but that's
S0095	that's more of a like
S0094	no that's okay but
S0095	no like a look like it's not like you're go to get clean it's just like
S0094	no
S0021	mm
S0095	go for this experience so it's a bite better really
S0021	mm
S0094	mm yeah
S0021	but also that's very much like i could get down with that because i like that's very similar to like what you do in an onsen in japan and you'd you'd actually like clean yourself in an indoor shower whatever and then you'd go out there
S0094	mm
S0021	so you would go out there butt naked but that be perfectly socially acceptable
S0094	yeah
S0021	and the way to do it culturally in japan
S0094	yeah
S0095	and like hot tubs be just bath with bubble aren't they
S0021	mm
S0094	mm
S0095	be more than happy to go in those i think though like if you're ever in a hot tub with other people if you just turn off the bubble then it's just a bath with your friends and
S0021	yeah but that's normally their swim costume and stuff though isn't it yeah
S0095	get weird really quickly i would imagine
S0095	and the sort of tepid water outdoors it
S0021	they're normally like you'd be in a erm like a swimsuit for that wouldn't you
S0095	usually yeah
S0021	yeah whereas like an outdoor bath thing i would go in naked
S0021	well no but in japan you do
S0095	depend
S0094	i wouldn't mind if i would
S0094	but like they wouldn't be watch us anyway would they
S0094	that would be quite weird if they be
S0021	i hope not
S0095	they'd be stand at the side with a towel
S0095	wait
S0094	but i dunno
S0094	like neither of us really like get pruny and that seem to happen like within two minutes of be in a bath so it's like well we've go to all this effort build a fire like make it all like this and like
S0021	maybe you need to build yourselves up
S0021	maybe you need to start some train in your bath
S0094	train
S0095	before we go
S0094	i'd much prefer sit in a sauna nice and dry and hot
S0095	two bath a day
S0094	mm
S0021	i prefer a steam room to a sauna
S0094	jump in cold
S0094	oh no
S0021	i do
S0094	the air's all like muggy and dirty and weird and like you feel clog up and like can't sweat properly
S0021	see in a sauna i find it a bite too dry
S0094	no it's good and you can chuck water on if it's that dry
S0032	i don't really like either
S0021	no
S0032	i think i've be put off both of them just by my gym and just go in and it's just full of big hairy sweaty dudes and
S0094	then it just yeah that's not nice yeah
S0032	that's just not how i like spend my
S0094	no
S0032	whatever time it be so
S0094	that's a bite weird i've never be into one like at a gym or something that'd be weird
S0032	no that's the only one only time i have like access to them
S0094	yeah
S0021	you should see some of those spas
S0094	no there's a great one at dance camp like
S0021	mm
S0094	just like mainly nice and then you just run out into the cold shower run back in cold shower mm ah
S0032	i do quite like that actually jump in between the pool and it
S0021	it be
S0094	mm
S0021	like i've be to some like there be a festival i go to the festival and they'd make like an old horsebox into a sauna
S0094	mm
S0021	that be quite cool but erm mm see i find like like i think go in water or somewhere steamy naked be be like a bite better than be like butt naked in a sauna
S0094	no
S0021	yeah
S0095	why cos it's
S0094	why
S0095	limit visibility
S0021	yeah
S0095	yeah i can see that
S0021	it's very much just like
S0094	but it's dark in there
S0032	i can see how that would be a bonus
S0094	but it's dark in saunas
S0095	limit visibility be possible
S0094	it's not like it's not like really light in a sauna it's quite dark
S0094	yeah
S0021	it's not like close
S0095	glare
S0021	it's as least as light as this in most saunas
S0094	no
S0021	yeah
S0094	no not in the one that i like go in
S0021	oh well
S0094	but in any case even if it be light like i mean it doesn't matter
S0095	no it just depend who you're share the sauna with
S0094	yeah
S0021	yeah
S0094	i mean if it be weird gym guy
S0095	it's just weird
S0094	very weird
S0094	obviously but you wouldn't go in there
S0021	no also it's not it's not just yourself it's more like the people who be like in there as well who be like look at you
S0095	it's just a weird dynamic in general
S0094	no that's what i mean weird gym guy weird obviously
S0032	especially the old ones stand around naked change most of the time
S0094	but like in in a kind of like environment where most people sort of recognise each other and like it's all fine it be yeah
S0021	depend
S0032	yeah depend
S0095	i think one of the best hot tubs i ever go in be the muddiest as well
S0094	but you can also cooch up and stuff so they can barely see you if you're worry about your bits
S0032	cooch up
S0094	you can
S0094	cooch up cooch up
S0095	cooch up
S0094	cooch up cooch up like
S0094	you know you can sit like this can't you like with your
S0021	yeah that's really natural and enjoyable
S0032	you look look really like relax there
S0095	make you feel a lot more comfortable
S0021	just sit cross like this
S0094	well i suppose if you've get a problem you just don't go in there do you
S0021	yeah i suppose not really
S0094	so and then
S0021	mm
S0032	i could be so mean in that situation so i could you could be sit there
S0032	and just chuckle every now
S0021	make them really paranoid
S0094	yeah
S0032	at one of the obstacle race that we do they have this like giant communal hot tub thing
S0032	and like there must've be about fifty odd people in there
S0094	must've really dirty and stuff
S0032	and it be just like it be so well you finish and you're just cover from head to toe in like just mud and just horrible horrible stuff
S0032	and it be just one of the greatest ones ever cos everyone be just so relieve to be out of the cold and out of the mud into this they didn't care about the big lump of poo and stuff
S0032	sort of float around there obviously a bite of horse poo come along there
S0094	cool
S0095	so it be warm as well
S0032	yeah yeah it be warm hot
S0094	fester poo
S0032	they they be like they be blow like some bubble in it
S0021	smell
S0032	but they be it wasn't really worth look it be like
S0094	your grubbiness be probably kill the bubble wasn't it
S0032	yeah it didn't have the strength to get through the water
S0021	i think you be gonna say they be power by fart rather than like
S0032	there would've be an element of that
S0021	flatulence
S0032	a lot of people eat a lot of protein and carbohydrates to get through the race
S0032	suddenly relax
S0032	er
S0095	nice
S0021	er
S0094	er
S0094	oh er
S0032	it be good though
S0094	mm
S0032	it be very relax
S0094	well
S0032	horse poo
S0094	it's
S0032	would be the best of poos
S0094	yeah at least it doesn't smell too bad
S0021	to be in a bath with yeah
S0032	yeah
S0021	i'd wanna be in with them
S0094	yeah
S0095	if you have to choose any poo to be in like
S0021	i think of all poos
S0021	yeah definitely like yeah a horse poo
S0094	sheep wouldn't be too bad i think
S0021	oh no no no no no no no no
S0095	depend
S0094	i mean
S0095	how solid it be i think
S0094	well same with the horse
S0095	yeah well horse poo
S0021	no i think
S0032	think that's always gonna be a isn't it
S0095	yeah
S0094	mm
S0032	the solidity of it i didn't think rabbit poo would be too bad but
S0095	rabbit poo
S0021	no
S0032	i mean
S0095	yeah
S0032	but you'd have the problem if you go for a dunk they're quite small so
S0095	mm
S0032	you could get one in your nose or something
S0094	they could get catch in your hair
S0032	yeah
S0094	in your hair like i would anyway
S0021	oh oh god
S0095	they'd probably dissolve quicker as well be little pellets
S0094	everything get in my hair
S0032	yeah
S0095	more surface area
S0094	poo solution
S0021	wow anyone gonna go for a little more rice on this note

S0094	mm mm mm mm mm
S0095	you get a powerpoint prepare for that
S0094	no prezzie
S0095	er
S0094	mm
S0021	well that happen to a lot of people i didn't use to like sprout until suddenly we need to cook sprout
S0095	i think
S0032	well like the when you sauté them you chop
S0021	yeah
S0032	them up and sauté them with like garlic and or an onion
S0094	how be the sprout
S0021	huh
S0094	how be the sprout be they acceptable
S0021	oh i'm love them
S0032	i i don't sprout i really don't like sprout
S0021	but today
S0032	but these really be er the christmas ones be sort of alright ish i guess i try them but these be quite nice
S0094	pretty good
S0032	they
S0094	we be just say like
S0032	kinda taste like which be good
S0094	yeah we be just say mm the sprout be okay because you didn't have to avoid them on the
S0032	yeah
S0021	mm
S0094	so it be quite good
S0095	as soon as they're like even just a smidgen overdo
S0094	yeah
S0095	they become
S0094	mm
S0095	fairly disgust
S0032	well that's what be say i just didn't
S0094	we overdo them at christmas day like really i think we do
S0095	well
S0094	do we overdo them maybe
S0095	they be edible but
S0094	mm
S0095	but they weren't
S0094	but only like a gravy and hide yeah
S0095	yeah you need lot of gravy
S0094	but i didn't at least i didn't do load of them so that we didn't have to have load of yucky sprout leftovers
S0095	yeah
S0032	the only time i cook them myself be if you sort of chop them up really finely and sauté them with like onion and garlic
S0094	yeah
S0032	and then they're really nice
S0095	yeah
S0094	sprout curry be okay mm
S0032	no
S0095	mm again i think like that would just overdo her a bite cos curry need cook a long time
S0021	mm
S0095	i think they're okay in curry if you put them in towards the end and you chop them up quite finely
S0094	mm mm mm
S0095	and they're just kind of hide and you think it's like hide healthiness
S0032	i like hide healthiness hide healthiness work
S0094	yeah yeah mm
S0032	like kale i really do not like kale but it's really good for you so if you just put it in a smoothie with like other stuff like avocado and banana you don't even taste it
S0094	yeah
S0032	but you get the healthiness anyway
S0094	new smoothie recipe
S0021	mm
S0032	mm
S0094	very nice
S0021	mm
S0094	kiwi cucumber kale
S0021	mm mm
S0094	and orange or apple juice amaze
S0032	oh yeah really
S0021	mm
S0094	and it yeah and you can't you obviously can't take much cucumber you can't taste the kale and it's just kind of tangy from the kiwi
S0032	nice
S0021	mm
S0094	very healthy
S0032	i love smoothies yeah i just find like it's just the easiest way to get lot of green really easily and tastily
S0095	i'm pretty suspicious of smoothies
S0032	if you're in a rush
S0095	i have to say
S0021	suspicious of smoothies
S0095	yeah
S0094	too sweet too sweet
S0095	i just like chew things if it
S0021	mm
S0095	doesn't like i dunno it always seem like food i dunno get teeth for chew and
S0032	i like smoothies for like the opposite reason cos you don't have to chew them
S0095	smoothies just like weird somehow
S0032	so i will have all of my vegetables for today in these next three gulp
S0095	it freak me out drink food
S0094	mm
S0095	it's like odd
S0094	it be a bite weird it's a bite like baby food but i just quite like i just see it as like ah it's a healthy drink
S0021	mm
S0095	yeah
S0021	there be something weird about like you know
S0094	as long as i have water afterwards cos it burn my teeth
S0021	cos really digest a smoothie because if you don't make the chew with your mouth like do your body know that you need to react differently to that smoothie than just like oh that's water
S0094	well i
S0032	yeah
S0094	i see it as like you know you've do the chew in the blender
S0032	mm
S0094	there's a bite of saliva miss
S0021	mm
S0094	but it's okay for me to eat
S0021	no i know but don't
S0094	but not too
S0021	isn't there like a reaction in your body where like when you chew like which be why you you're suppose to chew a certain amount
S0021	but like if you don't chew like the mechanical action of chew set off enzymes and stuff in your stomach and that doesn't it
S0094	er well i like only a bite
S0032	to an extent but i think just get food in your belly just do the same thing anyway
S0094	like yeah
S0095	yeah i don't think it do i it do something the saliva i mean that's the whole process
S0094	well maybe it's best to have a smoothie when you're also eat food
S0021	mm
S0094	and therefore it shouldn't be view as like replacement food it's just a drink
S0021	mm
S0095	a slightly lumpy smoothie that you have to chew
S0094	but i often make those cos i get bore of blend and it's so loud that you have to chew my smoothies anyway like
S0032	yeah yeah you're right
S0095	well the last one i have be
S0032	if you have freeze stuff in it as well that doesn't quite
S0094	yeah
S0032	go through
S0094	yeah
S0032	my friend's be on erm this thing call soylent i don't know if you've hear about it it
S0095	it's very
S0094	soylent
S0032	name after soylent green yeah
S0095	it's not that you poo the bed every night
S0032	erm no
S0021	mm
S0032	yeah he's be pooping a lot erm no it's just like a food replacement thing sort of like er sort of like a weight watchers type shake except
S0094	oh right like smoothies all this shit
S0032	but it's like fully nutritionally balance
S0094	right
S0032	so you could live just off this thing instead
S0094	just on that ah how soulless
S0032	erm there've be people do i know but like for a lot of people people don't like cook and they don't like the effort
S0094	yeah
S0032	or they just don't do it so they just end up have
S0094	crap
S0032	yeah so he eat like a couple of meals a week
S0094	like yeah
S0032	and all of the rest of his meals be milkshakes and he's be on that for about three months and apparently the first couple of weeks be a little bite weird and his body be adjust to
S0094	mm
S0032	like like go from eat actual food to just have liquid all the time
S0095	ah go on
S0032	and now he just feel like better than ever like he's just
S0094	mm
S0032	energise he do load of exercise and
S0094	mm
S0032	apparently there's a lot of people say this as well and i don't
S0094	mm
S0032	think it would be for me but i think
S0094	yeah i can see the attraction for people like
S0032	but it's probably quite good if you're in a bite of a rush like just to get in a healthy meal
S0094	yeah
S0094	i can see how
S0032	healthy
S0094	some if people be like that and they don't like cook and they don't particularly like eat like mother
S0021	mm
S0094	like if mother be on her own
S0021	mm
S0094	she would totally need that otherwise she just would like not eat anything at all
S0021	mm yeah yeah
S0094	erm but i would just be like ah the things that i look forward to would just be this crappy milkshake
S0032	mm
S0094	like
S0032	apparently it's not the tastiest thing
S0094	er
S0094	oh no that's even worse though if they can't even make
S0032	it's a bite sort of chalky and
S0094	er
S0021	er
S0094	er
S0021	no that's gonna taste like some sort of indigestion medicine or something
S0094	no no no no nope yeah
S0021	no
S0094	i just know that's not for me but
S0032	but it's save him money it's save him time and he's get more vitamins and nutrients than he would do like otherwise
S0094	i'd like to think healthy yeah mm mm
S0021	yeah
S0032	mm like it make lot of
S0094	yeah fair enough for that kind of person
S0032	try and attempt to try it
S0095	bite suspicious of like someone come up with like the ultimate nutrition thing in general really
S0094	yeah
S0095	or or like sort of be able to pre empt everyone's kind of need in a way dietary need
S0094	yeah because you can have a complete like range of all the nutrients and stuff but that might you might be a bite different
S0032	well people be different but there's different sort of things for different people in different lifestyles but
S0094	mm
S0032	i'm not that suspicious it it's
S0021	but like on a day to day basis you do change like what you need like and like other days you just you know
S0032	yeah true but a lot of people just eat the same thing every day anyway or just eat mcdonald's or just eat whatever so i mean
S0021	that's true
S0094	mm
S0021	yeah
S0094	yeah yeah
S0032	if you're if you're have not much anyway
S0095	yeah
S0094	yeah if you're like have rubbish anyway
S0032	i find it hard to believe if you're have like a proper healthy diet then it would be better than that or as good as that
S0094	no
S0032	i can't believe that but
S0094	yeah i mean chew be kinda cool
S0094	i'm with you with the chew
S0095	in
S0032	yeah
S0095	in general
S0094	yeah
S0095	just like quite nice
S0094	yeah
S0032	yeah yeah i like it and i like
S0094	i'm not
S0032	cook as well and like
S0094	yeah
S0032	create something tasty
S0094	yeah
S0032	that's good
S0021	yeah i go to see it's a nice sociable thing as well
S0032	instead of just like a grey liquid
S0021	like that what we've just do i mean you like how much fun would this be if we all have just a glass of like chalky liquid in front of us
S0094	mm
S0032	well instead you might be like play board game or you might be
S0021	well we can have that anyway i would imagine
S0032	er perhaps socialise or you might be but yeah you could get like an extra hour of it or something
S0094	yeah
S0095	it's true
S0032	which be which be his argument
S0094	yeah
S0032	which i don't agree with
S0021	yeah
S0032	but sort of instinct
S0094	mm mm
S0021	well
S0032	but he be also so i mean
S0021	oh god
S0032	yeah right so yeah
S0021	oh god oh he's be talk about that to me for age like
S0032	yeah he's finally some of it
S0021	last christmas i believe he be go on and on
S0032	yeah
S0021	where be he at christmas by the way
S0032	er he didn't come probably be
S0094	drink milkshakes
S0032	yeah

S0094	not very high and and yeah they're good quality and nice and they're perfect for work i would think
S0021	yeah
S0094	but i don't wear them cos they're too
S0021	why why d'you not be it cos of the square toe
S0094	erm no well i like the square toe that's why i buy them but

S0021	yeah
S0094	if you if you don't think you'll wear them then i'll try and like sell them on ebay or something i think

S0094	erm doesn't well you you can grow it in this country
S0021	tea tree

S0095	durable
S0094	mm it's be able to be a part of the thing

S0094	mm mm
S0021	holly

S0094	well sort of but it's a different type isn't it
S0032	oh come on
S0021	oh come on
S0032	that be hard
S0095	well just think about
S0032	white oak dark oak
S0021	dark oak brilliant
S0094	this be other oak
S0021	other oak
S0094	it's where this be yeah upcycled so it's
S0032	be that six type of tree
S0021	it's lovely
S0094	and and the and these bits these bits be bicycle spokes
S0095	tree
S0021	oh nice
S0032	tree bonus
S0021	nice
S0032	er what
S0021	bicycle spokes
S0032	oh cool
S0021	awesome that be amaze thank you very much that be awesome
S0094	so you have to decide whether you like it as it be or whether you want it oil
S0021	oh yeah if i want it oil so what will oil do to it
S0094	well it'll change its appearance
S0021	brilliant
S0095	it'll go
S0094	it
S0095	slightly darker and
S0094	yeah
S0095	more vivid if you imagine
S0094	yeah
S0095	spill water on that
S0094	yeah
S0095	that's what it'll kind of look like but it's on permanently
S0021	oh yeah
S0094	and but i mean if then you spill anything on it it'll be protect whereas
S0021	i'm totally gonna oil it yeah
S0095	why don't why don't you show show the one that you've have for years
S0094	oh yeah
S0095	that's not be oil
S0094	that isn't oil
S0021	oh okay yeah
S0094	and
S0032	so many things
S0094	oh er
S0095	and you can kinda compare it to the door down the stairs which have be oil
S0021	okay
S0095	cos that's oak so you'll get a rough idea
S0021	er okay
S0094	i mean different woods be involve although that's teak
S0021	ah very nice yeah
S0094	and that's a eucalyptus as well
S0021	mm mm mm mm
S0094	so it's actually you know it's fine
S0021	mm
S0094	but like we think these bits would come up quite nice as contrast y
S0021	mm
S0094	when it oil
S0021	yeah
S0094	but then this be really nice not oil i mean you could just oil bits of it this'll come up nice
S0021	well it's yeah i kind of think i'm think maybe oil i i like some some of the bits have get a beautiful
S0094	mm
S0095	cos it it'll probably bring out the grain a bite more as well just like a thin coat of
S0021	yeah
S0095	the oil stuff that we've get
S0021	i think oil
S0094	get one really warm foot now and one not very warm foot why
S0021	oh the thing it be seventy five percent virgin wool warmness right
S0094	do that mean normal wool or
S0095	virgin what do virgin mean
S0032	kind of just nod and smile it's like er
S0094	what do normal wool get up to
S0021	all kind of thing
S0032	virgin wool
S0021	erm i'm imagine that virgin wool must be either from a young sheep erm slash lamb or if it's like the first
S0094	maybe like a
S0032	oh the first time they're shear
S0021	time that the sheep have a shear
S0094	oh right maybe

S0032	graphic adventure rpg puzzle or mmo
S0094	rpg
S0095	graphic adventure
S0094	oh
S0032	whilst it be a graphic adventure i think this be a mislead question it be a puzzle
S0095	what
S0094	mm
S0032	it's a puzzle game but it's also
S0095	suppose it be puzzle
S0032	an adventure with graphics
S0095	well yeah seem like the first kind of like really good
S0094	that would cover most things wouldn't it
S0021	yeah graphic adventure like
S0032	yeah i think
S0021	everything apart from pac man surely
S0094	mm
S0032	oh tetris have sell more than seventy million copy worldwide
S0032	make it one of the most popular video game ever in the original version of the game what be the maximum number of line that can be eliminate at one time
S0095	five
S0021	no no no no no no no tetris now tetris so it would be erm
S0032	you can work this one out
S0021	erm wait wait six
S0032	you've get this one
S0095	oh yeah six
S0021	or wait wait or on top of each other so
S0032	maximum number of line
S0021	erm like it would be about
S0094	ten
S0021	three six nine
S0094	i don't even know what it bloody look like
S0021	erm
S0021	three six nine twelve
S0095	tetris
S0094	be that's the block thing
S0032	what's your logic behind this
S0021	so i'm use a like the tetris thing that we use to have as kid
S0094	we didn't
S0021	be i have i get the wrong game
S0095	tetris be like the block and they come down
S0032	it's the one where the block come down
S0021	yeah yeah no no no no no no
S0032	you can use
S0021	yeah
S0032	logic for this one
S0021	how
S0032	use just hard logic
S0021	how
S0032	the shape of the shape like once once you
S0021	oh ten it's ten it's ten cos the longest shape be a five
S0032	no but but what do you have to do to eliminate them
S0095	create a row
S0094	you have to get to mix so they can't all mix at once
S0032	you have to create a row
S0021	oh yeah i'm think of the fruit one
S0032	so destroy
S0021	four
S0032	to destroy yes
S0021	no oh
S0032	it's four it's four because the the long one be only four block long
S0095	ah it's four right
S0032	so that's the maximum that you can fit down to get
S0021	oh
S0095	yeah
S0021	okay
S0095	i think it be five for some reason bellend
S0021	yeah i feel like the longest one's five that like just the straight one
S0094	no no no it's definitely four
S0021	okay i be think of d'you remember that one we have that be like tetris but you could change the symbols
S0094	that be tetris wasn't it
