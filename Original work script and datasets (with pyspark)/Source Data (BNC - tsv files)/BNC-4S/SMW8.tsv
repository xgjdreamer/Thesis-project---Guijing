S0255	i've get them i can show you
S0316	they be really good
S0255	it be it be a thing with erm sorry it's chaos here at the minute it be a thing with work that erm it they'd get like you know like a mission statement they get the value and the what they want you to do be actually draw things that depict each value and so the value be erm
S0316	we care
S0255	we we care we love our stuff er
S0316	don't pass the buck
S0255	yeah that's right stuff like that
S0316	mm
S0255	so we the you could do it in team and say that there be me
S0316	yeah
S0255	and so we sit and just get ideas and she be say that her first idea she have the idea that we care with the world and we be just that's brilliant that's amaze so then we be try to think of things use hand in all of them but then we just you you just couldn't so then everyone be chuck ideas in and say i'll go away and jot some rough stuff and then come back and then we have another meet it be yeah that's great not sure oh but what about and then she go off and do it and and put it in
S0316	i didn't realise that she be so talented before
S0255	yeah oh i know and it's it's definitely a a hide talent
S0316	i don't know why she doesn't
S0255	yeah
S0316	it always interest me to know what people think your talents be because you go around and you talk to people at work all the time but you don't really ever they're so
S0255	yeah people who be musicians or all sort aren't there there's erm
S0316	we use to er we sometimes talk about who we think's get all the interest stories and who be the who be the hide gems
S0255	mm
S0316	everyone's get a little something though haven't they
S0255	yeah well i i be just go today to my real dad and his wife over in boston go over there and have a meal erm and learn the no the violin so i be like oh give yeah give us a concert give us a concert so
S0255	she get it out and she's only say only learn it erm but so she start do it and be do this and do that and i say oh i say i start learn to play the violin when i be about nine i say i only play it for a few weeks cos they keep want so you have to have short nail and even at that age my nail be long
S0255	and i didn't wanna cut my nail down and i keep try to do it without and i be think well i can do it pretty much but this teacher be no no no no so yeah and i say well i won't play it then you know go onto brass instrument when i get to secondary school but so i say oh let me have a go let me have a go so we get this thing here and i be sorta like oh yeah and and after about a minute of the i say look go back to the begin of the book and i be play twinkle twinkle little star and
S0316	ah cool
S0255	row row row your boat go like this and and they be say couldn't believe how after all that time i be just actually er where be it oh yeah like that so yes
S0316	if i think if you're musical you're musical and i think
S0255	yeah
S0316	some people can learn it i'm not say that it's kind of a
S0255	no no
S0316	it's not definitely a a dead thing if you're not musical but some people be naturally talented i think at
S0255	yeah
S0316	at music and it's a lot it it's a bite like language as well i think you anyone
S0255	yeah
S0316	could learn a language but
S0255	yes
S0316	some people be naturally that's their their thing
S0255	yeah
S0255	yeah i totally agree
S0316	because i can hardly remember any of the language that i learn when i be at school now
S0255	mm
S0316	and i think some of it might come back when i be cos i go to paris a few weeks ago and i think some of it would come back
S0255	yes i be gonna ask you about that
S0316	erm
S0255	yeah
S0316	but it really didn't not beyond the basics
S0255	yeah
S0316	although i bump into somebody when we be back in kings cross and i be like like
S0316	cos and afterwards i think we're probably both english cos erm
S0316	and they say back so
S0316	you you get into the habit don't you of
S0255	yeah
S0316	do the little pleasantries cos
S0255	yeah you do you do
S0316	i'm really a firm believer that if you smile and erm
S0255	mm
S0316	kind of say hello please and thank you you can't be
S0255	no that's it i always think if you're go anywhere you should try and do at least hello please and thank you and goodbye in their language
S0316	people then can't be mean to you can they
S0255	the only time i struggle with that be when i go to russia because i be try to learn it before i go and just couldn't the pronunciation the word be so hard and so foreign it's their way of think
S0316	yeah
S0255	so when i get there i say i'd like to be able to say this so how do you say that and they keep tell me and tell me and all the way through the weekend i be go how do you say thank you again and i
S0255	it be just
S0316	just not stick
S0255	no no whereas i think european languages they're quite similar aren't they a lot of them so it just
S0316	mm
S0255	and the sound and the the way your mouth work when you make the sound it's the same so
S0256	i like to try and learn one to ten as a challenge
S0255	one to ten
S0256	yeah
S0316	that's good
S0255	mm
S0256	i know it in english sort of french french german and
S0316	that's good it's a good start
S0255	yeah

S0255	yeah
S0316	skewer stick

S0255	and they'd break in half cocktail stick so they actually cos i have one and i be like
S0316	yeah
S0255	oh what the hell's that and spat it out

S0256	mm
S0316	conceal
S0255	yeah oh yeah
S0316	stick
S0255	they be so it seem if to me like they've get like a er erm a a like a gamble thing go how many people can we try and kill with skewer
S0316	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0316	also have just she's get a knack of get herself into issue cos she erm they go punt in cambridge
S0316	this be the same person
S0255	yeah
S0316	and she fell in
S0255	yes
S0256	the punt
S0255	yes
S0256	i wouldn't wanna do punt i'd be scar of fall in
S0316	i think generally it's pretty stable
S0255	oh yeah
S0316	like i don't think it's easy to fall in
S0255	well people tend to try and jump from one to the other don't they occasionally and then they fall in but yeah she just fell in didn't she
S0316	cos they're quite wide
S0316	she's a little bite clumsy she's a little bite
S0255	well she's constantly lose
S0316	precarious
S0255	like break her phone isn't she or she drop it down the toilet or she drop you know break it and
S0316	she fall over she
S0255	yeah
S0316	drop stuff she break things she's a bite chaotic
S0256	i'm clumsy but relatively lucky if that make sense so like i trip all the time and i stumble and i drop stuff but it never seem touch wood to to do any damage or break anything like i i nearly drop my phone down about three flight of stairs at work my old job the stairs go round like in a spiral and there's rail all the way down i take it out my pocket and just go like that and just launch it and it fell and the the barrier like the bar be there and it land against the bar and i go
S0316	oh
S0256	well that be lucky carry on
S0255	mm
S0256	i drop it under my car the other day like in the middle of the car and i'm like how be i gonna get that it's like right underneath the car again didn't go down the drain didn't go in any puddle bear in mind it be like pour with rain no didn't go in a puddle and i'm like i'm really lucky it didn't
S0256	but erm pretty much every morning when i walk to work i trip over my the pave slabs like i get i always seem to be okay or trip upstairs or downstairs but
S0316	cos you do break your ankle once though didn't you that's
S0256	yeah that be skate that be do a jump and do it wrong i hurt myself skate quite a lot but again not normally apart from that it's not too bad
S0316	mm
S0256	so like i've actually get a massive bruise on my leg at the minute from where i wasn't even on the ice i be just stand by it and i i lose my balance and fell against the plastic seat and the it jab into my leg and i've now get a bruise
S0316	well one of my friends i take her ice skate and she fell off the ice
S0256	mm
S0316	so she be one foot on the ice
S0256	yeah
S0316	one foot off on the rubber
S0256	yeah
S0316	and she somebody come and take her the the ice the foot on the ice
S0256	yeah
S0316	someone come and just knock that from underneath her
S0255	oh wow
S0256	yeah
S0316	she fell off the ice onto her wrist
S0255	yeah
S0316	and erm she break her wrist really badly so she go
S0255	mm
S0316	ice skate but didn't fall over on the ice
S0316	fell off the ice and
S0316	er
S0256	yeah lot of people i i'm i've well i nearly do something like that i be gonna go off and i be sort of gradually slow down in a snow plough stop and think i'm not slow quick enough i'll do a hockey stop do the hockey stop but obviously just too much and my legs go from under me and i land square on my wrist again didn't break it be about that far from hit my head on the door apparently and i be like well that be that be good
S0316	mm
S0256	get up quite embarrass very painful cos i like jar all my rib hurt my hip hurt my wrist just jar pull everything cos it be quite a heavy bang but yeah i be like i say again lucky i didn't actually break anything
S0255	thing be sometimes you have come home and tell me you've do an almighty crash bang wallop
S0316	mm
S0255	and it's just like not a bruise not anything
S0316	no
S0255	and other time you do the slightest thing
S0256	well like this i i didn't do anything i literally pretty much lean against it and i get a whack great bruise
S0256	but i i i fall and
S0255	doesn't like as much
S0256	take a
S0256	fly superman fly
S0256	and the bruise i get be
S0256	like the faintest littlest bruise and i'm like that really hurt
S0256	and i've get a bruise here and i don't even know how i've do it it look like someone have basically punch me on the leg
S0256	i've just get three finger fingermarks on my leg and i'm like have i do that maybe i've fall maybe i've hit myself
S0316	fall on your hand
S0256	but i don't even remember like
S0316	ah it's very strange
S0256	yeah i'd like bruise for the momentous fall rather than the silly things really
S0316	i once be do i can't remember what it's call now erm the erm i can't remember what any of this stuff's call erm spiral
S0255	oh yeah spiral
S0316	where i'd grab it over my head
S0316	and i just pull it too far
S0255	yeah
S0316	like i be i've trap i yeah so i just pull it up too far and the other leg go whoop
S0255	yeah
S0316	and obviously i have my hand on my other skate so
S0255	yeah
S0316	i literally couldn't stop myself
S0256	like the one where you pull your arm around like that and then do that
S0316	and i can't no cos i'm not that flexible so it be just a one arm
S0256	oh where you just hold it hold it up
S0316	jolly yeah
S0256	and you catch it i've do that because one minute your arm's there and the other one's there and you're like i'm go down
S0316	my whole kneecap be
S0256	yeah
S0316	literally black
S0256	yeah
S0316	and then underneath the kneecap be black too
S0256	yeah
S0316	i don't know how i'd even manage to do that
S0256	see i do that it swell up go red and then it's fine the next day and there's no bruise and i'm like but no i've i've do a few of them cos the problem with that be when you're go down you haven't get any hand cos one's above your head and the other one's hold the leg up and you've just kind of get nothing to stop yourself so you hit knees hips everything won't you
S0316	yeah
S0256	i like but
S0316	i'm just start to try and get the
S0256	but i'm wonky so it's like that so i've now gotta try and get the other one over to hold and then i can
S0316	yeah it's
S0256	but i'm do it backwards cos i'm like if i go forward cos at the minute i'm focus so much on my arm that i'll forget about my yeah
S0255	well i can't even stand up on the ice i don't even want to think about the think of stand up i just i don't know whether it's because the odd time i've do it i've obviously have the desert wellies from the
S0316	death wellies
S0255	you know the hire shop death wellies not desert wellies desperate
S0316	those death wellies
S0255	yeah so i've i've obviously have them and then just
S0256	yeah
S0255	but you not reverse your ankle so you just feel unstable and then as soon as i'm unstable i'm like i'm not do this
S0256	they have to do up nice and high
S0316	they're crap
S0256	but they're not very good in general i hate them i'd never wear another pair of them
S0316	i try them once after i'd be skate for a long time and i couldn't physically stand up they be
S0255	yeah
S0256	they're so they're really blunt and they're not very supportive and they
S0255	mm
S0256	you can't bend in them cos obviously when you're skate you're suppose to bend your knees that's like a big part of it
S0316	they're entirely wrong for your feet and your ankles
S0256	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0316	i'm amaze that more people don't have incidents
S0256	i suppose though most people that go and use them aren't gonna be go back quickly they're just generally
S0255	suppose they're just try to shuffle round
S0256	go on and go ah
S0316	learner lurch yeah
S0256	last time
S0255	yeah
S0256	but then that's be stupid
S0255	learner lurch
S0316	yeah
S0255	oh i love it it's excellent
S0256	yeah no i wouldn't
S0256	wear another pair of them ever again
S0255	ah i don't
S0316	i don't know if your mum say but i be i'm toy with the idea of get some new skate
S0255	i have
S0256	you should yeah
S0255	well i've mention the fact that you're think about maybe go in and have a bite of a skate and
S0256	yeah
S0255	yes
S0256	yeah you should cos mum be say about my old ones but i say mine be knackered like i've really knackered the support in them that's the problem
S0316	yeah
S0256	and if you're somebody that that have skate in the past you're gonna want something with a bite of support mine be just awful so like i'm gonna sell mine for about forty quid i think but they're literally you could like bend them
S0256	but for someone who's a beginner start learn to skate they're absolutely ideal but
S0316	yeah
S0256	for anyone that can actually skate it
S0316	i probably i want to get new ones but at the same time i'm not it's hard to break them in
S0256	yeah oh god yeah i hate that part of everything
S0316	so
S0256	i just hate the fact that i'm not allow to jump until they're break in like until at least they've maybe settle
S0316	i wanna jump
S0316	let me jump
S0256	don't like it
S0316	but my blades be so old now that they've pretty much be sharpen as far as they can go and
S0256	yeah the rock have like go all and mine be still quite new i need to take mine actually i need to take them to get them sharpen because i have get no edge well i have i have get an edge and anybody that doesn't normally skate would be fine with them but cos i'm so use to have a sharp edge when it get to that point and i'm like well you go through like an edge and then you start slide like okay save it save it i've get to that point a little bite long and i need to get them sharpen but i keep forget i need to
S0316	you're still enjoy it then by the sound of it
S0256	yeah love it i've get a lesson tomorrow morning so i might take them tomorrow night actually on my way home from work
S0255	mm
S0316	so what do you erm so you have lessons for free or dance or
S0256	erm yeah free i tend to do erm i do a little bite of dance but not very often i prefer free the freestyle yeah
S0316	cos i think if i go back now i'd probably do dance which be another i don't think i'd
S0256	yes
S0316	so i can't decide whether to get dance skate or erm ones
S0255	so tell me what's the difference between free and dance
S0256	erm well freestyle be like all the jump and the spin and all that sort of side of things
S0255	mm
S0256	whereas dance be the pattern and you do it to like a set piece of music as a set pattern
S0255	okay
S0256	erm but there's now also free dance
S0255	i'm now visualise line dance i hope you realise which i know be not quite what you do
S0256	it's a bite like ballroom dance
S0316	yeah it it you do it in partner generally
S0255	yes yeah yeah okay and you're actually dance on the ice rather than
S0256	careful
S0255	it's alright these knives be so sharp
S0256	yeah you're actually erm
S0255	gosh that be very lucky
S0256	you it's like ballroom dance
S0255	that's probably not the best way to do it
S0256	on the ice in a sense because it's a set pattern and set step that you do to this music
S0255	yeah okay yeah
S0256	whereas freestyle you kind of when you get a programme for freestyle it's tailor make up really
S0255	so and also so then the pair so when you see the ice skate at the olympics or something like that then the pair skate be when they're skate round but he's lift and they're do that's
S0256	okay that's that's
S0255	that's free
S0256	that's pair yeah that's pair free generally
S0255	oh yeah that's what i mean rather than dance
S0316	although the dancers do do
S0256	yeah
S0316	free interpretive style so torvill and dean be dancers
S0255	yeah
S0316	the pair
S0255	okay
S0316	you can normally they're the women be very small and the men be very big and they literally be they chuck them
S0255	i watch them
S0316	they spin so it's
S0255	right
S0316	all about spin and jump and
S0256	yeah
S0255	which be like when they do the what's that famous dance on ice be it
S0256	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0255	when they do that that be that sort of thing more that they're do
S0316	yeah they go into that a bite more
S0255	yeah
S0316	it's kind of a combination between
S0255	yeah
S0316	dance well be the lower level but they do do some pair and
S0255	yeah yeah
S0256	there's yeah they start free dance now as well which be like a combination of dance and freestyle so if you don't necessarily wanna do freestyle and you don't necessarily wanna do dance cos it's pattern
S0255	yeah
S0256	you can do free dance and it's basically you do a a number of jump and spin
S0255	so you do dance yeah
S0256	but it's more like you'll get like a jazz piece of music for example you'll do lot of twizzles and lot of
S0255	right
S0256	footsteps and footwork and stuff so it's kind of in a way a combination
S0255	okay
S0256	so you're not do that many jump and spin and you're mark a lot on your footwork and step and stuff
S0255	okay
S0256	and again the i mean the costume be different so for like a free a freestyle thing you'd have quite a short skirt with the with the dress as a girl very glitzy very sparkly for the dance you tend to have longer dress like not like ballroom length but they're they tend to be longer skirt and free dance as well longer skirt because it work better with the flow and stuff and it it look prettier in a way
S0316	it's generally erm generally do by older people isn't it
S0256	i mean it can be yeah
S0316	but lot of people do do dance when they're younger
S0256	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0256	but i mean we've get we've get a girl in my
S0255	you might do free and then go on to dance as they get older idea
S0256	yeah well we've actually get a girl at the minute who's probably about thirteen and she's start out as a freestyler and now she's do free dance and dance
S0255	mm
S0256	she's really talented at dance
S0255	yeah
S0256	and erm it depend what you enjoy i mean if you don't like throw yourself around and get bash and bruise and damage cos you tend to do that a lot more in free than you would in dance cos dance be generally if you catch a toe pick or catch your blade you will fall over but a lot of it's more about the the footwork and you're not really leave the ice that much whereas obviously with free you're spend half the time in the air or spin or you know that sort of thing so
S0255	mm
S0316	and dance blades be slightly different
S0255	mm
S0316	cos they have shorter back because erm you do and you don't need as big so the and you don't need such big toe pick
S0255	mm
S0316	because toe pick obviously give you leverage for jump
S0255	like mushroom
S0316	yeah i love mushroom
S0255	yeah
S0316	erm
S0255	that's what i think but i just want to check
S0316	so your back be smaller
S0255	yeah
S0316	and your front be smaller
S0255	right
S0256	mm my my blades at the minute be quite nice because the the back be quite short but it's not too short but it's round off a lot more erm but my toe pick i've get a cross toe so that's like ideal for jump so when you're a free skater you your blade be very much design for jump so you wanna have a toe pick that's gonna give you a lot of er of height and and strength in your jump
S0255	right
S0256	course you don't need that as a dancer because generally you don't jump
S0316	they get in the way
S0256	yeah and you can
S0255	yeah
S0256	catch them very easy and go fly when you don't want to
S0255	so what be hockey skate like then
S0256	they're completely round they don't have a toe pick at all because they don't need to use a toe pick at all
S0255	okay
S0256	for any reason they're they're just
S0255	yeah
S0316	they don't really have a back either
S0256	no
S0316	so it's literally like a erm you know one of those rolly herb blades
S0255	yeah
S0316	it's a bite like that
S0255	yeah
S0316	like attach to the bottom of a
S0255	mm
S0316	oh skate one o one
S0255	yeah
S0255	oh yeah it's it's interest cos i know when you're explain to me cos you do the test things you do which be the field move and i be like uh
S0256	yeah
S0255	now let me see if can remember field move be actually like an isolate move that they're do the actual technique that you're do
S0316	yeah
S0255	and make sure you're do that particular move right
S0316	yeah
S0255	so even though you do certain you're not do a big routine for them
S0256	no exactly
S0255	it's cos with routines
S0316	although they be link
S0256	yeah
S0255	like with routines you get mark on the like your skate ability don't you as well
S0255	and you as well as the actual things they be link okay huh
S0316	so for a field move test you would have a set of maybe i don't know how many it be
S0256	four there's four move in a set generally
S0316	and then there's a few set isn't there so you would set off
S0255	yeah
S0316	around the ice and then generally you'd go down each side that's right isn't it
S0255	yes yeah
S0316	so erm outside edge might be one of them
S0256	yeah
S0316	so you have to do
S0256	which be what i'm do at the minute
S0316	what be it
S0256	back out and in i'm do so yeah well you wanna put four or five in
S0316	four
S0256	no more than five they don't like well they don't want any less than four so four or five
S0316	it's really precise so you kind of know what pattern you're gonna make on the ice
S0255	yeah right
S0316	when you're learn them i don't know if they do the same here but they use to etch them out on the ice floor
S0256	they they do sometimes yeah
S0316	just learn to follow it
S0256	yeah
S0255	mm
S0316	erm so you'll set off
S0316	and you'll know what the next move be that you're gonna have to display
S0255	yeah
S0316	so you'll go round and do a length of four and then you'll maybe do a different move down the inside
S0256	yeah so for example my first one now that i'm do in my level two i do back outside edge down one side
S0255	yeah
S0256	and then back inside edge down the other
S0255	yeah
S0256	and you have to make it equal so if you do five on one side you gotta do five on the other if you do more on one side than the other you'll you'll lose point for it
S0255	right so it's it's very precise that you've gotta do this and this in a certain way in a certain time in a certain space
S0256	yeah
S0316	it's a certain length it's a certain distance
S0256	and i've get erm
S0255	yeah
S0256	i've get a figure of eight one as well because you'll often have a figure of eight one you normally have it'll be one or two sometimes three mine be about three of edge ones like down down the side of the rink and then you'll often have at least one figure of eight one so my figure of eight be my three turn my inside three turn and my outside three turn in a figure of eight and it have to be again five and five so if i do five outside three turn one side five the inside the other
S0255	yeah
S0256	it's just it's just kind of display the skate basics at each level so to show that yes you can do trick and yes you can do this and yes you can do that but you can do skate basics as well
S0255	okay
S0256	and i'm look forward to level three level three oh i'm really not actually i've get a two a spirally one where you go from an outside edge to an inside edge which be not fun kind of end up swim but it doesn't quite turn and i've gotta do back and forward like inside and outside three turn which i don't really like either so i'm not look forward to that one so much but 's get us work on it now already cos obviously by the time i pass my two i need to be work on my three so that i can get ready to start put it in once it's ready so mm beer and then i've get my test for my elements level one soon as well gotta redo that
S0316	very good
S0256	yeah
S0255	but the elements one wasn't that the one where
S0256	get confuse about the group
S0255	get confuse about what you have to do so actually
S0256	she's still a relatively new coach erm
S0255	yeah
S0256	and she get muddle up into another she be she absolutely devastate that she'd do it
S0255	she be so upset wasn't she but
S0256	because i spend months and months work on my salchow to do a free jump and a salchow months and i didn't do one toe loop and then on the day i do the free jump and then do the salchow and the judge call me over and go it's very nice you've give me both the first options but you need to do a toe loop and i'm like sorry she's like you have to do a toe loop on this one so then i do it and because i hadn't do them for months it just didn't work at all
S0255	mm
S0256	because she'd she'd get muddle up between level one and level two cos level two it's the free jump or the or er free jump no you have to do a salchow i think as er something like that and you can pick between a a a a toe loop and a salchow but yeah it's erm so she get muddle up and
S0255	ah
S0256	she's pay for me to do my redo my test though so i didn't have to pay for it
S0316	yeah
S0256	cos she felt really bad but
S0316	cool
S0256	yeah yeah bless her
S0255	she's lovely isn't she
S0256	she be
S0255	yep
S0316	very good
S0255	mm
S0256	have you enjoy your skate class
S0255	yeah well the thing be
S0255	i mean the i'm already cos you always come back and tell me anyway and explain things and show things and it's quite good you've get a nice slidey floor so she can sort of do
S0316	yeah
S0256	do the skate on the floor
S0255	yeah i do yeah i do that that and then i'm do the you know so i get all of that and she play the music she's gonna do things for routines so but when she start the inside edge the outside you know although i'm listen it just go a little bite
S0256	yeah
S0255	and so and yeah so it's quite nice actually that she's when she's talk i know at skate you can talk to people but it's quite nice to talk and you understand and
S0316	mm
S0255	yeah so do you think you're gonna get some skate and go back and
S0316	it's yeah
S0255	you've be say about it for a couple of years or so haven't you
S0316	i don't i don't think i'd ever go back and do any
S0255	no
S0316	test or any competitions probably just
S0255	no no just
S0316	this be where my main erm conflict lie really cos i'd want to go back and be able to progress and do things but i don't know that i would want to invest the time and money to do
S0255	mm
S0316	lessons again which and i don't think i can do one without the other
S0256	no
S0316	i mean there be still dance club
S0256	the only people that i know that do like yeah there's a dance club on a sunday morning but the problem with that be that they don't really do the pattern and they don't really do the time they kind of just skate
S0316	and it's a sunday morning
S0256	oh yeah exactly i mean
S0316	hello
S0255	yeah
S0256	the other thing to do i mean be i know people that just have like one lesson a week
S0316	yeah
S0256	and they they just do that and they they work on what they wanna work on they don't wanna test they don't wanna do this and the coach don't push you well some of them do you have to get the right coach
S0316	yeah
S0256	there's a lot of coach there that will push you and if you don't wanna test them they you're not worth their time but they're the ones that be like try to push all the kid and whatnot but
S0256	there be ones that be quite happy just to do it at a pace and
S0316	don't feel force to open it if you want to save that for later and and drink the one that you've get open
S0255	oh i can do
S0256	i will quite happily drink
S0255	yeah no that's alright i can
S0316	whichever you prefer cos i bring that as a a just a general gift for you so you don't have to drink it now
S0255	oh thank you yeah that's fine well if you're happy with rosé
S0316	yeah of course yeah
S0255	i buy that sort of to cook with but it be just one as i wander through sainsbury's and i be pick this and that and it be i think it's a almost like a meal deal where you can buy this and this and the wine and it's like a brasserie meal and i but i didn't look at anything else cos obviously i wasn't look i be go look for mushroom and the fish counter cos i don't normally shop in sainsbury's so
S0316	it's really disorientate when you're in a supermarket that you don't know
S0255	yeah it be yeah i keep walk along think i'm sure it's over i i don't know what shop i think i be in but i keep think i'm sure actually it's i be think about tesco's in so i be walk along think just there if i look at these aisles and all i could see be hardware and
S0255	tellys and clothe and and then i sort of spot fresh fish on i think oh right yeah so i go there and it surprise me actually how the cos i go into morrisons age ago and i be make decide to make us a paella didn't i
S0256	i don't know yes i do
S0255	remember i make you a paella
S0256	i remember you make me a paella but i don't know what you be do with it
S0255	yeah i decide cos it be when start be away and he didn't use to eat as much fish he eat more now cos i've start
S0316	yeah
S0255	you know do a lot more things but we love fish
S0316	just sneak it in
S0255	yeah and cos i do a lot of flavour things with it he's
S0316	yeah
S0255	he's actually oh actually i quite like this now yes you just never know you didn't like you think you didn't
S0255	like it because you never really try it but actually now you do so i say oh i'll do something with fish and then i think actually i might make a paella cos i haven't make one before but that'll be nice
S0316	yeah
S0255	i know you'd like it and give you food for the next day as well so yeah so i go into the fish counter and i think right i i say i'm make a paella and this guy he be like oh right he say i say so what what shall i put in it i say obviously that and that and he say oh well what i like and if you have duh duh and oh octopus and there's that he say actually let me just take the bite out and he's
S0255	and he be like really really knowledgeable so i go today and think yeah i just wanna get some salmon and i know sort of what i be do with it anyway but i say to the guy i say oh just out of interest i say what i'm gonna do it in red wine with herbs i say what herbs would you recommend to go with it he say i dunno i don't really eat a lot of fish
S0255	i'm like oh right he go yeah i i'm more of a meat eater you know give me a steak any day and i be like
S0316	that's not helpful
S0255	okay no that's what i and i don't cos it be next to the meat counter and i don't know whether it be just the time when he be cover both or stuff like that but
S0316	yeah morrisons kind of pride themselves on have professionalism like that though haven't they
S0255	yeah really like market yeah yeah
S0256	tesco's be good at that as well actually cos i
S0255	mm
S0256	when i've be there there's a guy who work at the fish counter and he's really really helpful
S0255	yeah
S0256	be really helpful as well you ask them and they be oh you do this could do that
S0255	yeah he be actually yeah and he be say oh there's you can have the free butter things do you want it in a bag to cook i say no cos i'm do it like and he say you can have the free butter there's the lemon and pepper he say people tend to cook it with lemon and pepper i guess and start laugh
S0255	and i be like yeah and he and then he say actually there's all these new fish sauce they've get now whereas people so maybe i be but i mean i be do it from scratch anyway i'm not gonna keep a of butter that they've squash and put stuff in and even though it be free and i i understand
S0316	i've do it before where i've make my own which be quite a good thing actually to just
S0255	yeah
S0316	have in the freezer so
S0256	mm
S0316	like little sausages of butter that you put herbs and
S0255	okay
S0316	so you can do
S0255	that's a good idea
S0316	you just you can mash in garlic
S0255	yeah
S0316	so you can have a garlic butter
S0255	mm
S0316	and you literally do it in cling film roll it into a sausage
S0255	mm
S0316	and then you can slice off slice as you go erm and
S0255	yeah
S0316	then just i normally pop some onto the fish in a foil
S0255	that's a really good idea actually
S0316	tent
S0255	yeah
S0316	and then just oven bake it
S0316	you can put chillies in
S0255	yeah
S0316	you can put herbs
S0256	mm i do that with a parsley once with cod once where i do parsley
S0255	mm yeah in a bag yeah in a butter thing
S0256	put it in the
S0255	yeah
S0256	tin foil and
S0255	my friend the other night come and she be say that she somebody give her the idea of erm like garlic and ginger and that things that you'd normally put to cook in and blitz load in your food processor and put it in jar
S0316	yeah
S0255	she say and you've just get it already make and i'm like yeah that's a good idea too
S0256	or you could just buy the very lazy garlic and
S0255	could just buy the lazy garlic
S0316	my erm the guy that teach me when i do my curry lessons at the college
S0255	i remember you do that
S0316	he advise do the freeze of garlic and ginger
S0255	mm
S0316	because you can put it in and it doesn't really matter you can put it in freeze it doesn't matter about the water
S0256	mm
S0316	cos that just burn off
S0255	yeah yeah that be a really good idea
S0316	i love tip like that from people
S0256	do you
S0255	yeah
S0316	i wish people talk about what they cook more really cos i think
S0256	it would be useful
S0316	yeah i do love to cook but i don't really have enough time or energy
S0255	i like to cook if i've get the time it's it's the same thing really isn't it you know
S0316	well
S0255	spend so much time just rush in and try to shove something together and do you remember to get the meat out in the morning and which be our normal thing isn't it we let's have mince then
S0255	cos you can do that from freeze
S0316	i really struggle at the moment to get a balance between shop and
S0255	mm
S0316	have time to shop and buy
S0255	yeah
S0316	too much and waste food and
S0255	yeah
S0316	get to a point where i don't really have anything in my house so i've actually resort for the first time in a long time to buy stuff that i'm actually go to able to make into meals so like
S0256	mm
S0316	so i've buy some
S0255	yeah
S0316	freeze meals for example which i've kind of turn my nose up at a little bite but actually it's what i've get time for and sometimes
S0255	yeah
S0256	mm
S0316	i'd rather do that than end up i often have a loaf of freeze bread and egg and like have
S0255	yeah well you can get bread out can't you
S0316	poach egg on toast sometimes four time a week if i'm
S0255	but what what you want to do that mean buy extra and cook more and freeze it so when you're make something with chicken make yourself enough
S0316	yeah
S0255	for three or four meals and then freeze it in meal portion and then you know when you haven't get time
S0316	yeah
S0255	then you pull something out and you just have to defrost it in the morning
S0316	i do but i'm also away most weekend so i don't even have weekend
S0256	mm
S0316	cook time
S0255	yeah so
S0316	can't complain my social diary's be crazy for
S0255	yeah
S0316	the last few months but
S0255	what've you be do
S0316	just all sort of bits really and
S0255	mm
S0316	make the effort to go and see friends and
S0255	yeah
S0316	it's important isn't it
S0255	oh yeah yeah definitely definitely be
S0316	but i've do the quite a lot of worky bits as well so it's be a combination
S0255	do at the cake and bake show
S0316	yeah
S0255	how do that go
S0316	yeah really well the stand look amaze
S0255	yeah
S0316	i get the best of both worlds really cos i be involve at the begin
S0255	yeah
S0316	and get to do all the fun creative bite
S0256	mm
S0316	and then i get to hand over just before it start to get all hectic and do the last bits and then i so i just i be only there to go out for a dinner with and see how the things work out
S0255	of course yes yeah it be you
S0316	go on a nice river thames

S0316	i do appreciate all these perk that i get
S0255	oh
S0316	i'm i'm very lucky
S0255	the thing be you do work very hard you know what i mean so you
S0316	it's
S0255	and what you do really benefit the business so
S0316	i'd like to think so

S0255	right
S0316	and then i get promote then to commercial project programme manager
S0255	right
S0316	and then when i go back into brand i be obviously a senior project manager so they couldn't make me
S0255	yeah just a
S0316	just a brand manager
S0255	no
S0316	so i be then a senior brand manager
S0255	yeah
S0316	and i have be since so i be yeah so for the last eighteen months while i've be back in brand i've be senior
S0255	yeah so what's happen with the car
S0316	nothing

S0316	well i be get one er they're reallocate be the thing so i put my order in it be approve
S0255	uhu yeah yes i remember
S0316	two weeks after we're not issue the cars
S0255	mm mm
S0316	which be fair enough i do understand it
S0255	yeah
S0316	but it's piss me off
S0255	yeah
S0316	erm more
S0255	which i understand
S0316	much more than i expect it to so it's a really like
S0255	it's part of your term and condition be you get x y z and one of those things be that you get
S0316	a new car every four years
S0255	a new car every four years yeah exactly
S0316	and i i've surprise myself with how much it have piss me off
S0255	yeah
S0316	and it so it's a really deep emotional reaction
S0255	mm
S0316	because i feel also like i've be loyal to them they're not look after me
S0255	yeah
S0316	and they say that they want me to they say that they value me but do they really if they're go to start mess my benefit
S0255	yeah
S0316	so but erm so the the latest status be erm the date be by the end of august we would have a list of the cars that we would be reallocate so i don't
S0255	yeah
S0316	know how it work exactly but basically there's a number of cars and they will try and reallocate them
S0255	so will they say we suggest this to you or do they say here's a well here here's a list you can choose you might have four people go for one car mightn't you
S0316	i don't really know well i think so and then i think they try and match you up
S0255	yeah
S0316	but i think you you don't have to take any car that you don't want i can opt out at any point
S0255	that's fair enough
S0316	erm
S0255	you can what oh opt out
S0316	i can opt out because mine's a benefit car
S0255	right okay
S0316	erm but it doesn't really work out better for me i don't want them to know that i could opt out for a little while buy a really cheap car and then opt back in once all the cars have go be one option erm
S0255	yes
S0316	i don't know how the financial stuff work because obviously i think they match your contribution so that
S0255	yeah
S0316	my contribution but i don't think they do on tax but as far as i can see i don't want to be any worse off financially at all with a car that i don't want
S0255	well obviously not no
S0316	you have to keep the car till the end of its lease so
S0255	yeah
S0316	a lot of them be two years old so i'd have another two years to wait
S0255	yeah
S0316	unless i get a high mileage car
S0255	mm
S0316	i just want my car that i've choose and spend four months choose
S0255	well yeah it's yeah yeah exactly i mean that's it be
S0316	they've completely underestimate how important this be to me
S0255	yeah
S0316	's involve which be embarrass erm
S0255	what's 's view
S0316	erm he understand why i'm piss off and he doesn't want me he say
S0255	mm
S0316	don't make any decisions without come and talk to me about it
S0255	yeah
S0316	erm he say i want to make sure you get the best deal
S0255	mm that's fair enough
S0316	i think i would leave over something like this you know
S0255	yeah
S0316	i wouldn't
S0255	well you've be umming and ahing a bite for a while haven't you on and off
S0316	well do you know what

S0255	yeah
S0316	as soon as i've get a cv i'm go to go out for other job
S0255	yeah
S0316	it's as simple as that and they're not sort it out
S0255	it mean you can choose whether to take it or not can't you and
S0316	yeah
S0255	why not
S0316	erm they're not choose to sort it out so er can't be that important but at the moment it's with bloom who be ineffective and it's not
S0255	yeah
S0316	it's not now the business's choice it's his choice i've send him a little prompt thing today but like if i have to get my own car and i have to get a loan and things it's

S0255	mm yeah thank you mm
S0316	you know i'm just down the road and always will to help out
S0255	yeah no that's no that's lovely it's erm it's what so many people be say that which be lovely so i'll probably as people be come if i do need something or want something then
S0316	make sure you do use people
S0255	you know yeah yeah i will do
S0255	i think for me if if if even more when people be here say can you lift that and do that and you know if we're cook actually you need to be do it you know oh i'll invite people round to come and cook
S0316	i can cook i'll come and cook for you
S0255	oh that'll be lovely
S0316	yeah

S0255	i'm gonna have open house on a rota two people a week come to cook cos 's gonna cook will
S0316	mm
S0255	oh you would've laugh i sit yesterday i think i'm gonna cook and get stuff because obviously if 's skate you know et cetera if but i'm gonna quite a lot of time i might actually just need food and not be able to get anything so i i go to buy load of meat er i i get erm you know like the chinese the tin foil things with the lid
S0316	mm
S0255	i get twenty five of those and i make various spag bols mild chilli so can have some when she's there hot chilli and four different curry and i spend the whole day just cook on and off get them all up and they're all in the freezer so
S0316	bet you felt like a domestic goddess
S0255	mm
S0316	i love it when i have days like that
S0255	yeah i actually i wake up this morning walk through
S0255	and there be just that slight like nice smell of cook yeah not when it's last night's meal now smell horrible but it be just this real like mm restauranty cook smell i think oh yes mm very productive so
S0316	that's a really good idea
S0255	mm
S0316	those
S0255	mm
S0316	yeah you could
S0255	i should
S0316	you could mark people
S0255	basically they've say i can't i can't lift a saucepan again for five or six weeks erm you have to let it heal doesn't matter how good your core strength be now whatever you've be cut through your muscle
S0316	it's not worth it
S0255	she say everyone say oh you can't lift a kettle these days if you get a light kettle after a couple of weeks you probably could as long as you don't fill it but i've get hot water on my coffee machine so i can do coffee hot water on that
S0316	nescafé lift the pod
S0255	nescafé oh the nespresso yeah
S0255	yeah although i've get the other one which be erm the grind bean one bean to cup so yeah but i've get plenty of stuff like that so yeah that's that and then i've get to go back to the doctor one or two weeks after the op erm just so and then she's gonna monitor me through go through because the main yes it's the physical side and get it do but the main thing with me be because when they give me those injections and i shoot through the menopause and back and it be how it affect me and that be gonna happen
S0316	yeah
S0255	potentially again
S0316	mm
S0255	even now i'm more positive and yay yay erm because i'm gonna go straight to the end of the menopause again so have go back into it i'm gonna go right to the end of it so she's gonna monitor and she say we'll try and avoid hrt she be say what do i think about hrt and i say to be honest when you're on it you're always gonna have to come off it eventually i'd rather sort of manage erm and she say yeah that that's her view as well she's
S0316	mm
S0255	quite happy to do that so she's gonna basically manage how i be my symptoms and get me to be me who i be
S0316	mm
S0255	even if it's a slightly new me erm without do that hopefully and occupational health say twelve weeks before i can come back to work because they want to make sure if that's sort
S0316	mm
S0255	erm and hr be say that's january if if your doctor occupational health whoever say it need to be february it'll be february but i'm think in my mind i should be come back january
S0316	mm
S0255	erm from hr basically say she doesn't want me to have a date in my mind and then nearer the time it's not happen or not work for whatever reason and that then make me crash down
S0316	she seem nice what do you think
S0255	she she be great yeah really really good mm
S0316	i've only see her on a er not really on a basis but
S0255	yeah she be
S0316	she be really nice
S0255	mm yeah mm cos i speak to her about erm can i apply for other job when i'm off sick idea that if i see something
S0316	yeah
S0255	and she say yeah absolutely she say what you've get to think at the moment be be you up to do a full interview come in present do whatever i say no probably not she say that's fine she say but what we'll look at potentially november time she say we'll get occupational health involve again you know you then look and see if there's see if there's something come up like i've see the customer manager uk retail
S0316	mm
S0255	spot that today so i'm gonna mention that cos i'd seriously like to be in the mix for that
S0316	yeah
S0255	erm
S0316	i can't work out whose job that be
S0255	well it's probably 's i would've think
S0316	it's get on there
S0255	have it
S0316	mm
S0255	oh even better i don't mean even better cos i don't wanna work for or whoever but erm i know 's be tell i'd love to come and work in retail erm in the team and to er hasn't apparently say to really want to come and work for you so but yeah i mean i'm i'm gonna definitely flag that and say i know i'm about to go in but can i get you know bring into the mix if people be be shuffle round
S0316	yeah
S0255	erm but she say essentially we need to be look at if i'm come back in january for a role that's gonna be for then so
S0316	be you look to move away from
S0255	mm
S0316	don't blame you
S0255	mm but again that's something occupational health say that they would work with me when it be time for come back look at that because i've speak to them at the time about all that side
S0316	yeah of course
S0255	and they say at the moment we need we need to look at your health and what's happen with this and you need to be off for a long time because of that that that but at the moment we don't wanna start say oh and when she come back they say we'll shelve that i know about it
S0316	you can think about that when you're come back
S0255	yeah exactly exactly i do say to when i when i'm through this and come back i say you know i'm not sure how i'm gonna be i say but i may come back all gun blaze erm and actually start fight my corner and you know i know i say at the time i wasn't gonna do a grievance even though you suggest i ought to maybe
S0316	mm
S0255	erm i you know and she be like right so i think i'm gonna keep that on a so i'm i'm hop that i'll see occupational health and it'll be manage in the business that i come back do something different with somebody else and then everyone can be happy can't they
S0316	mm
S0255	mm
S0256	can we erm i've print off the criteria for the dep roles
S0255	okay
S0256	we can look at it at some point
S0255	mm certainly
S0256	erm i've speak to already and she say like what the what's best to do be to focus on what you've do in this job not like in any other job
S0255	right
S0256	because it's like an internal expression of interest
S0255	yeah
S0256	you know they wanna know what you've do in this role to make you think you're qualify which be apparently there's there be gonna be probably more than one role because 's already get a role because she's mean to be do an eo job and then they've really muck her around
S0255	mm
S0256	and say oh well you're not train oh no actually it's because you've get so many weeks book off holiday in december and they can't make up their mind what the reason be but now all of a sudden she's not allow to go and do this eo job
S0255	mm
S0256	so she's now be train to be a dep so that when another eo position come up she will be train already pretty much
S0255	mm
S0256	to be an eo and she'll have a bite of experience of it anyway but then also erm you know she's first on the list basically if an eo role come available but she'll be give preference for it
S0255	what do she think about be train to be a dep
S0256	she's not very happy she say
S0255	no
S0256	she feel like it's a consolation prize cos she's be
S0255	mm
S0256	offer a job as an eo
S0255	well it'll be different money won't it
S0256	it be a bite more than a dep but not a lot
S0255	mm well a dep's more but an eo would be even more wouldn't it
S0256	yeah exactly but erm i've get the detail of it and she say like erm to mention like when you've help other people and so so like mention the fact that we're from not local with the team
S0255	mm
S0256	i've help them by where obviously they're they're struggle in certain areas i've i've give them information i've get and copy it and give it to them she go yeah
S0255	mm
S0256	and i go and i've also mention like the fact that i often take on more work than other people so like if they're if someone like be miss a and there's work be
S0255	yeah
S0256	it's suppose to go to them i'll go oh i'll take it
S0255	yeah
S0256	or like when you know people be go home for the day and i'll go no give it to me seriously give it to me i'll do it
S0255	yeah
S0256	to that person's
S0316	yeah
S0255	mm that sort of stuff and also the fact that the amount of stuff you put through be a lot more than a lot of other people isn't it
S0256	i don't know be you do we not don't know because
S0255	yeah okay
S0256	but last week i get two hundred and actually two hundred and twenty bear in mind i have a flex day half i do half a day on friday and the system be down for part of friday
S0255	mm mm
S0256	that be only thirty off the target and we be low on examiners as well so she say that be really good
S0255	mm
S0256	oh my erm eqa score's go back up to ninety seven point ninety eight point seven
S0255	do you ever find out what it be that you be do that be
S0256	i get i have one thing confirm what it be but erm it be something i didn't even realise you have to do but the others she's still try to find out
S0255	mm
S0256	so i don't know
S0316	be you still at the
S0256	mm
S0316	how be you enjoy it
S0256	yeah it's really good i'm i i really like it and to go through a
S0316	mm
S0256	deputy to a leader role
S0316	mm
S0256	that's my boss basically say to me there's one come up she think we'd be good at it she's mention it to people that she think would benefit from it and do i want these when it come up and i say yes please
S0316	that's really good
S0256	mm so
S0255	that be good yeah
S0316	cos it take you long enough to get in after all all the
S0256	yeah yeah they're really strict with security check
S0316	all the hoop that you have to jump through
S0256	i know it it's
S0255	mm
S0256	it's mental but everyone will go through the same thing
S0316	yeah
S0256	because it's obviously it's such a strict work environment like you have to sign the official secrets act and you have to you can't talk about certain things outside of work if you do you'll get in trouble and it's really really strict the rule like in some place the rule be there but if you bend them you'll probably get a bite of a slap on the wrist like at ours if you search for
S0316	mm
S0256	anybody on our system that you're not suppose to search for you'll get sack straight away there's no way around it you will just be sack
S0316	mm
S0256	they they're really really strict on like rule and stuff cos obviously if you if you mention something in front of someone and then they go and it get into the paper you it's your fault and you'll again you'll probably get sack for it it's it's
S0316	mm
S0256	like they're real real strict
S0316	mm
S0256	you can see why cos it's a lot of personal information for a lot of people that we've get our hand on
S0316	as soon as you get a passport you have citizenship and that's the gateway to
S0256	exactly yeah yeah
S0255	mm
S0316	a lot of other erm activities
S0256	things like we we've get to be really careful and and check people have citizenship and like for people's children and stuff you have to make sure that they their child have the right to a a passport because
S0316	yeah
S0256	just be bear in the uk doesn't entitle you to be a
S0316	mm
S0256	british citizen anymore it use to but after nineteen eighty three it stop
S0316	it's tough
S0255	when they be talk about do the scottish vote that be all everybody where you be work then people be say
S0256	it's gonna affect it but we don't know how they can't really make the rule or the decisions now because obviously they haven't vote yet and until they vote we we can't make any decisions on what's gonna happen
S0255	mm
S0256	yeah we're issue these passports go they're allow it at the minute but tomorrow they might not be and be we suppose
S0255	mm
S0256	to keep issue them now and
S0316	yeah
S0256	but it be cos we weren't tell anything because they
S0255	because they hadn't make a decision
S0256	well we just kind of carry on and cos
S0255	yeah
S0256	we weren't tell any different but
S0255	yeah if it's issue under the regulations at the time even if the regulations
S0256	yeah
S0255	change the next day it be issue right at the time wasn't it
S0316	yeah absolutely
S0256	exactly that's the main point
S0255	but as you say if if it someone's issue something you have to check whether the parent's bear in the uk
S0256	yeah
S0255	if they're scottish then you know they suddenly couldn't maybe weren't bear in the uk cos scotland isn't part of the uk it be
S0316	no
S0255	just
S0256	it be we be all worry it be gonna be a problem with that actually
S0255	mm
S0316	at least it didn't change
S0256	but it wasn't yeah exactly
S0316	be able to cope entirely
S0256	no exactly i mean it it happen when we get quiet anyway so it it wouldn't've be too big a deal cos it we we'd we'd finish their the in the summer that we that they always get erm but er yeah er least at that point it wasn't like
S0316	so you've survive a summer now
S0256	yeah
S0316	all the er
S0256	yeah
S0255	mm
S0256	see now we're do things from like last week or the week before so i don't you know it's all we're
S0255	mm
S0256	we're really quiet now but erm it's quite nice cos we can do other things and like we can start look at the roles and discuss more about our our managers about go departments and there's a lot more you can do when it get quieter and they've do a lot of
S0316	apart from just have to get through
S0256	yeah exactly and they've do a massive shuffle round so no end of people as the rush be like finish have suddenly go off to different departments because they apply for the roles but the change didn't happen until it would quieten down
S0316	yeah
S0256	cos otherwise if you move people that have experience from one area to another and you get people
S0255	mm
S0256	from another area that don't know what they're do you've gotta train them so yes they be hire staff at that point but they be keep it regulate whereas
S0255	mm
S0256	if you shift all the experience people off kind of cause more problems so they didn't they wait and now pretty much load of people have move all the load of boss have move round
S0255	mm mm
S0316	it's good to know for when you're plan your next move isn't it
S0256	shuffle yeah exactly
S0316	in term of plan
S0256	yeah
S0316	that be delicious thank you very much
S0255	mm
S0256	mm
S0255	thank you i be just think i can actually probably eat that every night
S0255	just with slightly different tweak of flavour and stuff but it be just
S0256	i'd probably get feed up if i have it every night
S0255	but anyway
S0256	for the record let's just put that put that down there
S0255	okay okay that's fine every other night
S0255	no i er thing be it's so quick and easy
S0316	mm
S0255	and it's so tasty and when i say i've get a splash of wine with it it just
S0316	mm
S0255	just really make it nice and you can mm anyway
S0316	i never think about add wine to salmon before
S0255	mm no you do know the rule add wine to everything
S0316	there's an amaze erm
S0316	there's an amaze billington's recipe for
S0255	mm
S0316	sticky salmon marinade
S0255	mm
S0316	oh i can make that for you one day
S0255	mm
S0316	when i'm round i could pop the marinade in in the morning i'll drop by on my way to work and be like right fish be marinate in there
S0255	sound good
S0316	and er
S0255	mm
S0316	cos that's really tasty
S0255	yeah excellent mm

S0316	ah
S0255	not that you get anything for do but it's just it it you know it's a thing to do but i've find and the ones that've come through the book that i go it's really sort of obscure book and they're obviously older book cos that's why they're cheaper

S0316	and then if you do i think i normally try and do three or four step
S0255	mm
S0316	so you link in to one of those and then it kind of take you off on a little journey
S0255	yeah
S0316	and then you pick an obscure book
S0255	yeah
S0316	and obviously one that's get quite a good rat
S0255	yes yeah

S0255	yeah mm
S0316	i'm read one at the moment call shadow of the sun erm
S0255	right
S0316	my african life it's a a polish journalist who's spend a lot of his life in africa
S0255	mm
S0316	who's there erm late seventies i think when they be a lot of the countries be experience erm
S0255	well it be idi amin wasn't it and
S0316	coup d'états and
S0255	yeah
S0316	dictatorships
S0255	yeah
S0316	and erm the difficult famines in rwanda and
S0255	yeah
S0316	the genocide there and
S0255	mm
S0316	just he seem to have be in touch with a lot of kind of the difficult history bits of africa
S0255	right
S0316	and i hadn't really ever appreciate it or think a huge amount
S0255	no
S0316	about it but it's such a sad story cos the country as a whole be just decimate by power struggle and
S0255	mm
S0316	poor farm and just poverty and erm and even it talk about the slave trade how the period where the colonists be take large amount of people out of africa to
S0255	yeah
S0316	begin the slave trade in other countries
S0255	mm
S0316	just decimate their population and you never really think about it that way do you cos you
S0255	mm
S0316	know about slave trade and you've hear
S0255	yeah
S0316	about that and
S0255	yeah
S0316	obviously just have read go with the wind that's an interest one as well
S0255	yeah yeah
S0316	but i never think about the fact that it be take away part of the economy of africa
S0255	mm
S0316	and leave this big hole
S0255	yeah
S0316	which have never really be replenish
S0255	no no
S0316	and then also create a lot of the racism stigmas
S0255	mm
S0316	that african people feel these
S0255	mm
S0316	still feel today and
S0255	yeah yeah
S0316	so a lot of like apartheid and things link right back into the root
S0255	yeah yeah to that mm
S0316	just because it be so traumatic to the country
S0255	yeah yeah
S0316	but i never really think about it that way before

S0316	mm mm
S0316	i love things like that
S0255	cos the film with miranda richardson i mean everyone think of her as in blackadder and be the comedian but she's an absolutely brilliant actress and i i'm pretty sure it be with rupert everett in it and the two of i it be just yeah well it's it's old i've watch it years ago
S0316	oh i do love a bite of a period drama as well though
S0255	yeah yeah yeah and it it be just i really really love the film

S0316	cool
S0255	something you

S0255	yes
S0316	you've start something
S0255	yeah find out about something and yeah
S0316	i er when i come back from berlin actually i start to read mein kampf
S0255	oh yes
S0316	which be a bite controversial
S0255	yeah
S0316	i think but erm other book get in the way cos it's not the
S0255	be it a bite heavy
S0316	erm he's just not a very skilful author
S0255	mm
S0316	erm and that's one of the things that a lot of people say but i'm
S0255	yeah
S0316	i be actually go to go back to it now when i've finish that shadow of the sun i think just because
S0255	mm
S0316	erm it fascinate me how he be so enigmatic
S0255	yeah
S0316	how he be able to be
S0255	yes the best dictators be aren't they well not yeah well i suppose it's like the you look at what's his name in korea now he's not very enigmatic that's just brute force do it so
S0316	yeah
S0255	whereas hitler actually he get the people follow him didn't he
S0316	and also just how he build some of his ideologies cos
S0255	mm
S0316	it doesn't go into it in a huge amount of detail but early on in the book it do talk about his younger years and
S0255	mm
S0316	i don't know how far i'll get it's a pretty big book
S0255	yeah
S0316	and it's and apparently it's just not very well write so it's
S0255	mm
S0316	a bite like persevere with
S0255	you might find at the start you might actually think and skim read off yeah read quite quickly certain bits and then something'll interest you and you'll read a page or two
S0316	yeah
S0255	really in depth yeah
S0316	but i be interest when i come back from berlin to read that
S0255	yeah so what be you in berlin for
S0316	that be last year for my birthday
S0255	oh that's right with your mum and your auntie
S0316	yeah
S0255	and yes i remember all that yeah
S0316	and er it's just a wound city
S0255	mm
S0316	it's a little bite like erm kind of wear its scar but it's survive and it's
S0255	yeah
S0316	come out the other side which be really
S0255	mm
S0316	i think it's really encourage cos hopefully some other countries that at the moment be just ravage by war
S0255	yeah
S0316	hopefully they can get to a point
S0255	yeah
S0316	where
S0255	yeah
S0316	erm they come out the other side and it's more stable and
S0255	in in the future mm yeah
S0316	fifty years down the line because this be within our lifetimes as well that's one of the things
S0255	yeah
S0316	that's so
S0255	oh yeah yes
S0316	astound
S0255	yeah
S0316	and then after hitler the wall and the
S0255	mm
S0316	it just be a savage it be savage as a
S0255	mm
S0316	country but
S0255	mm
S0316	i just find it fascinate
S0255	mm
S0316	history and people's
S0255	yeah
S0316	live i think actually more than
S0255	yeah
S0316	history
S0255	cos i i find that we at school at history we be do iron man you know the iron age one not iron man that's a
S0316	x men
S0255	erm oh yeah no i i be iron man that's erm black sabbath isn't it yeah it's
S0256	it's also a film
S0255	it's a music thing yes iron
S0316	iron maiden be you think
S0255	iron man iron maiden be it i be iron man
S0316	iron man be robert downey junior in
S0255	i be iron man
S0316	oh
S0255	no it's a song it's a it's it's a black sabbath song
S0316	oh
S0255	yeah so no i'm not gonna sing it all but yeah it's a black sabbath song iron man but anyway yes erm
S0316	you be do that at school
S0255	no i i wish we be
S0316	oh
S0255	no we be do all about the iron age and
S0316	right
S0255	you you know it's and i be think i want to learn about the first world war and the second world war
S0316	the first world war
S0255	and people's live what they be like and why things happen and and you didn't i just think
S0256	actually i i i be just as interest in history just about things that have happen and stuff
S0255	mm
S0256	less less about the actual people involve just more about like the events and stuff
S0255	yeah
S0256	cos we go to the somme ground and that be really cool
S0255	i remember you do yeah
S0316	oh
S0255	you say that be really powerful wasn't it
S0256	yeah it be really good cos like you think about it like
S0316	mm
S0256	all those people that die where you're stand that's really
S0316	mm
S0256	bizarre but yeah no it be good i mean i like things like that i find that sort of stuff interest but then i think i now i find more interest like erm i can't think what the word my brain be not function with word at the minute but like you know when you talk about like the universe and like all that sort of stuff
S0316	mm
S0256	when you go down that kind of route i like
S0316	mm
S0256	talk about that sort of stuff now
S0316	mm
S0256	and think about that and
S0316	what's the point of evolution and
S0256	like philosophical think and stuff yeah i like i like think about all that sort of stuff and like
S0255	yeah
S0256	it's good fun i have chat and one of my mat be quite similar she do as well so whenever we get together we end up have random conversations about but even then i still make her brain hurt
S0255	mm
S0256	when i'm talk about the universe and like what's it expand into if there be nothing and that's why when what's his name brian cox isn't it the the guy that be on the one show last night
S0316	yes
S0256	erm although he annoy me a little bite what he actually talk about i find it really fascinate and really interest and i'm like
S0255	mm
S0256	the fact that there's there's universe be be create all the time be sort of like the the new theory
S0255	mm
S0256	they're be create but my mind then go where be they be create and what be they be create into and
S0255	yeah cos there's nothing there
S0256	exactly
S0256	there's nothing there so there's
S0255	yeah
S0256	gotta be something there and like i start talk about it to my friends my even then sometimes my friend's like you're make my brain hurt and i'm like yeah but it's really fascinate if you think about
S0255	yeah
S0256	this
S0255	mm mm
S0256	i like all that sort of stuff which
S0255	yeah
S0256	most people kind of go
S0255	i don't
S0256	ah it make their brain ache
S0255	no cos
S0256	and it make them scar as well when you start think about things like that
S0316	one of my favourite
S0256	i dunno
S0316	facts be that there's more star in the sky
S0255	mm
S0316	than there be grain of sand on every single beach
S0255	mm
S0256	mm
S0316	on every single surface in the in the land
S0255	in desert yeah wow
S0256	cos it's so big isn't it
S0255	mm
S0256	even our universe be so well massive
S0316	cos you think what grain of sand the
S0255	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0316	then you think actually
S0255	there's more star
S0316	there's more star
S0255	i love the fact that
S0316	i don't know how they prove that or know it
S0255	yeah need lot of lot of calculations
S0316	i suppose they they calculate for the earth
S0256	what they'd do be they'd look at the the area of where we where we know what we know already and
S0255	mm
S0256	they'd work out how many
S0316	yeah
S0256	they know they'd be able to calculate how
S0255	yeah
S0256	many star be say in our milky way they'd work out how roughly how many milky ways they know be in the universe and
S0255	mm
S0256	for each like section they'd know well there's that many so there's gonna be roughly that many in a new section how big they believe the universe be and they'd just multiply it but yeah
S0316	and the same universe for sand
S0255	i i be just gonna say well who do you think count all the grain of sand
S0256	i dunno but they know roughly again like if you've get in a certain square section of sand how many you've get
S0255	one two three four
S0256	there's gonna be roughly the same on each one you know many square feet the
S0316	sixteen fourteen thirteen
S0256	the beach be
S0316	eight
S0256	how many beach there be in the world how many square feet there be in those beach and how much there be in one square feet i think
S0255	yeah what about the sahara desert
S0256	they know how big it be don't they they're not they know how big the sahara desert be in square feet so they'll be able to work it out that way
S0255	yes mm mm erm i'm more interest in
S0255	in at look at the world war yes i'm interest in a bite with how it happen and what you know that sort of thing but i'm more interest in the day to day live of the people
S0316	yeah
S0255	of actually you know the clothe they wear where they build the clothe from how where they work and what happen and the day to day what they eat and
S0316	mm
S0255	that i'm really interest in that
S0316	mm
S0255	i i mean i go along i'm i'm go i dunno where i be go do somewhere where years and years ago on a train and it be go past somewhere where you could actually look into block of flats a bite and you could see people in the kitchen windows and it be about teatime we must've be come back from wherever and some and whoever i be sit with say oh they look like they're make tea and i say oh i wonder what they're make and he go yeah and i go i wonder if the it's something they'd plan to make and
S0255	or whether they'd buy the stuff on the way home from work and whether they get stuff out maybe get the meat out this morning or and he be go what and i go
S0255	but but and but i be i would not i be gonna go and knock on the door and find out but that's how i think of
S0316	mm
S0255	they're they're cook yeah what be they actually cook and why and be it a last minute be they cook for people be have they get kid at the feet
S0316	maybe you should move into erm consumer insights
S0255	yeah oh be that what they do wonder what
S0316	yeah essentially just
S0255	wonder if people manage to get the meat out in the morning or whether they're have to do
S0316	well i'm not sure that's a frequently research question but erm
S0316	just in term of that
S0316	interest in dig into the whys and you know
S0255	oh yeah
S0316	behaviours and
S0255	that's what i i i love find out about stuff erm
S0256	i think that show it cos i'm the opposite
S0256	i find it hard to think about other people's live and the fact
S0255	yeah
S0256	cos your life be your life isn't it and you
S0255	yeah
S0256	you forget the people that drive past you in the street i always think i forget they have a life and then that's where i leave it
S0255	mm
S0256	i just think i'm not even gonna think about their life
S0255	yeah
S0256	cos it'll confuse me
S0255	yeah
S0316	i have a really weird i be go through erm kings cross yesterday yeah i be in london yesterday yesterday and
S0255	mm
S0316	i'd i be come towards a crowd of people and i be like i wonder who's have a really shit day
S0255	yeah
S0256	mm
S0316	and i be like i wonder who's have a really good morning
S0255	yeah
S0316	i wonder where that person's go and i
S0255	yeah
S0316	just literally go into a really weird erm
S0255	yeah
S0316	kind of
S0255	i wonder if someone experience domestic violence and in this area probably somebody do this morning
S0316	oh i do go dark
S0255	didn't you
S0316	oh i do go dark
S0255	you see ah you see and then i go onto i yeah
S0256	see cos you go more into their live whereas you're think
S0255	yeah i'm the live
S0256	so you see you're like in the middle but they
S0316	i stop after those three question
S0256	you're in the middle between us two
S0316	i'm really dumb i be then like

S0316	lovely rice meals i have a
S0255	mm
S0316	noodle soup with
S0255	mm
S0316	dumplings
S0255	see i never really stop and eat at kings cross cos i'm always on the way to somewhere or on the way back from somewhere when we use to go down and watch the rugby they use to have the cornish pasty stand proper cornish pasties and we use to get off in the morning and it's like mm cornish pasty yeah mm
S0316	can't help yourself though cos it smell amaze it be almost wrong wasn't it at eight o'clock in the morning to really want a cornish pasty
S0255	ah i know ah it be really lovely yeah yeah but oh no er but we do yeah and you do and then you know that be gonna help soak the beer up that you be gonna have a little bite later on so yeah you start off with that and that be lovely but but normally i'm i'm rush through somewhere and i literally i i grab a burger king and then when i'm on the train go back eat we often do that don't we if we're down do something
S0316	yeah yeah i do
S0256	so i'm the same when i when i go skate competitions i i cos basically i i go sheffield so i go from here to doncaster then from doncaster to sheffield so generally on the way through not normally on the way there because on the way there i get there
S0255	mm
S0256	at a like lunchtime but on the way back when i finish for the day i'm normally there right until the last moment when i need to get on the train and the train be all late come back get off at donnington get a burger king at donnington and then go on to to peterborough and that's my general
S0316	that's it that's the journey
S0255	mm
S0256	yeah
S0255	when you see somebody wear a certain colour eye shadow i wonder do they look and try and that's what they do be it what the mum always wear wear or tell them have somebody tell them that they ought to wear that or do they spot it in a magazine or do they go into a shop and you know and it's like that
S0316	my eye shadow look awful today i've just
S0256	i don't even look enough to notice the eye shadow
S0255	but i if i spot something someone have something you think what be the story
S0316	i buy a new eye shadow the other day
S0255	do you
S0316	yesterday
S0255	mm
S0316	treat myself to some mac
S0255	mm some mac
S0316	and a new handbag
S0256	mm
S0255	oh i like that
S0316	mm it be a bite of an emergency purchase cos my black handbag be on a on its last legs and i take it out
S0255	mm
S0316	and er and then felt massively embarrass about it
S0255	yeah
S0316	because it's literally fall apart so erm ditch
S0255	mm
S0316	ditch and drop
S0255	mm mm dum dum di do you save the other one for just when you go somewhere really scruffy and you might need a scruffy yeah so you didn't really ditch it do you what no
S0316	no i didn't fully ditch it no
S0255	do you fold it and put it in that handbag
S0316	erm so i notice my handbag be in a dire state on sunday
S0255	yeah
S0316	and i couldn't really i go into er house of fraser and all the handbags be ridiculously expensive
S0255	mm
S0316	more than i want to spend cos i'm a bite of a i'm a bite of a ruiner i i ruin things so
S0255	mm yeah
S0316	my bag generally i don't know if that's cos i don't buy the really good quality
S0255	mm
S0316	but if i spend a hundred pound on my bag would i ruin it any less quickly than my forty pound bag
S0256	mm
S0316	i don't know
S0255	mm
S0316	i'm not really
S0255	but i quite like with bag or whatever i like it to have a slight mark of something on it cos that mean it's personal it's not brand new and it's my in mine somewhere unless it's all rub off have get green nail varnish down it somewhere
S0316	i spot that bag earlier cos i'm in bag buy mode

S0256	so i didn't even remember before oh yeah cloudzilla's a good one if you can get that cos it take you straight pretty much straight to the link erm so you have to always on the first one it'll come up with this and you click click here to play and this be just basically the the thing this be a good one because it come straight up with it and you just have to close it but some of them you'll find erm will do try to find one think it's call
S0316	so now that's get a cross through can you not watch that again
S0256	yeah you can go on it anytime you want yeah it's just grey out so this be one you've already try so basically if you try five or six to get one that actually be gonna work erm you don't click on ones you've already try so like okay so here see it's get watch and download
S0316	yeah
S0256	ignore that and you click proceed to video most of them will have i think it do a pop up anyway but most of them will have that and then in the middle again you just click the play button
S0256	and then that'll do it and that's the same for the majority of them erm if you wanna find a wake up
S0316	come on these people be look
S0256	it's just be stupid it do right so if you wanna find something there's the search bar at the top you just type it in whatever you wanna watch so

S0256	and it will actually come up with suggestions so as you start type it'll come up with suggestions so it come up with grey's anatomy because it know i watch grey's anatomy
S0256	but erm so then you just click on that and it'll take you straight in so you can watch it right from
S0316	that's amaze
S0256	the first episode
S0316	right
S0256	the the odd
S0316	have you watch suit
S0255	no
S0316	oh
S0256	the odd one or two
S0255	that's i'm get a list of stuff ready for when i've have my op because basically i'm just gonna veg for a couple of weeks and watch everything
S0316	right
S0256	yeah the odd one or two you'll find the the first season will not have any link or the second season may not have any link some of them do like i mean toddlers and tiaras i try to watch the first series and there wasn't any but it will just come up say no link
S0316	mm
S0256	so then there be other websites you can try but this have be the one that i know kind of tend to work and it have
S0316	yeah cool
S0256	it keep very up to date some of the websites i've use in the past you don't get the link to the series for like three or four weeks after it's be do
S0255	oh yeah i mean this be good it's on in america and we get it
S0256	this one literally the next day
S0255	yeah
S0256	so like er friday i'll wake up first thing and watch grey's anatomy because it'll be on there
S0255	yeah
S0256	if it's not on there first thing in the morning it's on there in the even and the other good thing
S0255	part of the problem be i need to watch grey's anatomy and scandal friday morning i be like
S0256	yeah the other good thing be it tell you the air date so this be when this be air
S0316	cool
S0256	and it tell you so you know it
S0316	mm
S0256	tell you the episode that it be the name of the episode and when it be air so you and that's that's in america when it be air so obviously it'll be different for britain for when you're up to so you need to know what series you're on in the uk to make sure you don't skip ahead because this uk typically be about at least half a season behind if not a whole season in some case like csi i think i get to almost the end of the series when it start in the uk
S0316	yeah because on scandal we're just on three
S0255	season three yeah and i watch season
S0316	on tv
S0255	yeah and i watch season three online as soon as i'd finish season two which i have to watch online because it disappear do you remember i start watch it
S0316	yes yeah

S0316	especially when he go nice
S0255	i could see yeah i could see why she would but there be something about bill
S0316	she love bill
S0255	particularly in that very first bite when he be so he be vulnerable in bits and then as the story get more and more involve and you start think well actually it who's what be it with the queen or then he's with the king or be it with this and why be he do it what about the
S0316	oh bill become the grand king as well vampire

S0255	mm mm so apple tv
S0316	mm
S0255	i've get a very nice man who basically have get it all set up so i don't know what you do with that but it that should be easy enough to find out but then once you've get it you just press your button you have a little remote control put it on apple tv which can have your it have all various things on you can then put erm your photos if you want so you could actually if you get people round you could have a selection of photos all go up on there and
S0316	mm
S0255	stuff like that and then you start play your whatever you're play
S0256	so
S0316	so what's it link to at the moment your ipad
S0255	that's
S0255	that's just apple tv
S0256	that's a screensaver
S0255	that's a that's a screensaver for apple tv so it's nothing to do with us
S0256	so what you do be there's the button here which be like the little tv with an arrow
S0316	uhu
S0256	you press that and then you do it on to apple tv and then you press play

S0256	cos you can buy movies to watch it or to rent like and stuff
S0316	because the only
S0255	mm
S0316	reason i didn't go for it because i think it be exactly the same really as have sky on demand
S0255	mm
S0316	and it almost be but actually if you think of it
S0255	think there's there's film and bits and stuff i think but we don't ever use any of that side but you could even get so if you're do stuff on the internet you can sit and actually have it with a keyboard and have it go up onto that so you could actually be sit
S0255	yeah
S0316	oh
S0256	so like if you do the scroll up a bite and then apple tv here this be mirror so if you're on like youtube or whatever

S0316	mm
S0256	for this sort of stuff

S0316	cos i do not need
S0255	yeah
S0316	weekend relationship

S0255	mm mm
S0316	could do the reverse but how knackering though
S0255	yeah and long term it yeah it's and i think as well if you look back and think well there's be relationships that haven't be right even though some bits be very good there's be this and this and they've and they've like 's go on and on and on and on and off and on and off and and off and at the end of the day it's like no it isn't gonna work it's silly in a way to start something that already be show some big things that isn't gonna work because of this and this even though everything else would be great it's almost like well it's best wait till there's somebody that be right with all the box tick erm
S0316	but he tick all of my box
S0255	yeah
S0316	just not location wise which be a big thing
S0255	yeah that's what i mean it's a it's a big thing that isn't right to start with so
S0316	yeah
S0255	yeah keep in touch with him see him again
S0316	but then part of me say i'm not there's not people like that
S0255	mm
S0316	that i get on with that well

S0255	no no no i know what you mean cos it could've be a really lovely weekend that end up you end up in bed together and that be great and and then still you're in the same position now and it's go a stage further than be friends and get
S0316	there's no yeah there's no we don't have any kind of i can't think of the right word
S0316	we yeah no there's no there's no stress and there's no we don't owe each other anything

S0316	he's very nice
S0255	yeah
S0316	gentlemanly
S0255	mm so be he definitely paris long term or
S0316	for the next three years but then he's probably in aberdeen afterwards which be almost worse

S0255	mm
S0316	and he specialise in sink large things into water

S0255	yeah mm
S0316	and survey the land
S0255	or sink the bits of oil rig that want sink not the whole thing
S0316	well he work out where they're gonna be sink
S0255	right
S0316	he doesn't do the physical sink
S0316	he just look at the land underneath and say you can sink
S0255	yeah
S0316	it here
S0255	yeah
S0316	because the structure of the earth be right and you need to
S0255	mm
S0316	anchor it in such a way that
S0255	yeah
S0316	it stay
S0255	yeah
S0316	sound so
S0255	mm
S0316	it's quite a cool job isn't it
S0255	sound like the sort of programme watch on telly and it come on it's really interest
S0256	do you have to go into a submarine to do that or do he just know
S0316	erm i think he have
S0316	a computer program
S0255	yeah go down with like a a prong thing put it on like no mm ding ding yeah
S0316	i think it sound more yeah
S0316	sonar
S0255	plop plop plop plop yeah
S0256	yeah
S0316	but he go out to nigeria and place like that so he's obviously
S0255	mm
S0316	on
S0255	yeah
S0316	fine i think it's quite a cool job
S0255	yeah
S0256	mm it do sound i've just get all these image of how it would work but i know they're
S0316	you know what i think a lot of it be
S0255	he probably do load of calculations and look at
S0256	mm
S0316	i think a lot of it's geeky kind of
S0255	yeah
S0316	computer program work and i think it
S0255	yeah mm
S0316	but so he's a nice guy so it's make me think there be other people out there
S0255	there be some nice ones that would yeah that tick all the box and that's the thing that's what you've gotta do really be that sorry 's not desperate obviously for try to get
S0316	i be a little bite
S0255	like a little bite of a okay be just slightly desperate but not really no
S0255	no she's not it just
S0255	i think you're at the stage you're at the stage that you'd quite like to be get to the relationship now that you're gonna settle with and get marry have kid or
S0316	yeah or just a relationship yeah
S0255	you just want a relationship
S0316	just anyone yeah
S0255	
S0316	who
S0255	your facebook mate from

S0255	from
S0316	no
S0255	no
S0255	no
S0316	no i'd rather be alone
S0255	anyway exactly but
S0316	sorry
S0255	but it have to be right doesn't it that's the
S0316	yeah
S0255	point you know you can have a long time in a relationship that be right on lot of level but wasn't quite right for certain reason and keep try and try and then when you weren't with him it be almost
S0316	yeah
S0255	but it be so good and so right and then when you're with him it's but this isn't right this isn't right
S0316	so wrong
S0255	well yeah yeah and it and that's fair but sometimes you have to go through that because things could've slightly change and and it might've get there but then
S0316	yeah
S0255	when it be obvious it wasn't go to it be a case of no no so it be good to know that there be people out there that you get on with really well tick all the
S0316	yeah
S0255	box apart from the fact that they're
S0316	i didn't find why he's not in a relationship though
S0255	emotional or something
S0316	i think it's cos he's be off at different weird locations and mm who know
S0255	mm
S0316	but anyway not quite right i need a nice
S0255	yeah

S0255	yeah
S0316	enjoy go off and that's his ideal thing sit

S0255	oh it's nice
S0316	when my my grandma first tell us about the boat and she say oh and there's a young man who i'll i'll meet up with for fish and chip i didn't realise at that point my dad be go i be like who be this young man that's go to meet you
S0255	yeah she's find someone that tick all the box
S0316	yeah
S0255	oh
S0316	how strange
S0255	mm
S0255	yeah well my nana she be ninety four i think
S0316	wow
S0255	well ninety three ninety four i don't see her she's in and she's quite frail now so she can't cope with anything out of the routine erm mum go over every few weeks and then she's get other sisters that be
S0316	mum's mum
S0255	my mum yeah
S0316	your mother's mum
S0255	my mum yeah so it's mum's mum yeah
S0316	yeah
S0255	yeah erm so she go over every few weeks and i do two or three time a year i'll send erm either a postcard or a little something or other you know what i mean erm just something
S0316	a little contact but a low key
S0255	yes yeah i mean you can't ring her on the phone because she's worry about the phone she think it have erm like microwave signal that go into your head she won't use a mobile go anywhere near a mobile she's convince that's gonna give you brain damage and even on a phone she struggle and
S0316	mm
S0255	so i say again mum ring her and other so like it's i get the contact but it's not obviously i'd love to go and see her but it's not happen
S0316	mm
S0255	erm but she be she always use to have er she's get quite a few food problems so she can't eat various things erm she have to have her own bread make and then she she use to eat the co op fine cut lemon marmalade yeah and then find out it be it'd be discontinue months before and because in the co op you only have what they send you and they couldn't get it et cetera et cetera mum be say you know she be really she go through a jar every weekish roughly well two weeks because she she eat it a lot erm so i say
S0316	what's she eat it with this homemade bread
S0255	toast or bread yeah yeah so so she'll have that every two weeks she basically use a whole jar of this stuff erm so i say to mum right leave it with me i'll so i get in touch with the co op erm or the people that make it for the co op and track back to that and then get them to send me the list of ingredients cos i say to mum if i can find what's in it i can then get in touch with other people that make marmalade find one that's get the same things in it and then she can have that you know so this take me literally about three months
S0255	it's by the time they get somebody who be gonna do it from the archive and then they be gonna send it and then they be gonna do and then i get it and then the people work at wasn't them cos it use to be you know it go on and you know that sort of thing
S0316	yeah yeah
S0255	in the end i manage to get hold of a company and find and it's the the the ones that we supply anyway erm yes they do this little fine cut lemon marmalade and yes it's get this and it's actually get less ingredients in than the one she be have so we know that would be fine so i organise it make it yeah can they send it don't put anything in it with any price cos you know it's about four pound delivery which she would've fall off her chair with never mind anything else send it to her and then i say to mum tell her this be come and if it's any good i'll then organise and get you know box of twelve or something yeah
S0316	crate of it yeah
S0255	to be send you know
S0316	yeah
S0255	send to her and like that and mum say erm cos apparently mum say she be eat this she say they're get this it's tesco value and it look like water almost but they be have gonna have that and try it when this one run out so mum say yeah yeah so she tell her that yes and it she be it arrive and it be there but actually she say apparently this tesco value watery thing taste really really nice and it be hardly get anything in it so it's fine for what she can have so they're gonna stick with that but she's gonna try this other one as well
S0316	mm
S0255	but actually and this be what i be gonna say be she if if i have something's gonna be deliver one of them's gonna have to stay awake at at all time but to stay awake in the day at some at every point just in case it come to hear the door so they can't both go and have a sleep for a while and i be like oh bless
S0255	you know just like please don't say anything it's because we we we can't both go to bed and have a sleep cos she live there with her erm her son
S0316	oh oh okay
S0255	who's get various medical problems and psychological problems one thing and another but yeah so basically yeah so it's no i think it be really sweet
S0316	oh cor you hope that life never get that stressful where you're so stress by everything that
S0255	yeah no yeah
S0256	the elderly get stress so easily though don't they they panic and worry about everything
S0255	yeah
S0316	it's strange isn't it cos you don't ever see yourself get to that
S0255	no
S0316	stage but
S0255	no
S0316	be it cos so much change do you think by the time that you're older or
S0255	i think yeah i think you've to stress
S0316	i can understand be scar of mobiles if you mm
S0256	because when you're like the if you know from strong from be a kid you don't have any worry when you then start school you get really busy and then from school to work you're always busy
S0255	mm mm
S0316	mm
S0256	if you have kid you're always busy
S0255	mm
S0256	and then when you get to the point of retirement and get older you've certainly get a lot of time on your hand and you've
S0316	yeah
S0256	get time to worry whereas now you don't have time to worry about whether your phone your phone's gonna melt your brain cos you need it to contact them and them and them and them and them and you need it with you at all time
S0255	mm mm
S0256	because if you don't have it with you then you can't get in contact with them and they can't get in contact with you so you don't have time to worry what it's do to your brain
S0316	yeah
S0256	think that's what it be
S0255	yeah
S0256	whereas when you're elderly you've get time to think about what it could do
S0316	unless it's already fry it
S0256	would not be bother
S0255	yeah yeah but i think as you as you get older as even like now for me i can tell the last few years what my joint and my wrists in the winter i'm get pain in my wrists and into my finger and it just just like now this last weekend 's suddenly go oh everything my rheumatism whatever and i'm think yeah and all my here and here so things like that start change you you know yeah you get the classic you can't go out two nights on the trot or else you'll really struggle that sort of thing so there's stuff like that but there's also stuff that you suddenly find you're not so confident do because things have change and things have move on and actually you know it's
S0256	mm
S0255	sort of technology and stuff yeah i'm really good i've i've get my ipad my phone i do this i do this and people be ah you're you know you can sort out problems and work out how to do things but when the telly in the lounge you have to press different things on the amp and different things on this and different things on that and to do the dvd and i say to and again and again what do i press oh it's just the dvd and the media two player or or but i can't make that register in my brain that for some reason doesn't go in
S0256	mm
S0255	and i think as you get older more and more doesn't quite go in and it doesn't quite make sense and you can't quite make it work and you're feel tire and you're this and you're that
S0316	yeah
S0255	and and all of a sudden that set you off from the confident person that you be
S0316	mm
S0256	i think it help as well though as as you i mean if you look back to say when you be younger there
S0255	mm
S0256	wasn't a great deal of technology
S0255	no
S0256	whereas when i've be young there's be a lot of technology
S0255	yeah
S0256	so i've
S0255	yeah
S0256	learn from be quite little how to use technology
S0255	yeah
S0256	and to understand technology
S0316	mm
S0255	mm
S0256	and although yes technology progress it's the same basic concept
S0255	yes
S0256	whereas phone be get more and more you know spangly dangly or whatever
S0255	yeah
S0256	but they're still the same concept of how to work a phone
S0255	yeah
S0256	so like with the remote control and it's get
S0255	mm
S0256	i've learn from be very little how to use sky and how to use
S0255	yeah yeah
S0256	a this tv remote and how to change between that and that so then when it go onto a bigger remote i still understand it because it's still the basic concept of the remote control i've be use to use as be little
S0255	yeah yeah yeah
S0256	so just still the same basic if all that change as
S0255	mm
S0256	i get older it'll be the
S0316	mm
S0256	same sort of thing if things change the way that they're do it'll be
S0255	yeah
S0256	hard but a tablet be the same as a phone so they develop this new thing the tablet
S0255	yeah
S0256	but it's the same as a phone
S0255	yeah
S0256	so i still understand how to use it from pick it up straightaway because i know how to use my phone
S0316	mm
S0255	mm
S0256	you know and i think that's it like i i try to explain erm next door have get a freeview box like a record freeview box
S0255	mm
S0256	and he's be try to record stuff
S0255	he's eighty three
S0256	yes he's eighty three he's be try to record stuff and he then can't get it back and can't find it when it's be record so i say i'd go round and show him how to do it and i figure out what he's be do there be two problems he have the first problem which i go and sort be he's get sd and hd
S0255	mm
S0256	and he's be on the wrong box so he's be push stuff on the wrong box that's why the light's on but he's not on it cos he's in the wrong box so for for example imagine you've get two cardboard box and you've get stuff in both of them if you empty stuff if the light be on on each box when it's full if you empty everything out of that box the light's still gonna be on because that one's still full
S0255	mm
S0256	so that's how it work the second problem he's have be when everything change over to digital the tvs have all change the way they work so whereas when you use to put your tv on if you have sky it would generally jump straight to your sky box
S0316	mm
S0256	or straight to your freeview box now generally when you put the telly on it will go on to erm digital tv if you've get a tv that's get digital tv it will go on to that and you have to put it onto the onto the box
S0255	mm
S0256	and he wasn't do that he be basically set a a reminder for a tv programme think he be record it and then couldn't get it back because he actually wasn't record it so i think that's remind him
S0316	reminder
S0255	mm
S0256	you have to make sure you're on hdmi twelve if you're not on that you're not gonna record and then i've write down how to record and how to get it back as well but i be try to explain it to
S0255	mm
S0256	him how he'd do it cos he didn't understand the concept of it at all
S0316	mm
S0256	and i think i mean when he be young there wasn't tvs
S0255	mm
S0256	that's why like i say again i understand tvs and how they i mean i understand a lot from as well i i
S0255	yeah
S0256	i help him with a lot of the program of the all the systems
S0255	yes she be the his apprentice and now she's she's get up to be like technician level apparently that's what
S0256	when he when he's not here i'm technical help for mum
S0255	oh yeah definitely yeah
S0316	excellent
S0256	she'll ring me and she'll go so on this and and cos i go mum you've be play she go
S0255	yeah
S0256	no i'm play here right mum no you've be push for
S0256	you've be play you've change the tv
S0255	it's like the the apple tv remote each line do either the the lounge the bedroom the din room
S0256	the lounge
S0255	yeah
S0256	the din room and she's be push that and she's change it in there
S0255	like no i i know the one that one's the lounge that the reason that be off be because all the power go off and it have to reboot and it
S0256	no it wasn't it be on to radio
S0316	we have a power cut
S0256	it doesn't go on the radio
S0316	no erm i come back at the weekend and all my cooker be off
S0316	and
S0255	yeah
S0316	my microwave and then i forget that my central heat reset
S0255	yeah yeah
S0316	and suddenly i'm freeze cold
S0255	mm
S0316	i don't know why my central heating's not come on
S0255	mm
S0316	it's cos it's only it only think it's four o'clock in the afternoon
S0255	yeah
S0256	yeah no that's definitely not the reason you've be push the remote control because it be
S0255	mm
S0256	on the radio it doesn't go on the radio when it when it the power go off
S0255	radio
S0256	it be on kiss fm

S0260	quick question if your tax code go down do you pay less tax
S0255	if your tax code go down you've you can earn less you you earn less before they start tax you
S0260	so i'll be pay more tax yeah
S0256	so you'll get
S0255	you'll be pay more tax yes
S0260	bugger me to me as you get older you don't pay so much
S0255	have your tax code go down
S0260	well i have my tax code come today
S0255	yeah
S0256	you wanna ring them and double check it's right if there's no reason for it to have change it shouldn't've change shouldn't've go down
S0255	yeah cos it normally be
S0260	only go down one
S0255	begin of april it normally change
S0260	go down one
S0256	what be you what be you go to
S0255	one what
S0260	eh
S0256	what be you what be you on
S0260	i think it be ninety eight something i'll show you cos i i think to myself
S0256	cos i'm on a thousand out i think something like that
S0255	i know have his have his tax code
S0316	i'm never on the same one at
S0255	and then it it be the normal big amount or something
S0256	i think
S0255	and it come and then it be change down to fifty eight something and i get in touch with the accountant
S0256	a think a thousand l mean you can earn ten thousand pound before you're tax
S0255	and he say
S0260	i don't pay a lot
S0255	he say oh they're this and this to you as a benefit he would write to them and and change it so
S0260	i know i don't pay a lot but i pay a hundred and thirty pound a month hundred and eighty odd
S0255	five hundred and eighty nine tax new tax code from fourteen that's really old i mean it be that's a long time ago to long time to get it cos this be for your april so you should've have this well before now but anyway
S0256	and then they'll give you a
S0255	personal allowance you're entitle to be
S0256	if they've give it you this late it you be er it'll be backdate to take it from
S0255	over seventy seven with a yearly income of less than that
S0260	i never have a tax rebate
S0256	no you won't get a rebate they'll ask you for money if they if you're they're tax you more and then you haven't be pay that amount of tax they'll they'll take some off your pension then they'll take extra
S0260	at my age you don't pay any
S0256	why not ring them and check
S0255	you get a decent pension though don't you
S0316	it's almost like they make it confuse on purpose so that people can't check
S0255	mm
S0316	i never understand when i get these letter i can't like
S0256	you need to ring them and check
S0260	i don't understand that
S0256	well there's
S0255	yeah
S0256	if there's no reason for it to have change it shouldn't've change if anything you there's be more tax allowance this year than there be the previous year cos mine's go up from like something like nine nine something l to a thousand l which mean i can earn ten thousand pound before i'm tax
S0316	so everyone can earn the same amount before they get tax
S0256	depend on what your wage be yeah it depend on what you earn
S0255	yeah
S0316	well
S0255	no every
S0316	everyone get the same amount and then there's the same amount in the next bracket you get
S0255	everybody you're entitle to ten thousand
S0260	yeah i think it's my pension you see
S0256	yeah because if you earn over thirty three thousand pound
S0316	but
S0256	a year you'll be tax at forty percent that's their bracket
S0316	but but the first ten thousand be still free
S0256	yeah you still get a certain amount yeah exactly yeah and mine's base at ten thousand l so it will
S0316	yeah
S0256	a thousand l so basically i get that and then i'm not tax any more i'm still tax quite a low amount in all honesty
S0316	that's good i get more money
S0256	oh
S0316	end of this week
S0256	then it'll be back to normal pay and on overtime
S0316	oh nice
S0316	oh it's a shame it's not extend a little bite further cos
S0256	we do this massive incentive of like a stupid amount of hours
S0316	but be that to get through a really tough period
S0256	yeah they already offer like overtime but this be an incentive they hadn't offer before but yeah and basically we all get like if we do a certain amount of hours we get a bonus thing but
S0255	we can if you want you could get last year have you get last year's one at all
S0260	i'll get it out tonight
S0255	get it out and i'll have a look and if necessary what's the reason why then once you know it'll be fine yeah get your old one out and then let me have a look tomorrow
S0260	change
S0255	mm mm
S0260	might be why
S0255	mm
S0260	don't see why i should goodbye
S0255	night
S0316	goodnight
S0256	but i think i do we do a hundred and eleven hours a lot of us and in two in like what be it a month or two months a month i think for about a month we do a hundred and eleven hours
S0255	mm
S0256	of overtime on top of our normal hours and we be all knackered so then when i finish a lot of us go i i'd do mine for the like the rest of the millennium it feel like
S0316	yeah
S0316	it's a tough payoff isn't it when you're like oh more money
S0255	mm
S0316	but exhaust
S0256	well there be there be two incentives you could either do two weeks' worth and get a certain amount or you do three weeks' worth of your contract sales and get a bite more and by the time you'd do the two weeks you're like oh i feel great i feel great i can do one more week's worth of contract hours that be the hardest one everyone do
S0255	mm
S0256	because we all all decide to carry on and then it be like
S0316	yeah
S0256	oh my god i don't wanna do this but when you have a a calculator so you know how many hours you'd leave and you be like
S0255	yeah
S0256	i can't say no like

S0255	mm
S0256	but it's a lot when you're do seven hours a day anyway
S0255	mm
S0256	i mean some of us be stay till like nine o'clock at night ten o'clock at night
S0255	mm
S0256	do overtime
S0316	mm
S0256	that's that's why they say we're open however many hours a day be because everyone be like stay late and we be already open till ten o'clock anyway
