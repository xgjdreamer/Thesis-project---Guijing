S0104	sort of when i'm talk i'm i'm a bite unaware of it but if there's a lull in the conversation i start think i've get to say something
S0104	i've get to say something otherwise the tape recording's go to be all empty and then i start erm
S0167	well what they should do on the news instead of always moan about the negative they should there's always a story if you look on the positive side so ah the population's drop off this could mean this and this
S0104	yeah
S0167	and all these positives instead of go oh the school aren't fill up there aren't enough kid this mean there's gonna be too many old people and not enough young people
S0379	yeah but that and there be
S0104	but positivity doesn't make good news do it it's like
S0167	i suppose it just drive me mad no wonder everyone's depress
S0110	uhu
S0104	mm
S0110	it's true yeah
S0379	the trouble be
S0104	i agree
S0379	what you it's the that's the the sociology of human behaviour isn't it
S0104	mm
S0379	like you be say about the coca cola bottle

S0104	yeah yeah it's just company capitalise on the mood of the day don't they
S0379	but then it's obviously be study sociology
S0104	mm yeah
S0379	because i remember like erm

S0167	why be
S0104	but
S0167	his insulin relevant to him cut his hand
S0104	well his
S0379	why do you think
S0167	i don't know
S0110	yeah why be it i've no idea
S0379	because your circulation
S0104	yes
S0379	with your diabetic retinopathy and you haven't get so good sensation
S0104	she never speak in english
S0167	i can't understand what you're talk about
S0104	you know what you be the worst teacher ever
S0104	you assume that your pupils know as much as you
S0379	you don't know what diabetic retinopathy be
S0104	i'm not talk about me i'm talk about
S0167	i don't
S0104	you're tell
S0379	the feel
S0379	the feel
S0167	okay
S0379	it's
S0167	so like your numbness
S0379	like when people be diabetic their circulation isn't as good as yours or our or ours
S0104	yeah that's why they're erm
S0379	they have to be very careful
S0104	it's not uncommon for diabetics to have to have well no it be quite uncommon but it's erm
S0167	more common than non er diabetics
S0104	you're more susceptible to things like you know have to have your leg amputate
S0379	tat
S0104	i think if you get an ulcer or that's why i always say to dad he should wear should wear slippers cos if he be to tread on something and really injure his foot his blood circulation and his foot might not heal
S0379	and it take longer to heal
S0167	oh right okay
S0379	because you're not get the supply of blood
S0104	yeah no i wasn't talk about me i be talk about
S0379	oh
S0104	you be explain it to who have no idea what you be talk about
S0167	the diabetic rescinopathy
S0110	the
S0167	she say this morning she be go oh she she's an auxiliary she say she be talk about someone she go oh she's an auxiliary i say what's an auxiliary

S0167	auxiliary i think mean on the side of like an add thing
S0104	that's a bite well they're just like an add
S0167	like an auxiliary verb i know i only know this from when i do english language an auxiliary verb be a verb that kind of be add on an extra one that's er so i'm assume
S0104	oh that's a bite of an insult
S0167	that's what auxiliary mean
S0104	isn't it you're a bite of an extra add on thing
S0379	like a growth
S0104	yes
S0167	maybe that's why they're not call auxiliaries anymore
