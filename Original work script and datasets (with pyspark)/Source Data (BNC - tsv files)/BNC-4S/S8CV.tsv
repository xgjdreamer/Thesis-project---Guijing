S0687	yeah
S0688	it's like that i be gonna say it's not be use or anything
S0687	mm
S0689	i be read in the bulletin in the news apparently some bloke be fly his helicopter and then a seagull crash through the foot of his erm you know windscreen
S0688	yeah
S0689	and erm apparently like it say it die on impact but he say that he have it say that like the bloke have to put his foot over it to stop like flap about and make him
S0688	well what dead
S0687	the
S0689	the seagull
S0688	yeah
S0689	and he and it say like he he stick his foot on its head basically to stop it fly around but so it say the die the bird die on impact but if it if he stick his er you know his foot on it then it doesn't really make sense do it
S0688	no
S0687	where be that
S0689	in
S0687	didn't know there be many
S0689	well it might it might have be in the even news
S0687	didn't know there be many people with helicopters around
S0689	it might have be in the even news i can't remember i read both of them
S0688	that could be dangerous a er if it get stick in your in your propeller
S0689	no i don't think it would make a big difference
S0687	do you know it would
S0687	that's why they have airports like when they be first do when they first kind of start to fly they have load of problems with bird get suck into propellers and it cause the the propeller to explode and it crash
S0689	really no but
S0687	yeah that's why at airports they have cars that drive around with like loud whizzers on them to drive away bird
S0689	oh right
S0687	the runways
S0689	see i think yeah but if a propeller it it go so fast it'd just chop it up do you not think
S0687	well you would think so but it it i'm right aren't i dad there's be case where the
S0690	there have be case yeah
S0687	the bird have get into propellers and the plane's crash
S0690	but they can actually destroy jet engines believe it or not cos there's hundreds of fan in the middle er on the inside of a jet propulsion engine spin around incredibly fast
S0689	it must be a lot of force to get a like thousand be it or normally tonnes it's probably a couple of plus all the
S0690	yeah
S0689	baggage and all the people
S0688	be that the railway line there
S0687	i'm not sure

S0687	i'd far better know what a kilogram be than an ounce what's that with all those cars park up

S0688	think that's where the police be before
S0689	yeah
S0687	it be yeah

S0689	oh okay
S0690	how many days be it till the eu vote
S0687	thursday
S0690	oh right
S0689	so you know your postal vote
S0687	yeah
S0689	will they be they like count now or be they count like along with
S0688	i think they count them now
S0689	so realistically you can have an inclination of what the populace be
S0688	mm
S0687	no well not really cos it's a very small number of people do postal vote
S0689	i can't really remember how it all start to be honest with you it's a bite like
S0687	what do you mean
S0689	like the whole eu referendum thing i i just remember it be here do you know what i mean
S0687	it be it be the tory's campaign
S0688	it's the
S0687	it be the tory's whole election campaign
S0689	see i can't even remember what that they be gonna go out
S0687	no that they would offer a vote
S0689	i can't remember
S0687	essentially they say they think we that we should go out except now they've backtrack and say we should stay in cos we've get this amaze deal that david cameron's negotiate
S0689	well think about it you vote to stay in so that's a bite kind of like
S0687	i'm like be sarcastic
S0689	i know i get that
S0687	so i'm say it's hypocritical because they they be say we'll offer a vote and give people a chance to say that no that we're that we didn't have a good deal and then
S0689	yeah i get that but then
S0687	he's he's he didn't negotiate very much at all
S0689	i don't even know
S0687	do he dad
S0690	erm
S0687	i don't actually know the exact
S0688	the only thing i've hear be people come here can't claim benefit for four years till they've work here for four years
S0689	which be fair enough to be fair
S0687	all i hear that be that that there would be no pressure for us to join the euro or anything like that but what do you mean dad
S0690	i can't remember it wasn't too much to be honest with you
S0687	nothing interest
S0690	no
S0689	i watch a really interest thing it be like a you know like a bbc not well not a documentary but you know they do those like piece where they like go and talk to the public and have a little walk and talk to the camera and erm and they be say that like nobody really know anything about the eu but if you mention immigration everybody's like get an opinion and it be really really interest like they talk to all these different people like all age and all genders and like everybody's like oh i don't really know like i don't know what it's all
S0688	see that's that's the that's the entire point
S0687	that's the concern they're concern about immigration and
S0690	ignore the politics and ignore the fact that it's good for the economy be in the in the eu and just concentrate on a single
S0687	the
S0690	stupid
S0687	yeah people be look at it from one
S0690	issue
S0687	perspective
S0689	yeah grant but it's not really good for the economy be it dad because how much do we pay into the eu weekly it's like lot and lot of money that could be use elsewhere
S0690	well
S0689	hospitals
S0690	we shall we'll if we vote out we'll spend the next ten years renegotiate trade deal and lose trade leave right and centre and the economy will go downhill
S0688	no you've get you've no evidence for that
S0690	well i have
S0688	just
S0687	have
S0688	honestly you're just you've just
S0690	okay why
S0688	listen to the rhetoric
S0690	well i know that we'll
S0689	if right
S0690	have to renegotiate all the trade deal so that be fact
S0687	well not all our trade deal be trade deal with europe
S0690	no
S0689	but people
S0690	our trade deal with the rest of the world as well
S0689	yeah people
S0690	cos all the trade deal with the rest of the world be base on our on our trade deal with europe we have to go and renegotiate every trade deal throughout the world which will take years of negotiate and cause enormous upheaval in in business when they should be focus on sell instead of deal with that
S0688	well yeah but that can't be true because otherwise we wouldn't export a thing for ten years
S0690	well
S0688	if what you're say be true
S0690	it's i'm not say you can't export a thing for ten years but i'm tell you it it'll it'll add
S0688	well how can we export if we haven't get a trade deal
S0689	dad you're snort but
S0690	there'll be
S0689	that's mum's opinion
S0690	interim because there'll be
S0689	like
S0690	interim interim measure but it'll take years of
S0688	i don't think the fact that it would take
S0690	people's waste
S0688	i don't think the fact that it would take ten years to sort out mean that it shouldn't be do i don't think that's a good enough reason
S0690	well
S0688	because you could say
S0690	in the
S0688	no we're not gonna go to war because it would be five years of blood and you know people die but you know you know you can't
S0690	well in those ten years
S0688	you can't that's not a good enough reason be it
S0690	our competitors in europe will have an unfair advantage against us and will trade win trade against us and we'll lose out massively and all anyone's interest in be a few pole because that's all they think about
S0688	well it's a bite more than that really
S0689	i no i i i think that immigration have to be sort like i don't believe that people should be able like under the eu free travel and it you everybody can come in and i say everybody that's a that's a general statement but people can come in and you know they know how to work the system then that's not fair at all like it's it's depress to think that
S0690	okay well
S0689	when i start work i'll have to pay thirty percent of my wage but people other people can come in and use my money to have five children and then live off that money that's not fair
S0690	okay but have the syrians and the calais border be absolutely nothing to do with the eu referendum
S0689	no i'm not say that
S0689	i i didn't mention that
S0688	hasn't mention
S0689	i didn't mention calais at all
S0687	and syria's not even in the eu be it so that's get nothing to do with it
S0690	okay well the the the immigrants the so call immigrants that be swamp the country bollocks that people talk about be we'll have no significant difference whether we're in or out of europe the issue be still there
S0689	dad you you're go off you're go off you're go off now dad
S0690	well
S0689	first you be talk about syrians in calais which nobody mention
S0690	okay but the issue of immigration will not change dramatically whether we're in or out of europe
S0689	it well it will because of free travel
S0687	well i think it would because if we be out of europe we wouldn't have to we wouldn't have to adhere to the to the rule of let people from within the eu in it would still be our decision what we do about syria and place like that that aren't in the eu
S0689	absolutely i'm i'm not don't get me wrong i'm fine with take skilled people on like happily i'd i'd take you know if you've get a diploma in engineer and we've get a shortage of engineer come on in
S0689	an engineer engineer sorry come on in but i'm not i'm not happy when bob who's come from romania with
S0687	i don't think dad
S0689	no high school degree and a you know it's
S0690	well
S0689	not fair
S0690	up from romania without a high school degree be work in the field that no english will do the job
S0688	they're not
S0687	it's not true dad
S0688	look down road it's full of hungarians who be
S0687	not work
S0688	not work
S0687	i i i don't think i and you know i would feel the same if i move to poland i would not expect to receive anything from the state until i have contribute and i don't think people should expect the same wherever they go i think people should have to pay into the system
S0689	yeah
S0687	for so many years before they can take out of it and i don't think that's racist at all i think that's just
S0689	no it's not
S0687	common sense isn't it
S0689	it's just fair yeah
S0687	it's fair and if i go to poland i wouldn't be able to access the same benefit as if i be a pole and i come here and you know it's suppose to be a free market and an equal market but that it isn't cos people can get more in certain countries
S0688	pregnant women go back to poland because they do a scan every month they fly back when they're pregnant and have a scan every month as well as the scan here
S0689	with with with i mean the systems we have in place the nhs be nearly at break point the education system be
S0687	well it
S0689	in a bad state
S0687	it's in a bad state cos there's primary school where look at 's primary school something like sixty percent of the class english isn't their first language so although that poor forty percent who have to put up with the teacher try to communicate with children who don't speak the language well
S0688	well there's a group be set up hasn't there next to children's centre where they're suppose to go and learn the basics before they go to school
S0687	but still even if a child who know the basics that teacher's gonna have to spend more time with those children you know get them to understand and teach them and then the other children be
S0689	miss out
S0687	be leave by the wayside but like even if i i i think anybody who hasn't contribute regardless of whether they come from abroad or not in fact you know i don't think should be able to turn eighteen and go on jobseeker's i don't think that's fair because he's never pay in
S0689	i didn't even know i could get jobseeker's when i be eighteen
S0687	of course you can
S0688	but his parent have
S0687	yeah his parent have but regardless he hasn't i don't think people should turn eighteen
S0688	well
S0687	and that be an option to them cos if it wasn't an option
S0689	they'd have to work
S0687	people would go and get a job i've not work now you know i could be on jobseeker's
S0689	we need a huge huge overhaul but nobody's get the
S0688	i think the the real issue be address how politicians in europe abuse the finance there
S0687	well that's a whole different area that
S0689	yeah
S0688	well yeah but how much money have they save
S0689	yeah but if we get out what's the what's that you know leave them to it
S0687	i'd be happier vote in if we if we'd you know if we'd manage to get a better deal where we have more autonomy over
S0688	what do you vote then
S0687	i vote in but i'm say i would be more i be say i be a bite on the fence wasn't i i'd be more happy about it if if we would have more control over what we do as a country
S0689	i know that's that's one of the big stick point for me i don't like the idea of somebody who's who doesn't live who doesn't live in the country who doesn't really have an idea of what the country's all about decide our rule that's just not fair
S0688	that's not even touch on all the displace refugees
S0687	what do you mean
S0688	well you know they'll er they've take on like refugees
S0687	from syria
S0688	yeah
S0687	yeah
S0689	i know i know it sound awful but if we're take in like if we take if we if we open our arm for refugees the the nhs be gonna be but er more er like at greater risk than it already be the education system be gonna be put at greater risk than it already be
S0687	but like if you're gonna be in the eu it you know in some sense it's not fair that germany should take millions and us take none surely it should be split pro rata between all the eu countries depend on their population and then germany wouldn't have so many you know countries like croatia and england who've totally ignore it would have their fair share and it wouldn't be such a pressure on certain countries who be take more in because that's be their decision
S0689	that's true yeah
S0688	and if you reattribute some of the money that's be waste in europe you'd have money to put back into a systems that would suppose those people when they come
S0689	yeah but it boil down to this thing whether somebody's come in to abuse the system or
S0688	they take forever and a day don't they to decide
S0687	to decide
S0688	anything
S0687	people have be in the country for ten years on asylum as asylum seekers because they've not make the decision yet
S0689	sorry who's not make the decision
S0687	the government
S0689	right
S0687	the system
S0689	yeah
S0687	meanwhile that person can't work because they're an asylum seeker they have no right to work so we're pay for them to be there for ten years whilst we make the decision whether they can stay or not
S0689	yeah
