S0542	we'll just go to checkpoint which be good to be have a wraith

S0542	shotguns be useless on
S0560	yeah
S0560	i know
S0542	oh i die i think the wraith's fine though which be a little bite worry
S0560	oh a hologram too
S0542	we might need to go back and get the wraith
S0560	just stock up on things that i'm try to lose the first time i die
S0542	oh there's some ghost over there as well which be a little bite
S0560	no
S0542	oh wow there's a party down there and we're not invite

S0560	yeah
S0542	oh pooey
S0560	that that suck a hologram there
S0542	probably try and how do i stealth get in a wraith
S0542	oh i can't go that way the ghost be mess me up too much
S0560	oh god i think i've already get snipers on me

S0560	just er
S0542	er grenades be happy time
S0560	yeah yeah we've get a lot of grenades here don't we
S0542	i die again
S0560	oh i almost do and oh
S0542	if you die in quick succession when we start a checkpoint it'll put us back to the other one
S0560	oh er
S0542	do you not know that
S0560	no
S0542	oh you don't do much on legendary though do you

S0560	but yeah jun have team kill me a lot in the past
S0542	i know right i'm gonna run round this way
S0560	send a hologram out there to distract
S0542	yes they won't expect
S0560	oh
S0542	two of me i just
S0560	yeah
S0542	fell off the map
S0560	problem be they sometimes shoot through the hologram at me
S0542	i fell off the map though
S0560	oh
S0560	i'm just gonna throw random grenades out yeah i think you only spawn with one
S0542	i'm gonna get the brute shoot just cos it it do wonder to their shield
S0560	yeah
S0542	do a brute shoot do increase melee damage cos it have the blade on the front
S0560	er
S0542	it doesn't do it
S0560	i don't think so there isn't a brute shoot in this anyway it's a concussion gun
S0542	not that i no no no there's the erm
S0560	oh the spiker
S0542	the spiker that's what i mean
S0560	oh right yeah
S0542	yeah sorry my bad i just spawn immediately at
S0542	oh grenade launchers that'll do
S0560	oh what i take his shield down i think
S0542	it's so strange without sound
S0560	yeah it's horrible it's like underwater
S0542	i die it's it be like play underwater what we could do be go into the settings and reduce the movement speed and then it really would've be
S0560	yeah that'd be quite quite amuse if you could do like a campaign just set your movement speed like
S0542	er that'd be quite an interest like game type thing you know for custom game if you could erm
S0560	yeah
S0542	reduce like the players' like sound so they have to play with like
S0560	oh yeah
S0542	no sound and then you could do like a hide and seek type thing couldn't you
S0560	yeah it'd be kinda cool actually
S0542	i think that'd be kind of cool
S0560	i be get that grenade launcher i love grenade launchers
S0542	i'm gonna try and get the wraith if it's still down here i'm be shoot at cos i can see the bullets i can't hear the bullets
S0560	i use to be like a deadeye with a er grenade launcher

S0542	we're try to like keep talk through all of this so
S0543	i wouldn't worry too much
S0560	well i think the idea be you just do what you normally do
S0543	yeah yeah if you think about it too much it'll probably be awkward
S0560	i'm dead again i think you might've kill me
S0542	i be really close to you
S0542	yeah that time that cowbell yeah time three accelerations
S0560	worth it

S0560	in the background in this record
S0542	yeah i er dunno how sensitive the mic be but you probably will i'm get a strange sense of déjà vu now
S0542	from the er
S0560	do this mission so many time
S0542	yeah i've forget you should wait in the tunnel before the er the phantom disappear er before the phantom disappear until the phantom disappear cos otherwise you die the way i do when you do this jump

S0560	get someone
S0542	i wanna catch it
S0542	what why's this funny
S0560	just it's seem a bite and again
S0560	and again
S0542	i wanna catch it no
S0542	you'd think they could put like an explosive like charge in like the armour so in the event of a spartan's death it would like explode
S0560	that'd be an amaze armour ability i feel like if that have happen in armour that wouldn't've end well all of them would've be dead
S0542	oh yeah
S0542	or no but like there's a delay or something or
S0560	mm
S0542	like a remote thing for like your squad mate

S0542	apparently i super combine as a jackal you saw it happen so
S0560	yeah i know yeah
S0542	where the heck do he go
S0560	i think bounce off their shield
S0542	maybe it's the angle
S0560	mm maybe
S0542	i literally have nothing
S0560	one pistol magazine mm
S0542	holy
S0542	better get a needler
S0560	there be one on the floor

S0544	no majora's mask be the creepy one
S0543	oh yeah be the be all of the zeldas to do with time and stuff and like
S0542	no
S0543	so how come both of those be like to do with time
S0543	majora's mask be to do with time isn't it
S0544	that's cos it's a sequel to ocarina
S0543	oh fair
S0544	actually there's a massive there's a really really complicate timeline to do with zelda
S0543	really
S0544	the zelda timeline couple of years ago and it be just like woah
S0544	i'll show you the video that i get at school
S0543	mm
S0544	and the latest game be the first game in the chronology
S0544	skyward sword be the first
S0543	oh really
S0544	mm end of the timeline and apparently they've have this timeline lie about since like for for about thirty years
S0543	thirty years really
S0544	thirty years imagine that have a timeline lay out for thirty years
S0542	actually try and get the super combine
S0560	he seem to be roll all over the place
S0542	i be just empty round into this guy and he oh there we go get him
S0560	yeah er i only have an assault rifle leave now shall i
S0542	okay you might wanna charge in
S0560	shall i charge
S0542	yeah
S0560	oh there's a dmr here take that
S0542	i dunno if i get the elite there no i didn't
S0560	er no i'll still shoot that there we go
S0542	oh do you get the kill
S0560	i be gonna say
S0542	there's little skirmishers i'm not in get oh there's a ranger fly around oh man i be completely out of ammo i'm dead
S0560	oh no i be just about to kill that ranger then i run out of ammo
S0542	oh
S0542	hey i'm back oh i have ammo for some reason i just shoot emile in the back of the head
S0542	get let me get the ranger
S0543	how come you guy have get friendly fire on can you not turn it off
S0560	that's just a thing of halo
S0542	it's just yeah it's always yeah
S0543	oh be it
S0560	it's hilarious it's
S0560	probably not very good
S0542	i'm dead oh you're dead
S0544	well no friendly fire should be a thing
S0560	yeah
S0544	like cos in real life if you shoot someone in the back of the head
S0544	block them cos they're friendly
S0544	mate i didn't mean it to be fair
S0542	i take it back
S0560	who be you shoot at
S0542	er we'll probably need to go for the elite he's armour lock right now
S0560	jump up fire a couple of shots and then
S0543	to be honest if i play a game where friendly fire be on like i would probably be really bad
S0544	that'd be amaze cos
S0542	it's not like we're put in a situation where we're only gonna hit one another
S0543	no i know but i'm just that
S0542	like look we're literally look
S0542	at like he's on the grind there i can see it say above his name
S0560	yeah like
S0542	hit him's gonna be quite a challenge
S0560	most of the time be either explosives or on purpose so
S0542	yeah you either accidently throw a grenade and they run in or er
S0542	i'm just have a look for weapons in here cos
S0560	er there's a new rifle here by the way if you wanna
S0542	er there's dmrs in here
S0560	i i i i can't pick it up
S0542	there's dmrs in here mate
S0560	oh cool
S0542	there's load of dead marines as well
S0560	i'm dead oh man
S0542	enemy nearby oh
S0560	yeah there be lot of enemies nearby
S0542	get up the stairs
S0543	you're just walk against the stairs
S0542	i know
S0560	right it's back oh i have a dmr now as well cool
S0542	yeah you might have armour lock as well
S0543	what's dmr
S0542	designate marksman's rifle
S0543	oh cool
S0560	it's the gun in halo that actually hit the thing that you point at
S0542	yeah
S0544	do you prefer the dmr to the battle rifle or be you you're not
S0560	it's way better
S0542	alright cool
S0543	i like i like the pesto
S0544	mm
S0543	yeah
S0544	mm
S0542	i like you
S0560	against the battle rifle's obviously better but
S0542	oh yeah yeah
S0560	dmr's more satisfy
S0542	yeah i'd rather have a
S0560	cos er battle rifle you can just spray it
S0542	yeah cos i the battle rifle they're essentially be single fire so the battle rifle just happen to put three round down for every one or the there's an elite here he's dead
S0560	okay
S0560	oh there's another one
S0542	oh right well do
S0560	against the background
