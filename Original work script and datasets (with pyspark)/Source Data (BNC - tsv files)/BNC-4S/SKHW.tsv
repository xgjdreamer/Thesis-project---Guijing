S0328	i love the idea of you guy become like the bad boys now
S0331	yeah
S0330	sorry you wanna cancel a table
S0330	sorry you be mean to be here fifteen minutes ago
S0328	be you kid me i know where you live man
S0328	i'm trace this call
S0330	yeah
S0330	yeah not many people get to do that most people just
S0328	do you think that's like representative of like how common it be just in general
S0330	yeah
S0328	that's just a normal part of restaurants
S0330	i think people be just like most restaurants experience it much more than we do
S0328	mm
S0330	like i think we we experience it fairly infrequently because a lot like such a big part of our customer base be like regulars who who who you know know us or know our face or feel like they know us
S0328	mm
S0330	so you wouldn't do that whereas lot of restaurants that be big and well know will like have lot of people who couldn't give a shit who the owner be or whatever
S0328	why do people do that
S0330	cos they're dicks i don't know
S0331	but the other thing like erm i think if you work in a bigger place it doesn't matter if you lose customers
S0330	as much yeah
S0331	yeah
S0330	yeah yeah yeah you're right
S0331	so
S0328	do people just get drink or something
S0331	that's why people would be ruder at like say somewhere that's book out all the time they don't care what you think
S0330	yeah but like
S0331	and what you think someone else
S0328	oh you mean the staff
S0331	someone else'll just come along yeah
S0328	yeah
S0330	but for example at it's it's a really big problem if people don't turn up to their book because it doesn't have any pass trade all the trade be
S0328	mm
S0330	it's like it's a destination so you have to be go there in order to be there so if you be fully book on a friday night and then you know a table of six and a table of four and three table of two don't turn up that's like a quarter of the restaurant
S0326	mm
S0330	and it's not gonna be fill by anyone else who's walk past so for them like no show be a really really big deal whereas like maybe in or
S0328	mm
S0330	you know somewhere like that it wouldn't be so much of a problem because
S0328	have a
S0330	pass trade to to
S0326	cos that's what you be say about when we go to all these place to eat in like no one's go there more than once cos they're just pass through so
S0331	yeah exactly
S0330	yeah
S0331	see that's the best i would love to like have a restaurant
S0330	what so you can just serve shit
S0331	a a tourist restaurant
S0328	like insane like shit so bad
S0326	with er plastic chair
S0331	what tripadvisor what's that
S0331	it's like yeah you're the best customer but also you get that surely if you're obviously you have people come back that but you have load of italians and stuff and french people
S0328	tourists you mean
S0331	yeah tourists just
S0328	a fuck
S0331	yeah exactly but like

S0326	it's that's actually the best costcutter ever that one
S0331	it be actually it's funny they exist everywhere and they're slightly different

S0331	they're a franchise yeah i know
S0326	er i think you like just lease you like lease out the name
S0331	but but more so than more so than other franchise cos most franchise stay relatively consistent

S0331	whereas
S0330	that's the beauty of

S0330	on rent that's load
S0331	yeah we pay like fifteen a year we can trade seven days a week

S0328	no
S0331	from the
S0328	no not take the

S0326	er look look look at the coasters from that pub
S0331	yeah but like no one's ever in that pub like
S0326	look at the look at the coasters
S0331	strength
S0331	it's definitely strength that
S0326	that's what i use to drink as a child
S0331	yeah i have
S0328	what do you what do you mean use to
S0326	i i i remember
S0331	k's k be pretty good
S0326	there be a whole summer when i be like thirteen or fourteen when i just like didn't have any money but i have enough money for two can of k cider
S0331	shit so it's too expensive it suck suck but like high rent in that place it's not a busy pub
S0330	which one's the the one that where you be gonna be er
S0328	landlady it's erm it's the gay pub it's near er
S0331	you know where it be
S0326	yeah when i be there
S0331	it's the one on the way to just across the road from the alleyway
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0328	mm
S0330	i be get confuse with the one on the road that one
S0328	yeah that's the right
S0328	yeah they're alright
S0331	fifty grand a year
S0328	pretty sure but i think that's it it's quite a small pub
S0331	yeah
S0328	for that
S0330	i guess if it's that much money then that size'd be tricky
S0328	mm
S0326	it's too small to do food though right
S0328	it have an upstairs and i dunno what no that would've be fun though
S0326	we fold it up
S0328	mm it's only one month until finish school again and then we go to paris
S0331	you might miss our erm close down party
S0328	when's that
S0331	probably on the fourteenth
S0328	yeah we'll be away oh well you'll be party from then on right
S0330	that's right
S0328	plenty of time for that
S0331	exactly that's right that's er that's the reaction i expect
S0328	come to paris
S0330	yeah
S0328	it's not a one time thing
S0331	oh can you just make it the week after
S0328	then come to paris
S0331	i hope it's then we're gonna we're announce it tomorrow
S0330	wait be we gonna keep this flat then what's the plan keep it stay here
S0331	don't wanna move i like it
S0330	shall we try and get a longer contract
S0331	let's get a roll on
S0330	try and get a roll on
S0331	roll ons be the best because they would never kick you out because they just want you to stay
S0330	yeah
S0331	but then if we decide we wanna move to boston
S0331	then we could give them the month's notice cool
S0330	boston
S0331	yeah
S0328	should go and check it out
S0330	yeah let's go and check it out let's go to the state come on everyone
S0331	right now you're push for it
S0330	yeah
S0331	you're usually the one that's not
S0328	i wanna erm buy a place in erm greece this year too i really do
S0331	yeah that one look good i think we should ask them for some photos of it obviously it's a renovation thing
S0328	i mean no it's not even a that one look good i i barely look at it it be just the price and the location but it's like
S0331	yeah but i mean that's er
S0328	sense of what's out there
S0331	renovation thing though
S0330	wait what so what's the deal you've get you've get
S0328	yeah yeah yeah
S0330	some money to buy a place
S0328	but i kind of just wanna buy somewhere outright you know
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0328	i don't really understand how to do anything else with money i don't i've never have a credit card or like borrow money really
S0331	yeah yeah
S0328	small small amount
S0331	cos if you wanna buy something in you have to tie yourself to something for fuck age
S0328	from like the bank for like my thing
S0330	well i i i don't think it's that complicate it's just that it'll it'll just be er it'll just be a commitment
S0331	well the benefit of buy something
S0330	that you would have to make
S0331	yeah
S0330	for a over a certain amount of time
S0331	and if if you buy
S0328	well i i mean i don't reckon i don't reckon like i i hope that within that price range could buy something that wouldn't be like a massive commitment of work
S0330	yeah
S0331	oh no oversea like in greece
S0328	yeah yeah yeah
S0331	that would be fine like you'd be fine especially if you leave yourself a bite extra like you wouldn't wanna spend it all because then you'd need to fix it which you should probably be able to do for like it depend how shit it be but like
S0328	mm
S0331	ten grand twenty grand or something like
S0328	yeah
S0331	cos that one will be completely shit like you have to redo the whole thing
S0328	mm
S0331	fuck the like the the property itself be awesome like
S0328	i didn't even really look at it i be just look at the price and like
S0331	but there's no picture of the place they just say renovation project which mean it'll be run down and it's just fuck
S0331	yeah
S0328	but i mean erm i look through even just like the very very like first page of what's available in erm in greece and everything be insanely cheap and then like just to compare like look at several other countries and like
S0331	yeah
S0331	oh yeah it's
S0328	so i'm sure like with a bite of time and research we'll find something good
S0330	yeah
S0328	right
S0331	yeah exactly yeah the only advantage of er find something in be that like it'll be worth way more next year
S0328	i don't know if i could anyway i haven't get that much and like i don't think i'm very like
S0331	no i mean you
S0328	mortgageable cos
S0331	yeah you need to have shit on paper
S0330	yeah yeah
S0328	it's like my i dunno i mean erm what i earn isn't actually that much my business isn't worth that much
S0331	yeah yeah
S0328	i don't think er it would be like a tricky thing i think
S0330	yeah i think i think you might be right
S0331	it'd be a nightmare as well you have to pay back so much money
S0330	in term of mortgage and shit yeah it'll be more fun
S0328	it'd be more fun it'd be somewhere i'd wanna go for the rest of my life i don't i don't i don't think there's anything like i don't imagine there's anything wrong with like rent for like you know the next sort of chapter in my life be like i plan on move around a lot and er i don't this feel like a weird concept to me to buy something in
S0331	yeah
S0330	yeah
S0328	but then if i have like somewhere which be like er me and my friends and family would like to go to for the rest of our live it's like remain like a you know a nice home somewhere when you can get to it it's like make a lot more sense to me
S0331	yeah me too
S0328	plus something i can actually afford i dunno
S0331	yeah
S0328	i don't really understand like mortgage
S0328	borrow money be in debt
S0331	yeah
S0328	i've never really do it
S0330	yeah and er
S0328	although it's totally normal
S0330	and a mortgage be like a it's a massive commitment that you it's not like you can't just like you can't decide to stop pay the mortgage repayments
S0331	yeah
S0326	unless you sell the house
S0330	yeah
S0331	yeah
S0330	but it's like but if you if you can't afford to pay it then in the time it take for you to not be able to repay it to sell it like you could have it repossess like it's like
S0331	no the main point be it's like it's like five hundred pound a week or something or like shitloads a week
S0328	most people do it all the time i'm sure it's doable but
S0331	probably
S0330	in term of like no it's it it'd be cheaper than pay rent that's why everybody want to buy
S0331	yeah
S0330	it's just that you have to have all these credentials to get a mortgage and it tie you in er for the for that time so if you
S0328	just do it and er he'll probably own it when he's like eighty or something
S0330	yeah yeah it's yeah i mean it's
S0328	if that
S0330	it's like if like when be you actually gonna have have er like you know half a million pound i mean it's fuck ridiculous
S0328	next year
S0330	you just pay the interest off or whatever
S0328	mm
S0330	i dunno but it's like it's a real tie in thing there's no opt out
S0328	mm i can't be bother
S0330	no it sound like
S0331	yeah there's way more fun to be have place in greece
S0328	it's true though
S0328	don't make sense to me i think that's one of them
S0331	buy a boat as well if you buy the house i'll try and buy a boat
S0331	like
S0328	then we can row there
S0326	do you do you see the thing about the boatman
S0328	oh yeah i dunno oh you know my friend the boatman i've tell you about him like he live on a boat and like country music like old guy
S0331	oh yeah yeah you have yeah
S0330	yeah
S0328	old like rockabilly anyway i go to see him recently and like he's like yeah when i start live on a boat i be the only one on a boat but everyone's get a boat now it's like everybody the boatmen it's like i'm gonna get a flat and be the flat man
S0330	that's awesome
S0328	everybody the boatman
S0330	yeah a place in greece would be really cool
S0328	i think so
S0330	like i think like most people don't want to take risk in other countries as much because
S0326	like greece
S0331	yeah like greece
S0328	why
S0330	well because cos
S0331	greece be like the the damn economy
S0328	but it's not about an investment
S0326	yeah exactly
S0331	no of course i know that that's why people won't wanna do it
S0330	for everybody it's all about an investment cos you could lose all your money and nobody want to lose all their money
S0328	but how would you lose it if you still own a house
S0331	no you don't you don't but you'd lose like if you just want to buy a house and it be yours and your family's you wouldn't
S0328	yeah that's what i want
S0331	erm if you be rent it out you'd lose it you know
S0328	mm
S0331	no but people see it as in like
S0331	er you could take your forty grand like get a mortgage buy a house in
S0328	mm
S0331	earn x amount over the next year cos the property in will go up a hundred grand
S0326	yeah
S0331	sell it and you've make that money so you're make money on
S0330	but yeah mm
S0328	yeah
S0326	there's that thing in the i saw erm on in some paper about this like student build society which you can basically if your parent guarantee you it let give you a mortgage instead of get student accommodation you buy a house
S0330	fuck hell
S0326	in like wherever and then you
S0331	christ in yeah
S0326	or like in if you're in uni in like or whatever
S0331	yeah
S0326	you can buy a house in and then you rent it out to other students
S0331	yeah
S0326	and then that's what you pay the mortgage with
S0331	yeah
S0326	then once you've be there for three years cos the property's like you've already make twenty grand
S0331	yeah
S0326	you sell it and then you've get twenty grand
S0330	woah
S0331	yeah no matter what in in especially or anyone like you make money if you predict a property
S0330	but you don't necessarily that's just our perception right now because we're think of it short term
S0331	yeah
S0330	but the house market hasn't always be like that it's be up and down
S0331	yeah but it's always gonna be
S0326	it's up it's up but
S0330	like we've only see it go up but it's not always up
S0326	the reason why it's
S0331	it's mainly always up
S0330	it's not
S0326	it's not really gonna go down i think in especially in because people buy rich people in other countries buy house in cos it's a better investment than have it in a bank
S0330	yeah but that's only be recently
S0331	yeah
S0330	like that's not that's not
S0330	like that it hasn't always be like that in
S0328	no that's true
S0330	you know like er i think
S0328	but it's a safer bet like at least for the
S0331	mm
S0328	short term
S0330	yeah it be a safer bet for the short term
S0328	but also it's not it's not as simple as that it's not like take forty grand er like with my altogether my situation it's not like i can turn that into
S0331	no you'd have to try hard to get a mortgage and
S0328	and then er you know oh man i don't know
S0330	but also i think like things can change mean where if you know if the you have to pay for upkeep of a build erm of a home or whatever and if suddenly cost go really high for like you know gas electricity and blah blah blah blah blah or rat or whatever like you know pay for er
S0328	basically
S0330	yeah no what i mean be that cost like there be so many variable cost which can change which be why people i think won't necessarily do that
S0331	the house you're rent it
S0330	yeah i mean that's why people invest in a country where they live so they understand what's go on rather than invest in another country because there be more like unknowable risk you don't you don't always know what's what's happen it's like
S0331	you mean in term of outside england
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0331	oh i see rather than
S0330	yeah
S0331	i wouldn't worry i think like
S0330	no i'm not say you should worry i'm just say these be the reason why probably people don't do it as often
S0331	really
S0328	i'm gonna do it let's do it this summer
S0330	yeah it'd be great
S0331	yeah exactly that's the thing
S0328	get some goats or something you know
S0328	make millions on goat's cheese
S0331	goats yeah
S0330	couple of chickens
S0328	sell it in costcutter
S0330	wait be you gonna get a donkey
S0328	yeah
S0328	who who's gonna train the goats who's who's gonna milk the goats
S0326	like i would drink milk straight out of the cow if they'd let me
S0326	dream i see what's go on
S0328	i be just say that i really like milk by the way
S0328	not that it's actually my dream to
S0328	he be like man you love it i be like yeah man i'd drink it straight out of the cow if they let me
S0328	not that i actually want to do that
S0328	in any kind of like fetish
S0331	creamy
S0326	it sound fuck weird man
S0328	you'd get sick right
S0326	no
S0331	no you don't
S0328	no don't you have to treat it
S0331	no that's er that er no that's just the idea of like unpasteurised milk in like england but if you be like erm in ireland or something or
S0331	jamaica or whatever
S0330	ireland or jamaica
S0331	yeah
S0330	how the fuck man

S0328	those be the two place i'd rather be
S0328	ireland or jamaica
S0326	ireland or jamaica
S0331	well i think that's where they drink milk
S0330	okay that's where they drink milk
S0326	you see it in like old timey movies they just like put it straight into like a flagon and then
S0331	yeah
S0330	yeah

S0331	the the gas knock you out
S0328	ah
S0330	but you be you be out for like
S0331	the thing that terrify me be they give this this all this information it's like you know cos you're awake like because you're asleep your heart be basically not work so it's like it's rely on they
S0328	be that what happen to you
S0331	they rely on something to keep your heart go
S0330	be that why you didn't send me a valentine's card
S0328	that's why you didn't send a valentine
S0331	isn't that terrify though the idea that like that through that it stop your heart work that fuck the idea that it's sort of rely on a a machine
S0330	so what do you rely on i don't get it
S0331	i think it rely on a machine
S0330	what they get like a machine to pump you or whatever
S0331	there's i i don't know what they do i didn't ask but they put me out they say er your basic function of like
S0330	yeah cos like
S0331	the heart work stop if they give you the general anaesthetic
S0330	er the general anaesthetic it slow the pulse doesn't it it slow your pulse so
S0331	yeah
S0330	at least
S0331	that's freaky
S0330	that's scary
S0331	it's just like
S0328	mm
S0331	you're basically dead while they do it they they kill you and do it
S0330	you're not dead
