S0271	mm
S0270	it be a
S0268	so i've see her play badminton but
S0266	anyway do erm have anything to do with the cinema now
S0268	well she she put in a shift on thursdays she do
S0266	but i think they didn't have one on tuesday night cos it be run as a business
S0268	oh i didn't ask her that but erm i think they still have some volunteer
S0271	get flashy leaflets now haven't they
S0266	they're
S0271	have you see them
S0268	yeah she give me one
S0266	but the night we go it be absolutely pack it be fully book before we
S0268	i think they must work there
S0271	we never go there cos i can't work out how you book a ticket
S0266	well you should ask he'll tell you
S0271	how do you book a ticket
S0268	well it's tricky
S0271	it's tricky
S0268	yeah it's tricky but what you do but well what what be always
S0271	isn't it paypal or something
S0268	oh paypal yes
S0271	i don't like that very much
S0268	yeah that's what you've get to do or but i think you can just pay with a credit card but a lot of people don't like do that cos you you know you give all the detail and you know who know what happen to those detail but erm but the problem then be that i think it's change but it use to be the case that fifty percent of the ticket be online
S0271	mm
S0268	and fifty percent be walk ins okay but in either case you can't reserve a seat
S0271	no well when we go we do clear up
S0268	but i think it's change now
S0271	and they just let the people who pay go to the front of the queue and go in first
S0266	that's why i hat it
S0268	yeah i
S0266	so if you've pay you have to get there early to get a seat
S0271	yeah you have to get there early
S0266	otherwise you sit right at the front but they be gonna change that i hear
S0268	i think they
S0266	they be gonna have bookable seat
S0268	i think they have change it and they've bring there's also popcorn available now apparently
S0266	mm mm
S0271	oh well definitely go then
S0268	yeah so it's the and apparently they make quite a lot of money from the popcorn and coffee
S0271	mm
S0268	i tell and erm cos that's 's husband
S0271	that you're an expert on it
S0266	on what
S0268	that you're an expert on well i about your coffee go to
S0266	i've just get an addiction to costa coffee no one no expertise just
S0268	they find that quite amuse i think that you go to your coffee there he actually produce quite a good cup of coffee i mean it's costa as well but it be in a er it's very interest how people pronounce the word cafetière
S0271	cafetière
S0268	because he say something that be just about sound like cafetière i could make out what it but he say something like cafettorie or something
S0268	a cafettorie i say oh right
S0271	luckily you didn't have to say the word again yourself
S0268	no
S0268	but he's from yorkshire so
S0268	well no yorkshire they're both from yorkshire aren't they 's from yorkshire anyway and they get
S0271	that's it
S0266	i think she be lovely i'd never meet her husband think she be lovely
S0268	i i find it quite tricky actually
S0266	she do our kid well because she she coach
S0268	she's very mathematical and
S0266	mm and she's a very good teacher and the kid be quite frighten of her which i always think be quite good
S0268	i find her quite to talk to really because
S0271	so when do they go a level
S0268	no it be fine
S0270	too much logic
S0266	no not a level maths just for gcses
S0268	part of that i think it's a mathematician
S0271	mm
S0268	i think you know
S0271	oh i say to go to it be a level maths
S0266	well it might be her cos she's a very very clever lady
S0268	i mean i'm i'm not sure to be honest i think he's he's get he's a technical man
S0270	he's retire then
S0268	yes he's retire i think he's technical in the medical field but i but i don't think he's a doctor or anything erm but i do you know what er do
S0266	he could be a biochemist
S0268	he's a really nice guy actually really really nice guy
S0266	i tell you who they're very good friends with erm the husband and wife be with and
S0268	yes but she mention
S0266	because she use to teach at
S0268	mm
S0266	as well erm
S0268	mm she say about you not work at anymore and i have to bite my tongue
S0266	mm
S0268	mm so i didn't say too much
S0271	oh that's good
S0268	a little bite but they do mention and er and i say well we go on holiday with her
S0266	what do she say
S0268	to corfu didn't offer any sort of opinion about it but er yeah so they they they know quite a lot of people that er
S0268	that we all know they they know and erm and the vet and everything
S0271	what happen to wasn't she ill at one point
S0268	mm
S0270	well she's she's dead
S0271	oh be she dead oh i didn't realise that
S0270	yeah
S0271	oh so it's just her husband live there
S0268	mm
S0270	yeah and that's how
S0268	do he live on his own or have he get children
S0271	well he's get children but they're not at home
S0268	they're not at home so in that big house
S0271	well i think he rent off part of it
S0268	oh right it's a lovely house
S0271	wasn't it sudden or something
S0266	well i think the inquest be still drag on after two years or more
S0271	what happen
S0266	well i don't think it i think it's a mystery whether
S0271	what be she find dead or something
S0266	yeah and whether she'd overdose herself or do something or fall or no one really know which i think it's a terrible
S0268	it's not the sort of thing you bring up either
S0266	no
S0268	to the husband
S0270	no absolutely not
S0268	mm
S0270	oh seem to be get out of erm impetus to follow this idea that she's go to take the er surgeon to court
S0268	mm
S0270	erm
S0268	not surprise
S0270	erm
S0266	be the when be the inquest on that
S0270	i don't know will know but i'm not ever ask i just know that she go to london to seek erm er a lawyer's advice
S0266	to london
S0270	mm
S0266	do she need to go
S0271	i suppose you have to go there to get these medical expert lawyers don't you
S0268	mm
S0270	round to sort of er see how it have go and i didn't believe except that it be very helpful and then we get onto other tacs and she be try to make her way to see 's
S0271	i'm sure the surgeon didn't do it purposely but erm
S0270	no but i think it's help to vent her anger isn't it her
S0271	yeah yeah you'd feel like that i understand
S0270	but i don't know if it's go to be at all helpful in the long term future
S0271	mm
S0270	cos no one will ever operate would they if they're
S0271	no
S0270	sue for every single one that go wrong
S0271	if it be go yes
S0268	mm
S0270	but if it's your of your nearest and dearest you're go to want to do it either you want to take revenge i don't think
S0266	i i go to erm to an inquest to 's inquest for the first time ever in my life i don't know if you've be to an inquest
S0270	no
S0266	it be a horrible experience
S0268	mm
S0266	you know because they just read it endless statements and it's just as if it's
S0271	not a person
S0266	not a person really
S0271	mm
S0266	and and and really hurtful things
S0270	and the trouble be
S0266	for for for members that i mean like his daughter be there and you know and they be say you know say things like well of course he find life even more difficult after he'd have a child you know
S0268	very
S0266	and this poor kid's be through her his her father commit suicide and then she's it's almost as if she's to blame
S0271	blame yeah
S0266	you know it's absolutely nothing to do with her
S0270	and she be an absolutely joy that that she have happen i would think from him an absolute joy
S0270	because he have another another aspect to his life
S0268	mm
S0266	and i mean so have they set an er er date for an inquest
S0270	i i haven't ask but i'm sure know because she's involve with it
S0271	they're usually quite a long time after the death aren't they inquests
S0270	i guess it all all all all party will be reflect what every day won't they i don't think it will be helpful at all long term but i guess it's a good
S0271	if he's a good surgeon it would be really sad if he have to give up
S0270	i be just think entirely from the 's point of view
S0266	but i don't think they'll never find they'll never find that erm you know that won't be decision i it it doesn't work like that
S0270	doesn't it
S0266	no i don't think so
S0270	have a completely different slant on the whole thing
S0266	what do she feel
S0270	well she's extremely knowledgeable about all these things so she say the fact that she'd prognosis for his operation which he'd survive twelve years
S0266	mm
S0270	erm a good prognosis would be five
S0266	yeah
S0270	so he have make it to twelve already so erm she think that he actually know that it be extremely risky
S0266	who the surgeon
S0270	no because of the scar tissue
S0268	well i yeah i i well well
S0270	he know he know that a lot more than he be go to share with
S0268	when i go on that barbeque in the summer just shortly before he go into hospital
S0268	about a month before he be very worry about it he give the impression of be very worry
S0270	but as point out he wasn't breathe he wasn't swallow he be a lot of things
S0268	no exactly
S0270	yeah
S0268	exactly
S0271	so he have to make a decision to go for it
S0268	yeah yeah but i think and they would have spell it out beforehand because
S0271	yeah they always do they always tell you the risk don't they
S0268	they tell you your chance
S0271	yeah
S0268	so it would be interest to know what the chance be you know because when i have my bypass they say you've get a hundred to one chance of die on the operate table
S0271	well i be tell i stand a chance of die with mine
S0268	yeah what be your do they give you the odds
S0271	my brain yeah
S0268	be it a hundred to one
S0271	i can't remember what it be now
S0268	no
S0271	i could have a stroke i could die
S0268	yeah they say a hundred to one and a hundred to one afterwards so
S0271	they they have to tell you they have to sign the piece of paper that you understand it
S0268	yep yeah yeah yeah exactly that exactly that i can remember that
S0271	mm
S0268	yeah it's like sign your life away
S0271	and when she say the other day she say there be nothing wrong with him his liver be perfect he be really fit you could say to her look he's have cancer he's have a big operation and he wasn't really fit really his insides be not
S0270	she wasn't in a
S0271	i i wouldn't i wouldn't have say wouldn't have say anything
S0270	do anything that
S0271	no
S0268	but it do seem to be an error though doesn't it it do seem to have be an error
S0270	i be immediately my hackle be up immediately i think it be one thing to come and watch a wed from outside but to participate but you all seem cold about it and i just think
S0271	be a blood vessel cut through but if if you've have a big major operation like that things be not in the right place any longer be they
S0268	so he wasn't expect things to well yeah cos you can't always see things in
S0270	and she get very uptight about it and i don't know where all that come from we be just
S0271	it just come out didn't it he be fit his liver be perfect this be perfect
S0270	in the in in the church yard i have no idea what start it all but it all go
S0271	it start off talk about and
S0270	oh yes
S0271	and she say she'd be to another funeral
S0270	we be all we be all go to the funeral
S0271	and i say to her when you go to a funeral you always think of other funerals you do don't you
S0268	mm course
S0271	you always do and i say trouble be you know that's what be be for us all now isn't it go to funerals cos it be innit you get older
S0268	mm
S0271	and she immediately think that that erm he be too young to die and that be nothing to do with him at all be she be just off
S0270	yeah but it all just start didn't it anyhow
S0268	who who know really who's
S0271	but you i mean you speak to him very recent like before he die didn't you
S0268	well he yeah he be concern i i
S0270	i think it's really nice that you could talk to him
S0270	cos i think perhaps sometimes your partner aren't the best people to talk to
S0268	yeah
S0270	about those things
S0271	well she do say
S0268	well it do occur to me just how worry he be
S0270	mm
S0266	and do it you you notice
S0271	well you think he'd be very uncomfortable eat and everything i mean it's bad enough have indigestion isn't it but things like
S0268	well they talk about it a bite and that you know i think it be like a bite of a toss of a coin really whether to go ahead or not with it
S0271	mm about it
S0270	mm
S0266	or be it a general conversation or be it just you and he
S0268	well no there be and there as well so there be
S0266	oh you be all talk about it
S0268	and you be suppose to be there but you be in greece
S0266	i know it be a
S0268	but that be a really nice do it be a lovely even really warm we sit out and have a barbeque and be do all the stuff so my memories of be very sort of fond really you know i think

S0266	do you go with her or do you
S0271	no i meet her outside
S0266	oh right so you come and park up
S0271	so she's busy talk to all the guests outside whereas i felt that
S0266	up to the guests
S0271	yeah well i felt a
S0268	she can't
S0270	i mean i can't bear it myself i find it utterly
S0271	i be i i want to be last so i wasn't amongst the guests i want to slip in because they be all dress in their wed gear and but she be up there talk to people in their wed
S0268	yeah she be very in my face
S0270	i think she's just like one of those children at school who all get your attention you know in some way or another
S0271	what by wear funny clothe
S0270	no just by be entirely irritate the whole time they all get your
S0270	attention i'm like i haven't find you irritate since the awful demise of until this last occasion cos don't forget she and i have actually be meet up for walk and
S0271	you've see quite a bite of her
S0270	we've go off to we go off to lacock and do the erm world war two thing which be actually a really fun day you know we've do several things together which have be totally palatable so this irritate lady that be at the wed
S0270	i just didn't want to i just i just
S0266	what be the main thing that she be do that irritate you
S0270	er i think because
S0271	it be the performance outside the church
S0270	yeah yeah it just
S0271	but get
S0270	do the right things if you're go to go all your friends who be outside wait you know that's what you do you don't actually try and be the centre of attention at somebody else's wed cos the centre of attention be actually the bride and family
S0270	you be just you know as a guest you're along to make it go well but but come i don't know the whole thing
S0268	she be hyper i think and
S0270	yeah
S0268	and very loud
S0270	yes but that be but i think that's what she
S0271	and then she lose her house guest didn't she
S0270	i know she get irritate
S0270	so i say she say well she's a grow woman i'm not in charge i think well actually i think you be
S0271	she be quite nice that austrian woman
S0270	i didn't
S0266	it's funny cos someone say to me after after the wed oh and it be so interest because this erm i i i speak to this woman in the church who didn't know much english or be foreign or something and it be so good because she be just a foreigner pass and and she think it would be so nice to see an english wed so she come into the church
S0271	and that wasn't quite it
S0266	and it be only later i realise that it be 's friend
S0271	do say to her er be quite good for you to see an english wed
S0268	yeah that's right
S0266	ah
S0268	that's why she take her along mm
S0266	but how do know the wed be on
S0271	i don't know how she know the wed be on
S0270	i i don't think i spread anything
S0271	i expect
S0270	yeah it would have be yeah
S0268	i i find it quite
S0266	so be you with as well outside
S0270	no i be just entirely irritate
S0271	no i think be around
S0268	yeah i i can appreciate that but it be funny
S0271	i think we be probably the only ones in the church who weren't at the wed but it's not a very big church i imagine when i go to 's wed and i be sit right at the back
S0270	i be really i be really please to see those people you see
S0271	i think i'd be somewhere else with i think i'd be somewhere else i think i'd be someone else's wed
S0270	i be really please that you be there
S0271	i think several weddings with where you just sit at the back
S0266	but i don't think a lot of the people who go to the actual reception bother to come to the church
S0271	don't you think so the church seem full up
S0266	no there be we work out there would even be seat down the far side and there be
S0268	we've get a picture haven't we
S0266	yeah
S0268	a fish eye picture that come to
S0266	it's not very full so it be just as well that come with her foreign friend
S0268	in that picture the church doesn't look full do it it's all down the right there
S0266	yeah it should hold about a hundred and sixty hundred and eighty
S0271	it it's erm like a lot of church it must have have an extension on the right hand side mustn't it so you're not near the central aisle
S0270	i think it look lovely though i think
S0268	it look beautiful yeah
S0270	all the flower and everything be fabulous
S0268	it be a fantastic do
S0266	i'd have love to have be a fly on the wall though with you lot there beforehand
S0270	mm
S0266	see what be go on
S0270	it's quite hard at
S0268	well you be busy
S0271	be busy kiss the and people
S0270	who
S0271	do she know them
S0270	i tell you i be just entirely irritate
S0271	well i think
S0270	i can't believe it she hadn't even get an invite i just can't believe it
S0268	i think i take my hat off to her really
S0271	i be sit in i be sit in the car park
S0270	i didn't see it that way at all
S0271	i be sit in the car park wait for her to come so we could slip in late but she didn't appear and i think oh well perhaps i'd better go up and see if she's outside the church and there she be talk to the guests and kiss the and
S0268	she be kiss me and i think my kid as well
S0270	and she doesn't even know them
S0268	no
S0268	i do fair enough i do introduce them but they be really amuse when she start fiddle with my glass
S0271	sorry i sorry i didn't kiss your kid
S0268	no
S0270	we be talk the other day about when this kiss thing come in cos when i be grow up it definitely shake hand and
S0271	oh it's the last ten years
S0270	still shake hand you know eighty one er even with someone he know really quite well he do give me a kiss on the cheek but it's interest it's a definite sign of respect that you know he will he will shake their hand and it certainly wasn't something that i do in my childhood at all
S0268	no
S0271	well i can remember when we have the french exchange student over for i take this french girl around to the house where her friend be stay this other french girl and the girl open the door and these two french girls kiss each other teenagers that be kind of normal for french french girls
S0268	yeah
S0270	well yes but i mean for us
S0271	for us it's much i mean at at
S0268	i suppose you're right it's about ten years isn't it
S0271	at school our our english girls didn't kiss each other do they i don't know do they do that now
S0270	well they do cuddle now
S0271	yeah
S0270	i think they do hug don't they it's a much more general thing that people will hug and give each other a kiss
S0271	i think it's all these immigrants we've have here like cos he be always kiss quite happy to kiss another bloke cos he'd kiss your in the co op one day cos greeks kiss
S0270	because that's it's tradition from home
S0271	yeah
S0270	yeah but i don't know how when we brits have do it
S0268	it's get more and more prevalent amongst men now
S0271	yeah
S0268	which be a bite disturb
S0270	really
S0271	you don't know which one to kiss
S0270	call it a hug but not a kiss as well surely
S0268	oh it's a hug and a kind of touch of the cheek
S0271	a hug
S0268	yeah and a hug yeah it be a bite erm it's a bite disconcert
S0271	's very very easy at do that it doesn't worry him at all he'd hug any bloke
S0266	what no it's it i'm not against it i'm just wonder when it come in
S0271	do you hug each other at the men's erm
S0271	the men's lunch
S0268	i think everybody's sort of you know just size each other up especially when someone new come along like me you know i i didn't really go out of my way to shake hand or hug people or i just sort of
S0266	when be this sorry i
S0268	on friday
S0271	the men that lunch
S0268	men what lunch but i mean i i cos i go to the previous one
S0270	well you wouldn't hug people would you
S0268	no no not me but
S0271	actually when the women meet they don't all kiss do they
S0268	but it's happen it's begin to happen with men now
S0268	between two men you know cos it's always a thing with ladies isn't it i mean men and women but it's but it's begin to happen
S0271	cos it's hit and miss really isn't it if you go to somebody's house like i'd probably give you a kiss by it kind of seem natural but not always
S0270	yes it's special occasion
S0266	no you don't have to do it always
S0271	yes special occasion
S0266	or if you haven't see someone for some time
S0271	if you haven't see them for a while
S0270	but we definitely didn't use to do that
S0271	and also people at work
S0266	have they start kiss at work
S0271	erm nobody's kiss me lately
S0271	but like my old head i didn't
S0270	yeah lot of teachers do with me when we get back after
S0271	didn't sort of touch you didn't touch your boss but when it come for him to leave and that i have a few hug from him
S0268	mm
S0271	the new one's not
S0268	cos i i find it difficult i be in erm the middle east and you know every you shake hand all the time in the middle east you know you go into a shop and you shake hand with the boss or the people it's just you know just do all the time and i be in a kind of erm board school environment in oman and you go in in the morning you know wake the kid up and you'd shake hand with them you know you'd shake hand with every child in in the dorm
S0268	you wouldn't interestingly when they come into lessons you wouldn't shake hand but then in in any other situation if you saw them like in the socially in the playground or you
S0270	that would be a way of say hello
S0268	yeah you'd just shake hand so and maybe an arabic greet so
S0271	i think it's pole as well we've get this new little polish boy he's really quite young about six years old he he come and the teacher or someone be talk to him and he put out his hand to shake hand with her
S0268	yeah yeah yeah i i
S0271	the the pole be very polite
S0268	yes
S0271	and he's be bring up like that
S0268	poleite
S0268	but it's very much an arab thing you know that you just shake hand all the time erm
S0271	of course in the east you're busy bow all the time
S0268	well yes quite yeah be it just a bow or be it a be it hand together as well
S0271	i dunno in korea it be just bow it wasn't hand
S0268	cos you could get a headache if you hit and bow at the same time
S0268	too close
S0271	i know i be worry about i be worry about that at the wed i be gonna knock this little lady out with my head i didn't
S0270	she be shorter than you be korean
S0271	mm
S0268	be it all
S0266	i the funniest thing that happen the other day be when er take to actually meet her father for the first time and erm we we couldn't find anywhere to park so we be drive round and then they get out cos they saw him on the pavement wait and i miss it because the first thing he do be he he go up to who's very tall as you know and grab him and give him three kiss on his cheek
S0271	i be just say when you be walk round there 'll kiss you when you go in to the co op once
S0266	yeah that's right yeah but yeah but then that's normal for
S0271	yeah well that be normal for him as well your girl wasn't
S0266	but it wasn't normal for and he say look you know i i be prepare to accept anything about your father have not meet him and hear all about him but not to be kiss three time he be
S0270	well she should have warn him about that possibility
S0271	no he probably just do it naturally that's what he would have do in in greece
S0266	yeah absolutely totally naturally but didn't very natural
S0270	it be a surprise to him
S0266	to meet to meet this man for the first time and he didn't speak but he just come up and kiss him in a sort of big way
S0270	do you miss erm be teach out in oman do you miss teach
