S0008	you know when you have sort of a close up of their head
S0012	yeah
S0008	they be almost life size but not overpoweringly big you know
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	but all the new tellies instead of be square be elongate
S0012	that's right
S0008	so you don't get so much height but you get more width
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i work out that a twenty four be about the same height as the one we have so you didn't get the
S0013	oh i see
S0008	the big head you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but because it's twenty six it seem that
S0012	trouble be
S0008	there's something a little bite over power you know
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	because our room isn't very big
S0012	no
S0008	so you're sit fairly close and try to get near the fire as well
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	i've be have to sit further and further back to watch it
S0012	it it have you get a a smart aspect on yours so
S0008	yeah
S0012	that go like that
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	you can see
S0012	so you can put it on auto
S0008	that's right auto sixty nine twenty three
S0012	yeah well sometimes when it's on auto it'll stretch out a an old film or something like that
S0008	yeah
S0012	and they look really big and wide
S0008	that's right yeah
S0012	don't they
S0008	so you have to close it up
S0012	so you close it up to the the four by three i think it's call
S0013	mm
S0008	but i think one of the problems i have be that i i stick it on cos you've get two zoom as well
S0012	you've get zoom yeah
S0008	i stick it on the zoom to watch the motorbike race
S0012	oh right
S0008	and of course you forget to turn it off
S0008	and suddenly you've get this big huge people in your face shout and ah la la
S0013	oh i think that be you again okay
S0012	we just water a plant that's all
S0008	what be that
S0012	just water a plant innit
S0013	i only allow ten minutes
S0012	pardon
S0008	what be that time the plant
S0013	yeah
S0008	we're water the plant yeah
S0012	oh i just sit mine in a bucket of water and
S0013	yeah well i forget them if i do that
S0008	and come back about a day later yeah that's right must drain them
S0012	that there pink one be do really well in in the other room
S0008	yeah
S0012	she's now water all the rest of them but one of them be go for it i think
S0008	yeah i get i get a a pink one which have just come out into full flower
S0012	yeah
S0008	but before it have about six leave
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know quite a lot and then it have about five or six shoot come up full of the flower right
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	and it belong to 's mum
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i say we'll have them back at mine and sort of look after them until they come into flower well at the moment it's just get one shoot out in the flower
S0012	oh right
S0008	you know what i mean i'm i don't know whether to give it back to her less
S0012	while it's in flower
S0008	yeah but i know what what she'll do she'll cut all the other shoot off and over water it and then i'll get it back and it's just sort of urgh
S0012	so keep it
S0008	mm might do
S0012	yeah well our pink one in the other room that's fantastic we've do nothing with that
S0008	mm
S0012	only i think stand up
S0008	that's too sunny there innit
S0012	on there it's too sunny too hot
S0008	yeah they yeah cos mine seem to thrive and i've get a north face window i mean it's a bite of light come in but it be there's no direct sun at all
S0012	yeah well well if you think about where they grow they grow in jungles in the of tree
S0008	yeah that's right i mean they don't get much sun do they
S0012	and they don't get hardly any sun there
S0008	no
S0012	so i don't think she should keep them on the in on the well they're alright in the winter but
S0008	yeah in what a bite too hot for them in the summer
S0012	yeah they roast we have that one on the on the window sill and that roast
S0008	oh really
S0012	yeah
S0008	they use to be a real sixty's plant didn't they
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	everyone use to have them and then spider plant
S0012	and the spider plant yeah and mother in law's tongue
S0008	yeah and er rubber plant and rubber tree
S0012	yeah rubber plant cheese plant
S0008	we have a rubber tree in our flat and er slowly all the leave drop off and it be just a pot about that big which people use to use as an ash tray with the single pole stick up we just leave it there and then after about eighteen months someone notice that be shoot again start water it again it start grow again
S0012	what
S0008	it be grow leave
S0012	wow
S0008	but it have go eighteen months with no water
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's do quite well
S0012	that's weird isn't it
S0008	yeah
S0012	weird that must have go dormant for that long then
S0008	well yeah i suppose so
S0012	yeah plant do plant be weird things aren't they i mean we we through throughout the winter we bring this little plant up that that be dead
S0008	mm
S0012	by all purpose that be dead then there be a shoot and that come up and that grow and we we wrap it around this big wire wire thing and it come out beautiful
S0008	mm mm
S0012	come the summer dead again
S0008	oh right so it do that then
S0012	well it's suppose to be in flower in august
S0008	oh right yeah i mean er i get this er our abutilon which get a seed from from durham
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they come out in little red flower
S0012	i like them
S0008	and er this particular one have be freeze off twice
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it still have this little bite of green leave so i think well one leaf so i bring it indoors this winter and um it's sort of come to life again and i'll give it some growmore i though i'll let it grow a few leave cos it's just like a twig with a leaf on the top
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i re pot it in a big pot
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	you know and give it some root cos i tend to leave flower leave these things in too smaller pot
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know cos they don't do very well then if you
S0012	no
S0008	you know they're so susceptible to dry out
S0012	they be aren't they yeah
S0008	you know unless you're very careful water them
S0012	yeah well
S0008	whereas with a big pot you know you can put quite a bite in damp in there for them
S0012	that that plant we reckon that be not very good be die off
S0013	yeah
S0012	that one that we never water
S0013	um yeah
S0012	when you think about we be talk about when you think about where they're live they're live in the jungle in tree
S0013	mm
S0012	not in bright sunlight
S0013	no no we think about move it didn't we
S0012	yeah
S0013	we move that one
S0012	we move that one and hopefully that'll survive
S0013	mm
S0012	but i think that that one in particular don't like it at all
S0013	yeah it's the same orchid isn't it yeah
S0012	same yeah
S0013	actually none of them look very happy at the moment
S0012	well we do have some we do have some hot weather didn't we
S0013	yes yes we do
S0008	well that's right it be cos my green house be blimmin scorch
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah and then bang crash we get
S0008	yeah frost
S0012	yeah
S0013	cold again
S0012	so nothing have nothing have do anything
S0013	we'll have to move them all over i'll probably put them all over there
S0012	learn last night why the potato crop wasn't very good last year
S0008	cos of the late frost
S0012	not only because of the late frost because of the cold nights in may and june

S0012	yeah that be that's that's
S0008	the whole thing
S0012	as you say everything be money orientate and if anyone can see how to rip somebody else off they'll be in there like a shoot
S0008	yeah i mean you get these sort of people who get so sentimental about animals don't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	you know they're just open season for someone to rip off
S0012	well that be yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	oh we'll look after it we'll we'll we'll give it a good burial and what have you just sign here and er we'll make sure that you er keep up your er money supply every year otherwise you know it will become obsolete and that'll have to
S0008	otherwise we'll have to kill it
S0012	oh dear that go on and on don't it it's awful innit
S0008	when be about well this must be about ten years ago now no more than that must be nigh on fifteen years ago um they take to the redwingsred wing
S0013	oh
S0012	oh god yeah
S0008	or something like that you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and persuade to sponsor this pony
S0012	a horse
S0008	blacky or stripy or or whatever
S0013	oh
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know you'd pay on sort of it you know on this sort of deal
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know get all the literature through oh this be your this be your horse
S0013	your
S0008	about fifteen years later i'm obviously on the my address be on the data base
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos every year i get this sort of stuff go invite me to sponsor a horse
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	you know help do you know what and it's still get the same picture of the same bloody horse
S0013	no
S0008	i mean it must have die by now
S0012	that's ridiculous innit yeah
S0013	oh yeah yeah
S0008	do you know what i mean and people think oh i'm i'm keep that horse alive no you're not
S0012	no you're not your make someone rich
S0008	yeah make someone rich and then the next thing you know they go and buy some country estate
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	cos they need the field for the horse
S0013	yeah
S0008	and er go and live in the you know in the
S0012	and that's run as a charity so they don't actually pay anything
S0008	tax no
S0012	anything for the country estate
S0008	no taxation pay
S0012	no taxation or anything like that
S0008	i mean place like redwings they get they've get an income of something like ten million a year haven't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	of like donations
S0013	i know it's huge isn't it
S0008	and it's a lot of money isn't it
S0012	yeah that be a lot of money
S0013	mm
S0008	and the last thing i saw they be bring horse over from er romania
S0012	yeah
S0008	rescue horse from romania
S0012	what's the point of that
S0008	and then
S0012	they could fee people over there
S0013	well they've get more horse for everyone to go and see
S0012	yeah but that could fee people in romania couldn't it
S0008	well that's right
S0013	yeah
S0008	they're take the food out of the mouth of children
S0012	huh they be aren't they yeah
S0013	well if they buy them from romania they're give the money to the people
S0008	but the thing be
S0012	no they don't
S0013	don't they
S0008	i mean the thing be in romania there's still an awful lot of horse isn't there
S0012	yeah there be
S0008	cos they're still they're still sort of the last sort of stag of the horse and cart industry
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	especially in the countryside and er i can't understand that cos you have these program about how badly they treat the horse
S0012	i think that's stupid yeah
S0008	you'd think that any farmer would realise that a horse be an expensive asset
S0012	yeah
S0008	you'd treat it properly wouldn't you
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	you would wouldn't you yeah

S0012	yeah
S0013	we can leave the door open
S0008	but when you've get a side there like you you can't put poke things out and er you know

S0008	yep that's a swallow
S0012	that weren't a swallow be it and the next day they be fly about like that you know
S0012	but i don't know whether they be swallow or not i think they be house not housemartins sandmartins
S0008	mm mm
S0012	or you know something like that martins i think
S0008	mm mm
S0012	cos they be the first ain't they the martins and then the swallow and then the swifts innit
S0008	last year when we go down to to happisburgh the sandmartins have have a nest in the
S0012	yeah
S0008	there be load and load of them
S0012	yeah
S0008	well load and load of them i suppose about fifty
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be quite a lot i suppose
S0012	yeah
S0008	and like the cliff be actually completely stud with
S0012	drill with hole
S0008	drill with hole yeah
S0012	yeah that's some of it have fell down now hasn't it
S0008	well it's always fall down innit
S0012	and then they have to buy the council have now buy the house haven't they and and demolish them
S0008	yeah well they always they've be talk about that for a long while
S0012	yeah
S0008	but cos you know there's this thing about
S0012	why have they buy the house
S0008	i don't know
S0012	seem stupid to go and
S0008	no the government the government give compensation to the owners
S0012	do it
S0008	yeah but why because a lot of them be only you know have be there like five years
S0012	yeah
S0008	ten years
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean they're not give them full compensation
S0012	no but the people who buy them house on the cliff know
S0008	well yeah of course
S0012	exactly what be go to happen
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	so
S0013	that's why you they're cheaper aren't they
S0012	that's why they're a lot cheaper
S0008	yeah
S0012	they're a lot cheaper than anywhere else you can buy anything
S0013	mm mm
S0012	but i mean they they buy the house when that's the cliff and that be the house
S0008	yeah
S0012	and now that's their house and that's the cliff now
S0008	exactly yeah they're still dangerous to let people live there innit
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	you know i suppose they've get this theory that they won't you know just chuck people out of their house
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know willy nilly just cos it's you know just cos it's dangerous
S0012	yeah
S0008	so they have to give them something i suppose
S0012	well i suppose they do yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	but i mean when people do buy the house on there they know that the cliffs be erode that's all
S0008	yeah yeah yeah and that's why they you know they sort of take
S0012	yeah
S0008	make you wonder how long that'll be before the pub and the church go down
S0012	well that's right yeah
S0008	i mean they're quite a way away now
S0012	and what about the lighthouse
S0008	well the lighthouse as well yeah
S0012	yeah the lighthouse be
S0008	i mean it's quite a way away they're quite well back from the edge
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but you think well a hundred years or something that must be
S0012	well that's gotta be hasn't it yeah
S0008	that must be nearly seven hundred years' time
S0012	i be at the dentist a couple of a couple of days ago down at and i be read a book or just a not a book a magazine scientific magazine it be
S0008	mm mm
S0012	funnily enough in a dentist
S0012	and er in oh i forget um how long ago there be a big tsunami that start in greenland wash over the shetland islands and down into the north sea and flood quite a lot of place
S0008	mm
S0012	and they're talk about it because the ice be melt the ice actually hold the crust together and now they reckon that because it's lighter the crust have start to move again all the the sub have start to move again and within a hundred years we're doom to have
S0008	we're doom
S0012	yeah to have a huge tsunami which will actually wash away east anglia
S0008	yeah be we suppose to get worry
S0012	be you worry
S0008	no
S0012	no i'm not worry
S0008	i mean the thing be we think they come out with these theories but it's only a theory
S0012	well cause it's only a theory yeah
S0008	i mean it be true that place like greenland they're lift out of the sea
S0012	that's lift out of the sea cos they're two two centimetres a year innit
S0008	something like that but it's the weight of the ice be go
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	they're come up but i mean it weren't so long ago that they say that someone come out about things like all the ice in the himalayas would melt in twenty years or something
S0012	that's right yeah and the lakes at the top there will flood the villages below
S0008	that's right yeah and what have you and
S0012	yeah
S0008	then the gandhis' will dry up
S0012	yeah wash away all the villages cos they'll wash away all the villages
S0008	yeah someone else look at the figure and say oh actually you've get the decimal point in the wrong place it's not gonna happen at all
S0012	no
S0008	that's dead embarrass innit with something like that
S0013	oh dear
S0012	well that that that be very very like er the british mission to mar weren't it

S0012	especially with that big screen
S0024	yeah yeah the big screen do it doesn't help have a big screen do it
S0012	that doesn't help have a big screen i i do agree with you
S0024	and that screen be very bright
S0012	yeah
S0024	so bright
S0012	i've turn turn it right down to
S0024	i know but it's brighter than
S0012	yeah
S0024	yeah it's a shame you can't turn it down any more yes no more computer for me today i be just about to go outside and it just start rain
S0012	yeah tipple down
S0024	yeah
S0012	tipple down like mad
S0008	last year
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	you know erm windows seven
S0012	yeah
S0008	that only work on sixty four bite computers don't it
S0012	and and thirty two
S0008	but most computers nowadays be sixty four
S0012	yeah they be
S0008	be yours sixty four then
S0012	no thirty two
S0013	
S0024	yeah
S0008	i be just wonder if you've get you know a new computer that's sixty four bite windows seven on it will that run old program
S0012	no
S0008	isn't there you can't isn't there a thing where you can you know
S0012	there use to be on the other ones but there there isn't on the sixty four bite one
S0008	well this be what i think yeah cos it's a different altogether isn't it
S0012	yeah it's different cos er
S0008	so you can't run anything old no old program on that
S0012	i don't think so no
S0008	mm
S0012	it's like try to run er windows ninety five
S0008	mm
S0012	you know it be only sixteen bite
S0008	yeah
S0012	i can't run any sixteen bite stuff on a thirty two bite computer
S0008	yeah but you do they do use to give that you know that compatibility thing
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	where you could actually set it up so that it would run
S0012	yeah i don't know whether there's
S0008	and like windows seven be so big i'm sure they must or maybe they haven't include that in it
S0012	er not on the sixty four i don't think on the sixty four bite you i think you've get it on the thirty two bite but not
S0012	cos you can buy the two bite you can buy the two ones you know you you can either buy a thirty two bite
S0008	mm
S0012	and i think they actually on a sixty four bite one that will downgrade to a thirty two bite one you know on on the computer itself
S0008	yeah
S0012	i i couldn't be quite sure
S0008	oh no no it's just that 's be bend my ear about buy a new laptop for her
S0012	yeah
S0008	and and a new laptop it's a dell you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it's a pretty good one dual core you know thing but it's sixty four bite
S0012	dual core
S0008	and so you've get what
S0012	a dual core one for sixty four bite
S0008	yeah and i have three dual core no doubt no less
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er she's sort of worry about all her old like office and photoshop whether that'll work on it
S0012	photoshop weren't work on it you have to have a sixty four bite photoshop to work on it
S0008	mm
S0012	i don't know whether photoshop will allow you to upgrade to sixty four bits
S0008	mm
S0012	cos they do do er with xp they do do a sixty four bite on xp and if she's get xp
S0008	mm and i doubt her old an old office will work either will it
S0012	an old office weren't work at all
S0008	cos they want to flog you a new one
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i tell her open office and google

S0008	yeah
S0024	oh good
S0008	yeah i didn't have to trade that in
S0024	hmm mm
S0012	he just trade in for a car
S0024	no it's nice
S0012	you poor
S0024	no what the car be nice
S0012	oh right i think you say that's nice because she he trade
S0008	it be the most expensive car i've ever buy
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	i think you've get a bargain i mean look at it and listen to it
S0008	well it seem to like i say it seem to be alright
S0013	it's a lovely car innit
S0024	yeah
S0008	but the thing i like about it be
S0012	economical
S0008	it's sort of get plenty of meat around it you know what i mean
S0012	mm
S0008	it's a pretty solid thing
S0024	mm
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0008	and er
S0024	yeah you don't want the ones that just crumple at a touch
S0012	well this be this be er this it but um and also there's not many of them about
S0012	no
S0008	so you you know but the trouble with them be be they they stop make them in two thousand
S0012	do they
S0008	yeah and then they leave it a year then they well no they stop make them in ninety eight
S0012	oh right
S0013	yeah they
S0008	and then they leave it a couple of years and then they start make them again
S0012	huh
S0024	what be it
S0008	it's a citron xsara
S0024	oh
S0008	x sara
S0024	uh huh
S0008	but they the reason they start make them again be because they use exactly the same
S0012	gigs
S0008	what be it chassis and everything
S0012	yeah
S0008	and the engine for the xsara picasso right
S0012	oh right
S0008	you know those ones with the sort of dome shape things
S0024	uh huh
S0008	and they're exactly the same and i suppose that you know sort of say well you know basically you're make it why don't you just make the hatchback as well
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they start churn them out again
S0013	oh right
S0008	but the trouble be you can't get a a handbook which be get everything in it because all the handbooks be for the early model and they sort of improve quite a bite of the stuff inside of them
S0012	yeah
S0008	like the air condition and stuff like this
S0013	hm
S0008	and all the control and all this stuff on the steer wheel
S0012	yeah
S0008	and like you get er you know we have we didn't get a book with it so i have to buy a book
S0013	oh
S0008	and of course it's all that all the stuff which be old you know erm not up to date
S0012	oh
S0008	although it's the book for that modal
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	it doesn't actually tell you what all the things do
S0024	oh hm
S0008	but who care eh
S0012	well i suppose you can search on the net for some answer can't you
S0008	yeah i expect so hopefully i won't have to
S0013	that's right
S0008	but it would be nice to know how the how the air condition work
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh i see
S0008	and how it how to operate the control although i say to don't turn that on you're use more petrol
S0012	yes
S0008	or more diesel
S0024	yep
S0013	yeah
S0008	but i'll tell you what it don't use it use very little fuel
S0012	do it yeah that's good
S0013	mm
S0008	well it's good in one well it be good you know but you know one of the ways they you know make them so economical be that the you know you can't race em around
S0012	no you can't you can't can you
S0008	you know you put your you put your foot down and it just sort of like pull off you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	you don't and you have to really try hard
S0024	the car that i hire be very good on the diesel
S0008	yeah
S0024	and it have good acceleration
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah well that be a new one weren't it brand spank
S0008	yeah but they be very light
S0024	mm
S0008	you see what i mean whereas these be very heavy
S0024	yeah yeah
S0008	and you know you're drag a lot more weight around with you and er it's alright you know you keep it in low gear
S0012	yeah
S0008	and sort of rev it up through the gear but i'm sort of use to just like stick in a gear and just and that go
S0012	yeah right
S0008	it's sort of lazy drive really
S0012	well ours ours
S0024	mm like ours
S0012	well yeah well ours be very lazy drive innit
S0024	i'm a very lazy driver
S0012	but it's get erm if you're go to try to pass something and they put their toe down or something and you're go like that
S0008	mm
S0012	you either get to fall back or you stick your foot down to the board and that'll broom
S0008	that's right
S0012	and that'll just go that'll just pull away really really good innit
S0008	mm i've find with this one well if you get into fifth gear it hasn't get much poke then
S0012	no i don't suppose it have
S0008	you know i mean it's good yeah i mean the thing be that you when you're drive you seldom get above two thousand rev
S0012	no that's right
S0008	you see what i mean
S0013	mm
S0008	and like you need two and a half thousand to get the turbo work
S0012	yeah yeah yeah
S0008	and that sort of gap between put your foot down and try to get up to the turbo come in
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's just sort of you have to change down gear which you know as a young driver you're sort of quite good at but once you get to our age it's you tend to sort of like stay in the same one it's not the same be it
S0024	i like i like do the gear
S0008	mm
S0024	see you get you're use to automatic now
S0013	yes we be
S0012	well i'm i'm very use to automatic now
S0024	you forget don't you
S0008	be yours automatic
S0013	it's lovely
S0012	yeah
S0008	oh i see right
S0013	easy drive
S0008	yeah
S0012	and that's just get this booster where if you put your toe down that go in into a boost
S0008	kick down it's call
S0012	kick down that's it
S0013	oh
S0008	yeah
S0012	it's get the kick down
S0013	no that come unusual really we have a choice of when we go to get the other cars before that one
S0012	yeah
S0013	we have a choice of two
S0008	mm
S0013	and i plump for one that would happen to be automatic and once i'd do automatic i don't wanna drive anything else
S0008	mm
S0012	no it use a lot more petrol though than a gear gear stick one
S0013	i know but you enjoy it too don't you
S0012	i do i'm i'm just so lazy now it's untrue
S0024	it's so it's so nice just to
S0008	it hasn't hasn't get a erm
S0024	doesn't it keep you awake have to use the gear and stuff
S0012	not on a motorway it won't keep you wake
S0008	no
S0013	no it's fine
S0012	you can still fall asleep on the motorway
S0013	oh you
S0008	yeah
S0013	ah
S0008	at the er you haven't get a cruise control as well
S0012	no
S0008	if you have an automatic and cruise control you just click it in
S0012	yeah one day that'll come about where
S0013	that will
S0008	and i'll tell you what that ain't gonna be that far away
S0012	that isn't gonna be that far away
S0013	for thirty years i've say haven't i
S0024	what with little sensors on the front
S0008	yeah that's right
S0013	haven't i
S0012	yes you have
S0013	probably more than that
S0008	you won't have to steer it at all on a motorway you know
S0024	mm
S0008	you know
S0024	mm
S0008	what's the point of steer all you've get to do be
S0013	yeah just make sure you're so far away from your next vehicle
S0008	make sure your not you're at a distance away from the car
S0012	you'll have a satellite guide you round
S0008	and it will well you don't need that cos it just check the size of the roads
S0012	well that's true yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and recognise when it go off the line or whatever
S0024	yeah
S0008	and just that off you go
S0024	yep
S0012	yeah yeah and and you
S0008	make a cup of tea phone your mat up
S0008	play your i phone play your i phone
S0012	and you won't be able to get any closer than two chevrons away
S0013	no
S0008	that's right
S0013	mm mm
S0012	why have some roads get chevrons on and some roads haven't
S0024	what's a chevron
S0013	it's
S0024	the the length of a car
S0013	yes i suspect so
S0012	it's these these er arrows like that
S0013	the arrow things
S0012	right
S0024	oh
S0013	mm
S0024	oh okay
S0012	and they'd tail you
S0008	it's an upside v
S0024	mm
S0012	yeah and it tell you to keep two chevrons away in certain part part
S0008	you know it's a brake distance
S0013	have you not come across them
S0024	on the road
S0012	yeah
S0013	it say keep two chevrons away
S0008	it's the
S0024	what in english
S0012	yes that's true
S0008	no they say it in you know german
S0024	no
S0024	well i i i think it be it be a symbol that read that before i've never read before
S0013	no it say quite clearly keep two chevrons away
S0008	no it's just a mark on the road like
S0024	i've never hear of a chevron
S0008	and like when the car in front of you go over the chevron
S0024	mm
S0008	you should the you should be go over your chevron
S0013	mm you should be able to see two
S0008	you see what i mean so that gap and you know
S0024	yeah but the the things on the road that make you slow down ready for the round about
S0008	no they're not
S0024	no no
S0012	no no no no these be the chevrons
S0013	that's just
S0008	these be a speed control
S0012	and and a gap
S0024	i er i haven't be on a big motorway be it on a big motorway
S0012	oh yes they're on the motorways
S0013	yeah
S0008	but they also have this
S0024	so i haven't see them cos i haven't be on a big motorway
S0008	but what's that thing you have to count
S0013	yes you have
S0024	no i haven't i've only do the a roads
S0012	oh yeah you do have to
S0008	there's another there's another one isn't there
S0013	oh she go a different way to us maybe
S0012	yeah oh yeah
S0008	there's another one isn't there when the car in front go over the line
S0024	i haven't be on any big motorways
S0013	right
S0008	you have to count what up to what before you go over the line
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	that's one say something
S0012	yeah one elephant
S0013	that's what you're suppose to do
S0008	one hippopotamus two hippopotamus
S0013	but they don't say that do they
S0013	they don't have a label say it do they
S0012	but that's that's the speed you'll be at if you carry on like that you'll be able to stop if that bloke suddenly stop you will be able to stop
S0013	mm
S0024	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	that's that's the guideline
S0024	yeah cos we have to learn all the distance
S0008	but the chance of him stop be like hit a brick wall
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh
S0008	which be ridiculous really isn't it
S0012	that be innit yeah
S0008	cos he's gonna take some time to stop isn't he
S0012	he be isn't he yeah yeah but i do stay a long way away from the car in front on a motorway
S0024	oh me too me too
S0012	because you get idiots
S0024	you never know what's gonna happen
S0012	we're we're travel at seventy mile an hour in the middle lane
S0024	mm
S0012	and a car
S0008	bet they're move on you and flash you
S0012	no a car on the inside lane would come past you and then out into the middle lane and then out into the outside lane and overtake you
S0008	well usually it's people who come you know up the slip road
S0012	yeah
S0008	they come roar up the slip road straight through all the traffic don't they you know
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0013	right across to the overtake lane
S0024	yeah
S0012	and you wonder why people have accidents so i i always stay a long way away from the the bloke in front don't we
S0024	yeah
S0013	mm
S0024	this
S0012	but you you also get people come in like that
S0024	yeah
S0008	mm
S0012	and then you go back again
S0024	yep yeah
S0012	and then someone else will come up like lightning
S0024	oh that's that's what always happen to me
S0012	yeah
S0024	cos i leave quite a you know a good distance
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah
S0024	then i get people overtake me and then go in there
S0013	and then
S0024	and i'm think what be the point of that
S0012	yeah what's the point of that
S0024	there you're you're still behind whatever i'm behind
S0012	yeah yeah
S0024	and they sit there
S0008	it's very annoy
S0012	but
S0024	but then they do it one at a time don't they
S0013	mm
S0012	i like comfortable drive now
S0024	yeah
S0008	white knuckle
S0012	instead of knuckle instead of white knuckle drive

S0012	well cause you don't know
S0008	although it's your right of way you know

S0012	yes yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0012	yeah that's weird
S0008	you know they start to build the house do i tell you that they start build the house
S0012	they've start build have they
S0012	yeah they've get the foot of one house in
S0012	oh god
S0008	and but they haven't be there at all this week
S0012	haven't they
S0008	i suppose they have a couple of days off for easter and take the whole week off
S0012	take the whole week off yeah
S0008	but they've get a lot of plant there
S0012	have they
S0008	they've get all pretty new
S0012	yeah
S0008	they've get a jcb er you know one of the good uns
S0012	yeah
S0008	they've get a dumper they've get an all terrain sort of extendable forklift truck crane thing
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er what else have they get there they've get a water bowser and you know and you know all this sort of it's sort of more there seem to be more plant than there be blokes
S0012	crikey they've get a water bowser they ain't gonna lay the water on first then
S0008	no but they sort of do one dig one lot of foot out and put
S0012	yeah
S0008	and bricked up the damp course and before they leave they be dig some really big trench across the back where that sort of drain it all
S0012	oh
S0008	a soak way or something like that
S0013	oh
S0024	be you alright
S0013	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0008	but since since it's be rain and they've go away like they've get this massive great trench a trench seem to have anything in it
S0024	i'll be back
S0008	and like the water level be it's fill up with water that far from the top
S0012	be it well it must be low water table then a high water table
S0008	well there be but this be what we say all along there's a really high water table there cos every time it rain that field use to flood
S0012	yeah that's right you do didn't you yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	so how they're gonna put soak ways in if you've get a water table that high
S0012	well that's right yeah well that's gonna be difficult they'll have to run them straight into the sewage
S0008	they won't be allow to will they
S0012	no they won't will they
S0008	no
S0012	they might put tank in
S0008	what
S0012	they might put tank in
S0008	yeah but if they do the tank will fill up with water won't they grind water
S0012	well they will yeah
S0008	cos i mean they only they're two way aren't they they're suppose to soak out but they'll just fill up
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	god know
S0012	but they might put er your economical yeah not economical the tank that you can use for
S0008	oh yeah for grey water
S0012	for grey water yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah yeah i can see that happen
S0012	then you get it
S0008	but this site be absolutely full i i think they've i don't think the house be where they be show on the original plan
S0012	aren't they
S0008	you know what you be say about these people
S0012	yeah
S0008	no on check once they've put the plan through
S0012	they don't they don't check up
S0008	they seem to be a lot closer to my fence than they should be
S0012	do they
S0008	and er but the er they have er someone come out and pay out four house right and like okay they dig the the foot out for the first one you know put all the profile out and so that be alright
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then all the so more they dig out they sort of dump all round the site all round the edge and then they start bring in load of bricks and then they plant all these they've get all these machine there as well they've get two site offices there as well and a loo
S0012	oh
S0008	and er and then they sort of dig these foot out and like all these peg they have put in have all be smash out now
S0012	cause they would yeah
S0008	they've sort of like be run over cos there's not space at all to do anything
S0012	no
S0013	oh
S0012	that's a bite stupid weren't it
S0008	and they haven't even try to put a road in i mean normally you put a road in first
S0012	you put a road in first yeah
S0008	yeah you put the road and sewer in first then something else
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	not this mob
S0013	mm
S0008	so that will be interest to see how
S0013	yeah
S0012	well you can go out and give them some ideas
S0008	sort of lean on the gate i suppose you know you're do this all wrong
S0012	that's it that's the one that's the one i use to be a civil engineer i know what i'm talk about
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah i think i think they they must be finish off a job somewhere else because you know there doesn't seem to be get on very quick
S0012	no
S0008	consider that what the house they've put the foot in they're already sell
S0012	yeah
S0008	and there's people wait there to move in you'd think they'd whip that up
S0012	they've already sell them have they
S0008	well that one they have yeah
S0012	wow
S0013	mm
S0008	i think they've already sell two of them
S0012	have they
S0008	but you'd think they'd whip them up and get the money wouldn't you and
S0012	you would yeah yes so they've get enough money to pay for the next lot
S0008	that's right
S0013	oh
S0008	but it's go to be interest next week cos erm that road along there cos there's an infant school there
S0012	yeah
S0008	and like in the mornings and in the afternoons
S0012	wow
S0008	that road be just jam with cars
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know these big four wheel four wheel four by fours with people drop off you know topsy and mopsy to go to school
S0013	mm
S0012	well yeah
S0008	and pick them up again and of cause in the in the afternoons they have like the infant class finish off half an hour before the you know the the the primary school
S0013	right
S0012	yeah yeah yeah
S0008	and so like there's cars park there for about an hour cos people get there really early to get a place to park
S0012	to get a place yeah
S0008	so they don't have to walk more than five yards
S0012	that's right
S0013	no
S0008	and er then they sort of the later ones who sort of stay behind for half an hour or whatever it be i don't know what's that all about but
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	but that road be chocker and and like those builder you know they've all ready take up you know fifty percent of all the available park
S0012	have they
S0008	and you know when they get you know the the brickies the plasterers the electricians the plumbers the tilers
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh yes yeah yeah wow
S0008	get the carpenter
S0012	yeah
S0008	everyone else there i mean each one of them will have a van weren't they
S0012	they will
S0008	and they'll have to park on the road
S0012	oh dear
S0013	so they should have put a road in first to get the a little way in
S0008	yeah but they'd have just load out block on that cos they
S0013	mm
S0008	they must have have about five lorry load of block and bricks and and er god know what
S0012	well what caw dear
S0008	i mean it's it's quite amaze it look like the look like the somme at the moment
S0012	yeah i bet it do yeah
S0008	cos of all the rain in there
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh
S0008	but that's really that's sort of silt you know good drain material
S0012	yeah
S0008	but the water table's so high
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	oh
S0008	huh
S0012	well they have get well that ain't far away from you really be it the water tower
S0008	that's right
S0012	so
S0008	so what
S0012	well they could they could pump more water in it
S0008	the water tower that's drink water
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah i dunno they'll come out right in the wash
S0012	well i suppose so
S0008	i suppose by this time next year they'll be people live there and all sort weren't there
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah kick ball over you fence
S0008	blimmin great fence up there and all my apple tree will be shade then
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh
S0008	so
S0012	they'll be snuff it
S0008	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	that face west no
S0008	well that be the sort of er south south west innit
S0012	south west yeah i think it be
S0008	it's er what the the direction all the sunlight come froms so
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	so they'll be cut up a load of sunlight from the garden
S0012	they will weren't they you'll be able to get some of the easterly stuff
S0008	i ought to get something there sometime you know but what the hell you know it's
S0013	mm
S0012	well funny enough this that our front garden face north that's
S0008	mm
S0012	completely dues north but early in the morning the sun rise over there so that get the sun first thing in the morning
S0008	oh
S0012	and last thing at night that that go down over there
S0008	mm mm
S0012	so that get
S0008	yeah
S0012	some sun in the afternoon
S0008	yeah yeah there's a bite like that at mine
S0013	mm
S0008	outside my backdoor window
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know sort of like it don't get much sun but
S0012	but it get sun
S0008	it get it in the mornings get it in the even
S0012	yeah
S0008	the alright but the trouble be be that if you have a fence to the
S0012	yes the sun be low innit yeah
S0008	to the what would that be if this be north and that's south so the sun be sort of come up round here it shade that bite there
S0012	that's right it's go to be shade yeah
S0008	so you've get a big strip
S0012	you've get a big strip that'll never get the sun yeah
S0008	that don't get any sun at all whereas the other side the north side it's get the sun
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	as it go round
S0012	yeah
S0008	never mind
S0012	so your poor apple tree can't can't you er complain and get compensation
S0008	yeah yeah i'm sure i could
S0012	see you miss out there you could have have ten thousand quid
S0008	yeah
S0013	what for an apple tree or for take them
S0012	well
S0008	well the do protect them
S0012	do he
S0008	well they haven't get protection on em but he do say they have to be protect
S0012	do he yeah
S0013	oh
S0008	so the thing be they be sort of plant on the line of the boundary
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	so they're actually grow into the other thing i mean not
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	i mean actually for the builders if they put the fence up they'll just put it straight down the easiest way they can weren't they
S0012	cause they will yeah
S0008	they won't go right to the boundary
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	i want to hope i hope not
S0013	no
S0008	otherwise they'll chop half the branch off the tree
S0012	they will weren't they
S0013	oh mm
S0008	to get to them
S0012	well they'll lose a bite of land there weren't they
S0008	i hope so
S0012	yeah
S0008	maybe i'll gain a bite
S0012	maybe you can
S0008	gain a six inch
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	that'll be no good cos that'll be totally devoid of any sun
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	huh
S0008	yeah anyway let's the sun be
S0013	right
S0008	i'll tell you what though if you've get let us have some of them pot
