S0517	why
S0571	because they they live on that's their home it's it's it's
S0517	oh oh okay
S0571	you know if you live on a residential park something's probably pretty much go wrong in your life i think
S0517	oh okay well they didn't live there before they get the job surely

S0517	a perk of the job live in a

S0517	mm
S0571	but he want to change the world and if you can imagine if in my side of the business that's fine because they're all quite like mind but he's deal with people that be a lot older
S0517	ah
S0571	have do the same thing for a long period of time and perhaps be not use to
S0517	be he enjoy it

S0517	do you not do not ask the i mean if i have somebody that be i'd have a lot of question like how many do they transplant do you need one can he have two be it greedy to ask for two on the transplant
S0517	like could you have two would you have to have two from the same person could you have one from
S0571	well
S0517	somebody and one from somebody else
S0571	you wouldn't have one from somebody else cos it's increase the amount the the risk of rejection isn't it
S0517	but you can live on one definitely
S0571	i use to have a friend i think that yes who have one kidney
S0517	so why do do we have two
S0571	well it's probably the body's way of
S0517	mm
S0571	er i mean the body have of sort of mechanisms that be to protect itself that's why we have eyelashes be to protect your eye so the
S0517	okay so you can donate your kidney while you're alive can't you yes because the architect's wife give him a kidney
S0571	yeah
S0517	so can people if they want to say oh i'll go and get test and i'll give a kidney
S0571	yeah yeah
S0517	well
S0571	i'd give him a kidney
S0517	i could probably live on one kidney
S0571	well shall we ask him
S0517	i dunno well should we i mean should we
S0571	could do couldn't we we'll give him a ring at some point
S0517	and say do you wanna kidney i dunno i mean how do that work i've never know anyone that need a transplant before like personally
S0571	might mean that you can't drink any more
S0517	well i'm not sure i could give a kidney
S0571	mm
S0517	yeah
S0571	be my friend who have one kidney he drink quite a bite
S0517	but that's awful but if you're if you're not gonna know be you if you're on the wait list and you're on dialysis and you don't get a kidney how long can you last
S0571	i don't know
S0517	why not

S0517	can you have stop it can you have dialysis indefinitely like if you have enough of it can you have it indefinitely i don't know
S0571	well i don't think so once your kidneys if you have complete kidney failure i don't think you you can survive
S0517	i don't really
S0571	unless you're plug up to
S0517	i don't even really understand what dialysis be
S0571	it well isn't it the process of er take the the do the function of the kidneys for a period of time
S0517	i don't know it's very sad though

S0571	yeah
S0517	so won't have a car

S0571	well could drop him at the station
S0517	what at half six in the morning yeah that'll go down well well i just wonder really because they buy that car
S0571	well if you desperately want that car so much
S0517	i know but they buy that car for didn't they or to use as he be learn and to pass but didn't 'll have to get a car
S0571	that'll take him that'll take him months to do won't it make a decision
S0517	that's a lot of decisions to be make mm my car do that thing again when i pull onto the out onto the you know when i i put my foot down but it didn't go
S0571	well what what do it do
S0517	it just labour a little bite and the i wonder whether my foot isn't quite long enough i think i need to put my like take my foot off the heel of the floor
S0517	and put my foot flat on the accelerator i wonder if it's me
S0571	well you need to find out and if it's not you need to take it back and say there's something wrong with the car don't you
S0517	mm but that's happen twice now do you know what well you be in the car weren't you that time it wasn't go but i think i think it might've be
S0571	well you tell me the you've never tell me that there's something wrong with the car
S0517	well you be in the car that time i be pull out and it be just like do a funny rev thing but it wouldn't like accelerate away i'm sure you be in the car it's do it twice now but i think i'm not put my foot cos my foot's not very long
S0517	have to lift my
S0571	if it's rev you've get your foot on the accelarator
S0517	well it wasn't really rev it it it be weird i can't quite describe just what but it certainly didn't pull away at speed which be what i need it to do and say what's go on with the car mum why didn't it just go and i say i dunno it didn't just go do it we pull out you know with it in quite a small gap
S0571	why don't you move the seat closer to the pedal
S0517	oh i could do pull out in quite a small gap and you know the oomph that we buy the car for wasn't there
S0571	well you you either need to take the car back
S0517	okay
S0571	cos you haven't have it
S0517	well it's only happen twice in like five months
S0571	yeah but you haven't have the car very long
S0517	no i know i know i know
S0571	so if if if you take it back now
S0517	it might be it might be user error i'll see
S0571	but if they if you take it back now it won't cost us anything if you
S0517	no
S0571	decide it's not user error in a few months it might cost us money
S0517	i don't know how to decide that though cos somebody else would get in that car they'll get to a junction they'll put their foot down and that car will go cos normally it do i'm not quite sure what i do anyway i'll keep you post but i do like when it just you know whoo
S0571	well if it doesn't go
S0517	nought to seventy in
S0571	i'm more worry it's gonna cost us money

S0571	they don't need to they don't need to
S0517	well what there's you can't get out the village any other way
S0571	you can you can go the back roads to to erm

S0517	it be a bargain
S0517	it's
S0517	it's a nice car though
S0517	it's a really nice car
S0517	it's a bargain to just be able to put your foot down and go
S0571	i'll carry on drive mine shall i

S0571	i'm sure they be
S0517	i go into i mean they be what fifteen pound down from whatever i go into cos they have a sale on and i try some gloves on and i think oh they're really nice they're really thermal line ninety pound
S0571	gloves be really really expensive and if you get good gloves they make a huge difference
S0517	well i'm not a professional skier but i think if i be i probably would spend but they be they be you could put you put them and they be really nice and warm and soft anyway i buy the fifteen pound ones which be still a bargain
S0571	so
S0517	and still thermal line and mostly why i buy them be cos they go with that ski jacket and trousers
S0571	excellent
S0517	whereas the purple gloves that i've get won't go
S0571	so you've already get gloves i know you'd be fuss about those purple gloves and go on and on about them
S0517	but they don't they don't go they don't go with the jacket so i've get new

S0517	mm
S0571	i've get one
S0517	do you you only get one
S0571	yeah thank for that
S0517	well i don't know then if it's more
S0571	it's not it's not about it's not about how intellectual you be it's about how you can
S0517	mm
S0571	communicate
S0517	i think
S0571	and he he can
S0517	he's better he's better he's not a great intellectual he's not gonna get fantastic grade but yes he can think on his feet
S0571	he can communicate
S0517	he can communicate
S0571	when i be his age
S0517	he's get an answer for everything he's quick witted and i think he will do fine but it's just find what he want to do
S0571	not if he go in to try and be a fireman he won't
S0517	no no no he won't i think he should maybe try his luck at sales no don't think so but that's what he's that's what he's good at he can talk no
S0571	it's not about it's not that that's not necessarily about sell though if if if if you're quick witted you're empathetic i i think he need
S0517	he's not empathetic he's quick witted he can think on his feet
S0571	i think he be i think he be quite empathetic i think he's really objective at time actually
S0517	do you
S0571	yeah there's be time when he's say i think that's and he he's bring things back from i i i think he's pretty good in in that sorta circumstance and er
S0517	so what would you what would you guide him towards
S0571	i think he need to go i i don't think he unfortunately i think he need to go into some sort of management role
S0517	but how how how
S0571	he need to choose a field i'd like i i wouldn't want him to go into service industries but i think that's where he's gonna end up
S0517	yeah i i i dunno
S0571	he's not gonna go into an area where you into a management he he's gonna be good in a management position but it's gonna be a management position that doesn't have a technical foundation to to the role so for instance
S0517	such as
S0571	er if you're look at bank if you're look at or or account so if you're look at an accountant and you you're not gonna be a erm
S0517	no the accountants have to get qualifications they have to take their accountancy exams
S0571	i'd think he's not go to be able to do that
S0517	no i know
S0571	because he hasn't get the academic skills to do that but you if you're in general management and make business decisions
S0517	mm
S0571	i think he could do that and i think he could manage people
S0517	yeah probably but how do you get him into that
S0571	well i'd be interest to see what he make of work with
S0517	well so would that that would just be that would be the one week you'd take him up there would you on the monday
S0571	no drop him with
S0517	leave him there
S0571	would take him up there
S0517	when
S0571	i'd ask to pick him up
S0517	well why couldn't you go up there settle in
S0571	he doesn't
S0517	per week no okay
S0571	he doesn't know there
S0517	well i mean a part of me think he'd still be a tennis coach he's think a part time fireman stroke tennis coach at the minute
S0571	have he tell you that
S0517	er no but this fireman thing he want to do be part time isn't it or like not regular oh i don't know we need to talk him out of that we do need to talk him out of that we'll ban chicago fire from the tv
S0571	do he do he know what he's gonna see do do he know
S0517	no course he doesn't course he doesn't he's sixteen how would he know that how would he know and also that guy that we meet in the summer that be a retire fireman tell him that they prefer people that be in their early twenties that have do other stuff get their qualifications or do a few job or whatever they didn't want people straight out of school
S0571	jesus a fireman
S0571	really
S0517	well i don't know he just hat study doesn't he he hat it
S0571	he hasn't do any of it
S0517	i know cos he hat it
S0571	his whole life be gonna be full of hate full of disappointment full of it's quite sad cos do he think work be gonna be any better than school
S0517	i don't know he doesn't appreciate that work's gonna be full time not much time off four weeks holiday a year nine to five no he doesn't know
S0571	it's gonna be nine to five
S0517	no it's not
S0571	because he's gonna be a a fireman who work nights days er

S0517	obviously
S0571	and i want to i my other ambition be always to have enough money that if i want to buy something i could go out and get it without have to worry about buy it
S0517	for instance like a thirty grand car for your mum
S0571	that be top my
S0572	what his mum
S0517	no your mum because she need it to pull out onto the
S0572	it didn't pull out today do it

S0572	we want
S0572	we want a new car we do fifty grand this time
