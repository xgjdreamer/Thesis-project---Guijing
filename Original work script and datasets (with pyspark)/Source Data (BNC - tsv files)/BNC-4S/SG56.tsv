S0261	yeah yeah
S0401	yeah yeah
S0261	great
S0261	do you have er wifi here
S0261	yeah
S0262	it's quite good that they've get wifi on
S0401	it's complicate
S0262	cos erm i be talk to a a a woman who's a business owner in erm last weekend and er i say oh i say do you offer wifi and she say oh no
S0401	who say that
S0262	business owner she's get her business off the grind so she's
S0388	so
S0262	get a café
S0388	do they oh
S0262	but and a cookery school no she's get a cookery school
S0401	what
S0262	she's put a café in the cookery school
S0401	right
S0262	and er i say oh be you gonna offer up wifi she say oh no i go what's
S0401	but everybody do it
S0262	what er she go we don't want somebody come in and have a cup of coffee and stay for four hours and not allow me to get more turnaround on turnover on my table and that's like but really i'm not like that
S0388	no
S0262	how many people
S0401	most people aren't
S0262	be actually like that
S0401	and if they be
S0262	you can ask them to move on
S0401	and you can yeah you just
S0388	yeah
S0262	yeah just say you have to
S0401	kick them out
S0262	yeah
S0261	just say
S0262	i say but
S0261	you know you for two hours
S0262	but wifi be for busy busy people on the go
S0261	business
S0262	who might have something to email off
S0261	yeah
S0388	yeah
S0262	might need to check something for
S0261	yeah
S0388	yeah
S0262	for whatever reason
S0261	come and have lunch there with their
S0262	yeah
S0261	rather than go somewhere else so i think it attract you
S0262	i think she's
S0388	and and wouldn't you wouldn't you have more wouldn't you
S0261	some
S0388	eat more and drink more
S0262	i would have think
S0261	people have no idea
S0262	i would have think you would
S0261	no idea
S0262	you would actually have more
S0388	yeah i would if there be
S0262	interest party
S0388	i would have think so
S0262	come along
S0388	you're more likely to have two cup of coffee than just the one
S0401	and people that be
S0388	if you're with the wifi
S0401	and people that be busy and in
S0262	yeah
S0401	in
S0262	and likely to be regulars come back
S0401	yeah
S0262	for whatever reason
S0388	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0262	seriously someone who's gonna be sit there for four hours nurse a cup of coffee won't be your regular
S0401	yeah i'd put in a fast
S0262	because she won't yeah
S0401	fast broadband
S0262	for
S0401	as well
S0262	yeah
S0401	so that it's
S0262	yeah so speed things up for everyone
S0261	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0388	yeah mm
S0262	but it's really odd
S0388	very odd think
S0262	how some café owners don't like the idea of offer wifi i think it's just that they're be a little bite on the erm
S0261	tight side
S0262	yeah
S0401	very tight
S0261	yeah but actually they need it for their business anyway
S0401	yeah
S0261	so it's just like it's no big deal
S0262	well i say i say that to her i say if you have a website with all your cookery erm if you have your recipes on your website
S0261	mm
S0262	for your cookery class
S0388	yes really
S0261	yeah
S0262	you can get them to join up
S0261	mm
S0262	to more class
S0388	class well yeah
S0262	while they're sit there have a drink you can actually give them some incentive to stay and actually have a drink as well have the wifi but she didn't no she doesn't buy into it
S0388	i think that's very short sight very short sight
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	i think it's the way to go
S0388	go it be yeah well how much do it cost then be it a lot of money to
S0262	be it a lot of money to have get erm wifi to offer wifi in a public area
S0261	no cos you're just broadcast it off your router so
S0262	right
S0261	no couple of hundred quid
S0262	what a year
S0261	well you pay for the connection anyway cos you're a business
S0262	oh
S0401	yeah
S0261	so you're gonna want your connection to run your business
S0262	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0388	what do what about confidentiality be there a problem with that then
S0261	oh you just
S0262	you've get to have it in your business
S0261	you can you can pay a provider to supply the service
S0262	cheer
S0261	or you can set it up so you're gonna need the it guy
S0401	cheer everybody
S0262	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0261	to do that
S0401	cheer
S0261	but you just set it up
S0262	chin chin
S0261	all up on a
S0261	separate thing
S0401	that's a nice long coffee
S0261	but you don't have a connect to your own personal
S0388	so so that wouldn't be a problem then the confidentiality bite then because that's not
S0401	well it's if people can break into it
S0388	cos you wonder
S0261	doesn't matter
S0388	if it's something to do with that and if if she be think about that
S0262	she didn't mention it if it be
S0388	no so it wasn't that then
S0262	she just say
S0261	she she just have a block
S0262	she doesn't want someone to sit there for four hours nurse that but i think for a businesswoman
S0401	not many people
S0261	well you just tell them to move on
S0388	that's what erm
S0262	well very she's quite she's quite an astute businesswoman
S0401	yeah but not
S0262	she hasn't quite get her head round that bite yet
S0401	no
S0388	how old be she
S0262	about younger than me
S0388	oh so she's not
S0262	something like thirty six thirty seven something like
S0388	you see i think maybe if she be my age i wouldn't have i you know
S0262	no no
S0388	might be a bite more reluctant
S0262	actually
S0401	no no
S0262	but you know much more than you know
S0388	so actually well well it'll be interest to see
S0262	if she come round
S0388	yes
S0262	yeah
S0388	or how long she last if she's
S0262	well that's the thing
S0401	oh there you be now

S0262	a light lunchtime
S0401	mm yeah it's a light
S0262	erm beer
S0401	yeah
S0262	doesn't really feel like it sort of taste like feel like you're drink beer in a way
S0261	mm
S0401	yeah mm
S0262	so your erm spanish teacher be she gonna continue with you when you get back to england or
S0261	who erm
S0262	or be it just in front of a
S0261	who
S0262	yeah
S0261	from peru
S0262	or or be it sorry
S0261	
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	i erm
S0262	so you teach her english and she teach you
S0261	yeah and and also i'm kind of be her erm sound board for her business thing
S0262	right
S0261	so so she erm like with spanish quite often you can just look at word
S0401	mm
S0261	and you'll know the mean of them by association with english word
S0401	yeah
S0261	that be what do you call them
S0262	false friends
S0261	false friends but they have
S0401	yeah
S0261	false friends
S0401	yeah
S0261	so and they're the ones that you think be the same but they're not
S0401	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	and they by take that approach you can get yourself in a bite of trouble
S0261	so so my friend make a little er youtube video
S0401	mm
S0261	of four minutes play off these different false friends against each other
S0401	uhu
S0261	you know
S0401	yeah
S0261	she's get quite a it's nice cos you see her character come out and she's quite playful about it all
S0401	yeah
S0261	yeah erm
S0262	have you show it to me yet
S0261	no no but i can show erm i can probably show you now erm so she be try to attract through linkedin erm business people who go to spain
S0401	mm
S0261	no go to south america
S0401	yeah
S0261	and erm so i think this week she be go to hold a just a online webinar for erm like six people
S0401	yeah
S0261	just to try them out
S0401	yeah
S0388	right
S0261	and then get their feedback and then see whether they would purchase any further service from her
S0388	right
S0261	or give her the feedback about you know how can she get improve her stuff
S0401	yeah
S0261	so she's make a start on that
S0388	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0261	it's kind of nice
S0388	where be she base then
S0261	she's in peru
S0388	oh right
S0261	yeah
S0388	oh
S0262	what's her internet connection like
S0261	alright we skype okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	wow
S0261	she's i mean peru's a bite city yeah erm then she's an it person anyway
S0262	right
S0388	so so how do you get to know her then
S0261	oh it's through the erm one of our online communities on a
S0388	oh online
S0261	on a foundation
S0401	mm
S0261	yeah
S0388	right mm
S0261	and she just kind of put out a shout say she be look for people who want to swap talk english for talk spanish
S0388	yeah
S0261	and want somebody obviously to to be a sound board for her business idea
S0388	mm
S0261	so i'm like i get free tuition
S0401	oh right
S0261	and she can get my feedback
S0401	yeah no that's excellent
S0262	so how do you teach her english then
S0261	well she can teach she can she can speak fairly good english but really all i do be correct her when she's use use the wrong tense or something like that
S0262	oh okay
S0388	so how do it go then she er she'll skype you
S0261	yeah
S0388	and then what she'll talk to you in english
S0261	yeah we usually start in english and just kind of say hi and all that kind of stuff and we've be experiment with some feedback from about some teach methods
S0388	oh right
S0261	and erm there be different ways to go all about it but erm she start off by just take some online resources where say you can basically follow some flashcards so we would be observe the same thing like she can share her screen with me and so i see what's be play and i can simply go through and and read and pronounce the different word and erm she initially be correct me as i go but put together a kind of a framework for a three day three day kind of thing where you start off just get familiar with
S0388	yeah
S0261	the
S0388	yeah
S0261	and then erm er you do and then pronunciation and then you try to to string kind of small sentence together and that kind of thing
S0388	right very good
S0261	so erm
S0262	so it's work out for you
S0261	yeah in part erm she still go too complex into like verbs and conjugations and all of that so rather than just let me give it a go even though i might be wrong
S0401	she still break in
S0261	she she try to break in and try to correct me and then we get lose down this rabbit hole of her explain to me why it's this verb and that verb and i'm like well actually i don't care at the moment because i think if i say this to you on the street you'd probably pick up kind of the mean about
S0401	mm
S0261	me be a tourist just kind of how
S0262	see the
S0261	what be my intentions
S0262	the thing about it be be that you you know you've get to er decide for the sympathetic native speaker would they be able to provide you with the mean behind what you be try to actually convey
S0401	mm
S0261	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0262	cos quite a lot of the time be stick be actually how you learn and pick up you know internalise a language
S0401	mm
S0262	if someone's try to tell you how to make it perfect from the start you're probably not gonna internalise it quite as much as you would if you be grapple
S0388	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0262	but once you've grapple and then secure it it's yours forever
S0388	yes
S0262	whereas if you're try to say something to someone at such a level an intellectual level of a language
S0401	mm
S0262	it's nice for about two second but after that it actually
S0401	your mind shut down a bite
S0262	doesn't stay with you
S0401	doesn't it
S0262	it doesn't stay with you it doesn't actually become part of you
S0388	mm
S0401	no
S0262	i think that's the only thing about learn a language be that the more mistake you make
S0401	yeah
S0262	the better language this person will be able to pick up
S0401	yeah
S0262	in a way as long as you be able to correct the mistake
S0401	yeah
S0262	and that's the beauty of it be that if somebody be there to help you so in a way
S0401	mm
S0262	she could just listen to you and anything that come out of your mouth she could either say thumb up or
S0388	thumb
S0262	not so good
S0401	yeah
S0262	or totally not the right word she doesn't actually have to speak she could just do sign language
S0401	mm
S0262	and then you can stop and go
S0401	oh
S0262	oh have i say something wrong and then you go through your mind and go oh yeah
S0401	yeah
S0262	i just use the wrong word when i want to use that one
S0401	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	so you learn to self correct
S0261	mm
S0262	that's that's another thing you do
S0401	yeah
S0262	and that take skill to get the teacher to know how to
S0401	yeah
S0261	well and that's what work
S0262	it's the learn space
S0261	that's work with me when i be work with who's the other student who's up in and she's try she's a teacher at school and she's try to learn english so she can teach english in a spanish school and erm so she get some
S0262	be that her the other day yeah
S0261	yeah she's get some teach skills and erm so we just try a very different approach which be simply we'd get on and i would try to explain what happen yesterday but i would try it in spanish
S0401	mm
S0261	so then it force me to start try to think through rather than just kind of rote repetition and not really try to associate
S0401	yeah
S0261	stuff i would start have a think through okay i wanna say that i go for a walk down here and i go for ten kilometres and then i go to go and see this thing and then i ask a question about i need to go the beach so i need to find directions and all of this you know
S0388	yeah
S0401	yeah
S0261	kind of practical stuff and i find that for me that be a lot better way of feel like you're gain confidence but also i think you do you're make more progress
S0401	yeah
S0262	i think so
S0261	mm
S0262	it's it's get to be quite a personal journey it's why everybody sit there learn a language together at the same grade
S0261	and people
S0262	doesn't work and that's why they shouldn't even bother do it like that at school
S0401	no
S0261	people
S0262	forget about it
S0261	people learn the quickest
S0262	it just doesn't
S0261	by
S0262	work
S0261	by do it and just try to
S0401	yeah
S0261	speak you know and you will adjust every day
S0262	you're better off go back to
S0261	as you go
S0262	the language laboratories where everyone have their own little kind of cubby hole
S0388	oh a cubicle yeah
S0401	yeah
S0262	yeah they could go at the pace they want they could
S0388	yeah
S0262	slow down when they didn't get something
S0388	yeah that be
S0401	yeah
S0388	quite good
S0262	they have someone click in and listen play back and say yeah yeah yeah or yeah yeah yeah no go back and do exercise those two again
S0401	mm
S0262	come back when you've do it
S0388	mm
S0262	and don't even have to from your seat
S0388	yeah they they don't do that anymore
S0401	yeah
S0388	so why do they stop that then
S0262	god know cos it be a very good efficient way because personalise learn a language
S0401	yeah
S0262	all of the top people who be like translators interpreters they be all very familiar with language labs
S0401	yeah
S0262	they've come up through language labs you see the russians that's all they do with them
S0401	yeah
S0262	they all that's that be how they learn english or any other language in russia they've get all the big language labs
S0401	mm
S0262	they haven't take them out
S0401	mm
S0262	not like we do
S0401	somebody come up with a new idea and think it would be cheaper and quicker and it's
S0262	well it's probably something to do with gcses and
S0388	well we diddle about with it
S0262	it's all about communication but
S0388	and we don't take the best from you just fiddle fiddle around it's people say it who aren't teachers you know
S0262	yeah
S0388	and that's what the you know they ought to be teachers right from scratch and then
S0262	yeah
S0388	get in those position to be able to say
S0262	yeah
S0388	what you can and can't do
S0262	yeah it's very rare to meet someone who's a
S0388	yeah
S0262	policy maker or quite a high up person
S0388	very very very very
S0262	who's have any kind of education background
S0401	well some
S0388	and that's what we've get to do and

S0262	and this be on the ridge that form the valley that run down the the dam
S0261	uhu okay be that on the uphill of the dam or the downhill
S0401	be you inside the dam or outside
S0261	yeah yeah
S0401	right
S0261	and how stable be the earth
S0261	yeah that's what i be think yeah
S0262	it's gonna be on two hundred and twenty pound sorry a hundred and twenty thousand pound a hundred and eighty
S0401	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	cos they know the owner why would that make any difference
S0261	it make a difference because
S0401	well they know what they'll accept
S0261	they know what they'll accept
S0262	ah
S0261	yeah
S0262	right
S0261	so it's on the market at two twenty
S0401	it's not a discount cos you're you're friends of a friend it's
S0261	mm
S0262	right yes okay
S0401	it's what they're they'd be will to
S0261	yeah and and they even pass comment on say and maybe they'd them too much
S0401	right
S0261	yeah so if you really want to push the envelope you could go i'll buy your place for a hundred and fifty
S0262	that
S0401	oh be you off to cyprus no
S0262	why not
S0261	why not
S0262	yeah no no i'm not cos i'm say i wanna go i'm just say what criteria would you say or which criteria would you say yes
S0261	oh because i don't really wanna buy a house for a hundred and fifty grand in cyprus at the moment
S0262	no that's a that's an emotive kind of reason but if i'm
S0261	mm
S0262	look at it as a business level would you say no
S0261	oh as a business plan
S0262	yeah
S0261	well i wouldn't say no until i'd do a lot more research erm
S0262	particularly if you're do an airbnb kind of type
S0261	but but
S0388	yeah
S0261	you know if if erm if it be in the right location that somebody could guarantee the land's right that there be no political reason why it might have some kind of problem in the future
S0401	mm
S0261	if if er
S0401	though
S0261	if the money's link up the right way without it be a problem then and if i can rent it out to millions of russians at two grand a two grand a week then why not
S0262	yeah exactly you can't rule anything out
S0261	no
S0262	until you've actually have a proper look at it
S0261	yeah so
S0262	you know cos you might be look at
S0401	i'd still go to france yeah cos you've get water
S0261	they've get what water

S0262	in cyprus why would why would they even consider that's the case he'd probably just be even more bamboozle than he already be
S0401	yeah
S0262	but you still think france be a good bet
S0401	i like france
S0262	yeah
S0401	and you've get easy land and
S0262	well you see the thing about cyprus be you'd have to live there
S0401	yeah you would
S0262	you couldn't do it as a second residence
S0401	no no no
S0262	it's too expensive
S0401	yeah
S0262	you have to fly to istanbul
S0401	what and then come back
S0262	and get a flight
S0401	yeah
S0262	into
S0401	yeah
S0262	into
S0388	well that's but

S0262	now how have they manage to live there for what twelve thirteen thirteen fourteen years
S0401	mm
S0262	but i guess maybe well he retire
S0401	yeah
S0262	and
S0388	yeah it must be
S0262	yeah maybe the standard of living's quite cheap out there
S0401	yeah and the other thing with france you've get the tgv if you if you're near within an hour of a tgv
S0262	yeah
S0401	get on that
S0262	you can get on that
S0401	you're straight up to

S0401	mm
S0262	yeah you're right yeah they
S0401	that's what i like about it
S0262	it be really easy access
S0261	it's easier to
S0401	yeah
S0261	get around
S0401	and
S0262	but even spain
S0401	it's green
S0262	you can argue be quite
S0262	easy access
S0261	yeah i think
S0388	i think so
S0401	oh it be
S0388	yeah
S0401	yeah yeah i do like green
S0388	i wonder what happen to my
S0401	hill and
S0388	mind if i have that one
S0401	still
S0388	thank
S0262	yeah you're right it's a it's a totally different you wouldn't be able to you'd have to live there
S0388	yes
S0262	to make a home there but then if you're somebody like where it doesn't really matter where you be you can be do online business and stuff like that then it's just a kind of a a question of taste and where you wanna live isn't it
S0401	mm
S0262	well maybe you should buy a place in spain and i'll place buy a place in cyprus
S0262	then we'll run them as airbnbs and then we'll swap over and
S0401	we'll just get off the plane one end and then
S0262	yeah
S0401	the other person get on it
S0261	mm mm
S0401	come back again
S0261	i reckon you can just rent a place there
S0401	well they be cheap
S0261	if you run your airbnb thing mm
S0401	yeah they be cheap here
S0261	yeah
S0401	how much do you charge then for airbnb to do it
S0261	it depend on where you be and how the market's go
S0401	yeah
S0261	the style or the
S0262	do you know what's
S0261	the niceness of your property and
S0401	mm
S0261	so on but
S0262	what's a bite dodgy though be that in spain they're not use they've be tell me that he have do it a couple of time
S0261	mm
S0262	when he's be here be that they will use the airbnb as a way to find each other
S0401	oh
S0262	to hook up
S0401	and then get off
S0262	as in can find somewhere to stay
S0261	and then you go offline after that
S0401	yeah yeah
S0261	and i'd do that
S0262	but you go offline so you're not gonna be rent bnb
S0388	oh
S0262	and if you be run and airbnb place it's probably quite good but still it's not help the run of airbnb in term of get people who be because people just go offline
S0401	well cos like yeah
S0261	because they're pay for two or three days
S0401	yeah it's good cos er
S0262	because they have to be to wanna be there
S0401	yeah
S0261	then i'd just cash out and it's a big thing
S0262	it's probably quite good but still it's not help the run of airbnb in term of get people who be because people just go offline
S0401	yeah
S0261	it's like
S0401	yeah
S0261	it be eighteen euros a night to stay in the place i be in in berlin this year
S0401	yeah
S0261	and when we take out their the er the other bite
S0401	yeah that's right
S0261	that's down to twelve so they be make thirty percent on the deal
S0401	yeah
S0388	yeah so what what yeah
S0261	cos they take fifteen percent off
S0401	gosh
S0388	yeah
S0261	off the
S0401	yeah yeah
S0261	off the vendor
S0401	yeah
S0261	and fifteen percent off the
S0401	so thirty percent
S0261	the renter
S0401	good god
S0262	so who win
S0261	so
S0262	the the owner win you win as a as a
S0261	well we both win so
S0401	yeah airbnb go out of business
S0261	the main thing about it be from my point of view i win a lot because there's a big drop in the cost from my point of view and the owner erm he win cos he doesn't have to pay the airbnb fee yeah and he doesn't mind you just pay him the normal rate
S0401	mm
S0261	cos he's get cash in hand
S0401	yeah so you're not pay
S0261	cash be king
S0401	tax on that
S0261	yeah doesn't go through any book
S0401	if you get tax on twenty percent or whatever
S0261	you know so
S0262	yeah
S0261	but you can our place in erm we be able to cover the cost of our rent per week
S0401	yeah
S0261	with it
S0401	yeah
S0261	and on big days we didn't charge it out though we charge two hundred buck a night for new year's and the days before and after
S0401	yeah
S0261	but we could have charge five hundred buck a night
S0262	easily
S0261	some people in sydney be do that
S0401	well yeah cos it's
S0261	new year
S0401	expensive city
S0261	ten minutes' walk down
S0401	yeah
S0261	fifteen minutes to walk to
S0401	yeah
S0261	to the bridge
S0262	yeah
S0401	yeah yeah
S0261	you know
S0262	be a good location for that airbnb
S0401	ferry cross
S0262	it's brilliant
S0401	yeah
S0261	anyway
S0262	we could have move out of there sublet i mean we get we get
S0261	oh i go for the
S0401	yeah
S0262	oh do you
S0261	yeah that's mine
S0401	oh oh sorry wrong way round yeah
S0261	get your hand off
S0401	sorry
S0262	i've just put sugar in there i sorry
S0261	oh that's the way it's gonna have to be
S0401	sorry it's my fault
S0261	i be wonder why i've get a really small cup i be think they're really tight here with their
S0261	you know
S0262	they're really
S0401	beg pardon
S0261	cor
S0388	i never get any
S0261	mm
S0262	but yeah we do it with this bnb thing we could have we could have genuinely could have if you'd erm move out there as a proper well i suppose so we could have just rent it out
S0388	yeah
S0262	or you could like walk down the coast come in every now and then and see the place when there's a change of but if you get people in for the you're really go to have do the place to get a get from it
S0388	to do it do the
S0262	to do it for you so she just
S0388	mm
S0262	but you know a lot of some bnb place do actually charge for clean fee cos they run it like that
S0388	like that yes
S0262	they run it as somebody who
S0388	so it's actually serious if you're think about it isn't it
S0262	well it's just because exactly and we saw how you could make
S0388	so what do you do in sydney the other do you
S0262	we have two bedrooms two bathrooms you stay in stay
S0388	yeah where we stay yes
S0262	what happen be be that erm in the end oh lovely towards the end of our stay i say to why don't we put our second bedroom on airbnb so you you meet all these wonderful people he wasn't work
S0388	mm
S0262	i'm work i can't pay for everything so yeah that help us just kind of keep a little bite afloat and then erm and then we both sit down and say yeah this could really work you can actually do this and like get a few properties do the same thing you could actually probably pretty much make it into a business if you be run a business you buy a property do it up then rent it out it's like anyone who's get a business but a difference be with airbnb you can choose when you're you can choose some things about how you check about who's come in or
S0388	so actually that would be yeah
S0262	there be businesses to be run i mean like okay say for some reason you're really on the back foot it's like there isn't any but that's the thing that you take a risk like that's the sort of thing i'd risk this person of if you can't afford a place
S0388	oh wow so you do breakfast and
S0262	mm
S0388	breakfast or
S0262	you do whatever they want like if they want breakfast you'd do it if they didn't want you wouldn't do it but actually and everybody be really great you know they treat the place with respect they come and you know really good
S0388	yeah well that be a good idea isn't it
S0262	yeah it be a good idea particularly if you've get a second bedroom
S0388	yeah
S0262	if you know money be
S0388	yeah
S0262	second bedroom so
S0388	might as well might as well yeah
S0262	they have their own one
S0388	yeah
S0262	we have the
S0388	yeah
S0401	nice or too sweet
S0261	it's alright i don't like the strength of those
S0401	no
S0261	so i prefer it with milk
S0401	right
S0261	i don't like the milk
S0401	ah
S0261	that's what i find out most of the time
S0401	right so why not just have a coffee with lot of sugar in it cut the strength of it
S0261	i don't like it too yeah
S0401	café americano
S0261	it get too full on
S0401	go for an americano
S0261	mm mm you know i'm concern i'll end up with the bloody filter coffee that taste like
S0401	mm a one of these it's like an extra
