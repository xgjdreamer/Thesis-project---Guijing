S0071	yeah actually superdrug's where we normally get it from
S0094	they didn't have any
S0071	they've probably cos they've put all their christmas stuff out
S0094	mm
S0071	you see how many shelve of things they have all those gift box and everything you think well what what do they have on their shelve before this
S0071	more stuff that you can't buy now
S0094	mm mm
S0071	and one year they'd move all their contact lens stuff and there be they'd reduce the whole range down to just a few and they didn't have the ones i need and i say to the assistant well where where's the rest of the contact lens stuff oh we have to get you know have to put away because of all the christmas things like well i i say
S0071	ridiculous
S0094	mm

S0071	an orange liqueur with
S0087	liqueury stuff and
S0071	it's get a zest of an orange and orange juice in it as well so
S0094	mm yeah maybe
S0071	i think i could do it in that round tin although our tin doesn't have that
S0094	oh yeah
S0071	kind of the shape but
S0094	oh well
S0071	hopefully it would still work so that's what we're gonna have

S0071	the geography department not do one
S0094	erm well they have do in the past they've have like postgrads and staff
S0071	oh right

S0094	yeah
S0071	you wouldn't go to one even
S0094	yeah he wouldn't be interest
S0071	i go to the work one
S0095	well it seem a bite odd cos there'll be load of people you don't know and like
S0094	well they might know each other if it's just for people round that
S0095	it's quite a tenuous connection somehow
S0071	yeah i suppose if you
S0094	no i think they do know each other some like a load of people that be think of go
S0095	they should call it the gang of people that know each other's christmas dinner
S0095	or something
S0094	but but she be send it out on her newsletter like like if anyone want to come
S0071	mm
S0094	like so it would've be quite a nice thing really
S0071	mm
S0094	but yeah
S0071	i be probably gonna do a nut roast for christmas dinner cos i normally do something with pastry and make a fancy thing and
S0094	oh right
S0071	normally like somebody's posh recipe that i find but this year i think i'm not gonna do pastry so i'm just go to where do i find the recipe oh it be er online it's smoke tofu pine nut
S0087	but it use a ready make
S0071	and it use a packet of ready make nut roast
S0087	nut roast
S0071	and cranberries that's the other thing
S0087	just add some extra stuff to the packet
S0071	add stuff to theirs use theirs as a base and add er add load of extra stuff
S0087	be the recipe by the people that make that nut roast
S0071	erm it's by people who
S0071	blog about them i think yeah
S0094	oh right
S0087	here's a present for you you can wear it as a badge
S0071	thank you
S0071	and erm
S0094	cos we have that recipe that we've make a couple of time like the one that we have in ireland with my sister that be really nice it's quite posh like
S0071	yeah
S0094	cos it's get tofu in it and it's suppose to have pine nut but we didn't put them in cos it's expensive but
S0071	well maybe it's the same recipe then
S0094	but it didn't involve a ready make nut roast
S0071	oh okay
S0087	well they're all pretty similar aren't they nut roast
S0071	this have get cranberries in but i really like a nut roast
S0094	yeah i do
S0071	this one you make in individual ramekins
S0094	oh right
S0071	so i'll make a number
S0094	mm
S0071	like to christmas dinner at your mum's
S0087	cos we'll have beef and turkey obviously
S0071	fake
S0087	vegan suitable
S0071	really natural conversation
S0087	i always have well you actually have that anyway even though if it's just you and me in the house and i say
S0071	i don't
S0087	oh can i have a bacon butty and you say
S0087	a vegan bacon butty well obviously
S0087	to you in regard to can i have milk in my tea don't you mean soya milk no er obviously i mean
S0071	er yeah so you'll be have that on christmas day and box day then
S0071	yeah i don't know what vegetables and stuff i could do yet
S0094	last time we have christmas on our own we just make everything and add bake bean to the whole lot as well
S0071	bake bean
S0094	randomly we have like pretty much everything in the house
S0094	in one massive like
S0087	what in one pan
S0094	no but the plate this and couldn't move afterwards and it keep us go we take it round then cos we go down to and we take like all these big tubs of stuff leave so when we go to people's house and they be like oh have some cold turkey we be like no we've get all this stuff
S0094	ah
S0071	gotta have sprout
S0094	yeah i'm not usually that keen but now we've find a way to cook them i like them
S0087	what coat in peanut butter
S0095	wasn't it that be many years ago we find that way
S0094	well it's better if you cook them
S0095	start say you like em now
S0094	well yeah maybe
S0071	ah
S0094	if you'd rather cook if you fry them in lemon and garlic then that's even better
S0071	oh right
S0087	that's almost like fry cabbage then
S0087	cos i really love fry cabbage and often with ginger and garlic
S0094	mm
S0087	and stuff so it's probably a bite like that
S0095	they basically be mini cabbage when you look at them
S0094	mm
S0071	mm
S0087	yeah white cabbage
S0071	the treehouse ones you like the ones in the treehouse cos they're still on the stick aren't they
S0094	oh on the stork yeah
S0087	yeah and you can do morris dance with them
S0094	there seem to be like a trend now like cos they're even sell them in lidl like that you can buy a stick like
S0087	oh that remind me like of the stick with my mum buy this for and she doesn't really
S0094	oh right
S0087	i be think we could keep it here anyway
S0071	no i just
S0087	as a as er a replacement for a tambourine
S0071	it just look like a baby's rattle
S0087	oh i like it now forget it
S0087	screw that
S0087	hello dolly be that father christmas come to bring you biscuits
S0071	so yeah i'm not that fuss about use that
S0094	it's not quite you can't bash it in the same way can you
S0087	you can't use it just purely for rhythm
S0071	it's just a bite erm
S0095	no there's no drum element be there
S0087	no
S0071	it's just a bite high pitch
S0094	yeah
S0071	there's something wrong about it
S0094	well the bell make quite a different sound to the little mini cymbally things don't they
S0071	cymbals
S0094	mm
S0071	yeah yeah
S0087	well they're not as good as a tambourine but
S0087	if you didn't have a tambourine right it's something that you can
S0094	yeah
S0087	pat against your thigh and
S0094	yeah we be ought to get a triangle i think for just like
S0087	yeah that'd be good
S0095	meow
S0087	yeah she'd prefer a triangle it's not as noisy
S0087	er i saw a game that you can get for the pc recently where you can it's like rocksmith but for any instrument it pick up the note from the microphones you can use it for a recorder
S0094	oh right
S0087	trumpet erm all sort of stuff
S0095	oh what's that call
S0087	ah can't remember the name of it it's when i be look at cos rocksmith for the pc be reduce this week so i end up buy it on the pc
S0071	oh right
S0087	so i can then play the same game it'll pick up what i'm do on the the electric guitar
S0094	oh so you oh so you can just set up a button on the computer and do it
S0087	and it'll give me the note like in rock band
S0094	yeah cool
S0087	erm but i can do it on my pc to the
S0094	yeah
S0087	instead of always be stick here with noise
S0087	erm i could then have it rest on my knee
S0071	do you notice your shoulder be ache again
S0087	yeah i've have a bite of back stuff
S0094	mm yeah
S0087	if it's it could just as easily be my posture on the chair
S0094	mm
S0087	cos i do different things with the leave and the right hand
S0071	yeah
S0087	obviously
S0071	do you always move your mouse er change
S0087	no i leave it still and control the game with the power of my thoughts
S0071	no do you move the mouse from side to right to leave on different days or anything
S0087	er i do use er i move it to the leave today but that's a rarity at home i normally use my right hand for the mouse
S0071	but that's your leave shoulder that you be say you've get pain in
S0087	yes
S0071	mm
S0094	mm
S0071	so it's not so much
S0087	but it could still be posture
S0071	mm
S0087	so
S0087	yeah er but it's only
S0094	mm
S0087	i think oh go on then
S0094	can you use the mouse with both hand then do you use
S0071	yeah in work i have it on my leave
S0094	oh wow
S0095	same here
S0071	and it's just a normal mouse in work i just move it to the other side
S0094	yeah
S0071	cos you can get leave hand mice
S0094	yeah
S0071	erm
S0087	well or you just reverse the button
S0094	just so
S0071	yeah other people have say when they've say to me oh they get er rsi they just move your mouse and they say i can't they can't adapt their brain and
S0094	yeah i'm not that ambidextrous i expect i could if i practise i suppose
S0071	yeah
S0094	it's just that initial frustration of be slow and stuff
S0087	yeah if it's just general windows use you generally er you move around a bite
S0094	much anyway do you
S0087	that's it you're use keyboard a lot
S0094	yeah
S0087	cos you either type or
S0071	yeah
S0087	the scroll wheel
S0094	yeah scroll wheel
S0087	and you can use page page down if it's on a web page
S0087	so you i tend to find that i also learn a lot more keyboard shortcuts so there be
S0094	yeah i'm not that good at erm shortcuts
S0087	erm
S0071	i don't use many either
S0087	no but it become second nature
S0071	yeah
S0087	so even in outlook i can switch between my contact and my calendar and all that
S0071	oh right
S0087	i don't normally use the mouse for that
S0071	mm
S0087	erm the icons from windows xpl windows seven and like for the icons of whatever you've pin to the taskbar they all get the number one two three four five if it's invisible you don't know but if you press the windows key and two it will activate the second thing you've pin
S0087	erm so that save a lot of mouse work especially if the mouse be up there
S0087	to click on program you don't have to bother with them
S0094	do i tell you about when talktalk like erm i nearly get scammed
S0071	what on the phone or
S0094	yeah there be at home like still like in the in the morning i think i'd like start something the night before and think oh i'll finish this here and then i'll go in the office
S0087	ah that piss me off
S0094	but it be talktalk or so they say and it be like from a call centre in india which you think well yeah that figure
S0087	so be you with talktalk ah
S0094	yeah yeah so they be like oh yeah some erm you're get load of rubbish like download to all these things be happen whenever you go online it's really bad erm we need to try and sort it out on your computer and i be like hang on a minute who be you
S0071	mm
S0094	you haven't give me any id or anything like this so they be like oh yes erm well your address be this and you're this person aren't you and erm this be your talktalk account number blah blah blah they know all of that so
S0071	mm
S0094	and then like erm
S0087	they want you to download something or click on a link
S0094	yeah they want me to run a program
S0071	mm
S0094	what's i keep ask what be this gonna do to my computer when i've do it
S0094	so i be like okay i've gotta go erm but but then i look up on talktalk website afterwards
S0071	yeah
S0094	and it be a scam like totally they they er remote control your computer then
S0087	yeah
S0094	erm
S0087	if you've get a certain version of windows on your
S0071	oh my god that's really bad they manage to hack into talktalk's account then or something
S0094	well er talktalk haven't respond properly
S0071	oh
S0094	to farm the data out to somebody else i expect
S0087	mm
S0071	somebody just siphon it off
S0094	probably
S0071	for a payment
S0094	i reckon that's what happen
S0071	mm
S0087	that's the same scam but less obvious be when they ring up and say this be the microsoft support department
S0094	oh right
S0071	my mum get that a lot she get phone up by microsoft
S0094	as if microsoft would phone you up
S0087	exactly
S0094	like if you ever give microsoft your phone number anyway
S0071	i know
S0087	i normally spend age talk to em i'll ask em things like
S0087	windows i think this be more a critical error than
S0087	and say well hold on but surely i think that that weakness in the structure be fix if you run mscdxe but with a slash h config file because i do that every day surely they be
S0087	get really fluster and and i'm like you know yeah also hot fix two point three er you know they should override that but tell you what if you can do it on your computer and tell me what you see when you type this in and then start give them all sort of shit
S0087	but it's you've get the patience to do that
S0071	it's normally a dead giveaway
S0094	oh right yeah
S0071	cos somehow on some database somebody register this house or this number as
S0094	yeah
S0071	so they if they ask for we know it's a scam
S0087	i think that it's just it's come from you and cos it's a man answer they ask be that
S0071	no it's not come from me i
S0087	cos i'm not i'm obviously not
S0087	so they just say be that mr cos the only name they've get be yours cos you're the one
S0071	yeah but they ask for
S0087	no no they don't ask for they they just say be that because that it's a man speak cos i've i've pick up the phone i've say hello they're not gonna say be that so they so and they only know that the name be connect with this residence
S0071	they don't know they they know they never ask for they only ask for mr
S0095	do they only ask you for
S0071	i can't remember now i'm confuse
S0095	because if they don't then 's hypothesis seem like quite
S0071	yeah
S0087	i'm pretty sure cos it er it's only that's all they've get the
S0071	i'm in the phonebook yeah
S0087	yeah that's what i mean
S0094	be you
S0087	so they've get the name and the the phone number and everything
S0071	yeah
S0094	that's brave
S0071	i don't think that make any difference i do it because if people want to contact me for my yoga teach
S0094	oh right yeah
S0087	but they can get that off the website
S0071	not everybody have access to the internet digital divide it's real
S0087	well we've gotta keep them out
S0071	so erm
S0095	who doesn't have access to the internet these days
S0071	a lot of people
S0094	it's true like well old people don't want access to the internet
S0071	twenty percent
S0094	no but they don't want to they don't understand it
S0071	or what if you want to ring up er what if you want to find out tonight if there's yoga on tomorrow
S0094	yeah
S0071	you can't go to the library
S0094	you'll not go to the library for that
S0095	true true enough
S0071	erm it's it's about twenty percent of the population that don't have access to the internet
S0087	post about it last week
S0095	what about people that don't have a phone then
S0071	that's about three percent of the population
S0087	but my mum's get a phone but she doesn't use the internet on it
S0071	in fact it's probably even less now the population that don't have access to a phone use to be only like a few percent but
S0094	yeah
S0087	phone have internet access now don't they
S0071	mm
S0094	cos there's now like a campaign to get like cos you know you have to pay for the landline rental and everything
S0071	mm
S0094	for bt or whoever erm but most people be just people be now they're so use to be just use their mobiles and the internet and never use a landline
S0071	yeah
S0094	they're like why be we pay for this
S0071	oh dear not happy with the conversation
S0094	meow meow
