S0525	you wanna ask me about whether you can buy property with a pension
S0641	yes yeah so if you're pay into a property i mean you pay into a pension can you can you purchase personal property as well oppose or just have to be for commercial use only
S0525	i don't know i think if it be personal property you have to you be yeah i think it have to be tie into the business somehow if it be through a through a business pension yeah i think so i'm not sure they change the rule all the time and i've be out of it a long time now
S0641	yeah so be you gonna start contribute
S0617	yes i be indeed
S0525	well you should be save in a pension
S0617	yeah i will
S0525	well you you should like i say you should
S0617	might as well
S0525	you should find out if it's link to them put you in a percentage of what you put in
S0641	there might be a good scheme and they might obviously not match it but they might
S0525	mm
S0641	contribute quite a little
S0525	mm
S0641	or at least an amount
S0525	they might do yeah yeah but then for i forget the reason why we decide not to buy our property cos erm oh because erm well properties be go down weren't they and they weren't sell so we think we'd carry on rent our
S0617	mm
S0525	our business property but of course if you then if you've get a pension pot so if you and you know and you the business or whatever you if you've build up a pension pot and you decide to buy a property the property then have to pay rent to the pension pot so the pension pot
S0641	oh okay
S0525	so the pension pot be make money because you're charge rental and and you're set that rental
S0641	so you're better to rent it out to you yourself
S0525	yeah
S0617	mm yeah
S0525	but but you're get money back into a pension pot
S0641	do do you purchase the er property in the end
S0525	we didn't do it in the end no no
S0641	so be it still rent now
S0525	yeah mm mm
S0617	it be rent
S0641	and be
S0525	it's rent it's rent off erm i think rent the ones er up at up there on avenue
S0641	must be a lot of money go out for that if it's so expensive
S0525	well
S0617	how much be it a month mum
S0525	how it's about thirty grand a year thirty thirty six thousand a year the rental on that property and then you've get your rat on
S0617	it's how much that a month
S0525	you've get your rat on top of that
S0617	about three grand a month
S0525	mm mm
S0641	pretty much and er at the rate what be the rat on that property be they quite high
S0525	yeah i think they be up to about about fifty odd just over fifty a year with the rent and rat
S0641	oh
S0525	mm yeah
S0617	crazy
S0525	but then
S0641	cos we get we pay zero percent rat because of the size of the unit and it's
S0525	mm
S0641	i think there be a erm
S0525	that's good
S0641	i think it's a tax relief from the government and it's be in place for maybe six years now
S0525	yeah well that that's good you've gotta take advantage of anything you know you you can get with be a small business
S0641	definitely
S0525	and there be
S0641	and we're look for we're gonna look into move out in the next maybe two months to
S0525	mm mm
S0641	a larger unit so we need to kind of
S0525	oh really
S0641	look at the threshold of
S0525	excellent yes yeah
S0641	there's not just a set amount it doesn't just match up base on size do it there's more to it it's about the rateable valual value
S0525	mm
S0641	of the property
S0525	mm mm
S0641	so it's it's not always
S0525	yeah
S0641	that clear to finance it
S0525	no no and anything's more expensive for businesses as well
S0641	yeah burn our lasagne
S0525	ours

S0617	well me and have say mum like i say to you we're not go in the holiday
S0525	no no well er er none none of us have to go on holiday
S0641	if it be like an extra twenty thirty forty pound we'd do it of course but
S0525	but not if it no no
S0641	if it be extravagant i think
S0525	i well we all we're all completely agree on that and so be and her only problem now which i can understand be if it be just her and and me and but the fact that and be go and the boys'll wanna go i i can understand that
S0641	yes
S0525	so i say to her well you either skive a couple of days off school cos it'll only be a thursday and a friday and she be think about that wasn't she
S0617	yeah

S0617	cos we be just gonna go from
S0525	so
S0617	wednesday night
S0525	yeah
S0617	to sunday night
S0525	so she'll need to make a decision on on whether cos an extra four people's a big so
S0617	yeah
S0525	we need to have a think
S0617	cos if we have more people
S0525	so i i
S0617	the airbnb surely it's gonna be better cos we be look and the one that
S0525	that be you know the one you find be that for ten people or eight people that be good
S0641	yeah i think so
S0525	mm
S0641	i think it be maybe four bedrooms would sleep ten maybe
S0525	yeah that that would be really good wouldn't it
S0641	well i i think that that's probably fine in er
S0525	mm
S0641	share a room in there like a bunk bed or something
S0525	mm yeah yeah
S0617	four i'm sure we'd need five one
S0525	one two
S0617	two
S0525	possibly five yeah
S0641	yeah maybe yeah i'm not i'm not sure
S0525	but but yeah
S0641	something like that
S0525	yeah yeah yeah that that would be good
S0641	it be only briefly i we i haven't look into it
S0525	mm
S0641	erm it might be twenty five miles out of the centre
S0525	or yeah cos the other thing be yeah be it close enough for us to do the what we wanna do and yeah
S0641	i assume so i i'm not a hundred percent which
S0617	but the thing be it's so expensive in reykjavik mum we be even
S0525	i know
S0617	say like maybe
S0525	mm
S0617	we would go a little bite further out but because we've get cars we can drive
S0525	well i i yeah absolutely
S0617	cos we obviously
S0525	mm
S0617	wanna stay in a really nice house don't we
S0525	that that would be lovely and then as long as there's supermarkets we can buy food like you say we've get our breakfast we've get our even meal we've get everything we need to to cook then that's erm we maybe go out one night but the rest of the time we can eat in can't we
S0641	yeah best of both
S0525	especially if we've get the pool the swim pool be lovely i mean you've get something like that

S0641	yeah
S0525	right have it get have it get vat on it

S0525	registration plat have vat under there okay so it's gonna actually be your car
S0641	yes i i've i've buy one maybe about two weeks ago
S0525	yeah
S0641	it's a fifteen plate reg
S0525	what oh what's the well what what have you get
S0641	i've get
S0525	oh
S0641	and then
S0525	oh
S0641	the
S0641	yeah it's quite fancy
S0617	and then space
S0525	excellent
S0641	yeah
S0525	oh nice
S0641	so it be fancy
S0617	show mum
S0525	oh nice
S0641	i'll show you
S0525	let's have a look
S0641	it's it's it's a fifteen plate though so it only come out like a few months ago so i think
S0525	yeah
S0641	i'm gonna whisk
S0525	right
S0641	and grab it quickly before it go
S0525	i i'm not entirely sure erm i would say if it be go on on a car that be own by the company i would say a hundred percent yes
S0641	yeah
S0525	this be go on your car however your car be use for business
S0641	but it won't be go on this it it can't go on this car
S0525	oh it's not go on this car
S0641	no
S0525	oh i see so it's it's for a future car
S0641	yes
S0525	oh well in that
S0617	future business car
S0525	well in that case yes yes because if this be gonna go on a car because you could have every intention now of purchase the next car through the company
S0641	and and which which probably be the case like
S0525	mm mm
S0641	er genuinely
S0525	in that case erm yes
S0641	don't see why not
S0525	yeah
S0641	and the next one how about er gym equipment
S0525	gym equipment yeah
S0641	yes
S0525	okay well hang we can we can deal with gym equipment so you're buy gym equipment be it gonna go on the premise at work or it's gonna go in your house
S0641	not now it's not
S0525	not now
S0641	it's gonna go in my garage but in the in the future
S0617	but cos
S0525	in the future
S0641	unit maybe
S0525	well
S0641	for the employees
S0525	yeah and and for the purpose of should anybody be erm look to check where it be it could be in the company it could be in the warehouse use at lunchtime by the employees
S0641	but our erm our business registration isn't the business anyway it's 's house
S0525	right
S0641	so
S0525	mm
S0641	i could just
S0525	so for the sake of the business yeah i mean yeah
S0641	i could just change the company register to my house if i want to
S0525	we have erm we have plat and row machine and various things we'd purchase over the years
S0525	that go through mm yeah yeah put it through
S0641	cool cos between them it's quite a substantial amount it's er would definitely
S0525	yeah how much be that registration cost you
S0641	it cost eight hundred which i think be a bargain because
S0617	it be really good
S0525	a bargain
S0641	well there's similar at literally five
S0525	thousand
S0641	to fifty thousand
S0525	something
S0641	yeah
S0525	mm
S0641	erm
S0525	they that's a very good one actually for for you isn't it
S0641	yeah it's
S0617	not the one i
S0525	you've er oh yeah yeah that'd be good how much be that
S0617	two grand
S0525	i don't see how i i've never you you ask me didn't you a while ago what i think i say well
S0641	yeah
S0525	to me it's never appeal because if you cut somebody up
S0617	yeah
S0525	that's that be
S0617	it's cool isn't it
S0525	yeah
S0641	so that's quite er
S0525	yeah
S0641	recognisable
S0525	yeah
S0641	and because it's a fifteen plate
S0525	but the only thing you've get on extra be be the extra s really
S0617	yeah
S0641	yeah yeah
S0525	but erm but yeah
S0617	it's cool
S0525	but you've you've always say to me do i fancy it i say no you cut somebody up they're gonna know who's do that
S0641	yes that's
S0525	they're gonna remember that
S0641	that be that be
S0525	yeah oh i remember that plate when it come past again
S0641	but because it's a fifteen plate it can only go on cars that be fifteen or newer
S0525	oh how do you know it's a fifteen plate
S0525	oh
S0617	that's a fifteen plate
S0525	i see
S0641	erm
S0525	oh so you can't put that on a car i didn't realise that
S0641	mm
S0525	even if it's a personalise plate you can't just put that on any car you want
S0641	no no it have to
S0617	no cos you
S0641	the car have to be
S0617	cos you'd you'd put a plate that be brand new on wouldn't you if you could
S0525	oh i oh i
S0617	so your car look brand new
S0525	oh right i hadn't think about that
S0641	so that's why it's quite cheaper than it should be because it's probably not available to that many people because they wouldn't be able to go on the vehicle
S0525	oh but you're
S0641	so i think it
S0525	buy it as an investment for the future car
S0641	i think it will appreciate i think it will
S0525	good good for you good idea
S0641	cos there's very similar ones they're absolutely
S0525	yeah
S0641	thousands and thousands
S0525	no no i think it's a good idea and i think in that case yes cos it's gonna be for the business do we come up with any answer on those plat of mine that be in the back of the car you you be google something weren't you about that what
S0641	yes er
S0525	do we get anywhere with that i bet that pasty's burn now
S0641	i think it ask for me some for some information that i didn't have
S0525	that we didn't have
S0641	mm
S0525	right oh i i'd forget it's it's just make me think about it now say that but
S0641	i think more than likely they're just the plate as oppose to
S0525	we can't
S0641	i think i think it's just a bite of plastic
S0525	we can't sell those plat it's not
S0641	no
S0525	no
S0641	i think you'd need the document i have a document that i've receive for my plate i haven't actually get
S0525	oh right
S0641	any physical plastic
S0525	right okay
S0641	so i think more than likely for me it's just the plastic they've leave in there dunno why they would leave them in there though
S0525	no we didn't well it's it's it be personal to the car rather than her wasn't it cos it be
S0641	mm
S0525	something something on the end of it so erm yeah
S0617	put mum
S0641	but the reg have to be erm have to be transfer to an individual oppose to a car so it obviously do it do get designate to a car but because your car's get the plate it have now
S0525	yeah it go back to the original plate it be
S0641	the the
S0525	register with
S0641	private reg would have have to be transfer to you as an individual and if that wasn't
S0525	right
S0641	then they wouldn't of
S0525	yes i wonder why they be no no cos they i didn't want them they ask me
S0641	mm
S0525	there be an extra charge i didn't want a a a plate like doesn't interest me
S0641	no
S0525	this whole personalise but you've always like it
S0525	as well haven't you but
S0641	it's
S0617	mine's a one's load it's more expensive
S0525	and and to be and and your dad have yeah say oh yeah yeah he'd have a personalise plate yeah
S0617	mine's expensive though two grand for mine to keep it
S0641	and it's it's not as i don't think it stand out as much as that's why i be quite
S0617	well yeah
S0525	yeah it's a good one
S0617	that's pretty good
S0641	that be good that be good
S0525	oh
S0617	so twenty one my birthday
S0525	it's mm
S0641	oh right i didn't i didn't realise the twenty one
S0525	what's the r for
S0617	that's the twenty one
S0525	oh
S0641	yeah
S0525	come on
S0641	but it's a
S0617	's be
S0641	but
S0525	that's only personal it doesn't
S0641	i be gonna say without put her down put it down
S0525	yeah
S0641	i wouldn't know that
S0525	no
S0641	no one would know that apart from maybe
S0525	no and that wouldn't have cost
S0641	a handful of people
S0525	an awful lot i wouldn't have think to get something like that
S0617	it cost her about two grand
S0641	no
S0525	what
S0641	it wouldn't
S0617	cos that's what i'm look at
S0525	they
S0617	for mine
S0525	they wouldn't have cost that
S0641	what's hers say
S0525	hers be
S0525	no no that wouldn't have cost anywhere near that
S0641	no cos it's cos it's
S0525	it doesn't say anything
S0641	no
S0525	yours do say
S0617	mm
S0641	to to me that just say
S0525	yeah yeah it doesn't say anything that would not have cost anywhere near that
S0617	oh

S0617	but the thing be that i
S0525	no no
S0617	i haven't even get there's not a

S0641	we'll see
S0525	not really
S0617	exactly so we've gotta go to london

S0641	that one be about quarter past eleven that one be
S0525	at night
S0641	in the morning
S0525	oh in the morning mm so it's another day
S0622	be this iceland again
S0641	mm
S0617	yes dad
S0525	she she's she won't get the time off will she she's not have a single day
S0641	i don't think they'll fly on a wednesday
S0617	no
S0641	from birmingham
S0617	no there's and there's no direct flight like you say they'd take like fourteen hours stop off at copenhagen
S0525	oh right well that's no good
S0641	copenhagen
S0525	that's no good
S0617	yeah
S0641	isn't it
S0525	like to manchester or anything
S0617	no it isn't copenhagen's the same way as iceland
S0525	denmark yeah you're go up a bite
S0622	yes well
S0525	mm your pasty's cook it's in the
S0622	oh thank you
S0641	yes i i think london be the er only
S0525	the best one
S0641	our only option really
S0617	can't go from birmingham mum
S0525	you've get why can't you cos it's too cos of the stop
S0617	yeah
S0525	or
S0617	you'd have to do a stop and it's also more money
S0525	mm right
S0617	and they don't actually fly wednesday to sunday
S0641	so these be the er so it would be a wednesday to a sunday
S0525	could you get a wednesday even though cos i'm think 's gotta be at school
S0641	i think so so it would have to be a late
S0525	well yeah wouldn't it that's the thing have to get down there and then you're in the rush hour traffic
S0641	eleven twenty
S0525	the other option be you know we don't all have to go out on the same day if it doesn't suit you if you want to get if you want to get an early morning flight you haven't all get to wait for the late flight you know you two or we could go over there do a supermarket shop and stock up they could get there later either the we we haven't get to do the
S0641	yeah yeah i to to be honest
S0525	because you know if if some of us have go out there and and
S0617	it doesn't what what it doesn't go any later do it
S0525	if we if we'd go out there and make
S0617	mum it doesn't go any later
S0525	oh it doesn't go later
S0641	it would have to be the follow day
S0525	have to be the follow day for them which they could do you know if if that's all 's leave with we could go out the day before stock up with food so at least you've do a bite of a shop and you've get
S0641	they'd still get
S0525	do you know what i mean you've get stuff in
S0617	mm
S0641	all day thursday
S0525	well
S0641	i mean it wouldn't half day thursday

S0641	mm
S0525	we'd have to ask her that but they're they're gonna be quite strict aren't they the school time but that's a good price isn't it

S0617	we've move on and we're not talk about it anymore
S0525	she's move on
S0622	oh right
S0525	be you get on okay with her
S0622	okay
S0525	be she
S0617	yeah we have this conversation earlier you ask me i've tell her
S0525	well that be yesterday i'm just wonder about today
S0617	i've not be in
S0525	oh no
S0525	very true
S0622	it's be a good day then
S0641	yeah
S0525	have erm a text from the police earlier
S0641	oh do you
S0622	oh right
S0525	oh hang have you not tell anybody
S0617	no i forget to tell you
S0525	well announce it now
S0622	announce
S0525	do tell
S0617	just that they find that woman
S0641	really
S0622	right
S0641	that's good news
S0525	yeah i think so
S0622	yes
S0641	or be that a bite of an
S0622	do that
S0641	bite of an inconvenience for you be it
S0617	dunno really
S0641	do you have to go to court and stuff now and all that
S0525	well i say yeah but they've say the text say that what they've arrest and charge somebody follow the report give so by obviously by it doesn't mention but and by the other person and somebody else give a report as well
S0641	yeah
S0525	so i i'm imagine if she plead guilty end of story
S0641	mm
S0525	but i'm think if she doesn't plead guilty that's when they might be call upon and whoever else give statements to go to court
S0622	yes
S0525	would you expect that
S0641	what would the charge be do you think
S0617	police jail
S0641	yeah not
S0525	police
S0641	yes
S0525	but be they be they charge it as burglary or aggravate er assault or attempt assault or
S0641	it would be more than likely be magistrates wouldn't it and like community service and stuff
S0525	i i yeah well you say that the police say though she would go to jail if they catch her
S0641	really
S0617	that's what they tell me
S0525	well it's i suppose
S0617	cos she's do it on
S0525	it depend if she's get
S0617	countless time
S0525	how how do they know she's do it
S0622	yeah she's probably well know
S0525	how do they know that do they know who she be then
S0617	well cos she do it in the high street store the other and then
S0525	yeah but that be on the same day
S0641	that be still within the same day
S0525	so
S0617	no it wasn't the same day
S0641	oh be it not
S0525	oh she's
S0617	no she be do it on various occasion
S0622	oh really oh right
S0641	oh so they do know her
S0617	yeah
S0525	they have catch her before then they've obviously convict her
S0617	no no no no no they haven't catch her before but they know that she's
S0641	how do they know who she be then if she's never be catch
S0617	because they've get cctv on the other store so she's do it from the high street like a week before us and then come in and do it with us
S0525	well a week before so we're talk about have she get a history from
S0617	oh right
S0525	the year before six months before she'd be convict before now
S0617	oh i don't know
S0525	that's what we're say that's what give you a record
S0617	oh i don't know
S0525	so if she's be if she hasn't be convict before
S0617	yeah
S0525	this this be her first offence they've actually charge her with then
S0617	he tell me she's do it on numerous occasion so if she get catch now then she's go to prison
S0622	right
S0641	so how do so they do know who she be then
S0617	i guess so then if he say that to me yeah that's what the policeman say to me
S0641	oh
S0622	well she's probably
S0525	okay
S0622	be caution or something before and they
S0525	yeah
S0641	yeah
S0525	yeah they must have recognise her from the cctv
S0641	they must her on file
S0622	so she's on bail and therefore if she do it
S0641	mm
S0622	she's gonna
S0525	right so i suppose it it depend now whether she plead guilty or not
S0617	yeah
S0622	it'll be difficult for not not to really isn't it because she
S0617	we've get picture of her
S0622	there's picture of her and descriptions and all sort so
S0525	that's what i think yeah they've get quite a lot of evidence that you'd be stupid not to plead guilty because if she plead not guilty and get find guilty the sentence'll be
S0622	greater
S0525	harsher so i'm think if they've get all the information stack and she's get an actual and she'll just plead guilty and try and get off with a a lighter sentence
S0622	mm
S0617	and then she'll come out and try and find me
S0525	well no not if she not if you don't have to testify
S0617	she will
S0525	not if you haven't gotta testify
S0622	but it's not just you
S0617	yeah but if if i go to prison if if i go to erm
S0617	court whatever and have to sit there and watch her she then know again what i look like
S0525	yes
S0617	and she'll she they they probably do come and find you then don't they
S0525	well
S0641	and do what
S0617	or like you say that she's get friends of friends in the audience
S0525	we've watch a bite too much erm
S0617	that'll come and find me
S0525	the bill
S0617	that's what mum say
S0525	the
S0617	she'll have friends of friends in the audience
S0525	no i say that er in the audience
S0641	as your mum scar you
S0525	like you you say they i say i say that's always a risk i say cos we've watch a lot of crime program but this be petty theft and she might not bother and she might not have friends
S0617	but if she do bother and come back
S0525	or but the the thing i also say
S0617	follow me to the train station
S0525	the thing i also say to you be you don't have to go to court they can't make you go to court you can say i'm not go and you can say to the police look it you know you you can say be this conviction dependent on me come to court have you get enough evidence without me because i really don't want to do it you know you you can
S0622	mm
S0525	they can't make you nobody can make you that now be your choice even though they ask you and you say you'd be will you're not bind by that
S0617	no
S0525	so let's see what happen
S0641	i guess the difference be they'll do her for theft regardless i guess it's for the assault that they would need
S0525	yes
S0641	to
S0525	yes mm mm if they've get something on cctv show she be assault or attempt to assault you
S0641	they'll probably need a statement from you then or maybe an appearance
S0622	so if you want to press charge now they've get her you could do
S0525	compensation
S0622	but
S0617	compensation what or
S0641	do you reckon you could even though there's no
S0525	i don't know i don't know if they convict her mm
S0641	mm
S0525	yeah probably
S0641	could do could say like it's scar to
S0525	yeah
S0641	walk anywhere by yourself and all this mentally
S0622	i don't i don't understand why you wouldn't because you
S0525	mm
S0622	you don't want any aggro you don't want to be involve do you
S0617	no
S0622	so so i understand that so just so if you don't want to
S0622	if they ask you to appear don't say you don't want to but you just give a rely on the previous statement or any other question they might have
S0525	yeah you haven't
S0622	you can answer can't you
S0525	you haven't gotta go so i wouldn't i wouldn't worry about that yet
S0617	but would they would they have tell her that i've be into the police station
S0525	no
S0622	no no
S0617	they wouldn't
S0525	no
S0622	give them
S0525	no
S0622	any of my
S0525	no
S0622	information

S0525	easy money
S0622	there's only there be one or two of us actually do things everybody else be just stand around
S0622	point and make a note
S0622	just farcical
S0641	it's crazy
S0525	well the guy we employ
S0622	it's so
S0525	years ago and we employ him at twenty five and he's have he spend five years as a pipe inspector and we be like really cos pipe inspectors be normally in their forties and how have you get
S0622	yeah
S0525	it turn out it be his erm uncle's company
S0641	oh yeah
S0525	who who be well know i mean we'd hear of them but we didn't realise be connect to the family erm and so he'd he he have train do the train but he say to me say oh you'd be er in the middle of nowhere and he'd read a book for five hours of the day then he'd go and inspect a weld for ten minutes and then he'd go back and he be pay thousands and thousands and thousands of pound which he spend on women god know what hotels live live life
S0525	you know didn't save a penny but yeah he say he his complaint at the end of the day be it be bore but you know if you've get the right qualification you've gotta have a bite of erm something about you because he say you know you'd have the odd you'd you'd have polish people onsite you know and all sort smoke or walk on the pipe where it's not dangerous he go and you can you can bring a whole pipeline to a stop
S0641	yeah yeah
S0525	you've get the power to do that if you say well things and he'd do it before he say and he'd come up against a lot of people
S0525	threaten to punch his light out but he be a big you know fellow so he wasn't bother but you've gotta that's why i think we associate it more with an older person
S0641	bite more authority about them
S0525	cos he be
S0641	a bite more of a presence
S0525	he be only in his he be kind of your age but he be a you know he'd get a bite about him and he wouldn't take any nonsense and he be er so but but yeah this be this be what they say isn't it it's
S0641	do you find it a bite monotonous or be it
S0622	no no it's quite it's quite enjoyable and er
S0525	oh really have you enjoy it
S0622	well not enjoyable even quite

S0622	well it be
S0525	nice today
S0622	it be clear sky yesterday
S0525	oh well that's good
S0622	and the previous day so
S0525	yeah
S0622	this morning it be a bite wet but all we be do be erm select pip to load onto these trailers and the ones that ride on the trailers make sure they be clean inside and er
S0525	with end cap on
S0622	you know out with with and with them with these cap that i mean these be erm a metre diameter pipe
S0525	oh they're nine hundred mil aren't they
S0622	so quite big
S0525	or the be they
S0622	some be nine hundred
S0525	be they a metre or nine hundred
S0622	some be some be nine hundred some be
S0525	so how many be you get on a wagon four or six
S0622	four
S0525	only four
S0622	we get eight wagons load by the end of today
S0525	so you get thirty two pip in this three days
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	ready to go
S0622	well well in you know in two day two and a half day er one and a half days because we didn't do anything on the first day other than clean pip out and
S0525	but presumably
S0622	tidy up
S0525	if they're load on these wagons now
S0622	yes
S0617	cos they've get load of so
S0525	be they now cost money wait to to go be it
S0622	er they're call the
S0525	oh he's use so a different company okay
S0622	different company the transport you mean
S0525	so he's get them load on yeah
S0622	yeah
S0525	well what be these cos these these they can't go anywhere till pay the vat so
S0622	that's right
S0525	be they they're surely we're 's pay to have the wagon sit there now load
S0622	well i don't know they're ready for monday morning so they've gotta go monday and i i don't know whether there's any payment for the wagons
S0525	oh i see
S0622	but he's obviously pay the dock to store the pip
S0525	yeah
S0622	an hour and that sort of thing cos there's six hundred pip six hundred of these massive
S0525	he's just tell me he's use
S0622	thirty about however many pip
S0525	he's use all his money in the company to to release
S0622	plus his own money
S0525	what to release what he can
S0622	yeah so he's er
S0641	must be so much money go in and out of er
S0525	well he should er the customer should be pay they have a letter of credit so that when these pip come over from turkey they land at the dock and various paperwork then have to be fulfil to one to say that they've all arrive and they be insure during transit blah blah blah one to say they be from the correct origin erm one to say yes you know we're happy with with what's there and then when all these document be in place it go to the bank and this letter of credit erm come into force whereas the customer then have to pay and we traditionally would do eighty five percent of the value of the order cos you're talk it's a four million pound job
S0641	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	so they pay eighty five percent at this point they can see their pip they're all there get their name on all ready for them eighty five percent they need to release them to site and then once they're onsite and they're lay and whatever then you get the thirty day credit and they pay the other fifteen percent
S0622	
S0525	and normally if they're gonna query anything it's that fifteen percent at the end
S0617	why haven't you have an invite cos you've tell them you won't go there
S0622	we're away
S0617	huh
S0622	we be we be away in mauritius
S0525	but that eighty five percent they they haven't pay it well that eighty five percent pay the supplier pay the dock to release with the vat but 's now scrabble around they won't sign the letter of credit because they're say well they haven't get end cap on and they're dirty inside we want them onsite before we're gonna pay
S0641	oh
S0525	forget it you pay or they're not release
S0641	mm
S0525	that's what i do when i be in charge you you don't pay they're not leave the dock they'll be ship back to turkey
S0641	they'll
S0525	end of story 's now release every little bite of capital he can to get a few bits out so they've get something to start oh it it's it's him all over
S0641	and be he
S0622	and he's just hop that they will pay next week some time
S0525	yeah yeah he's just again just
S0622	but
S0525	hop they'll pay
S0622	they're gonna hang hang out as long as they want to
S0525	of course they be
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	and you're talk millions he he his company can't run for more than a few months like that and then he's under i mean we go under
S0525	we go under when he do this before two thousand and nine and that i i just gutted for him cos i just think there's a huge the this customer
S0622	a massive water company
S0525	want these pip
S0641	it's like a multi multi million pound
S0525	they're a
S0622	yeah
S0525	they're a it's a conglomeration i think of three company
S0622	yeah there's the
S0525	contractors
S0622	water authority i be deal with
S0525	right well okay so
S0622	rather probably
S0525	you've get this so you've get
S0525	this big four million pound project four million be just the pipe supply they've get all sort
S0641	so for them it's
S0525	oh they've get load more involve in this right and they've get you can imagine now they've get contractors onsite they've get people ready they've get people dig trench they've get big crane they're dig out the trench they've get maybe roads be block off and hold up for pip to go through they've get a lot of people involve on this right if say can't have them till you pay how long the
S0525	they're gonna last a week ten days but 's now oh oh well let's see what we can do no let's not see what we can do for you they be lose money hand over fist while they're not get those pip out of the dock
S0641	so apart from obviously ruin
S0622	apparently
S0641	cash flow be he be he also lose money from
S0525	yeah
S0622	well he's have to pay people to erm like me
S0641	to
S0622	to go up there and help him
S0525	yeah yeah and it's
S0622	clean the pip
S0525	and it's gonna cost him
S0641	yeah
S0525	the fact that he's have wagons now load those wagons whether he be load them yesterday
S0622	yeah well he start it yeah
S0525	right well that wagon now can't go anywhere that that that transport company
S0622	well he the the bloke
S0525	cannot use that wagon
S0641	mm
S0525	for anything else now until it deliver the stuff
S0641	so he'll be charge for that
S0525	so of course he'll be charge
S0622	yeah but er but erm the bloke that he have obviously he have a conversation on the phone and the transport bloke be say well let's get it load today so that we can go first thing monday
S0525	that that's a
S0622	or
S0525	that's a
S0622	can we get out before monday
S0525	yeah
S0622	and er they be
S0525	yeah
S0622	try to organise that
S0525	yeah
S0622	but i don't think they can
S0525	yeah
S0622	but er
S0525	that's okay
S0622	yeah mm
S0525	because they don't expect to be able to deliver to commercial sit over the weekend
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	but if they're load wednesday thursday you can guarantee they be charge wednesday thursday friday rat
S0622	mm mm mm
S0525	they might not charge you saturday and sunday
S0622	mm
S0525	but they'll charge you for first thing monday morning again
S0622	mm mm so it's a big expense i mean he he's now say he wednesday he be say well we're not gonna make any money on this
S0641	on the whole project
S0622	four million pound project
S0525	i dunno what his margin be
S0622	but then but then
S0525	yeah
S0622	he say then he say well we might make a quarter of what we expect to make
S0525	okay
S0622	that be it er this morning or yesterday if i remember right
S0525	he's never have to run a project this size cos get the project and i run the finance 's never have to run it
S0622	mm but 's you know in in the on the phone
S0525	be be he
S0622	yeah but erm
S0525	involve
S0622	he's do try to sort of er get kind of they need to sign or to least do
S0525	i know
S0622	do something
S0525	but give too much away
S0622	but apparently er say the er water company haven't get a contract at the other end to lay the pipe yet
S0525	oh right
S0525	so they haven't get the contract to
S0641	be they gonna pay
S0525	right
S0622	so that's what he say
S0525	but if they haven't get the contract to lay the pipe
S0622	mm
S0525	they have not then get all those cost i just tell you they have therefore they can hang on as long as they like
S0622	mm except they've get the crane in place to get the pip off
S0525	okay well that's a small cost but if they're not
S0622	mm mm
S0525	dig trench and manpower and people hang around to do things and the a whole site designate they have not get all those cost so if that's not gonna happen for six months they could hang out for six months
S0641	and that would ruin
S0525	yeah yeah yeah have to enforce they pay that letter of credit before those pip leave the dock or or the company's seriously in trouble
S0641	be it not a legal obligation be it not
S0525	well yeah you have to
S0641	contractual
S0525	yeah yeah but only when all these document be sign from the letter of credit
S0641	delay
S0525	so you've get you've get so basically the bank's hold the money so when this company when pay their let's say it's eighty five percent it doesn't come to
S0641	mm mm
S0525	it come to the bank and the bank then accord to the letter of credit it say right you need to pay x amount to the supplier in turkey and x amount to that's where the money go
S0622	for the bank
S0525	for the bank
S0622	yeah
S0525	so the customer's get peace of mind that they're not just hand over eighty five percent and get nothing
S0641	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	yeah so the bank hold it all but because the bank hold it all all these document surround the letter of credit have to be sign and in place before they'll go right here we go you get your money you get your money and they're obviously stall on sign off some of the document that surround the letter of credit which be commonplace
S0641	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	with we it's happen a million time but sorry pip at the dock and cos the last time that happen be the olympic pipe
S0622	mm
S0525	and it be hold at the dock and it be hold at the dock for months and months and i remember say to we be about to go to thailand it be two thousand and well two thousand and twelve yeah the year of the olympics and they still hadn't put the pipe in
S0622	mm
S0622	mm yeah
S0525	two thousand and and in fact
S0622	it be a sewer pipe as well
S0525	it didn't get lay in time it didn't get lay in time that particular pipe cos we do quite a lot of the work on the olympics and erm we say er at some point now this pipe at the dock erm there's there's gonna be a point where it it's cost us more than we're make and i'd work out that point some time at the end of january and say you have to move it it have to be ship back to france where we have a storage yard for free with a supplier you know or they pay for it and they take it something's gotta happen cos you can't leave it cos we'd start lose money at this point cos this have be go on since november and he stall and he stall and i say what
S0641	it's eat into the profit
S0525	i can't tell you i can't
S0641	yeah
S0525	reiterate enough
S0641	mm
S0525	we're now lose
S0622	and the the other thing with this be as well
S0525	and i think they pay
S0622	yeah
S0525	they pay at the end
S0622	mm
S0525	of feb so we lose and and
S0622	yeah
S0525	they pay and they take it but that be a that be a gamble and it do pay off but
S0641	can you not charge the company for the delay i mean that's
S0525	oh yeah you can try they're not pay
S0622	you can try
S0525	they're not pay it
S0641	oh
S0622	or or the suppliers
S0622	for the
S0641	can you not get in the in the contract before
S0525	yes
S0641	you
S0525	yes do you know how much it be to take somebody to court and do you know how long it take and do you know how you you can't afford to do it
S0622	or you can be or
S0525	we have
S0622	consign charge the people who make the pip for cos they've turn up without end on and they're all dirty
S0525	yeah
S0622	try try and charge that if you want
S0525	they're
S0641	and then
S0525	forget it
S0622	but but yeah
S0525	you you we we have try
S0622	the big er
S0525	and we have
S0622	oh dear
S0525	you get stick in a legal battle
S0622	mm
S0525	solicitors take all the money and by the time it get to court a company like us
S0641	it wasn't worth it
S0525	you have no
S0641	you get crush by that
S0525	you you yeah you you can't you have nothing leave we've learn that over and over again the contract be in place because they have to be but if you have to enforce it forget it
S0622	the the the big
S0525	hold your hand up and go under
S0622	the bigger problem with all this be that erm on the nineteenth of march there's six hundred pip there now
S0525	mm
S0622	nine hundred be turn up on the
S0525	turn up
S0622	nineteenth of march which be
S0525	the next lot
S0622	a week tomorrow
S0641	and these be big pip
S0622	these be again the same
S0525	well they're
S0622	it's the same again
S0525	they're this they're this diameter
S0622	plus half as much
S0525	thirteen and a half metres long so they're longer than this room
S0617	here we be
S0622	yes
S0525	so each
S0622	across
S0641	it's
S0622	the road from here
S0641	yeah yeah it's like
S0525	yeah
S0641	yeah
S0525	each one
S0525	you have
S0622	down the drive
S0525	so you imagine handle each one of these you know it's a it's a big job that's why you only get four on a wagon
S0622	mm
S0525	so you're move so you're get nine hundred how many wagons be that
S0622	so you're get nine hundred
S0641	so should you be charge
S0622	another the same again
S0641	or or be it just
S0525	no well
S0641	be it hard to
S0525	he come up
S0641	be it competitive
S0525	with the price he come up with with the price you know base on the price from the supplier and the price of the transport company and the price well he never use to put contingency in for the bank fee but that be always around fifteen k you know you put all these price together and then you work out maybe a profit that you're happy with
S0641	mm
S0525	and that's what we go with but
S0641	so you need to incorporate this kind of wastage cost to try and
S0525	i do contingency fund oh won't put that in won't put that in well it's gonna go
S0622	be be more competitive price
S0641	price need
S0525	but do
S0525	yeah always but we always have enough oh i make a bite more on the exchange rate or i do something to make a little bite more somewhere erm but er 's in charge of it all now
S0641	be there lot of company out there that if you don't offer that competitive price they will the contract
S0525	er more so now than there be we be the only ones that provide the steel pip so we didn't have the competition
S0641	so then you could charge the higher price
S0525	but
S0617	dad
S0622	hello
S0617	internet's rubbish it doesn't work
S0622	yeah i know well i wouldn't say it doesn't work but it's slow isn't it i i'm i er phone up the other day and they try to er we go on a different line type thing and try something else so
S0617	mm
S0622	i know it's not very good sorry
S0617	no it's okay just slow and
S0525	the the the problem be be they gonna choose steel cos they don't have to choose steel they can choose ductile which be a lot cheaper so get the material steel be a big thing and now we've get steel in the uk market we've get lot of big contractors who be go direct to pipe mill in europe and and do their own so it's er it's
S0641	be there manufacture of steel in the the global market be that affect
S0525	we don't
S0641	or not
S0525	get anything from india or china which be where all the the glut be cos it be it's rubbish
S0641	it's naff quality
S0525	it's really poor yeah yeah so it it doesn't just doesn't
S0641	fair enough
S0525	er they use it in in in but we don't turkey we get ours from there's a big erm in mill in erm spain as well which be try to compete but of course they're close down all the steel in the uk
S0622	mm
S0641	yeah
S0622	it's amaze they just
S0525	cos we can't make it pay
S0622	i remember you know be in that but it cos they be big massive
S0525	big pip yeah
S0622	things and three tonnes
S0525	i've sit in a few with a hard hat on have a photo take
S0622	and erm
S0622	the they're they're roll steel so they're like you you
S0525	yeah
S0622	you can see how it's make cos the the you can see see the join
S0525	but this er these
S0622	and there there's spin and all that
S0525	spirally weld these ones
S0622	yeah
S0525	they're spiral weld
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	so you've get this this thing go right down
S0622	this line go and you can see
S0525	yeah
S0622	how they're make and then they coat them inside and out
S0525	yeah
S0622	and er and
S0525	coat them and line them
S0622	yeah so it's er and then er what we yeah what we would be do be go down er with a with a pressure washer and
S0525	so you you're inside it
S0622	yes a little bite although not too much because normally it's
S0525	oh you didn't you couldn't walk right through it these be they a bite small for that
S0622	oh you could crawl
S0525	well no you could get through them yeah
S0622	you could crawl i could crawl down
S0525	that's what i think you might be do
S0622	well that's what i be do
S0525	oh
S0622	but the trouble be what be happen
S0641	bite scary that
S0525	inside thirteen and a half metres of well
S0641	it would be horrible
S0525	cos you can see the light the other end
S0641	yeah
S0622	what be
S0622	happen be that erm you be you be drag in dirt on your boot or on on the
S0622	on the on the spray pressure washer cable so that be a bite sort of er you know if you're careful
S0525	i don't
S0622	it be pointless really it seem to me
S0525	do do he do he say why because
S0617	do you wanna quickly go to the
S0641	what would you like
S0617	just some cookies milk chocolate
S0641	anything else
S0617	do you reckon that'll work and then we'll just heat them up in the microwave and then see if want some and then we've get ice cream do you wanna buy like some sauce or something
S0641	what so get chocolate sauce or get chocolate to melt
S0617	oh yeah get chocolate to melt
S0525	when when be this a water pipe or a sewage pipe
S0622	water
S0525	water drink water
S0622	well i dunno
S0525	water
S0622	be it i dunno yeah yeah
S0525	water
S0622	i dunno yeah
S0525	so when when they put this pipeline together it get dirty anyway
S0622	yeah well that's what er
S0525	and they have to blast it
S0622	what keep say yeah
S0525	
S0622	yeah
S0525	they've gotta blast it at high speed
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	with water to clean it er so i don't understand this
S0622	well this it's er i mean both both they be both say
S0525	there be no need there there there be
S0622	yeah well we don't need to this really
S0525	there be no need
S0622	but we do it because he want us to do it
S0525	if it's sewage it doesn't matter and if it's water it's gotta be blast anyway
S0622	mm
S0525	at high at high pressure
S0622	oh
S0617	do anybody want anything from the shop
S0525	no thank
S0622	i no thank you
S0641	you sure
S0525	no
S0622	no i don't i don't know well well part of it be say that's what they because the end cap be suppose to be on and when it when there be come without them on
S0617	yeah if you buy like a bag then i'm sure dad will have one
S0525	but that that's what i don't understand the need for that
S0622	or they would nick apparently somebody say they be nick but then i'm not sure that's quite who'd wanna nick an end cap well i dunno
S0525	i dunno
S0641	have i leave my coat
S0617	i dunno you'll have to have a look at my coat as well in a minute
S0617	huh
S0617	no it's really nice i really like it
S0617	that and then my erm
S0641	it keep bleep
S0617	in your pocket i can hear something or be that something else in the cloakroom
S0622	they be use er 's 's end cap
S0525	oh they be use er 's end cap
S0622	well only because there's
S0525	but the the hessian
S0622	hessian type things and er i mean some be erm too small some be too big
S0525	yeah
S0622	it's just like er chaos
S0525	well because spigot and socket end be different size we do but
S0622	oh yeah but the
S0525	do
S0622	these be these be big hessian sack things
S0525	do realise
S0622	really huge
S0525	that the company that make them be in glasgow
S0622	erm
S0525	so that should he
S0622	well we have
S0525	should he
S0622	we have really you know mm
S0525	should but i'm think when his next pip arrive
S0622	yeah yeah the same
S0525	if he give this glasgow company an order now
S0622	mm
S0525	he'd be able to pick them up and he'll have them ready to put on be what i'm think
S0622	mm well
S0525	i should have mention that to him when
S0622	he's erm
S0525	i saw him outside a minute ago
S0622	i think probably he er cos i mean i suppose he's hop that the next lot will come with er with the end cap on cos that's what they how they should arrive but because he wasn't there when they do arrive er people have either nick them or they've fall or they cos they're
S0525	yeah
S0622	pretty ropey and some
S0525	yeah
S0622	some people be there last week do the what we be we be do it be er
S0525	what people for
S0622	yeah yeah and they be just er i dunno what they be do but erm some of the stuff they'd well appear to have do have be
S0525	well the end cap
S0622	rubbish
S0525	aren't pricey but they they do sell i mean because you can put those end cap on any type of pipe
S0622	mm yeah

S0622	and for the last couple of miles of him say this be too far this be too far cos it be take us er a good while while or three quarter of an hour to get there
S0525	oh right
S0622	and er say i well well i'm not gonna stay in the caravan if it's gonna be this this far
S0525	this far away

S0525	he's a good bloke isn't he he's a nice bloke
S0622	yeah he's a very nice bloke
S0525	yeah
S0622	i i mean he he's like he can't do anything physical
S0525	no he's too big
S0622	he's a
S0525	no i know no no
S0622	he's
S0525	he's a he's a big
S0622	stomach out here
S0525	little round fella
S0622	a stomach out here
S0525	shorter than but
S0622	and he walk along like a penguin and
S0525	yeah i know
S0622	he can't he can't
S0525	he's a he's a he's a very
S0622	do anything
S0525	pleasant chap though he's a nice
S0622	oh yes oh yeah a nice bloke yeah
S0525	yeah yeah
S0622	yeah absolutely very really helpful and
S0525	no
S0622	chatty and sort of you know
S0525	well you can't get you're even pip be it just you and slide through the
S0622	well yeah well yeah that's right that's what he want and er
S0525	they're just watch
S0622	they couldn't climb up any pip or anything like that i think he's get no chance
S0525	oh no oh well no
S0622	like it be just it be it be farcical cos they
S0622	they be part of the sort of the
S0525	couldn't clean the inside of a pipe and
S0622	the hi vis the the hi vis brigade they be just basically direct operations and
S0525	oh no
S0622	chat about you know oh they they just talk about
S0622	a load of rubbish half the time and then they decide they're gonna do something different from the five minutes ago they decide something else and so on
S0525	yeah
S0622	it's just
S0525	yeah
S0622	it's just
S0525	you're just do as you're tell okay that's fair enough
S0622	well i be just you know just
S0525	yeah well yeah that's all you can do it's not
S0622	er yes i be but
S0525	you you you don't know the business though
S0622	but also i be i be think well we need to do this now because if we don't do this now we can't do the the rest of it cos the
S0525	yeah
S0622	the the the erm the pipe machine that be move them it's a massive big er crane type thing
S0525	on the dock
S0622	yeah
S0525	mm
S0622	mobile crane but more like a
S0525	yeah
S0622	more an arm it be
S0525	yeah yeah
S0622	and it have this big erm vacuum suction thing
S0525	oh the suction ones
S0622	they're really
S0525	they're good aren't they
S0622	they're good
S0525	they're impressive those things
S0622	they be yeah yeah
S0525	yeah they be i've see
S0622	pick up these huge
S0525	i've see those in operation
S0622	he'd get these three down there
S0525	yeah
S0622	and then what he be do be pick them up
S0525	yeah
S0622	erm drop it down slightly and then we'd take the end off
S0525	yeah
S0622	or one end off cos the other end be already off
S0525	yeah
S0622	and then he'd tilt it slightly
S0525	yeah
S0622	we'd spray it
S0525	oh i see
S0622	and sometimes get inside do
S0525	oh so you've get somebody work a crane for you
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	so that's cost you
S0622	presume so yeah yeah
S0525	oh that that will
S0622	i dunno
S0525	yeah
S0622	so it's er it's
S0525	blimey oh i
S0622	yeah and he's there
S0525	i think you be just do them on the grind didn't you have a guy on the you be
S0622	well we we couldn't er
S0525	cos those suction things be
S0622	some of them we can't get to
S0525	flip expensive
S0622	cos they're either there or or they're er you can't
S0525	just have to
S0622	get the the cover the the end off because it's be ram
S0525	yeah
S0622	against another pipe so you have to get them out
S0525	wow
S0622	and do them as they load them pretty much most of them
S0525	pointless though it's a pointless exercise
S0622	well that's what he want to do just to try and keep the customer sweet but
S0525	well i'd have it's like i'd have have them sit say well they go back to turkey if you don't sign the letter of credit and pay end of story
S0622	mm mm
S0525	we'll sort them out onsite do what you like you've gotta blast them anyway this really be such unnecessary cost
S0622	well yeah and i think half of him probably know that except he just the other half be say well i bet but the little erm bite of damage to one of the pip
S0525	yeah
S0622	and erm they usually apparently repair those onsite
S0525	yes yes yeah there's always damage yeah
S0622	and before we come away we have to repair it and we have to
S0525	what with the patch patch
S0622	patch them and a
S0525	blowtorch
S0622	blowtorch yeah
S0525	so you've learn how to do repair patch then
S0622	well i saw
S0525	so
S0622	but i didn't do it
S0525	so hang on so you you didn't get as far as the caravan site then
S0622	no no we we turn round about with about half a mile to go
S0525	and
S0622	cos say we're not go this far
S0525	so what what where's stop when he go on sunday
S0622	premier inn which be right next to the dock
S0525	which be where you've be
S0622	no
S0525	no
S0622	no this be a closer one which they'll do for three hundred pound a week or something
S0525	the premier inn they'll do
S0525	they'll do for three hundred quid a week
S0622	well apparently
S0525	yeah
S0622	i say well you should be able to get a better deal if if you then say that there's other people come for the next month or so
S0525	yeah yeah
S0622	two months you could get a really better cos they do
S0525	yeah
S0622	it for twenty nine pound a week or a night or something if you if you book a lot
S0525	that be travelodge be they the same be they
S0622	oh i don't know
S0525	yeah
S0622	have get that wrong but anyway he's gonna try and get a better deal on that so
S0525	well i hope he do
S0622	yes
S0525	so he's how many people
S0622	it's
S0525	have he get go up next week
S0622	this bloke's go sunday afternoon even he's stay till the next sunday
S0525	oh he's stay oh right a full week up there
S0622	he's stay for the whole week and then
S0525	right what's he do though can't actually physically help
S0622	well that's a good question really
S0525	be he on the payroll or be he subcontract to
S0622	say he tell me he's self employ
S0525	he's self employ be he i'm not sure what he be do oh right so it of course
S0622	but he's clearly sort of er
S0525	well if he's
S0622	you know
S0525	self employ
S0622	very convenient for him to to to to and he he you know he tend to know he seem to know his stuff
S0525	yes he he's be in the business a while he's
S0622	yeah
S0525	he's do valves and stuff he's be in that sort of industry but self employ yeah so he's gonna be course he's gonna go up isn't it easy money now
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	he's gonna be rake it in i didn't realise i i couldn't remember
S0525	if he be self employ oh what's he do have be alright
S0622	yeah yeah yeah he's be very frustrate i mean he er
S0525	mm yeah
S0622	angry about things
S0525	the customer there er anybody
S0622	but he's quite he's his normal self type of thing you know
S0525	have anybody be there from the customers
S0622	we have a couple of suit turn up today they call them
S0525	mm
S0622	and well the nobody seem to know where they be from to be honest
S0525	oh
S0622	a consultancy a the pipe but they be but they be
S0525	they be the consultancy
S0622	they think they be a pipe
S0525	they they they weren't the customer
S0622	i i don't think so no
S0525	they be the consultants
S0622	no i and then there's another there be a bloke on who be there yesterday and this today he be er quality control type he must have be another pipe inspector but he he have on on the side of his car
S0525	right
S0622	and stuff so i dunno whether he's there as a pipe inspector and he be put a few
S0525	i can't believe that you know the fact that they're stall be just standard but
S0622	yeah
S0525	should not be ship a single pipe out of there
S0622	well this this be d√©j√† vu isn't it cos you be say this about
S0525	this be gonna be
S0622	the one surely
S0525	oh the one well we could see that fall apart that be do completely differently it be do on vest certificate and it be do separately and then it be a smaller job this be erm this be a really bad decision
S0622	but the thing be with it the thing obviously there's another nine hundred come and then another
S0525	try ones in the cupboard the smaller ones
S0622	and then another ship after that as well apparently another dunno how many more after that but the but there's not room on the dock now
S0525	on the dock together no
S0622	to put nine hundred more on there so
S0525	well they're expect those
S0622	we've gotta shift them out quickly that's probably why 's do it to get the pip go but we can't erm we can't shift them quick they can't move them quick enough now so i dunno what what er all what'll happen when his his money run out and they haven't pay cos they they'll presumably they won't be able to ship any well move any more because they won't be able to pay for them
S0525	well he'll have that small window of opportunity at the end of the month with the vat return but
S0617	be you have any mum
S0622	what be you have
S0617	with the chocolate sauce and ice cream
S0622	er not for me thank you
S0622	i've have enough food
S0617	mum
S0525	no thank you
S0622	thank you i might have a bite actually
S0617	yeah we're melt the chocolate
S0622	yes
S0617	you know the
S0622	we
S0617	warm cookie and
S0622	okay
S0617	erm
S0622	oh well i don't want any ice cream but i'll have that if you're make it
S0617	you've get galaxy
S0622	oh well do
S0525	oh there's a bar of that in there oh and the oh look at that galaxy and
S0622	look at that
S0525	excellent good man you've buy a bigger bar i think than i've get
S0622	there be another erm
S0525	could you make a coffee while that's boil my cup's there
S0617	well i'm gonna do this first
S0622	there's another erm contract after this
S0525	yes say have get a one local more local
S0622	well no with
S0525	oh
S0525	oh oh oh yes oh they haven't right no cos he i think 's get another contract he's already win another which be the one which'll be closer
S0622	yes yes er he mention he mention that but there there would be with these people
S0525	well yes because they're they're in that particular phase of the period where this be erm they're all buy now yeah
S0622	yeah and erm
S0525	good
S0622	say oh well i'm not do i'm not do letter of credit again so
S0525	oh this this be the best thing we letter of credit be the best way we ever have
S0622	yeah
S0525	we've keep that company afloat but letter of credit
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	after what he do before
S0622	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	oh i i feel bad but he doesn't really want my help anymore but
S0622	well it's not your
S0525	it's not my thing now but i just wanna just get in and say listen no
S0622	yes but well er all that'll do be make you frustrate and annoy and er and and er
S0525	yeah
S0622	cause you grief you're not
S0525	yeah no no but that that's that's grief on a that's not like erm grief with the situation with and which be my main problem for leave this be these be job which go wrong that you have to sort out
S0622	mm
S0525	but that's different but erm if you don't have any comeback off him it's it's tricky
S0641	would you go back
S0525	no no not not if be gonna be in charge of it cos he's
S0622	that's what i mean cos you you wouldn't agree with anything he do cos he's
S0525	no i know
S0622	i mean i mean you've already as you've already identify the bits that you
S0525	i know
S0622	you know you'd to be tell to him don't bother to clean the pip because
S0525	well no and but and be the same he he that's and you can see why
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	you you you've gotta you've gotta blast the pipe at high pressure before it's and and test ph level and everything so a little bite of dirt in it now it it's irrelevant we blast this
S0617	mm mm mm
S0525	you've gotta blast it to check all the joint hold blahdy blahdy blah you know before
S0622	i think he think they'll look at the pipe and think oh they're dirty i'll send them back but they're not gonna send them back unless they remove them they're on there be they
S0525	but now if they haven't get a contract in place or anybody actually dig trench blahdy blah at the moment i could understand why they're
S0622	i think it be something like that
S0525	stall
S0622	or or it might be something on they can't get them off the lorries or something stupid
S0525	you see because before
S0622	they haven't arrange half the things
S0525	no
S0622	the the other end
S0525	because before
S0622	which
S0525	obviously when when they've get gang of men wait they're pay those gang of men
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	so the longer they're stall get the pip the more they're pay out that in the end they just
S0622	yeah
S0525	pay the pipe and you get it do but if they haven't get those gang wait
S0622	mm
S0525	they're not lose money therefore they're not in any hurry to
S0622	no no yeah plus if they can't like er er if they haven't get people to take take them off the lorries the other end then they're not gonna get the lorries back in time to move the other pip there's only so many number of lorries that be go out
S0525	oh yeah
S0622	and back
S0525	yeah yeah
S0525	sure yeah
S0622	so you think well
S0525	and you only want the crane to break down one end or the other which they do often the suction things break down a lot so you've get the the
S0622	oh right
S0525	crane that end and then you've get the crane the other end
S0622	mm
S0525	one of those break down that stop you for a day or two then the lorries charge you because they're back up they're charge demurrage wait around charge there's you know there's always a big contingency in there of at least ten grand which he never he never build in but if he and if he's cut it to the bone as it be then it before you know it yeah it's go
S0622	well the because of the this this next delivery he's talk about erm you're work all easter weekend so he's er ask all these big blokes the crane driver and the lorry drivers if you wanna if you wanna go and work work
S0525	bung a few quid
S0622	and they say fine yeah we we'll we don't have holiday necessarily if there's work to do
S0525	mm
S0622	we'll do it
S0525	they'll do it
S0622	because we like the money type thing so
S0641	yeah
S0525	would you make coffee
S0617	oh mum need a coffee
S0641	yes
S0525	er my cup's just there look by the
S0622	it's your

S0622	yeah and and erm
S0525	doesn't do a lot
S0622	's the same he go off to some other site that they've get some one or two problems on

S0525	and er he'll just be supervise other people
S0622	yeah i could see him sort of er
S0525	yeah not do the actual work
