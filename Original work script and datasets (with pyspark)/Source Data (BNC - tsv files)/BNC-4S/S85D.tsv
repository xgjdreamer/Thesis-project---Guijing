S0344	i won't do any sort of erm possession
S0337	no okay yeah yeah yeah
S0345	that doesn't bother me
S0344	i struggle really much with possession because i'm not quite sure what i think about it and like
S0337	okay
S0344	so i don't really like watch that so i remember when i watch the exorcist for the first time i end up and i'm not even exaggerate for you at fourteen years old i watch it and i sleep in my mum's bed for three weeks
S0344	right so then about two no about three years later seventeen the exorcism of emily rise come out right
S0344	so i'm like i'm older now i can handle this no i end up sleep in in my mum's bed for a week
S0344	right and
S0345	what be you scar of
S0344	walk to my back against the door she get possess she be in bed her body be all over the shop
S0345	i walk with my back against the wall anyway
S0344	i don't wanna be in my own bed right so anyway then
S0337	think it's slightly more awkward if you get possess next to your mum
S0344	yeah
S0337	hi mum
S0344	well be it
S0337	slightly possess here
S0344	it be if erm it be if like she say what she say in the exorcist and then she go your mother suck cock in hell no that be not for me and do you know what's not for me when they start speak in tongue
S0336	yeah
S0345	what be that cheese
S0336	yeah i think so yeah
S0344	that's freaky and they start speak in tongue and they start like go and like all the all the what be what be the old aramaic be it aramaic
S0336	yeah
S0344	the old language of the bible
S0336	no idea
S0344	that freak me out firstly number one
S0337	well
S0344	i don't know why it freak me out because nobody have hear aramaic
S0344	so i don't even know how they're do that
S0344	and number two like i be i be just petrify so anyway we're talk twenty three years old i'm think i can definitely handle this now so i watch the the rite with anthony hopkins in it
S0337	oh
S0336	mm
S0344	about a priest who doesn't really believe in god anymore so their monastery send him to erm to erm
S0337	hell
S0344	italy
S0336	okay
S0344	to meet someone who perform exorcism and he go very sceptical about it cos he doesn't wanna be a priest anymore and he see some real fuck up shit and real exorcism anthony hopkins be the guy there that do the exorcisms erm basically the whole story be about how it's quite weird and all of this stuff and a lot of demonic possession and things and it's quite freaky as it be so you're worry aren't you it's quite freaky as it be
S0337	do it flash
S0345	mm

S0344	it's the most annoy thing when you're watch tv and like
S0344	what the fuck be that a lighthouse

S0344	well
S0337	sierra leone
S0344	that's that's
S0337	and
S0344	a whole different fuck kettle of fish ain't it
S0337	yeah all these countries have literally ten doctor for the whole country
S0336	mm
S0337	and
S0336	that's crazy
S0337	and there's like six million people there
S0344	and at the moment in sierra leone
S0337	they've get no doctor
S0344	what they're do be they're let them die so when they have a report
S0345	the body i've just see the body like in the streets like
S0344	when they have when they yeah when they have a report of someone with ebola they let them die then they come and pick up the body they don't like pick up the person treat the person cos they can't afford to treat the person
S0344	there's nothing there's no reason they're gonna let them die cos they're gonna die
S0336	they're not dispose of body properly
S0344	but the body when er at their most at the at their most at their most risk of
S0337	mm mm mm
S0344	pass it on when they're dead
S0336	mm
S0344	so they're not bury them properly
S0345	i don't know why they're not do anything about it really like they're treat people but
S0344	they need to ban
S0345	they need to
S0336	they be they're do
S0345	stop it
S0336	like i be kind of say to it's almost plague like they've start like mark people's doors and stuff if they've get ebola and shit
S0344	yeah
S0336	crazy
S0337	have you ever watch walk dead
S0344	yeah
S0345	no
S0337	okay so we've just finish the first season
S0344	yeah
S0337	and when it explain what kind of happen in the hospital and you can see the army just shoot people
S0344	yeah
S0337	that's probably gonna happen
S0336	mm
S0337	you can just can't you just imagine that
S0344	yeah
S0337	like that whole fuck it we'll just go in there and kill them all
S0345	they should have like quarantine station
S0337	yeah
S0344	yeah
S0337	scary
S0344	i think erm i think cos what be there there's this be the largest pandemic of ebola ever isn't it
S0337	yeah yeah
S0344	so isn't there like something like twelve
S0337	there's
S0344	thousand
S0337	yeah
S0344	or something
S0336	that's
S0337	i read er like
S0336	crazy
S0337	the last week it be
S0345	i don't know
S0337	ten thousand so
S0336	mm
S0344	yeah
S0337	probably more
S0344	yeah and like i just think to myself like it's not okay it's not come over yet but er two people in spain that be too close to home
S0337	mm
S0345	but there be that guy in wales that think he have it and i don't know what happen with that
S0344	yeah i don't think he have it
S0337	he have a cold didn't he
S0344	yeah
S0345	do he
S0336	yeah
S0344	and somebody go and think he do in london and
S0344	like and a west african man think he do in london but he didn't have it
S0336	but ironically it's mainly doctor and nurse that
S0345	yeah
S0336	be bring it back because obviously they're go out there to help
S0345	like that guy he go back
S0336	mm the doctor

S0336	no
S0344	because there's no reason for you to come back
S0336	that's what's more dangerous have them flit in and out it's like go and help do do you hear
S0337	oh you're you're ill
S0336	do you hear me

S0336	you'd be like oh you bitch you tell me you be here
S0337	that be where we be but
S0345	be it right
S0337	they think they think they think we're on the estate over there

S0337	cos it's new yeah
S0345	but i can press this panic button here
S0337	like help me
S0345	and it'll send him this alert but he say we shouldn't mess around cos i keep do it he's like er i don't think you should press that button willy nilly only for emergencies so
S0336	well it's well exactly
S0345	i can't press it
S0336	it's kind of a good thing to have but if you joke about it if you ever need it
S0345	yeah well i do keep do it
S0345	yeah so we're go away tomorrow so get so much stuff to do i need to like pack and
S0336	that'll be nice though your long weekend
S0345	yeah friday saturday sunday mm
S0336	that's the second one you've be on this year isn't it
S0345	yeah fuck love it
S0336	you like the sun holiday
S0337	it's ten pound
S0345	yeah it's
S0336	what be er what be it like er what
S0345	there's caravan park all over there's like really nice ones like in the lake district or there's even ones in the cotswolds or like everywhere in england
S0337	yeah
S0345	just like havens and stuff
S0336	yeah
S0345	erm park resort we're go to which i don't think's very nice not as good as haven and then there's some in like italy round the lakes there's some in cyprus there's all over obviously you pay for flight but
S0336	yeah
S0345	erm and you just it's just cheap and you can
S0336	yeah
S0345	upgrade your caravan you can upgrade your caravan or you can pay for extras but we don't cos the whole point of it be it's cheap
S0337	cheap
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0345	but we go to cornwall in march and we actually spend more on the petrol cos we're just fuck dickheads
S0336	yeah
S0337	cornwall
S0337	it's a long way
S0345	it take us so long
S0337	it's a long way from anywhere cornwall isn't it
S0345	it be freeze
S0336	cornwall be long
S0345	yeah
S0337	i've never be
S0345	but and we go to like polperro which be so small like the town you can't even drive into it because like it's just that small
S0336	yeah
S0345	erm but as i say we're go to like
S0336	somewhere closer
S0345	yeah
S0336	well that's a good idea though i i always see it and i never really
S0345	honestly just do it
S0337	it's like yeah i remember you mention that you'd do it like
S0336	oh yeah and you be rave about it and i be like oh do this and i never
S0345	they do say
S0336	get round to actually check
S0345	you're mean to collect ten tokens but we always do but if you just google it you can get all the cod they're just like word just random word
S0336	yeah
S0345	so you don't really need to do it you can just do it on the tenth day just google it
S0337	do you have to collect ten each or be it
S0345	no you just need ten ten number me and just take it in turn get a paper for ten days
S0337	be it one code per how many people
S0345	erm up to four it's actually about it's a bite more than ten pound each cos it's base on four share
S0337	okay
S0345	so nine pound fifty time two so what be that like
S0337	that's that's nineteen pound
S0345	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0345	it's nineteen pound each but if we have four people it would be nine fifty each so it's twenty quid each for
S0337	it's still really cheap
S0345	three nights away
S0336	yeah that's nice
S0337	mm
S0345	you can't even get a travelodge for forty quid for one night
S0336	no
S0337	no
S0336	cos that's when when we go away it tend to be like you know like when the premier inn do like twenty nine pound room and then we so we spend like
S0337	we go shop somewhere or
S0336	buy two nights so it's like sixty quid
S0345	mm
S0336	but that's still like thirty quid each
S0345	and it's in a it's in a hotel isn't it like
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0345	it's the caravan and it's ours and it's
S0336	yeah
S0345	and it's a caravan but it's like
S0337	do your own stuff
S0336	but you can do what you want
S0345	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0336	who be that
S0337	who
S0336	oh
S0345	what's wrong with him
S0344	he's a twat that's all
S0345	why
S0344	nothing
S0337	do you wanna check where he be
S0344	mm
S0337	we know where er be
S0345	we just know yeah
S0344	do we
S0337	yeah he's at home don't worry
S0336	i be say to i i i can't believe you guy haven't progress to have each other so you know exactly where you be
S0337	what happen if
S0344	yeah
S0337	he leave his phone at home you don't know where he be
S0345	well you can turn off the location share but it wouldn't necessarily tell me that he'd tell me that
S0345	tell it off turn it off
S0337	no you'd have to actually check and see
S0345	well i dunno i don't know what it would do
S0337	oh wow
S0336	so it be flaw
S0345	well if he turn it off i would know i guess
S0336	cos you'd be like
S0345	where be you
S0336	you've be at your house for ten hours
S0337	so it doesn't a map of where he's be
S0345	no but i can yeah it do
S0345	it can give you like
S0337	notifications
S0345	it it can give me like er in a list like i guess when you do that with your satnav you can get it list can't you
S0337	oh wow
S0336	that's so weird
S0345	the step but also
S0336	that's really intense
S0345	it will erm like it literally show like when he be at this hotel the other night er stay away
S0337	you're like
S0345	erm er yeah i click on it where he be and then you can click again and then it show you another version and then you click again it show you a an actual photograph of it like an aerial view and i could actually see like the actual hotel that he be at
S0337	see him
S0345	and he be in
S0337	could you see him in there
S0336	fuck me that's so yeah
S0336	hello
S0337	she's just a friend
S0336	mm
S0345	but it be cool it be i know it's stalkerish but i don't even go on the app i just see the notification
S0336	yeah mm
S0337	yeah
S0337	right
S0336	it's erm it's it's a thing
S0337	yeah what be we talk we be talk

S0337	mm mm
S0345	it be a start to his awesome day because then his er car pass its mot and be like
S0336	it be the start to his awesome day
S0345	and also
S0336	that's a bite cringe
S0345	he say by the time he'd see like he'd know what be go on like he'd engage he didn't actually see really anything but then he do say at some one point during the day
S0344	oh i i
S0345	he go
S0344	i really try to focus hard and
S0345	this but i just couldn't bring the image back and and me

S0337	and she's just stand there like oh my god
S0345	my boyfriend's just try to picture my best friend naked
S0337	yeah wow bite weird isn't it
S0345	that would've freak me out i'd be like er take that image out of your head i tell that and be like
S0336	he probably
S0345	he be joke
S0336	but it would be er
S0345	i'm like he weren't
S0336	yeah but it if if it have be it would've be funny but like the fact that like you guy don't have a good relationship anyway really
S0345	and also it
S0336	it make it more awkward
S0345	i would feel a bite perved by him
S0336	yeah
S0345	cos i think he's a bite pervy
S0337	i think he deliberately open the door
S0337	he know you be there
S0345	hang on if saw you she be sit on do her makeup on the floor
S0344	she didn't see me
S0345	oh
S0336	no cos i can't imagine it be very it be like a a a slow
S0337	you weren't like
S0336	process
S0336	you'd have be like oh
S0337	oh
S0336	you might've run out into the toilet
S0345	he probably hear your door open and pop out to say hello but he
S0336	i mean i have to admit
S0345	didn't expect you to be naked
S0336	it's a slightly risky thing to do anyway really
S0337	yeah
S0344	yeah but i didn't think he be there and like i happily walk from
S0336	so do do you find out who'd go out
S0344	no he'd go out in the morning to his car and come back in again or something

S0344	on my on my own
S0336	but technically that be a like what you guy have be a plan like even though it be a plan kind of do nothing it be a plan

S0344	we i make plan with him like
S0337	yeah
S0344	at what point when i make plan with you do you think it's okay to make another plan

S0344	so what what
S0336	just kind of go there and be like look to be honest i'm just disappoint i be look forward to that weekend

S0337	you know when your parent use to do disappointment
S0336	just yeah just say like i be really look forward to that weekend
S0345	just say like why don't you wanna spend time with me by ourselves
S0336	i really want to spend time with you like i think you

S0337	i'm i'm not angry i'm disappoint
S0344	yeah i might just go to him
S0337	oh no don't do that
S0344	i might just yeah i might just go to him i might just go to him look i'm just really disappoint that you didn't wanna you know you didn't you know the plan
S0345	no no be like it just really upset me that you don't wanna spend time with me like it really upset me
S0336	really guilt trip him that's the only way he's gonna respond
S0345	actually
S0344	yeah and like say like be like
S0344	you don't wanna spend time with me and you don't wanna you know it feel like you don't wanna do anything
S0345	say i'm not stop you
S0344	without other
S0345	from do anything with friends
S0344	without other other other people
S0337	yeah
S0344	like er like that's what i say to him the other night i say i'm not stop you do things i don't wanna be that girlfriend that stop you do anything and i don't wanna stop you do anything but i just feel that sometimes you need to get your priorities a little bite straight
S0345	no don't put it on him just tell him how much you wanna see him alone and it upset you that he doesn't want to
S0337	i wanna see you alone
S0344	like i think he think like
S0345	er
S0344	just because we like when we're together that we go to bed together that that's enough quality time
S0345	that be not quality time
S0336	no
S0344	like that's me
S0345	that's doesn't count
S0344	i'm sleep
S0337	it be quality time
S0344	do you know what i mean
S0345	you two have quality time
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0336	too too much time
S0337	yeah far too much time
S0345	i don't have any fuck quality time
S0337	it
S0345	i get quality time this weekend
S0337	we're try to get rid of each other aren't we
S0336	it be it it sound really bad but it be nice like if with you go to in a few weeks and like me go to it be nice when you have like the odd weekend
S0345	yeah i love it
S0337	yeah try to just get rid of you
S0336	that weekend we be in he he do jack shit for like two days
S0337	i leave the house once
S0337	it be great
S0344	but like i think like it's just like with he's so social and i'm social but
S0337	he's on another level
S0344	he's on another level like he's always always have to do
S0336	i feel like even even though you like have company that it's not always like oh we have to be do stuff
S0337	yeah
S0344	no
S0337	so your company when when you've live with you and her be together in a room would be company
S0344	yeah
S0337	so now 's come in you and him be in a room together will just be company
S0344	yeah
S0337	and that can be a whereas to him he need more people there
S0344	yeah
S0336	more
S0344	and it's like
S0345	yeah he just always like
S0337	yeah
S0344	and like i think that like we will do stuff together and like we do stuff together if we be do something together and we be together we'd still be talk as much as we'd be talk if we be sit and
S0336	yeah
S0344	it's not like he it's awkward when people aren't around it's absolutely normal like
S0336	yeah
S0344	and we will sit on we will we be fine together that's fine but i think i think he want to do something because he feel like he should be do something
S0336	yeah
S0344	cos he's so use to be do something like he travel for two and a half years and he be always do something so like now he's back he's fill his time with do other things
S0345	yeah but that's the good thing about be in a relationship things do change
S0336	mm
S0344	er no you're preach to the convert do you know what i mean like it's not me that have a problem it's him
S0345	do you know what my favourite things my favourite
S0344	but i don't know what to say i don't know what to say to him
S0336	it it take it take time you know and and it i think the difficulty with it be as well like you say he's in a position where he's live at home for free so all the money he's get in each month he can kind of do what he like with it
S0345	he should be save it
S0336	and so what's happen be he's kind of he be he's spend it he's like oh i've get the money so i'll do this and i'll do that and i'll do if he be in a situation where he be a little bite more constrict that's when you start make the decisions oh well i won't go out as often cos i can't actually afford to do that
S0345	or you do stuff that's free
S0336	yeah
S0345	like have a night in like my favourite weekend be when i don't have anything on literally when i haven't get anything to do and i just know that i've get for the whole weekend and if we wanna go for lunch we'll go but like
S0336	yeah
S0345	and just have nothing
S0337	we we we catch up on tv and stuff
S0336	yeah
S0337	don't we
S0345	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0336	and like
S0345	and watch film in bed
S0336	i i keep say
S0337	yeah
S0336	i keep say every weekend i'm like i'd really like to go for a walk like just spend a couple of hours just go for a walk we haven't we've we haven't do it yet have we cos we just don't find the time
S0345	it's a nice idea but when you actually do it
S0345	it's a bite like oh fuck that
S0336	never find the time
S0344	well i dunno i'm just get a bite
S0336	i would
S0344	piss off
S0336	yeah but there's only so much there's er only so often that you could be piss off before you resent be piss off all the time and he resent you for be piss off all the time
S0345	and just see you really neggie like
S0336	so you just kind of have to
S0336	just guilt trip him that's the only way to go just kind of think to yourself well i be disappoint but rather than go there and be like oh er blah blah blah blah just say look i'm upset obviously i want to spend the weekend with you i be look forward to it i i think you be look forward to it as well and then and then kinda leave it leave it with him let him let him stew it over
S0344	yeah
S0345	don't go in have a go at him
S0344	no
S0345	i know you will
S0344	i'm not go to
S0337	er yeah play
S0344	i actually i'm actually i'm not like i'm so bore of it
S0336	yeah you do get bore of it
S0345	just show him that you're upset cos if you he see you be like aggy he doesn't actually know that it's upset you whereas it be upset you but he doesn't know that cos you're always aggy about it
S0337	he just think you're angry yeah
S0344	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0345	he doesn't see that you're truly just want him alone just quality time he probably see it as you just try to be aggy
S0344	it's like i say to him like i'm not gonna force you to spend time with me if you don't want to then you don't want to but
S0336	mm
S0344	like
S0336	we've get ice cream by the way i don't know how good you're be at the moment but
S0345	i'm too full
S0344	i'm fuck stuff
S0336	mm
S0345	i actually can't really be late
S0344	and 's
S0337	we erm
S0344	's gotta go cos she's gotta pack for her holiday tomorrow
S0336	yeah
S0344	so
S0336	i actually
S0336	really wanna i don't know if you've see it advertise you know zane lowe's rescored drive
S0337	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0345	what
S0336	erm the movie drive
S0345	yeah
S0336	erm zane lowe's basically rescored it so like you know like the soundtrack
S0345	yeah
S0336	the music that happen in the background they've erm he's commission a load of artists to write brand new music specifically for that film and they're show the film tonight on bbc three at ten
S0345	oh god
S0336	with a completely new soundtrack all new music from different artists
S0337	but we really like that film
S0336	i love it's
S0345	that's quite a cool idea though isn't it
S0336	it's one of my favourite film and the soundtrack
S0337	yeah but
S0336	the original soundtrack
S0337	the soundtrack be amaze
S0336	be amaze so it's kind of one of those ideas like
S0337	and make the film
S0336	i think it's i like i don't like the idea cos i'm like why mess with something that's already that good but i'm so intrigue to see what it's actually like
S0345	you gonna watch it
S0337	yeah
S0336	that i'm gonna have to watch it yeah because it's so it's such an iconic movie like there's no have you watch it there's like
S0345	i probably have but
S0337	there's barely any dialogue
S0345	i've get the worst memory
S0336	there's no dialogue basically so it's all about the music and it's so like it's so intense
S0345	what happen in it
S0336	it's basically it's ryan gosling and he the whole thing be that he drive like he drive kind of kind of semi professionally so he do
S0345	oh i think i have see it
S0336	he's like a stunt man in movies and he do like er job for people if they're like rob bank and all this kind of shit
S0337	he's a getaway driver basically
S0336	yeah erm but he end up he live in some like shitty flat end up befriend a female neighbour whose husband's go to prison for one thing or another and her son and it's kind of all about like their relationship
S0345	yeah i have see this
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah but it's so intense and so like moody and it's all like it's all about the soundtrack and i don't know how but then
S0345	you seem really excite about this thing
S0336	i know because zane lowe be talk about it and i didn't i think he'd just like chuck a load of music over the top of it and i think oh i don't like the sound of it but what he be say be that he give the movie to these band and say write music for that scene
S0345	who be who be the band
S0336	erm there's like load of different load and load of different people like er
S0337	chvrches bastille
S0336	yeah what's it like something or on the horizon or something
S0337	bring me the horizon
S0336	yeah
S0345	zane lowe's decent though
S0336	he know what he's do and he's pick like the 1975 i think he's pick like load of different
S0336	really different type of music
S0337	modern
S0345	do you you like him
S0337	what
S0345	do you say no you don't like zane lowe
S0337	erm
S0336	he's a bite intense as a person
S0345	yeah
S0337	yeah he's
S0345	he's a bite weird
S0336	erm but he do
S0337	he's very opinionated
S0336	he do know his music
S0337	but he know he know music
S0336	yeah and he's basically like i say he's give this film to band and he's say right i want you to write a song for this scene
S0345	mm
S0336	and they've actually write like it's brand new music so it's not as if they've go oh well here's a song off my album
S0345	yeah
S0336	they've actually like write music for it so i'm like that could actually be quite cool
S0345	so be you gonna watch that
S0336	so i'm gonna watch and that's on at ten so yeah
S0336	it could be shit because i think it might be shit but
S0345	but you'd still you need to watch it
S0336	exactly
S0345	you can't not watch it
