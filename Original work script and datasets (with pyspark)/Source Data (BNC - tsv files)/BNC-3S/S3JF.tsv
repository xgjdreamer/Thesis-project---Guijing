S0192	i just need to print off one thing or with the student loan now dad i've give them my brighton address so hopefully they'll stop hassle you after that
S0227	so yeah well it's never really be a hassle
S0192	yeah i've wonder if you've get random phone call about me
S0227	no
S0190	no
S0192	random call cos you haven't that's amaze because the amount of time i've put your number down cos so many things require a number and i the only number i have in the uk i've give yours but i've worry that maybe you've have random phone call from people or
S0227	no no no no only erm
S0190	they never once ask for you
S0227	here's a pen
S0192	oh i know i'm popular
S0227	do you er you couldn't remember your mum's obviously when you be
S0192	good god it's yellow
S0227	yes this be the elephant elephant
S0192	really
S0227	you put you put it might be your mum's cos er address ours be the same number eight
S0192	yeah
S0227	but it be you couldn't remember
S0192	no no no oh what for the
S0227	the time you be travel
S0192	no yeah i remember yours well but i don't remember i i remember mum's but i couldn't be a hundred percent certain of it
S0227	well
S0192	and that's where my bag's go and i be just like i defiantly know dad's off my heart and i know the telephone number off by heart
S0227	yeah and actually you've be travel for quite some time you're quite tire you're think
S0192	i be knackered
S0227	i'll default with what i know rather than what i think i know
S0192	terrible they so many of our bag go miss so many of us so i have a connection in moscow from seoul so i fly nine hours to moscow by the time i land in moscow it be already like midnight my time so i be already kind of tire and then we have to run like mad cos they only give us a one hour transfer
S0227	that's tight
S0192	which be tight yeah and moscow sheremetyevo or something airport be notoriously busy and notoriously not good just in general and we leave late so we actually arrive when we arrive it be board my flight it have just start board so we run like mad through the airport and then get to for some reason even though we weren't check in we be just transfer they still ask for our passports and they still security check us which add even
S0227	do they scan
S0192	no no we just pass through we kinda have to queue jump so we run l like mad and it be horrible and obviously none of our bag make it so anyone who do that connection with us which be about eight people nobody get their bag and then i bump into some other people that have a have a similar connection they'd fly from china not from korea to moscow connect with a one hour connection and none of their bag arrive either so there be about thirty of us forty of us that just didn't have our bag it's ridiculous
S0190	mm
S0227	i be slightly concern you about your flight path only slightly because of the ukraine
S0192	what's be go with russia
S0227	plane that get shoot down over the ukraine
S0192	yeah it concern me as well a little a little obviously be still a little she doesn't take fly too well
S0227	no
S0192	really she make me nervous
S0227	you could have in your time
S0192	i think that's the problem i think you start think law of average something's go to happen at some point if we keep fly you've get my mobile number now though
S0227	yes that's all key in
S0192	yay i have a phone
S0227	and i put it on to 's i'll get 's as well cos i mean
S0192	yeah i'll take definitely if you've get your number
S0227	there's yeah a possibility that erm you might not be able to get hold of me but erm
S0192	that would be a great save
S0227	if you
S0190	you won't at the weekend because you switch it off
S0227	cos yeah as i say
S0192	do you both switch them off at the weekend
S0227	no no

S0190	stupid it well you want to
S0192	forty pence a minute it's go up quite badly i mean last time i have a mobile phone it be about five pence a minute or something why it's forty pence a minute
S0190	because you like you're do pay as you go

S0227	it can be warm but not hot
S0190	but it's not it's not as to as it have be
S0192	no
S0190	i mean it be quite so that you really couldn't do an awful lot

S0227	you wouldn't be sick it's that strong but she be be sick
S0192	that be bad
S0227	so yes it be a lot of
S0192	brilliant turn around

S0192	exactly
S0190	yeah
S0192	so he'll turn thirty before i do
S0227	yeah
S0192	thirty i'm not scar about forty a little bite just cos i think it's only a year and a half until i'm thirty and then it's only another ten years till i'm forty and the last ten years have go really quickly from eighteen to twenty eight so
S0227	yes it's yeah
S0192	if it do that again when i'm forty it's completely terrible

S0192	no
S0227	yes we get it last year eh sorry this year i've get to cut some off erm in in two months' time i'll plant garlic again for to harvest next year right erm place to start
S0192	er i've get to sign a contract it's a a little annoy i'm a freelancer i have to do my own tax now just cos of this
S0227	yeah but you're not go to earn enough to pay tax
S0192	no no
S0227	well i pay tax
S0192	i mean i've i've work out if i can well the you have to earn less than ten thousand pound isn't it
S0227	well i say i i can hear eleven thousand four hundred pound after i have to start pay tax
S0192	yeah
S0227	so
S0192	but basically i i'm hop that and i can earn i mean a maximum a hundred pound a week each
S0227	yes this will not take you this will not trip
S0192	but the problem be it may a little bite because for their ease they've put and i on one contract this be elect to the both of us but this be a contract just for me
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	so all the money be come to me
S0227	what whatever tax you pay will get back
S0192	yeah
S0227	you you're go to be under your
S0192	well i'm not pay they're not tax me
S0227	no oh we
S0192	i'm have to file my own tax at the end of the year
S0227	yes well you're go to be under the threshold
S0192	yeah erm eighteen pound an hour they pay every one hour of record yeah i have to put in an extra half an hour per record to listen through it and cut bits and edit bits and erm write i have to fill out some form for every single thing that i send in general it's another i reckon another half an hour per for every hour that i record
S0190	it's not bad though be it
S0192	it's a pretty good job yeah
S0227	expect another expect an
S0192	i don't have to go for job interview i don't have to worry about teach or meet new students or wear a suit or do anything
S0227	and it's also better than have to be in bar or say would you like french fry with that
S0192	oh yeah no absolutely
S0227	it's the sort of thing you would have
S0192	and it's in my field yeah i can put down that i be a researcher for cambridge university press
S0227	yes
S0192	for their corpus linguistics
S0227	yeah
S0192	and what's better i couldn't believe when they first tell me but i be say okay firstly can i be in the record be that okay yeah you can be in the record can i how how many time can i record the same people unlimited amount of time okay and
S0227	well every conversation's different isn't it
S0192	well how many how many record can i send you as many as you can until next june so i've get and i get pay eighteen pound an hour so if i can just do five hours of record a week that's a hundred pound a week
S0190	so what do it record on to
S0192	mp3
S0190	oh right
S0192	so i'm record onto an mp3 they've give me a dropbox link so i upload my record file the speaker consent form and also the the form for everyone every month at the begin of the month i upload them with my invoice and then at the end of the month they pay me
S0190	mm
S0192	and i've get until june next year which be basically until i finish my degree so
S0190	yeah
S0192	it's perfect
S0227	it will help
S0190	yeah it's a good thing
S0192	i contact them today about transcribe cos somebody after somebody's go to listen to this afterwards and then turn it into a different alphabet i don't know if you know ipa but if you look in a dictionary sometimes there'll be how you pronounce the word and you
S0190	yeah
S0192	it's it's in a different alphabet
S0190	yeah
S0192	i can read and write that and i use it to teach like pronunciation because english orthography on english spell doesn't line up with pronunciation
S0190	no
S0192	you have a g and an h and it make an f sound
S0190	right
S0192	so i teach with this different alphabet and they're go to be pay other freelancers to listen to these and type them up in this phonetic alphabet so i contact her today and say look maybe i'm not quite qualify yet but maybe you know once i'm further headlong into my course maybe if i i have quite an interest in phonology can i get involve with with transcribe
S0190	oh right
S0192	i wonder if they how much they pay for that if they pay an hour just to transcribe cos transcribe it would be difficult i think sit down for each hour
S0190	yeah
S0192	so you'll be you will all be cement in history
S0227	yes
S0192	the cambridge british national corpus two thousand and fourteen if historians ever want to wonder what we sound like in the year two thousand and fourteen they'll hear us
S0227	if i if i remember i be be record i'd have use bigger word
S0192	there be some sociolinguistic variables that they're look into they do ask your education your age what you perceive your accent to be how long you've live in your location these kind of things so i guess they're go to look at what colloquialisms do you use
S0227	yes
S0192	what your accent be what these kind of things but but regard the content they're not use that at all it's just how you sound the word that you use
S0227	you need to get on this cos she's get a bite some of those word that she use erm
S0190	ain't can't shalln't and not gonna
S0227	yeah
S0192	what be these word
S0190	ain't can't shalln't and not gonna that's where they say like instead of i can't it's i can't
S0192	can't
S0190	i can't
S0192	and that's predominantly in not around any other areas
S0227	its like colloquial dialect
S0192	because i will have to do my thesis and chance be it'll be on some kind of sociolinguistic variation and if i can find that this area hasn't be properly mark as an accent or a dialect but but do have enough grammar or syntactical differences to make it its own dialect then i can potentially do my thesis on that interest i might have to ask you a bite more about that or record this lady do you think you and dad have the same accent
S0190	sorry
S0192	do you think you and dad have the same accent
S0190	no erm because i've be here a lot longer i've be here thirty five odd years now
S0227	this be gonna have to be green er yellow
S0192	thirty five years in
S0190	yeah erm so i think i pick it up and use probably some of the slang as i call it
S0192	vernacular yeah
S0190	yeah whereas your dad doesn't
S0192	no
S0190	no doesn't i don't think i've never hear him say can't i know i say it
S0192	no you say it sometimes yeah it slip
S0190	yeah erm
S0192	so you think you say it more than he do purely because you've live here longer
S0190	probably
S0192	yeah
S0190	yeah
S0192	i mean what word be there i mean i know we drop our ts terribly computer

S0192	yeah okay
S0227	although er erm you know so everything he say i don't take it seriously but erm like i say the point that he be he do he do share the family surname so er
S0192	yeah there aren't many of us and if or i never have children well it's soon to die out
S0227	well no erm go back to my half sister i believe have a child so from my dad the baton will have be on on from his dad definitely cos 's have so many children and so many grandchildren
S0192	yeah
S0227	she's get load so er yes i could genetically hit the buffer after you two if you don't have children
S0192	i'm sure will have children
S0227	i don't think erm you know at the end of the day grandchildren be nice i'm sure i'm go to get grandchildren from some quarter you know anyway but erm if you two don't erm deliver erm
S0227	it just er i'm sure your mum will be that's why she have plan c just in case plan a or plan b didn't work out
S0192	yeah weren't pan out
S0227	unfortunately she'll be too old if she's alive to know much about her plan c's grandchildren unless he do a and pop them off
S0192	yeah i can't believe he's have children no and i have be quite seriously discuss children lately and
S0227	oh you what
S0192	maybe at the age of forty
S0227	your biological clock isn't tick hers be
S0192	hers be we just say we'll probably adopt if we end up have children
S0227	wow
S0192	just when we're forty or something and then at least we can choose and we be think if i think the best time to adopt a child would be just before they go to university
S0192	so if i pay for them to go to uni and then we've get an agreement go on and then they just pay they sort us out when we're old
S0227	when you're old yeah that's what they say be nice to your parent erm to your children cos there's the ones that choose what old people's home you're go to go in
S0192	i think i leave my glass of water somewhere
S0190	erm
S0227	you leave it upstairs
S0190	upstairs yeah
S0192	shall i grab it
S0190	it's up to you
S0192	i'll leave this on so continue
S0190	alright thank you
S0227	yes do you your mum wouldn't have come today i i i try i ring about between twelve and one she must have be in the garden or out or something
S0190	well i be just come in the front door and the erm and i hear the phone and by the time i'd walk from the front door to the phone it have stop
S0227	i do ring from work
S0190	you didn't phone back
S0227	i sorry
S0190	you didn't
S0227	no cos i think er well i think something crop up
S0190	i be go to say cos if anything have happen you'd
S0227	yeah
S0227	i just assume you be with your mum it be that you'd see her the day before erm something crop up and i i i didn't give it another think
S0190	i just walk into town
S0227	oh right you fitzwilliam or do you go the long way now
S0190	no fitzwilliam
S0227	just up the hill
S0190	yeah i want to get 's birthday card and erm things
S0192	these orchids be lovely
S0227	do you think that erm have erm change
S0192	erm i've see him on skype so not lot
S0227	i think that erm he will have more of a relationship with cos 's there erm it's it's probably awkward for you not for him but for you because mum mum will subconsciously be try to blend you two
S0192	yeah it's not that subconscious it's quite overt
S0227	and erm for you he will a brother's the person that you be punch in the back of the car
S0192	yeah
S0227	and erm make them eat erm chili pepper and try to tell them that they be something else and things like that you know through experience
S0192	yeah
S0227	this be this be what erm
S0190	you must have miss him out on here
S0227	this be what erm galvanise
S0190	and the only reason i've get it on for be because i think the erm jackpot be fifteen and a half thousand pound and i just want to see it's not very often it get up that high but it must be something else
S0192	sorry you want to turn it up i can stop this
S0190	no no it's finish now
S0192	be you sure
S0190	yeah
S0192	sorry if you miss it
S0190	no it's alright i just want i don't listen to it intently it's thank you it's just habit but it's they don't very often win very much like this time they've just win a thousand pound
S0192	fifteen grand
S0190	and it get to fifteen and a half and i just think oh but it must have be somebody else unless we've miss the one do we have it on yesterday i can't remember
S0227	er no we miss it erm just come to the end erm yes i think it's it's experience like that that galvanise erm i treat more as a brother than my own half brother
S0192	because you go through more with him
S0227	because i grow up with him so and i've always kind of continue to see him you know there hasn't there's probably not be hardly erm there's probably only be about three three years in the last since sixty nine
S0190	be that alright
S0227	that i haven't see them
S0190	the onions be
S0192	yeah the onions be go into my eye as well
S0190	yeah they make mine sore
S0227	erm so yeah so i don't think your mum do it consciously it's probably but like you say things have to be natural if they you you can't make round peg go into square hole there's you know but i think erm there will be more of a relationship between him and because they have live sometime together there be like with my own half brother it be my blood but we don't have a common erm upbringing we can talk about the same father but that's about it really you know but i accept him and there be that bond because if someone walk in the room and they're look for mr me and him will turn our head when if that be the situation in say ten years' time will not turn his head
S0192	no i'm i'm not gonna know him obviously erm i can't see myself live close enough even if i do live in england i still wouldn't see him very much
S0227	no i just don't see you live in england to be fair
S0192	no
S0227	this be a stage this be a stag post
S0192	maybe
S0190	be that sun in your eye do you want the blind down
S0227	somewhere else
S0192	no it's okay as long as i don't there you go perfect be you sure
S0190	i don't know if it's the right one
S0192	no it's the other one i think

S0190	hopefully um i've try everything i've do i try put it in the lounge i try change it in different position in the window i just nearly lose it and then your dad say well i'll take it and and he report it and it be because it be shoot no end of new shoot out but as fast as it shoot the new shoot all the old ones the leave be just fall off any time you get anywhere near it

S0192	there's there's the first round one person be give you're each give a loyalty card and there's only one cylon in the whole game of four people and you get the loyalty card twice in a game so potentially at the begin nobody's a cylon but you don't know

S0190	oh right
S0192	like the robot bad guy so

S0227	mother tongue
S0192	if somebody ask you what your mother tongue be
S0190	english
S0192	english then write english
S0227	she speak it like a native
S0192	dad you male or female

S0192	hermaphrodite birth place
S0227	erm erm erm erm
S0190	that's a county
S0227	yeah
S0192	mother tongue english
S0192	which country have most influence your language or the way you speak i mean you be say earlier a bite of american
S0227	america american yeah
S0192	so would you say you're kind of yeah
S0227	yeah
S0192	by american dialect
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i'm go to say english american dialect
S0190	accent
S0192	what would you consider your accent
S0190	i don't think i particularly have an accent
S0192	well you tell me earlier that you have a bite of a twang
S0227	well she use some of the word possibly
S0190	well but then it's not really an accent be it
S0192	again this be your perception
S0190	right
S0192	they might even be interest in what do you think your own accent be over what it actually be so what's your
S0227	i wouldn't say i wouldn't say i have an accent
S0192	so if i ask you dad what's your accent or your dialect
S0227	i don't have one i don't think er
S0192	okay interest i don't have one
S0227	i don't really have one i night have one but i wouldn't know it
S0190	i have to think about that
S0192	linguistically you absolutely have one everyone have an accent but because you believe that you have receive pronunciation which be the the elite form that that's have no accent or dialect
S0227	yes
S0192	everyone have an accent everyone have a dialect
S0190	so how many months or years have you live there as in the town or the country
S0192	it's a very debatable question that everyone's be get confuse by that i get people to draw a little arrow and do the one for the country and then do an arrow for the town if it be different
S0190	right okay so
S0192	i guess if you've live in the same place your whole life you could just write one but if you've live in england longer than you've live in then maybe write two
S0190	right
S0192	with a little arrow
S0190	england fifty five years

S0192	well they be so expensive in korea to get a can a bean
S0227	yes
S0192	whereas i could get a bag of dry bean

S0192	it be much easier same with garbanzo bean chickpeas
S0227	you're you're go to obviously be able to erm get source things much cheaper than er
S0192	yeah i've be really please i go to lidls the other day and be like ah food be a lot more than i've be use to
S0227	yes
S0192	sometimes we it be so seasonal that we could buy a kilo of potatoes for fifty p or a kilo of potatoes for four or five pound it be like
S0227	yeah
S0192	really change
S0227	i i once pick up a carrot one i mean it be a big carrot but it be like three pound for one carrot
S0192	what in in
S0227	in korea
S0192	if it's out of season it just like shoot but the problem be it can spike from week to week it just like really jump on us one week you go in and celery's a pound for a bunch the next week it's three or four pound for a bunch
S0227	yeah so there's no
S0190	do they grow anything like this in the actual country or be it all import
S0192	they that's the thing the the price my
S0227	they grow everything
S0192	they grow a lot they grow a lot of what they can but there's no way that they're grow as much as they say they're grow the amount of the amount that they eat i don't see where all these farmers be come from they eat so much pork and i've never see a pig in the entire country so they must import that from china but they do have farm everywhere they have a lot smaller farm it's not like one person farm everything it's like wherever there's a free spot of land the local people be farm something but it's it's kind of the same crop they do a lot of pumpkin a lot of courgette a lot of chillies and green onion all that kind of stuff but they don't vary on the local farm they don't really vary on what they cook it's just kind of there for their food
S0190	right
S0192	so things like broccoli and cauliflower they be farm there but not as commonly so they're more expensive and they're more
S0227	the season
S0192	watermelon you can buy humongous i'm not even joke be about that big they're about two pound two pound fifty in the height of the summer but then off season it'll be about twenty pound for like one thing
S0190	what
S0192	oh no joke it go up to like forty thousand yuan like twenty pound
S0227	god
S0190	do you buy in bulk from school
S0192	yes yeah i have to so i buy celery when it's cheap and then i get home and i freeze the leave so i use the leave for like soup and stuff and then i blend with a bite of water the rest of the celery
S0227	yeah
S0192	and freeze it so then i can use it later i have to do that with coriander as well cos it's really hard to come back
S0227	yes cilantro
S0192	so when i get it buy a lot of it freeze it use it
S0227	yeah it be expensive i try to grow i mean that little jar will be about in eighty nine coriander
S0192	coriander
S0227	yeah and that jar of kaffir lime leave
S0192	mustardy almost
S0227	will will be at the same price all curry leave
S0192	yeah yeah these be really expensive
S0227	hence that's why
S0192	why i might steal some
S0227	i crop them
S0192	you go in sainsbury's there's about four leave in for about ten pound
S0190	of right yeah
S0227	yeah i mean i've get some dry i you i don't actually use dry i like to have it freeze and thing but i you can have all it should be okay cos this be hot and they be dry they should be

S0227	yeah freeze it straight away
S0192	freeze the the fresh ones
S0227	the ones that i bring down with me on that day freeze freeze that

S0192	the curry that i want to cook be erm probably my favourite curry ever
S0227	be it massaman
S0192	in no no it's an indonesian curry call a rendang and you take i get like a kilo of beef steak i really tenderise it and then cook it really high erm take that off and then the sauce be really easy to make but it's the same as any kind of other green curry you've get your onions red chillies in this one erm ginger or galangal kaffir lime leave lemon grass tamarind it do have so it's a bite sweeter but the spice that go into it be it have a lot of cinnamon in it have a lot of cardamom in it which give it a real lemon kick
S0227	yeah
S0192	and it have quite a bite of cleave in it as well
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm but you normally for me cleave be really really strong
S0227	no nut
S0192	no it doesn't have any nut
S0227	no cos i be go to say doesn't like nut in you don't like nut do ya
S0192	massaman no not the rendang
S0190	i like nut but don't like i don't like the the peanut curry
S0192	no and then you just add a lot of coconut cream cook it really really low for about four hours so all of the sauce go away until there's just a thick dark browny red paste that's on it and right at the end you turn it up really high and caramelise the the beef in its own fat and it's so good
S0227	sound nice
S0192	it's so flavoursome it's like way more flavoursome than almost every other curry i've ever have but it be sweet the cinnamon and the tamarind do make it kind of sweet
S0227	have you get two room
S0192	it's counter by the cleave though
S0227	two bedrooms in your house
S0192	no one seven hundred and fifty pound a month one room
S0227	oh right
S0192	it's quite spacious though everywhere we be look
S0190	the room look quite big on the picture you send
S0192	oh do you see the photos yeah
S0190	yeah
S0192	it won't be amaze but it be really problematic try to find a flat from out there and i'm glad we do it in advance
S0227	from from the other side of the from the other side of the world yeah
S0192	yeah nobody trust us local landlords would lead us along and they'd be like no i want someone local and i'm like tell them i've get the money i can give you the money right now
S0227	and and and we're teachers you know do you go to school
S0192	they basically just ignore us and just be like you're foreign i don't trust you effectively and then same through the let agency they didn't really trust us either so we have to have so much paperwork behind us and like it be a real stress get everything send over and
S0227	yeah
S0192	i have to get my boss involve in korea and you know they tell you they want erm your bill statements to prove that i'd be live in this residence in korea and i'm tell them i don't pay for bill it's all include in my thing
S0227	it's all yeah
S0192	okay well we want bank statements from your bank i don't get bank statements in korea we don't have them
S0227	no
S0192	so have to go into the bank and ask for special form and
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	like scan and all this
S0227	yeah
S0192	it go on and on and on and then they fail us so we send them all this information i send them the detail of how much save i have which be easily enough for the whole year
S0227	mm
S0192	and they fail us but they didn't tell us they fail us and then what really annoy me be this third party company this this agency that reference check us be not allow to tell us the result they could only tell the agency and the agency be like on holiday so they wouldn't tell me what the result be and i'm think i pay you i give you a lot of my personal and sensitive information
S0227	yes
S0192	and and you're tell me that you can't you're not at liberty to give my information so if the reason they do it be because the let agency can just tell you what they want to tell you so even if this company pass me they can still request that i get guarantors and all these kind of things
S0227	yeah
S0192	so they can still fail me so they do that system so it's at their discretion to
S0190	i suppose though it's like everything isn't it all these like erm health and safety and all that it's all do because people have mess people around
S0192	yeah
S0190	and they've get to find a way to cover it
S0192	i think it's do as well to make more job we we need more there's more and more people we need more and more job so you get inspectors inspect inspectors do something else cos you need to make the job so it keep be more and more third middle men
S0227	yeah
S0192	cos you need to put somebody in the middle to make another job
S0190	yeah
S0227	yeah
S0190	yeah somebody you can blame
S0192	so
S0227	another middle man middle men everywhere they make them you'll sit here
S0192	yeah i'll sit there
S0192	so i find out why they erm fail me and my save hadn't be in my bank account for long enough on the the thing be i send them save from like months ago and i have the money in my account then but the most recent one i have nothing in my account really and then the money appear in my account only a few days before now if they tell me this before fail me i'd have rectify the problem i'd have be like yeah i'll send you you know i'll tell you why but actually i'd just come back from cambodia and in cambodia i don't keep all my save in the bank account i'm use because that would be dangerous if somebody take my bank card empty my account
S0227	yes yes yes
S0192	so i move it to my own digital account
S0227	yes
S0192	and then when i get home i move it back in again
S0227	yes
S0192	so i explain that to them and i send them copy of the digital account i move it into so we get pass in the end
S0227	yes
S0192	it be just a lot of effort it go on for about two weeks of solidly call them and you know
S0227	bite of a palaver yeah
S0192	it be a real palaver i think it would be easy i think if i come home with enough money to pay for my rent twice out you'd think you'd think they'd just be like
S0227	yeah you think money talk you think money talk
S0190	you're a student
S0192	yeah go for it but no they just go no so we manage to get around i didn't want dad to have to go through the hassle of a guarantor so we end up pay i've pay them eight months in advance
S0227	yeah although that be an available with this so yeah i do say i'd do that
S0192	it be just and for us i didn't want another week of stress think be dad go to be pass be this go to go through
S0190	yeah be your dad go to be pass yeah dodgy
S0192	i didn't want him to go through the same rigmarole that we just have to go through so
S0227	neither do i
S0192	well like 's parent be really happy to do it but we be genuinely concern that they might fail 's dad be retire and never have earn very much
S0227	yeah
S0192	so his pension wasn't particularly high and 's mum work part time
S0227	yes
S0192	so
S0190	and the oven's hot don't touch the plat alright
S0192	i be not convince that i wasn't convince 's parent be gonna pass and then if we fail our own reference and they fail a reference we're definitely not go to get it
S0190	i be gonna say you don't get no
S0227	right
S0192	well thankfully that's in the past be we have it with rice
S0227	yes yes
S0192	look forward to it hungry
S0227	yeah sorry for the delay guy it be i put the bean in too late
S0192	no don't be silly
S0227	i'd already put them in simmer in the process if i can like go just here by myself just hand's like normally what happen when i cook and the weather's okay and i'll be do something in the garden so i i i go for a methodical way of do things
S0192	yeah
S0227	if i start talk the the methodology get a bite erm it will all go in i don't hence the chocolate i forget the chocolate
S0190	busy talk and you forget the
S0227	but i remember it in time it's just that not in the sequence that i would have do it
S0192	yeah last few time he's pick me up we've go a bite wrong on the journey
S0227	on the sit nav yeah
S0192	overshoot that one overshoot this one
S0227	yes i mean hopefully you're unfamiliar
S0192	fun to
S0227	unfamiliar road talk and the sit nav's scream at you as well it's too much information come in
S0192	well nowadays it seem with the sit navs that people cannot pay as much attention to you get catch talk whereas i think before the sit navs probably at the time dad've be like i need to do this bite now i need to concentrate here we can't talk now
S0190	concentrate yeah
S0192	but instead we're like oh the sit nav'll tell us and we'll just go on cos mum do exactly the same thing with erm
S0227	do she pick you up or
S0192	yeah she she pick me up with and erm
S0227	oh right okay
S0192	be navigate with the sit nav and we be talk and they go wrong and sit nav send her down some wrong road and we have to go back up the junction a few miles and then come back again
S0190	mm we do that when we be go to erm with my sister
S0227	yeah
S0190	and we be in convoy the two cars and we just it's such a bad turn off to the airport
S0190	when you get there that erm and we miss it and we have to go ten miles out of our way to come back
S0192	oh god
S0227	didn't we laugh
S0192	so it's another twenty miles
S0190	mm
S0227	yeah
S0190	no we didn't laugh dear
S0227	at the time that's what i mean i be be er i be be sarcastic
S0227	at the end of the day it be just a simple mistake and you go okay fine better go down turn round but oh christ it's almost ten miles to the next junction and then we've gotta come back up again so you're think okay we leave a reasonable time for the plane you know
S0192	yeah
S0227	but you don't want to be push it right to the wire
S0192	that's where would come unstuck he be still last minute dot com travel
S0227	yes

S0192	and then he barely make that flight either because he again he decide to take an eight hour bus journey
S0227	mm
S0192	on the same day as his flight
S0227	mm
S0192	so i be tell him you're you're what if you get stick in traffic or you

S0227	mm mm
S0192	and he again have to rush and like make it with like
S0227	yeah
S0192	five minutes to go
S0227	well it's just er you're put yourself under a lot of stress
S0192	it's gonna end up cost you more money
S0227	yeah
S0192	cos it's gonna things be gonna go wrong
S0227	yeah i'm glad that he
S0192	guarantee
S0227	he be talk about go to spain to see this girl and i say cos i be a bite concern that he might get derail from the mission but
S0192	i be think that too
S0227	yeah
S0192	just start travel and not really
S0227	yes but he the the mission be you know he give up work because he er have the goal and the er and the the the the mean to achieve that goal the vehicle to achieve that goal be go to university to get a degree
S0192	mm
S0227	you know but if he get side track with either the the spanish or someone at university be gonna divert him from that mission he have to remain focus yes have some fun and especially like the first week when you have fresher and stuff like that but the mission wasn't to meet you weren't go to university to meet girls
S0192	no
S0227	you be go to go there to get a degree you can get the
S0192	that's an ancillary mission
S0227	yeah you can get the girls afterwards you know there'll be always girls available
S0192	yeah
S0227	so get your erm but he be concern initially about he delay it and i be say look delay it because you're not gonna be an old student not by any stretch and but you're gonna be older than a few of you peer and so the these young ladies'll all look up to you anyway as a bite of a man of the world
S0227	cos you will be a bite of a man of the world compare to them
S0192	mm
S0227	but erm obviously once get it into his head i say well as long as you've you've map it out and you can afford to do it i've i've give him a i'm give him a customary cursory erm some money in september
S0192	yeah he tell me
S0227	because i couldn't do nothing for him when i i didn't give you money but i give you something else i give you the the house and and i would pay the bill and i think erm i can't just do nothing
S0192	there be a bite of a catch twenty two though with that house
S0227	mm
S0192	because the only reason i be stay in the house be to save money to go to university have i have the
S0227	yes
S0192	money to go to university i wouldn't have need to stay
S0227	yes
S0192	in the house

S0192	i mean i'd have just go i would've go to uni it be a bite of a catch twenty two
S0227	it be it be the i know it be the only way er that i could actually do something
S0192	mm
S0227	you know
S0192	i realize that
S0227	by hold onto the place and continue to to pay the bill
S0192	i'm definitely glad you do i don't know where i would've go
S0227	yeah
S0192	i think have you sell that place and move to
S0227	mm
S0192	i wouldn't have live with mum i wouldn't have live with you i don't think i'd have make it to uni i'd have probably just
S0227	though your life probably erm erm your
S0192	become an alcoholic on the local banker's draft or whatever
S0227	well they obviously the the breakdown of your er er your mum's and i's marriage forge you to be the kind of person you be now you would've be different er like be different before this be very extrovert
S0192	mm

S0227	mm
S0192	that still cost thirty pound return or something so but i'll see him as much as i can
S0227	mm
S0192	and erm i guess it'll be easier for everyone else to come and visit as well cos we won't be too far away
S0190	well

S0227	you know cos it be hot the windows be open and er i i call he saw me i saw him and he spin round and er cos it be er we stay at er in halls you know erm erm for erm we manage to get a deal
S0192	yeah
S0227	erm so we stay er there but nice town but lot of nightlife but obviously that's not gonna probably er appeal to you too much but
S0192	's
S0227	obviously there's er there's and you're gonna take them out and you know there there be plenty to do
S0192	yeah
S0227	er in in in the even
S0192	we've already book a few gigs and we're look forward to see some live music

S0227	it be quite a nice atmosphere erm be there even you know because it have be a hot summer you know it be like the thirty first of august we go or first of september and it be it be hot you know
S0192	mm
S0227	it be still nice when erm two of us lay on the beach the next day
S0192	the beach can be quite busy can't it no i'm glad you like it
S0227	which be full of stone it's a stone beach
S0192	yeah it's a pebbly beach mm i'm glad you like it we would rather live somewhere a little touristy i guess it's generally a bite safer
S0227	yeah yes
S0192	a bite nicer but you pay for it
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's more expensive but it's a good uni we're go to so
S0227	when i take erm to erm er the the complex be erm
S0192	he really didn't like it the complex
S0227	i think it the erm i think what he didn't like be the fact that he felt it be too elite
S0192	he do too clinical too elite
S0227	yes too elite
S0192	i don't blame him
S0227	no
S0192	you wanna at least be study with like mind people not
S0227	mm i say to him at the end of the day i say you've get to make your decision base on what's best for you not like what's best for me or what's best for er
S0192	no
S0227	cos i think mum be plump for
S0192	mm
S0227	and i could've give a case for because it be a better university but i do think also it will be a lot easier for me to actually get to cos network to get the network be very bad from here to
S0192	mm
S0227	not good erm i get it that i i think to myself if er you know it's not an easy subject you're go to be it's a lovely er you know what sell it be the the facilities be be breathtaking you know it's like it be amaze er facilities they've get in that university
S0192	i go there quite a bite
S0227	and it's in
S0192	i use to go swim there
S0227	yes and it's in it's lovely but get there and then erm convince him you know i say erm don't let you be at er for uni er er uni for just a year convince you to do that don't er do what for whatever reason be best for you to to go to erm to whatever and he choose i say fine wherever it be i er i don't have a problem but i didn't want to er unduly influence him because of er i say to him that either way er it's not me or your mum go to university to do this course because we couldn't
S0192	it's you
S0227	so it's you and you've gotta do whatever it be that er cos i be look and i'm think i'm glad i'm not do this i'm think you know you you get er
S0192	it's interest that we choose those two universities actually there be have you hear of plate glass universities
S0227	no
S0192	they be make the sixties and there's only about eight of them
S0227	right
S0192	and they be design to be the most you know newest revolutionary universities
S0227	okay
S0192	my one be the first one that be make be the second one that be make and there's like five or six others that be make at this time in the sixties and they're all do pretty well
S0227	mm
S0192	and be like fairly neck and neck
S0227	mm
S0192	they're like twenty twentieth in the country
S0227	right
S0192	for some i'm at a really international one about a third of the population be international
S0227	yeah
S0192	that study there which be pretty high
S0227	which'll suit you cos you're you're kind of gear up for erm
S0192	one one in three people it push their international rank er seem to beat in the national rank
S0227	mm
S0192	but in the international rank a new one come out yesterday
S0227	yeah
S0192	be be eighteenth in the country and a a hundred and sixtieth in the world or something
S0227	yeah
S0192	wasn't even on it
S0227	no
S0192	so it's not on the list at all
S0227	no
S0192	and like that score in the top ten in england all the time on the national rank
S0227	mm
S0192	be like four hundredth in the world on the world rank
S0227	yeah
S0192	so they must rank them differently i don't really understand how the systems work
S0227	i can only imagine that er er come quite high in the in in er national and international
S0192	it seem it seem very fix to me
S0227	mm
S0192	when you look at these rank and like the top twenty in the world be always american and british
S0227	mm
S0192	you literally don't see any other country come into the top twenty ever
S0227	no
S0192	and then top hundred there'll probably be five countries in total
S0227	cos it
S0192	and it's mainly
S0227	it
S0192	eighty five per cent american and british
S0227	it will change because nothing stay the same
S0192	mm
S0227	be that alright be that alright
S0190	yes thank you
S0192	have you be to
S0190	not that i i think i have but i can't remember it at all
S0227	mm
S0192	it's mean to be nice there i think

S0227	yeah you prefer older students
S0192	i prefer work with adults
S0227	yeah
S0192	firstly they have more of a desire to learn and they know what their focus be

S0192	get that on
S0190	so if i have a room upstairs i can do my iron i can lay my card and that out and
S0192	the woman cave
S0190	yeah
S0227	she watch game of throne until erm erm sean bean die and he be behead and then sudden suddenly it be
S0192	i'm not interest any more
S0227	too much nudism there's too much nudism
S0190	it's not the nudism it's the
S0227	it's the swear
S0190	it like it it's the swear
S0227	there be a lot of profanity in it
S0190	there be and it's so well you watch it don't you you know what i'm say so i just i just won't watch in any more it's just there's no need for it there be absolutely no need we know it go on we know it do it we don't have to do it every other word and so i'm a bite it's for pleasure i'm not sit listen to it it's terrible
S0227	sometimes you won't get a swear word in the whole episode but whenever go in there to do it iron somebody will be there there's swear everywhere it's like they've save it up for that episode
S0192	just as you walk in
S0227	yeah
S0192	i can't say i've notice the swear in it but i'm quite desensitize to it so i haven't notice it at all but therefore perhaps i'm at the point where i don't notice it so it doesn't have any effect swear word be disempowered erm then you should be use more accurate adjectives to describe rather than just
S0190	you don't need to there's other word to
S0192	general word
S0190	yeah
S0227	normally people swear because they have a poor command of the language they just don't know the right adjective to use to describe whatever it be so they use these link word which can mean anything like you say about what
S0192	yeah
S0227	it can mean anything it doesn't you know they just use that as
S0192	fill a lexical function
S0227	yeah mm
S0192	i think they find though that with swear it be store in a slightly different part of the brain
S0227	mm
S0192	and you do revert to it in time of intense shock or pain or whatever it just kind of come out there word be store in different part
S0227	yeah like i swear i must have tell you this before i'd only it be a first christmas at 's obviously i'm mind my ps and qs and erm i swear at i i couldn't believe it in front of his her parent i go you bastard but it be a compliment but i couldn't believe i be shock because i be read the card and he didn't have the count hand that i think he have and he he do have this brilliant hand and i didn't see it and so it be it be a compliment like but i just say you bastard and realise what what i'd say
S0190	my my mum and dad do not swear ever
S0227	they're not release now they don't swear at all
S0192	no
S0190	i don't think my dad have have a couple of choice word in his time but they just don't
S0192	do he take you aside and say i'm not sure if this one's the one you need to get another one
S0190	no
S0227	fortunately i haven't i've manage to repair the the break mouth filter in that department and i've never ever swear in their
S0192	presence
S0227	presence again
S0190	we just to go through now everything jesus oh jesus christ so i say we we see my aunty if he do actually happen to be quite religious if you could please refrain from that this time
S0227	i didn't say jesus christ erm
S0190	so we're get a hold just take a while
S0227	in poor company i swear quite a lot
S0190	well you yeah yeah i i do i i kind of be a bite comedian like i whatever i'm my surround be i tend to do be drive downward or or upwards depend on
S0192	it have a term it's call accommodation you can either converge or diverge with people
S0227	yes
S0192	and you often it's subconscious people don't realise it do they
S0227	you try to to fit you're try to fit in yeah
S0192	they'll probably be listen to this to see if i'll make my accent sound more like somebody around me to fit in or if i'll diverge from them because i don't want to be see to be similar to them
S0227	yeah
S0192	sometimes you'll make you sound more posh because you don't want to sound like that rough guy so you kind of speak
S0227	mm when i'm speak to the operatives i'm i'm use profound word
S0192	yeah
S0227	because i'm try to communicate with them i'm not try to produce a stand offish erm them and us approach
S0192	you'd rather sound like a savant than an idiot savant
S0227	yeah yeah so i erm i mean i in the office now i i i'm i do tend to in the district manager he call me brain cos he go brain look come over here have a look at this and i go what be it
S0192	i'll wash up
S0190	no i'll do it
S0227	and he's no it's alright and he's like the district manager he'll default to me on on oh various things i mean him
S0192	brain from the thunderbirds brain from piggy and the brain or
S0227	we have erm er sometimes the tail try to wag the dog and one of these guy have make accusations it wasn't at me it be at one of my colleagues and er really what he be about five per cent of what he actually put in this cos he love to grandstand he give global email and he's give it to all the upper echelons and you're think that be for upper echelons so why be you bother me with this rubbish but he like to they give him oxygen of publicity so he continue to do it but with his erm with his erm accusations be this guy erm five percent of it be valid the rest of it he be talk it be a complete load of nonsense and i i just say in the mean time i say you know it's not you know say well i didn't know i say it afterwards not in his in his presence i say be a principle officer in the old school country er my pay grade be scale five which have five scale then you've get scale six which have five scale then you've get so one which be three scale then you've get so2 which be three scale and then you have po one he he's a technician but he's still under protect salary he's in po1 he be a big cheese at one time er in the authority but now he's just a he's a technician but it's massively it's a bite like erm erm mr white in break bad but the other way round he's he's extremely overpay for what he do rather than underpay
S0192	yeah okay
S0227	but he's a clever guy i say to erm i say erm you can an idiot can drive a car it deal with two dimension you go that way or you go that way he's get a pilot's license i say they don't give pilot license to imbeciles you've get to be clever to have a he's get his own plane he's get his own motorbike he's get his own car er you're deal with you're deal with three it's it's it's only a small plane but it's a plane he fly it you're deal with three dimension and they don't give pilot's license to idiots they can i've see some real dumb drive cars but you don't get stupid people who can fly it's too much go on
S0192	yeah
S0227	so yes i say yeah and the bloke be talk a load of rubbish he be ninety five percent of it be accusations worth completely wrong
S0192	unfounded
S0227	he be talk about say he should have more train the man have be in the job thirty five years he be a principle officer he doesn't need train at all
S0192	no
S0227	this bloke have only be in the have only be in the line of work for about five years and you're think no erm you're the one who's you know i i i just say it a eat i say why be we give this guy oxygen and publicity i'd ignore him you know just just ignore him so he's what he's do he's his his erm be erm reach be exceed his grasp he's do things that be not his brief what he's suppose to be do you know i'm say that that be annoy me but i be think yeah just do what you're suppose to be do don't start get involve in other things that you don't you know
S0192	what's happen since
S0227	er well nothing
S0192	as a result
S0227	nothing do happen really to be fair we we just like erm a report would go to and he's the top man and that would be about it really but you know you this bloke just get to sound off and i think to myself no this stick you know er he he's suppose to do a certain job and that's it he's he's try to branch into yeah he's empire build basically so i think to myself no just ignore him that's what i do
S0192	yeah i mean ignore him then i guess you need to ignore him
S0227	mm mm

S0192	i think that one might be a bite mouldy
S0227	yes i think that can be throw erm it be the last thing to go on the erm removal erm lorry
S0192	yeah sure
S0227	we have a lorry
S0192	yeah
S0227	we have so much stuff er we have stuff at and 's we have stuff at road we have stuff at er i think 's parents' and we have at ours
S0192	be road where use to live in
S0227	no road be be another erm erm they get a the company have get a property at which be on the industrial estate but they've also get another property in which they now disuse as storage and that's in road
S0192	yeah okay
S0227	so just be where um um um they just store stuff erm they don't have to do they ever trade out of
S0190	sorry
S0227	do they do your dad ever trade out of you know do the business from
S0190	he he work but er no it's not do that now
S0227	no
S0190	it's for storage
S0192	he do
S0227	cos they be base on bedford do you know road
S0192	yeah
S0227	well there be a place call on road by street erm um um he be close he be next door to that and the he move to at road
S0192	road be not the nicest part of really
S0227	no but i'm go back thirty years when it you you
S0192	it be probably a bite better
S0227	it wasn't er what it be today
S0192	so rough around the edge
S0227	now and then they move to erm road in er down by er if you come if you're come you you've you're drive in towards through you've just go past on your right hand side
S0192	yeah
S0227	you come to a set of light if you turn right that's down road you carry on the first the next right where there's a bicycle shop on the corner
S0192	yeah i know exactly where it be
S0227	that's road
S0192	okay
S0227	so they they have a company down there but then they move out to and on on to an industrial complex and trade form there
S0192	cool yeah move all this stiff must've be a bite of a pain in the arse
S0227	well it we it the logistics of sell two house at the same time with erm 's be ahead of mind in in in in the curve mean that we have to get all her stuff try and put it into our house
S0192	store it somewhere
S0227	but with two in one of them wasn't go to go so that mean we have to get it into storage which mean then when erm the house sell we then have to move again and get the pull all the stuff
S0192	yeah
S0227	from different place so sell a house be suppose to be stressful try sell two at the same time and then move into one know that all that hassle form within six weeks you're go to be do it again cos normally you think oh god thank god for that won't be do that for a few more years
S0192	it's mean to be one of the most stressful things isn't it i think move well move
S0227	one well one of the most yeah
S0192	move city i think be more stressful than move house
S0227	yes yes yes
S0192	nah i move i move country every year
S0227	well yeah move to and move back here again so that would imagine it won't be long before you start make plan for what happen after the master to get back on the
S0192	no i'll be apply for job after christmas
S0227	yes good man to that's why that fear with see your holiday but i say you've get to have a job and you know you like it if it i think he saw reason about go to spain i say if you can't afford it i i romantically i get it but practically you can't cos he be like try to be a bite evasive about pay mum rent i say you can't really you need to take seize manage that you go to her and say this be money and you sure as hell don't go on holiday again
S0192	no
S0227	and you're not give her a rent rent while you're there so er eventually she collar him
S0192	i just think it's a bad idea he he doesn't want to be go to uni tie up in a long distant relationship
S0227	no
S0192	with some girl that he barely know
S0227	no no cos i know he's like when he's over here the phone's go ping ping ping
S0192	yeah he's talk to her a lot
S0227	ping ping ping its
S0192	and i suppose in this day and age you can get to know someone pretty well
S0227	without actually ever meet them
S0192	without actually meet them but biologically you don't know if your body connect i don't think if you know if you actually get along or whatever
S0227	there's a lot of exactly there's when i meet you as the opposite sex there's a lot of things be transmit between us that we we're not detect
S0192	no your body's assess the other person's body
S0227	yes exactly erm pheromones and hormones and all sort of things that's to come over on skype
S0192	no not at all
S0227	yes you don't realise you're you're assess each other's compatibility even without say a word
S0192	yeah smell transmit a lot doesn't it
S0227	yes
S0192	i've wonder if
S0227	that's why keep tell me cor your breath stink
S0192	mm
S0192	i've wonder if you know a form of telepathy could be possible if you could hyper you know exacerbate those kind of imagine a creature that be so sensitive to its smell and could exude so many different smell like a cuttlefish see in different colour and like change its body its colour if we release different smell for different things and it be able to communicate enough information it would effectively look like telepathy
S0227	yes
S0192	it would look like i'm just stand here and i'm able to read things
S0227	yes
S0192	that be go off in your body but i'm pick it up through other cue
S0227	yeah yeah and you can say that that aside you're talk but
S0192	no
S0227	that stuff
S0192	i didn't realise how complex sign language be until i look at do some linguistics research it be grammatically syntactically morphologically as complex as a speak language it have as much grammar
S0227	yeah
S0192	it have as much derivation inflation everything it's get it have everything
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	it's insane it show you that again they're say in these book that erm yeah we shouldn't have be homo sapien we should have be homo loctous and it be like one of our most define feature be our ability to communicate
S0227	yes
S0192	and as clearly prove it's not just speak communication either cos if you remove someone's ability to hear then they learn sign language
S0227	yes
S0192	they just have to communicate
S0227	yes
S0192	there as part of main
S0227	the hardest way to communicate in a in a in a second language be on the phone
S0192	yeah
S0227	because you're not look at the person you're not you can use gesture and eye movement and that to help try and describe
S0192	even a bite of lip read
S0227	to describe what it be you're try to to convey where on the phone you don't see them it's just the you're deal with at voice and that's it there's no other communication go on in the background
S0192	it's definitely harder definitely harder
S0227	the old alarm start ping again i've get to change those
S0192	fire alarm
S0227	no the erm burglar alarm i get a
S0192	cos you be break into weren't you
S0227	yes hence we get the alarm there's a sensor on that door window there's a bite and there's one on 's on the woman cave door and then we've get two motion sensors one's in the hall one's in the lounge one of these four be battery's go and it the every night it it start this time isn't it it start talk
S0190	yeah just for some reason it just
