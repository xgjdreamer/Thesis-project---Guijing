S0520	i don't have it on most of the time
S0521	that's good to hear
S0520	at the moment i do because and i chat on the viber that be our long distance mean of communication
S0519	love affair
S0520	and love affair which be a valid thing to do
S0519	mm
S0520	but i get annoy with him because he when he's in israel be just constantly look at that thing
S0519	mm
S0521	there you go
S0520	and it do my head in and he can't multitask so if i want to say anything to him of any nature it's not
S0519	mm
S0521	be he a bite touchy
S0520	no he just doesn't he just doesn't hear what i'm at listen at all or hear any of it because he's star at his phone and it's go bing bong burr it do my head in
S0520	to be honest no if there's anything
S0521	you should give him a book on live in the now
S0520	well exactly
S0520	you can say that to him's a big fan of the old er total live concept
S0521	mm
S0520	he's in to it but i he could do without his phone

S0521	yeah that's not the point though be it
S0520	no it's addictive be the point and he's much more incline towards those type of things you know like erm i be go to say obsessive but that's a bite of a strong word
S0520	he just can't you know can't keep it under control very well sometimes i think
S0521	oh oh
S0520	and he do just switch his phone off in the even
S0519	good
S0520	which i think be the best solution you know cos then you're not tempt to kind of play with it and look at things
S0521	mm my approach be to switch off your phone the whole day and then deal with the email at the end of the day
S0520	mm
S0519	not if you're wait on something specialist removal company pickford's have you give up on them
S0521	no i haven't give up on them

S0519	mm
S0521	same thing
S0519	not your social life
S0520	your social life which be mum
S0520	i don't ever see you on trawl facebook and

S0520	cronies but erm
S0519	i'm get feed up with it now i've get too many friends that aren't friends that post nonsense
S0521	well that's the thing isn't it just become a general picture
S0519	you've get to cull your friends that's the way to do it
S0521	it's a little bite sad really people spend their day on facebook
S0520	mm
S0519	mm
S0521	they're lack something
S0519	mm cheek of it
S0521	mm
S0519	mm that toast be delicious
S0520	it's very nice yeah
S0521	it's good
S0520	do you make that toast dad be that expertly make by you
S0519	do you cut another onion
S0521	i'm not sure about your sarcasm
S0520	i learn from the master dad
S0521	could be a bite subtler i think
S0520	i believe it's a inherit genetic condition
S0519	shall i put another couple on oh no
S0520	erm yeah i'll have one more yeah i think you have to erm keep the role of electronic devices in your life in check
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	i think it's bad for your well be because it be addictive clearly for everyone
S0519	mm
S0521	it's a thing of who control who isn't it what control what
S0520	and it's and it affect your attention
S0519	it do and although i know you're joke about the facebook thing but you do the look things up thing and then you go on and on and on to another thing and another thing and then it's the same idea that you you've always get a device on your lap
S0520	yeah
S0521	mm that's true
S0520	yeah it doesn't matter what you're do with it really it's just it be
S0519	it's still idle wander
S0520	kind of like an open door to all kind of
S0521	interest trivia
S0520	interest things that may be social or knowledge or whatever
S0519	mm
S0520	it's important not to lose the ability to engage with your environment i be talk to erm 's brother in law about it his sister be quite strict with all of those stuff with her kid she doesn't let them watch telly she they don't have devices to play on and they the two of them don't do it either like they don't have iphones and all these things cos they and they actually make a decision about it together say that they didn't feel it be good for their kid and
S0521	mm
S0520	you know they it's important that you go out and your children be in the car you're not they're not star at a dvd they're look out the window and you're talk about the environment and you know just have a conversation with your children instead of i mean i i have have i er don't have kid so i can't i wouldn't at all venture to say and i have absolute sympathy for the stick the tv on method cos it's exhaust isn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	but they're very total about it and i think it's basically a much healthier way to grow up
S0519	mm excuse me i do too and
S0520	and too much tv and ipads and what have you for young children i think it's quite bad news like a degree of it i think be wonderful cos it's educational
S0521	of course yeah
S0520	and it develop all kind of cognitive faculties and you have to be able to use technology nowadays anyway so you need to be proficient but there's such a it's so easy to go over the line and it's just like i think it's just over stimulate and it's that kind of like very very fast kind of change of imagery and stimulation that children get use to and if that's your like kind of tender development stage i don't know i feel like it's can create a problem psychologically
S0519	mm mm it will certainly create the erm addiction to something happen all the time
S0521	my worry be
S0519	that that's that you don't have the space to just sit
S0521	mm
S0520	you need to sit and do nothing sometimes it's really important
S0519	mm
S0521	my my worry that it it's it it create an atmosphere of instant gratification and you don't have the capacity
S0520	or the patience
S0521	to learn things properly develop skills and use them
S0520	yeah and also you haven't get appreciation that come from you have to learn to appreciate things it's like you can go out on a beautiful walk for instance and you can be like completely preoccupy with your worry that be go on in your mind or look at your phone and do things and you know you don't you don't see you don't feel good about what's around you and appreciate where you be and with who you be
S0521	mm
S0520	and you sort of lose and there's a sort of art in that you don't it's not naturally necessarily there's a certain i feel like there's a certain switch that you have to turn on you know
S0519	mm
S0520	you just relax inside yourself and then you start to appreciate what you what you're experience more
S0519	mm
S0520	you know this be the total live sort of
S0521	look at people in restaurants
S0520	you know but i really think it's
S0521	look at people in restaurants and there's a full table of six of eight people and they've all get a iphone
S0520	i know
S0521	i mean it's it's sort of bizarre
S0520	kill the be connect
S0521	what can you possibly be do
S0519	no it's on facebook send a a picture of three people at breakfast and they all have a laptop up
S0521	mm
S0520	yeah
S0519	there be lot of joke like can someone email my scramble egg
S0520	there's so many advantage i don't think it's er a negative thing i just think you have to set limit for on yourself with it
S0519	mm mm
S0520	and i think everybody have a problem more or less everybody have a problem with that
S0519	mm we've try to well we get feed up with each other as well with the devices so we we'd sort of say right we'll have you know a few hours in the morning with no device on and a few hours in the afternoon with no devices on we try and just say right let's have a you know an hour here and an hour there instead of just the constant flow pardon me mm yum scrum i enjoy that
S0520	this be israeli hummus i'll have you know
S0519	israeli hummus
S0520	i'm not sure
S0520	how the israelis would feel about it
S0521	be it israeli in origin or just middle eastern in origin
S0520	no it's er it's er arabic food but there's a lot of jewish arab er jewish people that come from the middle east
S0521	jewish that come from the middle east they're arab then
S0520	mean yeah
S0521	they're middle eastern
S0520	well there's i think i've tell you this before there's kind of broadly speak two group of jews in israel one be call ashkenazi jews and the other
S0521	you're talk about the return jews
S0520	the return jews and the other group be hassidic jews that come from iraq yemen iran and north africa egypt tunisia morocco and so forth and they bring with them
S0519	hummus
S0520	hummus thank you for that not to mention there's a lot of arabs actually in israel mean arab arabs but er
S0521	quite interest that so
S0520	but they've bring all the they've bring a very different cultural influence you know into israel than the ashkenazi jews
S0521	when you when you say there be arabs in israel you jews be mainly sort of erm unique in a way aren't they that you identify somebody as a jew which be his religion
S0520	well it's not only
S0521	whereas you can be you can be an arab and have a jewish religion and you could be an arab and have a muslim religion
S0520	yeah
S0521	you call one an arab but you call the other one a jew
S0520	well that's the things judaism be like jewish mean religious because of the religion but it's also the cultural term
S0521	so so
S0520	in fact you don't have a differentiation
S0521	ethnically be there any difference between jews and arabs
S0520	which ones what do you mean in israel you mean
S0521	in origins be the jews not a just a band of arabs ultimately
S0520	oh do you mean do they originate in the middle east
S0521	yeah
S0520	i actually don't know the answer to that question i don't know i i mean i wouldn't i mean the jews that come from europe to israel in
S0521	but that's much later
S0520	i know it's much later but i'm say i wouldn't i'd say i don't know if they're ethnically middle eastern any more
S0521	right whether they move whether they all move and then you know come from the middle east and then there be a sort of diaspora from there
S0521	cos i'm curious about erm bronowski's thing because he say he talk about agriculture as be the begin of civilisation and he say that er agriculture there's evidence for agriculture in jericho which we now know be on the west bank up to ten thousand years ago
S0520	yeah
S0521	he be say that that it be evidence of civilisation but then he go on to talk about the old testament and erm i be just curious whether he be try to suggest that jericho really be the begin of civilisation in that area
S0520	yeah that wasn't really clear but it's not fair to say be it because egyptians as we then find out be earlier
S0521	well he say ten thousand year ago didn't he
S0520	mm
S0521	whereas egyptians it's they start about four and a half four thousand years bc
S0520	yeah
S0519	they don't start then do they cos they're build pyramid then
S0520	i think it be eight thousand
S0519	mm
S0521	really
S0520	yeah
S0519	it's four thousand for the pyramid isn't it
S0521	be it
S0519	mm
S0521	no i don't think so
S0519	i do where's the er phone
S0520	where's the phone
S0521	anyway there's a there's a big difference between ten thousand years ago and four thousand bc
S0520	ten thousand years ago be six thousand bc
S0521	six thousand bc
S0519	four yeah
S0520	i don't know i don't know if the implication be that
S0519	what no it's eight eight thousand
S0521	what eight thousand
S0519	what you like you two
S0521	what be you talk about
S0520	well i don't think the idea be that the first the people to have find jericho be jewish be they
S0521	well that come back to my question doesn't it
S0520	mm
S0521	be the jews a specific race of people or be they just a tribe of arabs
S0520	i don't know to be honest
S0519	what do you mean a tribe of arabs
S0520	if they originally middle eastern
S0519	sound rude
S0520	it do sound a bite rude dad
S0521	what
S0519	well the way you be say it sound
S0520	a tribe
S0519	derogatory
S0521	that's not actually that's that's the word that's use for the israelites the israelites and the what do you call nomadic nomadic life be a tribe
S0519	mm
S0521	that's not i didn't just use that word
S0519	mm okay it's
S0520	mm talk about like cultural kind of origin i have no idea
S0519	yeah but even in so in christ's time or in two four thousand year excuse me
S0520	mm
S0519	two thousand years ago
S0521	time of christ
S0519	so then there be a jew
S0521	that's not the era we're talk about
S0519	yes but then there be a jewish people weren't there
S0520	yeah but the question be where do they come from originally ethnically speak
S0519	yes so well i'm so far remove from understand that i don't want to start so i'm think where i do understand so so when they be the jewish people then they they be they be jewish they be arabs but they be jewish because of their
S0521	jewish by religion well exactly
S0520	i think so and i think i have the sense that it evolve into an ethnicity
S0519	over time
S0520	but originally it be kind of a religious belief system
S0519	mm so they be they be all the same people in the same area of the land but there be there be jews and non jews
S0521	so it's an arab tribe with a particular religion
S0520	arab you could say be an ethnicity rather than a religion whereas islam be the religious part you know what i mean and there's christian arabs as well
S0521	that be even later
S0519	exactly and so
S0520	but arab
S0519	big interest there isn't it but but at that time so again because i don't understand it really but at that time there be an area of the world that be probably bigger in in
S0521	you mean
S0519	no in in sorry just in in that area that's that's biblical
S0520	mm yeah
S0519	in the middle east but it be it all the different countries at that time or be it just one country now we have jordan and
S0520	i don't know if there be
S0519	i think jordan be much later
S0520	such border at that time
S0519	no cos
S0520	i think there be probably like kingdoms and then there be like nomadic people
S0521	jordan be modern
S0519	but there be the river jordan
S0521	the river jordan yeah but jordan the state of after the first world war
S0519	okay erm so
S0521	cos you've get the
S0519	but there be egypt the people be egypt
S0521	the syrians the canaanites and the
S0519	yes
S0521	egyptians
S0520	all different sort of
S0521	all your different er civilisations
S0519	okay that's that's kind of where i'm come from erm so it's it oh dear i can't get my head round it but it's like what you be say be be that all arab but they're already culturally different
S0520	yeah maybe that's yeah
S0519	already slightly different and so that's not really fair because it's like say all of europe be europeans whereas actually they there be quite different ethnicities within that
S0520	mm that's true mum
S0521	well i'm still come back to the same question be be jewish be identify by ethnicity or purely by its religion
S0520	well that yeah at the moment it's both i mean currently it's both because there be plenty of secular secular jews in europe in israel rather they don't subscribe to the jewish religion but they follow erm heritage and a certain type of cultural observances and erm ancestry i guess
S0519	yeah i think that would be similar to here that people say that they're unless they've particularly choose not to be christian or not to be a believer
S0521	mm
S0519	they probably generally say they're they're christian and they have christen and they have easter holiday and it's it's a a
S0520	yeah but it's much stronger
S0519	much stronger mm
S0520	i think just because of the historical historical context of have come from erm erm how to say have have come from a very distinct cultural history
S0521	right
S0520	in in europe for instance where they do you know they they maintain they be religious jews in europe you know in the ghettos they be they be observe the jewish religion they weren't secular people
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	there's a bite of first of all it's a bite of a new development to be jewish but not to be religious
S0519	mm
S0520	but that come from yeah i think just that very distinct kind of history of the jewish people and identification with that history and certain kind of cultural practice that go with it
S0519	mm
S0520	like's family none of them be religious but they observe all of the jewish holiday jewish new year sukkot what have you hanukkah
S0521	i mean presumably
S0520	passover you know and there's certain like traditional way of behave and some erm on like in a pesach meal or whatever there's all kind of rituals and things that they do as well
S0519	mm
S0520	sing songs that they sing you know like we would do at christmas but it's even more so on top of that some people sort of halfway they believe in certain aspects of the religious erm story let's say and they and they be kind of they carry some of those things with them and like for instance saturday in israel be observe a hundred time more strictly that
S0521	the sabbath
S0519	sunday be here
S0520	sunday be here it use to be like that here didn't it
S0521	yes it do
S0520	but saturday even if you're not religious a lot of people take it as the sabbath and don't do anything and like religious people you're not suppose to use your you're not you're not suppose to create anything so you're not suppose to turn on your car or switch the light on or there's load and load of stuff that you're not suppose to do but most people i mean really saturday nothing happen in israel everything be close and even people who aren't religious consider that to be part of their cultural life
S0521	be that be that enforce by law
S0520	to a degree yeah i mean there be there be quite a strong influence of orthodox jews inside the government and and so forth so there be there be things which you're not allow to do but like for instance i arrive in tel aviv last time on sunday there be no train from the airport run
S0519	on the saturday
S0520	on the saturday sorry things like where you go okay but what i'm say be that the even the the secular people which be a large proportion of the population in israel
S0519	mm
S0520	especially in tel aviv they're much they're much more erm closely observe their jewishness
S0521	yeah i see what you mean
S0520	than people here who consider themselves sort of secular but with some christian influence
S0521	well maybe maybe they
S0520	and also they're very er they have a very strong erm emotional attachment to their identity as jewish and the history of the jewish people that's why like especially the recent history but you know their grandparents most of them be in the be erm survivors of the holocaust you know and it's an enormous thing to carry
S0521	holocaust yeah
S0519	yeah it be
S0520	and they come over they escape that horrific situation and most of their family be dead and they come to israel to start a new life this be two generations ago
S0519	mm
S0521	mm
S0519	very close isn't it
S0520	so and that be a war that be wag against jewish people jewishness you know
S0521	yeah
S0520	and i think you know people really build a very strong sense of identity around that history it's really you know it's not like you know even people who like who's just like quite on the periphery really of jewishness still
S0521	well that's understandable yeah isn't it ironic that the isn't it ironic that the syrian's be clamber to get into germany
S0520	mm
S0521	as the great er open society for migrants i wonder what the israelis think of that
S0520	i'm sure they have a lot of thoughts about that
S0521	mm
S0520	yeah it's interest i mean i see it you know now that i've met's family they're not they're very erm you know very kind of modern they're not they're non religious people for instance they don't have any objection to the fact that i be not jewish
S0521	right
S0520	whereas your average family might
S0521	really
S0519	mm
S0520	not might would have
S0519	oh would they
S0520	yeah i mean it's not really the do thing
S0519	mm
S0520	but you know they for them that's completely you know their family have travel a lot and what have you and
S0521	well they object to me for be a non catholic
S0520	exactly you have to convert
S0521	i have to do lessons yeah
S0519	no you have to have lessons
S0520	i mean if i want to convert to judaism which i don't and will never erm it's a serious undertake oh my goodness
S0521	i can imagine
S0520	you don't want to be do it
S0519	do you have to learn the language
S0521	you've get to be pretty serious have you
S0519	and be able to read the
S0520	no it's a serious business they don't i mean this be the fascinate thing about judaism they don't want you to convert
S0519	no
S0521	no evangelism
S0520	no nothing they really want to make it difficult for you to be jewish if you weren't bear into it
S0519	mm
S0521	completely opposite to christianity isn't it
S0520	and islam
S0521	and islam do they be they evangelists
S0519	they do
S0520	i get that impression i mean christianity be probably more it's more pronounce isn't it what i understand as well be that erm there's a lot of tension in within the jewish part of israeli society between these two hassidic and ashkenazi erm jews
S0521	oh yeah
S0520	it's actually quite a source of social problems
S0521	oh
S0520	because the hassidic jews tend to be in lower income
S0521	okay
S0520	erm job and tend to be poorer and in poorer neighbourhoods and tend to be responsible for a lot more of crime you know crime and stuff that happen erm and they also just have quite different value systems you know because they didn't come from europe
S0521	right
S0520	and and then in the nineteen nineties there be a huge influx of russian jews into israeli about a million russian jews and they be like uber ashkenazi i mean i be ask i say what do it mean by ashkenazi apart from the fact that you're kind of you know white and they erm have a tradition of be very very educate very very culture you know erm upper class let's say there's a kind of class issue build into it
S0521	yes i remember that oh yeah right cos jew jews have a reputation for be business mind don't they
S0520	merchants yeah bankers weren't they
S0521	yeah
S0520	in europe but yeah i notice i notice this to be true erm but yeah so many people there often say you know if erm if we weren't unite by a common enemy
S0519	be this plastic recycle
S0521	i put those in the plastic yeah
S0519	you put the orange plastic bag in the plastic
S0521	what's wrong with that
S0519	you can't they're not recyclable
S0520	you can't put the plastic bag dad
S0521	what do they do with it
S0520	chuck it in a landfill
S0521	well exactly i think plastic be plastic be a great issue because nobody know what to do with it
S0519	no and there's also the fact that there be lot of different type aren't there as it be
S0521	i don't think it's any better just just put your plastic bottle there it doesn't end up anywhere different i don't think do it unless they recycle the bottle but i can't imagine them do that plastic bottle
S0520	that's what they do isn't it
S0521	so they recycle plastic bottle
S0519	i don't know what they do with them
S0521	don't think so
S0520	yeah somebody need to invent a new material that have the same properties but be biodegradable
S0521	it's one of the great offshoots of the oil industry
S0520	what plastic mm yeah i saw that in india actually when i first go to india they didn't have plastic really they have glass and they have paper bag
S0521	right
S0520	and when you have a tea it be serve in a clay cup
S0521	right
S0520	which they would then just break onto the grind and that be that
S0521	yeah
S0520	but of course plastic be a wonderful thing and erm and very convenient so you can see that it's sort of become a huge problem now they're because there's so many people
S0521	you can't destroy it no
S0520	who have no concept of recycle
S0521	have you see that picture of the pacific in that little pacific with a little but huge actually they're just full of plastic cos the currents they contrive to concentrate the throw away plastic into specific areas and it it's enormous
S0520	mm
S0521	i haven't think about the jews actually
S0520	we can ask well i don't know if would know i wouldn't say be you ethnically arab
S0521	so be he ashkenazi then
S0520	yes his family be ashkenazi classic
S0521	and where do they originate then
S0520	erm romania germany and poland i think and russia his father's russian
S0521	yes sorry i mean his specific family come
S0520	that's what i'm talk about yeah they're usually a mixture you know because someone would come from russia someone would come i think his mum be from romania and his father be russian
S0521	oh right okay
S0519	be they like the americans where they they think that that
S0520	i'm like romanian israeli
S0521	take pride in their
S0519	you say oh i'm irish and they say oh
S0521	i'm an irish american
S0520	i don't think it's quite like that
S0519	erm you're not your possible uncle fifteen time remove
S0520	not it's not really get to that point yet it's all quite recent isn't it
S0521	mm
S0520	erm people identify as ashkenazi or as as they call eastern that for sure
S0521	eastern europe
S0520	eastern they call them eastern jews mean they come from they come from east of east of israel
S0521	oh i see oh okay
S0520	countries that lie east of israel yeah and er there's quite a lot of racism i think in on that level
S0519	be there
S0520	yeah
S0519	about where you come from as a jew
S0520	yeah
S0519	oh
S0520	it's bite of a disaster isn't it well that's what everyone say be that if if israelis weren't unite against a common enemy they would start fight amongst themselves instead because there's so many factions there's this thing and there's also religious jews versus secular jews
S0521	yeah
S0520	which be a big source of tension cos they do think about things very differently
S0521	interest the term racism because i mean be it a race so there's there's prejudice of one set of jews against another because of their
S0520	because of their ethnicity
S0521	their ethnic origin
S0520	yeah well they call them black because they have dark skin in comparison as well you know they look like middle eastern people look very dark skin and dark eye
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	and erm you know they just have a very you know they have a different look about them whereas ashkenazi be typically white you know white people
S0521	right
S0519	in erm in judaism then be there a be there no sort of like you we're the only ones go to heaven kind of malarkey
S0520	what do you mean
S0519	well i i just sorry but i just be think religiously that that's why
S0521	like the christians
S0519	the christians and the muslims want to people to come to their religion because they're the only ones go to heaven
S0520	who be go to be save
S0521	the choose people
S0520	actually i must say i don't know very much about judaism at all and i don't know the answer to that question i know that they call themselves the choose people and
S0519	i do
S0521	yes
S0520	and i think that they believe like most religious group that they're the only people who god have really communicate with
S0521	the the direct link with god
S0520	but i don't think there i don't think there's an apocalyptic erm prophesy like in christianity but i don't know do you know
S0521	erm interest you should say that the end of the world do that appear in the
S0520	you know like the second come and all of that and
S0521	that's revelations isn't it i don't think it's in the old testament at all
S0520	i don't think so either i'm not really sure what's in the old testament apart from a lot of
S0521	no probably not
S0519	a lot of scary stuff
S0520	scary scary mythological stories about stuff and it's also like an origin myth isn't it the old testament it's like where do the jewish people come from and erm
S0521	so we think abraham be about two thousand bc do we
S0520	that's what it say yeah
S0521	so he be quite close to
S0520	no not abraham jacob
S0521	yeah but
S0520	same same
S0521	that's his grandson isn't it
S0520	yeah
S0521	and they're more or less the same time
S0520	yeah it be about two thousand bc
S0521	abraham be suppose to be the father of the family isn't he
S0520	of the family yeah the tribe they actually call themselves a tribe the jew the jewish people
S0519	mm
S0521	actually there be twelve tribes of israel aren't there
S0520	oh yeah
S0521	they be the brothers weren't they
S0520	i should really learn about it i be all quite surprise about the pesach story and the ten plague and
S0521	israel have five sons
S0519	passover
S0520	pesach yeah be passover
S0519	be it pesach
S0520	pesach be the hebrew version yeah there's a lot of erm
S0519	yeah so they'll be think you're very ignorant cos you don't now the christian you know it's the same story for the christians and the jews
S0520	what for the easter
S0519	no not well it but it's all in the old testament so that's part of christianity
S0520	passover yeah exactly there's just more focus on the new testament
S0519	yeah well that's the
S0520	they don't recognise the new testament
S0519	no
S0521	no of course not despite the fact that he be a jew
S0520	that's all they have to say on the matter yeah jewish jesus be a jew
S0521	a jew that get it wrong
S0520	a jew that betray the tribe
S0521	well that's interest that
S0519	no they think he's a good bloke and all that don't they
S0520	i dunno i don't think they even think he exist
S0521	i'm i think you may be flatter yourself there
S0520	i'm not sure how much er friendliness there be towards the whole thing to be honest
S0521	well mr mohammed say er that christ be a prophet
S0519	oh yeah he they're chums
S0520	they be both yeah they're both in a lot of stories aren't they well william blake reckon he come to england
S0521	yes the green and pleasant land
S0520	yeah there's some funny theories about it
S0521	they think that paul might have get to spain on his journey
S0520	that sound possible
S0521	cos he he certainly get to rome it's not all that far to
S0520	i just wonder how long after the actual events themselves these things be write as well same with the bible
S0521	i think people know that it erm there's a there's an excellent book by excellent book
S0520	be this that woman er
S0521	call the four
S0520	that nun
S0521	no
S0520	that you read karen armstrong mm
S0521	not that one not that one erm it's call the four gospels but it's not call the four gospels it's call the four something the four anyway it's a guy who's write a a whole book about the historical context of the write of the gospels
S0520	mm
S0521	and it's pretty it's pretty clear actually that they be write between the sixty sixty ad and a hundred erm matthew be apparently be it mark mark mark be the first one who apparently be erm in rome
S0520	mm
S0521	so say it's thirty year or so after the crucifixion that the first gospel be write
S0520	you're not allow to say ad any more be you
S0521	be you not
S0520	what do you say again
S0519	i don't know
S0521	it's modern era something isn't it
S0519	what's this for
S0520	you're not allow to say bc and ad as in as a kind of mainstream way of talk about time
S0519	oh
S0520	yeah because not everyone's time be orientate around jesus
S0519	oh lordy lordy
S0520	so it's kind of a colonial supremacy thing
S0521	so well
S0519	oh i didn't know there be another word for it
S0520	no there's another way what be it again dad after something
S0519	it's some something about years years of that modern era
S0520	no no no as in theirs be a there be an
S0521	there's an acronym b o or something
S0520	we use it now instead of bc and ad you know if you're an indian why would you
S0519	well
S0520	well
S0519	but it some things become our erm they become part of the culture and the way you say something you know you don't have to believe in christ to know that your clock's be base on him
S0520	no that's true but it's like gmt as well
S0521	yeah they're change that now aren't they
S0520	you're not allow to say gmt
S0519	flip heck
S0521	they're change that
S0520	you say
S0519	vocab
S0520	you say utc universal coordinate time
S0519	oh get lose
S0520	no it's not get lose it's a it's a symbol of erm colonial
S0519	colonial whatnots oh lord
S0520	what do you call it oppression that we have to all measure ourselves accord to british
S0519	well the whole latitude and everything go through it so
S0520	no well no
S0521	that's because it be it's longitude actually longitude
S0520	that's cos the brits make it up
S0519	well sorry
S0521	it it be arbitrarily choose to be zero longitude
S0520	it's like you know when the colonials go over to india and rename everything they say this be bombay and this be calcutta and this be blah
S0519	alright yeah
S0520	and then since then the indians have say wait a minute what all this
S0519	that's not what it's call
S0520	that's not what it's call let's call it what we call it instead and that's how the world should say our place in india and not you know cos some british idiot
S0521	what about india be that the right name
S0520	yeah i don't know actually yeah it get a bite ridiculous but i mean fair enough there's a whole play about it erm that we be force to read a school which be actually really good it's er a brian friel play call translations
S0521	yeah
S0519	oh yeah
S0520	and it's actually about the british occupation of ireland
S0519	oh i never know that
S0520	and they change all the place name
S0519	right
S0520	as a way of anglicise the country but in do so like the place place name contain within them a lot of cultural history why people have call them that in the first place
S0521	mm
S0520	and through rename them you kind of that that be lose it's kind of erase you know so symbolically it have quite a big effect
S0521	mm
S0519	no so i wasn't be and i i mean i i none of that's lose on me of course in term of the name of the country but i the country and the and the cities but erm ooh no erm
S0520	i saw that
S0519	but er i wasn't think greenwich mean time be anything
S0520	well greenwich mean time i mean in fairness things be be measure in greenwich because the brits probably
S0521	invent it
S0520	create the system but
S0519	well there you go
S0520	so fair enough
S0519	that's fair enough it doesn't mean we've you know
S0521	longitude
S0519	we didn't ruin somebody's life for it
S0520	be it
S0519	oh heck what on earth's that thing there
S0521	erm but you just i mean it do get a bite ridiculous like for instance the west indies they're call the west indies by a a gross error because it wasn't the west indies at all it be america
S0520	it be a mistake
S0521	but no one's think to change the name of the west indies
S0520	well they probably will eventually
S0520	in fairness
S0519	what be that
S0520	oh weirdies it look like a little bite of
S0521	what be it
S0520	rot or something doesn't it
S0519	yeah like a
S0520	or like a er mould or something
S0521	very strange
S0519	i'm give the kitchen a an clean
S0520	you don't need to do that
S0519	not really you know it need a clean anyway it need a woman's touch
S0520	yeah er they just have the new year celebrations

S0520	mm coffee mm yeah i'm not sure the lavazza be the way for the coffee machine
S0519	no it doesn't seem to be tasty
S0520	in general i just think it lack a certain richness the coffee
S0519	mm
S0520	maybe it's the erm it's the way it's pour
S0519	but i'm hopeful now with the erm with the latest adjustment
S0520	mm
S0519	that we can get that the nice taylor's coffee to taste nice again cos it use to
S0520	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0519	erm
S0520	well they do just get wear and erm dirty inside and then you get a weird taste
S0519	yeah yeah exactly
S0520	even though it self clean maybe there's a kind of major clean
S0519	erm no there be a clean you have to do periodically a proper clean you have to put er a sort of some sort of chemical in
S0520	mm
S0519	erm and run a whole procedure
S0520	yeah i'm sure do it regularly
S0519	yes
S0519	i i think he be so good to his machine that he's ruin it for life
S0519	now
S0519	a certain amount of healthy neglect be require
S0520	he's always kind of like semi in shock to see how i treat my belong
S0520	be as well actually he's very careful with things

S0520	grimness yeah fly disaster i'm not sure this guy with his rebellious antic be really go to take very well this corbyn guy
S0519	no
S0520	i mean there be people that you know think the national anthem and the queen and all of that be a load of old rubbish
S0519	of course there be
S0520	and in fairness we all do to a degree but it's there's something like a bite schoolboy childish in that kind of action
S0519	mm
S0520	it's not very
S0519	no it's not
S0520	responsible
S0519	so if he be in government he have to he have to be accept by the queen it's all a rigmarole but you know
S0520	it be
S0519	it's part of the
S0520	i explain this to and he be in shock and say why do people accept this
S0519	yes
S0520	i say i'm not sure but if you look at like how people respond to the royal wed and stuff you know you don't you can't say that people don't have a sort of emotional relationship with the whole rigmarole
S0519	no no that's right it's a bite scary isn't it
S0520	like billions of people wasn't there
S0519	erm so yeah so choose to already be disrespectful and but he would have to be accept by the queen and have to accept her even if he want to chuck her out the week after he can't even be be in government without
S0520	her permission
S0519	her permission
S0520	her royal permission she should chuck him out
S0519	that's not a good start be it
