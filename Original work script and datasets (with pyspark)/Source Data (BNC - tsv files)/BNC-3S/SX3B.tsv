S0467	he's probably somewhere about the pacific
S0468	yeah let's hope he's not in the pacific
S0467	yeah let's hope so oh there's another side
S0468	just this side
S0467	be it just
S0468	just get your detail in everything else be alright how good be these speakers these recorders good quality
S0467	don't know i've never use one before
S0467	look look pretty decent though
S0468	yeah look quite nice
S0467	mm
S0468	as do these flapjacks thank you for those it add a peculiar dynamic be record
S0467	yeah probably just try and forget that it's there
S0468	that's true or talk about the fact that it's there
S0467	yeah
S0468	as a
S0467	talk about how erm be record might change the way that you speak in yourself like
S0468	yeah
S0467	whether whether they should really be record us in secret and but
S0468	mm
S0467	obviously they can't really do that cos we've gotta sign a consent form
S0468	yeah
S0467	unless you just follow round someone round with a tape recorder and then
S0468	could you do that would there be ethical implications to just go round record conversations outside cafes
S0467	amend it yeah and then erm get get permission retrospectively
S0468	yeah yeah could be do couldn't it i mean if someone didn't wanna be record and you could just say we'll destroy it because it do change the dynamic
S0467	yeah
S0468	it's the same with the video interview that i have
S0467	you'll think yeah you'll think about i've i've just think there what ah but they're gonna note down that i've just overlap you in speech there and that might come across as quite a erm dominate thing
S0467	but really like we're so relax around each other
S0468	yeah
S0467	it doesn't really matter
S0468	there's no set pattern of speech here it's probably er i dunno slightly different different way of interact
S0467	yeah i imagine the way that we're talk be gonna be quite different to how everyone else be gonna be talk so
S0468	mm quite possibly
S0467	although we haven't say cunt yet
S0468	there you go
S0467	yeah
S0468	there's the one
S0467	there it be
S0467	reclaim it
S0467	reclaim it as a term of endearment
S0468	this should be quite an interest i wouldn't mind transcribe people's random conversations it give you quite a unique insight into people doesn't it chat here like there's someone sit near it it's that idea of transcendence
S0467	yeah
S0468	separate the third the third person you're aware of yourself in the third person now i'm not i'm not just talk which be the facticity of what i'm do
S0467	yeah
S0468	it's the transcendent idea that someone someone's that's watch it when you
S0467	it's the idea of self as well because obviously we've get a certain er interpretation of how how we're talk
S0468	mm
S0467	but then someone else listen to this isn't isn't gonna have all of the background of our like friendship and
S0468	sure
S0467	and like all the different like shit that we talk about
S0467	on a daily basis and then come and sit here
S0468	yeah
S0467	and just and have a little excerpt of it
S0468	yeah yeah yeah
S0467	in isolation
S0468	it's like the cork float on the water
S0467	you've get well get my you've get my name you've my age you've get the you've get erm that i'm british that i speak british english
S0467	as though this kind of these be the most important characteristics that be gonna determine my of the way that i speak
S0468	yeah
S0467	when in reality there's a lot of different factor
S0468	yeah
S0467	they don't know that my they don't know that my
S0468	it's gonna be who you're with
S0467	parent be work class and go to university and you know dad's from and my mum's from ireland and
S0468	yeah
S0467	they don't get that from they
S0468	yeah no it's true you think there it'd be worth get better insight or but then i dunno yeah cos a lot of languages depend on who you're sit down and chat to isn't it
S0467	yeah
S0468	surely the the context entirely i suppose they'll be include that in their analysis somehow
S0467	well it's whether it's relevant as well
S0468	mm
S0467	it's not really relevant to much be it or the the topics
S0468	yeah
S0467	that we're talk about it's more
S0468	mm but then if you could build in kind of friends within a within a class and get them to talk more effectively about certain subject maybe the outcomes would be better there
S0467	mm
S0468	who know
S0467	speech wouldn't be as natural
S0467	although this isn't natural either
S0468	no it's not be it
S0467	i keep look over at the tape recorder
S0468	yeah same
S0467	very aware that it's there
S0468	yeah this isn't like if we'd just go out for a cigarette break
S0467	no
S0468	and have
S0467	no like well what's the difference in us go outside
S0468	now we know
S0467	chat or just like sit here like pretty different actually
S0468	yeah yeah
S0468	very artificial i'm afraid
S0467	yeah
S0468	erm that's alright then get some some glimmer from us
S0467	yeah
S0468	get some natural speech
S0467	what time do you think you'll finish work today
S0468	erm when will i finish work
S0467	will you like finish half four or will that have to be like later
S0468	oh yeah possibly it depend when go
S0467	yeah
S0468	partly because this week's be so such so much of a nothing week for me i take the piss yesterday so
S0467	yeah
S0468	i can't really er
S0467	i'm take the piss constantly
S0468	yeah fair enough
S0468	it happen well what time be you think of leave
S0467	well i get in at half eight so i can leave any time after half four really
S0468	yeah oh good well if you want if you wanna go a lot earlier than me and i'm still work i can just
S0467	just gonna go back to yours and have a joint with you mate
S0468	oh that'd be nice yeah smoke the herb
S0467	and not go wrong
S0468	yeah there's no way you can go wrong
S0467	mm
S0468	just be careful
S0467	yeah
S0468	just just be careful
S0467	just be careful just be careful
S0468	i be talk to my buddy earlier on about all kinds of psychedelics erm cos she get onto the topic through er she say something about spend her money travel and we're talk about how people some people save it and some people spend it
S0467	yeah
S0468	and she say ah spend all my money travel on magic mushroom i be like
S0467	sorry
S0468	yeah like what like what i've do some recently
S0467	yeah
S0468	what do you think they're great aren't they and yeah we be just chat about them for for quite while
S0467	what she travel around take them or no she spend
S0468	er she go she go travel before
S0467	oh okay
S0468	and erm yeah they spend a load of money while she be travel buy them
S0467	yeah probably have some quite profound experience
S0468	yeah yeah can imagine if you're in the
S0467	yeah consider the experience you have in a place where you like extremely comfortable
S0468	yeah and you know pretty well
S0467	yeah and then if you if you feel comfortable wherever you be if you're like a bear traveller and you just like
S0468	yeah
S0467	you can just take it in the most amaze place and just not have no risk of like of like
S0468	i think it'd be incredible
S0467	worry yourself
S0468	mm that'll be the next step
S0467	yeah
S0468	to get comfortable and at that kind of
S0467	do it on the top of a mountain
S0468	yeah well
S0467	that'd be a real spiritual experience
S0468	it would it might be dangerous it depend if you become really childlike cos to be fair
S0467	yeah but no because like when we've when we've do
S0468	we weren't take risk be we
S0467	when we've do to before there be no way we be take any risk
S0468	no
S0467	i mean people like have all these like preconceptions that you're gonna like do stupid things but like
S0468	mm
S0467	like walk round no one's gonna like look at us and think that the the you know you're act weird or anything like that
S0468	mm
S0467	so it's like still very aware of like cars like the possibility
S0468	it's true although spatial perception out a bite
S0467	of cars
S0468	yeah you have to be a bite more careful just because it's not quite as comfortable a state of consciousness but
S0467	yeah
S0468	i mean generally you be pretty safe yeah
S0467	well yeah and you're think about other things rather than the practical applications
S0468	yeah
S0467	of the car mm
S0468	yeah or you might think it's further in the distance it's closer even though you're aware you shouldn't walk out in front of a car you forget that it's
S0467	yeah although
S0468	it's their car
S0467	when we be walk i remember like wait at traffic light for an inordinate amount of time wait for like cos you're not in any rush you're not like
S0468	yeah it's true
S0467	you're like just it doesn't it's you
S0468	you're not go a to b be you just
S0467	yeah you're not yeah you're not go a to b
S0468	no you be literally just unadulterated
S0467	yeah
S0468	fall through time and space
S0467	yeah
S0468	experience your true experience self the new bear baby the the child
S0467	beautiful beautiful
S0468	yeah it's absolutely wonderful experience and i'd recommend to anyone listen to try and get your hand on something like that erm if you haven't already
S0467	yeah completely riskless
S0468	yeah
S0467	look into it
S0468	yeah look at erm his research be like efficacy scale and drug drug harm and
S0467	application for depression
S0468	yep yep all of these things in fact it's be use for thousands of years it's completely natural then then look at the hypocrisy and the drug laws and and the pharmaceutical
S0467	and if you think that it's wrong to take drug just because it's illegal then perhaps have a look at the history of our legal system and er the ramifications of
S0468	mm
S0467	be a homosexual in the seventies
S0468	of course yeah
S0467	of public opinion on that issue today
S0468	yeah
S0467	so what what be people gonna be think in the come like years and or decades how slow we be to react to something that's like pretty incredible medicine for
S0468	mm
S0467	for a hell of a lot of different ailments
S0468	mm exactly
S0467	physical and mental
S0468	mm yep yeah from marijuana all the way through but how long have we be record
S0467	like twelve minutes
S0468	mm would you like any more nuggets of wisdom
S0467	nuggets of wisdom
S0468	be that a commonly use phrase
S0468	nugget follow by something nugget after something
S0467	yeah be it a wisdom nugget or be it a
S0468	nugget
S0467	yeah chicken nugget
S0467	or a nugget of chicken i mean chicken nugget to me that sound disgust but a nugget of chicken i mean that sound
S0468	quite
S0467	i mean as a vegetarian i mean i tell you what that sound fuck lovely
S0468	i know good
S0467	mm
S0468	just a little nugget
S0467	really lovely
S0468	a golden nugget oh that's they get the brand right on that cereal
S0467	oh didn't they just
S0468	yeah
S0467	yeah
S0468	golden nuggets
S0467	chicken nuggets though no sound crap
S0468	yeah yeah
S0467	nugget of chicken nugget of gold
S0467	they both sound better when you say nugget of something
S0468	nugget of
S0467	just cos nugget's a more interest word so if you put it at the begin of a phrase then
S0468	mm
S0467	then it put the emphasis on it doesn't it
S0468	you're like and it i want it
S0467	well good
S0468	when you hear just nugget it's just kind of like what do that mean
S0467	chicken nugget you just think chicken you know nugget of chicken that's wow that's awesome
S0468	what do a nugget mean nugget be just a chunk or a bite
S0467	i yeah it's just like a yeah just a discernible piece of
S0468	piece of something
S0467	yeah
S0468	anything
S0467	yeah
S0468	nugget of wisdom yeah can have that can't you cos you can have a nugget of a concept
S0467	it's like a raw form isn't it which be quite weird consider the chicken nugget it's like it's probably like already form it's like
S0468	yeah
S0467	nugget of already form chicken
S0468	yeah yeah that's not right be it
S0467	but nuggets of like a big slab of like
S0467	of like a chicken that's just be like
S0468	spray off the bone
S0467	spray off the bone
S0468	chicken bone
S0467	ears and arseholes
S0468	yeah yeah
S0467	beak
S0468	course that's horrible
S0467	parson's tongue
S0468	yeah and then it's
S0467	what be it no parson's beak
S0468	parsons
S0467	what be it
S0468	erm parson's nose be it be it parson's nose
S0467	yeah parson's nose
S0468	vagina of the chicken
S0467	yeah
S0468	that's what we're talk about chicken cunts
S0467	yeah chicken cunts yeah
S0468	let's get in on this
S0467	ah
S0468	but yeah that's true nuggets be you've see a nugget of raw material and a nugget of material and you can talk about nuggets of a concept
S0467	mm
S0468	just a piece which be a lovely word
S0467	always a
S0468	huh
S0467	all word be lovely really
S0468	yeah it's nice language be just
S0467	mm
S0468	that's why yeah it's great isn't it to just learn new word and to chat cos it expand your experience of the world
S0467	yeah
S0468	almost entirely that's what sundays when i see that have read this many book and you don't necessarily have to read book to gain that knowledge but the way that he's read them and then he talk about it's like
S0467	he be gain knowledge through the
S0468	yeah he be
S0467	he could gain knowledge in other ways
S0468	yeah
S0467	but like that be like very clear like
S0468	he's usually read to and his palette his repertoire to explore the world now be like really wide and that's what happen with you know with artists they can do it creatively or musicians they can they've get a great way of describe the world through music but if you're a writer word be your primary form so you become really sort of verbally eloquent in the ability to explain the world which be a great skill like really i wanna do more kind of out there when i'm sit down at at work just test arbitrary things i feel like i should be take in nuggets of wisdom from multiple people rather than do something that actually
S0467	doesn't matter
S0468	doesn't matter
S0467	nothing that we're do matter
S0468	doesn't doesn't mean anything unfortunately guess this be probably this thing we're take part in now it's potentially one of the most interest things
S0467	this be the most useful this be the most useful thing that i will do today
S0468	yeah
S0467	definitely
S0468	yeah
S0467	i'm a marketer by the way
S0467	don't don't do it
S0467	it's soul destroy
S0468	don't get a job in in an office
S0467	work for one of the best company in like in you know still can't get on board with it
S0468	yeah
S0467	still can't not for profit
S0468	yeah
S0467	not for anything mate
S0468	yeah
S0467	pointless
S0468	just for life just for existence one
S0467	maybe yeah maybe this will help someone learn more authentic english
S0468	possibly yeah
S0467	yeah
S0468	the authentic english attitude as well
S0468	it's just sort of like misanthropy and
S0467	yeah
S0468	pessimism and cynicism
S0467	content on language integrate learn people who learn about psychedelics whilst they learn about language from us
S0468	yeah yeah
S0467	they should definitely include this passage in full
S0468	yeah
S0468	for the next unlock version of unlock
S0467	yeah critical think
S0468	we'll get the discovery channel to do a
S0467	critical think
S0468	critical think
S0467	it's like ah critical think what what what a fallacy
S0467	what a fallacy free think
S0468	yeah it should be free think
S0467	mm
S0468	should get to do erm a segment for one of your products we'll talk to him when we go to to see if he want to do something
S0467	to be fair if people want to collect natural speech
S0468	mm
S0467	why don't they just erm there's plenty of podcast and things like that that's
S0468	mm
S0467	if if we're take this particular exercise as an exercise in natural speech then what the fuck be the difference in just get a podcast off the internet transcribe it and stick it in the corpus
S0468	sure
S0467	we do it with every other
S0468	mm
S0467	piece of mass media so why aren't we do it with podcast
S0468	yeah
S0467	maybe we should suggest that to and whichever one be which
S0468	yeah true shall we just pause this and go into go tell them
S0467	yeah go and tell them to do that just go yeah there's about three hundred hours worth of er podcast footage there
S0468	yeah yeah
S0467	american english there you go you've just expand them
S0468	it might even be more natural cos we're not use to be on podcast
S0467	exactly
S0468	there's people that do podcast for a live and just kind of forget about it
S0467	all the time yeah cos even now i feel like i'm get it just
S0468	get into it a little bite yeah
S0467	forget about a little bite
S0468	yeah yeah it's true
S0467	speech become a little bite more natural
S0468	it take time but in ten minute slot you've gotta think that maybe the first half of that people be still overcome the barrier of be record
S0467	yeah
S0468	whereas here
S0467	so really be ten minutes long enough to because
S0468	yeah
S0467	for the first few minutes we weren't really we maybe that's why they want us to do it for like a minimum of ten minutes so that you know your speech become more natural towards the end that's just
S0468	yeah that's true
S0467	take up a subsection with
S0468	mm mm will be interest hopefully we can see what's do with this
S0467	mm
S0468	do do do what be the time now go and go and have a bite of a a as well
S0467	some er
S0468	and do some
S0467	do some shit work
S0468	right
S0467	that's alright actually i've get some good stuff i think now
S0468	that's good
S0467	yeah feel a lot more positive about it
S0468	good good good
S0467	yep
S0468	good news
S0467	right so yeah do
S0468	thank you
S0467	probably just leave it run then will turn it off
S0468	i'm so from my
