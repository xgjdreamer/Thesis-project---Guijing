S0058	right
S0179	right okay
S0058	okay
S0179	cool
S0058	sound like don't we
S0179	i'm sorry oh um if you put the headrest up behind you it'll be more comfortable hang on yep that's it possibly the wrong sequence to do it in
S0058	yeah
S0179	yep
S0091	won't come up
S0179	yeah hang on
S0179	it just won't reach
S0058	you reach
S0179	uh
S0179	it's a little stiff uh
S0058	there's a knack to it obviously
S0179	yes it's possibly not the easiest thing to do once you're already belt in
S0091	turn right and at the bottom of the hill turn right again
S0179	yep so we'll go over back way to and then
S0091	no not that way
S0179	so not
S0058	i'm guess
S0179	yeah but we go through to get to we sort of go through the outskirts uh
S0058	the sheep in that field be go very speedily
S0058	it's little legs be really er go
S0091	right at the bottom
S0179	yep hang on we've get to er
S0058	mm
S0179	oh well one of our doors isn't shut properly
S0091	here
S0179	yep hang on
S0058	should i should i just check mine
S0179	well not now
S0058	yeah no no no obviously
S0179	right we've get one of the doors isn't shut properly apparently
S0058	er i think mine be
S0179	yep that's good whoever it be we've sort it
S0058	be there a little light on or something
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh right
S0179	yeah it just tell you that a door's open but not which one
S0179	which isn't dreadfully helpful
S0058	no
S0179	i think the thirty speed limit through this village be a bite optimistic
S0058	yes
S0179	it's ridiculous for place they put twenty mile an hour speed limit
S0058	yeah
S0179	in for no good reason and yet they feel the need to restrict you to thirty through here and then sorry don't
S0058	so yeah not restrict you to twenty through here yeah
S0179	yeah deep water cool
S0179	if it didn't look quite stagnant i'd be very
S0058	i be gonna
S0179	keen on go for a swim
S0058	i be gonna say it do look a little bite er yeah be there a while oh a cat
S0179	oy oy oy lane
S0179	have fun walk down there at night
S0058	yeah i guess that's quite a innocuous name really like
S0179	i suppose so it's just the connotations it
S0058	yeah no entirely
S0179	it's it sort of subsequently obtain it's easier drive along here in winter cos the vegetation sort of lessen
S0058	right so you can see where you're go
S0179	yeah oh there's another yaris
S0058	mm
S0179	hello
S0179	bite cleaner than us as well
S0058	yes do you say we're gonna get the guy at work to give it a go over or not i can't remember what
S0179	the guy at work
S0058	yeah the valet
S0179	valeters
S0058	valeters that's it
S0179	there we go not actually valet um give it a try i just don't think it's a particularly efficient use of twenty five quid
S0058	yeah
S0179	as in all i want be the inside vacuum and the outside wash i mean we can do that very easily
S0058	yeah we can do that yeah true
S0179	in the space of half an hour
S0058	yeah
S0179	you know it's
S0058	fair enough
S0179	it's just we haven't be at home much to do it recently
S0058	no
S0179	but
S0058	i will hoover the car out tomorrow
S0179	yeah please
S0058	yeah i will
S0179	to be honest it's now be so long i might do the outside again
S0179	there's a nice sort of ah
S0058	hmm
S0179	who have we get um next week
S0058	excellent
S0179	i think that's fair
S0058	it's not a particularly horrible job
S0179	exactly there's some stupid thing in this country about the speed limit so the speed limit along here be national and with that
S0058	yeah
S0179	sort of admittedly i'm not seriously make progress but you know i'm sort of not be above fifty
S0058	no
S0179	but yet on other roads it's exactly the same speed limit despite the fact that they're multiple lanes
S0058	yeah open clear
S0179	yeah
S0058	no er junctions yeah
S0179	yeah but um you see the thing be um you know the road safety charity brake
S0058	yeah
S0179	well let's guess what their main concern
S0179	be go to be
S0058	yeah exactly
S0179	but again all of that's be there's virtually no crossover to to um say the or yet because um i suppose organizations solution be for driver train not for reduce speed limit
S0058	yeah
S0179	um and in most case speed be er speed limit of road it's might be an aggravate factor in the severity of the accident but it doesn't cause it
S0058	no
S0179	er driver error cause the accident
S0058	yeah how to drive safely at different speed
S0179	yeah exactly i mean ideally you'd live in a situation where there be no speed limit and people
S0058	yeah
S0179	could be trust to pick the appropriate speed for the set of circumstances um
S0058	er you might need sort of sign say warn this thing be come up that you won't be able to see
S0179	well exactly
S0058	but
S0179	you would need sort of accept guidance
S0058	yeah
S0179	um well no what it should have be suggest speed limit
S0058	yeah
S0179	but the optimum
S0058	and you're you're penalise for drive dangerously not for
S0179	break the limit
S0058	the speed yeah
S0179	and that may well be the same thing
S0058	yes exactly yeah
S0179	but
S0058	that's what i mean but sometimes they're not
S0179	yes
S0058	like you say sometimes it's safer to
S0091	leave leave at the top
S0179	yep there be many situations in which it's acceptable
S0058	mm
S0179	or indeed er well that be leisurely
S0058	nice day for a cycle
S0179	he look very happy didn't he
S0058	yeah well nice to be out on your bike
S0179	er indeed um we get from to here one bar of fuel that's impressive
S0058	nice
S0179	efficient little car
S0058	that's pretty good do well
S0179	so light it's scary
S0058	so what
S0179	so light it's scary
S0091	next on the right
S0179	just on the bend isn't it
S0091	yeah
S0179	yep not very easy
S0058	oh
S0179	to see it have to be say
S0058	farm there be sell box of egg
S0179	i don't want a box i just want one egg
S0058	they be quite big box as well
S0179	okay
S0058	i think we've probably still get some egg in from er
S0179	oh at farm in wales they have duck egg from the duck on
S0058	oh nice
S0179	on the farm
S0058	i dunno if i ever have duck egg
S0179	i can't remember have it i'm sure it be good in an omelette on one occasion
S0058	um yeah i'm sure i have have i probably have have duck egg at some point but i imagine they're huge and um
S0179	you think they'd be intrinsically very big
S0058	yeah i'm i'm sure duck egg be bigger um i'm sure i've see them you know on there's a market stall outside the centre that sell them i think they be big
S0179	mm
S0058	so you could get a nice big fry egg
S0179	mm and
S0058	don't all there's a
S0179	however many people be about to beat you with stick
S0058	yeah warn where be that we stay that um they have load of sort of food when we get there so there be big egg and butter and milk and stuff in the be it
S0179	um
S0058	oh no er not um
S0179	could've be or it could've be no we be actually stay in hay weren't we
S0058	no no 's in
S0179	oh alright er
S0058	we be stay near near i can't remember the name of the actual place
S0179	no nor can i actually
S0091	right at the top
S0179	yep ah yes this be one of those point where we stop climb now we're gonna hang back because they be gonna cut the corner yep think so
S0179	they're really not make rapid progress
S0179	it be just a haze over there
S0058	yeah
S0179	specific meteorological condition
S0058	yeah nice view though
S0179	what you can see
S0058	hmm
S0179	what you can see yeah there's a thing there for a taylor wimpey development
S0058	near
S0179	yeah but sort of round here
S0058	mm okay
S0179	at a guess
S0058	keep our eye open tempt
S0179	holiday home
S0058	hmm ah that look a a very quiet pub
S0179	nice that you can just pop into a pub on a slow saturday afternoon
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's quite nice that pub in ely actually
S0058	yeah that be more of a chainy type pub though but it be very nice
S0179	just the experience of sort of go in on a sunday
S0058	oh right
S0179	for full on
S0058	yeah
S0058	well we could do that tomorrow if you want for lunch
S0179	er i be plan on have breakfast for lunch tomorrow
S0058	fair enough we could buy some brunch stuff if you want or just have breakfast
S0179	just have breakfast really i like brunch occasionally but not as a regular thing
S0058	yeah no fair enough mm
S0058	yes indeed
S0179	it's an awful lot more pleasant drive along here than on the a303
S0179	ooh
S0058	it's very ooh yes
S0179	er yes what be you do have to get past but
S0058	ff
S0179	you can't just
S0179	you can't just reverse
S0058	yeah
S0179	into a national speed limit a road
S0058	in the wrong direction
S0179	er yes indeed that's not how it work
S0058	really bad
S0179	mm
S0058	it's weird how all these sign be all for er you know like on the for the wrong road if you like
S0179	in what oh yes i see what you mean
S0058	all the sign from that road you could see perfectly well on this road they be sort of on the wrong side of it
S0179	quite steep
S0058	mm
S0179	the er three o three's be flatten out a bite
S0058	right
S0179	in comparison to er to be fair that's wow the cow
S0058	they look quite content
S0179	mm pig
S0058	yes
S0179	chicken
S0058	one of us be gonna see another speedy sheep
S0179	horse wow this be a
S0058	ah
S0179	real beginner's tour to farmyard england
S0058	yeah
S0179	we've see some chickens and some pig there
S0058	well there's some nearby pig very nice pig
S0179	they seem very nice pig might have be horrible pig
S0058	they look nice i guess that's all you can really ask for in a pig
S0058	mm
S0179	again it would be fun to ride a motorbike in this sort of weather
S0058	very warm
S0179	actually yeah they must've be very hot
S0058	yeah i've don't fancy that
S0179	i don't think you'd look very good in leather
S0058	you don't
S0179	no
S0058	no
S0179	quite funny perhaps
S0058	not really my look
S0179	mm oh dear it's er it's interest about
S0058	what that she's just drop out of college
S0179	yeah ff huh
S0058	you're sort of worry she's gonna go the same way that just sort of drift about
S0179	well
S0058	but he's actually get qualifications be the thing
S0179	yeah he's actually very well qualify and he work very hard
S0058	yeah
S0179	but the problem be i can kind of see it er from her perspective because i imagine he's be try but he's not the most he must be a nightmare to have as a father
S0058	yeah
S0058	well do you think she's sort of be test and just go oh i'll leave college and he's go i i don't care leave college or do you think he's be like you will go to college so she's leave as a sort of
S0179	i don't know but
S0058	yeah
S0179	i can just imagine her sort of cos i imagine he's try very seriously to tell her no look you need an education you need an education to
S0058	right but maybe
S0179	make your life easier
S0058	yeah
S0179	but i don't think that cos a lot of the stuff you can like a lot of the stuff he say as a father you well you should ignore
S0058	yes so that yeah the fact
S0058	that that's actually true
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean and i don't think she's a dreadfully easy daughter so
S0058	no
S0179	but i could i can see her side of it
S0058	yes yeah she might go back of course
S0179	she might well do
S0058	you know she might learn for herself that she's gonna need like your mum be say that she's work with other people whose don't have anything any qualifications or anything and it's not particularly nice
S0179	mm
S0058	and she might think well actually if i if i can train in this area
S0179	mm
S0058	or you know do an apprenticeship or do something kind of
S0179	mm this be a very long section at forty miles an hour
S0179	this be a very long section at forty miles an hour
S0058	yeah
S0179	a village which grow up along the london road
S0058	ah
S0179	interest how things cos that's what melbourn be of course it be originally a sort of coach
S0058	right
S0179	stop from to
S0058	ah yeah i guess so interest
S0179	and then the bypass be open
S0058	yeah
S0058	oh excuse me
S0179	excuse
S0058	that's
S0179	wow hang gliders
S0058	oh cool
S0179	grandpa look you can just about er can you move your head thank you must be a good day for all the thermals
S0058	mm
S0179	er what do she say
S0058	um she say it's it it would it be alright to pick her up from the station she get in at five to six that's actually better than earlier because it'll be quieter
S0179	yeah
S0058	for drive
S0179	um if huh i'm just think where her ticket's to where she's gonna change cos if it's down to and then up again actually there's possibly better options like would be better or would be better so er it'd be worth actually get that information out of her
S0058	okay yeah
S0179	cos although you know to fair it's not her fault
S0058	no no
S0179	i mean would be the obvious option
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	um but
S0058	be be be
S0179	i mean just next time you should explain to her
S0058	yeah
S0179	go to
S0058	yeah
S0179	um but yeah if she have to come through and that train may well stop in then
S0058	yeah then that would be
S0058	okay that's yeah i will yeah i'll i'll text her back in a bite and ask
S0179	alright yeah a lot easier be just to give her a call on the way home
S0058	okay
S0179	mm
S0058	then i'll just run past her what she need to bring
S0179	mhm interestingly be actually closer geographically the station that be
S0058	to
S0179	yeah
S0058	right
S0179	i be just look at one of the property websites
S0058	right
S0179	and it's you know what do she need to bring swim and gym kit er
S0058	well not er just um sort of work so she doesn't need to bring towel for example
S0179	mm if she want a gym towel she might wanna bring that
S0058	mm
S0179	as in we can probably provide her with one but it might be
S0179	oh dear huh mm that's very kind thank you uh four
S0179	that's a hilarious look plate
S0058	r o presumably
S0058	that must have be a present
S0179	yeah i be gonna say
S0179	i think it's really odd get a car as a present
S0058	mm
S0179	as in like
S0058	yeah
S0179	a sort of a kind of big bow on it
S0058	yeah surprise
S0179	well lot of um sort of sort of recently teenage girls
S0058	mm
S0179	seem to get that from their parent
S0058	yeah yeah um
S0179	presumably because teenage boys would just destroy it in a matter of days
S0179	um i do think that the car that simon get like er to some extent that make sense because you know it's not gonna cost anything to replace
S0058	yeah
S0179	on the other hand it mean that he be quite likely to be kill in it
S0058	yes exactly
S0179	um and mum's attitude for get the yaris be she be quite happy to dad just like spend money
S0058	yeah
S0179	she like spend money because it be buy nine airbags
S0058	yes indeed pay for safety
S0179	be a very good thing so
S0058	mm
S0179	i couldn't quite i still couldn't believe that they be get me a car yet alone i think they be get me something like er i i i assume my first car i never really think about it but i
S0058	yeah
S0179	sort of have a mental picture of sort of some shitty ford ka
S0058	yeah
S0179	or something along those line whereas yeah
S0058	yeah second hand small
S0179	well er and welcome to third gear
S0179	so we'll be stay in this gear
S0179	for the remainder of this hill
S0058	nice
S0179	which seem to be continue for quite a way
S0179	now after a brief flirtation with fourth
S0179	you've guess it
S0179	it go back into third
S0058	nice
S0179	it's a balance up this hill between carry enough momentum to keep the car move effectively but also not go too fast round the bend from a visibility perspective
S0058	yeah
S0179	i think a balance which have be win on this occasion
S0058	mm excellent
S0179	mm the car park's just up here to the leave should probably have bring some sun cream
S0058	really won't be hot for very long
S0179	well we catch the sun in derbyshire or at least i do
S0058	yeah but we be out all day
S0179	er let's go in the shade
S0058	cunning
S0179	thank you mr caravan
S0058	excellent
