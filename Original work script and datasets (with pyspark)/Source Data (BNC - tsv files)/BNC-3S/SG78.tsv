S0337	for
S0341	mm
S0337	for twenty two quid
S0336	for twenty two quid
S0336	i be think about this though i think what we should've do be take the meat out of the packets maybe put it either in tupperware or freeze it straightaway because when i cook that mince last night it wasn't off by any mean but it have already go a bite brown
S0341	mm
S0337	mince be alright brown though beef
S0336	and er well i wouldn't have cook it if i didn't think it be okay but
S0337	yeah it's good it's good it's even better
S0336	how's it even better that's a bite of a claim
S0337	no definitely be i think you're mean to make you're mean to let steak go slightly brown
S0341	you be
S0337	you why be that funny
S0337	just trust me
S0336	okay famous last word
S0337	mm mm
S0341	er do you know there's a lot of food waste around ain't there because people use those use by date as erm
S0337	use by date or they use best before date as
S0341	gospel you know
S0337	yeah
S0341	and i think sometimes
S0337	er i agree
S0341	you can actually use products
S0336	i know but we've get we leave
S0337	get bacon leave that's it
S0336	get bacon leave yeah which i think we'll probably use tomorrow night
S0337	yeah
S0336	and i'm sure it's fine but obviously it it
S0337	it's not vacuum pack
S0336	it isn't vacuum pack so
S0337	no
S0336	you're just it's not it isn't gonna keep quite as long
S0337	agree
S0336	but you should've see these chickens
S0337	chickens
S0336	chickens whole chickens no erm we buy some chicken breast they be the most expensive thing we buy i think we pay like er
S0337	pay eight quid
S0336	yeah eight pound for four erm but i have honestly never see chicken breast so big
S0341	mm
S0336	they be absolutely huge like
S0337	you know when they're cut slightly in half and it's like flat they all have like er
S0336	basically another breast
S0337	another breast yeah
S0341	right
S0337	i'd say that little flap be about the same size as a normal breast
S0341	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0337	it be crazy they be huge absolutely huge
S0341	mm
S0336	so that be quite nice make this little like tomato crème fraîche dish thing it be really good we've still get some this be the thing though like we've we've be cook so much in the even that there's plenty to take for lunch like not normally just the next day but the day after that as well
S0341	yeah
S0336	like actually have a choice of leftovers this morning
S0341	mm
S0336	when he go to work
S0337	oh yeah
S0336	so it be go a long way but like i go and do a big shop on sunday morning cos we be have over and over for a barbecue i spend like seventy quid but i buy so like obviously we'd already do the meat shop on the saturday
S0341	mm
S0336	so that's seventy quid like without any meat which be quite a lot of money
S0337	there's clean stuff in there as well
S0336	but yeah i have buy like fabric softener and kitchen bathroom cleaner all that kind of stuff
S0341	mm
S0336	and there be like a couple of things that kind of top it over the edge and actually we'll have a quiet week next week cos 's go into hospital on tuesday
S0341	okay
S0337	yeah
S0336	and erm
S0337	so i won't eat
S0336	so he won't be eat much on tuesday and then we're away from thursday through to monday so i imagine we'll just try to make do with what we've get in the cupboards
S0341	mm
S0337	get fish and stuff
S0336	we've get fish we've get other stuff as well that we'll make do
S0341	er be you have that procedure do at our place or at the
S0337	again
S0336	guess what time they've give him do i tell you quarter past four
S0341	oh for goodness sake
S0337	bite harsh isn't it
S0336	we
S0336	we need we need to go back through the literature cos i'm not really sure whether he he can have dinner the night before or not cos it's so late i'm i think he might have to take those sachets like first thing in the morning
S0337	no one's the night before
S0336	do you think so even er even
S0337	i think i think they're both the night before
S0336	even for a four o'clock appointment
S0337	i think they're both the night before
S0336	mm i'm not sure
S0337	still a long way
S0336	i'm sure it be like if you be in the morning you take them the day before both of them one at lunch one at dinner but if you're in er an afternoon appointment you take one the night before and one first thing in the morning i'm almost certain of it
S0337	okay not too sure about that
S0336	well we'll that's what i mean we need to go back through it don't we
S0337	yep
S0336	but yeah
S0341	it would seem an extraordinarily long time between kind of eat the even before cos i'm sure once you start take them you're not suppose to eat again after that but
S0336	no
S0337	i definitely can't eat that day i know that
S0336	we'll have to think of something nice you can eat afterwards
S0341	but i think i think you probably can have clear liquids so you might find there might be a soup a clear soup that you can buy
S0336	yeah or you can just like save yourself and like binge on tuesday night when you get back
S0337	oh yeah
S0336	although the last even if you're hungry the last thing you might feel like do after that be eat
S0341	oh right er well personally i find that one better than the endoscopy
S0337	yeah see
S0337	mm
S0341	i think it just kind of do your dignity
S0337	mm
S0341	dent your dignity rather than it be painful or
S0336	yeah
S0337	yep
S0341	mm
S0336	be happy to start get some answer i think er
S0341	mm
S0337	mm
S0336	it'll be worth it
S0341	mm
S0336	i'm erm i'm gonna go in early on tuesday so that i can come back and take him
S0341	yeah
S0336	save come all the way over again cos i think get the key to his bungalow
S0341	mm
S0336	yesterday from what i er from what i er well i think that's what be try to say
S0341	okay
S0336	so erm they be keep it a secret cos they didn't want him to know when all of his stuff be come down erm
S0337	cos he he keep wake up really early for no reason
S0341	mm
S0337	so like when he have his cast off he wake up at i think it be wake up at five o'clock for a ten be appointment in there's no need for him to be up that early
S0341	mm
S0337	just to get dress
S0336	so yeah so they've be keep it from him and also because erm they wanna get the bathroom and kitchen sort before he actually move in
S0341	mm
S0336	so they didn't want him to think that oh because he's get the key to his bungalow he's move in
S0341	yeah
S0336	erm but as far as i can tell the erm they go to see the bathroom people in that we kind of accidentally find when we be look for like a heat towel rail or something erm they be really really really nice to us so we go back and sort of say oh when it come to do 's bathroom like it's probably worth like talk to them and really like the guy so
S0341	mm
S0336	erm i think they're gonna go through them to do all the bathroom stuff and he seem to think that they can act on it like straightaway
S0341	yeah
S0336	so hopefully it won't be too long cos i think i mean you're not completely convince by him live on his own anyway be you but
S0337	no i'm just worry about him i don't think he's ready again
S0336	but they need to try it don't they
S0337	yeah
S0336	they need to try it they need to give him his independence and er like he's really get to be the one that say oh actually you know like i probably can't do this yeah
S0337	can't do this yeah
S0336	mm we'll see it's all be kick off this week erm have his final erm exam this week as well
S0337	yeah
S0341	okay
S0336	erm so he sit i don't know how much of it you know or remember or anything like that but he sit an exam back in may all of the penultimate exams but it's supposedly the hardest one you sit and he be basically say that over half the people that sit it fail it
S0341	right
S0336	and he come out of it wasn't really sure how he'd do et cetera et cetera but when he get his result back i think he er get like fifty six percent or something which be more than what he far more than what he
S0337	no there be a few of them he do he get like seventies and
S0336	oh yeah he get some really really amaze result
S0341	mm
S0336	but he get like fifty six percent on this exam that basically most people fail
S0337	be that the one
S0336	no and then er and then a collection of like basically fairly outstanding result so he's really really chuff he get a letter a couple of weeks tell him that he be like one of the top in the uk for
S0337	no ninth overall so that's that's in europe isn't
S0336	yeah it will still be in the it won't be europe
S0337	he do be for out of out of people in europe
S0336	really
S0337	yep
S0341	mm
S0337	it be out of five thousand five hundred people or something
S0336	and come ninth
S0337	come ninth
S0341	that's impressive
S0337	yeah he must be do something right
S0336	mm
S0337	not bad erm he i haven't tell you about the cos i speak to him today erm his latest plan be that they're gonna build a house
S0336	okay
S0337	and have already apply for plan
S0336	i don't think that's er i don't think
S0337	i don't know but
S0336	no
S0337	still
S0336	have they find a plot of land or anything surely if they're apply for plan permission
S0337	right so it turn out that obviously own their house
S0336	yeah
S0337	he own the house that and be in he also own the other bungalow there which be kind of between them so you know the track go like that and then go down
S0336	yeah so they wanna build a house next to her parent
S0337	they're gonna build a house there in the
S0336	oh
S0337	at the bungalow's back garden
S0336	oh
S0337	er cos 's gonna give them the land and they've already apply for plan so yeah okay great er the conversation be obviously about about
S0336	that's fairly big news and i think they'll get a lot more for their money build their house
S0337	you know he say it'll cost them like a hundred and something k
S0336	oh yeah
S0337	and it'll be worth like two hundred and something
S0336	and the rest
S0341	mm
S0336	give the location but they're commit themselves to live next to her parent for a considerable amount of time
S0337	yeah and the deal be would be that they can't sell it to someone else so they'd have to keep it or sell it to because he doesn't want some randomers sit in the house between
S0341	mm
S0337	three of his house yeah
S0336	that's very very generous of
S0337	what to give them the garden
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah i didn't get to the end of the conversation cos er it cut out and then never call me back
S0336	yeah
S0336	that's that's
S0341	that's huge
S0336	that's yeah
S0341	mm
S0336	that's really big news that's excite
S0337	yeah
S0336	and it's scary as hell and it's gonna take them well
S0336	have watch grand design it could take them twelve to eighteen months to actually have a house that's like inhabitable
S0337	yeah but they've get one to live in the whole time
S0336	oh yeah
S0337	and if they don't even er cos i think they'd have to do it off loan the begin cos you can't get a mortgage for a plot of land
S0336	no
S0337	so buy it start it off with loan and then once they've get
S0337	part of the house
S0336	mm
S0337	they can mortgage it
S0336	erm it's not quite part of the house the house have to actually look like a house you can't
S0337	just look like a house
S0336	erm
S0341	it have to have four wall
S0336	yeah
S0341	and a door
S0336	so it it effectively have to be kind of inhabitable for you to be able to get a mortgage
S0337	er a shell a shell at least
S0336	yeah
S0341	mm
S0336	so you can't it's not like you can put the foundations down and be like okay now i'll get a mortgage on the foundations like it do have to still have to resemble a house but yeah that's that's that's how they do it on on like grand design and stuff they tend to erm they tend to erm use any save and stuff they have to like buy buy the land and then they'll take loan out on the build and then like throughout the process they'll apply for a mortgage and then kind of gradually as the house get more and more finish as it be and the value increase they can increase the mortgage
S0337	okay
S0336	so effectively like if the house be just as it be obviously it'll be value a lot less than if it's a finish house so they'll get a loan out then once it's value at a little bite
S0337	er so if they get if they get the land i don't know how much money he's get i presume it's quite a lot because of his salary must be a lot i don't know any of this stuff but
S0336	yeah
S0337	er
S0341	what do he do now where be he work
S0337	he be an accountant he's not charter
S0336	er just in er independent like accountancy firm i think
S0337	and i don't think before i don't know if i can erm yeah erm but he's be earn he must be on a decent whack
S0341	mm
S0337	erm and then
S0336	and to think that he's save enough for a deposit down there which would've be substantial
S0337	yeah he's get he's get enough for a deposit
S0336	stamp duty on top of that like all the legal fee on
S0341	mm
S0336	like
S0337	when they be yeah when they be look for a house
S0336	they have a substantial amount
S0337	the only thing that be wait for be that extra six months worth of salary they advise you to have
S0341	mm
S0337	in case you lose your job and that's the only bite he didn't have erm so yeah he must be on a decent wage so if he have that they've get er land give to them and they're get a loan he's laugh
S0336	mm and er they will the loan'll be fairly high interest so it
S0337	yeah
S0336	it'll be it'll be a bite crap to start with because they'll probably be pay quite a lot of money each month to pay for the loan but as soon as they can mortgage that it'll become a lot like a lot more manageable because i'm pretty sure obviously with personal loan you you can't have them anywhere near as long as you have the mortgage which be why the repayments be so high and the interest rat will be generally be a bite higher than they be
S0341	mm
S0336	in the mortgage as well
S0341	yeah
S0336	so i imagine it'll be one of those things they will be able to get a loan but they actually probably
S0337	they want to get a mortgage straightaway yeah
S0336	they're have to get it as soon as possible yeah
S0341	mm
S0336	but i mean be the perfect person to be do something like that because he'll be able to like effectively like project manage it so that he know like where where the money's go and stuff like that
S0337	yeah obviously she's in she's be in she's do her charter survey she's get a master's in like erm er what what be her job before erm estate agency or something like that erm so she's not she know what she's do on that side of things and he's
S0336	mm
S0337	know what he's do on the money side of things
S0336	that's excite
S0341	it be isn't it
S0337	yeah
S0336	mm don't er i don't envy them tie themselves quite like that
S0336	cos like to to sort of say like oh you're not just live in like her parents' like back garden as it be but then to sort of say oh you're not actually just allow to up and sell like you either have to sell it to me or like you know we have to come to sort of some sort of arrangement that's a huge commitment
S0337	yeah
S0341	yes cos i mean if if they can only sell it back to him
S0337	oh no yeah
S0341	they've get they've gotta accept his offer
S0336	mm
S0337	well yeah i think they'd end up get lease it out once it's complete and then get an actual mortgage on a house or something i dunno
S0336	well who know
S0337	open doors doesn't it
S0341	yeah
S0337	well you could mortgage that and use yours as a i dunno
S0341	mm
S0337	they'd they'd work it out so yeah i never get to the end of it cos yeah
S0336	i can't believe they've already i can't really believe they've already apply for plan permission either cos that mean they've already get plan draw up like
S0337	no you can get plan permission to have use the land as
S0336	just a dwell
S0337	a dwell yeah
S0341	mm
S0336	i think when you apply for plan permission you have to have like oh this er
S0337	no i think
S0336	this be what we're apply for
S0337	i think you can apply to build like a two two storey two bed house or something
S0336	oh right okay
S0337	erm and then you can then you have to have all the relevant party that it would affect like to be in on it so then you've gotta tell people but obviously the bungalow that's there be be rent out to someone er let out to someone so they'd have to tell i dunno
S0336	i don't think as erm like if they be rent
S0337	tenant
S0336	yeah
S0337	no but still yeah
S0336	a courtesy thing yeah that's quite excite though now i i would love to build my own house but i'd be so scar that
S0337	well that look not a dream house to build be it that's just a
S0336	no it's just a oh this this be the best option we have at the moment i'm so fickle as well like one minute i'd be like yeah this be exactly this be exactly what i want this be the perfect use of this space this be gonna be like a brilliant house and then i'd build it and be like oh why do i put that wall there or like why have i choose to do that that way or
S0341	mm
S0336	oh why didn't i try that or why didn't we do this and you can't blame anyone you can't be like oh well you know no house be perfect or well this be just the way it come because you put it like that
S0341	mm
S0336	you choose to do it
S0337	mm
S0336	but that's excite
S0341	mm
S0336	so when be he put a ring on her finger
S0337	dunno they keep like push it back for like
S0336	yeah
S0337	reason
S0336	yeah oh i'm just gonna finish my exams oh just
S0337	gonna build a house
S0336	gonna wait till the house be build oh right okay
S0341	mm
S0337	yeah i don't know if mum and dad know even i think it be interest
S0341	mm
S0336	i would i don't think your mum do know cos i almost feel like she'd be sob while she be tell us
S0337	why that she's lose him
S0336	yeah like that's not just lose him that's like oh i'm gonna build a house in my mother in law's garden
S0337	yeah but i hear not long ago that i hear not long ago that they could er always move back up here to commute to cos there's obviously more opportunities for both of their professions in
S0341	mm
S0336	and up north i hear that they they know like with his skills could go anywhere why live in one of the most expensive part in the country
S0337	yeah
S0336	it's the same with her like both of them be transferable skills
S0341	they be suppose to be develop the north aren't they where do i er there be also erm oh i think you may've mention it a few months back that the east the kind of
S0337	east
S0341	east anglia
S0341	and that be gonna be the most develop erm area over the next five years
S0336	they're put so they're put so much money into like and even like as a hub they've spend all that money on a train station to like increase it's capacity they're put more and more rout though because it's so centralise cos the rout to the north at the moment be they're not strong enough it it take like three hours on a train from here to get to like take you want pud what do you want
S0337	scone
S0336	scone
S0336	erm yeah so erm from it can take anything three and a half four hours to get from to well be one of the biggest cities in the north to say that especially the bbc be move up to and stuff to say that it still take four hours to get from one to the other be just ridiculous
S0341	mm
S0336	erm
S0337	well there be something in the news about tourists come here and it map out like tourist attractions from and how long it take and i think be one of the examples
S0336	mm
S0337	and it be a joke
S0341	mm
S0337	like the route that you have to take be so obscure
S0337	and like hard cos er it's just such a bad country for transport
S0341	yeah
S0337	and just
S0336	mm
S0337	get around we're not a big country
S0336	but like it's not as if rail's even cheap now so i'm concern that if they be plan to put a load more infrastructure in that the only way they're gonna be able to pay for it be by charge the people who be use the train so
S0341	gonna wait until that hs2 be build won't they
S0337	yeah but that's still another three or four years years
S0336	what's that
S0337	hs2
S0341	hs2
S0336	yeah it's a way off still i think
S0341	do you want any fork or or spoon
S0337	i won't use a fork
S0337	i'll use my hand
S0341	
S0336	erm
S0337	use a fork
S0336	i probably should use a fork
S0337	what for
S0336	it's just etiquette isn't it
S0341	mm
S0336	erm yeah i might have a little dessert fork please do you have a preference to scone or turnover
S0336	okay i think i'm gonna go scone then
S0337	
S0336	do it pass the touch test or
S0337	i dunno i might i might might
S0341	you didn't want one do you
S0337	er no thank
S0336	well it wouldn't be unlike you to not have both so
S0337	i don't know what to do
S0336	well they need eat
S0337	can i one of those please
S0336	not satisfactory
S0337	it's alright actually
S0336	they have be there since sunday so they've definitely like see better days
S0337	that's what they say about you
S0336	that's just rude
S0336	how's
S0341	he's alright
S0337	be he at football
S0341	yes but he he seem he seem happy that he'd get to speak to you tonight at some point so
S0336	he's
S0337	oh he's be work
S0341	er he have be work yes
S0337	oh good
S0341	the last couple of weeks so
S0341	mm
S0337	yeah
S0341	mm
S0336	yeah that's good news but still not
S0336	still not make a lot of money
S0341	no
S0337	yeah but i think he's always happier when he's busy
S0336	mm
S0341	he do seem to have a bite of er a bounce if you like because he like what he's do
S0337	yeah
S0341	i think he enjoy the physical labour be outdoors
S0336	and i think it make a huge difference when you do something that you want to talk to people about
S0341	mm
S0336	so like he can come home and he can talk about the project he's work on
S0341	mm
S0336	talk about the things he's learn or where he's be work whereas in previous job it be just all so monotonous
S0341	yes
S0336	i don't think he could even bring himself to like talk about it
S0341	mm
S0336	when he wasn't work

S0336	yeah
S0341	yeah
S0336	well it'll be nice to see him as well he keep say he's gonna like pop in and never do so
S0341	well i think he may he may just be reluctant to just drop in and he hasn't have any credit for his phone for months
S0336	well if he's drive all the way over to for football like two or three time a week he might as well like pop in on his way just to say hi or on his way back for a drink like he's more than welcome to
S0341	well yeah
S0336	dad do it like a couple of weeks ago literally just drop in on his way back from the golf course like it's almost nicer to see people like that
S0341	mm
S0336	because it doesn't feel like it put you out that much just for them to pop in and say
S0341	mm
S0336	hi
S0341	yes and i nearly do that at the weekend but i think mm i really want a really quiet
S0341	do nothing weekend so

S0341	be you happy with it
S0336	oh yeah i might do actually
S0337	erm yeah i'll show you in a bite that's good erm and then and pop round like literally as we we'd finish put it together and then mum and and grandpa pop round
S0336	with the hoover she's donate us her upstairs hoover
S0337	but apparently there's a hole in the tube so you can't use the well you can use the the nozzle but you've gotta like play around with it
S0336	we're just grateful cos the house be start to look really messy
S0337	yeah
S0336	er like the messy that's like not messy just like
S0341	yeah
S0337	just a bite of fluff on the floor
S0336	yeah
S0337	and er
S0336	obviously with it be a new carpet as well like and cream you just see absolutely everything and it's get really frustrate and
S0337	stuff in the tile as well
S0341	mm
S0336	like go into curry at the weekend and the dysons all have a hundred quid off and we're like that be a really good offer but even with a hundred quid off they be still two hundred and fifty quid and we be like
S0337	the cheap no the cheapest one be two hundred and fifty quid
S0341	well er i don't know if the offer will still be on but there be a couple of hoover in tesco's for fifty pound
S0337	be they what be they like
S0341	but they're new and they're they be the highest power
S0337	that you're allow these days
S0341	mm
S0336	mm
S0341	so
S0337	they've make they've totally like zap that haven't they
S0341	they have recently
S0337	yeah
S0341	but obviously there's gonna be er retailers who've get stock of
S0341	the higher power stuff so
S0336	yeah
S0337	how much be yours if you don't mind me ask be it er hundreds still
S0341	erm
S0337	cos er the
S0341	i think it be below two hundred
S0337	ah
S0336	er cos that we want yours like the little lightweight ones
S0337	yeah
S0336	we can't find them anywhere
S0337	er well no there there be one that it's the same as that but it be
S0336	be er wasn't lightweight though
S0337	no it wasn't wasn't as light no
S0341	i saw it be advertise on the telly the other night and it be over two hundred pound
S0337	two yeah yeah they be
S0341	i mean i i just don't know why it's that expensive
S0337	i think they're head and shoulder above the rest
S0341	mm
S0337	they er they really be
S0336	yeah and we're we're really struggle to like between that oh do we buy one for the sake of have one or do we
S0341	mm
S0336	hold out until we can afford a decent one that probably won't need replace any time soon
S0341	mm
S0336	cos that's that's kind of what's more important to us it's like
S0341	yeah
S0336	okay so we might have a lot of expenditure over the next
S0337	mm
S0336	twelve months while we effectively like set up the house but once it's set up as long as long as you've buy decent stuff
S0341	mm
S0337	it should be yeah
S0336	in the next five years you shouldn't have to replace anything
S0337	oh and we've get a microwave don't know if you know
S0336	microwave and
S0337	it's not it's
S0336	we've get a toaster on the way as well
S0337	yeah it wasn't a panasonic they be a bite too expensive but it be on offer again at curry
S0341	mm
S0336	a hundred and twenty quid
S0337	it's silver and leave mark you leave them
S0337	if you touch it it just leave a smudge it's terrible
S0336	but it's a combination oven and it's get like a grill and everything as well you literally can do everything on there
S0337	it's huge
S0336	its even get a cake function which love
S0337	huge
S0336	we've not be able to take advantage of that i can't work it know how to work it i don't know how to work it
S0337	it's huge
S0336	but it's massive yeah
S0337	i'm just gonna keep say it's huge
S0341	good
S0336	but we're get there slowly but surely
S0341	good i think you've do well so far
S0336	well we've we indulge massively with the toaster cos erm 's parent have get a de'longhi one
S0337	oh no
S0336	and it's just it's just a really nice toaster and it that be on offer in curry it have like twenty or thirty quid off
S0337	buy it
S0336	still fifty quid
S0341	mm
S0336	but in the grand scheme of things we're like ah well all the cheaper toasters be naff i can't eat anymore so yeah we're get there i've also buy our little shoe bench and coat rack this week because well obviously cos er cos it's be cold and we've have coat out and stuff you suddenly realise like how annoy it be to not have anywhere to put them like they're all live on the
S0341	mm
S0336	guest bed at the moment but as soon as one of us wear one
S0337	you don't wanna walk all the way upstairs mm
S0336	it's downstairs somewhere yeah so it's hang over the bannister or it's just like hang off a door somewhere which be just really irritate
S0341	mm
S0336	and all our shoe just keep gather by the front door which just you just the make the place look just look like a mess so i've order those they'll be come next week so they should get deliver while 's off which be quite nice
S0341	mm
S0336	and then after that like the house the house function as it be now like to a certain extent like
S0337	we've no bin
S0336	still don't have any bin it's be nearly four weeks and we've not get bin
S0337	we ask the sales department and you email the erm council
S0336	i email the council last week basically say the developers do say that they put in an order for this but we haven't receive any bin yet so if you have receive an order from them can you please expedite it so we have our bin soon
S0341	mm
S0336	or if you haven't receive an order can you treat this as an order for bin
S0341	mm
S0336	but i haven't hear i haven't have a response and bin haven't turn up so
S0341	phone them up
S0336	yeah but
S0337	tell them we won't pay our council tax
S0336	it's not like they've try to charge us council tax yet
S0337	they will
S0336	well it's just irritate like we're still have to like do midnight skip run because we're embarrass that we're bin all our stuff in the skip
S0337	yeah
S0336	you should've see it this table and chair right come in four separate box and i mean like giant box and er we be literally like how the hell do we get rid of all of this
S0337	no it come in six box
S0336	do it
S0337	two of them be the seat cover
S0336	oh yeah
S0341	you see you're not far from the tip be you at so
S0336	no
S0337	not really
S0341	just take your stuff round there
S0336	well that's what we decide we decide that if we couldn't bin them we'd just take them to the tip but
S0337	we've we've bin them
S0336	but we've bin them
S0337	we've get one box leave
S0336	well actually i spend age cut the box down like with a stanley knife so i actually manage to get all of the box into two
S0337	but these they're up like here and like that wide
S0336	i mean yeah they they're they're the size of
S0341	mm
S0336	two chair
S0341	mm
S0336	so they be big erm but we we dump one in the skip the other the other night well do and it be so obvious like it be basically er basically fill the whole tip like yeah they're not gonna notice that but we be too scar to do both on the same night because it really would look ridiculous so we do one the other night and we've get one we might have to try and ditch tonight
S0341	so why don't they want you don't they want you
S0337	no they say we can but it's just embarrass
S0336	they have yeah they i mean
S0341	no
S0337	yeah it be it be it really be
S0336	they have say like
S0341	mm
S0336	obviously until the bin turn up we we can use the skip at our leisure and stuff and i don't think we're the only ones take advantage of that like i think other people on site
S0341	mm
S0336	be take advantage of have a skip on their doorstep but it be embarrass like these box be so ridiculously big
S0337	erm no one else be do that
S0336	they be
S0337	who
S0336	both next door neighbour be when the skip be right opposite us
S0337	mm yeah
S0341	you er you be still you be still move in at the end of the day and it you know it should be expect if they if they don't provide you with rubbish bin you gotta put it somewhere
S0336	i know there's a well there's a couple of irritate things that have happen as well like we've be basically until the windows be sort last week we be still technically go through the site for everything whereas now we go through customer care if we've get any problems with the house
S0337	we're do the survey
S0341	mm
S0336	hamptons survey yeah but there's a couple of grip so like the toilet in our en suite doesn't work and we're not
S0337	it do work
S0336	well it do work it doesn't flush properly
S0337	it do flush
S0336	oh but basically once you've flush it it continually er try to fill itself
S0337	no no it doesn't quite fill itself properly and trickle down the back it trickle into the toilet pan so it just always you can hear run water
S0341	so it's on all the time
S0336	yeah
S0341	it
S0337	but all you have to do be go up to the back of it and just tap it again and then it it kind of flick it back into just fill the tank at the back someone forget to do that this morning someone else walk in to the en suite this even and it be still trickle since this morning
S0336	anyway
S0337	that's a lot of water
S0336	and so apparently now we've get no outdoor water
S0341	be it be it water that be it water that you're just it's come from your
S0337	the rain
S0336	yeah it's not it's not
S0341	connect water
S0336	it's not it's not us we're not spend a fortune on water but be like oh there's no water in the outdoor tap
S0337	we've either empty the the tank at the back or we've be use mains water i can't remember what set we've get it on
S0336	not sure
S0337	yeah we'll have to look
S0336	but the back doors also stick not stick they erm
S0337	rub on the floor
S0336	yeah
S0337	they're about a millimetre or two too low
S0336	yeah
S0337	so when you're open when you open one of them it it's a bite stiff and it's not very nice when you open the other one you can hear the plastic from where it go down the door rub against the floor and then when you try and pull it up onto the frame where the metal be
S0336	it's horrible
S0337	it screech
S0341	they need they need the the in the hinge
S0337	just to raise it slightly
S0341	it just
S0337	yeah
S0341	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0341	but it er you know they need to do it
S0337	yeah
S0341	because they be
S0336	i know
S0341	the professionals so
S0336	we're just bid our time a little bite because we kick up such a fuss about that outdoor light and they be actually they end up be quite nice about fit it cos they they didn't they weren't oblige to do it at all and from all account head office
S0337	and their head office yeah
S0336	basically tell them not to do it we've be tell not to mention it on the survey and stuff because
S0337	mm
S0336	they basically go against their order
S0337	but they do bend over backwards in the end after a bite of a fight
S0336	yeah so
S0337	mm
S0336	i feel bad find stuff
S0341	you can't live with it as it be cos you'll actually do you more damage open the doors
S0336	i know
S0337	yeah
S0336	i know
S0341	and then you know if it can be see that you've ignore the problem you'll be charge for their labour to put it right
S0336	mm
S0341	or the replacement doors
S0337	yeah yeah
S0336	do get a little mini win as well erm so i don't know if mention it to you but like you know he's get a build mate that do all of his build stuff they do the extension and do his patio and stuff like that
S0341	mm
S0336	from all account 's about to spend a lot of money with him do like various job like
S0337	no he's spend a lot of money
S0336	well he have spend a lot
S0336	he be about to though as well he's book him in for like a whole week in october
S0337	but it i think it be from he'd spend a lot of money and he'd make him a lot of money
S0341	mm
S0337	because people keep call up and want to well people have be round to see the extension
S0341	yeah
S0337	and it's get a lot more work and make him a lot of money
S0336	yeah
S0337	so as a favour he turn round and say er dad mention that we want the obviously the drive extend slightly and er the patio make a bite bigger and then
S0336	mm
S0337	the bite round the side do and 's turn round and say well if you get us the materials if i get the materials he'll do it for free
S0341	good
S0337	so that's amaze
S0336	yeah
S0341	that be good yeah
S0336	i don't we've we've kind of test have both cars on the drive with one car pretty much up to the house and it's not quite long enough
S0341	no
S0337	you have one
S0336	you've get a very long car which doesn't help but even so you don't want to be right up to the house
S0341	mm yeah
S0337	no
S0336	so i think what's more likely be that we're gonna have to
S0336	make it slightly wider
S0341	wider
S0336	but it's just
S0341	mm
S0336	i don't wanna go i don't wanna go crazy wide but obviously i don't wanna go so tight that we can't get in and out of the cars so it's just try we're gonna have to do some maths i think to try and work out
S0341	well what you would do be park one car forward face and the other car
S0336	yeah
S0341	reverse so you're both get out
S0337	i know we do well that's what we've do
S0336	yeah
S0337	we've my car go at the front and i drive over the bump off the drive onto the grass and then we inch forward to about so my car bonnet be on the last slab cos obviously there's two slabs
S0341	mm
S0337	so my car bonnet will go up to there so you can just walk past will reverse on we will literally be that close
S0341	mm
S0337	and will be on the drive if i drive up to that end patio slab there so i'm not actually on it so you can walk past quite easily
S0341	mm
S0337	and pull up really close she's just off the edge of the drive
S0341	mm
S0336	it's just it's just a little bite too short
S0337	slightly too
S0341	but but what i mean be when you go in widthwise
S0337	yeah oh sorry
S0341	if you extend it widthwise
S0337	yeah
S0341	and you wanna park next to each other
S0336	yeah
S0341	then one park forward face to the house
S0337	yeah
S0341	and the other one park forward face to the road
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0341	so you both drivers can get out
S0337	oh yeah doors yeah yeah yeah
S0336	yeah and whoever whoever get there first be gonna have to like drive on and go to the leave because obviously the bite down to the road it er it
S0337	it's a horrible angle
S0336	yeah i don't know but i i from i don't know if that's gonna happen before christmas
S0336	or not but
S0341	you probably wanna wait until they've actually give you er a proper
S0336	i don't think they'll do
S0337	that's gonna be a long time
S0341	to the drive
S0336	i don't think they'll do the roads until they've finish the site
S0337	no
S0336	which could be another like twelve to eighteen months
S0341	so if actually do extend it before then
S0337	yeah
S0341	they probably have to give you a double riser
S0336	yeah they might they might do
S0337	we could well we could see about do it ourselves
S0336	what just put tarmac down on the road
S0337	i don't know where i can get tarmac from
S0336	no i don't think you're allow to do that erm but yeah so we have to do some sum basically and cos i like have a lot of green out the front i think it's compare to cos everybody else basically on that estate if you have a drive round everybody else have just get drive out the front like nobody else get a garden really
S0341	mm
S0336	like even the ones even the ones to the right of us haven't really get a garden they've literally like obviously the ones next to us literally have that little bite that join onto us
S0341	mm
S0336	but nothing else there be a proper garden so i know we've get a proper luxury there by have a nice front garden i don't wanna then ruin it by put this huge driveway in so i'm really like undecided about it i know it would be handy to have the extra park space but i do like the green
S0337	er if we do go wider i still wanna out of that
S0336	yeah i know cos it look stupid
S0337	it's just pointless
S0336	but we'll see we'll see
S0337	we need to find out what how much this the stuff cost anyway cos the stuff that our drive's make out of apparently be ship in from ireland so it's like specially make stone
S0336	great
S0336	yeah but everything seem to be expensive like
S0337	er yeah everything seem to be
S0336	although say that i pop into porcelanosa to like check out how much it would cost just to have those bathroom tile and i be pleasantly surprise it be something like
S0337	twenty eight pound a box no twenty eight pound a metre
S0336	per square metre
S0337	per square metre
S0336	and i think we work out that we'd need two square metres and that's with like leave a lot of space for offcuts
S0336	and all that whatever you need to do so i'm think mm fifty quid sixty quid isn't really bad i know we add labour on top of that but can't really complain about that
S0341	thing be if you find if you find someone if you find a mate you know you can even ask if any of his mat be tile
S0336	yeah
S0337	we we get someone to do the tile at my er my mum and dad's tile round the fire tile in the porch
S0336	it's a weird one it doesn't really feel er
S0341	be you alright have that really
S0337	yeah
S0341	have it bother you
S0337	apparently so
S0336	i think everything bother
S0337	oh yeah but i have
S0341	be it painful or just bubbly
S0337	er a little bite of both it's slightly painful erm but the lunch i have this morning no today be the dinner we have from last night absolutely fine it's even meals even meals just bad
S0336	i don't even feel like that be a like it be fill but not substantial
S0341	no but er i just think i just think you're er you be not pass it through
S0337	no
S0341	effectively do if you see what i mean
S0341	cos if it's sit there and you're put more food on top
S0337	just sit and pile up yeah
S0336	yeah
S0341	it's it be just it's just sit there isn't it
S0341	wait for a gap to come
S0337	it's weird
S0336	yeah
S0341	mm
S0337	so i'm actually hungry cos it's not make it down
S0336	that's just dangerous isn't it that's what he say
S0341	mm
S0337	oh yeah
S0336	so erm the other day say oh where be you gonna put your christmas tree and i i be like well a it's august but b like i don't think we intend to spend christmas there do we not that we're not gonna put a christmas tree up cos that seem a bite like grinch like
S0341	yeah
S0336	but i be gonna assume that we be welcome at christmas
S0337	yeah
S0341	more than
S0337	i be gonna say er hopefully both both parent
S0341	i'm hopefully gonna have something in the bedroom by then
S0336	yeah that'd be good
S0337	so you can chuck in there
S0337	yeah need to work that out don't we
S0336	yeah

S0341	mm
S0336	we weren't gonna do much this weekend anyway but i do wanna see i i feel like properly leave out of the loop with my friends at the moment which i don't hugely mind it's not like i haven't be see other friends and whatnot but or just
S0341	yeah
S0336	i've always keep one i've always
S0336	keep one hand in and now at the moment i feel like i don't even have that
S0341	but i think er you be all get to that point aren't you er of of actually settle down somewhere and
S0337	i dunno some of them be some of them be really
S0341	do your own thing you you really don't want to still be in the circle of go out and
S0341	and at night do you
S0337	no er no some of some of them be really up for it still like when move into hers they all go to 's but they'd leave by nine o'clock so they could make it into town to go out
S0336	so they drive all the way to to go to 's housewarming party for like two hours and then drive back to to go out
S0337	cos we i be at hospital for my consultation and we get there about quarter past nine
S0336	and they'd already go
S0337	and they'd already leave to go out
S0341	that's bad
S0336	it's really bad
S0337	yeah
S0336	like that's that's the er that's the first and only time 's gonna have like
S0341	mm
S0336	her very first housewarming do you know what i mean and they weren't even there to like fully appreciate it
S0341	mm
S0336	so that's what like i'm really not that fuss about us have anything like that cos like
S0341	mm
S0336	they'd either blow it off or they'd come and then be like oh this be handy you're right in town
S0337	yeah
S0341	mm
S0336	so
S0337	and they go well no one not all of them but a lot of them go to ibiza as well
S0336	yeah they've all come back from ibiza
S0337	they're they're still
S0336	they're they're they're er they're there's a couple of them now that have get quite cliquey so like obviously 's live with and 's like best mat with and then like and bum as well so before you know it like those five be just inseparable at the moment
S0337	be do her own thing with
S0336	be very much do her own thing i think that's kind of why i miss some of the other girls because like even doesn't have any time for me at the moment like she's literally be to see us in the house once and it be just the most flyby visit ever
S0336	and i know she's really busy at work and stuff but like it's even at weekend and stuff she's not it's not like she's put any time aside to come and see us
S0341	mm
S0336	so i'm just er i slightly resent that cos i make quite a big deal about like her move into her house it's just not
S0337	we be there the day that she move in
S0336	yeah just not really felt the same kind of
S0341	yeah
S0337	love
S0337	ah it's really weird i think your your girlfriends be always like that though
S0336	yeah
S0337	like if you're if you're in at the time whatever it be like
S0336	you're in it in it
S0337	there's er there's a lot of action and you're in it
S0341	mm
S0337	but if you drop off a little bite then they they just carry on and
S0341	yeah
S0337	they forget
S0336	but like i think what's upset me recently be like if i wasn't make the effort with them i'd fully appreciate them kind of say oh well be she's not gonna make the effort i'm not go to but over the last couple of months it's always be me make the contact it's always be me be like hi how be you like can we catch up blah blah blah and er especially with people like
S0341	mm
S0336	who can't drive it's always you go to them so i've probably only see her a handful of time since christmas and every single time it's be me go to her
S0341	mm
S0336	like 's exactly the same i appreciate 's very busy like especially when obviously she's at school and stuff but like it's constantly me ring her or texting her
S0341	she's school holiday for the last six weeks though
S0336	i know but she's be so busy with the house stuff erm but this be what i mean like everybody's get their own stuff go on which be fine but when it's constantly you go oh can we meet up
S0341	mm
S0336	like 's blow me off the last two or three time we've make plan she's coincidentally like double book herself and stuff so like i'll literally be texting her the morning that we're mean to be see each other and she's like oh i'm sorry i've make plan and it's like don't do that like
S0341	mm
S0336	i've make the effort to come to you i haven't see you in age and now
S0341	yeah
S0336	you're blow me off to like go and see someone or something that you see all the time
S0341	mm
S0336	it's really annoy so that's what's kind of i think that's what's get on my nerve cos i just feel like it's constantly me and even it's kind of the same with the girls from uni like they all live in so it's very very easy to a certain extent for them to all meet up so i say to them a couple of weeks ago like oh erm er what what's it like for you guy in the even like if i come up for the even and can we all go out for dinner or something and like in my head i be think like that be a bite of a task for me but if it be on like a thursday or a friday i wouldn't mind do it they all organise to do it on a monday and i be like really be you take the mick like that's such a long day for me to like go to work then well actually get the train into work then get the train from to have dinner with you all then get a very presumably very late train home from
S0341	mm
S0336	to to then have to get up and basically
S0341	mm
S0336	carry on with the rest of the week
S0341	mm
S0336	like that's just such a big ask and i be like
S0341	mm
S0336	kind of miff that they organise it all without me even though it be me that kind of initiate it and then like texted me afterwards say like oh i think we're all gonna go to like maybe like do you fancy it and i'm like yeah i fancy it like i don't wanna feel completely like i'm not
S0341	mm
S0336	and then i then i feel bad cos i'm not make the effort to go down to but it's so much easier for them to get across than it be for me to get down there and then back like from down there and then all the way back home
S0341	mm yeah
S0336	and it's like they all know i've just move into a house and not a single one of them's make the effort none like none of them have ring me to be like oh so how's it go none of them have say oh can we come and visit
S0341	mm
S0336	so it's just like
S0341	mm
S0336	i don't wanna be needy i don't wanna be the one go oh when be you gonna come and see me
S0341	mm
S0336	and i then don't also wanna make it feel like they're constantly come to me but it's not like they're constantly come to me
S0341	mm
S0336	and er i almost feel like me make one journey to be the same as them make one journey down to like regardless of how many people be there like
S0341	mm
S0336	do i have to go five time to for every one time they come here because
S0341	mm
S0336	there's five of them in
S0341	mm
S0336	and just try to coordinate cos like a couple of them seem to like only wanna do stuff when there's a big group of us and it's like it's so hard to coordinate six people who have very separate very busy live like
S0341	mm
S0336	it'd be fairly easy me for me to probably text and be like oh i don't suppose you're around this weekend i've get nothing to do i i might come down to for the day do you wanna do lunch or something
S0341	yeah
S0336	it's fairly easy for me to text her and she'll say yes or no but if i text all of them it's like some people'll be like yes some people'll say no of those that say yes some people'll be free in the morning some people'll be free in the afternoon and before you know it you're run round headless try to accommodate everybody else when actually you're the one make the effort to go down there so everybody should be accommodate you
S0341	mm
S0336	so it's a tough one i have a really nice time when i go down in april but it's not cheap like
S0341	mm
S0336	cost me twenty quid on the train for starters and then if we eat out and we have like i think last time we i have the train to pay for we didn't really do much in the day but we have breakfast at which be like fifteen quid and then we walk around all afternoon which be cool and then we go and have a couple of bottle of wine
S0341	mm
S0336	but like even a couple of bottle of wine between us be another fifteen twenty quid
S0341	mm
S0336	and then we have dinner on top of that i think i spend one day in it cost me seventy quid like
S0341	mm
S0336	that's a huge commitment when i don't have a lot of like disposable income
S0341	yeah
S0336	i can't do that very often
S0341	mm
S0336	and they just don't seem to appreciate that and actually it's quite a big undertake to say ah well of my weekend i'm gonna spend the whole day on saturday go to and walk round et cetera cos then before you know it the weekend's over and you're absolutely knackered cos you've run around like a headless chicken
S0341	yeah yeah
S0336	so i don't know i'm feel a bite like
S0341	yeah
S0336	a bite leave out of stuff at the moment and a bite a bite disappoint cos i think it's one of those things like buy a house feel like the biggest thing in your life like you know it be one of the biggest things you'll ever do
S0341	it be big a big step yeah
S0336	and it's it fairly disappoint when your friends don't appreciate how big that be
S0341	yeah
S0336	but oh well
S0341	yeah it's just everybody's gonna be at different stag in their
S0336	yeah
S0341	lifetime
S0336	it's it be weird talk to my friends from because they've just get a completely different perspective on things like
S0341	yeah
S0336	for them their number one priority be their job like
S0341	mm
S0336	that's what they're pour their heart and soul into be their job and they're work all the hours under the sun and they're make huge sacrifice to be able to do whatever it be that they're do and they're love it and that's great that's that's fab but they're sacrifice a hell of a lot to do it they're they're not they don't have a lot of personal time they certainly don't get a lot of time to do a lot of stuff in the even they're pay a lot for the lifestyle to live in et cetera
S0341	mm
S0336	and i don't have a lot in common with that cos i really enjoy my job
S0341	mm
S0336	i'm very happy where i be but it's still a mean to an end for me like
S0341	mm
S0336	i go to work so that i can afford to do the other things that i like to do
S0341	yeah
S0336	in my life
S0341	mm
S0336	and er it be it's and it's the house and it's
S0341	mm
S0336	whatever else that actually
S0341	mm
S0336	make me happy so for me it's weird to think of a life that literally revolve around work
S0341	mm
S0336	and for them the concept of own a house be so kind of out of their reach in the
S0341	mm
S0336	short term because house price there be so ridiculous it's not even on their radar
S0341	yeah
S0336	so i think to a certain extent a lot of them be quite freak out by the fact that i've make such a commitment so young
S0341	mm
S0336	because it's just not something that they've even consider
S0341	they can do mm
S0336	yeah so i don't i don't know if there's maybe a pang of even jealousy there
S0341	mm
S0336	cos i know a couple of them make comment about the fact you know they're they're not gonna be own a house anytime soon and i'm like well it be one of the it's another sacrifice that you make to work in
S0341	and everybody everybody really you know you just have your own goals don't you and you do reach a point in life and career and whatever that you're gonna go this way or that way and it it usually be job or
S0336	job or like home life effectively yeah
S0341	family centre
S0336	i just don't i at the moment be struggle to see a job that i could love so much that i would be prepare to like put it first
S0341	yeah
S0336	cos i just get so much more satisfaction from my relationships from my friends
S0341	mm
S0336	from my family i get i get i er i get so much more from that than
S0341	mm
S0336	from go to work but
S0341	yeah
S0336	so i i think i find it hard to communicate with them on that level as well cos we have get very different lifestyles
S0341	mm
S0337	hello
S0336	hello
S0341	alright
S0337	mm
S0341	do you need another drink
S0337	good thank

S0341	mm
S0336	so dangerous this woman like it didn't really say much about the woman
S0337	no
S0336	so i don't know if she be elderly or what but
S0337	it be really obscure wasn't it
S0336	it be just like oh yeah er like the only quote i think they have from her be like the the the this room be just unused and it hadn't be hadn't be go into but i'm like who doesn't go into a room in their house for three months
S0337	who wouldn't hear a wasps' nest that big
S0336	i know
S0341	yes er how do they come and go
S0337	oh be it the window have be leave ajar
S0336	oh yeah one of like
S0336	a small window have be leave slightly open
S0337	but that's all they need
S0336	yeah
S0341	well it be all they need and it just
S0337	yeah
S0341	that's that's how they actually get into the loft space isn't it
S0337	loft yeah
S0336	yeah
S0341	they er they kind of get er under the eaves and erm
S0337	find a tiny hole
S0341	can usually
S0336	but it literally make my scrin my scrin craw my i can't talk my skin crawl
S0341	yeah
S0336	that's just horrible
S0341	yes
S0336	so yeah don't don't don't don't check your spare room
S0341	no well no
S0337	d d d d d
S0336	d d d don't don't not check
S0337	d d d
S0341	actually an empty spare room we know there's no wasps in there
S0337	yeah
S0336	i don't know if i like my room be call a spare room
S0341	it take a bite of clean around the windows
S0337	oh yeah
S0336	oh yeah it be pretty gross
S0337	someone open their jewellery bag onto our bed and it be filthy cover full of like
S0336	you know those little like black bug that be around
S0337	thunder mites
S0341	mm
S0336	thunder bug type things
S0337	thunder yeah thunder
S0336	so i literally tip like my bag of jewellery out onto the bed and there be just these black bug everywhere i be like oh that's so gross
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0341	mm
S0337	be it just clean a clean empty room now
S0336	have you paint it yet
S0341	no er try get the stuff ready so erm just wait for to get some enthusiasm
S0336	mm
S0341	he's he be too tire last weekend he wasn't even get up before two o'clock
S0336	how do he do that
S0341	i just don't know he say to me on friday wake me up when you get up tomorrow and i'll make a start on it so i do and then every hour after that
S0341	and eventually get up at two o'clock he say oh i might do it tomorrow the weather's gonna be bad tomorrow so then sunday i wake him up at eleven think that be a reasonable time and i think i leave at one o'clock to go and meet and er he be just get up
S0337	absolute lad and then he be up all night
S0341	he probably be up during the night to watch er movies or stuff
S0337	well i use to do that so i can't say anything
S0336	yeah we're on slightly
S0336	different pattern at the moment like
S0341	mm
S0336	er when i get up early my alarm's go off at like six and i'm out of the house for seven so by the time ten o'clock come round i'm really flag like really tire but obviously doesn't get up till about like half past seven eight o'clock maybe
S0337	quarter to eight
S0336	yeah
S0337	quarter to eight
S0336	so
S0341	mm
S0336	when i'm try to get him to come to bed at like half past ten he's not tire in the slightest
S0341	mm
S0337	i get tire at eleven but you're already fast asleep
S0341	yeah
S0337	but
S0336	but like last night i be up yesterday morning six half past six whatever have a really long day then i have round all even and i still manage to stay up till about
S0341	mm
S0336	half past eleven but
S0341	mm
S0336	that mean i couldn't get up i wouldn't have be able to get up this morning at six
S0341	mm mm
S0336	it's hard hard try to find the balance
S0341	yeah
S0337	yeah er
S0341	i can imagine
S0337	it's also weird for me to be wake up at six
S0341	mm
S0337	and actively wake up cos obviously en suite and hairdryer if you clean your hair and just general walk around so i'm not quite back to sleep then i fall back to sleep
S0341	mm
S0337	and then i get wake up by my alarm
S0341	mm
S0337	so we need to find an in between today be nice today be so much better for me
S0336	he like have me there in the morning which be fine and
S0337	yeah
S0336	in all fairness like i leave at nine o'clock this morning and i be in for quarter to ten
S0341	mm
S0336	and i leave at half past five and manage to avoid i think some fairly long traffic but i still be home for half past six
S0341	mm
S0336	which isn't the worst thing in the world
S0341	no
S0336	like that's not too late especially if he could get home and start make dinner
S0337	and er i as you say i be already home and i i could've start cook
S0336	yeah
S0341	yeah
S0336	i imagine
S0341	school will start back next week
S0337	yeah
S0336	i imagine go forward i might have to adopt a late start because the early start get on the road at seven i do still hit congestion and so it's not a very nice drive and you'd think leave at half past three it would it would always be a cruise home but it's not always a cruise home even at half past three so it's like it's
S0337	you've leave a few time recently
S0336	yeah
S0341	mm
S0337	and be in in a bad place
S0336	yeah
S0341	yeah
S0336	so it's like there aren't there aren't that many perk to go in early other than i like the way my day form so like if i start work at eight
S0341	yeah
S0336	and don't have lunch till one i've do the biggest part of my day before i've even have lunch
S0341	mm
S0336	so after lunch i've only get a couple of hours leave to work
S0341	mm
S0336	which be much nicer than have like the biggest part of the day after lunch that be say like i think as as winter draw in i think i will find it harder and harder to get up early when it's like cold and not very nice and it's not very nice wake up on your own
S0341	yeah
S0336	when he's still in bed and stuff so i imagine move forward i probably will work lates cos
S0341	mm
S0336	it's one of those things as well like obviously as the nights draw in you're do less and less in the even anyway so there's no real need for me to rush home
S0341	mm no
S0336	cos that's what i find er
S0341	and also the weather earlier in the morning the roads aren't
S0336	it's dangerous
S0341	quite as er
S0336	yeah
S0341	de ice and whatever
S0336	i just
S0336	i just think i get home
S0341	mm
S0336	like even like yesterday it didn't make much of a difference cos i have come over but i can be home for like quarter past half past four but to what end like i'm still sit round wait for an hour until he get back to like
S0337	at least yeah
S0336	er to at least
S0341	mm
S0336	to start think about dinner or whatever
S0337	so i don't get don't get in till about six
S0336	yeah
S0337	quarter past six
S0336	so my day isn't er like you know like er
S0341	mm
S0336	if i be get up that time and have lunch early et cetera et cetera i should be eat early
S0341	yeah
S0336	but i can't eat early because i'm still kind of have to wait for him so work
S0337	and i can't get off or on
S0336	no
S0341	mm
S0336	you will like minimum
S0337	for at least half a hour just
S0336	yeah you'd be lucky to get home for half past five
S0337	the the 's kill us yeah
S0336	so
S0341	mm
S0336	earlies doesn't have that many advantage to be honest so i think
S0341	yeah
S0337	i think when the 's complete slightly or at least that that
S0336	slip road
S0337	slip road get onto it
S0336	yeah
S0341	mm
S0337	because you can't get off the estate for twenty twenty five minutes
S0341	mm
S0337	if you leave bang on five by the time you've get to your car
S0341	yeah
S0337	they're queue up the road past
S0341	mm
S0337	past where you use to work
S0336	yeah
S0337	and they're queue right round mine until er until to my front door
S0341	yeah yeah so er
S0341	it's not a nice er situation be it
S0337	mm
S0336	no i'll er i'll have to find something like this this week i have be do earlies and it it do help to get into a routine i e go in at the same time every day
S0337	mm
S0336	erm
S0337	you choose the routine on a monday
S0341	yeah
S0337	you should stick with it for the rest of the week
S0341	mm
S0336	yeah
S0337	and then you can just choose it again
S0336	it's er it's actually easier to start off the week earlies and then if i get tire towards the end of the week switch to lates it's easier to do that because effectively like last night for example i get in at half past four i didn't go er i didn't leave the house till nine so you get like a nice rest it's easier to do that than to do lates and then
S0341	mm
S0336	try and switch onto earlies because
S0341	yeah
S0336	you're get home at like half past six and then you're leave
S0337	you don't switch
S0336	at half past six
S0341	mm
S0336	so it's like i'm literally in the house for twelve hours which be just a bite depress
S0341	mm
S0336	so yeah you have to find have to find the balance
S0341	mm
S0336	it at the moment at the moment earlies be okay they serve a purpose because like i've have to be home for stuff if if i'm host if i'm expect people to come over i'd much prefer to be home when so they can come over as soon as they've
S0341	mm
S0336	finish work than expect them to hang around town till like
S0341	yeah
S0336	half past six or whatever erm
S0337	but you don't wanna be lonely do you
S0336	no and i don't like the mornings be tough like
S0341	mm
S0336	and i'd i don't really look after myself as much in the mornings i'll literally like maybe get up at half past six and try and be out of the house for like ten to seven seven o'clock
S0341	mm
S0336	so all i literally do be splash my face and get dress and head out so i'm not even like wake myself up properly before i go i'm not have breakfast until i get to work
S0341	mm
S0336	so it's like actually this morning be so lovely cos i actually take my time get up i have a proper a nice long shower
S0341	mm
S0336	wash my hair and everything get dress
S0337	sit down
S0336	sit down and have breakfast with then when go i go and dry my hair
S0341	mm
S0336	and head off and i have like a proper like i guess hour and a half
S0341	mm
S0336	of like just get ready and take my time and eat my breakfast
S0341	mm
S0336	and just wake up
S0341	mm
S0336	so by the time i be in the car i be like i be ready to start my day properly
S0341	yes yeah
S0336	and actually today be really nice i i force well i think this be what i'm gonna have to do i force myself to wait until half past one for my lunch so i do three and a half hours half an hour lunch three and a half hours which feel nice like
S0341	mm
S0336	that i can do
S0341	yeah
S0336	what i've find be sometimes when i do lates i somehow like i struggle to get go a little bite because like
S0341	mm
S0336	everybody's already in their full flow when i get into work and i feel like i'm a bite behind
S0341	yeah
S0336	and then because it's ten o'clock already you almost feel like you get into this false state of say to yourself oh well er it's only a few hours until lunch so what i find myself do be be a bite bore and then go on an early lunch at say like twelve half twelve when i really didn't need to
S0341	mm mm
S0336	and so i'd come back and i'd have like four and a half hours leave to work and you're just like that's actually a bite
S0341	mm
S0336	depress like that's a long time to still be work
S0341	yeah
S0336	i don't know er i'll find er
S0341	oh goodness
S0336	i'll find a rhythm with it at some point i think i've i've well i've talk to about it a bite recently but i think i've struggle this year cos of like the switchover of my job and like because i have to use a lot of holiday earlier in the year for like interview and stuff like that i've really lose out this year on holiday
S0341	mm
S0336	so i'm knackered just from the fact that i've not really have
S0341	yes
S0336	any like it's the whole house move thing you know if i have proper holiday to use
S0341	mm
S0336	i'd've take the time off when we move and i'd've actually like spend a few days just get the house the way i want it but instead i have a weekend where we be try to do everything rush
S0341	mm
S0336	then go back to work and then every weekend since it's be try to do odd job because
S0341	mm
S0336	i don't have the time to do it in the week
S0341	mm
S0336	and like 's get like ten days or something leave to use before christmas
S0341	mm
S0336	and i just think
S0336	yeah i just think
S0341	mm
S0336	oh it's like like i'm gonna have to deal with the fact that he's get those days that i haven't get
S0341	mm
S0336	so there's gonna be at least a week and a half when i've like get to go to work and he doesn't which be just and i'm knackered
S0341	yeah mm
S0336	erm never mind
S0341	and when do your leave year start
S0336	january to january so it's fine like and er the thing be what's kind of skew it be because i've almost join like the wrong half of the year like because i have to save four for christmas
S0341	mm
S0336	i get er basically half a year's like holiday allowance
S0341	mm
S0337	but four of it four days
S0336	but four of it have to be allocate to christmas so
S0341	mm
S0336	immediately i have like less anyway and then it just so happen that we'd already book that week as holiday basically a couple of weeks into me start
S0341	mm
S0336	so that be a massive chunk straightaway go
S0341	yeah yeah
S0336	so it's just
S0341	let's go and have a seat in there for a while
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah
