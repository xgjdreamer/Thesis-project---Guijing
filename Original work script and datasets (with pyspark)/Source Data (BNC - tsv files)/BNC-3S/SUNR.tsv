S0041	yeah oh ah it it's so frustrate cos you're pay these people
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	that's the worst thing you're pay them

S0084	er well yes i erm i would have put photos on but there's not point take photos if the phone's go so erm
S0041	ah
S0084	i haven't put any photos on i've put music on
S0041	how do you just put that on then
S0084	erm i put those on with bluetooth but these one's i've download it that tell me how to do it but erm i didn't know it
S0041	ah do you pay for them
S0084	no it's a little bite illegal shh
S0041	that's brilliant where do you download them from
S0084	erm a website call tubidy t u b i d y i think it might be a little bite illegal
S0041	so do you have to type all the name of stuff in
S0084	i just put in the name of a song or the name of of a group
S0041	oh
S0084	erm cos this one i really want to listen to cos it's on this be england oh no that's not the one where be it where's the one that say
S0041	i haven't see that i need to catch up on that
S0084	it's good actually i really like it like it's quite dark
S0041	mm
S0084	it's quite good i quite like it
S0084	yeah you just go onto the website and then type in a song that you wanna listen to and then you can and then it give you the option to like watch the videos it's a bite like you tube where you can just download the mp3 file and then it download it onto your phone
S0041	oh
S0084	but what i want to do be make an album in there and just move them out so that it doesn't say download but you can't create an album i don't think so i be create play list and if you delete it out of the download folder it just delete the whole song so i guess what you could do be put it on your computer so i've get bluetooth on this and i just bluetooth it to my mac take all the songs off create an album on my mac and then bluetooth it back on
S0041	put it on in the right place
S0084	so it doesn't know you've download it
S0041	ah mm
S0084	i know it's pretty clever man i mean i do like the phone that's the thing i just it's so it it be really intuitive

S0084	which be fine and it be a perfectly valid dietary requirement
S0041	tea yeah
S0084	someone ask me when i be say yeah no i'm just live on fish finger sandwich and they be like ha ha ha ha and i be like you all know cos our team be renowned for bake and cook everyone in the team do apart from me and will go home and like eat curry out of a tin
S0041	yep
S0084	on a good day on a bad day she'll just go straight to bed cos she's get er she say she's get the metabolism of an anaconda so she might have one meal during the day and then not eat for another like twenty four hours cos she's not hungry which i don't understand cos i'm always ravenous and so and also there's a quite an element of laziness cos her husband work long hours he might be work away cos he work for himself quite it's quite common for her to be on her own erm so she can't cook whereas i certainly can't be bother to cook
S0041	right
S0084	but everyone else either because they've get kid or what ever but they'll have bake and cook so they tell me i be let the side down

S0084	you alright go out
S0046	nope i'm go to the shop
S0041	we be too we could give you a lift we have no list so there's no point

S0046	erm you know the thing i tell you about
S0041	yeah
S0046	it's no more last night at three o'clock in the morning go
S0041	shit
S0046	mm mm mm and she's deal with it in her own way and it's annoy me
S0041	oh dear so she's just not talk
S0046	no she's talk she's act like nothing's up when i know clearly that there be and i'm worry to hell about her and she's not let me in
S0041	mm
S0046	so it's be
S0041	yeah i can understand why she wouldn't
S0046	mm it's a situation that i've never deal with before so it's completely and utterly new to me
S0041	yeah no even if you be like her husband a boyfriend of two years
S0046	mm
S0041	i i would still expect that reaction from her
S0046	mm yeah you see that i'm think obviously more towards those line now
S0041	yeah really i would just leave her to it
S0046	yep
S0041	as long as she know you're at the end of the phone that's all just leave her to it
S0046	yeah no she do know that but it she's not show any kind of remorse to me
S0041	no she's probably be numb for a couple of days yet
S0046	yeah see i didn't didn't expect any of it and didn't know don't know how to deal with it so i don't know what to expect if it make any sense
S0041	yeah
S0046	it's really really weird she be pregnant
S0084	god
S0046	yeah but
S0041	er yeah i'd just leave her to it
S0046	yeah
S0041	the worst thing you could do
S0084	she'll talk to you when she's ready
S0046	mm
S0041	yeah the worst thing you could do be to try and chase chase information out of her
S0046	yeah
S0041	but when she come to you just listen to her and don't don't forget about it cos i think boys have a tendency to when something like that happen to move on much quickly than she'll move on about it
S0046	mm
S0041	and so maybe a few months down the line
S0046	mm
S0041	it might upset her and she'll be really angry that you don't understand that she could still be hurt by it
S0046	mm
S0041	like she'll keep it forever and ever and ever
S0046	mm mm
S0041	just er yeah sit sit tight sit on your hand so that you don't harass her on the phone
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0046	i wasn't gonna go to the shop but i'm go to the shop now the bath make me wanna go to the shop
S0041	the bath have you be in the bath
S0046	i have be in the bath i have but i'm not buy twenty can

S0046	no i'm gonna buy a four pack and that's it that's my lot
S0041	probably better than you know
S0046	yeah
S0041	trip on your own vomit in your sleep
S0046	my weekend's just go to pot to be quite honest
S0041	mm
S0046	it really have the only thing that's still go ahead be tomorrow night and that could still potentially go to pot
S0041	be she stay in
S0046	well that's if she stay in you know she's er she's kind she kind of feel obligate to go out
S0041	i'd tell her to stay at home if it be me
S0084	mm
S0046	but if i tell her to stay at home she's gonna think well why do he want me to stay at home so i'm just gonna make her make
S0041	no she'll if what she's say be true if she's be honest with you about this actually happen and i know that's an awful thing to say but i've know some crazy girls that have say they're pregnant when they weren't actually pregnant in the first place
S0046	mm well yeah i know so have i
S0041	but hypothetically if this be true there be no way she want to go out tomorrow none i promise you
S0046	yeah
S0041	and any get out of jail free card she's gonna take it like full there's no way she's gonna wanna see anybody none
S0046	mm hmm mm yep right yeah cool i need a
S0041	have fun
S0046	i'll probably see you in a minute anyway
S0041	okay what do i need for tea
S0084	um a cow on a stick
S0041	a cow on a stick a burger vegas he go anyway she be like the whole time she must have be
S0084	mm i'm sorry if you've only be together a month a it be ridiculous even say she'd be pregnant with him at the time
S0041	yep yep yep yep
S0084	all that's happen be she's have her period so it's not that it's it's just impossible to have anything
S0041	no she she be on her period we be wait for her period to have finish for a good amount of time so that this saturday could take the second doctor styley this be the decider test this week so she only be on on her period last week
S0084	but then how can you be pregnant
S0041	she yeah she
S0084	she's a miracle she be actually you know
S0041	i think the way she's describe it to him she be on her period last week she think she be basically off it and so could take a test which come ninety percent positive but she say that could still show positive because of hormones in your body when you're on your period and i've only just come off mine so we'll wait a little bite longer to take a a proper stance with this doctor styley it be complete bollocks
S0084	what it er i mean i've hear about there be spot you know in the early days of pregnancy which be why some women don't realise they're pregnant for months
S0041	mm
S0084	but actually have a period when you think that you're pregnant be completely ridiculous there be absolutely no way you can be pregnant if you're have a period surely everything's get flush out
S0041	well she's yeah she's say that the her last period be two weeks ago but when she do the test last week she be scar that the read wasn't really truthful because she'd only just come off her period
S0084	nope that's bollocks absolutely bollocks
S0041	yeah
S0084	there's just no way that you can be pregnant in that amount of time he's a fuck moron clearly for believe her
S0084	she's a fuck weirdo
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's just like
S0041	yeah how could ya how could ya
S0084	you can't and it's in that amount of time there's no way absolutely no way all that's happen be she's now not only have she be lie about the baby because there's no possible way there could be a baby
S0041	no how could you possibly
S0084	there's absolutely physically no way go and speak to a fuck gp
S0041	yeah
S0084	and there's no way you could possibly be pregnant in that in that amount of time all that's happen be she's have another period
S0041	i sound bad but i wanna say to him how do the how could you explain to me how she's explain this to you cos i don't really get the chronological order of this
S0084	no right well there isn't she's just basically off
S0041	like she's take the piss out of him bad
S0084	yeah and then and now the worst thing of all to say i've lose the baby
S0041	to throw that on him
S0084	there's but there be no fuck baby she's have her period
S0041	no
S0084	and to see him i mean obviously he's fuck mental but he's actually upset about the whole thing because he think she be
S0041	i know yeah
S0084	what's happen be she's probably a bite upset that she's not pregnant
S0041	yeah she be just never pregnant
S0084	she's not lose anything
S0041	yeah
S0084	she's compare herself to the trauma of some other woman have to lose a child
S0041	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	which you can't even imagine how bad that must be
S0041	no
S0084	i think she's disgust she's play him for a fool for a start
S0041	isn't she
S0084	cos she's she's probably mental
S0041	that's why i want to sit down i want to say to him okay can you explain this to me cos i can't understand the order of it and play on
S0084	mm
S0041	for him to see it cos that's that's i can not imagine anybody what type of person would use that
S0084	mm mm mm i don't understand how you get either she's mental as well and she really cos she want a baby so much she's convince herself well in two weeks i must be pregnant
S0041	she must be mental yeah yep
S0084	why because i don't think they're have much sex
S0041	no
S0084	i think they've only have sex about once since the second or third break up whatever it be whatever they're on now on this one month they've be together
S0041	yeah whatever god know
S0084	well it's value but then the last one that he have kick around that say she be pregnant although that's what he tell us i don't whether he's mental
S0041	mm mm
S0084	or he make stuff up i don't know
S0041	yeah
S0084	what the fuck i mean but he like the drama that's why i think he could be a little bite upset because he care about her but he always a screw loose with him
S0041	yeah i think so
S0084	for him to have say he's fall deeply in love with her in a matter of moments
S0041	mm
S0084	and believe this shit though
S0041	it's the it's not just the believe it's the way he deliver the information
S0084	mm
S0041	like so we're both sit here and he say you know the thing i tell you
S0084	so for like ten minutes i'm like well i know what you're talk about
S0041	yeah
S0084	i'll pretend that i'm not but it's rude
S0041	and i'm think yeah do you know what i mean you would never say that
S0084	mm
S0041	one it's rude cos there's someone else here two you've already be privy to this information anyway
S0084	yeah
S0041	do you know what i mean it's just that that drip feed of build up the suspense like it's a play like it's not
S0084	yeah yeah mm mm
S0041	if you be really emotionally invest in it
S0084	mm
S0041	you would if he be really really truly emotionally invest in this he would have come and say i'm actually really gutted you know how you i suppose you both have get the the kind of end of the stick now that you know we think she be pregnant
S0084	mm
S0041	and you know she's lose the baby
S0041	you would you would be so
S0084	if you actually be gutted yeah
S0041	yeah yeah you wouldn't drip fee information for the attention
S0084	that's really weird
S0041	do you know what i mean just the
S0084	mm
S0041	the whole thing's very strange
S0084	he like the drama i think that's what it be he's probably addict to it yeah and she's get a fuck screw loose
S0041	she's nut
S0084	i mean it obviously she's compensate for some horrible grizzly incidence that's happen in her past fine i understand i don't think you know bring children into the world be the answer by any mean
S0041	no
S0084	and that's massively selfish you need to deal with your shit and then move on don't bring more children into an unstable environment
S0041	yeah
S0084	erm particularly when you're clearly mental so she
S0041	in her so in her little world apparently in the past two and half weeks she's find out she's pregnant
S0084	mm
S0041	just just after she's have her period just after
S0084	yeah yeah ridiculous
S0041	how
S0084	in two weeks how would you know
S0041	how
S0084	how would you know because it at which i mean i'm not i'm a bite vague on the specifics myself but it just you can't know that quickly you can't know
S0041	no you can't i know all the specifics basically if you've just if that's if you've just come off your period any little even accidental eggage and stuff it wouldn't survive
S0084	mm
S0041	there's nothing for it to cling onto
S0084	it wouldn't stick yeah
S0041	it's not possible it's not possible i don't believe it no way
S0084	it's very strange for you to be that sure you know she for you to tell the the boy that you're with i think i'm pregnant
S0041	yeah
S0084	because basically because she want to be
S0041	yeah
S0084	and now she's build up this little little fantasy oh well i've lose the baby what the fuck no you've just have a period i think it be all bollocks i think she's fuck mental and he's just as mad for believe her because he want to be
S0041	and i want to ask him
S0084	well er i mean i could ask him because it's all new to me i don't know any of this do i in in theory
S0041	yes yes yes we should do this cos then he'll be so into the drama of it dig for more info he's never gonna
S0084	mm mm well especially if he's gonna drink and this whole oh i can't tell her that i've be drink it fuck me off because it make me really angry cos i think don't be with someone like that don't don't lie
S0041	yeah and do you know what i don't understand the whole premise of be with somebody be essential like be that be what's gonna make me happy be with someone even if i lie through my back teeth about ever part of me to them
S0084	mm mm
S0041	i'm happier with them
S0084	mm
S0041	live the lie than i be just be me
S0084	that's wrong isn't it
S0041	where's the sense in that
S0084	well there's none there's none there's no sense in anything that those two do i mean clearly he's lose it he's lose the plot
S0041	yeah true story
S0084	true fact we haven't get very far with this plan for dinner and i'm fuck starve
S0041	ah ha ha
S0084	and that seem to have die he must just sort of pass on
