S0013	if any old music you
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	there be er
S0013	that's true
S0278	but if you
S0012	i mean
S0278	can't do it in a in a public place can you you see it's where you do it
S0012	well there be case
S0013	if it's for your own use
S0012	a case about this er like like
S0013	oh
S0012	down the road there that weren't him that be another garage
S0278	uhu
S0012	right and they have radio one or two on or three or four or whatever it be and they be fin for play music in public
S0013	yes
S0278	mm
S0013	strange isn't it
S0012	which be
S0013	that one's strange
S0278	mm
S0012	which be you know natural
S0013	i think
S0278	mm
S0012	people listen to when when i be in the printers we just have the radio on all the
S0278	yeah go all the time
S0012	and
S0278	what about music while you work
S0012	yeah yeah that's what it be
S0013	but aren't they disband that stupid
S0012	i think they
S0013	erm i think they
S0012	must have do yeah
S0013	cos
S0012	cos they do they do
S0013	how do they
S0278	but you can see why you you'd protect somebody's work
S0012	yeah
S0278	and that's what they're do so you can't mass produce it and or put your name on it
S0012	oh yeah
S0278	and change it a little bite you're not allow to do that even
S0012	no
S0278	er
S0012	no they call it
S0278	but when it come
S0012	plagiarism now
S0278	yeah but isn't it daft you know that some drummer do some rhythm years ago you that's be on the news recently
S0012	yes
S0278	and and he's now have a go at other group that use that rhythm well when you're thump a drum you can thump whatever rhythm you like
S0012	of course you can yeah
S0278	how can you
S0013	mm
S0278	put a copyright on a certain riff or whatever
S0012	yeah
S0278	they call it
S0012	a riff that's what they call it
S0278	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	well why can you but cos anybody can bang a drum like that
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	they don't need to have hear yours to have do it
S0012	no
S0278	you can come up with your own one
S0012	yeah
S0278	no it's it's weird
S0013	mm
S0278	isn't it
S0012	yeah that call a riff it's
S0278	and again you see there be only certain ways you can put music together there's a limit to how you can string the note together

S0278	mm
S0012	i think i think er when you think about music
S0278	mm

S0278	so they that's that's happen in about a month's time that's the next thing
S0013	yeah
S0278	and you see another idea come with erm the rhythmic bell ring thing that where you can convert the the bar the the the chord name
S0012	yeah
S0278	into for ring it's ever so easy we just walk in and do it and say now i've put in front of you we've get some music here's some something funny he say we've get funny letter up above each each bar he say yes that's what i want you to play in each bar so if you're stand in front of those two any of those bell
S0012	yeah
S0278	ring it when it say if you cos if it say a ring you've get a a you ring it and we go through ring it at the start of the bar then do it two in a bar and then dum da da dum dum da da dum and whatever rhythm you want to do but you keep to your guitar chord type of thing go through
S0012	yeah
S0278	then you get to now the they really test you erm turn your piece of paper over there's a hymn
S0012	oh
S0278	you see and i want you to sing as well

S0013	yeah
S0278	and we manage it and it be lovely and then erm at the service this morning we be all there wait and it be cold and the heat wasn't on and there in this little hut and then these bell come from a distance and they come in from outside do this rhythmic play
S0012	yeah
S0278	and then then the ones at the back start add in the tune but they be start really quiet and it get louder and louder then they start sing with it till they get to the place and then we that roll into a hymn that we be do
S0012	wow
S0278	it be a fabulous start
S0013	mm
S0278	erm and then they play another piece at the end as well and that be that's what they'd do the day before
S0012	yeah
S0278	they'd have one and a half hours on church music
S0012	wow
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's a brilliant brilliant two days i wish i i would have like that one

S0012	mm
S0013	these four things but erm you there be choice of about eight or nine things for each
S0012	yeah
S0278	one and a half hours and you you categorise those one to seven of
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0278	your order of preference
S0012	yeah
S0278	i didn't get any of my ones
S0278	i want to do a beginners two in hand
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah

S0013	mm
S0278	he's a super bloke be our
S0012	yeah brilliant
S0013	oh yeah
S0278	but they they be they they i'd get it's get to be a bell thing because to ring bell you've gotta be frightfully organise really to get the stuff there and make it work and pack pack them
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and do it she say oh i i think she discuss this she discuss a lot of what we do
S0012	do they have to be tune up every now and then
S0278	no you you can't polish them
S0012	no that's right yeah
S0278	that's why we wear the gloves
S0012	yeah
S0278	because if you start polish them you change the tune if you
S0012	yeah
S0278	if you if you ware it away at all
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh right
S0278	if some of the bell set be horrid because cos they've they get old bell mix in with new bell and they don't ring the same
S0012	no they wouldn't ring the same
S0278	ours be all ours be all one be a complete set from whitechapel
S0012	yeah
S0278	years ago and some of them have get new handle on but the bell be so they all make the same
S0013	right
S0278	the same nice deep round sound
S0012	yeah
S0278	but the more modern ones sort of
S0013	oh
S0012	they're quite tinny
S0278	they're tinny yeah they're tinny
S0012	yeah
S0278	and if you've get some of the bell when they're ring it's like oh that's not good it's cos some of them weren't if an a lower a be not the same as a higher a you know
S0012	no
S0278	because they be two set of bell that they've
S0012	yeah
S0278	they've they've put together and be not quite the same but it
S0012	mm
S0278	but it it be fascinate it be i really enjoy that
S0013	yeah
S0012	no that's good
S0278	something totally different
S0013	mm
S0278	i have my doubt a few years ago what oh i know i didn't finish what i be say you know i be say about how you can
S0012	mm
S0278	i be go into about church and you can write these chord out who play with us she say well i've get a a a really good children's set of bell not cheap ones up in my loft and they haven't be use for age you can have them to use for the church

S0278	you know so just just on a permanent loan
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm
S0013	oh
S0278	and then that's where i be go to link from the youth team the youth they they'd love to do that cos it's so easy cos you're just play chord in time

S0013	yeah
S0278	they keep see it but they didn't know where it be go and it wouldn't come back
S0278	and be feed by the people over there so so they this be roughly what happen so they they find out because i think they go to a local vet or something and say look be it be it chip we need to know where why it keep come to us

S0278	she doesn't know where they go they disappear
S0013	yeah
S0012	and erm and if you can find them good luck to you and then you get them to do it but i can't find them and then the other and the other the same week she be in the other the outer bite where that that's more relax but you get give so many room to look after
S0012	yeah
S0278	and the people erm and actually it's no that same thing that oh i'm get mix up between two things that that actually happen and she's and she tell them erm no no the other whoever be with her they weren't pull their weight you see
S0012	yeah
S0278	so be give only the certain room

S0013	it be just the erm that's what we be a little bite concern about whether we be in within the time limit you know whether to get back to them but the solicitor say er
S0013	that the that doesn't matter at all
S0278	yeah
S0013	that
S0278	but if would nice a lot of people
