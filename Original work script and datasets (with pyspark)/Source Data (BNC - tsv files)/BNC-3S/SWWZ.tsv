S0328	and it be just interest i'm gonna make them
S0328	i'm gonna make the pastry tomorrow that's what's gonna happen
S0330	yeah so just slice a bite of orange in anyway it's not important as long as it doesn't even matter as long as there be pies in the morning cos it's 's birthday a few days after so we probably have to make
S0328	jesus christ
S0330	we'll have to get a goose and we'll have to
S0328	get a goose i'm try to get the best goose possible
S0330	yeah i'm really excite about the goose
S0326	how big be a goose have a whole goose be you gonna have to pluck it
S0330	it's gonna be no we don't have to pluck he's a butcher isn't he he'll have pluck it
S0328	yeah it will be pluck
S0330	yeah you don't give someone a bird with all the feather on that's kind of weird
S0330	although
S0326	i just i just remember talk about pluck this bird
S0330	oh yeah no
S0326	while it be still warm
S0330	no we do kill a goose last year
S0328	er
S0330	yeah that be
S0330	and we pluck it
S0328	er oh man okay butcher
S0330	a goose it's gonna be sick
S0328	geese be a bite weird once they get to a certain size they put weight on the bone rather than breast so you have as much meat on a small one as on a big one so he say he's gonna get a small one
S0330	doesn't make any sense
S0328	no
S0330	if you start put oh
S0328	fat on instead of meat
S0330	oh it's meat on on the bone so they start get heavier but no no no that doesn't make sense
S0328	he no no he's like er rather than like flesh they just get fat like a bigger layer of fat
S0330	oh er oh like people
S0328	after a certain weight cos er turkeys be the opposite
S0330	like people
S0328	turkeys just get like more and more flesh
S0330	right right right right
S0328	after a certain weight and less fat but he's like i've ask for a small one
S0330	okay
S0328	but so er so then we'll get the best value
S0330	yeah that sound good
S0328	cos it's price by weight i just say get the very best one you can whatever it be
S0330	yeah
S0328	he know what he's do i think
S0330	and how be you pay be you gonna pay for it with with cake
S0328	i have do a job for him for which he owe me a hundred pound he reckon that the goose'll be about fifty pound so i'm just gonna take it off that invoice
S0330	okay well
S0328	so it's just like that so if you guy get some vegetables and i can get some too you know i don't care
S0330	or well what about wine for example
S0328	yeah well just i mean i really i'm not that bother about it so erm let's just all get nice stuff there's not gonna be heap of stuff anyway
S0330	okay
S0328	and like
S0330	so we'll bring some wine
S0328	yeah
S0330	cos that's important
S0328	get wine erm
