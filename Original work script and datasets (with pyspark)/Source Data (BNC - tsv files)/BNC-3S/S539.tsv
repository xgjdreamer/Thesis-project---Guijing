S0257	of what she think the word be
S0258	yeah
S0257	she might have hear a word
S0258	yeah
S0257	and she will almost like a child repeat it how the the way she's hear it but it's not necessarily the right word
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	give us another reason to laugh at her
S0255	so be it be it maltese be that the language
S0257	mm
S0255	do you so do you speak maltese
S0257	no we er er pick up odd word from go there because we'd go there every sort of two or three years as children and you know you learn yes no hello goodbye
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	and then some of the erm the food where there isn't a an english translation we would call it the the maltese term
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	erm but so many people be you know family and because everybody's your family everybody's relate cos the island's so tiny
S0255	mm
S0257	and they'd they'd say do your mum not teach you maltese and it'd be almost quite sort of shock horror
S0255	mm
S0257	and then when my sisters and i be old enough one of them find a course at college a language course in maltese so we all enrol
S0255	yeah oh right
S0258	amaze
S0257	but i think there be maybe six people so the four of us and two other random
S0255	yeah
S0257	people and there wasn't enough to to warrant run the course
S0258	oh that's a shame
S0255	oh that's a shame
S0257	but it's a really difficult language because it's it's erm it's a little bite sort of like it's not like italian a lot of people think it will be
S0255	right
S0258	yeah i would've think so yeah
S0257	that kind of but it's not it's more sort of arabic erm
S0258	oh okay
S0257	latin influence as well so whilst it's all they have their own alphabet
S0258	yeah
S0257	so it's a little bite it's not not as not as different to english as greek be there's a lot of
S0258	yeah
S0257	english form letter
S0255	mm
S0257	but then there be some like there'll be an h and it's get a cross through one
S0258	yeah
S0257	two cross through one of the one of the upright bar so it's it it it you can tell it's not the english language
S0258	yeah
S0257	erm and a lot of the pronunciations of the letter be different as they be in in many other languages as well it's so difficult to read
S0258	yeah
S0257	but because it be a little country that's have to evolve with the whole of the rest of the world
S0258	mm
S0257	a lot of people the majority of people will speak english they're they're teach italian very young as well there's a lot of er dare i say intermarriages between maltese and italians
S0258	yeah
S0257	maltese and
S0255	mm
S0257	cos it's closer to the
S0258	it's
S0257	to the coast of north africa
S0255	i be just gonna say where be it
S0257	than it be to europe
S0255	i don't know where it be
S0258	i think it be near portugal and i'm no get the wrong end
S0257	no no no it's just a stone's throw from tunisia
S0258	oh okay
S0257	mm so there's a lot of
S0258	yeah
S0257	arabic money in the country
S0258	yeah
S0257	all the investment be all arabs
S0258	right
S0255	mm
S0257	erm so there's a lot of wealth move into the country but er when you live in such a tiny population
S0258	yeah
S0257	there's more people live more maltese people live in other countries in the world
S0258	yeah
S0257	than they live in malta it's smaller than the isle of wight
S0258	huh oh my god
S0257	yeah
S0258	wow
S0257	so they've
S0255	i didn't realise that
S0257	they've have to
S0258	no
S0257	they've have to develop so yeah my one of my cousins have three little ones and my the last time i saw her the youngest one be about eighteen months she's marry to an italian he doesn't speak maltese she doesn't speak brilliant italian
S0258	oh god
S0257	so they both speak english
S0258	oh right
S0255	mm
S0257	but he speak italian to the children who be fluent
S0255	yeah
S0257	she speak maltese to the children that's their mother tongue so they're fluent in that and they all speak english as well so eighteen months old
S0258	that's amaze
S0255	mm
S0257	they switch like that
S0255	yeah
S0258	that's amaze
S0257	from italian to daddy maltese to mummy english to
S0255	mm
S0257	us when we're visit they're just er it it just make you stop and
S0255	we've get that with some friends of ours he's english er from jamaica his family be she's finnish and they live in switzerland
S0258	oh okay
S0257	okay
S0255	so er they've get a daughter as well who's about ten now but he he speak german erm and so the the mum speak finnish to the little girl
S0258	yeah
S0255	the dad speak german and english and she will literally be in the middle of the conversation and then throw a couple of word to somebody in a different language
S0258	yeah
S0255	and then back and mid sentence chop to
S0258	that's amaze
S0255	and and it be
S0258	yeah
S0255	she's she's just and she go to a school which be for when they've get english as a second language
S0258	right
S0255	because er er well when they're not i'm not sure whether it's actually because german isn't the first language
S0258	oh right
S0257	mm
S0255	quite possibly because
S0258	yeah
S0255	er yeah cos it's switzerland it's the german part of of switzerland so she go to a school and they actually spend time with her work on all the different languages to make sure that she's come on and be able to do everything in those languages as well
S0257	in all of them it's amaze isn't it
S0255	mm but they say that don't they when it's when you're really young that's when you can pick up languages
S0257	mm the time to do it yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah pick them up really easily
S0257	i'm quite disgust that children don't have to learn a language in school now they they i think they have to teach them
S0258	don't they
S0257	erm when they start secondary school
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	but erm so be bear in nineteen ninety four so she finish school just over two years ago three three years ago and erm when she be pick her gcse subject she didn't have to choose a language

S0258	mm
S0255	probably by about the third of fourth i'll get feed up
S0258	yeah
S0255	because either it's just write in the same way or
S0257	the same character
S0255	you know what's
S0258	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	what's you can like foretell it quite easily
S0257	mm

S0257	mm
S0258	those labyrinth of osiris book be fantastic

S0255	labyrinth of osiris osiris be there be er something
S0258	yeah the lose army of cambyses
S0255	yeah
S0258	and there be another one
S0255	and then there be another one but i think that be the three
S0258	just brilliant though or maybe
S0255	i didn't know there be er
S0258	maybe he might have write another one but it wasn't connect or something
S0255	oh
S0258	cos he die didn't he do you read
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah really sad
S0255	yeah
S0257	oh really
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0258	i think his wife might have release one or
S0255	right
S0258	that he be work on or something
S0257	oh
S0258	i think that might be
S0255	that's like that the girl with the dragon tattoo
S0257	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	cos he die didn't he
S0258	yeah
S0255	erm but his partner of many many years apparently now say that she do a lot of the write with him and she's gonna finish off this book
S0258	yeah of course she do
S0255	that he start
S0258	see i love those book i think they so good
S0255	oh they be yeah
S0258	like the first time i read em i be just like wow
S0255	mm yeah
S0258	so good
S0255	have you see any of the film
S0258	yeah i think the original one be better isn't it have you see the one in
S0255	i haven't see any of the film but i've just i've read the book but for me i just think the film will probably be a bite sensationalised
S0257	mm
S0255	er
S0258	there be a film that's actually in that the swedish make
S0255	right
S0258	and it's dub over that be very very good but then there's one with daniel craig in and
S0255	that's it yeah yeah
S0258	which be still it's quite a good film though
S0255	mm
S0258	er i've watch em both and like i think
S0255	well it's a good story but i just think i just think put in on the big screen they're go to hollywoodise it and make it a bite
S0258	yeah
S0255	you know
S0258	i think they do it i think it be it be still do well but
S0255	mm
S0258	it wasn't as good as the original if you know what i mean
S0255	okay
S0257	yeah
S0258	like the actual one
S0255	mm
S0257	well it's like the trailers that have be on at the moment for before i go to sleep
S0255	before i go to sleep yeah mm
S0258	oh yeah
S0257	cos when i hear that that be come out i think
S0255	yes
S0257	brilliant that's
S0255	yeah
S0257	cos enjoy the book
S0255	yeah mm
S0258	nicole kidman
S0257	or enjoy the whole concept
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah
S0257	the whole idea and then i saw some of these trailers and i think nicole kidman the star and
S0255	to be i be at the picture and i
S0257	and it's set in america in the film and it in my head in the book
S0255	mm yeah it's it's quintessential british isn't it mm
S0257	yeah yeah absolutely
S0255	yeah cos er i know we i be actually at the at the picture watch guardians of the galaxy
S0257	oh yeah mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	so one of my friends say oh you have to come and see it it's brilliant so we go to watch that and this be one of the trailers
S0257	mm
S0255	and i be i be think huh and one thing colin firth
S0258	mm
S0255	they get him as a baddy like
S0257	mm
S0255	he's too gorgeous he can't be a baddy and that
S0255	i i just i don't think i can go and watch him be a baddy
S0258	he's not a baddy
S0255	no he's not he's he's too good
S0258	he's not a baddy
S0257	yeah
S0255	good too good look for that so i think that would put me off slightly i keep look think who be that who be that for the the lead woman and er then it sort of flash up and go nicole kidman and i think be that nicole kidman and then when i look i could see it be
S0257	mm
S0255	and as soon as i know it be i think i don't think i could go and watch her be that because
S0257	mm
S0255	she isn't the sort of person i would put in the character
S0257	no
S0258	no
S0255	and i find that when you read a book
S0257	mm
S0255	you you picture them how you picture them
S0257	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	and you you've get the whole character there not just maybe a physical side
S0257	yeah
S0258	mm
S0255	and you er so if you then watch the film it's just like er that's not what they're like and and a lot of film as well they change things don't they to make it right
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah of course yeah
S0255	that didn't happen you've miss out that that be important and
S0257	i i that's one reason i don't or i try not to watch film if i've read the book
S0255	mm
S0257	i'll sometimes read the book if i've see the film like erm captain corelli's mandolin
S0258	mm
S0255	oh yes
S0257	i've see that at the cinema and i really like it
S0255	mm i saw that on sky
S0257	and then i pick up the book like
S0255	yeah
S0258	i do that for a level that book yeah
S0257	i think i pick up the book at a jumble sale
S0255	mm
S0257	or something like that and i think well you know i like the
S0255	yeah
S0257	and and the book's just so lovely
S0255	i read the book
S0258	mm
S0255	and it's fantastic
S0258	mm
S0255	and then when it come out i i like nicolas cage so when i saw that and i just think it be him in it isn't it
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0257	it be yeah
S0255	yeah yeah and i think oh and i watch it and i yeah i really enjoy it
S0257	mm
S0258	do you know i remember erm when i be do my a level i think just after gcses they give us a list like in that summer holiday period for everyone who's do the a level english light
S0255	mm
S0258	like these be the book that if you've get the grade you'll be do and i start read that captain corelli before
S0255	yeah
S0258	and i just fell in love with it
S0255	yeah
S0258	it's such a good book
S0257	yeah
S0255	oh it be it's so lovely
S0257	you fall in love with the set as well
S0258	i've still get my copy of the note
S0255	yeah exactly
S0258	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	it's cephalonia be it cephalonia
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah yeah
S0258	yeah yeah i go there yeah
S0255	do you mm
S0258	yeah erm the day the day i find out i be pregnant with we be go there
S0258	it be beautiful though it's lovely
S0255	yeah
S0257	mm
S0258	it's a lovely place yeah
S0255	yeah it must be and when you saw when they've do the film the they do such lovely picture
S0258	yeah
S0255	like all the scenery as well so
S0258	oh yes it's perfect isn't it
S0255	yeah
S0258	in the in the film
S0255	mm yeah that be a really good book
S0258	yeah really good
S0257	i do get quite cross though when i'm watch a film if they've miss a bite out of the book
S0255	yeah
S0257	and it tend to spoil the rest of the film
S0258	oh completely
S0255	mm
S0257	and i think if whoever i've with it tend to spoil it for them as well cos i spend the next however long go but that didn't happen
S0255	yeah yeah
S0258	oh i know
S0257	and that's not how i imagine it and that's not how he write it
S0258	i get really i get really mad
S0257	i do
S0255	mm
S0258	do you do you watch the reacher film with tom cruise
S0255	no
S0258	i dunno if you guy didn't like the reacher book do you
S0255	i don't like don't like tom cruise
S0258	oh yeah
S0257	i don't
S0255	so and i couldn't imagine him be a six foot odd marine
S0258	oh exactly
S0255	i just so i just think no
S0258	exactly
S0255	it's it's not happen
S0258	which i think i i'm sure that must be cos the actual film if you ignore tom cruise be quite good
S0255	mm yeah
S0258	like the story's a almost
S0255	yeah
S0258	that kind of thriller
S0255	yeah i've read the i've read jack reacher
S0258	yeah
S0255	i've read a lot of the book
S0258	yeah they're like write for like
S0255	mm
S0258	to be a film in a way cos there's always a twist at the end
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm
S0258	and you can sort of see it
S0255	yeah
S0258	but i'm sure like tom cruise just
S0255	but you don't need to have somebody like him buy the right
S0258	no
S0255	and then from that say
S0258	yeah
S0255	oh i think i'll cast myself as this
S0258	exactly
S0257	but do you think that's the only reason he buy the right because
S0255	he want to see himself as a six foot
S0257	he wasn't be ask to do it
S0255	marine
S0258	mm
S0255	yeah quite possibly
S0257	and you you'd think the only way that that's gonna happen for him to be this six foot marine
S0258	mm
S0257	be to shrink everything else down all the prop and everybody else in the film
S0258	yeah yeah exactly yeah
S0257	walk along crouch down a few inch
S0258	massive heel platforms yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	we be watch erm er you know they have the er
S0258	oh
S0255	the open air film night
S0258	oh yeah yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	well we didn't go to that we be at the lake
S0258	yeah
S0255	but we decide to have an open air film night at the lake
S0258	oh lovely
S0257	a film
S0255	so we take all our projector stuff out the conservatory take it all down there
S0258	yeah
S0255	except for the screen and we do er a gazebo and peg sheet
S0258	oh fantastic
S0257	oh
S0255	and we're all sit outside and we do top gun cos they be do top gun and dirty dance
S0257	yeah
S0258	oh lovely
S0255	so we think right we'll do top gun so we get it all go as soon as it get dark
S0258	yeah
S0255	and it be oh it be absolutely brilliant erm er my mate even go and she get a a box from the supermarket and she come out with ice cream and popcorn midway
S0258	oh
S0255	with a little torch and she'd make herself a little tray
S0258	oh fantastic
S0255	it be really funny but with tom cruise in that you we be sort of look go oh look he's nearly as tall as her now cos kelly mcgillis isn't it
S0258	yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	oh he's not quite as tall oh she must be stand on er on
S0257	yeah
S0255	he must be stand on a shorter box or something and it's just like
S0257	continuity
S0255	yeah
S0258	you just can't take him seriously really can you
S0255	no
S0257	no
S0255	no
S0258	which be a shame cos he's in quite a few good film of like
S0255	mm
S0258	that i remember if you know what i mean
S0257	oh yeah
S0258	like that and
S0255	i think the first one that be like
