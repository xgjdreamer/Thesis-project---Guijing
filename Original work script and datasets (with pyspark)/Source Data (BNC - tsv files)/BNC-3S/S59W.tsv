S0012	yeah
S0152	they be ah they be just at the moment they're just off the wall
S0012	that's weird innit why be that what be they be feed on
S0152	i just dunno they're just off the wall this afternoon there be an exam and the exam start at one thirty and it be for an hour i think the i think it be for an hour and a half yeah it be for an hour and a half so one thirty two thirty not only a hour maybe it be only a hour which mean that they would be ready for their last lesson
S0012	yeah
S0152	thirty of them this be year eleven decide that they weren't go to go to their last lesson they get out the build
S0012	out of the build
S0013	yeah
S0152	they they leave the build
S0012	why be that
S0152	because they be be tell they could
S0012	who on earth tell them
S0152	right so you've get one person you've get two people say you're stay in school until the end of the day
S0012	yeah
S0152	even though you have an exam because you've still get lessons to go to and then you've get the new head who have kind of say oh if they're if they've do their exam in the afternoon they can go home
S0012	oh
S0152	nobody nobody be tell one person or the other person what's what
S0012	oh that's a bite bad innit
S0152	right and then of course the students that haven't get exams
S0012	they want to go home as well
S0152	they want to go home cos it's not fair
S0012	that's right
S0152	so with my group this afternoon i get laptops and i get i say right you can go on bitesize this afternoon cos they've get their exam this time next week
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	i say you can go on bitesize and you will do some revision question now i only have eight but pff two do it two do it no problem at all no real issue but the other six there be issue
S0012	be there
S0152	one didn't do anything i'm not do it it's not fair they've go home i'm not do it
S0013	mm
S0152	you've get an exam next week yeah and so what
S0013	yeah
S0012	well we never use to be able to talk like that to teacher's do we
S0013	no
S0152	you know i really didn't feel like actually record it now would i the thing be if i record it and then play it back to the senior team would i then get into trouble
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos cos it's the cos it's then
S0012	you're suppose to have permission anyway to record if they give you permission they'd be fine won't they but then i don't know
S0152	it's like should i should i you know should i put a camera on me and show the abuse that you have to put up with from some students
S0013	mm
S0012	well there be a case for that
S0013	tempt
S0012	because in some er preschools and and not preschools nurseries they use to have the cameras on
S0013	they have to do that
S0012	so that the parent could see how they be behave didn't they
S0152	yeah
S0013	yeah cos there be a lot of trouble weren't they in some of these nurseries
S0012	cos there be a lot of trouble about it all in the nurseries
S0013	mm
S0012	and er you know it be all about abuse and stuff like that wasn't it and things so they have they have the cameras i don't know if they still do it
S0152	but but i know you know have be at that higher position i know if you're in a high position even our senior managers the kid don't have any respect for them as such they push it and push it and push it and walk away from them
S0012	do they
S0152	so as a classroom teacher you've get no chance
S0012	no
S0152	because they don't see you be a head of school or a vice principal or anything like that they don't see it as the they just say oh so what so what we can still walk away when they do that
S0013	mm
S0012	what an attitude
S0013	yeah
S0012	it's a terrible attitude
S0013	how do you deal with it really
S0012	do they come to school do they start that school with that attitude
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	so what happen to the other school the middle school or whatever you call it
S0152	same type of thing
S0012	so how do they
S0152	it depend it depend on which middle school they come from
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah but then what happen be you get the kid who see them get away with it
S0012	well of course you do you get that all the time don't you but
S0013	the other side mm
S0012	but you you get decent kid that think oh dear i'm not have anything to do with them you know i'll keep out the way sometimes they get bully don't they
S0152	yeah i i've my product design group be year nines apart from one student who just will not do anything
