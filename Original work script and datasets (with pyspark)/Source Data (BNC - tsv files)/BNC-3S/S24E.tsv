S0520	the idea be to meet with them on the sunday but i mean i'm not fully sure whether 's go to go on this trip but he have plan to go on a motorcycle trip with this weekend so we're assume that he's not go to be there
S0519	that's he just not
S0520	which case it make it harder for because she be in control of the kid and both of them and like if we're at lunch and 's go spare
S0519	no no it's no fun
S0520	and 's there he can take him out and play whereas if it's just her
S0519	yeah
S0521	yeah
S0519	no i think let's take be we're go to meet them let's go to some sort of activity like er an adventure park or a a zoo or a something and take a picnic and walk round and chat and let the children have fun and run about
S0520	well what we be think be we'd go for lunch and then we'd do that but lunch be not the main event you know because with the the kid
S0519	well let's just have a picnic or fish and chip or you know
S0520	we could but it's not as fun
S0521	it's
S0520	picnic be only nice when it's really sunny otherwise it's depress
S0519	yeah it's what i mean be if you book a restaurant for lunch i mean a nice café be better with a little park and as you say just have a quick lunch you know
S0520	yeah
S0519	not a if you want to have a nice meal chat lunch it's too much for the kid
S0520	yeah it doesn't work that's what she say as well which be fine yeah well in that case we should just decide on like a park or something to meet them and go around
S0519	mm bring their bike have a walk
S0520	have a walk the kid can do whatever
S0519	and have a some sort of café lunch
S0520	mm i mean that's the thing i say to if we meet in the way of like a lunch as well then it's over and then what you know if she if she be come all the way here we could spend the day and you know we'd be in and out of the house
S0519	no that's the trouble mm
S0520	and but she say even then she say the children will be crazy
S0519	take the kid mm
S0520	they'll be cooped if they're cooped up then it won't be a nice thing
S0519	no you need the swim pool and the whole thing
S0520	you need to be do stuff with them don't you and that's fine and we could go out well we don't even have to go out all the time it's not really necessary
S0519	no and i mean i'd love i'd love to cook and be happy to but also it's nice to eat out and
S0520	mm
S0519	enjoy it make it that it's like a an event and we're out and it's
S0520	yeah groovy
S0519	erm but would you like to go to the queen's head and do he eat fish
S0520	yeah
S0519	okay so that make it easier
S0520	queen's head we should go saturday maybe
S0519	yeah just cos i think it's an it's an english pub
S0520	yeah i know defo
S0521	mm
S0519	it's old quirky and he can have a little half pint of some ale and he can either have
S0521	steady on
S0519	one of the traditional well he might not fancy a full pint
S0520	well he's not go to drink a pint of ale at this point be he
S0520	poor guy he's not he's not erm
S0519	a drinker
S0520	a drinker
S0521	not a drinker
S0519	that's just as well
S0520	not that he's like so it's not about be principled he just
S0519	he just doesn't do it
S0520	it's like they don't come from that kind of culture it's like we go out for dinner in thailand every night nobody be drink alcohol
S0519	no
S0520	not really maybe like they'd do
S0519	so the israelis not really have wine
S0520	no not really
S0519	no
S0520	it's not like it's not sort of like a mediterranean every meal there's a wine bottle of the wine on the table not really
S0519	mm it's not like that
S0520	i mean the boys would have a beer maybe but
S0519	mm
S0520	they don't go out a drink they do
S0519	mm
S0520	have a great nightlife but a lot of it be coffee shop as well so people drink coffee
S0519	mm interest
S0520	like in greece they do that as well people would be go out to have a coffee at like ten pm eleven pm as a social thing you know so
S0521	right
S0519	mm interest
S0520	it's not really alcohol orientate i mean people go out and party and like that's what he do when he be young as well drink alcohol and have fun but not like in the way it be here
S0519	but i mean you don't have to explain but
S0520	no i know but i'm just say it's not because he's like erm pious or something
S0519	no it's just no god
S0520	erm i mean the vegetarianism be the same as me he just do it a long time since a long time ago erm but he do eat fish so
S0519	that make it easier

S0520	it be a really beautiful country you forget that don't you
S0521	yes it be

S0520	mm

S0520	i think the main event be beer drink but erm i think you can do it in quite a civilise way it's not all kind of i mean i'm sure there's a lot of stag do and
S0519	i think there might be
S0520	british lairyness
S0519	british bill beer swill
S0520	but erm
S0521	well german beer swill
S0520	yeah i think they're quite the fan of beer in germany
S0521	they do steins don't they
S0520	stein i just enjoy be able to understand everything i feel like i could learn german really quickly
S0521	yeah
S0519	mm oh you would dutch
S0520	from the dutch yeah
S0519	the dutch would be a big hook
S0520	and erm
S0521	yeah
S0519	do you do o level you do erm gcse german
S0521	i always enjoy
S0520	i do gcse and i do a level for a while but then i drop up cos i be do five i think but erm i really enjoy it and erm
S0521	sound like you be impress with germany
S0520	i be i think we all be we be all kind of like we've be in all these place you know and erm
S0519	mm and here we be
S0520	we think greece be go to be pretty ideal
S0519	the best
S0521	yeah
S0520	for us cos we think it will be cheaper and it's kind of beautiful and erm
S0519	you're on an island and it's peaceful
S0520	greek people be nice and in fact it's really popular to do yoga type stuff you know a lot of people do meditation slash yoga retreat in greece cos you know it's a bite of a relax atmosphere hot you know almost like a vacation but it just didn't work quite as well and something in germany be really ideal for the way that we be and the way that we like to do things and structure things and
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	and the atmosphere be just very very nice and peaceful and erm you know simple in a simple way you know i don't know how to explain
S0519	mm mm i yes i i remember when we go at so i'm i'm go to say that i think that it's probably just very similar but every time i be in switzerland and every time i be in austria
S0520	yeah
S0519	i have exactly the same that the bedroom would be just beautiful clean simple like a wooden bed and when you get in it be the softest duvet in the world and the just white cotton and just it would feel like heaven and it be always simple and clean and the air be pure clean fresh
S0520	exactly mm yeah
S0519	and it just felt really really nice
S0520	mm
S0519	just erm like you
S0521	you must be a northern european at heart
S0519	i must be i just really like that erm
S0520	i do as well i mean i this be the difference as well that i feel that i there's a certain kind of home familiarity
S0519	yeah
S0520	that you you know as soon as you get further south like mediterranean south it really do feel like you're a foreigner
S0519	it's quite
S0521	different
S0519	you're a you do you don't know
S0520	you don't quite understand why people be behave in that way
S0519	i know and i i i don't i i love the warm but i don't like the countryside
S0520	which be fun but
S0519	it look bare
S0521	parch
S0519	and grey and
S0520	very dry
S0519	dry out and i love when you're in the green forest
S0520	yeah that's what the israelis be say
S0519	and it's warm
S0520	they be like it's so green
S0519	mm and it's warm
S0520	we say yeah yeah i mean it it be there yeah
S0519	er you know that be and then the air be like pure and the mist go up from the mountains that to me be like the most beautiful
S0520	i agree with you
S0521	what about norway then be it how do you compare with germany and norway
S0520	mm i love norway norway be
S0519	stun
S0520	absolutely stun
S0519	just colder and darker
S0521	scenically i know that but i mean in term of the the general pace of life
S0520	yeah similar yeah very similar i mean it's like a
S0521	similar to germany
S0520	even yeah i mean it's get its own flavour because first of all i think they're a bite ethnically different like you know they have like they look different the norse thing be there i don't know it's like scottish and english you know it's like there's something where you say there's a there's a definite
S0521	yeah
S0519	freckle and red hair and white pale skin
S0520	not only spiritedly
S0519	mm
S0520	you know so i feel like norwegians
S0521	the norseman
S0520	have more of a celtic thing as well that they just yeah something be and the language be again like you know they have a it's germanic but there's a lot of norse influence as well
S0521	mm
S0520	erm and also it's just a quite a unique place i think because it's so small and because small population and they're sort of do their own thing up there
S0521	they're do their own thing i think that's what i would say rather than it be integrate in europe it's more
S0520	exactly feel less european
S0521	feel norwegian
S0520	and they have this very strong socialist thing i mean i mean i don't know if you'd notice that if you be a tourist but
S0519	i'd like to go and you do though
S0520	erm in term of how the people of how people think about stuff that's really a strong influence and er they have quite a different mentality because of it i mean i get to know it because of but the idea of kind of erm group over individual if you like
S0519	mm
S0520	come come across quite strongly in some things like in their in their education system they be very strongly condition not to put themselves set themselves apart
S0521	mm
S0520	through any way you know through achievement for instance which you know be one of the main differences
S0521	i i find that the family thing be very strong
S0520	yeah
S0521	you in the when i go over generally speak when i go to somewhere people would change their routine to suit me in other word typically we'd work late and things like that
S0520	mm
S0521	but the norwegians they be out of the door at four o'clock whatever happen
S0520	yeah no chance
S0521	it be very much the family first
S0520	mm
S0521	yeah none of this er you know now of the super super hard work for sort of thing
S0520	work no well they don't have the same kind of the motivation precisely for that reason or that's what think that what motivation would you have if you're not suppose to succeed like that there's no meritocracy you know if you're not reward for innovative behaviour that put you apart from other people you know you're kind of suppose to serve the system and it's the place where i've see it the strongest most strongest erm actually in practice and er leave and go to america go to england to university partly for that reason i think
S0521	mm mm mm yeah do he
S0519	mm explore the other side
S0520	yeah because it's a bite deaden he he always have quite you know he be always a really creative person and he want to you know a bite entrepreneurial and there be just no opportunities there for him although i think he stay there eventually mm
S0520	yeah erm you say about family we have a couple in the teach she's norwegian and he's israeli and they meet when they be travel abroad and he live there with her now they have a child and erm i be talk to him about it sort of say how how do you find norway i can't think of any two more diametrically oppose countries and obviously they'd decide to stay there instead of erm
S0519	mm israel
S0520	be in israel for like many good reason but erm i say to him have you manage to integrate into the erm culture
S0519	mm
S0521	yeah
S0520	and he say well i've be there for ten years and maybe just people be just start to open up to me
S0520	you know because they be and i find that to be true as well people be just very er burried in on their own world
S0519	in their own world
S0520	life there yeah and they be quite unused to foreigners cos they didn't have immigration until quite recently
S0521	mm
S0520	so i could just and they're quite you know they're stoic northerners they're not like erm open open up their hearts home and families to other people
S0519	and that's no no
S0521	it's funny though cos we we we generally saw the other side didn't we when we go down south on holiday
S0519	mm
S0521	and sort of get the business with with spain italy and so on when we go back we felt people be rude and impolite didn't we
S0519	yes but i also often felt more at home
S0519	because i i felt more secure like i know what i be do
S0521	right
S0519	you know when we would go out when we go on holiday to france we'd go out in the afternoon and spain to buy food for our picnic and everybody be asleep and then we eat our dinner at six in the even and everybody be still asleep and they all eat their dinner at ten a night
S0521	spain be like that
S0519	and we didn't know what we be do we felt you now kind of confuse
S0520	it's a bite weird isn't it yeah we do the same the greece the first day you know always when you arrive you kind of don't get it yet and erm we try all the restaurants be empty you know this be at nine pm anyway we think we be late for dinner
S0519	mm mm no no that's right
S0520	and erm
S0519	well we could never have any problem get a table cos we be far too early
S0520	exactly and then you see at eleven
S0519	everybody's out
S0520	everyone's out and about well it doesn't make sense in when it's freeze
S0519	mm no quite
S0520	the climate in norway be considerably colder than europe
S0519	yeah
S0520	i mean it really be very cold there
S0519	and darker in the winter
S0520	it's build around the they're build around cold weather completely
S0519	mm and rain
S0520	and snow
S0519	and snow
S0521	yeah
S0520	so everyone ski some
S0521	i think the south of norway's on a par with isn't it stavanger's sort of more or less most of norway would be north of
S0519	no
S0520	yeah
S0519	yeah
S0520	and i mean the thing be be it's the gulf stream
S0519	but it's not it's not even stavanger wouldn't be the same weather as i would think it be much wetter
S0521	because of the
S0520	because it's on the west coast
S0521	western wind
S0519	it's on the west yeah
S0520	it be like an incredible statistic it's like i think it's from bergen i think it's like a three hundred and twenty days of rain
S0521	really
S0520	a year
S0519	oh dear
S0520	we're talk a wet place
S0521	no you're probably right in term of temperature
S0519	yeah yeah
S0520	no temperature no and also the thing be erm the gulf stream go i think it go south of britain and then it go up towards erm scandinavia and that's the only reason that it's even inhabitable
S0521	it's not freeze yeah
S0520	because if you look at the equivalent on the south pole
S0519	mm
S0520	you know latitude south you know there's nothing it's just an ice cap
S0519	mm mm
S0521	yeah
S0519	interestingly the the we we're have the last two summer certainly worse summer because the gulf stream have shift south
S0520	mm
S0521	that's true yeah
S0519	and it's leave us in you you know it's it's it's warm below us instead of warm us
S0521	yeah
S0519	and cause us to be right in a kind of low pressure above it
S0520	rubbish
S0521	there be a thing in the paper
S0520	but if it move we're stymie
S0520	we're stymie yeah that's what they say as well
S0521	there be a thing in the paper be it the paper we saw it it say erm the forecast be that europe get hotter but the northern countries get cooler because of the gulf stream that's the forecast for the come years

S0520	it's always sunny at 's it's significantly warmer i notice even you know you go on the train from here to 's significantly warmer when you step of the train it's an hour and twenty minutes it's not really a significant distance but it be something in the climate
S0521	no
S0520	change there
S0519	mm i think it's they've get the high mountains to the
S0521	it'll be the mountains welsh mountains
S0519	west of them and i i think that just take the rain off and then they just get that little bite of protection
S0521	might be a bite of rain shadow
S0519	from the rain shadow and then as you move across the it's a big valley and then the pennines
S0520	mm
S0519	then manchester's just at the foot of the pennines so it get the rain again as it as the cloud lift back up but there's just that little splodge in the middle where live that's in a little sunny spot

S0519	that it's right at the foot of the pennines again
S0521	yes

S0520	we all get enough rain to last us
S0519	mm
S0520	yeah it's fair enough
S0519	you need to be on the east coast to be dry
S0520	i i i i do think it would be
S0519	but i just because of 's i know it's a bite pathetic but i just think mm be nice to be down there where it seem to be warmer than anywhere else
S0521	in dorset dorset would be nice
S0520	that's what 's parent do
S0521	oh yeah
S0520	erm devon i think and she be like yeah but why do you move back to england to erm if you're go to live in devon cos they i i think i tell you they move to spain
S0519	mm do they
S0521	oh they do yeah
S0520	yeah they have a house there erm when they retire and they live there for a few years and they just miss the family too much and you know realise that that be really what be important to them overall in term of their retirement
S0521	right
S0519	mm
S0520	so they move back to england but they move to
S0521	move to devon for the weather
S0520	which be really far away from here
S0521	it be it be
S0519	it's very far away from here
S0520	and her sister's at and have children so i think they that's what they be think
S0519	that be the plan
S0520	but be a bite offend i think
S0521	oh dear
S0519	yeah but then have the you know the ability to the flexibility to drive and
S0520	the flexibility to go down yeah well they do quite often at the weekend they
S0519	but they're cold here he every the first thing her dad say every time i meet him
S0521	cold
S0519	how be you cold
S0521	yeah cos they don't have heat
S0519	no that's right
S0520	erm we have we be laugh about it they i think have to provide a er oil radiator for her parent in the bedroom
S0521	right
S0520	cos they just won't put up with it
S0521	no ever likely they won't
S0520	but they both quite often go away for the weekend i think they go down to
S0521	right
S0520	or wherever you know erm that's where their friends be and stuff they kind of want to have it that way round
S0521	so where be she from
S0520	he be in the army so they've move around a lot
S0521	oh right
S0520	be it the navy maybe in the navy
S0519	mm
S0520	but erm they do spend quite a few years up here in
S0521	mm
S0520	i don't exactly remember where i think a bite further south than here so that's where she come back
S0519	but the be also say they didn't feel very settle yet
S0521	in devon
S0519	in devon
S0521	yeah
S0519	and i feel that for us it it it's important to to be in a place where we have some connection not just a place
S0520	just an arbitrary
S0519	that be arbitrary
S0520	well devon would be really arbitrary wouldn't it
S0521	mm yeah
S0520	whereas but i think i mean in a way they're probably in a similar situation to you they've live in a lot of place and when it come down to retire they didn't know where
S0519	where to retire to
S0520	to retire yeah
S0519	and the children be far apart
S0520	exactly
S0519	er and you you just don't know
S0520	mm
S0519	erm
S0520	you look poise to do something mum
S0519	i be go to do the iron because i'm sit here and i get up specially i've be awake since seven o'clock and i've nothing yet erm so i need to do the iron
S0520	you're you're allow you're retire you're allow to do nothing this be the idea
S0521	yes that alarm be very early wasn't it i be
S0519	well i've be i be awake long before the alarm as well
S0521	oh be you oh heck
S0519	mm
S0519	darn alarm be at seven o'clock
S0520	where do you go on your cycle then
S0521	oh i just do the er across to up to er be it i never get that
S0521	be it or
S0520	be next to
S0521	and then across to and back
S0520	it's a bite of a climb when you go when you turn at isn't it to be a bite of a climb
S0521	yes yes yes
S0520	a gentle one but a very long road
S0521	that's right a gentle one yes i do by the way i do the hill
S0520	on your bike
S0521	yes i i've be sort of a little bite chicken really but i think you should do this it wasn't that bad
S0520	yeah
S0521	no i be the only the only slight embarrassment be i be very close to the top and this guy just keep keep go sail past on the and say hi there
S0521	so i i put it down to the bike
S0520	be he lycra clothe
S0521	he er yes he have all of the all of the gear
S0520	there you go there you go there's a lot of those around here you just have to
S0521	yes
S0520	they have very very light bike
S0521	there must be something yes
S0520	very very light frame bike i think that's one of the things that's good for
S0521	yeah
S0520	and gear galore
S0521	they must be fit as well though
S0520	do you go up on first gear
S0521	i do in this one yeah
S0520	mm i think there's no other way
S0521	i i i i've move up to second gear to get out of
S0521	i'm aim to go onto third gear soon
S0520	i never bother my theory with hill be i mean somebody tell me when about walk up mountains and stuff
S0521	yeah
S0520	that you should walk if you're walk on an incline you should walk at a pace that you feel that you're not walk on an incline mean you should keep a continuous
S0521	right
S0520	you know so that's the way to build the overall stamina be that you don't charge up the hill at the same pace as
S0521	i think that's right yeah i i i try to keep it steady
S0520	you know so i take that with the bike as well and if it take you know if you're in first gear and you just take a really long time to get up the hill at least you get up there and you can carry on then for quite a while you're not exhaust
S0521	yeah yeah yeah yeah no it's the same walk try to keep it steady whether it's up or down
S0520	exactly yeah
S0521	but your mother's the opposite she sort of get slower and slower go up
S0521	and then she sort of leave me behind on the way down
S0519	the other thing be erm er that we need to get our i need to go to email and we need to make our decisions or get real clarification on the of our
S0521	sound like a mission you mean about the move
S0519	move the things
S0521	yeah well the only thing i need be be pickford's and then i then i've get the whole set
S0519	yeah so
S0520	take a erm photograph of as well just send it to her
S0519	i that's what i think i would do cos i do send her a photograph initially erm
S0520	she do some before and after shots as well
S0519	yeah so erm i'll do that yeah i don't know where change your mind about the finish come in you know that's really
S0520	no that's your job
S0519	that's our problem not theirs
S0520	mm i mean you could ask them to do it but they would pay they would have you'd have to pay them
S0519	i could ask them their their advice yeah that's what i think
S0521	well be that just a question of paint it on
S0519	if it's a question of paint it on then i'll ask them to er tell me what to buy and i would buy it and do it i think that would be the way i would do it rather
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	mm
S0519	erm but er we'd have to know that you can you know over the top of what's already there
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm
S0521	i be just say you're very good downhill aren't you love
S0519	i'm very what
S0521	very good at go down hill much faster than me

S0519	i do too er because i've have it that with my ipad even before we have the extender that when i arrive it didn't recognise
S0520	really
S0519	or maybe it be since the extender but we do have an extender in and we never have any problem with it so i'd be even tempt to
S0521	really okay be that the same make
S0519	it's the same one
S0520	mm
S0519	but i've be
S0521	i don't suspect the device though
S0519	well you know just to redo the whole thing doesn't hurt
S0520	if you don't mind i'll just turn off the booster and then i'll turn it back on
S0519	well you can't just turn it back on you have to redo the wps on the
S0520	oh no ways
S0519	yeah it doesn't matter it's simple you just plug it in in here after you've turn it off and then erm there's a on the top of the
S0520	well first you connect your phone don't you before you redo it
S0519	well i don't know i i i be just assume you want to
S0520	yeah one of the less no well
S0519	the whole system and then connect your phone
S0520	one of the methods that work be if you take the router out then connect to the network
S0521	ooh i'm go to get my car polish today

S0520	cool six 0 three six connect no it's not happy i be wonder why be not tell me good morning
S0521	send his love
S0520	and now i understand
S0519	he's realise that he just can't possibly come to such a cold climate
S0520	such a cold country
S0519	he'll get rain on
S0520	yeah i think he should live in germany he like it there he can work with other efficient people
S0519	oh there you go totally sussed
S0520	cos i think he feel a bite alone in his little efficient way sometimes
S0521	mm
S0520	that's why him and and like he he love he love her
S0520	she's such a dream to his
S0519	to his ways
S0520	to to his ways of work and yeah and he just appreciate it a lot and it's take a huge burden off him cos he use to do a huge amount of work for the teach all by himself
S0519	mm
S0520	and erm there just wasn't anyone to really match him in term of erm you know do things to high standard
S0519	yeah
S0520	and also be very efficient and fast and you know manage everything until she come along so she's take a real burden of of work from him you know cos she do all of the organisational things for the retreat and she's really good at deal with the students like she's very erm she's a very compassionate woman but she's also not worry to discipline people she be a policewoman after all so you know and sometimes that need to happen and it's quite delicate inside that environment you know you don't want to create any discordance within people between people and it's not really appropriate to do so but you do people do have to follow certain rule and stuff so that it work for everyone
S0519	mm
S0520	so it's quite a delicate issue but she's very very good at it erm so it take that away from him as well and she enjoy like she doesn't mind be in a position of er be the rule enforcer you know which be quite a difficult role to be in i really don't want to be in that position personally and if i have people who be help with the book or work like as if for me i it's the last things i want to do be to say erm no you have to do it like this or like you know if they're do something wrong to say erm no to how to say reprimand someone i really don't like be in that position at all
S0519	no i don't
S0520	i'm not like an authoritative person in that way so erm but she's really er she's comfortable so that's er be that another one
S0519	no this one i've have a while
S0520	oh that's cute
S0519	it's a markies one erm and it's it's also really nice i i i decide in the need that the world be go sleeveless and i keep not cos i didn't like have flabby arm and then i think you know what you have arm
