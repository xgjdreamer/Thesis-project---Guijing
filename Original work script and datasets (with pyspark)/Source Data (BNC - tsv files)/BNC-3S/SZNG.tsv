S0013	otherwise there's a huge fine
S0008	mm

S0013	it isn't very nice be it
S0008	but there be local place isn't there if you there's one in where you can pay
S0013	be there
S0008	yeah
S0013	it just seem
S0008	i can't remember where it be but it's on somewhere like erm er the newspaper shop
S0012	yeah
S0008	ideal news or something like that
S0013	yeah pay zone or something
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh you can pay at the barber shop can't you that's get pay zone
S0013	probably i don't know
S0008	up where
S0012	in
S0008	yeah could well be
S0013	in that shop
S0013	it just seem a daft
S0008	but you you know if you're gonna do one or two journey in a year you can sort of pay for five or six and it last a year
S0012	can you
S0008	you know what i mean you don't have to
S0013	oh i see
S0008	but then it's this thing that they're clock your they're clock your car and where you're go aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know and you think
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know they you know people have become quite blasé towards this sort of constant sort of surveillance don't they
S0012	they do yeah and i i saw police camera action i don't know if you've ever see that
S0008	mm
S0012	they follow this car not by another car not by follow em they follow em from london to birmingham to i think edinburgh in the end
S0008	all on camera
S0012	all on camera they follow this car because he he'd er they'd break into somewhere and
S0008	yeah
S0012	and they they didn't want to catch him till they know where he be go
S0008	mm
S0012	and er they actually follow him into his own garage
S0008	crikey i mean they've just put
S0013	mm
S0008	one of them cameras up outside 's house
S0012	have they
S0008	mm
S0013	oh
S0008	look across the road into the
S0013	oh right
S0008	so everyone who go into get clock now
S0013	oh why be it
S0012	well that's
S0008	well the be i don't know what proportion but there's a a quite large proportion of social house in that sort of single flats there
S0013	yeah yeah
S0012	oh right
S0008	and there's always a load of trouble there
S0012	really
S0008	well not always
S0012	they're lovely place aren't they
S0008	not always a load of trouble but more trouble than the average suburban street
S0012	yeah
S0008	and like there's all drug dealers and stuff get down there
S0012	really
S0008	and er and also the the erm what do you call it the third bank
S0012	yeah
S0008	be in that church and community
S0012	oh
S0008	right so they're now clock everyone who go go phone bank and and everyone who go in and out of the
S0013	mm
S0008	and you think how you know it just suddenly appear one day
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you think well where do the permission come for this
S0012	yeah
S0008	and who do it and who be look at who
S0012	yeah
S0008	and what about all the you know the private place in the cos like there's a good there's a good proportion of em be private
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's like where should they be
S0012	clock all the time
S0008	clock all the time perhaps they prefer if it cut down crime i don't know
S0013	they might do won't they
S0008	but the worst thing be it's at the food bank i mean it's bad enough stigma you know
S0012	to have to go
S0008	don't you but other people
S0013	mm
S0008	they're really embarrass have to go to
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and you have to they have to get the ticket from social service and they're only allow three visit i think to the food bank
S0013	it's four a year i think
S0008	four a year yeah four a year
S0013	like i can't remember
S0012	ah anyhow work there doesn't he so he's be clock and and er they've have people come up in the range rovers and stuff like that for to get stuff out the food bank
S0008	yeah but see a lot of people they're either pay or even worse than that they live with massive great debts
S0012	yeah do yeah yeah
S0013	mm yeah
S0008	and er if their income source be suddenly cut off
S0012	yeah
S0008	it doesn't matter if you've get a range rover and a big house and that you can still bloom starve to death
S0012	you can yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	unless you sell your range rover or
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then a lot of the time these range rovers be be on the never never anyway
S0012	yeah that's true yeah
S0008	and even if they hand them back they probably wouldn't get any money
S0012	not get any money no
S0013	yeah
S0012	no
S0008	i mean it's just like the man have get you
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah you know really you know unless you keep graft and keep your nose to the stone
S0012	yeah
S0008	if you fall for all this advertise
S0012	oh crikey yeah
S0008	and you know all this two holiday a year and don't you deserve this and you know this new car and stuff like this
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know i mean you can i mean these people just walk blindly
S0012	they do
S0008	you know their head be in the noose and you know one thing they can't kick against the system because they be rely they need the job
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know to get the income
S0012	yeah
S0008	and so that keep them quiet that way and the other thing be be that the people who own these company you know they can have a board meet in america oh we'll close that company that and close that down
S0012	yeah
S0008	and suddenly you get you know three or four hundred people on the you know with nothing
S0012	well it's like tesco's and bp now innit
S0008	yeah
S0012	huh look what they're now do i mean they're now bp have now sack load of people
S0008	mm
S0012	because oil price have go down and tesco's be now not build what they say they be go to build and wolverhampton i think be one of the place they'll go
S0008	they're close down big store and that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and you know no matter what people say about these store they do provide a good income for a lot of people who wouldn't necessarily get a job anywhere else
S0012	that's right yeah i mean the
S0008	if you look at the sad act who live in who work in morrison's
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know they'd never work anywhere else would they
S0012	no they wouldn't no no yeah but the problem be i mean they bring it on their selves tesco's and sainsbury's and all these other people who haven't deliveries you just phone up phone up or put em on the net they deliver it to you next day for three or four quid well that save you go to the shop and spend two or three hours shop
S0008	that's right i don't think these company someone like tesco's i don't yeah they reckon they've get mass massive land bank
S0012	they have land bank and sainsbury's isn't it
S0008	like buy up land with the the idea of maybe they'll build store on them
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	but i don't think that they're worry at all cos they can turn that into a house for even more money
S0012	well of course they can even more yeah
S0008	and i think even like you know when they're sort of build store and that i think half the company be be interest in expand the store and the stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and the other half of the company
S0012	just in it for the money
S0008	be build up real estate
S0012	money money money
S0008	you know because they're not gonna lose out be they
S0012	no
S0008	you get all that real estate
S0012	that's right
S0008	and they you can turn it you know look at er tesco's in right
S0012	yeah
S0008	if they close that down they could build massive great industrial estate there
S0012	yeah
S0008	in that same area
S0012	and look at the house they could get there
S0008	or house or anything i mean
S0012	yeah yeah i mean it's a huge car park innit
S0008	it be absolutely massive
S0012	massive car park
S0008	yeah and where they build the store they're only build out of tick tack aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	they're like you know steel shed
S0012	yeah with a with a roof on yeah yeah
S0008	i mean when we use to build erm you know units work units
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know you know that they're only be build for the short term
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know cos of how cheap they're build you know it's just like frame with a bite of metal cladding that you can unbolt and you can take them down in a day
S0012	yeah
S0008	unbolt and take them offsite
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	cos it's only nut and bolt hold them together
S0012	there's there's a green they've still get them units up there hadn't they
S0008	they've get plenty of units up green
S0012	yeah
S0008	keep expand it as well
S0012	yeah
S0008	but yeah i be sort of think you know you know it's sort of you know when we be you you know like in our twenties and that you look at house what be build at the turn of the century
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they be sort of like get pretty old weren't they
S0012	they be yeah
S0008	they be sort of fall to bits and that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er so that'd be that'd be about seventy year old then
S0012	yeah
S0008	whereas now seventy year old house be the ones build after the war
S0012	just after the war yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know and but you'd think oh that's quite a new house but i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	well so the one build just off ever since then the the the materials have be of poorer quality haven't they
S0012	that's right yeah yeah
S0008	i mean the admittedly there's a lot of house build in the nineteen hundreds be not very good
S0012	right then the thirties be suppose to be the best best build house and of course they become
S0008	i mean i mean you know they put all the drain be you know plastic pip now
S0012	yeah
S0008	well who's to say that in a hundred years' time they have to all sort of go and get you know just sort of crumble away into nothing
S0012	that's right
S0008	they're just assume that plastic be gonna last forever
S0012	they be yeah
S0008	and you're think well they don't know because it hasn't be invent that long
S0013	yeah
S0012	no
S0013	right
S0008	you know what i mean and what would happen if like all the plastic part in all the house
S0012	the plastic plumb yeah
S0008	all start you know like decay
S0012	yeah
S0008	due to you know i don't know
S0012	the lead do years ago didn't it
S0008	yeah that's right it crumble away
S0012	that crumble away doesn't it and people's people's water systems be build on lead pip
S0008	that's right
S0012	it's scary that
S0013	mm
S0012	no wonder there's a lot of mental people in the world
S0008	yeah well they reckon this area's alright cos of the calcium
S0012	the hard water yeah
S0008	the hard water would put a layer of calcium on the inside
S0012	that's right
S0008	to protect it
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you go place like devon and that with soft water
S0012	yeah
S0008	then like the soft water actually make the lead dissolve in the water
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0013	oh dear yeah
S0012	i mean that's why half of them be mental down there
S0012	oh dear oh that's funny innit
S0008	mm have to have the gasman out the other day
S0012	do you when the gasman come to call
S0008	i hadn't notice it but when i have my boiler put in there be this guy who be one of these blokes that be sort of very brash sort of big fat cocky young brash you know

S0012	yeah
S0008	and er sort of cheerful charlie and
S0012	yeah
S0008	and he go in where the meter be and the meter's sit there and it's get like corrugate pipe go there and then a corrugate pipe come off the top
S0012	yeah
S0008	which go to the house connection
S0012	i see yeah
S0008	so this meter be off and apparently there's some new system where they've get to take the top corrugate pipe out and put a solid pipe in so it's rigid like
S0012	oh right
S0008	god know why anyway he do this and make a right mess of sort of solder up and this sort of stuff
S0012	do he
S0008	well he would yeah i know solder pour out everywhere you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er and ever since then this be in the summer there be a faint whiff of gas in the in the boiler in the er not the boiler in the meter cupboard
S0012	the meter yeah
S0008	and er nothing much you couldn't smell it outside but if you open the door to read the meter mm smell a bite of gas
S0012	didn't need to a match in to find out
S0008	anyway i erm yeah i just couldn't be bother in january the meter be run i've never seem it it seem a bite stronger you know i think we i'd better tell someone about it but i didn't really want them to cut the gas off
S0012	no
S0012	not in the winter
S0008	when it's cold and er so in in the end i think no i couldn't find the number in the end i find the number phone up the firm say oh look you know ever since your bloke change this pipe there's be a bite of a smell of gas in it oh gas oh turn it off open all your windows blah blah blah blah
S0008	i'm go yeah yeah alright and i'm think hang on it's be like this since august
S0013	well
S0008	and er you know the send a bloke round and the same guy come round
S0012	oh right
S0008	and they find that there's a little pin hole prick on the other bite of corrugate pipe
S0012	oh right
S0008	right cos i think it be what he'd do
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i think well i don't want to get the gas board out cost they're gonna say no it's your plumber
S0012	yeah
S0008	our responsibility end at the meter you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they'd probably give him a a black mark on his corgi registration or something
S0012	they would wouldn't they yeah
S0008	for not do it right anyway he find it out and he say oh i'd better call this number emergency number call this emergency number it's like yes you know instant
S0012	yeah
S0008	he say i he say i've get a smell of gas in the in the in the meter cupboard right you know close all the gas off you know you know and
S0008	blah blah blah open all your window and that
S0013	oh
S0008	you know it's just you know
S0008	we'll have someone round in our know in an hour and sure enough some bloke turn up in an hour this be after the other i'd get the other guy person he'd have go
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er
S0013	yeah
S0008	they're fairly sharp on have leak
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	well there's be a lot of people kill
S0013	yeah
S0008	house blow up and whatnot
S0012	blow up yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	point when it get blow up in a
S0013	street
S0012	be in point
S0013	there's be a street something
S0012	well it collapse and oh no that be at the it collapse and
S0008	yes it be wasn't it yes
S0012	not not the one down it be point wasn't it that get blow up
S0008	well it be it be blow up
S0013	that be the name but i can't remember what happen
S0008	yes well it be badly build one
S0012	be all collapse yeah
S0008	yeah but i think anyway he come along and er he check it with all this sort of super fine stuff and oh yeah there be this pinhole leak in this bite of pipe and he take it out and i say oh can i have a look at it yeah what for i say i just want to see what's wrong you know and this bite of corrugate pipe be sort of the you know
S0013	yes
S0008	it's stainless steel right
S0012	well
S0008	and what have happen be be that some solder and some flux from the connection at the top have drip down and stick on a bite of this corrugation and rot straight through it
S0012	wow
S0013	ooh
S0012	rot through the stainless steel
S0008	yeah
S0013	that's not good be it
S0012	wow
S0008	and i say he he say oh yeah it's someone make a messy joint there you know that the flux come down and rot through and i'm think well that can't have be that guy in august cos no way would flux go through a bite of stainless steel in
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0008	in you know such a short time
S0013	mm
S0008	and you think well it's stainless steel anyway you'd have think yeah it should be impervious to a bite of i mean flux be acid but i mean yeah there's isn't that much acid there and once the acidic properties be use up there's get to you know it's just limit innit
S0013	yeah
S0012	no you you talk about stainless steel i read on the internet that er you should only buy you should only use american or british or european stainless steel right because they don't they buy from china and that doesn't contain the amount of chromium that it's suppose to contain
S0008	oh yeah
S0012	to to call it stainless still so they get little pit mark of rust in them
S0008	right
S0012	because it's do a lot cheaper
S0008	mm yeah i can believe that so i mean if you if you're get a place like british gas buy all their stainless steel from china
S0008	yeah they have these things make in china
S0012	yeah
S0008	which they probably would have do
S0012	which they probably would have do yeah
S0008	yeah but it's but then that's their fault for not specify it properly innit
S0012	yeah that be yeah
S0008	you know if they just specify the stainless steel it probably be stainless on the
S0012	that be yeah that's right
S0008	stainless in china
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's just very susceptible to
S0012	that's right certain type of hazard
S0008	i mean stainless steel you see it's a funny thing it's you can make an infinite variety of stainless steel
S0012	yes you can
S0008	well depend on what proportion of what metal you're add to it
S0012	you use yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	and that be stainless steel be only make by a mistake wasn't it it be a mistake
S0008	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0012	which be you know lot lot of brilliant inventions be make by a mistake aren't they you know people leave something
S0008	well that be on that materials programme wasn't it
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	yeah i've get the book
S0012	have you

S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	where some kid be his mum be shop and he rummage in her handbag and shoot
S0012	oh no he shoot himself didn't he
S0008	shoot himself yeah
S0012	ah
S0008	it's just
S0012	the yankee way of life
S0008	well there be one police chief who say er as far as this state be concern if you want personal protection you know you've get to carry a gun that's what the bloom police chief say
S0012	oh that doesn't that doesn't want make you want to visit it do it
S0008	so they a lot of these state they use to have this law that say if you have a firearm in a public area you've get to carry it openly
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	and they've since pass laws say that you're allow to carry a hide firearm
S0012	oh right
S0008	in a in a public area so it mean that you can women can carry a gun in the bag or a bloke could have a sort of a holster yeah
S0012	holster yeah
S0008	a you know a shoulder holster or a hip holster and so you don't know when you're talk to someone whether they've get a bloom gun on em or not
S0012	that's great innit cos they they invent all gun don't they you have it under your sleeve and they flip down and bump they be call weren't they
S0008	they be yeah see that's the sort of gun you want something that won't kill you
S0012	yeah
S0008	but would do you a bite of damage
S0012	yeah
S0008	but modern gun oh dear
S0012	yeah
S0008	they just wipe you out
S0012	yeah well it's the bullet that'll wipe you out isn't it cos they make these special bullets that just that just implode inside you
S0008	inside there's these like dumb dumb bullets where where erm
S0012	make a bigger hole when they're come out than when they go i
S0008	yeah well they be ban under the geneva convention

S0012	chocolates instead
S0008	well that's right i mean i look at i keep try to clear up various bits and piece in my house
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i look at stuff and er i've live there i think nineteen years right
S0012	you've be there a long while now ain't you
S0008	and er i get stuff which i just put in the corner nineteen years ago and never look it never move since
S0012	that's right yeah so you don't need it do you
S0008	no
S0012	that's the same as us we've get stuff up in the loft well i think both loft we've get the the loft in the dairy as well which be stuff up there from when we come back from when we come from we just stuff em up there never give it another think
S0008	no
S0012	and we keep say we must have a clear out of everything we must chuck stuff away my mum and dad never chuck stuff away my dad never chuck stuff away we have to go out and sort their house out and that finish up most of it in the skip
S0008	yeah well it would do
S0012	and give to er the old er help the age you know all that and and er we finish up with we finish with i've get knives i've get some knives from em
S0008	mm
S0012	but most of the stuff wasn't wasn't worth anything
S0008	well in my loft i have this free insulation put in right
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i don't know how much insulation you get in your loft
S0012	i only get that much three inch
S0008	in my loft i get four by twos
S0012	yeah
S0008	joist which be level on top of that i get that much
S0012	wow
S0008	that's the that's the modern standard four hundred and fifty mil
S0012	be it
S0008	yeah i go up there the other day and er you know i sort of have a look at it trouble be there's so much in there you can't see where the joists be to walk on
S0012	no
S0008	but i mean she's get in her loft she have you know sort of six inch put in and then i keep think i mean her house be so cold she you know she could probably get free loft insulation like another foot put in
S0012	yeah
S0008	but the trouble be she's get so much junk up there
S0012	yeah
S0008	everything she everything she sort of save you know go up the loft and there's box and box of stuff you know and it's can't throw that away that's 's stuff you can't throw that away it's 's stuff you can't throw that away cos that's these people 's stuff cos like when they move they leave a lot of stuff which go up in the loft and she say oh it's good insulation well it ain't good insulation at all
S0012	no it's not
S0008	it don't insulate at all and er and you sort of think well when the hell be we ever gonna get rid of it
S0012	mm
S0008	yes i think the only thing you can do be to hire a skip go on holiday
S0012	have someone take it away for you
S0008	get someone someone in family oh can you come over and get all the stuff out of the loft and chuck it in the skip
S0012	mm
S0008	and then that'd be go whether they collect any of it and take it somewhere or that i don't know but
S0012	well we start clean our loft out didn't we
S0013	we do
S0012	and what do we find up there empty box by the million
S0013	well that's that's why we get the box
S0012	mm
S0013	we be look for the box to take that thing back
S0012	yeah we be look for that box
S0013	no i know
S0012	box that half the things you buy like like a television in the other room in the motorway there keep the box just in case you get to send it back or something
S0008	yeah well i've get a front room for the catalogue box cos
S0013	yeah
S0008	the thing be be that on the very odd occasion which suddenly realise that when she'd post stuff or it cost her a fortune she never get it back
S0012	mm
S0008	but on the odd occasion that she send someone off send something off
S0012	you'll have a box
S0008	you need to have a box for it
S0012	yeah
S0008	and
S0008	no it's alright i'm fine thank and trouble be to find the right size box for something it's very hard innit
S0012	yeah yeah it be
S0008	cos invariably the box be alright that way but not the right that way
S0012	that way yeah
S0008	or the right that way and huge that way
S0012	yeah
S0008	and so i just sort of tend to collect every box i ever get and it's the same with her garage be full of cardboard box but erm i don't know

S0012	yeah that could've happen
S0008	we're now claim a thousand pound compensation
S0012	yeah that could've happen but it didn't she be quite good
S0008	yeah
S0012	but it's likely would happen today
S0008	well that's what you're up against innit
S0012	yeah that probably would've happen
S0008	anyone get hurt anywhere they'd see it as a money make deal
S0012	yeah yeah but what do we have to do these people from the childminders association or whoever they're call come round and say now what you have to do be do a hazard risk assessment
S0008	mm
S0012	so we look around well yeah they could trip over and that
S0008	well this be it they could do anything couldn't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	they could do anything they could climb up anywhere and pull something on top of themselves
S0012	course they could
S0008	anything unless you've get everything nail down
S0012	yeah so we you have to do this hazard a risk hazard risk well we've get a little thing out there a little chest out there which they could climb on and hang off the bar of the stairs that come down you know if you know but any kid could do anything couldn't they
S0008	yeah yeah
S0012	i mean they could push his chair round there and jump up on to the top there and plug the kettle in or something
S0008	yeah
S0012	or pull the
S0008	or fall off again
S0012	or fall off again
S0008	yeah
S0012	i mean they're capable of do anything pick things you know what kid be like the pick everything up they know how to don't they
S0008	but then you know you're get offices right where you're not allow to plug anything into a socket without call the electrician
S0012	why
S0008	maintenance person
S0012	oh crikey
S0008	you know if you want to pull some you know disconnect something from the socket and connect something else you're not allow to do it
S0012	aren't you
S0008	no you have to call call maintenance and
S0012	well there be a in in the days of the unions when when er someone couldn't pick a hammer
S0008	yeah this be not not so much union whatever be it's health and safety
S0012	health and safety yeah but i mean
S0008	because they don't think that people who live in a house full of sockets and plus
S0012	can plug in
S0008	can safely do it when they're work
S0012	oh dear that's terrible innit
S0008	i mean it be absolutely amaze yeah
S0012	that's terrible cos i remember the big there be a huge strike at erm over a sandwich someone have a tea break at the wrong time
S0008	uhu
S0012	or eat a sandwich and he get the bullet and of course everyone come out on strike cos he get the bullet didn't he and er well they use to go on strike all the time really didn't they
S0008	they do well
S0012	i mean they they book didn't they by go on strike so much
S0008	yeah but if condition be okay
S0012	yeah i mean they be work in terrible condition
S0008	they wouldn't have go on strike
S0012	no no i agree
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and this be how all along you know with german factories they don't go on strike
S0012	no they don't you never hear of it no
S0008	because they have representatives on the board of management
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and like you know if they've get anything wrong
S0012	yeah they tell them yeah
S0008	it's not oh we can't do that it'll cost too much it's you know oh we'll do that cos we'll get better productivity
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and for years and years and years german's have better productivity than the british didn't they
S0012	well of course they do yeah and still have
S0008	yeah i'm sure they have
S0012	yeah well i mean the british the british productivity have go up a lot since a a few years ago
S0008	well since the japanese car plant have come into be
S0012	yeah that's it
S0008	you know you know
S0012	toyota and nissan and it's
S0008	and so
S0012	they're all up there in sunderland and
S0008	yeah and so it be like people get the idea that you know that they're not against the workers
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	cos that be a a joint effort
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know and it the more i mean it's even amaze now that you can go in some factories and you see how much handwork be do when you think that could easily be do on a machine you know and then you look at something like you know the peugeot work in france
S0012	yeah
S0008	where there's no one there
S0012	no there isn't
S0008	it's just machine whir away
S0012	yeah
S0008	and everything be chop along
S0012	yeah like there's only ford today isn't there really
S0008	they only make engines
S0012	yeah
S0008	they don't have any cars do they
S0012	they don't make cars do they
S0008	they make engines for every plant in europe though
S0012	yeah and they use to always be on strike
S0008	yeah
S0012	i remember work at erm engineer and er because we be in the same unions then we want parity with ford
S0008	no chance of that
S0012	no chance of that
S0008	cos they get find really good workers didn't they
S0012	they do they do yeah
S0008	and they still go on strike
S0012	yeah and they say er if we don't get parity with ford we'll all come out on strike and mr he he be a self make man start in his shed at the bottom of his garden and then put when they call a skyline factory up up there up road it's all go now
S0008	mm yeah
S0012	and er he er he say right if you're go on strike you can get out you can get out and you can get out and he sack the bloody lot of them who want to go on strike
S0012	and because he didn't recognise the unions there be nothing the unions could do about it be there if they'd have recognise the unions
S0008	well they do want to go on strike didn't they
S0012	every yeah but after that everybody be still scar for their job wasn't they he say i'd rather he say he'd rather close the shop close the whole lot down than than be dictate to by a load of idiots that's what it's worth yeah he be a weird blow weird bloke i go after him for
S0008	but there be a lot of that you know i mean it like you say it wasn't all one way
S0012	no
S0008	i mean there be a load of people in the union's bloody power crazy
S0012	there be yeah yeah
S0008	who you know couldn't negotiate
S0012	that's right
S0008	and if they could i mean you know i mean like this country be always like the rich get all the money and the poor get all the blame innit
S0012	yeah what be it there be a joke on television about that the other day
S0008	have you ever see that film i'm alright jack or it's alright jack
S0012	yes yes
S0008	with peter sellers in it
S0012	that's it yeah yeah
S0008	that be
S0012	well that be typical innit that's
S0008	yeah it's this real snapshot of the time
S0012	that be yeah
S0008	yeah i mean if you get away from like the storyline and
S0012	yeah
S0008	but just like the sort of essence of the film you know like there's that bite with the forklift truck pick this massive like
S0012	oh that's right yeah
S0008	box out and in between there's these four guy go in the car
S0012	the car
S0012	yeah
S0008	what be they do there oh they well they be lay off two years ago and that but they've still get to come in

S0008	mm
S0012	and we do that you know
