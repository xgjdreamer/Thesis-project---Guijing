S0653	you can do it however long you want though it's not like they're gonna trap you forever most people that do the circus love it so much they want to do it forever
S0654	really
S0653	yeah course but then they get injuries or they have children i mean some people do still do it with children
S0655	yeah
S0654	yeah like erm
S0655	children be the heart of the circus
S0654	like enzo

S0654	mm
S0653	in the adventure island thing mm you do for real have circuses which with which have children
S0655	mm
S0653	sit down
S0654	i'm go to get some chocolate

S0653	not gonna get up
S0654	i'm gonna get some chocolate
S0653	no you're not gonna get some chocolate
S0654	why
S0655	it's amaze to think that those people in the circus erm er mm erm imagine to be manage to do exactly what erm you mm could have be able to do
S0653	mm what in the old time you mean
S0655	no i mean
S0653	have you notice you're use your finger there
S0655	yeah
S0653	don't do it
S0654	i
S0653	what do you mean
S0654	mm
S0655	well you could've learn how to do the be in a circus
S0653	mm but i i didn't really know about the aerial hoop until a couple of years ago
S0655	mm do you know the about the trapeze
S0653	yes but i if i er saw see it earlier i would never have think in a million years that i could do something like that so i would never have consider it as an option
S0653	but if i go if i be now if i be at school now i'd be think do you know what i might go and join the circus for a little bite i might do
S0654	but never join it
S0653	i would only do it if if you be with me
