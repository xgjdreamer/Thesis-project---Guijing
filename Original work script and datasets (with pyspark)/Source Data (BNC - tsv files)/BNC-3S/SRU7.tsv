S0588	it's like an old an old tape recorder so
S0613	oh oh that's great isn't it
S0588	you can't get easier than that really
S0613	there's something rather comfort about that isn't it
S0588	it be isn't it
S0613	oh it's go round
S0588	yes
S0613	that mean it's yes record
S0588	press record i'm still in the old school way of do things
S0613	right so the green light mean it's record
S0588	well it's go round so that always use to mean
S0613	yeah
S0588	it's record
S0613	right yeah or some of them yeah the more sophisticate one you have to get a certain colour light on as well didn't you
S0588	oh i don't know
S0613	yeah
S0588	i can't remember but er
S0613	well
S0588	gosh those be the days everything physical none of this digital crap erm yeah stomach enzymes what be we say
S0613	no you be you be say that
S0588	oh it's very interest anyway yeah er that you do have some control over it and i know for fact that well some control over your body there be some control over
S0613	yes
S0588	your body there there definitely be
S0613	in everything that you've read though do your as you get older do your body change
S0588	uhu
S0613	because something i've notice i i've suddenly erm i'm definitely get middle age spread
S0588	well there's reason for that and
S0613	well it's my age i should imagine be one of them
S0588	yeah but there's also some control over that as well depend on and i can't remember i've just read the book on it i can't remember what the thing be that you do but erm that's to do with like sugar level as well
S0613	what there be certain foods you can eat
S0588	yeah there's all that erm but the worst culprits to simplify it the culprits be sugar alcohol glucose erm probably dairy but i don't think dairy's as bad erm cheese be quite bad but er yeah sugar and alcohol
S0613	but that's natural sugar as well you're talk about
S0588	and natural sugar so erm although not nearly as bad but if you be to eat a piece of fruit you've get all the fibre and all the good things as well so that in context be still good
S0613	mm
S0588	but if you also mix it with a lunch that have other things that aren't sweet or you can put it in with a savoury thing as well then it doesn't have the bad blood sugar effect
S0613	right
S0588	erm but i know for a fact and how i know for a fact that it have a bear on one's body what one eat be i get these flabby earlobes i've get flabby earlobe syndrome and erm it get kind of lumpy under my ears when i have lot of sugar it get
S0613	really
S0588	really lumpy yes
S0613	god i've never hear of that
S0588	yeah that's a fatty thing it's a fatty inflammation thing
S0613	well i've get pierce ears though so maybe would
S0588	no
S0613	the same thing happen
S0588	no you've get i you've get different earlobes to me so probably not
S0613	so i wouldn't tend to get the syndrome anyway even if
S0588	no it's not a syndrome
S0613	it it might
S0588	i've just make up the syndrome
S0588	but i just know that i get flabby earlobes and that's to do with sort of inflammation and deposit of crap and all sort
S0613	well i tell what i've notice i've notice i'm get a layer of fat on the back of my neck
S0588	well yes it crop up in many strange place yeah
S0613	which i never use to have i catch sight of myself in a change room mirror you know when
S0588	mm
S0613	you can see the back of yourself and i suddenly think
S0588	and suddenly the back of you
S0613	i never use to look like that
S0588	yeah
S0613	i've just this kind of extra layer of fat round there
S0588	no it it come in really strange place and that's to do with your eat as well because it will kind of store things but if you eat it the right way it won't store things erm
S0613	mm
S0588	so there's a very straightforward er scientific thing you can do in around how you eat but the first thing be glucose and sugar and alcohol it really be
S0613	i've always i've always go before on how i feel rather than how i look
S0588	mm
S0613	so
S0588	look be quite a good barometer though i find
S0613	yeah i mean the fact okay like the an extra layer of fat on the back of my neck er i don't i don't it doesn't i don't feel bad about it other than when i see it
S0588	it doesn't it yeah it yeah
S0613	and then i go oh that's not very nice
S0588	it doesn't hurt i mean get erm thing these things
S0613	oh batwings
S0588	batwings
S0613	yes
S0588	that doesn't hurt it's not painful but it's just bloody what the fuck
S0613	yes
S0613	oh yeah no it's
S0588	because i didn't no i notice that in my thirties that everything be go a little bite
S0613	go south
S0588	well just not as er taut and firm as it be so i start exercise straightaway and it sort it out the only problem be you do have to work you have to keep work hard at it
S0613	yeah
S0588	but that's the only way
S0613	well have you erm
S0588	to keep it at bay
S0613	have you ever read interview with oh god who's this gillian lynne she's a a choreographer but she be a dancer she's now god in er well into her eighties
S0588	uhu
S0613	erm and she's still dance she have this
S0588	yeah
S0613	regime she get up every morning
S0588	yeah
S0613	and she's have two hip replacement operations as well
S0588	mm
S0613	but she still do it all
S0588	mm
S0613	she's absolutely incredible but she say the thing be it get harder every day
S0588	yeah
S0613	it get harder so it require more effort
S0588	well your body have change you i think you have to accept that your body's not the same as it be when you be twenty it start to change in the thirties but it's radically change by the time you're reach sort of over fifties it really have so you have to adapt and and change your your whole everything really
S0613	but it seem to to maintain your the physicality you have when you be younger you have to keep
S0588	work harder
S0613	work harder
S0588	yeah
S0613	and that that just you work harder and harder and harder
S0588	yeah
S0613	as each
S0588	yeah
S0613	each year go by
S0588	but
S0613	which be kind of there must come a point where you get i just
S0588	no
S0613	i can't
S0588	not quite because if you do the right sort of exercise you don't have to exert yourself too much it only take ten minutes a day to keep it all together really
S0613	what be you talk about aerobic exercise or
S0588	yeah yeah or weight be really important cos that kind of make everything come together again but erm resistance a little a little bite of resistance exercise and a tiny bite of aerobic but not whole cos that's actually really age if you do the whole really go for it thing or jog that's really age
S0613	yeah cos everything just bounce about and it
S0588	and it's just like yeah
S0613	and you can feel it tug at your
S0588	yeah no no don't
S0613	your your everything bounce and tug
S0588	don't do it it's
S0613	yeah
S0588	just it's the worst
S0613	yeah
S0588	it's it have to be gentle and no no big er sort of erm bump or anything like that
S0613	no jerky yeah
S0588	no jerky stuff
S0613	that's why erm
S0588	just really gentle
S0613	that's why i love yoga i absolutely adore yoga
S0588	yeah
S0613	because also it it make me feel so because it's all you kind of
S0588	yeah
S0613	go inside yourself and
S0588	well it open up all the energy block energy things and then everything start flow energetically nicely between the body and that's what you ultimately really so that's lovely i don't think though yoga's enough or in itself cos you need just a little bite of sort of resistance and
S0613	mm
S0588	erm er aerobic
S0613	to really make make
S0588	a tiny bite
S0613	well something that's make the muscle work hard so that they're
S0588	because they're lose something they're literally lose some whatever it be they're lose so they become weaker
S0613	yeah
S0588	and that be also the reason why people shrink when they get older as well so muscle mass or bone something or other
S0613	yeah that's right
S0588	density
S0613	yes
S0588	go
S0613	yeah
S0588	less and it's all to do with the hormones and everything erm so that that's change fact that won't you can't change the fact that the body have change but if you erm do certain sort of exercise you can kind of slow down the process
S0613	mm
S0588	and feel better really erm so
S0613	be there any more tea in the pot
S0588	yeah and i'll get some milk
S0613	i'm gonna put the tea in first i i erm
S0588	okay you're a tea first girl
S0613	oh yeah cos then you can you can add the milk till it's the right colour
S0588	yes true
S0613	if you've already put the milk in there's no go back be there
S0588	yeah
S0613	sorry do you want some more or
S0588	yeah i've get plenty
S0613	i'll let you do your own
S0588	do you want to do it yourself
S0613	yeah i'll do it myself yes it's
S0588	yeah
S0613	bite easier
S0588	but oh i'm absolutely certain that we have some control over it but yeah simple things er which i haven't do in the last few days like i say cos i need to do a whole new shop for vegetables but er sugar alcohol gluten they're the worst but you don't have to come off them completely but just cut down
S0613	mm
S0588	right
S0613	no i guess i should have one one last bash at erm before it all fully fall apart
S0588	i don't think it need to fall apart
S0613	it's quite erm it require er a lot of erm headspace to concentrate on it you know
S0588	it do what er to concentrate on not fall apart
S0613	yes
S0588	yes it do it's a whole area of study
S0613	yeah and there's other things
S0588	yeah
S0613	i i rather be do to be
S0588	but those other things you need a body for and i think it's important to give it head space cos those other things be dependent on your body
S0613	yes oh no that be true and it's all link isn't it and with your mind and everything else no you be right really
S0588	so the body be ultimate temple
S0613	i know you be go to say that it's go to be say at some point
S0588	it be go there
S0588	yeah
S0613	my body be a temple
S0588	so it it all come through your body all the creativity so without that and if you get ill and stuff but i dunno i think people be rather passive about it i think there be a lot more that you can do i don't think it's as simple as oh i'm age that's that
S0613	so therefore it's all go to yeah
S0588	yeah it's not it there's it's not as straightforward as that
S0613	yes i've get a sink feel you're probably right and i'm just say that
S0588	well it's easier to but i mean how great to know that you do have some control over it
S0613	well you have a choice if you if you're
S0588	you've get a choice
S0613	if you're prepare to put the time and the energy in
S0588	mm
S0613	you you can
S0588	yeah
S0613	to a certain extent erm
S0588	uhu it be to an extent but you can actually feel better for it you can feel younger and feel better just healthier or whatever it be
S0613	mm
S0588	but i'm only do it because i haven't finish with the music and i i'm such a late starter that by the time i get some money i want to enjoy it i want to still have a body
S0613	yes yeah
S0588	and all that that's
S0613	yeah
S0588	the only reason i'm not prepare to just let it all
S0613	yeah it's difficult
S0588	go yet
S0613	what i'm find difficult be erm be cos my work be so sedentary i can't say that word
S0588	well yeah
S0613	yeah not
S0588	sit
S0613	not move around
S0588	mm
S0613	erm and if if it's go well the writing's go well i actually hours will go and i'll forget to move
S0588	yes
S0613	whereas erm
S0588	yeah you should move you should
S0613	i know
S0588	remember to move
S0613	i know
S0588	just a little break and and a home workout that's all it take
S0613	you erm what do you think about this fashion now for er for work stand up you can get special desks can't you that erm
S0588	i don't know that sound quite
S0613	yeah there be special desks
S0588	interest
S0613	you don't stand the whole time but erm you stand for some of the time and so it's a desk that will convert from a a sit down desk to a
S0588	yeah
S0613	it'll just raise up and you
S0588	yeah i like the sound of that
S0613	you stand for a bite yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	they reckon it's cos we evidently we're not design to actually erm
S0588	no we're not no
S0613	sit down for long periods of time
S0588	yeah
S0613	our back aren't design for it
S0588	oh but i mean
S0613	and our internal organs get all squash and
S0588	bite yes yeah it's er it's not right we're mean to do different things you know a bite of variation
S0613	well i suppose we be actually suppose to be erm active aren't we if we be hunter gatherers we would be active all the time
S0588	mm we'd be do various different things i think er er on a physical level yeah mm
S0613	so erm maybe i need to need like some pedal under my desk and you could
S0588	how's your erm that hormone thing
S0613	hrt
S0588	yeah you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to
S0613	no no cos i no i mean the it's funny
S0588	it's only go down for posterity
S0613	no i be i be just think actually that erm er so i'm on my third month now and it it actually i feel like i've be asleep it's wake me up
S0588	oh that's so interest so you're on actual hormone replacement therapy then
S0613	yes
S0588	the hormone replacement therapy
S0613	yes very low
S0588	gosh
S0613	they'll be the lowest level you can be on cos it's
S0588	because all your symptoms accord to the book i've be read
S0613	mm
S0588	have come up in that book
S0613	yeah
S0588	and and all the emotional thing as well come up as well
S0613	mm
S0588	and i think god that's just exactly what be er explain
S0613	well it's go away
S0588	and er
S0613	now all those symptoms
S0588	yeah
S0613	i don't the hot flush anymore i don't have
S0588	no
S0613	the horrible palpitations
S0588	yeah
S0613	and the kind of panic attack
S0588	this be the panic er reaction yeah
S0613	i'm not so tire anymore
S0588	that's cortisol something like that
S0613	yeah it's cos it's actually be
S0588	the hormones go haywire
S0613	yeah it send a message to to the
S0588	to panic
S0613	pituitary gland
S0588	yeah
S0613	yeah which send message to your brain
S0588	yeah
S0613	and it's it produce adrenalin and so it be
S0588	yeah
S0613	it be all just go completely
S0588	cos the book be say that you can sort of balance it all out anyway
S0613	with with diet
S0588	with diet
S0613	yes people have say that to me
S0588	i mean it's probably the same function that erm you know maybe er a broccoli would do
S0613	yeah
S0588	would do the however you get there it doesn't really matter but erm yeah
S0613	yeah cos i try all the er the remedy you can buy yourself
S0588	yes yeah
S0613	you know like the even primrose oil wasn't it cohosh
S0588	i i think that you have to be very extreme about it to do the erm the vegetable remedy if you're gonna do it you'd have to
S0613	also i should imagine
S0588	really do it
S0613	it would take a lot of trial and error cos you'd have to keep try things wouldn't you to see what make a difference
S0588	well my diet be really extreme when i do the it's like whole thing put it in the bloody nutribullet and it's like oh it taste horrible you know so i'm quite extreme about it so i and i think that you would need to be quite extreme about it
S0613	mm
S0588	no namby pamby oh it taste horrible oh
S0613	yeah
S0588	i'm not have that no none of that just get it down you sort of thing erm
S0613	but no i i feel like i've erm get my sanity back not that i be
S0588	mm
S0613	go completely mad but it's only now i'm kind of i feel like i'm come out of a fog and i'm go
S0588	well it would make you feel like that
S0613	and
S0588	yeah
S0613	and that's also why i'm now look at myself and go mm my body's change hasn't it and i think i wasn't really notice before
S0588	and the thing you can only now look at yourself and go mm my body's change sensibly look at yourself and go like that because you've have the
S0613	yeah
S0588	thing so that's really good
S0613	but i think the er what's what i find really interest be i didn't it's only now that i realise how much it be affect me
S0588	yes
S0613	the whole menopause
S0588	yeah
S0613	thing erm which actually be quite worry cos you think how many i could have go on for years because
S0588	yes
S0613	a lot of people er sort of just dismiss it and go
S0588	that's the way it's yeah
S0613	it's not you know and and you do you i not not that i be suicidal or anything but i've definitely
S0588	well you could get that way
S0613	wasn't wasn't fire on all cylinders
S0588	no
S0613	and that's a real shame and you wonder how many people erm
S0588	just put up with it and
S0613	yeah they just
S0588	yeah
S0613	they cos you sort of
S0588	suffer
S0613	you don't really become aware because i think it creep up on you as well
S0588	uhu
S0613	and it happen gradually
S0588	yeah
S0613	er because i as i say this be on my third month and i'm notice the it wasn't like instant you know within within er two days it's like a felt like a different it's that's be gradual as well it's like my body's have to start to build it up
S0588	yes
S0613	and adjust to it
S0588	mm
S0613	and it's really just be this third month i'm suddenly go yeah this be god this be make such a difference
S0588	what a relief
S0613	erm
S0588	yes
S0613	yeah so
S0588	that's amaze that it's so physical as well that that always astound me that the mind be er so physical and then you can create your whole life through the filter of your brain like you say if you go on for years then you make a life from it
S0613	yeah
S0588	you're create your life through those filter
S0613	well you yeah you structure your yeah
S0588	your decisions everything you do
S0613	yeah
S0588	you might be feel unconfident and so don't do the little that would make trigger the other thing
S0613	mm
S0588	that it's i mean it's unfair as well it's and and people with depression and mental illness and stuff that oh god that's so unfair
S0613	i felt i felt quite erm angry about it actually when i realise because i think this be such a dirty trick
S0588	yes it be isn't it
S0613	and why be it that they do it to women
S0588	yes it be
S0613	you know
S0588	well i mean historically it would seem that yeah
S0613	i say they
S0588	really
S0613	somebody er it's just an accident of nature i suppose
S0588	or god
S0613	yeah but but you know
S0588	god's a bastard
S0613	erm
S0588	but erm
S0613	but you for for a woman particularly if if she's have children you've just you're just get through all that and
S0588	yeah
S0613	and your children be grow up and you think oh i'm get my life back again and then that happen
S0588	well it's no wonder that there's more men who be i know it's change but it's no wonder it's a man's world really
S0613	oh it's so much simpler for men
S0588	yeah
S0613	it really be so much simpler
S0588	i mean how can you go through life with all those emotions and sort of
S0613	well all this stuff you have to handle
S0588	it's just stuff
S0613	all the time yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	it's erm
S0588	so it's really unfair yeah erm
S0613	yeah
S0588	but i then i think i think depression be also really unfair and all that and stuff mental
S0613	yes
S0588	shit
S0613	and that can that can affect men and women i suppose but it yeah and it's i i it's only actually with the erm the menopause thing that i i think for the first time in my life i appreciate what depression must be like not that i think i be deeply depress but
S0588	no but a sense of it
S0613	but that kind of idea of it be a chemical imbalance in your brain
S0588	oh yes
S0613	and it actually be out of your control
S0588	yes
S0613	you kind of go this be crazy why be i
S0588	well
S0613	do this
S0588	it's out of your control and yet there's that kind of terrible thing of that fine line of some of it be in your control and er
S0613	but er if you
S0588	but that's also not fair
S0613	yeah but you get the sort of sense of watch yourself
S0588	mm
S0613	and and i become terribly aware of the stuff the what i be do that that wasn't wasn't healthy or good for for me or those people around me or anything and then and yet still do it it be almost like this sort of lemming mentality be
S0588	yes and
S0613	mm
S0588	it's extra effort to stop do it because you can see what you're do and it it and but with a little help hand you can stop do it like an antidepressant or whatever it be
S0613	yeah i suppose it's yes you
S0588	but erm
S0613	you break the cycle of then
S0588	and then
S0613	then you the yeah the fog lift a bite
S0588	mm
S0613	and you can see things as they really be
S0588	yeah
S0613	and then you can take control again but it
S0588	yeah
S0613	it's when you're in the middle of the er yes
S0588	yeah it be a fog and not see the wood for the tree
S0613	but erm
S0588	but erm interest because it make you think about our mother and she she probably menopausal for years and wouldn't even have
S0613	no the
S0588	say a word
S0613	also at that time it probably wasn't so
S0588	yeah
S0613	recognise it be
S0588	so that's erm have a bear on things
S0613	i mean it's interest to well i talk to to female friends about it and some of them be kind of very staunch like no no i'm not go to take er i'm go to do it naturally i'm you know i i can sort this out erm and as you say everyone's different and perhaps some people can and for a long time
S0588	i think so yeah
S0613	i i but i almost dismiss it in the same way that other people do it's like well it's it's only the menopause
S0588	mm
S0613	erm and it's only now i'm not say i'd recommend oh go you know you know you just just go on it but i i just think i just wonder how many people be not
S0588	yes
S0613	really see things as clearly as they could because they be right in the middle of it
S0588	yeah i mean in a way from my perspective it's always be the case that all those menopausal panic the way you describe it be like my whole life so it's almost like just a sort of all i'm get now be the hot sweat and it's all very similar to what i've put up with for my adult life really from the age of seventeen it all go tits up so erm er it'll be interest er i mean it depend how how far it go and how many physical symptoms you get etcetera and how much in affect you but er yeah
S0613	but you say you're you're manage to keep a lot of things under control with your diet

S0613	and and they've get to collect the dog from the kennel
S0588	gosh
S0613	i know i'm a bite erm
S0588	that's good
S0613	in theory in theory it should be fine but it's the first time we've actually
S0588	that's really good
S0613	do that so
S0588	though cos they can just start be adults
S0613	yeah i mean they both they both can look after themselves but they've never be in sort of in charge of the house as well
S0588	yeah
S0613	and the animals and er
S0588	that's really useful if you can just
S0613	yeah but we have to shut the house up today cos they're not they don't get back from till tomorrow so it be like it's a bite like oh the house be
S0588	yeah
S0613	all shut up
S0588	gosh it must be such a relief when you get them to that stage like that
S0613	it yeah it be erm
S0588	and they're not they haven't prove themselves to be mm i don't know kind of murderers or something
S0613	well yeah i mean if you
S0588	and i would always be worry that
S0613	yeah if you feel like they've actually make it to adulthood you
S0588	yeah that's right
S0613	without any major mishaps you think
S0588	yeah
S0613	but then but then the there's different things to you have to think about because now 's drive
S0588	yes
S0613	and erm
S0588	so
S0613	we have to go out somewhere the other day and he be drive and and he's pick up so many bad habit already and i
S0588	oh
S0613	i'm think god he's gonna have an accident he's go to
S0588	yes
S0613	so you know then so it's all very well be independent but then there's other things you have to start think about
S0588	a whole new set of worry
S0613	yeah
S0588	well i'm glad i'll never have that
S0589	hello
S0613	but you're just worry about mr t instead
S0588	yeah
S0613	i think
S0588	it's probably not as intense as a human
S0613	well no i think you maybe it because i i remember with our dog our first dog before erm
S0613	we have and i remember we have to put in the kennel for some reason and i remember be in flood of tear and be convince that the dog be gonna be really unhappy and
S0588	yeah
S0613	and everything but i i don't get like that now about the dog but it's cos i didn't have anything else to get upset about so i think you
S0588	yeah
S0613	kind of er
S0588	but at least well i don't know i i think i can't even imagine what it must be like worry about children gosh well we make er we make some friends in the
S0613	oh yeah
S0588	the we're hop it's go to take off
S0613	have they have they take it over full time now
S0588	yes yeah

S0588	i suspect that they're go to have children though they're like a couple
S0589	they have a oh you mean the people we've meet
S0588	no the people we make friends with
S0613	don't you put that on first after and then start the white sauce
S0588	no you do the white sauce first
S0589	no you do not
S0588	yes you do
S0589	oh strange symmetry to my day i get almost all the way to station realise i wasn't wear my spectacles and couldn't see anything
S0613	so
S0589	so
S0613	didn't you notice when you be walk along
S0589	no well i use my hear still or kind of okay to cross roads so i hadn't
S0589	realise that i could barely it be a blur so i i have to turn around and come all the way back er and then when i leave work i have a quick drink with my friend my work colleague cos she's off to caribbean for a holiday get all the way to and realise i'd leave my bag in the pub

S0613	oh god
S0589	which be still where it be
S0613	so you're
S0589	that's a neat symmetry isn't it
S0613	yes top and tail your day
S0589	yeah
S0613	with er forgetfulness
S0589	with with track back
S0613	yes so erm do this happen often
S0589	no i don't think it's a sign of alzheimer's
S0589	i think i have erm cos my friend say she didn't think i'd drink that much and i hadn't i have like two pints er enough to forget my bag but i think i just have muscle memory of cos it felt
S0613	yeah
S0589	when i put my coat on it felt like i have
S0613	mm
S0589	and i have my book er which be the only thing in my bag so anyway i didn't feel the strap go across my chest
S0613	yeah
S0589	in in in the tube and i think oh hang on oh damn
S0613	that's such such a pain isn't it
S0589	mm but i haven't forget to wear my spectacles for erm
S0613	but you cos you wear you wear glass all the time
S0589	yeah
S0613	so how can if you
S0589	in the old days i could if i get as far as i get i'd go oh well i'll get by but now no just it's not really
S0613	no
S0589	i wouldn't be able to i'd be a mr magoo
S0613	or a magnify glass
S0589	at work
S0613	to read
S0589	yeah
S0613	things i've i've get to go and make a quick work call
S0588	yeah
S0613	i will return
S0588	okay how be your day oh yes you be just say that you have a forgetful day
S0589	i be just relate it to your sister darling
S0588	yes
S0589	it be almost nabokovian
S0588	oh it be nabokovian be it
S0589	well in a sense because there seem to be some sort of hide mean
S0588	what be nabokovian
S0589	well it's all about things that i read in his biography
S0588	be you look for the er
S0589	i've get these though
S0588	it might be no i don't think if it's in here in here
S0589	it's very sensitive oh say she be happy to be record
S0588	yeah
S0589	so there you go my dear
S0588	well i think we should take this opportunity
S0589	she's away for the next fortnight in the caribbean
S0588	uhu well we've get people in the house who be quite
S0589	turn that on
S0588	people in the house for
S0589	might be too early for that
S0588	why i always do this first
S0589	i wouldn't do that until the pasta be virtually almost cook
S0588	no but you've get to heat out the flour
S0589	cook out the flour
S0588	exactly be there anything else that can go in it apart from onion
S0589	erm
S0588	what about
S0589	let me think
S0588	so it's cheese and pasta
S0589	well spinach would be nice wouldn't it
S0588	mm
S0589	spinach with cheese be
S0588	er we've actually get real spinach
S0589	erm that's the only option my dear
S0588	be that all
S0589	broad bean
S0588	no
S0589	spinach quorn
S0588	no
S0589	quorn mince
S0588	we're lack the erm bacon really aren't we
S0589	sausages would be alright but i think they're still freeze
S0588	with sausages nothing here what's in the bottom there
S0589	so my idea of spinach be the best one
S0588	yeah it be the best one well what do you want shall we put i dunno it would go all greeny wouldn't it
S0589	mm be like the sort of dish we use to have in the old days
S0588	yes
S0589	when we be vegetarian
S0588	i think it we should have something else apart from this carbohydrate fest
S0589	well we're not
S0588	so we're have spinach if we keep it to one hour segment so i'll switch it off after an hour and start another one but we've have a jolly good conversation about
S0589	politics
S0588	about hormone replacement therapy
S0589	oh gosh
S0589	tell me about it
S0613	but not literally
S0588	er no but i think that we should have spinach er do you want to grate some cheese for me
S0589	oh well do you want spinach or grate cheese
S0588	both darling
S0589	well i can't do both can i
S0588	well you can choose to do one and then do the other
S0589	no you do everything
S0588	okay grate me some cheese please the cheese be on the top
S0589	no i just say you do everything no that cheese be suppose to be my lunchtime
S0588	oh sorry darling
S0589	actually no my idea with be that we'd record over a lunch at our
S0588	somewhere quiet
S0589	well
S0588	ish well not if you're
S0589	couldn't couldn't guarantee that city restaurant
S0588	yeah i've transcribe
S0589	worse
S0588	some horrendous ones so i really couldn't sleep last night that be
S0589	yeah you do sleep quite well actually
S0588	no i didn't and so therefore
S0589	i be there too
S0588	i didn't get up till much too late so
S0588	i might have to stay up tonight we've still get the other half of hinterland to watch which i'm very much enjoy the grimness
S0589	forget to watch it last night that
S0588	oh darling do you see what i send you in the email
S0589	no
S0588	there's a house that's sell on
S0589	oh you're like my mum
S0588	on road
S0588	for four hundred thousand pound one of the smaller ones
S0589	fuck hell you're like my mum
S0588	yeah four hundred
S0589	have you ring my mum to say
S0588	thousand
S0589	mind you they have more bedrooms don't they
S0588	what the smaller house
S0589	well i think so like 's house seem more not more spacious but more bedroomy
S0588	no but it mean that this be at least four fifty
S0589	the same price what do you say it go for
S0588	the same price no it's much bigger
S0589	mm
S0588	four hundred thousand
S0589	no that's my point be that it's not more bedroomy but
S0588	i i disagree
S0589	i should ring my mum and tell her
S0588	they'll just say that
S0589	which house be it darling
S0588	no they call that five bedrooms
S0589	yeah they do
S0588	so i suggest we wait till we can sell it for about five and six
S0589	and move to
S0588	six hundred thousand
S0589	where would i work in
S0588	and then we buy with the change we buy a a house in
S0588	and we pay off the mortgage as well with this one and then we rent out this one
S0589	er
S0588	so we keep
S0589	that doesn't work
S0588	keep our investment
S0589	cos we no your logic be we've already sell it
S0588	oh sorry
S0589	to buy the house in
S0588	oh yes
S0589	otherwise it's a brilliant idea
S0588	apart from that it be slightly flaw i think that be rather good
S0589	yeah anyway it mean we're not in
S0588	oh damn it
S0589	not in negative equity so
S0589	it's still good
S0588	but i think i'd like to keep it as a cos it to keep a house in be a very good thing to do
S0589	do you see how much of the recycle i manage to put out
S0588	er yeah it's good
S0589	that be your job do you remember
S0588	yes
S0589	i think you probably wouldn't so i do it
S0588	but then i do the whole house today
S0589	yeah you do everything
S0588	and i oh the sheet be on the line outside
S0589	really
S0588	what shall i do yeah i didn't know where else to put them i mean they're nearly dry actually
S0589	well bring them in cos there's nothing over the bannisters
S0588	okay do it after this cos that as well to try to create the space so i think we've now catch up with our wash
S0589	oh that's impressive
S0588	yeah
S0589	cos normally i do everything i'm not wear shoe though
S0588	do you er put the
S0589	oh do i get a package
S0588	no
S0589	oh i buy these shoelaces
S0588	we could leave them out there what would happen if we leave them out there overnight
S0589	it might rain and that would negate the whole
S0588	no but it wouldn't do any harm and they'd be out of the way
S0589	it would do a little bite of harm
S0588	and if it doesn't rain
S0589	they don't need to be out of the way because the bannister's free for them to go over that
S0588	okay that's still a bite in the way though isn't it
S0589	you go and collect them darling
S0588	i'm use up all 's milk shall we put some
S0589	yeah
S0588	as well i need to stay here until we've do an hour before i take the wash in
S0589	do you contact our new friends at all
S0588	well you you keep say that what do you want me to do
S0589	be friendly
S0588	i i have i've do it
S0589	no you just reciprocate the initial
S0588	well
S0589	friendliness
S0588	well what else can i do
S0589	er
S0588	well you do it if you want
S0589	i'm not go to do it be i i'm not friendly
S0588	but i i don't know what you want
S0589	suggest we meet up
S0588	well okay tell me when you want to meet
S0589	for a drink or do you want that in there
S0588	yeah
S0589	or just bash it mm er the open of
S0588	well
S0589	the oh of the
S0588	okay let's put the pasta on i think
S0589	i'm do this now
S0588	how be we gonna do the spinach put it in here no that's too watery really we need to cook the spinach as well
S0588	shall we put it actually in a dish when it's all do
S0589	yeah
S0588	put it in a big dish then put it in the oven
S0589	do the spinach in a separate dish and then drain it
S0588	mm
S0589	of water and then it can be introduce perhaps to the cheese sauce
S0588	okay could you erm sort out the spinach please
S0589	oh no cos you say
S0589	that i have
S0589	to do
S0588	go on
S0589	the cheese
S0589	the cheese
S0588	you've do it go on
S0589	but then i have end up do everything
S0588	you haven't
S0588	the cheese be okay
S0589	no i've turn it down it's fine
S0588	where's all the salt go okay saucepan
S0589	probably too much actually
S0588	it isn't
S0589	no just play it by sight
S0588	but anyway that's good though isn't it four hundred thousand
S0589	be the kettle on which house be it cos my mum ought to know
S0588	well i'll show you but it hasn't i've not see we never saw what it it would have be on rightmove but we never saw what it go for so it's on erm their house price thing you know where
S0589	like zoopla what go for what
S0588	yeah no more like house in this road go for whatever
S0589	that's what i mean yeah
S0588	yeah
S0589	in fact i think that's exactly what i say
S0588	it's not exactly what you say
S0589	well it pretty much be
S0588	you say pretty much that but i be just establish it er four hundred thousand
S0589	be he come in
S0588	so i think
S0589	not come in
S0588	ours be worth at least four hundred and fifty thousand
S0589	good girl
S0588	yes
S0589	funny type this cos you'll find that i'm often quite right about things and also that you often repeat what i've say moments later as your own idea
S0588	yeah i know that anyway but it's because it be my own idea moments later
S0589	mm
S0588	so it's get a logic
S0589	do you want that in there
S0588	want what in where
S0589	the onion
S0588	yeah
S0589	there you go my dear
S0588	thank you not too much clatter
S0589	flatulence
S0588	not too much clatter
S0589	oh flatter do you hear me
S0588	how's
S0589	come back in in the morning
S0588	no i didn't
S0589	you be fast asleep
S0588	didn't those flower do well i want another set bunch okay then so here's another scenario in that case cos i do get that wrong rather didn't i
S0589	probably
S0588	i say think we've sell it and then we've rent it out
S0589	and then we've also have the money sell it
S0588	and rent it out
S0589	for four hundred half a million
S0588	okay
S0589	and still have the money
S0588	so erm
S0589	well my scenario which i tell about be if i die of stomach cancer rapidly be that you still could be financially able to buy outright dear in or
S0588	well we could buy outright if we sell this place we could buy outright in for three hundred thousand
S0589	so now we're discuss options when neither of us actually die
S0588	when neither of us actually die
S0589	oh okay
S0588	so if we be to sell this place we could pay off the mortgage and
S0588	buy a place shh and buy a place in and have no mortgage
S0589	i don't know why you're so fond of
S0588	cos it's nice
S0589	we've only be there like thrice
S0588	well so and then never be on have i
S0589	no
S0588	erm and then if you inherit 's flat
S0589	's flat
S0588	then we could buy another house in
S0589	oh gosh
S0588	and rent it out and have an income that way
S0589	portfolio
S0588	yeah
S0589	like
S0588	no but the thing to do be get you like off from this kind of nine to five work thing cos it's a bite crap so we have to find a way to not have to do that anymore so we could live somewhere nice and just rent somewhere in as our income and that way we also keep the investment in but that's if move out of the cos i think he would because he'd have to pay the grind rent because we can't pay the grind rent or the service charge and he'd probably think it's a bite cheaper if i move back to cos he's so insecure
S0589	well he'd have almost a million in er
S0588	yeah
S0589	in fact he'd have a million
S0588	yeah so he he could go back to
S0589	he'd be a millionaire
S0588	yeah he could go anywhere and we could meanwhile sell
S0589	or move there
S0588	no we couldn't afford to move there though
S0589	oh
S0588	can't can't pay the erm although could we can we pay no wouldn't be allow there
S0589	oh that that's a deal breaker
S0588	that's that a deal breaker
S0589	mm poor boy have he have his supper
S0588	yes
S0589	yes he have he have his breakfast at three thirty again
S0588	oh he's a bite naughty
S0589	it's worth have two late midnight snack
S0588	yes
S0589	he do no he wake me with such a start that
S0588	you're so shock
S0589	that i
S0588	that you do it
S0589	get up
S0588	yes
S0589	i mean cos i'm wide awake
S0588	he take you unawares
S0589	whereas you probably be able to just roll over and get back to sleep
S0588	right it's time for pasta
S0589	yeah well you probably want me to do that as well which would have mean
S0588	oh would you that would be good
S0589	i think i've do the whole meal it's like that
S0588	no we're do it together
S0589	it's like that folk tale with the where incrementally i've be do a little bite here and there
S0588	there you go
S0589	and it turn out that apart from do the white sauce
S0588	i've do that for you

S0588	erm
S0589	i would suggest it's slightly more leave wing
S0588	i would suggest that people be mainly leave wing
S0589	yeah
S0588	er cos i think people naturally be probably
S0589	younger people be and most of the
S0588	because that's morally more right
S0588	just odd that we have not that in a government
S0589	it's like the awful business of cameron say a bunch of migrants
S0588	yeah exactly
S0589	and it's so so clever because he know it be outrageous
S0588	he know it would appeal
S0589	no it's that he know it be outrageous so it would be newsworthy but within the actual context it's not as outrageous as it sound out of context but er crucially out of the entire parliamentary question time er that would be the soundbite
S0588	yeah
S0589	that's play on the news
S0588	and
S0589	so you never have to hear anything about what jeremy corbyn have to say

S0589	as sort of not particularly
S0588	play that game
