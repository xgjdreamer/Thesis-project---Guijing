S0663	so i remember cos i remember this poster on 's wall but i be just say i've hardly see any quentin tarantino so
S0661	have the box set of do you remember it's the there be the three at the time that be his main film there be reservoir dog which be his first one
S0663	pulp ah yeah be that violent as well
S0661	yeah
S0663	right
S0662	oh yes
S0661	come out in about ninety two ninety one nineteen ninety two
S0663	mm mm
S0662	make a fuss about didn't it that it be a bite violent
S0661	yeah yeah i think at the time i would've be seven
S0662	yeah yeah
S0661	but er
S0663	thank goodness you didn't watch it you didn't watch it do you
S0661	when i be seven
S0661	no
S0663	well i wouldn't've give you permission
S0661	unless you take me
S0663	no i didn't and i wouldn't've give you permission to watch it either
S0661	there be no download back in them days
S0663	no god
S0661	erm then there be pulp fiction
S0663	mm
S0661	about ninety five i think that be and then there be another one call jackie brown as well
S0663	no i don't know jackie brown
S0661	have you see that you'd probably like jackie brown it's less violent erm but it's it's get a lot of like soul music in it which be really good
S0663	oh right oh no i'll have to say i'll have to say to yeah i'll watch jackie brown then because
S0661	mm it's
S0663	well i mean the he say he say pulp fiction's a good story he say it's get that
S0661	it just it's still oh yeah plot
S0663	he say it's get three stories interweave into into the
S0661	yeah yeah pulp fiction's really pulp fiction be my favourite film for a very long time
S0663	yeah mm oh
S0661	quentin tarantino be one of my favourite directors but erm since then he's he's do a film every two or three years and they're always very violent there be there be one erm there be one about the about the nazis erm
S0663	mm
S0661	which be really over the top violence but that's what that's what he do and that's what he's very good at he's break all these record for the most use of fake blood in film and stuff like that and
S0662	oh
S0663	mm
S0661	kill bill that be another one
S0663	oh yeah that be say i should need to watch that as well
S0661	think that's really good and that's it's kind of there's all these homages to like the old erm like bruce lee film
S0663	kung fu they're kung fu though aren't they they're martial arts they're not you know
S0661	and yeah yeah yeah and so there's a girl in that that wear a yellow yellow like jumpsuit like bruce lee use to wear and she have a katana sword and lot of lot of blood
S0662	oh
S0661	it's very good
S0663	well that's the thing i mean although you know it's fake blood it's still quite gory to watch and
S0661	yeah definitely
S0663	unless it's really relevant to the plot and i mean we don't use gun in the uk and i just think do you know what i really don't wanna see people have their head blow off it's really it's it's so so if i'd be at i'd if i don't know no i think i be i just
S0661	well jackie brown be more of a it's still it's more of a heist type film
S0663	right
S0661	there's still bits of violence but it's no it's nowhere near as gory as erm like reservoir dog or er hateful eight
S0663	right but you enjoy the hateful eight well you think it be a good film
S0661	yeah yeah i think it be brilliant
S0663	be
S0661	really like it as well erm she just have this problem stay awake in in dark room late at night
S0661	especially for long film
S0663	cos three hours it be three hours long
S0662	oh
S0661	yeah
S0662	oh that's too
S0663	it's too long
S0661	i usually struggle with film that be long but quentin tarantino's er i'll always watch them they're just
S0663	mm
S0662	well i erm i think a lot of the things you know on on tv that i watch
S0661	my they're my favourites
S0662	be two hours and sometimes i think oh it's even that's too long
S0661	yeah
S0662	remember when when my mother use to babysit for us and we'd come back and we'd say you know and she'd say it's it's too long two hours and i begin to feel the same like two hours be long and but that's not necessarily a film it's just erm how can you say like lewis or erm
S0663	oh an like an episode of a of a series
S0662	yes yes
S0661	yeah
S0662	like john john judge john deed you but you know martin shaw surely
S0661	one
S0663	martin he he use to be the bodie and doyle in the professionals that be a series that be probably nineteen seventies

S0661	yeah
S0662	and
S0661	i think i have i think i've see that
S0662	and then she go out
S0663	go for three different meals
S0662	yeah and they they do the cook and the blokes you know mean they mostly know what they're do erm but there be people on there that don't like mushroom and
S0662	and the girl's say that to the camera mushroom you know and he's in the kitchen and she oh i didn't say i didn't like mushroom and she you know and then they when it come like this pile of mushroom on the side and and she i forget to say you know but er mostly they they they these days you see boys go to uni and they learn to cook don't they more so there be more than they use to do well some of the things they do you know and some of these girls be scream and jump about you know they put like a a pan on and then they shove something on it and it and then it spark all over them they're jump about and they're really silly you know what i mean
S0661	well they pick them ones cos it make good tv doesn't it
S0662	i suppose so i suppose so and then at the end of course for the after the three even they she have to choose which one to go out with on a date where she doesn't have to cook so and then er they're talk
S0663	well nobody have to cook they both they just go out to a restaurant don't they
S0662	they go to erm yes he pick one of the three
S0663	yeah yeah
S0662	and the other two there's a
S0663	well it's either a him or a her that's do the choose isn't it so there's one time it might be a girl that's choose and another time it might be a guy
S0662	yeah that's right yes yeah or sometimes two blokes
S0661	mm
S0662	as well it
S0663	oh right oh so they've have gay couple as well
S0662	oh yeah yeah
S0663	oh well i'm sure they will do to ensure that
S0662	erm and then they go out for a meal to a restaurant you see but you see him knock on the door with a er bunch of flower and the other two have open the thing you know with a thing on the top and and they and it's erm these be these you know what you get from the supermarket that you put in the microwave
S0661	mm
S0662	and sometimes they say oh lovely my favourite they say or they look and they say oh crumb and you see some of them they just stick it into the bin you know
S0662	or you see them put it in the microwave and then they sit eat it and they say well i think he'd've pick me really but never mind erm er good luck to him you know if he pick er
S0662	whoever he pick good luck you know and then you see them have their meal and how they're get on then they talk to them separately and and they say what they think you know
S0661	mm
S0663	cos at the end it just say there's a little thing that come up that say
S0663	they have another date doesn't do it say they have a they or they didn't or they're still not say or they're both still single or whatever they say
S0662	yes yeah well they're go out steady or something like that they say as well

S0661	and er i remember be in the kitchen in that little hut make a meal and you come and eat it
S0663	oh i seem to vague i'm vague vague memories but that must've be a long time ago for me to
S0661	yeah
S0661	cos i remember the old one don't remember the the more recent one
S0663	oh my goodness how strange cos i remember do something be it my brownie or guide cook's badge and i have to go along to somebody's didn't i have to make
S0663	didn't i you shouldn't mention it be be i
S0662	it's a this be a the least least the person that i dislike at church
S0661	oh yeah
S0662	you know the dentist that use to be at the corner of well the original dentist you probably won't remember
S0663	's 's record this mum
S0661	it's alright
S0662	oh no
S0662	i think he'd switch off
S0661	which er be that the dentist we use to go to
S0663	well originally you go there i think didn't you
S0661	yeah yeah long long time ago that
S0662	mm mm
S0663	well didn't you say she'd she'd mellow a little bite and didn't you say she be erm
S0662	oh she's make a right right now
S0662	i'm get not in join in anymore
S0662	i've give up
S0662	i remember when we we live on on road and your dad be record something or other and i be in the kitchen and he be record what i be say and when i hear it back i be appal think it sound not exactly like coronation street but not far off you know
S0662	oh i say switch that off and get rid of it that's
S0661	what be he record that for
S0662	just not for anything particular and i think i be just the fall guy you know
S0661	mm
S0662	say something so hear if it work or whatever
S0663	well i think we all don't sound like we think we sound when
S0662	no i don't know
S0663	we record it so
S0661	no i think it's cos the sound resonate in your in your head
S0662	maybe maybe but i can't tell you while that's record now what i be gonna tell you about
S0663	well you'd have to just make sure you think about it and say it later
S0662	oh that look nice thank you
S0663	well it be actually it's quite it's quite
S0661	mm good
S0662	this card that i'm suppose to be write
S0663	tesco finest so it's er if you like slightly more erm
S0662	i'm get use to tesco i mean i always call tesco but i mean i only go to sainsbury's because i like i prefer park on the flat and not go round that horrible concrete
S0663	well i i think sainsbury's be be quite expensive i go in the other day for some bits and piece and seem to be more expensive than a it normally be anywhere else so
S0662	what be more expensive anything
S0663	sainsbury's
S0662	oh
S0663	mm i mean i like it i like the store and it's a nicer shop experience but
S0661	mm
S0663	everything seem to be more expensive to my mind
S0661	yeah they have more erm like two for two pound and stuff like that rather than just discount the price
S0663	just buy something on their own yeah
S0661	mm tesco's finest steak dinners
S0662	well
S0661	very posh
S0662	lovely
S0663	not really it be just me make an effort because
S0661	push the boat out
S0663	i often buy that two for ten din two for ten pound from mark and spencer's which be really
S0661	that's good that
S0663	it be good have you do that
S0661	mm
S0663	mm and you get a bottle of wine as well
S0661	it's a bite limit what you can have from it
S0663	of course yeah
S0661	because
S0663	well mm
S0661	she she can't have lasagne either so we've not have lasagne for a long time
S0661	although actually i think
S0661	of course cos it's get wheat in it
S0661	i think we've get i think someone i think her grandma give us some gluten free lasagne sheet
S0663	oh
S0661	years ago
S0663	mm
S0661	must've go off by now
S0663	not use them
S0661	actually yeah
S0663	well there's a they do a paella which be nice i've have that a couple of time
S0661	yeah
S0662	what a what
S0663	paella mark and spencer's do this din two for ten pound
S0662	oh yeah
S0663	you can have you get
S0662	but don't you get wine it as well
S0663	yeah a free bottle of wine so you get a main course a side dish
S0662	mm
S0663	a dessert and a bottle of wine for ten quid which be very good value
S0661	mm
S0662	i see them advertise but
S0663	mm they're very good so i've have the paella try to think what else we've have i think there's be a nice lasagne erm
S0661	i think we've have it once actually
S0663	mm
S0661	can't remember what we have
S0663	erm
S0662	but when they they use to do these on this dinner date sometimes you know they're dish it up and there's a plate with so much you know erm pasta oh and it look you just think how could i manage to eat that
S0663	well i suppose if you if you give people too much and they feel oblige to eat it that's you should let people help themselves so if you get a dish in the middle they can serve themselves from you can have a small portion and they well almost and and then they can help have some more what i be say about this lasagne that make back to the
S0663	last saturday
S0663	erm it be cos i be really worry think oh my goodness she didn't say at all be there anything you don't like to eat

S0661	that's what he's on about mm
S0663	at school meals he do some good work
S0661	mm
S0663	erm to try and alter the way that people sort of perceive school meals but it's about have the children choose the right things which be very hard when you're there and it's lunchtime and you're hungry and you fancy the chip
S0661	yeah
S0663	erm
S0661	use to eat a lot pizza and
S0661	use to eat a lot of pizza and chip and garlic bread
S0662	mm very nice that

S0662	oh
S0663	say he use to eat a lot of pizza and garlic bread and what chip
S0661	chip gravy turkey burgers
S0663	mm well that's it and you don't have that choice do you when you
S0661	very unhealthy
S0663	you don't you can't choose for your children you can't say i insist that you have the salad at lunchtime cos they don't want it do they
S0661	unless you give them a pack lunch and don't give them any money
S0663	well we do do that we do you do have pack lunch didn't you for a long time
S0661	mm
S0663	i'm not surprise
S0663	i have a pack lunch and insist the same thing every day and i just sometimes people say oh aren't you healthy and i think yeah but
S0663	here i'm healthy
S0663	cos i've make sure that i only take cottage cheese
S0662	yeah
S0663	my ryvita
S0662	uhu
S0663	my fruit and nut
S0662	well i think you do get into a habit don't you with them and then it quite often
S0662	i use to find that after so long i mean for age and age they use to have ryvita and
S0663	mm
S0662	cheese on it and whatnot and think nothing about it then but when i think now i think god
S0662	how i keep eat that for age but i think i i think i'm a bite like that now with things
S0663	but ryvita have you can now buy ryvita in lot of different format so
S0662	oh yes i suppose so
S0663	it it's more excite than it ever be and i'm just on my quest to buy longley farm cottage cheese cos it's so much nicer than all the supermarket sloppy cottage cheese that they do
S0662	mm
S0663	and if i ever run out and i can't get to a supermarket that have
S0662	do you do without
S0663	longley farm well i i've have a
S0662	would you like to switch that on
S0663	mm
S0662	you know cos forget my
S0662	eventually that's probably when i fall asleep and
S0663	well take i'm not surprise
S0661	mm
S0663	it's tropical temperatures do you just turn it off at at the plug or do you turn it off
S0662	just switch it off on the plug just
S0663	right
S0661	be your radiators okay at the moment they come on at the right time and warm up
S0662	oh yes
S0661	just a bite of a boost be that
S0663	oh have you get a camper van t shirt
S0662	yes
S0663	ooh
S0662	a what t shirt
S0663	oh it's not a camper van it's a vw golf t shirt
S0662	i be gonna say that's a
S0661	oh yeah it's a golf
S0663	oh
S0661	yeah
S0663	isn't that the one that like the mark one
S0661	she do yeah
S0663	so that t shirt be influence by
S0661	i think yeah she might've buy it me can't remember
S0663	well she possibly do it's
S0661	maybe
S0663	and that's the only car i've ever hear her ever ever hear her mention
S0661	but erm think she's go off the idea of a golf now
S0663	okay
S0661	something something a bite more realistic cos i'm probably gonna have to buy a car at some point this year
S0663	be you be yours
S0661	when ours pack in
S0663	oh right
S0661	at the moment it's like get book it in on wednesday again cos it sound like a boy racer car at the moment
S0663	oh no but you've just pay lot of money out haven't you
S0661	it's mm
S0663	oh
S0661	it's a
S0663	be it worth it
S0661	yeah that's a shame
S0663	be it worth it to spend more money
S0661	depend how much it be to get
S0663	well why don't you ring
S0661	cos he's too far away
S0662	what to tell you what
S0663	well no it's because i'd spend money
S0662	yeah
S0663	it be just just before they go to new zealand wasn't it
S0662	mm
S0663	erm and they pay you pay about five hundred pound you know to to get
S0662	oh god that's that's an enormous amount isn't it
S0663	well to get
S0662	you expect that hundred and twenty or something don't you of like you know but
S0661	yeah that be include the mot and service
S0662	yeah
S0663	but but then you be hop it would last you a year weren't you
S0661	yeah
S0663	but it might now
S0662	i to me i don't think it it doesn't seem to be well i mean perhaps a good thing it doesn't seem to push you know like erm
S0663	i know but i think it's probably from a business point of view for it probably doesn't do him
S0662	it sort of say
S0663	he probably doesn't he's lovely he's absolutely lovely and he's be brilliant with you mum and and i i've no complaints at all it's just the fact that
S0662	yes i know that
S0663	you can lose touch with you
S0662	i've never complain about what he's charge or anything cos i'm sure
S0663	oh not at all not at all i just think you just lose touch with him sometimes and i think he he kind of but he would come and he would do it and he usually would pick your car up from your he'd he'd pick it up from home and it's just
S0661	it's too far out far afield for him to come and pick it up
S0663	yeah
S0661	it's too far to for him to come here to drop it off and
S0663	yeah
S0662	yeah yeah so
S0661	i've do it a few time it's just when there's a garage at the end of our road it's just so convenient
S0662	mm
S0663	i know i do you do you think they're okay though
S0661	yeah
S0663	yeah okay fair enough yeah
S0662	you see for the generally speak if i say you you know could you come and look erm he'd sort of push it in at lunchtime you know that sort of thing and which be fair enuogh it doesn't really matter to me at all
S0663	well he's handy cos he live locally isn't he
S0662	yes yes yeah
S0663	and he he's he's be very good hasn't he
S0662	oh yes he have he have
S0663	oh but we get we go to try your car didn't we we get in we get in well we we

S0663	driver's seat
S0662	when we when you move the seat forward this happen every time but i always forget to remind anybody you know they get in it and they put the seat to suit them and then when they finish they forget you know

S0662	with the key
S0663	er with key which so we we undo the door and then mum get in so you be able to get in weren't you

S0663	and then of course it wouldn't start wouldn't turn over cos the battery's dead so
S0662	totally blank on the on the dashboard
S0661	yeah
S0663	erm but then i get in cos we be mess with the handbrake weren't we because you couldn't do the handbrake
S0662	yeah i couldn't even get the but then that happen once at at shop and erm i couldn't get out i be somebody come and park right up against me and when i come back to the car i couldn't get i i i be concern you see and be sort of dither a woman come by and she say be you have trouble she say er would you like me to get it out for you and i just say alright and she get it out and then she get into her car and shoot off and she'd put the handbrake on and i couldn't get it off and so of course i she back me out and there i be block like two or three people this be at and then an elderly couple come and i just shout to the bloke and i just say can you help me and oh yes cos you know because you're old and you're a woman you see they like it and i say i can't get the handbrake off and he say there you be you know like at the petrol station if i have any trouble there the blokes come and they say there you be petal
S0662	and i say thank you

S0661	mm
S0662	they must be terrify of him or else it be their first day or
S0663	think they no they're probably just terrify of the patient and terrify of the whole concept of think about operate on people or whatever they're train to do yeah
S0662	well i should think by by the time oh i don't know i don't know how far along the line they're go remember 's grandson you know he'd be in the theatre hadn't he into his second year be he and oh he be he's enjoy it and he's decide that's what he's go to do surgery

S0662	yeah yeah
S0663	mid
S0662	it be just the
S0663	rush hour traffic

S0661	mm mm
S0663	it's not actually that small but
S0661	mm
S0663	then if you do need quite a lot of motorway drive maybe a little bite bigger
S0662	mm
S0663	might be
S0661	well that's what i think i i that's why i want a either something on along the line of a golf
S0663	yeah
S0661	which well golf be too be too expensive for what they be plus this whole cheat device
S0662	yeah
S0663	yeah
S0662	yeah
S0661	scandal
S0663	yeah
S0661	be a bite off put as
S0662	mm
S0661	as well so maybe a maybe a focus or like a seat leon you know that kind of slightly bigger
S0663	well and have just buy a leon
S0661	body shape have they
S0663	yeah they have cos i be say oh it have the engine of a volkswagen doesn't it cos it do doesn't it
S0661	be the whole the whole thing chassis the all the seat volkswagen and audi be all essentially the same car
S0663	yeah they do they do
S0661	for the sort of from the little hatchbacks to the saloons
S0662	yeah
S0663	cos i be say i be say this to about the volkswagen and then he say yes but he say audi be in that group and he and he cos he have an audi and
S0661	mm
S0663	and it just must mean that at some point if volkswagen have be up to whatever they've be up to
S0662	mm
S0663	erm yeah
S0661	mm
S0663	cheat well it's it's about it's about the emissions isn't it it's about give incorrect adjust the computer to
S0662	yes yes
S0663	say that their emissions be better than
S0662	well i bet they've lose a lot of you know potential customers
S0661	well yeah
S0662	people will go won't they
S0663	well it'll be it'll be very very bad for business very bad for business but
S0662	yes it will
S0663	but volkswagen be such a seek after
S0662	yes yes that's right
S0663	car and everybody love the golf in fact the golf be the number the people's car do you see the jam may
S0661	yeah yeah
S0663	that you see that tell you to
S0662	mm oh really
S0663	to buy a volkswagen golf cos everybody want a volkswagen golf but if you want a gti those be the ones that people want to steal off you so
S0661	yeah
S0663	it's probably not good to have a gti unless you really want to have that engine erm and i like the scirocco if i be just choose a little bite of a sporty type car
S0662	so who make that
S0663	volkswagen
S0662	it's a volkswagen one
S0663	mm and i be
S0662	oh
S0663	tell i be tell because she say she's gonna get herself another car and well they've get this have get the seat leon but she be say that they be talk about a oh no i'm gonna say a erm not a kia what be the skoda and so
S0661	mm
S0663	she be just say she say she say i'm not have she cos they don't really worry that much about well she she say i'm not have a skoda and that because the and they'd have a a skoda and and it be suppose to be a very very good you get more for your money definitely definitely
S0662	well i think it i think skodas be all a joke you know
S0663	well that's what i'm say they're not very cool so i actually say
S0662	yeah
S0663	i say cos i mean 's car be a be a very nice car but what what i'm say be 's just sort of suddenly think right no i be not have an uncool so i say no i say don't have an uncool car so we have a conversation then about what be a fairly cool car to have you see
S0663	so she be think something along the line of a volkswagen but she say they be expensive she we be talk about the polo and the golf and say she say the same thing they're expensive they don't want another seat because they've already get one so she want something
S0662	mm
S0663	and she say that she'd have a scirocco cos i say i don't like the sciroccos i say what about one of those so she say i've have one in the past she say but
S0661	mm
S0663	and
S0662	be they expensive be they high be they high er
S0663	well they'd
S0662	er
S0663	be high insurance group i think and i think that's what because i be when i be look it be kind of i be like mm a little bite well i mean i i probably wouldn't've buy one because it would've be the er expensive insurance and
S0662	but you be talk about the yaris weren't you for quite a while
S0663	well i be because i do like the yaris
S0662	mm
S0663	and the yaris in fact if you if you're look for reliability er honda and toyota
S0661	yeah
S0663	be the most what do i say yeah no sorry honda and nissan but toyota be
S0661	most of most of the japanese sort of you know eastern
S0663	yeah i'd
S0662	but honda be be erm very well know long ago i i remember everybody you know well at that stage they be talk about japanese engines be so so
S0663	reliable
S0662	yes yes
S0661	mm
S0663	well my cousin's get the jazz and but and she like the car but she's now say not that she just she just say i do and i like hers cos it's get the glass it's get the panoramic roof which be lovely however it be more of an older person's car and she's now say she wish she'd get something a little bite more
S0662	modern
S0663	well not not modern cos it be a brand new car but
S0662	oh
S0663	little bite more cool be what i mean try to move back to cool cool now so
S0662	yeah be worry about what miles you get to the gallon and things like that
S0663	well no you do it's all in the mix but then you also want to enjoy drive it
S0662	mm
S0663	you spend a lot of money on it and you also don't necessarily want something that's consider to be very very uncool because
S0662	depend how much money you've get doesn't it
S0663	yes absolutely yeah this be it
S0661	yeah
S0662	what do he say
S0663	he's get you get a reputation to protect which be why i would say
S0662	mm
S0663	i mean ford focus be very erm reliable i would've think
S0662	that's a ford isn't it the focus
S0663	it be ford and 's have one for years and 's have one and you know they they do like theirs very much but i would've say again like the honda jazz it's an older person's car
S0661	a focus
S0663	mm
S0661	you think
S0663	mm
S0662	it probably sound to me like a
S0663	i kinda that's that's that's my image but
S0662	like a like a ford ordinary you know dead dead standard
S0663	nothing not not that not that special
S0662	ordinary car you know not
S0661	mm
S0662	don't worry about what it look you know if it's cool or otherwise the sort of car that people would say be reliable and they could you know drive all over with it and not worry about
S0661	yeah
S0663	well i suppose nobody want to mug you for the key particularly
S0662	no
S0661	well it the new model have they do really sporty ones now and
S0663	do they
S0661	they be on top gear there be this they call it the er
S0663	mm
S0661	the asbo cos it be this bright orange thing
S0663	oh
S0662	what be that
S0661	they top
S0662	they what
S0661	top gear call the the ford focus the asbo
S0662	oh
S0661	you know antisocial behaviour erm
S0662	oh yeah
S0661	cos it be a bite of a a bite of a boy racer car so a bite a bite like the er comparable to like a golf gti or a honda civic type r you know a more of a racier type car
S0663	well i do look at the honda civic and i do like the honda well i i like i like the honda civic have you think about a honda civic
S0661	yeah i like i like it as well erm but then didn't like it but then when i point to one the other day i think she get it confuse with another car
S0663	well i would definitely look at one of those i do go and sit in one
S0661	the problem be the
S0663	the only thing that i find be i didn't i wasn't sure visibility be that great so
S0661	it's get that bar across the back window hasn't it
S0663	yeah
S0661	that's i probably wouldn't like that
S0663	and also there there's to me the bonnet slop off and i couldn't see the front of the car
S0662	yeah
S0663	and that i didn't i didn't particularly like so but i do like the
S0661	mm
S0663	i like the look of the car i think it's a i mean i would just say go and sit in one drive one don't don't don't make a hasty choice go and drive a few cos i think you tend to go
S0661	yeah well
S0663	you tend to go and you find something and you think oh yes this will be okay but
S0662	yeah
S0663	you don't do enough
S0662	yeah
S0663	look about research and test drive
S0661	yeah well i'm just
S0663	cos
S0661	gonna look for something secondhand actually pretty cheap and
S0663	oh definitely well have you er there's
S0661	the only thing i really want be like a dab radio i'm not not like overly bother really about whatever else
S0663	no what about have you look on that
S0661	as long as it's cheap
S0662	that's where erm
S0661	where's that
S0663	yeah er
S0662	and
S0663	and well get hers from there but if you what if you click on cos i think i look at everything i go until i be dizzy look at cars but if you go onto the site i think they still call it erm
S0661	where's
S0663	it's so way
S0661	okay
S0662	yeah and they advertise as well don't they
S0662	like most of them do they advertise
S0663	mm they do
S0662	mm
S0663	and if you can actually click on a car and they the they they'll show they do a little video of it of
S0661	be that where you get yours from
S0663	no no
S0661	no
S0663	i get mine from erm at
S0661	mm
S0663	so that be er that be a nice experience wasn't it that be lovely
S0661	yeah i remember that guy do do the the videos and stuff
S0662	oh yeah
S0663	yes cos i send you and the video didn't i so
S0661	mm mm
S0663	they do they do the he'd make that video himself hadn't he but
S0661	yeah i know
S0663	if you go on the
S0661	well i've not really look around much
S0663	if
S0661	i've only look on auto trader to just to see what kind of thing er
S0662	give you an idea of price range and things
S0661	yeah cos what i'm try
S0662	mm
S0661	what you know the only thing i'm really bother about be have a dab radio so i can listen to 6 music
S0663	yeah
S0661	and like anything else will just be so many streets ahead of what i've get now it doesn't really matter
S0662	mm
S0661	it's not massively you know my car doesn't have air condition
S0662	update the
S0661	or a beepy key fob
S0662	mm
S0661	and those be the probably the three only three things that i'm bother about other than
S0663	yeah
S0661	you know not not get a honda jazz
S0663	but why yeah i know
S0661	or something like that
S0663	er why don't you
S0662	mm
S0663	why don't you well well just have a look and you'll what happen be you find you can look at a say a particular sort of if i if you want a i don't know honda civic particular engine do you want petrol do you want diesel do you want manual do you want automatic do you want erm what size engine do you want and then
S0661	mm
S0663	they will show you everything they've get in that range and you can click on it you think yeah i want a i dunno a red one so you click on and they'll so you pick your car and then what happen be they they've do a video of every car they've get so
S0663	therefore you click on it and and it show you they drive it out and they tell you all about it you see so
S0662	what's that noise
S0661	mm
S0663	it's quite nifty
S0661	i'll have to have a look
S0663	do have a look
S0661	yeah
S0663	and i be quite impress i be and look on what car and read review
S0661	yeah yeah
S0663	because when i be look at mine what i by the time i'd finish as i say i do it till i be dizzy but there's like a little there's a mini forum so i be look on this mini forum that you can buy you can go onto two different ones one be for very old minis like vintage whatever erm and then the other one be for newer sort of versions or whatever so whatever subject you want to discuss i mean i didn't join in i just read other people's write up but if you want to say
S0661	mm
S0663	what about cos at one point i be look at one with a glass roof and i go on to see about what people be say about glass
S0661	yeah
S0663	about panoramic rooves and and somebody have have trouble with it and then i think mm maybe not because if i have trouble it could be a really expensive thing to fix and i also didn't want a cabriolet because i didn't want because again have have trouble with hers and it be very expensive
S0661	what's a cabriolet
S0663	you know the soft top
S0661	oh yeah
S0663	so therefore that be a massively expensive thing and she get it
S0661	yeah
S0663	do for a a a reasonable price but it's still a lot of money
S0662	who be this
S0663	when she have her
S0662	oh right
S0663	yeah so
S0661	i probably wouldn't get much use of it other than a couple of days of sunshine
S0663	well exactly i mean there so there be certain
S0661	oh i've hear that the uk have have the most convertibles per capita in the world or something
S0662	really
S0663	well that's ridiculous
S0661	show show what an optimistic country we have
S0663	isn't it absolutely
S0662	yeah
S0663	absolutely so the what's the point and also you
S0662	just and be american
S0663	you can't you can't wash it
S0663	like you can't you've gotta have your special treatment and stuff for your roof
S0661	yeah
S0663	you can't just wash it like you can wash a normal car so
S0662	no no
S0663	to me that
S0661	mm
S0663	there be lot of negative for that i mean
S0662	mm
S0663	if we suddenly get tropical you know we can think you might consider it but there's no point be there for the number of sunny days that we have these days
S0662	but if you see these program and and these housewives of beverley hill or whatever and sometimes i put that on at teatime and obviously you know they they're all they you know they're all so well off and you you know they drive up to somebody's mansion and they're all the they're all different but they're all the same huge and course as you know americans call the garden the the back yard and you look at the back yard and it's you know acres of beautiful tree and everything and they get out of a they come in a car and or they go visit somebody else's house and they just step out of the car and you know some shadowy figure some bloke's there to remove it and they don't even acknowledge the fact that somebody's open their door or somebody's drive them there at all you know
S0661	no
S0662	they're very erm
S0661	mm
S0662	everything to hand you know
S0661	mm
S0662	and there's another one on now er by the they're look for i've forget what they call it the the upper fixers or something and the the house that've be run down and they go round and there they be and along the side everything they talk about they keep show a if the kitchen's go to be push out you know twenty feet or whatever you know they put a little thing down show what it would look like and then then at the side they keep put the the dollars you know like that's six six and a half thousand dollars for that bite and then fifteen dollars fifteen thousand dollars just to alter that and so on and so forth and
S0661	mm
S0662	you know it's a real er after a while you get sick of it but there they be you know like money's no object whatsoever
S0661	yeah
S0662	you know they think
S0663	the fixer uppers
S0662	that's it what do i say
S0663	upper fixers
S0662	do i
S0662	i think i be think upper class
S0662	oh that's right have you see that
S0663	no i haven't no it be just a cos that's what
S0662	but oh
S0663	that's a term isn't it fixer upper isn't it isn't
S0662	be it i suppose it's
S0663	well it kind of be because it's a
S0662	i suppose yeah yeah
S0663	slang for
S0662	yeah
S0661	mm
S0662	and then they want a mirror and you see six blokes carry a mirror you know to put on that wall and and i really i mean they could obviously it wouldn't suit the rest of them because the people that they mix with they're all the same you know they're all all in the same and really when it's the housewives that be on they're out they're either out for lunch or they're out for a a meal with the husband and everybody else
S0663	well they probably don't i bet they're all dead thin and they don't eat very much a lot of them
S0662	they be dead thin all of them
S0663	cos er all their din out mustn't they mustn't have three course and
S0662	no oh they mustn't
S0663	cos otherwise they would be
S0662	they mustn't
S0663	overweight
S0662	but you know it's all er and the nannies and and then like if they're have a do all you know the two or three chefs there do all little dinky things you know to eat and
S0661	yeah
S0662	all of that and the so on but when they meet together there there's like usually for the whole thing that keep come on there's probably half a dozen of them that be all suppose to be friends and the way they go on about one another and in the end it's i suppose it's good television they're they're fall out you see and then they're say be sonia come and er well i i do invite her but if she come well if she doesn't well i'm well i i won't be come you know and they're backbite like that and that's what they're like
S0663	well yeah but that's air your air your that's just your life in public be it just because people want their fifteen minutes of fame
S0662	i don't know
S0663	i can't understand why would you want to show that to the world unless you just want to show off why would you want people in your home
S0662	i don't know
S0663	with cameras you know
S0662	it's a big ego i suppose
S0663	yeah
S0662	cos there must be thousands of people who would go on it i'm sure
S0663	yeah definitely i suppose they just want to show off people
S0662	mm
S0663	but no
S0662	and then at the end of the series they have a they get together when they sit in this you know like semi circle and work in the middle with all the question that people have contact them you know to ask would you please ask such a body you know why she'd why she do such and such to so and so and why do you fall out with i didn't i never ever say and then there's three on each side of him and they're all have their you know all get work up say and he's try to kind of get onto the next question and say no no no no well well no well she probably didn't mean that you know and now some so and so's ring in and what about such a body what why do he do such and such you know how they can do it and they all they're all dress up you know in all like off the shoulder sort of sort of dress that you don't see many people you know in the middle of the afternoon wear or not like we'd think of as like go to a a ball or something like that but
S0663	they must dress up for the camera
S0662	and they're all blonde and their hair's all down to here
S0663	maybe it's a uniform
S0663	i don't know
S0662	anyway
S0663	oh what's go to london for that be what i be gonna ask you
S0661	she's erm meet the er project team for a festival call er brainchild festival in
S0663	oh what's that all about then

S0661	they're all from london no they all just they hadn't the rest of them be from in and around london so she just want to get involve and they be quite impress that she'd make the
S0662	oh

S0663	i think that's very impressive
S0661	yeah but most of the work can be do
S0663	up here
S0661	while she's up here and she's get her studio space in that college where she can work on whatever thing
S0663	oh yeah yeah that's good that's
S0662	well it's a space that she's get to work in that she she's she's there now anyway like
S0661	yeah she go she's be there for a few weeks now
S0662	oh
S0663	have she be erm able to store what she's work on there as well or can it she doesn't have to bring it home every night
S0661	yeah no but she do
S0663	oh that's good
S0661	drive there so she's can take whatever she need and bring it back or whatever
S0663	if she want well that's good
S0661	yeah
S0663	good so she's quite happy be she
S0661	yeah yeah she's do really well
S0663	good good good
S0662	mm
S0661	apart from the she's work at a er place call
S0663	yes you say they hadn't give her enough hours and
S0661	er be up and down then she's work she work last night erm and friday day so she's get a few hours but she
S0663	oh right
S0661	she want to get something a bite more local and different cos it's
S0662	yes that would be useful wouldn't it mm
S0661	yeah go from college to town and
S0662	yes
S0661	then i mean that'd be easier if she could get into
S0662	mm
S0661	so she be on the lookout for something a bite more convenient
S0663	something more local well that's good because then if she do and she she finish late at night it's easier to get home isn't it
S0661	yeah exactly
S0663	so
S0662	mm
S0663	it you know you you don't worry about sort of have to walk to the train or bus
S0662	mm
S0661	mm
S0663	well the train's quite good isn't it but
S0661	the train's good but they're er late night they're only like once an hour and they don't run very late so last night she finish after the train have finish so
S0663	so she have to get the bus
S0661	yeah
S0663	i mean you be on a quite busy bus route
S0661	but then we don't we're quite far about twenty minute walk to the bus stop
S0663	well that that be be gonna say even though it go through the the road down like road whatever it
S0661	yeah mm
S0663	when she get off she it's it's a bite of a walk at whatever time in the morning isn't it so
S0661	mm yeah
S0662	mm
S0663	that's not so good
S0661	no
S0663	mm
S0661	bite of a pain but usually she cycle but she's have three puncture in less
S0663	oh three oh no
S0661	in about a week well she have she have one and she have to she be late to work and she have to take her bike on the bus and then there be traffic and everything and it be horrible
S0661	and then she get the train home and have repair it and then by the morning the repair just fail so have to put a new inner tube in and then she get another puncture in the new inner tube
S0663	no oh that's so dishearten isn't it when she make such an effort i mean you both
S0661	yeah
S0663	you're both very good at at cycle but even so
S0661	when i take it out it be one of these cheap ones from wilkos so i think maybe that's why cos it'd just it have this like load of little hole along the end in it
S0663	oh
S0661	couldn't even repair it
S0663	oh
S0661	so i order a better quality couple of inner tube off the internet
S0663	right
S0661	today
S0662	oh
S0663	i know but it's so it's dishearten isn't it because i mean that's
S0662	mm
S0663	you're you're cycle to work not just to save money but for health reason as well
S0662	yeah
S0663	but then
S0662	yeah
S0663	you're spend your wag back in inner tube and it kind of it's a bite counterproductive isn't it
S0661	well i have a couple of weeks last year where i must i must've have like nearly ten puncture
S0663	oh
S0661	just i be i be on the verge of give up cycle it be
S0662	really
S0663	oh right
S0662	you know
S0663	i
S0662	yeah
S0661	so annoy
S0663	well i would've do
S0661	i think it be just some shrapnel that be in park that keep go anywhere
S0662	ah
S0661	but it's so it's hard when you're go that far to keep
S0662	mm mm
S0661	you know ground
S0663	well you can't if you your eye on the grind you're not look round you be you
S0663	and and it's really important to be safe so
S0661	but my new bike's a bite a bite better because it's thinner tyres than my mountain bike which have flatter tyres so i think there's less chance of it actually hit something
S0663	mm
S0661	and the tyres be harder which i dunno maybe that make them more resilient or maybe that make them more resilient or maybe that
S0663	be it a road bike do you say
S0661	yeah
S0663	so it's
S0663	yeah okay cos you can get the
S0661	i've be have these erm i'm get this pain in my elbow
S0663	oh that's not that's not
S0661	erm
S0663	the shock of
S0661	i don't know if it's the lack of suspension and i'm not use to take shock on my arm
S0663	mm
S0661	the different seat the hand position go from that to that
S0663	mm
S0661	also lean forward
S0662	mm
S0661	which mean my arm be overstretch and i've get more weight of my backpack on my arm than i would have when i'm sit like that
S0663	mm
S0661	or maybe the bike's too big for me and i'm stretch further than i should be
S0663	mm
S0661	or a combination of all of the above
S0663	oh no so
S0661	so i don't know if i'm get like give myself tennis elbow or
S0663	well i be just gonna say you'll end up with tennis elbow be the one
S0662	i be gonna say tennis elbow mm
S0663	and then you'll end up with support strap unless you put the support strap on when you're cycle but i don't know if that will help
S0661	well it shouldn't it shouldn't happen i just need to fix whatever's go wrong but erm
S0663	so if you're not the suspension on your
S0662	you'll have to keep your eye on it and see
S0663	no
S0661	cos it's a new bike i've get er they they say bring it back in a couple of months and they'll have a look over it just to make sure everything's alright
S0663	mm
S0661	but i think because i've try i've ride i test one bike
S0663	mm
S0661	and wait nearly six months to get it
S0663	oh and they send you another they say it wasn't available
S0661	i know then it's just get yeah so many so many delay they're just like gotta just just give me a different bike so i pick one
S0663	mm
S0661	that be very very similar but make by a different company and they say what what size do you want and it be fifty four centimetres on this one so i'll give you fifty four centimetres on this one i be like yeah sound good didn't test ride it erm but i don't when i test ride it i don't know what i'm should be feel because it's so different and i'm not use to it
S0662	no
S0663	it's different to to
S0662	yes you
S0661	i wouldn't how would i know if it's uncomfortable cos it be uncomfortable because it's different
S0663	yeah
S0662	yeah
S0661	and when i look at the size guide on the internet for the old bike and the new bike
S0663	yeah
S0661	they're both fifty four centimetres so you think they're the same size but
S0662	yeah yeah
S0661	i they're not because the frame be different shape like different geometries
S0663	oh
S0662	oh right
S0661	so one size bike
S0663	be not you don't
S0661	in one brand might be different to another one
S0663	be different
S0661	so the size guide they have these on the internet you can get the size guide for your for your height
S0663	yeah
S0661	you should have be on the size bike
S0662	yeah yeah
S0661	and fifty four be right on the old one but it's not right on the new one
S0663	oh no
S0661	i should be on a smaller bike
S0663	oh no
S0661	accord to that so really i think i've i do a bite of research and people on forums say they'd be mis sell
S0662	yeah
S0661	the right the wrong size bike and they just really it's your responsibility you i should've check it you know if i
S0662	mm
S0661	think it's comfortable i'm the customer and i buy a bike and it's my fault really but when i take it in to for them for them to check it
S0662	yeah
S0661	i'll just ask them and i'll say you know what do you think about my position on the bike cos the size guide it's
S0663	yeah
S0661	yeah five foot seven should be on a fifty two inch fifty two centimetre bike not a fifty four
S0663	mm
S0661	and just ask them you know do you not check or anything or
S0662	yeah
S0661	but i think there might be some options whether you can i i've not actually have chance to look myself yet but maybe just push the seat forward or something or
S0663	mm
S0662	yeah
S0661	move the handlebars up or even replace the drop bar with some flat bar might help
S0662	yeah
S0663	unlike i've do with mine well that i do a very very long time ago cos mine's a race bike and and i have originally it come with drop handlebars but i've just have the standard handlebars put on it because
S0661	mm
S0663	i wouldn't want to have have my head down i want i want to have my head up when i'm cycle so that would be an easy well i don't how easy it be but that be that's that's an option
S0661	yeah the only thing be i think it might be expensive cos i might have to get new brake as well cos i the the brake be special drop handlebar brake like well you probably have the same mm
S0663	mm pff must've do but i kinda can't remember now
S0661	yeah
S0663	so long ago
S0661	just a just a bite of a pain really
S0663	no it be definitely
S0662	yeah
S0663	will you find it easier to
S0661	but no cos i'm not even i'm not even rid it every day
S0662	no you've get to keep your you've get to keep your eye on it haven't you to see how
S0661	well yeah
S0662	how often it happen and how long be you drive before it cycle before it hurt or what you know it
S0661	it doesn't hurt when i'm cycle it's it's kinda when
S0662	er
S0661	it's like i've get my drink bottle that hurt like grip
S0662	yeah
S0663	mm
S0661	so which be a i've read about tennis elbow that's one of the symptoms so
S0663	mm
S0661	and then this this arm's not as bad but well this arm wasn't at all but then it be mostly this one but then since start a bite as well you know it's well i'm not not i'm only rid it like one or two days a week
S0663	mm
S0661	erm
S0663	well somebody at work
S0662	and do you find the other days you're not it doesn't affect you
S0661	no it's well i've can feel it
S0662	it you'd get yeah
S0661	i imagine if it'd be worse if i be rid every day
S0662	mm
S0661	i think next weekend that's take it in and see what they say
S0662	mm
S0663	yeah
S0661	see if they can sort me a deal if they've not sell me the right bike or something like that
S0662	yeah see
S0663	how long have you have the bike
S0661	er get it weekend after we come back in december
S0663	right well
S0661	so it be only about less than a month well bite over a month
S0663	well why don't you see if because somebody i know buy a bike from and take that back and i think cos it's within a period of time that they guarantee this particular cycle place i can't tell you what it's call but
S0661	oh right
S0663	yeah
S0661	yeah i'll erm yeah i'll see what they say
S0663	or or or look up and see what their sort of
S0661	what their policy be
S0662	mm
S0663	policy and
S0661	yeah
S0663	that or whatever cos sometimes it's like anything isn't it it's you know if you've buy a coat that's a bite big it doesn't really matter do it i mean you just think oh silly me or i've lose a bite of weight or whatever it's not the end of the world but if it's affect your health and your joint then
S0662	mm
S0661	mm
S0663	it's really important and it's not a good thing and also if they've get specialist knowledge which they should have
S0662	yeah they know about it
S0661	mm
S0663	they should then know that if you've have a fifty four frame and you you then go into a different model that they suggest or whatever that that they should know that that be not the right one or they should
S0661	mm
S0663	have that background knowledge to be able to say well actually you need to go down a size in that because it's a different frame and it's set up differently or whatever
S0662	mm
S0661	mm
S0662	and you've get to try all over again haven't you to see how it be cos i remember me have tennis elbow
S0663	well i be gonna say i sort of vaguely remember but
S0662	twice
S0663	oh
S0662	and they think it be it be because erm you know you're carry heavy shop they he say
S0663	oh
S0662	use to go on in the car to
S0663	good heavens
S0662	to this particular osteopath who be suppose to be very good
S0663	right
S0662	your daddy use to go as well he get something in his finger or play rugby you know
S0663	right
S0662	and but
S0663	so
S0662	eventually erm i remember on the one occasion me sit on the edge of the like the bed like me sit on the edge and him sit there and he be a big chap erm and he just sort of get hold of my arm and give a great big tug which he didn't sorta say this be gonna hurt or anything
S0662	but it do and and then it be okay
S0663	really
S0661	oh right
S0662	mm and we go to one before that erm in the in and he wasn't particularly nice and he do it and i remember go whilst i be there go into the shop and shop and think well oh they're not really interest cos it hurt and the next day it be still hurt and i ring him up and say and he be quite short with me and he say you be in my my surgery less than twenty four hours ago and er you can't expect it to be totally you carry on and it'll be and it be
S0663	so osteopathy be a
S0662	mm you don't hear much about them now do you
S0663	a good mm you don't hear you don't hear very much but
S0662	it's all physio now isn't it seem to be
S0663	well mostly cos it's kinda recognise isn't it but i don't know be
S0662	mm
S0663	osteopaths not consider
S0662	no anyway eventually have cancer and die
S0663	oh
S0662	i didn't need him again as as it happen i didn't
S0663	oh but i know
S0662	yeah but erm i do remember that i don't know how he'd have perhaps it be through the rugby club that somebody know i don't i don't know
S0663	mm
S0661	mm
S0662	but when something hurt you see it hurt doesn't it

S0661	mm
S0662	as they've get older even
S0663	mm
S0662	i mean such a lot of them say about what they do you know then as it go on you they they come they've give all that up and you know be do fine with whatever else they've do

S0663	because
S0662	mm
S0663	he'd keep his private life private which be fine and you know but it's just it's
S0662	i think they're the wise ones that do
S0663	yeah
S0662	keep out of the limelight
