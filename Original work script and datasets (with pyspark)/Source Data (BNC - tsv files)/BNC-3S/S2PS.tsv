S0075	i have i have a problem with my password on there and
S0150	oh yes
S0075	and i can't really get on it but maybe it's better i don't go on it anyway because er there's certain things on there regard um my son that i might not want to know or
S0150	quite right
S0068	yeah
S0075	or see so i think it's better i don't go on
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah mm
S0075	but it can be use for good or bad can't it
S0068	i i think like anything in life it can be
S0075	it can
S0068	i i'm a bite of an addict
S0075	er i know
S0068	i very rarely go on the internet and i don't check facebook and i i do have a twitter account but i i i i don't i haven't take to twitter so much whether it's cos it's restrict what you put er er it's more like text message but i haven't really take to that but i do use facebook quite avidly
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah
S0075	i think you have to be a lot more careful with what you're actually post on there these days
S0150	yeah
S0075	don't they they're start to be sort of libel case against people
S0068	yeah mm
S0075	and
S0068	absolutely
S0075	especially do you know to do with the you know racist racist angle of things that people be say they think that they they can't actually be you know they're hide from what they're say but very much not be they
S0068	you have to be careful i mean people have lose their job over stuff they've put on facebook
S0075	they have
S0068	you know whether or not that's wrong but you just don't put it on do you
S0075	no no
S0068	you can think it but you don't put it on in black and white
S0075	no
S0068	somebody can say well you say that about
S0075	mm
S0068	your manager and
S0150	yeah if you wouldn't stick it on your noticeboard
S0068	yeah
S0150	in your office why would you stick it on facebook
S0075	yeah that's the test really isn't it
S0150	because you've get less chance of see it if it's stick on a wall in your office
S0068	probably yeah that's right
S0075	that should be the test really
S0150	yeah
S0075	you know if you wouldn't actually do that in person
S0150	stick it on a wall by your desk yeah
S0075	then why would you feel that you could do that
S0150	stick it on facebook
S0075	um but i think sometimes certainly one person i know in particular the he can put it on there it's like a sound board you're kind of get something
S0068	mhm
S0075	out of your system or you're think you're get something out of your system instead of maybe rant and rave you know personally
S0150	mm
S0075	at somebody
S0068	mm
S0075	you're actually put it down on there but think think in a way that it's personal but it's not it's very public
S0068	and it's open to
S0075	it's really public
S0068	anybody who's on your friends list and if you haven't change the privacy settings maybe anyone can go along
S0150	yeah
S0068	some people's profile be just open
S0075	mm
S0068	you know you can click them even if you have absolutely no idea who they be
S0075	mm
S0068	you can click them
S0150	yeah yeah
S0075	mm
S0068	and look up things about them that's not the case with most profile but some people don't put any settings on it and you can just click through
S0075	do do you think it's um sort of people be make aware of it enough to know you know what's go on in term of security settings and things like that or not
S0068	i
S0075	be it people choose not to know some of that sometimes
S0068	i think there be some people who be ignorant of it
S0075	yeah mm
S0068	and just don't know that you can go into privacy settings
S0150	mm
S0068	and change things
S0075	mm
S0068	see who you can view whether it's just your friends whether it's everyone
S0075	mm
S0068	um perhaps who can view different part of your profile um i tend to set all mine just to friends
S0150	mm
S0068	and nobody else but er but
S0075	be be it quite clear that you can do that you know be it
S0068	well
S0075	within the the website kind of thing do they make do they make that quite clear that you can do that
S0068	i i think it's moderately it's clear to an extent but i can sort of see why some people wouldn't
S0075	mm
S0068	if they
S0150	mm
S0068	don't read the small print
S0075	mm
S0150	yeah
S0068	it's not like they're in big block letter you know
S0075	mm
S0068	look at your privacy settings perhaps it could be a bite clearer
S0075	right right
S0068	um it's something i'd look into but not everybody who use it will
S0075	no no
S0068	and er
S0075	do you have an account on um
S0150	i'm not on facebook
S0075	you're not on at all
S0150	no
S0075	and have no desire to
S0150	no i wanna be the last person in the world not on facebook
S0075	you you sorry you want to be the last person in the world
S0150	yes
S0068	yeah yeah that's er that's really good
S0075	right so that's a it's an ambition i suppose isn't it
S0068	mm mm yeah yeah
S0150	i'm on linkedin
S0075	i know you be
S0150	because i get invite from people
S0075	yeah
S0150	that you you meet through work
S0075	mm yeah yeah
S0068	mm yeah
S0150	so i've get the most skeletal profile on
S0068	mm
S0150	there which i think just have my name and my job on it
S0075	right
S0068	yeah
S0075	oh so you
S0150	just yeah
S0075	you be on it in a fashion but
S0150	yeah yeah
S0075	not a very level
S0150	yeah yeah
S0068	yeah
S0075	right right
S0150	i mean i don't have any interest in
S0075	no
S0150	tell people things about myself
S0075	no
S0068	no no i don't think
S0150	i'd rather make up lie
S0075	well you you could have you that that some people you know facebook allow them to do that you know
S0068	well it do it do
S0150	yeah
S0068	i mean
S0075	yeah
S0150	i know it do
S0068	yeah absolutely
S0075	yeah yeah proper
S0068	i mean you know i mean
S0150	and blog that i use for flight of fantasy
S0068	yeah
S0150	although they're roughly base in reality
S0075	yeah yeah
S0150	but that's completely anonymous
S0068	oh right
S0075	right
S0150	yeah just for when you wanna have a little rant a little fifteen minute rant
S0068	it's a
S0150	yeah
S0075	well we all need to do that
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	yeah we all need to do that
S0150	mm
S0075	but i i as i say i think some people do see it as a almost a faceless
S0150	mm
S0075	thing that they just it it
S0068	mm
S0075	they they they sort of um what's the word the they sort of they
S0068	anonymous
S0075	they don't feel yeah
S0150	yeah
S0068	i think that's the right word
S0075	yeah i mean they feel like it's not they're not accountable for it
S0150	mm
S0075	at all
S0075	they feel they don't have to be accountable for it in any way shape or form
S0150	mm
S0068	that's the problem and of course
S0075	but that's change a bite that culture's change that view's change a bite
S0150	yeah
S0075	with um some of these case up this week about some people put racist comment on
S0068	mm
S0075	twitter
S0068	yeah yeah yeah that's er like
S0075	and actually like we you know to
S0075	you can see it as a criminal offence can't you
S0068	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0075	you could end up in jail for it
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	you know
S0068	that's it yeah
S0150	yeah
S0075	whereas previously i think they be a bite more hide from that
S0150	mm
S0075	and they could get away with it more
S0068	yeah
S0075	it couldn't be track the same but
S0068	it's almost see as it's not in the real world i've put it on facebook and
S0075	no
S0068	it's not it's not real either i just it's just on facebook
S0150	yeah
S0075	it's just a virtual world
S0068	yeah i don't i don't you know i'm not bother about that you know nobody's gonna bother about i mean of course they do
S0150	mm
S0068	increasingly they do i mean the university obviously have page on facebook now and i mean at one time i probably wouldn't
S0075	oh it's all it's not just the university
S0068	yeah i probably wouldn't have think that a few years ago
S0150	mm
S0068	and it's really take off
S0075	well lot of businesses
S0068	so it's not
S0150	yeah
S0075	be make money now that way
S0068	yeah
S0075	they advertise that way that's their main
S0150	yeah
S0075	way of them market products
S0150	yeah
S0075	they will do that
S0068	mm
S0075	before they will put any anything else won't they
S0068	they target you with ads on facebook as well
S0150	yeah
S0068	go down the page and sometimes i've click on a not interest in this
S0075	mm
S0068	and
S0150	mm
S0075	when i use to when i use to go on it that even annoy me then
S0068	yeah
S0075	kind of thing
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	but it would get in the way of what i would want to use facebook for
S0068	absolutely yeah yeah
S0075	um because you just get a
S0150	mhm
S0075	wealth of information in one area it's a little bite confuse or complicate
S0068	it can be yeah yeah yeah
S0075	data overload or information overload
S0150	yeah yeah yeah
S0075	i would call it
S0068	mm
S0075	but so facebook in a way be faceless isn't it
S0068	well it it's well
S0075	because
S0068	it can be
S0150	be you diss his
S0075	sorry
S0068	no it's right
S0075	i i be just play devil's advocate here aren't i really but
S0068	it's well it it's i don't know that it be faceless because well i mean obviously you could
S0150	you know the people on it you know your friends
S0068	you know the people i mean
S0075	yeah and
S0068	you can choose not to put a profile picture you can just have a blank
S0075	yeah
S0068	thing you can choose to put
S0075	yeah
S0068	as anne do on her linkedin one
S0150	mm yeah
S0068	a very basic profile in
S0150	mm
S0068	i mean i explain that to one of my friends
S0075	mm
S0068	and he go oh i don't think i'd want to have all that i say really you don't have to you could put a very very
S0150	mm
S0068	basic profile on
S0075	mm mm
S0068	you don't have to put a picture on you don't have to put a lot of personal detail
S0150	yeah
S0068	it could be just very basic but some people choose to um sort of almost like share everything they've do and it can get tedious and also you think why would you want to tell us what you have for tea last
S0075	or what time you clean your teeth
S0068	you know you know it's not
S0150	yeah
S0068	it's not of interest really
S0075	what time you clean your teeth
S0068	i'm go to bed now
S0150	yeah
S0075	what time you put your pyjamas on
S0075	i suppose it's a bite like be on a mobile phone on a bus
S0068	oh
S0075	and tell somebody
S0150	mm
S0075	i'm on the i'm on the bus i have do that recently actually after say that yeah but
S0150	well that's alright if you're mean to be meet them to let them know that you're on your way
S0075	yeah i know yeah yeah
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	but you hear it sometimes and it make you cringe cos it's like
S0150	yeah i'm on the bus
S0075	it feel like for sake of sake kind of thing
S0068	yeah absolutely
S0150	and the thing i notice on the metrolink be the people lie about how close they be
S0068	yeah yeah
S0150	i'm just come into sale now and you think you're not you've just leave st peter's square you lie little
S0075	there might be a reason why they're lie though
S0150	yeah but
S0068	yeah that's right but
S0068	but they
S0150	they will always they're lie about
S0075	right yeah
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah
S0150	they're actually pretend to be ten minutes closer than they be
S0075	you should pick them up on it some time you should say oh
S0068	yeah
S0075	you should say could say we're get off the plane
S0068	yeah
S0075	i suppose it's relate in a way isn't it
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah yeah yeah
S0075	because it's all connect isn't it with er information be just
S0068	mm
S0075	share so much quicker these days
S0150	i have a theory that it's just make everyone shameless
S0075	shameless
S0068	ah
S0075	ah that that's a better word than faceless maybe
S0068	yes
S0075	yeah
S0150	yeah shameless
S0068	shameless yeah
S0150	cos i'm of an age where people keep things a bite private
S0068	yeah
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah yeah that's true
S0075	yeah
S0150	we didn't discuss everything
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah absolutely
S0150	and you didn't
S0068	yeah yeah
S0150	spill all your personal detail
S0075	no well
S0068	yeah yeah yeah
S0150	what you have for tea or
S0068	yeah
S0075	like in general be it sort of or can be see in a way as sort of attention seek as well
S0068	well it it be it be absolutely yeah
S0075	and and we're in like the age of celebrity and everybody want to be that celebrity
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	you know and when andy warhol say everybody'd be famous for fifteen minutes
S0068	fifteen minutes yeah yeah
S0075	or whatever and in your own little way be on that do something tell somebody about that
S0150	someone that you have lamb chop for your tea
S0075	you might feel that
S0150	that's not great claim to fame though
S0075	be be no it isn't but it might feel
S0068	yeah
S0075	like to some people
S0068	yeah
S0075	that oh sort of like people wanna know this
S0068	yeah
S0075	i i feel good about this i feel good about myself because i've tell somebody that
S0068	mm
S0075	i've brush my teeth at half past nine at night or whatever it be
S0068	i mean yeah i i mean
S0075	i dunno
S0068	i read that and i think well you know whyever do you put that on if if i put something on i would hope it's of interest to people i'd say i've be to this concert or i've be
S0150	mm
S0068	on holiday or i've
S0075	well that's a bite different ain't it
S0068	you know i've meet someone today you know a er er it might be a famous person
S0075	yeah
S0068	it might be sort of someone you've not
S0075	yeah
S0068	see for a while
S0075	yeah yeah
S0068	you know i have a great time
S0075	that's a bite different
S0068	i wouldn't say well i have i have a packet of chip
S0075	yeah
S0068	when i go home
S0075	no
S0068	i mean it's just not of interest to anyone
S0075	it's very mundane that
S0068	yeah it's like
S0075	and it's very routine and a little bite bore
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah
S0075	in its own way and why would it be of value to i don't understand why it would be of value to anybody but i think sometimes people can't make the distinction can they
S0150	mhm
S0075	between the two as something like you say not see a friend for age
S0068	yeah
S0075	and meet up with them
S0068	yeah
S0075	be the same to some people as say i brush my teeth at ten o'clock at night
S0068	yeah this be it
S0075	cos they've just put it on facebook
S0150	maybe the people who tweet about brush their teeth just don't clean their teeth very often
S0068	could be it could be
S0075	maybe not well they won't be if they if they if they if they tweet will they
S0150	or if they yeah
S0075	cos they're tweet instead of clean their teeth
S0150	yeah
S0075	about it yeah maybe
S0150	like it's worth comment on
S0068	yeah yeah
S0150	you've gotta worry
S0068	that's right
S0075	because er go back to twitter for a minute be i right in think twitter be a restrict number of word
S0068	a hundred and forty character which
S0075	right
S0068	be sort of
S0075	wouldn't be a good idea for me to go on there then
S0068	but it's like it's more like slightly less than a text message
S0150	mm
S0068	and maybe that's one reason why i've get the account but i haven't really take to it i don't find it as easy to follow
S0075	right
S0068	you put all these little hash tag
S0150	yeah yeah
S0068	all link with people and i just i don't i maybe i've not make the effort but i just don't find it that easy to follow
S0075	cos there be a talk a while ago it might become more popular than facebook and maybe it's already head that way i don't know
S0068	it be stephen fry who popularize it
S0150	yeah
S0075	yeah
S0068	he say i use twitter and everyone suddenly join twitter
S0075	yes yeah he do
S0150	he's a genius
S0068	yeah so
S0150	he's gonna make it interest
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	yeah
S0068	so er
S0075	yeah
S0150	actually if he'd just clean his teeth maybe it be a bite interest
S0068	yeah
S0075	i don't really wanna know when celebrities clean their teeth either to be honest i could still sleep not know that
S0150	yeah
S0075	well i obviously do you know so
S0075	but
S0068	but one one thing i will say though about facebook be i think there be a lot you hear a lot of negative about it i do think there's a lot of positives as well
S0075	yeah there be and we've just focus on the negative really haven't we from
S0068	because um i i mean i've get quite a lot of people on my friends list now some people say oh a lot of these be virtual friends you've never meet them
S0075	mm
S0068	that's true but that might be cos they're from another country
S0075	yes
S0068	but i do
S0150	yeah
S0068	find people who have similar interest
S0075	yes
S0068	to me
S0075	yes
S0068	and i won't bore people about this one of my interest be um i'm keen on tennis and i'm
S0150	no
S0068	a really big fan of roger federer
S0068	and there's a lot of people i find a lot of people on there some of whom i'd class among the people i'd contact most
S0075	mm
S0068	on there
S0075	yeah
S0068	who be also fan and
S0075	mm
S0068	you sort of
S0075	oh yeah yeah well er i think that's a very good thing
S0068	it's quite interest to the game similar to it than um
S0075	a and the other very good thing about it of course um be be the fact that you can find people on there that you really wanna get in touch with
S0068	mm
S0075	either family members or friends
S0150	mm
S0075	that you've lose touch with
S0068	this be true this be true
S0075	and it's so much easier than say it be and you might not have be able to do that at all thirty years ago twenty years ago
S0150	no
S0068	no you'd struggle
S0075	it
S0068	you'd probably send them a card
S0075	it would be very difficult
S0068	it'd take several weeks to get there
S0075	yeah
S0068	if they
S0075	yeah
S0068	live
S0075	but but sometimes
S0068	in a remote place
S0075	you can get this information quite quickly
S0150	mm
S0075	and and you reunite families that way so it it it do
S0075	have a very good effect like that
S0068	yeah
S0075	um i don't know if it's it overall be it more a good effect than a bad effect
S0068	well i i
S0075	would you say or be it
S0068	i would think
S0075	fifty fifty
S0068	i would definitely say so
S0075	mm
S0068	but it's like anything in life
S0075	mm yeah opinions of course be interpretation as well
S0068	yeah it can it can be use in a bad way and um one of my friends i don't think he do leave it but be say i'm leave facebook today because of something someone have do
S0075	i think it's quite hard to leave facebook isn't it
S0150	yeah
S0068	but somebody else point out yeah well that could happen er not just facebook it could happen in the real world
S0150	mm
S0068	you gotta stop use something else cos somebody's use it in a really detrimental way and i don't think he do leave in the end
S0150	no
S0068	but er
S0075	but it make him think
S0068	it make him think
S0075	twice maybe yeah
S0150	yeah
S0068	but that's not unique to facebook
S0075	no it isn't
S0068	or to whatever
S0075	no it isn't
S0150	yeah
S0068	to social network
S0075	but people think more in those virtual term these days don't they so
S0068	they do
S0075	they might not think that that could have happen in another way in a way but it but it could it doesn't have to be a
S0150	yeah
S0075	a facebook thing do it
S0068	in some ways it make it more immediate someone put on
S0075	yeah it do
S0068	facebook they know what friends saw it
S0150	mm
S0068	so it's so it's update
S0150	yeah
S0075	it do it do
S0068	what do that say
S0075	mm
S0150	and things you say to someone in person aren't as aren't as likely to be misconstrue
S0068	no
S0075	i guess not
S0068	no
S0075	i guess not no
S0150	well you'll get e mail at work and you think bloody hell that be blunt
S0068	yeah
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah
S0150	and you think about who send it and think no they didn't mean it like that at all
S0075	they don't mean it like that
S0150	it's just that
S0075	yeah yeah
S0150	thoughtless way of express yourself
S0075	but in in in general though e mail you know texts and things you put on facebook
S0150	mm
S0075	and twitter things like that
S0068	mhm
S0150	mm
S0075	the i think they be more sort of open to interpretation
S0150	yeah
S0068	i think that yeah definitely
S0075	say something to somebody in person
S0068	i mean
S0075	and i don't think they think about it too much
S0150	yeah
S0075	when they do it
S0068	i think an example even myself i consider myself quite diplomatic in how i say it but when um davey jones of the monkees die
S0075	oh yeah
S0150	mm
S0068	recently
S0068	and i be just debate it with one of my friends and one of my friends say oh er it's sad but i don't know who he be i say well he's from the band the monkees
S0075	mm mm
S0068	and she say oh i know the band
S0075	mm mm
S0068	i say well then you know who he be and she sort of take it the wrong way
S0150	yeah yeah yeah
S0068	and i be say like
S0075	oh really
S0068	um i say well i didn't mean any offence by it i say if you know the band he be er he be the lead singer
S0150	mm
S0068	in the band
S0150	yeah
S0068	therefore er you know
S0150	yeah
S0068	and she say oh it's okay
S0150	yeah
S0075	she's take it in a way that you you be think of her
S0150	yeah
S0075	as thick in some way or something
S0068	no i i wasn't a i first think that
S0075	no no be that how she be take it you think or
S0068	i say oh you're too young to know them

S0150	mm
S0075	mm

S0068	it would've come across
S0075	differently
S0150	yeah
S0068	er i send her a message say well like i didn't mean anything by that it you know and she say oh it's fine and just
S0150	yeah
S0068	just me
S0075	you do have to be
S0068	so you can you know it can be open to interpretation
S0075	i think you do have to be a lot more careful when you're texting and e mail i if if you know but whether you actually do that when you do that i don't know or whether you just think mainly you just send it and just hope
S0150	yeah yeah
S0075	for the best
S0150	mhm
S0075	and sometimes when you get a response back it's
S0150	i tell you what i'd never feel offend by anything you'd send i
S0150	although do you wanna renew cos i know you
S0068	yeah yeah
S0068	yeah yeah
S0150	what do it mean
S0075	i be gonna ask you that actually yeah yeah i be gonna ask you that yeah
S0150	what do it mean like that
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah
S0075	no i'm i'm glad that you've not be offend by the few e mail that i've send you
S0075	that that's a relief
S0075	well like yeah i know they're a bite wordy my e mail
S0150	yeah
S0075	generally yeah
S0150	yeah
S0075	you'd probably fall asleep just think about them or look at them but
S0068	yeah yeah
S0075	yeah
S0068	they're methodical
S0075	oh er well i don't know if they be
S0075	it's nice of you to say so but i'm not sure that they be
S0150	texts
S0068	that's a very methodical
S0075	er er texts have get a little bite better since i put punctuation in them
S0150	punctuation's good
S0068	i think it's good
S0075	it's a start
S0150	yeah
S0068	i think so
S0075	yeah it's a start certainly
S0150	mm
S0068	yeah
S0075	but er yeah no um you do you do have to be careful on facebook er i don't know if i will ever properly go back on it
S0068	no
S0075	i don't know
S0068	no i
S0075	i don't miss it do you know what i mean
S0150	yeah
S0075	be we
S0150	be we talk too long
S0075	too loud too funny or
S0068	um yeah yeah i be say er i can't
S0075	mm
S0068	imagine now sort of go off it i i i it's like i wouldn't say
S0068	it wouldn't wouldn't make any i suppose it wouldn't really make any
S0150	mm
S0068	difference but have be on it and i get quite a lot out of it
S0075	mm
S0068	probably spend too much time on it but i can't imagine sort of delete my account or
S0075	isn't it quite hard
S0150	mm
S0075	to delete your account on facebook from what i've hear
S0068	i think you can deactivate it i know um
S0075	be that the same as
S0150	it's like
S0075	delete it though
S0068	it's not
S0150	yeah
S0075	be it
S0150	you can't it's really hard to
S0075	you can't delete it properly can you
S0150	probably not if you
S0068	no
S0075	that's what i've hear and read
S0150	i've get a google blog
S0075	oh right
S0068	mhm
S0150	and it's pretty well impossible to
S0075	right
S0150	to get rid of it
S0068	mm yeah
S0075	that's wrong in a way isn't it
S0068	yeah
S0075	if you want to
S0068	mm
S0150	they can sit there inactive forever
S0075	that's not really
S0150	yeah but you can't
S0075	right
S0150	just go actually you know i'm a bite embarrass i'd like to have remove all that
S0068	remove it altogether
S0150	mm
S0068	yeah
S0075	yeah but the you should be able to well certainly on facebook if you don't wanna be on facebook you should be able to properly delete your account
S0150	yeah
S0075	i don't see why you shouldn't
S0150	yeah
S0075	be allow to delete them
S0150	no i think you just have to
S0068	deactivate it
S0075	but what i know you can't do you can only go so far and you just
S0150	yeah
S0075	deactivate it
S0150	i think what you have to do be just sort of deactivate the person adopt a new identity
S0068	mm
S0150	and move to a new country
S0150	cos that person's stay on facebook forever
S0075	right yeah okay so
S0068	a bite drastic ain't it
S0075	well yeah it's a bite like
S0150	like if you really want to disassociate yourself from it
S0068	yeah yeah
S0150	it's probably gonna be easier to have er
S0075	yeah
S0068	yeah yeah
S0150	cosmetic surgery move abroad
S0075	well yeah
S0150	adopt a new persona
S0068	mm mm
S0075	and some people of course when they move er have a different view that they kind of might change their name on facebook
S0068	yeah
S0075	they won't change the person but they'll change
S0150	mhm
S0075	the name on facebook
S0068	yeah
S0075	and you know they'll
S0150	hm
S0075	then sort of maybe delete somebody and then they might add them back on as a friend or something as be good experience to have
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah have a good experience together
S0075	but but yeah but you can pretty much do anything
S0150	yeah
S0075	on on facebook good and bad
S0150	yeah
S0075	oldham athletic have a facebook page
S0150	yeah
S0075	it's quite difficult to believe but they've
S0068	yeah
S0075	yeah they will
S0150	yeah
S0075	probably get more members than ours
S0068	yeah that's absolutely true
S0150	yeah yeah yeah
S0075	but yeah no it's
S0150	yeah
S0068	yeah so er yeah
S0075	ah
S0068	it er yeah it's funny the thing where they people delete you as a friend you sometimes think oh what have i do to them
S0068	and they'll take you you off as a friend and sometimes it's a mistake
S0075	it's not that they won't even add you back on then the next day
S0068	yeah sometimes it's a mistake
S0068	and um
S0075	yeah
S0068	it's like one of my friends er she take me off and er
S0075	press the wrong button of the mouse
S0068	but i'd definitely not do any and she say oh i'm sorry it be a mistake er you know i'll add add you back
S0068	and i think i'm sure i've not do anything to offend her
S0075	but some people can get very upset by that even though it's
S0150	mm
S0068	she do
S0075	it's an accident
S0068	she do apologize quite profusely she say it be a genuine mistake i didn't mean to and er but it yeah it can it can create er some
S0075	problems or tension
S0068	yeah
S0150	mhm
S0075	or conflict or
S0068	but er but hm yeah it's it's easier to it's easier to sort of misinterpret and you know
S0075	yeah it's so i suppose there's more chance of misinterpretation you know in general with things like facebook around and twitter and your phone and things like that than there ever be
S0150	mhm
S0075	beforehand um
S0068	i think
S0150	yeah
S0068	i think it's so immediate as well and people can respond without really think i say oh i yeah i'll reply to that
S0150	mm
S0075	yeah
S0068	and instead of think well er okay maybe i won't maybe i'll think about it they'll just post
S0150	yeah
