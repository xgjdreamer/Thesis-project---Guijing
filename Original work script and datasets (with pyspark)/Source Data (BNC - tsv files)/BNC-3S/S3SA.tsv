S0422	the bathroom one be stick i think what they do they be try to lock it or something and the lock in now we can't open or close it
S0423	oh it's stick on that slightly open thing
S0422	yeah yeah
S0423	well when you have some money just get somebody in who can do repair on it
S0423	don't say you need a new window ask them if show them what
S0422	wonder if to repair it cos they have to mess about go
S0423	well they'll tell you won't they they'll just tell you just ask them it might just need seal again or something
S0422	mm
S0423	cos it's like a vacuum isn't it between two windows
S0422	i don't know how they're go to clean it though because it probably need clean it's get
S0423	well it would need open up wouldn't it
S0422	yeah
S0423	so they they'd unseal it open it up do what they need to do and seal it again i don't know how they how it work be there a in there or something
S0422	cos she have them do not long ago from the side as well
S0423	well yeah they're look at i like the brown rather than the white as well
S0422	no i would have prefer the but it doesn't matter
S0423	yeah it doesn't matter
S0422	yeah because it's cheaper very cheap
S0423	mm
S0421	that's my window
S0423	yeah most other people have white don't they
S0421	mm with the bonsai that's my bonsai yeah it be ill but it's
S0423	it's look very big for a bonsai
S0421	i know it keep grow it be really small when i get it but it keep get bigger
S0423	you're mean to keep clip it the idea be keep them small and they grow old look
S0421	well it it get erm
S0423	they start look like a tree but it just look like a plant
S0421	well it's a pachira one so they grow it's like a palm tree style
S0423	mm
S0421	do you know what i mean erm so they do they grow really big because it be a tree but erm it be ill so it it's get better now
S0421	and we've chuck
S0423	yeah but normally they grow big but that's the whole point of the art of bonsai that you have to you have to know what you're do as well
S0421	i know but i keep chop the leave but the leave just keep grow big
S0423	it's not just the leave it's the branch
S0421	i don't not no but it's not get branch it's get a trunk
S0422	it's probably just a cheaper one it be only three ninety nine
S0421	no it be a bonsai it's a proper one
S0423	yeah but they have things come off the trunk don't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	like when you you cut back quite low maybe to keep it
S0421	but then i'd cut all the leave off
S0423	yeah but then it stop it eventually then it start get older and
S0421	oh
S0423	you know it i don't know a lot about bonsai you'd have to look it up
S0421	i don't yeah i don't know cos it just
S0423	there be a way of do it properly
S0421	cos it say just keep trim the leave cos it say this one that i've get be quite easy to look after
S0423	oh
S0421	and you know like if you water it wrong or something it can be fix
S0423	but it might be better just let it grow it would be nice if it grow big like
S0421	i know i think i'll just because some people have erm
S0423	those be nice when they grow
S0421	cos some people have erm them you know quite big as a house plant
S0423	mm yeah
S0421	but they do actually grow like into a big tree and i don't want it to grow that big
S0423	no well you then you clip it down when it's get a bite
S0421	yeah yeah i think it would be quite nice big a lot of people have them big
S0423	yeah they're nice big
S0421	but
S0423	popular the big ones yeah
S0421	it's like erm a plait trunk or something they like when it's grow when it's small they're like
S0423	so it's like go round like that
S0421	mm
S0423	oh that'll be good
S0421	like you can see it a bite
S0423	oh yeah yeah you can see it start to do that oh that'll be lovely big but in in the wild they might be like thirty forty foot they might be those gigantic
S0421	they be they be really big so
S0422	yeah
S0423	oh right
S0421	i don't know like it be get bigger and i don't know how to keep it small so i think i might let it get a bite bigger but i don't want it to be kind of
S0423	no well keep trim it as you be
S0421	i don't want it to be
S0422	go to have to bring it out here
S0421	i know i didn't think it would grow out here yeah
S0423	well it would probably die it would die wouldn't it cos you you that's just an indoor one isn't it cos it need to be warm probably
S0421	yeah
S0422	keep in the thingy house
S0421	in the green a massive greenhouse
S0423	i expect we'll head off soon what time be it
S0421	erm fourteen fifty eight
S0423	well we better have cos by the time we get to the shop and stuff there's a recycle place open till eight
S0423	i be just a bite worry that might be close
S0421	yeah
S0423	so even if we arrive late we can erm still
S0421	well it won't take you long to get a present just go in and pick one and get it
S0423	no i know what i'm get for
S0421	yeah right good because i know what you're like in shop
S0423	i don't think i'm go to go to
S0421	you always you always blame it on me
S0423	it be you
S0421	it's not me
S0423	it be you when i go to the supermarket
S0421	you be you be age the other day buy them pizzas
S0423	how do you know
S0421	cos when you ring me and by the
S0423	oh i tell you i be on the way
S0421	yeah
S0423	well i be look for
S0421	and it take you a whole day to like tidy and like get some shop and then like the whole day be go then you yourself admit i don't you know i don't know where the time go it take me such a long time to like do stuff
S0423	you have to remember i start late in the day
S0421	yeah
S0423	because when i'm work till midnight and i go to bed at like two or three in the morning
S0421	yeah and also yeah i can just imagine that you wake up and you're like right i'm go to have my tea and some biscuits go to
S0423	yeah i need at least two cup of tea
S0421	go to watch the tv for a bite and like when you do your iron i can just imagine you iron a shirt then you have a sit down and have another cup of tea or something watch a bite of the tv or do a bite more iron
S0423	have you be spy on me
S0421	and that's why
S0423	that's why it take you a long time so you do things very slowly you have quite a slow pace lifestyle

S0423	yeah
S0421	erm and laurel and hardy yeah on her website with free film on it cos it's get advert so it's it's legal
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	and they just have like some old ones or you know like ones like small budget film or something like not anything new
S0423	yeah
S0421	but they have a laurel and hardy and it be really good
S0423	yeah
S0421	they go to an island and then it be and then people didn't have then they make it like a country and people didn't have to pay tax so everybody be move
S0423	mm
S0421	and it be like really crowd it be funny
S0423	i don't think i've ever see that one
S0421	and then i think they want to like bring back tax or something and the like people like rebel and then
S0423	mm
S0421	be funny yeah it be good i think it be like some kind of robinson crusoe inspire by or something
S0423	yeah i wonder if film be go to be like book you know copyright it must come under the same law mustn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know they're eventually they they can't they're out of copyright
S0421	yeah
S0423	so really like old film have come down in price where the only cost be the the actual package really
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	cos well i guess they make some profit but they don't have to pay anybody the writers and what have you do they
S0421	because yeah i think so i'm not sure
S0423	don't know how it work i don't know how old it be
S0421	yeah i'm not sure how it work
S0423	i don't know how old it have to be it's about be it around a hundred years anyway isn't it
S0421	probably but like cos there's some film and things you can watch on youtube and youtube's quite strict about copyright and stuff
S0423	mm
S0421	so like if it be violate copyright youtube would take it down
S0423	yeah
S0421	but there be some on youtube and you can watch them
S0423	what like old ones
S0421	yeah but i don't know erm i don't know i think there's some cartoon on youtube that i've watch because you can get erm lot of free classics
S0423	book
S0421	yeah because they're out of copyright because you can read them online
S0423	yeah so that's the same with film
S0421	yeah
S0423	somebody would have a site where they're all free you know the ones out of copyright
S0421	there probably be yeah
S0423	although i mean the way people watch film now most of them go to like a lot of people go to illegal websites and download them anyway don't they copyright
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	it's kind of like i suppose with music it have affect music cos so many people do music
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know they can't they they they make very little money out of music sales now pop star i think most of the money be from like concert
S0421	yeah the concert they make the money from yeah
S0423	whereas in the past they use to make most of their money out of record sales
S0421	yeah not enough people sell the yeah not enough people buy their music anymore but erm there be like ways you can listen to new music for free like be it like that thing call spotify
S0423	yeah do you pay a subscription though
S0421	you can either you can have it free with advert
S0423	yeah
S0421	which i think i think be like and you also it's like
S0423	oh right
S0421	you can't you can click on an artist and have all their songs play or an album and have all the songs play but you can't choose like specific songs to play
S0423	yeah so it's quite random yeah
S0421	you know what i mean and you can't you have to listen to them online and if you pay you can er have them on your phone
S0423	you get to choose yeah
S0421	you can listen offline no advert
S0423	yeah
S0421	and erm you can choose a specific song but it
S0423	yeah but you never own it do you you just pay to listen to it yeah
S0421	yeah but but you can listen to it and then they'll pay the person
S0423	yeah they pay royalties
S0421	yeah so i think that's quite good like i don't know like that's quite reasonable i think
S0423	yeah
S0421	so i don't know why people be still like download and then like on youtube you can watch the music video and then they get money from that
S0423	yeah
S0421	not all of them be on but
S0423	i really don't buy a lot of music but i think i'd rather still buy like a cd and same with like film have the dvd and just have it there and you can put it on when you want i guess it's probably an old fashion you kind of get stick in your habit don't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's like really old people who start like to listen to the music on the wind up gramophone
S0421	yeah i kind of want to be that nice be that a good sound or be that a bite
S0423	i've never hear it on a wind up gramophone
S0421	cos i really like the look of them
S0423	obviously record players electric ones
S0421	yeah
S0423	have you never listen to it online
S0421	no
S0423	well have one she's get a record player and record
S0421	cos i cos i like the look of the gramophones
S0421	but i'd want to be buy like beethoven or something i don't like i don't like the pop ones
S0423	mm
S0421	obviously like cos they have pop ones
S0423	but you're think like the old fashion gramophones
S0421	yeah
S0423	from like victorian era
S0421	and put like mozart on cos that's what they play on them
S0423	but the difficulty with that would be i don't know how it work do you have to keep wind it or do you er do you just wind it up a bite
S0421	i think i think you wind it and then once the record's finish i think you i don't know i think you wind it again
S0423	because it may be a thing the right get the right speed on that for the record
S0421	yeah there be yeah yeah
S0423	to get the right sound but you can probably buy a record player with that style of like speaker yeah
S0421	yeah that do it itself because like you when erm you i ever see record in shop they're all like i don't know like fifties and sixties like artists
S0423	mm
S0421	they're never erm like classical yeah
S0421	but
S0423	yeah there be there be a bite of a comeback for vinyl but people who be start to buy it sort of buy more recent stuff
S0421	yeah yeah yeah because new albums come out on vinyl sometimes
S0423	yeah
S0421	but yeah i've never see classical ones because i be think obviously back in when they have the wind up gramophones what would they be play they'd be play classical
S0423	yeah
S0421	so they must exist but i've never see them
S0423	yeah you can probably get but you'd have to really shop around that i think people who be into that have to that they like it you know try to find
S0421	yeah
S0423	the place
S0421	i couldn't be bother i just listen to classic fm
S0423	oh
S0421	and obviously all the erm all the classical stuff's free on youtube online
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	mozart and stuff
S0423	yeah cos it's all out of copyright
S0421	although like you think you'd still have to play the the instrument player
S0423	what do you mean
S0421	cos someone's play that like in modern day aren't they to be record someone's play the piano someone's in the orchestra
S0423	yeah well well oh you mean new release
S0421	yeah cos like well whoever well the record of mozarts i don't know whatever aren't actually mozart be they it would be very poor quality
