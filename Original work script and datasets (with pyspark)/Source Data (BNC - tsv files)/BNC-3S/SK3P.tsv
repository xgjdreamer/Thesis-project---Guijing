S0653	mm a facebook memory pop up today from four years ago so be two and a little bite and we go to see dive at the dive pool in the olympic stadium and do not like the idea of have to be quiet for people dive because you have to be absolutely no talk at all when people be about to dive because it be off the ten metre board so obviously people need to you know divers need to focus and if there's a sudden noise that could really put them off but be well you be hot because the dive i don't know if you remember the build be very hot
S0655	i think you go over and i would have move but i still like you say it
S0653	okay but you weren't there when we be talk about it but erm yeah it be boil hot and absolutely do not want to be in there at all and be very cross and i mean i i have bring sweets and er nut and book and all sort of stuff but you be just furious in and it be so stressful try to get you to be quiet absolutely you just didn't want to be quiet and i be say to erm the thing that she do like be the toilets because they have little tiny toilets for for small people and small sink so that's all she want to do be to go and hang out in the toilet so she keep say i think i need to go to the toilet i need a wee i need a wee and i be like do you again yes i do and she would have this evil glint in her eye but we should have just stay out outside there because it wasn't as hot there and it be actually quite a warm day unlike today which be freeze but erm yes you be not happy
