S0018	who organise it
S0004	it's call park run dot org
S0146	oh okay
S0018	which park be it in
S0004	cannon hill

S0004	yes
S0146	yeah her
S0004	well i'm still open to that
S0018	be you a thespian
S0004	i often claim it to be my alternative career if i ever pursue it
S0018	really
S0146	be fine i'm just look for where be
S0018	where do you say it be
S0146	it's um it's actually
S0018	but what area be that in
S0146	so that's um call like also spark break
S0018	oh okay and now you're go climb as well
S0004	yeah
S0018	where's that
S0004	em creation in
S0018	oh the same one you go to the other day
S0004	mm so do the legs this morning do a bite of legs and arm this afternoon
S0018	sound like fun
S0004	yeah it's eh i'll be shake again i expect it's quite scary when you're lead climb when you don't have a rope tie onto you
S0018	you don't have a safety
S0004	you do but as you go up you clip your rope on
S0018	okay
S0004	and then every so often you clip on again it's like every two metres or every metre and a half two metres but um if you fall when you're closest to clip on then potentially you could fall like two two time two four metres ish which be enough to kind of
S0018	be there safety mat
S0004	em well no not the big climb wall because you're tie on so you'd never fall to the grind you'd just go boof
S0018	oh okay
S0004	you'd swing and drop but then when you do bouldering they have like crash mat underneath so that's perfectly safe
S0018	mm mm you're go with
S0004	no he's in london
S0018	be he
S0146	be he
S0004	yeah
S0018	what's he do there
S0004	eh meet some of 's friends and some of his friends apparently and then they're come back later on
S0018	be his girlfriend the one we meet the other day
S0004	well yeah if he's call her his girlfriend yeah i don't think he be
S0146	boyfriend
S0004	if he's call her his boyfriend yeah i make the mistake last night of mention that um people claim we be have a bromance
S0004	so she use that on me like for the rest of the night
S0018	more than flatmates you two be quite good buddies as well aren't you
S0004	well we're kind of like into the similar things
S0018	mm
S0004	chase women climb up wall go run go cycle and in engineer so
S0018	all at the same time
S0004	yeah that would proper be properly ambidextrous
S0018	what kind of engineer do he do
S0004	manufacture although he's like a quality improvement engineer so he take a process and then see how it can be improve
S0018	ah okay
S0004	they use a lot of japanese theory like lean manufacture so you don't have you don't keep a lot of stock and it's all like move the products efficiently and like remove bottle neck through a process and make sure that you cut down on operational cost and include like the thoughts of people
S0018	okay
S0004	and just improve the work environment
S0018	but i mean okay i'm a total non expert but to me that doesn't sound like anything to do with engineer isn't engineer like
S0004	you have a quality engineer
S0018	build
S0004	i mean the definition of engineer be like apply physics to its apply physics to the real world
S0018	ah
S0004	so you make things happen
S0018	i think it be all about engines innit
S0004	engineer itself be not all about engines
S0018	so there's a lot of different field of engineer
S0004	well i'm in energy he's in manufacture transport pharmaceutical biomechanical engineer
S0018	oh right
S0004	it's a broad remit there's like load of different institutions you've get the imeche the icheme institute of civil engineer there's all sort of different
S0018	be civil engineer like build structure
S0004	build and structure yeah so underground work and above grind work
S0018	and what do you specialise in
S0004	i do mechanical engineer of which half of it be painful and useless
S0018	so what's mechanical engineer it that about engines
S0004	em it's about it's not about electricity cos that's electrical engineer it's not about computers it's not about build so it's basically yeah car engines pump um try to think what else there's a lot of thermodynamics which be so you've get like a fluid like water be use a lot in a power station for example to transmit energy and make electricity so there's a lot of mechanical engineer involve in that
S0018	mm
S0004	and the things that carry the water and what not
S0018	mm
S0004	very intrigue
S0018	and do you use do you do a master in that
S0004	yeah
S0018	and do you use what you learn in your job
S0004	em i use like some of the business bits i use the kind of the process and logic i don't use the bits about computational fluid dynamics and internal combustion engines cos i just don't do that but i use a bite of the stuff that i do on power engineer and
S0018	mm
S0004	it's very rare that you do a course and you use like a hundred percent of it in your career
S0018	yeah true true what do you study in
S0146	where at university
S0018	yeah
S0146	modern history and politics and then my postgrad be in broadcast journalism
S0018	where do you do that
S0018	mm
S0004	do you i don't know that
S0146	it be for history and politics and then for a year
S0018	there's a cat in the garden hello puss cat
S0004	it's a fat cat isn't it oh no it's a big cat see any more fox
S0018	no
S0146	the five live be say one day this lady last week this lady um saw a fox in her garden which be four foot
S0004	didn't you hear about the record we talk about this
S0018	mm
S0004	the biggest ever fox catch in scotland it be like the size of eh saint bernard apparently it be huge
S0146	oh god
S0018	but there's one that run around my parent road at night and i've see it quite often and it's cos i look at when i see it i see it from above it's a sturdy thing it's like the shoulder be really broad
S0146	that's how those um fox maul that um
S0004	baby
S0146	yeah
S0018	where be that
S0004	it be last year sometime they have leave the patio window open and this fox just just go in and i don't know what happen it
S0146	it maul the baby
S0004	either it be corner or what but yeah it end up yeah paw this baby and i never hear what happen i assume it be okay the baby but
S0146	yeah and the toddler as well it just go for them
S0018	both of them
S0146	yeah
S0018	do it kill them
S0004	no
S0146	but the baby in particular be quite injure
S0018	oh dear
S0146	i don't like this the last time we have this on i say lot of incriminate stuff
S0004	what about you mean bad stories
S0018	so be you now go to reveal that it be in fact you disguise as a fox
S0146	about like eh gym memberships and things
S0004	slag them off
S0146	no about the utilise them
S0004	what that you're not utilize them
S0146	over utilize past the expiry date
S0004	ooh well if you've get an opportunity exploit it
S0004	what so you haven't pay your membership fee but you're still able to use it
S0146	so i'll repeat it
S0146	so when i go to um the yoga class 's yoga class remember i use to go on friday mornings
S0004	mm
S0146	so i pay for about five i pay about fifty quid basically and eh something like that and i have like a set number of class so she say look you don't have to join the gym just come to this class whatever fine eh but when that when that finish like cos they never check they never ask so i just keep go with it the card and i use you know i use to go all the time i use to go every week
S0004	well your conscience
S0146	well the way i look at it it be that you know it's really you know people always join the gym in january and then by march they stop go whereas this be an incentive to keep go isn't it
S0146	actually as long as i'm exercise
S0018	just not pay yeah
S0146	as long as i'm be you know healthy
S0018	you're probably sweat more cos you're worry about get catch
S0146	yeah nervous nervous energy
S0004	so you're a lady of leisure this afternoon
S0018	yes seem so i'm do quite a lot of work tomorrow so i think today just
S0004	you've get sunday lunch
S0018	yeah but i have to do stuff around it i've get a meet in the morning at eleven and then a meet back here in at four thirty and lunch in between
S0146	do you get the number thirty seven to solihull then
S0018	yeah i catch the one get on the one just outside here and change at the roundabout at onto the thirty seven yeah but when i've pass my drive test
S0146	have you have another lesson
S0018	no i've get one on monday and one on tuesday
S0146	you're go for it aren't you
S0018	vrmmm
S0004	well it's a good use of time once you've get it
S0018	exactly
S0146	have you pass your theory test
S0018	no i think i'd i'd
S0146	get with the drive first to
S0018	yeah
S0146	to get a feel for it yeah
S0018	definitely
S0004	as long as you're studious it's really not that hard to pass the theory test
S0018	no
S0146	i've get the dvd and all of that kind stuff so
S0018	oh have you
S0004	but the most up to date like version of the theory test
S0146	yeah and on your smartphone you can get um eh an app
S0018	mm hm
S0146	to keep and it's really good and you just keep test yourself
S0018	that's good
S0146	like when you've get like a spare ten minutes on the bus or something just do a twenty five question you know
S0018	mm hm
S0146	just knock them off multiple choice question and it keep it fresh
S0018	that's a good idea talk of apps on phone and stuff i've just i have when i get my smartphone they say that i have to set up a google mail account
S0004	mm
S0018	and i be like arghhhh i don't want to
S0146	you don't have to really
S0018	i've already get hotmail and yahoo mail
S0004	who say you have to set up a google mail account
S0018	the guy at carphone warehouse
S0004	for what reason
S0018	em that's what i didn't really understand i think he say to get the apps on the market place android market place
S0004	oh yeah cos android be the google platform for the samsung phone
S0018	really
S0004	and what smartphone have you get
S0018	samsung
S0004	similar to
S0018	i don't know it doesn't look like
S0004	he's get the galaxy so it's like kind of that size but thinner
S0018	okay i've get a galaxy but i imagine mine be the bottom of range and his be probably a bite more sophisticate but no anyway this morning i just think i don't like because it be always open gmail on my phone
S0146	yeah
S0018	in in in light of the privacy scandals that have be go on
S0004	it be always open on your phone
S0146	yeah
S0018	yeah i can't
S0146	you can't put it off
S0018	there's no way of sign out as though whatever you connect to on the internet i imagine that they will be feed information about that store it in some little database about my preference be so that they can target me with advertise
S0146	i've get to i've get it open on mine
S0004	i can sign out on my phone on my gmail account
S0018	really
S0004	yeah
S0018	there be no option all the the only options be to go see the inbox and to add another account another email account to it
S0004	mm strange
S0018	so in the end i go on the internet and delete my account which wasn't obvious how to do i have to do a search to find out how to delete that account and i'm just wonder now if i'm actually go to get any repercussions from it if i can get apps and stuff without
S0146	i'm just look
S0018	i don't know if you can
S0004	actually i can't see a sign out option on my phone
S0018	exactly it's only on the web
S0004	yeah
S0146	do you know how
S0018	and hide at that
S0146	do you know how to set up you know to receive picture message
S0004	can you not receive picture message
S0146	i have to go and log on to o two
S0018	be that mms
S0146	yeah
S0018	have you not get just an option like when you like to attach something to your actually yesterday you know when i be send you the link i be have a right palaver because you know you've get your iphone and your other phone
S0146	yeah yeah
S0018	can you check your internet on the other phone
S0146	yeah they're both iphones oh you mean the other the little one
S0018	the two number that you've get
S0146	yeah so that be for the other iphone but i be gonna cancel that because i i just want to wait a month because i use this phone a lot while i be in valencia and if i can get away with it with this bill then i'm go to cancel the other phone because then i've get everything on this one here but if i need to
S0004	but then you just
S0146	keep a private phone then i'll have to kind of keep that go
S0004	i don't like the idea of use my work phone for all my own business as well i just prefer to like separate it
S0018	be that a work phone then mm
S0146	i do separate it but if there's no point carry around two iphones so
S0018	true
S0146	need to get a better case for this yeah do you know how to get mms message from your settings
S0004	em so do it say you need to log onto o two there should be kind of like if there's a link to log onto you just do that and then it'll have some options and tick preferences or whatever or your phone for the
S0018	but isn't that something quite basic i don't understand why such basic things
S0146	yeah
S0004	i mean i've get picture message on my
S0018	mm
S0004	account so i've never have any problem with it
S0018	how weird ah so if i cos i've get unlimited texts and i imagine those be sms
S0004	they usually do like four to one for picture message so four texts be equivalent of one picture message
S0018	really but do that kind of insinuate that if i send an mms i'll have to pay for it because i've get unlimited free text message
S0004	you you just have to check some it sometimes you have to pay additional and sometimes it's like four texts equal one picture message
S0018	cos i'm sure it's too good to be true this whole deal i've get fifty i pay fifteen pound a month i've get unlimited texts about an hour of free call and i don't know how many
S0004	just an hour
S0018	yeah cos i don't i don't like speak on the phone that much i prefer send text message em and again the other night i be try to reply to who send me a text message and the screen go blank cos it cut out after about five second of not touch it and then i be like oh come on come back screen come back and i press call him by mistake so all he could hear be go oh how how do turn this off how do i get it off and he be like hello hello yes it do take me half an hour to work out how to switch my smartphone on
S0004	the irony of that the irony of that smartphone system
S0146	be also addict to hot yoga too she's gonna
S0004	be she go
S0146	get some class too she go to two with me no she go to one with me she go to
S0018	do you go last night
S0146	no the candlelit class be full
S0018	oh
S0004	the way describe how you look when you come back be pallid and fluffy
S0004	you look like just everything have be sweat out of you and you be just like
S0146	oh yeah she go to that class but she and i i go with a friend of mine dub to the the first class but she go by herself on wednesday so we go on monday and she go by herself on wednesday and um and she think she overdo it because you know when you get overexcited you think oh let me go again
S0018	mm
S0146	and if you haven't repair
S0004	yeah you're suppose to have rest time
S0146	exactly
S0018	yeah
S0004	i didn't exercise yesterday
S0018	do you go to that new restaurant last night
S0146	well so we be go to go to the candlelit class and then em they have by like midday they have fill the thirty seat so you could book online so then we be gonna we keep try to ring them and say look be it worth us come first come first serve and and they say well we've get fifty out of fifty five people here already so we say oh forget it we're not go to get in so then we say oh let's meet up for a drink so then text and say do you want to meet for a drink we're like here come here so she come there
S0018	good do you eat there what's it like
S0146	we didn't we just have snack actually like hummus and pitta and stuff but 's eat there and she say it be really nice
S0018	it's just really like a kind of sterile environment apart from the view
S0146	it's it's it's warm up a little bite now
S0018	really
S0146	yeah it's um it be quite busy like the whole restaurant be full and the bar be quite full and because they have a dj and stuff it actually felt a lot better than that week like it's they're obviously get the hang of it and then these three guy they be sit on like the table behind us and they come up to us and they say can we play a little quiz and we say okay which one of us be gay which one of us be marry which one of us be divorce and then we guess and then we like have to guess and then one of them end up eh work for the bbc and so he start chat he's like oh didn't you work blah blah blah and actually in the same in the way that these be there be only one file cabinet that divide us it be we be sit next to each other in an open plan office and and didn't recognise him at all and eh then be say because he work for gardener's world and point of view and be like be you sure that's not the guy that go on a date with cos go on a date with a guy that work for gardener's world and subsequently whenever we walk to like we have to walk like quickly past his road or by pass it in case we see him
S0018	be that the one she meet on the guardian website
S0146	yeah
S0018	oh
S0146	and um and we be like oh i don't know
S0018	you know i saw um 's neighbour
S0146	yeah
S0018	on the guardian date website
S0146	oh really ah it's
S0004	i've log onto these things before and say i'm a woman seek a man or a man seek a man just to see who i know on there i there's like five people

S0146	it's really unnerve when i um look at it and i can't remember what year but when i hadn't actually i you know when me and break up then um everyone's like go onto a date website just start meet other people you don't need to date them it would just be good for you to and i be like look i'm not join anything and i just like have this sneaky peek at the guardian soulmate site and then i recognise like an ex colleague from london and somebody else which i think i know and then i think no this be too close to home
S0004	pretty small world

S0004	no
S0018	i don't think it be present by anneka rice but it be of a similar genre to the treasure hunt one
S0146	yeah
S0018	that be brilliant
S0146	well so she be talk about her life actually and she's quite interest like she sort of say that you know she start off an apprenticeship at the age of seventeen and you know the fact that her mum absolutely resent have kid and you know and she be like basically a mother of the second world war who be quite intelligent and think you know actually i've have these kid but i don't want them and go to study and get degrees and all of that and actually you know resent annika and so they grow up basically you know no bake no nothing never you know and
S0018	mm
S0146	so she grow up quite fast and then she talk about sort of like go her friends go to university and her not and she get an apprenticeship at the bbc when she be seventeen and pretend she be twenty five because so she could be take seriously and and you know and then she leave the industry like the public eye around the time of the jill dando shoot stuff
S0018	mm
S0146	and then sort of fell out of love with like british tv and think it be all really insipid and this all sort of reality culture and how people start call her and harass her family and
S0018	really
S0146	you know well like um you know she say you know i'd be in a cab go somewhere with my kid and you know as soon as the cab go there the paparazzi be already there to photograph her she just
S0018	oh okay that aspect of it
S0146	you know and i absolutely i felt hound and she say i won't even talk about the levenson inquiry because actually i've get an awful lot you know if i start to raise my claim you know and
S0018	and she actually leave
S0146	and she just felt so disillusion she leave the public eye but then she she's a clever little lady she like paint a picture of oh you know i go to art college you know i sell paint and stuff but actually also what she's be do be sell the right of challenge anneka across the world
S0018	mm
S0146	so in austria it's like challenge fritz eh you know in new york it's challenge erin brokovich you know she she's like absolutely you know do eh sort of pop idol american idol type thing on challenge annika and now she's come back to do a bite of tv and radio like prime time stuff so that's what the interview be about
S0018	mm and what's her reason in to come back into the business after have such strong feel about
S0146	exactly i think because her kid have grow up now and she think that because she's older people don't really they only want like a new young trendy
S0018	oh okay
S0146	sort of people they don't really care about
S0018	yeah
S0146	you know old age and she be part of the whole sort of um miriam thingy about you know old presenters old female presenters on tv

S0018	mm hm
S0146	but i think i need to start sort of cos eh i i just haven't have a chance you know normally like i have a bite longer and i sort of start think and mull over it a little bite
S0018	mm hm
S0146	and you know really sort of and then when i'm like on the train or something then i'll just sit there and i start like bash it out like
S0018	mm hm
S0146	or before bed you know when the inspiration hit and i knock one out and it take a long time but i've just be i just have to put it in a file cabinet and shelf it cos i've have so much else to do
S0018	mm hm

S0018	aw that's lovely all you'll see around hatton be beautiful they've get all the canal and lock and i think it might be a reserve area a nature reserve area
S0146	i think so it's from all account it sound absolutely

S0146	ah
S0018	from the beer garden

S0018	be sick
S0146	yeah
S0018	eat some poison we can't go
S0018	i know it's lovely round there i'd love to live around there but it's i think it's extremely expensive
S0146	so they be they move there from leicester because his wife didn't like be in leicester even though he'd live there and have a house in leicester she didn't wanna she didn't like his friends she didn't like be in the you know she have insecurity issue with his friends and all of that kind of stuff and she just want to break away that's why they you know sell the house and start rent there to look for like where they could live and they be look for house and she's just a little bite of a nutcase i think she have absolute insecurity issue i think that like it's really weird like um she come to one birthday party of mine this be when you be in spain and um it be a couple of years ago when i live with and before i move in here
S0018	mm hm
S0146	and um she come and everything and it be fine and so you know i be try to build on you know on a new friendship you know bring her into the fold a bite for 's sake and all of that but then like when they start go through difficulties like she every saturday morning for some reason she would like message me on a saturday morning at like eight thirty in the morning and like you know when you could see someone's online
S0018	un mm
S0146	i be like oh for fuck sake i've just wake up
S0018	hi stalker
S0146	hi how be you fine you know something something and then so we'd have these like long draw out like you've just wake up all you want to do be just check your check your facebook and that's it carry on with your day and um and she yeah and so she she realise that she'd build like a little bite of a facebooky sort of relationship right
S0018	em mm
S0146	and then it get to the point where like when they start go through a little bite of difficulty he be very silent you know he's very dignify he didn't you know he just when they start go through real problems he just sort of say look you know we're go through real difficulties at the moment and that be just more of a way of understand etcetera just know that i'm in a you know and so you understand the gravity of that she start message me if me and break up will you still be my friend
S0018	like i'm fourteen years old
S0146	yeah and it's all of this sort of stuff and i and she would like and i sort of say look you know i don't think it's a case of break up i think you know if you're marry i think you know who be i to say anything but i think you should sort of try and work it do you know what i mean
S0018	mm
S0146	i don't think you should like just hang your coat up straight away you know i think just like look at it i don't know i just find that and he be say the other day that she even though the divorce be go through like she's the one that's divorce him
S0018	right
S0146	and yet the other day she ring him like during the week and say oh hi oh i've just have a bite of an argument with my mum and my brother i just want to hear a friendly voice and he's like oh for fuck's sake why be you ring me
S0018	do they have children
S0146	no they
S0018	so they don't even have anything link them together any more
S0146	no and he's like friendly voice ring one of your friends for fuck's sake you're divorce me i'm not a friendly voice and it's like you know and then or she'll like you know he'll be on air and she'll text in to the show and say oh i really like a really good show you know like he's on air this be his job like leave him alone let him have a bite of space
S0018	so do she move out
S0146	so what happen in in they say in the begin of the break up be the fact that like she like she be just she be an optician she move up when she get marry and she just basically decide she couldn't be bother to work like i don't know why i don't know why but she say you know locuming be fine which for some people it be but she wouldn't actively go and seek any sort of job and so she spend you know and they be start to get you know under each other's skin a bite and then she start sort of make him feel a bite more inadequate you know stop smoke whatever and up to six months prior she be smoke too you know so stop smoke i hate it you know what about for the future you know you're smoke blah blah blah and and then you know you don't save money and you know and he say it be really start to piss him off a little bite that she be just always count the pennies
S0018	mm
S0146	and you know and you know you're spend too much you know you don't earn enough and all of this kind of thing and he say well why don't you go and get a bloody job as well then we can get a bite more money if you've feel so inadequate and um you know all of this sort of stuff and and then one day you know they be just there and she have just start like have a go at him and and sort of say you know this and this like a normal row so she go upstairs and he think you know she's just go to cool down whatever then half an hour later her mum ring downstairs while he be in the lounge she say um you know 's really upset you know she's be cry her eye out

S0146	kind of thing so they keep ring the house phone they have like caller id and they wouldn't pick up the phone the the family wouldn't pick up the phone it get a little bite ridiculous then they start get like other a bite like she didn't come back she didn't answer so he go back after the weekend she like over the next week or so they like you know she be like no i'm not come back i don't think i'm ready to come back and then but start tell every man and their dog like include me she be facebook message me tell me that her and be go through real problems and all of this kind of stuff she didn't know what to do and
S0018	oh it sound like
S0146	you know
S0018	he's best off without her but they're marry
S0146	couldn't deal with tension so they'd be marry for a year and a half
S0018	do he not realise before the marriage that she be a nutcase
S0146	you know what i think she just really like the idea of be marry
S0018	mm
S0146	and they have this like fairytale hollywood like marriage like they get marry it be you know they pump all their life save i mean that wed cost at least a hundred and twenty grand
S0018	oh my days
S0146	it it be the you know it be the work so they have like a beautiful ceremony and they have like this amaze reception in um park lane
S0018	right so they be she be pump by the idea of the wed not the marriage
S0146	absolutely and they you know they have all these like you know folk dancers in between he come in on a horse you know it be like the full on shebang
S0018	when do they meet how long do they have they know each other before that
S0146	so they be sort of introduce like i think her her dad he he work for like the communist party and his there be some sort of like like her um his parent be both like councillors and stuff like that
S0018	mm hm
S0146	and i think through a political connection you know blah blah blah you know of a way of oh you know i've get a son and i've get a daughter of you know so they just sort of meet and they sort of go i think they go out for six months and in that time i remember at christmas time like basically she what's an ectopic pregnancy
S0018	oh when the foetus start develop outside of the womb maybe in the ovaries
S0146	i don't know what it be then so basically what happen be that while they be still date um something happen it be on christmas eve i remember that she lose an awful lot of blood
S0018	oh god
S0146	because she didn't realise that she be even pregnant and um and so yeah and so you know and that i think through that experience it bring them together
S0018	right
S0146	and they just sort of decide in the new year we're get as an addition
S0018	mm hm
S0146	the follow summer
S0018	couldn't they just have a big party
S0146	yeah exactly and then they go to like you know they go on like three holiday they go to like india both the mums and they all go to india together to do all the wed shop
S0018	god
S0146	they go to i think they do like a caribbean holiday they do another load of like european holiday they be really really
S0018	nice
S0146	stack and pack it in the middle of the wed plan and then they get marry in the september and then one and a half years later they're go through a divorce
S0018	sound like he need a lot of friendly attention then
S0146	yeah
S0018	of normal people
S0146	of normality yeah
S0018	oh guy sound like he's better off without her though
S0146	yeah
S0018	what a crazy woman
S0146	yeah but it's just you know it screw up the whole family's life doesn't it because
S0018	yeah i bet he's regret the whole marriage thing now
S0146	yeah he's a bite jade like when we go to that party last weekend he be just like i'm go for an hour say hello to sonia i be like ah that's so sweet so much fun then i remember hold on a minute he's you know quite tender actually and we're go to a marriage celebration so don't rub it in
S0018	oh be that the
S0146	's you know that leave party
S0018	oh i think ah it be leave party oh cos she be leave to go and get marry
S0146	yeah
S0018	have she leave already
S0146	em i think she's i don't know i think she might be leave in the next few days cos the wedding's in april
S0018	oh i think for the first time in age i haven't get any wed any friends get marry in the near future
S0146	that's because they're all start to have bloody kid
S0146	we've go past the wed season all our friends be marry now and now they're have kid
S0146	they're do with that
S0018	i wonder how long it will take and to succumb
S0146	i i think basically i think like this job be quite pivotal because if she get it
S0018	yeah
S0146	and it's a london move
S0018	yeah
S0146	it's so pivotal because he can relocate like that
S0018	mm
S0146	em and actually it would be better for him to be in london cos he'd be in the fold so if they get that i reckon they would probably settle down they would probably do about a year and then i think you know they'd baby babyfication would begin and equally if she doesn't get it i think you know i think they might restart the house hunt
S0018	yeah but she be say that if even if she get the job they'll still try and buy a house around here
S0146	yeah as an investment
S0018	oh right
S0146	because they can always live at 's house in ealing
S0018	mm
S0146	they can buy this as an investment because it's good for them and also you know if they ever come back because 's parent be here and stuff like that
S0018	yeah
S0146	this be a good base isn't it so
S0018	definitely
S0146	but i think you know in term of like a longer term sort of you know a a nest egg that's what they'd they might do and then they might move to london and stay at 's
S0018	it's difficult to know what house price be gonna do though isn't it i don't know whether actually be it an investment any more buy a house
S0146	or be it a liability
S0018	yeah exactly
S0146	exactly you know what the trick be year house price be low and interest rat be low but interest rat be gonna rise and when they do mortgage rat will rise and it's about be able to afford the mortgage when you've get an extra two hundred and fifty odd quid on top of that
S0018	mm
S0146	and you've get deep unemployment you can't rent it out
S0018	yeah
S0146	can you carry on with those mortgage payments cos otherwise you're ruin
S0018	well that's the thing i think if you've get a mortgage a few years ago you know you you
S0146	two thousand and eight
S0018	you it end up be cheaper than rent cheaper than monthly rent but people i know that be get mortgage nowadays it's actually more expensive than rent and it's over half of their salary i think i remember my dad always use to say a guide of mortgage you shouldn't pay more than a third of your salary but i think that's just impossible now
S0146	but that's if you've get um a lot of you know a good down payment a good deposit then it's you know and and many you know whose my parent can't give me sixty grand you know to put into a house
S0018	blimey be that how much you need for a down payment these days
S0146	you need you need to give twenty percent at least
S0018	blimey
S0146	at least and then it also vary you know and that's the absolute minimum you need to put down at least twenty percent of the price of the property and that be without any you know legal fee you know consultancy fee
S0018	but if the average
S0146	any work you've do it any furniture anything
S0018	if the average salary be twenty five thousand
S0146	yeah
S0018	which let's face it be barely a a live wage
S0146	yeah
S0018	how on earth be people suppose to a be able to invest in property
S0146	so the people that can do it
S0018	and have somewhere
S0146	be people where parent give you like fat sum of like fifty grand
S0018	but then then they're say save for your retirement how be you suppose to save for retirement when property cost so much and the price of live be so high and salaries be so low i mean there seem to be a huge jump between
S0146	it's the disparity it's the disparity and that's why it just seem it be talk to because she's you know she be say it's only in britain where there be that emphasis you know where there's this sort of twin track you know this divide committee and where you know something like a house be look upon as an asset whereas actually across europe rent be be a big you know be a big thing and actually
S0018	well i think there's some logic to it because when you retire you can sell your house
S0146	exactly
S0018	downsize and you've make
S0146	yeah
S0018	a bite of income from it
S0146	yeah
S0018	i mean cos if you if you don't i mean you've get nowhere to live if you never buy and then you retire you're you've get to pay a lot of your peanuts that you receive in pension
S0146	in rent
S0018	in rent or buy a house whereas if you contribute to a house all your life and then sell it and buy another one at least you don't have to pay rent
S0146	mm
S0018	and all your pension be spend you can spend it
S0146	i wish i know how smart people do it like there be a guy that um use to work at the bbc and he buy a house in harbourn on war lane
S0018	uh huh
S0146	that main road and you know just off the high street
S0018	mm
S0146	and he buy it at the right time and he get it for ninety eight grand
S0018	wow
S0146	and then he sell it for two hundred and ten grand
S0018	oh my life how many years later
S0146	four years later
S0018	no no
S0146	so he catch it at the right bloody time
S0018	jammy dodge dodger
S0146	and then his partner andrew also do the very similar thing you know off the pershaw road there's first second third avenue
S0018	uh huh
S0146	i think it be on second avenue that he buy a house and he get a good extra hundred grand off the back of that
S0018	yeah no see if i if i have um if i have be give a permanent contract in spain i would have be able to buy at the time when it would have be extremely lucrative
S0146	yeah
S0018	because like fourteen years ago it would have cost thirty thousand to get thirty thousand pound to get a three bedroomed flat
S0146	no way
S0018	which now even with the the property crisis over there actually would it would probably be quite difficult to sell but for example have i buy it fourteen years ago and then sell it six years ago it would have
S0146	you'd have be about a hundred and eighty now
S0018	oh at least oh it just make me sick it's not fair the way that the you know everything be so dependent on the market how the market play it's like these be basic human need
S0146	yeah
S0018	to have shelter
S0146	yeah
S0018	to be able to earn a live wage that you with which you can pay
S0146	yeah
S0018	fuel and food and it just seem that nowadays there's no there's no guarantee of be able to have that
S0146	yeah absolutely
S0018	oh good job 's not here he'd be go go crazy over the subject oh it's labour's fault oh it's the politicians i agree it's the politicians but they're all as bad as each other
