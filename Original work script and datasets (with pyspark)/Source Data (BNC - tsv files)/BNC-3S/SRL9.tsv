S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	i do not know that about prosecco who win the scrabble
S0590	well that be quite funny do
S0588	yes
S0590	by a a significant number er a very significant number it be so significant that i be surprise and i look at the whatnot i could see that something say er two hundred and sixty eight
S0588	yes
S0590	but have misread it as two eighty eight
S0588	right
S0590	so i could see i could see it be two six eight and i could see that the addition be wrong so i say hold on a minute
S0590	you haven't add your score up correctly
S0588	yeah
S0590	so he correct that and it be still about fifty ahead i'd actually finish the game by go all out
S0588	mm
S0590	with my two letter only and then we discover there be one letter in the bag so we be
S0588	oh
S0590	both cheat quite inadvertently i mean i should have pick up the letter
S0588	ah
S0590	and er so no but no he win quite
S0588	yes
S0590	significantly it be it be quite an interest game it go very quickly to start with and then so many of the word you couldn't add to at at the end at all
S0588	no
S0590	so it be block in all sort of directions
S0588	yes
S0590	and then he throw away all those be and i pick them all up
S0590	so and
S0588	someone have to get them
S0590	be be a a selection of be be a useless combination
S0588	yes
S0590	yeah but it be a good game we've always love as a the family have play scrabble
S0588	well yes
S0590	forever actually
S0588	and you've get that erm
S0590	yeah
S0588	sort of platform that rotate around
S0590	yes yeah we do actually
S0588	as well
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	yeah that's good
S0590	that's quite useful
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	i don't know how can play it upside down but he do
S0590	yes
S0588	i couldn't
S0590	not not easy actually
S0588	er so
S0590	mm
S0588	an extra thing to deal with there
S0590	no to read you know
S0588	yeah
S0590	you could read word but we we i would find it very difficult to find the clever
S0588	mm
S0590	place if i'm look
S0588	mm
S0590	at it upside down i could probably find
S0588	yeah
S0590	somewhere to add you know to a letter to add some letter
S0588	yeah
S0590	to it but to actually erm infill
S0588	yes
S0590	upside down i i don't think i could do
S0588	clever can
S0590	mm yeah
S0588	i can write backwards
S0590	ah well that's brilliant then
S0590	with
S0588	but it's a bite of a useful skill but i can
S0590	well er er yes yeah but
S0588	i don't know why i can write backwards but i can and just use my leave hand and i can write really easily backwards
S0590	really
S0588	yeah and then you
S0590	cos that's
S0588	then you put it in a mirror and it's correct
S0590	yeah
S0588	but i no i wonder if anyone can or if it's a very special skill that i've get
S0590	no i don't think i've ever try
S0588	if only
S0590	i don't think i could
S0588	there be a job that
S0590	i mean if
S0588	require write backwards
S0590	if when you write it backwards
S0588	yeah
S0590	do you write each letter normally
S0588	no no
S0590	or do you write the letter backwards as well so
S0588	no the letter backwards
S0590	if you be write bag
S0588	mm
S0590	the the g would be
S0588	yeah
S0590	backwards itself
S0588	yeah yeah
S0590	yeah and then the a and then the b
S0588	i do it join up but
S0590	yeah i could do bag actually quite easily
S0588	yeah
S0590	i can see that
S0588	yeah well you can have a go if you want
S0590	yeah
S0588	but er
S0590	i think i think i
S0588	i don't know why i know or discover that i could write backwards
S0590	yeah
S0588	because nobody ask you or teach you to write backwards
S0590	no and certainly not
S0588	i must have think
S0590	not a skill not in the
S0588	oh i'm go to try to write backwards
S0590	national curriculum
S0588	exactly
S0590	yeah
S0588	typical me
S0590	yeah
S0588	to learn to do something
S0590	mm
S0588	completely useless
S0590	we've get one credit card yes
S0588	be that for emergencies or or just
S0590	no we use that we use that as the if the account be get rather low
S0588	okay
S0590	you know and then we just you know
S0588	yeah it's quite useful
S0590	put it on to the next one actually
S0588	for that isn't it
S0590	and we we pay it off by direct debit
S0588	yeah
S0590	so it er it never ever build up it get pay
S0588	yeah
S0590	at the end of a month automatically
S0588	you don't get any interest er put on if you pay it
S0590	no
S0588	straight away do you
S0590	no
S0588	that's the best way
S0590	yeah
S0588	to use them
S0590	and that that work perfectly because we
S0588	that do work perfectly yeah
S0590	we don't have to worry about it
S0588	yeah
S0590	we don't have a limit
S0588	no
S0590	the it it be pay off
S0588	yeah there's nothing in it
S0590	yeah
S0588	for the bank when people use it like that
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	but i suppose they're bank on
S0590	but most
S0588	excuse the pun
S0590	most people don't
S0588	on
S0590	yeah
S0588	the people who don't use it like that
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	and build up debts
S0590	because too many people use it
S0588	well
S0590	with no mean of pay it
S0588	well exactly
S0590	yeah
S0588	that's kind of what they want isn't it
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	because if everyone use it sensibly like you be they
S0590	yeah
S0588	wouldn't make any money out of it
S0590	no no
S0588	so
S0590	but you know when you read of people they're usually single mums with four or five children
S0589	yeah
S0590	who spend
S0588	yeah
S0590	three thousand pound on christmas present
S0588	that's unbelievable isn't it
S0590	it's
S0588	but
S0590	yeah
S0588	it be it be in the nineties that it it get ridiculous in the nineties because you get send letter i remember get send letter just offer credit
S0590	well yes
S0588	just like that
S0590	yeah
S0588	and they make it seem a very normal
S0590	yeah that
S0589	well
S0590	everybody do it
S0588	a nice thing
S0590	and that you know
S0589	when she live in be just in the sainsbury's and think that after she's do her shop someone just come up and say blah blah blah blah blah so she think oh yeah i'll i'll sign and get a
S0588	yeah

S0589	specials things off end up it be a credit card she'd sign up for
S0588	yeah
S0589	so make her go back and cancel it and it be

S0588	it really be appal
S0590	yeah
S0588	and they want to just trap you into it
S0590	yeah
S0588	so they be all really nice and sort of oh yes and this be you know
S0590	mm
S0590	yeah
S0588	and so trap people into er
S0590	yeah
S0588	know they must have know full well that this be not gonna be in anybody's in people's favour
S0590	yes yes
S0588	if they're gonna make money
S0590	exactly yes
S0588	then
S0590	well because it's it's erm sort of concentrate on on people's weaknesses cos er you know
S0588	absolutely yeah
S0590	er we live in a in a absolutely era era of
S0588	where you want things
S0590	but want them instantly
S0588	and want them instantly

S0590	yeah so then they get ask by the bank for the money so then they go to a loan
S0588	yeah
S0590	shark

S0590	and and then they they just end up in
S0588	but it's the bank fault in the

S0588	well then they get divorce in a few in a
S0590	they do they do
S0590	yeah er be be already well and truly divorce from erm er

S0590	and leave er within
S0588	well
S0590	two three months of a wed
S0588	i've i've hear of this happen where the wed be the focus
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it keep everything buoyant
S0590	yeah
S0588	in the relationship
S0590	yeah
S0588	because they're both
S0590	yeah
S0588	busy and
S0590	and
S0588	focus outside of their relationship
S0590	yeah
S0588	on the wed
S0590	yeah
S0588	and then
S0590	but
S0588	when that's all over
S0590	and it it's back to the same old kitchen sink
S0588	yeah
S0590	with the same old hoover and the same old
S0588	yeah
S0590	wash machine
S0588	so nothing to divert
S0590	and yeah
S0588	from
S0590	and the the illusion
S0589	that be and i would always
S0588	their life
S0589	you always worry
S0588	yeah
S0589	when couple suddenly get
S0588	well i
S0590	well i actually
S0588	i do question it actually
S0590	yeah yeah i actually say to and you know when we be there for drink you know many a time when all this whole cos they be engage about eighteen months plan all this you see be plan it all
S0588	well yeah
S0590	wasn't
S0588	happily busy plan it
S0590	and i say to them i say you know this be a recipe for disaster because be
S0588	no you're right
S0590	just go to go back to the same old house with the same old fellow
S0588	yeah
S0590	who's exactly the same old fellow
S0588	i mean it's like have a hobby
S0590	yeah
S0588	for eighteen months
S0590	yeah
S0588	because you can focus on
S0589	what happen have they split up or
S0590	er er two months later she go back to stay with her mother
S0588	mm
S0590	and she's go off to australia to her father
S0588	and how much do they spend in the end
S0590	the well the well for one thing she didn't have one wed dress but and i think it be who
S0588	she have a spare
S0590	actually buy
S0590	well she buy a dress it have to be alter it didn't fit when it be alter and say that in fact have lose weight which be the usual thing
S0588	yeah
S0590	but this dress wasn't big enough and
S0588	oh dear
S0590	and so she didn't want it so they have to pay a whack sum for the alter dress
S0588	how ridiculous
S0590	and then she get a different one
S0588	oh my god
S0589	stupid
S0590	but within two months have go back to to live with mum
S0588	but it be probably
S0590	and and then er within a year
S0588	the shock of reality
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	cos the wedding's a fairy tale
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it's not real be it
S0590	and it yeah it's a complete illusion
S0589	well it's a distraction
S0588	yeah
S0590	it's a complete
S0588	it just
S0590	waste of time
S0588	yeah
S0590	i mean do you remember you be down visit us when we get a er so do when send an email say we get marry yesterday
S0590	yeah
S0588	well i think
S0590	they have to
S0588	which be fine if you know that it's just
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	just a bite of fun and
S0590	mm
S0588	if you're a millionaire then that's not a problem
S0590	yeah
S0588	why not
S0590	yeah
S0588	er it's just a bite of fun and you know that it's
S0590	yeah
S0588	just indulge in a
S0590	yeah
S0588	bite of a fairy
S0590	yeah
S0588	tale thing but
S0590	but i think when
S0588	if you don't have the money
S0590	yeah
S0588	that's just crazy
S0590	yeah i think when and come back because that that's they have to legalise it in the uk as well because it be do in japan
S0588	apparently erm
S0590	which be another piece of paper but i
S0588	yeah
S0589	but they may not they've not be incline to do that so far
S0590	no but i think they they they might not but if they do they'll just
S0588	but would do they just do it so that they could stay
S0590	you know go tot along to whatever office and they'll probably have a party afterwards
S0588	no cos they're go to yes they'll want to
S0589	it's like when and i get marry we'll just pop down to
S0588	yeah
S0589	and take
S0588	yeah
S0589	as a witness
S0588	maybe or you'll be the oh no can you be a witness
S0589	just take to be a witness
S0588	yeah
S0590	he'd like that actually
S0588	but erm can your mother in law be the witness
S0589	don't see why not so long as you're a person
S0590	yeah
S0588	be it can it be anybody who's a witness
S0590	yeah uh oh
S0588	so you only need two plus a witness
S0590	two witness the
S0588	oh be it two witness
S0590	oh
S0589	two
S0590	i think it might be two
S0589	it can't be
S0590	think of my dickens novels
S0590	or hardy novels even better
S0588	but you have to go for an
S0590	mm
S0588	for an interview and everything

S0589	no
S0588	you do
S0590	no only in a church
S0588	no i i look into it
S0590	ah
S0588	and you have to go for a preliminary thing
S0590	oh right er probably probably now that be to prove you're you're
S0589	that you're not
S0588	yeah
S0590	you've not be marry before
S0588	it'll be just passports and things yeah

S0589	yeah
S0590	mean everything that's in it
S0589	well it mean that he legally own

S0588	want some more wine oh you've get beer
S0589	just another beer darling
S0590	i just he'd leave somebody now to to to i i take the view i mean when we give you that money for your for the whatnotties that it's far more sensible for you to have it now and we receive grateful thank and you get the use of it than after we're six foot under the soil
S0588	yeah well i mean that's
S0589	yeah
S0588	but er but very grateful as well but both you and

S0588	my 's
S0590	your mum
S0588	you and my mum allow some money to be release
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	cos it make sense because
S0590	it do yeah

S0588	we be able to
S0590	well yes
S0588	buy a property
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	it's just well why
S0590	i mean just think
S0588	it's ridiculous it's it's er
S0590	yeah
S0588	a no brainer really
S0590	yeah exactly
S0588	mm
S0590	yeah
S0588	but er yeah
S0590	i mean you should have do it years before but that be good time actually because we have downsize
S0588	should have do it years before and obviously the time be right but why i didn't think of do it years before i don't know
S0590	yeah
S0588	really weird
S0590	yeah
S0588	that i didn't think of it could have do it years before
S0590	mm
S0588	but i think my dad might have have something to do with it somehow everything get a bite more i think easier
S0590	when it be just your mum cos your mum wasn't yeah
S0588	yeah i don't know
S0590	yeah
S0588	exactly why but
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	i think maybe he be
S0590	well
S0588	sort of hold things very tightly
S0590	yeah but but
S0588	or something maybe not
S0590	but but
S0588	but i'd put it to them in a way that sound
S0590	yeah
S0588	really sensible which it would have be
S0590	yeah
S0588	then erm
S0590	but of course back in those days the the the rental accommodation be manageable and house price weren't go up
S0588	yeah
S0590	by the blink of an eye now
S0588	yeah
S0590	rent be become absolutely i mean god know
S0588	oh it's ridiculous
S0590	what would be let
S0588	no it would be far more expensive
S0590	what the rent would have be on number two road if you be still there
S0588	than what we're pay yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	absolutely
S0590	and and house price they say in london er in the month of february house price in london go up on average er of course you've get twenty million pound house rather distort it but
S0588	mm
S0590	the average be fifty pound a day
S0588	yeah
S0590	that's three thousand a month
S0588	it's crazy
S0590	yeah but you know if you look er i look at rightmove and i put in two hundred and fifty thousand and
S0588	you get a flat now
S0590	and a small flat at that
S0588	yes
S0590	yes
S0588	god
S0590	yeah
S0588	the skin of our teeth wasn't it
S0589	well ten years ago though if we'd buy our road flat er house
S0588	well that's what i'm think
S0590	yeah
S0588	because ten years ago and we'd be millionaires by now
S0589	mm
S0588	and i blame myself i blame myself for not think of it
S0590	mm
S0588	so i could have think of it and i could have legitimately ask my parent and then would have start the ball roll
S0589	well when be the money that you give me that's when you sell
S0590	well that's when we downsize
S0589	well when be that what year
S0590	er 0 seven
S0589	so 0 seven which be almost
S0590	nine years ago
S0588	that be before you'd 0 seven two thousand and seven
S0590	yeah
S0588	mm
S0589	so that be only three years
S0590	that's when we downsize
S0588	no it be when die say well you can buy it if you want to
S0590	yeah
S0588	and i i think even before then
S0590	and what would he have sell it for
S0588	well now i mean at the time it seem ridiculously out it seem out of the question at the time
S0590	how much be it
S0588	but i can't remember but i mean i know
S0590	oh right yeah
S0588	now
S0590	no
S0588	it would seem
S0590	it be very
S0588	ridiculously low
S0590	mm mm
S0588	well maybe it still wasn't well i didn't think how i couldn't think or my
S0590	well cos i mean you
S0588	my my mind didn't erm even comprehend that there be any
S0590	yeah
S0588	way
S0590	yeah
S0588	possible
S0590	and in a way
S0588	at all
S0590	i mean neither of you could have afford that and
S0588	but we could have if we'd
S0590	we be not in a position then
S0588	oh you be
S0590	when
S0588	oh
S0590	when die we weren't
S0588	mm
S0590	in a position to
S0588	so it would have just be
S0590	yeah
S0588	me get some money from the will
S0590	yeah
S0588	well maybe it wasn't possible
S0590	yeah
S0588	it probably be though because if say i'd get thirty thousand pound
S0590	yeah
S0588	it might have be enough for a deposit
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	in those days
S0590	yeah mind you if you think you know if you go back and look at go into now you you'd be amaze how small it be
S0588	yeah it would probably seem really small
S0590	yeah because
S0588	yeah
S0590	if you think in that front downstairs room the sit room
S0588	mm
S0590	you have a double bed
S0588	yeah
S0590	and there wasn't much room
S0588	mm no not with a double bed in there
S0590	round the edge of it no and i mean look if you put a double bed in here
S0588	mm
S0590	or indeed even down in the snug how much
S0588	it would be interest
S0590	room there'd be
S0588	to go back in there and
S0590	yeah
S0588	see what the size would be like
S0590	and and remember how narrow the hall be
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah but i'm sure
S0588	but a lot of it be the that they have it be very heath robinson wasn't it the way it
S0590	well it that downstairs shower be
S0588	it have be
S0590	appal
S0588	tag on here and
S0590	yeah
S0588	you know a wash machine
S0590	i
S0588	under the stairs
S0590	mind you i think that be a very clever place to put it but
S0588	but
S0590	it should have box in
S0588	obviously appropriate for a share house in the circumstances but
S0590	well no i think a a very good place for a wash machine
S0588	yeah
S0590	but it should have be in a cupboard
S0588	well yeah
S0590	under the stair
S0588	but it be just a rent share
S0590	yeah
S0588	house
S0590	yeah
S0588	so and the
S0590	yeah it wasn't home
S0588	yeah it well and the whole share thing make it quite hard for it to be
S0590	yeah
S0588	home
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	we do well
S0590	you do yeah and do but
S0590	you know share a kitchen
S0588	you know and it's just
S0590	share bathrooms and things
S0588	it's impossible to get control of things
S0590	yeah
S0588	domestically when
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	you're live with
S0590	and that partly
S0588	other people
S0590	that's partly why you're so darn good at do it now because you've probably
S0588	well you can get control of it
S0590	still enjoy it
S0588	but you can't
S0590	yeah
S0588	get control of it when
S0590	yeah

S0590	ter giv er sations
S0588	be that as it's spell
S0589	tergiversations

S0588	t e r
S0590	t e r g i v e r s a t i o n s tergiversations
S0588	nope
S0589	no
S0590	tergiversations
S0589	mm
S0590	we must look it up
S0588	yeah
S0590	a word that dad and i love use and you can use it quite loudly cos nobody would know about it when it's apply callipygous
S0588	callipygous
S0590	yeah
S0588	nice bottom
S0590	yes you know that word
S0589	well know a lot
S0588	use that word
S0590	yes it's a wonderful word actually
S0590	so i mean but you know the general population do not know it so that you can say
S0588	except
S0590	yes
S0588	know it
S0590	your father must have teach you that word do he
S0588	don't know
S0589	erm
S0588	where do you get your word form
S0589	when i first come across word it be
S0588	what's the best way of learn word do you think
S0589	well we come across that word on a cryptic crossword
S0588	do you think
S0590	ah that's where dad find it as well actually
S0589	i can't remember the clue but it mention kylie minogue
S0588	do you think crosswords be the best way
S0590	yeah
S0588	to learn to expand your vocabulary
S0590	er crosswords be very good actually
S0588	yeah i i think so
S0590	they they've get to be high quality crosswords sort of thing but
S0589	well no i think cryptic
S0588	but even basic crosswords be quite good
S0589	cos a basic crossword you if you don't know the answer then you won't then you wouldn't well know the word so you wouldn't get it whereas a cryptic you can work out the word and then know not know what it mean be you follow the logic there
S0588	but even a basic crossword though if you're on an app and it give the answer if you don't know but then you can kind of make a point of remember it
S0590	yeah
S0588	and the whole process of actually do it as well i think
S0590	yeah
S0588	be quite good
S0590	yeah there be
S0588	of remember
S0590	the
S0588	word
S0590	the one of the few clue i remember from cryptic crosswords be this one which i think be absolutely brilliant and let me just think of it again party dress a party dress do erm party dress do be order
S0588	yeah
S0590	party dress do
S0588	no i can't do cryptic
S0590	no well the answer
S0588	so that's that
S0590	party dress do be order the answer be dominican and if you think er party a do
S0588	mm
S0590	dress a mini
S0588	oh okay
S0590	erm
S0588	could be
S0590	erm order can no no no wait a minute party dress do
S0589	you've get something wrong here darling
S0590	no wait a minute yeah
S0588	but i don't i get the gist
S0590	party dress do

S0589	and then the word that give you the clue
S0590	party be and the word yes can well erm be order the order
S0589	oh

S0589	dominican

S0590	my sister be very good at them
S0588	but what what's the special talent that you must have
S0590	erm
S0588	have to do cryptic crosswords
S0590	actually a very good knowledge of word
S0588	well obviously
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	be that actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	erm and i mean really i think a warp brain
S0588	bite of yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	but you're gonna be make connections where
S0590	yes where
S0588	there's really no obvious connection at all
S0590	yes yeah exactly which be the warp brain thing
S0588	yes
S0590	you've get to be able
S0588	suppose that's why people like them
S0590	yeah you can't have a scientific brain because a scientific brain be
S0588	no cos it's not very scientific either
S0590	be a direct thing actually
S0588	which be what i can't i can't even start on the cryptic because
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's okay you can either be artistic or you can scientific in life
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it's not even scientific and it's neither
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	it's not and it's something else
S0590	i've remember the whole clue party
S0589	hang on yeah
S0590	dress container be order
S0589	can
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	and if be
S0588	do you do you get that one
S0590	no no do but i
S0588	oh
S0590	and he but as soon as he tell me the answer dominican
S0590	i you know i could see that it be a do a dress
S0588	so 's get the special
S0590	and a container
S0588	the special brain for that
S0590	but how you write them yeah i mean and actually write it
S0588	maybe write them be easier though i would have think if you be set the task of write one it's probably a lot easier than actually
S0590	well
S0590	yeah
S0588	try to crack it you'd just be as obscure as you want to
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	cos wouldn't you and just cos they're so the link be so weak between the word and the clue
S0590	yeah
S0588	really
S0590	yeah yes
S0588	isn't it
S0590	and of course there be all sort of people that do cryptic crosswords you know do them every day but there're erm there be certain things that er be always there sort of thing
S0588	yeah
S0590	you know that
S0588	yeah
S0590	one
S0588	that crop up
S0590	yes well yes
S0588	yes
S0590	if if the i i can't even remember any of them but if something be mention it it be the letter one or the number one
S0588	right
S0590	or the letter i or something
S0588	almost get its own
S0590	mean initial
S0588	code
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	so it's yeah it yes exactly
S0588	mm
S0590	it it's get a code to a a a degree
S0588	well you'd think it would have something
S0590	and there be some
S0588	to help
S0590	and obviously the way use to love what be the man who die
S0589	rufus
S0590	he like rufus actually be
S0589	araucaria
S0590	yeah what be his name
S0589	araucaria
S0590	araucaria
S0589	former vicar
S0590	yeah that's right
S0589	or reverend or something wine merchant
S0590	yeah now you see they're usually very good at do them quite a lot of vicars
S0588	so but
S0590	ecclesiastics
S0588	before you can even
S0590	latin and greek you see
S0588	oh really
S0590	yeah
S0588	before you can even start on cryptic crosswords you're gonna have to be good at basic crosswords
S0590	mm
S0588	so you must
S0590	well
S0588	be really quite advance in your
S0590	yeah yeah and i think actually the fact that clerics
S0588	brain think of word
S0590	it's no surprise that they be because of latin and greek so that
S0588	right
S0589	father select that wine
S0590	you know yes
S0588	why would latin and greek make you better
S0590	er well because of the derivation of so many english word be latin and
S0589	i think your torch be on mum
S0590	what dear
S0589	be the torch on
S0588	what so you mean
S0590	oh dear
S0589	it's very bright
S0590	oh dear
S0589	it'll run down the battery
S0590	i think i'd turn it off how do i turn it off then
S0588	if you so you mean if you know know the derivation of a word
S0590	how do i turn that thing off
S0589	you'll have to work it out dear go to settings probably
S0588	probably better if you show your mother then she'll know
S0589	no i like to try and enable
S0588	er that's another
S0589	i'm a great enabler
S0588	you're enable be you by not show her a great enabler erm talk of which you can
S0589	what do you
S0588	enable me to have another glass of wine if you want
S0589	what colour wine
S0588	there's no white leave so it'll have to be one of the colour
S0589	what do you think of that orange round thing cos darling it would like mirror this
S0588	yeah i like it a lot
S0589	oh top yourself up i'm
S0588	you you do the top up please i'm look for
S0590	it's not there
S0589	come on dear you've get to work this out so go back to your home screen so you want to go to settings which be always that thing that look like a cog
S0590	yeah i go to there press that ah flashlight
S0589	so you go to
S0590	ah right go to
S0590	right and
S0589	that's correct now weirdly that mean it's that doesn't mean it's on that mean select to turn it on
S0590	oh right well
S0589	it's a little bite counterintuitive cos when that say off it mean it be actually off not
S0590	oh right
S0589	turn it off
S0590	ah right it doesn't
S0589	okay
S0590	yeah right yeah so you press it to put it on
S0589	yeah
S0590	yeah that yeah that's like my erm kindle
S0589	yeah
S0590	the the wi fi on and wi fi off
S0589	what's the one that you always
S0590	be be very puzzle
S0589	get annoy about
S0588	erm what be we talk about
S0589	oh no have a funny recipe that say something like er unhusk twelve cardamom pod
S0588	oh god that be a classic
S0589	or something
S0588	no it this be a classic it say something like oh i'd need to see it it be something about a pod and it say discard the something discard something and i think i take it to read that you keep the bite that be
S0590	oh er right rather than the thing inside
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	no i'd need to actually know the
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	actual happen and
S0590	yeah
S0588	and the actual recipe to describe
S0590	mm
S0588	what i mean but it be a classic case of someone assume that you know what this thing be to start with because if you don't you need to be really clear or they should i always think with teach you should assume that people don't know
S0590	yeah
S0588	that er keep this part of it
S0590	yes
S0588	and discard that part of it
S0590	mm
S0588	but it wasn't clear so
S0590	yeah
S0588	i be do the opposite
S0590	yeah
S0588	and i think that you keep the bite that you're mean to
S0590	to discard yeah
S0588	yeah cos i don't know i just don't know
S0590	yeah
S0588	i haven't do it before but so
S0590	mm mm
S0588	erm i just think be really a b c about it you know number one take the thing
S0590	yes yes
S0588	break it down and then
S0590	the bite you've take off
S0588	take this bite and put it there
S0590	the outside
S0590	yeah
S0588	but there's always this well a lot of teachers or or bad teachers sort of assume that you already know certain things
S0590	yeah
S0588	and you go sorry don't know what you're talk about
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	you know just start from the very begin
S0588	but a lot of recipes well this be a recipe yeah so maybe
S0590	yeah
S0588	people should assume you know things but anyway i didn't know
S0590	mm
S0588	so i like to have it break down into bite size piece
S0590	mm yeah i be tell that i couldn't remember what it be specifically but it be something in in the i think that have all the detail about something
S0588	yeah
S0590	oh i know it be something to do with an auction
S0588	yeah
S0590	and it have all the detail but but the key information of when it be you know so
S0588	yeah
S0590	it say where it say what it's sell
S0588	yeah
S0590	et cetera et cetera et cetera
S0588	yeah
S0590	and it give no indication
S0588	no
S0590	as to when
S0588	no
S0589	well darling that be raise because as we be drive down there's a little mini roundabout just by 's and the upholsterer's there's a great big sign attach to the rail of the roundabout
S0590	oh yes
S0589	with an arrow say we be open
S0590	open

S0590	it it be
S0588	that's a perfect example really
S0590	yeah exactly we be open it say it yeah
S0588	yeah yeah but you shouldn't er it's it's like any with technology these days people assume that you already know
S0590	mm
S0588	but like with with a mobile phone or something
S0590	well

S0590	yeah
S0588	they're a bite random
S0590	yeah
S0588	mm
S0589	but boob go up and down don't they anyway
S0588	yeah
S0590	well they say that ninety percent of women wear
S0588	yeah but there it just depend on the model
S0590	the wrong size
S0588	on the model of bra you've get really
S0589	have he have his supper
S0588	no
S0590	what be you think
S0588	he's think that need a bite of rub he'll need to put his scent on it have you forgive us now for the
S0589	quiet isn't he
S0588	mm
S0590	he's an amazingly quiet cat
S0588	yes
S0590	when you think of
S0589	yeah
S0590	be it
S0589	mummy cat
S0590	yeah
S0588	ah we couldn't wish for a better cat
S0590	no you couldn't actually
S0588	he's not an annoy cat
S0590	but he's a beautiful cat as well as well actually
S0588	and sweet natured
S0590	he's neuter isn't he
S0588	he's quiet yeah
S0589	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0589	we neuter him
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah we get it free because he be a rescue cat
S0589	he have his little ball when he join us
S0590	oh right
S0588	so therefore it's free to get them neuter if you rescue a cat and i remember when we go to the vet they say well we have to wait a while to make sure the real owner's not out there somewhere so you need to put notice up
S0590	yeah
S0588	and things like that and so we sort of kind of half heartedly
S0588	put a few notice up
S0589	we didn't put any notice up but we go round
S0590	yeah
S0589	we go round to see if there be any lose
S0590	lose cat
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0589	we didn't put any find ones
S0590	right
S0588	well er we
S0589	but
S0590	well that's fair enough actually
S0589	we be worry that he might have be microchipped in which case he would have then be return
S0588	well he hadn't
S0589	would have be sad
S0588	and the collar be too small for him well i mean it's possible that
S0590	and he be thin
S0588	there be a love and he be thin but well we don't know where he come from or what happen
S0590	yeah
S0588	but if he'd be microchipped in the first place he could have be return to the owner and he wasn't microchipped so
S0590	well he's he's well i think he's very please that he wasn't return to his owner
S0588	mm
S0589	he's land on his little four paw
S0588	mm
S0589	supper supper
S0590	go on

S0590	yeah
S0588	really lucky with him
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's give me an impression of cat that's probably not not quite reality i think if i get another cat
S0590	yes

S0590	oh there be yeah there be a duck egg
S0588	maybe i'm get my colour wrong again
S0589	i think i'd like
S0590	taupe be a pinkish brown
S0588	i couldn't i could be more way more far from
S0590	duck egg
S0588	what i mean then
S0589	no i think of taupe of be greyish blue
S0588	yeah that's what i think it be
S0590	do you
S0589	family we will look this up
S0590	i think of it be a sort of buffish pink
S0588	and i pronounce be taupe be that wrong
S0590	taupe i pronounce it
S0588	taupe
S0590	taupe
S0588	oh gosh
S0589	well maybe they're two different word
S0590	i could be wrong
S0588	no but i can you can go through a lifetime say things
S0590	well you know until
S0588	in the wrong way and
S0590	until
S0588	no one actually point it out
S0590	until recently i think that the expression the hoi polloi
S0588	yeah
S0590	mean the the you know the the blue blood
S0588	the aristocracy
S0588	no what
S0590	tocracy and it's the very opposite
S0588	yeah
S0590	it's the chavs of the world
S0589	yeah
S0590	the hoi polloi
S0588	but it sound
S0589	now taupe
S0588	it sound like aristocracy though
S0590	yeah
S0588	doesn't it
S0589	taupe
S0588	but you can and then you realise all those moments where you've say completely
S0590	yeah i might have
S0588	the inappropriate thing
S0590	yes exactly
S0589	taupe be a brownish grey colour
S0590	oh well i'm think brown
S0589	it's from the french
S0590	brown
S0589	it's french mole from latin
S0588	okay we're both wrong then cos i think it be a more bluish grey
S0590	well you get the grey and i get the brown
S0588	yes exactly
S0590	we're a good team all of us
S0588	alright yeah but my mum and hence my sister say evently a lot evently now evently be not a word because you should be say
S0590	be they try to evidently
S0588	they be try to say evidently
S0590	really
S0588	and i think that evently be a word because my mum have say that
S0590	for for
S0588	forever
S0590	and which sister
S0588	she say on and evently be say that
S0590	oh
S0588	and evently the the family
S0590	oh
S0588	up the road evently evently evently evently
S0588	it's not a word and i didn't know that wasn't a word until quite recently when i've sort of be study word more closely and
S0590	and discover they'd miss i d off
S0588	actually no it be when i actually transcribe evently and it be come out underline
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's not a word
S0590	yeah
S0588	so so that must have be a quirk of my mum's that
S0590	yeah
S0588	from her family
S0590	yeah
S0588	that it sound very legitimate when i be grow up
S0590	yeah
S0588	and i think evently be as word but no they mean evidently
S0590	yeah
S0588	and then i i pull my sister up on it and i say oh
S0588	and she say no i'm mean evidently no er no no i'm say evidently and well no you're not you're say evently and she do
S0588	she say evently
S0590	yeah
S0588	so it's quite possibly to go through a lifetime say completely the wrong
S0590	the wrong thing
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	but i would have think hoi polloi sound
S0590	well i
S0588	something posh
S0590	i think it sound posh
S0588	it sound posh
S0590	exactly the hoi polloi
S0588	so it's the opposite
S0590	yeah i think i be quite amaze
S0588	of posh
S0590	in that i only discover that
S0588	yeah
S0590	i think only a year ago or so
S0588	oh well
S0589	oh well there you go
S0588	it's always good to learn
S0590	yeah i mean

S0590	yeah
S0588	perhaps they they don't want an educate person
S0590	mm
S0588	to do that
S0589	they don't
S0588	cos they'd then they'd go
S0590	what's the educational background of trump
S0588	of what
S0590	trump donald trump in america
S0588	be he oh i dunno
S0590	what it do anybody

S0588	get my head around it
S0590	i yeah i don't think there be
S0588	and i don't know enough about it anyway
S0590	yeah
S0588	cos i haven't be watch the news or anything but what where he stand erm in background and stuff what
S0590	well the the point be he have money
S0588	what would he be in the uk
S0590	yeah
S0589	well the the
S0588	erm chavvy
S0589	exact
S0590	oh you mean politically speak
S0588	a type of person in the uk
S0590	well it yeah
S0588	that he'd be
S0590	he would be extreme right wing wouldn't he
S0588	or like who would be he'd be like
S0589	well he's exactly like that er
S0588	and as a in a person
S0589	that woman that write for the daily mail or the sun that we mention last time
S0588	mm
S0589	hopkins
S0588	katie hopkins
S0589	yeah
S0590	never hear
S0588	yeah he he's quite
S0589	but of course he's fabulously wealthy
S0588	controversially similar
S0589	but then most of that wealth come from his father he's not self make
S0590	but he
S0588	but he's not gonna win be he
S0590	well the
S0589	no
S0590	the thing it be possible that he could
S0589	but it do remind one of the sixty four election when gary goldwater barry goldwater stand for the er republicans and he be a firebrand right winger
S0590	how far do he get
S0589	he get trounce by lyndon johnson in the election erm
S0590	oh right but it get up to be the nominate candidate
S0589	yeah
S0590	yeah i mean that's the thing if trump do get up that's what's worry the republicans of course that if he be up there as the the the candidate up against clinton be even more likely that it's gonna be clinton what a nightmare clinton or trump
S0588	it be isn't it
S0590	yeah
S0588	but i mean i obama be so be brilliant barack
S0590	well
S0588	but i mean in comparison to
S0590	yes
S0588	to what's on offer
S0590	yeah yeah
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	he's cool he's
S0590	even bush would be an an improvement
S0588	and that's
S0590	er
S0588	say something as well
S0590	yeah that be isn't it yeah
S0588	but i mean my goodness that's terrible that there's
S0590	but this be why
S0588	all these people that you could potentially choose from
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	and they're the ones that be
S0590	yeah but the terrible thing about american politics be you need money
S0588	yeah that be terrible isn't it
S0590	despite and this be what trump have in barrow load you see
S0588	that's awful
S0590	so he's get absolutely money i mean he's a
S0588	yeah
S0590	billion billionaire
S0588	yeah
S0590	erm but anyway i just wonder what sort of educational background he have
S0588	and you'd think that america be america though that they'd cos they're all about the freedom of the individual and democracy and
S0590	yeah mm
S0588	you'd think that they'd have some system that
S0590	prevent this yeah
S0588	make it that it's not prerequisite
S0590	yeah
S0588	be that the right word
S0590	yeah prerequisite
S0588	to prerequisite yeah
S0590	prerequisite yeah that it yeah
S0588	i get the emphasis wrong
S0590	that it yeah that it it would
S0588	prerequisite
S0590	yeah that you
S0588	to erm
S0590	that you need money but i suppose the americans be quite open about the fact that you need money british you you know
S0588	they're quite happy about it
S0590	british politics
S0588	aren't they
S0590	yeah you know there be all these
S0588	yeah
S0590	under the counter
S0588	they're a bite more
S0590	they're totally open
S0588	seem to be quite ashamed of themselves
S0590	yeah
S0588	in many respect
S0590	yeah
S0588	and a bite embarrass
S0590	yeah
S0588	about money
S0590	yeah
S0588	really
S0590	but i mean it i mean in british politics they couldn't get a lot of them couldn't get where they do get without the back of
S0588	yeah
S0590	various people who
S0588	it come down to that
S0590	donate you know two hundred thousand or two million
S0588	mm
S0590	to the such and such party er you know and off it go
S0588	what do you think on jeremy corbyn
S0590	well i think in a way he's improve
S0588	i think so
S0590	you know he's he's just sit there
S0588	yeah
S0590	quietly the little
S0588	yeah
S0590	tortoise in the hare and tortoise race
S0588	he
S0590	he's
S0588	he's a wonderful erm opposition
S0590	yes yes
S0588	and we need an opposition
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	and i think it's great
S0590	yeah
S0588	that we've get an opposition
S0590	yeah yeah yeah
S0588	at last because it be like two of the same
S0590	yes it be exactly
S0588	really it be like
S0590	the exactly the same cradle and
S0588	what do you choose
S0590	yeah exactly
S0588	either
S0590	yeah
S0588	they're both
S0590	exactly the same
S0588	yeah
S0590	whereas yeah this this
S0588	and now it be
S0590	man be quite different
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	and i i don't remember it be different
S0590	yeah
S0588	for since
S0590	yeah
S0588	and this be show my age but since the nineteen seventies when there be a difference
S0590	well show my age i can't even remember what be go on in the seventies
S0588	well in
S0590	yeah who
S0588	in politics when there be a a difference between the leave and the right
S0590	oh right yeah oh right who who be around in the seventies i can't even remember that actually
S0588	and it be socialism as
S0590	yeah
S0588	in the old
S0590	yeah oh yes yes
S0588	old fashion socialism
S0590	yeah kinnock and people
S0588	which be
S0590	yeah
S0588	really different to
S0590	yeah
S0588	right wing politics
S0590	yeah all that change with dear blair
S0588	erm so and then it all break down and become
S0590	really with the advent of tony blair
S0588	similarish
S0590	tony blair
S0588	really the same kind of outlook really
S0590	mm
S0588	which be i don't know i think that it it just margaret thatcher do something to change it so fundamentally that you couldn't have socialism any more maybe don't know
S0590	mm
S0588	might be just talk bollocks here cos i'm not an expert in politics but it's er it's quite nostalgic jeremy corbyn
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	cos he's like really old style
S0590	it's
S0588	opposition
S0590	yeah
S0588	where he's
S0590	and he's sensible he do
S0590	replace the swim pool centre erm
S0588	there's no swim pool
S0590	just beyond the arsenal well no a bite beyond the arsenal
S0588	no this be
S0590	no no that
S0588	that's
S0590	er it's not actually here
S0588	it's a different thing
S0590	yeah
S0588	but it's all a bite political because
S0590	yeah
S0588	they do a consultation and they instead of listen to the answer they cherry pick the answer and make out the answer that people give be what they're say that this be what local people want but it's not actually what local people want local people say they want sort of café facilities er improve leisure facilities cos there's this gym that's really badly maintain and
S0590	yeah
S0588	fall to piece erm it's just insidiously clever cos they've take the answer and they've come up with this
S0590	yeah
S0588	solution
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it's not what people say
S0590	yeah
S0588	and people say they want to create a new hub a community hub in one of the build which they the council be now say they want to sell off and so what they've do be they've they cherry pick the answer and they make out that's what local people say but it's not what local people
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	say at all and they certainly didn't say all in all but the front façade demolish the library
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	erm which be what they're gonna do really
S0590	and do away do and be they go to do away with the library be they
S0588	no the library
S0590	no
S0588	will still be there so it's not like say if you say save library that's not
S0590	yeah
S0588	the right way to put it
S0590	mm
S0588	it's the build that need to be save
S0590	yeah yeah yeah
S0588	so i've kind of contemplate a petition but then i don't know whether to wait until the plan be further on and see what they're actually specifically plan so i can then put a very definite thing that the petition's
S0590	yeah
S0588	about
S0590	a petition specifically to the plan
S0588	specifically because
S0590	yeah
S0588	at the moment it's a big vague because i don't actually know exactly
S0590	what's gonna be behind the façade
S0588	because they're so
S0590	yeah
S0588	kind of smoke and daggers really
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	and there be a plan but then that's mean to be modify because the build get list the build be list only kind of six days before this plan be vote through
S0590	yeah what list do it have
S0588	erm
S0590	grade two or
S0588	i think it's grade two
S0590	yeah
S0588	and so now they're say that the plan will be change
S0590	yeah because of the list
S0588	to take into but council also have a history of
S0590	yeah
S0588	not bother with grade two list and just demolish build anyway so there's that
S0590	yeah
S0588	to consider and i don't know i if i start a petition now it might be a bite early it's almost like i need to know exactly what's plan because the plan be sort of evolve the whole time
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	it's really hard to sort of be specific and say it's all very well to say say no to this but i wanna say say no to what exactly
S0590	yeah
S0588	cos
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	erm
S0590	would you do that online
S0588	and it would be an online petition and it wouldn't make any difference but the point be cos they'll go ahead and do it anyway
S0590	yeah
S0588	but the point be to have a
S0590	who's your mp
S0588	i can't i don't know the name but i've get email address
S0590	yeah be he be he a conservative here or what
S0588	i think they're labour here
S0590	yeah they probably be actually yeah
S0588	erm yeah so
S0590	yeah
S0588	not sure
S0590	the next thing you must do be something about the dustbins
S0588	that's gonna be really hard i don't think there's anything that can be do about that
S0590	no
S0588	erm cos people's mind set be still be now think there's a bin outside and
S0590	dump it in yeah
S0588	yeah and half the people probably don't understand the way things use to be where
S0590	yeah
S0588	you keep your rubbish in your house until bin day and then
S0590	yeah
S0588	put it out
S0590	yeah
S0588	so erm i mean on i kind of make a a point on one thread i can't remember what it be about exactly but then some woman say yeah but where do you put your dirty nappies and stuff
S0590	yeah
S0588	well you didn't always have those green bin out the front of your house
S0590	you didn't no
S0588	you just keep it you be responsible until bin day and then
S0590	yeah
S0588	you put it out so wherever you keep it be up to you but
S0590	yeah
S0588	and especially if you've get a garden
S0590	yeah exactly and actually i i don't
S0588	you know
S0590	days go by you use to wash them anyway
S0588	well exactly yeah
S0590	you yeah exactly
S0588	but you know
S0590	you know terry nappies
S0588	it's like what uh
S0590	yeah
S0588	so and i explain very clearly well biodegradable vegetable waste go in the compost
S0590	yeah
S0588	other waste go in the black bin in the garden until bin day and then it all go out the front
S0590	mm
S0588	mm but that would be a change of mind set now so i don't think that's
S0590	yeah
S0588	even possible
S0590	yeah and you you're er the rubbish get collect once a week doesn't it
S0588	yeah
S0590	we i mean you've get an amazingly efficient rubbish collection system here
S0588	yeah that's
S0590	yeah
S0588	that's okay
S0590	because down in we get food waste collect every week
S0588	oh do you
S0590	yeah and we have a
S0588	okay
S0590	little a little bin for food waste
S0588	do you use the food waste one thing
S0590	yeah because well we do set up a compost thing but then and get a bite
S0588	you couldn't do it
S0590	fluster about it they say it attract the rat
S0588	okay so not worth the hassle
S0590	and so well we weren't
S0588	yeah
S0590	we weren't go to upset and
S0588	yeah
S0590	so we we give the the compost bin actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	but erm but the they compost it all anyway
S0588	yeah yeah
S0590	you know the council do that
S0588	absolutely
S0590	and then one week they collect erm landfill stuff
S0588	mm
S0590	and the next week they collect the plastics and the bottle and the cardboard the recyclable stuff so it's it's quite
S0588	oh that's quite complicate
S0590	quite yeah yeah yeah
S0588	gotta have a calendar of exactly
S0590	yeah you do yeah
S0588	gosh that's it's a lot simpler here
S0590	you yeah once you get use to it
S0588	you just put them out
S0590	it work because you know you've send all the recyclable this way
S0588	but actually in your area that would
S0590	yeah
S0588	work fine because
S0590	yeah
S0588	cos people be intelligent enough to
S0590	well yeah yeah
S0588	get a calendar and
S0590	and remember
S0590	mark it down and
S0590	yeah yeah yeah
S0588	yeah whereas here you get people who don't know how to handle rubbish at all
S0590	yeah you see that mean we only get bottle for instance collect once a fortnight and in a fortnight we collect
S0588	quite a few bottle
S0590	yeah we occasionally pass them up to 's house actually when they're
S0590	the collection's due so
S0588	sneaky
S0590	so they're not outside ours
S0590	or just
S0588	it's embarrass
S0590	she just have a she have just as many as us and of course periodically we go to the dump
S0588	yeah
S0590	most people go to the dump with an awful lot of stuff
S0588	mm
S0590	but again it go back to what we be talk about last night the individual's responsibility they don't
S0588	well again
S0590	they they don't think
S0588	that's another one it's like
S0590	you know they put it in a bucket and it go
S0588	yeah someone deal with it
S0590	end of it
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah well god know we're all responsible for our
S0590	yeah
S0588	but that's also the supermarket's fault and the culture of wrap everything up
S0590	yeah well they've do well with the plastic bag
S0588	and the package culture yeah
S0590	business actually
S0588	at least that's one thing that i can say
S0590	yeah
S0588	that this government that's do that's good
S0590	yeah
S0588	only one thing that i can think of
S0590	yeah
S0588	that be of benefit
S0588	to the earth
S0590	yeah
S0588	or life in general be that
S0590	plastic bag
S0588	really and make people aware that this be not free
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's not free
S0590	yeah
S0588	it doesn't matter if you
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	get give them it's not free
S0590	mind you we we miss those plastic bag because we've always take our own shoppers always but we do collect plastic bag we use them to line waste paper baskets
S0588	that's what i use them for
S0590	we use them to collect ash
S0588	yeah
S0590	and now we've we've actually have to buy plastic bag
S0588	well no i've have to actually i've get to buy plastic bag
S0590	yeah in
S0588	for that
S0590	yes
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah but
S0588	rather negate the whole point in a way
S0590	yeah but certainly all our plastic bag that we get from any supermarket be put to use
S0588	no but the point be
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's make people think about it
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it's just a bite it's only five p on your shop as well and people be kind of i find that's a bite weird that oh five p oh i'm go to bring a bag
S0590	yes
S0588	so it obviously that five p have work really well
S0590	yeah because it's quite
S0588	so it's good cos it's make people
S0590	you know for one plastic bag it's quite a lot of money
S0588	think about it but it's just the point of
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	that fact that you have to pay for it
S0590	yeah
S0588	that have get into people's brain
S0590	yeah
S0588	and that's good but i personally think it should be fifty p
S0590	yeah
S0588	if you're gonna do that then the cost be whatever that would really work if it be fifty p
S0590	yeah then there would be no no bag
S0588	yeah no
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	you'd never just not forget your bag
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah why not if you're gonna do that
S0590	yeah
S0588	do it all the way
S0590	because we we occasionally have find out well actually we always keep things in the car big bag in the car but just occasionally we've pass somewhere and spontaneously go in
S0588	yes exactly
S0590	and and
S0588	it's the spontaneous thing
S0590	have a look and then buy some things and have to
S0588	that catch you out yeah
S0590	a plastic bag and it's always be useful because we've always use it
S0588	mm it's always the spontaneous shop
S0590	yeah
S0588	that catch me out but the trick be to always have one in your handbag a carrier bag in your handbag
S0590	keep one in his pocket
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	and i think the most beneficial aspect of the five p charge be it will make people just never go out without a bag
S0590	yeah
S0588	and so that must have reduce it
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	quite significantly
S0590	hugely actually
S0588	by at least
S0590	yeah
S0588	a quarter
S0590	yeah well it think
S0588	i'd have think
S0590	much more than that actually really
S0588	yeah
S0590	because
S0588	probably more
S0590	yeah cos certainly down in our neck of the woods most people go into a shop with bag
S0588	yeah well er i think they probably do anyway
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	where you live
S0590	well
S0588	less so where
S0590	yeah but of course up here people go in their car really do they
S0588	what here
S0590	yeah
S0588	i don't
S0590	well no i don't know maybe not
S0588	no
S0590	no
