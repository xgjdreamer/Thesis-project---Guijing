S0013	yeah yeah
S0012	awful
S0152	no they build house they build flats on there so
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and er we get one we get one in wales and one in er
S0013	yeah
S0012	but er they're run by managers full full time
S0013	but they be talk about get one on the broads which'd be nice if there be one you know
S0012	yeah a new one
S0012	talk about get a new one
S0013	do one there cos it be sparse round east anglia though i dunno
S0152	yeah
S0013	and that would be a a good area to do one really
S0012	well there's only two youth hostels in the whole of norfolk
S0152	so what and
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	mm
S0013	mm they do have but that be a rubbish one where be it well we never go in it but it's just a
S0012	no we never go there
S0013	just a house on the street you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	it's gotta be it's gotta be different hasn't it
S0152	yeah it gotta have some
S0013	you can't just have yeah yeah
S0152	and they've gotta and they unfortunately now they've gotta have things like wifi in there and then
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah they've gotta wifi they gotta have all that sorta stuff
S0013	and now we're go to have to make bed
S0012	and now they want us to make instead of put all the
S0012	the linen out they want
S0152	they want you to make them
S0012	us to make
S0013	i write to them and say we don't usually get out till about one anyway
S0012	no time we've do all our chores
S0013	erm if we've gotta make all the bed as well you know that's gonna it's not easy
S0152	that's that's the whole point of it
S0012	i don't know if they can
S0013	especially bunk bed
S0152	yeah
S0013	to do
S0012	yeah
S0013	especially the bottom sheet
S0152	and yeah yeah yeah
S0013	erm
S0012	i don't know whether they're go to do it yet not for volunteer
S0013	but we be tell they're gonna come in next year
S0012	next year yeah
S0013	but we be send a little thing say what do we think
S0012	but we say i say no might we might consider not do it
S0013	put our we think a lot of things will er go down cos it's it's
S0152	that's a lot of stuff to do
S0012	well if you've gotta make twenty odd bed a day you know if people be move out
S0152	with quilt with quilt and cover and
S0012	yeah
S0152	if you have quilt cover and things
S0012	yeah so i can't see i can't see volunteer volunteer much much more
S0152	mm
S0012	and maybe this be a ploy to get the ones that have have to be volunteer shut down
S0013	but they're lot they can't shut down can they
S0012	yeah some of them they can't shut down they've get to be youth hostels
S0012	they can't sell them they can't do anything with them i think the one at
S0012	er have get a covenant on that if
S0013	mm
S0012	they try to sell it they can only get a pound for it
S0152	right
S0012	because that be give by these this particular person as a youth hostel to keep it as a youth hostel
S0152	yeah
S0012	you know
S0013	but the ones that have erm national trust quite a lot of the national trust have take them back again now haven't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	you know what for really but
S0012	but some of them
S0013	it's a shame
S0152	they'll make money they'll make more money out of them
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	national trust will make more money out of them
S0012	yeah they would
S0152	their
S0013	yeah
S0152	national trust cottages be expensive
S0013	yeah
S0012	they be yeah
S0013	so they're only on lease for the moment
S0012	well some some of the youth hostels have be take over by private people people like you and i and be still run them as an affiliation to
S0013	mm
S0012	the youth hostel association
S0013	they're still on the yha book if you like
S0012	mm yeah but course
S0013	which would be quite nice if we
S0012	i mean we do go in where where's that one we go in that that need an awful amount of work i think the that be all stone cottages type thing weren't it
S0013	erm
S0012	very damp and they they just couldn't afford to put the money into it
S0013	at
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah it's only that be only twelve bed that one
S0012	that be only twelve bed that
S0013	right in the middle of the woods
S0012	in the middle of the the weren't it
S0013	lovely it's a lovely cottage
S0012	yeah
S0013	lovely cottage
S0013	but er
S0012	god it need work
S0013	because the wall how they be there's all these creepy for
S0012	yeah
S0013	all spiders and that they can't unless they skim over them which would spoil the look of the cottage
S0012	yeah
S0013	you know they there's not much they can do really
S0152	couldn't they can that'd take a long time time cos
S0012	yeah
S0152	they'd have to yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but er that would've take well i mean there be more spiders in that place than you've ever see in your life if anybody come in there
S0013	there's so many spiders it's a good job we weren't frighten of spiders there be load
S0012	i mean there be spiders everywhere cos there be all these little hole in the wall
S0013	well just a
S0152	that's what it's for though innit
S0013	old stone
S0012	yeah
S0013	cottage
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah that's what it's for
S0012	brilliant place we like it didn't we
S0013	yes we do well
S0012	walk in the forest every day
S0013	yeah
S0012	you couldn't get lose there because the a3 go straight past the or
S0013	yeah we didn't know about that
S0012	but you could hear it when we be in the woods so you know where
S0013	yeah
S0012	you could hear but they now put a tunnel underneath it so that er that
S0013	be it big enough no
S0012	yeah so the the whole become bigger they're take up the road and they've put a tunnel underneath it yeah
S0152	yeah it's amaze what they can do don't know if you've see the do you watch that programme about the cross link er tube line they put in
S0012	the tube line yeah i saw someone but yeah
S0152	ah amaze
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	absolutely amaze
S0012	yeah
S0152	all the tunnel be now dig
S0012	yeah and er
S0013	oh
S0152	they're all dig and they're just he's gonna take another two year another three years to kick them all out now
S0012	yeah
S0152	lay all the track and everything
S0012	cor that's fantastic though ain't it
S0013	mm
S0152	great big bore machine the way that it do it
S0012	they're huge
S0013	yeah
S0012	they and and they they keep put concrete
S0152	and and you have and you have keystone at the end of it
S0012	yeah
S0152	amaze i cos i show cos i've be make structure so a bridge an arch bridge
S0012	oh yeah
S0152	and the so the idea be the accuracy that they have to bend the paper they have to fold it
S0013	oh right
S0152	and then they have to make the keystone to put in and then we put weight on to see
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	what isn't
S0012	yeah
S0152	and what happen if you don't have the pillar either side
S0012	that's it yeah
S0152	in the thing and then i'd see
S0013	mm
S0152	something on tv about it and it show them put the big concrete block in and they say and the last concrete box be the keystone that keep them all together
S0012	all together yeah
S0152	so i show them that old technology's still be use
S0012	yeah
S0152	even now
S0012	yes it be yeah
S0013	right
S0012	yeah
S0152	but they some of the areas they have to drain them cos
S0012	yeah
S0152	there's so much water behind they have to put great big tap in
S0012	yeah they've and everywhere haven't they
S0152	to take the water way
S0013	yeah
S0152	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	amaze
S0012	yeah
S0152	and they they come across an an old arch
S0012	they've come across a burial grind too haven't they
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	which they think be the
S0012	yeah
S0152	but there be this arch somewhere well somewhere near canary wharf i think and it be a brick arch er but it wasn't wide enough so they have to widen it
S0012	oh right
S0152	but when they start when they start to widen it they find another arch on top of it
S0012	oh crikey
S0013	oh
S0152	and we think you could just like get a kango hammer and take it all out
S0012	yeah
S0152	it take longer to get out because the way the concrete be make and the pressure that'd be put on
S0012	yeah
S0152	have really make it tight and it just wouldn't just wouldn't snap
S0012	wouldn't budge no
S0013	no
S0152	and then there be one bite that go under the dock where this be and they literally have to drain that section of the dock
S0012	do they
S0152	so that they could put
S0152	the new tunnel in to extend it
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it's one of the big exos exhibition centre down there and so they after the boat show all the boat leave they put they drain this section there's there's a special name for it and they have six months to do it in so that the next show that need water
S0152	could be use which be like a military show where
S0013	wow
S0152	army boat navy boat go up etcetera
S0152	and they just do it on time and it be all because this bridge this arch be so strong they couldn't get it out cos they keep pull other things
S0012	couldn't get it out
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	gosh
S0152	they're i mean absolutely amaze
S0012	when be that build
S0152	eighteen something
S0012	yeah
S0152	it be and it use to have old erm horse draw train go down it
S0012	be it down by brunel or something like that
S0152	something like that yeah
S0012	yeah cos he be a fantastic engineer weren't he
S0152	but it be like and it's get it's get a name and it be just this use so they've use some of that but they show you bore into erm liverpool street station
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm well they break into there and they also break into canary wharf station and the how they've build canary wharf station they build it in different platforms and you gotta all the ventilation into account
S0012	yeah you have yeah
S0152	all the escalators where they go
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	literally
S0012	yeah
S0152	amaze piece of engineer and they're like a millimetre out after they'd go all that way and you're think
S0012	yes yeah that be like the channel tunnel
S0013	yeah
S0012	they be dig that way they be dig that way and they be they be literally
S0152	yeah
S0012	millimetres out
S0152	yeah
S0012	when they dig when they meet each other
S0152	amaze amaze
S0013	mm
S0152	and it's just so many people work on it
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know so many people work on the whole line
S0012	fantastic innit i mean when you think about the work and the and the brain that go into it all
S0152	you know and there's a guy who this be gonna be his last tunnel but he's work do tunnel for the last something like fifty odd years sixty odd years
S0012	wow
S0013	yes
S0152	and his sons be into it as well
S0012	yeah
S0152	and he's he's the what the last one that he build like the jubilee line and
S0012	yeah
S0152	help build that and a couple of other
S0013	yeah
S0152	so but he's it's the biggest engineer project in europe
S0012	be it
S0013	be it
S0152	at the moment

S0012	cos the er connect
S0152	connect you get connect and first direct
S0012	connect yeah
S0152	it depend on
S0012	er most of them be subsidise by the the council cos the all the new bus station be do and you've be to that bus station
S0152	yeah yeah it's a nice bus station
S0012	it use to be such a hole
S0152	all bus station use to be like that haven't they

S0012	do you
S0152	for use machinery again
S0012	oh gawd
S0013	oh
S0152	when i do my health and safety train for my machinery certificate you have to do things on them
S0012	yeah
S0152	you have to be able to set the lathe up
S0012	yeah
S0152	you have to use to be able to set the mill machine up
S0012	yeah
S0152	er bench drill pillar drill band saw circular saw you use to have to set it up you use to have to change the blades or change the cutters right that be all part of the test
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you get your certificate to say you could do that and and anything else right yesterday's be guy come what experience have you get blah blah blah blah blah blah and it's a form that you tick to say that you you're sign up to say that you can use this you can do that you can do the other
S0012	what
S0152	and he go through it he go through it and he say right the band saw how d'you use the band saw well you don't set the depth you keep it this low and you right how d'you change the blade so he do get the people that hadn't do it before he show them how to change the blade
S0012	oh right
S0152	and do it because i'd do it cos i be say to the gotta teach some materials well it's all well and good have this little bite but unless you do it all the time you ain't gonna overcome problems
S0012	no you're not no
S0152	you know if you make a if a kid make a mistake on something you've gotta think quite quickly how to put that mistake right
S0012	yeah
S0152	if you don't have the experience you get no chance
S0012	no chance
S0152	and i just think and he he be go so he say right hand tool right tenon saw right he say you have your bench hook get your pencil and you mark across the across the wood with your pencil where you're gonna cut he say and then you get your hacksaw er your your tenon saw and you hold it like this and you pull back and i go oh say don't use a mark knife
S0152	of course they be like
S0013	yeah
S0152	i say because if you use the mark knife where you've actually mark
S0012	you've good start
S0152	you've get a good start for when you put your tenon saw in
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you've actually get somewhere the er tenon saw can go in and it be like oh er
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	and of course for the people that don't know how to do it it be like
S0013	yeah
S0152	well maybe just a pencil i go yeah but if you use the mark knife
S0012	yeah
S0152	you'd get a you it make it easier for the kid to start
S0012	yeah
S0152	then of course it's like oh couldn't give the kid a mark knife cos they'd be do damage and whatever no because if you're teach them properly they won't be do the damage
S0012	yeah
S0152	they will be use them like they should be use them
S0013	mm
S0152	and then he go he say right he then he say about erm a gauge mark gauge so he get a mark gauge out the cupboard
S0012	uhu
S0152	and i go and i though oh i'm not gonna say anything here cos this be just not right so he go and this mark gauge this be how you adjust it and these two pin here and i'm think go on keep go keep go because a normal mark gauge only have one pin on
S0012	yeah that have yeah yeah
S0152	a mortise gauge have two pin because you set the size of your mortise
S0012	your mortise yeah
S0152	on your pin
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you and then this one guy's oh that's only if you're go across the grain isn't it
S0012	oh
S0152	mm well if you're do a mortise and tenon the tenon usually be along the grain across along the grain not across it
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos you're mark the edge so you can mark it anywhere to get a a line
S0012	course you can
S0013	yeah
S0152	and i just think oh this be this be painful this be
S0013	yeah
S0152	tick tick tick tick tick
S0012	yeah
S0152	and and that's all
S0013	yeah
S0152	that's train what we have to have i go have you get our have you get our number d'you need us to sign any any bits of paper and he go no no we've get all the detail there's cos i only do mine round about four years ago
S0012	yeah
S0152	update mine four years ago
S0013	yeah
S0152	cos i get quite a few and he say find i need to find all those out put them all together so
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	well i never
S0013	mm
S0012	but when when er i i have a woodwork teacher mr he he say you can you either use a mark gauge or you can do it like this and you clamp the piece of wood onto the piece that you wanna cut cut and that
S0152	you keep you keep the edge against it
S0012	keep the edge up against it and you
S0152	yeah
S0012	and it's wonderful job
S0012	it run off at all
S0152	no and then he then he be talk about chisel
S0012	oh right
S0152	i though well go on show her how to chisel
S0152	don't just talk about it show us how to chisel and he be like and i think bet you don't even know the name of that chisel you've get out there
S0152	i do like say i do like say you know what what chisel be that one there
S0013	mm
S0152	and it be like well it be a firmer chisel cos it'd get a it wasn't a bevel edge chisel
S0012	no
S0152	and it be like mm okay well show them how to it then you know need to be show how to do it
S0012	yeah
S0152	that's what she need the train on
S0012	yeah but he didn't
S0152	eh
S0012	he didn't show her
S0152	no
S0012	no
S0152	but she have to do the band saw and it be like oh oh oh
S0012	mm mm
S0013	oh
S0152	but it be and then the and the scroll saw the hegner saw
S0152	that look dangerous and i go no you'll be alright with that
S0013	mm
S0012	a scroll saw
S0152	yeah like most saw yeah the hegner saw good er good hegner saw you can do lot of intricate shape on it and stuff like that
S0012	you can yeah yeah yeah
S0152	load and load
S0012	yeah
S0152	so then we go to the and the band saw sheet you've get two box you've get band saw circular saw radial saw erm and there's another one well we don't have a radial saw i mean i know that cos we have a band saw and a circular saw so i just tick them all
S0013	yeah
S0152	and i go i'm sorry i've tick the circular one say next time not a problem say just don't sign it then
S0152	cos you'd have to sign this one next time but i've do the competency on
S0152	cos he make me he make me use the band saw
S0012	do he
S0152	yeah
S0012	oh right
S0152	yeah to cut a piece of pipe
S0012	oh that be easy enough
S0152	oh it be so difficult
S0012	you make it difficult do you
S0013	yeah
S0152	i do everything i could to make it see if he'd notice what i do wrong but he didn't
S0012	no
S0013	oh
S0152	i watch the guy use a push stick now i be always teach that a push stick you have that nice v shape in it
S0012	yeah
S0152	so you can put it on the edge of the wood
S0012	that's it
S0152	but if you're push it through that way you can turn it on its side
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	and hold the corner
S0012	yeah
S0152	and push and like and maybe have two push stick
S0012	yeah
S0152	like that
S0012	do you do it
S0152	yeah course i do
S0152	course i do cos i turn it on its side like that so that the v shape be on the edge of the wood that you be push through make it easier that way
S0012	oh right yeah
S0152	rather than on the top because it get in the way
S0012	it do yeah
S0152	and then we have to do a bite of on the
S0012	yeah
S0152	band saw well depend how wide that blade be depend on how much that
S0012	that that's about half an inch wide well three three eights of an inch or whatever
S0152	and it be like you know well i can't really scroll on this because the saw blade's too wide
S0012	yeah
S0152	i say this be really just for cut straight down and then there be the the sand disc and if it get clog up i didn't learn i do actually learn something which be quite good i do actually learn one thing
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah i do learn one thing
S0012	what declogging the sand disc
S0152	well i know how to declog it cos you can buy a special soap that you
S0012	yeah you can
S0152	and like a rubber that you can put on
S0012	yeah
S0152	which clog it but if you haven't get that i've always use a piece of perspex
S0012	yeah oh right
S0152	and just gently put the piece of perspex on
S0012	yeah
S0152	but he do say that can actually catch fire
S0012	do he
S0152	yeah
S0012	oh right
S0152	he say because what happen be the bits of plastic that come off that come off
S0013	mm
S0152	which a little bite of a thing
S0012	yeah
S0152	be hot so therefore go down into the vacuum chamber they can
S0012	yeah
S0152	go off way so
S0012	when we use to file our file deburr or whatever aluminium that can clog up a file ever so easily
S0152	oh yeah
