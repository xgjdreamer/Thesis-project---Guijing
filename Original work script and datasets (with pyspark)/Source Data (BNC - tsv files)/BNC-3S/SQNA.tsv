S0417	so what's your favourite subject at the minute
S0416	erm i like i like math and i like pe i like science and erm try to think of the subject now i like religion
S0417	do you
S0416	mm just because it's like erm not really too hard it's just quite easy really
S0417	yeah
S0416	erm so yeah what be your favourite subject when you be at school
S0417	erm i be a good all rounder so er yeah so i be okay at maths i wouldn't say i would have like maths but i think i probably do i just i like english
S0416	oh yeah i like english as well
S0417	i love art i really love art actually
S0416	mm yeah i mean to add those to to my to my list but i couldn't really think of them
S0417	mm i like photography
S0416	mm
S0417	i mean sorry i like geography
S0416	oh
S0417	we don't they didn't each photography at school
S0416	yeah
S0417	and i think i probably could have like science and i think i do but i didn't really cos i always think oh i like english and art and kind of ignore the rest but you know i could have just as well go into science actually i do geology
S0416	mm
S0417	i be really i mean i do geology a level which be a weird subject but
S0416	mm
S0417	to pick and i do sport but i wasn't really into them but i be good at them and i be always be make a sport captain of my form and
S0416	that's good
S0417	i be kind of lucky actually to be honest look back i be lucky i be kind of naturally okay at most things at school and i really like it
S0416	you know most of the girls they they hate sport
S0417	mm
S0416	like they really hate the like get a note to go out of pe
S0417	mm
S0416	right because just cos she say she didn't like it
S0417	she can't do that
S0416	i know
S0417	i mean she's
S0416	they're not really gonna have well it be call physical education and you're not really gonna have as much fitness
S0417	mm
S0416	if you don't do pe
S0417	no you would have think their parent would kind of encourage that more because do load of sport and he's really active and their mum use to she use to teach she use to be like a gym instructor person as well so you would have think both
S0416	say that erm cos be like how do mum let you off and then she be like she be like i i just say i didn't like and then she say she didn't like it either
S0417	oh
S0416	so like say she didn't like sport as well
S0417	that's not kind of encourage your kid to
S0416	mm
S0417	and yet she that's the basically her job be to teach sport well not sport as it be i suppose gym stuff
S0416	i just don't really know how you could hate sport
S0417	sorry
S0416	i just don't really understand hate sport
S0417	well i think they
S0416	i can understand on the fitness thing or like it might be really quite challenge like in gymnastics
S0417	do you want some dinner look it's
S0416	gymnastics be i think he think i be just mess or doss or whatever but i like it be the the things we have to do it's really hard and like he come over to you and you're like
S0417	who think you be mess
S0416	erm the teacher
S0417	oh
S0416	er gymnastics guy
S0417	mm
S0416	and he come in and kind of like put you in the position and i have to kind of like push myself back up cos it be like
S0417	mm
S0416	otherwise it be gonna really hurt from down i just don't really think they realise like
S0417	he doesn't sound like the best teacher ever to be honest
S0416	i don't think he realise how erm like like he's he's that's his job and he's be do that for
S0417	i know
S0416	probably his whole life
S0417	i know some people be good at just like their sport but they're not good teachers be they
S0416	yeah
S0417	do you want to come and eat well do you not like the next video that's come on do you want a cookie do you want a cookie
S0418	cookie
S0417	okay mm it's quite a
S0416	mm
S0417	i just think it's i think they're a bite strange sometimes their parent i think there's a bite maybe a bite play off against each other because there's other time where she's refuse to not let them go to school if they be sick and that kind of thing but i dunno god know or maybe because be upset about the weekend and you know sometimes the other parent can be like don't worry i'm the nice one i'll let you off do you know what i mean or i might be wrong i'm not not try to stir up too much i be a little though i suppose but yeah no i think in a way they're they're lucky erm and because they they seem to be slightly build more like tall and skinny but erm you've gotta watch it cos it's er about the teenage years that if you don't do any sport at all you you could become unhealthy and put on weight and things and
S0416	i do load of sport
S0417	no i'm just no i'm not say you i'm say one like anyone
S0416	oh right
S0417	i'm just say in the teenage years if you become a bite too fat i suppose basically in your teenage years er then it that must be that must be horrible for it's do you know what i mean it's so it's so hard anyway and so self conscious and especially for girls who wanna be pretty and everything but i think these be the years where it be important to be active even if you don't do it for the rest of your life because it's apparently as well if you be quite active when you be young then even if you don't do so much in the the rest of your life it still make you healthier than
S0416	mm
S0417	if you're somebody who's never do anything and then doesn't do anything later
S0416	right super like like weird but i think like i love i totally take advantage of like come and do sport because like i mean like for for you you're get like
S0417	mm
S0416	free free rugby and things
S0417	yeah
S0416	and that's like really good for you
S0417	yeah
S0416	and it's
S0417	we do have to pay a hundred euros but yes that rugby
S0416	yeah
S0417	not free generally but
S0416	yeah but it's like free for me if you know what i mean
S0417	mm
S0416	and like
S0417	i know what you mean
S0416	thank thank you
S0417	no no it's okay
S0416	yeah
S0417	well it's part of my job to be able to like give you these opportunities as well i know it's not always easy but so some things be just you know i don't think it's okay to sort of like oh just wait until you're eighteen and then you can do some sport it's too late then isn't it
S0416	mm
S0417	you kind of have to do it now i have to find money from somewhere just do it it's erm it's a priority really
S0416	like i really enjoy rugby and gymnastics
S0417	yeah and they're both very hard i'm very proud of you for do both of them actually
S0416	thank you
S0417	i mean at the end of the year you might want to review and see like do i still carry on with the gymnastics do i still carry on with the rugby it's er i think if you give things at least a year you usually even though rugby be it be quite rough isn't it i i'm find it a little bite hard to be the mum like oh
S0416	i know i mean er well well
S0417	you're like you're cover in bruise
S0416	well rugby be the hardest sport for mums but it's the best sport for me
S0417	i know it's just you're not like a huge big lad either or with like a great bite skull on your head
S0416	which be
S0417	do you know what i mean
S0416	you know that's good
S0417	be it but
S0416	yeah because back they're not like i mean they get tackle but not like the forward do
S0417	be that be a forward
S0416	er he be a forward but now they've put him into the back for no apparent reason
S0417	oh
S0416	he's just a back really
S0417	you're not gonna get put forward ever be you
S0416	no
S0417	i think if you get put forward i might have to just say stop
S0416	there's one guy smaller than me on forward but he choose to go on forward like he really want to be on forward but i mean there be better people that be and they're in forward
S0417	yeah it's quite mad forward isn't it
S0416	if you every hear of like a spear tackle it's when you get
S0417	er do i really wanna know
S0416	no not really
S0417	i don't think i er wanna know
S0416	okay but be a forward be just a lot more rough
S0417	yeah
S0416	be a back
S0417	still a bite rough though
S0416	yeah
S0417	oh be you gonna cover me i'm gonna just get do you want to sit up here sit on the chair love you're eat
S0416	to be honest most of the bruise
S0416	be from my teammates
S0417	yeah
S0416	that's how i do it
S0417	why be they all on your legs
S0416	because when you when you get when you have the ball then when you get tackle that doesn't give you anybody
S0417	any room maybe a small little that's it
S0417	yeah
S0416	when you're on the grind
S0416	people have to go and step over you and steal the ball
S0418	chewbacca
S0416	and mum there's two people above you
S0418	bacca
S0416	chewbacca then there's two there's two people above you
S0418	two
S0416	yeah there's
S0418	two
S0417	two people above you and
S0418	two
S0416	the the ball and they're fight over the ball on top of you so it's like like there's a high chance of like them them accidently step on your leg or something cos they're not really concentrate on where their feet be they're concentrate in get the ball and seal the ruck
S0417	that kind of go over my head but
S0416	a ruck
S0417	to be honest as long like your head isn't get bash in like your leg can
S0416	no
S0417	can get bash in and that's not so bad
S0416	yeah yeah
S0417	yeah and do that gym thing that teacher sound like don't ever let anyone put you in a painful position
S0416	i know
S0416	and then do know he make me do five
S0416	five more of everything
S0418	shoe
S0416	shoe yeah he kind of make me do five more of everything
S0417	can you sit
S0416	like we do the really hard thing and he be like yeah he go right fifteen push up and we do fifteen push up fifteen push up right now back and then do fifty oh fifty like arm legs or whatever they're call
S0417	mm
S0416	it's so hard i
S0416	i have to do twenty of them and then i have to do twenty five or
S0417	yeah okay one word of advice can you cos you're quite good at put your whole enthusiasm in just don't do it so like fervently keep some of your energy back cos if he's ask you to do load and load just like if you're do press up don't do it with your full kind of strength just do it with a bite of it will you remember
S0417	that will help
S0416	yeah
