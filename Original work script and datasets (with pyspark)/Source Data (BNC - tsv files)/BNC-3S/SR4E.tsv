S0454	mm well there's plenty of them
S0579	and he come back with erm a few rabbit in the back
S0454	do he shoot them or trap them
S0579	i think i think he use to catch them actually cos i don't think he would have a gun
S0454	it's probably better because you'd have a time with the pellets otherwise wouldn't you not the rabbit aren't very big
S0579	yeah no no er i think he use to catch them in some way
S0454	snare or something sad though isn't it
S0579	oh er wait er snare them then they go that's right yeah
S0454	mm with their foot it's a pretty nasty way to go though isn't it for an animal
S0579	terrible way isn't it really you know yes
S0454	better to shoot them really but i suppose it make a mess with the
S0579	yeah
S0454	especially if
S0579	yeah
S0454	you want the fur and probably they don't like to shoot them do they cos it'll make a mess of the fur
S0579	no i i remember once buy a rabbit and i be amaze when i get it home and erm i suppose be go to do the cook there and she find a pellet inside
S0454	that's right they do shoot them sometimes
S0579	they be there's a pellet inside it
S0454	yes you've get to watch that actually cos i've have erm
S0579	i've see it
S0454	pellet in but it'll break your teeth if you bite down on one of those
S0579	mm
S0454	and game as well like pheasant they usually shoot those
S0579	no you don't like one swallow a pellet do you i suppose
S0454	no well it's the
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's more your teeth if you bite down on it
S0579	oh do they oh
S0454	wreck your teeth mm
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	they're really hard
S0579	mm
S0454	mm
S0579	do you buy rabbit
S0454	i haven't actually i've never
S0579	no
S0454	no i wouldn't mind that get more game
S0579	i never see them in the shop now though
S0454	no i think you'd have to go to a local butcher i don't think you could get it through the supermarket we have venison for lunch
S0579	oh
S0454	it be delicious do you like venison
S0579	yeah venison it's quite nice
S0454	mm it's absolutely lovely it's lovely meat really dark
S0579	yes we use to catch the erm in the field there rabbit years ago them i think they've go but years ago we use to have the rabbit there
S0454	oh right
S0579	i still think there be one or two around but not many like
S0454	mm yes you've get you've get rabbit
S0579	i think i i think i saw one on the lawn the other day
S0454	mm and i saw one at the back by the bird table
S0579	oh do you what as close as that
S0454	mm it be just sit there don't know why they come up there there's nothing for them to eat
S0579	i know they know that they just sit and look around don't they like
S0454	they do don't they they seem to do that a lot of the day just sit around
S0579	yeah they're nice little things rabbit i suppose
S0454	mm
S0579	you ever cook rabbit then
S0454	no never cook them
S0579	oh oh well
S0454	cook pheasant before
S0579	well there's not much flesh of course on on rabbit or or
S0454	they're full of bone rabbit
S0579	yeah mainly bone
S0454	i think the best way to cook them be in a pie
S0579	oh
S0454	cos then the meat will fall off the bone and i can make a casserole i mean
S0579	oh you wouldn't waste any then no no
S0454	otherwise you've get to get it all off
S0579	no
S0454	if you grill it all put yes it's a pain actually cos it's full of bone so really you want it to fall off yes rabbit pie be nice i like that
S0579	do you like pheasants and that also
S0454	i love pheasant yeah
S0579	there's i use to have a a friend of mine use to go shoot pheasants
S0454	oh right
S0579	always give me a pair of them always not just one always two
S0454	oh yes
S0579	and grandma use to hang them hang them in the barn out there
S0454	yes use to have to peel oh right yes cos you're suppose to hang game aren't you
S0579	yeah for a long time yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	until grandma say i can't stand the smell any more so
S0454	oh right
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah do you have to disembowel them when you hang them or do you hang them whole i think cos i know with deer you have to gut them when you when you hang them you can't just
S0454	cos otherwise the the innards actually infect you know taint the meat
S0579	need to take it away do you
S0454	you have to hang them like by a hoof and then you slit down the middle and pull everything out and then you leave it to mature
S0579	i i think that's what we use to do there pheasant
S0454	oh right so maybe you have to do that with bird as well
S0454	cos yes that's what make fish go off it's the gut isn't it that's when it rot it rot from the gut
S0579	yeah that's right i know use to hang them i think grandma use to hang them up in that cold shed there
S0454	oh right oh that's pretty good
S0579	well it's it's clean enough in there
S0454	oh that's right nothing can get in
S0579	no no that's right
S0454	yes yeah i like game a lot mm big fan of game
S0579	mm mm
S0454	yeah all those things quail
S0579	i yeah
S0454	pheasant yeah venison i love
S0579	i don't think 's ever into meats
S0454	no nor
S0579	yeah
S0454	i always think if you're go to eat meat and you're worry about the ethical side
S0579	yeah
S0454	or even the health side then actually game be a very ethical meat to eat because it's not be keep cooped up
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's live wild all its life and it doesn't have much fat on it unlike
S0579	oh
S0454	say pork or something so if you want to you know something healthy and low fact actually you'll be better off have game
S0579	yes cos you don't get it's not fatty on game no no no no
S0454	it's not fatty cos it's just it's a lean meat yes yes it's probably quite healthy for you and of course not full of chemicals cos it's a wild animal
S0579	do i tell you i be i'm i'm sure one of my friends use to go out shoot always use to go somewhere
S0454	yeah i wouldn't mind actually go
S0579	oh shoot
S0454	learn to shoot yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	you feel a bite sad but at the same time if you're go to eat meat well you should know where it come from really
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	do you think you're pretty good with a rifle would you
S0454	no i'm not good i have shoot them before i'm not good at all actually so yes
S0579	no no
S0454	that'll put me off
S0579	i know when we little come over here they often get the gun out and
S0454	oh right
S0579	we're not we we only shoot at target we don't shoot at no
S0454	oh oh that's good
S0579	yeah fix him up some target in the yard there
S0454	yes
S0579	take the step out put the rest of the gun on for him and then he pepper away
S0454	oh that's good oh yeah expect he enjoy that
S0579	yeah he do as well
S0454	yes
S0579	can you shoot straight
S0454	no i'm i'm bad actually really bad at it
S0579	no
S0454	i go to a fantastic rifle range in abu dhabi cos they're more into their gun
S0579	right
S0454	it be really professional it be underground all soundproof when you go in they give you a catalogue at the reception i mean you could be in a doctor's surgery it be so nice
S0579	oh
S0454	a catalogue full of gun and you have to choose which gun you want hundreds in there so i think i don't know so i ask the man i think well he know doesn't he i say i want erm a small gun without much recoil cos i've shoot those big rifle before
S0579	nearly break your arm yeah
S0454	and i have a bruise
S0579	oh no if you've gotta have into your shoulder
S0454	yeah it be too heavy for me the whole thing be too heavy so i say i want something small without much recoil
S0579	no
S0454	and erm yes he say oh you need erm a glock that's what they have in all the film it's very light and there's not much recoil so a lot of women like these
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then they give you all the train without the bullets obviously so they teach you how to stand how to hold it firmly you know not to turn around with a load gun in your hand
S0579	no no it's not suppose to turn around no
S0454	not suppose to turn around
S0579	no
S0454	yes how how to load the bullets that sort of thing so they show you all of that and then you go down to the range and they've get those move target you know
S0579	oh yes
S0454	a proper you know gun range so at first they put it about twenty five metres away or something
S0579	they're move target oh wow
S0454	er you know it's a sort of it be just erm the ones with circle and
S0579	i'd forget those target we use to have them i know
S0454	yeah yeah and you have to aim
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	erm of course cos you close one eye
S0579	yeah
S0454	actually that throw your eye off doesn't it
S0579	it do yeah
S0454	it's quite interest they make us practise actually without a gun and they say you know look at your finger with both eye now close one eye and say what happen to your finger so if i close my right eye it actually make my finger look like it's move to the leave
S0579	move yeah yeah
S0454	so he say you've get to counteract for that with the gun because you're think
S0579	yeah
S0454	things be further to the leave when they really be cos you've close one eye so you've actually get to aim slightly more to the right than you think
S0579	yes yeah
S0454	and also when you shoot a gun the barrel come up as you shoot as you pull the trigger the the barrel will come up slightly so he say you've get to aim slightly further down than you think the target be
S0579	mm oh
S0454	so it's quite interest there's quite a lot of like calculation cos you've get to aim yeah further to the right and further down than you think then you'll hit the bullseye
S0579	mm
S0454	i be terrible at it
S0579	no i be never good at rifle shoot
S0454	no no i wasn't good at all
S0579	yeah
S0454	no i wouldn't want to have to do that in real life

S0579	yeah
S0454	what's in season
S0579	you like mushroom do you
S0454	oh garlic mushroom i love oh yes yeah
S0579	oh i think i like mushroom do you like mushroom
S0580	i do i i think the little ones be have no flavour like the big flat real mushroom
S0454	mm yes
S0579	oh the big flat yes yes
S0454	the little ones have a great texture if you leave them whole
S0579	yes
S0454	yes they do
S0579	but they're they're much dearer aren't they the little ones aren't they or be they they more expensive
S0454	usually be yes
S0579	cos well i think those big flat ones usually
S0454	yes
S0579	cos they look as they're go off sometimes the big flat ones
S0454	yeah they're not yes they're not always very good in the supermarket
S0579	no
S0454	cos they're not very fresh i think be they
S0579	no
S0580	you need to get them from a farm shop
S0454	yes yeah i be read about grow your own oyster mushroom the other day it's a bite of a long term project though it take at least a year to get your first harvest
S0454	it's easy apparently well firstly you need to get the right kind of log and they like oak so you you're suppose to go and buy green oak you know as in newly cut because you don't want older wood cos then it'll already be infect with various fungi anyway and then on mine like off amazon you can buy you know those dowel pin you get like on
S0580	mm
S0454	sort of table and
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know cheap furniture they have the the slot together with those so you buy those off the internet but you can get ones that have be erm i don't know what they call it sort of impregnate with spores from the oyster mushroom or whatever
S0579	mm
S0454	tree mushroom it be you're after and what you do be you get a drill and you drill into the the wood and then you insert these dowel
S0454	like pin into it
S0579	mm
S0454	erm and that's it you just like leave it for a year outside and off they come or in your garage whatever
S0580	be you go to try
S0454	i might do it as a project this autumn actually
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	if i find some oak or i'll look up what other woods you could use yeah be quite fun wouldn't it other countries do it a lot more
S0580	i like yeah
S0454	yeah it's quiet common in japan or china people do grow mushroom but in the uk it's quite unusual it's quite hard to grow other sort of mushroom
S0580	yes they're a bite specialise aren't they those
S0454	it's a quite a specialise thing and
S0579	yes
S0454	if it get infect with another soil you have to throw the whole lot away so it's not simple at all
S0579	no i know we use to act for some people who use to do mushroom
S0454	that's right yeah you you have that mushroom farm client
S0579	and they er they use to erm spray them quite often like
S0454	ah right yes apparently it's very complicate to grow
S0579	yes yes
S0454	one sort of mushroom
S0579	that's right
S0454	in you know that medium because of the infectation
S0579	yeah you get one's like that and then the other one's like that
S0454	yeah you basically have to to work in a clean room
S0579	yeah
S0454	to start them off a sterile room with all the gear and everything it's
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah it's things just infect it otherwise it make sense doesn't it cos we know like mould grow even in fridges
S0580	yeah yeah
S0454	even if you leave you know even if you put something in a fridge and you put bleach in there and you leave it a bite too long it will still grow
S0580	yeah
S0454	that's right so it's there already it's there on the food just wait for the right environment
S0579	well those big mushroom i think it's better flavour than the little ones
S0454	yeah yeah that's right yes
S0579	be you a mushroom fan dear
S0580	i love them yeah
S0579	no there you be
S0454	wild er you know like the big ones you get in the shop but wild ones be those but you
S0579	yeah the big ones
S0454	i wouldn't eat them myself without an expert but i happen to be at a country park where they have a mushroom expert in the visitor centre
S0579	yeah oh
S0454	so and they'd grow so fast they'd actually break off they'd fall over and break off so i didn't even have to break them off so i pick them up and take them say oh you shouldn't've do that and i say no they've literally fall over he say oh that happen sometimes after the rain they grow so fast they just tumble over and he he go to his book and he look them up and he say they're fine absolutely fine they'll be delicious just slice them fry them with your bacon they be the most delicious mushroom in the world
S0454	absolutely fantastic
S0579	fantastic
S0454	they be so fresh
S0579	yeah
S0454	so meaty
S0580	nice
S0454	yeah i wouldn't be able to find them myself like cos they look like other mushroom apparently that be very very poisonous
S0579	yeah
S0580	yeah
S0579	oh
S0454	and it's almost impossible to tell them apart unless you're an expert so it's not something you'd want to mess with
S0579	there's quite a lot of different sort of mushroom aren't there
S0454	hundreds and thousands in the uk
S0579	yeah that's right i know yeah different sort
S0454	yes apparently the vast majority be edible but the problem be if you get it wrong you're in big trouble and they all look very similar so it's not something
S0579	no
S0454	you want to do unless you're sure
S0579	no
S0454	the other thing be the majority be very very small in the uk
S0579	oh yeah no yeah
S0454	like most it's not those big field mushroom they're tiny things
S0579	there's some of them get as big as plat don't you
S0454	yeah oh yes
S0579	you know what i mean
S0454	yeah actually in spain they have this one call the cauliflower mushroom and they sell that in the supermarket in japan and it look just like a brain or a cauliflower if you want to be diplomatic but it look like a brain and you slice it and fry it lightly like with tempura or something it's just incredibly light it's lovely yeah cos in japan you go to the supermarket and they'll have six or seven different sort in every supermarket
S0579	yeah different sort yeah
S0454	whereas the uk's very odd like that
S0580	really
S0454	you're lucky if you get two sort aren't you
S0580	you and you have to look for them and half the time you want them for a recipe and they haven't get them
S0454	that's right yeah
S0579	no they they don't have er in morrisons do they
S0454	no
S0579	mushroom
S0454	it's never catch on here
S0580	well they they have the old ordinary ones

S0579	what in the vegetable section i suppose
S0580	yes
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0580	but if you want specialise mushroom they're much harder to come by
S0579	oh you
S0454	see if you go to italy then they'll have all sort in the shop because
S0579	oh yes
S0454	they just eat a wider range
S0579	oh yes
S0454	but here we only ever eat one it seem

S0580	oh that's nice yeah
S0579	yeah i don't think i don't think your mum like mushroom that be the answer
S0580	she wasn't very keen i think

S0580	yes it be
S0454	delicious
S0579	oh mushroom soup's lovely

S0454	i expect so
S0580	i usually buy you a
S0579	mm mm
S0580	it's your favourite isn't it the baxter's
S0454	yes
S0579	what darling
S0580	baxter's
S0579	oh baxter's
S0580	cream of mushroom
S0579	oh yes i think like the baxter's ones doesn't your
S0454	ah
S0580	no i don't buy tin soup
S0454	no i make it
S0580	i make my own
S0454	yeah i make soup i try and do it
S0454	i probably get it make it every other week but just saturday morning i'll put some on
S0579	be it a long job no just
S0454	no well the preparation's easy and then yes you just have to turn it right down and leave it it depend what you're make but vegetable soup take about half an hour to forty minutes to just simmer gently
S0579	yes i tend to forget what i've put on so
S0579	about an hour later i can smell something
S0580	smell it burn
S0579	and there there's no moisture in the pot
S0454	yeah dear
S0579	i give up on those things no no
S0454	that's no good
S0579	no no
S0580	i have a lovely one i don't know if you've ever try it be roast tomatoes
S0454	oh that sound nice
S0580	with garlic
S0454	oh
S0580	you have to peel the tomatoes that's the bad
S0454	yes that's pain
S0580	you put them in the oven with chop up garlic and olive oil
S0454	mm
S0580	when they're roast when they're do you process them
S0454	yeah
S0580	and then put it in a saucepan
S0454	mm
S0580	and you add blue cheese
S0454	oh wow that sound nice
S0579	yeah
S0580	maybe a bite of cream it be divine
S0454	mm sound lovely
S0580	because it taste nothing like your manufacture tomato soup
S0454	no
S0580	it's completely different
S0454	well i think all homemade soup just taste so different to the shop ones
S0580	they're lovely aren't they
S0454	but yeah baxter's ones aren't bad though
S0579	yeah some you buy in the shop be awful aren't they some of them like
S0580	no they're probably the best
S0454	some of them be awful yeah absolutely dreadful like those spring vegetable you get half the time taste of water
S0579	no they're terrible yeah
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	just boil vegetables
S0454	just tasteless
S0580	i think your baxter's be amongst the better tin soup
S0454	mm
S0579	baxter yeah yeah
S0580	but morisons also do a range don't they
S0579	get their own do they
S0454	mm
S0580	yes you buy them in those little containers
S0579	oh jar don't they yeah think
S0580	fresh freshly make soup
S0579	buy some of those occasionally
S0580	yeah
S0454	mm
S0580	and they're not bad
S0454	no
S0580	but you do need to use them within a certain length of time otherwise they go off a bite
S0579	you have lot of mushroom soup at home do you
S0454	i haven't make it for a long time but actually i should
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	because the supermarket often mark down mushroom cos they don't keep that long and they're really cheap you probably only need a punnet don't you get a couple of punnets maybe
S0579	cos they don't look very nice when they're go off mushroom do they
S0454	no no the big ones
S0579	put you off
S0454	don't look very nice
S0580	and you like the french onion soup don't you
S0454	oh i like that
S0579	yeah well i buy that quite often
S0454	i make that quite yeah i make that for mum and dad the other day yeah
S0579	do you yeah it's a nice one that
S0580	aren't they

S0454	yeah and i make cheddar cheese soup the other day that's 's recipe
S0579	oh do them
S0454	yeah
S0580	don't know that one
S0579	oh of course she always cook with soup cos she doesn't eat meat do she

S0454	mm
S0579	and be good on soup wasn't she make good soup yeah

S0579	yeah course she doesn't eat meat do she
S0580	no
S0454	chicken occasionally

S0454	ah right okay yeah
S0579	still he have all sort of meats doesn't he she hasn't stop him from eat them
S0454	no
S0579	no
S0454	well that's good cos you've get to make your own mind up haven't you
S0454	so that's right yeah

S0454	i say that's a bite of change say yeah
S0579	oh that's good with yeah
S0454	yeah it's funny but she say yeah it be awkward cos you go to people's house and they would've cook for her and you know she wouldn't like that she wouldn't like that she have to eat it
S0579	no
S0454	actually she quite like it
S0579	oh
S0454	but your taste bud change as you get older
S0579	i be yeah yeah
S0454	definitely yeah
S0579	mm
S0454	like when i be young you know those bell pepper you get the
S0579	i don't like pepper
S0454	so they're not hot the bell pepper
S0579	oh no
S0454	but i be convince as a child they be spicy i taste them as spicy and if you think about it's the same family as
S0580	mm
S0454	chilli pepper even though they don't taste hot to adults to a child you must be pick up on a the same chemical
S0580	mm
S0454	so i wouldn't eat them for years and now i i taste them raw or cook and i can't believe i think they be spicy
S0580	no they're very mild aren't they
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0580	the red ones be quite sweet
S0579	do you eat pepper then

S0454	no those aren't no
S0579	no
S0580	if you eat a chilli pepper
S0579	oh that'd put me right off
S0454	you would know
S0580	you would know about it
S0579	when we're go to i don't think anything they've always get pepper in their stuff
S0454	that's right yes
S0579	in the summer
S0454	yeah
S0579	the middle east be a bite like that isn't it

S0454	but the locals don't really like spicy food they use particular spice but they're not the hot ones so they
S0579	yeah
S0454	would use a lot of cardamom and cinnamon and cumin in their cook

S0579	be you be you not a rhubarb fan then
S0580	i i don't mind it but i can't deal with the sugar that go in it
S0454	yeah it's it's a bite erm surprise when you see how much go in
S0580	yeah
S0579	oh i don't know you put a lot of sugar in rhubarb do they
S0580	i don't use sugar in you have to you can't eat it
S0454	yeah it's not edible if you
S0579	oh i have forget yes
S0580	so i don't use sugar in cook
S0579	oh
S0454	i read somewhere though and i've never try it there's a herb call chervil
S0580	yeah
S0454	and if you put that in with the rhubarb you can put in a fraction of the sugar cos for some reason it make you think it's sweeter than it really be
S0580	that's interest
S0454	yeah yeah you could probably i'll google it now but i'm sure it be chervil but you can't buy chervil you'd have to grow your own
S0580	yeah
S0454	yeah you can see you find it in sort of seed you know garden centre chervil but that's what it be for because sugar be erm you know a
S0580	i could try grow it
S0454	limit after yeah yes
S0580	i've get a herb bed in the garden
S0579	yeah
S0454	chervil
S0579	and always around morrisons they have a huge range of fruit don't they
S0580	yeah
S0579	in morrisons vegetables as well
S0580	yes they're good
S0579	all sort of things over there
S0580	i'm go to try and start like start use farm shop a bite more
S0454	yeah i'd like to buy locally a lot more
S0580	cos i think it's important
S0579	there's there's a there's some near isn't there farm shop
S0580	oh they're all over the place
S0454	there's a lot round by me
S0579	oh be they
S0454	very small scale
S0579	oh they're not really farm shop you say be they
S0580	yes
S0579	oh they be really
S0580	yeah they don't many of them don't carry a huge range but you know you can get some key things there and i think it's important to support them
S0579	yes i i remember
S0454	i do
S0579	yes
S0454	and that's what we should be do with food buy much more locally
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0580	yeah
S0454	mm
S0580	er but as you say buy the egg and it doesn't matter if you get one big and one small in a pack cos everything's so uniform in supermarkets
S0579	yeah yeah i think in the village there actually you can go and buy egg they be local ones you buy yeah
S0580	yeah
S0579	not like morrisons big ones they're just local stuff
S0454	mm
S0579	think they put them up local egg yes
S0454	yes local egg bite more expensive than the supermarket i've notice but then they're probably very fresh
S0579	be it really oh yes i suppose they're fresher if they're local egg i suppose
S0580	yes they would be
S0579	yeah
S0580	and a lot of people will you know put the stall out on the roadside and it's just an honesty box around where we be
S0454	yeah it be round by me

S0579	tiny one oh
S0454	it's not very big
S0579	well you don't want too much do you at the moment we wouldn't get rid of it in time would we i suppose no
S0454	no unless it's sweet cicely maybe i've muddle it up there's something call sweet cicely that's come up as a sugar substitute let me try that maybe i've muddle them up in my mind
S0579	oh
S0454	don't know how you say that name c i c e l y hear of that
S0580	cicely i don't know
S0454	could be cicely it's oh yes it be it's that one it say it say have a slight sweet aniseed flavour herb which be a very good sugar substitute
S0580	well there you go then
S0579	oh
S0454	that's what it be myrrhis odorata oh myrrh mm yes that's it interest cos sugar would've be a luxury goods you know in roman time
S0579	oh yes
S0454	because you can't grow it in this country and actually
S0579	no no
S0454	i be talk to erm you know i work on that community farm near me
S0579	ah yes
S0454	and they be say sugar beet be new it's basically something the seed company cook up
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	around the time of the second world war because they be so worry about sugar cane be limit at the time we use to import
S0579	yeah
S0454	all our sugar and it be all sugar cane which only grow in place like jamaica and very tropical countries
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	so they invent sugar beet by breed you know basically the swede family together which contain a lot of sugar and they come up with this plant and it's all patent you can't
S0580	really
S0454	buy sugar beet unless you're a sugar beet farmer
S0579	oh
S0454	yeah and they grow it in east anglia everywhere sugar beet everywhere
S0579	do it be it as sweet like all these sugar
S0454	you have to process it
S0579	oh i see yes
S0454	erm so what we get in this country be mostly sugar beet now
S0579	be sugar beet yeah
S0454	er but yeah you can only grow it under licence
S0579	oh
S0454	and yeah it's quite a process to extract it it's not easy they have to put it in these low pressure cookers and that extract the sugar somehow with water don't
S0579	oh
S0454	boil at a very funny temperature very low temperature i suppose
S0579	oh
S0454	mm you find it
S0580	yes i have
S0454	yeah that's what you want to say it's easy to grow outside with minimal care
S0579	oh
S0454	that's what you need
S0579	have you plant stuff already in your garden
S0454	very little actually
S0579	no no no no
S0454	yeah i've do the lawn that be priorities
S0579	get a bite of grass yes
S0454	yes i think that will make a big difference and the trouble be if you don't get it in now then all the weed grow so then you spend the rest of the summer
S0579	oh i see that yes pull weed out
S0454	pull the weed out so
S0579	yeah
S0454	and i have to dig the whole garden over to get the builders' rubble out so that take me two weeks
S0579	oh
S0454	full of rubble
S0580	yeah
S0454	enormous piece
S0580	terrible mess
S0579	yeah
S0454	such a and they just dump
S0579	yeah
S0454	two centimetres of topsoil on top nothing would grow in that
S0580	yes
S0454	so i've get the turf in so that's most of the garden and they put a fruit tree in that be on the plan but they didn't give it to me
S0579	oh
S0454	so i write them an email and say where be the fruit tree on my plan your window for plant close in two weeks and they erm by the time i get back from work it be in

S0454	have you use erm stevia as a sugar substitute
S0580	no
S0454	that you can get in the shop now erm like waitrose sell it and it's twice as sweet at least as sugar so you halve the recipe
S0580	yeah
S0454	erm yeah very very sweet but yeah some people say it's get er a bite of a flavour so now like the big company like tate and lyle be mix it with sugar but it's still half you don't have to so whatever the recipe say it's half and it be personally i reduce it again so if you're bake you can use that
S0580	mm
S0454	that's quite good it's a plant just some natural plant
S0580	right
S0454	and i've get agave as well i haven't try that agave syrup from a cactus mm

S0579	you've gotta put a kennel and that's a fuss isn't it yeah
S0454	yes no i love dog but not in that size house
S0579	no no this er no
S0454	not a new one mm
S0579	i think we use to keep a house outside a kennel i think far as i remember
S0454	train them's quite a thing isn't it
S0579	never know how to get in beg your pardon
S0454	train a dog
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah yeah it's not easy
S0454	do you train yours
S0579	i use to do what with them
S0454	do you train it when it be a puppy
S0579	oh i well i can't i shouldn't think so
S0454	no
S0579	someone may've do it but not me
S0454	someone must've yeah cos you have to toilet train them
S0579	no no yeah you do you have to yeah you do yeah
S0454	it's like a child isn't it it's quite a thing and you've get to teach it to walk on a lead cos it's
S0579	yeah
S0454	doesn't come natural and not pull and
S0579	oh yes
S0454	stay at your heel and stop at the road and
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah a friend of mine have a husky puppy and they be very strong will and very energetic
S0579	mm
S0454	we have to take it to all these dog train class i go with her really interest the dog train class cos all the psychology of the dog how the dog think and you need to make it do what you want to do but not by brute force
S0579	yeah
S0454	you've get to get in its head so they would explain what's go on
S0579	oh yes
S0454	and you see the dog think it's part of the pack and you're its family and you've get to teach it that you're the alpha dog in the group
S0579	yeah
S0454	you be the boss but not through force they didn't want you to do that er so you've get to reinforce that behaviour
S0579	yeah
S0454	constantly with a puppy it's just constant
S0580	exhaust i should think
S0454	absolutely exhaust
S0579	yeah
S0580	yeah
S0454	yeah and you just teach it one trick at a time and they show us er like work with a dog and it look quite brutal cos they have it on a short leash and often with puppies they put them on those erm what they call a choke leash

S0579	yeah
S0454	they'd be really really hard
S0579	hard yeah
S0454	and i be a really good child so actually it be ridiculous and they would report me for everything and i just think that be very unfair
S0579	oh
S0454	erm cos they wouldn't've do that with any other child
S0579	anyone's child no no
S0454	yeah no so i didn't like that at all never mind
S0579	i suppose
S0454	that's life
S0579	oh well that's life
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	think be always okay about it she didn't seem to mind at all
S0579	no no no no
S0454	and didn't get on and then he change school so that be okay and be fine again it's funny isn't it
S0579	yeah it be yes that's right

S0580	yeah
S0454	and there's this huge brochure but i mean pretty much you're just gonna close your eye and pick which be what we do well we think about the type of comedy we might find funny like do you find political comedy funny or do you find and i think physical comedy be always quite but it's you know a bite like a clown but they're go to do it in a clever way you know with edinburgh festival it's not just gonna be a clown we go to see one of those two women they be absolutely brilliant
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	really really funny er it be quite in the end er yeah they be just really really good they be on their second year just really worth go but hit and miss i suppose like you could have something that wasn't funny have to sit there for an hour
S0579	oh
S0580	oh it sound something that you should do once in a while
S0454	yes yeah there's lot of good small festivals aren't there

S0454	mm
S0579	oh yes oh cos 's quite a nice town isn't it
S0454	it be nice yeah
S0580	lovely town
S0579	yeah i we we use to go there quite often to
S0454	mm mm food festivals they're always good
S0580	they're nice yes
S0579	the food festivals
S0580	yeah
S0454	yeah can't go wrong with those can you
S0579	no no no no you go to those and like taste this and taste the other
S0454	i go to one in abu dhabi
S0579	oh really
S0454	and because they've get huge budget out there
S0579	oh yes
S0454	they'd bring in the best chefs off tv not not the super super delia smith ones but people who be regularly on like food network and things
S0579	no there yes
S0454	so you sort of vaguely know them and they do live cook show and you get to eat the food afterwards
S0580	oh nice
S0454	but they you know they have like a limit time cos it's you know quite obviously bore just to watch someone put food in an oven
S0580	yeah
S0454	so they're only allow fifteen minutes to make
S0579	yeah
S0454	a main course from start to finish
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then explain what they're do all the time they have sous chefs to you know speed it up but just fantastic
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah and the food be phenomenal this guy make make a fish curry
S0579	mm
S0454	from a piece of monkfish in fifteen minutes include all the cook
S0580	that's incredible
S0454	just phenomenal yes the flavour
S0579	oh marvellous yeah
S0454	and then they would hand out a little card that we can go on the
S0579	mm
S0454	the website and find your the recipe but brilliant mm
S0579	who be that chap you use to have on television years ago be it floyd or something floyd
S0454	oh there's
S0580	keith floyd yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	yeah he be good fond of his food jump up and down and
S0580	very flamboyant
S0579	that's upside down and bite there throw a bite over there for him and twirl it all up yes
S0580	he be like the earliest one of the earliest of the tv chefs wasn't he
S0579	i suppose yes he be very different the way he use to talk mm
S0454	and isn't it funny that that tv format catch on
S0579	mm
S0454	cos you would think that would be the one thing that would not translate well to tv cos food be all about the taste
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean there's a bite in the look at it but
S0579	mm
S0454	it's in the taste
S0579	mm
S0454	so it's it seem really odd to me that
S0579	oh yeah

S0454	wasn't really cos he like garden
S0579	oh have to get outside

S0579	now the story be in the paper the other day
S0454	long wait list
S0579	yeah that's right people get allotments
S0454	mm cos it's erm a legal requirement of all councils to provide allotments if there's sufficient demand but sufficient demand in law be set at six people in a council district so obviously there's permanent demand
S0579	oh
S0454	and they're not allow to charge extortionate rent they have to charge
S0579	no no
S0454	a peppercorn rent which be proportional
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	so they're only charge about twenty five pound a year usually if that
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	there's huge demand
S0580	not surprise
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah i've be in touch with the local council at to say where be our allotments you be aware you have to legally provide them cos they're really drag their feet and they haven't they keep just
S0580	do you get a reply
S0454	yeah a long reply say oh yes we have originally put them on the plan but then we decide it be too near the sport field so we've decide to put them somewhere else but now it's back with the the legal people it's just an excuse
S0580	mm
S0454	er it's just
S0579	oh
S0454	the developers have obviously pay a backhander i i think
S0579	oh
S0454	er

S0580	i've never be in one that isn't
S0454	no
S0454	yeah i'm quite when you compare what the price be elsewhere to what you're pay in a garden centre there's a huge mark up it's like four hundred percent i'm like where have that add all that
S0579	yeah
S0580	and you know the supermarkets all sell you know some bed plant and they're much much cheaper very often than garden centre
S0454	yes yeah yes that's right
S0579	they be yeah
S0454	yes that's what i do i go to the the supermarket if i want something
S0580	yeah
S0454	just you know fill a bed
S0580	yeah
S0454	then you're better off go to the supermarket and pay five pound cos you'll get load
S0580	cos they they buy of course in huge bulk wouldn't they so it's what they can pass it on to the customer but it's a much better deal

S0579	oh
S0454	it's go to stretch and look silly
S0580	the thought's never occur to me but yes
S0454	or conversely if they lose weight what would happen
S0580	yes
S0454	so you can't really lose or gain weight again for the rest of your life you shouldn't put it on your stomach i think be the moral of the story
S0580	reason not have a tattoo
S0454	yes put it somewhere which doesn't stretch like your back
S0579	oh
S0454	yes
S0579	oh well

S0580	er he do a lot of good with that campaign
S0454	although he do yes
S0579	yes okay
S0454	the children didn't like it but then they wouldn't would they if
S0579	no no no
S0454	you suddenly have your chip switch for vegetables

S0579	i i well i suppose they something like that yeah i suppose they get them in school like this
S0454	well i think they've stop after jamie oliver
S0579	i remember once oh
S0454	well maybe they haven't i don't know
S0580	you can still get some stuff i wouldn't necessarily put on a menu i think but it's a lot better than it be
S0454	yeah oh that's good see japan when i live there in the school where i work the county council would employ a nutritionist to write menus for the entire school district break down into how many calories how much protein enormous detail and it be map out months and months ahead
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	and that be what they produce centrally and it would come to the school and that be what you get everyone have exactly the same food and it be of quite a high calorie content
S0579	yeah
S0454	because they say children need a lot of calories but low fat low salt you know low other things and it be very good
S0580	sound excellent
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh
S0454	and it be their kind of food i mean it wouldn't catch on here but you'd always get a bowl of rice
S0454	white rice cos they always eat white rice
S0579	oh no they're welcome to that
S0454	yeah and they have a small piece of fish grill usually
S0579	yeah
S0454	or a maybe a small piece of chicken but usually it be fish always some sort of vegetable piece of fruit yoghurt yeah just there would be five or six different things on a tray
S0580	sound very healthy yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	that be it and always milk you'd always have a little carton of milk
S0579	oh
S0454	yeah and they say please eat it all cos it's a bad example to the children if you don't
S0579	oh yeah yeah be bream a fish

S0579	yes
S0454	it's it's very good yeah
S0579	yes it's quite a good
S0454	it's talk about the erm the eu thing it's it's get erm obama meet erm the prince and it say and then your little country leave the eu and be never hear of again
S0579	i know i know
S0454	brilliant isn't it
S0579	yeah it be quite good
S0454	be you go to vote grandpa for the
S0579	oh i expect so
S0454	referendum
S0579	you can take it up to read it if you want to
S0454	oh no no i'll leave it here i'll just have a little look though
S0579	yeah
S0454	have you decide how you're go to vote or not yet
S0579	yeah i i forget there's one on if i
S0454	next month yeah referendum
S0579	it's next month be it oh no no no that's okay
S0454	mm eu or not the eu
S0579	no but i suppose we have to be in the eu i suppose
S0454	i think most people be go to vote to stay
S0579	i think so yeah
S0454	yes yes that's it's not good for everybody of course to be in the eu
S0579	well no no no it's
S0454	small businesses it's probably the worst possible thing in the world
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	because there's too much competition for them and too much red tape
S0579	that's right
S0454	but it's good if you're an employee of a much larger company
S0579	yes
S0454	because then you would have you know good opportunities
S0579	tunity yeah yes
S0454	and probably quite safe your job's quite safe
S0579	yeah i expect yeah
S0454	but yes it's not good for small businessman or small farmers
S0579	no
S0454	i think they be suffer but of course it's not only economics you have to think about safety and security and
S0579	yeah
S0454	whether we're safer in or out and i suppose the strength
S0579	that's the point it's it's it's about fifty fifty some would say
S0454	i think yes
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	we do a straw poll today at lunch
S0579	oh do you
S0454	and i wodnered how representative that be because it be sort of eighty twenty
S0579	oh be it
S0454	eighty for in so i think well if that's representative then we'll end up stay in
S0579	yeah oh
S0454	mm
S0579	oh i i think suppose to be very close most of them
S0454	well maybe it be
S0579	cos they do get it wrong on these pollsters don't they
S0454	they they get it very wrong in the last election didn't they
S0579	in the last election we be miles out
S0454	they think it be go to be really close but it be a landslide
S0579	yeah it be a landslide yeah
S0454	they be they be way off
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah yeah that's quite interest how wrong they've be i suppose a lot of people don't decide until the very last minute
S0579	yeah yes
S0454	and they might have a gut feel but that doesn't mean they'd necessarily go with that at the last minute
S0579	no no no
S0454	they might just talk to their friends and then you know everyone else say oh i vote for him and then there's sort of a
S0579	yes
S0454	almost a domino effect
S0579	yeah some people don't even know what they're vote till they get into the booth
S0454	i don't think so no
S0579	no they they just look at the name and if they like the look of one they tick that box
S0454	no i think not yeah yeah i think so yeah
S0579	yeah it's very
S0454	yeah i don't like him
S0579	there we be
S0454	yes it's funny this
S0579	yes it's quite amuse read some of it well often anyhow in there
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah it's very funny
S0579	this chappy come on the television use to be use to be write to that forget his name now er
S0579	he still come on every so often
S0454	oh right
S0579	wish i could remember his name it's
S0579	doesn't have a very big circulation i don't think that sort of
S0454	no but it's keep go hasn't it which be nice
S0579	no no yeah they must have a job make it pay its way i think
S0454	yeah i i think a lot of these paper aren't
S0579	bite of a job
S0454	well even the big dailies be struggle aren't they like the guardian and things
S0579	oh the big ones yeah that's right yeah yeah yeah
S0454	it's surprise actually they've keep go in a way
S0579	yes erm especially one of those it's quite small really i suppose
S0454	but apparently eighty percent of their revenue be advertise so
S0579	well i suppose they've get all
S0454	as long as they've get that on the back they'll probably keep go
S0579	oh oh oh that's right
S0454	yeah there's quite a lot of advertise isn't there
S0579	advertise yeah so they won't advertise eventually if there's not enough circulation will you
S0454	no well no that's true there's go to reach a critical point where they'll pull their ads
S0579	yeah they'll want to they'll want to be pay up if er
S0454	yes
S0579	no one's buy it
S0454	but at the moment it seem although they do advertise on the internet people ignore it
S0579	yeah
S0454	whereas you're more likely it seem to look at advert in print
S0579	i think that's true actually you don't bother to think about what's on the radio there the telly
S0454	yes that's right so it's
S0579	but you see it in the flesh you read it
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	so it's not just a number game it's about how effective it might be
S0579	yeah be yeah
S0454	in reach your readerhood
S0579	okay
S0454	yeah that's funny
S0579	do you do you watch many program
S0454	erm i have a thing call netflix now which be erm
S0579	netflix
S0454	a subscriber base tv package
S0579	oh
S0454	and there's lot of things on there so i do watch a bite now
S0579	oh
S0454	so it's all pre record
S0579	cos they think english television's probably the best in the world don't they
S0454	yeah
S0579	in america it's mostly advert isn't it
S0454	that's right yes
S0579	well a lot of them anyhow
S0454	yes yes that be true
S0579	and we do get a little bite of advertise here but not very much
S0454	no
S0579	no no
S0454	no
S0579	nothing on the bbc but
S0454	that's good
S0579	little bite on the others occasionally
