S0012	yeah you can't get to them at all cos
S0008	cos cos
S0012	you can't you can't get to this this run lamp
S0008	yeah
S0012	without jack the car up and then i still don't know how to get up
S0008	mm
S0012	up to it
S0013	mm
S0012	i mean well it's stupid
S0008	yeah
S0013	it be silly
S0008	well it's like i the the light on there you can they get two bulbs they get the headlamp and the dip lamp
S0012	yeah
S0008	different bulbs and then they get a side light as well and the indicator bulb be in the there in this headlamp bite
S0012	yeah
S0008	and on the back of it they get this sort of big sort of rubber thing you pull off and all you can get to there be the side er it's one of the headlight bulbs
S0012	yeah
S0008	the other one be tuck down god know how you you know i've only have to renew the the dip bulbs
S0012	yeah
S0008	but like you say it's the same thing
S0013	mm
S0008	i'm now think that perhaps you just have to take the whole unit out
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then i'll bet you if you try to do that
S0012	oh
S0008	there'd be some
S0013	mm
S0008	some nut which be you'd have to take the bumper off to get to
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and like
S0013	mm
S0008	the the bumper on that i've try take the bumper off to get to something else and in the book it say it's hold in with er screw
S0012	yeah
S0008	but on that one it's hold in with rivet
S0012	be it
S0008	so you have to
S0012	oh my god
S0008	drill the rivet out to get the bumper off
S0012	oh my goodness yeah
S0008	so god know god know what you do
S0013	yeah
S0012	weird innit why can't they be easy like they use to be
S0008	i dunno god know too easy to
S0012	well they make everything they make everything
S0008	yeah
S0012	so complicate i mean if that computer go in there that would that's gotta cost us a fortune innit
S0008	mm
S0012	you know cos
S0008	yeah like there's no reason why it should cost you a fortune cos
S0012	no it's a
S0008	i mean you can buy electronic gizmos for next to nothing can't you
S0012	you can yeah you can
S0008	so why be that
S0012	i dunno
S0008	why be a car computer so expensive
S0012	i dunno
S0008	it's only a little chip
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they must make millions of them and if they
S0012	it's get two computers that one
S0008	yeah
S0012	it's get it's get er
S0008	yeah it's a brake computer no doubt
S0012	that's yeah that'll tell you oh tell you everything
S0008	yeah
S0012	what's go on you know er there's chip one and chip two ain't there on on that one
S0013	i don't know
S0012	and i always always have it on one anyway to tell me what speed i'm go that's the
S0008	but the thing be that these new mots they've get if anything electronic doesn't work that's automatic failure
S0012	failure yeah that be
S0013	mm
S0012	you need a new computer in it yeah take it out and put in a new one
S0008	i mean the only the only good thing about it be be that you know they probably nothing will fail for the first ten years anyway
S0012	well that's right yeah hopefully
S0008	i mean look at these kias where they get a ten year guarantee don't they
S0012	yeah yeah yeah they do don't they er one of them have get a lifetime guarantee which no that's a vauxhall new vauxhalls have get
S0013	that be ours wasn't it
S0012	lifetime er guarantee
S0013	but if you read the small print
S0008	yeah
S0013	i mean
S0012	yeah read the small print
S0013	and you don't
S0012	and you've gotta have this that and the other one
S0008	and you've gotta spend five hundred quid with them every year
S0013	obviously it won't do for tyres
S0012	yeah
S0013	it won't do
S0012	that's right yeah
S0013	you know
S0008	so you're probably better off buy a private warranty
S0012	yeah
S0008	you can buy private warranties
S0013	yeah it's not
S0008	it's like insurance
S0013	really a guarantee at all
S0008	you know where you actually pay them two hundred quid a year and they guarantee any repair
S0012	that's right yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well he use to have a lease car and they use to do everything anyway
S0008	mm
S0012	but you have to pay so much money a lot more money
S0008	yeah
S0012	than you would on hp or whatever
S0008	yeah
S0012	for the lease but anything go wrong that's all
S0008	yeah
S0012	that's all do
S0008	a lot of people do that
S0012	yeah
S0008	don't they
S0013	yeah
S0008	do that now
S0012	yeah firm do this
S0008	cos like the one time if you have a firm's car
S0013	do kind of make sense sometimes
S0008	if you have a firm's car they would then
S0013	mm
S0008	help you or or lower your your tax cos
S0012	that's right yeah
S0013	cos they be say you're get so much benefit from it
S0012	yeah
S0008	but if it's a lease car
S0013	yeah
S0008	all that it don't belong to you
S0012	no
S0008	and you know yeah that money you're pay be tax deductible
S0012	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah i mean quite i think quite a few people buy cars like that now
S0012	yeah i think they must do yeah
S0008	cos they do this thing
S0013	mm
S0008	where you give them a a deposit of
S0013	yeah
S0008	fifteen hundred quid plus lease it for ten years
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and then or for six years and half
S0012	three years it be
S0008	be it three years
S0012	three years yeah
S0008	and after three years you're gonna either buy the car
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	or have a another
S0012	have another one
S0013	just
S0012	yeah and you let them have it back
S0013	mm
S0012	and they
S0008	yeah
S0012	they sell it
S0008	i mean for people who want a new car that's you know and know and want a new car every few years
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's sort of quite a good deal
S0012	obviously you
S0013	yeah
S0012	you get your first three years free of mot
S0008	yeah
S0012	so you don't have an mot for the first three years after
S0008	but that's weird isn't it
S0012	ain't that weird
S0008	you know you could have bald tyres you could be drive around with
S0012	yeah
S0008	bald tyres
S0012	you could be
S0008	you could be drive you could nick the
S0013	be that no mot or just free mot
S0008	no it's no mot
S0012	no mot
S0008	for the first
S0012	three years it be
S0013	that be silly isn't it
S0012	yeah we didn't when we buy first buy our zafira we didn't
S0013	i think it be just free i didn't
S0012	we didn't have an mot at all for three years
S0013	oh right oh
S0008	i mean you could have er damage underneath which be deadly
S0013	of course you can
S0012	well you could have anything go on with it couldn't you
S0013	could be lethal couldn't it
S0008	yeah
S0012	you
S0008	i mean that's the only way i know
S0013	especially
S0008	this car's reasonably safe be that i put i through an mot every now and again
S0012	well don't i think it's wonderful
S0008	i know it's er
S0012	i think that
S0008	and it mean they'll tell you what's wrong with it and
S0012	yeah
S0013	it's nice to know isn't it
S0012	the things we use to drive years ago i mean i have a a cable brake ford
S0013	just gonna put
S0012	eight
S0008	mm mm
S0013	get the
S0012	and they have cable brake and and you'd literally have to stand on them if you be go down a hill
S0008	mm that's right and they be never they be never even be they so
S0012	no
S0008	if you brake you'd always be
S0012	they'd pull over one side or whatever
S0008	you know skid around
S0012	yeah oh that be awful
S0008	mm
S0012	but then that only do up to about fifty mile an hour anyway so
S0008	mm
S0012	you know
S0008	yeah that's true well minis be weren't design to do more than seventy be they
S0012	no they weren't be they no
S0008	the maximum speed seventy mile an hour
S0012	yeah
S0008	whereas you get in a modern car like yours i expect that could do about a hundred and twenty
S0012	well i haven't try it
S0008	if you have it flat out
S0012	do you know what it it's automatic
S0008	mm
S0012	but you wouldn't know it you can put your foot down and that would break your neck
S0008	well
S0012	well it would push you back
S0008	yeah
S0012	and i don't know how the how they do it
S0008	but don't you even feel it change gear
S0012	no you don't feel it go
S0008	mm
S0012	oh
S0008	yeah they've come a long way ain't they
S0012	they have yeah
S0008	mm
S0012	but they that's call trip computer there's two two trip computers on it and er it'll tell you everything you want to know you just put it on on a certain
S0008	mm
S0012	thing and that'll tell you that you're do thirty miles an hour or fifty mile an hour and you're use er you your destination be two hundred miles away and you'll use so much petrol you know
S0008	so it have get some sort of satnav otherwise how would you
S0012	well it's get something it it cos
S0008	how do you know the destination
S0012	it it would
S0008	how do they know where you're go
S0012	a hundred if you do a hundred miles
S0008	it don't know where we're go do it
S0012	no it don't know where we're go no i've get that
S0008	so how can tell that you
S0012	i've get that bite wrong
S0008	oh
S0012	not your
S0013	how many miles you've do
S0012	how many miles you do that's it
S0008	and how many miles you've get leave to go
S0012	and how many miles you've get leave to go
S0008	ah right
S0012	that'll tell you that
S0008	yeah
S0012	and er you know that'll tell you lot of bits and piece
S0008	mm
S0012	i mean we're only get it on on er
S0013	average speed and that it tell you doesn't it
S0012	yeah it'll tell you your average speed and that
S0013	which be usually about twenty two miles
S0012	yeah
S0013	an hour
S0012	ain't that weird
S0013	even if you've do a long trip and you've do over
S0012	you you do over seventy mile an hour along a motorway right
S0008	yeah
S0013	well seventy
S0012	and you
S0013	perhaps
S0012	well seventy mile an hour
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah that's what i say seventy mile an hour along the motorway if you if you
S0008	yeah
S0012	carry on that speed and then you come down and you wait at traffic light for
S0008	mm
S0012	five minutes and then you go off
S0008	well that's not even five minutes be it
S0012	no
S0008	barely a minute
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and then you go off and and you're
S0008	yeah
S0012	go behind a load of traffic and you get to your average speed and it never that's never be more than twenty five mile an hour
S0008	mm that's right i mean you know that
S0013	i mean
S0008	because like you drive from here down to london south london
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's about a hundred and thirty miles right
S0012	yeah
S0008	so you think oh sixty mile an hour that's only two hours
S0012	that's right
S0008	why do it take four hours to drive there
S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	and like most of that be on a motorway
S0012	that be yeah
S0008	where you're just
S0013	yeah
S0008	thunder along
S0012	thunder along yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	and then
S0008	you know why do it take four hours
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	can't make it out
S0012	no
S0008	if it be bloom
S0013	yeah
S0008	if that be er bypass be
S0012	oh god
S0008	obviously on there crawl through there
S0012	that's that's all do now innit
S0008	no
S0012	be it finish yet
S0008	they've still get a forty mile an hour limit on it ain't they
S0012	have they
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh god whatever for
S0008	and you get all the traffic nose up so you're actually only do thirty
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	why have they get a forty mile a limit on it still
S0008	well cos there's still roadworks
S0012	yeah but
S0008	and you know they don't like cars go quickly past roadworks
S0012	yeah but they they don't work on sunday and yet it's still forty mile an hour
S0008	yeah yeah yeah
S0012	i mean we've be down there and it's still
S0008	that's just
S0012	forty mile an hour
S0013	yeah
S0008	that's just to annoy people i think
S0012	yeah
S0013	well i suppose they can't change it just like that
S0012	no i i can understand them have forty mile an hour when when
S0008	mm
S0012	when they're when they're dig hole and
S0008	well it's like
S0013	mm
S0008	on the motorway as well innit
S0012	yeah
S0008	they say
S0013	mm
S0008	oh roadworks ahead fifty mile an hour
S0012	fifty mile an hour
S0008	and you drive for miles and miles and miles at fifty miles an hour okay go now
S0012	yeah
S0008	the
S0012	end it say
S0008	what be all that about
S0012	yeah
S0008	just to slow you down
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	i i don't want i don't to ever break the speed limit you you do it once didn't you
S0008	yeah my sister i go to see her the other day and she have be to something at and she come back through at
S0012	oh yeah that's a bad bite there innit
S0008	half past one in the morning
S0012	yeah
S0008	and get do by the speed camera for do thirty four miles an hour
S0012	what
S0008	on a thirty mile an hour limit and it's gonna cost her
S0013	that's awful
S0008	eighty six quid
S0013	but it's so easy just to do that extra bite isn't it
S0008	i mean at one o'clock in the morning
S0013	yeah
S0008	when you're crawl along there it's i mean if
S0012	you feel silly don't you
S0008	yeah
S0012	when someone er drive up behind you and you're go thirty mile an hour on
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and there's nothing at all around
S0008	yeah i tell you what i'd rather like through i'd rather drive at twenty mile an hour than thirty
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos twenty mile an hour you be in definitely in slug hard mode aren't you
S0012	yes you be
S0008	you know what i mean you're just sort of like okay crawl along at twenty mile an hour
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be plenty fast enough actually when you you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	except that all these others cars wanna do thirty right
S0012	yeah well the the other cars behind you
S0008	and once you're do thirty it's so easy to do thirty five
S0012	that be yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know if you be do twenty and you speed up a little bite
S0013	yeah
S0008	and you're still
S0012	yeah
S0008	go less than thirty
S0012	luckily we we get
S0013	yeah
S0012	a thing on our our motor which you put in
S0013	when you
S0012	we haven't use it yet it's speed control
S0013	yeah
S0012	and you put in i don't wanna do over thirty that won't do over thirty
S0008	well they need something like a big hammer like when the speed go to go over
S0012	yeah
S0008	it go bang
S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah you can put your foot down
S0008	yeah
S0012	and that'll go up to thirty and then
S0008	mm
S0012	and that'll slow it but we haven't use it
S0008	but you can you
S0013	couldn't you ask them when we go
S0012	yeah i will
S0008	you can see it in a few years' time
S0013	show us the cruise control
S0008	that cars will have build in satnavs
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	and with build in speed control as well
S0012	yeah
S0008	for towns
S0012	well you can see that come off
S0013	mm
S0012	can't you
S0008	you know
S0013	they should do
S0008	and you think well if they're gonna be so rigorous in control speed that's what they should do
S0012	yeah of course it be yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know and then there'll be someone say oh yeah but what about if i want to accelerate to get out of a problem and you say well if you're do thirty there won't be a problem
S0013	if everyone's do the same
S0012	there shouldn't be a problem
S0013	it's not likely to happen be it
S0008	mm that's right
S0013	really
S0012	yeah there there be a
S0013	especially if they have oh what be it radar
S0012	yeah
S0013	radar
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah well they've get that now
S0008	i mean
S0013	so that you can't
S0008	yeah i mean like with erm with satnavs and things i mean the the they already
S0013	mm
S0008	can you know put in i mean they're so accurate aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	they can stick in where the thirty limit be and where the forty limit be
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	where the fifty limit be
S0012	well they they get a mercedes now out right that can go by satnav along the road with no driver
S0008	mm well that's basically what you need innit
S0013	mm
S0008	i mean you know okay you can still drive
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you'll be drive along
S0013	yeah
