S0255	mm
S0319	the bedroom furniture for ours oh
S0255	yeah
S0319	but erm because to have you know the fit bedroom furniture in the lounge it's not gonna work properly it's gonna be a bite here a bite over there
S0255	mm
S0319	you know cos there be not we're four inch short of wall span to have the whole run that we've get
S0255	oh
S0319	in the bedroom so that mean we'll be over
S0255	that's so annoy isn't it when you measure you think exactly this and this and er it's it's even if it's an inch it just
S0319	yeah
S0255	it won't physically cos you can't squash wardrobes a bite can you or
S0319	no
S0255	or furniture
S0319	no
S0255	well you know what i mean and it's just that
S0319	oh
S0255	little tiny bite
S0319	this be it so it's gonna be four inch short oh to go across the main wall so that'll be then go across the window oh by four inch and i say i can't have that oh
S0255	mm
S0319	cos i suppose really from outside it's only gonna be look like it but then it mess up as well not happy with the curtain track and everything so it's not gonna work oh but i oh i don't believe it there's like four inch
S0255	mm
S0319	oh but so he's work it out how it can go in little un's room but as i say we've get to wait until he's come scrap the ceiling put the stuff back on whatever it be and make it flat thank you darling oh and erm go from there oh which it'll be alright when it's do and it'll look nice when it's do oh but it's just the fart arsing around the middle oh and all this
S0255	it's cos you're do all the room as well if it's one room you sort of move stuff stuff get do
S0319	yeah
S0255	and then it get put back and it's a bite of upheaval a bite of dust
S0319	yeah
S0255	and because you're do different room you move stuff from one to the next and into the next
S0319	yeah oh
S0255	so do you think it will all be do by christmas like think or hop
S0319	well this be he keep say you can have it do he say
S0255	yeah
S0319	what's hold us up now he say be he's
S0255	mm
S0319	cos once 's be he say we can then get the bedroom furniture move cos we know the front room isn't gonna get do
S0255	mm
S0319	which be our bedroom once the units and that get take out yeah it's gonna be hotchpotch
S0255	yeah
S0319	oh until the new year
S0255	yeah
S0319	but i say i don't that doesn't matter to me because
S0255	no as long as your lounge be okay
S0319	as long as everything's
S0255	that you can sit in it and
S0319	yeah
S0255	yeah and it's clear

S0255	and you can get to bed and
S0319	yeah
S0255	not have a problem
S0319	this be it
S0255	mm
S0319	erm but you know i say and then next year oh cos i mean the wall will have to be all scrap and
S0255	mm
S0319	i suppose like they do on the ceiling
S0255	yeah
S0319	cos the wall
S0255	well we have to with 's lounge and bedroom
S0319	mm
S0255	we have to do the ceilings didn't we
S0256	yeah

S0255	oh it be really hard work do it i keep try to do it
S0256	well
S0255	and couldn't really do it you be do bits you could do it couldn't you
S0256	yeah
S0255	but it be hard work
S0256	mm
S0255	and then be just go che che che and do it really easy so i mean it be hard work but he just do it so in the end we with the we just sort of go well
S0319	you do that then
S0256	me and do that then do quite a fair bite didn't we and then we do like the
S0255	yeah
S0319	well this be it i be

S0319	yeah
S0255	mm
S0319	especially like
S0256	cos you
S0319	like the ceiling it's probably harder
S0256	cos you're at an
S0319	yeah
S0256	yeah if you're at an angle it's really awkward
S0255	mm
S0319	erm
S0255	do you want some cheese

S0319	yeah
S0256	in our that's our command
S0319	yes
S0256	and then the team leader of that command as a whole
S0319	yeah
S0256	be it be and then they've now swap so he 's go downstairs to 's place and 's come upstairs to us
S0319	oh right
S0256	so he be my boss's boss so he's
S0319	oh so he's he's be a
S0256	's boss
S0319	an arsehole
S0256	the old guy well he be a right pain in the bum anyway to be honest like
S0319	mm
S0256	you'd try and ask him for things and he'd just take age decide and like like with my christmas holiday when i be ask him about that
S0319	yeah
S0256	he be the one that be like oh oh well i don't know oh well i i can't say oh well i can't look at it now and then he be like well i can't look at it it'll have to be look at by the new one when he come up and i'm like just make a decision
S0319	and be that sort now
S0256	yeah it's sort
S0255	mm
S0256	but that be sort of pretty instantly when the new guy come up within a couple of days he say yeah it's fine and sort it but
S0319	that's naughty really cos i mean if people be rely on that for bits and piece
S0256	yeah i'm not be funny i work really hard for it and
S0319	yeah
S0256	i ask
S0319	yeah that's it
S0256	for it to be put through on a different month so yes i choose for it to be different to other people
S0255	yeah
S0256	but that's because i want
S0319	yeah
S0256	to spread it out
S0255	out yeah
S0256	and i want to spread the tax out
S0319	this be it
S0255	yeah
S0256	which be smart and nobody else think of that at the end of the day and i'm i'm one i'm probably one of the only people that's think of it but that's not that shouldn't be something
S0255	mm
S0256	that's go against me i i'm well within
S0319	yeah
S0256	my right to put it through as a different month
S0255	yeah
S0319	yeah
S0256	and he's he's reject it and he didn't think the stupid thing be he's reject mine and someone else's on the team something they're not their not their bonus it's something else but he didn't email and say i've reject these for this reason
S0255	yeah can you tell
S0256	he just reject them
S0255	yeah
S0256	he didn't tell anyone
S0319	with it with it be wag though
S0255	or tell to do it or not
S0319	why you know how can you have the authority to reject wag
S0256	it's it's not it's not wag it's bonus it's a special bonus
S0319	yeah
S0256	it's not actually wag because our overtime we put through separately and and our team leader agree that but because it's a special bonus
S0319	because you've do all those hours over
S0256	because i've do all those hours yeah because
S0255	mm
S0256	it's a special bonus it have to be agree by her boss
S0319	yeah
S0256	whereas our overtime hours she just agree them and they go through and they get pay by hr
S0319	so this be
S0256	but it's a special bonus be pay differently it have to be agree by someone higher up
S0319	yeah but if he know obviously your boss know that you have do the work and like and he know
S0256	he he reject it
S0319	he shouldn't be allow to reject it
S0256	because it because it's because it's be put through in the time when he cross over and go down to a different department he's basically just decide that anything to do with our command be nothing to do with him anymore
S0319	oh he's just be a pompous arsehole
S0256	he be he he be an arsehole
S0255	cos he should do that and then just send he should have send a message through to either
S0319	yeah
S0255	or the new guy
S0319	yeah
S0255	and say i'm not action these just to let you know
S0256	yeah and he didn't
S0319	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0256	the point be though this be the sort of man that he be my team leader be very very close but if he hadn't have leave our command she be gonna make a formal complaint about the way that he treat her
S0255	yeah
S0256	he be not a nice person to her at all he like
S0319	no it sound that
S0256	belittle her and all sort and he be like always really hard on her
S0255	mm
S0256	she be really she's new she's new to be a team leader she hasn't be do it that long and he be really really hard on her and really horrible to her the whole time and actually it constitute bully and i use to watch it i use to sit often and think
