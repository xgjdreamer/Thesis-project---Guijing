S0013	oh
S0278	i mean i don't
S0012	that's two thousand and eleven
S0013	mm
S0278	mm
S0012	that's over four years ago
S0278	i have another chat with erm the chap at they do all the aluminium stuff and he's work he's in there from artwork department he start off same as me coreldraw
S0012	mm
S0278	er rubbish computer have to send it by some funny mean into to the cutter work with vinyl now he's their top design bloke
S0012	be he
S0013	oh
S0278	but he say cor think about all those days what it be like and we put there be the trouble be sign makers give a price for the job and if you end up do more work on the artwork that's part of the sign
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	if you're a designer
S0012	oh yeah
S0278	you charge for every hour you spend
S0012	yeah
S0278	do it
S0013	but you be kind of a designer aren't you
S0278	but people don't expect it they want a sign and and you give them a price at the begin
S0013	yeah but if they give you a sheet of paper say this be what i want on my sign and it's this dimension and you do it like that that's signwriting but then you you actually say well well they ask you can you put a train here and
S0278	mm
S0013	that's
S0278	well
S0013	design isn't it
S0278	no i i generally suggest things and they go along with it now i
S0012	but
S0013	so it's your fault
S0278	need to say that's
S0012	do that cost them more then when you suggest that then
S0278	no i'm generally suggest keep it simple
S0013	mm
S0278	don't add too much get them to look at your website everything'll be in the website give them simple information that they can take in not tell them everything that's on your website
S0013	mm
S0278	on the board so they can't read anything
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0278	and erm there be one guy just do one for he's come back and say yes that's lovely we've get the first erm image i do first of all he send me what he'd like and i say well er if you don't mind could i just the first my first first thoughts be that you've say erm erm you're 's premier plumbers since nineteen fifty five that's great and then you're say serve and the surround area and i i think that say that you're their be 's premier plumbers for that many years that say you're serve and the area in a better way
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah and it do yeah
S0278	so leave that line out then you've get more space for to make things bigger
S0013	mm
S0278	for what you're say
S0013	yeah and not be
S0012	yeah
S0013	repetitive yeah
S0278	and he's follow that advice and now i've manage to get a huge logo down the bottom right the way top to bottom two and a
S0013	mm
S0278	about two foot high be
S0012	yeah
S0278	the logo erm and then which say 's er no plumb heat and bathrooms across the top but then he come back and say i want the comma after the plumb
S0012	oh
S0278	i've never ever put punctuation mark on a sign but he want it and he's happy now he's get it so
S0012	oh
S0278	he want it and then
S0013	mm
S0278	then it then it say underneath 's premier one in a yellow in a in a greeny a yellowy green which be what he pick before on the draft he send me and i think well he obviously like those colour there in the bottom the logo's a sort of a that blue
S0012	oh right
S0278	erm and and a very light grey that say since the date at at the bottom establish so and so at the bottom and the be light grey which you won't see from a distance but that be what the specification be for the pantones
S0012	mm
S0278	and 's and then along the bottom in a darker grey he's get his website and the phone number now that's all you need and it
S0013	yeah
S0278	look really nice and then i've send it back on saturday and this morning he send me an email from his ipad erm say that's lovely thank you

S0278	what
S0012	the vent
S0278	oh yes it have drop
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	i have an idea i have an idea
S0013	oh dear
S0278	look my the thing be when the sun's on my roof that area that loft heat up
S0012	yeah it do
S0278	cos it's face south
S0012	yeah
S0278	now if i build a box just underneath the tile that's gonna heat up run a pipe down into my lounge and have a little pump a blower so in the winter when the sun's out it'll blow warm air down into the lounge
S0012	yeah it could do yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and all it will cos to run be a little fan
S0013	mm
S0278	that would put a whole hairdryer up there couldn't i tape that on and
S0013	you ought to get your loft insulate don't you
S0278	no well that's the problem the loft be insulate so none of the heat in the loft go down through the ceiling
S0013	oh i see
S0278	that's you see you insulate
S0013	i think you say it wasn't
S0278	this loft and it's the one place that warm up in the winter
S0012	yeah
S0278	and you're not use the heat
S0012	no
S0278	be i on a winner could be this could be a market thing
S0013	mm
S0278	so you have a box a a a you know it doesn't have to be deep
S0013	mm
S0278	that be stick be right up seal up to underneath your felt so when the tile warm up in the sun the air in that box warm up
S0012	mm
S0278	and all you've get to do be then be pump it down into the roof
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	er but you're waste all that because you insulate the wrong bite if you insulate well no if you
S0013	yeah
S0278	insulate under the tile you're not gonna get the heat in either
S0012	no no
S0278	but you insulate all the pip and
S0013	mm
S0278	on the floor of the loft but get this lovely warm air air up there that's not go anywhere
S0012	that's true
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's why we have the doors to the conservatory
S0278	mm
S0012	open
S0278	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	cos that actually heat the house up
S0278	mm

S0013	oh erm
S0012	instead of thirty quid a
S0013	two hundred
S0278	mm
S0012	cos we don't use much in the dairy
S0278	mm
S0013	yeah what
S0012	instead of thirty quid every six months or four four weeks
