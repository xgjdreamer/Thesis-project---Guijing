S0654	be you
S0653	it doesn't really make any a lot of sense do it
S0654	no i couldn't
S0655	a more random one i like it
S0654	i be i be listen but i didn't know where i be look at the picture as well but at some point i get stick on the picture there
S0653	don't take any more lego out leave them in there and you just need to select the lego one bite at a time
S0655	i didn't really have i could only fit it on that page because
S0653	i love it
S0655	so i couldn't really do much of a story
S0654	i want can you comic
S0653	but there be a story there
S0654	because i like it
S0653	you like it
S0654	yeah
S0653	there be a story story there it's lovely and it's get
S0655	i be
S0653	a begin a middle and an end
S0655	i be plan to do a different story but then i find out how much how little i have leave so i
S0653	oh
S0655	couldn't properly do mummy guy
S0653	well you could always have do two page no no but on a new piece of paper
S0655	true
S0653	but that's partly why writers plan isn't it so they can work out do you know it's call storyboarding
S0655	storyboarding
S0654	what's storyboarding
S0653	when you literally do write sort of you be draw square and in those square you work out what's gonna happen in term of the action so if you're do a cartoon you know that you've get you need twelve square for the action but this be terrific cos you do this all on your own
S0655	mm
S0653	it's lovely
S0655	and i do do it out of my mind as well
S0653	that's my concern to be honest
S0654	i love you
S0655	why
S0653	cos it's crazy no i love it i love it
S0654	and i also love
S0653	and do you know what when you be like twenty nine and you look back and you think wow i do this when i be just nine
S0655	well if
S0653	you'll be very impress
S0655	probably
S0654	yeah maybe when you
S0655	although twenty nine i wonder how erm far i'll be in the draw world or the electronics world
S0653	yeah well and i be gonna say that's the easier thing about do cartoon when you can do it use computers because then if you run out of space it doesn't matter you can sort of sort it all out it's like when people use typewriters and i think i've show you and they make a mistake and it's like er man and that's when they invent tippex to that white liquid fluid to go over mistake because if you'd write a whole letter out type a whole letter out and you make one mistake you didn't want to rewrite the entire document whereas as a on a computer if you make a mistake you just go back and change it
S0655	yeah that's why people can go really fast on the computer
S0653	mm
S0655	but when they're type they make load of mistake and they go over them
S0653	yeah i mean if you get if you do a lot of type you do get use to it and you don't make too many mistake i'm pretty good at not make too many mistake but i i do make a few but yes as you say it's the get it down on the on that page that you can do without worry about spell and things so much
S0655	yeah
S0653	i love it but you have you get yes so do you look at the book that i give you for christmas about how to draw cartoon and stuff
S0655	yes
S0653	do you do that
S0655	i do
S0653	ah be there a space in there to draw cartoon too
S0655	erm let's have a little check i think there probably be
S0654	no remember when you do that pirate book that pirate story
S0653	which
S0654	he do a pirate story
S0653	you do a pirate story do you
S0655	i think so i might have do it in here
S0653	okay
S0655	while be do lego i couldn't in fact write in here oh those er be cartoon character and you can see them there's even danger mouse
S0653	ah but yours be amaze i really like it
S0654	and mickey mouse
S0653	you're and mickey mouse yes
S0655	yeah expressions a basic face
S0653	oh yes
S0653	that you can do for
S0653	because you're very good at make character up aren't you and the story
S0654	he's also very handsome
S0655	yes i'm amaze at character
S0653	so that's not an issue be it but this be a good all round guide to how to
S0654	he's also handsome
S0653	
S0655	yeah
S0654	yes
S0653	that well how be that useful in term of his cartoon career
S0654	he's get a nice face and it'll sell book

S0654	you you teach us widdle
S0655	yeah you be the one who
S0654	and stool
S0655	if it wasn't if it wasn't for you we wouldn't know the word exist
S0653	sit up but what what's the context what be i talk about at the time
S0655	you be talk about you when you when you mention sexy
S0654	about how there be erm a film about a little programme about how you about how
S0655	oh yeah
S0654	about people have sex
S0653	what
S0655	yeah it's true
S0653	do i
S0654	yeah
S0655	remember when you be tell us that it doesn't erm tell you how to have sex properly
S0653	huh no i don't remember this conversation at all
S0654	yeah
S0653	be i very tire
S0654	no
S0653	what be the programme about
S0655	it be about we be talk about baby and then you say that on youtube you can look at how to have sex but it doesn't show it properly
S0654	and people just start want to have things like they like when they're try to do it exactly like that
S0653	i be yes i be talk about how children 's age be watch something call pornography
S0654	what's pornography
S0653	which be what i've so yes which be people have
S0654	oh my god
S0653	er they get pay to have sex and it yes
S0655	ah
S0653	and yeah often the women be very badly treat and it hurt and it's not very nice erm and
S0654	ah
S0653	and yes you're absolutely right all the boys that watch it then think that that be how you're suppose to have sex all the time and the girls watch it and think that they must behave like the the women in the film which be not very nice usually so that's the correct context
S0653	and that's call parent whereas the way you be say it sound like i be just say yeah there's this programme that show you how to have sex but it doesn't show you how to have sex properly
S0653	and that mean it's like alarm bell be go off and i'm think what on earth be we talk about and when do that conversation occur and so i understand and i be just draw your attention to it because
