S0539	mm
S0538	we be alright it's a civilise place you see be
S0546	i be surprise though that you didn't get it
S0539	i know
S0538	our electric's
S0539	everywhere else do
S0538	funny in that it seem to have three different source of supply cos a quarter of can a third of can go out and the other two thirds be on two thirds can go out and there's still a third leave on so it must be three different type er of suppliers
S0546	well this be funny because mine can be on
S0538	yeah
S0546	and yet up there up
S0538	yeah
S0546	up the little cul de sac
S0538	yeah
S0546	they must be on a different one because theirs'll or one side of the road
S0538	yeah
S0546	theirs'll be off er and mine'll be on or vice versa
S0539	mm
S0538	mm well that's how it go isn't it
S0546	mm mm
S0538	so no we never get er well er we do get a we do get a little blip didn't we because the tellies go off
S0539	oh yeah only
S0539	very briefly though
S0546	yeah
S0538	but it do enough to turn the telly off and then it take three days before it come back on again
S0546	why's that
S0538	i don't know there's a component
S0538	it's a fault er with 's and er and i be in the lounge and there's a component in the back that's faulty cos i take it there's a bloke do them at he's very good
S0546	yes
S0538	at repair
S0546	yeah
S0538	and er oh he say i know what that be he say it's er a little component in the back he say it's a faulty component and they should have be replace with panasonic really but they never have be but it from and he quote from which year to what year that they be faulty
S0546	and yours come into that
S0538	but he say we can put another component in er i think he say it would be seventy quid or something like that because he say he have to take the screen out to get into the
S0546	back
S0538	where the component be
S0539	mm
S0538	so that be that be where a lot of the cost be cos he have to come out and take the screen out
S0546	yeah
S0538	and then take the thing
S0539	you'd think panasonic would fix it though
S0538	panasonic should've recall them and put them in
S0539	yeah
S0546	yes yeah
S0546	that's what they do with the cars
S0538	that's what they should have do but obviously they don't
S0546	mm
S0538	want to do they the cost but he say that that's what it be he say i know what it be i know exactly what it be but he couldn't really understand why it have to be switch off for three days he say it must have to empty itself of all the electrics
S0546	mm
S0538	in the
S0539	mm
S0538	set and it take about three days don't it
S0546	which be
S0539	mm
S0546	awkward isn't it
S0538	well it be if you've only one telly
S0546	yeah
S0539	mm
S0538	so but no you it doesn't speed up any it isn't any different it's be off a few time when power go off than if you switch it off if you switch it off at night it's the same thing it have to be on
S0546	oh
S0538	all the time
