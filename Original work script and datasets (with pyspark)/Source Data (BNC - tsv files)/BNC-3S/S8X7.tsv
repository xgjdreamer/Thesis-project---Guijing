S0041	right and if he say well what about the haematoma i'll say oh no no it's fine i've tell them about it and as long as i go for my scan today and take my scan result to prove that it's just haematoma it's just a bruise really isn't it and the fin the just need to okay for me to say yes i'm happy to put her forward for it and hope that he's daft enough to just do it
S0086	to be honest if he's anything like my gp he'll be like who be you what be you yes fine come and get this letter be like i don't know i don't think he's go to question it cos he sound like he's not really that bother he just be keen to get you out of the doctor's surgery really he wasn't really engage with you
S0041	no so
S0086	yeah well that sound like a plan and then leave work at twelve one
S0041	one yeah i'm just go to say to them if you don't want to do it we're go to have a problem cos i'm go to stab it open and you're go to have to deal with it as emergency so your choice
S0086	yeah the fork actually turn out yeah
S0041	i will literally use the fork
S0086	the fork be actually a viable option who would have think last week the fork would have be a viable option
S0041	yeah just go to do it and i'll tell you what oh my god the solicitor send me a letter
S0086	national accident helpline
S0041	well it's gould solicitors oh my god they're fuck thick as pig shit
S0086	oh no
S0041	she get the statement wrong the time on it twelve pm she write
S0086	good wasn't it be
S0041	yes yes something else be wrong i just think fuck that and rip it up send her an email say fuck off if i can't trust you to write a statement you've get no way of represent me not a clue no way so fuck off
S0086	so be that someone that's appoint by national accident helpline
S0041	yep no way can't trust them
S0086	can you get someone from tezza
S0041	i'm go to barr ellison
S0086	okay fine
S0041	and they have a be tell me they have an office within the hospital so tomorrow when i'm there i'm gonna go straight to barr ellison and do it through them so it's just ridiculous that somebody that you don't know that you know just didn't wasn't think properly can have so much of an impact and be sit here think of you know when you have a problem you always think there be a way round his there be a way i've just get to find it and i be sit think there isn't one there's actually nothing i can do
S0086	at this point this and it's all down to the hand of other people it's just that butterfly effect isn't it like if you have if you'd be on an an eight be shift rather than a ten be shift you know if the bus driver have stop if you'd go a slightly different route you know and all of those things
S0041	if the gp have say keep off your feet
S0086	yeah don't go swim
S0041	do i tell you i've get two haematomas
S0086	yeah oh well i be there when they say leg cos actually there's a mark of the bar isn't there isn't there like a straight line on your leg well that's it's just mad like how it can have such an effect
S0041	yeah just one thing just spiral i be speak to she be like i can't believe this be what you've get to accept i can't believe that that's the option there's get to be a way round it we've try everything her chris and i be all google ways to do it i say do you know what if i know a doctor and i think i know every profession through uni i know lawyers i know opticians i know all sort i know one of everything coders stupid computer people anything i don't know a doctor i don't know a surgeon
S0086	i don't know a do i know a doctor not that i could call up i mean i go on a few date with a guy a two years ago don't think that really count unfortunately
S0041	cos i say to you know they say six weeks if they cut it open say that's bullshit six weeks in a c section cut half your abdomen open
S0086	really
S0041	she say i'm tell you know if they cut that open say two inch three inch we're talk a week if you take the week off work keep your leg up you're talk a week and you'll be good to go
S0086	well yeah cos when i have my knee cut open and it be all like that it probably be about ten days before i could walk on it and that be twenty stitch so yeah
S0041	we're talk six stitch if that
S0086	yeah and that's if they do all of it
S0046	yeah
S0086	it shouldn't be even if they have to scalpel it open say it's like that big they only scalpel off a little bite at the top and squeeze it out wouldn't they
S0041	yeah
S0086	how be they go to get it out be they just go to
S0041	they literally just scoop it out
S0086	scoop what
S0041	okay cos they say they can't needle it because it's congeal what if they can cos there's something really squidgy there's not all of it congeal what if they vacuum it out with a syringe get most of it out my body get rid of the rest because as long as it's not this big heavy mass and all that's need be the pulverise vein in there
S0086	yeah
S0041	that's basically do my body's work for it
S0086	yeah i mean i think they probably just want to get rid of it all or nothing because i suppose you would run the risk then of it a you open it so if you then train it could be in a bite of trouble also it might just fill it with blood again because there's still a pouch so do you speak to about whether he's get em private health insurance
S0041	no he's in shit in the divorce thing i just didn't want to
S0086	be that actually be that this week or be it next week
S0041	mm it's this week
S0086	this come this come week
S0041	they've have it yeah
S0086	they've have it how be it
S0041	she be a douche she didn't even say hi to him
S0086	really
S0041	yeah have the gumption to say let's have half the divorce now and half the divorce when your invitation money come through and she be so badly behave during the hear the judge actually say i think you'll find the compensation be in order because of pain and suffer to one person and quite frankly i don't see any pain of suffer that have come your way the past thirty years so no we won't be do that
S0086	wow
S0041	mm
S0086	she must have really piss him off well they must have just see her for her true colour she's out there for money she's not upset because she think it's her right to have it mean that she do but it's not she's not entitle to that money just because she happen to be marry to him there's no love there it sound like
S0041	no
S0086	she's just out for his money
S0041	and the whole time both only solicitors be suppose to speak and she be write post it note and wittering and whack them in front of the solicitors face and really show herself up and my dad just say the judge be pay him more attention than her completely blank her and my dad didn't say anything
S0086	right
S0041	but just because he must have be so fuck off with the way she be behave and i say well if you think about it she's use to deal with people that aren't as bright as her so the judge have see her a billion time over gold diggers come every week to him
S0086	yeah absolutely
S0041	spot them a mile off
S0086	well he's get to make a judgement call hasn't he on the very small amount of time that he get to spend with the people in front of him and the evidence he's get to make a call on who these people be and as you say he's see that character a hundred time before so ah man well that's that's the start of it though
S0086	so at least my dad's happy
S0041	yeah my dad's quite happy because it's a good judge basically they go away now they've get to answer load of question but mum's get to go and be see a consultant about her life expectancy so in the next hear she's get to prove her life expectancy my dad think it's three years
S0086	oh really
S0041	but we don't know how much of that be lie from her so she's go to have to prove it because if it's three years there's no way they're just go to order a a proportion of his pension because she'll only be able to claim it for three years and then it's go to go back on to the
S0086	into the state yeah
S0041	the state yeah so yeah
S0086	shit three years though that's go to be fuck weird if that's the case
S0041	yeah well her mother my grandma only make it to sixty six and wasn't ill my mum's sixty this year so consider how ill she's be if it's be truthful if she's not be mess on then they reckon it's three years
S0086	it's difficult to know with her isn't it
S0041	difficult to know whether she's lie or not yeah but she'll have to prove it in write now
S0086	mm
S0041	so
S0086	shit hell you're family eh
S0041	fuck nutters aren't they the lot of them
S0086	but the thing be it's for you like there's no sort of relief there's no let up i mean obviously you've get which be quite nice but she's obviously be unwell as well and you don't want to burden her with your problems even though i know she would want you to to go to her because you don't have mum and dad at the moment
S0041	she want me to move back in with her
S0086	do she
S0041	yeah cos i tell her about work and she say you can't you know if this be if this navy thing be go to be next may you can't stay you can't stay live hand to mouth all the time and look after your bank account so i'm go to start apply for new job but she say apply as far as cos i'd rather you just come and live with me she say if you want to go and stay you can go and stay with us you can go and stay with for the weekend and just stay with me during the week
S0086	yeah that's it
S0041	so and yeah i prefer not to do that cos that i prefer to just have my independence but
S0086	well if need must i mean if that's if you really can't stand the job like the thing be with this be that you think there be an end light at the end of the tunnel like you're gear up come the summer that's it i'm go from the hotel it's gonna be good i'm go to start my new career now all that's topple down a little bite not say it's over
S0041	yeah to a whole year from now
S0086	to this time next year yeah and really if you've already be tell yourself it's pokey it's shit now but you know i'm go to out soon to then have to think could i do it for another twelve months and really not just for your own sanity but financially it's not viable
S0041	financially it's impossible yeah
S0086	but that's not to say that there aren't market job or language job out there you know particularly over the summer if you think ah i'll just get a job for the summer you know teach in a language school or something like that i don't see why that would be a problem and then you need to find something from september so just something that's a bite interest
S0041	i mean say be work with her and be bar tend in the bar of the local pub like i wouldn't pay board she say i wouldn't take rent from you because i'll pay the mortgage whether you're there or not she say obviously i'd put something towards food and electricity and that i say yeah but it's not the five hundred pound a month be it she say oh no nowhere near so
S0086	well that would be pretty nice and then at least you can concentrate on get yourself fit
S0041	mm so
S0086	peterborough be quite far

S0041	should have strap a cushion to my chest then i could play please
S0046	next sunday be on
S0041	huh
S0046	next sunday be on
S0041	yes sir
S0046	you'd better not be
S0041	i have a proposition and 's already shoot me down so let's just pretend 's not listen be that i go to the garden centre with yesterday who's obviously redo her whole garden and i think it would be a really nice thing
S0046	i haven't shoot you down
S0041	for us to do all together if we go to the garden centre and buy some compact and just choose some flower and out them all out down the little side i'm not go to guarantee that they will survive
S0086	none of us be go to look after them
S0041	well no
S0086	well what i be think be after
S0041	we could just buy some bulbs and buy some compost and just a have a day in the garden
S0086	if we could if we could what we get then it'll be cheap won't it you've just gotta find roses
S0041	of course just choose the cheapest ones we don't care what look great we'll just choose the cheapest ones buy a load of compost and a shovel and just have a day in the garden
S0046	you you see my theory be the patio
S0041	he's say that he want basically to ask trudy to move these slabs basically like two feet this way so they go to the edge of the conservatory
S0046	patio to the leave of the conservatory
S0086	why why
S0046	i want three cos there's four row of slabs
S0086	yeah
S0046	i want three of them
S0086	right
S0046	one for to get out if if she want to get out and the other three to lay by the conservatory so we've get somewhere to sit comfortably in the summer and bake
S0086	and cook yeah
S0041	we could have a garden day
S0046	i think that's more sensible
S0086	a garden day would be nice i'd quite like a little allotment be think we could maybe we could buy a little
S0046	that's another one
S0041	we could buy a little tray and put them
S0086	that could be where the shed be you know
S0041	yeah
S0046	it'd be better it'd be better that end where the toilet be
S0086	take yeah get compost and plant them down there
S0041	yeah cos you can buy there's a little place in the garden centre you might already know this but i didn't know
S0041	there's a little place in the garden centre make for children that have like runner bean and
S0046	so be that
S0086	yeah i know it's like a little a trough like this isn't it
S0041	yeah yeah
S0086	oh well i go when i be with mum a couple of weeks ago and it's amaze it's like a massive like yeah like a trough isn't it
S0041	easy things to grow for kid
S0086	yeah that's what we need
S0041	shove them in
S0086	cos that's our intelligence level
S0041	yeah
S0046	how be your chillies go
S0046	you need to keep water your chillies darling
S0086	oh no that's well that's what i mean i don't i'm rubbish i only
S0041	no cos they survive
S0046	yeah well we play children game today
S0041	children yeah we could do that
S0046	we play children game today we're allow to do it we use more imagination today
S0041	so yeah we could do that and that would be a nice thing to do one go out in the sun on the weekend
S0046	no it be call childhood imagination
S0041	we'll take the eh take the lot to the garden centre choose easy shit and shove it in the garden
S0086	we well i've also be keep an eye out for like cheap garden furniture cos we don't have anything in the garden that's the thing and then
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0041	it might be the cost effective option i'm afraid
S0086	i wonder if we can like liberate certain things
S0041	liberate yeah
S0046	i'm work i'm work on a picnic bench i've get my eye on the haymakers

S0041	no i use to work in a place where the people who work in the kitchen and do the pot wash be polish and i felt bad that i couldn't speak to them so i just learn a few word
S0041	mm do i tell you about the fake model language test
S0086	what
S0041	so the the women that i saw at the navy she be say she saw my think process for the ct thing and she say that navy be the only force that don't have a
S0046	sorry i'm not try to touch you up
S0041	yeah he be yeah he be
S0046	i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not
S0041	she say me too me please me too me please she say the navy be the only force that don't have a
S0046	it isn't go to take you long to get the hard stiff be it
S0041	intelligence officer
S0046	don't need two people
S0041	em the military have one the raf have one and the navy don't
S0086	okay
S0041	so they have em a communications systems cs basically they have a cs and and ct a ct be slightly higher but they do quite a similar job apart from a ct get plop between ship all the time and to the to the army and to the royal marines and to the raf they get pull out all the time
S0086	wow that's really interest
S0041	yeah so if i go in as a ct chance be i'd be in actually on a submarine they pop them out all the time whereas i want to be sit on a ship cos that's what i like the whole team ship thing
S0046	she didn't text me back by the way
S0046	which make me don't want to go round there
S0046	i need to bump into boob and the other
S0046	at some point they've be quiet recently to be fair
S0046	no we'll get distract
S0046	be take so
S0041	em but they don't have an officer in that division because they're quite mobile they just pop them anywhere and she say they're basically try to melt down cts to merge the ct and the cs which be slightly lower than what do job as one job and bring in em an intelligence officer
S0086	oh yeah
S0041	so she say if you go as em a warfare officer then you could you know if you decide after a couple of years it's not what you enjoy
S0086	bless you
S0041	thank you you could merge over because that's the way it's go to be em as an intelligence officer and what they do be they they're the people that know all the languages all of the languages
S0086	all of those languages
S0041	and they say it doesn't matter how many languages you know because they give you an exam and they've have people go in with a master that speak six languages and they can't pass the test
S0086	oh my god
S0041	yeah and i be like how
S0041	that's me wash those things a million time
S0086	be it
S0041	yeah i can smell it
S0086	allergies
S0041	em she say basically they'll they'll test your brain on how capable you be to learn a language she say cos if you're good at write you're good at grammar you're good at remember that's not what we need i say good cos that's not what i'm good at i don't know any of that shit i'm just good at ear wigging and she's like oh well what we do be we give you a fake model language test a fake watch now it's basically language that they've make up within the force no one know it and you can never learn it cos it's not real em and they give you a passage to listen to a passage to read and test you on it it's completely fabricate
S0086	a make up language
S0041	no but this be a fake thing
S0041	but i'm not talk kind of slang i'm talk all three force have sit down and create an entire language like they have a dictionary for it but it's fake none of its real none of it relate to either a latin language or a germanic language it doesn't have any root whatsoever
S0086	slang but it's just in order to test your comprehension
S0041	yes so what they do be they work out whether your brain can latch on to how a language i structure basically so latin language be structure differently to germanics languages but i mean i know and i've never learn it but just because i can see how it's make up and so they test you on it you've get no chance of revise because it's fake but it test how your brain could latch on to it and she say i've have people come in that have master and they can't get it they can't get it they fail it it's not a mark it's a pass or fail but the guy that they've get that just pass it at the moment be some guy some scouser leave school after gsce he speak eleven languages seven fluently
S0086	shit how do he learn them all
S0041	yeah he just do it in his spare time cos his brain be make to that so she say you know you know after a couple of years will have move over you can sit the test there's no raise but you could just fail it we don't know
S0086	so you do it when you're in there then
S0086	you don't do it as
S0041	it's not that post hasn't be make yet it's go to take a couple of years for them to move the cts over to the css and merge as one role
S0086	well that's good then so you go in as warfare but no you could be do something that's a bite more useful for you languages well that's good
S0041	and she say you know if you fail it you fail it like it doesn't matter but yeah how weird be that
S0086	very weird
S0041	i be like fake language test i say i'm really excite i want to try it
S0086	i have no idea a fake language
S0041	yeah i be like i really want to try it i say do you think i can get it online and pretend and she be like no
S0086	well that would sort of negate the test
S0041	yeah
S0086	i think you mean like it be a fake test like they get it from school or something but actually like it's like a fake language
S0041	yeah how mental be that
S0086	that's a lot of time and effort to go to isn't it to create a fake language
S0041	yeah but to a language person like i tell and he be like fuck i want to go i be like yeah i really want to go too cos it would be really like excite to see if your brain could do it cos you don't get a choice there's no way you can train your brain to do it it just either can or it can't
S0086	yeah
S0041	and i think i think i could do it and couldn't
S0086	cos learner of language so one of you can do it
S0041	the way you learn it
S0086	yeah
S0041	yeah cos like when we move to place abroad
S0086	mm
S0041	i couldn't reply cos i couldn't i never study properly but i could understand everything they be a so we use to stand there and i'd listen to everything i could say in english my name be in italian my name be and the number two obviously really go to all my class
S0086	totally do yeah
S0041	all of them so we'd stand there and for three month i listen to everyone tell him what they be say in english and he reply in italian cos he could study and remember it
S0086	that's weird isn't it
S0041	yeah and my friend because i know her because she come over the year before to our university in hull as a teacher of languages she be a student but that's what you do do the exchange so we go back over to see her and she do say to me fuck like you're screw you never come to any of my class what be you go to do but i stand there and understand everything and relay it to him and then he's reply in italian i'd no idea what the fuck he be say couldn't work it out but
S0086	and that's the thing cos even when you they make you do your oral test all you basically do be learn a passage
S0041	mm hm
S0086	that's what we do for my german exam
S0041	that's all i do so all my write exams i do i'd write an essay spend years go through the dictionary i remember it off my heart couldn't write in now

S0086	so be you go to go to peterborough on friday night again be you
S0041	yeah i think so yeah i think so i think 's have a bite of a hard time of it with i think she's come to the point of there's always be quite a gap between them intelligence wise and so far they've kind of deal with it as in doesn't know and say well actually i i like all the qualities that he have so i'm just ignore that but she spend the last three to six months go through his divorce with him and basically do his account and she's of and shit load of money like thousands and thousands of pound that his
S0086	oh my god
S0041	now ex wife have be hide and i think now she kind of feel that all the work that he's help her with on the house you know tile thing sand help her rake up stuff in the garden and all that snazzer you know she's match and more with what the help she's like intellectually give him for the divorce
S0086	yeah
S0041	and she's like he's lovely and he be nice he be very nice he's very much like a though you know he's a hoverer like she's do things he's can i do this can i help with that and
S0086	you need your win space sometimes don't you
S0041	yeah she's like he's get too much he's around all the time and i want my weekend to spend do my garden or spend do my house and so she's find it quite hard to force him to get his own life a apart from her cos he's just just do everything for her it's a bite weird it's a build weird but she's right in what she's say you know in the long run there must come a point where that's as far as their relationship can go cos they're not equally match so i don't know she's a bite mosh and i think that's a little bite why she want me to move back in there
S0086	mm bite of support here
S0041	yeah so
S0086	it would be nice for you as well but i see what you mean like you can't help but like it's a bite of a regressive step
S0041	mm
S0086	my mum say to me like you know if do get a place on the course of she do move to london or whatever she end up do they'll always be a place for you here and you know i understand if you don't want to move back but you know if it's useful and you know just always know that there's space for us i think she do feel really bad when i come back from croatia and she be like yeah by the way you've get to move out
S0041	you've get to move out yeah
S0086	see you later em
S0041	i suppose she would but she didn't have a choice in the matter
S0086	em it be how it be no that's it and ultimately i would never have stay there i would never have make find somewhere you know she be the one who need it and i be work and you know i be the older sister so obviously go to but yeah depend what i want to do
S0041	you take that role even though
S0086	what the fuck be go on
S0041	what be you do
S0086	they're be dickheads
S0041	yeah i see what you mean though
S0046	i'm sorry we're children
S0041	mm hm
S0041	i know
S0041	i little i think it be burglars
S0046	i'm also a cripple
S0041	yeah it's a bite of a random situation
S0086	mm mm
S0041	but i say to cos be say you know i know it feel like you're take a bite of a step backwards but sometimes you know you have to take a step backwards to move forward and i be like yeah i get that i understand that at some point sometimes you know you just have to swallow your pride and get on with it because in the long run it's go to help you out i understand that hey
S0046	would anyone like one
S0086	no i'm fine thank
S0041	em i say but i like have you here i like that no matter what craziness i'm deal with that
S0086	sorry be i in your way
S0041	like i like no matter what craziness i'm hit with
S0086	mm
S0041	that there's someone i trust that i can run things by not that i don't trust but it's always go to be a very different opinion that i get do you know what i mean
S0086	yeah
S0041	so
S0046	he must think we're right bad asses in the co op
S0046	he be like you buy twenty four earlier
S0041	yeah so i don't know what to do about that
S0086	just you know there's no rush be there
S0041	mm yeah i say that too i say really you know i've deal with this ridiculous wage for longer than now but the the killer be like come birthday time or come christmas time like she say to me
S0086	there's no extra cash
S0041	extra miles in the car yeah she say em i don't mean to be rude but do you want me to give you money for your birthday rather than a gift because i think that's probably go to help you right now and i be like yeah actually i would thank she know that i've get my car come out and she know that i need to replace and it's just it's not nice at twenty five years old to have to rely on somebody else for a bite of cash cos i'm think actually as as dig my heel in as it sound i've study my arse off i'm actually quite capable
S0086	oh absolutely
S0041	and the kick in the teeth be i go to meet her go to meet after i saw the navy guy drive round to her office and she have a young lad with her and i think he be like seventeen turn out he's twenty one and i'm just a granny whatever
S0046	twenty two twenty two
S0041	and he's help her with the account and and just basically chase people of them sort out invoice and they're pay she i saw her with him and she's chase it every single thing he do she's on his back because he's shit he's capable he's go back to uni to be a mature student at twenty one but she have to flow every single phone call that he make he's on seventeen and a half
S0086	really
S0041	yeah and she be like i'm sorry but i watch him and i know you and i can't understand how the hell that's that's equally weight
S0086	it's because of the industries you work in isn't it
S0041	so that's what she's say yeah
S0086	i be shock and appal that actually like entry level job in my office be eighteen grand and that's just bite bite of file bite of staple few contract
S0041	sit there and look like you know what you're do
S0046	mm yeah oh it's do now

S0086	it's bad is'nt it
