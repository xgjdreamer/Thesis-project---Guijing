S0192	oh no
S0227	i climb up there so i've i be able to fix the gutter but it's reattached itself and it's start to climb onto the roof so er i need the first job will be to get up there and reduce that and then i'll go to the back garden and the hedge at the very back we want to tackle lot of like this tree want some tackle the corner tree want tackle erm
S0192	always things to do
S0227	yeah well yeah garden take a lot of work i think so
S0190	do you sleep alright in there
S0192	yes yeah
S0190	you didn't hear any noise from his or anything
S0192	no no i didn't hear anything i kind of stay up for a little bite actually be up i don't know why she be up cos we normally go to bed at ten thirty but she be still up at midnight
S0227	mm
S0192	and her friend pull out so she's on her own all weekend so i feel a little bite bad about that
S0227	well you shouldn't feel bad because erm you er aren't the one who's let her down it's her friend who have
S0192	yeah and i mean she go home when i er she leave me on my own for a few days didn't she when she come out she'll be fine she's get plenty of work to do so
S0227	mm
S0192	she'd get on with that
S0227	well not the the the flat'll be spick and span when you turn up there again
S0192	yeah she's go out to buy some more clean products today actually
S0227	mm
S0192	we didn't have any rubber gloves marigold get to get some of those think she want to give the bathroom a spruce and then mum'll pick me up at one i think
S0227	mm that's what you say yeah
S0192	be it okay to have lunch here before i go
S0227	yeah that's fine
S0192	yeah
S0190	mm
S0192	cool how about tomorrow be you see family or
S0227	more like
S0190	no we haven't get anything plan at the moment
S0192	just more out in the garden
S0227	yeah well well we have quite a few different things on and you know as i say when it's dry and not too cold
S0192	it hasn't rain too it hasn't rain much at all actually since i've be back
S0227	no
S0190	mm
S0192	no
S0190	no
S0227	august be be er colder than average and september's be warmer erm than average
S0192	mm
S0227	so september's actually be a warmer month that august
S0192	september be nice i think when i use to live here before i think england be a very wet i mean it be wet but
S0227	mm
S0192	it's not actually that wet i look at the the chart for how much you know water we actually get
S0227	mm
S0192	it average about forty millimetres a month it's pretty much standard like across the whole year a little bite more in in erm november and those kind of months but i mean korea in the height of their rainy season they receive two hundred and fifty millimetres in one month and that last for like two or three months
S0227	yeah
S0192	and then their lowest month be forty be the same as england
S0227	yeah
S0192	so they they probably get about three or four time more rain than than we do but it it just rain more frequently in england than it
S0227	mm
S0192	it do in korea do that make sense
S0227	we have a very wet winter last winter and it be not cold it be wet erm a couple of days of frost no snow that be it then it be rain
S0192	be that the winter when there be terrible flood
S0227	yeah last
S0190	we have the flood year yeah
S0227	yeah last winter
S0190	there be
S0192	any around here
S0190	erm yeah get a bite we're not near a river here so
S0227	no
S0190	when that get
S0227	mostly it be in the west country
S0192	i remember erm you know when we live on the spring in would flood quite often and then that the river run so
S0227	mm yeah
S0192	do that flood last winter
S0227	mm i didn't go in that much actually i don't remember also that would have be up
S0192	the country's slowly sink
S0227	mm
S0192	so it be the west country that be hit the most
S0227	it take the brunt of it yeah
S0190	oh they really be and so do so do the erm east coast didn't it
S0192	i remember see a train line have collapse or something along the
S0227	cornwall
S0192	along the coast
S0190	yeah cornwall
S0227	cornwall yeah
S0192	cornwall
S0227	it be england and cornwall must er england cornwall devon and cornwall
S0192	yeah they do wanna be their own country so
S0227	mm
S0192	scotland didn't get independence then
S0227	no
S0190	much do they
S0227	despite their engineer which they try to engineer the erm the outcome by put the erm vote down to the er the as sixteen i think alex
S0192	not allow celtic people outside of scotland to vote
S0227	no i don't know how they could defend that but i know the i know the
S0192	how can you say that if no no scottish people live in england can't vote
S0227	yeah it be
S0192	that's ridiculous
S0227	it be wrong erm they know that if they hold there there's a hundred no a hundred and fifty thousand scots live in east anglia alone erm they
S0192	that's quite high
S0227	i think they think that if they can include them erm they would almost to a man vote to stay within the unite kingdom
S0192	yeah because otherwise they'd have to leave wouldn't they
S0227	well they won't have to leave but because they if they join
S0192	well it's if you're talk about the eu
S0227	well there'd be a well no they'd have to apply to the e er u erm there be a lot of problems spain would have be watch this very closely because erm they've get the basque area
S0192	pay basque
S0227	and also erm catalan which want to break away erm to have membership to erm the eu you've get to have unanimous a a unanimous vote so spain wouldn't have vote for a scotland to join
S0192	yeah because
S0227	like turkeys vote for christmas because they could see the breakup of their own country
S0192	yeah
S0227	basque and erm would start make step for a autonomy
S0192	it's not the way we should be go now be it further divide
S0227	no
S0192	we should be try to come together as a people
S0227	yeah also
S0192	i'm all for
S0192	european oh
S0227	also salmond although a lot of bluster didn't convince people that we're regard the pound he he he be erm the man be try to punch well above his weight and he be say that we will keep the pound and if we get independence at the negotiate table this will be negotiate you know he's he be say well after all you know we'll still be friends with people and they're they be our biggest customer and we're their second biggest customer the problem with that be that erm our second biggest customer of five point three million people be a lot easier to replace than their biggest customer of fifty eight million
S0192	fifty eight yeah
S0227	er and also if they have vote for this you're gonna have a lot of english people represent by the mps who be go to be hack off by this and also that the they've they've nail their colour to the mast erm all three m all three leaders of the party the liberal er democrats labour and the conservatives the government and the top of whitehall so if they if they become er an independent country they cannot keep the pound
S0192	yeah
S0227	so erm so it would have be some go full go into this negotiations with the tail wag the dog no erm you're not in a position to bargain really you'll you erm also i think the
S0190	do you want a cup of tea
S0227	yes please and i think it also backfire
S0190	do you want one
S0192	no no
S0227	backfire with the young because the young be think i think they think well there's the dream of scotland you know the independence blah blah blah the break the the the shackle from from the oppressor england but there's also i think a lot of them when it come to commit think with their wallets er you might say to your mat i'm gonna vote for independence but when it come to you in about in the poll booth no one know what you're gonna vote
S0192	no
S0227	it suddenly hit you that er self interest will will kick in here as for the students er right right at this minute they're i'm a scholar i don't don't have to pay for tuition fee if this go out what's gonna happen we're not gonna be subsidise by the by the english taxpayer so erm oh crap we're probably gonna have to pay for this which one would you go for for now
S0192	you're give some people a lot of credit though i'm not sure if people be think that deeply but
S0227	i think the students might have be
S0192	yeah i mean the students
S0227	erm a lot of people would have also vote for fear out of fear for no cos it's better the devil you know than the devil you don't anyone in i think anyone without a job in scotland probably vote for independence anyone who have a job think no i need to keep my job it's there's too much uncertainty there's too much bluster that er alex salmond's say but what happen you know erm not in immediate and individually to the european union er will we end up even if if we do get in there with the euro so yeah but er
S0192	wouldn't it be strange if they didn't get into the european union though
S0227	well the there's a good chance they wouldn't they also they would their position their default position if they didn't what they want with the with the pound be we're not gonna pay our part of the debt
S0192	mm
S0227	try go as a new country to the imf er with them know that er so so your er try to start a business the bank's gonna lend you money but and er you renege on your payments
S0192	yeah
S0227	er let me think about you for a minute erm no
S0192	no
S0227	we're not gonna give you any money if we do we'll give you money but at the moment great britain enjoy triple eight credit rat that's very good that mean that the money we borrow we don't pay much interest for you you're gonna get d that's not even double a or a you're a d that mean for every pound you borrow you're gonna pay back like your student that you'll have no choice because er you need the money so you you'll cobble yourselves to these which mean you're gonna have to
S0227	erm you're gonna have to put things up you're gonna have to put income tax up and stuff like that try and pay for it
S0192	sell off industry and privatise the
S0227	yeah erm you can't er er
S0190	do you want any toast or anything else
S0192	do you have an apple
S0190	yes
S0227	the problem be
S0227	we keep them in the fridge cos see how quickly the fruit go
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's base it's base it's customer base erm you can't tax yourself into you you can't tax the people erm too much you can't tax yourself into prosperity winston churchill use the brilliant analogy when he describe that he say tax yourself into prosperity be like a man try to lift himself up whilst stand in a bucket
S0192	yeah i think i've hear that quote before
S0227	you can't do it it doesn't work
S0192	my opinion of him have be alter a little bite recently by research pigeons and creoles he say have some terrible things he's say about those languages so basically racist he just
S0227	i think he probably be
S0192	there's some quote that be just like you know this be a bastard english and break from full of monkey stuff and i be just like bloody hell when i read some of his quote prior to that i think the guy be quite very educate but this be some real archaic view about
S0227	he fail his er
S0192	language
S0227	entrance exam a couple of time into into eton
S0192	yeah
S0227	and come from a good family erm yes er yes his flaw i think he
S0192	do you ever watch peaky blinders
S0227	yes it's back on again
S0192	he be in that it's back on again
S0227	yeah
S0192	the second series
S0227	yes
S0192	oh
S0227	yes
S0192	yeah he be portray in that wasn't he
S0227	yes yeah erm winston churchill do er er you know he do get involve erm with some
S0190	thank you
S0227	things that weren't particularly nice er also he be very much into a big and he couldn't the sometimes he's make some fundamental
S0190	yeah
S0227	fundamental gap but erm er his his gaffs be erm counter out by his his the positive things that the he be able to do
S0192	yeah
S0227	erm he be the kind of right stuff that we need to run head a country in the war he'd get military experience himself erm erm you know he be man who'd be in in in in a in a battle or two you know and so he know exactly what that how people's mindsets would work and stuff like that you know he kind of fell out of favour come back to favour fell out of favour come back to favour er through the course of his life but yeah he be a you need someone of his grit to to erm to run things because it erm if you know neville and the like neville chamberlain so just wasn't the man for the job erm hitler wouldn't have er churchill would not have trust hitler with when hitler you know chamberlain come back with the white paper erm say that er hitler will not invade poland
S0192	mm have you start watch that then be it on already
S0227	what
S0192	you say peaky blinders be
S0227	be come back on thursday
S0192	oh it's come back

S0227	oh right
S0192	erm before they come and stay with us in england they're travel new zealand for a few months
S0227	right
S0192	that's pretty nice they rent out a van and they're just kind of live out of the van
S0227	well yeah nice it's a good time of the year to come and be erm they've come out of the winter now there's
S0192	but it's still cold
S0227	it's still cold

S0192	proper freeze and
S0227	yes well they've just erm their winter just end it their equivalent now be their erm er their their march middle of march if you be in the uk so they're just at the end of the winter
S0192	yeah they're have a good time as far as i can tell but internet be quite intermittent i think it's all a bite more expensive than they be expect so
S0227	mm
S0192	kind of live quite cheaply out of the out of a van so
S0227	be they work be they work have they
S0192	they work in korea
S0227	yes i know but do they leave when you leave
S0192	yes yeah their contract finish at the same time

S0227	till the money run out and they have to go back and get a job
S0192	his er 's mother come out to korea for the last two weeks while they be there with his brother they travel korea for a couple of weeks then they go to philippines all together for a couple of weeks and then they go home and they kind of go to new zealand
S0227	okay
S0192	for two months and now and then at the end of october they'll come to england and live with us for three weeks which i'm actually a little worry about cos i have four assessments due in while they're here
S0227	mm that's gonna be difficult
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos they're they're they're you're mean to be on two different agendas their agenda be gonna be big fun your agenda be gonna be erm try to do this and
S0192	i mean we're tell them at every step erm to a certain degree we don't owe them too much because when we visit them in in america they be work opposite shift so we didn't actually really do anything with them when we saw
S0227	yes
S0192	we just kind of live in the house for six weeks
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	so erm we've tell them we're gonna be busy with uni and like
S0227	they're gonna appreciate that
S0192	and they'll get on with their own stuff a lot
S0227	yeah
S0192	but but erm i'm hop the assignments er well i've be tell one of the assignments have already be set so i can start get on with that
S0227	mm
S0192	another two will be set two weeks prior to them come so provide i'm just on top of everything
S0227	yeah
S0192	by the time they come
S0227	yeah
S0192	it should be okay
S0227	mm that's the mind see gotta get into be be erm be get his his head around stuff and i mean he do well at erm apparently he do well at erm college
S0192	yeah
S0227	for the year
S0192	be it a short course then
S0227	yeah
S0192	tell you what if i'd have know about that course have a few years off work travel
S0227	mm
S0192	do one year at college
S0227	mm
S0192	get into a much better university than you could have possibly get into if you'd have do a level
S0227	yeah
S0192	and erm receive fund as well
S0227	yeah i mean the work experience have be good for him
S0192	an access course yeah
S0227	it's yeah definite
S0192	i personally think you shouldn't go to university until you're twenty one
S0227	yeah well
S0192	i think you
S0227	yeah
S0192	should be make to take a three year gap whereby you really decide whether or not you want to go to university
S0227	yeah
S0192	try and save up some money to go
S0227	yeah
S0192	have a bite more of an understand of what that kind of debt really be
S0227	yeah
S0192	it bother me that you can turn you're a man and then or a woman at eighteen and now here's a massive debt that you're gonna have to pay off
S0227	mm
S0192	for the next thirty years
S0227	we have
S0192	awful decision
S0227	we have erm graduate our you know we have graduate come in and they do stint and that and er erm the they've get great well they've get an a new crop of graduate come in and one of them's go to be er with next door and the talk be erm we've get one already he's very capable and their the guy who's run the o it's call the and basically it's it's when all the all the work order come in they have to it go onto a onto a system and and er they basically organise it and make sure that plant get be get the right mean to to do the job blah blah blah it's bite of a joke really it be suppose to be all computerise and the machine be intelligent and choose the job it doesn't at all really it's it's a kind of a it's a bust and it's it's it only work because of the effort of the people in the in the thing do to make it work
S0192	oh
S0227	but erm the chap who be one once one and my my boss erm he's run it erm another guy be leave to go to borough and erm he want to get out to erm take over from what he's do which be more in his skills set than run this and who be the erm this the erm graduate be go to be take over until january
S0192	mm
S0227	erm but he curtail his erm his tour of duty to get one in london cos i be think he say about his girlfriend but i be think you didn't want all that responsibility on your shoulder
S0192	mm
S0227	and what the mindset seem to be now be that the new graduate that come in after a very short period be go to be run the and i be think and and the chap's say this this be really not right and i say no i agree with you i say erm you've get the person come in will have no knowledge of civil engineer i it i believe their degree be in business study
S0192	mm
S0227	which be definitely relevant and i say you're gonna be manage people and it's gonna like put a few people's nose out because one of the guy when there be a crop of redundancy kinda two years ago he's he be a manager he's be a manager for twenty five years but and he be gonna lose his job so if he didn't like apply for the one in the he's now just put info on onto the system for it to be do and i if i be him he's my age i think maybe he'll look a bite no he might be a little bite older i find that very hard to bear that you've be a manager for twenty five years now you've get some person who's have no work experience at all they've just go from school to uni and now they're gonna be your manager
S0192	mm
S0227	on a business on a business study degree
S0192	yeah a degree yeah mm
S0227	and you're think and be say whoever it be you know they they've get go first they've get to earn the respect of your peer and then know what on earth it be you're actually do what it spread what you're try to achieve here so rather than just be parachute in oh you've get a degree therefore you're gonna run it cos you've a degree
S0192	i mean i understand to a certain degree why have a degree should enable you to take higher position
S0227	mm
S0192	otherwise the whole purpose of university be just ruin
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	you know you know
S0227	but not to go in to run something that you've get
S0192	but not to immediately do that
S0227	not and then
S0192	you still need to prove your mettle and
S0227	yeah exactly
S0192	but it just should mean that you have the opportunity to step up
S0227	yeah
S0192	because you you've be
S0227	mm
S0192	well you've put the time and the money in as well
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean half of the thing be if i put this amount of money into something

S0227	yeah
S0192	graduate be come out have do course that don't relate to anything they they're just not
S0227	no and there be a say
S0192	it's a problem
S0227	there be no substitute for experience you can be very intelligent but inexperienced and you will make mistake because
S0192	yeah
S0227	you be inexperienced
S0192	i mean i think half the reason and i be do a master at a top twenty five university in the country be because we have work experience in the field

S0192	i'm hot at night i don't i don't really get cold er pretty much last night i sleep out of the duvet
S0190	really
S0192	just it's kind of like well you know like half in it half out of it you know wrap i've always be like that though 's always freeze cold you know and i'm always hot
S0190	i i'm cold normally i
S0192	i have to lie i get into bed first and lie on 's side of the bed for
S0190	to warm it up
S0192	for five minutes to warm it up and then
S0190	bless

S0190	you get into a warm one then if i can get out of the bath then i put my dress gown on and if i get in with that it's far too much
S0192	oh yeah much too warm it's it be a problem actually because although we didn't have to pay bill where we be live last i may have mention this before erm we didn't have any control over the heat and they really wrack the heat up in the whole build over winter and i kind of like you know the air be cold in winter and then be warm under the duvet but i have to sleep with the fan on in like a sheet we be sleep in a sheet and fan throughout the whole of winter because the heat be on much too hot and
S0190	and you've get no control over it
S0192	no no no we don't and it's under floor and it be all like beyond our and we have no control over it and it's all centrally do and in the whole build and there's quite a few and there's about four hundred people that live in one build so it's quite large erm so it be horrible because then summer in korea be extremely hot i mean it's like you know thirty to
S0190	yeah
S0192	to thirty five degrees every day so i just spend the whole of last year hot and like at night
S0190	so you when and erm and that go over to my sisters she always have it warmer

S0192	cheer
S0227	so er it's so new game same game i do it one thing i don't like about this ipad be you hit the wrong button
S0192	i find that in general about all these touch
S0227	mm i i don't like this
S0192	oh i've get it's not allow you to you've gotta wait eight second it's one of these advert that they make you watch
S0227	so i actually when you touch the wrong button and it take you to something you don't want
S0192	no yeah
S0227	right
S0192	oh
S0227	i want new game and not game i hit tour game right erm
S0192	they be pretty nice though aren't they these this 's isn't it
S0227	yeah
S0192	who use it more
S0227	er probably she do just about er okay right there's some similarities with chess this be the river that be the king er i've put them into english sign symbols cos yours be chinese
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0227	it make it so much harder i can i do memorise them but for simplicity it's easier to have these symbols right we'll go from that's the king he can only ever move erm in one square at a time he can go erm there there or there that's what he can do okay
S0192	can he go back
S0227	er yeah
S0192	yeah okay so
S0227	but he can only move in that box that's a palace
S0192	oh okay
S0227	that's the palace
S0192	you've gotta come out
S0227	now what you've get be
S0192	and you can't move diagonally in that box
S0227	er no the minister now the these be minister they protect the king they can move diagonally like that
S0192	okay
S0227	so i'll take that back and that's all they can do they can move like to there and then to there or to there and then to there
S0192	within the palace i guess
S0227	within the palace that's all they can go in
S0192	okay
S0227	now what you've get then be so they be the counsellors then you've get the minister the minister basically erm can move diagonals but big on diagonals so there
S0192	okay
S0227	like that
S0192	can they cross the river
S0227	no they can't cross the river so
S0192	take that one back again
S0227	and they can move to there to there unless there's something block it either an opponent or erm
S0192	and it take it you can't move into the palace
S0227	no
S0192	no so you can only go that way and then that
S0227	knight move the same way as knight move but it it can be block but i have to demonstrate that further into the game erm now the knight can go over the river the cannon can go over the river and the rook can go over your and i'll to the rook do exactly what they do the knight do exactly how they play in chess the l shape move but but not if something's block them
S0192	okay
S0227	your man or or
S0192	can't do
S0227	no
S0192	no which you can do in chess
S0227	yeah rook do exactly the same so i don't need to tell you about what the rook
S0192	okay
S0227	what the rook can do and what now the cannon be different now the cannon erm erm to take i can do this move it to there over the river but to take you i can't take him but i can take him you have to jump over something your own man or
S0192	oh wow
S0227	or the other
S0192	you have to jump over something
S0227	to take it
S0192	as if it's fire a cannon ball
S0227	yeah if yeah to take it you can fire over your own man but it's it erm only take the one it jump over one thing you can't jump over two
S0192	and it can't hit the thing
S0227	no
S0192	it's get to jump over something
S0227	it it take whatever's behind it
S0192	okay
S0227	so now what i'm gonna do be i'm gonna go into a game and you've and i'm and i'll talk you how
S0192	what about these things here
S0227	they're pawn or sorry pawn do as er pawn go up they can go across the river
S0192	okay
S0227	once they go forward though and across the river they can't come back they can only keep move forward or sideways okay
S0192	and you take in a similar fashion you take diagonally
S0227	no you take straight ahead straight on
S0192	oh right
S0227	i'm gonna like now i'll go through a game and give you some like the tactics
S0192	so be this what the chess that we play be base on
S0227	no
S0192	no
S0227	but there be there be similarities
S0192	be this more complex
S0227	a little bite yeah
S0192	it be yeah it look it
S0227	right so what i'll do be er there's various different type of attack what you want to try and do be get out your rook as soon as you possibly can but you you're move to so i move that to there that defend that pawn and it's defend that pawn he's move his er his counsellor out
S0192	oh he do move it into the palace
S0227	you well you can right at the edge but you can't go inside it
S0192	okay
S0227	okay erm so what i do then be erm i'm go to move that pawn up
S0192	put a whole different spin on it if you take vertically rather than
S0227	yeah
S0192	diagonally
S0227	he's do the same i'm go to bring this out to here this so far be protect that pawn erm now what i will do now be i'll go
S0192	and be the end of the game to checkmate
S0227	yeah
S0192	your opponent
S0227	there's no draw in this
S0192	okay
S0192	there's no draw
S0227	right
S0192	why be there no draw
S0227	i just just the rule this a winner there's no draw
S0192	look like in chess where you can keep run around each other can you do that in the same in this no
S0227	yeah no i don't think you can do that no right so that's that he's move his his i'm gonna move my erm castle out as well
S0192	so i'm glad you play it
S0227	yeah
S0192	very
S0227	so he's that now attack that pawn there
S0192	oh
S0227	okay er to defend it what i'll do be i'll move that to there which mean he can be take by that but then i go like that
S0192	and take him
S0227	but now i'm go to what's know as chain chain my er my er er be it i'm get confuse here they're either minister counsellors i'm gonna chain them they're now chain together be you with me if that be there and that or they're chain so let me see if that get take they'll take it back okay
S0192	just automatic though
S0227	yeah well you could you don't have to do that
S0192	okay
S0227	but you that's what you you
S0192	yeah
S0227	you're protect each other they're chain together right so the next move i know that he's now attack that pawn cos i've move that one at a to erm to nullify attack you if you move if you can move the piece out of the way
S0192	because it have to jump over something
S0227	have yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	if you right so if i be to move that there he will take me that's the most valuable piece that's the second most valuable that's the third that's the fourth er the last be the least valuable be the pawn
S0192	do these play much
S0227	they're just defend the in in the palace
S0192	yeah
S0227	okay so what i'm gonna do now be i'm gonna my pawn up to there he's move down he's come in and he could slide that down to there but he won't because i've still get that there so now what i do be i'm i'm gonna do a straightforward it's not a very strategically complex but do that
S0192	it completely change the game doesn't it
S0227	yeah i've now take that that be a stupid move i be just give you a demo
S0192	yeah
S0227	he's now take he take he take my my erm my knight and he's put me in check now to get out of check i i i can do this move to there but i'm gonna
S0192	oh
S0227	yeah exactly or i'd do that
S0192	yeah okay
S0227	that's the move but what i'm gonna do be take these back
S0192	oh you can go back as far as you want
S0227	yeah cos i'm i'm just show you what so i'm not go to take that because i haven't i haven't protect that knight
S0192	no okay
S0227	so to protect that knight now
S0192	pawn can't move sideways i take it
S0227	no
S0192	no
S0227	i will move that up to there that's now protect that pawn he be now
S0192	be he attack
S0227	well he's not attack anything directly but what i can do now be to to get him to move be threaten him directly by do that he's protect that by have my now when i move that pawn out the way erm he he become vulnerable
S0192	how long do it take you to get to grip with this
S0227	probably about an hour
S0192	oh
S0227	and then i would make mistake so he's now defend that by put that down it's quite a tough tune to learn straight away
S0192	yeah i mean it change the whole dynamic of the game doesn't it
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's like chess but not like chess
S0227	yeah so what i do now be i'm gonna threaten his erm now his rook by put my cannon there
S0192	mm
S0227	he will move that which mean i will take that cannon
S0192	yeah okay so he's gonna get something
S0227	because if he doesn't yeah i'm gonna get something out of that this this will be a superior strategy i believe unless there's something i haven't see so i go like that
S0192	what set be you play this one
S0227	easy
S0192	yeah
S0227	he's take one of my minister
S0192	yeah
S0227	but erm
S0192	he can take another one as well
S0227	i've he's but i will take that okay he will take he's come back up to there and take that
S0192	cannon be quite important then aren't they
S0227	yeah
S0227	he he will have lose a cannon now because erm i will do that and he will take my cannon but he's lose both his cannon now he hasn't get any
S0192	mm
S0227	i've still get one i lose a i lose a counsellor
S0192	a counsellor that's what they're call
S0227	so now what i need to do be be protect my cannon so i move it i could move it to there and it's protect by that and that er by the l shape
S0192	mm
S0227	take but what i'm go to do be erm in fact i will move it to there er no he's gonna double up on that so i'll go to there right he's now attack my rook
S0192	yeah okay
S0227	see that
S0192	it's a bite hard to see it over the river isn't it
S0227	yes
S0192	what's the purpose of the river
S0227	erm
S0192	it's just that certain part can't cross over there
S0227	yeah exactly it's just the the the the great divide so now what i do be i'm gonna attack his knight he's probably gonna he's although he's take that he's probably he might come into here which mean he will be attack my my erm my minister but which be defend by that one and that so what i do be i'll go there just see if that see what the promote he's protect it okay
S0192	pawn don't seem to do much although can't he take you oh no you say it's straight on
S0227	it's straight on yeah it's straight on so what
S0192	can the pawn move two space at the begin
S0227	no just the once so i'm gonna try a little tactic now i'm gonna move it up to here still defend ah he's send his i be gonna move that to here and then take that that minister but he be now
S0192	yeah defend it
S0227	defend that minister by by do that that's fine
S0192	and the rook can jump over another rook
S0227	no rook can only take they can't jump over things like they can't in chess
S0192	but you say you be gonna move this here and then
S0227	i be and then double up but he's he's anticipate it he's already move that there if he hadn't move that there i be gonna slide that there
S0192	and attack with this one
S0227	yeah
S0192	okay
S0227	and it would be checkmate if he if he didn't do that but he's do he's pre empted what i be gonna do so what i'm gonna do now be i'm go to use this to take that there he's on the verge of cross over the now erm what do i do now
S0192	have you play this against real people
S0227	no no never
S0192	and what set can you get to on the computer
S0227	er
S0192	just easy
S0227	i i can beat it er i can beat it a lot of the time on easy not every time and the normal and there's like three grade after that
S0192	yeah
S0227	well i've only ever beat it once
S0192	you've beat it once
S0227	it's yeah it's quite tough
S0192	so there's quite a bite of strategy to it then there must be
S0227	indeed yeah
S0192	look at that yeah
S0227	so what i do now i want to i'm gonna pop this up to here although it's not directly attack the king now
S0192	isn't it attack the king now because it can jump over the
S0227	no no there's nothing it the it's only attack it if there's a piece in
S0192	oh if there's something
S0227	in between it yeah
S0192	oh so it can attack this i mean
S0227	yeah but he's put that as far as i'm concern he's put that in a in a bad place
S0227	because now what i'm gonna do be that he's gotta move right he's he's protect that by move that there and it can take me back
S0192	yeah they're very limit those be it counsellors or minister the ones in the box
S0227	er counsellors
S0192	counsellors
S0227	right i'm go to pop that into here which be gonna attack that
S0192	yeah okay
S0227	that there
S0192	next turn
S0227	he be now attack it so now what i do be i should be able to attack that pawn
S0192	yeah
S0227	take that pawn and there's he can take that pawn i'm not worry about that
S0192	where do these ones move again
S0227	diagonally
S0192	diagonally like a bishop
S0227	yeah he he's he's erm he's not chain it at the moment he have bring one out like that so if i go like i can't move it cos it's box in
S0192	oh
S0227	you know what i mean in normal chess you can go like that i can't
S0192	you can't just move it yeah
S0227	cos i'm box in so what i've gotta do be protect it in fact i've lose it i can't move it
S0192	mm
S0227	i can't move it out of that it's go unfortunately so and there's nothing i can do to to protect it so what i'll do then be i'll come back here and i've lose that knight
S0192	it's go
S0227	but now i'm attack
S0192	and can
S0227	that's how
S0192	your cannon jump over your own piece
S0227	yes
S0192	do that count as a jump
S0227	i yeah i i could take
S0192	because you've get your own piece there
S0227	that but i i'm gonna do be it with my my rook because that no i'm go to i'm go to take it with this one he won't take it with that because erm he would lose his rook by my rook by take it but now what i do be be erm
S0192	hang on a minute oh no yeah
S0227	he's he doesn't need to it there's nothing he if that he can't have anything block that er say look even his own piece of mine
S0192	yeah yeah cos you yours be take
S0227	but i can now take a piece of his if i've get a good piece by he's lose that now and i'll show you how when i take that down here that put him into check he have to move than i then do that and i've take his but i lose that
S0192	can you take that back just so i can see you move it down here and say it put him into check how
S0227	yes because
S0192	oh because your rook be
S0227	yes that expose the rook
S0192	okay so yeah so
S0227	okay so he can't do that so i'll take i will take another tack now i now put him back into check there he's go back there so erm
S0192	you be gonna take this piece weren't you
S0227	yeah erm but i'm i've now change my tack so if i go like that again he go there
S0192	just keep go backwards and forward
S0227	i go to there now i'm attack that what do he do there oh he just take a pawn okay still not a problem erm i'm still chain so if he take that i'll take him back
S0192	yeah
S0227	but now what i do be i take his erm minister sorry er minister i've jump over like that that's get that he's take see what he take he he take my mine
S0192	and now you'll take him back
S0227	i can't because it it's i put my king into a check
S0192	oh okay yeah
S0227	be you with me so now i've gotta do something so what i do now
S0192	the chain's a bite wide
S0227	be i go like that
S0192	quite a lot of blood in this game isn't there
S0227	yeah now i'm in check i've get to block that with my and if he move there i've lose
S0192	you move there
S0227	i'll do it again to see it's it's
S0192	yeah that be quite good
S0227	and then i'll let you have a go
S0192	oh well can't we play against each other
S0227	well you can but it's easier to learn against something that you can come back because it it's quite complicate cos it's in chinese symbols
S0192	yeah
S0227	you've gotta first memorise all those
S0192	that's half the fun isn't it
S0227	you've get to memorise all those symbols so if we go like that and we go new game okay
S0192	there's only about six symbols though that shouldn't take me too long
S0227	yeah but it's remember what they be in in in relation to the board so now right i'll one how i normally work
S0192	can you not play two player on this be there no way i can do this and you do that
S0227	no just
S0192	if we put it in the table
S0227	no it's just er
S0192	be there a two player
S0227	not on this i don't think it's just you against the computer
S0192	that's very disappoint
S0227	erm right so i'll do my start er on this one i'll put that to there my next move be to get these pawn out cos that and let freeze up my attack for my knight so i'll go like that he's block my next move that way well not to worry i'll do that
S0192	he's just mirror you
S0227	i'm then gonna do that to attack that pawn but he might take mine and i take his back bomb he do that my
S0192	and he lose a cannon then
S0227	that i lose a cannon we both trade off a cannon
S0192	oh do you lose one as well
S0227	i'm attack that he's attack that so to defend that now i go he'll take that i'll take that i've lose another pawn there but he lose a pawn there
S0192	that's quite quick
S0227	he lose that
S0192	you don't normally play chess this quickly
S0227	i lose that no right
S0192	when you normally play do you play this quickly
S0227	yeah
S0192	cos i'd say you be on the normal game of chess you be more cautious
S0227	oh er i be much more yeah i do try to think so now
S0192	i don't believe there's not a two player version of this on here surely
S0227	just defend that
S0192	be it worth lose right i like the cannon i think that's quite a cool piece
S0227	mm there
S0192	it's actually move a bite quickly for me to you know keep hold of it
S0227	yes erm erm
S0192	lose so many piece so quickly only be on for two minutes
S0227	yeah
S0192	and like the game's now you can jump over your own piece
S0227	mm mm oh i work one there and lose oh damn damn it damn
S0192	you can take his cannon but he'll take yours
S0227	no yeah but i'm i'm gonna i can't no i can't take that
S0192	why not
S0227	it's cos it's not diagonal i can only go in
S0192	oh okay
S0227	so i have to go like that and go just there
S0192	you didn't wanna lose that
S0227	be that lose no i didn't lose anything so i do that so now what i need to do be erm he would he will take he's go to take that cos that put it into check so he's gonna take that
S0192	you've lose so many piece be it not hard to check each
S0227	yeah it yeah it it can be yeah sorry i i rush i've rush this game the next game i'll play slowly
S0192	mm
S0227	so he's put me in check
S0192	computer doesn't take long to think at all no
S0227	no
S0192	oh sorry do you oh yeah of course they can cross the river yeah it's
S0227	i've lose that one
S0192	you're gonna lose this
S0227	yeah
S0192	purposefully of course just to show me
S0227	no no i just i'm just do it fast right i'm gonna lose that game so i'll now do one to win i'm go to to actually try to play to win now and i'll just go through the motion right what you're try to do be get things like in chess work together like piece a pair of scissor
S0192	yeah
S0227	and things like they be take er separate the scissor and they're just stab weapons but put them together and they cut things so
S0192	yeah do
S0227	yeah
S0192	analogy
S0227	yeah so what i do be erm i put there's like some open sequence in there call like the erm the lame this and that you know the different
S0192	oh lame
S0227	something like lame something
S0192	lame duck
S0227	yes like that sort of thing they say
S0227	erm different say
S0192	have you get a book on it then it's
S0227	yeah
S0192	do i buy you a book on it i think i do yeah
S0227	er i think you do yes
S0192	yeah
S0227	so you go to there
S0192	nice just because he cross the river
S0227	yeah but you can move now sideways or forward but you can't move backwards it's because
S0192	okay so prior to him cross the river he can only move forward
S0227	he can move one forward yeah one space
S0192	but then now he can move
S0227	now he can move one space leave or right or forward
S0192	interest be there any other piece that change
S0227	no
S0192	the abilities of yeah cross the river
S0227	just the just the pawn just the pawn er let's see how we go
S0192	the pawn look more like tent
S0227	mm
S0192	i've yurt a mongolian tent i guess it may very well be a mongolian tent see as they have a problem
S0227	mm
S0192	with mongolia didn't they for quite while
S0227	mm yes they do yes and genghis khan
S0192	yeah
S0227	or his real name temüjin
S0192	hence the great wall
S0227	mm
S0192	i've be to the great wall
S0227	yes yeah i know you have
S0192	it's quite impressive i go in the winter as well
S0227	yes he do er temüjin reap quite a lot of destruction in china
S0192	i mean he go as far as europe didn't he
S0227	yes he do
S0192	which be
S0227	yeah
S0192	quite impressive
S0227	yeah yes
S0192	and sire a few few children on the way didn't
S0227	well well they reckon er one in every two hundred men on the planet can trace their ancestry back to er genghis khan
S0192	that's insane
S0227	mm
S0192	er surely not i mean if you think about it obviously it's a lot more difficult for women but for a guy you could sire i mean how many children a day
S0227	mm once they'd
S0192	i mean two or three a day
S0227	once they he capture the chiefs' wive they become his wive
S0192	mm
S0227	they be his property and obviously he impregnate them and all that and
S0192	don't see how
S0227	we've get the and then his son or grandson kubla khan he do the same er yeah so it do
S0227	really spread the progeny around
S0192	yeah their genealogy
S0227	yeah they do
S0192	bloody hell
S0227	yeah
S0192	so when you say one in two hundred though that statistic surely must be a much higher in certain areas in i mean surely like one in
S0227	no i think they've average that out as over the world
S0192	yeah not one in two hundred people in england or
S0227	no no no er in the world
S0192	yeah in the world
S0227	in the world yeah
S0192	so that's quite a few of them be chinese or
S0227	yes exactly
S0192	or or whatever er
S0227	right er i'm try to get him he's he's protect that and that's what i what i'm after
S0192	mm
S0227	so go try and do something to get him out of the way he may fulfil it and take it if he do he's lose oh no he hasn't dammit cos i forget his thing there it's still not a problem yes it be damn it i shouldn't have do that that be a mistake on my behalf
S0192	why be that a mistake
S0227	i've i've because i forget about that that that be there that
S0192	mm
S0227	defend that once it come down there i need that out of the way as well right okay let's see erm
S0192	be there any significance to these other mark on the board
S0227	no not as far as i know now we can put that to directly attack that i'm take that he's block it
S0192	but you can take his cannon now
S0227	i be and i want that that's what i actually want i would quite happily
S0192	or he will take your cannon
S0227	now it that's out of the that if he doesn't move that that's good for me so now what i do be i throw that trap again erm but i can't because that's block me in so what i do be i do that
S0192	or take that you can now move sideways though can't you
S0227	er
S0192	so if you move your knight there
S0227	well it be yeah now what i want to do be move no what do i do that for that be a stupid move i mean to do that
S0192	unless you can take it back
S0227	if he take that that's where i've get him
S0192	be that it
S0227	yes
S0192	i mean that go pretty quick
S0227	yeah right so you have a go
S0192	okay let's have a look
S0227	as i say if you make a mistake
S0227	not a problem
S0192	let me have a look as i'm sure you can play two player in this i'm sure of it you go to new game it say human versus computer
S0227	yeah
S0192	so surely you can do human versus human in some way
S0227	well it would have that in the menu
S0192	human versus human
S0227	oh you can
S0192	yeah
S0227	oh i've never i've never bother to do that er
S0192	would you like to try
S0227	yeah go on then
S0192	so er i'll go first and dad
S0227	there you go i've never bother to try it because obviously 's never be take any interest to learn it
S0192	no so you move first what now what do you play
S0227	play yeah
S0192	so there you go so if we sit it
S0227	okay well do i didn't
S0192	on on the bed
S0227	i didn't realise that because like i say what's the point i don't 's not interest to learn so
S0192	no no
S0227	so why would i play against myself
S0192	i think they must do there's gotta be a way of
S0227	yeah yeah but er
S0192	play two play if we both sit on the bed be that the best way of do it
S0227	er so can you well we're both at a hold it no i need to be one way you need to be the i need to be
S0192	if you could sit there and i sit here then it
S0227	and it's the which er colour's the one that go first er it look like
S0192	i'm red
S0227	you're gonna go first by the look of it
S0192	yeah yeah be that alright
S0227	yeah you're gonna go first that's okay yeah
S0192	right so what kind of move do you say be good i the begin i've forget now
S0227	erm to get your
S0192	get your knight out of the corner
S0227	it say er er erm a good erm chess player will have have his rook out by by the at least the third move so you're try to
S0192	okay so you've gotta free up space for your rook
S0227	yeah
S0192	don't really know what i'm do so it's
S0227	no that's fine
S0192	it's a bite of a
S0227	that's why i think well with the the computer you could er
S0192	hit or miss
S0227	er you you go first though
S0192	yeah this be all good i'm like i prefer to play you i think if you have any advice for me while you're do it
S0227	yeah okay
S0192	it's definitely harder to see like
S0227	yeah
S0192	the strategy's completely different
S0227	yeah it be
S0192	this be nice though isn't it
S0227	yeah
S0192	i'm just gonna move for now i'm just gonna throw my weight around
S0227	feel i don't blame you
S0192	see how it go
S0227	don't blame you
S0192	cos when you be play against the computer you guy be move fast but
S0227	mm
S0192	okay so you're not attack me with anything
S0227	no
S0192	and then you take my oh
S0227	yeah you
S0192	that be a terrible move
S0227	yes
S0192	you anticipate that's why you move out
S0227	yes that's correct yeah
S0192	okay mm
S0227	you're punish for that mistake
S0192	yeah we won't take anything back we'll just erm
S0227	but you but you learn you learn from that
S0192	mm
S0227	i don't do anything without any reason
S0192	no no oh crap see if move him up here yes i'm attack you but you're attack me and it's your turn next
S0227	mm
S0192	so that that would be absolutely useless
S0227	mm
S0192	these move diagonally
S0227	yeah
S0192	can they move like across the board like that
S0227	no they no they can only get to the river they can't go ahead of it
S0192	no they can't go beyond it
S0227	no
S0192	so bring them out ah how do you get your rook out then
S0227	you just bring them out
S0192	but that be a piece in there wasn't there
S0227	yeah they can go one of yeah that be actually a good move by you because otherwise you'd have lose that check
S0192	what would i have lose
S0227	you'd have lose your rook cos you i've now put you in check you've get to either move your king forward or move that minister out the way sorry counsellor out the way
S0192	yeah
S0227	and you would have then lose your knight if that be still there i'd have take it
S0192	i'd have lose some there
S0227	yeah
S0192	which be a better move
S0227	be you well erm that's entirely up to you the at this point there's no merit in there's no advantage i can see of er er
S0192	cos i'm gonna lose one of these anyway aren't i
S0227	i would move the minister myself to protect that one okay
S0192	i'm get work i wanna start again
S0227	mm
S0192	oh don't have any idea what to do
S0227	attack
S0192	i can attack you here can i
S0227	er yes you can like when that er that's make me vulnerable you can go back to there
S0192	mm oh i lose the bloody thing right at the begin
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah you're only attack my no you're only attack this pawn aren't you with this
S0227	yeah well do i be gonna say to you you could have do that
S0192	so you're defend
S0227	yeah
S0192	now and this i'm still confuse a bite about the horse and the knight if i move him here
S0227	that will be yes
S0192	and then he'll be attack
S0227	yeah you can't i don't think you can move there but you can move it to there and that would be threaten my my
S0192	yeah dunno what's go on there
S0227	cannon
S0192	yeah should be okay on that front no no you can no you can't
S0227	no but if you take him i will take you back
S0192	oh okay
S0227	and that's that's worth
S0192	cos it's chain
S0227	more than that
S0192	so can i take that back
S0227	if you be er yeah you
S0192	no okay well we won't take anything back
S0227	well take it back if you want to
S0192	no no that's fine i be my other move be to do the knight here to attack him what be the purpose of that
S0227	mm wait and see
S0192	mm i don't like wait and see do you ever have to clean this screen
S0227	erm
S0192	with all the touch and everything
S0192	you know what i mean
S0227	yeah everybody do that
S0192	how much be they
S0227	i dunno buy it for her
S0192	they're not cheap be they
S0227	no they're not cheap no that's that's that's er for sure
S0192	and these be worth more than these
S0227	no the rook be be the the rook be the most valuable
S0192	cos they move inwards the rook be the most valuable then the cannon and the
S0227	yeah rook cannon knight er minister counsellor
S0192	so it's outside inside
S0227	the
S0192	so you're not gonna take this if you're gonna lose that
S0227	no
S0192	presumably
S0227	unless it's er the unless i can see a
S0192	a strategic
S0227	reason to do it
S0192	yes
S0227	i won't rule it out
S0192	these can't move over so there's
S0227	they can only move until they cross the river yeah then they can
S0192	not too much point in move there mm i wish i have my other cannon knight can move over
S0227	yeah knight knight and rook can they just er
S0192	they just don't move very far though do they
S0227	no
S0192	okay so now you can take my knight
S0227	no i can't
S0192	oh you can take my pawn
S0227	yeah i can't take your knight
S0192	yeah it's confuse yeah sure er nothing what would you suggest there
S0227	well move something forward you you you've get two piece in erm they're not really work with each other at the moment
S0192	no
S0227	you ought to have a try and get them to work or get something up there to help them to help them work
S0192	cos pawn can't move sideways can they so that's
S0227	no
S0192	be it difficult to find a download to this
S0227	no
S0192	just google chinese chess
S0227	you might be able to get it on your computer i do look but erm
S0192	yeah i mean i wouldn't mind play this with
S0227	to yeah
S0192	although it's a lot better format play it on this thing
S0227	yes
S0192	than try to both do it on my computer although she do have a tablet i buy her one
S0227	if she's get a tablet she'll be able to download
S0192	it's not as big as this though
S0227	no
S0192	it's a smaller one but
S0227	yeah well you might be able to work with it with with that
S0192	it's difficult to play actually
S0227	you might be able to work with that
S0192	we go through a stage of play chess with each other quite a lot
S0227	oh right
S0192	we be like travel but i haven't really it be several years ago now but there no i completely go to check but you'll just take my cannon
S0227	yeah so you you've now threaten my er my rook it's now threaten unless i move that knight
S0192	or rook this chain thing you've get go onto it
S0227	mm
S0192	mm oh i've just move into your attack while i attack of the knight
S0227	not sure if can erm yes i can i can take
S0192	take it
S0227	do you do you want to back do you want to move it
S0192	no no no
S0227	no go on take it mate cos it be it be a silly move
S0192	erm it's just try to and see over the river be a bite confuse
S0227	mm
S0192	if i move my knight here be the defend the rook
S0227	er he's defend the rook yeah
S0192	yeah it's not defend that area
S0227	er er i would've say but no he's no he's not defend it's too far away from the rook
S0192	yeah
S0227	but you you're attack that and that pawn there
S0192	oh and er cannon can't jump too
S0227	just the one
S0192	just the
S0227	either they're the enemy or themselves
S0192	don't know what to do why can't you move there
S0227	no cos you've get that's block you your other man's block you
S0192	oh
S0227	so
S0192	wow
S0227	see that's he your pawn be block you there as well you can go backwards but you can't go forward
S0192	can't go forward
S0227	yeah it tell you light up where you can go the two space that it go there or there that's it
S0192	mm now these move diagonally do they move one or two
S0227	two
S0192	two
S0227	just two
S0192	so if i move him there he's not attack you
S0227	if you move what what
S0192	the rook here
S0227	no it's not attack me no
S0192	it's not cos you'll go through him
S0227	yeah he won't be able to that's blank you and move there he won't be able to jump to that cos you're in the way
S0192	i'm in the way so block be quite serious
S0227	yeah
S0192	mm and these can only move diagonally
S0227	er yeah once well well
S0192	you'll move
S0227	well in the castle er within the
S0192	the fortress
S0227	with the in the palace the palace
S0192	so if i'm attack your knight
S0227	yeah
S0192	then he's not defend the knight
S0227	yeah that's quite correct
S0192	oh it become uncomfortable sit cross legged doesn't it i wish i didn't lose my cannon right at the begin
S0227	mm
S0192	i always make stupid mistake like that oh be this how long each of us have be play
S0227	yeah
S0192	oh so take my rook put you into check can i
S0227	yep you've get me into check
S0192	i'm so confuse about this cannon it have to jump over something
S0227	yes
S0192	so if i move him here he's not attack my rook he's attack well he can't be attack that cos it's the same piece but
S0227	yeah
S0192	he's not attack that rook
S0227	no
S0192	no but i be attack him
S0227	yeah
S0192	but he's defend by this
S0227	yeah
S0192	and this cannon can take this piece here
S0227	he could do but then i would take him with my
S0192	with your king
S0227	king cos i can i can do that or i could take him with my minister
S0192	yeah
S0227	sorry my counsellor
S0192	and so this course of action the cannon's not be attack the i mean and if i move my cannon here he be attack
S0227	no
S0192	oh he's attack that
S0227	yeah
S0192	oh it's confuse it have to jump
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	why do it have to jump over something i don't really understand that
S0227	yeah er it's fire over to get to hit someone
S0192	yeah you're attack me but it must have something to fire over you can't just
S0227	yeah
S0192	shoot with this dude
S0227	no
S0192	an interest concept mm i wanna get rid of this piece but
S0227	yeah
S0192	i don't know how to do that but i take it it's not worth these piece aren't worth very much be they
S0227	they're worth less than the cannon
S0192	but let's say if i lose if i take this lose my cannon but take another one at least it's look that way mm interest they can't move out of that box
S0227	mm
S0192	that seem very restrict you're play me a lot slower than the computer
S0227	mm
S0192	crap and i can't be my cannon attack your cannon or do it have to be i'm jump over this piece aren't i
S0227	er well do
S0192	yeah
S0227	yeah i i want to see if you would you would find that out or not
S0192	be you sure
S0227	yes yeah yeah
S0192	you didn't make a mistake
S0227	no no
S0227	i think i'd give you a
S0227	thing there
S0192	think you'd give me a chance good so we're more even be there any way of you'd think they'd be able to show you the piece that you've lose wouldn't they
S0227	mm
S0192	might be useful okay our war be on look for a rook's not really worth it mm
S0227	owe to the fact that you've either lose your knight or you've lose one of your er your minister
S0192	yeah just don't really wanna resign to that at the minute
S0227	this er
S0192	and a knight's worth more
S0227	yes
S0190	would you like a drink
S0227	erm coffee would be nice my love
S0190	
S0192	erm no i've get water thank i'm okay oh it's really annoy that he's in the way that i can't
S0227	yeah
S0192	move him there
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	why can't he move that way
S0227	you've
S0192	know what i mean
S0227	to be honest you've lose him either way cos even if you move there er he's go
S0192	but if i'd have be able to move him here
S0227	yeah
S0192	he'd be defend him
S0227	yeah
S0192	but he's not it doesn't work that way
S0227	but you can't cos you're your own man be er stop you from do it
S0192	mm it's troublesome ah i don't wanna resign to lose that yeah so he's lose anyway so there's
S0227	yeah
S0192	very little point in worry about him unless no i can't do two move at once can i
S0227	no
S0192	mm
S0227	i would move him because then cos if you don't you'll cannon become immediately threaten and i i'm force you to do things
S0192	mm you would move him
S0227	yeah i would yeah
S0192	so i draw this down rather than
S0227	yeah
S0192	draw it out that way
S0227	because otherwise if you've leave him there and i take him that's then immediately under threat
S0192	yeah okay i've get you cannon get really trap doesn't it
S0227	mm can get trap yeah
S0192	yeah you can just take this now can't you but i'm defend yeah
S0227	no you but by two piece a by your
S0192	yeah
S0227	your erm counsellor and by your king
S0192	so this shape make quite a strong hold doesn't it
S0227	yeah
S0192	it make a good defence
S0227	mm
S0192	mm what to do you've get a nice defence here i can't really
S0227	yeah
S0192	i can't really get into anything so now you're attack him
S0227	directly
S0192	bugger he can move sideways
S0227	yeah
S0192	or i jump over him but i'd be attack this not this so it doesn't make sense
S0227	yeah and you yeah you can't jump over erm cos you've gotta take something with it to jump
S0192	can he get to the end and be
S0227	yeah threaten directly your king yeah
S0192	but can he be make into a new piece like in chess
S0227	no no
S0192	no
S0227	that be what he be he can only move forward and sideways i can't move him backwards
S0192	no no no and he can't be make into a well
S0227	no
S0192	there be no queen be there so
S0227	no but he's now get skills he can take anything
S0192	yeah yeah so he's of use
S0227	yeah
S0192	and this can't jump too
S0227	no so you need to move him somewhere
S0192	how do i tease something out of this area i don't really
S0227	you're attack the wrong side my vulnerability be this side
S0192	be on this side
S0227	but you're attack that they're you're attack you're go against the wall rather than go around the wall
S0192	it just take so many move to get over there be the problem
S0227	yeah
S0192	and i've and you keep chase me so i've gotta
S0227	mm
S0192	move this or i
S0227	you're you're you're on the on the back foot
S0192	yeah
S0227	i'm keep you on the back foot
S0192	mm no either he's attack him isn't he
S0227	yeah take it back you can put him erm just over the river
S0192	mm
S0227	mm
S0192	what be your plan oh you've get a nice defence here i can't get over this side
S0227	mm
S0192	i don't really understand how to do that
S0190	will you come and get it
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	i'm not a cheater where we be be i'm lose and struggle to see where to move any advice
S0227	er no not really just
S0192	i can't move him here cos he's attack him here
S0227	mm
S0192	move there would be pointless cos he's block in again
S0227	yeah
S0192	i can't move him out because he's gonna attack him
S0227	well you could move him right back you can see all the line of where you can go you can either move one that space or all the way down that line
S0192	mm true okay i don't know didn't free up much there do it i could dance around this all day
S0227	er you'll find that no be the answer to that
S0192	cos you'll jump over me and attack my piece
S0227	mm mm
S0192	yeah mm it's get him over that side i'm gonna do some attack
S0227	mm
S0192	what be the time
S0227	twenty past eleven just go
S0192	okay we should probably have lunch around about midday shouldn't we really
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	if we're go to mum be pick me up around about one what be you have for lunch
S0227	pass don't know
S0192	do sort that out
S0227	will know yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	yeah yeah i'd rather 'll have a fair idea
S0192	do she know that i've gotta go at one
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah cool
S0227	right you've do that okay get me into check
S0192	yeah but not for long could just move him back couldn't you
S0227	or i can just take you with that
S0192	oh bugger
S0227	so take it back
S0192	oh
S0227	see that's a good defence i've get there
S0192	yeah it's a really good defence i can't get into that at all
S0227	this thing be forget the capabilities of what the piece can do
S0192	mm
S0227	no so you're move straight there and forget that that could come back and take you
S0192	yeah this be defend this right they've move
S0227	yeah
S0192	like two across
S0227	yeah
S0192	right that be definitely a bite confuse try to play old chess on
S0227	yeah
S0192	new chess be there any other variations of chess that you've come across
S0227	not to my knowledge no
S0192	no just chinese chess and western chess yes okay i have two cannon we get rid of one of your cannon didn't we so
S0227	yeah
S0192	that be a positive mm okay i can take him but then you'll take me
S0227	correct
S0192	and er you're you can't move diagonally so you're only
S0227	no
S0192	threaten this bishop thing
S0227	i i'm no your your erm er er your minister yeah
S0192	oh what oh crap
S0227	you didn't i be move that
S0192	no oh it's confuse
S0227	you can see now i'm attack both of your counsellors
S0192	yeah okay and there's no way of oh bugger i wouldn't have move him out i think
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	i be like oh yeah i've
S0227	yeah well you've save him
S0192	take this bite yeah
S0227	you've save him be he's worth more than those but you're resign to that fact of lose those
S0192	and then my but my king can take
S0227	yes he can
S0192	you so he's only gonna lose one of them
S0227	but er so the for me it's a it's a good i'd like i'd trade a pawn for a higher piece any day
S0192	oh yeah yeah definitely definitely
S0227	unless it it be strategically erm erm relevant for me not to do that
S0192	mm and he can't move over this bloody river
S0227	no
S0192	so he's next to useless it's very limit where that guy can go isn't he can just move in this quadrant
S0227	which one
S0192	this guy
S0227	yes yes
S0192	all he can do be go there there there or there
S0227	yeah
S0192	really i mean i mean he's
S0227	exactly he's more of a
S0192	in this quadrant yeah
S0227	he's a defensive peer pay player
S0192	mm
S0227	rather than a attack
S0192	so i should have move him out erm right just to clarify before i move if i move my knight here it's defend that right
S0227	erm too far away
S0192	oh it's not go yeah
S0227	no
S0192	i'm see it wrong it's defend my king though that that's purpose
S0227	well well yeah
S0192	once the king's be take that's game over
S0227	mm
S0192	yeah this be a really strong defence i don't know how to break this you're close in force you to do something temporary mm oh oh crap it's be pause the whole bloody time
S0227	oh right
S0192	us not talk be this nearly game over i don't really know what to do with this for now defend them i guess it's nice this quadrant i can't get over it i don't really know what to do now i'm just run around
S0227	check
S0192	you're just home in this be a slow and painful death
S0227	check
S0192	i can take that but you'll take me
S0227	no you can't cos i've put you in check
S0192	oh bugger
S0227	in there
S0192	take my piece it's game over isn't it i can't really do anything now can you pin me down though be we just gonna keep go round in circle we're play another game now
S0227	new game yeah
S0192	cos i'm the loser
S0227	spin it round this time i'll play it so it's just as it be i'm i'm you and
S0192	yeah yeah that's it's good i'm i'm dad be i
S0227	yeah
S0192	the daddy
S0227	look at my shoe
S0192	yeah
S0227	how much do it cost for your train fare to get up here when you do you get a student like card or something or
S0192	it's forty pound return
S0227	oh right
S0192	it's not cheap be it
S0227	no it's not okay
S0192	erm but there's i can get home cheaper so basically i get the reason i be happy to come home when i go back last time
S0227	yeah
S0192	it cost me it be thirty five pound one way
S0227	mm
S0192	or forty pound return
S0227	yeah
S0192	with the one month return
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i be er well rather than just pay the thirty five it's your birthday
S0227	yeah
S0192	if i pay five pound more then i can
S0227	yeah
S0192	come back so i pay forty and then there's another special ticket that only run after it's not really useful cos it's a day return
S0227	right yeah
S0192	and i don't return in the day
S0227	no no no
S0192	but that's only twenty pound but you can't buy it from the train station it have to be buy from the tourist office
S0227	oh right okay
S0192	so mum's buy me a twenty pound day return so it's gonna cost me twenty quid to get home
S0227	okay
S0192	if you know what i mean
S0227	oh that's nice
S0192	so it's cheaper so but i won't then have a return ticket to get back

S0227	it's a bite of a
S0192	okay so what mistake do i make at the begin
S0227	you didn't really
S0192	who be that on the phone
S0227	er it's mum
S0227	right here we go right let's do this
S0192	didn't mention what's for dinner
S0227	no i no cos i the phone but i'll
S0192	i'm fuck hungry now
S0227	yeah well focus your mind to task after this game
S0192	leave something on the board there
S0227	yeah
S0192	bite of crap
S0227	it's get a screen over it there's like a film over this to protect it
S0192	oh you can see it yeah it's a protector
S0227	yes a protector film
S0192	necessary a lot of people crack their screen don't they i've see people like drop it and
S0227	yeah
S0192	so what would you say come out first you you wanna get your rook out in three move or something
S0227	your yeah your rook you wanna get your knight you don't wanna be waste time with this pawn or the central pawn
S0192	just these two
S0227	yeah
S0192	because that free up space for
S0227	yeah
S0192	what to come out so you be attack this piece
S0227	correct
S0192	yeah i find these cannon a bite confuse
S0227	mm
S0192	a bite difficult
S0227	yeah
S0192	to see what the hell's go on really
S0227	yeah it's master the
S0192	and if i mirror you i'm attack that bite
S0227	yeah
S0192	so what's the purpose of move these forward what's that clear that space out
S0227	they would stop the knight come out cos you know when i say that knight's be block by
S0192	yeah
S0227	it block the knight
S0192	okay do that then so you just go straight off and just take my piece thank you very much right i should have just mirror you i'm just gonna get screw again
S0227	yeah
S0190	what do you say i didn't hear you
S0227	i be just continue the joke that you want to reserve that for sunbathe
S0190	oh
S0227	i be say do you want me to move the sun lounger
S0192	i'm still a bite confuse by the knight as well if i move there i'm not attack that be i
S0227	yes you be
S0192	i be
S0227	yeah
S0192	i think it only go
S0227	no you're no no
S0192	to there
S0227	you're attack it yeah you're attack it
S0192	so then surely if i'm attack that from there then here there should be a yellow dot here why be there no yellow dot
S0227	no
S0192	oh cos he's in the way
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	okay
S0227	so now i need to do something about that
S0192	you can just take my other pawn aren't you
S0227	well no because if i do that you'd take me with that
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	er
S0192	oh because think you be take that pawn
S0227	yeah so i i drop him back to that line
S0192	okay so there's some use from that why do it still say that i can't move a yellow dot there then if i be attack you
S0227	er well you should have be able to maybe i'm wrong
S0192	i'm a bite confuse about the knight
S0227	oh ah i've yeah er yeah the i'm not a hundred percent on them
S0192	yeah
S0227	but erm
S0192	it seem like they what er it seem like they go one across two up
S0227	yeah
S0192	not two across one up
S0227	yeah yeah that's it yeah that's my mistake yeah it it it that's exactly
S0192	because er in chess
S0227	yeah
S0192	they can go either can't they
S0227	yeah i needn't have move that
S0192	no
S0227	i be but i felt threaten by it so i i think it be that yeah
S0192	do you wanna take it back
S0227	no it's i'm quite happy i've i have my plan
S0192	i'm sure you do okay don't wanna lose a cannon in the first couple of round again that would suck oh bugger
S0227	yeah
S0192	take it back
S0227	alright take it back
S0192	how do you do it i understand
S0227	yes
S0192	yeah i just put myself in
S0227	just right in the fire line
S0192	vulnerability yeah
S0227	yeah straight in the fire line
S0192	which i didn't wanna do but i can take this pawn
S0227	but you'd then
S0192	with him but the knight be block it yeah
S0227	mm that's just defend it
S0192	so i don't wanna do that be there any purpose to that or so mm mm nothing can get this be can oh get confuse that be the block that and that
S0227	yeah it's defend
S0192	isn't it defend that and that
S0227	it's defend that that cannon at the moment so be that one
S0192	okay but nothing's defend your knight
S0227	no check
S0192	what oh my god that's ridiculous oh that be all a big quick wasn't it
S0227	mm
S0192	and if i move this oh no cos you're defend this bloody thing
S0227	mm
S0192	so i can move
S0227	you can move a minister that you've lose your
S0192	my rook
S0227	yeah
S0192	what
S0227	like i say it's just it's a game of tactics
S0192	oh jesus and i have none
S0227	tactics
S0192	that's the problem i don't wanna be lose a rook get a rook out in three move not lose a rook in three move
S0227	mm
S0192	i think that's the
S0227	mm
S0192	oh god it's just game over isn't it already and he's not
S0227	well
S0192	able to move there
S0227	no i've still lose my knight though if you want the knight
S0192	yeah
S0227	i can't do anything about that
S0192	no still i'm lose on point okay so
S0227	you realise your rook be your your your cannon be directly under attack
S0192	yeah i know there's only one place i can move him isn't there
S0227	yeah
S0192	although no that's not my pawn sorry i be see this red pawn as be my pawn erm there's the only place i can move him be there
S0227	yeah which mean i then attack it here and you've say goodbye to that
S0192	oh no that doesn't make me happy i didn't wanna lose my cannon that quickly there's nothing i can do
S0227	no there's nowhere you can move it you can't even take anything with it to just and then lose it that way
S0192	so the
S0227	it's go
S0192	well actually be it go i mean if aren't i put you in check
S0227	if you do that you've put me in er check
S0192	so you have to move out of check before i lose my cannon
S0227	yeah and the way i'd do that be to go there
S0192	okay
S0227	which you your cannon be still under attack
S0192	erm okay if i move my cannon here then you're in check again but you'll just move
S0227	i'll take you out with one of the minister
S0192	yeah with one of the the
S0227	the counsellors
S0192	erm i need to mm this cannon add a whole different element to the game doesn't it
S0227	mm
S0192	he's not attack him no
S0227	no
S0192	rook these pawn block your
S0227	mm
S0192	rook i don't know how to get him out okay what would you do
S0227	i you've lose a an er give up what you can't defend and see if you can attack with something else you've lose you've lose one you've lose that there's nowhere it can go to protect it
S0192	you can't if you if i move him here and you attack with one of the minister that put you in check mate doesn't it
S0227	sorry
S0192	if i move here and then you attack it with one of the minister then i attack your king
S0227	well try it
S0192	don't you you can attack it with the king but not with the
S0227	i could i could erm take it out with one of those i believe let's see if i'm if i'm mistake no
S0192	you can't because
S0227	no no
S0192	i'm attack your
S0227	i can take it straight with that
S0192	with the king yeah
S0227	yeah so you don't wanna move there
S0192	no okay it's good it put the little yellow dot you can
S0227	yeah see see where you're
S0192	really see where you're yeah where you're go
S0227	where you can go
S0192	so all be lose on that front i don't really know what to do i need to get some of these other piece out if that's lose anyway
S0227	mm
S0192	then i guess i need to do something he can't go anywhere else er what would you do
S0227	well the resign to the fact that that's go
S0192	okay so what would you do with the other piece
S0227	move something else
S0192	which which one
S0227	well you wanna get your rook out if you can but
S0192	yeah i mean it's not come out very easily though be he
S0227	no well there's it's move isn't it
S0192	it's like three move
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	before i can actually get the damn thing out
S0227	yeah exactly
S0192	bugger if i move here you'll take him with this
S0227	yeah
S0192	which
S0227	i would leave him where he be he's in a very strong position there
S0192	he's in a good position
S0227	i can't like do that
S0192	no
S0227	i can't do that
S0192	so leave him where he be it's your go water oh okay when it come to er well actually dad i think when you say about pay for me to come home for christmas my think i'm not gonna have very much money come christmas
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i probably wasn't gonna buy people much other than a token gift
S0227	no don't yes don't worry about get me nothing if you're
S0192	and part of my thing be come home
S0227	yeah no no no yeah don't worry about get me er something because er you've already pay that meal that would've be very expensive so that's my christmas and my birthday
S0192	no i mean i mean i'll get everyone a token something but it's not gonna be like
S0227	no just get me a dvd or something
S0192	yeah
S0227	something a dvd be fine i don't want any more than that
S0192	do that yeah but i'm gonna be quite poor
S0227	yes i know
S0192	i think by the time
S0227	well yeah
S0192	i think we will
S0227	like i say erm i mean i don't know when you get pay for this thingy of yours
S0192	i haven't be pay yet i should get pay for twenty twenty hours at the end of this month and then twenty five hours at the end of the next month
S0227	mm
S0192	this record now i won't get pay this until the end of november
S0227	no
S0192	okay
S0227	yeah no a token gesture for be be fine
S0192	except i be a bite worry about christmas i mean if i move him here he be defend and attack he's attack this and defend this right
S0227	yeah but what but he's not be defend by anything so
S0192	by anything because he'll be
S0227	he'll be take by that
S0192	he just can't move sideways
S0227	no he'd just
S0192	yeah
S0227	he'd be take
S0192	so erm what to do so you don't think move him out it's not worth take any pawn he's er he's a good
S0227	yeah keep er no i'd keep him on that line
S0192	he's a good fella to have that's what i'll go for what do i do what be the purpose of that i know you have a plan but i'm just erm so i should if i take that you can take that be that correct if i take your knight if i take your cannon with my knight then your cannon can take my bishop
S0227	yeah
S0192	okay but a cannon be worth more than a bishop
S0227	yeah strategically yeah
S0192	but if maybe not actually i mean i might as well do that why do you move that in then
S0227	mm
S0192	do you not see that or be there some ulterior motive go on
S0227	mm there'll always be an ulterior motive
S0192	half the game be convince me there be isn't it mm i'm gonna go for that then what
S0192	wanna take it back
S0192	what let's take it back it's not fair
S0192	okay so you're lure me in so that happen because
S0227	er you be
S0192	why do that attack my king i don't understand i take that
S0227	yeah but then i have two attack that plus that attack that it i
S0192	you can't jump two though can you
S0227	he be in check no he be in check once you take that i take that you couldn't move that out the way you couldn't move that that way cos he's in check
S0192	no let's see this again so i take this
S0227	yeah
S0192	you take what
S0227	i go like that
S0192	that
S0227	he can't move out of check he can't move that out the way it move diagonally he can't move that one line cos he's still in check he hasn't get himself out of check
S0192	bugger i didn't see that
S0227	okay
S0192	do you mind me take it back
S0227	no
S0192	okay i'll just go for this then you've still what
S0192	but be there no way out of that
S0227	no
S0192	oh
S0227	you be out er class
S0192	oh bloody hell that be a good game
S0227	see against the machine i'm not very good because the machine doesn't make mistake
S0192	no yeah
S0227	you'll make mistake and what happen be i make less mistake
S0192	i'll try and download
S0227	so yeah
S0192	i mean i'll save that i haven't really get much time for play chess at the minute but
S0227	no no you
S0227	to be honest it it's something to to to have another pop when you come over at christmas
S0192	yeah we'll have another go
S0227	but forget about it yeah you've get you're do too many things you don't want to stretch yourself too thin
S0192	definitely not
S0227	erm it erm yes
S0192	that be good though i like it
S0227	erm
S0192	it's a completely different dynamic
S0227	it
S0192	on the chess game isn't it
S0227	but you can see it's a strategy game someone who's good at that would make wipe the floor with me
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	but i can wipe the floor with you because erm
S0192	i've never play it
S0227	like i say when i play against the computer even at normal the computer be not make mistake
S0192	no yeah
S0227	i'm make mistake as soon as i make mistake it doesn't erm when i play against you or someone else who's not very experience or less experience than me erm you're make mistake i'm capitalise on those mistake or i
S0192	capitalise well on those mistake
S0227	i've get my own plan as well

S0227	yeah
S0192	i have it today but there's already quite a bite of sugar in a weetabix
S0227	already yeah yeah
S0192	i would say personally avoid cereal altogether and i have and i would wholly recommend plain yoghurt i buy greek yoghurt and then i put blueberries and strawberry berry be the least sugary fruit so i put some berry in it and you could even put in honey honey's good for you and like sweeten it but it's not actually sugar like other things
S0227	yeah
S0192	or you could blend it and make a smoothie but that's pretty much what and i have every day for breakfast
S0227	yeah
S0192	be er greek yoghurt natural yoghurt and er
S0227	yeah what time do you have to get up to go to er
S0192	how do i turn this off

S0192	no on tuesday and wednesday i'm in at nine
S0227	right
S0192	and then on friday i'm in at twelve
S0227	right so your uni's four days a week
S0192	yeah for me it's three days a week for
S0227	oh she she get an extra day
S0192	yeah
S0227	how come hers be a day less
S0192	she's do one less module than i be
S0227	oh i see
S0192	erm
S0227	so i suppose if if like the clean of the place be more of emphasis on her do that see as she's get an extra day off or
S0192	yeah
S0227	an extra fifty two days a a a year off
S0192	yeah i do my bite i mean i do my fair share
S0227	yeah you do your share but you think well er she be off an extra day okay she could be do her study but er
S0192	i could have do and i be tempt to but you know i think you know what i'm here to do a degree so i didn't i didn't choose it be very tempt to do the easier option if i'd have just do the core modules
S0227	yeah
S0192	i could have just do two days a week i could have just do monday tuesday
S0227	yeah
S0192	and do three modules instead of four but they be time so that two of them be on the same day
S0227	right
S0192	and i be very tempt cos that would've be a lovely schedule and i think you know what i'm here to do a degree i should do what i wanna do not just do an easier schedule i'm here to work
S0227	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean
S0227	yeah
S0192	so now i'm do four days rather than two
S0227	yeah will this make you more qualify than
S0192	well it make me sorry
S0227	yeah
S0192	er no no no it would just we're just do different modules that's all
S0227	right
S0192	as i say she's do three graduate modules i'm do two graduate modules and two undergraduate modules
S0227	right
S0192	so i've just split one of my graduate into two third year undergraduate modules but no it's the same credit we still come out with the same
S0227	right
S0192	the same degree do you actually know the name of the the master i'm do
S0227	sorry
S0192	do you know the name of the course i'm do
S0227	no
S0192	er apply linguistics
S0227	yeah i think you have say so yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	that
S0192	apply linguistics so i'll come out with an ma it's kind of nice and what and i have say every time you get a new qualification to a certain degree it doesn't really matter what you do before when i get my degree didn't matter that i do shit in my a level after that because i get a degree now so it doesn't really matter
S0227	yeah it it nullify it
S0192	and once i get a master from it doesn't matter that i go to a not great university to do my undergraduate i've get a master from
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	each one kind of be a bite of a step up
S0227	what's the plan you go back to mum's be you see or something
S0192	tomorrow yeah
S0227	might be see him tomorrow
S0192	yeah i think erm auntie be come over this afternoon too
S0227	oh right yeah
S0192	it's really busy for me come home actually
S0227	yeah you be there's a lot of erm family reunion and kind of er
S0192	yeah yeah it's not gonna be that chill it's unacceptable though how much university cost nowadays i think
S0227	i suppose they have to transfer it over from the from the er from the state pick up the tabs there be too many bill erm too much debt to erm throw the onus onto the individual
S0192	oh but do do university really cost that much you know what i mean
S0227	well i
S0192	nine thousand pound per person per per year
S0227	i don't honestly know to be fair
S0192	no there's no way it do
S0227	obviously they decide
S0192	how much be those lecturers be pay
S0227	i don't know
S0192	lecturers be on about forty thousand pound a year one lecturer see how many students
S0227	dunno
S0192	probably the average lecturer will probably teach between nine and twelve class a week they will probably have contact with a hundred to a hundred and fifty students each pay nine thousand pound a year and the lecturer's only get forty grand for that well it doesn't add up it doesn't
S0227	no no
S0192	make any sense
S0227	sound like a lot but cos it's never affect me so i've never bother to look into it
S0192	and how be it that the entirety of europe can pretty much do uni for free or at least very very cheap
S0227	mm
S0192	i mean it doesn't really make any sense basically all it be be just greed we're just follow the american model
S0227	well they don't thing be that they don't they don't think of the erm the rest of europe have a welfare system like ours
S0192	no
S0227	which erm erm exceedingly erm irksome
S0192	mm but we do spend quite a large chunk of our tax on war quite a large chunk the majority of the money go on war
S0227	well i know that it cost er one point seven million pound to deport abu qatada and he's be clear in jordan er
S0192	how can it cost that much to deport someone how do that make any sense
S0227	the legal process he
S0192	right so somebody's be pay a bite too much there
S0227	he resist er and that's why yeah in in the end it cost them that's not include what he be erm claim on benefit and stuff like that that's just the legal fee of his deportation of actually come over a number of years so there be probably about four or five secretaries theresa may be the successful one and try to get him deport and he be like go through the all the different court and that and get it appeal and blah blah blah you know the jordon court have find him innocent because the er a lot of the confessions be under torture and in a civilise society er you can't bring or use evidence obtain by torture as be erm it's probably be correct but
S0192	i mean in a civilise society you shouldn't torture at all should you
S0227	it be probably correct but to be honest you could get anyone to confess anything
S0192	yeah
S0227	if you're pull their nail out so er with the absence of that evidence the court er say there wasn't a strong enough case to and he be he be clear but he can't come back here or else it would be an interest case if if he suddenly turn up what be they go to do and it it cost one point seven million to just er deal with one individual
S0192	i mean we say it cost one point seven million but all that be be just a bunch of lawyers charge too much money isn't it really i mean
S0227	it's yeah but it's
S0192	how
S0227	well it's it's the process
S0192	how much in resources do it cost
S0227	erm i don't know about resources all i know be the figure that they say the one point seven million that's a lot of money for one individual where erm when i be watch who do you think you be there's some black chap his his erm he it amaze me how by flukes er er er er happenstance erm you actually come to be here his erm it be in the paper it he's his he's estrange from his father i don't this the guy be on who do you think you be he's either an actor or something or a singer or something i hadn't see him before but yeah they do these celebrities and they do their family tree and er he'd be estrange from the father he see him every now and again but not often he'd leave his the father have leave his mother when he be quite young
S0192	yeah
S0227	but you know see his dad his mother be a musician and his dad be from ghana in africa well er they be try to deport him in eighty two and he be he be contest that under if you've get an english ancestor and you can prove this then you don't get deport
S0192	mm
S0227	well his his grandfather the celebrity's great grandfather be english and his name be yates
S0192	yeah
S0227	but the the the funeral erm decide that the marriage that erm be have take place between erm the his his father's parent sorry grandparents wasn't official so therefore they didn't recognise it fortunately cos his mother have get british she be from africa she'd get british citizenship he be allow to stay but it's amaze how then the rule change because it he be his his this guy be gonna be deport his grandfather be english
S0192	yeah
S0227	but you have the like say abu qatada we've never have any link with er ghana be part of the commonwealth
S0192	mm
S0227	jordon's never be part of the commonwealth
S0192	no
S0227	but they be allow to come over here you know just a few years later er so that be a a you know how they the the rule suddenly change but back to this guy and you know how you're lucky to be here his it turn out that his great grandfather be already marry to an english woman and they have a couple of kid he be in the gold industry so the first he take them then his wife and that out in south africa and then he go alone to the to to ghana which be know as the kind of like the white man's grave so the wive never use to go there he then fell in with a native girl and have a child he leave the country due to illness i think while she be pregnant come back and then they obviously split up but he leave his son well provide for but you think to yourself if his great grandfather have not go to you know out into the world
S0192	mm
S0227	to find work er this be what he do gold mine he would never exist because he wouldn't have meet his great grandmother out in africa
S0192	no
S0227	and have but ironically this guy he have english ancestry from two both side of his family er on his father's side his mother's his erm his great great father be also english
S0192	so he's get quite a few tie
S0227	yeah but it it it
S0227	it's such a i mean it's like oliver cromwell er there be a vote go ahead and he he's you know this be well before the the civil war he's a member of parliament and he say if if i don't if the er vote go against us i'm go to the new world he have marry at the time the vote he they win the vote by one one vote and he stay he marry his wife he have already meet and have children instead of go to to the us
S0192	yeah
S0227	if he'd have do that david and his father their father would would not exist because he would have meet another woman in er in america
S0192	it's weird to think that isn't it
S0227	yes but and so you'll hear the other flukes that you'll hear like i say if i if i hadn't accept your mum's refusal to take no as an answer you would not exist
S0192	not in the same shape
S0227	no not at all not in any way shape or form if you think about it you're not you're not your brother and that's a person directly relate to you
S0192	yeah no you're right
S0227	not in any way shape or form would you be what you be
S0192	no you're right
S0227	you would you would er
S0192	doesn't bear think about it do it
S0227	no you would have you would still have erm twenty three set of your mother's dna and erm twenty and her mitochondria but you for you it would be someone totally different to you you wouldn't even recognise er them as be er or you could look at and say that's how close i would be to me
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	which be not er close at all
S0192	no true as i say it doesn't bear think about it
S0227	no
S0192	there be so many
S0227	so this
S0192	small things that would change the course of history
S0227	yeah so many things have to take place in in history for you or i to be here
S0192	or anyone
S0227	yeah so i say if i have just erm er not if your mother hadn't be as persistent as she be er you would not exist
S0192	no
S0227	and then there's another half of you which would be from me that wouldn't be you you'd have my twenty three set of my chromosomes but you wouldn't have my mitochondria er er and that wouldn't be your mother so it's it just wouldn't be you
S0192	that's a bite strange
S0227	so you kind of thank your lucky star
S0192	i mean you can say a bunch of things though couldn't you if the moon wasn't exactly that far away from the earth then we wouldn't have
S0227	i know it yes exactly yeah
S0227	yes so many things like i say you're if you're if if our great great great ten time ten grandfather be reject by our great great time ten grandmother all those generations that that follow would not exist
S0192	no it's all very tentative and precarious
S0227	yes it be if civilisation as a destroy itself in the next five hundred years there would be there would be that five hundred years there'd be about one or two thousand people walk around that be directly relate to your mother and myself and they won't know each other
S0192	mm
S0227	but they would be relate it's like with
S0192	that's a bite weird
S0227	oliver cromwell
S0192	i mean we're all relate anyway aren't we
S0227	thirteenth cromwell thirteenth generation which mean that you've get about one two one two thousandths of the of the dna which mean there's load of people out there walk around that be relate to cromwell as well but that
S0192	do you think we're relate in any way and shape to somebody famous
S0227	i've no idea without do the family tree i want to get around to it at some time
S0192	yeah do do that
S0227	it'll be it'll be a project to do
S0192	yeah i'd be interest to know
S0227	yeah it will be a project to do there's a possibility your mum's side come from erm possibly spanish from my side possibly jewish
S0192	yeah and irish though
S0227	and irish and irish irish and jewish
S0192	quite a few s go over to america didn't they
S0227	yeah irish and jewish for
S0192	and it be originally or or something like
S0227	yeah it'll be interest to find
S0192	i be interest to know but at the same time i feel a kinship with all humans so i kind of purpose personally feel like we're all relate so
S0227	you be er the chinese try to make out that erm they weren't descend from homo homo sapiens they have different they er it be a different species of homo erectus that they be from unfortunately what they what shoot that down in flame be that they take two hundred random dna sample across china
S0192	and say no you're relate to it
S0227	because there's a a defective gene from about seventy thousand years ago from a a woman which we all have erm and from africa and every single one of those two hundred chinese have that
S0192	yeah
S0227	which mean that there be no other strain they come from
S0192	and their descendants be from the same
S0227	they come from that mother be well that mother be the mother to all of us
S0192	yeah
S0227	it be a defective gene
S0192	it's crazy
S0227	blue eye come from anyone who's get blue eye be relate
S0192	what do sapien mean homo sapien
S0227	don't know
S0192	cos i know er quite a few time i've read in linguistics book they're they be they argue that erm our language be one of our most define feature of what make us human what separate us from all other creatures on this planet be our ability to communicate and what have well not communication and and language as separate
S0227	er yeah animals can communicate
S0192	yeah but they don't have language
S0227	they don't have the the
S0192	so they they want to call our species homo loquens would be the speak man which would be the
S0227	oh right
S0192	the talk human
S0227	yeah
S0192	because i mean really it do separate us from everything doesn't it it it be kind of what define us
S0227	yeah
S0192	what define us more than that
S0227	yeah there be different species of human live at the same time
S0192	yeah
S0227	the homo sapien be also live with about three or four other different species of homo whatever
S0192	yeah i mean they've look at erm the skull structure of you know neanderthal neanderthal man and
S0227	yeah
S0192	believe that they couldn't have speak like we do simply because of the shape of their voice box
S0227	yeah
S0192	and the shape of everything we've develop an elongate larynx and pharynx which have allow us to produce the sound that we do
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm er they try for age to teach well not for age but they try for a little while to teach monkey to speak and they realise well actually they can't they literally cannot make the consonants and vowels that we make
S0227	no cos they haven't get the
S0192	it's not possible with the voice box
S0227	they've get the wrong voice box
S0192	therefore they start to try to teach them sign language
S0227	there be cross i always suspect that there would have be but there be cross breed with us and neanderthals
S0192	yeah i mean there have to be
S0227	because it i can see that because erm okay they're not they're not stunners er but i don't think people be that into aesthetics at the time if you kill the neanderthal men they be stronger than us and they have tool they have their er
S0192	you'd take their women wouldn't you
S0227	you'd take their women you wouldn't just kill them they be for use you can rape you can or you can mate with them or or get them to do chores
S0192	so it's possible to interbreed then there we would've produce young
S0227	the well we have we have they reckon about two percent of our dna be neanderthal some be more some be up to about three it's between one and three percent some have get more neanderthal in them
S0192	be there any connection between intelligence and how much neanderthal gene you have
S0227	no but neanderthals weren't that stupid they have tool er they erm add erm yeah they be just they be just as as er they be stronger than us and they be they be here in europe before us they be er our colour where the people that the homo sapiens that they encounter be black they come out of africa
S0192	so be the define feature then our ability to talk
S0227	er it be basically erm erm pass things on and learn things
S0192	language
S0227	yeah
S0192	you need language
S0227	they yeah no they do have a language but not as sophisticate as they didn't
S0192	that's what i'm say because their reduce to consonants it's
S0227	they didn't pass things on
S0192	yeah
S0227	they keep very much to themselves in in troop they didn't like oh i've develop something and i go out and i show someone else it's somewhere else they didn't do that
S0192	no
S0227	hence technologically they start to fall behind strong they be stronger than us hello hello
