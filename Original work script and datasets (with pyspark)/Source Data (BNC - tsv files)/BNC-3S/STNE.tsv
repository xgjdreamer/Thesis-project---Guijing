S0530	what have you do today just sleep
S0529	erm
S0530	and read and stuff
S0529	no i just sort of i dunno be like try not to fall asleep all day
S0530	oh really
S0529	cos i'm really tire yeah i just feel like really lousy
S0529	it's like it's like i've like have a a shoot of something and it's make me like feel drowsy
S0530	mm
S0529	like when you sometimes take i dunno antihistamines i get really sleepy but i haven't take anything i just feel really sleepy
S0530	i go to sleep last night the pain keep me up till seven be
S0529	oh my god
S0530	yeah
S0529	shit
S0530	even with painkillers yeah
S0529	that's horrible
S0530	but then i get up i go to sleep and and then wake up at twelve and then yeah it be it be pretty horrible
S0529	be it painful now be it
S0530	it's less painful like
S0529	be you still take like ibuprofen and
S0530	uhu
S0529	you be
S0530	yep
S0529	good yeah just take them regularly so there's no space for it to hurt again really
S0530	like the swelling's definitely go down i think
S0529	yeah no it it look better today
S0530	i can i think i can move it more than i could yesterday like yesterday it be just like freeze
S0529	yeah i don't know whether you're suppose to keep it in the splint
S0530	yeah i think so but it doesn't actually make me feel good when i'm not in the splint
S0529	no
S0530	cos keep it still just keep it in pain i don't know why
S0529	mm
S0530	look if i move it gently maybe it's not like i'm begin to think it's not break now
S0529	yeah
S0530	kind of thing like not even that i think it'll be okay
S0529	just
S0530	mm
S0529	mm
S0530	cos i can't tell which way i go down if i go down on my the back of my arm
S0529	which bite
S0530	when i fell
S0529	do you actually land on then like show it
S0530	i i i'm i'll re enact it i can't remember
S0529	please do
S0530	it be so i'm imagine right a bite like bam
S0529	right and then you land like that do you
S0530	i imagine so because
S0529	like that
S0530	that would explain why it feel twist round
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos if that have fall down like that
S0529	and it be like fast like you're and that's what you have all your weight on
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's my
S0530	elbow kind of go down weirdly
S0529	mm
S0530	but i think
S0529	you might have just like badly sprain it
S0530	yeah
S0529	and it'll just and it'll just take a while to like
S0530	mm
S0529	feel better
S0530	it might go purple
S0529	it might go green
S0529	it might go any colour
S0530	every colour if it do quite impressive it would look like
S0529	it be quite pinky purple last night so
S0530	it be and i be really surprise at the colour i didn't know if it
S0529	mm
S0530	that be just cos it be cold or
S0529	no it be a weird colour
S0530	but even before i go out it be a weird colour
S0529	mm
S0530	oh dear i can't believe the cat flap in that ambulance
S0530	it be so cute then she ask me if i have freeze peas on it and i hesitate and i say freeze vegetables
S0530	oh dear i think it would be quite not a nice job but do you know what i mean like
S0529	yeah i be think that too like it wouldn't be that
S0530	like you always almost want to do it when you see people
S0529	mm i know i do definitely
S0530	i don't know what i like about it it's just
S0529	just nice you're just help people out
S0530	and it's doesn't seem that complicate either if you know what you're do
S0529	yeah like she be just kind of like
S0530	chill
S0529	do what you'd do in that situation like just you know ask how much pain you're in sit you down make you comfortable
S0530	mm mm
S0529	all that stuff it's not like difficult things
S0530	and plus you'd have a team member with you so if you
S0529	yeah
S0530	didn't know what to do they would
S0529	exactly mm it's pretty cool
S0530	they be really good the ambulance people
S0529	how do you become like an ambulance worker
S0530	they're paramedics aren't they aren't they
S0529	be they
S0530	be i think that's what
S0529	cos it's yeah but they weren't like surely they only send out like the one on one people or something for like minor things
S0530	mm
S0529	rather than like actual emergency people but yeah you might they might have just like
S0530	this be lancaster
S0529	have a quiet night yeah exactly
S0530	yeah
S0529	just come out anyway
S0530	i wonder what like be an emergency round here cos i can't apart from
S0529	mm
S0530	i bet it's students all the time
S0529	yeah it'll be student base things i think in town and stuff
S0530	so it probably won't be very serious half the stuff like in liverpool there be quite a lot of like it do get busy
S0529	mm
S0530	in term of the hospitals like the massive
S0529	yeah
S0530	and obviously you get like i dunno people in hospital it's like it's not even mostly young people it's like there's a huge range like of every single age and then there's
S0529	mm
S0530	things like homeless people who will end up in there and stuff because of stuff
S0529	mm
S0530	but
S0529	yeah i don't like hospitals
S0530	i don't like hospitals
S0529	just when they're busy it's like no
S0530	i can't but that be probably about the emptiest hospital i've ever see
S0529	i know i be so surprise
S0530	the emergency of i felt a bite silly go in on my chair when the they be just i bet the girl the the people in there at the counter be just look like why be she in a wheelchair

S0530	why be the
S0529	it's flour on the er erm macaroni but i it just do that
S0530	didn't do this the other day okay
S0531	well it's because mine mine do that as well cos it's when they when they add to process it it have a lot of flour in it and you get flour coat around the outside but it doesn't taste of anything it's and it's not harmful
S0530	oh
S0531	i know like some brand of rice you have to actually rinse it beforehand
S0529	yeah
S0531	cos it have too much flour
S0530	yeah yeah
S0531	but not with pasta erm
S0530	oh you've get coke zero this time
S0531	i know i just want like you say i didn't wanna get diet coke again and it taste it taste
S0530	what be the difference between coke zero and diet coke
S0531	market
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah i i know yeah
S0530	too feminine apparently diet coke
S0531	yeah the word diet sound too feminine it's the same with erm diet pepsi and pepsi max the other one so
S0530	like max manly
S0531	nothing more
S0529	but this be
S0531	fragile than a man's
S0529	but it's insult to men though i think like i would be insult i think if
S0530	yeah yeah
S0531	yeah it's a little bite kind of like how how low do you think of me
S0529	yeah
S0531	like
S0529	that i would exactly
S0530	by the way i texted i just tell this i texted
S0529	uhu
S0530	erm about the thing and i say i be i really enjoy meet you but i'm not sure about romantically stuff and he be like oh because you hadn't contact me i think you weren't interest that's strange and then he say what's wrong with me romantically
S0531	oh no
S0530	question mark it's no i think you be nice
S0531	well that's that's not that's not erm that's not like really bad that's just
S0530	it's not really bad it's just like how do you
S0531	awkward yeah
S0530	it's just what what do what you expect me to say like i don't
S0531	just say erm
S0530	nothing wrong with you
S0531	just say just not my type like that's how the
S0530	but it's not even that it's not my type it's just that i didn't feel attract to him in that way you know
S0531	well he doesn't need to know that
S0530	but i think that's the best way to put it isn't it just like
S0531	i just didn't feel like
S0530	i just didn't feel that attract to you not in the way that you're not objectively
S0529	i'd just lie
S0530	cos he wasn't like unattractive that that isn't the problem it's just that i wasn't attract to him in that
S0529	yeah that's what
S0531	yeah
S0529	he's you can just say he's you know
S0530	yeah
S0529	or i just didn't find
S0530	yeah
S0529	i dunno well would you stay friends with him
S0530	i mean to be honest like half the guy like when you say to people like can we just be friends they're just not interest anymore
S0531	yeah
S0530	like
S0531	that's what happen with a bite
S0530	yeah
S0529	i mean well kind of fair enough cos you do find him on tinder so
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i mean he would be
S0530	tinder tinder so it's not like
S0531	but it's alright if you meet someone in person like and i think we actually you know to be friends sort of thing
S0529	yeah no that's
S0530	be you not talk to anymore then
S0531	not really no
S0530	really
S0529	i mean say you want to be friends if you
S0531	i mean like you can just cos we actually have arrange to meet up like kind of do it out of obligation and then ever since then we haven't really speak all that much erm we just sort of say hi when we see each other it's like friendly and everything
S0530	mm
S0531	but like you can definitely tell that the interest be not there anymore
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah yeah
S0531	but i mean it's fair enough like you can't blame someone for for kind of want have sex people do that
S0530	but like i
S0530	yeah
S0531	kind of thing
S0530	i feel like girls definitely have more interest in have guy mat than guy just have girl mat just
S0531	yeah
S0530	for the sake of it you know
S0531	yeah that's true
S0530	cos every time i see a guy i don't immediately think boyfriend material whereas it seem with straight guy immediately they think oh
S0531	i would tap that
S0530	yes
S0529	but
S0530	basically
S0530	well it's not no no not with every guy but i'd say more guy than girls would potentially
S0529	no the only guy friend i have be gay so maybe it be
S0530	yeah
S0531	i bet it'll be out of date
S0529	i've be eat so many out of date things it's disgust
S0530	it won't kill you
S0529	that's why i'm so ill i do have as well
S0530	oh do you get to the bottom of what be wrong with that diet coke
S0529	never i didn't yeah
S0530	cos i've have
S0530	to be honest i've have that experience before
S0531	mm
S0530	and it's not nice
S0531	it do taste weird yeah i as well this just taste like it might have just be that one bottle that be
S0529	like just be make shitly by the
S0529	maybe just put more of this
S0531	do you stir it when you put it in
S0529	er yeah once or twice but like
S0531	cos i find that if i don't stir it it stick together
S0529	yeah
S0531	and then go a bite weird
S0530	be you make macaroni

S0529	erm like sell stuff on their own stall
S0530	oh oh yeah you say pop up stall
S0529	yeah i might try watch it from the begin today
S0530	yeah
S0529	there be some really funny episodes like the one with the be hilarious i couldn't get over that advert they do
S0529	and how it like
S0530	yes
S0529	just like it's
S0530	oh it be so funny
S0529	oh dear
S0530	oh
S0531	didn't erm sue alan sugar at one point
S0530	yes
S0530	one of the girls
S0531	why
S0530	i don't know she be call stella and i don't know why i remember well she do sue him maybe cos it be something like the apprentice have ruin her life or something
S0529	mm
S0530	like it exploit
S0531	i mean it make you very unemployable afterwards
S0530	mm
S0531	she couldn't get any job
S0529	oh oh
S0530	oh
S0531	okay
S0530	yeah yeah well to be honest if you've be on the apprentice i don't think anyone would wanna hire you
S0531	yeah that's true and i think erm the job itself be really shit like she didn't enjoy it it be very erm it wasn't what how she think it be gonna be
S0530	no
S0531	or something like that and she just
S0530	i mean what do they actually do like if there be apprentice
S0531	not the things they do on tv
S0530	no no exactly
S0531	and that's why it's so mislead like if you're a business person you be not direct a commercial and you're not act in a commercial and you're not make music for a commercial and you're not do a voiceover for a commercial
S0530	mm
S0531	you're not do any of those things
S0530	no yeah that's true
S0531	you know you have like a creative team for that so you would like sell stuff for like erm on stall or whatever really the only thing that's kind of like accurate be when they negotiate business deal with other big company
S0530	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0531	that's the only
S0530	real thing
S0531	yeah
S0530	the rest of it's just tv base

S0530	oh i've not see
S0529	no i haven't either or
S0530	no
S0529	why do this pasta taste so shit

S0529	yeah i think it be
S0530	if it's squidgy
S0529	it's really squidgy i only have it in for like ten minutes but i think it's cos i didn't put salt in before i put
S0530	oh

S0530	i only learn that tip like a few
S0529	yeah but i've always do it like without a think but i didn't do it this time cos i think

S0529	oh but then again you could get like a part time thing like work in a shop somewhere here you could probably do that
S0530	yeah see there's a cos i doubt there'll be many job on campus see as
S0529	mm
S0530	there's so many students
S0529	no probably not it mean you'd have to get the bus every time wouldn't you
S0530	oh shit yeah
S0529	cos my diet be so bad today i've eat four chicken nuggets
S0530	excellent
S0529	two choc ice
S0530	picture of health
S0529	and erm a glass of coke
S0530	brilliant
S0529	and that's probably gonna be it for today cos i have no food oh
S0530	at least it's halfway through the week i can't believe it's only halfway through the week it feel like it's take age
S0529	mm well it's thursday tomorrow
S0530	it be and then the week be nearly over
S0529	excite to go home
S0530	i be i really be
S0529	mm
S0530	actually
S0529	what time be you leave on friday
S0530	probably later on in the day cos i've get lecture so i'd say about five
S0529	mm
S0530	so i'll i'll see before i go but
S0529	mm i really wish i could like visit my dad or something but i'm too scar to ask
S0530	what to go and see him
S0529	yeah cos i can't really afford to
S0530	mm
S0529	give him any money like to well i mean i could give him a little bite but
S0530	yeah you can't really how much would it cost you to go and see him
S0529	i mean he'd probably have to drive cos that's cheapest
S0530	oh okay
S0529	so it's just petrol money really
S0530	mm
S0529	which be probably about thirty quid or something like that
S0530	do you think it would make you feel better to go home for a bite or go somewhere like i mean go to your dad's
S0529	mm
S0530	it i know it's not home but
S0529	no i dunno i think so i just oh i just wanna get out for a bite you know
S0530	yeah
S0529	everyone else get to it's just
S0530	no no definitely
S0529	mm or then at the same time that would make me feel even worse cos i'll just be like what be i do here this be not a good idea i should have just stay cos i'm just gonna have to listen to them talk about shit i don't give a shit about
S0529	for a whole three days and act interest and together you know
S0530	yeah yeah definitely do you think when you go home over christmas like your mum be gonna question you about stuff or do you think she'll leave it
S0529	be the sky blue
S0530	cos it's christmas
S0529	no hundred percent all interrogation always be it's not
S0530	mm
S0529	you know
S0530	yeah same with my family to be honest
S0529	even if i be have a good time she would still interrogate me
S0530	still ask you about yeah
S0529	yeah it's gonna be like why didn't you ring us more why have you be like cry on the phone and just not tell us what's go on and why have you be miss everything and why have you get yourself into this mess and blah blah blah blah di blah
S0530	do she know the extent of it now
S0529	mm not really
S0530	or not particularly
S0529	well i i dunno like it's difficult to just say oh yeah i haven't be go to this and this and
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	because i'm feel like
S0530	definitely
S0529	completely too depress to get out of bed sometimes or i'm too scar to go or i just don't really give a shit or a combination erm yeah that's kind of difficult to just talk about to with my mum
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	she's not really that kind of person
S0530	you can't really yeah
S0529	she's not like and she doesn't understand
S0530	be she not really that
S0530	the emotional type
S0529	no no
S0530	no
S0529	well i mean she can be but just not about this sort of thing cos she's she's just she use to tell me to snap out of it
S0530	mm
S0529	and she's just that's that sort of person
S0530	do she not see it as
S0529	really
S0530	like an emotional issue she just see it as like a
S0529	well i think she do more now and er i think she be try cos she know that like i don't like the way she have an attitude about it because of what happen like over summer and stuff and because of what happen over summer she kind of realise oh yeah be actually kind of you know struggle mentally with this and this isn't just something you she can like snap out of
S0530	yeah
S0529	really get kind of
S0530	yeah
S0529	realise that when i be like really hysterical over the summer and shit
S0530	okay
S0529	erm
S0530	yeah
S0529	but she still you know you can still sense the scepticism in her voice like
S0530	no it be shit when family just don't understand cos that's the thing cos she's not here so she can't see either
S0529	mm
S0530	so she can't mm i mean alternatively like as i've say like when you go home for christmas potentially it'll give you that escape that you need if you just choose to stay after christmas like if it might in a way it might be harder to come back but then in a way it might be easier because then you wouldn't be completely trap like you have go home sort of thing rather than
S0529	mm
S0530	but
S0529	if i carry on and go and do the plan of like go home at christmas on the i'd still have to come back
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	either way like if i be gonna leave i'd have to come
S0530	uhu
S0529	back and get my stuff and it's ridiculous
S0530	like i dunno i don't know why cos i remember when i go home when i drop out i be like tell my parent i'm gonna get a job i'm gonna do this and i didn't and i don't know why i didn't i just like probably i wouldn't be in have get in such a mess if i have do that but i just think it would be easier not to
S0529	yeah
S0530	like a break turn into i i i'll have a few weeks' break from everything and sort myself out but then i end up do nothing mm i don't know how i manage to do that it's just it's crazy think that now cos i use to just sit at home all day watch daytime tv
S0529	mm it's surprisingly easy to
S0530	it be it's so easy
S0529	do that cos but erm
S0530	that's the thing like it's so
S0529	yeah
S0530	difficult to deal with but it's so easy to get into that
S0529	mm
S0530	habit
S0529	like people sometimes ask me like how do you spend the whole year just do nothing like
S0530	it's just
S0529	when you say you do nothing
S0530	easy
S0529	for year and it's literally
S0530	it's so easy
S0529	it's literally true i didn't do a thing like all i do be sit on my phone or i just have like the radio on and i just have a cup of tea and i'd just sit on my bed and those be the only two things i would do like
S0530	mm
S0529	and it be just nothing else like yeah i mean obviously sometimes i would go out and see my friends but very rarely but yeah but it's it's easy to waste that much time like it's so easy
S0530	mm no definitely
S0529	and i'd like always have like a really strong kind of anxiety about get a job even from when i be like
S0530	yeah same
S0529	fifteen and sixteen or and that just what a nightmare
S0530	i mean some people be really desperate to get a job when they leave school like a lot of my friends
S0529	yeah
S0530	just just get them
S0529	yeah
S0530	and they use to be really happy about it and i think like i i have technically i have work so but it be for a sort of friend of a family so it wasn't
S0529	mm
S0530	so scary
S0529	what be you do
S0530	freeze
S0529	oh
S0530	so yeah and i think i swear i've do something else but i can't remember what it be i do i do something oh i've send applications off but i've never actually be accept
S0529	yeah that's the thing you realise that it's absolutely brutal it's like this horrible
S0530	it's so hard
S0529	paradox of if you have no experience they're not interest because you need
S0530	but you need experience
S0529	experience to get experience
S0530	yeah
S0529	and it's just like there's no way to break into that without one or the other like it it really infuriate me the way that they just reject you like that
S0530	like
S0529	for not have
S0530	even things that be mean to be the starter job things like waitress
S0529	i know
S0530	require experience
S0529	yeah and the way they be in the interview these days like they ask a lot they really do
S0530	mm
S0529	i go i remember i go to an interview er an interview of boot and it be like completely gruelling like the way they just
S0530	what do they ask you
S0529	they just like question me constantly and they put me on the spot and they ask me to go out into the shop and ask people what that i i have to go like sell them something and it be just like fuck hell like this be not
S0530	that sound horrendous
S0529	i just want i just need a fuck job i be desperate by this point and i i run out in tear cos i be just so overwhelm by it cos like how horrible they be like
S0530	mm
S0529	just insistent and like you have to say this and oh it be just horrible i don't i don't know it just seem so much easier for our parent to get work when they be younger like my mum have a job in a shop from when she be like fourteen years old
S0530	mm
S0529	and i couldn't even get one when i be nineteen like just do a basic job that where all we have to do be like stack shelve and that's it really
S0530	i know
S0529	it's just horrible
S0530	it's funny how they say that like you know for boot and all that er when they do the and they do it in lush as well when they kind of say the sell tactic be to press on er to like a like a customer like press them and be like go up to them and say have you see this like when i don't know about other people but when people do that to me i automatically don't want the product
S0529	don't want it exactly
S0530	why why do it why do they still consider that like a
S0529	like all i be do like he tell me to go out into the shop and pretend i be like work so i go out and like stack some shelve and shit people come up to me like ask me question like where's this where's that and i have like this old lady and feel like i i do it well enough like i just say to her what be you look for like and i and i show her where it be and then it be fine and i just smile at her i didn't like insist that she buy anything and i felt like that's what that's what you'd want in in customer service rather than when
S0530	be like
S0529	he tell me tell me to go off and
S0530	yeah
S0529	actually try and sell something to this like poor woman with a kid on her arm like who just didn't
S0530	obviously wasn't in the position
S0529	have the time of day
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah and it be just ridiculous and i have to do it cos he be like no you have to do it i have to see what you know and it's just oh yeah i mean it be just disastrous really and that be like the only interview i ever get because mm
S0530	i mean place like fast food restaurants scare me
S0529	yeah
S0530	because they're so vast
S0529	vast i know
S0530	and
S0529	i just feel incapable of it like and
S0530	mm
S0529	do it that quickly like
S0530	yeah i do
S0529	even when i do kp work for my friend's restaurant like i only do that for a couple of weeks because it be too stressful like the speed of it all and
S0530	mm
S0529	like it be so unorganised and
S0530	yeah
S0529	i just i felt like i have to do it really quickly but i didn't i couldn't do it as
S0530	mm
S0529	quickly as the plat be come and it be just like so scary
S0530	oh my god
S0529	and it's just really stupid things like that like a tiny little job like that be just so overwhelm to me and
S0530	no no
S0529	and that's why i didn't get a job
S0530	honestly i feel the same
S0529	for the whole year like it be just ridiculous
S0530	like the think of work be scary
S0529	yeah it's really scary and that's why i don't wanna leave because i i'm just scar like this be the next thing for me like if i leave here then i have to get a job and that's gonna be my life like it's not like i get a way out of that
S0530	it's weird to think that's a yeah
S0529	you know it's not like i'd go back to uni cos i won't i i've i won't have a chance to when i leave here and so i just have to work all my life and it's just it's really it's
S0530	it's a
S0529	it's petrify
S0530	yeah
S0529	it's really petrify cos it's just not what you want be it
S0530	it's a sad way to live
S0529	it be like i'm gonna be in a horrible job that i don't enjoy because i don't know what i i actually enjoy and i couldn't stick university so i can't get a job like at a higher level to begin with like i have to get crap job and yeah and that'll be
S0530	and like work your way up kind of thing
S0529	yeah but i wouldn't even do that cos i wouldn't feel like i have the ambition or the desire to you know
S0530	i guess university be more of a springboard
S0529	absolutely
S0530	towards it
S0529	that's how i see it it's just a mean to an end i only want this degree so that i can show people that i have an english degree which mean that i have the skills you know transferable in the workplace for higher up job than waitress you know
S0530	mm i know it suck
S0529	and it's just you know it's just really scary like i can't get my head round that if i drop out that's what's gonna happen i can't just sit at home for a year cos the year turn into you know more than
S0530	mm
S0529	one year and then i can't just live at home all my life i have to go out and do shit myself and that's just it's really scary cos i just don't feel like i can
S0530	alternatively how about i know you say you don't know what you'd wanna do for a different degree but if you go to like do er would you wanna do say art again
S0529	no i don't think i could
S0530	no
S0529	it's too demand i know i'm make excuse for everything but
S0530	no don't be apologise because like it's not that you're make excuse because you're like
S0529	no but i be
S0530	no no but
S0529	that's what everyone say to me
S0530	it's not that you're make excuse because say you know you're try to avoid it like oh i could easily do it but i i've get something better to do so i'm not gonna do that it's just because you feel too exhaust to even tackle it which be a completely different story so don't apologise for that it's just very tire and just very
S0529	it be
S0530	not get long leave here now though i don't know what date it be today but it's the eighteenth or something
S0529	mm
S0530	so three weeks here not sure which be well it's really strange cos we're week seven now week ten be the final week oh my god i need to get my creative write portfolio do
S0530	oh god lol
S0529	when do it have to be in
S0530	week it'll be week ten but i think i'll be able to do that i mean it's
S0529	that's
S0530	one thousand word and then
S0529	and like the start of you're gonna start it like you know say next week
S0530	yeah i think so
S0529	or this weekend if you can get like go home
S0530	week this weekend i think would be good cos i at the minute i don't feel that bogged down with other stuff so i can probably
S0529	yeah it's best to start it when you haven't get anything else cos the chance be someone something else will crop up so
S0530	yeah and i fill in that absence notification thing for the seminar that i miss now so that's okay and i just need to catch up on one of my lecture that i miss and then i'm okay but oh i don't know what i've get tomorrow i've get creative write lecture which i don't ever see any point in go to because literally i do
S0529	no
S0530	creative write last year and go to all the lecture so it's like yeah it's really strange because i feel like in a way it can't be teach
S0529	no
S0530	in that way like you you learn through life experience you don't learn through and it's write isn't just about technique
S0529	no
S0530	obviously technique come into it but it's not
S0529	yeah it must feel really bore
S0530	mm it can be
S0529	you don't have to go to them though do you like
S0530	no
S0529	could just not go
S0530	i i don't i mean i i have to go to the seminars because they're compulsory but not the lecture really
S0529	mm it make sense if you go to them last year though cos they're gonna be like kind of the same things
S0530	well they're very similar some of them
S0529	mm
S0530	and it's good because the seminars aren't like what do we cover in the lecture it's more like individually ideas for project
S0529	yeah
S0530	and stuff so it's not like a lot of i know a lot of seminars like reflect on the lecture but in creative write it's not that way so i feel less oblige to go to all the creative write stuff
S0529	mm
S0530	and i know this sound really silly but like i know the people who work in the creative write department they're publish author technically but they're not like know renowned publish author they're not like
S0529	no
S0530	do you know what i mean like
S0529	yeah
S0530	it i'm not and i'm not expect them to be but i i feel it's kind of hypocritical for the for some of them to say like this be how you should write this be how you should approach it when like some of them have get like one amazon review on their book
S0530	no joke
S0529	you've probably have more view than they than their book have
S0530	oh my god
S0529	on your blog
S0530	imagine
S0530	be quite funny if that be the case
S0529	no you probably have like that's not even an exaggeration like the therapist one get load of note
S0530	yeah that's true
S0529	so you probably have
S0530	it's quite strange think that my url come up if you type it in
S0529	i know
S0530	it's quite funny
S0529	it be also funny when you find that out like you couldn't really
S0530	i be laugh
S0529	yeah it be strange
S0530	yeah i'm on google image i can't get over everyone's on google image now though it's so funny you just type in your friend's name and it come up
S0529	i know
S0530	and it's like
S0529	you get really embarrass picture
S0530	if my arm feel like completely fine in ten days should i cancel the appointment
S0529	erm
S0530	if it feel like completely back to normal
S0529	yeah
S0529	i mean
S0530	cos you'd know if you be you'd break it and it would
S0529	yeah you you would have
S0530	heal by itself
S0530	yeah because i don't want to end up have to go down to the thing and be like two fifty and then waste your whole afternoon because i have to go on a friday and i'd miss
S0529	yeah
S0530	stuff so i only really want to go if i absolutely have to
S0529	yeah but if it's anything if they find anything on the x ray they'd probably ring you anyway
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	so
S0530	cos it look it look fine
S0529	yeah
S0530	i just go down with a bang
S0530	oh yeah i get a message today from the mental health people say

S0529	mm
S0530	like less focus on you more focus on an occasion kind of thing and i think to be honest i know this i don't know what your family be like but i think they honestly will be just glad to have you back even this i'm not say they won't go on at you because they might but i'm say like first and foremost they're not gonna be angry with you that's not gonna be the primary feel that er they'll be experience you know they might get angry with your later on or when they kind of go into it but i doubt on the first day they won't be like you've make a fuck up of everything you've ruin your life
S0530	look at all these plat in your room you disgust me you're a disgrace to yourself and to cornwall
S0530	yeah they're not gonna be like that

S0529	yeah my auntie just say to me today like i've get your christmas present and i like i didn't really i just felt really bad about it like
S0530	you felt bad
S0529	yeah
S0530	why
S0529	i dunno i just i
S0530	i know what you mean when people say they've get me present
S0529	yeah
S0530	i always feel guilty immediately
S0529	i just don't deserve for her to spend money on me like that i really don't like it's not and i don't know what to get her either like i'm just so bad at present give i just oh
S0530	i'd be excellent at present give if i have money
S0529	yeah i think you would
S0530	i'm gonna make when i have money at christmas because i'm in er i'm gonna try and save a bite of money up for christmas so i can get everybody stuff because this
S0529	yeah
S0530	er literally like at the moment oh i can't even like well i can buy myself stuff but that's minimum i can't buy book half the time because of stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it's just like it's so annoy cos you see stuff in shop say oh you know she'd like this or who would like that
S0529	mm
S0530	kind of thing i'm like oh
S0529	it's just advertise you shouldn't listen to it
S0530	i know god like
S0529	wouldn't your parent pay for your book
S0530	to be honest they but i just don't let
S0529	probably would if you ask
S0530	yeah they would to be honest like
S0529	cos it's like when you be in school and you need a new pair of shoe and they'd pay for it
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	cos it's like you know to do with your education
S0530	mm
S0530	but i don't know i think it's once i'm okay i'd be okay with ask them for like a small amount of money if once this loan thing appeal thing have come through
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's just that i'm just that be
S0530	loom in my mind
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it's like i'm ask them for money on top of potentially what they have to pay
S0529	yeah i get that
S0530	you know and it's like they already might have to pay one thousand three hundred pound and it's like
S0529	it won't come to that
S0530	i hope not please grant my appeal student finance
S0530	please give me money
S0529	if they don't there's still a chance to
S0530	appeal further
S0529	yeah
S0530	you can take it to step two i think
S0529	yeah exactly and you should
S0530	but i don't know if that'll get out of my situation like i think
S0530	i think i i think i make it pretty clear like in the
S0529	it do it it be clear in the letter the thing that you write
S0530	mm have it
S0529	it be really clear
S0530	yeah cos it wasn't just the fact that i drop out early it be because the contract be absolutely silly i couldn't refund i couldn't get money back from it
S0529	mm
S0530	and i drop out eight days before the end of the year so ridiculous amount of money to have to pay
S0529	yeah it really be what be that money even for like for maintenance or
S0530	it be for maintenance but because my
S0529	yeah
S0530	course be so short it be april i think they give me enough finance to last till june because my accommodation last till june
S0529	oh yeah i see
S0530	but i couldn't get my accommodation refund because accommodation be non refundable when you're a student in
S0529	yeah
S0530	so i yep so i couldn't just give them my money back because even if you're not live there you still have to pay the rent
S0529	yeah accommodation's never refundable
S0530	so why
S0529	anywhere
S0530	oh
S0529	it's awful
S0530	dicks
S0529	like i'm so lucky at at that i get a girl to go into my room
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	cos if i hadn't i don't know what i would have do i really don't i would have have to pay it the whole year
S0530	oh god
S0529	that be the condition at like if you leave your if you leave and you didn't have anyone in your room you'd pay your whole rent for the year
S0530	wow
S0529	but she take up the rent obviously which be oh a godsend i'm so
S0530	what if you leave in like the first week would you still have to
S0529	erm i don't know i'm not sure probably not in the first week
S0530	no
S0529	yeah cos it it i i'd just miss some sort of cut off point where you could like you know not have to pay for everything
S0530	how long do it take you to find somebody
S0529	er about three days
S0530	oh wow
S0529	i just like luckily i know her through one of my flatmates like she be it be it be my flatmate's friend who i wasn't really friends with like but she just say to me like i i hear you're like leave and she wasn't really very nice about it to be honest like she just say erm my friend like be interest in like take your room and so that we can be closer cos she be in like a house quite far away from her friend so
S0530	mm
S0529	but it be lucky that i track her down and be like hey have my room and

S0529	it be
S0530	that's really lucky
