S0013	no
S0012	i mean why can't they say what they want to do with all honesty and the other people say what they want to so with all honesty instead of say they're wrong and they're and and all this bicker and nastiness that just make you want to blow the lot up
S0008	as far as i can make out like all party be gonna reduce taxation
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	they're go to reduce the deficit
S0012	yeah
S0008	put more money into teach and the hospitals
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and er everyone's gonna to be fine
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know they're all go to do it you know some be go to do it a bite more than others
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you think well that's a bloody lie
S0012	yeah
S0008	straightforward you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos like it's a bare face like you know go through historical record you know sort of you know it say that every government within three months of them be elect have always put up tax
S0012	yeah
S0008	always it always happen and you know they might sort of disguise it you know like the conservatives
S0012	that's like with vat wasn't it
S0008	yeah the conservatives rank five
S0013	isn't that silly fifteen percent isn't it
S0008	what
S0013	go down to fifteen percent and
S0008	it be fifteen
S0013	and everyone have to change their
S0008	and now it's now twenty
S0012	it's not twenty twenty percent on anything you buy
S0008	that's right
S0012	you know other than food
S0008	yeah
S0013	but it's all this change thing isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	you get to do and
S0008	well it be seventeen and a half percent
S0013	mm
S0008	then it go down to fifteen
S0013	yeah
S0008	and then but as soon as the conservatives come in bang twenty percent
S0013	yeah
S0012	and fuel use to be no vat on it and when the tories come in they put eight percent on it
S0008	do they oh yeah that's right they do
S0012	yeah
S0008	that be before this
S0012	everybody have to have fuel everybody everybody the old people everyone
S0008	well they'll put it on food next vat on food won't they
S0012	well they've get it on fizzy drink haven't they
S0008	yeah well they've get it on erm what they call erm sort of non essentials
S0012	non essentials yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah i mean you can bet your life i mean they're go to they say oh we won't we'll make a pledge we won't put up the income tax we won't put up something else and we won't or national insurance and we won't put up something else so you think well that's council tax go to rise for a start cos they didn't mention that
S0012	yeah
S0008	but they've get to get the money from somewhere
S0012	course they have yeah
S0008	and that'll be the next thing they'll revalue or have a revaluation of council tax
S0012	well they get to really haven't they
S0008	and er the thing about revaluation all it be i mean they shouldn't it shouldn't make any difference to how much you pay unless you know you're live in a house which be undervalue
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos it should be the same but it doesn't work like that do it
S0012	no
S0008	like everyone then suddenly start pay fifty quid a year more
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know some people get sting with extra
S0012	yeah yeah that's totally wrong
S0008	yeah and such
S0013	they have that be it poll tax
S0012	it use to be poll tax
S0013	individual people wasn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	only a hundred pound
S0012	that be in it's five hundred pound each now or you know
S0013	yeah but that's how it be and everyone moan and moan about it and then they go back to house tax
S0012	yeah
S0008	well that's right
S0013	or whatever they call council tax now
S0008	council tax i mean they use
S0013	and they keep
S0008	it use to be like your council or what they call
S0012	rat
S0008	the rat use to be about you know two hundred and fifty quid a year
S0012	yeah that's it yeah
S0008	and then conservatives say oh no well we get to change that to like eight hundred quid a year
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they put up vat from fifteen to seventeen and a half percent at the same time
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	to pay for the difference so you end up pay a fortune
S0013	yeah yeah
S0012	yeah i think it be work out long long ago i can't remember that if you actually spend one pound i think ninety percent of that one pound be tax in one way or another
S0008	yeah i'm sure it be cos i mean you pay income tax for a start before you start spend
S0012	that's right yeah
S0012	then you pay twenty percent on your if if you go and buy a bottle of pop
S0008	mm
S0012	and that's that's twenty percent more you know
S0008	yeah yeah
S0012	and a bottle of pop cost you about fifty pence more
S0008	but you see you wouldn't you wouldn't you know be so worry about you know pay for it you know tax if that be use in a proper manner
S0012	yeah
S0008	everyone need you know like infrastructure don't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	like roads be build people be quick enough to moan when there's potholes and stuff but someone's get to pay for it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah and that's only fair
S0012	so this be what road tax be about wasn't it
S0008	well it start off that way
S0012	yeah
S0008	it isn't like that any more
S0012	not any more no
S0008	just go into the the general exchequer but i mean you know that's happen so often but then you know they're talk about a thousand billion pound
S0012	yeah
S0008	be what be go to cost us in the next twenty years
S0012	and we be
S0008	and they say they say well it's not much it's over twenty years so it's only whatever it be so many billion a year and you think well what
S0012	we already owe over a trillion
S0008	but what you could do with all that money
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	if
S0012	look at the hospitals and school you could have for a start
S0008	well that's right and they talk about the you know
S0012	and the nurse and doctor
S0008	on a as a much lower level it's a high speed two railway line
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	that's get a project cost of four billion or something
S0012	that's right yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and you think gosh if that money if that be spend differently
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	we don't need that do we
S0012	yeah no why would i want to get from london to birmingham in in three minutes or something stupid
S0013	it's not need
S0008	but they then they say about house they say well you know it's the cost of land you think well they put that railway line in they think nothing about compulsory purchase on the land
S0012	no
S0008	and they'll be pay like you know agricultural rat for it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	why they can't use that money to buy compulsory purchase land for house
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos you build a house i mean a hundred and fifty thousand of it be the cost of the plot innit
S0012	yeah it be yeah
S0008	you know so you can't build cheap house if you're start off
S0012	no
S0008	but then if the council's buy the land cheap you know so they plot be only you know if you call it agriculture land what be it three thousand and acre or something
S0012	yeah
S0008	or five thousand an acre
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you split that up into plot each plot be only go to cost you a few hundred quid innit
S0012	yeah
S0008	so if they start off with a few hundred quid rather than a hundred and fifty thousand
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	for a plot the house come out
S0013	yeah yeah
S0008	you know that much cheaper
S0012	yeah if you think how much a plot be now and how much a plot be when our parent buy their house
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	land be next to nothing
S0008	well that's right yeah but i mean you know i mean
S0012	i know it's all relevant but i mean they have enough money then to buy
S0008	yeah but i mean it's not or do you mean it's all relative
S0012	relative yeah
S0008	but yeah but i mean in those days it be still cheap compare to how much people earn than it be nowadays i mean not the the cost of house sort of escalate way above the cost of earn
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	in where we live there's a there be a build call right and there be a huge piece of land that stretch out
S0008	be you go to eat that
S0012	no that's for you
S0008	be it oh well well i'm sure i've have more than
S0012	that's why i leave it there
S0008	i have more than my fair share you know these people who when they go there's always one one leave
S0013	yeah you always get the last one don't you
S0008	you're always a bite hesitate to
S0012	yeah
S0008	anyway yeah go on this build
S0012	yeah this build at i mean they're long go i know but they buy about its must have be about between twenty and forty acres of land be and that cost twenty five pound an acre
S0008	mm
S0012	and they build what be now a great big estate on it and their house be sell for something like five hundred and fifty two thousand pound between five hundred and a thousand pound each and now those house be worth cos they've all get garden
S0008	mm
S0012	cos they use to have garden when they build house now there's no no garden at all cos they just build flats and stuff don't they
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	that's why it's these ex council house be such a good buy
S0012	they're a fantastic buy
S0008	cos they all have big garden's didn't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they expect people to have a vegetable plot
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	cheaper
S0008	and and stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	and all that stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	and some of them council estates especially out in the countryside be absolutely you know

S0008	why don't i just leave it there and then
S0013	that's right
S0008	it doesn't actually cost em anything
S0012	i mean that's one thing about at at the moment you can park free
S0008	yeah
S0013	just just check the time

S0013	yeah
S0008	you know so root canal but i get one one at the bottom which be it only hurt occasionally right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and she sort of do an x ray couldn't find anything wrong with it i'm say well it still hurt you know even if you can't find anything wrong with it
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i'll probably have to have that remove
S0012	well i get i go to the dentist about two or three months ago wasn't it
S0013	well we look it up it's actually er two and a half months
S0012	october i think

S0008	cos when they do when they do my teeth you know they inject it and then it take a while to wear off
S0012	yeah

S0008	yeah
S0008	sort of in your mouth you know clip it to your back teeth
S0013	right
S0008	and then you can ignore all the stuff that's go on cos you can't feel it
S0012	you don't have to go ain't you when when and then there's that woman who come up and
S0013	suck it out
S0012	suck out a chunk
