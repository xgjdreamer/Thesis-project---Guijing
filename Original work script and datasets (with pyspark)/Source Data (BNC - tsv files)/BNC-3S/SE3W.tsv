S0481	you do
S0440	there be people in this world who be not try to rip you off but ninety nine percent of the people be
S0481	well even though even though in morocco it wasn't a lot it's like two euros extra really
S0439	no that's what i that's what we say and i didn't wanna have a fight with an italian
S0481	no there's no point fight over two extra euros
S0439	no but it's just the fact that if he do that to every tourist that get in his car
S0481	yes yes mm well it's italy isn't it
S0439	yeah
S0439	but we go to pompeii the weather be really really good it must've be like eighteen degrees blue sky stun scenery but the italians don't understand the concept of signpost like
S0439	we walk around pompeii you would
S0481	like it's like
S0439	you'd expect there to be a sign say the bath house the bath house be blah blah blah blah blah blah it be use blah blah blah this be the bakery this be the no there be no sign anywhere
S0481	well when we go round
S0439	mm
S0481	in morocco
S0439	mm
S0481	there's this
S0440	do he tell you be to morocco
S0439	i don't think i i didn't know actually dad i didn't know you'd be to morocco
S0481	we didn't have a guide
S0439	mm
S0481	this be this be fair enough this be the forum
S0481	there's a forum three set of pillars here no that build over there might be the forum but this be the forum but this be the forum because i can tell and then fuck hell she be rewrite the entire plan
S0439	i can imagine her do that actually
S0481	see i tell you that couldn't be that i mean
S0439	couldn't be a forum
S0440	well we go to this place call and you'd think this
S0481	that be the day when she tell you we only go on the wet day
S0439	yeah because you apparently spend the whole holiday be like i don't wanna go i don't wanna go and then you decide randomly that you want to go
S0440	anyway anyway we get to this place and you'd think today's weather and rain be hard you've never see
S0439	do it rain today
S0440	alright yesterday's rain overnight
S0439	didn't rain yesterday
S0440	it do overnight that's what wake me up
S0481	yeah it didn't rain yesterday though do it
S0440	alright but you think that you know the all the storm we've be have
S0481	but it isn't a thunderstorm it's
S0439	shut up
S0481	it just rain heavily
S0440	alright
S0481	just accept it fuck rain heavily
S0440	it be absolutely awful so we have one umbrella where's your umbrella that i pack you for morocco
S0481	we hear the story what's it gotta to do with it
S0440	absolutely so what do do she sit stand there and she read every fuck i go off on my own in the end i be so wet
S0439	yeah
S0440	i couldn't believe but she be still there and she be gonna read every bloody sign
S0439	like
S0440	and she come back and she say that be really interest oh my god
S0439	i know i be yeah i say to i be tell about
S0481	but she must spend a lot of time out in the rain mustn't she
S0439	when we go to the tutankhamen thing
S0440	mm
S0439	oh yeah
S0481	cos if she's get talk to do she do them in the rain doesn't she
S0439	the erm well yeah the problem with well the thing be the problem with not have any sign be that by the by after a couple of hours every ruin look like every other ruin and you kind of lose appreciation for what you're actually see
S0481	how big be the area
S0440	do you have guide book
S0439	it's huge no they give you a leaflet
S0440	didn't you buy a guide book
S0439	no because they they don't basically
S0439	they don't tell you they they give there's the they only have an audio guide option but i don't particularly like audio guide because then you've get to listen to everything and i don't like that so i be like and then once you get in inside and realise there be no sign and information
S0440	it's too late
S0439	you can't go back out because they've in fact they erm they invalidate your ticket so you have to then rebuy a ticket to get back in so it's a joke but after walk around for a while it's a bite like every ruin look a bite the same
S0481	yeah
S0439	but it be really good it's it's miles though we we arrive at half past ten and we leave at half past four i think
S0439	it's huge erm
S0440	do you see the body
S0439	yes mother we do see the body it's actually really sad
S0440	oh
S0439	erm but it apparently it wasn't actually lava that fell over it be ash
S0440	ash
S0439	and all the debris and that kinda like obviously it's boil hot but it wasn't actually the lava
S0440	which which be why they're say when the next one go off when hetla or katla go off in in
S0439	one go off in sicily this week didn't it
S0440	yeah etna go off again when hetla or katla go off in iceland again that will cause massive problems because they be both
S0481	iceland must be terrify of them
S0440	they be both
S0439	mm
S0440	they be both erm glacial where the water on top turn the lava to ash and anyway it be the it when be the potato famine in eighteen forty five
S0440	well there be a volcano go off in iceland about five forty years before that
S0439	mm
S0440	and that's what cause and it cause the whole of europe to have massive disease and mass famine
S0439	mm
S0440	do you know that
S0481	no
S0440	yeah it be the the because the
S0439	dad
S0440	because the
S0440	cos the sun couldn't get through the ash cloud
S0481	mm
S0440	that's what cause massive massive and they've get trace of ash from volcanoes in iceland right down
S0439	mm
S0440	in anyway get back to this pompeii
S0439	er yeah no we wander round they some of it wasn't open you couldn't go you there be only a few house you could actually physically go inside and
S0440	mm
S0439	wander round but they they'd rebuild it not rebuild
S0440	have the
S0439	they'd they'd maintain a lot of it and they'd
S0440	i should've give you my shouldn't i upstairs it's get the map with all the house in it and it tell you who live there
S0439	oh that's great thank mum
S0440	and everything
S0481	that's just what you need isn't it

S0439	that's great thank you you don't get anything if i die dad get it all
S0440	you get twenty four thousand get twenty four thousand he get
S0439	that's not very much be it not gonna keep me go

S0439	oh
S0440	he get a spouse er that's a widower's pension
S0439	that's not very much be it
S0439	how's nan's trough of erm money go
S0481	i i need to do an annual an annual sort out
S0439	yeah
S0481	that'll be in january or february
S0440	mm

S0439	yeah i'm assume you haven't speak to about that yet
S0440	not yet no
S0440	gonna have to have an appointment
S0481	next week
S0440	no want all the money er transfer over to here so we're not gonna keep go up to for sixty quid
S0439	no but if dad i think dad dad should become power of attorney then
S0440	well yeah i do
S0481	sorry
S0440	and so do
S0481	nobody need to be power of attorney
S0439	well no but no
S0439	it the power should be give back to grandad but i think you should be on the form instead of mum and you can't mum and
S0481	we don't need any form
S0440	anyway the
S0440	the hilarious
S0481	sorry
S0439	mum let dad explain
S0481	we don't need any form
S0439	i think you have to have the form that allow someone to invoke power of attorney if something happen to grandad
S0481	well only if something happen and he go mental
S0439	yeah but why can't you be on that form
S0481	well why he's not show any sign of be mental be he
S0440	yes but you don't get it do now
S0439	no but you don't
S0440	if he go mental in the next four weeks
S0439	no but that's not the point that's not the point at all dad that's say like you wouldn't you won't take an asthma inhaler around with you because you don't think you'll have an asthma attack you don't think grandad's gonna go mental so why should you take a precaution to put something in place if he do
S0481	because power of attorney's quite a powerful document as you can see
S0439	yeah when it's badly handle so i think it's so it need to be rectify doesn't it
S0481	yes you can rectify it but you can just take him out of power of attorney he's perfectly adequate to make his own decisions
S0439	well then he should do it like i don't understand why it didn't get do
S0481	when that because these two bloody cock it up didn't they
S0440	anyway get back to the whole thing
S0481	whatever
S0440	he's i talk to him no i'm not say that i i be talk to him last week i go up last week all he want to do be watch davis cup tv the davis cup on tv and in the end i get do i tell you

S0440	it be say that for every square metre it's about seven hundred and fifty six fifteen hundred pound
S0439	that minus vat
S0440	well we don't know yet anyway so when you actually look at it seven hundred and fifty time twenty which be what we've get in there be fifteen thousand so
