S0151	do we have dairy queen in britain
S0097	dairy queen
S0151	yeah
S0179	i don't think so
S0151	oh
S0097	eh
S0179	i'm not even sure what they serve
S0151	yeah ice cream
S0097	i think there's one in oh no that's erm baskin robbins
S0151	oh
S0097	in baker street dairy queen no
S0151	mm
S0097	no
S0179	mm fuck sake
S0097	what's your favourite kind of pizza i'm guess you're a
S0151	erm
S0097	cheese
S0151	cheese
S0097	and tomato
S0151	yeah cheese and tomato
S0097	go easy on the cheese and easy on the tomato
S0151	i just like the base on its own really
S0097	try
S0151	no no my my brother cook some awful pizzas really really awful
S0097	my mum use to cook pizza when i be young and it be horrible not at all like pizza
S0151	you know the the two pizza base we have my brother make it just eh whole wheat flour just whole wheat flour
S0179	how do that keep together
S0151	i mean it's just it's basically a big sodden mush of whole wheat flour and he doesn't even bother there's no knead it involve not even rise and that
S0179	ah yeah so it would be carry out special any pizza any size for eight quid eh delivery ten quid so it's two pound so six pound extra net i think it's probably worth it to stay in
S0097	yeah i'm i'm i'm very much of the mindset that
S0151	you're so amaze you're so lazy
S0097	i'd rather pay somebody else
S0151	you're a southerner you southerners be so
S0097	why have a dog and bark yourself
S0151	i'll be go and
S0097	yeah
S0179	this be the person who say that it wasn't worth pay a cleaner
S0097	yeah that be different
S0179	it's not nine pound
S0097	it be
S0179	she do the entire house
S0097	if if i have a cleaner
S0151	the thing be you don't have secrets whereas
S0097	i have to take a round every time
S0151	have a flat full of
S0097	and the eh and swastika off the wall every time they come in
S0151	yeah
S0097	that's just erm i'd put away my autograph copy of mein kampf
S0179	that's stupid look
S0151	that's the second time we've discuss mein kampf tonight actually erm
S0097	really
S0151	yeah
S0097	what be the chance
S0151	it come out very well tonight peter be say he like listen to the audio version of mein kampf when he's at work in the morning
S0097	set him up for the day
S0151	well he say to me he say just when he start use he say this be inoffensive unlike what i normally listen to and i be by that i assume it must have be the audio version of mein kampf
S0179	yeah but it's quite a lot of extrapolation there to be fair so they've get this really shit deal whereby so you've select a deal erm any size pizza to carry out from erm eight pound for eight pound or alternatively carry out special large get any large pizza for eleven pound to collect so eh why would you bother
S0097	what
S0179	yeah if you if you want to you can pay three pound more for the same thing
S0097	mm this be a job for watch dog
S0151	yeah
S0097	so it's kind of
S0151	i think
S0097	it's a scandal
S0151	do you you watch watchdog
S0097	yeah
S0151	that's what you do in the even
S0179	eh
S0097	week repeat of of
S0151	yeah
S0097	i like
S0151	do you like there's crimewatch you you watch them and then i wonder who commit the crown and the you can find it
S0097	yeah then google it
S0151	yeah
S0097	and erm i know yeah
S0179	you live dangerously erm so what erm okay so what erm okay so
S0151	what's our choice of the pizza
S0179	let's have a look em i like this one cos you actually see a photo of the pizza
S0097	eh that's pretty interest
S0179	okay so that's pretty hot it wouldn't be my choice em that's quite nice it leave a thinner base sort of like mean to be italian style
S0097	mm hm
S0179	that's 's choice apparently
S0151	yeah
S0179	that's pretty good
S0097	that's pretty meaty
S0179	pepperoni passion pretty good mind you to be fair i'd recommend if you want pepperoni go for a new yorker cos you get only as much pepperoni a few other bits that's pretty nice that one
S0097	sixteen ninety nine
S0179	yes but we're only pay ten
S0097	oh
S0179	erm i've never pay full price
S0179	stupid i know erm yeah reasonable erm unless anyone be vegetarian please not yeah that's it's fine but not that not
S0097	yeah who nowadays buy tuna on a pizza
S0179	well it's just not that interest
S0151	really ham and pineapple
S0179	that's actually quite nice surprisingly

S0097	let's have something meaty
S0151	something meaty something
S0097	something dull for
S0151	yeah something bore for me
S0097	and eh
S0179	do you seriously want cheese and tomato
S0151	no right
S0097	eh
S0179	active well i be go to say it's cheaper
S0151	although it be actually fine as well but i'm not i'm i'm

S0097	yeah
S0151	oh what shall i have on the menu it's like a half hour discussion as to what's on the menu and like how spicy be the noodle soup or something it's not so spicy it's at wagamama's it's just a kind of cheap noodle place
S0097	it's mild even the hot stuff be mild
S0179	oh the erm i've get a friend who doesn't he who he actually be better now he didn't use to eat either cheese or tomato
S0151	mm
S0179	that's surprise difficult in life

S0151	mm
S0097	yeah why do he not eat

S0097	that's dangerous
S0151	he wouldn't even eat potatoes
S0097	yeah
S0179	oh that's it's not very healthy but i mean anyway so erm i would suggest rustica cos it's a bite lighter than the other ones

S0151	yeah like those those poly poly ethylene foam you know they're someone be be pay thirteen k a year to make them honestly and that's in a clean room
S0097	yeah it's a skilled job
S0151	that's like for a semi skilled job you must be semi skilled know how to use all of the equipment and you get pay thirteen k a year
S0097	that's
S0151	and you're pay tax on it and you've get to buy a house and have a mortgage and get to work every day
S0179	you know it's scotland
S0151	it's still
S0097	but still
S0179	you can buy a house in sunderland for thirty grand
S0151	mm
S0179	will get you a three bedroomed terrace house
S0151	this this be the thing
S0179	but still no front door
S0097	even now
S0179	yeah i mean but the house would be literally gutted you would need to completely redo it but
S0097	i i i've em i live near durham and i've eh buy a house this be within two thousand for eh thirty nine
S0151	mm
S0097	a brand new not a brand new but only one person live in it before
S0151	mm
S0097	a new build two bedroomed house for thirty nine thousand
S0179	hang on you buy a house in two sorry how do you
S0151	i guess he's older than you
S0097	the years have be kind and i sell it a year later for forty nine thousand pound
S0179	not bad
S0097	and then somebody sell it at the peak of the property market in two thousand and
S0179	mm hm
S0097	for a hundred eh and sixty five thousand
S0179	you really should have keep that
S0097	my dad say to me whatever you do do not sell the house and i be like but i want ten thousand pound now
S0151	oh
S0097	i do i use that money to do my master but so i need the money
S0179	yeah
S0097	but i could have now have
S0151	yeah
S0097	a hundred and seventy thousand
S0151	so many people become rich
S0097	yeah
S0151	just from
S0097	just to
S0151	property from no right no sorry i be gonna say be that yeah in methyl in south coast of fife you can get a single person flat for about twenty five thousand pound and it's nice enough
S0097	even now you can get
S0151	even now i think it's an okay place like it's
S0097	that surely
S0151	it's not not like this
S0097	yeah it's yeah you could live in it
S0151	and it's clean and it's not fall to piece eh and it have a dvd player and furniture but it's perfectly you could happily live in something like twenty five k however the problem be in house be similar price to cambourne say and you're you're get pay thirteen k a year
S0179	yeah but it's
S0151	and it be some part of be strangely expensive and that area be quite expensive eh where actually be there's a town right next to that which be cheap but it's not as cheap you know you'd need it to be for the thirteen k you know
S0179	just go back to that for a second
S0097	yeah
S0179	how old be you
S0097	thirty three
S0179	so you're the same age as
S0097	yes
S0097	i cannot believe that be thirty three
S0179	how be that possible
S0151	i think be the same i think he's thirty three or thirty four
S0179	thirty
S0097	but he can't how long have jan be at ttp
S0179	twelve years
S0151	but i work i work
S0097	if he's twelve years then if he if he join straight from university then yeah that's
S0151	yes
S0097	so he be twenty one
S0151	yeah
S0179	that's insane
S0097	but jan be probably ten time fitter than me which be the eh
S0151	which be
S0097	bizarre have you play squash with jan
S0179	no i don't play squash
S0097	yeah don't play squash against jan then
S0151	jan jan's the well the things i hear about jan he's really good at play squash
S0097	yeah he be
S0151	and tennis as well
S0097	and cricket and
S0151	and all that sort of stuff
S0097	yeah but he doesn't look like it at all
S0151	but but yet he just doesn't look it's just the way he's like you know
S0097	mm he's a
S0097	no he's a well he's county squash
S0151	yeah
S0097	squash players be normally whippets aren't they you know like you can imagine rob play squash or something
S0151	yeah
S0097	that sort of build but
S0179	i just yeah that's pretty weird one thing i would be absolutely fascinate to do be see jan's home like see his
S0097	yeah i hear he's get a cat
S0179	yeah i know he's get a cat
S0151	his cat's get hiv
S0097	really
S0151	yeah his cat's get hiv or a cat version of it it do he's quite upset about it a few months ago
S0097	how do he get that off another cat
S0151	the cat be like just play around
S0097	be that
S0179	sleep about
S0097	so can a human
S0151	no and not unless i i and even if you try i don't think you'd probably get it
S0097	no but a cat can you know a cat can bite you or
S0151	yeah i think it's i don't think it's yeah
S0097	yeah cos surely that will
S0179	i'm sure that be
S0097	it would be quite the news story if cat be walk around
S0151	yeah
S0179	actually that be say i'm sure the daily mail will run that
S0097	yeah yeah erm
S0151	cos he be look up for a website one day at work about erm cat hiv and i start laugh and eh and it turn out that he be eh actually quite touchy about that subject
S0179	that's nothing the erm eh sorry that be something erm
S0097	mm
S0179	but a friend of mine manage to so the first term at uni so we have a girl at our college who be a miserable cow erm but she look even more miserable than all and it turn out her grandfather have bite it early on have just die
S0097	mm
S0179	who she be pretty close to erm she be em and she be stand out on the one day and come along and ask her oh who's die
S0097	yeah well it's quite easy to say that isn't it
S0151	eh there's actually a friend of mine in school and we be sit in the physics class and this mate of mine didn't get on with this other mate of mine
S0179	right
S0151	and erm they be just have a go at each other and i can't remember what it be exactly
S0179	jealousy clearly
S0151	just it be something and they be just argue you know and the guy say well i bet you go home and fuck your mother every night you know and everyone in the class just sit there in silence look at them you know and erm the guy be like i wouldn't say that to me shaun then he's like why be that what be you go to do about it he's like i might start cry and at that point the guy be like oh that's not the retort what i be expect and he look around the class and the whole class be look at me like you be such a shit bag and he's like what's wrong he's like my mother's dead he's like everybody know that you know and he'd be in the class for the last six years and for some reason he's the only one that didn't know that
S0097	hadn't pick up on it
S0151	yeah it be right that be that be an amaze moment when he look around and he's like eh something's go wrong here
S0179	that's a good way of win an argument
S0151	he do apologise profusely after that he be he really didn't mean it eh
S0179	i be gonna say i bet he be go it well he be probably a bite young but he have a lot of drink buy for him
S0151	mm yeah i think yeah he probably probably do i think actually strangely i think they get on better after that i think once they just get along get over that that level you know
S0179	yeah once that come out into the open it be just gonna go uphill though
S0151	yeah
S0179	ow
S0151	be the child bite back
S0179	ow
S0151	that's the dungeon door
S0097	be he just not wear the top he be
S0151	yeah he's slowly get undress
S0097	he
S0151	as we're talk to him
S0097	take his sock off before and take his
S0151	and now he take his top off obviously for if you're listen to this be gradually undress and make advance towards on the sofa
S0097	oh no
S0151	oh he's he's slip into something more comfortable
S0097	i think
S0179	what's that sorry
S0151	if sarah do listen to this she's be tell that you be pull your clothe off and make advance towards richard
S0179	pretty much a normal friday night
S0179	em yeah so erm sorry what be we say what be you in my leather
S0097	cat have get hiv
S0151	oh yeah
S0097	so be 's cat gonna die
S0151	i don't know if it's
S0179	yeah
S0151	i think he just have the one cat i mean i can tell if he
S0097	i might meet her it's probably be erm
S0097	mm
S0179	erm but yeah it's that's something that would be fascinate to go and actually see cos i think it would either a complete pit or really obsessively tidy
S0097	i think you can judge them by how somebodies desk be order
S0151	by somebody's desk yeah
S0097	you know like he line everything up eh whereas if you go and look at them abbey graham's desk and i for people that have be to her house
S0151	if you can find her desk
S0097	her flat be the same as her desk
S0151	yeah
S0097	it's like
S0179	yeah then that kinda make sense actually
S0151	i remember before she move offices i don't know if you saw her desk in the previous office
S0179	yes
S0151	but it there be one point it be just slop down to the to there
S0097	but it also you know
S0151	it be like it be actually like one side of the desk it be climb down in a big pile right onto the floor
S0097	she sit right next to as well doesn't she
S0151	yeah unbelievable
S0097	and 's very tidy so
S0179	matthews in the mafia i never do like waste removal but i think that be something different
S0151	see my desk be somewhere in the middle it's not obsessively tidy
S0097	yeah
S0151	and so be my
S0097	i have a tidy up every erm so often
S0151	i have a tidy up every few weeks i tidy my desk
S0151	but i don't mind like i throw things like all over the floor sometimes
S0097	yeah it
S0151	but it will be tidy up at some point erm
S0097	you should get it really messy just between the doors
S0151	yeah erm
S0179	mm but to be honest there's many things that could do like that
S0097	yeah
S0179	mm
S0097	gary be gary
S0151	be there
S0179	speak of which how be 's leave thing
S0151	it's
S0097	i think she might erm give you both barrel
S0151	no she's isn't she's not that kind of a person be she
S0097	well she's make it pretty clear this week that
S0151	mm hm
S0097	cos she go out at four thirty yesterday
S0151	yeah yeah
S0097	four weeks she's get
S0151	oh i like her though
S0097	no you i don't i don't think you should especially if you're
S0151	look at
S0097	didn't
S0151	he barely do anything for the last year
S0179	he be only there for two
S0097	i i i eh i i don't agree with that i think he do he he be conscientious to the
S0151	he say lot
S0097	he just he didn't have that much to do
S0151	maybe
S0097	but he be conscientious till the end i remember him he be there like until seven o'clock on his last night finish stuff too
S0151	yeah oh wait can i just maybe he just wasn't busy i get work everywhere so
S0097	but i think might eh cos yeah might say
S0151	yeah eh les be suppose to stay longer but even as soon as i come in there he be like he say he say i look like i leave as soon as i could otherwise i be gonna say something because i think you know be say oh you do a really good job with
S0097	yeah i know
S0151	and
S0097	he well you
S0151	all that stuff the clients be really please
S0097	yeah cos i be yeah
S0151	that's that's exactly why he have a very enormous argument with her be for the work she be do on top of clients
S0097	see be mean to do this thing cos i hear him on the phone
S0151	oh yeah
S0097	this morning say
S0097	cos you know that's why he say oh i ask to see you cos be on the phone to him this morning say eh yeah i be hop you would do 's leave thing can you just write
S0151	that's would have be that would have be be shameful if have do that
S0097	yeah he'd have probably organise a meet or something so he didn't have to deal with it
S0151	that's what i be think i be surprise he be there actually
S0097	yeah
S0151	cos i think he would be away somewhere
S0097	yeah
S0179	mm
S0097	a bite uncomfortable
S0151	yeah
S0097	but erm
S0179	yeah i'm eh glad i miss that actually
S0097	mm i erm
S0151	it could have be worse actually i think that she have reason for
S0097	yeah well she
S0151	but wasn't
S0097	and be you know like a number of people that turn up cos she know lot of people you know eh she she you know she she's consider how long she's be there
S0151	mm
S0097	you know i don't know half those people that she know
S0097	she she that turn up to
S0151	so if you leave next week
S0097	just be erm
S0151	i think i'd just hire i wouldn't bother come
S0097	probably just be yeah two or three people
S0151	you me and
S0097	i know slow hand clap a little boo
S0151	boo
S0179	but how long have you be at
S0097	three years
S0179	okay erm wow yeah i somebody tell me that everyone be there for so much longer but mm
S0097	yeah there's a if you look them
S0151	there's a
S0097	so around the time i join so just before me join you don't know
S0179	no i don't think i know her no
S0097	so she join six months before me erm be a couple of months before her be a couple of months before that eh erm and then
S0179	and have come in after you
S0097	yeah so well 's be here like
S0179	
S0097	have be there a long time
S0179	mm
S0097	erm
S0179	who be that
S0097	
S0097	sit about three foot from you
S0179	oh yeah yeah good point
S0097	yeah yeah they've all be there a long time and so and then there be like a since i've join there's be i suppose a slow trickle of people so there's you know i've probably be i've be 's be there for a long time obviously erm i mean there's quite a few a few people have leave and do you know no you
S0179	no
S0097	didn't know
S0151	i can't believe since he leave
S0097	do you think
S0151	all the people that ever talk about don't say anything nice about him
S0179	really
S0097	no that's not fair
S0151	i don't think it's fair either i think because well if 's not that keen on him
S0097	well he yeah he'll you know he'd bad mouth his own mother
S0151	erm who else but
S0179	well presumably cos he have ideas of his own but didn't
S0097	yeah i think he they clash with on eh well who else
S0151	but most people have no one anyone that's ever speak to me about him be that will still speak about him
S0097	he have be
S0151	yeah
S0097	it's amaze how people get forget when they leave like complete throughout sort of
S0179	you saw his tool box i think he might
S0151	saw his tool box yeah
S0097	always there
S0151	but i'll i don't know people yeah
S0097	mm
S0151	maybe it's because the project go all wrong while he be front
S0097	that wasn't his fault
S0151	i don't think it be no
S0097	that that
S0151	no the thing be
S0097	would have go wrong along time it go wrong at the design stage when they design the most complicate thing in the world
S0151	and and also partly just use the situation at the time without any money design it without the money to support it
S0097	yeah he inherit it at the point where he be
S0151	where it be all go wrong but then when he because of that he get to leave and he take the the blame for it you know
S0179	oh he actually leave because of that
S0097	no he well he what be it erm he i don't think he
S0151	i think he probably
S0097	i think he be a not for since really i i've know him from mt days he be not overly you could say he be not overly happy
S0151	oh okay
S0097	and i think it be erm
S0151	so i feel like it do stress him out a lot
S0097	i bet it do yeah cos it's just
S0151	he's he's
S0097	a terrible job it's like on
S0151	yeah
S0097	just a thankless task basically
S0151	yeah
S0097	you know that's the one thing like
S0151	but the main thing the image of manage be the main thing that make me not want to be a project leader and i just remember sit there at his desk everyday like this be really stress and erm just not cos he have no money he have tonnes of work to do
S0097	yeah yeah
S0151	absolutely no cash to do it with
S0097	and and the design be already set in stone he couldn't do anything apart from
S0151	and as much as like use to ask me to do impossible things
S0097	yeah
S0151	he'd tell me to i can't remember he basically ask me to do something but then also at the same time he's tell me not to do it cos we didn't have any money
S0097	yeah
S0151	but nonetheless
S0097	okay then you go and do it
S0151	you need to get it fix
S0097	yeah
S0151	sort of thing but the thing be i can totally understand the issue
S0097	yeah
S0151	the situation he be in i know but i do you know you can't go against him and that you know but erm yeah
S0179	the erm what be i think erm how em that's much better form in my head i've completely forget ignore me
S0151	do you know last month in the meet erm remember we be talk about do the k2 drop test that eh
S0097	oh yeah yeah
S0151	and david be like erm eh yeah of course as gary be say eh you know nothing actually work
S0097	don't say that
S0151	you can't say that
S0097	it's like when adrian pip up with the eh
S0179	oh yeah
S0097	don't yeah nobody touch the rig cos it will kill you
S0097	instantaneously it will kill you
S0151	yeah
S0179	to be fair
S0097	and then be like oh god don't
S0151	you stupid
S0097	don't announce that in the you know it's like
S0179	well to be fair but hmm he have a good point in the sense of
S0097	it would
S0179	yeah as in it wasn't go to be dangerous it's where we're all work and therefore we should all have be tell about it
S0097	yeah
S0179	so his goal be to frighten us into not touch it
S0097	yeah
S0179	but of course then there be this huge
S0097	yeah it's like
S0151	it give the thing be take it literally and

S0151	yeah
S0179	erm it wasn't it

S0097	you know
S0151	he's pathetic though
S0097	yeah
S0151	you know
S0179	mm
S0151	but he's such a he's they they don't get on at all so its erm
S0097	yeah i don't know he like he pick at her you know when he'll pick up the littlest thing to try and eh
S0179	which be quite entertain see as she's do but in judgement of the quality fit
S0097	mm yeah yeah yeah
S0151	do you remember when do tell that erm she be leave he be try to get her to stay then
S0097	really
S0151	yeah
S0097	cos then it reflect badly on him i bet
S0151	probably
S0179	yes it's not the
S0151	he be like oh why on earth be you want to leave you've do a really good job that's what he be say to her
S0097	be that
S0151	he wasn't
S0097	but you make me cry a couple of weeks ago you be so horrible to me you know so
S0179	yeah i mean view either way that's like you don't have to like someone but that's appal people management
S0151	mm
S0097	oh yeah
S0151	i remember there be one one day
S0179	and it's quite sorry not to interrupt but
S0097	it's alright
S0179	i be just interrupt
S0179	eh but that be quite a substantial and important part of his job
S0097	yeah yeah
S0179	sorry you be say
S0151	eh so no the i remember one day erm be in the office must have be a bite touchy and i think be there
S0097	mm
S0151	and eh say something about 's jumper be really bobbly or something and turn around and say to of you shouldn't pick on her for her shirt be bobbly and i be just eh
S0097	yeah yeah
S0151	something like that so they and then go over to and be like if you think i'm bully my staff go and make an official complaint about it
S0097	he didn't
S0151	i hear him say that
S0097	he do not
S0151	he say
S0097	i could i think be immune to that because he wouldn't
S0151	he say that to her and then it be about half an hour later he run after her and say i'm really sorry about that he say i oh sorry about that
S0097	he's
S0151	that be the only time i've see him
S0097	yeah yeah
S0151	have a go at and then i think
S0097	yeah yeah i think i think he couldn't say anything to her
S0151	but he's almost he's basically no i be just i be just amaze that he say something like that
S0097	i'm surprise that didn't tell him to
S0151	yeah you should make an official complaint about it if you think i'm have a go at my staff and then erm he be with her half an hour an hour later he's like i'm really sorry about that i really appreciate the stuff that you're do erm
S0179	eh two question firstly we can do that and secondly
S0151	right well yeah
S0097	i think it's be do three or four time in the last six months
S0151	well you'd think
S0097	yeah
S0179	in general or specifically
S0097	do it
S0179	he
S0097	and have probably do it surreptitiously
S0151	this be why just doesn't i i don't talk to we be behind each other so erm
S0179	cos you sit next to him that's quite
S0151	erm it's a bite we we use to sit even closer than that
S0097	he's like
S0151	he use to sit where steven be then
S0097	yeah
S0179	eh huh
S0151	and we never speak to each other
S0097	until he move himself to eh eh his own desk which people very amusingly the other group like people walk through the office like the other group leaders like jamie point out what be you sit on your own desk cos none of them do and then he be like you know so it's the air flow or the eh the ac or the light i eh it's eh it's quite funny
S0179	mm
S0097	need separate himself from the minions yeah
S0179	the erm another question erm so why why this erm immunity on 's behalf
S0097	just because she she couldn't say anything you know
S0151	yeah
S0097	cos she say lot of things that nobody else could get away with say you
S0151	you can't you can never annoy the secretary can you
S0097	yeah
S0151	she be
S0097	and you know she'll just she's yeah you don't want to piss her off
S0151	mm
S0097	there's nothing there's nothing that you could gain by annoy
S0151	yeah exactly she's a
S0097	apart from
S0179	do be fair there's nothing you can gain by annoy anyone
S0097	no but he see it as like he
S0179	mm hmm
S0097	sort of get a bite of a holdover like because someone say you know because he can he can make your life
S0179	mm
S0097	you know he can
S0179	but he if you know
S0151	but the thing be
S0097	what would he do to get
S0179	because people would just leave
S0151	the thing be
S0097	yeah exactly yeah
S0179	yeah everyone be pretty employable
S0151	if he want he can have a go at me
S0097	yeah
S0151	and he can say oh that's not right why be you turn up late and all this all this sort of stuff
S0097	mm
S0151	and i can't do anything back
S0097	yeah
S0151	whereas if he annoy could not book him his flight put him in crap worth house you know just erm stuff like that or just that he do actually he require things
S0097	yeah
S0151	on a one to one basis from and
S0097	he need a good relationship with
S0151	yeah
S0097	he well you know he i know he need a good relationship with everybody but it's eh yeah
S0151	but the erm the the
S0179	the thing be i i
S0151	the delay between piss off one of us and get some retribution be a year or something
S0179	mm
S0151	between be probably later on in that afternoon yeah
S0179	and you just put up with him
S0097	he doesn't think before he
S0151	yeah
S0097	like he
S0179	you see the thing be i don't i've never have any particular problems with him i i think he's get good point and bad point i don't think he's fundamentally an unpleasant person i just think he's get an extremely bad people skills
S0097	yeah that's it i agree i think he just doesn't think before but he he say things
S0151	see i use to think that he be probably a bad person
S0151	i know everyone say that he's probably a nice guy but he's just get bad people skills i don't think he really be actually i think he be probably an unpleasant person
S0097	he's
S0151	not massively unpleasant but just not that nice you know
S0097	he's insecure
S0179	yes he's very insecure
S0097	very
S0179	which have be eh one i have one or two problems with
S0097	yeah
S0179	when he's take stuff up so very defensively
S0097	yeah he's
S0179	mm
S0097	yeah even when he's yeah i know he say erm so he use when so when i start he wasn't group head obviously he be erm
S0179	yeah so what be the history of our team
S0097	so when i start it be
S0179	right
S0097	which be the head who's the head of s t
S0179	okay
S0097	and be sort of the second in you know he be the main
S0179	what be now
S0097	yeah yes but eh yeah yeah exactly i suppose so the main business open guy and you know erm eh when mt start it be a choice between and to be the head and be very upset that he wasn't the head
S0179	okay
S0097	eh be 's pet
S0179	mm hm
S0097	you know like they he's like groom basically
S0179	okay
S0097	erm so that's anyway so and then after a year erm of me be there it split into s t didn't exist before that really it's half the people from m t go to s t erm i go to st and then eh erm md start with half the people remain
S0179	sorry can you just go through that again so it be originally mt
S0097	yeah originally m t and then st form and then it take half the people from a s
S0179	right
S0097	and half the people from m d
S0179	right
S0097	m t and then the remain people from mt go and form md
S0179	a s must have be huge
S0097	yes it be it be very big yeah oh no they lose yeah so m s t be twenty two people when i be start half from m d m t half from a s and then
S0179	so so m d be how old
S0097	erm a year and eh two actually easter will be two years
S0179	okay so hang on so be second in command a o t
S0097	yeah
S0179	a s have be sorry s t then form and so matthew go off to lead that
S0097	yeah
S0179	and so become head of m d
S0097	yes exactly
S0179	which m d form a per cent of okay right get you erm the original feel be you be say be a bite insecure because
S0097	erm yeah you know he be just be insecure but
S0179	mm hm
S0097	yeah just he
S0151	which he freely admit actually
S0097	yeah yeah and he worry about you know he worry about how stuff be perceive and how
S0151	mm hm
S0097	erm yeah and
S0179	but it's an interest cos i always think be insecure you you would want people to like you
S0097	yeah well i think that manifest you know
S0151	well
S0097	and it's get a bite of a temper as well
S0151	really
S0097	as well yeah he doesn't like be undermine at all you know for example so like the story i be go to say when he be in erm so for jam clay for example be erm he join a couple of months after me permanently
S0179	mm fine
S0097	yeah so he join when he graduate from
S0179	yeah
S0097	but he'd be there on erm eh summer placement like the year before or two years before so he move over when he be mm less
S0179	yeah
S0097	senior sort of thing and they use to have a right laugh
S0179	mm
S0097	the thing with
S0179	mm
S0097	be really good friends with him cos he know him from the time when he wasn't the senior guy and they would go out and you know you could take the piss out of him so when they be on this erm on his placement he have a real laugh with apparently they use to take the piss out at each other and he try to do it when he come back
S0151	yeah
S0097	and say to him don't do that again
S0151	mm
S0097	you can't you know you're not allow to take the piss at me anymore basically because i'm you know eh don't if you do that again they'll be trouble
S0151	mm
S0097	and it completely change their relationship you know eh basically he say don't ever don't undermine me in public because yeah and that show he's you know really insecure on his behalf
S0179	yeah that's interest
S0097	cos eh yeah
S0179	yeah mm
S0097	so that's a pot history of my time at ttp
S0179	oh i've learn an awful lot in the last half hour erm yeah that's fascinate what have you find that other people be sort of wonder so for example like patrick i always think be to you know obviously get on with everyone really but i always think it be very superficial superficial be the wrong word but i always think be sort of okay i'm not express this very well but that he be someone help
S0151	i don't know what you're try to express
S0179	that it be sort of eh that's the pizza and that's our doorbell not work again
S0097	i need to go and erm make room for dinner
S0151	and eh
S0179	see the interest thing with erm be eh the interest thing i think he's get perceptions of people now i think he kind of like me and i think that's because i'm i i think i'm the type of person that he a want for ttp and for some reason he'd quite like to be in term of in term of background as in a engineer first
S0151	mm hm
S0179	which i think he attach more of an importance to
S0151	what sorry
S0179	as in engineer first
S0151	oh engineer i think you say chemical engineer first i be gonna say wow you're struggle to do your
S0179	erm and i think that's sort of
S0151	sorry what's what's i don't actually know
S0179	eh his phd eh from
S0151	okay
S0179	and i think undergrad as well
S0151	aye
S0179	erm and i think he's probably get a bite of sort of i don't know envy
S0151	mm
S0179	and therefore massively like have that value distort out of all proportion
S0151	mm
S0179	erm whereas you see yeah i don't know i think eh his relationship with be fascinate
S0151	yeah they're not that not that terribly keen on each other which make me surprise that make erm a new bite for his bike last night in his workshop mm
S0179	although to be fair the at the end of the day be a lovely guy
S0151	mm i guess he just he like make stuff
S0179	but the erm oh he's 's a fascinate combination of skills now i've get eh we can all sit in here put a pizza on here it work very well i've get this well practice erm eh drink incidentally
S0151	eh i'll yes i might actually have a beer actually see as we're have pizza have you leave a floater in there
S0097	i do yeah mm that smell nice
S0179	erm drink

S0097	eh yeah go on then but don't open it if it's eh
S0179	no no we get it the other day cos i godparents come over and my eh godfather erm be extremely allergic to alcohol
