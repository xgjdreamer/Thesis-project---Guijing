S0428	that's amaze
S0432	yeah
S0470	yes
S0428	because it's only you only have to hook one person and then they they kind of get ten people involve so it's it be just make like make put it out there so
S0432	yeah
S0470	how how do people find it work work best by organise a bite of an event like come along and and talk or just have lunch with a friend or something like that
S0428	most of them be just have lunch with a friend or like a family put it on while they're they
S0432	have dinner or something
S0428	yeah
S0470	yes
S0428	i mean we don't ever listen to the record so it's they they kind of come in and we just check that the sound they be not have a disco go on in the background but erm
S0470	yeah
S0428	yeah so we don't really know what what the content be often
S0432	yeah
S0428	but it be incredible we get like we be start to process like the like the first word and soon we'll have the first five million all kind of process and clean up and it be just really excite to to be be able to see what's gonna come out of it and
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0470	i'm interest in the different type of language that we use for different occasion
S0428	mm
S0432	yeah
S0470	so you be talk about say what be the most common word be use at cambridge university press and that's interest
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0470	so i imagine it be different from what you would get if you go to a school playground or even if you go to a pub
S0432	yeah yeah yeah definitely
S0428	yeah in fact we be go to when we've get those all the conversations in from last time they they be not quite fully transcribe yet we will put together all the record make at lunch time here
S0470	right
S0428	and find out kind of do we have a wider vocabulary than average or not be it smaller or
S0432	yeah just do a little bite of analysis on it
S0470	oh dear right
S0432	oh no don't worry
S0470	it might not be what we want to know might it
S0428	just chuck in some long word
S0470	it would be serendipity if we do turn out some
S0428	what do you do here
S0470	what do i do i do market in the bibles department and it's good to come and talk to you today because there's only four of us and the other three have all just all leave to go to a trip
S0428	ah
S0432	ah so you're on your own today
S0470	i be on my own well this afternoon anyway
S0432	ah oh no
S0428	so there's only four people in the bible and there's just
S0470	yes yes
S0428	it's tiny
S0470	yeah and the others be all men
S0428	oh really
S0432	ah
S0470	yes so so it be nice to nice and come and talk
S0432	yeah
S0428	and be there a lot like you know the market bibles where how do you you know how
S0470	how do we do it
S0428	how what do you where do you have to go and
S0470	well principally through the trade through
S0470	yeah there's a christian bookshops be the the second largest type of bookshop specialists with children's book be the largest
S0428	mm
S0432	mm
S0470	but if you think about it there aren't many shop that specialise in fish book or sport book or politics book
S0428	no
S0432	no that's true
S0470	on their own or even cookery book although that's probably the one of the biggest areas
S0432	yeah
S0428	quite a good idea for a shop isn't it a cookery book shop
S0432	yeah
S0470	well yeah you could have the author along to do their taste
S0428	mm
S0432	yeah
S0470	i guess it's not really it be not really us though be it be not very
S0428	no
S0432	no
S0428	i don't think it would go down well here but er
S0432	yeah oh that's
S0470	yeah so there's lot of christian bookshops for example the the they keep be take over by different group but erm there's the clc bookshop on
S0428	yeah we cycle past that
S0470	yeah
S0432	be that be that the only one in
S0470	it be now there use
S0432	yeah
S0470	to be an spck which get take over by another organisation and didn't flourish
S0432	oh no
S0470	shall we say and there's there be a little one in 's church but it be more of a book stall than shop
S0428	ah yeah
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah i think i know
S0470	yeah so diminish market but you know like any other bookshop they're subject to the internet
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	and what other book be it just pure bibles or be there other book that be publish connect to it or
S0470	er its well there's two sort of book there's bibles and prayer book
S0428	mm hm
S0470	but there there's no there's no new author
S0428	so it's just
S0470	if there be a book about bibles you know like a commentary then that would be do by the religious study
S0428	oh okay
S0432	oh yeah of course yeah
S0470	so we specialise in the fine bind bind in the traditional way with fine leather and india paper
S0428	oh wow
S0432	oh wow
S0428	that must be such a lovely job to put those together and work with all those lovely materials
S0470	mm
S0432	mm
S0470	yeah it's
S0428	and do you get them where be they bind be they bind in
S0470	well some of them be bind in the netherlands which be why my colleagues have go to see the people who do the bind
S0428	ah
S0432	ah so they're go over
S0470	we use to have our we use to do print and bind here
S0432	mm
S0428	yeah
S0470	but of course we haven't get a binder any more and we don't we don't really have the printers any more
S0428	yeah i'm not sure that you would cope with india
S0470	be i allow to say negative
S0428	yeah that's fine
S0470	although i be be record here
S0470	yeah so so we use a range of specialist printers and binders
S0428	yeah
S0470	accord to whatever translation it be and what the edition call for
S0432	mm
S0428	ah so they so they get they're all translate here as well they be all they be all translate and you can just
S0470	erm well the king jam bible be translate here part of it but not in my time
S0428	oh yeah
S0470	obviously yeah no they they're project manage here by
S0428	mm hm
S0470	he's the production well bibles but business manager but he look after the specification and production
S0432	ah
S0470	so they get them make by people who can do that sort of work there's not very many people who do print on india paper these days
S0432	no
S0428	no i can imagine
S0470	and some of the work's do by hand it's it be very different from any other book the press do
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah i presume be it a lot more expensive to get all that do yeah
S0470	yes especially when they're bind in goat skin leather
S0432	oh wow
S0470	and if you print onto india paper it have to be do very slowly
S0432	mm
S0470	because the paper's thin
S0432	yeah
S0470	and sometimes you're print red and black at the same time so that
S0428	so
S0432	wow
S0470	have a cost implication
S0428	and how often
S0432	mm
S0428	like how many be print a year roughly or be that not something
S0470	oh that's classify information
S0428	no we don't want to know
S0470	yeah we we do ten different i can tell you we do ten different bible translations
S0432	yeah
S0428	mm hm wow
S0432	ten now that's good
S0470	altogether
S0432	yeah
S0470	but the king jam have be on the list since the seventeenth century so we've get most of that
S0428	yeah that's incredible isn't it to think it hasn't it hasn't be out of print in all that time
S0432	yeah
S0470	no well
S0428	that's amaze
S0432	that be amaze
S0470	have be continuously print and publish the bible since 1591 and it's it's a continuous run
S0432	almost from the begin yeah
S0470	yeah
S0428	that's incredible isn't it
S0432	yeah
S0470	in the begin
S0470	yeah cos we we do the geneva bible which be sort of a subversive bible at the time
S0428	mm hm
S0470	but that be our that be the first one
S0428	ah have you ever do a display in the museum of
S0470	there be there be a small display of bibles all the time
S0428	yeah cos i've see the one in the corner
S0432	mm
S0428	but like in the
S0470	in the
S0428	yeah
S0470	yeah
S0432	yeah the main the one in the big one in the the case
S0428	yeah in the that side round
S0432	yeah
S0470	yeah i think there's a geneva as well because there's a few in that case
S0428	yeah
S0432	mm
S0428	oh i will have to go and have another look
S0432	yeah
S0470	yeah perhaps we should get to do a
S0428	a talk on it
S0470	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0428	cos it be fascinate to think that that's be here the whole time and it be still here
S0432	yeah
S0428	i mean i dunno where we be
S0470	yeah
S0428	we don't really have any contact with like book or anything erm
S0470	oh well we've actually get bookshelves with all our editions on if you would like to pop by sometime
S0432	ah
S0428	oh i'd love to yeah love to see it
S0470	and you can see them and handle them and smell them
S0428	oh whereabouts do you sit
S0470	because they're fragrant erm it's probably the easiest way be gosh it's dark over there isn't it erm you go do you know where the humanities editors be
S0432	just
S0428	i my friend's a publish assistant for humanities i know where she sit like in the corner
S0432	so if you go
S0470	so
S0432	erm right down there and it's just on the leave
S0470	yeah
S0432	oh okay
S0428	okay we'll come and definitely come and see them
S0470	yeah that would be good
S0428	yeah you must be the only team print on that kind of paper here and i don't know be there other book that be do
S0432	i don't know
S0428	cos
S0432	i wouldn't have think so no
S0470	no you don't think of anybody else who print on india paper
S0428	i don't think
S0432	you could try
S0428	the elt wouldn't do that
S0470	no erm
S0432	no
S0470	we we do undertake production work for other publishers
S0428	yeah
S0470	of people who be produce bibles sometimes they want to do a special bind
S0432	yeah wow
S0470	which be unpredictable
S0428	yeah that's really nice though to be able to work with like those materials you know
S0432	yeah
S0470	yeah you feel a you feel there's a physical product which be not the same as everything else and it's not it be not all online
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	yeah
S0432	it's nice that it hasn't like follow all the other book that be just like glossy paper or
S0428	yeah
S0432	or online it be nice that it be still
S0428	and kind of the cheapest you can get them out
S0432	yeah
S0428	you know it be like still like a beautiful
S0432	yeah
S0428	although i erm er cos i've just study publish
S0470	mm
S0428	i do i do a master's and the the amount of book that be be produce be a beautiful quality now because people have get their kindle for their like soft paperbacks
S0432	yeah
S0428	that actually when people want to buy a book they want to buy a beautiful so beautiful book
S0432	yeah
S0428	so that kind of type of book be be actually like increase which be so lovely to see
S0470	i see that's interest
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	and overall sales of book aren't really go down in like in trade i don't know i'm sure like
S0432	mm
S0470	yeah so if you want if you want to if you want to pay as little as possible why would you have a physical product
S0428	yeah if it be the kind of book that you read and then you don't want it on your shelve it be like
S0470	yeah
S0432	mm
S0470	i think with the bible as well erm certainly most of our customers at least intend to read it regularly and many of them do a lot in the clergy
S0432	mm
S0470	and in the unite state
S0428	and i guess you
S0470	so they're use their bible several time a day
S0428	and it need to be
S0432	yes
S0428	really good condition like a really good solid book because if you be flick through it and read from it and touch it every day you need it to like be resilient and
S0432	yeah mm
S0470	yeah it's a work it's a work it be a work book
S0428	yeah
S0432	mm
S0428	but like one you dip in and out of so normally you would read a book in order but i know it's different if you kind of open it at different place you've get to protect the spine in a different way so i guess apparently
S0470	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0470	yeah but the book the book be sew the book be sew
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0470	as well as glue which give it a greater flexibility and the most luxurious ones have get full leather line
S0428	wow
S0432	wow
S0470	and they're edge line which again make it more flexible you can actually roll a bible up and it should be okay yeah
S0432	really
S0428	wow
S0470	i could hold any of my bibles up one page
S0428	and they'd be fine
S0470	mm
S0432	just
S0470	it hasn't fail yet
S0432	wow that be really good
S0470	i don't do it very often but sometimes when we give talk we we do that
S0432	just to test wow that's really good
S0428	oh you should do a talk in the in the library i want i want to know all about
S0428	yeah
S0470	erm i do talk a i do talk on the history of bible translation in and 's link
S0428	oh do you mm
S0432	mm
S0428	you'll have to tell us when the next one be
S0470	i could do that yeah
S0432	yeah
S0470	but but my colleague would be really the best person to talk to about the physical aspects of it because that's his specialism
S0428	yeah
S0432	mm ah
S0428	yeah a very specialist job
S0470	he will he will show you the bits of leather
S0428	yeah and the knowledge
S0470	mm maybe what maybe what we should do be advertise erm your erm your need to have different people talk within some of our church that we're in contact with actually that that work
S0432	yeah
S0470	can you do something like that sort of say after church today if you go to room go to this room
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0470	have a cake and talk
S0428	yeah
S0470	if people sign up for it
S0432	yeah
S0470	and make some money for the something that the church be do
S0432	yeah yeah cos
S0428	yeah so we the the church could have the eighteen pound per hour of the
S0470	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0470	because i be think because i be involve in the the refugee action group as well and i wonder if that be something that the press would encourage be use it as something whereby a group could raise fund
S0432	yeah we it there's
S0428	yeah definitely
S0470	or even the press could raise fund for that matter
S0432	there's nothing to like say who i mean it usually go to the lead contributor so if i be process all of this the money would go to me and then i
S0470	right
S0432	there's nothing to say that i have to keep it there's nothing to say that i have to give it out to everybody but it be there then to do
S0470	mm
S0428	yeah
S0432	like you could use it as fund
S0470	okay so if i say come come and talk for an hour
S0432	yeah
S0470	have a cup of tea and a cake and the money's go to i don't know if it be syria syria or wherever the church want it to go to
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	absolutely fine and anyone can set these group up like so erm we can give you some of these leaflets it just kind of show
S0470	yeah i haven't see i haven't get that one
S0428	erm
S0432	we kind of say a maximum of five speakers per group just cos it's
S0470	five
S0428	yeah but there's nothing to say you can kind of do two group or
S0470	two table
S0428	yeah
S0432	as long as the background noise isn't too much but i'm sure it would be fine
S0428	it be just
S0470	maybe i they have somebody else from the press who work in customer service perhaps i should try and get her on board and then she could
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0470	she could lead a table as well
S0428	yeah definitely
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	because the thing be when you have more than five people quite often erm what will happen be you'll have two conversations go on and that's really hard for the transcribers to to write down
S0432	mm cos people tend to like group off don't they and have little chat
S0470	they do and then you have to try and work out who it be
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah so here's yeah
S0470	yeah i find that you get men tend to branch off and have one conversation and women have another quite often as well it seem to work in in gender group within a larger group
S0428	mm
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	we'll have to look out for that in our larger
S0432	yeah look out we can do that
S0470	can you
S0432	kind of search yeah
S0470	i would be interest to know if that's true or whether it be just the people i know
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	yeah we can have a look into our larger record and see
S0432	mm apparently erm men do interrupt more than women
S0428	than women
S0432	if that be surprise to you i mean
S0470	that doesn't surprise that doesn't surprise me at all although my husband would refute it would contest it
S0432	yeah
S0428	i be talk this morning erm be tell us that erm there be this there be this thing about conversations between japanese and american people and in japan it's really rude to interrupt someone so you wait until someone's stop talk and then you talk whereas in america apparently it be like really uncomfortable and people just interject
S0432	to not to not yeah
S0428	and so
S0470	mm
S0428	erm he this person explain it a bite like erm japanese be more like bowl where the kind of the ball go and then it settle and then you start and erm
S0432	yeah
S0428	like america be more like throw the ball around but it's not allow to hit the grind
S0432	oh yeah
S0470	oh dear
S0432	that's a good way of
S0470	yeah
S0428	and that's a really good cultural
S0432	yeah a bite hard when they be talk together
S0428	yeah a pointless conversation
S0432	cos the american would just keep talk
S0470	well well you'd never the japanese would never get in would never get in would they
S0432	no
S0428	no
S0470	i mean you get people like that you know you think they're finish and then they start again
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0470	and it turn out to have be a semicolon rather than a full stop
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah cos i be on the phone last night to some erm americans well like five o'clock and i be just try to go cos i have i need to leave at i couldn't even say goodbye so i just have to leave and send them a note say because it be a group of like six people
S0432	yeah
S0428	and i be just like i'm so sorry but i can't i didn't want to interrupt this flow
S0470	oh dear
S0428	yeah and just talk and talk and talk
S0432	yeah yeah
S0470	yeah
S0428	but this leaflet erm kind of say erm
S0470	oh it's this be the bite that i'm not very good i'm not very confident on be what device to use to be honest
S0432	you can have you get a smartphone or have anyone
S0470	well i have but i be not i don't quite i don't really know how it how it work
S0432	it should they usually have a voice record er or you can
S0428	i mean you you be very welcome to borrow these so if cos these be so simple
S0470	be they better

S0470	yeah okay
S0428	know you be go to do it at the weekend just come like take them on friday and erm bring them back on monday would be fine
S0470	oh actually that would be that would be most reassure because i be not sure about this
S0428	yeah

S0428	and then you erm this isn't quite the there's like a record information sheet that's get it's basically this but just in smaller format

S0428	erm and then everyone need to sign one of those and then that's all you have to do
S0470	right
S0432	do you do you want to take some of these from us so you don't have to print any off
S0470	oh yes please because i could then leave it leave it somewhere

S0470	that's interest cos i could there would there would certainly be people of all age at a church
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah that's yeah if you yeah
S0470	but whether you'd get a three year old many three year olds wouldn't sit still and and talk would they
S0432	no they be kind of ones at the dinner table
S0470	oh i see yeah
S0428	yeah
S0432	but if you can get them then it be fine it doesn't matter
S0470	yeah okay
S0432	as long as obviously anyone under eighteen we have to get their parent to sign the form erm
S0470	yes right
S0428	but it's
S0432	yeah
S0470	but what's mostly so what be most useful scottish and welsh and northern ireland do you say
S0428	yeah i mean we've get a lot obviously it be much easier to get conversations from people when we meet them so from we've get a lot and we be do the project with so there's lot there and actually north south we be do quite well england's quite well cover erm nineteen to twenty nine we've get load that's our big
S0428	like the age group
S0470	yeah
S0428	because it's students that see eighteen pound and it's like
S0470	money
S0470	well most people do when i mention it to them but actually get them to to do it be more tricky
S0428	yeah to do it yeah
S0432	yeah that's and it's the first one as well which be the most tricky as soon as you've do one you know how easy it be you can carry on
S0428	yeah
S0432	erm it's just always the first one that seem to have a bite of trouble
S0428	yeah seem to be but
S0470	okay
S0428	like and we'll like i don't know when obviously as we get closer to ten million then we'll be less interest in people from and more interest in people from from other areas so especially
S0432	yeah
S0470	yeah yes i suppose we know people in don't we
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0432	but at the but any anyone that anyone that's will to
S0428	yeah to to contribute
S0470	and do it have to be just a normal chat or could it be something like a meet
S0428	it can be i mean it be suppose to be like kind of everyday conversation so
S0470	right so
S0428	erm i mean it could be a meet er but like not a very stag one because there be a box for colleagues here
S0432	mm if people
S0428	and acquaintances
S0470	ah i see yeah
S0432	yeah and then these be kind like the type of speech so if you're discuss something or you're
S0470	oh
S0432	you're there try to i don't know make arrangements or something
S0470	make arrangements
S0432	it's fine
S0470	yeah
S0432	as long as there's not kind of one person that's do all the talk and everybody's join in and
S0470	monopolise yeah okay i'll erm i'll have another go at try to persuade some people to
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah but that's a great that's a great idea to do it with the church lot and
S0470	yeah give it a try give it a try
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0470	be there any subject that be off limit
S0428	no everything
S0432	nope absolutely everything
S0470	right
S0432	yeah and we anonymise it
S0470	oh well i i shouldn't imagine they'd talk about anything inappropriate but
S0432	no that's fine
S0428	a lot of people do
S0470	like talk about their medical condition or something people do
S0432	oh no that's fine if they want to talk about that
S0428	yeah and it be all anonymised so we take everyone's name and everyone's erm like big place so we wouldn't take london out because that's not you know
S0470	right you be not likely to know
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0428	but erm
S0432	but if someone say something like i don't know i live in maybe we would take that out
S0428	yeah i live in place
S0432	yeah we would we would take that out
S0470	yes
S0428	yeah
S0432	unless they're talk about as a general in there be a lot of shop or something like that then we wouldn't
S0470	yes right
S0428	and if you're interest we can show the database where we put it all into and how we use it because we we never we just read a transcript we'd search for a word and see where that come up so then you only look at kind of like five word before it and five word after it we never we never look at the conversations as a whole really
S0432	mm no
S0470	right
S0428	i mean some researchers might
S0432	we just put all of the transcriptions from all the record into one
S0470	mm
S0428	pot
S0432	pot so and then look at all of that language in that rather than individual
S0428	yeah and then we dice it up
S0470	i see
S0428	so we'd say okay we we really into we be write this elt textbook for you know teenagers so let's look at this age to this age erm and we want the we want british english not so then we would want it all across the uk we don't just want everyone to learn english and then you can make sure that
S0470	mm
S0432	you can search by age or region or
S0470	ah
S0428	gender anything
S0432	yeah
S0470	i seem to have quite a few friends whose first language be not english or who come from other countries but i guess that's probably a thing anyway isn't it
S0428	yeah
S0470	so
S0432	mm yeah
S0470	they be quite vary because i've get a i've get one friend who speak english as her first language but she's indian so she
S0428	yeah yeah
S0470	have a particular sort of pronunciation and i've get another friend who be serbian who speak english as a second language
S0428	yeah and we've get quite a few people from it's like it's obviously quite difficult thing like the british national corpus because you know what make you a native or make a non native what make you an expert user what make you a learner it's it's very quite hard to cut these things up and say well you weren't bear here so you can't contribute it it it feel wrong
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	so we do have you know it's a kind of it's a little it's like a grey area cos we don't want to be kind of say well you know you move here when you be ten but that doesn't you can't call it cos obviously they're british and
S0432	yeah yeah and if they're use it every day and
S0470	yes that's true
S0428	as an expert user then it be kind of go to go in the project
S0432	yeah yeah
S0470	yeah mm okay well i'll take take this away do i need more
S0432	there's a field there's a field here anyway that talk about mother about mother tongue and yeah nationality so that's fine we can
