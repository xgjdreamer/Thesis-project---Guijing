S0653	oh right
S0655	it be a joke at the end
S0653	fair enough
S0654	a joke at the end
S0653	fair enough
S0654	yeah
S0653	fair enough
S0654	you have no idea why that happen
S0653	okay so be you eat your cucumber very good what's it get inside it that we learn
S0654	carotinin
S0653	carotinin
S0655	carotinin
S0653	tell tell what it be again
S0655	it be
S0653	or what it do
S0655	things
S0654	that make your face
S0653	no
S0654	more yellow
S0653	no i do not ask you do i that's very naughty can you explain it please
S0655	it have carotinin be things inside fruit and vegetables
S0653	uhu
S0655	that make your face brighter and apparently more attractive
S0653	well they'd
S0654	mm
S0653	make it a little bite yellow
S0654	oh
S0655	no not as in
S0654	i be gonna say that
S0655	not as in yellow disease
S0653	not as in bright yellow but as you say it make we think that if we see someone with slightly yellow skin and that it look erm
S0655	brighter
S0653	healthy
S0654	mm
S0653	not brighter but healthy
S0653	which be actually correct isn't it because if you're eat high level of fruit and vegetables like the red yellow orange and green ones then you be healthy but we but when we saw that on the programme the people do look healthier didn't they
S0655	yeah
S0654	mm
S0653	the yellower picture
S0654	but mum
S0653	mm
S0654	carrots erm can be white or purple
S0653	they can
S0654	so eat a purple carrot wouldn't make you healthier would it
S0653	that well it would it be healthy
S0655	it would
S0653	i be not sure how much
S0654	but it wouldn't make your face more yellower
S0653	i don't know how
S0655	it might
S0653	the level of the vary do you know why carrots be orange now
S0654	cos they're er cos they're more riper
S0653	no
S0654	why
S0653	well you use to get carrots in all different type of colour and then when william of orange come over to rule this country he bring the orange carrot with him
S0654	so he paint an a carrot orange
S0653	no no they would there be a type of of carrot that be orange but there as you say there be also purple ones and all sort of different colour but he bring that one over and
S0654	but the
S0653	make sure that that be the one that sort of take hold so that's why we have
S0654	but
S0653	orange carrots
S0654	the most erm the ones which be like here now be the red no the orange the purple and the white
S0653	have you ever see a purple or white carrot
S0654	yep
S0653	when
S0653	in er mr bloom's
S0653	yeah but you don't when have you see them in the supermarket never
S0654	well
S0653	you can get
S0654	mr bloom grow em that mean he have
S0653	you can get seed in a in a garden centre that you can do purple carrots there
S0655	oh i make up a song
S0653	but i've never see ones in supermarkets
S0655	we will never never see purple carrots ever
S0653	so i have never eat a purple carrot i don't know what they taste like i don't know if they taste different
S0655	smell them and you'll know what they'll taste like
S0653	mm so what be our favourite thing or things from see the programme the colour of science
S0655	i do
S0654	the ultraviolet
S0653	see the ultraviolet light and as i say i use to have lipstick that be uv sensitive so if i wear it in the daytime you wouldn't be able to see it and when er i go to nightclubs which i still do obviously then
S0653	there's a particular type of light that they have which light up your anything white like t shirt it also make that you can get your face light up in fact there's definitely some pop videos that have get people wear uv sensitive things er rihanna i think erm so what be your favourite bite out of see the the two program
S0655	mm i do like that be it the
S0653	be it the bird of paradise
S0655	oh yeah the bird of paradise i
S0653	that be hilarious
S0655	no the great bird of the
S0653	the great bird of paradise the way it puff and look like a
S0655	a face
S0653	an oval face
S0653	it's mental
S0655	because the be actually his eye
S0653	i know but it look so un birdlike doesn't it i couldn't believe
S0654	yeah
S0653	that be a real bird that be
S0655	yeah
S0653	hilarious yeah that be brilliant
S0655	you think it be erm just something set up by them
S0653	i just i could see that it have birdlike feet behind it but i just couldn't believe that it be an actual bird because bird don't look like that do they just bizarre
S0654	remember the one that be go look at my wing look at my wing

S0653	it be but what about though the the dress that be black and blue but look white and gold
S0654	yeah
S0655	that be just weird
S0653	it be weird isn't it but what be so weird be that you could be in the same room with somebody and they would see it differently that's what's weird about it like but we all saw white and gold didn't we but if someone else have be sit with us they would have perhaps see the black and blue just weird isn't it cos white and gold be so different from black and blue they're not similar be they
S0655	well white and black be similar
S0653	white and black be not similar in any any sense be they
S0655	well they're not
S0653	they're totally opposite
S0655	they're not colour
S0653	yes we know they're not technically colour so what be they
S0655	they
S0653	one be an absence of colour really and the white be all of them mix together isn't it
