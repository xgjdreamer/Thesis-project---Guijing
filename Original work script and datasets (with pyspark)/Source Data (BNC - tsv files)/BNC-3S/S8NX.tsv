S0314	erm but it be interest the first year i be there i go on a two year contract and i teach in which make the and look like chelsea
S0269	yeah yeah
S0314	because we be under curfews it be the erm nineteen seventy five six elections and it be er curfews at certain time in the day and my school be in the middle of the so that be an experience
S0269	mm
S0314	and we use to i live behind burglar bar for two years there be burglar bar on the school and we be lock in
S0314	and let out you know it be er er yeah it be fascinate and i remember sit in the staff room with this lovely chap call mr he be a really really nice chap and erm there be only us two in the staff room the door be always open cos everything be always open cos of the heat and we hear this clip clop clip clop clip clop and along the corridor and past the staffroom door come a mummy goat and three little kid

S0269	yeah
S0314	and that be a different experience altogether
S0269	yeah so why do you then decide to come back
S0314	well my contract run out and i get what i call islanditus i'd meet everybody and do everything and be right round the island and and you get it's it's a fantastic place erm there be a bite of tension there politically and
S0269	mm

S0269	no
S0314	police and things and erm er a lot of well poverty but not poverty that when when you've get poverty in in a place which be very beautiful and and you've get avocados and grapefruit

S0269	mm
S0314	and they they import all the american cop show and he say that you know if if there be a cagney and lacey type thing on a monday there be copycat crimes
S0269	mm
S0314	all over the island people do exactly
S0314	what they'd see on the telly you know and
S0269	oh dear
S0314	and it it be a pretty volatile place but nothing like today because today's far worse apparently

S0314	i would go back but i would only go back i wouldn't go back with anybody who have never be i would go back with my friend who be there at the same time as me
S0269	mm
S0314	and have her there because we kind of we understand it then and we can kind of see how it be now
S0269	yeah

S0269	right
S0314	and that be erm obviously with all the mine kid
S0269	and that's
S0314	just before the miners' strike
S0269	yeah that's when you get catch up with the miners' strike
S0314	yeah
S0269	yeah
S0314	yeah
S0269	the eighty odd miners' strike
S0314	yeah and
S0314	the nineteen ninety four
S0314	i remember i go see my friend in and erm i i the only deal i'd ever have with the police be all friendly you know a copper be friendly

S0269	that's right
S0314	yeah and i be come home from drive along the
S0269	mm
S0314	and i get there be some carry on during whatever and they be look for fly picket i think

S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	and they weren't appreciate me go hello

S0269	mm
S0314	because that's what you do and they be so foul
S0269	mm
S0314	yeah
S0269	oh eh there be a lot of nastiness go on in miners' strike
S0314	yeah yeah and the government be behind erm my husband be just read a book about it which be erm
S0269	your husband be what
S0314	he's read a book all about the miners' strike and what happen behind the scenes and all these paper that have be release and it it tell you exactly
S0269	mm
S0314	how the thatcher government and the power that be erm set a lot of people up and give them a lot of bad publicity it be all there
S0269	oh yeah
S0314	you know it be all true
S0269	oh that's right
S0314	which be a sham really
S0269	well we get tangle up in it down at the smelt work
S0314	right
S0269	because of course we erm if you be make zinc you need a lot of coke
S0314	yeah
S0269	er and if you be use a lot of coke you need a lot of coal and we be up on a quarter of million tons of coal a year and you weren't allow to import it
S0314	mm
S0269	erm and in fact it be that put a gun to the thatcher government's head that either we be allow to import coal at a quarter of the price
S0314	yeah
S0269	or we be go to shut the place down erm as simple as that because we just couldn't compete
S0314	no
S0269	so we be allow to import coal
S0314	oh
S0269	erm and we pay at to coke it for us
S0314	oh yeah
S0269	and they bring it up on the train into a merry go round train four hundred ton a day
S0314	yeah
S0269	er and then in the miners' strike the train drivers refuse to drive our train so we get a haulage contractor to and we end up erm with a load of lorries come up the m4 with their windscreens smash in
S0314	yeah
S0269	with the miners' picket so the haulier er and this be where the downfall of the num start and our name be on the high court writ erm that the haulier take them take the num to court
S0314	oh i see
S0269	and that's where the sequestration of the assets start
S0314	oh i see
S0269	so oh gawd blimey we have a we have a right do with the miners down there and we have the fly picket down from outside the smelt work
S0314	and that be before mobile phone imagine what it would have be like if we'd get mobile phone
S0269	that's right
S0314	as well yeah
S0269	but what go on in the villages and that i mean er it be terrible because of the intimidation wouldn't wouldn't have a vote
S0314	mm yeah
S0269	but it be ironic because that he i train at colliery where he get arrest
S0314	oh
S0269	down here at work there
S0314	yeah
S0269	that be the first time i basically it be the nearest i get to understand er childhood because she have a pony you see

S0269	she be so privilege upbringing the only pony i ever have be at colliery
S0314	the pit ponies use to go on holiday behind my nan's
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	and when we use to go and visit her because she live actually it be the bypass now it be at
S0269	yeah
S0314	and she have a house there and she use to see the pit ponies that be an amaze landscape because i think there be a bite of open cast mine there as well
S0269	yeah there be
S0314	and it be all rise bay willow herb
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	and it be all ever so quiet because there weren't no motorways dash about
S0269	that's right
S0314	and the bypass wasn't there it be just all field
S0269	that's right
S0314	and you could just now and again hear like a hammer in the steel work
S0269	aye
S0314	you know like everything would look
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	really quiet and still
S0269	yeah
S0314	and then suddenly you would hear a great big crash and it be come from yeah
S0269	yeah oh yeah there be quite a bite of open cast then mine
S0314	yeah

S0314	mm
S0269	yeah huh god and my father work in the steel work at
S0314	yeah
S0269	he be er he work he work there from the time we go to until er until he retire

S0314	oh
S0269	which be er not very good
S0314	no
S0269	but mm but you say your mother and girls high well my father well he it wasn't even worse for him he pass he pass er to go to secondary school and his mother couldn't afford to let me go
S0314	mm
S0269	so he leave school at thirteen
S0314	yeah
S0269	and then spend most of his life be pretty frustrate because
S0314	well my mum leave school at thirteen because it be the law and at say they be go to try and make class in people's house and it never seem to get off the grind but they close the school for a few months and then she get herself a job and at fourteen she she be work by then
S0269	mm
S0314	and so she never go back
S0269	mm
S0314	which be a shame
S0269	but yeah me go to be a real eye opener because i'd never i saw a side of life that
S0314	go there didn't he
S0269	no he go to
S0269	yeah i think you will find he go to
S0314	oh i think it be
S0269	i will check it when i get home
S0314	yeah
S0269	but of course the the year that i be there erm be quite incredible the that's the best year that they ever have for oxford and cambridge and that and i mean that i be in the class with end up as nato ambassadors and ambassador to turkey
S0314	mm
S0269	erm professor of astrophysics and all this sort of thing well blimey there be some real bright cookies there i mean i be well down the peck order go there
S0314	so how do how do you be you able to keep up i mean be you okay there
S0269	i wasn't to start with
S0314	a bite of a shock
S0269	well because in term of erm you know maths and english and that i mean the standard at at
S0314	no
S0269	be not quite what it be at and
S0314	no
S0269	and all that sort of thing
S0314	yeah
S0269	so i didn't know what they be on about when
S0314	yeah yeah
S0269	i go into latin class it be alright for you english teacher but i didn't understand what the subject be and an object and a past participle
S0314	didn't you
S0269	no so latin i struggle i drop that after two years
S0314	mm
S0269	no so i couldn't cope with that but on the science side of course i be
S0266	be that when you go to secondary school from primary
S0269	yeah
S0314	you be talk about
S0269	my first two years in grammar school
S0266	but didn't you start latin from the first year of secondary school
S0269	yeah and i do it for two years and then drop it
S0266	why because the others do they have a head start on you
S0269	well because they understand about english grammar
S0266	why because
S0269	well because they have be teach it in primary school whereas at at
S0314	but at you you would probably have be speak with erm not necessarily grammatically correctly you would have be
S0269	that's right
S0314	hear sentence which weren't grammatically correct
S0269	that's right
S0314	all the time constantly
S0269	yeah absolutely
S0314	weren't you
S0269	yeah
S0314	and i think that one of the main barriers
S0269	yeah
S0314	that that that would be a problem
S0269	that's right
S0314	yeah
S0269	and the only thing that carry me through be because er when it come to the sciences and then come to sport of course i be way in front of
S0314	yeah because you didn't yeah
S0269	i be way in front of most of them
S0314	yeah
S0269	at
S0314	yeah
S0269	but on on the art side and the english
S0314	yeah yeah
S0269	oh god oh dear
S0314	i be with my cousin at the weekend at my dad's do and erm he still live over the east end erm he grow up on oh what be it a huge council estate on the other side as you be go towards the it's over that way
S0269	oh erm
S0314	er it begin with
S0314	no no not
S0314	near off road
S0269	mm
S0314	and he ask two lads
S0314	yeah i be sure they be bright but they don't speak grammatically correctly
S0269	no that's right
S0314	because they haven't be bring
S0269	no that's right
S0314	with people who do
S0269	that's right
S0314	and and you know their playmates be all speak
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	that you know
S0269	and i have the same problem
S0314	yeah
S0269	when i go to
S0314	yeah
S0269	but what carry me through be because of my maths and my sciences and the sport
S0314	yeah
S0269	erm but on the art side cor blimey
S0314	mm
S0269	i be nowhere
S0314	yeah
S0269	but erm but you know as i go on of course i do maths physics and chemistry and i do them a year early you see
S0314	yeah
S0269	and i didn't have the confidence i didn't think i would pass so i didn't bother apply for university so i get my i get my three a level and then stay on another year and get another two
S0314	oh excellent
S0269	so er and then off i toddle to university
S0314	to
S0269	yeah so i get my three maths a level and my physics and my chemistry
S0314	good
S0269	and that be that be it and then off i go to
S0314	so would you be in favour of bring grammar school back
S0269	i would yes for the simple reason that if they hadn't be there i would have be stick at
S0314	exactly and that's what i feel as well
S0269	yeah
S0314	because if they hadn't be there my parent wouldn't have
S0269	no that's right
S0314	really have you know
S0269	so i'm all
S0314	fulfil their potential i mean my mother never do because hers be cut short
S0269	yeah
S0314	my dad probably do but she didn't
S0269	no
S0314	and erm
S0269	so yeah i would be all in favour of it because i
S0314	yeah
S0269	i see what it give me otherwise i would have be stick secondary school
S0314	yeah
S0269	erm with bunch of kid in the class who didn't want to learn anyway
S0314	and not only that i think that my husband and a friend of mine erm they both erm fail exams and test to stay with their mat and that's that's another thing that you get when you've get a bright kid
S0269	yeah well that's right
S0314	in in amongst everybody else
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	and erm it it must have happen time and time again
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	but they both admit to to fail to stay in the class with their mat
S0266	what deliberately
S0314	deliberately
S0269	yeah that's right
S0266	where do they do that
S0314	why
S0266	where
S0314	go to ooh somewhere over erm or or somewhere and he be at
S0269	right
S0314	you know a really rough area and he end up he end up on piper alpha decide whether to drill or not whether it be safe at the height of the oil boom
S0269	mm
S0314	fortunately before it blow up
S0269	before it blow up
S0314	yeah but er
S0269	but yeah i i know erm i've often think about that as to where i would be
S0314	yeah where would you be
S0269	if if i hadn't get out of that
S0314	and
S0269	and go to a grammar school
S0314	there's a fabulous programme i've see it twice i think and michael portillo go to that grammar school and edwina curry go to the grammar school
S0269	that's right
S0314	and then they interview load of other people and they all say you know they go into this world and it be like come from terrace house into this palatial place and they be able to really fulfil their potential
S0269	that's right
S0314	and i think that's what we've get lose in the
S0269	that's right i be certain of it
S0314	comprehensive system because if you be in a comprehensive system and you be a bright person you can choose which
S0269	that's right
S0314	where where your performance level
S0269	that's right
S0314	be go to be to stay with your mat
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	and i bet that's happen time and time again
S0269	i bet it do yeah that's right
S0314	well i mean my husband and also our for both of them to admit that that's what they do
S0269	well i be very lucky with my two kid because they they go to a comprehensive school the other side of in but there be a headmaster there who be a real driver who understand this sort of thing that you've just be talk about now
S0314	yeah yeah
S0269	er and they be really push by dr y
S0314	yeah yeah
S0269	down at because the first year that our be at comprehensive school he get us in and he say you've get a real bright cookie here and she'll she'll go far
S0314	mm
S0269	and it be a toss up whether she go to vet school or whether she go to school of music
S0314	mm
S0269	because she do piano and violin
S0314	mm
S0269	and everything and he say you've get a real gem here but you've get to push her along so we do
S0314	mm so you've get to think how many people like your dad who be obviously a clever bloke
S0269	yeah
S0314	have just be completely
S0269	that's right
S0314	just just just they've all they've all they haven't have those opportunities
S0269	that's right
S0314	have they
S0269	and and if you don't we've always think that if you don't if kid don't fulfil their potential they don't have a satisfy a life as if they do
S0314	no and what's more they will find satisfaction and possibly not in the right way
S0269	yeah that's right
S0314	i mean you meet a lot of bright in prison don't you
S0266	mm
S0269	oh aye
S0314	yeah
S0269	so yeah give me a grammar school every time
S0314	i know
S0269	because look what it's do to me
S0314	yeah exactly and what it do for my parent
S0269	mm
S0314	and you know if i have go let's say i have go to a comp i would have be the first to have be think i be stay in the third lot there because that's where my mat
S0269	that's right
S0314	i would have do that i can see myself do it
S0269	yeah i would
S0314	hide my light under a bushel because i i go to school i go to grammar school and i get in the top form i don't know how because i be i be always the class clown and i be always draw attention i would do anything for a laugh anything
S0269	yeah
S0314	and and i suppose i be just lucky really because if if i have some good mat in the top class so i didn't have to move myself down i be quite comfortable in there they be alright that lot but it they hadn't have be
S0269	mm
S0314	you know you you can decide to move yourself out can't you

S0269	mm
S0314	the the academic prowess of those lads and he be bumble along in the bottom line
