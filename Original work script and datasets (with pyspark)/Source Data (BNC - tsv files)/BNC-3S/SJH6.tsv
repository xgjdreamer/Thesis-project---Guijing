S0012	yeah they be take
S0370	i've get some deutschmarks
S0012	have you
S0370	i think dad must have buy them back
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah they be reckon they be take to the bank in or take
S0370	in bag
S0012	money in
S0370	yeah yeah
S0012	yeah
S0370	oh no when change if he change ten dollars he get a wodge like that back
S0012	christ
S0370	you know a whole wodge of money
S0013	right
S0012	but it also happen in er italy where they have to
S0370	oh the lira yeah
S0012	they have to put the lira up to twenty thousand thirty thousand forty thousand a hundred thousand didn't they
S0370	mm
S0012	and then
S0370	yeah
S0012	recently one
S0370	well what yeah well so what they do in peru
S0012	and knock noughts off
S0370	they erm er they have intis be the currency and then they change to sols
S0370	right so i think it be ten thousand intis to a sol in order to make it manageable again
S0012	yeah yeah
S0370	and then they change from sols back to intis and do another ten thousand or something
S0012	wow
S0370	cos you have to somehow have you know adjust
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah
S0013	oh it's weird isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	weird to get your head round really
S0012	i think the weirdest thing be governments how they can print money when they feel like it and and cause inflation when they feel like cause deflation when they feel like it and no no one can do anything about it
S0013	but there's always
S0370	well they don't like it
S0013	cut think not
S0370	when you devalue they other countries don't like it
S0012	that's right
S0370	cos if you owe countries money
S0012	yeah
S0370	and you devalue
S0013	mm
S0370	it mean how much you have to pay them back
S0012	yeah
S0370	be less then
S0012	but it's they still do it don't they
S0370	cos greek greece wouldn't have a problem if it wasn't in the euro greece would have devalue
S0012	yeah yeah
S0370	age ago erm bite the bullet people would have you know their credit value would have go down as a country
S0012	yeah
S0370	for a while fine and they'd have be alright
S0012	they'd have be fine
S0370	and then everybody would be be go on holiday to greece
S0013	mm
S0370	cos it's
S0012	yeah
S0370	a bite cheaper
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0370	whereas they don't go on holiday to greece cos it's not cheaper
S0012	no no
S0370	with euros
S0013	mm
S0012	but er argentina they just say tough we're not pay anyone
S0370	they default
S0012	and they default didn't they
S0370	mm mm
S0012	and they're okay now aren't they
S0370	mm
S0012	they're okay now
S0370	well the greeks have sort of default cos it it be renegotiate wasn't it
S0012	yes it be yes
S0370	and er okay they owe you this amount with the interest but we're go to accept half of that now
S0012	yeah but that angela merton be it be it
S0370	merkel
S0012	merkel she's she's she's like she's like margaret thatcher be be
S0370	no i think she's much better
S0013	mm she's well respect isn't she really
S0012	yeah but she's a hard woman
S0013	mm
S0012	a very hard woman
S0013	yeah
S0012	she would let er not callaghan our prime minister whatever he's call now she wouldn't let him get away with anything would she he be he want to what be it he he want nine hundred million off of them all for be pay back
S0370	well it's a but the problem be we do put a lot more in
S0012	yeah we do
S0370	to the european union but then we're we're a rich country
S0012	yeah
S0370	so we don't turn round to the north west and say look you're not put as much in so we're
S0012	no no
S0370	you know
S0013	no
S0370	it doesn't work like that if you're belong to the european community
S0012	that's right yeah
S0370	then the
S0012	that's right
S0370	the the affluent countries should be put the money in
S0012	yeah
S0370	you know and we've allow more poorer countries to join
S0012	to join up yes
S0370	who won't be contribute
S0013	right
S0370	so we would expect to be put in more than we get out
S0012	yeah
S0370	and it's
S0013	mm
S0370	you know that's the way it be
S0012	we do get a lot more out of it at one time
S0370	and then if we go really downhill we would expect to get out more than we put in
S0012	than we put in and we do we do get out more than we put in at one time i think it be when thatcher be in government when everything be fail
S0370	no no we be still gross contributors but the amount we contribute over the average be reduce
S0012	i think she get a lot of money back out of them
S0370	not on balance no
S0012	no
S0370	we pay less in
S0012	oh oh then that's the way they they paint it then
S0370	yeah
S0012	they paint that the
S0370	she get a rebate on what we pay in so we're pay in a hundred and she get ten percent off
S0012	yeah and we get we get a hundred million rebate or something stupid
S0370	mm
S0012	yeah
S0370	mm
S0012	yeah but you don't get tell that sort of thing
S0370	you don't package it like that way no
S0012	no
S0370	no
S0013	mm
S0012	so everyone vote and say brilliant
S0370	but it have to be like that doesn't it
S0012	it do yeah
S0013	yeah
S0370	you know
S0013	mm
S0012	but er who be they they be say that er the barter system we we might we might all be better off if we go back to the barter system where in in er be it korea or north korea
S0370	yeah but you won't have any money to build new roads
S0012	no you wouldn't have any money
S0370	or
S0012	no
S0370	develop a
S0012	no
S0370	new airport or
S0013	but that only
S0012	well this
S0013	that only
S0012	this be
S0013	work to a certain extent doesn't it
S0012	well of course it do yeah
S0013	because
S0012	this be this one
S0013	if you've get nothing to
S0012	one like
S0013	to exchange you can't
S0012	this be one mad
S0370	well no but if
S0013	you'd have to do it by
S0370	you're just do it by barter
S0013	yeah
S0370	you aren't contribute to the
S0012	the whole
S0370	the whole of the country's economy
S0012	yeah yeah
S0370	and therefore you might
S0013	mm
S0370	be okay
S0013	yeah
S0370	erm but other people will have to pay more for the roads and the railway and
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0370	and everything and you will be live off what they pay
S0012	yeah
S0370	you know so
S0012	well that's like like everything else i mean if for instance we have egg and we want to barter and someone else have egg they're not gonna barter with you be they
S0370	no
S0013	no
S0370	no
S0013	no
S0370	but
S0012	that's the only thing
S0370	but barter be at at its peak wasn't it during the second world war
S0012	yeah it be yeah
S0370	so
S0012	yeah
S0370	you know in the agricultural community you be fine
S0012	yeah
S0370	comparatively
S0012	yeah
S0370	because you simply barter i've get a few hens so i'll give you some of my egg
S0012	that's it
S0370	and you'll give me a bag of
S0012	flour or something
S0370	flour
S0012	yeah
S0370	or whatever
S0012	yeah
S0370	and it be always plenty of food hide away somewhere or other
S0012	it be always
S0370	yeah
S0012	food especially
S0013	right
S0012	out in the countryside
S0370	yeah
S0012	what with pig and chickens to slaughter
S0370	that's right
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah where i mean my dad's best story be during during the war when they keep pig
S0013	i'm just gonna get a tissue
S0012	he keep a pig up the garden
S0370	mm
S0012	or we keep a pig up the garden i remember pig keep after the war as well but they keep a pig up the garden and the er ministry have to have half that pig they have half the pig
S0370	oh right
S0012	as as a payment you see
S0370	they didn't have to pay for the pig
S0012	no they take half
S0370	they just take it
S0012	they take half
S0370	mm
S0012	so everybody who have a pig use that have to be inspect by the ministry meantime they know when the ministry be come down they take the pig off and and leave them in the woods
S0370	yeah
S0012	cos
S0370	mm why not
S0012	and nobody have pig then or one person or two people down there have
S0370	mm
S0012	have a pig and everybody sort of could join it like that's the black market you know
S0370	mm
S0012	the black market
S0370	fair enough
S0012	yeah
S0370	give away half of it be fairly punitive isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0370	so if you've maybe
S0012	and then
S0370	scrimp and save to fee the thing
S0012	then my dad
S0370	cos i'd understand if they pay you for it but see as you
S0012	yeah
S0370	have to give up half
S0012	no they they just take it yeah and then my dad he use to be a butcher anyway and this be just after the war when they come home the they be still on ration everything be still on ration right up until i think the last come off at fifty three i don't know whether meat come off a little earlier but dad use to be the butcher for people who keep their own
S0370	mm
S0012	things and then he use to make sausages as well and we use to sell i remember sell sausages for two and eleven which be quite a lot of money
S0370	mm
S0012	i use to go round sell sausages and me and my brother go round sell sausages for two and eleven i remember that and and people would
S0370	without a voucher
S0012	without a voucher yeah without any anything
S0370	cos it be the one animal a butcher could kill wasn't it
S0012	yeah
S0370	pig
S0012	a pig yeah and slaughter all by themselves they didn't need any well they use to kill them with a sledgehammer damp them on the head with the sledgehammer and immediately pull them up with the hook
S0370	mm
S0012	and slit the throat to
S0370	yeah
S0012	because it
S0370	mm
S0012	well it weren't they weren't dead by the sledgehammer they use to knock them out you know which be pretty grim but that's what people do
S0370	it's
S0012	well it's the people in the country do
S0370	it's the same today isn't it
S0012	yeah it be yeah yeah yeah they when we take our oh it be awful we take our little kid you know the
S0370	mm
S0012	to the to the slaughterhouse down the road and er they get these like electrical things and they bang it across their head and clunk they're down there right but sometimes they miss
S0370	mm
S0012	and and and the poor little er
S0370	they must do though mustn't they
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah
S0012	that be quite awful

S0370	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	but them we live off them so there you go
S0013	well we get use just use to call that the
S0370	they only pay you a fiver for them
S0013	the what you call it

S0013	mm five pound we didn't mind you know five pound fine
S0012	yeah
S0013	but
S0012	but they want five pound for about ten of them and i say well and i stop the auction whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i say you're not do that i'm take them back i'm
S0013	mm
S0012	i round them up and bring them home
S0013	yeah
S0370	oh right

S0012	yeah
S0370	mm
S0013	yeah
S0370	but that's what an auction be though isn't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	it be but i mean

S0012	when when you
S0013	you see them you see them go
S0370	unless you put a reserve on
S0013	you know
S0012	you you get a
S0013	we get together
S0012	a cartel together at an auction and they decide who's go to buy
S0013	yeah
S0012	at what price

S0012	you bid and we'll split and we'll split the whole lot up
S0013	mm
S0012	and i stop the auction and say i'll take them home

S0013	mm
S0370	fridge
S0013	mm
S0370	pot them up they'll be up in no time
S0013	yeah
S0370	but they get the root in you see before the winter and then
S0013	yeah
S0370	as soon as it they they they i mean they're grow in the greenhouse without any heat they they have in there
S0013	right ah oh
S0370	but i haven't water them and i haven't put them in yeah and i'll need to sort this erm vine weed or
S0013	oh terrible
S0012	oh yeah vine weed yeah that's terrible that
S0370	yeah i've get it in the greenhouse so i'm
S0013	right
S0370	get to get it so i'm go i be go to water all with this killer
S0013	mm yeah
S0370	yeah but it may be too cold now cos if they're not eat
S0013	mm
S0370	it won't kill it'll only kill them if they eat the plant
S0013	yeah
S0370	but i'm only do it on the flower part so not the
S0013	oh i spend age do all those the tubers stick out
S0370	yeah but you won't get them all out
S0013	bury in the deep aren't they
S0370	yeah yeah they do like tubers
S0013	well they're all indoors now so
S0370	yeah
S0013	my tubers
S0370	but they'll still be active probably if it's warm
S0013	you reckon
S0370	this'll be much
S0013	yeah yeah oh the these bits though that i when i do the tuber bits the two bits i should have do it earlier really but you know
S0370	be you
S0013	those bits that be in water
S0370	yeah
S0013	that one it's definitely
S0370	oh there we be
S0013	that one's definitely there and this one still look healthy
S0370	it be
S0013	so if i'd have do it earlier in the year i think i'd have get some good stuff so
S0370	yeah never think of do cuttings from begonias really but
S0013	well unless
S0370	they're nice fleshy things i should think in water they probably do live quite well yeah
S0013	i hear that you you can only do it from well yes it's the case isn't it if they flower you can't can't take cuttings from that can you in general
S0370	well it's the same with all plant
S0013	mm
S0370	really they don't tend to root as well when they're in flower
S0013	well they be all see i look at them and then i think well they're all every bite isn't be flower erm
S0370	well it's just the chemicals in the plant
S0013	yeah
S0370	that promote the flower
S0013	so it be difficult to get
S0370	don't promote the root
S0013	yeah mm
S0370	yeah
S0013	mm guess whatever it be
S0370	i use i they don't do it anymore
S0013	that that's
S0370	from wilko
S0013	that's strange cos oh
S0370	that's the one they give you
S0013	no leaf and there's there's two like there's more bud come in here
S0370	oh right oh good
S0013	the
S0370	yeah erm wilko have this erm these packets of of fungus in clay
S0013	right
S0370	and you sprinkle the pellets micro micro something something something erm
S0013	yeah
S0370	what what it do it it it it's symbiotic with plant root
S0013	mm
S0370	so
S0012	oh
S0370	the fungus grow on the plant root
S0013	right
S0370	alright it use the plant root as its base
S0013	right
S0370	but at the same time it digest food out of the soil for the plant
S0012	oh right that's yeah
S0370	so it it it make your plant much healthier and they
S0013	really
S0370	they develop a more extensive root system
S0013	oh be it
