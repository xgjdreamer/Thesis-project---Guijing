S0012	don't you think she
S0152	no
S0012	can see it
S0152	no i don't think
S0012	well no because that's the environment they live in isn't it that's true
S0152	yeah
S0012	this be what they do
S0152	yeah
S0012	it's horrible ain't it that's a horrible think ain't it
S0152	mm
S0012	the way youngsters in that type of environment go
S0152	yeah
S0012	horrible think hm
S0152	you know and and the and it's interest cos huh people that have move out aren't aren't aware of one of a couple of ali's friends who use to live at easton
S0012	mhm
S0152	now easton's fine there's nothing wrong with easton
S0012	no
S0152	er but they move to taverham they build a house at taverham and they've and they have very little to alright they're still friends but they don't have as much to do with that crowd
S0012	no
S0152	now
S0013	mm
S0152	as as they do
S0012	no no
S0152	because they're they're see it this be a much better lifestyle than what
S0012	what they be
S0152	what you
S0012	yeah
S0152	what you've
S0013	mm
S0152	what you've get
S0012	yeah
S0152	now sometimes you can't you're in that position where you can't get out of that
S0012	well that's right yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know
S0012	i mean my brother actually live in bowthorpe
S0152	you know
S0012	he buy the house yonks ago and that gradually get worse and worse and
S0152	yeah
S0012	worse
S0013	mm
S0012	there
S0152	yeah some of the stories that say er she can't they she can't move anywhere else at this
S0012	no
S0152	at this point in time
S0012	not at this particular time
S0013	mm
S0012	no
S0152	you know and she's wary of the environment around
S0013	yeah
S0152	around her
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh
S0152	so
S0012	i mean er we predict cos er that use to be great big field across there when when we be younger and when they start to build them we predict that they would be the slum of the future and really and truly that's what they be
S0152	they're they're become certain certain roads will become the the roads that
S0012	no go areas and stuff
S0152	the the roads that be not owner occupy
S0012	yeah
S0152	dare i say it
S0013	mm
S0152	be the areas that have that problem
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	cos people don't care about you know
S0012	they just don't care about their environment where they live
S0013	yeah
S0012	or nothing they
S0152	and and it do appear that even the house associations don't put that much emphasis into those areas where they should be
S0012	no
S0152	if you're just a normal person who hasn't get any young children anything like that they don't wanna know
S0012	no
S0152	they just get by where if you've get young children you get load of things
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	you know and er and if you work you get no chance
S0012	no
S0152	you know so
S0013	yeah
S0152	i don't er
S0012	that's such a shame though about i mean the government and and the power that be know what they be do when they put all these house cheek to cheek and jowl by jowl you know and there be no actual live space for the people
S0152	well how you know they they moan about the back to back house
S0012	yeah
S0152	so we'll get rid of the back to back house where there's no toilets inside
S0013	mm
S0152	but we'll give you a tower block
S0012	yeah
S0152	how many how many people wanna live in a tower block
S0012	well that's right
S0152	when they can walk out their door
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	give me the back to back house
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	right and if you look at the modern estates now they're no different to the back to back house
S0012	no they're not
S0152	at all
S0012	no
S0152	you've just get a
S0012	mm
S0152	bite more garden or you're you've get a nice a bigger area

S0012	and down marlpit lane you get all those flats ain't it horrible they build them in the sixties and seventies they pull down all these terrace house in norwich beautiful old terrace house where people be really happy together really happy together there be a you know er an environment of friends and neighbour that take people dinners when they be ill
S0152	yeah but why
S0012	and help people out when they be ill and them them house have their own yards at the back and their own little tiny bite of front garden okay they didn't have anywhere to park the car but there weren't then
S0152	mm
S0012	many cars about then and this be what it be all about weren't it
S0152	it wasn't just that though be it
S0012	well they just want to destroy the community i think
S0152	no cos
S0013	mhm
S0152	if you think where where they take those house from and what they put in those place
S0012	yeah
S0152	it's industrial units or
S0012	yeah that's right yeah yeah
S0152	so they can charge a premium for
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah that's terrible that be terrible i mean we use to go down there and see friends' mums and stuff you know and it be it be really nice everybody'd if the wash be get wet people'd
S0152	mm
S0012	run out and get it in for them you know
S0152	but society change then didn't it
S0012	yeah
S0152	who who make that who change that society
S0012	well i think the sixities have get a lot to lot to to to do with it because in the sixties the architecture move to house to tower tower block didn't it
S0152	mm
S0012	and the tower block didn't have any they er people be lock in their little cell
S0152	in their little box
S0012	and and when they come out onto the communal staircases they be awful concrete place where they be all dark and horrible
S0152	just dark and dismal
S0012	there be no lift
S0152	the lift didn't er lift hardly work
S0013	yeah
S0152	or they be vandalize
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then people'd pee in the corridors and stuff like that
S0012	that's it yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	and then start sleep in the corridors
S0013	mm
S0012	oh
S0152	i remember the where i use to live they build a tower block on what be call sladefield road secondary modern
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos cos the sladefield road use to be sladefield road junior and infant school
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then further up be the secondary modern school
S0012	yeah
S0152	well just with birmingham change how it change they build washwood heath comprehensive so all the kid from sladefield road that er would've go to sladefield road secondary modern
S0012	go to the comprehensive

S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and that be the the road that you live in you go and deliver
S0012	yeah yeah your yeah
S0152	all those things
S0012	mm
S0152	i'll have to see whether it's still there matter of fact on google earth cos it it wasn't the bestest of place years ago
S0012	oh that's strange that they they create huge no go areas in different cities er
S0152	well they in birmingham they do this they do chelmsley wood and castle vale and castle vale be horrendous now there be no tower block leave at castle vale anymore
S0012	no
S0152	they have knock it down now castle vale be opposite the jaguar plant
S0012	oh right yeah
S0152	alright castle bromwich er and er the school get burn down a few time at castle vale
S0152	school get burn down a few time
S0013	oh dear
S0152	because it be so bad
S0013	huh
S0012	yeah
S0152	and er we do a geography project around there gc er gce geography project which be look at different environments and
S0012	mm
S0152	talk about this and the last time i go they have knock them all down and there must've be round about fifteen twenty tower block on this area
S0012	be there yeah
S0152	and they've put them back to house and stuff like that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	so
S0013	mm
S0012	well people do need their own space don't they
S0152	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	they need their own space and that's such a shame that these stupid rich people that's what it be say oh we can stick them all in rabbit hutches and make them work but
S0152	well it's keep the people down though isn't it
S0012	that be keep the people down
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know why do margaret thatcher open up sell the council house
S0012	well that's true yeah yeah now there's no there's well there's no council house they're all
S0152	social house
S0012	social house now yeah
S0152	but why
S0012	and that's all privatize ain't it
S0152	yeah
S0012	it's
S0152	but why do they do it
S0012	i dunno
S0152	because if you've get a mortgage and you're put money in you've get to continue to work so go on strike make no difference do it
S0012	yeah that's true yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	you can't strike if you've get a mortgage that's that be true that's a good point
S0152	you know
S0013	mm
S0152	so we can control the people this way by by think that we're give them the the mean to have their own home
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	hm
S0152	we get money for it because at some point they're gonna need to be re wire they're gonna have new central heat they're gonna have to have this they're gonna have to have that
S0012	they gotta buy furniture
S0013	mm
S0012	and they gotta then they gotta buy a car to park outside and all
S0152	so we'll do this therefore we get money in to er so we can do things with it and then we've get them we're control them
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and why and why be the government go back to this be your education you've gotta have this
S0012	yeah
S0152	because it control certain factions of the population
S0013	mm
S0012	yep
S0152	so vocational course for people with hand on experience that's the way they learn
S0012	yeah
S0152	can't have that
S0152	because that give them that independence that they can earn where if they can't read and write
S0012	that's true
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know so they if they can't get an education one way
S0012	but then there's the other the the other side of the story when you have a good education you know your right and when you know your right then you start question them
S0152	yeah but you only want certain
S0012	governments
S0152	you only want certain people to have the to know those right though don't you
S0012	yeah you do yeah yeah
S0152	and er which people do you want the people in the upper end of the
S0012	yeah
S0152	of the class
S0012	the ones that will become politicians
S0152	yeah
S0012	and the ones that will become doctor and the ones
S0152	yeah
S0012	that will become
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	if you look at it
S0012	give them a good live
S0152	yeah
S0012	and keep the keep the workers down
S0152	yeah yeah i i haven't read all of it but the government be about to do away with national pay rise
S0012	yes i saw that yeah
S0152	so that mean that you could be work one area of the country and earn more than somebody do the same job somewhere else
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	isn't that back to how it use to be a long long time ago
S0012	yeah when when the unions move in and and try to stop all that and want equal pay for everybody i remember when i use to work at er as at which have go now oh no that weren't engineer that be the same that be er er own it now
S0012	right they own a plant in dagenham there be a plant in dagenham they be get double what we be get at in norwich and we ask them why and they say because they live down there and they have to have more pay but they be make no end of money out of us weren't they
S0152	mhm
S0012	get half the pay i think we be get at the time twenty one pound a week basic pay and down in dagenham they be get sixty
S0152	mm not right but that's no different to what teacher's salary in london now
S0012	well that's true yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	there's a good six thousand pound on teacher's salary in london
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but that don't do them any good do it
S0013	no
S0012	because
S0152	cos the price down there be
S0012	they have to live there
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm rent down there be horrendous
S0152	yeah
S0013	isn't it
S0012	well er why that doesn't cost london council any more than our councils to you know the the
S0152	there's a need isn't it supply and demand
S0012	there's a supply and
S0013	yeah
S0012	demand yeah
S0152	that's what it come down to
S0013	people want the house they'll pay a premium for them
S0152	supply and demand
S0013	they don't want the ones up in yorkshire and derbyshire so much do they and they're they're get cheaper
S0012	well only the rich people want the ones in derbyshire and yorkshire because er they can have a second house

S0012	yeah
S0152	o two o three
S0012	right yeah
S0013	ah mm
S0152	rather than just keep the image number er like sort of dcmmis and
