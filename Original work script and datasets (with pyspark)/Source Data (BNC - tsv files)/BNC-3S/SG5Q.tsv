S0012	yeah
S0278	but what we're do at at the posh concert at oh you have to come come come to because there's a special open day a bell folk open even just before christmas mull wine and mince pies i don't know if there's any charge i don't think there be what they use to do be go around and they decide they wouldn't do it cos people don't open doors now and then they use to stand in the middle and oh they use to go in the pub to start with when

S0012	oh right
S0278	erm but she but she be have to focus on what she's do
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0278	cos i'm on two bell down the which be about not right down the bottom to other people below me erm and then there's and then there's be be up there around the corner where and i have to move next door to her but she i think she's very good she doesn't make any mistake but she's you can tell she stay focus on that and when i'm play obviously lose because i'm not do anything

S0278	yes
S0012	and when you pull it again and it go click and move out of the way and then the other one come around and do it as well
S0278	yeah but it's not it's probably wear on that
S0012	no no no

S0012	i've try and i look at them the whole point be that work before i take it to piece didn't it
S0278	why do you take it to piece then

S0278	the way around it
S0012	yeah yeah well it just would not pull down and when i take it all to piece it have load of debris in it from when the electrician have put it up in the first place
S0278	mm
S0012	and a spare screw that lay in the bottom
S0278	be you sure that hadn't come out from somewhere

S0013	yes he be he be erm in the middle of a move he he live down just just down the road here just down on the corner anyway and erm we use to look after his goat when they go away on holiday and he use to come here
S0012	so we think be a friend we'll have him do the electric
S0013	a really nice guy
S0012	a lovely bloke a lovely bloke
S0013	but when he start do this house he be move to er the sea where be it i think
S0012	mm
S0278	mm
S0013	well one of those anyway and so his mind wasn't there and he be do some stupid things and he put a wire just run it across our skylight and down to a shower
S0012	to the shower and we say that cannot go there you know he weren't with it
S0013	yeah and erm oh in the end cos we switch on one light in the live room
S0278	mm
S0013	and all these light go off things like that be happen in the end he have to get his son to come and sort it out who be also an electrician i think he be kind of a you know one of these job electricians and not really properly train that's what we believe don't we
S0012	yeah
S0013	but he be he be do some silly things and then he use to say oh you don't want to put a socket near there that's a stupid place to have it you know you don't want all these sockets and
S0012	yes we do we want sockets
S0013	we didn't have that many
S0012	the more sockets you've get the less work i suppose
S0013	and then he then he put the we have a television point up in one of the bedrooms
S0012	and no plug to plug the
S0013	and no no no socket next to it
S0012	television point
S0013	and we'd we put it all down on our plan but he completely miss that out you see yeah it's still like that isn't it

S0278	harmonica kazoo and guitar he well he make it sing anyhow they're have a the one of the i think it's the the bass player erm his wife at their church which be out that way
S0013	mm
S0278	this way as well erm they have each year a raffle for a christmas hamper a big two hundred pound super duper hamper you see erm between all the church in the benefice which be a lovely idea so everybody so perhaps it's a fiver for to go in and it's for well more than pay for
S0012	yeah
S0278	i think and then you have to go to a gather to to for when they do the prize draw and then they charge five pound for you to go to the gather for the prize draw
S0013	yeah
S0278	in this one church but there's there's they're play and they're do skiffle it's gonna they've get a skiffle band together

S0278	and that'll be fun so erm but you do but you've get mull wine and mince pies and things
S0012	mm
S0278	and cake and stuff afterwards so that's part of it so they're have a it's nice though they're have a party for the for the prize draw to see who's win the raffle they've all pay for anyway
S0012	yeah
S0013	right
S0278	but it's a clever way of raise fund isn't it cos
S0012	yeah
S0278	you win win win
S0012	yeah
S0278	don't you
S0013	well they do yeah
S0278	so this this be in the church and erm so and i be go out there
S0013	yeah
S0278	that's on a that's on a saturday night i think or be it not this one next saturday so she's have to work a whole really difficult week so she could have the weekend off
S0012	oh
S0013	yeah i saw her this morning
S0278	do you be she walk the dog
S0013	mm
S0012	mm mm
S0278	she's quite happy now she get her she she the erm she get storage heaters and the one in her lounge pack up
S0012	storage heaters they're expensive they be
S0278	they've pack up well i mean er when the price of oil go up they be probably weren't that's
S0012	i dunno they're they're still electric isn't much more expensive than oil anyway
S0278	but then she couldn't well how it happen be that they they have a leak in their oil tank and when they work out the price of what it be gonna cost for the new tank
S0012	mm
S0278	and that we think
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	well we may as well get sort so that we're not gonna have problems and and it be ever so difficult because at that time they only have one door into the house that be through the front
S0012	yeah
S0278	if they want to get to the garden they have to come out of the front and walk up the side and go to the bottom of the door in the back
S0013	mm mm
S0012	be they like that when they build them
S0278	yeah there wasn't door in the back
S0013	that's illegal now isn't it
S0278	they have two
S0012	it's illegal that be
S0013	yeah
S0278	they have two
S0012	yeah
S0013	well
S0278	they have two bedrooms
S0013	oh yes
S0278	two bedrooms at the back and then they build an extension on the back and put the door in at the same time
S0012	yeah
S0278	and they put an extension on the front but it must have be a really tiny bungalow to start with
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm and she say it be so difficult cos when i take the when i have to put the wash out i have to go out through the front door
S0013	yeah
S0278	grab all the kid take them around the back with me cos
S0013	yeah
S0278	i couldn't leave them on their own then you know fetch them all around the front again
S0012	it seem such a stupid
S0013	yeah
S0278	yeah well it be that's she be say that's what what all we could afford at the time
S0012	yeah but it's a silly idea to have
S0013	for the
S0012	no back door
S0013	yeah
S0278	mm
S0012	into the garden i mean that might be
S0013	if you haven't get a garden it would be different
S0012	yeah
S0013	so
S0012	i mean flats only have one door don't they
S0013	yes that's right yeah
S0278	mm mm
S0012	but i think to build a bungalow or a house without with only one door still there you go that can can't be illegal
S0013	no it can't be
S0012	it probably won't come up to
S0012	builders' regs now
S0013	we saw on erm home under the hammer and we watch that quite a bite so this they have this up for auction and it's still get the tin bath in the kitchen
S0012	in the kitchen and you lift the
S0013	you know with the
S0012	the worktop up in the kitchen
S0278	wow
S0012	yeah
S0013	and it
S0278	well we have a tin bath didn't we
S0013	well yeah but i mean
S0278	we do but that be that
S0013	you don't expect it still now or do you
S0278	no
S0013	and that be
S0012	telephone
S0278	that must be a grade one list if it go back that far with a tin bath in the kitchen
S0012	oh yeah
S0278	probably can't remove it
S0013	sing bag
S0012	it's it's an absolute rubbish phone call i bet
S0013	yeah
S0013	no no it's not there
S0278	go hello
S0012	do it
S0278	hello hello yeah it be
S0012	well it ain't mine

S0012	mm
S0278	they all do the same ring do they
S0012	well i don't know i don't bother with them
S0278	mm
S0012	nobody know my number nobody know my text so i don't get any message and this be just an emergency for when we're out and er we can call each other cos we get lose in one day
S0012	but if you think we be we be in and we go to the mall in and er we say we'll meet again in
S0278	mm
S0012	well we didn't know at the time there be two one at the bottom of the stairs and one at the top

S0013	be like that that's actually
S0012	yeah
S0013	three store isn't it three
S0012	well that's like
S0278	three one on top
S0013	level
S0012	so this be why we get er telephone and er only only and a couple of other people know my number so i don't ever get any call which be good otherwise i'd get i'd get a load of rubbish call
S0013	yeah and if it's less than
S0278	a chap come into when i be do the the food bank thing and he say no i don't want to have one of those but have you see my wife she's suppose to meet me here i can't find her anywhere

S0278	and turn it they be two cottages and they turn it into the
S0012	oh
S0278	so it's the at

S0013	yeah
S0278	no that's on the coast
S0013	okay
S0012	well that's anyway
S0278	yeah yeah and and it's out it's out there oh my word we go the wrong way i say i say we'll go around the north look a straighter route and let just let the lady on the satnav take us well towards the end we be go up this road which have they have bush up the middle rather than grass you know it be so narrow
S0012	yeah
S0278	and just and i'm think if we meet someone now i won't know where i can pull in they might know the road i don't know
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0278	erm and then at one stage say i'm i'm get a bite frighten i don't like this
S0012	do she
S0278	she didn't like it yeah she say i don't like this her mum never would drive up on minor roads it have to be all major roads
S0012	oh right
S0278	maybe some
S0012	your dad use to go leery when there be grass in the road didn't he
S0013	he use to love it
S0012	and he use to think oh look
S0012	nobody's be up here for a long while
S0278	mm
S0013	we we actually get scar at some of the
S0278	well at night and the weather wasn't good it be damp and erm we er the last time we go up to see him the satnav pack up and then you don't know where where you be when it pack up do you
S0012	i don't think our satnav be work any more either
S0278	but anyway he erm
S0012	it's come to the end of its life
S0278	but stop we stop and i say let's pull over so we pull over and the road widen out a bite and pull over and and and let's restart the satnav and see if we can see the little when it restart it'll we'll have the little flag and we're near enough you know to see and we just have to keep go another hundred yards and we be there
S0012	yeah
S0278	that be it so yeah
S0012	the satnavs be really weird because this road be unnamed you can't believe it can you
S0278	mm
S0012	it's unnamed so they reckon on on google anyway but it's call you know
S0278	mm
S0012	and if anyone come here follow their satnav they never come here they finish up at the bottom of the road at the at the corner
S0278	oh
S0012	on the corner
