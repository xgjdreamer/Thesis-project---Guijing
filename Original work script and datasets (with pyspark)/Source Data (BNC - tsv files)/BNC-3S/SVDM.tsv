S0290	so be this what be i allow to talk about this record whilst it's on
S0282	yeah
S0290	be it be it be analyse by a computer sort of or by a person go through it
S0282	i don't know probably people
S0290	oh
S0282	might be people i don't know
S0290	fair enough okay so i'll explain my trip
S0282	to thailand
S0290	to thailand i suppose
S0290	erm so erm take the bus to gatwick i think the airport
S0282	do your mum not drive you
S0290	no she doesn't drive
S0282	why
S0290	anyway erm it's just not the train aren't work it's actually actually not
S0282	why don't you just get the train together
S0290	erm well i think it be heathrow and you can't get a train to heathrow
S0282	oh heathrow how long do it take you to get to heathrow
S0290	erm
S0282	by bus
S0290	no it's like it's really slick well i think it be a little bite more but i think it be easier to get the train
S0282	how much do the bus cost
S0290	it cost about the same and then we go up erm
S0282	oh
S0290	and then i have a seven hour flight to
S0290	and that be that be really good because it be really i never go before and it's so like dry and deserty and desolate and look very
S0282	be that where you be stay
S0290	no no no we just stop over there and it be like it be unimaginable it make turkey look cool it be just it be like it be like a desert with house in it and stuff
S0282	erm
S0290	i think in and countries like that it be so hot
S0282	so how do you get around
S0290	well like stay inside in the hot hours of the day and if you need to get anywhere you have to get a taxi
S0282	fridge
S0290	no yeah lack of air condition in these countries be not good
S0282	yeah
S0290	erm anyways we stay there for like an hour turnover and then get back on our eight hour flight to thailand so by this point for the sake of
S0282	so what will you do at the airport
S0290	well it be just an hour change over
S0282	so just eat
S0290	so i just eat a burger and get back on the plane oh now we'd have the as you're change time zone you need to try and sleep but i be wrong
S0282	be it better than the flight to america
S0290	erm yeah
S0282	be it a patch flight
S0290	it be it be an even flight to america
S0282	and it be only seven hours
S0290	it be kind of no i think it be fourteen hours
S0282	oh i see but at least you have a stop over
S0290	erm yeah but it's almost like it's almost nicer to get it all out of the way at once like when we fly to america i don't know it be a bite half and half but erm anyway so we arrive in thailand in the even time
S0282	yeah
S0290	have leave and like after a great deal of trauma
S0290	like how on earth do we get from the airport to where we be mean to be stay
S0291	well do you not work that out before
S0290	erm no obviously not
S0291	how much of it have you plan
S0290	what
S0291	but you do book a hotel
S0290	we have a conversation about the but it's it's so cheap you don't need to book those you don't book stuff
S0282	yeah
S0290	because obviously it's a bite more impoverish erm so we like spend about an hour at the airport to work out how exactly to get into where we be go so then we get the train and then have to get a taxi from the train station because it be too far to walk then it be really really come into come into the train station into just the hustle and bustle cos it's like so different to england's quite a erm erm what's the word i'm look for it's just so much more chaotic in thailand it's it's so much more order and like purposeful whereas it's just
S0282	yeah
S0290	with cars all over and
S0282	and people be there for a purpose
S0290	there's toot and there's it's very smelly it's a much more dangerous city
S0282	uhu
S0290	um sort of really really it's just like so crazy and then we have to try and call a taxi and erm this be we realize we couldn't get a taxi because erm he be like yeah yeah man you want two two of these finger and
S0290	and erm we're like oh cos you're mean to like make sure they use the meter
S0282	yeah
S0290	because otherwise they wouldn't be and it end up we get there and it's sort of like sixty something which be like one pound something
S0282	yeah
S0290	and so we hand him over a thousand cos that's all you can get out of the atms
S0282	yeah
S0290	and we only give seven hundred on the way back try to like engage with him well wasn't get out of the taxi and i be argue with this guy he be like i say two hundred and it turn out be two hundred even though he's not gonna use the meter they do that it's like a thing but i be like man you say you would keep the meter run and as i be argue with him the door be open and have take the stuff out and he start try to drive off with me like half in the taxi which be a bite of a nightmare erm so eventually we jump out it be only couple of quid but i be just a bite annoy about it
S0282	yeah
S0290	from then on you have to be quite careful it's weird though because of it's like the only place we've be where you know i think in england i think it's a law that they have to use the meter or something
S0290	no but in erm in thailand you get all the taxis that be go in certain touristy areas and they'll put a cloth over the meter they call it the top taxi meter so you think oh that's fine but they won't they refuse to use a meter and if you say to them can use the meter they'll just drive off
S0291	yeah
S0290	they'll only do a pre negotiate bump up fare so but then be a lot cheaper but you risk death in them
S0282	oh it's like in like taxis you have to ask how much it would be to go somewhere ridiculous
S0290	yeah no you have to like pre negotiate a fee and yeah what we find be a couple of time we have to be like how much cos they'll be like eight time the price
S0282	yeah
S0290	and then eventually with a bite of haggle it will be just like
S0282	yeah
S0290	erm yes so anyway we stay in for like a couple of days which isn't like a really touristy district and
S0282	what do you do when you get to the hotel
S0290	we just for a few days but that's like that's like erm western night life sort of district it's basically
S0282	do you go out
S0290	it's like an epicentre for yeah it's like an epicentre for group of like various westerners cross paths erm all come into like very erm western culture to
S0282	really
S0290	so that like for a couple of days which be up in the north which be rural area of thailand but be the biggest city up there
S0282	yeah
S0290	erm so we go
S0290	because you know in
S0282	yeah
S0290	and we just didn't want to
S0282	i'm didn't get much sleep
S0290	no cos they're so like stuff for space on a plane but whereas on a train there's plenty of room
S0282	yeah
S0290	but erm you get like a proper bed and
S0282	mm
S0290	erm and then we arrive in shanghai in about seven hours and when we off the train and there be a tourist information centre and so we go up there to ask where to stay and this man be really nice erm explain you know and he kind of whisk us off around the back and put us in a back of a pickup truck that seat in the back of a pickup truck
S0282	yeah
S0290	and erm erm he say we'll just grab some more people and then we'll take you for free to your hotel
S0282	oh dodge
S0290	and then basically it all unfold and we get there and we weren't like force into stay there but it turn out all the people at the tourist information booths be various different owners of the different hotels so where you stay depend on who you speak to at the tourist information booth and which hotel they own so he just whisk us off to his hotel it be really nice though and that be actually probably the nicest place we stay by far but he actually provide good customer service whereas a lot of those place be rude
S0282	yeah
S0290	but erm it be just really weird cos i the tourism be so corrupt in these small areas that there's no like official
S0282	yeah but it's like it's like in if you ask for directions they expect you to pay them
S0290	mm
S0282	together
S0290	yeah yeah i know that be very weird erm but you know he be but he be really quite nice cos whereas he be like friends speak very good english make sure people be look after although it wasn't the nicest hotel he be a good sort of man and we go to like other place like when we be try to book some snorkel and we walk in and erm we be look and we be like what snorkelling trip have you get available to the and he point at the thing like at a poster thing and go back to play his computer game and we're try to talk to him and he didn't really want to talk to us because he be try to do his computer game or something so it be
S0282	why didn't you just go to the map
S0290	yeah we do but erm the point be we get a lot of that in some place
S0282	but yeah why be people like that
S0290	i don't know but you get that in place like that and then you've get but erm
S0290	but erm i always think when you always see the tv program and people look awesome so humid and sweaty hot very hot not at all like cos it's like
S0282	why
S0290	because like it's very beautiful but like you see it on tv and it look amaze but it's very sticky and insects attack you but you can put on whatever deet you want but you get attack by mosquitoes so you have to wear as much clothe as you can to try and put off the mosquitoes
S0290	at the same time as try to take off as many clothe as possible because it's so hot
S0282	yeah
S0290	and erm yeah that be a bite so you end up cover like over a period of a day you would like like really but erm very and erm we stay
S0282	how many days
S0290	two days so we track it up to some small village stay in like a bamboo hut and then erm we track back over the next day but we go to a waterfall which be pretty awesome
S0282	it be
S0290	but erm like we stay in the village and we be cos it be like no electricity maybe run water no no no they have like very limit like run water supply in certain place and like literally bamboo huts and they just go on to the rice field and work so that be
S0290	well it be me and
S0282	be they nice
S0290	yeah they be all quite like erm
S0290	it be like jordy but they be quite like erm no they be they be nice but
S0282	a bite
S0290	a bite
S0282	yeah
S0291	it's like when we go onto erm safari into the desert in two american people and we be just amaze
S0291	they'd obviously be on like desert wear dot com
S0291	and we get into like the desert site thing and um they be just like well we're go to go to bed now oh look which bedroom do we get because like me and be like gonna be in one little hut and they be gonna be in another and we're like be we gonna fight this out except for me and be obviously gonna sleep out in the star like we weren't gonna watch like we weren't just gonna go to bed and sleep and they're like make sure okay we're we don't really care we're we're not really sleep and they be like oh okay well can we just take one of your bed then for the other thing that we

S0291	we be there for like two days
S0290	and be it like you be sleep in the open desert or be it
S0291	no it be just an open desert
S0290	well that's pretty crazy the star must have be amaze
S0291	they be
S0290	okay
S0291	it be actually really fun
S0290	how be camels compare to horse

S0291	erm two
S0290	so you sit between the hump
S0291	yeah
S0290	that's cool
S0291	the one in front be like really greedy and would keep stop to eat and obviously all the others be like attach to the guy in front so whatever that one stop everyone else would have to stop
S0290	what would it stop to eat then
S0291	like erm well it look like twig but it's like a twiggy
S0290	oh
S0291	but yeah it be quite fun
S0290	what else do you do there
S0291	erm
S0291	uh yeah we go for about ten days
S0290	stay in a five star hotel the whole time
S0291	no no no it be like we go in the first we stay which be like i think we be there for erm and it take us like an hour and a half to walk to the hotel suitcase and it's like dead of night in morocco and it's so dodge and like be convince she'd get the right way and she often hotel
S0291	hotel it be so
S0290	do you know
S0291	it be such a nightmare
S0291	and especially since you don't have like google map or that we didn't even have a map
S0290	oh yeah
S0291	well we have a we have a map but all the roads be wrong like all the road name be like swap around oh it be such a nightmare
S0291	that be not the biggest problem it be find hotels i think
S0290	and they have this massive so
S0291	yeah
S0290	you could try and find a nice one and then you have to it's just get somewhere with a bed and so we look and have some pretty dodgy accommodations
S0291	yeah
S0291	yeah
S0290	cos like all these place be
S0291	yeah
S0290	and when we actually
S0291	yeah

S0291	oh my god see we get lucky but well when i say we but um
S0291	yeah like the last day because train be like seven pound
S0290	yeah
S0291	so reservations

S0291	yeah but it's a lot less hassle know that you're go to stay with them
S0290	yeah well me and be only plan on stay a week and then we end up stay two weeks
S0291	i think it depend where you're go because like people's absolute
S0290	oh
S0291	you know i would not have want to like from the hotel because it be get all the printouts so everything be completely settle so they couldn't like add any extra price to it and
S0290	how much
S0291	about ten pound four pence
S0290	that's not too bad
S0291	no
S0290	it's weird
S0291	yeah yeah
S0290	so what else do you do for ten days just shop
S0282	we go for one day we go down to the beach and go swim which be like because none of the girls would go swim or to the beach

S0291	so then the next day it be like you know trousers and a full long sleeve shirt and head scarves and we be still get even after like even though we be completely cover up
S0290	some of my friends be there for erm
S0291	if you're with a girl i think maybe it's easier
S0291	but actually cos it be me and and cos they could tell that she be like whatever they're not say but like someone know and then just completely
S0290	wow
S0291	the same
S0290	yeah we have manners in the same way
S0291	nobody they they just get all their english off like english like off american movies star and the stuff they come out with be like so inappropriate and doesn't make any sense
S0290	yeah
S0291	but they think oh see we understand and it be just like oh after like i just get so bore after a while but you just couldn't go you just have to continue
S0290	oh me and just stop like i think at first you try and communicate
S0291	and then you just stop acknowledge people but it's not even really
S0290	well we just get to the point when you walk down the street and
S0291	but it it just turn into where you just don't trust anyone and we have such an awkward situation do i tell you about this café we go to we be outside a library there and we be look to go into the library and we be oh god someone be go to try and sell us stuff and we be like no like go away café here if you want to and then we saw oh there's a café here if you want to come have some tea and we be no we're not go to a bugger old café just leave us alone cos we be get really piss off because they be get pushy and then finally we be we're just like oh fine we'll just go into this café so we go into the café and get a coffee but we wait for ten minutes we pretend we didn't speak english because like that's the only way to leave anyone alone so she be pretend she be greek and i be pretend i be german and so like we to this point we be just talk about jibbery gook to him but just use so he think well everyone speak english but then he be like oh so you're from greek oh okay what about you and i be like and then go oh yeah she's from greece as well and i be like oh my god no but he turn around and say he can speak greek erm and i be like oh no but i study in germany and then he be like oh perfect i speak german and i be like oh bullocks i've really put my foot in it now
S0291	so then he start to like say say stuff to me in german and then he be like translate it to her in greek
S0290	oh so what he speak greek and german
S0291	no no no he didn't speak greek he speak german but he speak to me in german and obviously i and he be like no can you translate now greek to her so that she's a part of the conversation
S0291	and then i be just like oh my god like so he'd say something to me and i kind of turn to and would be like blah blah blah blah just so bad and then it last a bite and then just like start talk like a bite of break english and you know when you speak break english it's really difficult to speak like bad english so we be both try to be like oh it be so bad and then after a while we just leave we be just like screw off this guy but
S0290	erm we get a guy we be try to get into the palace and it be huge
S0282	which palace
S0290	one of the big palaces of the king's palace erm and it be really huge there's no indication of where the entrance be
S0282	yeah
S0290	and it's probably like a couple of miles long and obviously so we be walk around it for age and then erm some guy come up to us and be like where be you try to
S0291	oh no that's always the way when
S0290	yeah i mean and then he be like erm it's erm it's close for lunch but erm and then he be like but we can show you some other stuff to do and yeah he be like i'll show you some other stuff to do but it reopen in a couple of hours and he be like no no i'll tell you what and then you can erm you can go off and tell him to take you back here
S0291	yeah
S0290	that mean it's a scam because any arrangement between drivers and like

S0290	erm so we walk away and then we palace and they have tons erm don't talk to anyone in the palace we don't close for lunch and
S0291	oh good
S0290	so it be a big dishearten
S0291	but you get in
S0290	yeah then it be like thirty quid
S0291	that's ridiculous
S0290	mm so we didn't bother with that
S0291	yeah
S0290	er
S0291	it be funny how different countries work
S0290	yeah but they do all speak quite good english consider the state of their education in thailand though but i suppose it's cos it's like their whole industry
S0291	tourist
S0290	it's it's it's like something like ten ten percent or twenty percent of their national income be tourism which be huge
S0291	mm
S0290	compare to other countries
S0291	yeah
S0290	but i'd quite like to be in vietnam or somewhere i think that's like i think
S0291	really
S0290	like what be it or something somewhere like less tourist base
S0291	yeah
S0290	cos like it's become more of a like holiday like lot of big holiday resort and stuff
S0291	yeah
S0290	like very like you know like the greek islands and stuff it's become a bite like that so i don't know it's not really my thing
S0291	i hate touristy areas

S0290	in countries like this water be so like
S0291	and then climb up into the mountains like the view be like incredible like oh it be so nice
S0290	like the view in america

S0291	he's on the list yeah
S0290	but far from
S0291	well he isn't like i don't know he keep go on emergency go further up the list and then obviously go back down so and like it doesn't really work in that it's like someone it's like who whoever need a heart most urgently will get it so he's on the list but it doesn't mean that he'll necessarily get one within the next couple of years
S0290	about how well be

S0291	well he's come out for
S0290	so be he study at home
S0291	well he's do like a post grad so that's not really like if you imagine 's heart that's what it's like you get one hour or something and then everything else be up to you close to his heart
S0290	and
S0291	no he's in
S0291	he miss the audition to because he have a have a panic attack on the flight so they place

S0290	yeah he wouldn't be able to get drink
S0291	well no and like he he'd be leave would be a bite difficult and it would be in germany of course
S0291	but his teacher be like the english person you ever meet it just make me laugh every time he's take such a like to and like every time we get in a lift together he sort of want basically get kick out of just because of because he will just outright say he's the best or he's the best and best at this in the world but he erm always seem and he will just tell tell people how it be like he'll say just you kind of thing but not in like a mean way but just in like i'm not gonna lie to your face
S0290	yeah
S0290	so what do he teach you
S0291	he doesn't teach me but he
S0291	yeah he's do at
S0290	how be
S0290	how how
S0290	how far
S0291	like i can hold a conversation understand lessons get by but it's definite
S0290	do you just speak english or german
S0291	well most of my friends prefer to speak english but in the general class we all speak german to each other and if i want to speak german i can just speak german because it's just like
S0290	so do you think that you do you not think that it might be easier to learn if your friends speak german to you you're force into learn
S0291	yeah but everybody speak english at school
S0290	isn't but it's germany surely i mean i know they choose to but surely generally speak they have to speak german
S0291	yeah they do but they also want to speak english like people who want to speak english so like if there's an option to speak english to an english speaker or speak german to an english speaker it's go to be english isn't it
S0290	be they always really good at it
S0291	yeah but it's so funny because this this guy who move there this year he learn english from watch accent and he'd come up with all these cockney phrase
S0291	and i would just be like sorry
S0291	it be so funny he would say you little plonker and i be like okay this be so funny
S0290	do he wait do he have like the accent
S0291	yeah yeah he do well he's a bite of a bad boy anyway but he just like bigs it up a little more but he and then the other guy be dutch and his accent he come up with the most ridiculous things but it's interest
S0290	yeah
S0291	the worse be the french though for sure
S0290	they're bad
S0291	oh my god their accent but they don't even they don't even pretend
S0290	oh they have very heavy french accent as well
S0291	yeah it's really funny
S0290	but their french accent's quite nice
S0291	oh it's but i think they're quite like one of my friends speak like fluent german and i think her german accent be really good well all germans she's definitely do better than me
S0290	oh
S0282	so when be you go back
S0291	tuesday
S0282	for christmas
S0291	yeah i might come back some time later but we'll have to see
S0282	yeah
S0282	so how do that work would you come back that far
S0291	yeah
S0282	well no but for practice and for concert and how do you how do you be in concert if you can't
S0291	oh it's not for a concert it's like an interview for orchestra so you just come back
S0282	oh for when you're finish
S0291	not even well for when i finish this experience like apart from do audition and maybe do but you have to start early and just keep do hundreds and hundreds of
S0282	well that's excite
S0282	so if you succeed would they would they wait for you or would they want you to
S0291	well if i get through they would want me to do a trial and a trial period so like they'd ask you to do like certain concert during the year and the concert will have probably have a week of rehearsals so maybe they're do a concert in birmingham and concert in cornwall and somewhere else in london and they like give the date and you know you can say oh yeah i can do this one and this one and this one and go and do those and then gradually they'll stop ask you about four concert like if you do one concert and completely fuck it up they'll be like okay and just won't ask you for another concert and if you do well they'll ask you for another one and then after a year or something they would say
S0282	oh i see
S0291	so it's
S0282	so it's kind of an extend interview
S0291	yeah but i mean i've get a friend who's she leave she finish her degree like two years ago maybe and she's now on trials for about six orchestras so philharmonic and stuff and she do concert here and there but like it could be a year before she years like it could be four years before one of them will offer her an official you know and there be a lot of audition at the moment anyway because of the scottish thing
S0282	oh
S0291	so
S0291	i don't know but like they they won't offer a post until they know because a lot of them have connections so they won't offer any place scottish so it's a little bite hard
S0290	yeah
S0291	yeah
S0290	audition the other day then
S0290	yeah
S0291	because they say it's erm the next one be in early october and i the week before october so it be and and anyway the person on the interview be a guy from wales so

S0290	erm october the third or fourth i think so all my mat be leave at the moment they start go off they start very late compare to everybody else
S0282	uhu
S0282	be you gonna live in
S0290	sorry
S0282	be you go to live in
S0290	oh yeah i've get
S0291	what be you gonna do
S0291	do you like it
S0282	yeah i love it i get off the bus i do all my interview and i get off the bus and i think oh this one this one
S0291	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0282	erm
S0282	uhu well it be if you want to erm in our day erm you have to have two languages to study history and you have to do an entrance exam and you have to pass the entrance exam and they be much less erm there be an awful lot of competition by professors
S0291	yeah
S0282	i mean it's still like that but
S0291	yeah
S0290	now why don't you with i think he's always
S0282	yeah
S0290	always gonna be a regret for him
S0291	that's only because parent and i think
S0290	him he just
S0282	he use to be
S0290	one of my friends who erm we we take it last year but he won't make it this year
S0282	no no
S0290	perhaps because his grade go down
S0282	no no
S0282	biggest regret in his life
S0290	his life plan and couldn't really see the future he be consider take out another year to
S0282	um
S0290	i think like no he still talk about it and he think because he apply to for the first time really bad he say something he shouldn't have
S0282	oh what do he say
S0290	um they be talk or something and erm talk about whether countries should offer charitable support to others and erm he what's it call erm the uhu interview to parallel it with
S0282	uhu
S0290	erm a situation like a similar like animal farm you know that book
S0282	yeah
S0290	well that's expression so it's like a small situation
S0282	an example
S0290	with the same principals of the
S0282	yeah
S0290	um anyway he try to describe it in term of if be walk to work and he saw a child well first i should point out in his original work with the countries be like erm we shouldn't help other countries toward its citizens that's their problem and then the argument be erm be walk to work and he see a small child drown or something and should he save the child but he'll it will ruin his clothe forever i can't remember quite how it be describe but he'd never have nice clothe again sort of thing or pretend he didn't see it and walk on and in in the sense of be stubborn he erm say that he'd leave the child and walk
S0290	because he want to stick to his original argument
S0282	oh but but be he study economics
S0290	it be economics and history i think
S0282	economists there be load of economists who take that view
S0290	no but he's but it like he's interviewer really didn't obviously his interviewer be quite socialist or whatever and didn't like him at all
S0290	especially that comment and the fact that he be be so stubborn about it that he'd say he let a child drown but um his when the result come back it say so he be like interview that he didn't get in for that be the reason he didn't get in so he then apply to with me this year but base their selection more heavily on your available grade and he what a story which be as in for it's like the bare minimum so i think they so he have be compete against bad grade so i think he would have be really well interview to get a place but he say his interviewer seem to be fall asleep in his interview and stuff so he be pretty upset about that
S0282	oh
S0290	but he think it have get in as well think he have and then he get the letter that say no
S0282	oh that would take him a while to get over it
S0282	it depend i mean you might have really good and you might end up where's he gonna go
S0282	oh he'll love it at
S0290	yeah
S0282	i'm surprise that they give him a place if you'd let a child drown they really be suppose to be um
S0290	yeah
S0282	pretty much erm leave wing
S0290	be they leave wing
S0282	well they use to be i don't know if they be these days
S0290	that's interest
