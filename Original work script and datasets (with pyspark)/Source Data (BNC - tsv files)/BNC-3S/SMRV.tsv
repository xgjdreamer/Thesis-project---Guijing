S0405	i've i've er er like my teachers have talk about it in history but that's it
S0555	i think i dunno if i've see all i know be erm miss be talk about how there'd be a lot more maths and chemistry
S0405	really
S0555	and maybe biology miss be say
S0405	yeah damn struggle
S0555	mm
S0405	do you like our course now
S0555	it's okay
S0405	uhu
S0555	i dunno i haven't i haven't i haven't do much revision
S0405	yeah
S0555	i don't know what we're go to study all i know that miss be very excite to teach us about the twenty seven stag of death
S0405	twenty seven
S0555	yeah
S0405	shit
S0555	we only need to know like three but she's just excite to teach us all of them
S0405	you only need to know three
S0555	yeah
S0405	but she's teach you an extra twenty four
S0555	i think so
S0405	that seem like a pretty big proportion that she's er
S0555	i i dunno i think she's very reasonable she's not like miss where she teach us completely unnecessary things
S0405	yeah
S0405	but i like that though it's like
S0555	no but miss doesn't do it in a
S0405	in a focus way like miss like miss
S0555	yeah kind of
S0405	at least will get us to the point
S0555	yeah yeah she get us to a point
S0405	she will just go on it
S0555	miss 's just like doesn't tell us which of the stuff she'll teach us extra but then she won't tell us
S0405	yeah
S0555	which of everything that she's teach us we actually need to know
S0405	oh i see yeah yeah yeah
S0556	i swear some exams they just put in some random stuff that they think students should know but it's not on the syllabus
S0555	erm
S0556	cos someone be tell me i think it be
S0555	for biology
S0556	and biology or chemistry i dunno
S0555	chemistry be be like so yeah chemistry be like that cos like chemistry's better cos they they teach you and then you have to apply the principles to other stuff that you haven't ever hear of before
S0405	yeah i know
S0555	but it's so difficult
S0405	i'm so glad i didn't take chemistry
S0555	chemistry be
S0405	all i ever hear be just complaints about it
S0555	it's so it's it's i dunno i find it really difficult
S0405	yeah i don't think anyone well people do enjoy it erm so i be talk to miss
S0555	mm
S0405	about erm yeah look er that's my epq stuff er
S0556	what be your epq on
S0405	so the how humanity should respond to the poverty in the balkans so balkans six main countries from montenegro and kosovo bosnia herzegovina er macedonia and er just because of war in the nineteen nineties and circumstances they're really poor countries and they've get lot high level of poverty erm so they're involve in you know the migrant crisis cos people wanna get out cos you know there's no job there's no opportunities but all of these countries aren't part of the european union
S0555	uhu
S0405	and the european union be obviously reluctant to accept them cos oh we've get enough problems you know look at greece look at erm yugoslavia look at erm bulgaria look at all those problems and erm you know sorry erm so and erm and so they're not they haven't accept them into the eu and it's a long legislative process involve erm so i'm just gonna talk about what politically people should do what the people inside the balkans should do what the religious response be which be all the stuff we're do in rs
S0555	uhu
S0405	and er yeah i want like do that side of it but i i don't i think that's too broad i mean i need to keep it more focus i think
S0555	what's a biometric passport
S0405	no idea
S0555	it say
S0405	er
S0555	albanians will be allow to go around the schengen area if they have a biometric passport
S0405	erm
S0556	albanian boys be buff
S0556	i just have to say that
S0405	er
S0555	i've never meet anyone
S0556	i know like i know like two that be buff
S0555	i don't know anyone from albania
S0405	neither do i
S0555	out of all the albanian people you know
S0556	er no those be the only two albanian boys
S0405	ah
S0556	i know and they both go well one of them go to 's school now
S0555	oh wow
S0405	and be they both buff
S0555	so a hundred percent of albanian people you know
S0405	hundred percent
S0405	erm it's probably to do with because people be try to move so
S0555	why be why do macedonia
S0405	i think it's to do with fingerprint and stuff but yeah
S0555	why do macedonia why do why do greece and macedonia don't get on
S0405	so erm the the long story be that erm macedonia recognise itself as macedonia
S0555	yeah
S0405	and so do ninety percent of countries in the world
S0555	uhu
S0405	but then greece doesn't recognise it it recognise it as a you know the republic of yugoslavia
S0555	former yugoslavia republic
S0405	yeah
S0555	of macedonia
S0405	exactly erm and they don't accept it as that and so every time that any procedure to get them into the eu be you know bring up
S0555	yeah
S0405	they bring up the issue of their name
S0555	yeah
S0405	and because greece
S0556	that sound so childish
S0405	it be
S0555	yeah
S0556	if you think about it
S0405	it really be
S0405	it's so ridiculous and like i be look on wikipedia it's be go on for like twenty years and every single time they just bring up the issue of its name and because greece be in the eu it get an automatic well it give a veto that and every time they just they just choose to veto it and so those procedures can't get through
S0555	so it's just because of its name
S0405	but the long story er the short story be that they don't want they don't want macedonia in because as many eu countries they wanna protect their own interest
S0555	uhu
S0405	if they bring in macedonia look at all the the aid that be go into greece they don't want they don't want the european union to look at oh look there's lot of countries around here we need to distribute aid between all of them
S0555	yeah
S0405	you know it's just them be selfish be er that's that's an opinion but
S0555	oh
S0405	basically they're be selfish and they don't want to er
S0555	macedonia why don't they just make name greek different
S0405	erm
S0405	because they want to stop them get into the eu erm it's just some long
S0555	that's weird
S0405	political statement about it's really every other country in the world accept it as erm well not every other country but
S0555	accept what
S0405	most countries in the world accept it as macedonia but it's just greece but
S0555	and kosovo isn't recognise by five countries
S0405	yeah
S0555	by five member state
S0405	as as an independent state
S0555	so and it seem serbia doesn't recognise it
S0405	lot of these i mean this be the stuff we're do er in history but it's just a geopolitically sensitive area and er a lot of these countries be form erm so a hundred years ago when there be er there be all these different state and then there be there be two there be the turkish ottoman empire and then there be
S0555	mm
S0405	erm the prussian empire
S0555	uhu
S0405	and then there be an austro hungarian empire austria and hungary
S0555	uhu
S0405	and so they start end up through a series of war er divide up this area so montenegro be form purely to stop serbia from get access to this sea i dunno er there's either it's the mediterranean or the black sea or the i dunno the this be the adriatic sea sorry
S0555	yeah
S0405	erm so they simply didn't wanna give serbia access to this body of water
S0555	okay
S0405	obviously for trade purpose so it be purely create and recognise as an independent state because of that reason erm and so you can understand why some people be annoy and piss when they suddenly start demand aid because erm because some countries don't recognise it or they want to protect their own interest it's just a difficult situation do you want a hoody be you cold
S0555	no it's fine i have it's cos i remember explain his version of erm
S0405	yeah
S0555	kosovo
S0405	uhu
S0555	of what er kosovo he just and he be just basically there be load of albanian immigrants
S0405	oh yeah
S0555	who come to the area and they and then they have lot and lot of children and they have much more children than erm the the serbians that live there
S0405	oh i see
S0555	so they basically overpopulate it
S0405	yeah
S0555	so he sort of say that they be kind of like settlers and stuff
S0405	mm
S0555	rather than actually live there
S0405	yeah there's a lot of erm sort of exclusion or sort of er romani people i didn't know that much about them until i research it they're erm erm yeah they're socially exclude from tons of they're call gypsies but they're not the same gypsies as we have here but they're
S0556	oh yeah i've hear about that
S0405	they're just highly disperse around europe
S0555	yeah
S0405	and erm
S0555	like those people they be kill in the holocaust weren't they like
S0405	mm
S0555	three quarter of their population
S0405	yeah yeah yeah those kind of gypsies
S0555	yeah
S0405	yeah
S0555	yeah
S0405	er
S0555	well you shouldn't call them gypsies you should call them
S0405	no no no it it's like slang term sorry but they're call gypsies erm and er and so i'm just try to look at the reason why poverty exist how we can solve it but i don't wanna get all into statistics there's so many study and bore data
S0555	but you should don't shouldn't you need to know statistics and stuff
S0405	yeah yeah so i'm gonna include statistics on the what should the eu do because they've do all these these er program to see how different erm program work
S0555	mm
S0405	and it's the poverty in these areas they're a lot more rural than urban poverty
S0555	uhu
S0405	so you know there's program er you know look at the way that agriculture have change in the last ten years there be you know all the fairtrade stuff that that's go on because it's people aren't get pay enough
S0555	yeah
S0405	erm and it's not just unemployment it's erm it's er er it's it's it's the er the amount that these job be pay so so the as in there's not a direct correlation to be employ and not be poor so if you can still be employ but be be poor in these areas
S0555	yeah
S0405	it's about how well pay these job be
S0555	mm
S0405	cos some of these these job be underfunded or they're not pay enough erm so yeah i'm try to combine all those factor for the
S0555	when do you start your epq
S0405	this morning basically
S0555	oh
S0405	but no i doubt
S0555	no when do you sign up for it
S0405	oh er end of last year summer last year and then er we start it this year basically start of this year but i haven't do that much everyone do it this half term basically
S0555	oh

S0555	's do his as well what's his about
S0405	some
S0556	physics
S0405	physics shit
S0405	some er
S0556	that be the reason that
S0405	if everything be if
S0556	i teach him how to use a book note
S0405	we be in a quantum world
S0555	oh
S0555	oh miss teach me this morning right what be his about
S0405	erm
S0555	if everything
S0405	if everything if we be in a quantum world what would it be like or something like that
S0555	wow
S0556	yeah something like that
S0405	i'm not pretend to understand it but he he's get
S0556	yeah it's probably like that
S0405	he's get
S0555	something complicate
S0556	i don't understand it
S0555	if you do an epq what would yours be about
S0556	erm probably wealth inequality
S0555	in where
S0556	erm i'd probably do i dunno erm
S0405	do world
S0556	yeah i'd probably do world
S0405	global society oh but it

S0555	africa where in africa
S0556	maybe kenya probably kenya
S0555	kenya kenya or eastern africa or just kenya

S0556	oh you guy don't know my middle name
S0555	no we still don't
S0556	if you guy meet my mum yeah she would actually just say it and you guy
S0405	we should ask
S0556	it would it would be it would be over it would actually be over
S0556	it would be over
S0405	ah and a few other people so if you guy be good to do it in pair
S0555	yeah
S0405	we can do it as that but i think
S0556	mm
S0405	design a powerpoint and then so the first week we can during the tuesday session maybe we could discuss it a bite then the next tuesday cos the first session's the next wednesday so we could practise it on the tuesday as well as i need to just present it to miss to check it's all okay so
S0555	what be the presentation about
S0405	i've
S0555	we haven't decide oh doggy
S0405	here boy here boy
S0405	ah
S0556	don't do this to me
S0405	don't don't worry he doesn't care erm alright so i'm discuss stuff with miss so basically
S0555	well what if he start lick the chocolate and he have a fit
S0405	no i think it take time for them to get indigestion or whatever they have erm here we go though although there be so many ideas
S0555	mm
S0405	so people wanna talk about mental health and erm i think and suggest mental health people wanna talk about homelessness poverty and inequality erm the wellbeing sessions be connect to that cos it's kind of about just build a responsibility so the way miss cos i ask her what shall i do cos so many ideas
S0555	uhu
S0405	she she think the er the idea of fulfilment or personal fulfilment
S0555	uhu
S0405	so what do we get from fulfilment from and what be you know tie in the idea of what er what be humans what do we get fulfilment from erm so that way you can bring in health erm you can bring in what it mean to be humanity you know humanity you can bring in aid work humanitarian concern so how how er you know some ideas of what how you get fulfilment so we can have like maybe break it into three categories or something and then we can just talk about each one erm so different ways to connect to charities so erm one of the ideas that miss be say be that you know it's hard to feel depress or lack fulfilment if you're help the poor or if you're volunteer erm so maybe erm just discuss some of the ways people can volunteer or just discuss what give people fulfilment so
S0555	okay
S0405	that's connect to wellbeing because you're you're explain how people can be better off
S0555	and
S0405	erm
S0555	and we're not link it to whatever charity we choose to
S0405	erm
S0405	erm i think er yeah i think we can if if we want to if er if people have a strong passion for a charity then they might as well talk about that charity
S0555	do we not choose a charity
S0405	no
S0555	okay
S0405	erm i think i think rather than just choose one we'll just work through the year as it come
S0555	yeah
S0405	because we don't fully know what we're gonna do yet
S0555	sure
S0405	erm so this idea that a lot of the time with fulfilment
S0555	uhu
S0405	there's a focus on the individual and yourself
S0555	uhu
S0405	the self but a lot of the time we get fulfilment from be with other people or from help other people
S0555	yeah
S0405	whereas that's not something that's usually teach or discuss and tell to people so you know put that message across that volunteer and be with friends and stuff like that can give you just as much fulfilment as what you think personal fulfilment be right
S0555	uhu
S0405	erm erm so one idea she have be to er which be one of the things she do when she teach wellbeing erm be er to have sorry it's dark it's low battery so you have cos er i i say you know one of the things we be talk about be we wanna get them think we wanna get them involve
S0555	yeah
S0405	so show a series of image and just ask what this mean to them what they think
S0555	yeah
S0405	get the response from that so that's a break nail
S0555	okay
S0405	so think how that connect to your wellbeing i mean a lot of people would get very upset if they break a nail do it actually impact your health or what about other side of wellbeing in term of erm erm you know your actual personal wellbeing rather than just i wouldn't call that materialistic but you know what you consider to be your wellbeing
S0555	uhu
S0405	erm i think that's just argue with people that's a homeless guy er you know that's war miners' strike obviously we can change these to whatever we wanna be that's drought in america i mean what you know how do he feel fulfil or not fulfil that's er a bird cover in oil
S0555	ah
S0405	from a oil spill that's the vietnam picture of the girl that's cover in napalm and that's that a monkey in a cage that's a funeral i think it look like people wad through water disable i think that's the holocaust
S0555	yeah
S0405	so as i say we can just use whatever we want but that's what she tend to use so maybe start off with that when we ask the question what do it mean to be fulfil or how do you feel fulfil in your life then we go through those maybe discuss it a little bite erm
S0555	and so then we're just gonna sort of link that to the idea of humanitarian action
S0405	yeah so erm maybe we could use examples of charities things that they can do what be what a humanitarian club do
S0555	yeah
S0405	i erm oh
S0555	do you hear her snore
S0405	yeah
S0555	cute
S0555	er
S0555	oh the dog's all wet now
S0405	oh no
S0556	erm ask me if i should follow oh i would never do that
S0555	anyway but you you
S0405	erm but yeah just relate that to how people feel fulfilment one thing she do er i'm not say we should do it but anyway she play two different songs during while she go through the image for the first one be you know that everybody hurt song erm i dunno who it's by
S0555	sing it
S0405	just a really everybody hurt
S0556	oh yeah yeah
S0555	no i
S0405	sometimes
S0556	you know it trust me
S0405	okay
S0555	i think apparently i know it
S0405	er it's a sad song
S0555	okay
S0405	but then there's like a happy song about sunshine
S0555	what's the happy song
S0405	or something i don't i don't i don't remember what it be
S0555	sing it please
S0405	i don't remember what it be erm and just see how that influence how they look at those image erm which i think be quite cool but might be a bite more difficult to do
S0555	we only have like
S0405	half an hour
S0555	half an hour
S0405	and you know
S0556	be this gonna do during registration
S0405	yeah
S0556	on i think it's be it wednesday
S0405	wednesday thursday
S0555	the thing be realistically
S0405	and tuesday
S0555	in registration you don't have half an hour
S0405	we've get like fifteen minutes to be honest
S0555	yeah
S0405	i don't i don't want us to have too much content and
S0555	yeah
S0405	i'd rather if we go over we just encourage more discussion or something
S0555	so yeah that's okay yeah
S0405	erm
S0555	so we're just gonna talk about how
S0405	yeah
S0555	we link fulfilment towards
S0405	so yeah
S0555	whatever we want
S0405	the overall theme be personal fulfilment we talk about different ways people get fulfil and then we talk about how help charities and how charities help people to be fulfil or how they help how the volunteer themselves get fulfil i mean it's different take we can do on it it depend how we feel really or what we wanna what message we wanna put across
S0555	mm
S0405	erm erm what do you guy think about obviously whoever propose that mean i'll need to
S0555	mm
S0405	stuff all that mental wellbeing talk about more about mental health like differentiate from anxiety what do you think we can talk about in that respect i think the point there we're try to make be that not many people see it as a serious issue
S0556	yeah
S0405	they don't see it as
S0556	mm
S0405	as actually real
S0556	yeah that's true
S0405	but i think those mental illnesses be heavily misunderstand so maybe just a few minutes on what it actually be and what it actually feel to be mentally er you know have one of those condition maybe there's a video we could find erm
S0555	the thing be like if we just play a video
S0405	yeah
S0555	what's the point of have a presentation
S0405	exactly yeah exactly
S0555	but erm if we're do it about mental health we could easily link it to a charity
S0405	yeah
S0555	we could make it kind of i don't know how we would do it cos what would we talk about about
S0405	it's brain stuff
S0555	mental health
S0405	it's brain stuff erm just er what it mean to
S0555	be we talk about like mental health in general statistics in the uk or how it relate to them
S0405	how it relate to them be important maybe i mean who be we target be we just want anyone who suffer from that any anything like that to know it's okay maybe to know that they can get help
S0555	yeah
S0405	cos we can talk about like there's people in school like mrs or or our teachers
S0555	outside of school they could
S0405	mrs or outside school
S0555	i guess cos our cos er everyone would be old enough to make their own doctor's appointment and stuff so they
S0405	uhu
S0555	really need to go through
S0405	yeah
S0555	external body
S0405	exactly
S0555	like our school
S0405	yeah er
S0556	wait what years will we be do this to
S0555	our year
S0405	this will just be sixth form
S0555	yeah
S0405	but er the idea be the other years but that'll be later in the term so
S0556	oh
S0405	we're gonna pitch it differently hopefully obviously you know sixth formers sixth formers be smart i mean
S0555	well
S0405	we don't need to spoon fee them basic primary school information but i still think there's a misunderstand about mental health
S0555	yeah
S0405	so erm we can talk about it's still not enough
S0555	you're breathe very loudly
S0405	er
S0555	you're breathe very loudly
S0405	sorry
S0555	no it i don't mind it's
S0555	i just i be just mention it
S0556	i didn't notice
S0405	okay personal stuff on there be you still cold do you want my hoody
S0555	no i'm fine
S0405	right so personal fulfilment so we're talk about health erm broader issue for now what would you call fulfilment from be with friends or help other people shall we do that separately
S0555	er no
S0405	erm social fulfilment
S0555	yeah
S0556	yeah
S0405	erm obviously this this can all be work on but so
S0405	i know what you're go on
S0555	okay
S0556	it still look nice to be honest
S0405	it's so short there
S0556	it actually i actually think it do yeah
S0405	that doesn't look erm what else should i say social so help others
S0555	what's that word altruism
S0405	yeah er what would we say about altruism though that it's just good to be selfless and or
S0555	mm
S0405	or maybe just be altruistic to help yourself not just to help other people i think maybe there's a there's too much of a focus on oh you know it's all about help that poor kid in africa what about the benefit you get yourself from it so that's kind of what miss talk about in her er scholars' talk last year
S0555	mm
S0405	but so maybe we could link in the benefit of volunteer er probably not for the year thirteens cos they've do most of that but get that message through to year twelve be important
S0555	yeah
S0405	cos this be the time that they have they don't have the time but they have time now and that's gonna be vital when they
S0555	well this be when they're still enthusiastic about
S0405	yeah basically so so talk about erm i mean there's list
S0405	online but
S0556	i don't need need me
S0405	er
S0556	to be honest
S0405	really
S0405	erm so just you get fulfilment from from help other people and then there's load of stats maybe but i don't want it to just be fill with oh ninety percent of blah blah blah i want it to be meaningful but i think there be relevant stats stats about volunteer like erm genuinely make you feel better
S0555	mm
S0405	you're less likely to be depress and stuff like that erm so maybe a few stats er health and social er so back to this mental health thing er
S0556	why be you laugh
S0555	dunno
S0556	it's serious
S0555	ouch ouch
S0405	be that a spider
S0556	do that hurt

S0555	yeah
S0556	and it be just so cute
S0555	oh

S0556	she doesn't
S0555	if any of you guy yeah doesn't know any of the people that i hang out with
S0405	ah
S0555	she vaguely know that exist
S0556	and i remember the time when i come to your house and she think i be a guy and so she put on a
S0555	what
S0556	a a a hijab
S0555	i think she think guy be there
S0556	yeah and then when she actually saw me
S0555	yeah
S0556	she realise
S0555	cheer ah
S0405	ah
S0556	she probably think i be girlfriend then
S0405	so what do you guy what what see yourself in twenty years in a happy life how would you feel you be fulfil in what ways how about spiritual fulfilment since there's er it say a large lot of different
S0405	religious people in our school if you think that's worth talk about i be talk to miss today about erm teach that why miss think it's important to teach allow people to learn their own religion rather than just christianity
S0555	yeah
S0405	mr doesn't agree with that or or doesn't
S0556	who doesn't agree with it
S0405	mr
S0555	oh
S0556	oh
S0405	isn't
S0555	why
S0405	really receptive to it er i'm not really sure i think he just want to teach the spec whereas she's much more about the learn
S0555	oh
S0405	and she be make the point that you know that there's such a the the the number of hindus in our school who don't don't know the actual core teach of
S0555	hinduism
S0405	hinduism but they know how to do the ritual stuff
S0555	yeah
S0405	so that's why she teach smart's dimension because there's so much more to religion than just the ritual stuff erm you know i totally agree with that cos you know in christianity you know you know how to accept communion but you don't know what it i didn't know what communion mean i think i've only realise it in like the last few weeks and i've be take it for years so
S0555	mm
S0405	and only now be i really understand what spiritual fulfilment be what people get out of it
S0555	mm
S0405	so maybe i dunno what's what's an issue with relate in our school
S0555	what's an issue with religion
S0405	yeah
S0555	a deep issue
S0405	as as in like we're try to be humanitarian we're try to improve the things in our school
S0555	well i remember in the documentary there be the guy who the the one where they people walk about and
S0405	walk about
S0555	it be britain be britain be still racist
S0556	be britain still racist i saw that one yeah
S0405	yeah
S0555	yeah there be the jewish guy and then he go to a muslim area
S0405	yeah
S0555	which be affect people you know
S0405	yeah
S0555	i saw that bite
S0405	and i see antisemitism everywhere in our school
S0555	yeah
S0405	do you think maybe so interreligious relations do you think maybe explain see we can't tell them what their religions believe but i believe christianity and islam be all about preach tolerance and
S0555	it's so weird to hear my dad talk about jewish people and judaism
S0405	yeah
S0555	and my sister they have so such a weird
S0405	in what way well what do they believe
S0555	i don't know it's just like the thing be like my dad be like you know what when you sit down with jews some of them be okay
S0555	it's just like what
S0555	it's so
S0405	oh god
S0555	so weird
S0405	yeah
S0555	they just i don't know what they think they just think
S0555	i don't know
S0405	do you think that's be
S0556	do you think then
S0405	exacerbate by the
S0556	do you think do they know a lot of jews though cos sometimes when you
S0555	no no
S0556	don't when you don't know a people
S0405	absolutely
S0556	you just assume
S0555	yeah i don't think they know anyone that's jewish
S0405	yeah
S0555	i don't think i've meet anyone that's jewish
S0405	see jewish that's it
S0556	i don't think i've meet anyone that's jewish
S0405	yeah but even
S0405	even if you do meet a jew how do they have anything to do with what's go on in palestine or israel
S0555	true but the thing be that a lot of erm synagogues be very sort of
S0405	they're very what
S0555	well it depend actually
S0405	so that they
S0555	it depend completely but quite a like quite a lot of jews be very vocal in their support for
S0556	yeah they be i've see it on twitter don't know
S0555	yeah
S0405	but so what cos i don't think
S0555	as well
S0405	twitter's a good representative sample of like
S0555	the thing be
S0556	no twitter be
S0555	in in in some ways it be because
S0556	twitter be trust me
S0405	yeah in some ways
S0555	people will have the confidence to say that what they won't
S0556	cos some people in real life
S0405	i know
S0556	they don't speak but on twitter be when they come out and show
S0405	i know but that doesn't mean that
S0405	you can use it as a representative
S0555	but also
S0556	yeah true
S0555	it's it's sort of like a weird sort of sample where you don't
S0405	yeah basically
S0555	like you get such a weird number of people for from such vary demographics so it's not really
S0405	absolutely
S0556	mm true
S0405	it's as long as it's use in the right way like
S0555	the thing be we're not do a we're not do a sociological study we're just like
S0405	absolutely not
S0555	so
S0405	yeah
S0555	see what people think
S0405	but
S0556	yeah but i don't know any jews so the only place i have actually hear of any say anything be on twitter
S0405	mm but what well the thing that we're try to address be people have a very negative view of jews or they're antisemitic in our school how can we change that
S0555	the think be that like
S0405	or how can we help to encourage a conversation about that
S0555	the thing be like
S0556	mm
S0555	like thirty percent of our school's like muslim
S0405	yeah
S0555	out of that thirty percent how many of them know anything about the israel palestine conflict
S0405	i know
S0555	and out of those people
S0405	yeah it's true yeah
S0555	how many of them be antisemitic
S0405	right
S0555	cos most of semitism be the
S0555	stem from that conflict
S0405	yeah
S0555	rather than anything else
S0556	yeah that's true
S0405	or do you think it's do you think it's it it it's encourage by their culture itself as in not just not just because of this crisis but because of what their families say and speak do you think that antisemitism be be erm it's intertwine with their culture anyway as in they're teach
S0555	well they're only
S0405	not teach but
S0555	no i think
S0405	that that it's express in that way
S0555	before the israel palestine conflict there wasn't there be no real there antisemitism wasn't a major problem between muslim and jewish communities
S0405	right
S0555	before that it be mainly just christians and jews who have a lot of conflict
S0405	yeah
S0555	but now it's muslims and jews because of about because of that
S0556	mm
S0405	so do you think maybe highlight that fact might open people's mind more
S0555	the thing be
S0405	to the fact
S0555	how large of a demographic er if we're try to do something which be gonna
S0405	we're just do it for sixth form
S0555	yeah i know but i mean erm in each class there's only gonna be a certain number of people who be actually gonna know what we're talk about and a certain number of people who
S0555	be gonna be
S0405	but i think
S0555	antisemitic
S0405	everyone
S0556	that's true
S0405	know that something's go on i mean we're not do it on the that crisis but we can
S0555	yeah
S0405	everyone know that something's go on in palestine and it's something to do with muslims and jews
S0555	the thing be er
S0405	and yeah go on
S0555	like antisemitism yeah it's fair enough we can tackle that but something that's much more erm
S0405	complex
S0555	not erm erm something that's much more real for a lot of these people be something like
S0405	right
S0555	islamophobia or just general racism or this stigma against immigrants and stuff
S0405	how about relate the way that muslims probably feel marginalise you know i be read this open letter to muslims about homosexuality and it be just like think of the way that your sister feel your sister when she wear hijab or your brother your beard brother how do they feel marginalise and discriminate against and cast out by society that be the way that some homosexuals feel or how about that be the way that jews feel and they feel in this country as well as in you need to think outside of your own mindset and don't be so hypocritical in that way do you think that's a good way to appeal as in think of the way that you as a muslim may feel erm marginalise by our our by islamophobia in the media
S0555	yeah i guess so yeah
S0405	and then think of the way that you talk about jews who have may have necessarily not connection with the israel israeli government's decisions on what their foreign policy be
S0555	yeah
S0405	erm i mean that's just one slant in don't know if that's the right one
S0555	cos that's kind of like how the documentary be say cos that documentary be say like it deal with like four different group of people
S0405	yeah
S0555	but it sort of use it use the same methods for all of them so it sort of allow you
S0405	uhu
S0555	to like if you identify with one group you could sort of see how it affect the other group in the same way
S0405	oh yeah
S0556	yeah that's true
S0405	and they make that lady black
S0555	and they make that lady black
S0556	yeah
S0405	yeah
S0556	yeah
S0405	and they make her
S0555	i didn't see that part no
S0405	the it be sick
S0556	it be near it be near the end her brain think that she be black or something
S0405	so they they have a board and they have her on there
S0556	yeah
S0405	and they have a fake black hand here
S0555	yeah
S0405	they stroke they didn't allow her to see her own hand but they
S0555	yeah
S0405	stroke er part of say this part
S0555	yeah
S0405	and they stroke it on the same black hand
S0555	yeah
S0405	so it principally make her think that her hand be black
S0555	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0405	and then
S0555	yeah
S0405	they also erm they also do some like facial recognition thing to make her think that she be black and then they do that same test they er
S0405	ia test or whatever
S0555	oh that's so weird
S0405	but erm so
S0556	i might come up with slight
S0555	like moderate i'm so unhappy with that
S0556	no how do you think i feel it's okay for you yeah
S0555	it's not okay for me either
S0555	it's not okay for me
S0556	it's not okay for me either
S0555	mm
S0556	i've get
S0555	yes that's not that bad moderate oh my god
S0556	at least it's not strong
S0405	be you still annoy about that
S0556	at least no one
S0556	do anyone get strong
S0405	no
S0555	no
S0405	i get moderate i didn't do the second test though
S0555	what's the second one
S0405	er i i do the race one
S0555	yeah me too
S0405	no i do the skin tone one
S0556	no we didn't
S0405	i should have do the race one
S0556	oh
S0555	oh you didn't do the race one
S0405	i think i do but apparently i do the skin tone though
S0555	oh
S0405	i do black and white sort of thing er it wasn't black though it be like dark skin so don't know make people think out of their perspective be there any other issue with religious fulfilment i know that's a really broad question but things that we think need to be address or
S0555	erm
S0405	we can change
S0555	i don't know
S0405	erm i mean people always talk about islamophobia i don't think we need to repeat it i don't i don't i don't think we're target a market that need to know that not all muslims be terrorists so we don't need to put that message across
S0555	true true
S0405	erm but yeah relations between different religions be an important erm
S0556	be you cold you're you're freeze
S0405	mate take take my hoody
S0555	i'm not freeze
S0556	you be
S0405	take my hoody

S0405	issue for
S0555	i dunno
S0405	erm
S0555	you can
S0405	other side of fulfilment social fulfilment what do you think people would need to know about social fulfilment
S0555	erm
S0405	the idea that you get fulfilment from be with friends
S0555	well there's also the thing where now like nowadays people get upset like very upset if they er they don't get enough like or something
S0405	oh okay yeah yeah
S0555	so there's like that
S0405	do you wanna make a statement about
S0555	too much dependence on other other people for your source of fulfilment
S0556	mm
S0405	so you think we should be callous about what people think
S0555	except yeah
S0405	but then the argument that we're kind of make be that we get fulfilment from be with friends or not from stuff
S0556	yeah but there's a line to be draw
S0555	yeah cos
S0405	uhu
S0555	depend on their other people too much sometimes
S0405	yeah absolutely what's that message then we're try to put through
S0556	erm
