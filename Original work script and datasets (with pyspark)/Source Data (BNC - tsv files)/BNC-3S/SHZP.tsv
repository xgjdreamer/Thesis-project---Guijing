S0266	right erm so what be we talk about we be talk about the clothe for wed and you what be you
S0267	mother of the bridge
S0266	you go you go yeah mother of the bride and you go into the back of your wardrobe
S0267	i go into the back of my wardrobe and i have erm a this be a christmas wed
S0266	be you sure you don't want a cup of tea or coffee
S0267	no thank you absolutely fine
S0266	mm
S0267	erm it's go to be a christmas wed so it's winter it should be you know the cold side but indoors it'll be warm so i need to take a layer off to be able to be comfortable when i'm inside and i'd go to the back of my wardrobe and twenty years ago i have this wonderful velvet laura ashley coat dress
S0266	oh right
S0267	so mid
S0266	what colour
S0267	midnight blue
S0266	oh
S0267	velvet beautiful velvet cover erm button and satin bias down the front and it be button all the way down and it be erm ankle length ballerina sort of length and as i try it on i couldn't do it up by about five inch in the front so there be no way i'm wear that
S0266	oh
S0267	and i have in the back of my mind that
S0266	can't you have it alter
S0267	i might do no i i don't think you can do anything with it so i'm look for a new outfit so i've decide erm shift style dress which have always suit me i think you know i'm happiest in that erm and dare i say black or midnight blue or a very deep red sequined sequined dress and that's what i prefer
S0266	and what length
S0267	erm just below the knee
S0266	that's sound really good
S0267	mm
S0266	so where have you look so far
S0267	erm online i haven't go to the shop yet i just think i'd see what's online erm and everything because i'm not entirely happy with myself and i'd like to lose just half a stone erm nothing come to mind when i'm look at them you know just it just doesn't come out at me so erm i'm go through all these hundreds of dress think there's not one for me
S0266	oh it's
S0267	and it
S0266	it's a nightmare to to go and choose something though
S0267	it be yeah
S0266	i i i really don't want to have to do it ever again
S0267	er and i i think it's because we have so much time to think about it
S0268	mm
S0267	you know if if i be go just a few weeks before to get a dress and have to fixate on something then i would do so
S0266	but the other thing be that stuff that i look at originally that i think might be quite nice
S0267	mm
S0266	i then find when i be look again have make the mistake and have to buy one in at short notice that all the things that i could have buy six months ago that cost hundreds of pound but all reduce
S0267	yes yeah
S0266	i i and and on the internet for fifty quid

S0267	yes but more expensive
S0266	you can
S0267	yes he's find one
S0266	oh really
S0267	yeah yeah
S0266	oh wow that'll be brilliant
S0267	and you know normally you wouldn't go for that because on a really sunny day you'd just be swelter inside
S0266	mm
S0267	and the temperature on saturday be lovely wasn't it
S0268	it it be just right actually
S0267	it be we we in fact
S0268	yeah
S0267	we talk about it
S0268	yeah the temperature be
S0266	mm
S0268	just right
S0267	yeah
S0268	wasn't it it be just
S0266	mm
S0268	perfect
S0267	so normally if you have a clear roof
S0268	even outside it be wasn't it
S0267	the sun would just make it but
S0266	mm
S0267	at that time of year fifth of september and you know
S0266	december
S0267	shroud by the
S0266	oh fifth of
S0267	no this be for the
S0266	oh i'm get so confuse between your two weddings
S0267	i know i know that's because they're so close together and i'm have a bite of both erm
S0266	you must get confuse don't you
S0267	well both girls be talk about the
S0266	well
S0267	both partner or couple
S0266	mm
S0267	be talk about the weddings you know their own weddings so i'm sort of cleverly switch to one to the other and say look you could have these long vases with you know holly and christmas and look you could have these long vases with erm and 's theme if you have to look for a theme be erm they and their friends have always work on the london market so they're bring market food to the wed
S0268	oh that's good
S0266	oh right
S0267	so the long vases with the oasis and fruit and greenery would actually look quite nice
S0268	mm
S0266	mm
S0268	mm
S0267	so that's what i'm think
S0266	so what kind of food will that involve if it's market food
S0267	erm it'll be a hog roast er and erm
S0266	who do that or something
S0267	well yes we're take for that and erm they want to make some market stall you know just stall only about that wide
S0268	mm
S0267	but say four or five of them where you'd have the baskets of bread
S0268	mm
S0267	you know all type of bread
S0268	mm
S0267	the next one salads and the next one i don't know erm cake desserts i don't know but erm so we're gonna have to think of how we're gonna make these stall so if you have any ideas erm
S0266	mm i'm a bite my brain's a bite empty at the moment
S0267	mm yeah
S0266	i've erm all my ideas have finish
S0267	but yeah i can
S0266	be use up
S0267	i can understand that it's a funny empty feel isn't it when you're only talk amongst yourselves about the wed and you want to hear it from other people who be there
S0266	mm
S0267	yeah
S0266	it's very interest though erm over the days i've be pick up erm you know part that i have no idea
S0267	mm
S0266	of things that actually
S0267	be happen
S0266	happen
S0267	yeah yeah
S0266	from different perspectives
S0267	i'm sure mm
S0266	i i yesterday i go round deliver erm and cake to all the all the ladies who have
S0267	have help
S0266	volunteer their time to do the flower arrange in the church
