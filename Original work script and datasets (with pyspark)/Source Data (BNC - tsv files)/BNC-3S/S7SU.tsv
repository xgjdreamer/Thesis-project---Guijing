S0041	he could help me with with the navy
S0084	well exactly this be it well he be in the army that's another thing
S0041	oh my god
S0084	he be in the army
S0041	this girl be so fun
S0084	i know
S0041	you just keep look up all these different things
S0084	ah he be in the army um so remember he be he also be a bite and cos he's get the mental ex girlfriend who swap her son for a blackberry so that's normal behaviour
S0041	this be this be great this be the greatest way of live through you i've even see in my life
S0084	yeah
S0041	this be fantastic
S0084	so he's a he's a top character so he be in the army and uh because so today we be watch the big question and they be one of the question be
S0041	oh he like the big question
S0084	he like the big question
S0041	that be such a great thing
S0084	i know it's good isn't it um although we differ on a lot of things and i um
S0041	porridge porridge
S0084	yeah it's good i need to get that early um one of the question be be iran a great threat and uh half the people be say yes and half the people be say no obviously um and he be say what they need to do right be like go over into all the countries and like round up all the bad people and just shoot them and i be like right you see
S0041	uh
S0084	the thing be
S0041	pretty strong
S0084	well yeah i be like
S0041	i mean i'm well i'm actually agree with him however
S0084	you be go to join the navy so essentially that be go to be a part of your re think um but the over day we have intelligence agencies we have the cia we have the secret service that be sort of their job
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	um
S0041	they shouldn't get to the point where they're bad people in actual fact
S0084	no no
S0041	if they be do their job properly they shouldn't
S0084	exactly
S0041	need to be shoot because they should never be able to get to where they be
S0084	yeah but basically that's their that's their job be to like round up as much information about these people as possible to stop any action be take against the country you know or externally that's their job he say yeah but they need to like go out of the country like kill them but then they can't kill them i say well i can't sign off on that cos i'm a pacifist i don't believe in the that no matter how bad a person be i don't they don't deserve to be kill for it he's like you know like if i be go to kill if i be go to walk down on the street with a gun and like kill kill ten people what would you do and i be like fuck run away you maniac
S0041	fuck cut you right out
S0084	yeah he say i be like i wouldn't have a gun you know how i'm i go to tackle you he say what if what if you have a gun what would you do i be like i'm not fuck rambo i'm not what go to tackle you to the grind bloody hell and i be like i'll call the police and he be like there's no police i be like right so we're live in some sort of guerrilla state where there's no police or authority he say yeah what be you gonna do i say oh well i'll probably still run away i mean even if i have a gun because if we're talk about me as i be now i couldn't do it but i do qualify the statement with the uh if i do do with the idea that i do it i've never have anyone close to me hurt i've never
S0041	hmm
S0084	you know i mean my sister hasn't be
S0041	hmm hmm
S0084	hurt or my mum hasn't be rap or
S0041	yeah
S0084	i don't know anyone that have be kill and
S0041	for you to have that anger
S0084	yeah i don't
S0041	perhaps where maybe you never will even if you have it but
S0084	yeah you just
S0041	you never know if you would capitalise it
S0084	don't know
S0041	yeah
S0084	you can't make that call really i mean ideologically i would say i don't agree with anybody be kill it's not our right to take away someone's life no matter how heinous the crime but i've never experience something that bad
S0041	yeah
S0084	so um maybe i would think differently oh smell delicious
S0041	the potatoes be well they look like perfect potatoes mum
S0084	well i hope so the secret be power boil
S0041	hob
S0084	yeah and i get in the shower and i put garlic in with them which be why it smell a bite of a burn in here because i whisk them out turn them over another five minutes they be do probably be in the oven for about twenty minutes
S0041	really
S0084	yeah i think i mean they be soft put a knife through them
S0041	oh
S0084	so they should be okay yeah so he be a bite mental so we have quite a lot of discussion
S0041	which be good
S0084	hmm which be good i know and it's quite nice cos i think i this sound really bad i don't think i take anything away from what he his opinions i think he come around to what i think more
S0041	yeah
S0084	than i can come around to what he think cos whenever he say stuff like that i think you've go wrong
S0041	yeah
S0084	just a little bite but i think you know i've get to stop patronize cos he be on the right line
S0041	yeah
S0084	i just think um so stuff like stuff that he will never change his mind on
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know kill bad people cos he be in the army and ultimately i think that's
S0041	i hope i haven't take like too much out of it
S0084	no it will be grand just put the good stuff
S0041	hot
S0084	do you want to shovel shovel shovel
S0041	shovel yeah but i mean really i think it depend on how set you be with your view as well cos
S0084	yeah
S0041	if you're if you really feel strongly about something no matter how much you debate it you're not go to take anything away from it be you
S0084	yeah exactly
S0041	maybe you should relinquish it
S0084	exactly yeah i think with something like that
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	that be basically your condimental ideology like
S0041	yeah
S0084	he's not go to change his mind on that and
S0041	how old be he
S0084	thirty six
S0041	hmm
S0084	right obviously he he's have kid young cos the oldest be thirteen so
S0041	oh right okay
S0084	yeah yes it's all a little bite and
S0041	we don't care
S0084	that's fine
S0041	it entertainment isn't it it's the entertainment factor
S0084	it really be i mean there's not a point where we don't have anything to say to each other it's quite nice
S0041	that's good
S0084	so yeah um it's fine i mean that's fine
S0041	hmm uh how much would you give him on the scale of one to ten hotness
S0084	um probably seven point five eight
S0041	oh
S0084	cute
S0041	wow that's quite good
S0084	i mean he's not someone that you would look at and think god he's hot
S0041	yeah
S0084	i think because he he's get that cheeky chappy
S0041	do you think i need to make some more spag ball
S0084	we can always come back and do a second sit
S0041	yeah we could do that
S0084	yeah
S0041	or shall we just do it at one go in
S0084	oh yeah maybe we should just do it
S0041	just chop it in
S0084	yeah and i mean we have get more potatoes that we can do
S0041	i think i think there be a lot of it cos obviously lot of it be liquid
S0084	hmm yummy it be quite liquid isn't it
S0041	oh
S0084	i guess that happen with the tomato
S0041	hmm and i think as well the mince wasn't very good that i use
S0084	oh yeah they be a bite of uh seepage
S0041	seepage
S0084	oh
S0041	let's burn you up in there
S0084	how can it be sunday night already i feel like it have be a busy weekend isn't it yeah
S0041	i feel like uh i've lose
S0041	yeah
S0084	lose two days of your life
S0041	yeah but it's such a pain cos you look forward to the weekend don't you
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	and we haven't see much of it although yesterday be really nice
S0084	hmm and it sound like you have a really nice time
S0041	i need another day the weekend should just be one more day more
S0084	yeah that would be pretty sweet wouldn't it friday's
S0041	friday's should be a weekend or even
S0084	or monday's
S0041	if it should just be a half day on friday everyone should just have a half day
S0084	yeah
S0041	so then you can get all your shop do or wash do or whatever you want to do if everyone leave work on midday on friday
S0084	that would be pretty nice wouldn't it when i work at cos that's we use to finish earlier in fact you use to work there didn't you
S0041	hmm
S0084	yeah
S0041	i can't remember there i be only there for three days
S0084	i think at the time we do um three days
S0041	yeah
S0084	um shift be suppose to be nine till five but because that we work as temps in the summer it be really busy so we often i often start at seven thirty then when we would we would normally work eight yeah eight thirty actually till five and on a five day we can do four uh thereabout
S0041	oh that's good
S0084	it be really good and then yeah we do overtime
S0041	so i never really understand this about our company especially like you know they say that we really want you to find a really healthy work life balance
S0084	yeah
S0041	but nobody we don't take phone call in our department usually
S0084	oh right
S0041	and uh on a friday afternoon there's nobody there
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	because nobody want to call so actually if we leave the office at about three on friday
S0084	hmm
S0041	i don't really think business wise it won't make that much of a difference
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	and also because we've get a full time reception twenty four hours that can take message so
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's also their job um right let's give you ah that's not um so really they might have because compare to everyone else in the hotel we in our office be the only ones that will tend to spend over the odds time wise at work because we're the only ones that be salaried everybody else be on apart from managers be on like hourly
S0084	really
S0041	wag
S0084	that's weird isn't it how the departments could be that different
S0041	hmm but i suppose how that can be like on the bar we don't know what hours
S0084	that's just shit
S0041	we're go to need to
S0084	yeah
S0041	it depend on which business we've get as to how many hours that they get and stuff so
S0084	okay
S0041	but if they really want us to have a healthy work life balance give that we'll come in on stupid days for events or or stay longer or and nobody else do that cos they just
S0084	hmm
S0041	they finish their shift somebody else take over from them and that's that
S0084	yeah
S0041	you think they would say okay you can the office on friday cos on a friday at three cos we're not go to make any we're not go to lose any money from it
S0084	hmm
S0041	and give the hours and the stress that you're under generally
S0084	hmm yeah
S0041	you just do it
S0084	as a little courtesy
S0041	yeah
S0084	a little thank you
S0041	and then maybe the managers could take that time if they want to
S0084	hmm
S0041	to prep for the next week oh
S0084	uh what be it
S0041	it's uh garlic
S0084	wow
S0084	do you like a bite of garlic
S0041	oh garlic yeah
S0084	the garlic's disappear isn't it uh so you don't answer the phone on friday as a way of catch up with yourself
S0041	no we do answer the phone if it ring but generally it doesn't ring
S0084	oh okay
S0041	yeah cos not many people call and or if they do they call for things like generic things like what's the park like
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos we arrive in at the weekend
S0084	hmm
S0041	but the reception should deal with them they're just not by themselves
S0084	good good i texted
S0041	oh

S0084	no it sound like it go well it sound like he react quite well to whatever you be do even though you laugh at him
S0041	yeah i mean i couldn't really i couldn't really gauge if he be agree with me to save face
S0084	hmm
S0041	or whether he actually think that you know he actually think of it as a friend thing and as a bite of a joke
S0084	hmm
S0041	i think it be probably a bite of half and half
S0084	hmm hmm by the way it be a really really sweet thing to do
S0041	hmm
S0084	and it be think and effort it be really nice
S0041	bless
S0084	he's a nice guy
S0041	hmm turn out i think he have get teeth
S0084	just not all of them
S0041	well
S0084	just not all the teeth
S0041	i be try to eye up a little bite
S0084	hmm
S0041	see what teeth he have get miss and i couldn't notice any of them miss
S0084	hmm
S0041	i mean they're black and fuck but
S0084	hmm
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	would you reckon kiss that guy
S0041	hmm
S0084	christ
S0041	jesus
S0084	hmm
S0041	so maybe he have get teeth and they're just fuck but i couldn't see back far enough to see if they have get hole i mean i couldn't say anything cos i've get a hole cos i didn't have any adult teeth
S0084	hmm
S0041	and my teeth didn't fall out till i be my baby teeth didn't fall out until i be nineteen
S0084	oh
S0041	hmm i've get a massive gap right just there
S0084	hmm
S0041	you see
S0084	you'd never notice
S0041	yeah it's not as big as a tooth like you couldn't get a tooth in it
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos as i've grow it's kinda push together a bite look
S0084	hmm
S0041	have there be it be a big enough for a tooth in it when it start
S0084	hmm
S0041	but i have one one tooth two less
S0084	hmm
S0041	on both side
S0084	okay
S0041	i don't know why
S0084	hmm
S0041	so i can't really you know prey on poor old toothless but uh he i don't even how can you uh
S0084	doesn't he
S0041	hmm i've notice that 's teeth be quite bad
S0084	be they
S0041	hmm like quite black not not black as in all of them black but i'm sure like behind
S0084	hmm
S0041	that bite
S0084	that's fill isn't it like if you don't have a white like it's more expensive to have a white fill
S0041	oh
S0084	cos it's for cosmetic reason so usually if you've just get a mercury fill like the one they do for mine at the back which actually be start to be a bite painful sometimes when i back hmm if you can't see it they just do a mercury fill which be cheaper
S0041	oh
S0084	so if he'd have a hole on the front of his teeth like for example
S0041	yeah
S0084	they would have do a white cap on it they would have fix it
S0041	hmm
S0084	with a white fill but because it's the back he would have make that decision where you can't really see or just have a mercury fill probably
S0041	ooh
S0084	but the thing be you can obviously notice
S0041	yeah i know i just pay for mine white
S0084	hmm
S0041	but plus i've get quite a few fill i think i've get about seven
S0084	i think you've just get to make the call about where it be like even if it be at the back of my front teeth i would have white
S0041	hmm
S0084	because you
S0041	at the front teeth
S0084	know yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	but like this one be the second from the back and so i just think
S0041	oh god
S0084	no it's everybody like a dentist that's it even if you do like a little tennis
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	it's not if they be look down there
S0041	yeah well before i go abroad before i go abroad cos i didn't think i be go to come back i go to the dentist and say just look at if there's anything that need do do it now
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	um cos i didn't know when the the next time i would go to a dentist would be
S0084	hmm
S0041	uh and he give me seven fill in one go
S0084	shit
S0041	yeah and at the time i think that's like that's extreme he say no it's nothing they're just little ones but still
S0084	i don't know if you can actually do that can you legally
S0041	i don't know i don't know um
S0084	wow
S0041	but since the other dentist i go to after that be like holy fuck why have you get all these fill
S0084	really
S0041	yeah and most of them i didn't need
S0041	and they be just a just in case
S0084	shit
S0041	yeah and they be like five at the time
S0084	hmm
S0041	i didn't pay for it but
S0084	such isn't it i mean we have um like those pre emptive fill when we be kid we have um in the back two teeth and the bottom back two teeth and the top we have white fillers but not fill but they're fillers to stop you get cavities in the back and now
S0041	wow
S0084	they're white and they do it to all of our teeth so it be me and my brother and my sister and then my sister she be a little bite older
S0041	oh
S0084	i be probably about seven or eight and would have be five
S0041	i didn't even have my adult teeth by then no adult teeth
S0084	really
S0041	no i didn't start get adult teeth till i be about i probably start get them at about seven or eight
S0084	i think i'm remember it wrong then cos that sound young doesn't it
S0041	hmm maybe
S0084	maybe it be when i be at secondary school but i just remember feel very young
S0041	hmm
S0084	isn't it i can't remember i think it be when i be in primary school
S0041	cos i remember in year six mum be gonna pay for me to have all my teeth paint like coat
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	which might be the same type of thing
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	all of them and he say we can't do it until you've get your adult teeth so i know i didn't have them by then
S0084	oh okay yeah maybe i be a bite older hmm i can't even remember it be it be it seem like a good idea i suppose to my parent because
S0041	yeah
S0084	sort of pre empting i think
S0041	protect
S0084	yeah they have you know they didn't have you know a good dental care when they be kid and i suppose they get have a lot of work later in life which must have be painful and expensive so
S0041	yeah
S0084	i guess they be really into us like brush your teeth you know twice a day um look after your teeth cos once they're go it's you're fuck
S0041	hmm that be awesome
S0084	yeah
S0041	they be awesome potatoes
S0084	yeah do you like them
S0041	they're actual perfect yeah
S0084	they're a bite more soggy than i want but there be a bite of a crunch there
S0041	i like them soggy
S0084	yeah okay good
S0041	hmm hmm
S0084	they probably sit in the uh oven for a while longer
S0041	ah i really need to
S0041	no i don't
S0084	good for you
S0041	i be go to say i really need to learn how to cook them
S0084	it's dangerous
S0041	then i think no i don't i'll just live on them
S0084	when i'm at my mum's she's get a garden so i'll go and pick rosemary and then put rosemary and thyme and put rosemary put rosemary and thyme and garlic
S0041	hmm
S0084	for a nice little flavour and then olive oil
S0041	yum
S0084	so that wasn't bad really
S0041	awesome that wasn't too bad for you be it
S0084	no i think dan's regime be go to be high protein if that's what it's go to be about which be fine
S0041	hmm
S0084	like he try to make me a protein shake earlier and i be like i don't really like drink
S0041	hmm
S0084	just bare that in mind when you're create this diet plan for me and he say no we'll sit down and you can tell me your favourite food and i be like it consist of any sandwich if you can make me a diet out of fish finger and sandwich
S0041	fish finger and sandwich
S0084	that would be fab i'm not feel very confident
S0041	hmm i think i'm go to start my protein shake again i've still get load of them so
S0084	i suppose and they be really good to have before the gym aren't they cos they do give you that energy boost and then you just
S0041	hmm
S0084	you just hammer it
S0041	hmm
S0084	it's really what you want
S0041	yeah
S0084	he say you've get to do it until you feel sick and i be like ha ha ha
S0041	do the gym
S0084	yeah and then i look at him
S0041	yeah
S0084	i realise he wasn't joke
S0041	yeah i know i do i do it until i'm go to be sick but i think that's probably cos my threshold isn't very good like i'll run until i'm gonna i feel like i'm gonna vomit and then
S0041	when i go on the weight like the one that you push this way
S0084	hmm
S0041	i do
S0084	well like
S0041	until i feel like woozy the leg ones i never feel sick on that
S0084	no
S0041	but i pull down i never feel sick on that but the one that i have to push up
S0084	hmm
S0041	literally my head's spin but i have to just i just finish the three set and that's it when i'm like
S0084	keep do that but the ones the ones i do be the ones that i start do at the gym when i first join my well preliminary it's be like many moon ago and um i be talk to about it and he say that you've get to do the flump fly or something like that's the one that go all up which be wing
S0041	oh yeah i've see one of those at my gym
S0084	i don't know if you've get one of those there
S0041	but if you have a look
S0084	like bench press
S0041	or probably i'll show you they be other ones you can do if you've be go cos on our
S0084	hmm
S0041	on our gym they have picture in the corner
S0084	oh okay
S0041	and it show you what muscle group you work
S0084	oh okay so yeah
S0041	so i always make sure i get this one and this one
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	and the back one
S0084	hmm
S0041	but do you know right i've sit here with crazy horse
S0084	hmm
S0041	and he's actually not well he be a crazy horse but he's actually not as freaky as i think he be he's he's weird as far that go and all
S0084	yeah
S0041	jaw of life you know he wouldn't ordinarily go out with him
S0084	you wouldn't trust him
S0041	yeah
S0084	hmm
S0041	um but he's actually quite clear up
S0084	hmm
S0041	he's not i think he be i think i think he be really really thick he's not that thick um he definitely definitely say things that be a little bite say in front of a boy but he doesn't say it in front of me
S0084	hmm
S0041	which be never never wonderful but
S0084	it's never that line
S0041	he use to be in the cadets
S0084	right
S0041	uh train to be in the raf
S0084	hmm
S0041	um and be train to be in the marines he want to be a marine but fuck his wrist and now can't do it
S0084	oh
S0041	and now he's
S0084	that's a shame
S0041	yeah and he doesn't want to go in as uh entry level
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	in the army or in the raf but he's not bright enough to get in as an officer
S0084	hmm
S0041	he's you're not go to say i'm not brave enough i can't do that type of thing
S0084	hmm
S0041	um he be say there's this thing right cos obviously he he's quite build i don't know how cos he look so and i think but um the thing on the gym have you get this with the like the wire that come off and the handle and you get it and you're suppose to do this or something or
S0084	oh yeah you can add we've get load of attachments yeah
S0041	yeah what be so i just think well i'm not go anywhere near that i don't know what the hell it do
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos it look like a frame isn't it with the two like lead that come off it
S0084	hmm
S0041	but apparently if you do that it's suppose to work every single core muscle
S0084	really
S0041	yeah he be like we be tell to just do that even if you're just go for a run do that
S0084	wow
S0041	and he say to do to to pull it up and up and under i think it be up and under
S0084	hmm
S0041	yeah
S0084	wow
S0041	i need to get i need to get on that i need to find out what that's all about
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos you have to use everything to pull it cos you stand up you face up you face up
S0084	oh
S0041	so you're not sit on anything
S0084	okay
S0041	and i think he say that apparently they be tell when he be train for the marines to do that cos it use all your core muscle so you've get to keep yourself stand up
S0084	hmm
S0041	keep yourself in the same position and then move the muscle that the thing be suppose to work
S0084	wow
S0041	i know i think we need to get on that i think i need to ask
S0084	you need to find out ask him about that
S0041	ask him about the the lead thing
S0084	uh there be amaze amount of ways i suppose that and how it all work i've have to see what they've get that sound pretty good there's just load like i be look at it the other day and there's load of bench i could do like bench press there's like three different ones there's one you've get to lie down with your feet up and do it that way
S0041	hmm
S0084	there's one where you've get uh
S0041	have you get one of the lap
S0084	lie down yeah
S0084	like that yeah
S0041	you know what that's suppose to be for do sit up but put your head in the bottom
S0084	shit
S0041	awkward like that yeah
S0084	because i be talk to dan about this
S0041	fuck that
S0084	obviously he's in the army and he be like you're better off do the little ones
S0041	the crunch
S0084	like they're keep you taunt the whole time
S0041	yeah like eight minute abs
S0084	i haven't tell him all that yeah exactly i have tell him about that and how i nearly die and he be like don't worry you're with me you'll be fine and i be like a bite scar actually more than a bite scar but i'm not a bum i cos i never push myself with the weight it's i could do with the with the cardio but i never um i could never do it with the weight so
S0041	i don't think it's as bad as the cardio it just make your head spin a bite make my head spin
S0084	hmm
S0041	a bite sometimes but you sit down so
S0084	i think i don't push myself the same way i do with the cardio if i'm run and i get you know i get umm out of breath or whatever i push myself a bite more than i would if i do weight hmm i'd feel a pain in my arm
S0041	hmm
S0084	i'd stop that
S0041	i only push myself till i'm set when i've when i first start on a thing i'll pick it up and see how much i can comfortably do this with
S0084	hmm
S0041	or whatever it be
S0084	hmm
S0041	and if i can do it then i'll just put the peg in that one
S0084	hmm
S0041	and if i can finish the ten by the by the time i push up on the nine
S0084	hmm
S0041	it should be really hard
S0084	hmm
S0041	and that mean by the time i'm in the third lap by the time i get to five i think i can't do anymore
S0084	yeah
S0041	so it's not it's not too much of a push but i think that it's different with the weight isn't it cos you can't push yourself so far your arm just can't do it they're just
S0084	yeah exactly yeah
S0041	your body physically can't make it whereas on cardio i think no matter how hard i push myself if you're if there's a gun to my head i could push a bite more
S0084	hmm
S0041	do you know what i mean
S0084	yeah
S0041	like your body be capable of do more than your mind let's you use
S0084	yeah
S0041	whereas if you can't push with your arm you can't just
S0084	it's not go to happen
S0041	it's not go to happen
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	oh i'm quite excite to try my new shoe out
S0084	new shoe
S0041	new shoe yeah
S0084	sound like
S0041	i haven't quite get it yet i suppose it happen all day
S0084	hmm this be ridiculous isn't it
S0041	i want to go to for a run by the river and then i think well i'll only i'll only make it as far as the river and need to turn back again because i can't run that far
S0084	yeah
S0041	hmm so then be like why don't you drive down
S0084	yeah
S0041	just around the corner down to the church be and park your car there and then you'd start near the bridge i think yeah i could do that
S0084	yeah
S0041	but it seem a bite ridiculous for me to have to drive around the corner
S0084	it's a bite of waste of your time and petrol
S0041	hmm
S0084	besides you'd be stick in traffic jam you know you could just
S0041	no i just go down to the bottom of the street turn leave turn right and park
S0084	oh i see well you might you might as well just walk back do you know what i mean you might as well walk down to the river and run up and down and then walk back
S0041	walk back
S0084	cos that's your warm up and your cool down
S0041	yeah that's true
S0084	and then
S0041	yeah that's true
S0084	and then you'd be able to tell how much more you can run with each one you do if you run a bigger distance
S0041	hmm
S0084	um if you're plan to do
S0041	i need to do this i need to do this
S0084	yeah even though it's snow stroke rain
S0041	no
S0084	and the good thing be the night's be get shorter uh longer
S0041	hmm
S0084	in fact actually that's just the end of march isn't it the clock go forward
S0041	oh we're nearly there oh
S0084	we're nearly there it's a nice sleep but it's light so
S0041	aw
S0084	i'm a light sleeper obviously
S0041	yeah i can do it for that i can do it
S0084	more potatoes
S0041	oh i'd love some more potatoes
S0084	yeah
S0041	we use to do this after sunday dinner
S0084	hmm

S0041	hmm hmm hmm
S0084	yummy
S0041	oh yum
S0084	they're a little bite crispy that's good hmm
S0041	winner actually i think this be how my salt intake start
S0084	hmm
S0041	because on a sunday we use to i don't know where i get it from i don't know who i saw do it but i've do it here you know put a pot pile of salt and dip the whole potatoes in the salt
S0084	yeah it's pretty nice it's a good tip actually if you're do the potatoes in the microwave cos you do you can't actually spend two hours the potatoes you can cook them in the microwave or have the oven on til it get hot so you can cook for ten minutes wrap them in um in a paper towel with olive oil and then um add salt and it crisp it up and you just wrap it in the oven for five minutes and then just make it a little bite harder rather than have a soft skin it's a good tip
S0041	so you'd cut it up like this
S0084	no no no you just cook the jacket potato as normal in the microwave however long it take to cook in the inside then when it's cook wrap it in um kitchen towel
S0041	still whole
S0084	still whole and then sprinkle um salt and olive oil over it and then wrap it in the oven for five or ten minutes it just crisp it up
S0041	with the paper towel under it
S0084	hmm well that's just to keep the olive oil from run everywhere
S0041	oh
S0084	good tip
S0041	rub it on
S0084	rub it on
S0041	oh
S0084	hmm that's pretty good that's the only thing about cook with the microwave the skin pretty soft
S0041	hmm just remind me again why potatoes be good for ya
S0084	hmm carbolicious
S0041	such a shame
S0084	they're the most addictive carbolicious
S0041	be they
S0084	hmm
S0041	in my head they be hmm
S0084	i think roast potatoes be the best thing ever
S0041	yeah roast potatoes and freshly cook bread with butter on
S0084	hmm oh amaze hmm
S0041	actually it's strange yeah because they're quite a plain taste aren't they
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	so it seem strange that they're the things that you'd be like oh
S0084	this be really comfort isn't it warm and fill
S0041	have you ever have um a jacket potato from town on that uh
S0084	yeah train stop thing yeah
S0041	hmm
S0084	i love it i actually love it the one i like be chicken curry with cheese
S0041	oh i haven't have that see i didn't use to eat jacket potatoes
S0084	right
S0041	um and still now really if i'll make them i'll scoop the potato out in the middle
S0084	hmm
S0041	hmm i like the it's like this i like the edge
S0084	yeah
S0041	but these be small
S0084	yeah
S0041	so i just maybe scoop just the middle chunk of potato out and then my can go in there
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so i still leave like maybe a centimetre of potato around the edge
S0084	hmm
S0041	um and when i work at top shop the girls at top shop be like oh yeah it's really good you need to go there for your lunch those girls at top shop eat like fuck seriously
S0084	do they
S0041	uh huh
S0041	uh hmm it be cos they're so young
S0084	hmm and you've get quite an active job when you work in a shop you're run up and down a shop although you've be quite active now but
S0041	hmm
S0084	maybe less so when you're work in a shop you're constantly run around aren't you
S0041	yeah so i don't i don't know how where the hell they put it
S0084	hmm
S0041	but um yeah cos we'd get them and i'd begin one and not finish it and i'm bigger than all of them
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	and they'd clear the lot
S0084	i know it be good i mean it's expensive it's three fifty
S0041	hmm
S0084	for a pair i think wasn't it
S0041	hmm
S0084	but it be nice when i work at it could get a cold cos i work there from october to march and uh in the winter it be cold at the shop and we'd have to keep the door open cos the be a fuck bitch cos obviously she's pay for heat and she's the one that it's it's she doesn't care about it escape she just want the customers to come in um so even though i mean when it snow she relent finally um she make us put a sign on the door that say you know come in we're still open we're just keep warm um which she copy from ted baker cos that's what they do they put the same sign on the door um yeah so i use to go and get it and i think i discover the chicken curry and cheese thing when i go um when i order tuna and cheese and they be like tuna oh well load of the students get chicken curry and cheese so the cheese go in first and i like cheese the cheese go in so the butter go in the cheese go in so cheese melt and the potatoes really hot and then the chicken curry go on the top so you've get a nice chicken like nondescript sort of chicken curry which be quite mild but with a bite of a kick to it
S0041	yeah a bite like the curry sauce you get from the chip shop yeah
S0084	yeah basically yeah you know fork hand you dig your fork in till you get chicken curry and melt cheese butter and potato oh it be amaze
S0084	oh

S0084	david i mean david he's pretty spesh
S0041	yeah he's pretty spesh
S0084	but he's really hot
S0041	hmm hmm well the fave list matt number two pretty hot

S0041	pretty buff
S0084	i mean you could tell that in his little cardigan couldn't you
S0041	hmm he's build well
S0084	hmm it must be a lot of sport
S0041	football
S0084	ah
S0041	yeah you'd think
S0084	so he must have hit the gym then i mean i know some blokes be quite broad generally and don't have to do
S0046	uh hmm
S0084	a lot of work out
S0041	hmm
S0084	whereas he be really broad and quite muscular in his shoulder but never work out
S0041	yeah
S0084	he just have they just it be quite fortunate
S0041	hmm they be so load
S0084	i mean really they just get that build
S0041	yeah whereas um yeah matt number one be more all round but also you know certainly wouldn't watch question time whatever it be
S0084	the big question
S0041	the big question which be a killer really
S0084	yeah it be
S0041	cos you like that don't you
S0084	yeah
S0041	you like that bite of a niceness
S0084	it's pretty low i mean it's quite nice there be no sort of uh well pff it's nine be probably time for you to get your knickers on
S0041	yeah
S0084	and get out um there be none of it not until like the afternoon he say i've get to go do this thing with the boys yeah i've get a i've get a do a few things i be suppose to go to see my friend today and have dinner and
S0041	hmm
S0084	but she's get a stink cold so
S0041	nice
S0084	so in my head it's more like right well i've get to leave by lunch time probably and then she text me and say oh no i've i'm too poorly so then i be like well i haven't really get any plan because but you know i've get to get out so right two o'clock afterwards we stay out of the rain together
S0041	yes
S0084	and the day before i be like okay it's a bite weird now maybe we should not be do the couple thing um just get my stuff and leave but it be i mean it's really hard cos even though in your head you're like no you don't want a boyfriend and you sort of fall into that rhythm naturally i mean i unless you literally do the hotel shag and leave again
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	the more time you spend with someone the more you get to know them the more you care for them like
S0041	yeah even just in a conversation with someone
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	even if you just spend more time in a conversation with someone you automatically
S0084	hmm
S0041	without want to you know more about them
S0084	it's quite an attachment
S0041	and you see which bits who touch who
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	yeah it's so hard
S0084	it be hard and i think cos even the first time i meet him when i be notice that he be quite skinny and he be say things that alarm me he be say when he start to train obviously he bulk up and then then he can eat whatever he like but hmm mostly um he be quite careful with what he eat and he be say like he lose a bite of weight on his tummy and it be just generally all over cos he's sort of cut back on the food and he really like how he look so he just keep not eat properly and just really cut another food and really enjoy get skinner and skinner and i be like you know this be what people with eat disorder say
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know they like the fact that they're disappear before their very eye and it motivate them to not eat any food because that's
S0041	yeah
S0084	what spur them on and he say yeah i know i know it do sound a bite wrong and yeah i be try you know and i think he really take it to heart which i didn't realise at the time like you say these things and you just think people don't hear your comment
S0041	yeah
S0084	and it's more because you don't him describe it that way worry me cos i think it sound like you might be verge on have a problem and he say well i do know because i'm aware that i'm aware of it you know because it's not like i don't see it um so yeah when you do start to care for people and
S0041	hmm
S0084	he be talk about his kid and he be like you know i can't have them here and would it be nice to sort of meet and whatever cos obviously i'm not ready to meet his kid thank god
S0041	yeah yeah yeah winner
S0084	um so yeah i do it feel good to know him i mean we have a really nice time together but that's all i want to keep it as but at the same time you're like a part of you do want to be the booty call and part of you doesn't it's hard isn't it you know you think well why don't you want to ask me on a date and then when he do you're like we're not do that we're not do the date thing so i think you know i sort of feel for him he just can't really win
S0041	hmm hmm
S0084	but we'll see
S0041	yeah i mean uh i suppose you won't the more time you spend with him
S0084	hmm
S0041	then the more secure you'll be in your decision as to whether you want to pursue this as a date situation
S0084	possibly it could be
S0041	or whether you want to keep it as a friends with benefit situation
S0084	yeah
S0041	but right now i don't think there's any any disadvantage to keep him at arm's length on it
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	until you're sure before you take the the leap
S0084	yeah
S0041	do you know what i mean
S0084	i mean because really this be what always happen like when i be with for a few months and it wasn't just similar to this you know although we never have the initial conversation that i'm not look for love it be more let's get a few date and let's time together and when then i start to realise it wasn't quite what i want whereas in this instance
S0041	should i get my fleece
S0084	okay
S0041	i'm freeze sorry dear go on whereas in this instance

S0084	let's go tell her but she's the one who say she doesn't want to he don't he would absolutely have no idea where he really stand because day to day she's tell him different things
S0041	yeah
S0084	i mean it do uh it do worry me that there be quite as many crazy ladies i mean we obviously all joke that we're crazy
S0041	hmm
S0084	to some vary degree but let's say that we're not totally fuck blimey
S0041	no we're not
S0084	in fact be tell me today another story i apologise in advance
S0041	nah i'm enjoy
S0084	um obviously he's get a crazy ex
S0041	hmm hmm
S0084	so they
S0041	it's not the same as
S0084	it's always time for as one do so they be together on and off she's a bite of a psycho he be with some samaritans
S0041	hmm
S0084	because he have a break down apparently he be on the phone to cos they just have a massive row he be in the live room and the woman on the end of the phone be say dan be you okay and he's like i i don't know i don't know she's say do you feel trap and he say yes and burst into tear his ex girlfriend be on the stairs laugh at him
S0084	and she's they have a massive row she's make him push him to the floor where he's on the phone i can't take it anymore i can't take it anymore i don't know what to do they've get two kid he's cry
S0041	oh my god
S0084	she's laugh at him because she know exactly how to push his button in
S0041	what a dick
S0084	what a dick so he leave um and then much like this they're mental and they get back together he they shag she have be tell him that she's on the pill and she have be ever since the previous child be bear so who's two at this point i think cos three years between them he say can you just take the morning after pill just in case they just get back together and she's like yeah absolutely good i'll definitely do that tomorrow because i definitely don't want any more baby fine he's make a decision to go back there and then he's like oh and then obviously she call me like three weeks later and turn out that she's pregnant and uh
S0041	what
S0084	yeah so she be lie
S0041	oh my god
S0084	the whole time about be on the pill the whole time never obviously take that morning after pill she be like yeah of course yeah i know no want new baby quick cook me a baby
S0041	oh my good gosh
S0084	yes they never get back together so their this third child come along and they're no longer in a relationship together
S0041	yeah
S0084	he think she's a fuck psycho
S0041	well she's a quite clearly a fuck psycho
S0084	yeah but then he be like uh it's all her fault and i be like well you could have use a johnny to be fair
S0041	yeah
S0084	and he be like yeah well i never do you know yeah point take while we be together for a while we never do so it just seem weird like i trust her
S0041	yeah
S0084	that she be on the pill
S0041	well yeah
S0084	i suppose you would really i say well you know you'd see that she be a bite of a psycho but you do go back that be possibly an error before and he'd have a shit time with her parent boo boo boo and i think he really want to stay for the kid he be like i just didn't want to leave and i suppose that's probably what a lot of it be with dads you know it's not fair
S0041	yeah
S0084	if they leave they're it's game over really
S0041	they're the bad person really
S0084	yeah
S0041	and that's the end of that
S0084	they only see their kid once a month
S0041	yeah
S0084	um so yeah so the kid's come along so she be i think they're seven ten and thirteen possibly something like that so they're not they're not young young
S0041	yeah
S0084	but yeah it be
S0041	and you be say he be get custody of one of them
S0084	he's get custody of the son eventually he will get custody of all of them but where he live now they've be tell they can't even have the kid to visit cos at first i be really i didn't believe him and i be like no no no you can't write that into a tenancy agreement
S0041	no
S0084	and he say when he'd have the kid around before and someone shock him they call the agency and the agency like a representative come round and say you can't have kid there so they live in with their psycho mum and so if he get them he's get to spend the entire day out
S0041	out
S0084	with them
S0041	hmm
S0084	i never realise it be what be you go to do with them you've get three kid you've get to entertain
S0041	that's a lot
S0084	so he's move somewhere else
S0041	that's a lot to take on three kid
S0084	hmm
S0041	outside all day that's
S0084	yeah all day
S0041	more financially and like physically and mentally exhaust
S0084	exactly yeah so i think he's gonna take he's on the house and his friend's and i be a bite like mix feel about that but
S0041	hmm
S0084	you know he's ultimately it's about the kid isn't it
S0041	yeah that's it why not be
S0084	if the kid aren't get a good upbringing
S0041	yeah
S0084	with the wife
S0041	yeah
S0084	then or ex wife whatever she be i don't know if they be marry
S0041	yeah like i'm not say automatically go to house and but if that's actually
S0084	the short term
S0041	what's go to be best for them
S0084	yeah
S0041	then
S0084	exactly
S0041	that's what it's there for isn't it really
S0084	yeah
S0084	the their landlord be sell the house where he's live now so he's be evict and that he's he say oh i've get to out on the fourth of march and he say i'm really sorry to have to tell you this dan but that's today and he be like oh right so his eviction notice be today he's get to be out of the house by today
S0041	be he pack
S0084	no he's get no intention of leave
S0041	oh my god
S0084	so at the moment he's squat in his humble house his skin be give him some sort of weird allergic reaction
S0041	he's squat in his own house
S0084	yeah which again
S0041	hmm
S0084	normal so
S0041	i mean and he have think about worst case scenario where the hell he's gonna go
S0084	umm i don't think he's think that far ahead
S0041	yeah
S0084	um but i mean part of him be like well i suppose i've get but you don't want to
S0041	yeah
S0084	go down that road
S0041	yeah
S0084	and uh i mean unless he's literally on the streets
S0041	if he come to that point yeah of
S0084	i'm not go to see anyone on the street be you i mean i don't want to sort of go down that road ruse
S0041	you don't want to offer that as an option
S0084	no
S0041	until he get to the point of he's like shit and then you say okay then
S0084	exactly but he's be serve his eviction notice and so the social have put him on band a and if you think how much drama emily really he have to go through to get bump to band a and just you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	he's out there you think god yeah she's get physically abuse at home
S0041	yeah
S0084	i suppose maybe she wasn't tell him the full
S0041	no she wasn't
S0084	be she
S0041	and fool the doctor's there as well
S0084	hmm
S0041	yeah
S0084	fuck
S0041	yeah
S0084	i think it's cos she didn't want to report her mum
S0041	hmm
S0084	i think she didn't have a police
S0041	yeah
S0084	notice to show that be what it be yeah
S0041	she have police report against him on but she hadn't press charge that's the only thing she didn't do
S0084	god
S0041	yeah mental
S0084	really mental so yes so he's wait for a house and then the son will come to live with him and then i suppose his in his head the plan be eventually all of them will come and live with him
S0041	hmm
S0084	because the mum's totally unstable umm i think he's worry cos his psycho parent he have also weird parent that don't talk to the children or like try and turn them against him i mean obviously you've get to take it all with a pinch of salt i don't know this guy so well
S0041	his point of view yeah
S0084	and all i get be his perspective so all of it i be hop just so i'm not go to question him i don't know him well enough i'm not go that's ridiculous
S0041	hmm
S0084	yes
S0041	you just kind of uh you agree don't ya
S0084	yah
S0041	go along with it
S0084	and in your head you're go what the fuck
S0041	wow
S0084	but um it's weird i think everything in his life be weird and completely unstable
S0041	oh
S0084	umm so yeah i think think that a good thing like once he's get his son with him he'll have to have a more stable job you know i be say to him why don't you do now that you're qualify instructor like why don't you do the um fitness coach and he be like oh i don't know
S0041	there's shit load of job for it
S0084	yeah
S0041	load and load and load
S0084	yeah
S0041	every time i use to get email online like
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	twenty percent of all the job
S0084	hmm
S0041	be fitness instructors
S0084	absolutely absolutely especially around here there's so much money so many people will pay for a personal instructor
S0041	yep
S0084	that actually be and he'll be laugh and he obviously like his job be like craig's if the weather be shit he can't work cos it's really unstable and he's
S0041	and the extra so
S0084	and he's get kid
S0041	fitness instructor without a gym in near near lane
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	not that i've see him for about four years but i go to uni with him when i move down here and he be like you're in cambridge
S0084	oh
S0041	yes but however
S0084	why
S0041	it's just a silly name from uni cos he use that word a lot
S0084	ha
S0041	but his name's ben however be also another way that we call him um but yeah in this down here so he's a bite he's a bite of a weirdo i don't really wanna meet him
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos i can't really gauge what he's go to be like now but um
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	he's very friendly very kind of happy chappy if it be something this guy want to do i'm sure he'd i'm sure he'd help if he could
S0084	yeah i mean if it's i mean there's two options i suppose aren't they you know either try and find a job in gym
S0041	yeah
S0084	or be a private instructor
S0041	hmm
S0084	then you have to advertise yourself
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i think that's for him
S0041	and it's full time
S0084	it's partly the issue
S0041	and it's still go to be a irregular
S0084	exactly it's just a lot of effort you might be work weekend you know and i think that's what put him off like the the money be so good but it mean work and he doesn't want to work weekend
S0041	yeah
S0084	unless it's an emergency but any kind of job where you're self employ it's not go to be stable be it
S0041	no
S0084	or if you've get a kiddie you've get to think about them
S0041	god do you know what it sound like in the nicest possible way you know the popcorn that you get that you put in the microwave
S0041	pop pop pop pop pop there's all this goodness come out
S0084	i don't know it's quite difficult to tell isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos he seem like a genuine person which be quite nice but there's no sort of
S0041	and quite rare
S0084	yeah i mean it's not i be about him that i quite like i'd go just like meet someone and then see everything
S0041	yeah
S0084	there's nothing hide with him
S0041	that's so refresh
S0084	yeah there's a lot go on uh there's a lot to him which you wouldn't which you won't get to know in a short period of time like i'm sure there's load that would take me years to get to know but um
S0041	hmm
S0084	he doesn't hide anything which i find quite refresh
S0041	yeah
S0084	i suppose where the mind go
S0041	that's what you need though isn't it
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	like i don't really i think uh i be a bite naive because i've never really entertain any idea of a boy
S0084	hmm
S0041	at all before
S0084	hmm
S0041	apart from which you know we both know i be there for another five six months
S0084	hmm
S0041	we saw each other for a for a month and then we be together for three and a half months three four months something like that
S0084	hmm
S0041	and live in each other's pocket it be very intense it be very full on and we both know exactly what we be do you know i meet his family then they come up and i cook them like apple pie something really english and
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	you know he would always invite me to go down and stay we both know that as intense as it be it be temporary
S0084	short term
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	hmm
S0041	we both sign up for that but before him nah i didn't keep on anyone it be very much a not a hotel room
S0084	hmm
S0041	but cos he be with people that i be friends with
S0084	hmm
S0041	that i mean we do that the whole kind of friends with benefit thing on and off since we be sixteen
S0084	hmm
S0041	till be twenty two
S0084	hmm
S0041	which be quite a long time for a friends with benefit situation
S0084	yeah so for not for both of you not to have enter into a relationship at that time
S0041	well he do but he be cheap
S0084	right
S0041	and i never sleep with him while he be with her but they be on and off a bite like this jeremy kyle thing she be a child and i don't know what the hell he be do with him cos he's not he's lovely
S0084	hmm
S0041	full of himself
S0084	right
S0041	but in the way that i know i know him and it wasn't actually true
S0084	okay
S0041	and if he try to pull it i'd just knock him down a pick or two
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos we've know each other since we be about thirteen he be actually my first boyfriend that my mum meet
S0084	aaw that's quite cute
S0041	yeah obviously she didn't know that he wasn't my real boyfriend but we didn't care
S0084	not a problem
S0041	not a problem at all uh yeah so now after obviously now he's go a bite crazy but
S0084	crazy knob
S0041	hmm i do i just really think that most people
S0084	uh huh
S0041	most boys the majority be pretty standard as the boys that i've know that i've grow up with cos all my friends have always be boys
S0084	hmm
S0041	apart from a small group of girls like literally now apart from you and and my friends of girls consist of literally my entire life seven girls
S0084	hmm
S0041	um so i'd i kinda just think that lads be much easier to read than girls they be very much there's less of a deviation in craziness
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	with boys and in girls you get this jeze gonna have a baby
S0084	yeah
S0041	craziness
S0084	yeah love you hate you
S0041	to kind of normalness
S0084	hmm
S0041	and uh that's quite a massive difference but with boys i always kinda think it be a a smaller
S0084	a smaller variation
S0041	yeah
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	no no
S0084	see i don't know if it's them get older or what it be but i think you know as soon as someone be have their heart break i think girls you sort of get over it you know but keep it with you always cos it shape who you be
S0041	hmm
S0084	i think you
S0041	come more to a logical plane
S0084	yeah yeah and i think inevitably even if you have be really hurt you do go out there look for it again not to get hurt but
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	the possibility of find somebody and then blokes see it as carte blanche well i can shag whoever i like now because i'm single and i can do it if i like
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	i think that's an element of not really give a fuck and i think that's the problem
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then they then they can say whatever they like
S0041	and do whatever they want
S0084	and so for a moment they will be like yeah of course i really like you then they'll be you know distant again so
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	i think i've just have such a long run start with the norwegian in cuba after a very quick break up with will so i come back from cuba so that be may two thousand and eight this be four years ago and so i've break up with will in february i've go travel for three months come back i'm sort of see this norwegian guy all quite casual he come up to cambridge like five time i go to norway and then when i come back he disappear off the face of the planet so that be a start of the where men be crazy
S0041	yeah
S0084	he be the one who be refer to me as a girlfriend when i be i go up to norway to break up with him and then realise actually i quite like him which be really when he disappear
S0041	hmm
S0084	umm
S0041	choice time
S0084	yes that's when i realise that karma be a bitch like what the hell i go off to uni and then meet blokes along the way and sort of fell fell for this guy who be marry and all that ridiculous behaviour i mean that be quite intense and then back again just sort of odds of sod and nothing really of note my friend he be the one who shatter your navy dream temporarily
S0041	yep but i saw right since then
S0084	exactly
S0041	i've do a lot of dig round of talk and he be actually wrong so i'm quite
S0084	he be
S0041	in fact
S0084	you've get to remember he you know he hasn't be in the army for twenty years and he just talk a lot of bollocks you've just gotta shout him down so he and i have a bite of a thing for a while off and on but nothing there's never really be anything of note but all of these blokes who come into my life and i realise that men be just mental like they just don't know
S0041	yeah
S0084	how to
S0041	have you read men be from mar women be from venus
S0084	no i just think it be a bite cheesy
S0041	read it in fact i might have a copy of it
S0084	be it really cheesy
S0041	it's quite cheesy but it's really really truthful
S0084	okay
S0041	like it's not write as a i think it would be quite write like a fictional novel would be
S0084	oh
S0041	it's not at all it more write like a handbook
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	um
S0084	well it's a self help book isn't it essentially
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's how they market it like a bite pop like which be what put me off really the idea that women cos it's the sort of at book aim at women
S0041	hmm
S0084	you can't get away from that
S0041	hmm
S0084	though i doubt that many men will read it
S0041	i make jordan read it
S0084	through choice
S0041	i make him read it cos we be just get on each other's wicks so much at one point
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	i be like do you know what fuck this we should read this
S0084	yeah
S0041	if this be what we actually want to do
S0084	yeah
S0041	and it help on a lot it help a lot
S0084	well that's good but i don't imagine there be many men who would sit on a bookcase and think do you know what i should probably read it that it's a bite illuminate
S0041	hmm even jordan didn't get on board enough
S0084	no i don't think that they be i think that's probably what annoy me be that these book talk about women things like he's just not that into you that film come from a book there's a self help book it's a pop psych
S0041	oh do it
S0084	book it's that sort of idea understand men
S0041	hmm
S0084	um and know how to read them and i think it's you probably useful in a it's probably interest to work out how to read what other people think generally
S0041	hmm
S0084	but this idea that it's target women who want to find a husband
S0041	oh no this this be more like it give your ideas like if you if you're think if you say this that be what he's hear from it
S0084	okay
S0041	so it be quite nice cos i be quite shock by some of it like it say like men be like elastic band basically they'll stretch and stretch and stretch and you'll think you'll never see them again and then bam they're there
S0084	oh really
S0041	all the time yeah
S0084	okay
S0041	and also like if women have a problem it's annoy the way it's write cos it like on venus women be like this and you think cut the crap
S0084	hmm
S0041	you know what it's say though be little things like if you if you have a shit day and you come home and you run it by your partner you're like do you know what this happen and this happen and i don't really understand why the fuck why she say this or he say that or blah blah blah and really women come home and say it to get feedback you know the other person's opinion on it
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	and to kind of reinforce that yeah that be crazy and but you be right though and do you want a drink and you know and that's it that's all they want they want the discussion about the topic
S0084	hmm
S0041	whereas if you go home you say that to your other half he's go to give you solutions well you should have do this
S0084	hmm
S0041	and i use to get so angry with jordan
S0084	hmm
S0041	well why don't you do this well no cos that wouldn't work because this do you not hear
S0084	hmm
S0041	that she be emotionally this this this well okay we'll do this he he think he's do the best thing in the world for me
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	cos i'm mar if you're present with a problem it doesn't matter how that problem's deliver you're you think that what's require be a solution bam
S0084	hmm
S0041	do here you go that's what you want this don't ya
S0084	yeah
S0041	whereas that's not what the woman want at all
S0084	yeah just emotional support
S0041	from that conversation
S0084	hmm
S0041	yeah and it say that they're like if if a guy have a problem it's not that he won't talk about it because he doesn't want to but a man's brain in order to find the solution won't bounce ideas they don't want to do that
S0084	hmm
S0041	their brain be program not to bounce ideas and they their their brain be basically make to self consult
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so the guy will be really quiet and go into his cave
S0084	okay
S0041	which be what they say will go into his cave
S0084	hmm
S0041	and will do you want me move to this table a little bite
S0084	that's alright i'm just gonna lean against the radiator a little bite just so that i don't get too cold be you warm enough in here
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	yeah okay
S0041	um yeah basically they self consult until they can find the solution cos again
S0084	hmm
S0041	face with a problem they they want the solution really kind of hand on
S0084	it's quite logical isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	hmm
S0041	but if you try and talk to her him
S0084	hmm
S0041	while he's in that that process then he will want you to fuck off
S0084	really
S0041	he will actually want you to fuck off he doesn't want your help or even if you're not want to give help you just say you know how be you feel or
S0084	hmm
S0041	hate hatred like that will really fire a man up
S0084	oh really
S0041	because the fact that he the fact that you would ask that implant that
S0084	you don't
S0041	you think he require help
S0084	he's incapable of it yeah
S0041	one he's not capable two you don't trust him
S0084	hmm
S0041	three he's fail at life
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos he's a man that's what he should be able to do
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	so basically he'll just himself up until he get to that solution
S0084	oh
S0041	which be
S0084	but what do you say i mean like men put it this on a bookcase for example like if you try to offer any help say
S0041	hmm
S0084	no no
S0041	yeah
S0084	directions should we ask for help no
S0041	no
S0084	i know where i'm go we you clearly don't because this be the third time we've see that post box but fine okay
S0041	yeah
S0084	we'll just go round again shall we
S0041	like extreme version of it and uh
S0084	hmm
S0041	i realise actually a lot of things we be come to blow to because a lot of the things that we be struggle with be because of the things that be go on with my family
S0084	hmm
S0041	be we be just read each other really differently and then it give you like a list of you say he hear he say you hear idea
S0084	hmm
S0041	um and a lot a lot of our arguments be resolve because instead of think that's not what i mean
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	we start more along the line of think that's not how i intend you to receive it
S0084	hmm
S0041	so it be more about it doesn't matter whether you mean it or not or whether you mean it to come across like that it doesn't matter the way somebody receive that information
S0084	hmm
S0041	be more valid
S0084	hmm
S0041	than how you intend to say it
S0084	absolutely
S0041	and so
S0084	but that's quite an interest point isn't it it's like when blokes get annoy with you for be over sensitive about receive a comment you know like with today for example but it's happen to me before in the past people be like when blokes have say to me you know that's not what i mean or something you're just read it wrong
S0041	yeah
S0084	or you're be over sensitive and you think well but that's how i feel like why can't you understand
S0041	yeah
S0084	that that's how i feel like you say those word make me feel this big
S0041	there's a whole part there there's a whole chapter in the book
S0084	hmm
S0041	about don't invalidate her feel
S0084	ah
S0041	cos men men do this they've have this exact conversation
S0084	hmm
S0041	except when we hear them say and i didn't mean it like that or don't be daft you know
S0084	yeah
S0041	i'm think i'm not stupid
S0084	yeah
S0041	because they don't realise that actually what they're make you feel be that you're because you're feel that way it's not a valid
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's not valid and it make you feel like this this big
S0084	yeah and you're in the wrong
S0041	yeah
S0084	and that's not okay
S0041	no but it's really it be really helpful like
S0084	well that's interest
S0041	i think everybody should be make to read it
S0084	that be really interest cos i completely dismiss it out of hand
S0041	hmm
S0084	always always have but i mean that's cos i'm quite a book snob when it come to things like that i mean i would never read any pop psych but that's not to say that i don't think that it help people
S0041	hmm
S0084	i just i never think that it could help me but maybe it do
S0041	and it have even get
S0084	yeah so i'll do that
S0041	not a relationship wise because they've describe on the page on the same chapter that men be like elastic band women be like wave so every woman in a relationship or not the way their emotions be run
S0084	hmm
S0041	be be like a sea
S0084	hmm
S0041	so they'll be a calm and instead of a lull before the storm which be not quite accurate this guy be say and i think that you'll have kind of a really good period in your life
S0084	hmm
S0041	and then that kind of peak drop so it kind of get a bite better and then you know you're really have a great time you're feel really good very confident and then something will some trigger and obviously everybody's trigger be different will happen and it won't even just be oh that's a bite bad you'll just
S0084	you'll just plummet
S0041	smash like a wave crash and once you crash like that you have to kind of learn to get your head round the fact you that you won't peak again until you've even out a bite and then it will gradually build up again
S0084	oh god
S0041	which be really it isn't a really strange thing to think of
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	but it's also nice and in the comfort that those days when you're like holy crap
S0084	hmm
S0041	you know the world's end
S0084	hmm
S0041	and you smash to the bottom and what you do be you automatically sort friends and opinions and talk through things
S0084	absolutely yeah
S0041	that it be quite comfort especially with what i be go through at the time to know actually everybody do that
S0084	yeah
S0041	that be the way women work
S0084	hmm
S0041	and i think you also compare it to be at the bottom of a of a well
S0084	hmm
S0041	if you're if you're in the well just learn to accept the fact that you're in it
S0084	hmm
S0041	it's not it's not it's inevitable that the wave's go to come back up again
S0084	hmm
S0041	but women just seem to go there and forget that whereas men would never crash and burn
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	they're always quite toe whether they're interactive or not be the thing that change
S0084	hmm that's interest isn't it
S0041	whereas a woman will always be very interactive
S0084	hmm
S0041	but whether she's on a real positive or a real negative be quite severe
S0084	wow
S0041	how weird be that
S0084	yeah i mean it doesn't come to think well it's reciprocal you know it's it's gonna happen and if you're go to keep go and so no matter how bad it feel any time it's go to get better you have to believe that it's go to get better
S0041	yeah
S0084	and so you know you be go to pick yourself up and you be gonna the situation be go to improve itself
S0041	hmm
S0084	you know you things be go to get better
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know it's quite an encourage think
S0041	yeah
S0084	that other women and other people have be in a similar situation and
S0041	yeah
S0084	it get better it get easier you know whatever it be that you're deal with
S0041	that's quite
S0084	i guess when you feel quite alone like a lot of the time and sort of read it
S0041	hmm
S0084	from another perspective like be able to understand the person that you're with a lot more
S0041	especially like if you're in a relationship and you know that really there's so much that go on behind close doors that you can't run by someone else
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	even if you want to
S0084	yeah well it's very personal isn't it
S0041	hmm
S0084	hmm
S0041	which i think be quite a which be where samarra and i come into the if you ever want to get marry then i'm go to come and live with you for three months
S0084	hmm
S0041	because she saw everything one first hand all their arguments everything
S0084	hmm
S0041	which be quite difficult for her at some at some point
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos obviously she live with us and you can't like get like distance
S0084	hmm
S0041	if we need distance but samarra and i be close enough that if that be the case we'd just go
S0084	you just know
S0041	to your room
S0084	hmm
S0041	yeah but and she saw some things that i never tell her she say i i didn't imagine how child like he be with things and how picky and i be like well there you go
S0084	hmm
S0041	i mean she's very much like she's we're like the same person cos i think when you start to mature
S0084	hmm
S0041	we we be mature at the same time in the same surround live in each others pocket so inevitably you both kind of get bits of each other so
S0084	yeah yeah absolutely
S0041	but yeah but the thing be i make jordan read it and he still he still carry on repeat this same type of behaviour that be cause arguments
S0041	and sometimes i'd have to say which make which sound awful cos you don't want to do this hear this from the person that you love say do you not read the book you know the reason why we're argue be this
S0084	hmm
S0041	and he's like oh yeah when it it feel a bite not very comfortable that you'd have to bring that up
S0084	hmm
S0041	when you really i'm think you've get a brain how do you not get to that yourself
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	not that this book be like the be all and end all but in some situations they be kind of really stark stark comparisons
S0084	hmm
S0041	and he he didn't get it hmm it be a bite weird but it's definitely worth a punt i mean i wouldn't take you know everything it's say it's all
S0084	yeah
S0041	you know everything's gospel
S0084	yeah
S0041	but
S0084	maybe i will it might be quite illuminate
S0041	hmm
S0041	i use to read it and would just go to samarra cos she be live with us at the time you're never go to believe this
S0084	no
S0041	you know if you say this to a boy this happen and this happen you know they're actually think this and jordan would sit there and go yeah
S0041	it be really strange like he would sit there and we would have this forum sometimes cos some of the stuff that i'd hear i be so shock by
S0084	hmm
S0041	i be like what no way and some of it jordan get a bite upset by cos it be i think he think of it as a personal attack
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos he do that and i be like no no i'm not try to say you're wrong for do it you're obviously not look this be just how you're program but this be real news to me
S0084	hmm
S0041	real news
S0084	hmm and it do help doesn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	it help you understand him i think because that's what's important like if you're say you know my relationship be important enough to read this book i'd think actually i want to understand where you're come from
S0041	hmm yeah it be um my copy might be at jord's but i need to go i need to get my camera from his anyway hello
S0084	british gas call
S0041	do i just see bebo there
S0084	no it's call badoo
S0041	what's badoo
S0084	it's a the date thing that i'm on
S0041	badoo
S0084	yeah i can show you picture of hang on all these be the boys who be try to talk to me i'm go to delete them in a minute you see all these i never just see where all the photos be first
S0041	first some truth ones
S0084	okay that be actually what he look like see that one he look a bite like a criminal
S0041	i want to see the criminal one
S0084	he look a bite like a criminal and then if you scroll leave
S0041	like that
S0084	no the other way it's the right then
S0041	i don't really know
S0084	look for my leave and my right
S0041	ah
S0084	so he have face fuzz now
S0041	face fuzz
S0084	but he do say that he shave it off cos the girl his little girls who be seven and ten say dad dad we can't kiss you with your face it's all hairy
S0041	ah
S0084	yeah so he shave it off so he's give him a like a kiss and a cuddle
S0041	yeah he's a he's not what i imagine he's cute though isn't he
S0084	it's he yeah i think he's cute and i think he's funny which obviously help
S0041	yeah he be cute
S0084	i think he doesn't look like a criminal i think that's what people think when they see him and i think they probably really judge him
S0041	what's it's badoo b e d o
S0084	um b um b a d so he's my my phone
S0041	alright
S0084	my phone be bad cos if whenever you say badoo bad
S0041	yeah that's standard
S0084	pretty standard so he's in his list of things that he like to do cos you can put like interest
S0041	oh right
S0084	his interest write screen play photography spell incorrectly
S0041	yeah
S0084	write novels mix martial arts so that be what he do hobbies travel x box all the things and then they train so that be the
S0041	yeah that be
S0084	tradesman he spell great with three r's like
S0041	great
S0084	like
S0041	like
S0084	yeah he's put college and university as his education
S0041	lie
S0084	i don't know if it's lie he might have college in fact actually he have get um hmds i think
S0041	oh some maybe that's that's half uni so that's like
S0084	yeah
S0041	the if you do a three year degree hmds and do two
S0084	oh
S0041	cos that's what do
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so we do or i do gcses a level four year degree
S0084	yeah
S0041	jordan do gcses college incorporate foundation degree h and d one year and top it up to a degree
S0084	oh right why do he do that then
S0041	so usually if you do ah i don't know where do he i i i think the idea the split be if you do something that's more vocational or art base
S0084	hmm
S0041	like illustration or graphic design or health care that instead of do a level people tend to do an mbq
S0084	okay
S0041	which be i think mbq three be the same pitch as a level
S0084	yeah okay
S0041	which although i be a snob and didn't believe it currently apparently that's true whatever um and then after that you'd go straight to uni there you would do a either a foundation year if they need to top up
S0084	like an md and then hnd
S0041	yes that's it
S0084	hmm
S0041	yeah so whereas if you go to uni and you don't finish your third year
S0084	yeah
S0041	you walk away with a diploma
S0084	yeah
S0041	you can actually which i think be like a failure i know it sound awful but you never you never go to uni intend to walk away with a diploma do ya
S0084	no no
S0041	you don't
S0084	well no
S0041	but
S0084	like when you do a post graduate degree like if you do all of the modules without the dissertation you can get a diploma so you can get a post graduate diploma but you don't get a master's qualification
S0041	hmm be that it
S0084	social yeah
S0041	i never know what that be
S0084	it's a pg dip so you get a post graduate diploma which just mean that you've do all the course work and all the class up until like main or whatever
S0041	that's what my friend get but he go for pgc so
S0084	oh okay
S0041	he didn't really want a master
S0084	yeah exactly fine
S0041	and he just get it that's fine
S0084	so yeah if you're teach that's all you need
S0041	hmm
S0084	so you wouldn't you don't spend the extra like six months do it
S0041	hmm
S0084	unless you've felt like if as a sense of you're do it for yourself
S0041	yeah
S0084	rather than it's what the need to have a vocation qualification which i think really my master be a bite of both i want to be able to prove that even though i get a use to be like i get at desmond at um undergrad i get a two two um because i basically get every grade across the board
S0041	me too
S0084	so i've get my transcripts cos this be when when i apply for my um ma and there's mark in the eighties and there's fail
S0041	me too yeah
S0084	across the board and my tutor mister would literally be tear his hair out he say what it like he say you be obviously competent you can obviously do it so why aren't you do it and i say like well i've
S0041	aren't interest
S0084	like really struggle have a difficult time emotionally and he say really no i just get really piss sorry about that he i think for them it be frustrate because you're clearly there just to have a good time and learn a bite along the way
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i think that's why i wouldn't go to university i have to go now
S0041	yeah
S0084	because to come up with fifty grand worth of debt just isn't viable for a degree that it's very nice but mean nothing to me
S0041	yeah
S0084	so when i go back i suppose it be a chance for me to prove that i could get a good degree and prove to others even though you don't need to
S0041	yeah
S0084	just think you should so it be partly to go back to prove that i can apply myself because i want a vocational qualification to publish to actually get a job a career at the end of it
S0041	yeah
S0084	rather than to get a degree for the sake of it but also to sort of better yourself and to and to learn
S0041	yeah
S0084	to engage your brain again have work in a shop for three years and it be great and i just i've just really really enjoy it and be busy all the time and uh i speak to my mum and i get up do this and do that we go to this and you know we're do that and i'm go to the theatre tonight and you know cos my friend al work there so i stay there all the time and could meet all the people backstage and it sound very excite it be a really excite life and i guess when i move to cambridge it all stop just like it be whenever you finish uni you just think
S0041	hmm
S0084	be this it now
S0041	be this what i be train for all this time
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	be this what i'm give
S0084	so i've come out with like eight grand worth of debt so like my career development language the loan i take out to pay for my master cos i go travel and it wasn't until i get back in like the june i say maybe i should do something with my life oh my god let's do a master well i can start in september brilliant i haven't get any money take out a loan and i take out take out eight grand i think take out ten take out enough money five grand for my tuition fee and three grand for live live cost and then i work so that i could afford to eat
S0041	yeah
S0084	um but it's a five year repayment plan from a hundred and fifty pound a month
S0041	hmm
S0084	so i've only do two and a half years i still have two and a half to go
S0041	i think it's manageable be it it's manageable but
S0084	it's not a ridiculous amount but when you think you've get rent
S0041	i know
S0084	you've get student loan and food and
S0041	i'm pay 's mum a hundred and twenty five a month
S0084	for the car
S0041	yup
S0084	for how much longer
S0041	i don't really know i loan three grand
S0084	hmm
S0041	i've be pay it back cos i buy the car october november december january february march so basically a year and a half
S0084	wow
S0041	i've be pay about what's that
S0084	over a hundred and twenty five pound a month you must be nearly there
S0041	for twelve months say say fifteen months cos i've i don't think we start pay it do i start pay it back till christmas
S0084	if you think a hundred pound a month
S0041	and she let me miss one you know
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	back at christmas i didn't pay her on christmas and she be like no that's fine tell she doesn't have to pay over christmas
S0084	nice
S0041	she wouldn't let me pay it must be hard
S0084	if it be a hundred
S0041	so
S0084	pound a month it would be thirty months wouldn't it which be
S0041	yeah
S0084	twelve twenty four fourteen so like two and a half years but you're pay over that
S0041	so it's probably go to be two years
S0084	it's go to be two
S0041	and i'll probably pay it back in a year
S0084	two years hmm
S0041	i'll probably be do this for another year which be fine i mean to be honest i've if if i'm go to start navy then i'll just bulk pay half
S0084	hmm
S0041	uh um but also i owe my friend about four hundred pound or five hundred pound which i think i have pay off he's just keep to himself all this time cos basically when i move down here i have a grand save
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	well that didn't last
S0084	no it wouldn't not with deposit and then first month's rent
S0041	that be it so he pay my deposit and he get that back and he pay my first two months rent for me and i think he lend me something else so basically i loan about a grand off him
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	i think i'd pay it all back it turn out i haven't i think he say i still owe him about five hundred quid i i mean i trust him
S0084	yeah
S0041	um but when i move job remember when my bank account get all that thing with with the stupid lose my card
S0084	oh yeah yeah
S0041	shit and they stop everything so they stop pay him
S0084	oh right
S0041	and he just that's why i'm really piss off with him cos he didn't like say to me then
S0084	the money's not come into my account
S0041	yeah he's just like kinda let it all build up and let it fester and
S0084	uh hmm
S0041	and i mean i didn't start pay it back straight away i start pay it i loan it for two years before i start pay it back cos he know the position i be in
S0084	yeah
S0041	so until and i no a year until and i move to we didn't start pay it back and i don't know like he he just hasn't bother to get in touch on friendship basis more of a you owe me money
S0084	hmm
S0041	and which i be resentful for not only because he he he hasn't be be a friend but also because he doesn't actually need it like he's a teacher he earn twenty four grand twenty five grand
S0084	hmm
S0041	he know i'm take home half of what he's take home
S0084	hmm
S0041	and he's he's seem to be money focus
S0084	hmm
S0041	which i i don't mind cos i owe him the money like i don't resent him ask for it at all
S0084	yeah
S0041	like i didn't now i wasn't still pay him
S0084	hmm
S0041	but it's more like he know me he know me very well and if i have know that he have a stand order i would have do something about it
S0084	yeah
S0041	i think but why would you not just say it to me
S0084	yeah and and then just leave it so that he's get annoy more and more annoy
S0041	yeah
S0084	rather than talk to you about it
S0041	yeah
S0084	and just find out what's go on
S0041	yeah i don't know
S0084	so now he's get rile unnecessarily
S0041	yeah so now because he's rile i'm more resentful to give him
S0084	hmm
S0041	i mean i will anyway but
S0084	hmm yeah
S0041	i'm kinda more like well hang on a sec you're piss off with me because of a hundred pound a month
S0084	hmm
S0041	um shouldn't i be piss off with you over the fact that you're that much of a great friend like
S0084	you never call to find out why you couldn't repay
S0041	no so literally because of how long i've not speak to him for i get really annoy and send him a message back to his false friend message and i be like yeah my dad and mum be get divorce um my dad's still not get his thing through from the court yet so he's basically live in a house with no furniture trisha's crazy and he's actually die um i'm join the navy and yeah like imagine all those things
S0084	hmm hmm
S0041	all in one go and he be like oh sorry i'm sorry you're have a shit time of it i felt like say you would know
S0084	hmm
S0041	exactly if you be be a good friend
S0084	hmm
S0041	as oppose to just focus on a couple of hundred quid
S0084	hmm
S0041	which you don't actually need see as you're you've be on two holiday already this year
S0084	be he where be he live again
S0041	read
S0084	oh i think he be live teach abroad for some reason
S0041	no cos i mean they go i mean they go away a lot he they go to disney always go to disney world like florida he's he doesn't need the money
S0084	hmm
S0041	it's as far as be talk about four hundred pound
S0084	hmm
S0041	perhaps it's my grasp on cash but
S0084	no i mean if he really need it there's no way he would be go on holiday
S0041	and it's not just the odd holiday you know the odd trip to belfast i'm talk
S0084	hmm
S0041	since i've move to so in a year and a half of i know he's be away for about five or six long weekend on book holiday to florida
S0084	fuck
S0041	madrid berlin uh i think they go to i think they go to paris for valentines
S0084	this be him and his fellow
S0041	and his boyfriend yeah quite a few
S0084	oh
S0041	i think go to disneyland paris not just one you know one every couple of you know every six months they have a weekend away i'm talk
S0084	hmm
S0041	it's he's get he's i saw on his facebook he's be ski do you know how much that one cost
S0084	a fuck load because it when you get to the resort beer be like eight pound a pint isn't it
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	eight euros a pint
S0041	yeah so it's a bite like yeah you don't actually need the money at all and if you don't bother speak to me
S0084	hmm
S0041	actually on a friendship level you would have probably have say
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	forget four hundred quid just give me twenty quid a month or something like you can and just so so the balance go down
S0084	cos yeah absolutely i mean that's the thing it's not like you the only way he can get a hold of you be by phone do you know what i mean
S0041	no
S0084	cos obviously he's be contact you on facebook isn't it
S0041	hmm
S0084	so
S0041	and then um another thing that really annoy me be he only let me know that this stand order wasn't go through mid last month
S0084	oh right
S0041	yeah so i be like oh i be like shit i'm really sorry like i didn't you know of course i didn't know
S0084	hmm
S0041	he be like well no i expect you didn't but i do send you a few message and i didn't get a reply i call your phone number
S0084	hmm
S0041	and i say i lose my phone i say you should have send me a message on here
S0084	yeah yeah yeah which you would do wouldn't you

S0084	if you're worry about someone if you're worry about a friend you haven't hear from in a few weeks and wasn't respond respond to your message
S0041	yeah
S0084	would you not try every avenue
S0041	and as of as a rule i'm sure he's actually get the phone number perhaps not this one but certainly the one before which i have before
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	so
S0084	okay
S0041	certainly have that phone number
S0084	or would he have would he have 's number
S0041	yup well he hasn't contact but get a nice long email from both him and his fellow ask how he be and be everything okay and obviously
S0084	what
S0041	even even get a message to he didn't know we'd break up he didn't know we'd move apart that's how little he's be in contact
S0084	fuck
S0084	so that's a good six months
S0041	yeah
S0084	we've be here six months haven't we
S0041	yeah so really for it i'm just more piss that that be not that's not friendship
S0084	hmm
S0041	you know i'm really crap at keep my friendships i'm really really rubbish
S0084	yeah me too
S0041	you know i'll not speak to people for months at a time and they think i've disappear off the face of the earth but
S0084	hmm
S0041	get a nice long email from them both hope you're all well lovely lovely lovely lovely
S0084	that's so weird
S0041	i hope 's alright do yeah
S0084	because it be a you know gather all this anger against you because the stand order which as you say if you do actually just bother to get in contact you would understand why
S0041	yeah
S0084	and really if your other money be not come through really you start to think okay well there's obviously be a bite of a problem i'm a bite short on cash but you would call you would give them a text
S0041	yeah
S0084	so if they didn't respond to a text you might think well a bite weird
S0041	yeah
S0084	might send another one
S0041	yeah
S0084	might try and call if he'd call your phone it would be off
S0041	uh hmm
S0084	and he would think that's suspicious

S0041	all the vitamins you'll ever need
S0084	yeah
S0041	i think i'm go to be quite lazy and get a a nice bath
S0084	hmm sound grand i'm just go to get into bed snuggle under and write all the birthday card it's gonna be a week of cake that's go to be quite difficult to resist cos my college 's cos it's if it's your birthday you have to bring in cake for the whole department
S0041	yeah
S0084	which actually be quite dangerous cos of the
S0041	be in cake land
S0084	cos it's there's quite a lot of birthdays generally so there's always cake we also have a biscuit tin as well and whoever eat the last biscuit get to replace the biscuit tin
S0041	hmm
S0084	so that's also quite dangerous so it's jo my 's birthday be yesterday so i'm sure she'll have make cake but she's the biscuit goddess that's fine thank love um so she'll probably bring a cake tomorrow it's 's birthday on sunday but she's obviously fly to new york like my boss uh fly this weekend so she's and it's we have um every three months we have an away day for the team and we go go to like the build in town and the build and we go there and discuss the latest issue a good chance to sort of sit talk down and talk about what's go on in the team and we're have one on friday which mean be out of the office all day so she's go to bring in cake on thursday so she could go on and it's just so hard i suppose if i do go to the gym
S0041	yeah
S0084	three time this week and don't eat
S0041	yeah you could
S0084	anything naughty apart from that
S0041	yeah
S0084	of course it would be okay isn't it
S0041	it's definitely doable
S0084	i can do wednesday friday i've get other plan for friday but
S0041	yeah
S0084	but thank for wash up love
S0041	um i'm gonna do gym tomorrow
S0084	hmm
S0041	gym tuesday i think for
S0084	gym gym
S0041	take up to see kate on wednesday i can't remember she send me an email on friday about come to adam brook for something
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah something to do with the thyroid
S0084	hmm
S0041	um but that yes so she you know you know we should meet up
S0084	oh that would be nice
S0041	yeah
S0084	have laundry tomorrow dirty shirt yeah dirty shirt
S0041	i need to to the gym so all that i do quite enjoy the gym and turn laundry i think that's
S0084	hmm
S0041	i think that's pretty good i think sunday's should be make for gym time and laundry
S0084	yeah hmm that's basically their their routine everyday isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	their daily routine i mean they've get it pretty sweet haven't they
S0041	yeah
S0084	like no real major issue to speak of all they've get to do be sell t shirt in a shore store
S0041	which one i find they're normally quite bore
S0084	have you see the one where they go to italy yet
S0041	no
S0084	yeah you have to watch that one
S0041	the thing be i keep think to watch it but then like oh larry uh
S0084	at yeah
S0041	hmm
S0084	that's foolish yeah
S0041	i be think about get a notebook you know
S0084	hmm
S0041	like a really baby laptop
S0084	hmm
S0041	um
S0084	they're good you can't watch but you can't play dics on them
S0041	hmm
S0084	or anything cos they're that small
S0041	yeah cos and then i think cos i'm go to get a new laptop or something like that
S0084	hmm
S0041	i should probably get one with a disk drive on it so i won't have to
S0084	you never know when it might come in handy
S0041	yeah cos i think about get um quite an old mac
S0084	hmm
S0041	just like the basic one
S0084	yeah
S0041	um for a couple hundred quid
S0084	hmm
S0041	cos i don't use it for i don't need it for anything particular anymore like uh when i be at uni i need a disc one for the work and stuff like that
S0084	hmm
S0041	but now
S0084	hmm
S0041	literally word internet
S0084	hmm
S0041	dvd do
S0084	yeah
S0041	so i do i'll have to get one before i go away anyway
S0084	yeah definitely maybe they'll do you a special deal probably cos actually they in fact i know they do because like my friend her brother's just join the navy navy officially have his pass out in december and he get a specialty with volvo specialty with hewitt packard what else do he get a special deal with lot of big manufacturers do deal with the navy uh well arm force in general
S0041	you probably need to ask him how difficult that train be
S0084	very difficult but he leave it do he get he didn't get gangrene he get something really bad like foot wart like really really bad when he be do his train he get some sort of leg injury and he's a bite of a psycho he keep push himself and they be like no your leg might fall off you probably shouldn't do the thing now i think he
S0041	oh god
S0084	cos he go in but not in as an in as an officer and he love it and it 's now date his one of his mat from the navy but will her brother didn't know for age like it's quite funny
S0041	oh yeah they be only say about this now
S0084	hmm
S0041	yeah i probably need to find i he probably need to tell you on a scale of one to ten
S0084	how bad it be
S0041	how much cos i mean if we're anything above an eight i'm really quite scar
S0084	yeah it's good to go into these things with your eye open i suppose i don't know whether they the assessment who i love he's just also just join the navy but the year before so his pass out be the christmas before so he's be in the navy for a just over a year but he go to university to train to be a pilot so he's get a pilot's degree
S0041	oh
S0084	yeah that cost sixty grand
S0041	shit
S0084	because he be do that when we work at assessment he have one more year to go and i just think that's a fuck load of money and he's like it's okay because when you graduate that first year out of uh uni you'll be earn a hundred grand and i think okay so what do they like guarantee you work and he be like there's always work yeah there be no there be no job
S0041	yeah when he come out
S0084	none whatsoever so basically his parent have foot the bill sixty grand worth of education and he join the navy anyway but at least he's go in that's it he can fly plan
S0041	hmm
S0084	and sort of get one ahead of everybody else
S0041	yeah a guy that i be he be do his recruiter when i be do mine
S0084	hmm
S0041	umm be say how easy he find the mechanical engineer bite and i be like
S0084	hmm
S0041	and how difficult he find the english bite and i be like no i find that bite the easiest it be the mechanical engineer bite that i find hard
S0084	hmm
S0041	and he be like oh yeah i have get an engineer degree though so i be like uh a bite of a head start there mate
S0084	well that will give you a head up won't it what an idiot
S0041	yeah
S0084	that sort of thing shouldn't be allow really should it
S0041	it's unfair it's an unfair advantage
