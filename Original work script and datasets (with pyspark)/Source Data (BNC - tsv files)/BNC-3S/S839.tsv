S0655	yes
S0653	yeah i'll start with you so mr be very please he say that you've mature a lot in the last four months do you know what that mean
S0655	erm no not really it's hard to explain
S0653	more more grow up really so he say you're very sensible and you can be rely upon to be sensible and make others around you work hard and he be very please with your progress in all subject the only issue we be talk about be handwrite
S0655	yeah
S0653	yeah
S0655	i be leave hand which mean i'm
S0653	i know and he know and i i be also leave hand but that's really good so no issue whatsoever and mrs be also very please with your progress she say your love of language and book and read and everything and stories be fantastic cos you're good at write stories as well as read about them maths you're a little bite worry about
S0654	mm hm
S0653	she say you find it you know you haven't quite decide the best way to work things out so you're always a little bite concern but she say that'll be fine you'll come on no problems at all and that she love how much you like study george stevenson
S0653	whatever his name be so i'm both very i'm very proud of you both absolutely fantastic
S0655	although the only reason i learn how to get quite good at maths
S0653	mm
S0655	be experiment with different ways of how to work things out and then saw which one be the easiest
S0653	mm mm well that be one thing that mr say actually with your big maths on a friday he say sometimes you're like really good like top of the you know near top of the class and then other time you really struggle
S0655	yeah
S0653	be that because it's you're tire sometimes or
S0655	yeah and pressure
S0653	oh the pressure
S0655	cos sometimes erm we do big maths first and other time we do forty four club and a hundred forty four club
S0653	mm hm
S0655	and i'm quite shake up after the stress of a hundred and forty four club
S0653	be that the time table thing
S0655	erm yeah
S0653	mm he do say that you do need to practice your time table more at home
S0655	yeah i find time table and division very difficult
S0653	i know but if you practice them you'll get a bite better
S0655	after all the way home all the way home forty four question in five minutes
S0653	mm and he be also say that you have to do handwrite every day all of you at the moment
S0655	mm hm
S0653	mm which be a lot to ask but he be very impress and mrs be very impress with you so that's great isn't it
S0654	yeah well yeah
S0653	be you please
S0654	the reason why i'm struggle with maths be because well if people like do theirs quickly
S0653	mm
S0654	i'd need to i need to like get a hint on the answer and
S0653	get a what a hint
S0654	on the answer and do you know what i'm really bad at kind of division or something
S0653	mm
S0654	it's like divide
S0653	mm i find that hard too
S0654	and i'm really and i'm really bad erm like at halve odd number
S0653	at fraction yes
S0654	yeah
S0653	me too
S0654	it's like i say eleven can you subtract that measure if something be eleven we need to do the next number down
S0653	mm hm
S0654	so erm
S0653	oh okay
S0654	and basically i basically get one erm eleven
S0653	mm
S0654	and and that be a twelve
S0653	that be a twelve
S0654	yeah i get one eleven and the others be twelve
S0653	okay i'm very bad at maths myself so
S0654	me too
S0655	hey mum shall i tell you what the word of the week be this spell erm
S0653	yeah who choose it first tell me that
S0655	erm i'm not sure but it be mississippi
S0653	that be

S0653	i can't remember now they say it on your hand out
S0655	and i get it right
S0653	oh in the test
S0655	i get
S0653	cos cos you didn't in homework so that's good
S0655	yeah i get twenty out of twenty i think
S0653	yes mr say you're very very good at spell and that you can do them correctly erm when you be write because lot of students sometimes be good at spell but then they can't spell them in the context of a sentence but you can do that
S0655	yeah
S0653	so that's good
S0655	i don't usually spell word wrong in my like in write occasionally i spell erm word wrong that be quite hard
S0653	mm
S0654	like like like like this like geranimo or geronimo like that
S0653	mm hm
S0655	yeah geronimo i would find quite tricky
S0653	and spell be something you're work towards as well
S0655	i probably spell erm g e r
S0653	mm
S0655	o n
S0653	mm hm
S0655	i m o
S0653	mm hm
S0655	be that how you spell it
S0653	mm hm
