S0588	they won't work
S0590	antibiotics will not work
S0588	yes that's what happen isn't it
S0590	mm yeah yeah
S0588	cos he have the urinary infection recurringly
S0590	he do
S0588	doesn't he
S0590	he do actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	and it be avoidable
S0590	well yeah not say it's
S0589	it's a tube
S0588	well
S0590	yeah
S0588	well it's a matter of clean it all the time be it
S0590	it be yeah it's suppose to be clean morning and night
S0588	well that'll be why it's happen
S0590	yeah
S0588	if it's not clean morning and night
S0590	yeah
S0588	but er
S0590	mm
S0589	twenty six from fourteen
S0590	that's quite possible actually
S0589	yeah only
S0590	i mean and er watch this the whole time actually and she's get
S0588	and no wi fi but watch
S0590	well no but watch sport
S0588	but yes
S0590	and particularly cricket and there's usually cricket somewhere in the world
S0588	so presumably
S0590	erm
S0588	they have no computers if they've get no wi fi
S0590	no no
S0588	or mobile phone or
S0590	they have get mobile phone
S0588	oh okay yeah
S0590	they do keep in touch with
S0588	cos that's different yeah
S0590	everybody by mobile phone but that's the only i must go up to the loo erm and er that alright be you quite happy with that it work anyway doesn't it
S0589	uhu
S0590	and can push it
S0589	uhu how be your boob top tube
S0588	it's good it'll very much serve the purpose
S0589	do it
S0588	it keep the boob intact and
S0589	be it the right size
S0588	and stop them move around
S0589	be it the right size
S0588	i think so because any bigger and then the boob would start flop about a bite so i think it have to be really tight it be tight though
S0589	have to be tight
S0588	mm
S0589	have to be tight cos they're design for jog
S0588	it have to be tight
S0589	new balance
S0588	yeah well it would have to be so tight if i be jog my god remember that time we go jog and it just i have to stop because
S0589	yes
S0588	my boob be too booby
S0589	and they have they have lot of different type some with adjustable strap
S0588	yeah you see i i
S0589	but you probably don't want to bother with the
S0588	i don't wanna bother with all that cos it's only for home anyway so i'm not really
S0589	yeah
S0588	and if i go out jog i'd put a t shirt over the top
S0589	and they have some that didn't have the the pad just like a
S0588	yeah
S0589	like a top
S0588	have to be mega tight keep them in control
S0589	and there be bright florescent pink ones
S0588	yes
S0589	and the grey one or i could have get you a sort of orangey white stripy one
S0588	i think you do the right thing by get grey what i like be erm the ones they're wear on my new york city ballet workout but i can't find those anywhere
S0589	yeah i'd like to buy you a pair of
S0588	they seem more balletic somehow

S0590	just off you're sort of
S0588	yeah
S0590	behind the wood
S0588	i know
S0590	not that there's any map
S0588	we have we
S0590	yeah
S0588	we be hopeful that it be an eighteen fifty three map but it's not
S0590	mm
S0588	it's just a print of a map
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's not even victorian it's from
S0590	yes
S0588	nineteen ninety three or something like that
S0590	yeah
S0588	but still you'd pay good money for that
S0590	yes yes
S0588	on ebay
S0590	and it's
S0588	and the frame as well
S0590	it's a pretty map and and it's very very relevant
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	oh it's worth at least fifty pound i mean
S0590	yeah
S0588	if you sell that on ebay
S0590	mm
S0588	but yeah anything that be at that
S0590	and
S0588	on her stall if you'd put that stall somewhere in hoxton or hackney or
S0590	yeah
S0588	or shoreditch it would be just
S0590	mm
S0588	i mean it would be more than triple the price for anything
S0590	yes
S0588	that be on there
S0590	yeah yes yeah
S0588	cos they're all self conscious about what they sell and
S0590	yeah
S0588	they've get the trendy factor and everything
S0590	mm well the the skye map be actually a speed map isn't it
S0588	what's a speed map
S0590	i think i'm right
S0589	what be
S0588	be that who do it
S0590	speed be a cartographer who
S0588	oh yes
S0590	who map it
S0588	i'm not sure if that one be it might be
S0590	yeah i think
S0588	it's funny to think
S0590	i think the skye map be yes
S0588	they actually must have walk around to do it
S0590	yeah i mean the wonderful thing about that skye map be it's so it's so wrong actually
S0588	oh be it
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's not surprise
S0590	but er
S0588	if they didn't have erm
S0590	yeah well yeah you know how they do it
S0588	plan
S0590	yeah but er we've get one out in erm er of the peloponnese which we buy buy years and years and years ago er and that's that's in date it's a it's a genuine original
S0588	mm
S0590	seventeenth century
S0588	mm
S0590	so er and that's actually worth worth a lot but it's definitely in the right place cos it's in the peloponnese and
S0588	well yes absolutely
S0590	yeah yeah so
S0588	so be that an original map then you're say that it's
S0590	the speed be
S0588	by yeah
S0590	by speed
S0588	by the one who
S0590	of what's i think it's
S0588	but what constitute an original map would that be that it's one of the first
S0590	it be it be publish
S0588	print publish
S0590	by him at the time
S0588	so do they do the same thing as book and have editions
S0590	it's like a first edition
S0588	yes exactly
S0590	yeah yes yes it be oh by the way talk of that we buy what be it number eleven
S0588	oh do you
S0590	we buy we buy number eleven yes
S0588	oh

S0590	to anybody who be listen
S0588	yeah
S0590	i mean i be talk to the saleswoman but anybody else around would

S0588	doesn't mean
S0589	big shots
S0588	doesn't mean anything to me
S0589	and a little shoot they'd win
S0588	doesn't mean anything to me no point mean nothing it mean nothing to me
S0588	what's gonna get up to when you're away
S0589	he's well and will be look after him as they usually do actually
S0588	they'll be monitor him
S0590	yeah
S0588	will they
S0590	he's take an aberdeen angus steak out of the freezer
S0588	already
S0590	yeah
S0588	yes
S0590	ah and
S0588	and how's his ears i hear that
S0590	ah well
S0588	he's get some sort of blockage of some
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	nature
S0590	he get a a very detail good letter from the the senior consultant himself
S0588	mm
S0590	erm which say a couple of things actually they they do two years ago he have an mri scan to look at his pituitary
S0588	yes
S0590	and the result of that be the pituitary be fine it hasn't you know it hasn't nothing's grow on the pituitary that's it but it didn't say oh by the way on this mri scan there's a little something that shouldn't be there elsewhere
S0588	oh right it didn't mention that
S0590	no but erm the hear man a few months ago pull up that mri scan and saw this thing which could be impact on his hear so
S0588	mm
S0590	order a ct scan and then so when this letter come just literally about three days ago the consultant be say that both scan show this thing which be identical in both so it hasn't grow
S0588	good
S0590	er and he's he's more or less certain that it be a cyst a benign
S0588	mm
S0590	cyst
S0588	mm
S0590	erm and that there's nothing else untoward up there that shouldn't be there er he er the cyst isn't impact on the hear so he he be of the opinion that it be the hole in the septum that's cause the problem basically
S0588	mm
S0590	it's cause congestion because there's a hole rather than two tunnel
S0588	mm
S0590	all the natural vapours and whatever
S0588	mm
S0590	don't move because they don't know where to go
S0588	yes
S0590	erm and and this
S0588	block
S0590	be cause a backlog of blockage
S0588	mm yeah
S0590	into the hear tube as it be
S0588	be he go to
S0590	so
S0588	get the septum do
S0590	well i don't think they can repair the septum
S0588	oh dear
S0590	yeah but er he's he's hopeful that they will be able to find something to alleviate the problem so that's
S0588	mm
S0590	that's really good news actually
S0588	to know yes
S0590	at the minute his hear be very good except he won't
S0588	i think it be really

S0590	yeah
S0588	cos it's just enough abrasiveness without scratch it

S0588	you know yeah it do really well
S0590	like that you you don't have to to rub it
S0588	yeah

S0588	just really lightly you can do it and it
S0590	yeah
S0588	it lift it off
S0590	be that your co monitor up there carbon monoxide
S0588	mm yes
S0590	mm

S0590	oh
S0588	have you get a co monitor
S0590	no we don't actually
S0588	mm
S0590	no
S0588	cos they come it come with it
S0590	yeah i think
S0588	they bring it
S0590	i think it's a requirement now actually
S0588	i think it's a requirement yeah
S0590	yeah yeah you see i mean we ours be put in
S0588	before that
S0590	eight years ago
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah i mean er ours be a five kilowatt one but even then if we'd buy a bigger one you wouldn't have have to have a
S0588	mm
S0590	an air vent in those days
S0588	yeah
S0590	certainly not when we have our first log burner way back in eighty four or something mm even earlier than that no eighty oh no before eighty four good grief more like seventy eight mm
S0588	yeah i often wonder what would have happen if you just light a fire
S0590	well
S0588	in the hole
S0590	yeah
S0588	and
S0590	it would have
S0588	i mean it would have go somewhere
S0590	it would have
S0588	the smoke
S0590	go straight up the chimney because
S0588	well i would have think so
S0590	yeah i if you think of
S0590	i mean
S0588	yes
S0590	i dunno if they use the fire there
S0588	no they don't
S0590	but i mean
S0588	no
S0590	there be fireplaces there
S0588	yeah exactly
S0590	if you if you live there if i'd live there i would have just
S0588	mm
S0590	light the fire and off it would have
S0588	i know
S0590	yeah cos this be what be do at number seventeen
S0588	oh yes that's right that's i
S0590	we just light the fire saw that the smoke go up the chimney and that be it
S0588	i know i remember
S0590	yeah
S0588	do that way back in
S0590	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	in
S0590	yeah
S0588	open up a fireplace and light it
S0590	yeah
S0588	and none of this erm on no it's get to be line
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	you've get to comply with these regulations
S0590	yes i mean they're just
S0588	and and those rule and
S0590	yeah yeah
S0590	i get i mean with a log burner of course
S0588	it be before the days of all the regulations and
S0590	you have to have a tube go all the way up
S0588	yeah
S0590	but that's because it's a log burner but as you say
S0588	but if if you can get
S0590	if the chimney be there
S0588	if someone a chimney sweep stick a great big pole up and it stick out the top
S0590	yeah the yeah
S0588	then that mean that you've get a hole
S0590	yeah exactly
S0588	and
S0590	and that
S0588	so it's gonna go up the hole
S0590	the smoke will go up it
S0588	i would have think so
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	and maybe i mean you just wonder whether it's like oh no you're gonna need
S0590	yeah
S0588	this as well you know and
S0590	well i think it
S0588	a little bite maybe
S0590	health and safety er you know
S0588	people milk it
S0590	at its ridiculous level because you know the rail round our house be eighty centimetres not round the house on the terrace be eighty centimetres tall and the gap be about i think twelve centimetres
S0588	sorry what's what be eighty centimetres tall
S0590	er it's eighty the rail
S0588	oh the rail
S0590	you know on on the terrace we have you know
S0588	yeah
S0590	we have this stone terrace build
S0588	mm
S0590	and i ask for the rail to be eighty centimetres and the gap to be that because i i didn't want the top of the rail to be you know cut off
S0590	the view sort of thing you see
S0588	impinge on the view yeah
S0590	so that's actually what we do have
S0588	yes
S0590	but as the guy who instal it say you know this would not pass
S0588	really
S0590	health and safety
S0588	mm
S0590	health as he say it have to be one metre
S0588	but
S0590	and it the gap have to be this i say why and he say
S0588	yeah
S0590	it's because baby can put their head through and
S0588	but you don't have a baby
S0590	children yeah exactly and and if somebody bring a baby they can bloody well look
S0590	look after it
S0588	yeah
S0590	you know er it and if a toddlers go to throw themselves over the top of it
S0590	then it's because somebody's not look after it
S0588	yeah
S0590	who should be and not me but whoever own it should be look after it
S0588	nanny state isn't it
S0590	and you see out in er you know our wall be this high
S0588	yeah
S0590	erm the drop er down there be a hell of a lot bigger than
S0588	well
S0590	the drop over our terrace here
S0588	i be gonna say your terrace
S0590	so nobody bother out there about things
S0588	how high be your terrace then
S0590	well erm
S0588	it's not high be it
S0590	well to in
S0588	but i mean yeah exactly
S0590	er no er if you're stand the the bottom of the terrace be here
S0588	yeah
S0590	you know to eye level
S0588	that's what i recall
S0590	yeah whereas in the bottom of the terrace
S0588	yeah
S0590	be way above my head and you know
S0588	mm
S0590	we've just get this little wall
S0588	so the baby would survive anyway
S0590	that we can sit on
S0590	yes
S0590	and anyway it shouldn't be out there unescorted so
S0588	absolutely
S0590	so er you know he be of that same opinion but he say you know you i just want you
S0588	yeah
S0590	to know that er
S0588	mm
S0590	it doesn't fall within
S0588	so what do you do
S0590	oh er eighty centimetres tall and
S0588	yeah
S0590	exactly what i want and to hell with little baby
S0588	so you think well sod that
S0590	fall put their head through it
S0588	yeah exactly
S0590	yeah yes yeah because i mean you read of that oh god that appal tragedy where those two year old twin
S0588	oh something about it
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	but you know
S0588	well
S0590	it be possible that the landlord will be er hold responsible legally for rent out a property
S0588	mm
S0590	with something insecure in it
S0588	what happen to them exactly
S0590	have well
S0588	just run me through it
S0590	er at eight o'clock in the morning
S0588	mm
S0590	two two year olds wander out of the house and
S0588	into the
S0590	go through a a gateway and somehow or other fell into this big tank which have be use by the the owner of the place who be now rent it out he have keep carp in it so it be a big tank
S0588	oh be it be it the garden
S0590	it the yeah it be out out of doors yes yeah
S0588	so they go into the garden and fell into this
S0590	they go out and then go you know out through and it's only eight o'clock in the morning so you know what be their do at eight o'clock in the morning two year olds
S0588	well that's the classic health and safety
S0590	yeah
S0588	rule isn't it
S0590	yeah
S0588	that you need to keep an eye on children where there's water concern
S0590	yeah and actually you know as i say the owner may well be hold responsible for rent out somewhere with a you know a
S0588	that's ridiculous
S0590	but i think that's ridiculous because you know if parent with two not just one but two two year olds might have think well hang on a minute
S0588	yeah
S0590	we'd better not rent somewhere
S0588	completely
S0590	that have something as lethal as that in the garden
S0588	that's just bizarre
S0590	not that it be it it could you know it be behind lock doors but somehow or other the door or something or other well it couldn't have be lock
S0588	well oh
S0590	but you know the parent should have
S0588	but then
S0590	if if they insist on rent it they should have insist on the thing be drain cos it
S0588	yeah
S0590	it wasn't be use
S0588	yeah
S0590	er but they should have rent something else
S0588	but if you take that attitude then before you know it every accident
S0590	yeah
S0588	that happen be gonna be the landlord's fault
S0590	yes
S0588	that's ridiculous
S0590	yeah yeah but you know that's that's very much the present day attitude
S0588	it's like you might as well
S0590	it's like people slip and fall
S0588	if you bump into a piece of furniture
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it's the fault of the landlord who's
S0590	yeah
S0588	furnish the house
S0590	yeah well
S0590	if you read case of people who sue
S0588	mcdonald's for scald themselves
S0590	or or or for slip
S0588	on a hot cup of tea
S0590	yeah which they've just buy
S0588	yeah
S0590	or slip on a floor where you know
S0588	yeah
S0590	there's a sign well you know where's personal
S0588	well
S0590	responsibility
S0588	exactly i'm sort of with the personal responsibility
S0590	yes exactly
S0588	thing really and i
S0590	yeah
S0588	i wouldn't
S0590	i wouldn't pursue that no quite
S0588	i wouldn't do it i wouldn't pursue something like that
S0590	because and if you trip in a pothole
S0590	you should damn well have see it
S0588	yeah i mean within there be some i suppose there's a fine line i suppose if the council have not keep the path or something and
S0590	yeah
S0588	there be sticky out bits and you go fly
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's a bite annoy
S0590	yeah
S0588	you know cos
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	that could have be avoid
S0590	yeah
S0588	but erm i'd maybe write a letter to them
S0590	yeah
S0588	and tell them what happen
S0590	well what yes
S0588	but i wouldn't
S0590	but i mean just to beware of this
S0588	try to milk them for
S0590	yeah no
S0588	for stuff yeah
S0590	exactly no no
S0588	no you wouldn't feel good about it
S0590	i mean and also no
S0588	i wouldn't feel good about it
S0590	no
S0588	i wouldn't feel good about do that anyway but yeah
S0590	i remember
S0588	i mean the whole anywhere you work now be like
S0590	it it
S0588	health and safety
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	course and really bizarre things i once do this course erm it be online i think it be at and part of the induction you have to do this online sort of course thing erm and one of them be health and safety and it be really kind of like doh question
S0588	like what be wrong with this scene you know and there's like kind of wire all over the floor and
S0590	yeah yeah yeah
S0588	someone on a ladder and
S0590	yeah
S0588	you know it's like really kind of
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	er
S0590	everything
S0588	you know everything be like
S0590	yeah mm
S0588	oh
S0590	mm
S0588	it be really funny erm
S0590	yeah
S0588	but er yeah it's
S0590	well i remember years ago when we be and i be down i think in where there's a huge absolutely vast gorgeous big park
S0588	mm
S0590	er on a on a slope it's come down a hill sort of thing but it it's very very large beautifully keep and i actually twist my ankle because i happen to walk into a an you know a not a pothole
S0588	something
S0590	but just a little indentation
S0588	okay
S0590	it wasn't as level as it look
S0588	no
S0590	just because it be you know well that's the sort of situation other people would go off to the council and
S0588	yeah
S0590	well it's ridiculous
S0588	well it's it
S0590	it's just one's bad luck
S0588	yeah yeah
S0590	you know that i'd choose that little bite of the whole park
S0588	but then you have these company that say have you have an accident
S0590	yes yes
S0588	and that's change the attitude of people
S0590	yeah it have yeah
S0588	it's atrocious really
S0590	yeah yeah yeah er once i be watch a programme on the telly of police in action and erm
S0590	erm road patrol that sort of thing
S0588	mm
S0590	and er in this particular case er on a motorway there be the most minor of shunt erm
S0588	yeah
S0590	so minor that in the second car there be hardly any damage do
S0588	mm
S0590	whatsoever
S0588	yeah
S0590	er and none of the traffic have apparently be move very rapidly er the and then the police be say to the camera you know because all the people in the in the car the the back car be complain of neck ache
S0590	and as er this policeman sort of grit his teeth say
S0588	mm
S0590	you know clearly
S0588	mm
S0590	they're go to try and sue claim
S0588	yeah
S0590	damage and he say because they're complain of neck ache we have to take it seriously
S0588	yeah
S0590	so they have to be put into ambulances and take off
S0588	oh how appal
S0590	and he say it be this policeman be quite blatantly say it be so infuriate
S0588	yeah
S0590	cos he say there's actually
S0588	there's other people who need it
S0590	nothing wrong with any of them
S0588	yeah that's atrocious isn't it
S0590	yeah
S0588	mm something for nothing

S0588	include in medical matter and everything really
S0590	yeah

S0590	perfectly well actually and if he's
S0588	yeah

S0588	perfectly well he do as well
S0590	yeah

S0588	no i just
S0590	that we don't use

S0590	i i mean that za
S0588	they whoever it be

S0590	yeah mm fen would be less damage for the point of view of his lordship erm e isn't there a word v e n
S0588	well i that's what i think but i don't think there be
S0590	i think there be you know
S0588	ven what would that mean though
S0590	well i'm not certain but
S0588	it's possible
S0590	yeah er fen
S0588	if there be a a word
S0590	be be a word
S0588	that's four it's it's still not very good score anyway
S0590	four five it's it's eight it's a bite more
S0588	triple letter
S0590	fen i'd be fen a single the a singular word
S0588	four five six seven oh yeah eight
S0590	or be it just fens yeah
S0588	two more
S0590	yeah
S0588	the then
S0590	yeah you need two vowels don't you yeah
S0588	yeah i need a a rive
S0590	yeah it you know i think

S0588	yeah
S0590	whole thing in actually miss a go
S0588	right
S0590	if you hand them any number in
S0588	yeah
S0590	from one to all of them you do miss a go but sometimes it pay to do that because you you get rid of
S0588	yeah
S0590	a letter combination that you can't use and dump that letter combination on other people who be gonna pick it up at some stage or other really er you really do need a balance of
S0588	mm
S0590	of the two erm
S0588	yeah if i put rider then there's a triple word score there
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	but if i put fen it's only triple letter score
S0590	yeah
S0588	he could do but he's get triple score up there but at least it's not triple word score

S0588	well it skew the whole thing for ever more as soon he do that
S0590	cos none of the rest of us know these
S0588	well
S0590	two letter word
S0588	yeah it's not fair be it really
S0590	i mean i suppose in a sense we we should use them but
S0588	well we could use them
S0590	we but you know we
S0588	we have the right to
S0590	the rest of the family would like to say well hang on a minute we'll have only the
S0588	yeah
S0590	common two letter word
S0588	need to be one or the other
S0590	in at on up
S0588	doesn't it yeah

S0588	and i don't i don't want to learn those word
S0590	be no quite za be
S0588	i mean i'm
S0590	unacceptable
S0588	i'd prefer to learn a word that you're actually go to use not
S0590	yeah
S0588	one that's
S0590	yeah
S0588	you're not never gonna use
S0590	i think my rule would be it it can only be a two letter word if it's a preposition
S0588	uhu
S0590	er you know which be in in at or up
S0588	yeah
S0590	erm if not a preposition but that'll do but you know the word that we actually use
S0588	well exactly and it's more useful
S0590	i mean even the word er pi
S0588	if it's word you actually use
S0590	p i be an okay word actually cos we we do actually use the word
S0588	you could learn something from a word
S0590	yeah
S0588	even if you don't know what it mean if it's something that you're likely to use then you're gonna learn something whose go be it do i just go
