S0230	sixteen fifty
S0198	exactly the same
S0229	sixteen fifty
S0198	so what do you do you get any discount er when you book online oh be that because dad's be older so what be yours dad fifteen pound cos you're an old age pensioner yeah oap oh wow they knock off a
S0230	no it's actually cost me more look the ticket be sixteen fifty dad's be fifteen and i pay two pound book fee so mine come to thirty three fifty
S0198	oh crikey and er
S0230	because i say it be nineteen something perhaps it be if you pay on the day
S0229	yeah
S0198	oh what rather than buy an advance ticket
S0230	yeah
S0198	shall i look it up and see what it say great steam fair
S0230	so i've actually pay two pound more
S0198	than i do
S0230	we could've just get them down here in the
S0198	well i guess you've gotta pay for the postage haven't you so
S0230	the book fee yeah
S0198	to post them out to you but maybe yeah it's if you erm buy them on the day or not it might be different at the entrance mightn't it
S0230	might be yeah
S0229	no i think it's dearer
S0230	well it say it be nineteen
S0229	mm
S0230	i think nineteen pound i think
S0229	well have a look on the laptop
S0230	for an adult ticket on the day
S0198	do you remember what you er oh it's a muddy start it's on bbc news one day ago erm do you remember what you pay last time you come down
S0230	no
S0229	no that be seven years ago
S0198	yeah
S0230	be longer ago than that
S0230	eight years
S0229	mm
S0198	come under do it
S0230	pardon me
S0198	pardon you
S0230	i'm ever so burpy
S0198	it's all that erm don't know it's all the tea you drink or something isn't it mum
S0230	probably
S0198	see what the price be now oh yeah on the day it's twenty pound
S0229	yeah
S0198	but prepay be sixteen pound fifty
S0230	oh
S0198	but underneath it say in bracket on book before the thirteenth of august but i guess what they've do be issue prepay ticket to the to all the and they've just still get them
S0230	yeah
S0198	i guess oh on book before thirteenth of august
S0230	yeah so i think you know we have to book it before then to get the but then they i get two pound add on to mine anyway so
S0198	you have to do it yeah so it would've be cheaper to well
S0230	so you could say mine be eighteen fifty
S0198	still not twenty pound and dad's would've be seventeen pound so you still save money than buy it on the day
S0230	yeah
S0198	which be the whole idea but not as cheap as walk in today and just get one over the counter
S0229	disable park
S0198	disable park probably
S0230	shall i keep it with mine now
S0198	yeah you may as well sure you'll have to you'll have to use yours for erm entrance anyway hopefully it mean we'll get in a bite quicker tomorrow

S0198	couldn't do without it could you
S0230	no not not when you've have one you know when you've have it
S0198	mm
S0230	from the begin
S0229	wonder what the house be worth now must've up
S0230	yeah probably i dunno i'm not really that worry to be honest
S0229	yeah nor be i or do that go down again
S0230	well if it go down everything else go down with it
S0229	yeah
S0198	how much do you pay for your house again
S0230	one nine two
S0229	mm
S0198	one nine two
S0230	i think it be one nine two
S0198	wow one hundred and ninety two thousand pound
S0229	might've be a little bite more
S0230	one nine four
S0229	yeah
S0230	something like that
S0229	a hundred and ninety four
S0198	so i mean do the property price drop in the recession and then come back up
S0229	yeah yeah
S0230	yeah they they do drop a bite when we first move in
S0229	yeah we be down about twenty thousand
S0198	cor bad time to have to sell isn't it
S0229	i think it might've be even more yeah
S0198	but if you
S0229	that be the time to buy
S0230	the time to buy yeah
S0198	but then er er but then also it depend you know swing and roundabouts if you be look to buy a property then you would've get it for cheaper even though you be sell yours for cheaper so it doesn't really matter do it
S0230	mm
S0229	yeah yeah
S0230	no but but we we wouldn't've have to've spend so much on buy it cos we'd already sell ours hadn't we yeah
S0198	you've oh in term yeah if you be buy it out of save yeah then it would've be just cheaper for you
S0230	mm
S0198	and then eventually when it crawl back up you could've make a profit
S0230	mm
S0198	instead of lose twenty yeah you that would've give you an extra twenty thousand pound to play with
S0230	mm i don't think it drop that much though they didn't
S0198	it's a shame isn't it
S0229	it do
S0230	well i don't think they do
S0230	they never really drop too much in our area they they might've drop it it didn't drop twenty thousand there's no way it would drop twenty thousand
S0198	i can't imagine they drop too dramatically
S0230	it might've drop about ten at the most
S0229	it do
S0230	oh shut up you
S0229	it do
S0230	you don't know
S0230	in fact
S0198	keep make itself jump in the lampshade bag
S0230	in fact i'm not even sure if it drop at all
S0230	because we you know we put the garage and that on when we move in didn't we
S0229	yeah
S0198	why be it worth so much without the garage
S0230	well it's it's because it's yeah

S0198	yeah
S0230	that make a difference
S0198	yeah i imagine it do
S0198	i imagine it do although there's no reason really for it to make a difference be there depend on it's depend on the
S0229	i mean a garage now should quite a bite on the house
S0198	why do they like these lampshades so much
S0230	be they your lampshades they're play with
