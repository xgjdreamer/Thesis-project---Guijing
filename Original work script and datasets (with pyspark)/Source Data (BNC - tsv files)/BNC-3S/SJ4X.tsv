S0018	be that the right be that the right way up be that the way that you've be look at it
S0006	let's have a look hold that that's it hang on no that way up
S0018	be i look at it the wrong way up
S0006	yeah
S0018	upside down
S0006	you see it's be it's not very very clear but it be eighteen carat
S0018	uh huh
S0006	i can assure you
S0018	okay and what's the other
S0006	in the little square block
S0018	ah
S0006	oblong block
S0018	yeah
S0006	one eight c t
S0018	so what's the what be the it's emboss with four figure next to the little box what's the four figure next to the little box
S0006	that's get nineteen seventeen
S0018	yeah so that's what i be that's what i could see with my naked eye
S0006	yes
S0018	and i be think
S0006	that's nineteen seventeen
S0018	so it doesn't that mean
S0006	that's it could possibly be the the year that it be make
S0018	really so it's that old blimey that be yes i can see the the eighteen carat in the box
S0006	yes
S0018	but i be look at the date
S0006	but in the trade um the trade description of that hallmark would be a foreigner what they call a foreigner
S0018	mm hm
S0006	because it be not the full hallmark that you could get
S0018	what would a full hallmark be
S0006	a a full hallmark would be invariably a date mark a hallmark date
S0018	mm hm
S0006	then they'd be seven five o
S0018	mm hm
S0006	seven fifty pure gold be twenty four carats so twenty four carat be pure gold so you would have nine carat gold nine over twenty four
S0018	mm hm
S0006	be three eighths so you would have four that's nine carats point three seven five
S0018	mm hm
S0006	the point three seven five in decimals be three eighths if it be eighteen it would be point seven five o
S0018	mm hm
S0006	which be three quarter
S0018	mm hm
S0006	of full pure gold
S0018	ah okay so what be it what be it mix with if it's not make of pure gold
S0006	it's mix with any other metal that might be available usually copper
S0018	uh huh
S0006	if it's red gold it's copper if it's yellow gold it's brass
S0018	hmm do you think that would be brass then
S0006	that would be with brass then yes
S0018	okay
S0006	a mixture
S0018	how interest
S0006	cos pure gold be so soft
S0018	uh huh
S0006	twenty four carat gold be too soft
S0018	right well in five years' time i'm go to have to celebrate the centenary of this ring aren't i
S0006	yes
S0005	party
S0006	yes yes
S0018	how interest

S0006	yup
S0018	by her daughter in the nineteen forties
S0006	yeah
S0018	so i guess that stand to reason doesn't it
S0006	what happen when they term as a foreigner a foreigner be make by the people who work in the company
S0018	mm hm
S0006	but didn't want to send it to be fully hallmarked
S0018	oh okay
S0006	so because of the cost so they didn't want to get it fully hallmarked
S0018	oh cos it cost more money to get it hallmarked
S0006	of course and you'll get the difference if you get platinum
S0018	uh huh
S0006	p l a t
S0018	uh huh
S0006	which be a pure metal
S0018	okay that's very interest hmm well talk about practical husband and stuff my best friend pardon me her husband's father be a goldsmith um but indian jewellery

S0018	uh huh
S0006	oh yes
S0018	that must cost a bomb
S0005	yes but it's not very heavy
S0005	not great slice of it
S0018	the price of gold have go up hasn't it
S0006	oh tremendously
S0018	yes
S0006	well it's fluctuate now in between it's it's um over the past three years the price of gold have nearly triple
S0018	alright
S0006	it's nearly seventeen at the this morning i think in the time seventeen hundred dollars
S0018	mm hm
S0006	and three or four years ago it be four hundred five hundred dollars
S0018	so why have it shoot up be it
S0006	demand
S0005	because of the financial situation it's it's um when the stock market be a bite rocky they put their money in gold
S0018	really
S0005	yup doesn't earn much but
S0018	mm hm
S0005	it's still there
S0018	that's interest
S0006	when i first come into the antique business
S0018	mm hm
S0006	and buy my shop in nineteen seventy one a deal et cetera i be able to buy sovereigns a whole sovereign in my shop for the equivalent of eighteen pound in those days
S0018	mm hm
S0006	how much do you think a sovereign be now today
S0018	oh i don't know
S0006	just under four hundred pound
S0018	oh really gosh
S0006	i be able to buy kruger rands kruger rands which be an ounce it's kruger rands be the south south african
S0018	mm yeah
S0006	so t's the same well it's the south african gold call call a kruger rand which be one ounce of twenty two carat gold
S0018	mm hm
S0006	very nearly pure gold and you could buy a kruger rand in those days for forty pound or thereabouts
S0018	hmm
S0006	now they're nearly a thousand pound or a little bite over a thousand pound
S0018	it have shoot up hasn't it i think one of the one of the consequences of the price of gold shoot up be that there be a lot of um burglaries target to indian families in the area
S0005	that's right because they know that the all these women have would have have all this jewellery
S0018	yeah
S0005	um they hang it on them when they get marry you know this this gold jewellery
S0006	yes
S0018	mm hm

S0018	it's part of the dowry isn't it
S0005	yes it be
S0006	oh yes oh yes
S0018	and it's all get different uh tradition and significance but i think er the lady over the road be it seema

S0018	the lady over the road they be rob
S0005	oh they have problems yes
S0018	last year

S0005	and um not practise or anything and at the wed she wear a sari and what have you and the guests hang jewellery on her that be the present they hang jewellery
S0018	oh right
S0005	on her so they do have a lot they do have a lot of em and of course a lot of it be not insure
S0018	hmm
S0005	that's another thing you see they have it and don't insure it they be a they're target there's no doubt about it
S0018	oh well i think i remember that they say that the sixteen year old he be there
S0005	he be there do his homework yeah
S0018	oh poor thing
S0005	yeah
S0018	awful
S0005	that's why the burglar i think they get a burglar alarm but that why why the burglar alarm wasn't on he be there
S0018	mm hm yeah it's a shame this area be quite safe though isn't it there's not be many problems
S0005	it's not bad
S0006	consider yes
S0018	hmm
S0006	it's it it it what it would be term as not a high risk
S0018	mm hm
S0006	area not a high risk area
S0018	i be surprise i've i've always hear there have be robberies in for examples on or down but this
S0006	i think what people
S0018	particular area
S0006	because it's
S0005	it's near the shop so you've get a lot of traffic
S0006	traffic
S0018	ah
S0005	go past people go past and the garden um in when we move here we have this you know the police advise about things and oh and we have the the insurance company
S0006	yes the assessors
S0005	and they if you've get a garden that's enclose
S0018	mm hm
S0005	as this be you see
S0018	uh huh
S0005	that's what they like
S0018	okay
S0006	high fence
S0018	right
S0005	and and they would have to come over other people's garden you see
S0018	yeah yeah
S0005	so they do like that and they do like uh things you know where people be constantly pass
S0018	yeah i'm surprise that no one's try to jump over our gate our side wall
S0005	well they may have do i don't know
S0018	from the alley way yeah don't say that they may have do
S0005	well i don't know but they do get in didn't they but couldn't get into the house
S0018	oh yeah that's right
S0005	yeah they do get
S0018	that's right
S0005	they do get over but couldn't couldn't couldn't get into the house
S0018	hmm and dad be say that they try to steal all the the lead off the the insulation on the top of the the passageway but yeah
S0005	yeah
S0018	maybe they just couldn't get into the house
S0005	no they couldn't and i mean if it's they bring they bring they've get to be able to get away you see
S0018	mm hm
S0005	this be the thing this be what they look to see that
S0006	one of the first things didn't this police the policeman that come to see us and they say the first thing that a professional burglar look for be his escape route
S0018	yeah
S0006	if he can get away quickly it's not a matter of break in
S0018	mm hm
S0006	it's get out and if they can get out quickly this be what they look for
S0018	yeah
S0006	and get away so it's not so much break in it's get out
S0018	huh that's good to know well maybe that's why maybe that will explain why this area's
S0006	we'll we've i think we've have it we've be here now how many years thirty
S0005	we come here in seventy six but the barrington's have a burglary haven't they
S0006	they have a burglary yes
S0005	they have they get in through the kitchen window
S0006	they be because that be
S0005	but i don't think they get window lock
S0006	no no
S0005	i mean that be in
S0006	but when we move in we be very very conscious of this
S0018	mm hm
S0006	that's cos we'd have a burglary in the flat
S0006	and we put in lock
S0018	hmm
S0006	all the way round and things like that and lock on the windows and things like that
S0018	mm hm
S0006	so we be very very conscious because where we live in edgbaston we be burgle
S0018	really
S0006	we have a flat and we be burgle weren't we
S0005	hmm
S0006	and we be on the second floor third floor
S0005	second
S0006	second floor
S0018	mm hm
S0006	so we be conscious of this and do something about it
S0018	hmm yeah it be weird for me move from live in a flat on like the sixth or seventh floor to move into a house on the grind floor i just felt really vulnerable
S0006	sure
S0018	cos
S0006	sure
S0018	when you're on the sixth or seventh floor there's only one access
S0005	that's right
S0018	and that's the stairs and
S0005	that's right
S0018	you feel a bite safer because there's only one point of entry as well the front door
S0006	hmm
S0005	mm hm
S0018	and all of a sudden there's like
S0006	you
S0018	front door back door side door
S0005	windows
S0006	we're very very conscious of insurance as well of property and insurance of content
S0018	mm hm
S0006	be one of the things the assessor come and ask us about be a burglar alarm
S0018	mm hm
S0006	and we'd tell him we'd have the uh crime prevention policeman
S0018	mm hm
S0006	officer come and see it and he look around and he ask us about it and say one of the reason that people have a burglar alarm be invariably they've get something worth steal if you don't have a burglar alarm
S0018	ah
S0006	hang outside of the house
S0018	okay
S0005	and
S0006	the burglar will go past
S0005	and also when we move in of course nobody have a burglar alarm
S0018	uh huh
S0005	in this road um and they say don't put a
S0006	oh yeah
S0005	this be the police don't put a burglar alarm because this be true you see they see a burglar alarm and think ah that's worth it
S0018	hmm
S0005	but now of course that we're probably the only people on the road who haven't get one
S0018	well if you think about all the things that be in a house nowadays everyone's get well flat screen tvs ipods ipads ipiddles ipoodles
S0006	hmm
S0018	all these expensive gadgets
S0006	some things that be easily disposable of down the
S0018	yeah and easy to grab as well
S0006	yup
S0005	yeah oh yes yes
S0006	yup yup
S0018	mm hm
S0006	yup the um incident that i be involve in many many years ago when i have my shop
S0018	where be your shop
S0006	in um
S0018	oh yeah
S0006	um do you know the college arm
S0018	nope
S0006	when you go along to go into town
S0018	mm hm
S0006	at the bottom of um it be be it go down i have a shop on the corner of and but one of the first uh occasion of people get in touch with me because i be a member of a trade association
S0018	mm hm
S0006	to assess um uh uh follow the robbery and the this couple who i know and they ring me and i go over cos i live in over and they have quite a lot of nice things
S0018	mm hm
S0006	in their house and they go away for a for a weekend and when they come back the house be empty and what the burglars have do
S0018	oh no
S0006	be they'd come in over the back and take out the patio doors
S0018	oh gosh
S0006	and they'd actually take the patio doors out and leave them on the lawn and take everything out
S0005	and and have when they be um they be away and they get in and put a van in the garage and have the whole weekend
S0006	yup
S0005	to just load this van up
S0018	cheeky things
S0005	so you i mean most burglars i suppose be sort of opportunist ones
S0018	hmm
S0005	the window open and whatever
S0018	hmm
S0005	but of course it's the serious stuff that they have a look and see
S0018	mm hm
S0005	what's around so
S0018	case the joint before they
S0005	yeah absolutely
S0018	plan it
S0005	there's no such thing as a hundred percent protection
S0018	no there isn't
S0006	what do that policeman say the other that come to see us about some they're what do they call opportunists
S0018	mm hm
S0005	yeah that's what i say they're opportunists
S0006	yeah
S0005	they see a window open
S0018	mm hm
S0005	or or whatever and um in they go in and out quickly though
S0018	there be a spate of uh burglaries in spain in big villas you know most people live in apartment build but people who do live in house be usually the tourists who've get enough money to buy a house or very rich families and so what um they find that after be it it be a couple of years ago about five years ago when um other countries be let into the eec like romania and
S0006	when the eastern european countries come
S0018	yeah that's right
S0006	yeah
S0018	and all of a sudden there be an influx of
S0006	albanians
S0018	yeah for example
S0018	well apparently it be all the um the police the police from countries like that that be form organise crime group
S0006	yes
S0018	obviously they have all the expertise
S0006	crime group yes yes
S0018	and it be uh be do these burglaries whereby they get they open the letter box and gas the the house so that if you be in the house you'd get knock out and they'd come in break force entry steal everything know that you couldn't do anything about it because you wouldn't even be aware of it because you'd be um
S0006	knock out
S0018	yeah
S0006	good heavens
S0018	and well at least there be no violence involve violent crime be obviously a lot worse but it's just awful no to think that one morning you might wake up and you've be you've be put to sleep and
S0005	oh no
S0018	everything's go and people have be in your house and
S0006	of course one of the things of course be have a a a table or something or rather in your entrance and that people can look through the letter box and hook the key out
S0018	ah
S0005	oh yes that's why you never leave handbags or car key or anything in
S0006	if anything in a it should be in a drawer
S0018	yup
S0006	in a drawer which be shut
S0018	or they get
S0006	which be usually lock

S0006	like i say i want those
S0018	well what we can do be that we can scan those into the computer so it doesn't really matter what size they be
S0006	yeah yeah yeah
S0018	and then turn them into a digital document that we can then
S0006	sure sure
S0018	i think what you could be get you could be have a think about um be which of the photos or which of the cos you say you want to put some of the card that you receive
S0006	yes there be there be also some card
S0018	uh huh
S0006	that i've receive
S0018	so because for example say that's a a double page
S0006	yeah
S0018	for example that's an a4 page and that's an a4 page
S0006	yeah yeah
S0018	you could you could fit like for example two photos on one a4 page
S0006	yes
S0018	or have one
S0006	yeah
S0018	in portrait on a whole a4 page
S0006	yeah
S0018	so if they're any particularly special ones
S0006	yup
S0018	you could either or even have like double page
S0006	sure sure
S0018	spread of it if it's in landscape
S0006	this be something that i really enjoy because of your knowledge and expertise particularly the one that you do i think that be absolutely super
S0018	aw
S0006	so in that respect you know
S0018	mm hm
S0006	how be we gonna compile this
S0018	but if you choose the the photos that be really special to you
S0006	sure
S0018	and that you like bigger
S0006	sure
S0018	as a double page spread or as a
S0006	yeah yeah that's
S0005	there quite the right size i mean a lot of them obviously the american they they wouldn't know the people anyway so it's only the people they the family people that they know
S0018	yeah
S0005	that would have to be include in this
S0018	yeah
S0005	because there's a lot of the others they don't know
S0018	but if you want if there's a particularly favourite photo of or something
S0006	there be two
S0018	oh of course yeah because be that the ones that you have on
S0006	yeah
S0018	at the front and
S0006	there's one there's one that we have at the front of the order of service
S0018	mm hm
S0006	which you've see
S0018	mm hm
S0006	because have you see the one
S0018	yeah yes you give it to me
S0006	on the order of service that's one
S0018	uh huh
S0006	which be her look sideways
S0018	mm hm
S0006	but it's a very good photo of her take quite recently this be
S0018	uh huh
S0006	i think it be last year with
S0005	hmm
S0006	uh so we cut that in half and that's go on in the order of service but there's two other photograph one when she be involve with a um a
S0005	with open christmas
S0006	an open christmas which be for the down and out and destitutes
S0018	mm hm
S0006	in the seventies and she be one of the first people who form this group

S0005	they still do you know saint martin in the field this christmas thing
S0018	mm hm
S0005	it's still open christmas

S0018	mm hm
S0005	and they they turn up you know and stay over christmas in saint basil's or something wasn't it anyway so and she be involve with that right from the start and then there's a photograph of her in the newspaper cos it she have a write up in the newspaper
S0018	mm hm
S0005	so um
S0006	which i keep
S0018	hmm
S0005	of course you don't throw anything away
S0005	we should we could be find dead under pile of paper
S0018	well if you want to put the newspaper thing in as well we can scan that in
S0006	yes
S0018	into the computer
S0006	yes yes yes
S0018	that could be a good idea
S0006	yeah i'm i'm sure that because um her reaction when i tell her that have die because when she be young she be four years older than me
S0018	mm hm
S0006	so in age she be closer to
S0018	mm hm
S0006	because i'll show you what i mean

S0006	and sleep in the same bedroom
S0018	mm hm
S0006	they share a bed that's when all the family be at home
S0018	mm hm so how many how many page do you think you might be
S0006	i would
S0005	he have to go through them actually i mean he hasn't
S0018	yeah
S0005	there's still all together i mean i've
S0006	but
S0005	sort i've sort a few i've go through them a bite and put some that i think you'd probably want to put in this book cos i say there's no point in send photograph of friends or any of those that they don't know
S0018	yeah
S0006	no
S0005	no friends she doesn't know
S0006	wouldn't be interest in those anyhow
S0005	that's right
S0018	be you and be you think of an a4 size book like the one in my parents' house
S0006	yes like the one like yours and i should judge um
S0018	because i find i think the a4 ones you have to have a certain number of page and i actually find that it be difficult to fill that amount of page with all the photos
S0006	well we this be something that we can sort out
S0018	yeah
S0006	we we well you know we'll be quite flexible be how
S0018	mm hm
S0006	how we're go to go about this
S0018	how be her eyesight 's
S0006	
S0018	yeah
S0006	reasonable
S0018	okay
S0006	reasonable
S0018	cos i be think if her eyesight isn't that good we could do all of the photos on a single page
S0006	well we can sort that out we can sort her eyesight be quite good
S0018	mm hm
S0006	her write be be incredible when she write
S0018	mm hm
S0006	she
S0005	you'll have to go through the photograph
S0006	oh yes
S0005	and sort out what you which one's you want
S0006	this be what i'm gonna do with and with in particular i'm sure will be very interest in 's you know in cos she's get a little girl
S0018	yeah
S0005	yes of course
S0006	five lola and um um come over to england about ten or twelve years ago
S0018	mm hm
S0006	and she meet that's 's wife that be now
S0018	mm hm
S0006	um and also i want i want um to be on the photograph as well
S0005	hmm
S0006	and now my my nephew
S0005	well you'll just have to go through them
S0006	my nephew nephew's from the north
S0018	mm hm
S0006	they come as well and my nephew's ex wife she come with her husband and um
S0005	she wasn't in any of the photograph except hide behind somebody's head
S0006	we haven't tell her
S0005	she's the one that that we say she's
S0018	she be the one that get away yeah
S0006	if i would judge um i haven't count the ones but i would judge we're look at in between twenty and thirty photograph
S0005	i doubt it
S0006	out of them
S0005	you're pick these number out of the air you haven't even go through them i've see
S0006	well
S0005	make a start
S0006	well i will i will go through them
S0018	hmm
S0006	i will go through them
S0018	there might be an idea in that case
