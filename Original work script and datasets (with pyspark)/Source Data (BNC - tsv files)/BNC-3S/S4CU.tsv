S0521	volkswagen td whatever
S0519	oh you
S0520	oh you could
S0519	it be a very sweet little van we get
S0520	it's always funny when you have a new car and you don't know where the bits be some of them have things inside that you
S0519	that you tweak yeah
S0520	open the outside on
S0521	mm yeah
S0519	yeah that's right
S0520	yeah
S0521	i find a switch inside it open the bonnet
S0521	i saw the girl look at me from the
S0520	yeah no you start to feel a bite self conscious don't you
S0521	inside the er the the
S0520	i couldn't on the bike in thailand i couldn't work out how to turn off the indicator
S0520	cos there's like a switch that you click
S0519	mm
S0520	to the right to turn it the right indicator on and vice versa and then how do you turn it off you think you just flick it back to the middle but it doesn't it just go right indicator leave indicator right indicator you know like and er then you're drive along with indicators on which isn't ideal so eventually i figure out you have to press it as a like press it as a button
S0521	ah
S0519	ah
S0520	to turn it off yeah it take me age it's the kind of thing you don't want to stop and ask someone just you feel like a bite of a knob
S0520	oh
S0519	er so that's a bite odd isn't it you have to open the passenger door
S0521	i think it lock doesn't it it it say on the cap it's a lock cap
S0519	so but what be happen so i dad and i meet at in a a mark and spencer's sort of petrol station
S0520	mm
S0519	er and buy a toasty and a coffee and i get in his passenger side and it so i i didn't have a lot of room so i be kind of squeeze out and every time i squeeze out i open the petrol cap and so every time i go to close the door it wouldn't close cos the petrol cap wasn't in
S0521	ah
S0520	mm
S0519	erm so i'd realise but it's a bite daft cos if you're the only driver then you have to go round open the passenger door
S0520	yeah
S0519	to open the petrol cap it's a bite weird isn't it
S0520	very weird these germans you expect more from them
S0519	i be listen be you listen
S0521	it a volkswagen diesel as well
S0520	i saw that it be a volkswagen
S0521	pollute the country
S0520	yeah
S0519	be you listen to the volkswagen programme
S0520	guilty
S0521	yes
S0519	i be think you would be
S0520	on radio four
S0519	it be interest
S0521	it be interest wasn't it
S0519	they be say that volkswagen really be quite a corrupt company really be what they be say weren't they
S0521	yeah
S0519	erm or not corrupt but that it be
S0521	it be a family business
S0519	the it be a family business and you need a board that that would question what be happen so
S0520	i see yeah
S0519	they all they be all say you know what do you think happen and they say they all the panel all agree they be all experts that erm everybody on the board would need to just ask the question so you have somehow very cheaply manage to make the engines do this
S0521	much less emissions
S0519	much less emissions how do you do it
S0521	yeah
S0519	erm and they didn't ask that question
S0521	evidently wasn't ask
S0520	oh i see because everyone's on the inside type of thing
S0519	erm yeah exactly so everybody just say oh great they've do it cheaply let's just go with that
S0520	i'd be surprise if you investigate any company that you wouldn't find all sort of things go on
S0519	yeah
S0520	i mean i don't
S0519	i i like what these people be say they be say the the the roll of the board be to keep a check that the check and balance of you know balance out make the profit against run ethically and all of those things
S0520	ethical things yeah
S0519	erm and that be all the board so they all just basically say you know where do the buck lie they still didn't really get to who do it so who decide
S0521	who's responsible well yeah they say that that the board be responsible
S0519	er but every engineer in the in the company
S0521	must have know
S0519	have to know
S0521	yeah
S0519	that you're you've put a part in that do this thing you know maybe the people actually fit the part don't know it but all of the engineer know
S0520	mm
S0519	so it's er it's dire but they seem to also say which i think be really interest and quite good that they didn't actually think that any other company be do it that they be all you know
S0521	yes bmw be fine
S0519	cheat on their emissions slightly and that there be gonna be big repercussions for diesel cars but erm nobody be actually in this terrible situation of just lie
S0519	cheat basically
S0520	cheat the system yeah
S0519	so the the thing be er erm they be set this task to meet the emissions level that the americans want and all of the other car manufacturers come up with engineer solutions that cost a lot of money and therefore their cars be dearer the performance wasn't quite a good and other factor come in but they meet the criteria
S0520	mm mm
S0519	whereas they just cheat and so they be really popular cos everybody think well you can get this cheap
S0520	affordable yeah
S0519	affordable clean system
S0519	oh oh oh oh
S0520	it's damage isn't it for the brand the whole thing
S0519	terrible
S0521	damage for the make in germany brand
S0520	agree agree yeah
S0521	there be a german on the panel wasn't it
S0520	it sort of make you reflect doesn't it
S0519	yeah there be a german on the panel
S0521	that's what he say it's damage for the make in germany brand
