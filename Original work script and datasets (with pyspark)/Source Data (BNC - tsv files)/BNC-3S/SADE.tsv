S0653	mm
S0655	erm be this a train race
S0653	be this an actual race or be it just a race to get things
S0654	a train race
S0653	oh wow an actual race
S0655	thank you for take a lot of my section
S0654	a race which have things
S0655	it be not on my section
S0654	a person who who do
S0653	a person who what
S0654	and the person who do not break down at any time
S0653	yeah be be what
S0654	have fast wheel
S0653	mm
S0654	and be really good
S0653	mm
S0654	be the winner five hundred pound
S0655	and do he win
S0654	he win
S0653	yay
S0654	with his rocket he win with the rocket mum
S0653	that be a lot of money in those days
S0655	five hundred pound
S0653	mm
S0655	now now money here be different that would be about five million now
S0654	the one with the rocket everybody be surprise
S0653	be about five hundred thousand
S0655	be that more than five million
S0653	he spend more than five million
S0655	no be that more than five million
S0653	i've just say it's probably about five hundred thousand the equivalent of cos it'd be a a year's salary like and a really good year salary erm so why do people not expect him to win
S0655	cos he be new
S0654	no because he suggest it first and then all and then the presidents of things they want to do the race and they think they could prove his wrong him wrong
S0653	about what though
S0654	about his idea for the first ever rocket
S0653	i don't what what be they prove him wrong about or try to
S0655	that's your section that his rocket be the fastest
S0654	be this my section
S0655	no this be my section there
S0654	these little bits be mine
S0655	no that be yours
S0654	and then
S0653	what what be they try to prove him wrong
S0654	they be try one of them who's really already idiotic say they can't let him kind he doesn't think that it's okay but
S0653	but why though
S0654	well he do
S0653	do they think it be dangerous or that it just wouldn't work or what
S0654	i guess they didn't work they wouldn't work but then before that they couldn't create they couldn't put the rocket on wooden rail
S0653	why
S0654	so cos it would just break so they put metal rail instead
S0653	be it george behind that
S0654	no one of his men and then mum
S0653	mm
S0654	they have to go they build their own factory and own rail and own rocket and he have a son call george i mean robert
S0655	robert robert that's a good name for a son
S0653	see he's the one i've hear of robert louis stevenson
S0654	never george

S0653	what a clever person
S0654	and it be very fun in the begin cos whenever he up something he go
S0653	sorry what

S0653	what that he want to be an inventor
S0654	no if if you want to go do a job get the job do
S0653	wow so people didn't want train then
S0654	they didn't even know about train they just call them train want for them to be call train

S0655	midwinter
S0653	before christianity come a long and st nicholas be another word for another name for father christmas isn't it that's sort of just how things develop so how be things take around how be things transport in the in the country before the railway then the invention of the train do you think do you know
S0655	i think i do
S0654	boat boat or old fashion cars which couldn't go much further
S0653	not cars

S0654	but not george stephenson he go from there to there to there to there
S0653	well he sound like an amaze person
S0655	i sound like an amaze person
S0653	would you like to go to the science museum to go and look at his rocket
S0654	yeah and i might want to piece of it back
S0653	great idea
S0655	so you can do it for show and tell
S0654	yeah put a picture of it in his book
S0653	do he
S0654	and we might be able to get a model from it for the museums
S0653	mm
S0655	if i saw a photo of it i could erm draw a sketch of it and you could say this be what my brother draw of the rocket
S0653	i keep mean to take you to place in where samuel pepys be as well
S0655	samuel pepys
S0653	because you like him don't you
S0654	he's really interest
S0655	mum have i have enough chicken
S0654	cos of all the curly wurly hair he have flat hair straight hair like
S0653	mm
S0654	like
S0655	have i have enough cos i only have these leave
S0654	like that hair
S0653	but i think in the picture he have curly hair
S0654	that's cos he wear a wig
S0653	oh and what do he bury under the great fire of london

S0653	mm
S0654	they go to put a they i think they put a pigeon they they put it in one of the boat one of the pigeons
S0653	and where do we need to take still
S0654	to the library of simon pepys
S0653	yeah
S0654	you can still see the you can still see his book and he write in a different language and he
S0653	he write in a code didn't he a special code
S0654	yeah
S0655	write
S0653	do you know not quite but it be very funny we read about this didn't we when we go to mummy's old college so there be erm so he leave he bequeath that's call he leave his library to oh some family member anyway they donate it to magdalene and there it be and somebody really want but for years they didn't want what the diary's say and the reason why he put it in code be because he be talk about the people of his day sometimes in not very nice like an honest way not a mean way
S0655	yeah honest way
S0653	but in those days you would really get into trouble if people find out about what you think anyway so it be a code so one of the people erm make it their lifetime's work to try and crack the code okay
S0655	and they just have to find out erm twenty six erm something letter
S0653	no it's a very complicate code and what they they spend about didn't they i think thirty years try to crack the code and then they realise i think the same week that in samuel's library his collection of book there be a little book explain the code so if he'd just read that then he would have understand the code they didn't really need to have spend thirty years crack it
S0655	they might have be able to cos the most er erm nearly crack the code on that or on the thing that
S0654	what code
S0655	erm you know erm get those erm things where you can line up different letter like a be t
S0653	mm mm
S0655	i just put
