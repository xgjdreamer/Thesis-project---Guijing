S0152	too much calcium what create calcium
S0012	yeah and it create these these er crystals in your bladder and that become really hard to go to the loo you know like the kettle have get
S0152	yeah
S0012	that's what happen
S0152	yeah but but
S0012	and and that's all down to your your your kidneys not be able to
S0152	able to filter it out and
S0012	filter it out properly
S0152	cos you need calcium for your strength of your bone and everything else
S0012	you do yeah yeah
S0152	kind of wonder if it's anything he work with a long long time ago that's cause it
S0012	yeah you never know do you i mean they only just find out about asbestosis a few years ago didn't they
S0152	yeah you know be it something that you work with a long time ago and you know if you think about what you work with when you first start to work
S0012	oh there be no health and safety then be there
S0152	yeah and what i what i work with even thirty thirty years ago you can you can't work with that stuff now
S0012	no no you can't
S0013	no
S0012	but a few years only a few years ago if you change your wheel change the and put new brake pad or brake shoe in they be all make of asbestos
S0152	mm
S0012	and you could actually smell it when you blow them out
S0152	yeah
S0012	clean them out
S0013	mm
S0012	that all go in didn't it
S0152	yeah you know just think about all those you know well it's it's like a lot of engineer have problems didn't they because they never wash their hand and they've get the engineer oil and they've get
S0012	yeah well that er swarfega that they use be carcinogenic at one time that's okay now
S0152	yeah
S0012	but when
S0012	we use to have tin of tin of swarfega
S0152	yeah the green stuff yeah
S0012	to clean your hand up
S0152	yeah
S0012	and that use to get all the grease and oil off off your hand didn't it
S0152	yeah
S0012	but that be carcinogenic
S0152	well it have something like a benzene ring in it or something
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	you know i be think about the stuff that i use to use when i be a science technician you know some of the stuff in the chemical cupboard
S0012	i know terrible
S0152	you know i look in our
S0013	mm
S0152	in our chemical store at school it be like we ain't get much in here compare to what i use to have in mine
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0152	can't keep it
S0012	no
S0152	can't keep it
S0012	no
S0152	can't have that can't have the other
S0012	well
S0013	yeah
S0012	at school we be we use to make gunpowder
S0152	yeah
S0012	with saltpetre er carbon sulphur mix it all together there be something else that go with it but i can't remember what it be but the saltpetre be one one of the main ingredients and er you mix it together and place it between two er like not cast iron steel plat and hit it and it use to explode
S0013	yeah
S0012	and we make that at school
S0013	yeah
S0012	so what do we do when we be kid we go up the chemist and you could buy the stuff

S0012	cor
S0152	or sodium chlorate calcium chlorate and he go what be you do and he go i'm just do this he go do you realise the army won't use that cos it's so unstable

S0012	yeah
S0152	lot of different things like that but no blind it's too light now or
S0012	we use to put it in er well our teacher use to put it in a treacle tin and hammer the treacle tin down and of course it burn up from the bottom and that use to set alight the heat and boom that use to

S0012	yeah
S0152	right and you've get a mean to puff air in it like that
S0012	yeah
S0152	so you put your coffee mate in you light the well you light the candle you your coffee mate's all in the bottom you push air in to pump it so the air make the coffee mate live inside the can
S0012	yeah
S0152	that catch fire and blow the lid off the top
S0152	cos that's how a combustion engine work
S0013	oh right
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	i tell you that the experiment they do on the television
S0013	mm
S0012	just just the other day with er custard be it not custard erm
S0013	cornflour
S0152	cornflour
S0012	cornflour
S0013	mm
S0012	do it with cornflour they have a bunsen burner and an air gun you know just a just a
S0152	yeah
S0012	pressure air gun and they blow the cornflour over the bunsen burner and that go poof
S0152	yeah same type of thing yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	cos that's what coffee mate be in some respect isn't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	well it be ain't it yeah
S0152	a type of dry flour cornflour
S0012	cornflour and and dry milk and stuff like that yeah
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	with a with a bite of sugar in to give it a bite of flavour
S0012	but er i mean dust in itself be pretty dangerous
S0152	yeah
S0012	because i remember in silos it be a few years ago when they use to pump the er barley and and what have you that use to create dust and they use to have dust explosions
S0152	yeah
S0012	in the silos blow them up
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	so when er i expect they have something different now to do it
S0152	they have some form of earth device
S0012	yeah
S0152	so you don't get a spark or something but no it's some of the things you do we use to make lead
S0012	make lead
S0152	yeah
S0012	do you yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	use to have you use to have lead oxide
S0012	oh right yeah
S0152	and there be different there be different colour there be red and there be yellow
S0012	we use to do it with copper
S0152	and you get a carbon block right you get a carbon block you would put the lead oxide in the carbon block
S0012	yeah
S0152	you'd get a blow torch bunsen burner and you'd blow so you're add heat to the thing
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you'd get little lump of lead
S0012	cor right yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	yeah
S0012	run out yeah well
S0013	mm
S0012	and that they use to have that er blue that be call copper oxide weren't it that blue stuff
S0152	copper sulphate
S0012	copper sulphate that's right and er you could you could make
S0152	crystals out of it
S0012	crystals out of that yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	we use to go worm
S0152	one of the things be how many worm could you get up in an area
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you'd have three different solution you'd have water
S0012	yeah
S0152	you'd have wash up liquid and then you'd have a very very dilute potassium permanganate
S0012	oh right
S0152	which if you get stain it purple you couldn't do that now
S0012	no you couldn't do anything like that now
S0013	mm
S0152	and you use to get crystal potassium permanganate and you'd show how diffusion in water and things like that just one crystal you drop this piece of potassium permanganate in and you'd watch it
S0012	grow
S0152	not you'd watch all the colour come out of it
S0012	oh i see right
S0152	and go in the water
S0012	yeah
S0152	so it like diffusion
S0012	cos we use to grow crystals too didn't we
S0152	yeah yeah er in silica that be the way you do
S0012	yeah
S0152	some crystals and you put some silica in and
S0012	yeah
S0152	and they'd grow then look at them
S0012	we use to leave them leave them there for about a week and what have you and you'd look at them every day and they'd all different wonderful shape
S0152	yeah
S0012	they use to grow these crystals didn't they
S0152	you can buy kit that do that now
S0012	i suppose you can yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but they're all safe
S0152	yeah
S0152	nothing dangerous in them
S0013	mm
S0012	that be that's weird how the how time change though cos in our science lab every i don't know whether er they still have it but every stage be a bunsen burner
S0152	yeah still have that
S0012	you still have that do you
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah don't have as many but you still have them
S0012	yeah
S0152	mm still have them
S0012	and then that seem a very very small place when i go back to school and saw their lathes and what have you we have load of lathes colchester students er can't remember them all but there be there be about five or six different lathes they we have nice big ones you know god that's how i learn all my skills in there
S0152	it's just how you set the room up
S0012	yeah but i'm i'm sure they have more stuff more stuff in
S0152	oh yeah
S0012	and and they have they have a
S0013	mass of computers now isn't it
S0012	yeah in the metal work where they have the forge they have two forge
S0152	yeah
S0012	have you still get a forge
S0152	can't have them
S0012	you can't have forge
S0152	you don't you don't do the stuff anymore you you don't do the stuff
S0012	that's how
S0013	mm
S0012	learn his trade
S0013	mm
S0012	i mean he make this these pokers where be they
S0152	on the side
S0013	they're there
S0012	be they
S0013	this side
S0152	er the one here
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	which one be it there's one here and then there's er there's one in the other room
S0152	yeah
S0012	he make all of that and there's another one the poker one this be this be the toast fork but he he give us that on our wed anniversary weren't it
S0013	think so yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah you
S0152	you can't do stuff like that now
S0012	you can't do it now that's amaze ain't it
S0152	i mean the reason be be because they're try to do away with it
S0012	mm yeah
S0152	in in the old build erm we use to well when i first go to as it be we have a forge which have coke in it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	that type of thing with a hood that come out
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	and then we have a refurb and then we go to a ceramic one
S0012	oh right
S0152	so you have ceramic er gas ceramic ones
S0012	yeah
S0152	and that be alright it do but you have a little core in and the gas come round and it go through and that be that be alright
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm and then you have a couple of hearts hearths at the side of it and then when i go to we have a hearth and a forge that type of thing but if you you know it didn't wasn't on the syllabus you didn't have to teach it
S0012	ah
S0152	so what they what the governments do be they take stuff off
S0012	yeah
S0152	therefore you don't need it
S0012	that's right
S0013	mm
S0152	and then your head teacher or whatever get some idea
S0012	mm
S0152	won't support it
S0012	mm
S0152	so it disappear
S0012	yeah
S0152	it's like it's like
S0013	yeah
S0012	it's all these skills that that's how they've all die out though ain't it all the skills
S0013	mm mm
S0012	i mean they're cry out for old skills again aren't they
S0013	yeah
S0152	i mean that's i mean that you know it that's i mean that be excellent but you know if you know how to do it
S0012	yeah
S0152	but the kid the the thing with that now be the kid wouldn't have the patience to do it
S0012	they wouldn't would they no no
S0152	they wouldn't they wouldn't sit and i think the way that one that one be make be either you cut the the rod into into little piece
S0012	mm
S0152	so you cut the top into square and you pull it out
S0012	yeah
S0152	you extend it out and then you twist it round
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	but they just just don't have
S0012	and then you have to it out
S0152	yeah so you you've gotta cut in there first
S0012	and the the skill be to know where the where you put the heat
S0152	where you know it's not that it's not i mean it be that's a difficult one to do
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	we've get another one in the other room that make that go with that don't it
S0013	yeah mm
S0012	that be a poker fantastic
S0013	yeah
S0152	yeah well i could do a bite of it
S0012	yeah
S0152	i can't do any er you know be a long time
S0012	yeah well we we have everything in that school we have we have the forge and we have the anvils we have the lot
S0152	mm we've get we've get we've get er a in my in one of the workshops now i've get there's a great big there's a wood turn lathe a graduate wood turn lathe there be a large lathe metal work lathe
S0012	yeah
S0152	a big one i have to use that the other week for the first time
S0012	be it a big old herbert be it
S0152	yeah
S0012	that's a herbert the have they still get that
S0152	i think it i think it be but it's a it's a big one
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm and er get it go be different it's not the normal way you get it go you have to pull a lever up on the saddle
S0012	yeah that's right
S0152	to move it
S0012	yeah
S0152	where usually it's on
S0012	to engage it
S0152	usually engage on here to turn it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	this be actually on the on the thread on the saddle
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	er because i have to cos i when i do my safety course i have to prove that i could do the set the tool
S0012	yeah
S0152	i have to set the tool the part off tool as well as the face tool
S0012	yeah
S0152	i have to centre drill
S0012	yeah
S0152	take some out the centre face off and then turn out
S0152	and then
S0012	that be my first test after i get a a job whether i could make a face plate for a chuck with the inside screw thread
S0152	right
S0012	and the and the face plate which be calibrate all the way round it and the hole drill in so that you can put the chuck onto it tighten it up and that be my first job at engineer when i go for a job there after my apprenticeship and i pass that with fly colour cos you have spickets and everything
S0152	mm
S0012	the lot you know gotta fit in properly to within one half of a thou otherwise the chuck be all like this
S0152	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	i know so you've you've still get er things
S0013	mm
S0152	but it all depend on how what you wanna do
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	you know they someone be gonna do some bowl carve in the sense of aluminium bowl carve well you've gotta have the sand bag you've gotta have the planishing hammer you've gotta
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	the only trouble i have with lathes
S0013	mm
S0012	be they're alright hand and i'm leave hand
S0152	mm
S0012	so i'm work like that whereas you're suppose to work like that
S0152	yeah
S0012	and i work like that you see but that work out i could do it you just you just adapt don't you you have to
S0152	yeah that i have to do the i have to do the wood turn one as well
S0012	yeah
S0152	i quite like wood turn it's quite easy
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm totally different to metal turn
S0012	oh it's totally different to metal turn
S0152	you know it's more feel or whatever
S0012	yeah
S0152	but you have to you have to set up a
S0012	wood too
S0152	and it's quite funny cos the guy say we be turn between centre and he go well you put a cross here and you put a cross there he say and then you line it up on the tail stop and i go well well you don't usually have a rotate centre on a wood lathe
S0012	no
S0152	and he look and say that's a rotate centre on the tail stop
S0012	on the tail stop yeah
S0152	oh right i say i say then you have then you have the fish tail at the front
S0012	yeah
S0152	and he go yeah he say and you just he say and then you he say you just marry it up i say don't you centre punch it
S0152	he go what and this be the guy give the train
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and i go well if you centre punch the two end of your piece of material
S0012	you know where you
S0152	you know where your centre be roughly
S0152	and you can line it up on the pin at the front
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then on the tail stop
S0012	yeah
S0152	i say and then if you put a cut in across the diagonal with a tenon saw
S0012	yeah
S0152	i say it line up it line up a lot easier than if you just try and put a cut across
S0012	yeah
S0152	he say oh i've never see that before that's good ain't it
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0012	lot of different things yeah there there's so many short shortcuts when when i be an apprentice they ask we use to have to make these er bear house for saw bench and they be turn them all out by hand and i think there must be an easier way to this do this so i make up this you'd be fit it fit it in your tail stock and that be too sharp cos that that that be an aluminium that i be cut and you i slide it in into the and you just push it in like that and that cut out lovely and all you have to do be finish it off and i be make no end of these things and get bonus for er for them and have to hide them up because i mean you're allow about five minutes each for them and i be do them in a minute right
S0012	because of my jig that i'd make up my my special tool that i'd make
S0152	special tool you make
S0012	which i have to hide up every night and i be get no end of money bonus well i mean when you when you think i be get six and six an hour which be what thirty three pence thirty five pence something like that an hour but the bonus be a half a crown an hour so that make your money up no end you know and in the end i be get ten bob an hour plus plus a half a crown an hour bonus years ago now ain't it
S0152	yeah
S0012	but we we be make a lot of money it be good and me and we work at engineer me and my cousin we use to do so much work we use to hide it up and go fish and the foreman use to clock us in and clock us out
S0152	can't do it now
S0012	god you couldn't do anything like that now no no
S0152	no it's just totally different now
S0013	mm
S0012	but i mean we use to have the time and motion study people come along well that be it weren't it they use to stand there funnily enough they know nothing about lathe turn or anything like that they use to stand there in their white coat with their stopwatch right go on you gotta do this that and the other and you'd get five minutes for it right he'd go away you could do it in a minute
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah but there you go i mean that be that be er what they charge they be make money we be make money
S0152	yeah
S0012	and that be it
S0152	yeah yeah erm
S0013	like you're do it fast haven't you
S0012	you've gotta look like you're do you know what you're do you have yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but then you make a when you make a tool up specially to do what you've do by hand you know just work your tool in every now and then by hand and make it bigger and bigger and bigger and then then measure with your calliper and then
S0152	yeah
S0012	then your vernier and get that right that take a long while but when you've gotta tool that that do it one go and you've just gotta skim out a couple of thou
S0152	mm
S0012	it's do ain't it
S0152	always look for easy ways to do something
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	only take a bite of think what use to annoy me though with these place that i work in they use to have this box an ideas box which you put your idea in and if they take it on you use to get pay a couple of quid extra in your wage packet but they would be make hundreds of pound out of your ideas
S0152	yeah
S0012	at where i use to work this bloke they have an ideas box of how to oxygenate the water that be get that they be pass through and this here bloke just put it in shingle he get twenty six quid for it and they save them thousands of pound well hundreds of thousands of pound
S0152	mm
S0012	oxygenate oxygenate the water and then return it back to where to be recycle you see
S0152	recycle
S0012	and they just use to pump it over over the shingle which bounce it about
S0152	mm
S0012	oxygenate it and back in it go and and they make a lot of money out of that
S0152	there's always i mean there's there's always ways to do things i mean i remember be a lab when i be a lab technician if you know what your syllabus be or the you could organise yourselves now if you we i have i have fifteen staff teach staff and i have at one point i have five technicians and a and two workshop technicians and then they start cut back and it go down to one workshop technician and three lab technicians
S0012	well
S0152	and it you know it be like what be you gonna do
S0012	mm
S0152	we'll get it sort you know we'll get it sort not a problem and i er i say but it's down to the staff you've gotta you've gotta stick to i want your equipment sheet in on a friday so we know what lessons you want for the follow week if you if you don't put it in on friday and somebody else want it
S0013	mm
S0152	and i use to label it one two three when they come in so that the same piece of equipment
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	it be like you you you know you can't have it cos you be late get it in type thing
S0152	and some staff hat that
S0012	do they
S0152	sorry but that's the way it be
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it be er we get it we get it down to a t absolutely down to a t in the sense that you put your lessons out you put your lessons out and if you could you would put your lessons out for the whole day
S0012	yeah
S0152	so by eleven o'clock by tea break at eleven o'clock you might be move some stuff about but everything come out for that day
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then you would be tidy up what you need
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it would be like oh can we can we have this and you'd no not really well if you give me ten minutes i might be able to do it type of thing
S0152	so you always
S0013	mm
S0152	you always find a way round
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then they bring this rule in that they be close and that they be close at christmas so christmas holiday close
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you have to take your annual leave
S0012	well
S0152	and the argument be well i don't wanna take it at christmas
S0012	no
S0152	i don't wanna take it at christmas
S0012	you want it in the summer time
S0013	mm
S0012	
S0152	i want it in the summer
S0012	yeah
S0152	or i want it at easter or you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and when you've only get twenty days at that point in time
S0012	yeah
S0152	which you didn't have the same holiday as teachers you know erm well i would like a couple of days here and a couple of days there and and i why should i take it in the at christmas
S0012	yeah
S0152	i don't want to take it at christmas i'll have my christmas days off but i won't take it i say well what about if we work overtime don't get pay for it but we it allow us to have the christmas period off
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it be like well will you be able to do it in that period of time like heck you will
S0152	so we we we just we keep a book
S0012	yeah
S0152	we we be suppose to finish at half past four which be what we do but we work till six o'clock
S0012	yeah
S0152	so er an hour and fifteen minutes four nights a week
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know
S0012	yeah
S0152	so you're look at what that's four hours look at five hours
S0012	yeah
S0152	you don't need to do many weeks
S0013	mm
S0152	lead up to christmas to get that time off
S0013	mm
S0012	no that's right yeah
S0152	and sometimes it'd be a little bite later and you know everything everything be do wasn't wasn't a problem come christmas period have all the time off
S0012	yeah
S0152	and still have your christmas and still have your normal holiday time and it be like yeah and you know like you say like time and motion you can take a long time do something if you're be watch because you need to but if you need to get it do you can
S0013	mm
S0012	you can get it do in half the time
S0152	you can get it do in half the time
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	it's like it's like the summer holiday they use to say right you've get you know literally you have to do a spring clean on every classroom
S0012	yeah
S0152	okay don't have a classroom each with your three and er er in the summer time there be only two technicians cos one be only part time so there be two of us and we use to literally start in one lab and we have it straightforward we get we didn't i decide that i weren't gonna wash the test tube
S0012	oh right
S0152	because i could buy test tube that be quite cheap and all you do be replace them
S0012	yeah
S0152	so i use to buy really er test tube for some experiment which get use three or four time
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then for the real ones we have but a lot of it you use to buy the pyrex test tube so their cupboards would have large test tube large and small test tube and a rack of pyrex test tube
S0012	yeah
S0152	pyrex ones you wash
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you have a you keep a bucket with this stuff in erm and you use to leave them to soak and you'd leave them to soak over the weekend didn't have a dishwasher or anything like that
S0012	no
S0152	which a lot of place have now but you just let them soak over the weekend in a sink of hot water come in on a monday morning undo the sink swill them all out nice and
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	absolutely nice so the summer holiday they'd start okay and i would do this one lab all new beakers all the cupboards sweep out and we it all the catch pot have to be do as well
S0012	yeah
S0152	oh they be horrendous
S0152	so then you have to get rid of all the junk out of that so the flow would run and everything you couldn't do that they wouldn't allow you to do that now but and we would
S0012	things use to go down the sink in the in the science lab then
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	down the sink and into the
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	sewage system
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	you can't do that any more
S0152	no so within a six week holiday if we have a six week holiday three weeks we would literally be get everything do all the prep room tidy all the book remark you know
S0012	yeah
S0152	label up all the rack make up literally tons
S0013	mm
S0152	and then for a week we have nothing to do
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0152	and we use to sit and play card
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and we always keep an eye out in case anybody be come
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you always have a one job that you didn't need to be do but that's what you'd be do if if like the head of department turn up to do
S0012	well when we be on night shift there's the amount of people that
S0013	mm
S0012	use to take a kip under the bench bring their they use to bring their own sleep bag
S0152	yeah
S0012	on the night shift and they'd take a kip between about one and four in the morning and they'd kip
S0152	yeah
S0013	i don't know how you could do that though how you can sleep
S0012	what with all the racket go on
S0013	well no
S0012	well when you're knackered you can sleep anywhere can't you
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	i never do
S0013	but you're suppose to be work weren't you

S0012	that's right yeah yeah
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	and they show you all the different varieties of bananas
