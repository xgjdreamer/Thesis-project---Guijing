S0266	be it ah it's record erm you say that you've just eh retire recently eh what do you retire from
S0310	erm the where i be head of career
S0266	mm mm
S0310	erm so
S0266	what kind of things so can you tell us a bite about what your job involve
S0310	i mean in the last sort of ten eleven years that i be there i be actually manage people who be deliver the service erm although i do continue to see students myself eh about erm ten percent of my time erm i think probably it's more interest to describe what a career adviser do rather than what the person who manage them do erm so there's within universities of course university be free agents we're at liberty to kind of define the job how we want to but if erm i mean be the fourth university i'd be in so
S0266	which be the other ones
S0310	erm i start off eh at the begin i be in at erm and then erm because basically i get marry and my husband keep be move around erm i be at what now be which at the time be and then i be at shortly before it become when it be which be sort of post have children when the children be small that be my sort of go back to work job part time
S0310	and then i go to erm i suppose when they be about six and seven so within the sort of erm if you like the the sort of common thread of the job within universities erm a career adviser would be allocate to certain discipline so they would have effectively a kind of portfolio of academic departments so erm for example at we have somebody who erm have be a biochemistry academic so he cover all science and engineer discipline erm and within that element of the role erm you would erm develop good relationships with the head of department and with usually there would be a particular member of academic staff who would be responsible for things like erm erm support the student manage more sort of personal tutor that go on through which you would be able to get your service sort of advertise erm in some departments this be where the greatest variation be erm in some universities and in some departments within certain universities but not others there might be a career module so some career advisers would also be lecturers erm and some of ours do that in certain departments so in managements and in i can't remember the other department but that would be a teach module that they would mark and so on so that's a quite a different set of responsibilities really because effectively you're have to design a teach package and so and the fund as a manager get quite erm a lot more complicate if you're get internal money from departments for buy out certain career adviser time erm but the what career advisers in all universities do would be to see students on an individual basis and to see and to see students on in a group basis so whereas you might if you've get erm a commitment a teach commitment within the department you'd be slot into the timetable we also run erm a programme of erm group work sessions which students could book into erm completely independent of their department so we would cover erm a whole variety of things and that would be we'd we'd sort of debate what be necessary for the forthcoming year and look at movements in the market and what we might need to ensure they know about and erm look at erm how successful they'd be in previous year as to whether we repeat them but you'd always get the sort of four or five core bread and butter sort of topics which be about market yourself find out about employers erm perform at interview pass selection test erm network creative job hunt all those sort of bout five or six sort of core eh sessions we would we would run anyway but there might be other things which we'd top it up with depend on perhaps you know if the market have slump in one particular area or something we might run sessions on erm erm you know alternatives to or
S0267	so so do you see it as er your responsibility to guide them into what be out there jobwise
S0310	erm yes the very frustrate thing for the majority of career service
S0310	be that it's quite rare for it to be compulsory for students to use the service
S0266	that's what i be go to ask
S0267	mm
S0310	so there be a huge amount of effort that go into actually advertise it market it internally to students and sell them the benefit because we have plenty of data to show that if you use your career service you're go to do better
S0266	mm yeah yeah
S0310	but whether that's because the people who would do better tend to but i don't know erm but that's that's always sort of an issue erm
S0266	mm
S0310	and the other flip side of that issue be if they do all come there's no way we'd have enough resources to see them all
S0266	mm
S0310	so erm i mean the workload issue particularly on the one to one basis erm probably during my time quadruple i would think
S0267	mm
S0310	and in addition to that when i first start which be probably thirty years ago we have an hour per student nowadays we have ten minutes
S0267	mm
S0266	what can you do in ten minutes
S0310	so not
S0267	well the doctor have to see you in three so what can you tell him in three minutes
S0266	be it three
S0267	yeah three minutes
S0310	three
S0267	three minutes be the allot time
S0266	no
S0267	yeah it be that's why 's leave the practice she say three minutes they're suppose to
S0310	it be ten minutes when my daughter be a gp
S0267	well i mean you some people can be see in three minutes can't they
S0310	but yes it's yes absolutely but they can't predict what's go to walk in through the door
S0267	no they can't so they're actually anticipate
S0310	yes yes yes
S0266	and in what year do they mostly come and visit you
S0310	too late
S0266	mm
S0310	erm probably that be one of the goals we always have be to gradually shift the percentage that leave it until their final year to come erm and one of the benefit
S0266	do do you do you achieve that
S0310	erm yeah it go down to we get it down to about sort of oh i think it's about fifty five percent of students who come on a one to one basis for a final year and so forty five percent be pre final year
S0266	mm
S0310	erm but final year be too late i mean the biggest and most complex decision be what do i want to do with my life and you can't decide that you can't steer them through a decision make process when the timetable for some of the major employers be the same as a ucas timetable so they'd be need to apply to the traditional big scale high fly employers have close date that start in october in some instance they have close date which actually start before the students come back
S0266	really
S0310	so you know there be that that be a really hard hit message that need to be part of the market erm and you know we be sort of take a bite out of it every year really erm but that sort of decision make process the other thing that's difficult to get across in a market sort of erm to successfully in market be that career advisers have mechanisms for help you make that decision that really difficult decision too many students the feedback be well i didn't come to see you because i don't know what i want to do no wrong way round
S0267	mm
S0266	mm
S0310	you come to see us mm right at the begin if you don't know what you want to do that way we've get two years or so to help you plan find out meet people make decisions decide it's wrong go back to the begin again
S0267	mm
S0310	work work through that erm and
S0267	how do you find over the years erm the characteristics of students you know be they be they the same as ten years ago or be they erm you know more interest or lack of interest or erm very kind of friendly erm what's the respect between you two and how have they change over the time
S0310	mm i mean i think it's always be the best bite of the job with the students on the whole be mostly really nice people and it's really fun actually work with them as far as their sort of focus and ability to sort of negotiate all these complex decisions be concern erm you always get the whole range you always get the whole range you always get the people who be completely clueless and don't know where to start in the nicest possible way you know they sort of
S0267	mm
S0310	this be a bite scary i've never have to make my own decision before erm and at the opposite end of the scale you do get and i think the number of those have go up and up and up really over the last ten years particularly that there be a there be a bigger proportion who actually be rather more clue up and understand rather more about what an employer would be look for erm i mean the government have be push all these sort of things like skills base stuff for years now erm you know most of them have have some sort of skills portfolio from when they be at school
S0266	mm
S0310	so those sort of word have become common
S0266	and be they valuable because sometimes when you see your children do them you think what a load of rubbish really
S0310	ah well no what a waste of time yes erm i think an awful lot of them be tokenism and and erm i mean when my kid get them at school you know this i can't remember what they're call but the usual sort of things you know
S0266	and the work experience sort of episodes and things but be you involve at all with the industry in at university
S0310	erm yes
S0266	cos i swear that's what erm catapult my second daughter to success
S0266	it really focus her and she go and work actually for a big company for a year
S0310	yes yes yes there be
S0266	and learn how to do learn everything
S0310	yes erm it there there
S0266	she go to for she go erm for her when do they do it be it the second ah
S0266	be it after the second year or after the first year i can't remember
S0310	it's usually after the second year it's usually the third year out and then hold back for the final year
S0266	yes i think that be the second year yeah so she be still quite sort of immature work reasonably hard but not i don't think completely focus about why or what she be do
S0310	mm mm yeah yes
S0266	and then she go for this sort of sponsor year what do they call it erm intern or placement or whatever
S0310	placement yes yes what subject be she do
S0266	she be do erm business
S0310	yes that's
S0266	whether it be management or i can't remember
S0310	business and engineer be the ones
S0266	but she go to erm and you know be quickly lick into a very slick shape and method of work and give quite a lot of responsibility and it be competitive and it it
S0310	mm mm
S0267	so she want to get back out to work she want to
S0266	well she just get a taste of what life really be about you know you have student job where you're do this
S0310	they're not real
S0267	no no
S0266	but it really get her it sort of wind her up ratchet her up into this sort of world that's
S0267	mm
S0266	and then she go back to university to do her i suppose it would be her fourth year and she really know why she be do what she be do in her fourth year because she'd be out in the real world
S0310	mm yes yes
S0267	mm
S0266	and then she have this real taste for what she actually want to to go and do and she be apply for things well before
S0267	well that's why i mean i think we be go backwards again which be a good thing to apprenticeships because be on an on an apprenticeship
S0310	mm
S0267	erm not do but erm you know he go through the apprenticeship and so do i
S0266	mm
S0310	yes that i mean traditionally it's it's what you know what go around come around but you know apprenticeships be a really good thing
S0267	mm mm yeah they be
S0310	yes because not all of them
S0266	actually
S0310	yeah and not all people want to not all students actually want that sort of sometimes slightly rarefy kind of academic focus all of the time you know
S0267	mm mm
S0266	but it's i rather liken that to you know when you're at school and you have to learn languages and you learn french
S0267	mm
S0266	i mean i use to go on holiday with my parent to but i never really eh clue up to the fact that i be learn french because i would actually find it useful in my life and how i would use it later perhaps when travel or whatever
S0310	mm mm mm
S0267	mm
S0266	and i never really connect the two i just have to do it to pass the o level or something
S0310	yeah
S0267	yeah
S0266	and it's rather like i sort of think very simplify but it's rather like you know go to start a career and think about it while you're at university you've get no idea of exactly
S0266	what what
S0310	yes
S0266	so be that mostly for engineer and business be it
S0310	but yes we use to help erm it depend on which university you're at really whether it's something that be in the culture and if it's in the culture like it be at then erm there would be even students do things like sociology would do it it's a great deal harder to find the placements
S0266	mm
S0310	and a great deal harder to persuade the students that what they might be do be relevant for them but theoretically students could do it with any subject
S0266	subject erm and be renowned for its wonderful sport facilities and degrees
S0310	mm
S0266	so could those kind of people would they be put into a years' industry or placement
S0310	i mean at any discipline any discipline that we have at have an option
S0266	so what kind of thing would they go into though
S0310	they would do erm i mean there aren't degrees at that be actually erm you know actually play sport there there you know the the erm there's a degree call sport and exercise science which be basically a science degree so they're learn about things like erm anatomy and respiration and erm diet for fitness and you know train regimes and all those sort of things so they'd either do a research placement in something like perhaps one of the sport body or possibly the civil service use to take a lot of them because it's pertinent to research for servicemen under stress as well
S0266	right
S0310	erm so eh or they would do something some of them do teach for a year some of them do university research eh and
S0310	ah you know sometimes yeah a few do things like personal train
S0266	mm
S0310	yes yes
S0266	and what about do you also help the overseas students
S0310	mm their demand on us be absolutely huge overseas students be hugely hugely motivate and will take up every service you possibly can offer them
S0266	mm
S0310	erm it's the number of time the government's change the regulations about ability to or you know legal situation as far as get job be concern it's just you know up and down every year really erm but yes in many ways it be they all want to work in the uk basically and erm even under the post study work visa which generate immense sort of optimism that they be automatically go to be able to get a job for two years in the uk afterwards erm unfortunately it didn't make employers want them just because they be legally entitle to work it didn't sell them into a job you know an employee want to take a graduate with a view to the long term they don't want to take somebody who's get to go home after two years
S0266	yeah yeah yeah
S0310	erm
S0267	but although legally they're not suppose to
S0310	legally there's a there's a clash between the law in term of equal opportunities and that be
S0267	yeah mm mm
S0310	i mean one of the things i didn't say be that career advisers have a sort of responsibility to keep up to date with all those sort of things so maybe shoot off to see sort of employers probably on average they do i don't know for the whole team we probably do about forty or fifty employer visit a year so then we'd sort of cascade it to other people erm and some of those and in addition to that there would be sort of regular train days on things like update for post study work visa and those kinds of things erm and there's a very very strong national organisation amongst the university career advisers far stronger than any of the other professional group because erm go back sort of thirty thirty five years or so when it all sort of start to kick off there be an absolute dearth of information that students could look at on what it's like to be a logistics manager on a wet thursday afternoon in february what would you actually be do erm and so nationally erm people do job study and we all compile them into a central sort of well nowadays obviously it's a database erm and they're all update every three years so your young career adviser or your recently appoint career adviser would have sort of portfolio of you know you're go to have to do three job study or whatever as part of your induction and eh and that's you know it's part of a sort of national commitment to keep the kind of expertise up to date and things as well and it also be brilliant for students you know so all the universities even though it's sometimes difficult within your university to get the university to relax their copyright but we have to all do that battle and persuade our university that for these particular piece of work please let us release the copyright you know because the value of it be only if we all do it nationally and the whole thing be you know
S0266	mm
S0310	seven or eight hundred or so erm probably more than that now probably a thousand erm job profile you know there's no value in have six that your university do
S0266	mm
S0310	erm
S0266	do you ever place anyone er overseas
S0310	erm yes i would sort of the terminology isn't quite what we'd use when you say place
S0266	well no i mean for placement for a for a year's perhaps erm
S0310	but but oh yes i mean all the all the language students erm
S0266	would go
S0310	yes
S0266	what the erasmus and perhaps
S0310	and erm yes a lot of them do teach teach english for a year
S0266	yeah
S0310	or they could do an industrial or commercial placement but the number of those be quite tiny because in other european countries as you will well know they don't have this culture of any discipline you know you can't become very easily a an accountant or a market person or something if you've get a degree in a somebody else's language you know you need in it's much more common in other european countries to have the relevant degree to go into the relevant job but we've get this i think tradition that probably go back to fourteen hundred you know when the only degrees you could do be classics or theology
S0266	mm
S0310	erm and so we have this long term sort of tradition that a graduate here when they're take on be a trainee erm in most areas they're trainees whereas if you graduate in germany say you'd probably would be twenty seven and you would have do probably five years worth of different chunk of placements and so on and you'd go into a proper job as it be with a certain level of responsibility
S0267	and you still have child benefit
S0310	yeah
S0267	that's true
S0310	really
S0267	that's true yes cos when we be in that's what happen they be pay through her university
S0267	i get a hundred and sixty four euros a month
S0310	really
S0267	yeah
S0310	that's magic isn't it
S0267	it be yeah
S0310	yes yes yes
S0267	so there you go apparently it's because they understand that by the time their children actually get proper job they be just come up to thirty
S0310	mm yes
S0267	they be
S0310	yes yeah 's probably about the oldest i think isn't it in term of the average graduate age
S0267	yeah
S0310	but eh yes i i think you know when when membership of the eu first take off and erm our visit to employers become european so we all trundle off round and and visit all these employers cos everybody think oh they're all go to get job over here well i mean it didn't happen do it cos the culture and the education systems don't fit so erm ah you know we be there's there's a lot of them who want their first job abroad and by far and away you know if you want to go abroad at all cost then the easiest thing to get into be teach english because you've get that's your skill that you can offer in many countries be you know highly desirable erm or erm it there be students we have a lot of international students as well who've get you know erm a cross between different nationalities and so on who've get their own network and so on erm they also i think benefit by get a master level in the uk if they're want to go abroad because that four years would have be in france the minimum four years of he and if you've do one of your years be a placement i don't think they really that's not really count so just stay on and do a master be be the one thing that can help but erm there be i mean we use to have all the you know all the websites and things for get a graduate job in all these countries but the the record of people actually succeed in any area other than teach would be pitiful absolutely pitiful
S0266	mm
S0310	and some students be so naïve about it you know i can remember students come in and say you know they want to work in finland or something so i'd say oh yeah we can show you who the employers be and this be the employers students who say but i can't understand this
S0266	mm
S0310	it's like okay well how be you go to get a job there if you can't speak finnish you think this through properly
S0267	mm mm
S0266	mm
S0310	erm
S0266	but one be very naïve at that age well a lot of people be i remember not really know what i want to do
S0310	mm mm well there's no reason why young people should know how could they possibly know
S0266	mm
S0310	you know they be only ever go to know about a handful of job that they've come across in their own live
S0266	but i mean yeah or they could be inform which i presume be what you're do so that you can make an inform decision
S0310	mm
S0266	i don't remember as you know a late in my teens ever really be tell much about
S0267	no
S0266	i have a grandmother who expect me to do something and that be about it i didn't
S0267	mostly my my era or my age group be you be either a teacher or a secretary
S0266	females
S0310	yes yes
S0267	mm
S0310	yes college of higher education be quite common but the the the principle of i mean there's a lot of theories that we work to i there's probably three or four different basic theories of career guidance which be about how what be the theory behind how people get to a decision erm and erm you know there's a psychologically base theory which be theoretically what we'd all work to which be psychological basically which be say that make the assumption that once you've get a certain academic achievement then it in effect give you an independence so you can base a decision on your own skills your own value your own set of interest and so i mean that be the the sort of core assumption that the majority of the career service would be base on but you have to be aware with students that you would also come across students who be go to be make a decision on another basis erm
S0266	for example
S0310	for example erm a sort of something that's ah sociologically base erm so they may feel they're erm erm you know there be family pressure
S0266	follow family traditions
S0267	mm mm mm
S0310	yes yes yes
S0267	mm
S0310	erm or they can be economically base decisions which tend to be more common if you've get something like a recession and be certainly much more common in term of people who perhaps haven't move away from home or be very very common in years go by you know basically if you live in a welsh valley and you be a lad the chance be you'd go down the pit because economically that's basically all there be
S0266	pit mm
S0310	erm so go theoretically anyway and very loosely speak if you get a higher education you get lift out of that
S0266	mm
S0310	erm and then sort of there's another theory about erm can't remember what it be call now but it's about industry experience so make a decision this be where the placement model fit that students can you know if they taste something then they they they're they're involve in actually assess as part of that they may not realise it but they be assess themselves against that role
S0266	mm
S0310	as they're do it erm and so they're think do i feel comfortable with this can i actually do it be it make me want to get out of bed in the morning to come here do i foresee actually come back to that and you be say how your daughter be very motivate you know we use to get the reverse as well we use to get a queue of them
S0266	mm immediately you hate it
S0310	first day first day after they come back from their placement they be usually people who have go to investment bank and they be usually absolutely devastate and they say but that's all i ever want to do i hat it i hat it and now i don't feel i don't anything and that's much better to find out then than in the year after you know
S0266	but thank goodness yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0310	much better which be the real value of placements cos you can find out what you don't want as well
S0266	mm
S0310	but with that sort of model it's very very limit really because you're only ever go to do one placement or possibly two at most erm but you know that's where sort of network can expand it so you know one of the other things that we have be a sort of database of graduate from over the last what ten years
S0310	mm
S0310	he say yes i'll talk to them i'll talk to them about what i do so you could you know you could give them plenty of opportunities to sort of network you know this be the logistics manager you know ring him on one wet friday afternoon in february and ask him what he's do
S0266	mm
S0310	and so it's the what students be best at well you say well how be they different now what they're a bite better at now be actually assess their own skills but in that what we find and what i felt really quite strongly be what they'd actually forget or have have be bypass be actually what be important to them what their value be
S0266	mm
S0310	erm because i think we push skills and skills and skills
S0267	yeah
S0310	for years and the reason we've do that be because that's what the employer be buy
S0267	and competitiveness
S0310	yes
S0266	well the employer now also want erm sound literacy
S0310	yes yes that's one of the skills yes
S0266	so what's happen now er with people you know who might have master and goodness sort of know what but they can't string a grammatically correct sentence together so what's how be the universities go to handle that or how be they handle that
S0310	mm but they can't spell no mm no right ah yes i mean there's more and more go to university and so that problem be be greater and
S0266	mm
S0310	you know i mean but there be employers who be employ who be take out contract with language company to check letter which their graduate write but only where there's a market shortage so they have to recruit people who don't pass you know their their numeracy test one of the test that they frequently do demand that students do be be numeracy and and erm literacy
S0267	mm
S0310	and erm you know we use to run practice ones of those and erm
S0267	er go into the foreign office
S0310	yes
S0267	you do a
S0310	classic
S0267	yes a classic
S0266	my niece fail that three time she be an a star straight student all the way through
S0266	but she couldn't pass it for the life of her
S0310	yeah
S0266	i don't ah be it ask for something that's
S0267	it's three rs actually
S0266	be it
S0267	well it's
S0310	no i don't
S0267	the online test be a little bite like that there be reason verbal reason and er
S0266	i think it's
S0310	there use to be
S0266	but be you talk in your childhood
S0267	eh no no 's he he go for the that's why i know about the foreign office he do it online
S0310	mm mm do he do a practice test beforehand
S0267	and erm no i just think when we use to do the bond book he know all about that do you remember when he be a child we do all the bond book and er you know because he get into
S0310	mm
S0267	er school which be a boys' grammar erm and then he just sit down and and have be out of the the educational system for some years
S0310	mm
S0267	and then just sit down do one of these test without do
S0310	i mean it's about the technique of do it as well
S0267	absolutely yeah
S0266	exam skills
S0310	and about you know it's about what what question be worth do
S0267	mm
S0310	erm be this go to take me too long
S0266	yeah
S0310	erm and erm you know it be worth practise that you know i mean it be like our most popular session be the practice test
S0266	really
S0310	yes we use to give them individual feedback erm numeracy be the one that most people be duff at
S0267	mm
S0310	erm and erm and numeracy be the one which respond to practice more than literacy and spatial reason do so erm you know the various online practice things available but yeah but i mean apart from anything else the civil service be one of the toughest ones
S0267	yeah it be actually yeah yeah
S0310	very tough yeah
S0266	and erm do you keep up with do you trace or follow any of your former students
S0310	mm the government demand that we do
S0266	oh right but or any that you've have a personal interest in
S0310	so all these stats erm not like i use to years ago because there's so many
S0267	mm
S0266	but have have any become sort of great huge high flyers
S0310	erm oh yes i mean what's his name from be what's his name i can't remember his name now
S0266	i don't know
S0310	his i mean he's ceo of
S0266	oh it doesn't matter
S0267	oh he go through there mm
S0310	erm yeah
S0266	do he go through your hand
S0310	erm oh it would have be before my time

S0267	mm
S0310	erm but er there be certainly plenty that get good start and plenty that would come back and talk to students erm and come back for things like career fair and so on erm yes so i mean go back to the do you keep in touch erm the it's a government requirement that erm we collect destination data for all of them and that's a responsibility that's always delegate to career service so you have team on the phone over a period of five or six weeks in the
S0266	mm
S0310	usually february march time to find out what they're do six months afterwards
S0267	mm
S0310	and that's what make the league table and they classify we classify the job erm accord to how good they be in a way so the government can produce you know x percent go into graduate level job and x percent don't
