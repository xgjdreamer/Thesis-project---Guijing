S0120	i think i'd have i would have a good time get drink with some of my cousins
S0058	well i've never do it
S0120	it's never gonna it's never gonna happen
S0058	so why specifically
S0120	ah okay not never unlikely to happen mm
S0058	well this be quite unlikely it be really
S0120	generally we only see each other
S0179	mm
S0120	at family events
S0058	mm well
S0179	erm and family events be sober in your family
S0058	yeah your family's different peter
S0179	no our family be normal well
S0120	his family's different in one direction my family be different in another direction
S0058	fair enough
S0120	another direction
S0179	fundamental law relatives who don't see each other get together don't like each other so you need to drink
S0058	i don't think
S0120	maybe it's maybe it's because of my relatives like each other that we don't have to
S0179	yeah yeah
S0058	yours be more
S0179	liar
S0058	yours be more spread out though no offense
S0120	yeah
S0058	intercontinental
S0120	oh mm
S0058	intercontinental relations
S0120	why
S0058	some of them be in germany
S0179	you're shag a canadian
S0120	we're in the same continent as germany
S0058	oh sorry yes oh
S0179	we're not in continental europe
S0120	but
S0179	we're extra continental europe
S0058	yeah anyway
S0120	erm
S0058	international
S0120	no i be refer to my english english side
S0058	yeah i mean what tend to happen be you know when we be little we use to spend quite a lot of time just us me and my sister and my cousins us all play and you know my parent
S0120	mm hm
S0058	over the traditional they would go out in
S0120	be you similar age
S0058	erm quite similar so be a school year above her which be ten months on me then tom's two school years above her then he's only seventeen i think seventeen months between them as well so there's quite a big difference between and
S0120	eh hmm
S0058	but it's kind of a nice progression of as in me and be the closest in age which be quite weird
S0120	i know
S0058	erm but erm so yeah we always use to kind of hang out together as kid but then since then we've sort of always be around families not really get to know each other so it be nice to actually have a chance to talk as adults and get you know get to know each other which be really nice
S0120	so and i be the only one of our generation of cousins still in our twenties
S0058	oh right be they all older oh yes they're
S0120	i can't remember i've lose track of what what age my my eldest cousin be but right eh well into his forties
S0058	right it's not really the same thing
S0120	no
S0179	well give that your parent be pretty old that make sense
S0058	do they have older siblings like
S0120	erm well my dad's little sister
S0058	okay
S0120	erm be the mother of the cousins who be in the middle the youngest of which be just i think have recently go thirty or thirty one
S0058	okay actually no i'm think thirty that's quite young actually i think i'm get old
S0120	mm i'm not say old it's just
S0058	mm
S0120	enough to have have significant impact on
S0058	mm yeah yeah fair enough whereas 's twenty four
S0120	how we've grow up
S0058	so so kinda the same age as us basically
S0179	mm well the same age as me
S0058	not twenty four quite yet but just essentially the same
S0179	school years
S0058	yeah same school year so yeah
S0120	no be twenty five my housemate
S0058	oh right yeah so kind of as in it's it's
S0120	i mean this be
S0058	not a big yeah

S0179	mm twenty five twenty three isn't as a big difference as say twenty three twenty one
S0058	yeah i'd agree with that
S0120	mm
S0058	well it's different situations in life cos twenty one you're probably still at uni you know final year of uni it's a big difference whereas twenty three twenty five twenty five
S0120	you're probably still unemployed
S0058	depend on the degree
S0179	so a girl i be at school with go straight to uni do a three year geography degree at nottingham last week get a job

S0179	i really felt like ask him so
S0120	his attitude of tolerance be tolerance of intolerance
S0179	yeah
S0058	right
S0179	so i really felt like ask him so so there be a lot of people who think that eh so yeah someone who's black
S0058	mm
S0179	shouldn't be in the church what be your thoughts on that
S0058	maybe to
S0179	i i so i actually say essentially well i personally feel that a white woman be far better able to be a bishop than a black man
S0058	what be your thoughts on that
S0179	what do you say bitch i'm sorry but that's just of all people he should be aware of what it be like to face that kind of attitude
S0058	yeah to face intolerance and prejudice
S0120	mm
S0179	yeah and yet what do he do about it fuck all
S0120	mm
S0058	very sad
S0179	but he he do as little as humanly possible without massively upset anyone but do you think the courageous stance be literally the path of least resistance
S0058	mm pretty
S0179	mm have you see this sheriff somewhere texas who's get this document pertain to be a
S0058	oh
S0120	suppose to be obama's birth certificate

S0120	he be teach how to be a terrorist in indonesia
S0058	right yeah basically it's the only reaction to people like that face palm be pretty much all you can do
S0179	but you know that he's one of the most hat christians
S0058	yeah
S0179	in us history because he introduce free health care
S0179	mm

S0120	it be though
S0058	yeah that thing that be really bad
S0120	i i haven't look into detail but yeah

S0179	turn to crime and it's a long term
S0058	pretty
S0120	well the thing that amuse me be that like the opponents of this describe it as you know european socialism
S0179	mm
S0058	not really
S0120	oh yeah but you also know why america never join the eu
S0058	be that a reason

S0179	ah what be we talk about oh yeah america so yeah and this bbc news article about how the european drug company be now refuse to supply american prisons with drug need for the injection
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	it's like a three stage drug injection eh and erm the erm there be two things about that firstly some american like pro death penalty campaign say it's say basically say like yeah it's basically you know socialist i think socialist european meddle in things that do not concern them
S0058	no
S0179	i'm sorry you're an ardent capitalist these be independent company make business decisions about what they do and don't want to do
S0120	mm
S0179	which be in their interest i'm sorry can you hear yourself um surely it's socialist to suggest that the state should control independent company
S0058	mm
S0179	so that's point number one point number two be they the bbc publish a list of top executions by country and obviously china top it with you know thousands
S0058	no
S0120	after that it be texas
S0179	no then it be then i think indonesia erm iran and
S0058	syria be in there and north korea be in there
S0179	yeah
S0058	mm
S0179	but but america be fourth and most of these countries be either massively third world or sort of countries that america would quite like to bomb and you're look at it think yeah be this a be this like a top ten that you really want to be a part of just look at the other countries in there i think
S0058	not very progressive
S0179	yeah
S0120	erm in contrast uk have be in the top for teenage pregnancy
S0058	right
S0120	not so terrible
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0179	relatively speak not so terrible to be fair if you take some of them out of the equation drop a few place we can't be top for teenage pregnancy there's lot of
S0120	eh in europe
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	so in countries where condoms be illegal or like
S0058	oh yeah or if their society's different attitudes towards
S0120	and now we come back to the catholic
S0058	catholic church
S0120	church
S0179	church
S0058	yup all conversations return quickly to catholicism
S0179	but another comment today that i love be so right so the catholic church hasn't in the last ten years be so mobilise about an individual issue it's a pity what with paedophile priests aid third world poverty
S0058	yeah
S0179	et cetera that they of all the things to get excite about be gay marriage

S0058	i don't particularly like the corpus playroom actually
S0179	who actually think that be a good idea
S0058	it's novel but it's dull personally i just don't like it

S0058	i don't know how be it really old the corpus playroom
S0120	i don't know
S0179	the build must be over a hundred years presumably that particular room
S0120	well it date back at least to when stephen fry be
S0120	when he eh he have his erm
S0058	latin
S0120	he he break into uni theatre there really
S0179	pity
S0120	you can see he erm and he write a he write a letter which be on the erm corpus playroom website i think

S0120	preferably with one of my knives stick between your rib
S0058	oh what's it call
S0120	he be so so massively joke
S0058	it's it's call latin or something for boys
S0179	i don't care he's still a shithole
S0058	it's it it play latin latin with subtitle and something for boys
S0120	what
S0179	spank for boys basically for fun
S0058	no no no you know his play latin
S0120	i believe i've hear of it
S0058	okay
S0120	it be put on at some point by someone
S0179	by students
S0058	by students
S0120	during my time at uni
S0058	history boys be
S0120	mm
S0179	yes and bennett be an appal author
S0058	of alan bennett
S0179	well he nearly put me in a coma often enough
S0058	no that's not a good enough reason not to like it what have you listen to or read
S0179	him
S0058	do what
S0179	speak
S0058	which ones history boys be really good i like it and matt smith be in it
S0179	yes so you're impartial
S0058	he wasn't matt smith then he be just like a
S0120	so you're impartial what do you think of the volvo
S0058	he's be sell it to all of my relatives this weekend
S0179	you want something the size of a vw golf and you want a volvo then there you go i guess
S0120	you weren't impress on a technical level
S0179	what be there to be impress about the presumably
S0120	oh you know world's first pedestrian air bag
S0179	okay i i must have skip that bite
S0058	mm
S0120	the fact that it's now get the authentic brake facility that work up to forty one miles an hour which will detect and prevent collision to or other vehicles or pedestrians
S0058	pretty good
S0120	in all urban environments
S0058	so you really can't really remember if you're try to so you know those film where like
S0179	so basically your car be liable to take control from you
S0120	well i have certain issue with that yes but on balance i think it's probably a good thing
S0058	would be really funny in like a hollywood film when they try and run someone down and the car brake alright volvo
S0120	well there should be some horrible boss
S0058	that be quite funny actually yeah
S0179	mm
S0120	eh
S0058	in horrible boss if they'd have automatic brake systems they have this really
S0179	horrible boss
S0120	it's a film where three guy really hate their boss and they're try to kill them
S0058	they decide they're go to kill them really funny jennifer aniston's in it as one of their boss basically sexually harass one of them it's really funny
S0179	mm
S0058	i wouldn't mind see that again maybe not buy it but see it
S0179	love film
S0058	love film
S0120	but anyway the erm yes that
S0179	that that doesn't impress you any of it
S0120	mm
S0179	as in volvo have announce that by twenty twenty it's their goal that no one will be kill or injure severely injure in or by a volvo a new one at least
S0058	an admirable goal
S0179	yeah
S0120	mm
S0179	i think so and they're well on the way to achieve it
S0058	mm i say that's something to strive for rather than stupid top gear please engine noise
S0179	mm
S0120	mm i be at erm this be what remind me of sarah milligan actually i think one of her last comment on the episode i probably won't have time to a few things and sort of wrap up some include snog marry avoid
S0058	snog marry avoid
S0120	or as i like to call it top gear
S0058	amaze oh but which be which
S0120	eh
S0058	jam may be definitely marry
S0120	yeah
S0179	really
S0058	oh and tricky between the well i genuinely want to
S0179	i'd definitely avoid i definitely feel like i need to avoid jeremy clarkson erm
S0058	well i would avoid it too but i'm not massively in to richard hammonds
S0179	and and also i don't yeah
S0120	oh and he say something rather interest at the end of eth last episode which you weren't there for which be to jam oh i hope you're shoot in front of your family which accord to offcom we can now say that on television
S0058	who's that clarkson or hammond
S0120	yes clarkson
S0058	god he's such a dick
S0179	well no no
S0120	i think his tv personality be such a dick
S0179	i don't know i disagree i think that it's a perfectly legitimate comment under the circumstances if you take what he say in context and by context i mean the previous sentence he utter he be take the piss of the bbc not about the strikers but they yeah
S0058	i i'm just not sure i particularly want to snog either of them
S0179	mm
S0058	so either snog and marry
S0120	though we're agree that you know jam may be the marry marry one
S0058	yeah jam may be definitely the marry one yeah who would you marry uh huh

S0058	normally she she normally email me but yeah anyway
S0120	she's a funny one that lass
S0058	i'm try to get her to commit to a holiday date you commit soon which be good
S0120	what date
S0058	holiday date so generally what days you can do and can't do
S0179	we be think it might be nice to actually go away at some point in the moderately near future
S0120	like
S0058	we don't have any plan
S0179	well like a month or so cos it seem counterintuitive but there's actually no reason not to anyway so we have a few ideas shall we go through the ideas
S0058	yes be you look at me and well there's this cottage in wales
S0179	be you look at me punk
S0058	yes
S0179	there be this cottage in wales which have attractions as in it be essentially five star but be only five hundred pound per week at any time of the year because it's not commercially available it's only available to personal friends of the owners they use to have a complex where we stay and they retire to a convert barn that with one adjacent cottage which they use to own but be now all they own which they let out to special people which we be on the list for so
S0058	it's a very nice area
S0179	so that have the attraction it's very cheap it's
S0120	on on the list for which we be
S0058	we be on the special list
S0120	no i get that wrong no
S0058	on the
S0120	don't want to end the sentence on a proposition how would you do that eh
S0058	on the yeah on the list on which we be yeah that's alright
S0179	we be on this list
S0120	okay
S0058	yeah that work yes and well 's mother ring and she say she's be fine for and his friends to come over and yeah we know that anyway erm so
S0179	but the point be the location be
S0120	i'm so annoy that my godmother sell their farm house in burgundy
S0058	mm
S0120	that be gonna be you know i be plan on go there sometime
S0058	aw anyone else get any relatives who own things
S0120	not any more
S0179	to continue with this thread
S0058	mm
S0179	the so that's get attractions as we can probably get you know five or six in there at a pinch or at least if there be sort of
S0058	definitely room for four
S0179	well there's four bed but there's also space for other sleep bag and stuff i'm sure they wouldn't object
S0120	or we can share bed
S0179	there's three bed
S0058	there's three bed yeah room for four people but there's also plenty of room downstairs for people to bunk so if be four people it would be very comfortable five people could be fine erm so that would be nice and it's
S0120	where in wales
S0179	mid wales glamorganshire eh just south of halfway between glamorgon
S0120	near which mountains
S0179	eh hang on it would be erm the grampians be in scotland aren't they
S0120	yeah
S0179	so it start with g
S0058	gairngorms
S0179	no eh
S0058	i be joke
S0179	so it's the mountains that go up half way through as it be the backbone of wales erm
S0120	not
S0179	no separate range
S0120	okay i don't know what that be then
S0058	it's like half way up see there's wales it's here
S0120	i be expect like brecon or snowdonia
S0179	no well there's a range so there's two range of hill in wales so look at it from your perspective this be like end of wales eh this be the range brecon beacon sort of petering out as you get towards pembrokeshire and then there's a second range which go like that
S0120	mm mm
S0179	start about here go upwards
S0120	yeah
S0179	there's a gap
S0120	snowdonia be near the top
S0179	yeah they end in snowdonia but they go pretty much the entire length so it's the sort of knee end of those erm
S0058	but it's kind of on the coast so there's some nice view of cliffs and things
S0179	there's tonnes of nice beach lot of nice things to do
S0120	oh so near or in cardigan bay
S0179	no sorry no
S0179	yeah in cardigan bay so it's half way between eh cardigan and aberystwyth erm but the point be there's a lot of things to do virtually none of which cost anything
S0058	and there's no restaurants so you don't go out you just stay in and cook
S0120	yay
S0058	yay
S0179	but this be a trip well there's a pub about half an hours walk away
S0058	exactly so which could be fun
S0179	so yeah who's eh lead idea erm other ideas up north in scotland which i'm keen on
S0179	erm that eh question get a train to newcastle hire a car at newcastle and drive so it's a day ish pros
S0058	it's really different
S0179	it's very different if you've never be there before and i don't think you have and don't think anyone else would deny it
S0058	i recommend the highlands they're really cool
S0179	it's very exotic as in it's not like scotland as you know it so there's you go through the central highlands to get there once you get north of inverness it's a completely different ball game it's wild
S0058	insane hill and white beach and it's really cool
S0179	yeah like i say exotic be a good word eh again
S0120	sound good
S0179	nice cheap cottage because it's so far it's so remote it's not expensive so again it will probably be at most five hundred
S0058	do you want to sit on a chair you're allow it's fine
S0120	i want to lie down
S0058	have you have enough
S0179	we're go to have cheese and biscuits later
S0120	sound good
S0179	erm so at most
S0058	so it's yeah so that would be good
S0179	at most it would be five hundred quid
S0120	i have an out tomorrow morning
S0058	ooh why
S0058	you have work tomorrow morning
S0120	fuck this boat club so disorganise
S0058	f t b c we need to get hoodies make
S0179	anyway can i finish please
S0058	sorry yes be really cool
S0179	erm so again there's not a lot to do that involve money which be good so again it's just a lot of like
S0058	beach
S0179	booze inside erm but the problem be that you have to drive a long way to get anywhere so you do spend more on fuel than you would do elsewhere
S0058	yeah that's true whereas if you be in wales
S0179	ah but that say it be proportionally a lot cheaper and you don't spend anything out
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm then another option be eh
S0058	northumberland
S0179	no the other one
S0058	the other one
S0179	you've be there pink sofa
S0058	oh there yeah yeah so it's near carlisle
S0179	what's it's call
S0058	erm
S0179	which be near carlisle so it's kind of other side of the country but at my parents' kind of level
S0179	but what they've get be some very
S0120	i don't know where carlisle be
S0179	which be good because it's in a sort of strike distance of the lakes northumberland dumfries and galloway and the pennines
S0058	it's close it's close to all the highlight basically
S0179	yeah it's basically a literal epicentre to get to anywhere decent but what they have be they have a nice cottage well they've get a couple of cottage can actually sleep six people incredibly luxurious sort of fifty inch tvs et cetera but but but
S0120	i wouldn't sit in and watch tv up there i can watch tv at home where it's flat
S0179	key thing private hot tubs
S0120	what one each
S0058	that would be good yeah a really warm bucket as in each cottage have a private hot tub
S0179	well the big cottages do
S0058	which have attractions but they be on more expensive so
S0179	so probably in eth summer you'd be look at about a grand a week
S0058	which be
S0179	again not a huge amount
S0058	but it's a lot more than
S0120	it be when it's
S0058	because of the
S0120	more than five per cent of your annual salary before tax no after tax
S0179	yeah but you don't pay that each
S0120	oh
S0058	not a grand each
S0120	of course of course sorry yeah indeed
S0058	we're not suggest this
S0179	so it's not in fact six grand a week
S0120	right okay yeah
S0179	that would be push it
S0058	that would be push it you can probably pay that but probably for a country house
S0179	yeah so
S0058	so yeah that's a bite more expensive you do get kind of a more luxurious cottage but i guess it's more and you're closer to
S0179	things
S0058	all the things
S0179	so you'd spend a lot less fuel well compare to scotland you'd spend a lot less on fuel to get to scotland you need a return train fare to newcastle and probably one tank of fuel each and i'd intend to pay for the car because that would be my treat but beyond that as in i would enjoy drive so much eh but beyond that
S0058	mm
S0179	you would pay more on fuel so
S0058	but it's kind of tot it up anyway i guess
S0179	but none of these options be expensive
S0120	yeah it's all about tot it up
S0058	it be always
S0179	and again none of these options be particularly expensive because that's you know you're not go to spend anything in bar or restaurants you're just go to buy cheap booze and eh
S0058	and cheap food any thoughts on the topic
S0179	so those be my three lead ideas at the moment there be also a couple of options in northumberland erm again a place that's get there's no private hot tubs but there's a swim pool with a hot tub erm sort of in the complex
S0058	like
S0179	yep again very luxurious erm not hugely erm a little bite more expensive erm slightly better locale as in there's an awful lot to do more locally so it's right in so you can do walk from the cottage if you want to in a way it would be harder at erm what's it call
S0179	erm fifth option be there's these cottages in eh mobile home they're permanent caravan
S0058	they're not that cheap
S0179	well they're quite fun and but you have free use of a very nice pool and sauna and jacuzzi on site and gym
S0058	but it's not that cheap and they be basically caravan
S0120	i doubt
S0179	but you be on the coast
S0058	you be on the coast
S0120	i would go away to use a gym in
S0179	they're not caravan they're permanent but eh and i have stay there before and it be very nice
S0058	mm but you and be in one of the ones that sleep six
S0179	no it only sleep four
S0058	okay fine so you kind of need two place each
S0179	they're the same size
S0058	yeah exactly and that didn't sound massive i'd be slightly worry with four people in one of those you might end up a bite i just think with the money they want for one
S0120	it will be cosy
S0058	yeah basically
S0179	yeah i
S0058	be that good or bad i'm not sure if you're be sentimental
S0179	but it's right on the coast
S0058	as it come
S0120	yeah
S0058	and you'd be like no no cosy don't want cosy
S0120	yeah
S0179	so anyway what be your thoughts on those options
S0120	erm well they all sound pretty good
S0179	any preferences
S0120	erm so wales ullapool
S0058	carlisle
S0120	near carlisle
S0058	yeah
S0179	okay pretty much my sequence
S0120	oh no i i wasn't rank them i be just try to remember what they be
S0179	okay wales ullapool near carlisle middle of northumberland and northumberland coast
S0058	that whole thing shall i throw this away
S0120	not so keen on eh the latter
S0179	okay of the other four any order of preference
S0058	clean
S0179	so any order of preference in the other four
S0120	i'm think erm mm
S0058	make me stop just before i begin
S0120	i mean you tempt me slightly by the eh exotic exotity
S0058	exoticism
S0120	no i be go to say
S0058	exoticity
S0120	yes that's it
S0179	of ullapool well it have to be point out that we can do more than one of these
S0058	yes
S0179	they're not mutually exclusive
S0120	depend how much how much i can flaunt around my leave i don't think my leave can be stretch an extra two weeks base on the plan i currently have
S0179	well what plan do you have
S0120	erm first week of
S0058	can i take your plate sir
S0120	yes thank you erm those be nearly tip
S0179	mm
S0120	stretchies
S0179	first week of
S0120	erm oh no last week of august i'm go my parent and my brother to walk in the north of italy erm and go for some time possibly in the entire week at some point in may again forget the date eh erm to cornwall
S0179	that's two weeks
S0120	yeah
S0179	how much leave have you get
S0120	well i've get thirty days include compulsory holiday which include the eight statutory holiday plus two extra days around christmas which be compulsory so i've get twenty days to play with
S0058	mm
S0120	erm so
S0058	so that's ten use
S0120	yeah plus i'm gonna be use an extra two around christmas because those be the random little days that in between the start of the christmas holiday and at the end of new year holiday
S0058	right
S0120	that don't aren't already cover i've get to fill in those gap erm then there's these two other weeks so that leave me less than two weeks wait a minute hang on
S0179	that that's
S0120	should have have the foresight to have leave
S0179	can you just take unpaid leave
S0120	mm not really right erm do you want me to take the wash see as you do the cook and then i'll
S0058	i'll wash it and then you two can dry
S0179	if you can start do the wipe as it come out then we can extrapolate from there
