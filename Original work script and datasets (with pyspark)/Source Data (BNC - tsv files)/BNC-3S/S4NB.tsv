S0258	so how do how
S0255	people have their own ideas of how to do things don't they
S0257	of course
S0258	so how do that happen if you don't mind me ask
S0255	mm
S0258	so do he be he with so he have the

S0257	and things happen for a reason
S0258	everything happen for a reason yeah well and truly
S0255	you wouldn't be the person that you you be now if it wasn't for how you be in all the experience
S0257	all the battle that you've have all the positives and

S0257	oh yes
S0255	mm
S0258	erm who's 's business partner

S0255	yeah
S0258	but her english be good
S0255	mm
S0258	like i know we know her before cos she's at work as well but i always think she have quite good english compare to other people but she do struggle to follow our conversation
S0255	mm
S0258	because i think we all talk so fast and we use
S0257	mm
S0258	so many reference to just
S0255	yeah
S0258	things that be a bite out of her scope but you don't realise that
S0257	yeah
S0258	until you have that person within your midst
S0255	yes
S0258	who hasn't
S0255	mm
S0258	just have the same upbringing as you how remote it can be
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	or if you're learn another language
S0258	mm
S0257	so i don't know if either of you do any school exchange er in if you be do languages at school
S0258	no i didn't do it then
S0255	no
S0258	no
S0257	i go to germany twice so you you have a pen friend
S0258	mm
S0257	they come and stay with you and your family
S0258	yeah
S0257	and you go and stay with them in
S0255	mm
S0257	in their family and it make you realise that actually what you're teach in school you're er you're you're teach very formal textbook languages
S0258	mm
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	but when you get with a family with a group of children young adults your age it er see even the way book be write now
S0258	mm
S0257	compare to how book be write
S0255	mm
S0257	thirty forty fifty years ago
S0258	mm
S0255	yeah
S0257	they be a lot more formal a lot more
S0258	yeah
S0257	you know structure whereas now it's all sort of chat and conversations
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	and and dialects as well
S0258	yeah
S0257	and i've i almost it be like learn german all over again when i be on these exchange
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	and you would come back and you'd start use some of the conversation in class and the teacher would say no that's not right
S0255	mm
S0257	and the german teachers i have all through secondary school be either german or they have german parent
S0255	yeah
S0257	so they be bring up with the language but still the way they be teach it be very very formal
S0258	mm
S0255	mm
S0257	and they wouldn't accept when you say to them well when i stay with a family
S0255	well that's what they say mm
S0257	this be how they talk
S0258	yeah
S0257	yeah and they didn't say this very formal structure sentence they'd just abbreviate it
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	and it it's almost like well you're you're not allow to say it like that because that won't help you pass your exam
S0258	yeah
S0257	you have to know the
S0255	yeah
S0257	yeah but you know for to put it into practice to actually make use of it
S0255	yeah
S0258	mm
S0255	to be able to use it as a language later on
S0257	yeah
S0255	you need to be able to talk the way they talk
S0257	exactly
S0255	rather than
S0258	exactly
S0255	er it's like english now it's like grammatically incorrect a lot of the time isn't it
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	erm
S0257	mm well you only need to listen to a group of fourteen year olds
S0255	mm
S0257	and they're talk a
S0258	oh it annoy me sometimes when i hear people speak
S0257	a completely different language aren't they
S0255	mm
S0258	oh just when i hear like tense like use really incorrectly and stuff it just
S0255	mm
S0257	do you know what my my pet hate be word wise anything that i've be involve in that's er that's remotely sort of hrish
S0255	mm
S0258	mm
S0257	the number of people that say and somebody do it this week actually the number of people that say i don't feel like i've be properly
S0255	oh
S0257	instead of treat properly
S0255	mm
S0258	oh yeah
S0257	er you know i'm tret differently to them
S0258	that's quite a local kind of
S0255	yeah
S0258	accent isn't it
S0257	i think that
S0255	it be yeah yeah definitely
S0258	be it isn't it

S0257	when i work for one company in myself and the hr erm assistant there we would sit in on disciplinary hear
S0255	mm
S0257	and beforehand we'd say this be really disrespectful i suppose but we'd say we'd have a five p bet on certain word that they'd put in
S0257	or excuse that they would make erm we could almost always guess which people would say
S0255	mm
S0257	and it didn't even have a t on the end
S0258	mm
S0255	yeah
S0257	i'm not tre the same as everyone else

S0258	erm well they use to have another company do they've have a few businesses between them but at the time they be do online market and then this other guy who turn out to be a director later down the line he come up to him and give him this idea cos he be he'd use an e cig
S0255	mm
S0258	to give up smoke
S0257	oh
S0258	so then erm use the company money
S0255	mm
S0258	erm for and and i think it buy five hundred pound worth of stock and put a really basic website and it sell in twenty four hours like
S0257	wow
S0258	the all the stock have go
S0255	wow
S0258	and i think then he put a thousand pound of stock and again it go in twenty four hours
S0255	mm
S0258	and then they be like oh my god and then
S0255	this be yeah
S0258	they start to
S0257	yeah
S0258	obviously go down that line that be about three years ago now
S0255	mm mm
S0258	yeah they're do really well bless em
S0255	yeah they have do really well
S0258	yeah
S0257	mm they work hard though don't they
S0258	yeah there's about fifty employees now so yeah it's like really big growth yeah
S0255	mm
S0258	bless him
S0257	mm
S0255	yeah and
S0257	it's amaze what you can do when you it's just get the right product at the right time isn't it
S0258	it be and it's all because of and then it be always like a bite of karma cos obviously give him the idea
S0255	mm
S0258	but then in a few months later they'd buy his business so he's one of our directors now so it all work out karma wise so
S0257	yeah yeah
S0255	yeah
S0258	even though i'm sure that his family still be a bite like oh cos he's only get ten percent and stuff but you know
S0255	but he didn't do it
S0257	oh have he
S0255	he he could quite easily have buy some stock do a basic website and start from there couldn't he so
S0258	exactly exactly
S0257	mm
S0255	so
S0258	exactly yeah
S0255	and it's the people that have get the get up and go to do it
S0258	exactly yeah
S0255	so what other businesses do they have before
S0258	erm well and they start i think about two thousand and two erm when they be both very young they both erm use to do websites while he be at college and i think want a website off him and then they start do online game
S0255	mm
S0258	so that be year ago now
S0255	mm
S0258	erm they do that and then online market which use to do and have a proper job and then the e cigs and when that all take off
S0255	mm
S0258	quit his job after a little while
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah yeah i know it's a bite weird there's always that uncertainty though you like have your own business i think you're always gonna have
S0255	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0258	that little bite of uncertainty
S0255	and if the e cigs go out of fashion as well
S0258	yeah
S0255	it's to but i think they've obviously get the right business idea and they work well together
S0258	oh yeah yeah they've all get their strengths
S0255	so if it be to start go and they realise
S0258	yeah
S0255	they'd look and go okay and they've get a big enough company
S0258	mm
S0255	to be able to sort of go into something else
S0258	oh yeah yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	on the back of that now
S0258	oh definitely definitely like i tell you they'd they be gonna do sex toy but they're not do that now but they always have ideas
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah so
S0255	yeah
S0258	let's see
S0255	mm
S0258	finger cross and everything i think i'm like when there's really you know when there's people who always think worse worse case
S0255	mm
S0258	but i'm quite yeah it'll be alright
S0257	but as long as you've get some kind of a backup plan
S0258	yeah
S0257	it's look out for
S0258	yeah
S0257	another product or another service
S0258	yeah exactly
S0257	if if this one do start to decline and let's face it it's it's something that's look on really favourably by a lot of people isn't it
S0258	yeah oh yeah i think it have help a lot of people
S0257	and i know i know load of people
S0258	yeah
S0257	that have use use them and
S0258	yeah
S0257	use them really really well
S0258	yeah
S0257	and it's not gonna stop overnight
S0255	no
S0258	no no
S0255	no
S0258	yeah there's always uncertainty with the regulation all the tobacco company have load of clout and stuff so
S0257	of course they do
S0255	mm
S0258	so and they obviously hate e cigs so obviously
S0255	yeah
S0258	the dream be to get buy out by a big company
S0257	mm
S0255	yeah exactly
S0258	that be our dream
S0257	and then retire
S0258	yeah our
S0257	retire at thirty
S0258	our our accountants actually do say like oh when you get buy out and i be like they say when not if
S0255	mm
S0258	they say when and i'm like
S0255	yeah
S0258	it it'll never happen but that's the dream
S0255	no mm could do
S0257	well you don't know though do you you don't know what's around the corner
S0258	yeah
S0255	cos there'll be people look round for company and your company now be big enough that it'll be pop up on some people's radars
S0258	mm and they be only we do this in the uk now yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah like i hope like a big tobacco company offer billions
S0255	yeah
S0258	or millions or thousands
S0258	in fact anything
S0255	a tenner
S0258	anything at all yeah a tenner
S0257	what do you think what do you think would do if he wasn't do this
S0258	well
S0257	if if money wasn't an object
S0258	his background be it so he be always network security
S0255	mm
S0258	so he use to work for like the police and the mod and stuff like do like secure the network basically but i don't think he'd go back to that i think he would
S0255	mm
S0258	have enough i think once you've have your own business i think it's very
S0257	mm
S0258	i don't think he could
S0257	to work for somebody else
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah i think he i'd probably go back to work and i think he'd probably do the house husband thing
S0255	mm
S0258	i don't think he'd last very long
S0258	i honestly don't cos i'm sure to him he think it's very easy but
S0255	no
S0257	of course it be
S0258	so they think so yeah look after all day
S0255	mm
S0258	but yeah i dunno we'll see hopefully
S0255	mm
S0258	finger cross you know i'm sure it will be and he's get they've get load of contingency plan
S0257	mm
S0255	yeah
S0258	and stuff so
S0257	it's important though isn't it
S0258	yeah
S0257	and what do you do if if the
S0258	yeah
S0257	if the money wasn't an object if you be if you be if you could pick a a a type of business to run or a job to do because it's what you would want to do what would it be
