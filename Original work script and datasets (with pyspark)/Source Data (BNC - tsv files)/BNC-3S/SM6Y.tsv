S0455	with it still on finance mm
S0454	probably shouldn't mention grandpa's car to him then
S0455	no i won't cos i'll be careful on that one
S0452	mm
S0454	yes that will cause a problem that's why i want to pay for it though cos of things like that
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0452	that's true
S0454	that will cause upset
S0452	mm
S0455	yes but i've i've tell you to er he wouldn't be too worry about it cos er so many people have have
S0454	i know but still
S0455	yes
S0452	mm
S0454	there's no point cause
S0455	no
S0452	no no
S0454	problems if there's no need especially if it's there there's no reason for him to know it's not like it's here on the drive and it here
S0452	no no that's erm yeah
S0454	mm lovely meat
S0455	oh good
S0454	i send you the the link to this project as well
S0452	thank you
S0455	oh thank you mm well it certainly sound easy to do
S0454	yeah it's just the first time it be a bite of a hassle sort out the paperwork
S0454	but then
S0454	once you've get that sort
S0455	yes
S0454	it's very simple
S0455	yes
S0454	i like the fat on the lamb
S0455	mm it's nice isn't it
S0454	mm
S0455	when it's cook mm well you see you can either like be like dad and a lot of people be like that don't want any fat on meat
S0454	mm
S0455	or otherwise you like a certain amount of fat
S0454	mm
S0455	to to give it the flavour because we try the sausages erm where there's less fat
S0454	less fat mm
S0455	and i don't think they're the same
S0454	no
S0455	not not a sausage
S0454	that's good you're cook even if you're not go to eat the fat it's good to leave the fat on isn't it cos it keep it moist
S0455	yeah yes that's true
S0454	it dry out
S0455	yes and get meat the way you know you personally like it be very difficult isn't it
S0454	mm
S0455	because when we're on the cruise if you order lamb there it come like a lamb chop really really rare
S0454	can't you tell them
S0455	yeah i try try so i say medium and it still er sort of come back the second time and it be still red
S0454	mm
S0455	and i just can't i could eat steak like that but i can't eat lamb
S0454	but just say well do
S0455	so well i think the he tell us what to say if you say you don't want any red it's gotta be the easiest thing
S0454	mm
S0455	to say so it's better but to me though that i just couldn't touch it because it look it look raw apart from the outside be
S0454	ah right that's no good
S0455	but obviously that's how they do it in higher circle
S0454	mm yeah
S0452	and beef i think as well don't they
S0454	yes beef
S0455	well yes
S0454	often look like that
S0452	right mm
S0455	yeah i don't mind i like beef red
S0454	mm
S0455	as long as it's not absolutely raw
S0454	mm
S0455	but erm certainly don't like the lamb
S0454	it's funny isn't it erm with white meat you can't do that get ill
S0452	mm
S0455	yes and the thing be if you ask the it's very difficult with steak cos you can say medium rare and i always use to and a couple of time it seem to be raw
S0454	mm it vary quite a lot
S0455	yeah so then i've now start say medium and then it's a bite
S0454	mm
S0455	hit and miss usually it's not but i'd like it a little bite less mm and the best meat be near the bone isn't it really
S0454	mm yes it be
S0455	it's interest with chicken thighs you see wouldn't touch those at all chicken thighs before and they're i think they're a little bite fatty
S0452	mm yeah i i'm not so keen
S0455	but you don't mind them
S0452	no i'm not so keen oh well yes
S0455	oh er you're not
S0452	well this be erm thighs but no bone
S0454	i think thighs be some of the best bits to cook with cos there's a lot of meat on them
S0452	mm
S0455	well i don't mind them
S0454	but they don't dry out as much as the breast
S0452	no
S0455	no
S0454	breast's quite difficult to cook because it dry out easily
S0455	yeah
S0454	cos it's get no fat on it and because you've get the bone
S0455	yes
S0454	actually the thighs cook quite nicely
S0455	have you have my recipe for the breast stuff with brie and mushroom and lemon
S0454	oh yes that's nice
S0455	yeah that's a good one and then wrap in bacon
S0454	mm
S0455	and that's a lovely sort of fill meal and it do keep moist
S0454	yes
S0455	well i do quite a nice recipe one day with those thighs i just make it up and put them in with erm sort of very well chunk of potato and onions and tomatoes
S0454	oh right
S0455	it be good
S0454	mm
S0455	seriously er seriously think of have your housewarming party then
S0454	mm
S0454	yeah it's a nice way to see people at new year
S0455	well people'll be very please to come
S0454	if they don't come that's fine isn't it
S0455	i think you'll find they will
S0454	mm
S0455	and actually you're in a good position aren't you for invite
S0454	yeah
S0455	cos you know it's not as far down for him
S0454	no that's true
S0455	if they're around 's children would come if you invite them
S0454	mm
S0455	and it'll be novel won't it with bring your own cutlery crockery
S0454	yes
S0455	share
S0454	er i'll have some paper plat
S0455	mm oh right
S0454	it's cheap but yes the chair
S0455	mm well we can bring we've get a few sort of picnic type chair we can bring
S0454	mm mm
S0452	i think there's two in the garage
S0455	yes
S0452	those two
S0454	be that with chickpeas dad
S0452	erm that sort of thing yeah
S0454	oh
S0455	yes
S0454	mm
S0455	mm
S0454	but i prefer this one
S0452	mm
S0455	this lamb's a terrible price in the supermarket
S0454	really how funny
S0455	absolutely ridiculous
S0454	in the middle east it's cheap
S0455	oh yes and i can't understand it
S0454	chickens be the cheapest
S0455	cos we've get plenty of sheep you'd think
S0452	mm
S0454	mm
S0455	so why be it
S0455	why be it so dear
S0454	yes
S0455	oh there's a question for you what do you think of the supermarkets of the farmers rather make a loss on their milk
S0454	that's madness isn't it
S0455	it be they show you in the paper didn't they
S0454	absolute madness mm
S0455	the price they be getting's terrible
S0454	yeah
S0454	and they've get it again haven't they recently just a few days ago
S0455	mm
S0452	yes some supermarkets pay them less than
S0455	and they've get to sort it out cos the farmers be take their cow into the supermarket
S0454	i saw that
S0455	weren't they
S0452	mm
S0455	and then throw milk off the shelve onto the floor and
S0454	yes but morrisons have just bring out a new brand of milk
S0455	ah
S0454	where they guarantee a certain price to the farm
S0455	oh right that's good
S0454	and they print it on the bottle
S0455	oh yes
S0454	mm
S0455	but it's er it seem very wrong doesn't it
S0454	it's all very well have free market but i mean there won't be any
S0452	i know
S0454	market leave here
S0455	mm so how they can manage make a loss the farmers i don't know
S0454	no well they're not go to be they
S0455	no
S0454	not profitable
S0455	and all that hard work
S0454	mm
S0452	water
S0454	big overheads as well
S0452	yeah
S0454	you know if the tractor break down
S0455	oh yes
S0452	yeah
S0454	not exactly optional
S0455	mm
S0452	no could i just squeeze
S0455	yes
S0452	thank you
S0454	perhaps get out just in time then
S0455	mm yes yes perhaps so and his son in law just find er the work involve it's just far too much
S0454	mm
S0455	i think erm if we do this with dad and i it'd just be quiet
S0454	you can try it with all your guests
S0454	grandpa
S0455	no that's fine cos grandpa don't know if you've notice can't have any silence
S0454	yes that's true no wonder he get tire
S0455	well yes
S0454	so what state do you think the house will be in
S0455	erm that's an interest one perhaps the roof on it yet
S0454	mm
S0455	because they've get another month haven't they and that's quite a while
S0454	i think the roof will be do
S0455	you do
S0454	cos they won't be able to get it finish otherwise
S0455	right
S0454	cos they can't work on the inside until the roof's on
S0455	mm so perhaps it take a long time on the inside longer than you think
S0454	i think it take a while
S0454	it's all the wire isn't it that must take a while and it would have to be completely dry inside all the windows would have to be in before you start on that thing wouldn't you
S0455	yes yes perhaps it's yes you'd think the longest thing be put the the roof on but perhaps it isn't
S0454	mm
S0455	well we don't know how long they've be do it do we
S0454	no
S0454	plumb that must take a while you think
S0455	yes
S0454	i don't know and then they've get to fit the kitchen
S0455	mm
S0454	i suppose you can do that in a day though can't you probably
S0455	er yes oh definitely wouldn't take very long
S0454	no cos they're all just prefabs i suppose aren't they like ikea furniture
S0455	yes
S0454	screw it together
S0455	mm when people know what they're do it's no time at all
S0454	yes they haven't get that long though cos if they get to lay the carpet i mean all these job take about two days don't they so if you've get to lay the carpet probably two days
S0455	clear the carpet oh no honestly
S0454	no but all of them
S0455	yeah they're so quick
S0454	oh really
S0455	but you see people who know their trade it's
S0454	mm
S0455	boom boom boom finish so it won't it'll probably take
S0454	oh okay
S0455	a morning
S0454	ah right okay oh that's good

S0454	mm so he's go to be there over christmas
S0455	yes
S0454	mm be nice with her family
S0455	erm i don't think all the time
S0454	ah
S0455	just to go for a few days and then go off
S0454	sensible
S0455	yes and he give er quite interest observations when he go
S0454	oh really
S0455	say how do he get on and he be fine with but she be nervous at her meet him apparently
S0454	mm
S0455	and then there be all the brothers and sisters so it seem fine they go off sort of together with a few of them 's close to them all
S0454	that's nice
S0454	mm
S0455	but she say he notice how different be with the family because she revert back to be a child
S0455	with the parent
S0455	it be it be a little bite difficult to get use to it but that just happen doesn't it
S0454	yes
S0455	perhaps a few days be enough in that situation
S0454	mm mm nice strudel
S0452	mm
S0455	oh good yes if you like you can have the erm the yoghurt maker
S0454	oh yes
S0455	if you think you'll use it

S0454	okay well i'll have it on long loan then if that's okay
S0455	oh yeah that's fine erm the thing be if you want to be most economical then you keep a little bite
S0454	yes
S0455	of yoghurt you've make for the next lot but the thing be if there's only one person eat them or two
S0454	okay i'll have it every day
S0455	yes so you'd have to buy it as a probably a pot of natural yoghurt every time you want to start it up again but that's not really a problem be it
S0454	no i suppose you could have one for breakfast every day couldn't you
S0452	put some on your porridge it's very nice
S0454	mm
S0455	yes i don't know if it would last six days either what you've make so you'd need two a day
S0454	i'll have to have two a day
S0455	i think you might have to
S0454	which be okay actually if you're go to have it instead of pudding
S0455	yes and then you could have a gap couldn't you and then make the next lot if you didn't want to keep it up
S0452	mm
S0454	yeah yes
S0455	well you could try it anyway
S0454	or anyone who visit

S0454	yeah
S0455	and that that's about it sort of thing we don't have to discuss it at length i prefer that
S0454	yeah
S0455	to do
S0454	difficult
S0455	so it's helpful to which be good but perhaps for a lot of us it's all unnatural
S0454	mm
S0455	not to actually talk about something that's so major
S0454	yes well someone must've say something to that effect
S0455	mm
S0454	cos of that post

S0454	do you think i don't think would do that
S0455	i don't think very feed up about not this be a separate issue but the not give him definite date for christmas but he's you know he be cross i could see but he say i don't i don't want to upset her sort of thing
S0454	no so i don't think he would do that
S0455	no
S0454	because of that

S0454	maybe i don't think send enough email to write that down do he
S0455	well i don't think answer them email but i think recently she have answer some
S0454	ah right
S0455	but will do that i don't know

S0455	no
S0454	and when he do write it's just a few line usually
S0455	i don't know
S0454	i don't think he write
S0455	load
S0454	really long email anyway
S0455	no wonder if it be a family member or not
S0454	it could be someone in australia couldn't it
S0455	yes it could so well say it be
S0454	i think it's i think it's more likely to be someone there
S0455	yes 's outspoken
S0454	
S0455	mm my sister
S0454	oh but she wouldn't say that
S0455	i don't think she would
S0454	no she wouldn't
S0455	but do you
S0454	no
S0455	i didn't tell you this story might be well bite upset really but erm so be have all these things over the phone to to to me and dad but so it's very upset and could see how distress i be
S0454	yes
S0455	and then and really wasn't it be make it very difficult although obviously have to say erm so she send an email and wonder whether to or not cos he be here and could see what be happen
S0454	mm
S0455	and say he think erm she think that she should stop have these sort of conversations because it wasn't help the family that's what she say but she must've mean dad and i i think
S0454	yeah
S0455	erm but anyway take it into the not the psychiatrist some sort of counsellor and she get really really cross with that email she be interest tell me
S0454	but i wonder if that's true
S0455	but she say don't
S0454	cos i mean a professional psychiatrist wouldn't get upset would they
S0455	well she be annoy with say cos be upset say she be send this email
S0454	yes but i don't think a psychiatrist if they're any good
S0455	counsellor i dunno
S0454	counsellor
S0455	mm
S0454	would be that you know forthright so i wonder if that's
S0455	well they try and people often agree with the person don't they who
S0454	yes
S0455	depress you sort of agree because you don't want to upset them or she doesn't want to go to counsel
S0454	yeah
S0455	cos the lady say oh there's a lesson to this sort of thing
S0454	mm
S0455	and so anyway she make me promise not to tell so i haven't
S0454	oh dear
S0454	mm yes
S0455	be try to help but that's what i mean so you've get to know when to say and when not to say difficult isn't it
S0454	yes it be difficult
S0455	yes that's all you can say it's difficult she's try to help
S0454	yes
S0455	mm
S0454	there's two side to every story
S0455	exactly
S0454	mm
S0455	yes
S0454	anyway it's okay now i think isn't it
S0455	yes it's fine yes
S0454	mm yeah
S0455	it's very difficult because it can erm make the person erm in a bad way like i i read something in the paper once actually there be a mother three children middle class regular sort of what would appear to be a good upbringing but the children would ring up and just go on and on and on every week criticise different things and
S0454	yeah
S0455	moan and all the rest of it and be nearly have a nervous breakdown in the end
S0454	oh right that's a shame
S0455	yeah well there's gotta be a limit you you could say but then you've get to stop i think
S0454	yes
S0455	do you think
S0454	yes and it's not always helpful to go back over the past i think
S0455	well no
S0454	when i do this counsel course
S0455	yes
S0454	i'm quite interest in that
S0455	mm
S0454	there's different approach to counsel
S0455	mm
S0454	and i think i would rather work with what you have now
S0455	mm
S0454	and move forward
S0455	yes
S0454	rather than always go back and look for the why
S0455	mm
S0454	perhaps it doesn't really matter the why a lot of the time just how can you improve the situation go forward
S0455	yes i think it's change isn't it some of it
S0454	mm
S0455	cos it have be blame and it's all from childhood whatever you be now
S0454	yes
S0455	but i think it be change a little bite
S0454	i think it's change
S0455	yeah
S0454	there's a lot about erm be grateful at the moment erm
S0455	be grateful
S0454	sort of a bite old fashion
S0455	oh that's er oh that's good yeah yeah
S0454	almost like count your bless except it doesn't have a religious
S0455	yeah yeah
S0454	slant but that's very in at the moment
S0455	yeah oh right
S0454	but that's right isn't it i mean if you've get your
S0455	yeah
S0454	physical health
S0455	yes
S0454	i mean anyone who hasn't will tell you you know health be wealth
S0455	mm yes
S0454	so you know you should be grateful for that
S0455	mm
S0454	you've get a roof over your head and
S0455	yes
S0454	the thing be here we don't really know what it's like to not have you know to have real poverty do we
S0455	no no we don't
S0454	no one do here
S0455	no
S0454	i mean even the worst case
S0455	mm
S0454	you don't hear of people starve to death or
S0455	no
S0454	not get treat for something treatable there be poverty but it's not
S0455	mm
S0454	the same level that you see in other countries
S0455	perhaps they've go too much on dig out the past and perhaps you need to because the person it come to the person's mind so you've get to deal with it can't just shut it down
S0454	yes you can't ignore it
S0455	but you've gotta work through it and do some appreciation of the other things at the same time or soon afterwards
S0454	yes
S0455	but not go on and on and on
S0454	and get there there's a new thing about mindfulness
S0455	yes
S0454	get you to focus on the now
S0455	yes
S0454	so that you can get on with your life
S0455	yes
S0454	cos if you're constantly look back
S0455	yes
S0454	you can't do anything can you
S0455	no no that's right
S0454	mm
S0455	yes it's definitely no good just shut off the feel
S0454	no that's not natural
S0455	yeah
S0454	especially and especially if something like grief
S0455	yeah
S0454	like when someone's die
S0455	yeah
S0454	i think you actually do need time to grieve don't you
S0455	well they say if you don't it'll hit you later
S0454	yes i think that's probably worse
S0455	yeah if you don't deal with it
S0454	yes if someone's die or
S0455	mm
S0454	you've get to i mean it's normal to be sad
S0455	yeah
S0454	then you wonder about doctor prescribe anti depressants
S0455	mm
S0454	when actually it's it's quite natural if say your husband's die that
S0455	yes
S0454	after thirty years together you're go to be depress not for a month
S0455	mm
S0454	but you're go to be depress for a couple of years but that's normal
S0455	yes if you're not so depress that you can't carry on with your life sort of thing cry
S0454	yeah i mean obviously if you're suicidal then
S0455	yeah
S0454	you know they have to step in but i think that be quite normal
S0455	yes
S0454	to not want to do anything for
S0455	no
S0454	erm a while
S0455	you see the old victorian where they use to dress in black
S0454	yes they still do in the middle east
S0455	and shut themselves off oh yeah and you you know you wonder if that it could be more helpful you don't know
S0454	yes in the middle east
S0455	yeah
S0454	muslim women automatically by law get er well it's well over a month
S0455	oh right
S0454	off if their partner die their husband
S0455	yes well it's sort of sensible yeah
S0454	die and they're suppose to shut themselves away
S0455	yes
S0454	just be in the house they can have visitors
S0455	mm
S0454	as many visitors as they want but they're not suppose to go out
S0455	ah right
S0454	for like forty days or something
S0455	yes
S0454	and then after that time it's okay they can go on as normal they can get marry again if they want
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	but they're suppose to have that time to
S0455	yes
S0454	to grieve and the other reason someone tell me be it's practical but that you wouldn't know if the woman be pregnant
S0455	mm
S0454	so it be a way of make sure that she wasn't pregnant before she remarry
S0455	ah ah right okay yeah
S0454	so they'd know whose child it be
S0455	mm
S0454	quite interest
S0455	there's a lady over the road who's seventy i be walk round one day and she start to chat and she'd be have some sort of counsel and there be things that have come back to her at that age about her childhood which have
S0454	cor
S0455	upset her a lot
S0454	yeah
S0455	which be interest you know that the father be very very strict and
S0454	mm yeah
S0455	yeah so it's interest so
S0454	which lady across the road
S0455	erm the one that live in the house where the front garden's be take by the next house
S0454	oh
S0455	the farmers
S0454	's brother's
S0455	yeah 's brother's wife yeah
S0454	mm
S0455	so er it's difficult isn't it
S0454	yes
S0455	yeah
S0454	that's right it might be worse
S0455	mm
S0454	go through all that again
S0455	but we also probably all need help and they say we all need a counsellor to help us that we learn to deal with things better
S0454	yeah
S0455	dwell on it or shut it off cos
S0454	mm
S0455	one extreme or the other couldn't it
S0454	that's true
S0454	shall we retire
S0455	yeah
