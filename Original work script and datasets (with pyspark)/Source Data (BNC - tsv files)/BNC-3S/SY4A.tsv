S0012	there isn't
S0152	if i move if i can move areas there be likely to have something go
S0012	what about rent you rent your house out then
S0152	won't cover my mortgage
S0012	wasn't it
S0152	no
S0012	well your mortgage be only six hundred pound a month innit no think it be about two fifty a week innit
S0152	eleven hundred
S0012	eleven hundred a month that's a lot eleven hundred a month you want a thousand pound a week to live on what with all the rest of the expense
S0152	well a thousand pound a month to live on on top of that
S0012	yeah eleven hundred pound a month mortgage be you try you say you be go to go to phone the society
S0152	i be so nervous about phone up
S0013	be you what for what they'll say
S0152	i get the paperwork i get everything there ready to go and i get so nervous about phone up
S0012	what because they might say no well at least you'd know
S0152	and if they say no what do i do
S0012	how long do your mortgage go for how long be it on for two year
S0152	well in three years time i have to pay seventy thousand pound
S0012	seventy thousand
S0013	what's that for
S0152	seventy thousand pound
S0012	why
S0152	because that's the endowment side of the mortgage
S0012	oh you cancel the endowment didn't you
S0152	cos they weren't worth seventy thousand they be only worth twenty thousand
S0012	that's right yeah cos the write to you and say don't they yeah
S0152	but i have i will have that money available
S0012	because of your pension
S0152	cos of my pension
S0012	but you get to survive for three years on what you get in that
S0013	but why do you have to pay that i don't understand why you
S0152	because it's interest only and that be twenty five years you have to pay it
S0013	yeah
S0012	can't you get a lease of life for another ten years
S0152	dunno dunno what they can do but if they extend it i've still get to pay it haven't i
S0012	well course you have yeah
S0152	still get to pay it but then that drop then that will drop my mortgage down
S0012	yeah
S0152	but it it's get to that point
S0012	oh dear mm very difficult in between the devil and the deep blue sea
S0013	have you get a complete budget of expense for the month and stuff like that
S0012	oh he's work his money out ain't you
S0013	yeah there's nothing you can cut down on to just tick over
S0012	well you can have bean on toast for a
S0152	i if i have i have three months
S0012	what leave moneywise
S0013	and then and then your expense re higher than what you're bring in mm
S0012	well surely if you have a chat with the build society and say what it's go to be like in another three years time they could they can at least put another five years on it can't they
S0152	yeah but it doesn't change how much i pay each month
S0012	no i know
S0013	no
S0152	all it do be give them more money
S0012	yeah
S0152	that i'm not pay anything off if i could cut if i could cut if i could go interest only until i sell the house i reckon it would drop my mortgage to round about seven hundred six fifty seven hundred
S0012	yeah well you can do that
S0013	and why don't you want to ask them about that
S0152	in case they say no
S0013	but if they say no it's what you're think now so
S0152	so it's that nervy it's that
S0012	yeah but you're still in the same position as you be now if they do say no
S0152	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	yeah
S0012	but if they say yes that'll lift a great big lump off your shoulder
S0013	yeah
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	but you're frighten to do it
S0152	yeah i mean you know i ask i suppose cos they never get back to me i ask back in january time
S0013	right
S0012	and they never get back to you well they should at least have the decency to get back to you even if that's a negative answer
S0013	yeah
S0152	yeah so i mean i've get to do it i know i've get to do it
S0012	get on the phone now then
S0152	i don't have all my number with me and everything so
S0012	oh no no
S0152	but i haven't but i haven't
S0013	eat the frog
S0012	eat the frog yeah

S0012	i'll tell you what you could do you could go and live with for a few weeks and
S0013	what with and
S0012	oh yeah you get and
S0152	i know i mean part of me now part of me think i should be able to do it okay part of me think i should be able to do it
S0012	yeah
S0152	but it's all dependent on whether the bank be prepare to actually help me
S0012	yeah well i mean most they mostly do don't they they do try and get you out of most things
S0013	yeah well you you have get the house on the market you're try to sell so once i mean they know that but it it kind of
S0012	bite the bullet and get get
S0013	at least it at least it
S0152	they know what my salary be each month
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know little little like you say cut back on things i have cut back on things i don't
S0013	yeah i no i just just wonder if there's anything else
S0152	you know i have do one of the things that i could one of the things that i've get to cut back on will be sky
S0012	that's what i be think cos that cost you a fortune a month
S0152	you know i
S0012	how much be that a month
S0152	eighty pound
S0012	eighty quid a month well that's eighty quid in your pocket then
S0152	no that's the thing it well yes it be in in theory but no it yes it be in theory but i could probably get in touch with sky and say look i'm think about change my package what can you do for me et cetera et cetera
S0012	yeah
S0152	and just drop that down
S0012	i mean how much do you watch
S0152	it's not me that watch it it's the girls
S0013	yeah
S0012	well they get to understand haven't they
S0152	you know
S0013	they're not they're not there too long be they i bet the watch bbc and itv more often
S0152	yeah they don't the thing be they don't have it at their mum's so you know
S0012	well that's not the point be it you've get to look after your
S0152	yeah
S0013	would that that would save about get on for a thousand pound wouldn't it
S0012	they would understand
S0152	no
S0013	yeah eighty pound a month
S0152	eighty well a year i could drop it i could drop it down i could drop it down
S0012	but keep sky
S0152	i can i can i can still keep
S0013	i mean we get freesat and freeview you can get most of the program after a time on them anyway
S0152	yeah i mean i can i can i think i you know i haven't look i haven't look into it so i
S0013	you've get a contract at the moment haven't you anyway so mm
S0152	yeah
S0012	well i should look into that and save up your pennies
S0152	yeah sky sky be pretty good if you turn round to sky usually from what my nephew be say and say we're think about go away from you they say of we'd like you to stay so we'll halve it for you
S0012	yeah well that'd be half wasn't it
S0152	you know
S0013	mm
S0012	well just try
S0152	you know erm
S0012	you can only but try
S0152	if they could if i could drop my if i could drop my gas down a little bite
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos last year they have me an eight hundred pound rebate
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	cos that's how much extra i pay throughout the year
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	right
S0152	which be what will happen it won't be so much this year
S0012	no
S0152	because they've change although they've only change it by thirty pound a month
S0013	yeah
S0152	so they've drop it by thirty pound a month so if you time that by twelve
S0012	that's three hundred and sixty quid
S0152	alright but they give me a rebate of eight hundred so they could drop that down a bite more
S0012	yeah
S0152	they could drop that down so if i could do it down to a hundred a twenty maybe
S0012	yeah well i you get you get that oh still your fire don't work any more do it
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	oh it work well you get that little burner in there that that should that should keep your price down a bite but i know you need hot water which be what we do that's why we light the fire this morning just to have hot water but forty gallons don't last very long with a family do it
S0152	no
S0013	no
S0152	our boiler be efficient you know when i consider how much it have come down it's come down seventy pound a month
S0012	yeah
S0152	since have the new boiler put in
S0013	yeah that's that's quite a lot isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	well there you be that's another erm seven hundred a year
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah you know but that's but that's how much it's come down
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know but if they if i could say right you know to look you know projection wise can we just drop this back to a hundred and twenty pound a month which will be thirty five pound a month less
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	and if i could cut the sky down to twenty five pound a month thirty pound a month
S0012	yeah yeah or have it for nothing freeview and
S0152	yeah i can have bt
S0012	you can have bt yeah

S0012	bt be the same a sky really innit they get a few bits and piece miss
S0152	i i for the bt football i don't have to pay
S0012	no
S0152	but there's certain channel that you can't get that aren't because i have the sport like eurosports
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	unless you have the sport you can't get it
S0012	no
S0152	and if you ask just for the eurosports it's as much to have that as it be to keep
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0152	which be like six pound a month
S0012	yeah
S0152	so i just need to go back to sky and say what's what
