S0519	it's just that i don't think she have the
S0520	what do she do then just a sandwich
S0519	i think she just have like a boil egg or some soup
S0520	especially now it's get cold you really do need a warm meal it's kind of er
S0519	she complain that the the wiltshire meals be too big for her as well and i say well serve yourself onto your plate what you want from it chuck the rest in the bin
S0520	in the bin
S0519	that's what you do
S0520	that's what i do with with er food like i just take
S0519	you have what you like
S0520	mm yeah you just have what you like and then you chuck it but
S0519	we learn that didn't we i i've learn that from you
S0520	well yeah and i've learn it from you in the sense of just like
S0519	this be it now yeah
S0520	you know don't make a deal out of it
S0519	don't that's not that's right
S0520	mm
S0519	but yeah i think it come home to me with you
S0520	mm
S0519	that you know and to just look after yourself and have the thing you want
S0520	mm
S0519	and with when he's he have he's have lot of issue with food in the last years and
S0520	i know
S0519	we'd be go out for a meal or he'd be come to us for a meal and he'd say of i don't know if i'm go to fancy it and i just say look you order exactly what you want and you eat two mouthfuls it's still worth it
S0520	whatever you want mm
S0519	you just have two mouthfuls of what you want
S0520	mm
S0519	and that's all you need
S0520	yeah it's all just different for grandma isn't it and that be the be the sore point be that it's not how it be and it's not how she's use to it be still
S0519	yeah that's right
S0520	at ninety two it's pretty hard to
S0519	oh we say we would let her know we be home
S0521	right
S0520	give her a cally
S0521	i be just send a mail to explain more or less what we just discuss
S0519	erm hang on a second cos there be a couple of things ask us to do as well
S0521	yeah i send him a summary of that yesterday
S0519	erm well he ask
S0521	i summarise i say we've do the the bedroom
S0519	mm
S0521	we've do the erm fall fall detectors
S0520	be that break
S0519	we don't know they they say they would send an engineer to look at it dad say my throw it on the floor idea wasn't good enough
S0520	what you didn't just chuck it on the grind see if it
S0519	that's what for
S0519	he say no i'm go to ring the people and ask properly
S0521	well
S0520	well it's a question of how sensitive it's suppose to be isn't it
S0521	as discuss have it have it yes exactly have it work we wouldn't have know if it normally work have it not work we wouldn't have solve anything
S0519	no so anyway they're send an engineer
S0520	that sound clever
S0521	so
S0519	that's very clever
S0521	and the advert for the car we've do as well
S0520	have you mm
S0519	so there be couple of things
S0521	hey
S0519	listen
S0521	we have a valet they come out to the house and do it and it's magnificent isn't it
S0519	beautifully valet
S0520	what's a valet
S0519	you know for the car
S0521	clean inside and out
S0519	and we do ours while we be on
S0520	do you it need it there's like coffee on the wall and stuff
S0519	it be really gross in there it's absolutely beautiful now
S0520	that's cool like proper polish and stuff
S0519	proper polish and a good scrub and everything erm so we do both cars that be cool so hang on erm it there be just some subtleties
S0520	mm
S0521	well if there's anything er i i can tell him now you're right
S0519	there be a couple of subtleties so along with the bed move
S0521	yeah
S0519	have ask us to ask you mum about have the single bed
S0521	yeah
S0519	so we can say that erm we talk about that and say she say she would try it move first that she didn't want to go you know that it would be a phase down the line but we do discuss it with her but she she want to try out first of all move it away from the wall which we do
S0521	yeah yeah i know i do mention that it be er okay couple of
S0519	and the second one be that he ask me to look into a tabletop fridge
S0520	yeah the fridge be so awkward to get at isn't it down there
S0521	oh yes
S0520	even for me it's awkward
S0519	it's really awkward it's extra especially awkward i've no idea why but ours be too you don't realise
S0520	a little bite but it's smaller than yours
S0519	yeah
S0520	it's underneath all of that
S0519	stuff
S0520	stuff and then next to it be the door another door
S0519	mm i know it's really awkward so have ask me to look into a and to talk to your mum about it and just to say that i've bring up the idea and tell her that it would need to go at the that we would need to take one of the cupboards out and that it possibly it would have to go in front of the window
S0520	mm
S0519	and erm
S0520	next to the sink
S0519	next to the sink and she erm and that she listen
S0521	do you mean
S0519	and agree that the other
S0521	swap side then
S0519	sorry
S0521	swap side
S0519	no swap the fridge buy a tabletop fridge
S0521	oh sorry can we just deal with the bed
S0519	oh
S0521	so with the bed
S0519	she agree to
S0521	she's agree to try it as it be now
S0519	move
S0521	but we also discuss swap side
S0519	we also discuss phase two if that didn't work would be to try swap side and third in line to the throat be swap the bed to the single bed she would only consider that if none of the above work
S0520	because she can't get out of the bed be it too high
S0519	no it's erm it have so it be the side that she's on in the furthest from the bathroom which you know but then have say that she hasn't always be on that side she use to be on the other side but have the same hip thing as me
S0520	oh really
S0519	and he couldn't sleep on his hip so he that swap side
S0520	they swap
S0519	so she's not the furthest away from the bathroom and it be too close to the wall to get the walker in so she be just manage or not as the case may be so anyway we've move it away from the wall so he can get the walker i erm
S0520	mm
S0521	right on the fridge we discuss desktop
S0519	and erm and that it would a cupboard would need to come out and it could go in front of and it would have to go in front of the window be probably the simplest solution on the leave hand side look out of the window
S0520	right so have it on top of the counter
S0519	kinda
S0520	mm yeah cos it'll open
S0521	well the freezer's underneath
S0519	the freezer's underneath and the fridge would go above if you like and we would have to take the leave hand cupboard out or it wouldn't be useful cos it would cover up that anyway just say we discuss a tabletop fridge and the possibilities and although she agree that the current fridge be very awkward and she couldn't get stuff out of it erm she didn't agree to have the new fridge yet but that that be something to keep go on about erm
S0521	good
S0519	so what have you say about since we leave we've be think about get her talk to her about get somebody to come and prepare meals for her
S0521	just reflect on the weekend mum be in a lot of pain barely able to get out of the chair we think she's close to not be able to or find it too much effort to prepare her own meals we know she's just have a fall but we see her get thinner and weaker
S0520	mm
S0519	as as they have do and they've say so you could perhaps put that in as in
S0521	like you
S0519	like you we have see blah cos otherwise it's touchy feely
S0520	politics
S0521	it's we think of this first
S0519	we we're we're far more observant that you
S0520	oh no that's not how it should be be it
S0519	no
S0520	disaster
S0521	we think that have carers to prepare meals might be a good option what do you think
S0519	the carers to prepare a dinner or a cook meal
S0520	one one meal a day
S0519	once a day
S0520	yeah
S0521	okay couple of other things on the bed mum say she would like to try the bed in its new position before think of a new one we might also look at swap side to put her nearer to the bathroom
S0520	that would make sense
S0519	before look into swap to your one be really the thing
S0520	mm
S0521	do you have any experience as a proofreader
S0519	erm actually i do darling
S0520	mum's just verbally edit your email this be what i do as well
S0519	and you should say it like this and you want to say it like this
S0521	on the fridge we discuss the tabletop and agree the exist new one be very awkward
S0519	however
S0520	however it's just the beginnings of
S0519	this be only the start point that it's be raise really
S0520	you can get very canny little fridges these days small ones well i guess she doesn't have a very small one
S0519	i look at see what i would have and will have in my new house
S0520	be a massive one with those ice machine
S0519	oh yes i'll have that really but
S0519	if if i don't yeah but i'm definitely they're just so cool
S0520	american fridge's yeah
S0519	oh actually you're right that's what i will have but what they have now be erm for under table you can have them either side by side but say that's your countertop
S0520	mm
S0519	it's a a drawer
S0520	drawer fridge
S0519	a drawer fridge so you pull it out like a nice big deep draw and the bottle and everything just stand up in it so you just pick them out like that
S0520	mm what about all your vegetables and things in baskets
S0519	and you have a different drawer and you have them at different temperatures so you maybe have two drawers one for all your veggies and blah blah blahs and one for your other things and then two more drawers of freezer drawers you know and they all stack up in any way that you like
S0520	mm
S0519	isn't that just glorious
S0520	it sound fantastic
S0519	and i so i send they're about six hundred quid for two drawers but that wouldn't matter we just wouldn't have to tell how much it cost erm so i send a picture of them and he so if you have one on top of the other say where they be at the moment or even at the freezer position near the sink erm er still think it would be too low
S0520	yeah she doesn't want to have to bend down
S0519	no i i just think if you're i know i'm small so i it doesn't but if you pull it out the thing that you can't do in a fridge be you have to do that
S0520	mm yeah but not if it's at body height
S0519	but in the drawer you just have to do that
S0520	mm
S0519	but in the lower drawer you get to do that but it's you haven't get to look for it it's right there you can see it and you just get to lift it up
S0520	yeah
S0519	but he say he think it would be too low down anyway so
S0520	i like the idea i think well if the if there be a fridge on top of the counter that would be sort of
S0519	simple one
S0520	arm height eye height you know like that
S0519	yeah it's just it's go to look seriously ugly
S0520	it's go to look ugly and it's gonna obscure the view of the garden isn't it
S0519	yeah
S0520	mm yeah there's nowhere else to really put it be there cos that counter on the leave hand side be really narrow
S0519	that's right it's very narrow and erm
S0520	mm
S0519	yeah it need to be right up in order for it to be an improvement on the one that's there already
S0520	mm definitely grandma really care how things look as well doesn't she she want it all to be
S0519	she didn't want us to move the bed because it wouldn't look right
S0520	mm yeah i understand
S0519	and i i know that i get that but they all the carers be say
S0520	you just want things to be practical yeah
S0519	i know it might not look quite as as nice but we're talk about your safety you know and your ease of use so the other thing you be say what's wrong with her bed erm i think the mattress be quite cheap and it squash
S0520	mm
S0519	so when you sit on the edge of it
S0520	lose balance mm
S0519	it squash down so she slide off before she's get her feet round she's kinda slide down it erm
S0520	mm
S0519	and she doesn't have any strength to well of course you can't hold yourself up on it because then it just squash down when you're sit on it
S0520	they're the oldest mattresses in the world aren't they
S0519	i think they buy a new one for this new bed
S0520	oh they do
S0519	that go up and down the bed be super duper
S0521	this might be the er the er don't don't spend much er
S0520	no just er
S0521	approach to life
S0520	we sleep in that bed and i when we be kid that be like dip in the middle and then as we grow older and older we just we couldn't resist the force of the dip it be like
S0519	you just have to lie on top of each other
S0520	a big hole in the middle of the bed it just have to so we would roll into it
S0521	well actually i i remember cos i actually make a remark that for at least ten years they sleep on a bed which be hold up by bricks
S0519	admit it she say oh yes we have those bricks for a very long time
S0521	she admit it didn't she yeah
S0520	do you have a dippy bed as well
S0519	and everywhere in the house
S0520	do you have a dippy bed in that in that have that have that be change as well
S0519	the little bed be now a proper bed as well
S0520	the one you sleep be not dip any more
S0519	the the one we sleep in be not dip bite it's pretty old it's a three and it's a three quarter bed i mean it's just the most annoy size
S0520	that's small
S0519	it's teeny
S0521	it's quite uncomfortable as well isn't it quite er
S0519	extremely uncomfortable
S0521	unsupportive
S0519	erm there's two like wafer thin pillow
S0519	my i i wake up my arm numb
S0521	well that's not as bad as me i have the clothe pinch off me
S0519	dad's get all the cover
S0521	you go
S0519	i have to do that cos you allow them all to drift off onto the floor
S0520	classic
S0521	i just have my leg out
S0519	you're you
S0520	classic
S0519	hoick them no it's the seriously you don't sleep for
S0520	argument no it's not ideal be it
S0521	i didn't realise that little white plug in the live room actually go through the wall into the kitchen
S0519	the number of the number of electrical disasters in that house
S0519	be beyond anybody's understand
S0521	it be a bite of a palaver because when the the people come to install the new lift
S0519	mm
S0521	they refuse to do it on the one one the plug sockets
S0519	they say it's be take for here to there to everywhere
S0521	wasn't safe
S0520	grandad's be do his diy
S0519	you couldn't he's be do his diy
S0521	the best be the shed isn't it the shed you go into the shed and then there's wire all over the place
S0520	oh god
S0521	and there's a switch right next to the door and you switch it on and nothing happen and it only after repeat trial and error do you find that in the middle of the shed there's a plug socket and if you switch the plug socket on all of the light come on
S0520	oh dear
S0519	he er he do
S0520	so what do you have to get an electrician out to put a new plug in
S0519	no they they they find
S0520	they rejigged it
S0519	one that they would accept and redo it from that
S0521	yeah
S0519	erm but you find the most love you know he's put up all these things to help grandma
S0521	yeah that's right
S0519	and mostly they're quite awkward
S0519	erm and difficult look
S0521	do you like the toffee tin with a handle on it
S0519	but that's what i be just gonna say
S0521	yeah
S0519	they the the toffee tin come out of the car so they have their little sweeties in the tin in the car
S0520	oh shame
S0519	and it's a nice little tin with a lid you know and it be in the car door and he'd drill hole into the end of it
S0521	yeah
S0519	and bolt on a little make do handle so that grandma could pull it up and get the toffees out
S0520	so sweet
S0519	it's just the nicest thing
S0521	yeah
S0519	and you know it'd probably be that they'd be out and say shall we have a toffee and she couldn't reach it
S0520	she couldn't reach it yeah
S0519	and he'd bring it in and put a handle on it
S0520	sweet
S0519	oh dear it's absolutely lovely
S0520	mm
S0519	it's nice when we're there cos we have nice chat about him don't we
S0521	yeah we do
S0520	that's cool yeah
S0519	that's the best bite really think she really enjoy talk about him
S0521	and any number of gadgets he be mad about gadgets wasn't he in the garage and they're some of them hadn't even really be take out of the packet
S0519	no say the same
S0520	that's what i remember about him
S0519	he get more and more that he keep order stuff and we didn't even know what most of it be do we
S0521	no
S0520	he just one of the things i remember be those catalogue
S0519	yes he love them
S0520	that he always look through and buy like you know circle things and in and
S0521	yeah
S0519	yeah
S0520	don't know anyone else who have the you know who would shop in that way and just like funny things like
S0519	no no
S0521	mm
S0519	and i think the more they do it then the more little catalogue they get from various different place
S0520	and then they start to target you don't they
S0521	ah
S0519	and they they target them and there be there's one that i've enjoy look through they're absolutely fascinate and they're full of kind of age target gadgets you know
S0521	yeah
S0519	there's
S0520	things to
S0519	furry hot water bottle slippers and
S0519	you know a a tray with a cushion and a you know everything target to that age and you go through and you're absolutely rivet at what you can do
S0520	yeah the kind of stuff that they think of
S0519	the kind of stuff that people can think up
S0520	that's what i remember about it as well
S0519	and that you think you do not actually need a single thing from this book
S0520	but it's quite fun
S0519	but it's quite fun and i think he start to gradually order from that sort of thing
S0521	mm have you hear about the tray with the cushion i mean you actually suggest it and mum say oh yes we've get one of those
S0519	and they they've get four
S0521	they've get four
S0519	but we don't know where they be
S0520	a cushion that you put it on your lap yeah i've see that that's quite cool
S0519	and it's quite cool so grandma her knees don't you know
S0521	she can't
S0519	so she can't rest the tray on her lap cos it just slide off
S0520	mm
S0519	so we've be sit at the fire to have our meals and she say that that's what she do cos she can't sit on the chair at the table cos they're too dangerous
S0520	oh dear
S0519	erm but she can't hold the tray up so she'd get the tray sort of balance like that half on the arm and and that be work better and you be say oh that that work better with it a bite on the arm
S0520	mm
S0519	and then we both almost say together oh you can get those trays with a soft bottom and then you could get it you know sort of wedge in
S0520	properly wedge in yeah
S0519	and she say oh we've get two of those well we buy two and then and give us another two so we've get four where be they
S0520	where be they yeah
S0519	oh dear do they give them away to somebody else they probably think they be well they probably sit at the table still then
S0520	do you think so
S0519	i i don't know i they sit at the trolley for lunch
S0520	mm
S0519	whether they just sit at the table
S0521	oh the old trolley
S0519	the old trolley
S0520	the trolley
S0521	the liability trolley
S0520	the classic trolley with the gold
S0519	the gold wheel that go
S0520	wobble all over the place
S0519	nothing be leave on it by the time you get it to its place i buy well i find it i i i
S0521	you do that's true
S0519	i know that erm it exist cos have one erm erm and i look up the the hideous trolley which we know would never agree to have erm and it's you'll see it when you go you might have see it it's like two plastic trays and a a walk frame
S0520	oh cool yeah handy
S0519	on big like walk wheel
S0520	oh no when we when and i go last time it be the er it be the gold trolley cos grandma's try to move it and she can't
S0519	with no that's with the walk frame absolutely no
S0520	what's go on
S0519	so i buy we think what she'd have enough of us tell her what to do anyway so
S0520	fair enough
S0519	we just say look let's us buy it and give it to her at a present and she'll hate it but she she won't be able to say that she hat how it look cos it look like a you know for an old person
S0521	it look like a cafeteria
S0519	it and it doesn't look pretty like her gold trolley
S0520	no golden bits yeah
S0519	and we be so thrill then the next time we go she say i've do hundreds of miles with this trolley it's absolutely perfect
S0520	oh great
S0521	she use it a lot now doesn't she
S0519	like she use it for everything
S0520	mm
S0521	every meal
S0519	because the other the nice thing with it be it's get the swivel wheel so you just can go either direction and so in the kitchen she like empty the dishwasher onto it and then push the stuff across and you know she can use it to move things round
S0520	ideal yeah
S0521	mm
S0519	as well as to carry them through for her dinner and it you can pull it right up so she can get her cup of tea off it and her plate off it and it's all
S0521	i notice the gold trolley be now in the lounge i who do that probably be it he's put it out of sight hasn't he
S0519	i think i do i i might have
S0520	hide the gold trolley
S0519	not straight away of course cos that
S0521	oh you do it
S0519	i but i think once she decide that the other one be good
S0521	mm
S0519	erm i don't know i probably wouldn't have be cheeky enough to move it maybe it be but i be just happy that she wasn't use it any more
S0520	oh she yeah if she's not use it that's fine
S0519	unless she rebrought it in specially for you two
S0520	i don't know yeah she definitely definitely have it out
S0519	oh heck
S0520	and erm well yeah that's the classic isn't it when we use to arrive from holland and late at night and then come out with the trolley with cheese and biscuits
S0519	that be the best thing wasn't it
S0520	it be the best thing
S0519	yeah
S0520	cheese and biscuits sandwich crisp
S0519	and the trolley be another one of your dad's specialities isn't it
S0520	biscuits
S0519	it's get bolt all over it
S0521	it have yeah
S0520	yeah it's be go a long time as well i remember it from when i be i don't know if it's the same trolley but
S0519	no they have an original
S0521	no the idea of it
S0520	i remember from when i be really small
S0519	the the the gold one with the big wheel and the small wheel be later
S0521	that go back a long way that idea
S0519	the they've always have a trolley
S0520	yeah and like proper china tea cup
S0521	i remember dad come when dad come home at work from the chemist he be probably eight o'clock he would have tea on his own off the trolley
S0520	would he
S0519	mm
S0520	well so that's even further back
S0520	yeah
S0519	em so we think we would go out for tea
S0521	mm
S0519	be nice to have a break but would you like to ring your mum and just
S0521	oh i forget that so what's that corner do on the table
S0519	have you get the phone
S0520	oh yeah i've get the phone

S0519	chuck it in the bin erm
S0521	so we leave her watch p and p
S0519	yeah we get there be the six episodes

S0520	she might have i can't tell you have to look at your own phone
S0519	mm don't worry she'll have send them to me that's nice and easy innit
S0520	mm
S0519	how's
S0520	not the best he's have all kind of difficulties of a practical nature with his business and his partner be be a bite rubbish
S0519	his
S0520	his business partner
S0519	oh that's right
S0520	so it's really stress him out he's very busy so he have a lot to do and then there be like calamities because his partner lose the tablet that have all the inventory information things that be like annoy really annoy to him i'm if somebody for me of somebody lose something i'm fully sympathetic i'm just like yeah know what you know what like he doesn't ever lose anything and it's all on a list and it's all you know he's not stupid so he doesn't have tolerance for that type of disorganise chaotic way of of live you know
S0520	so he's have it's a stress because of that because he's just just er always you know struggle against that the tide really and they they've decide not to erm i've be watch great british menu erm they've decide not to sign any contract in term of their partnership until in next year because this year he's be learn the rope he's be try things he hasn't make the business profitable which be quite a big erm factor in whether he to to show whether he's a suitable partner or not you know like they weren't make profit and on his own be make enough profit to erm amply serve his lifestyle so his idea for have a business partner be to increase his profit
S0519	mm
S0520	and to make the business more viable for him and more flexible
S0519	mm
S0520	and to have more freedom
S0519	mm
S0520	and to able to eventually withdraw himself from the business that's be his that's his like long term plan you know to set up a business that's kind of self sustain
S0519	mm
S0520	so there's a bite of there's a litmus test isn't it if you profit be go down because your partner be not able to even keep it at the same level as what it be you know
S0519	mm
S0520	you know be work a couple of days a week in different market and fair and whatever sell the jewellery and make decent money because he be efficient because he's really good at it and because he know what to do so anyway those be the things and also he's not entrepreneurial so he's not like come up with ideas or like he's just he's more like a worker he really work hard and he graft and he get up and he work you know he's really he's not a lazy guy he's really like but he doesn't he just do the job that he's give you know he doesn't think how can i do this job better or
S0519	mm no but you can't even learn that
S0520	he doesn't come up with new ideas you can't
S0519	if you've not get it you've not get it
S0520	that's what i say and i also say
S0519	he could be a slave for somebody else
S0520	if someone be chaotic they can improve it like i have become more less chaotic more organise
S0519	mm me too
S0520	i'm able to plan things more but i'm still quite disorganise fundamentally because i don't care
S0519	mm
S0520	and it's a skill that you can learn to a degree but i'm never go to be or i'm never go to be it's in their nature to
S0519	it's no it's it's a skill you can learn
S0520	you can learn the skill
S0519	but it's not it's not a talent and that and they're and that's a different level so somebody like or erm they've actually get a gift of see how to be that long term and that plan and that how everything should fit together where to put the file how to make it all happen what sort of system to run that make it all work
S0520	mm it's all like come inherently to him
S0519	i haven't get any of that
S0520	like he
S0519	yeah
S0520	think like that
S0519	he think in that way
S0520	he want you know he
S0519	that's right
S0520	he approach a problem in that way
S0519	mm that's right
S0520	it's like that
S0519	whereas you and me we can fight the
S0520	fundamental tendency
S0519	general chaos
S0520	yeah that's right whereas and this boy be more in that category you know he he work
S0519	mm
S0520	in a circular way and he he have other qualities like he's very personable he's very enthusiastic he's very very good at sell which be a key factor
S0519	well that should be alright
S0520	yeah
S0519	i be think maybe he wasn't
S0520	no he's good at the actual sell part so that's a really big thing cos that's a that be a talent as well it's a different type of skill you know erm so you know he her certain things but i say my my idea be that he would be better off in another position like in as as the retail manager of 's company but not as a partner to to his business because he's not get the entrepreneurial side and he's not get the vision and he's not get the efficiency to take that
S0519	so he can't take the business further
S0520	yeah to take his side of the business to the level that want it to be at you know and er
S0519	or beyond
S0520	if exactly
S0519	mm
S0520	if be i mean the idea of take a partner in business be to improve his life right
S0519	mm
S0520	he be like i've reach a certain plateau in his business he have enough money but he didn't have load of money and he didn't have a security for the future in term of erm like a a long term plan for the future where he could actually stop work at some point you know and whatever so he say right this be phase two of my business i've reach the top of my game i know how to do it i'll take a partner who expand all the retail side of it and bring in different wholesale partner and expand it and i will move only to production
S0519	mm
S0520	and eventually he can teach someone else his side of the company
S0519	mm
S0520	and bob's your uncle if his life be not improve and be business be not improve there there be there be no reason in fact it's get it's become harder in a way because he's constantly have to negotiate with this guy whereas before
S0519	mm mm it be up to him
S0520	it be up to him and his be
S0519	i suppose you have to give him a decent time that's the only that
S0520	that's fine that's what they're do erm but i think the longer it go on the more personal obligations be create you know they be friends
S0519	mm
S0520	since a long time anyway and it's difficult to then say this be not work
S0519	mm this be not work but i suppose he can
S0520	so but he's be honest and he's say look there's we're we're not sign a contract and this be reason why and let's give it this amount of time and
S0519	mm mm
S0520	if it doesn't work then it's not go to happen
S0519	it's quite stressful isn't it
S0520	it be stressful and it's stressful to deal with someone else's
S0519	how's his
S0520	oh no actually i think it's still in the run
S0519	that and his knee
S0520	his knee well this be it it's like when you're a bite stress then things tend to happen don't they
S0519	mm
S0520	so now he's he knock his knee on something and he's really straighten it suddenly and then he's really in pain and
S0519	oh darn oh god oh no
S0520	he's do a lot of complain
S0519	oh oh
S0520	little
S0519	ah ah ah ah ah ah

S0520	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	yeah she's not well she if you look at her face sometimes you see like those old portraits you know she have that kind of classical look about her dome's she like very long neck and erm very big eye
S0521	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	and a certain type of face shape that you would that be kind of appropriate to that like when i've see movies or remake of other jane austen book erm with modern actresses in it sometimes it's not it doesn't feel quite right
S0519	mm
S0520	because their face be be not suit for it not classically beautiful you now whereas jane have this handsome look hasn't she
S0521	mm
S0520	but yeah she's mean to be much more beautiful than lizzy in the book that's well her mum always go on about how beautiful she be
S0521	doesn't quite work do it yeah
S0520	er lizzy's suppose to be pretty but more
S0519	hello could i book a table for three for this even please
S0521	have you ever see jennifer ehle in real life
S0519	about half last seven quarter to eight something like that
S0520	she's blonde
S0521	blonde and american she doesn't have any trace of american accent do she
S0520	she hasn't she's excellent in it i think she have english ancestry
S0519	lovely see you then bye bye
S0521	okay
S0520	or like she live in england for a while or something where it's you can understand why it's so flawless cos most of the time you can tell can't you if somebody's
S0521	yes
S0520	from the other side it's like hugh laurie as well when he do house
S0521	hugh laurie with his american yeah
S0520	like people in america think he's american
S0521	they don't know he's
S0520	they're convince yeah and when he speak in english it's very posh isn't it
S0521	stephen fry say that sometimes he talk in american without realise it
S0520	he talk in american without realise
S0521	with an american accent without realise it cos of course he's he do it so much
S0520	so use to be over there yeah yeah she's good jennifer ehle she's in a lot of theatre she do a lot of a theatre apparently
S0521	mm
S0520	well nothing have come even close to that in term of an adaptation of jane austen in my opinion
S0520	yeah keira knightley be in it the movie as lizzy i be like no no no
S0519	it be horrible i watch part of it i want to cry
S0520	she's a she's fine but she's not lizzy bennett
S0519	no way jose
S0520	no way jose
S0519	but you can imagine her want to do it
S0520	well she's always give those part she's be in zhivago
S0519	that be the worst film i've ever see in my entire life
S0520	and she's be anna karenina
S0521	anna karenina as well i be just think that
S0519	no it be that be the worst
S0521	that be that be poor wasn't it
S0519	i haven't see the lara i couldn't cope
S0521	compare with the
S0520	oh it's nothing compare to the book it's more like a kind of er inspire but the book thing you know it's not even the right story
S0519	yeah it be a load of nonsense
S0520	and stuff
S0519	no it be awful
S0520	kitty and levin weren't even in it
S0519	that's the whole thing
S0520	it's very choreograph isn't it they keep dance all the time it's weird
S0519	mm erm yes all fine but england be beat at the rugby by wales
S0520	oh i know now it's all depression they be beat by three point in fairness so why they have to say that it's the end of the line
S0519	but they be the better team and it be just naughtiness they be they give away some penalties near the end and wales kick the penalties in
S0520	do that mean they're not go through
S0519	no they've get unless they can if they can beat australia
S0521	not yet not yet
S0520	they have to beat australia
S0519	which be pretty unlikely but never mind
S0520	be australia the top team
S0521	no new zealand
S0519	one of them no
S0520	new zealand yeah
S0519	new zealand south africa and australia will be the three
S0521	the southern hemisphere
S0519	erm
S0520	the south african's win
S0519	so andy can quite rightly lay lay it on you've get to watch out
S0520	yeah you've get better watch out
S0521	i didn't get any text message yet
S0519	mm you didn't look probably
S0520	sa well they win theirs by quite a quite a way didn't they
S0521	say that the first match they play all the black people cos you south african government want more black people on the team
S0520	i've hear this erm from
S0519	some sort of quota system
S0520	there's a positive discrimination system in south africa in everything so they do put black people in erm they have to have fill a quota don't they it's also the same for job and university position as well which be all fair enough to be honest but it might not
S0519	yeah
S0521	i think they probably think never mind the japanese they're hopeless we'll just put in the b team
S0519	well that's really what happen be they play the b team rather than the black team
S0520	well they'll be fine they'll win
S0521	well i didn't mean it like that but that's that's what say
S0519	they just happen to be black
S0520	of course no no it's a source of great erm pain for the south african's i think
S0519	it be it be cos they love
S0520	because they they're team you know they have such pride of that
S0521	i think it's the same as the cricket hardly any black people
S0519	there's hardly any black people do sport which be the biggest ludicrous travesty
S0520	no they're athletic do athletics don't they
S0519	no but the south africa aren't that big on
S0520	on in south africa mm no that's right no i mean of course there's always an it's always a difficult thing positive discrimination isn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	but at the end i think it's the right thing
S0519	mm
S0520	it's what they do in norway to get women into parliament
S0521	do they
S0520	fifty fifty that's the law
S0521	wow
S0520	so they just put a lot of women in who weren't necessarily as well qualify or as well sort of er
S0521	well that's what jam jam corbyn have do with his cabinet
S0520	well he's just put all the crap job
S0521	the crap job he's give to women
S0520	to the women
S0521	there's an uproar about it actually he's he satisfy the quota it's more than fifty percent women but
S0520	it's a bite insult to be honest isn't it
S0519	the time cartoon
S0520	you might as well just put one
S0519	one at the top
S0520	one at top
S0521	where can we give the women job
S0519	the time erm do you see the cartoon say er
S0521	oh the one about the polish the flag yeah
S0519	here you be erm now your job be the iron the red flag
S0520	he could have know that that would have be erm controversial couldn't he
S0521	i think he's a bite inadequate as a a public figure
S0520	he's not very convince but i think he'll learn the rope won't he like if you look at
S0519	but he's be a politician for ninety nine years he's not like
S0520	not but that's a different thing i mean as a leader figure
S0519	twenty seven
S0521	entirely different though
S0520	and someone who have to speak to the media all the time and stuff you know
S0519	yeah
S0521	he's just find fault with the labour party the entire time
S0520	mm
S0519	that's all he's do isn't it
S0520	it's not very encourage be it the way he his mannerisms and the way he erm address things like the way he narrate things and stuff
S0519	mm
S0521	i read matthew parris yesterday my
S0520	mr matt
S0521	he say er the labour party would be entirely inward look for the next five years erm
S0520	mm try to define itself yeah
S0521	and that's probably right because they've get to have a sort out their own differences he say that if you look at it they've have half a million vote to choose the the the leader and they've get to win at least twelve million to er win an election
S0520	yeah i don't see that happen
S0521	erm it's very mislead to think that they suddenly have get a labour party full of lefties
S0520	yeah
S0521	or that the voters will vote for them
S0520	mm i don't think i would
S0519	not at present
S0521	you're not you're not alone
S0520	no not that i've ever vote i say this to i be explain it to him and then i say and i i mean i wouldn't vote for him blah and then he be like have you ever vote and i be like no but i have an opinion
S0520	i've never live here so it's not really close to my heart
S0519	i didn't vote in any of the years we live in holland
S0520	no you just don't feel close enough to it do you
S0519	people use to send their postal vote in
S0521	postal vote yeah
S0520	i could understand that if you'd come away from three years and you it's still your country and you should be influence the future but if you be and you and never intend to go back why should you have a
S0520	classic
S0521	gosh she be a bite of a strange type wasn't she

S0519	i i didn't agree with him
S0521	what the idea of laugh at people
S0519	the idea of laugh at people who die be a little harsh they're foolish and stupid and if they've fall down the stairs and hurt themselves but when you have to say what be people do it you see fall down the stairs at the taj mahal be not the same as stand in front of a train that's approach you to try and get a selfie
S0521	mm
S0519	be it i mean that be erm
S0521	no that's just completely ridiculous
S0519	er that be a a deliberately put yourself at risk
S0521	yeah
S0519	whereas the somebody who fell down the stairs be just not think what he be do and have an accident but to to lose your life for it be not what you've get in mind be it really erm
S0521	have you do you read his stuff cos he he's always a bite on the edge you know
S0519	yeah i i i
S0521	with what's okay to say
S0519	yeah no i don't normally i don't think be it giles coren
S0521	giles coren yeah
S0519	yeah mm no i think i've only ever get half way through most of it
S0521	yes what what's her name the
S0519	the yes the other coren one
S0521	victoria coren's husband no her brother he brother the one that do the quiz programme
S0519	yeah they're both very clever aren't they so 's complaint be we've get no full length mirror in this house
S0520	alright
S0521	okay let's see it
S0520	just a second
S0519	have to adjust them
S0520	this be pair number one
S0519	oh beautiful
S0520	ooh
S0519	oh do the zip up for goodness sake and tuck the erm
S0521	mm that's nice
S0520	this be to go with it
S0519	oh this be beautiful
S0520	nice it's really long
S0519	absolutely gorgeous yes
S0520	for india as well cover your bum
S0521	yes i like that
S0519	lovely
S0520	so that's pair number one now the only problem with them be
S0519	yeah
S0521	no pocket
S0520	they're a little bite short
S0519	teensy bite short i would have say that
S0520	this be the long
S0519	and when they shrink
S0520	they're suppose to be long they're a long length jean
S0519	jean
S0521	oh right
S0520	but unfortunately
S0519	they're only just make it
S0521	yes you wouldn't know that you wouldn't know that they be long length
S0520	you wouldn't would you and i think it's because i've get an eight on
S0519	when you put boot on you won't see them
S0520	which i've never be an eight but in this particular store i be not tell you where
S0519	mm
S0520	and erm
S0519	too short slightly
S0520	i think because they pull up here maybe
S0519	yes
S0521	mm
S0519	erm
S0520	so but i would wear them with boot mostly
S0519	but with boot it won't it won't make any difference
S0520	if i wear them with boot they'd be like this
S0519	mm they'll be fine with boot
S0520	and in the summer i will just roll them up
S0519	and have them as slightly shorter
S0520	and have them as like ankle ones
S0519	yes they're lovely
S0520	okay so that's pair number one
S0519	very nice
S0521	pair number one
S0519	okay
S0521	what be you smile at me for be there a story here
S0519	well only one pair be mean to be keep
S0521	okay she have to make the choice
S0519	mm and one be much dearer than the other this be the thing that we i be not go to tell you
S0521	i guess that might be the case the way you say it
S0519	so we're suppose to see if we can tell the difference be it worthy of the difference
S0521	mm
S0519	which one's just better if you don't even know
S0521	regardless of cost
S0519	regardless of cost
S0521	those look quite velvety those actually
S0520	this be pair number two
S0521	oh i see what you mean yes
S0520	dad probably can't tell that i've get new jeans on erm they're a
S0519	tiny bite longer
S0520	longer they're also a long length
S0521	right
S0520	they're a little bite more roomy on the bum
S0521	so if you don't mind me say so
S0519	yeah
S0521	i think it's apples and pears the first pair be clearly more expensive and it look nicer
S0520	what do you think
S0519	first pair be nicer
S0520	these be the more expensive ones
S0521	oh
S0520	three time more expensive
S0521	oh
S0519	interest
S0520	isn't it because they do i mean the thing here be that they're a little bite higher
S0521	they fit you better yes
S0519	mm
S0520	here so that fit better
S0519	yes
S0521	yes
S0520	and yet i don't feel that this bite be quite as flatter somehow maybe it's because you know sometimes skinnies can make you knees look a bite chubby
S0519	that's what i felt with you know the cheap ones that i have i think they accentuate my chubby knees whereas these black ones seem to make them disappear
S0520	it doesn't always yeah the grey the first pair be be the same as the blue ones that i have exactly the same but for some reason they fall much shorter
S0521	mm
S0519	probably be the eight
S0520	no both of them be the same size
S0519	see when you pull them up i didn't i didn't even think they be as nice at the top
S0520	i think the problem with these might be that they they'll become a bite too baggy saggy here
S0519	mm
S0520	and you don't want any feel of that bulge bulge where you bulge
S0519	mm mm
S0520	so you think the first ones be nicer cos that be my conclusion but i can't see
S0521	i think the first ones be
S0519	i think the first ones be nicer
S0520	love it twenty pound sixty nine pound we love it you kind of
S0519	no doubt would have a different opinion
S0520	no it's not necessarily the case
S0519	but i actually really like the first pair
S0520	the thing about these jeans introduce me to them the next ones they do petite short length regular long in all the size
S0519	mm
S0520	and they're really get a lot of elastic in them so they're comfortable you don't you know
S0519	i wonder why these ones this one's more
S0520	partly it's the label
S0519	do they not do extra long
S0520	they do in some i'll have to check on line erm they partly it's the label be more a posh label that j in jls and this be from them as well and i really like it
S0519	that's beautiful
S0520	but erm they're they do feel slightly softer and nicer material but i don't know if it's all just psychosomatic i wasn't even go to order them
S0519	mm soon as you tell me they be the nicer ones i start look at them in more detail
S0520	now you're like so do i and the length be a little bite better for me
S0519	the length be slightly better but i think i actually just prefer the colour the of the other ones
S0521	me too me too
S0520	i think that's me too dad dad's on a fashion
S0519	do
S0520	no i'm happy because that be the conclusion i come to but i can't i can't see them in a mirror
S0519	er to be honest the thing will probably be will be that the other
S0520	i'll be happy to return them
S0519	yeah will the others will wear out quicker but then just buy some more
S0520	no what well exactly but what i've notice
S0519	or buy two pair of the others have two colour and feel like you've get a bargain
S0520	well that's why i be buy them in the first place bias i get a blue pair and i and then say if it's twenty pound and they do the in other colour
S0519	buy them
S0520	and you like them
S0521	half a dozen
S0520	just buy yeah they have a dark very dark blue the grey and they have wash kind of a black but this be a nice light grey
S0519	it's a lovely grey i like the grey
S0520	do

S0519	an envelope

S0520	i think i'll wear my or shall i wear them or shall i try and get a longer one
S0519	try and get a longer just in case i mean they're perfect and as you say i the summer you can roll them up and but if they be if they be an inch longer they'd be even more perfect
S0520	i'm look at them there and i
S0519	now if you just do that they they look slightly skimpier
S0520	no the colour be nicer
S0519	the colour be nice have two lot and next time buy the posh ones
S0520	i don't even want to buy the posh ones though
S0519	no
S0520	normally i would just buy the posh ones by default but
S0519	no you can see that they're now when you do that they're better quality now that i know i can't believe i i wasn't able to spot the expense that's really tragic
S0521	do you think the first ones be dearer then
S0519	i think the first ones be go to be the more expensive ones
S0521	me too
