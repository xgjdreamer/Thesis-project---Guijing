S0420	so this winter camp thing be a bite unorthodox isn't it i mean it it be be
S0366	what
S0420	i mean you're not you're not the only people do it
S0366	well as far as i can see we be
S0420	really
S0366	nobody else up there
S0420	oh god
S0420	and the last time be up in comrie be it
S0366	yeah yeah twice we've go out form comrie erm
S0420	but i mean be these spot where people would camp in the summer
S0366	no they're no they're not you know
S0420	no
S0366	they're just out in the
S0420	no it's wild camp but be be they
S0366	erm er
S0420	be they place you would choose to camp in in if you go there in the summer as well
S0366	erm i dunno i suppose suppose we might
S0365	the way we hit on them be that you've be go there since you be a kid
S0366	mm mm
S0365	and you'd know these spot like go for a walk with your dad
S0366	mm mm
S0365	and you know that they would be relatively peaceful place
S0420	mm
S0365	picturesque and so that's how we just end up set off
S0365	those place as target
S0366	and we tend to wait until it's really cold and dry so actually
S0420	so there'll be absolutely nobody there
S0366	well well it's more that erm you can go out as long you because then you keep dry if it's really that's why we wait for the weather to drop temperature wise in many ways because once the ground's freeze underfoot we can go anywhere really whereas you know there's areas where that would've be very boggy if we if it hadn't be freeze
S0365	mm
S0366	so it make walk
S0365	but it be very comfortable to walk on
S0366	very easy and you never your boot don't get wet and it's erm it's it so that's partly why in the winter we wait for it to be cold
S0420	yeah you know there's a book in this
S0420	wild winter camp in scotland i mean that's
S0365	well i'm sure people have do it
S0420	yeah and you could be take erm you know these crazy americans on tour and things like that
S0365	yeah
S0366	actually we'll show you some picture
S0365	oh that'll be nice
S0366	we'll show you some picture later after we've do this erm of some winter cos we be away this weekend but that wasn't camp
S0366	erm
S0365	but that's the ironic thing that we have just be to the highlands which be a centre of er er kind of mountains around er glen coe and it be crowd but when we go to comrie which be a village we leave er comrie high street with people walk their dog within half an hour we be in an area where we didn't see anybody for the next sixteen hours
S0366	uhu
S0365	so you know it be very peaceful
S0420	mm
S0365	so
S0420	can imagine
S0366	and then you've get you know there's place you try and go place where there's not too much light pollution so you can get the star there be one camp trip we do at corrour erm where we go up with for the gemini meteor shower didn't we
S0366	in december and erm we er there be very little light pollution so we just erm lay down in the tent with our head outside on our boot and star upwards and watch the meteor shower
S0365	yeah
S0365	with a hip flask
S0366	with a hip flask in my hand
S0365	to to keep us go
S0366	yeah
S0365	yeah
S0420	add warmth
S0366	yeah
S0420	ah it sound good
S0366	yeah it be really good
S0365	because there aren't many place here now where you can see the milky way
S0420	no
S0365	so
S0420	you'd have to go very far north i'd imagine to get away
S0365	yeah
S0420	from all the light pollution
S0366	we would see them at erm abernethy wouldn't we right
S0365	yeah
S0366	like in the middle of the wood
S0365	yeah
S0366	yeah
S0365	and i'm sure you know when we be grow up the sky look different and the you know even in the suburban area i grow up you wouldn't have to go that far to see a dark sky
S0366	mm
S0365	now it's so rare when you the milky way it take you by surprise
S0420	yeah
S0365	that it's so clear
S0420	but er any any spot of darkness in a city be quite weird i i've be drive erm cos this new job's in
S0366	oh right
S0420	erm you know place
S0366	oh yes
S0420	er just off of er street
S0366	yes
S0420	erm when i drive back i drive round by the parliament and then arthur's seat and it's it's it's really odd cos that that bite be just pitch black
S0366	mm mm
S0420	when you're drive up there in the dark and you forget you're in the middle of a city
S0366	mm
S0420	erm
S0366	mm
S0420	but of course that doesn't the the light pollution cos
S0365	mm
S0420	it's wider but er yeah
S0365	the place we'd like to go to be er kielder forest in northumberland
S0420	oh yeah
S0365	erm
S0420	yeah i've be through there
S0365	have you
S0420	yeah
S0365	oh right
S0420	just drive through
S0365	right
S0365	be it an attractive area
S0420	yeah yeah they erm there be something on the radio about that place a few a few weeks or months ago where they they be have a performance of record birdsong
S0365	uhu
S0420	but the the they'd they'd hook up all these speakers and it be to do with what bird the the raven and they they'd record raven and they they'd hook up all these speakers in the tree and they be invite people to come and like know lie in the in the forest and they they say the the because of the speakers the way they be set up they would feel like a flock of raven would fly in
S0365	mm mm
S0420	settle make whatever noise raven make
S0366	huh
S0420	and then fly off again er i never find out what the result be like but say it be gonna be really spectacular with all these sound engineer and things like that
S0366	oh
S0420	and and rspb erm sort of stuff but er
S0365	i can imagine cos one of the most spectacular things i've see in recent weeks in where i work at there be a big tree outside and i leave work one time at dusk and there be tree be full of raven
S0420	mm
S0365	land or take off or circle in dusk with you know a beautiful pink glow to the sky behind and i hadn't really go anywhere i'd just leave work and you expect to have to travel
S0420	yeah
S0365	into the wild to see things like that
S0420	what what do raven look like exactly cos they're just they're very similar to crow and whatnot aren't they
S0365	yeah to be honest i wouldn't've know the difference but a friend of mine who know about bird
S0420	oh
S0365	say that they be raven and that that they be raven and that raven stick together and crow be more solitary so
S0366	oh be that right
S0365	you can see flock
S0420	flock a flock of raven yeah
S0366	oh i didn't know that
S0365	mm
S0366	mm
S0420	well that'll be nice to see and and to hear the the be it er
S0365	it's a bite raucous
S0420	yeah
S0420	i would imagine with the distinctive call and and and on your winter camp adventure have you ever sorta come across any weird wildlife
S0366	erm
S0365	don't know about weird but er you know obviously we see a lot of deer in scotland erm
S0366	yeah i be just wonder what i saw this weekend although you weren't camp but whether it be a raven or what what bird would be up quite high at three thousand feet would it be a raven
S0420	kit
S0366	no it be either it be one of those those
S0365	that family be it
S0366	yeah
S0365	mm
S0366	i think i think say it be a raven it be up quite high
S0365	yeah
S0366	need to look up the difference between raven rook and
S0365	crow
S0366	and crow mm
S0365	mm
S0366	yeah erm
S0420	mostly deers mostly deers though
S0366	erm
S0366	we didn't see much do we we didn't see
S0365	we we saw quite a lot of deer
S0366	do we
S0365	on the cos i be on a different walk
S0366	oh yeah but camp we didn't see any deer but there be this time we be camp er it wasn't strictly winter but we be camp erm
S0365	it be summer so it wasn't strictly winter
S0366	erm carrour but it's camp
S0365	yeah
S0366	can i talk about camp in the summer
S0420	yeah yeah
S0366	and erm we find this nice bite to camp that be on the little a little bite of a knoll and it look really really nice and it be a little bite flat and and everything so anyway we put get a tent up and then we be start to cook a dinner and everything it be still light and i look out of the tent and there be a whole load of deer watch us and we be obviously on their favourite bite
S0420	on their patch
S0365	mm
S0366	and so we stay there cos we you know have everything set up and then we carry on it be start to get dark and we be cook and i just sort of glance out and and they be still there and a little baby have sit down on the grass but the others be all of like watch us
S0366	and literally we take photos as time go by it get darker and darker and all you saw be it the silhouette of these ears and these head and they just stay look at us till it get dark didn't they
S0365	mm
S0366	they be really feed up i think that we be on their bite
S0365	it be the nearest pose a dear could take to stand with its hand on its hip
S0420	gently sort of shake its head from side to side
S0365	yeah that's right yeah
S0366	that's not allow
S0420	get out of here
S0366	i know it be very funny the photos be good i think we've get them somewhere the photos erm but
S0365	there's something about camp outdoors where especially in winter where you wake up and look out first thing in the morning
S0366	mm
S0365	and the outdoors be right there there's not a layer of glass between you and it so
S0420	yeah
S0365	it's better even than stay in a hotel and so long as you're warm it's it's
S0420	warm and dry
S0365	warm and dry
S0420	yeah
S0365	yes
S0366	mm
S0365	it's the loveliest
S0420	yeah
S0365	experience really
S0366	we always eat the same thing when we're camp don't we
S0365	yeah
S0366	in er we haven't quite move to your idea of couscous
S0420	you haven't move to couscous no
S0366	but we do do pasta and tuna and chilli and onion don't we and
S0365	mm
S0366	but we get really annoy this time at christmas because erm we buy these tin of of tuna that say it be in oil but they they be really they have hardly any oil cos normally we use the oil in the tuna to cook the onion
S0420	yeah
S0366	and chilli and there we couldn't get any squeeze any oil out of it d'you remember
S0365	no and when you read the tin it say erm
S0366	like
S0365	low amount of oil for health reason or something like that
S0366	we want like like lot of oil
S0420	yeah yeah yeah ah well
S0366	that keep us go all night and read thing about and he be look at four season bag and you be on the web weren't you and it be
S0366	tell you about how to use a four season bag
S0365	cos i be a bite chilly
S0420	yeah
S0365	i have to admit with my er sleep bag that i've have since i be in the scout
S0420	uhu just a regular
S0420	regular sleep bag
S0365	so i want to invest one like 's proper down bag
S0366	what be it it you you read the instructions
S0365	well what they say be about down bag be that people buy them
S0366	it's quite interest
S0365	without know a lot about them and the bag the manufacturers will say good down to minus two degrees or minus eight degrees but it say that's erm a a fallacy really that people who know what they're do know that your body body weight size er will make a difference your metabolism
S0420	mm
S0365	will make a difference erm but significantly what you eat before you get in the sleep bag will make a difference
S0420	really
S0365	so you should eat fatty food
S0420	oh okay
S0365	and that will that will act as a fuel but the one thing also it say be you should get into the bag a down bag already warm so do star jump
S0365	do star jump then get in your bag
S0420	right don't include this bite in the book cos you're just gonna confuse them
S0420	so a bunch of bunch of deer star you down as you're do star jump
S0420	no wonder the deer be star
S0366	that be funny how
S0420	but no that make sense though
S0365	mm
S0420	so it's
S0366	yes it's not really really
S0420	it's not gonna heat you up
S0366	it's not gonna heat you up it's gonna keep your keep your heat but
S0420	yeah
S0365	no
S0366	yeah
S0420	but that's what be yeah
S0366	make sense yeah mm
S0420	well i'm sure they'll design one with an electric blanket one day
S0366	yeah heat heat down what do you call it sheet
S0365	yeah
S0420	just you know with those erm like fibre optic or something inside that
S0365	yeah yeah
S0420	you you know you press press them
S0366	you just plug yourself in
S0420	yeah it'd have to have like a really good battery life or something just keep you toasty through the night that'd be nice
S0365	yeah
S0420	good
S0366	but we would never get cold in the tent well we do cook but i mean you you cook in your sleep i mean not in your sleep bag
S0366	you cook from your sleep bag
S0365	lean out into the porch yeah
S0366	mm mm
S0365	yeah
S0420	and what sort of distance do you cover before camp down i mean
S0366	well these trip we didn't leave till two in the afternoon it get cold at half
S0366	er dark at half four so we do about twelve fifteen miles the second time didn't we
S0365	yeah or you know
S0366	that be within
S0365	total trip
S0366	twenty four hours
S0365	two half days
S0366	two half days
S0365	mm
S0366	and then
S0365	mm
S0366	the other one hang on
S0365	oh well we do two days but we didn't go that far either
S0366	the second day no
S0365	yeah because the second day we run out of food so we er
S0366	we eat each each other
S0365	yes we we do
S0420	you you you you didn't forage
S0365	well
S0366	we be only plan to go one night it be so it be so good we think right we'll drop and down into and pick up some supply
S0366	and er there be it be the day after box day there's almost nothing open be there
S0365	mm
S0366	there's one never go to the little shop in it's get absolutely nothing in it
S0365	no yeah
S0366	i think we get an onion didn't we
S0420	that's what i like about when i be do the walk in in in france in the pyrenees
S0366	oh yeah
S0420	be stop off in little villages and pick up the local sausage or the local cheese and the local pastries
S0365	mm yeah
S0366	mm yeah
S0420	cos even go from village to village in the mountains there's quite a stark difference between each
S0366	mm
S0420	erm place
S0365	yes
S0420	and it's we've kinda lose that a little bite here i think you know
S0365	definitely
S0420	each village be gonna be very generic
S0365	yeah
S0420	in term of the tea room and the the erm
S0366	uhu
S0420	the availability of the same instant noodles in each grocery shop
S0365	that's the lovely thing about france though be that er food be still central to their way of life and er
S0420	yeah i think it be in a lot of countries it just seem to be here where we've kinda
S0366	i think it's still central but it's sort of in a i mean depend what you mean by central really i mean
S0420	international
S0366	mm
S0365	well the quality the quality of the food and erm
S0420	people's passion for it
S0365	yes the presentation and preparation
S0366	well it's not revere in any way it's it's it's just you know it's just stick in
S0365	fuel
S0420	yeah
S0366	fuel with lot of calories and
S0365	yeah
S0420	well we be we be talk about this at the party last night about how you know people say some people turn their nose up at the farmers' market cos it's it be more expensive and it be but it be of of course it's gonna be
S0365	mm
S0420	erm
S0366	mm
S0420	and you know you can be it's easy to be cynical about these things but really it's it's very important i mean when you go to the market in a spanish town or in a french village it you that be the farmers' market the difference be
S0365	mm
S0420	here we've get to label it and brand it because people
S0365	yeah
S0420	otherwise want their twenty p cucumber and
S0365	mm
S0420	there's they don't realise that that's it's it's it's not really sustainable
S0366	mm
S0420	and it's not really realistic
S0365	also people forget that we grow up erm really with a system where you would go out to the shop every day and you would erm bring fresh
S0420	mm
S0365	vegetables er back and the the
S0420	and seasonal vegetables as well
S0365	seasonal yeah
S0420	that's
S0366	mm mm
S0420	that's the one thing that people take have lose
S0365	and the cost would be a a much higher proportion of your weekly income than it be now
S0366	mm mm
S0420	yeah
S0365	so people use supermarkets because they're you know make all this produce or sell all this produce cheaply but for one thing they've ship halfway the round the country cos they're do everything in bulk and through distribution centre and erm
S0420	well also they're do those deal with the farmers where the farmers be
S0365	yeah
S0420	struggle aren't they
S0365	that's right
S0420	well
S0366	yes
S0420	not struggle but
S0420	almost almost yeah well i mean it's a double edge sword isn't it really
S0366	mm yes
S0420	farmers be it's not it can't be a disaster for anybody otherwise erm nobody would do it you know there'd be no money in it at all so it can't be that bad but
S0365	that's why i'm always prepare to spend our money on good food
S0420	yeah
S0365	i think if somebody's take the trouble to produce something well then
S0420	well then yeah
S0365	we should reward them
S0420	yeah and
S0366	mm
S0420	that that be the nice thing about live in in for example in catalonia in that you could you could always be sure cos they have the twice weekly market that be just the market and everybody go to it and yes it be more expensive but it's better than go to mercadona all the time
S0366	yes yeah definitely
S0420	so
S0366	yeah i don't like go to you know mercadona i know we're not on winter camp any more we're now in spain
S0366	but i hate go in there and all that plastic stuff when you can go to a market it just doesn't
S0420	yeah
S0366	make sense do it dad and go to mercadona a lot and
S0365	oh yeah
S0366	while they be there they'd go to market as well
S0365	mm mm
S0420	think get a bite jade by
S0366	market
S0420	the spanish yeah the spanish lifestyle
S0366	mm mm
S0420	but yeah dunno but the seasonal thing be you know as as someone say last night if if you ask most people okay what what be the season for aubergines
S0365	mm
S0420	don't know
S0365	mm that's right
S0366	or where they come from
S0420	yeah
S0365	yeah
S0366	where do they come from
S0420	but this be it i mean everything's available all year round although i do find in lidl they be quite seasonal
S0365	mm
S0420	in term of the their their availability
S0365	it's ironic that they've actually get a good reputation for vegetables
S0420	yeah yeah erm i buy 's wine for his birthday at lidl and he say it be very nice i buy one of the more expensive ones but apparently
S0365	three pound
S0365	three fifty
S0420	erm no it be about twelve thirteen pound but erm
S0365	wow
S0420	accord to er you know some people that would be the equivalent of spend twenty quid elsewhere so
S0365	mm
S0420	i don't know he say it be nice
S0365	mm
S0420	probably need to buy him a case of the stuff to apologise for last night but that's
S0366	do they do they go to sleep do they lie on your bed or something
S0420	no i'm i i i kind of like why didn't they
S0366	uhu
S0420	but
S0366	mm
S0420	i think it be more that they couldn't contact us as well
S0366	right
S0420	cos didn't
S0365	be they worry
S0420	no i don't think worry but it's it's true if there have be an emergency they wouldn't've be able to get in touch with us cos we didn't have erm 's home number
S0365	right
S0420	the the the so anyway a faux pas
S0365	mm well we have an instant last weekend where i be try to contact go out ice climb with a a leader and they be back much later than i expect and er i be try to contact the leader of course we didn't have mobile phone contact and
S0420	no
S0365	he didn't
S0420	yeah
S0365	so
S0420	it's funny though because of mobile phone it's like you expect people to be available at all time so if there isn't
S0365	yeah
S0420	if if for some reason you can't get through it's a it's a disaster and
S0365	yeah
S0420	oh god you know use to have to panic whereas maybe twenty years ago we wouldn't've react in the same way
S0366	mm
S0420	i dunno i dunno think that some people have always be like that but cos mobiles be so ubiquitous you
S0366	mm
S0420	almost kind of expect people to be able to answer them all the all the time
S0365	mm although i tend not to i i tend not to take them into the hill i'll have one on me because i've get there train and i've take the phone with me but i i try not to
S0420	no
S0365	use it if i'm out in the hill
S0366	yeah
S0420	yeah there's no need really be there
S0365	no
S0420	you've get it on you so if there's an emergency you you'll have to take it out get a signal
S0365	well you see i'm even a little bite extreme on that front because er i think people shouldn't carry a phone think that they can call for help
S0420	ah yeah
S0365	so i think the phone should be take off them as soon as they go into the hill and then
S0365	they know they have to rely on themselves you know have to be self reliant have to plan properly
S0366	what have phone depots in the highlands
S0420	have phone wardens
S0365	yeah
S0420	chase you and not check if you've get the right kit but actually take bits of kit off you
S0365	yeah that's right
S0420	yeah
S0365	yeah to
S0420	and and by the way you know that waterproof don't be so soft you know get out there and
S0420	yeah fair enough
S0365	cos there's too many people i think go out now think well i think mountain rescue complain about this they get call from people on the top of snowdon say i'm tire i'm at the top of snowdon i'm too tire to get back
S0420	prrr
S0365	can you come and get me
S0420	yeah there be that be that a school group from england last year go or two years ago go up erm ben nevis you know and the kid be in short and
S0365	really
S0420	erm you know the er some of the girls be in skirt and shoe and
S0366	amaze
S0420	yeah this be with adults
S0366	god
S0420	take them and
S0365	mm
S0420	funnily enough you the weather change up there so quickly
S0366	mm
S0420	these things happen
S0365	yeah when i think back to my school days and the field trip they be pretty dangerous
S0420	yeah
S0365	we grow up in essex i don't think our teachers know what a hill be and
S0420	they'd almost sort of encourage you to be a bite like yeah yeah go on run up that one go on
S0365	yeah
S0420	tire you out
S0365	yeah
S0420	sort of school trip
S0366	aye mm
S0420	then i'd have to volunteer to help out with the
S0366	mm mm that'd be quite fun actually
S0420	feel free
