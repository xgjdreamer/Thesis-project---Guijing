S0148	yeah what's the job
S0167	it's in it's call and it's a film tv and literary agency
S0148	wow
S0167	it's only a six month job
S0148	how do you get that then
S0167	well when before i go to uni i write letter to load and load of publish company and most of them email me back with load of rejections and there be a few really positive ones where i do work experience so what i do be the other month i email them all again cos i still have all their email and i email them all again and i say i do my work experience with them and here's my cv and i've since be to uni and do all this and blah blah if there's any opportunities please let me know and this girl email me back say yes we're look to fill an internship from kind of the new year if you're available and we'll have a look at your cv and say if you're suitable and a few days later she email me back and say yes we'd like to see you

S0149	wow
S0167	but i don't know how many people
S0148	what job would it be in the company do you have any idea
S0167	i think it's like agency for the literary department so i'm not sure exactly what i'll be do
S0148	the dream
S0167	yeah
S0149	get a job and then move to london
S0148	and then you're like you can't move to germany you're go to have to move here
S0167	yeah well he know i'm look for job in london anyway so i'm hop he'll just break and just come and he do say to me the other day and just come and he do say to me the other day on skype if only i could give everything up to come to london with you and i be like mm that's a promise sign and i be like yeah that would be lovely
S0148	can he make the family business go bust
S0167	oh nightmare
S0148	he could extend it it could be international it could be the same company but in london i mean how long be it to get there from here what's the flight
S0167	it's like an hour and a half
S0149	that's good and once you've do all your travel in between what do that equate to like how far be he from the airport
S0167	well if i fly to berlin it's two hours from the airport if i fly to leipzig if i fly to dresden it's like half an hour like i would never consider fly to dresden erm leipzig be about two hours the opposite direction and he's pick me up form leipzig when i go in january and we're go to go to his sister who live in switzerland and stay there for a few days well two days
S0149	you're like live the dream

S0148	yeah they do that they start skate across
S0167	and i be like oh my god i can't stop and i move a tiny bite and fortunately i hit the teacher and not any of the kid and i bash my head and i have a headache for the whole day and i bash my head on the snow but fortunately i didn't take out any four year olds

S0167	if i don't accept it and don't get the job then i haven't get
S0149	can you accept it and then if you get the job
S0167	i could yeah i could but i don't want to get a reputation for bad and then they might not offer me any more work cos it be quite good to do it on saturdays and stuff when you're free
S0149	but if you get a job then you won't need any more work
S0167	yeah true i won't enjoy it though i might want to carry on do it i might want to do if i can well obviously if i have a job it might be difficult but i really enjoy do but yeah you're right i probably won't need it as much if i get this job but i didn't think i'll accept festival until i've get this interview until i've have this interview yeah i do yesterday so i've be try to earn money in bits and piece where i can but i want something permanent but all this money i don't get realise until the end of the month anyway so this month i've have to be
S0149	mine's be shit cos they've pay on the twenty third december do they do that with you
S0167	yeah
S0149	it's really annoy
S0167	i hate it when that happen
S0149	that dent i make in the car
S0148	where do you make that
S0149	i make it in october i be so good at keep it a secret from my parent
S0167	why be it your car or theirs
S0149	it's theirs and all the time i keep it quiet and i be like i keep it quiet all the time i make them park it somewhere and then walk round to my house everything literally and then at christmas oh i'm go to wash the cars and i be like oh no i'll do mine
S0167	very stressful for you have that
S0149	and i be like i know it be and i say i be like no seriously i be like you know give me that car you know i'm pay it off
S0148	i'll wash it
S0149	i must do it and then dad the next morning before i wake up be like how do you do the dent why don't i know about it and i learn from my mistake i very much do and i be like in my head hide the dent but dad be like that be so stupid because you can't claim for it on the insurance now because you have to claim in two weeks
S0148	not that you'd want to either you wouldn't want to claim against that
S0167	it's probably cheaper to get it
S0149	nightmare the mechanics and i've now i've pay dad off and the insurance be a nightmare with my point
S0167	you've get point
S0148	why have you get point
S0149	speed i'm sure i tell you that age ago and then we send it to the mechanic and we're still wait for them to do work on it cos the excess and the insurance be five hundred pound and i don't want anyone else the insurers to know if it's under five hundred fine just go to sort it out myself even if it's six hundred i will pay and the man be initially no it's fine we'll bash it out and then he look at it again and actually the alignment's really not great and he be like turn on your headlights and so i turn them on and cos it be slightly bash one of them on the brick wall be like here the other one be here it's like it's definitely not right so i haven't tell dad that yet
S0167	oh no
S0149	so i haven't tell dad that yet oh it's a nightmare and i couldn't go on the driver awareness course because i be too much over the limit which i think be really wrong because
S0148	course
S0149	you should have to go on the course and get point but no no
S0148	you're the one that need it
S0149	so you just have to have the point
S0167	there's always something with cars
S0149	dad say to me there's no point buy a new car cos a new driver drive out of the forecourt lose value something crazy like it lose two and a half grand just by drive out of the car park so that be a bite of a nightmare before christmas
S0148	my engine light come on again do i tell you about the engine light
S0167	you're not in the clio any more
S0149	yeah

S0149	a lot of them don't have film in
S0167	yeah i'm hop that hasn't happen it's bad enough them catch me speed but it's also bad if it's the day i get tax the next day but that be the day that i be speed
S0149	oh so annoy
S0167	i'm always so careful with it cos i know where the speed cameras so i always go down to thirty
S0148	and i'm pretty sure i've be in the car with you when you're drive slowly anyway
S0167	yeah and i'm not a speeder i'm just drive yeah i'm always so careful i always find when it's something when i'm sing along think yeah so when i be come back from i be do like seventy on the motorway i be like i can't be catch just go really slowly
S0149	what be the speed limit on the motorway
S0167	seventy but it's
S0148	overtake you always go beyond i'm always about seventy five
S0167	no i be do seventy nobody get ticket on the motorway they're fine but there be a variable sixty so i go right down to sixty and i think other cars be go faster but erm but cos it be dark at this time there be a huge flash and i think oh my god i hope it isn't me they're flash i be like i be do sixty and i be like oh my god maybe it be fifty and i read it wrong
S0149	if there be cars go along faster than you
S0167	yeah so it be flash another car maybe cos i be like oh my god if i get catch twice for speed in two days then that's not good news i'm so careful i've never have any point in my life or anything
S0149	who doesn't
S0167	i can't afford to pay fin right now
S0149	neither can i
S0167	i get pay we get pay a day less we get pay on twenty first twenty third we have to close our account down so we get pay three hundred and fifty dollars so i have that to bring home for me and it be only like a hundred and fifty pound or something and so i've have to last me this month which be mostly like go and
S0167	yeah oh wow do well then
S0149	well i suppose you're back with your parent you're not pay rent
S0167	well i didn't have to pay rent in peru because it be provide with our internship and when we work it out we be work ten hours a day five days a week so we be work fifty hours a week and i be get two hundred pound the equivalent of get pay in dollars but they couldn't so it work out i be be pay a pound an hour but then we have get we have our flat provide and we get health insurance with that that we do actually end up use
S0149	why what be wrong
S0167	erm i think must have use i wake up one day and i be be sick and i couldn't go into work and then i erm i think i get a bug and then the next day i have diarrhoea and it have blood in it
S0149	oh
S0167	and i think maybe and anyway this happen for a whole day and i get to the point where there be nothing to come out either end but it be still try to come out and really painful so i ring my mum and she be like maybe go to the hospital so i go to the hospital and i go into the doctor's and it sound like you've get cos here we have bacteria in food that we sometimes get and it sound like you've get a bacterial infection so i'll give you antibiotics and if it get worse just come back the next week so i take the antibiotics and it clear up so it must have be an infection erm but yeah so i use that but they pay not for the doctor so i have to pay to go to the doctor and to have to pay fifty sole which be only about ten pound and then i have to pay for my antibiotics which be like twenty sole which be only like four pound which i guess isn't that much but seventy sole be in peru it go a lot further than it do in england cos everything's a lot cheaper so it be like oh god
S0149	it's like that all over america and obviously you pay you can't afford it you just want to be do with it
S0167	it would have be so much more expensive cos that be only ten percent with my health insurance that be only ten percent of what the actual cost be so i be like oh my god i wouldn't of be able to pay that if i didn't have my insurance always worth get insurance if your dog have insurance
S0148	oh but they cost a fortune too
S0167	yeah and my parent do that they have eight hundred pound for my cat's paw to have like a skin graft
S0148	how much
S0167	eight hundred pound my dog be really ill bless him i wake up on monday my parent be at work and i be home and i think where be he and he be on my mum and dad's bed be sick all over their bed
S0148	oh no
S0167	i think maybe he's just eat something anyway he carry on be sick the rest of the day and he wouldn't eat anything and he be sick all of the next day so we take him to the vet's and it turn out he have get something so they keep him in the vet and he be in there like ten minutes and drink that much from the consultation have his blood scan
S0148	oh my god
S0167	and then he be in the vet's for the next two days and then he be in the hospital and he be in the hospital now it must be easily over now
