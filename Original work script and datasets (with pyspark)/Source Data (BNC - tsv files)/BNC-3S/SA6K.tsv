S0262	yeah
S0301	that we we be culturally all europeans
S0262	yeah
S0301	you know the fact that he could play that on the piano and she could sing it
S0262	yeah
S0301	be the same piece of classical music
S0262	do you know what it be
S0301	no i don't actually know what it be a er i think it be probably something by schumann but i but i couldn't actually quite place it
S0262	yeah
S0301	but but it
S0262	how much it kind of really mean something to her as well it be just you know incredible
S0301	well to him you know he be say you know sort through the music and say oh gosh you know erm this this this this bring me back to
S0262	yeah i can play this one yeah yeah
S0301	and it and you know and and here they be erm absolutely swear dreadful enemies but but share the same culture it be that be the last sort of bizarre thing i suppose about fight the germans
S0262	yeah
S0301	it it would be i suppose even
S0262	oh look at that
S0301	erm i mean even closer in the case of the british because we're geographically closer to them
S0262	yeah yeah i know what you mean i mean i mean i think that be quite a poignant part of the film erm yeah it be er definitely the sort of more human side
S0301	yes
S0262	but erm my god eight weeks in the army and that be it you know
S0301	yeah and i don't i don't think that would have i don't think that that would would have happen but apart from anything else be take be take bloody you know a week to get across the atlantic for starters
S0262	yeah
S0301	and another week to get out into into europe wherever they be virtually into into germany and
S0262	yeah
S0262	that bit's a little bite farfetched
S0301	yeah
S0262	but make for a good story though i suppose in a way it's an analogy isn't it it's like you're fresh off the boat whether you've have train or not you know and you're try to get into a an already very form erm bond
S0304	tight knit group
S0301	yeah
S0262	yes yes
S0304	kind of like a family
S0262	yes yeah
S0301	yeah and nothing be more tight knit than a tank crew
S0262	but in a way i didn't think they be really really nasty to him
S0304	what
S0262	in in a sense it be kind of well portray it be that you know level of kind of nastiness and things like that doesn't really come into it it be kind of like you need to understand you need to kill people
S0304	cos our live and everybody else's depend on it
S0262	cos yeah exactly
S0301	absolutely yeah
S0304	that's you know bits that dad's sort of mention go with it as you know part of your train you know we're all civilians we're all teach that you know thou shalt not kill and if you do you go to jail for plenty of years
S0262	yeah
S0304	and you know it's not a natural thing for people to do and if you be go to do it you need a bite of train to get you there
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	or it would be at least and not just kill people but when the shit go down so to speak once you know the the fire's on
S0262	or you would have think
S0304	you're fuck terrify you're scar witless
S0262	yeah
S0304	and that's the bite where your train just you know don't even think about what you're do you just do your train
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	that kind of help you get through it
S0304	yeah just become the the all all you know get into it that will kind of get you through as well as
S0262	mm
S0304	you know trust the people be a bite more wise or more experience than you you can't what possibly might be go on
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	he didn't have any of that
S0262	no pretty good job actually consider
S0304	i mean the fact that i be actually quite impress be without any train he know how to load and unload thirty calibre machine gun in front of him
S0301	yeah well i suppose they sort of show him maybe
S0304	yeah
S0301	the way they show him how to use the grease gun as it's call like submachine gun erm
S0304	yeah
S0262	mm
S0301	the touch i like be that brad pitt have this capture german erm rifle which be the first of the assault rifle that the germans invent i mean everybody postwar you know the grandson of it be the sa eighty and the m sixteen er and they be prize you know if you could get one they they be they be worth have and he obviously have get one from somewhere
S0262	mm
S0304	i'm sorry can we can i with the sort of lids yeah throw them over here and i'll put them in a bag and then put it back on the floor
S0262	mm
S0301	yes yeah that's
S0262	mm
S0301	you must you need some
S0304	little bite of kind of a third of each people's rice
S0301	right
S0262	mm
S0301	yeah i'd be interest to know exactly where it be in the english midlands that that all take place
S0262	yeah i'm try to think of i haven't hear of a massive film studio there
S0304	it's it's not really a studio
S0262	oh really it's more like a land
S0304	it's it's it's just an area of little land that they film to do all the band of brothers stuff
S0262	mm
S0301	they shut off
S0304	so you know they make up set yeah
S0262	so the towns stuff would've be do you know in a studio
S0304	then private ryan because it be tom hanks again come again erm
S0262	mm
S0304	and then you know they use it so all those things like all the uniform all the it's all be make i've see there be a picture of it in the sunday time around a couple of months ago
S0262	mm
S0304	of the armoury of all this fake kind of stuff that they have leave over
S0262	mm mm
S0304	which you know people be use all around the globe to make sort of movies
S0262	mm
S0304	so they're constantly it out
S0304	you know even as much as peep show do a bite there's one of the episodes where
S0262	mm
S0304	you know fat guy john mitchell go out with a guy who who find out that he's actually a racist it's they be go to so even they a little show like peep show use bits of the material
S0262	mm yeah yeah
S0304	and all the re enactment stuff you know when you see a bite of history they tell the story on on discovery and then they have real people sort of walk around with stuff almost to sort of highlight the point they will pay for it
S0262	yeah
S0301	mm
S0304	so whoever's make all this stuff
S0262	it's a costume department each warehouse
S0304	yeah so star war cos that doesn't get use
S0262	mm
S0301	no
S0304	stormtrooper not a great deal of call but if you've get a whole load of you know sort of military outfit or gi and for the german army and the ss and some equipment and
S0262	mm have you hear of the tv programme the children's tv programme which be like live erm history erm sort of children erm
S0304	you talk about the horrible histories
S0262	horrible histories 's uncle produce that and erm or he have direct episodes of it erm and you're right and you know you look at the little segment of history that they do within one episode i actually quite enjoy watch it
S0304	i think it's much as for adults as it be for kid
S0262	yeah
S0304	i think it's hilarious
S0262	but they like talk about costume it's like right just for about two minutes they've go to re enactment of they've go to such an extent of you know erm really try to make it as authentic as possible you know in the sense of but i mean they really try
S0304	yeah
S0262	and i and i could see you know the same costume wise they just bowl up to this lot and go can we have this that and the other and they go yeah sure you can we've get it we've get it in stack you know in shitloads so but horrible histories be great i think you're right it be just as much for adults have you see it dad
S0301	no i haven't
S0304	all the book as well
S0262	about half an hour mm
S0304	it's massive it's a massive phenomenon now
S0262	mm
S0301	but there there be cabinets who be very large who specialise in this
S0262	yeah
S0301	erm i go to a talk once by a guy who be the the cameraman erm for who be the guy erm paths of glory
S0262	yeah
S0304	kubrick
S0301	kubrick stanley kubrick
S0262	i love i love that film
S0304	over money wasn't it
S0301	yeah well no it be about work condition
S0304	oh right
S0301	kubrick be a monster
S0262	mm but boy do he make good film
S0301	yeah but but but one of the things this guy guy also do be he organise the battle scenes for the charge of the light brigade

S0301	and he get the turkish army to provide lot of guy who could ride horse
S0304	you mean all the extras
S0301	yeah the extras and he be able to outfit them all in the in the british uniform because there be no no special effect
S0262	mm
S0301	you know
S0262	mm
S0301	there be a cavalry regiment of four hundred guy or four hundred horse
S0262	just as be yeah yeah and that's what's really impressive
S0301	and they be all dress in the in the right uniform
S0262	yeah all charge
S0301	and he be tell us all charge and he say i be able to go to this firm in london
S0262	mm and get everyone

S0262	none of this cgi business every single bloody extra have to have a you know uniform costume yeah
S0301	no well
S0262	and a and a horse yeah be amaze
S0304	well better
S0262	mm oh it's good
S0304	you know that book you be touch the horrible histories if you get a chance to see one
S0301	mm
S0304	we'll record one
S0262	it's very well do
S0301	they're good be they
S0262	oh they're really
S0301	yeah cos they're incredibly well write
S0262	mm
S0301	but they're they're actually act by you know name adult comedian or or proper straight actors erm blend of who you know forget it's a kids' show do a proper job
S0262	no it's very well do
S0304	and and if they call all the sort of you know horrible histories you can sort of hear it you know what happen to you in well what be the plague like or you know if you be the two princes in the tower what would life have be like
S0301	mm
S0304	if you be well if you be in a trench what would it
S0262	yeah but it's not just one theme throughout the episode it's actually cut up to
S0301	mm
S0304	beautifully yeah no oh
S0262	you know right we'll jump from the romans you know julius caesar then we'll do a bite of world war two then we'll go so it's it's never bore for the kid because they're just pick up i guess bits of information but then they'll reinforce it
S0304	it's a study aid you're not go to be able to pass an a level off the back of it
S0262	yeah you're not no but it's enough to get you interest in history i think and you go to a lecture didn't you about how to teach well the curriculum be about how to include history in
S0301	yeah since last monday it be part of the festival ideas and erm it around about it be chair by a fella call who be a historian who's write who's write extensively about the the third reich in fact but what they be they what they be talk about and he have a panel he have erm he have a woman who be a who have teach history in a secondary modern in in london for about fifteen years be really quite leave and very much anti michael goves unlike who's quite pro michael she tell me
S0262	now see michael goves who's he
S0301	michael goves
S0262	goves yeah who's
S0304	gove
S0262	gove
S0301	he he be the secretary of state for education
S0262	he be
S0304	yeah but he become so contentious that these erm all party have do this now apart from the erm ukip they've all hire all the experts from the state who've get various people elect so bush's campaign manager
S0262	ukip what's ukip
S0304	the the nigel farage fascist party
S0262	party oh right okay right
S0304	so the lib dems conservative labour proponents of obama or bush all they've all hire have you ever see the west wing
S0262	mm
S0304	you know the guy who get people elect and
S0262	mm mm hm
S0304	they don't just do presidents they do senators and cos there's lot of elections and those experts
S0262	okay mm hm
S0304	how divisive gove be and turn round to cameron and say with him you just can't win an election which i i i be i be kind of with on this i sort of think that he be give almost back to this be the way school should be teach it should be interest but it should be number it shouldn't be all the airy fairy every kid be kind of right you're make a contribution even if you're a thick idiot well play for turn up and spell
S0262	so he be really out on his own then on that one
S0304	he use teachers and people start hammer him
S0262	yeah
S0304	in the same way who anyone who touch the nhs will get a nurse and a doctor and a midwife have have a moan
S0262	yeah
S0304	most parent though generally seem to quite like i like what he be do but erm party secretary he's they have you know
S0262	so
S0304	so he's get sort of he get a sort he's get a sort of important job but not the he's not the secretary of
S0262	but not really in in the thick of it so to speak yeah
S0304	which be well i i think it be a bite of a cowardice act i think he should've be allow to continue and i think that should be part of the manifesto of the conservatives
S0262	so be that cameron's decision to shift him aside
S0304	ultimately yeah
S0301	mm yes
S0262	okay because he be get so much flak
S0301	but i mean he be he be be tell that this guy be a liability as well that's basically why
S0304	oh
S0262	all because of what he be say about education or other things too
S0301	history
S0262	god
S0301	and the teach of history
S0262	and this actually have such a a negative effect just go to show how political education be isn't it
S0301	yeah absolutely no absolutely that's absolutely right
S0262	so anyway he's not but that that you be say about the lecture that he be actually
S0301	well it be more of a discussion actually
S0262	debate yeah
S0301	they also have a conservative mp who be conservative mp for part of and he'd read history at so he have a sort of conservative slant on them but i guy who actually know what he be talk about cos he'd read history at sort of thing erm
S0304	so when parent be talk to you about their school and their issue and stuff they kind of know what they're talk about cos they've get a bite of personal experience
S0262	mm
S0304	then i'm quite good at history i go to
S0262	though when he go to school it's quite a long time ago
S0301	but my ah be also out of luck with with goves because he say what you're actually try to do why do you do history what's the aim of study history so the aim of study history be be be to teach analysis that's actually what it's all about and i the problems that i have about goves be he he didn't teach analysis he he he want
S0262	want facts
S0301	he want to be base entirely on the facts
S0262	yeah the
S0304	but but again i think that's slightly disingenuous because i i i agree with you
S0301	well with him i'm only repeat what he say
S0304	no no but i but i think what gove be try to do be but if you don't have then again i i look at philosophy philosophy you still have to go out and get a job and pay a mortgage and stuff unless you want to be a philosopher
S0301	mm
S0304	but again it's a bite like law people that do law don't necessarily go into law it's about analysis
S0262	mm
S0304	but unless you know the basics
S0262	yeah
S0304	you can't perform analysis
S0301	no
S0304	so what he be what gove be try to say be up until a certain point you need to know the facts and then as you start get into maybe sort of thirteen fourteen start go to gcse and on
S0301	no no no he
S0304	then you start lay more analysis and interpretation on it but you can't do that at sort of seven or twelve if you don't know the facts to start with
S0262	i don't
S0301	no you're absolutely right i don't think there's any disagreement about that at all
S0262	yeah
S0301	and that the the the rather leave wing woman who actually teach history she she actually put up you know she say this be typical of what i teach and and it be exactly as per the national curriculum and it be the question be europe erm in nineteen pre the first world war be divide into two arm camp the triple alliance and the erm but i think the question be the comment on how these the interaction between these two arm camp lead to the first world war that's actually quite a difficult and broad question i i be quite impress i think you know cor if you get sort of eh you get kid that be answer that
S0262	this isn't a level history this be actually gcse history
S0301	i think this be g yeah she
S0262	cos that could sound quite tough for gcse
S0301	yeah
S0304	mm
S0301	now i'm not sure if it be a level or whether it be gcse
S0304	i'd say that be gcse
S0262	really
S0304	yeah you've get you've get two to three years to teach people what's the answer to that
S0262	but i think that's the thing that you be say the other night be try to squeeze in what one hour a week be it to
S0301	well she say that this be the real one way if they're real problems i only an hour a week
S0262	i think that might be quite difficult to get your kid to answer that type of question in one hour a week
S0304	bizarrely that would be the sort of thing that gove i think would be try to argue against be you know things like history things like languages you need more time on the syllabus and and less pottery and less this and less
S0301	well
S0262	but apparently the hours that be soak up on curriculum be actually maths still maths and well more so maths and english just to try to get them to literacy rate numeracy and you know an academic literacy
S0304	see that's that's one of the things i've always find slightly funny about the argument be but isn't part of your job as a teacher to make sure that they've already get that
S0262	yeah yeah well you have to develop it that's right and you can develop it in other subject
S0304	be be be we have to concentrate on otherwise we'd miss all the target and figure isn't isn't hang on a sec maybe we need to be better at deliver this so that we can still do four hours of geography four hours of history six hours of another language with french
S0262	yeah well can't can't couldn't numeracy be teach in geography like work out the g you know the like history you think about the number how many people die
S0304	ah i
S0262	so how many you know people be leave and think about you know academic history you still have to write an essay answer to your to your exam question you can do that in history you can do that in geography
S0304	i think it's absolutely fascinate
S0262	you can do that in any subject
S0304	turn around and go i don't actually understand why we teach subject why aren't they things why isn't this all holistic
S0262	yeah why don't we just develop analytics
S0304	yeah but bits of french bits of german bits of bits of everything should be work out in pillars and you should be teach across them so you get the skills across all them
S0262	or you know develop creativity yeah
S0304	you wouldn't just need a geography lesson
S0262	mm
S0304	when you see geography in isolation and not realise oh there's bits of trigonometry that we do here
S0262	mm mm
S0304	will actually help when you do a survey for oh
S0262	yeah well you're right in french say and then you could ask them right so think about how much be it do it sound like in french and then work out the number and then try and give give an answer so you at least know what you're get back in your euros or whatever it be
S0304	you could be try bits of
S0262	yeah
S0304	do you remember the eddie izzard routine i'm sure i show both of you where you know he know certain bits he learn at school like he know he know he know
S0262	laugh
S0304	and he's go how do i chat a french girl up unless literally the cheeky monkey be on a bicycle and he's go round he's now
S0262	mm
S0304	ah
S0262	he's he's get it in one
S0304	yeah you teach a bite of maybe you teach a bite of the war and and how do they make stuff with jam and how do they come up with the uniform and do the fake pass
S0262	yeah
S0304	and what french german would you need to try and get home again make the whole thing but link it
S0262	but even just put a timescale on it you know history put it on a continuum do you know what fifty years ago look like and they'd all sit there go no
S0304	so kid go what french would i use to get home and not give myself away
S0262	right let's go back ten years twenty thirty just to even have a sense of what those timescales mean in time and that include your work out and things like what be the population size of the uk twenty years ago how much be it in fifty years can you give me the number
S0304	show them certain
S0262	you know it's like it's not rocket science really but they can't seem to get away as you say from the subject base curriculum
S0304	and also it's it's very it's very wordy erm lucky enough and then dad get to hear me unfortunately on a friday night once or twice bang on about we have the we have government contract at we manage to get the the erm the education guy to give us a course that we could get involve and
S0262	mm mm
S0304	and you spend a bite of time with the teachers every and then again look i'll i'll that picture paint a thousand word
S0304	and i know how my presentations work when i look at other people and mine's mostly image and i do all the talk
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	cos that's where they go they'll see the image and go away and then end up be oh yeah i get what 's paint picture for me
S0262	mm
S0304	some people will go away and it's like fifty bullet point and you get a hundred slide
S0262	yeah yeah
S0301	death by
S0304	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0304	but but there's bite of teachers stand up and they're all they talk a lot or it's read the book
S0262	mm
S0304	more visuals i mean you mention earlier
S0262	mm
S0304	you know where be we be have that conversation
S0262	mm
S0304	i like people you know that's the rally call when they be out hunt cos that be the they go from hampton court to go hunt forest it be woodland stag what
S0262	mm mm mm mm wouldn't that be nice to know if you if you're a kid and you're walk down oxford street and you go ah actually i can pictorially think about this as a different landscape
S0304	i i think people sort of paint it and then turn london back through the age do you remember erm dad would definitely have see this erm
S0262	yeah
S0304	it be probably the first kind of interest version of orson wells's time machine
S0262	mm
S0304	where he sort of sit in it and i mean it's quite a colour it's about the sixties and he press the lever and do the little dial and you see him kind of zoom through london
S0301	mm
S0262	mm yeah yeah sort of whiz by yeah
S0304	and all the factories and the windows and everything change i've see a version of that take it through london all the way back to soho and and people hunt
S0301	mm
S0304	but again almost half an hour of that be stand up do hour upon hour of teachers go this be soho it be woods
S0262	mm mm mm mm
S0304	and kid sit there go i don't know if i've ever see a wood i i'm an inner city birmingham kid
S0262	mm mm
S0304	what's a wood and what's a wood in london
S0262	yeah
S0301	yeah
S0304	hunt well what's what's that
S0262	yeah
S0301	mm
S0304	how do you hunt a stag why would you hunt you know it's it's too many word it's not enough image that's actually how the brain work
S0262	mm
S0301	mm
S0262	but then the literacy there be that you know i suppose erm it's really hard because they really do you have to use word to write their exam you know they can't paint a picture to express their understand of
S0304	look in the and even then i quite like the french school but i've see enough french school that do movies everyone sit in you must have do this in class you get shakespeare and go right start read right your turn and everyone just sit there kind of bore read without understand it you're not bring it alive
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	i just think there's a lot of waste time in class of people go through here's here's how we now teach it and kid don't get it
S0262	i completely agree with you
S0301	yeah i'm sure you're right
S0262	so what be the outcome do you think though of the debate be it still sort of open end and
S0304	i i there's no easy answer really be there
S0301	well there's no easy answer i i think well sum it up he say that probably when in his sum up he say probably most people now don't realise that originally the erm the history national curriculum be actually design quite a long time ago over forty years ago
S0262	mm mm
S0301	by a group of experts by a group of historians and erm when it be present it be sign off by maggie thatcher actually in her first erm in her first years of office she didn't like it but she say well you guy be the experts i'll sign it off
S0262	because her subject at school when she be an education it weren't history it be it be geography and home economics
S0304	no chemist
S0301	no no she be a chemist
S0262	be there chemistry
S0301	chemistry and law
S0304	yeah mm
S0262	i remember read about her that you know as a teacher you have like
S0304	do you just say home economics
S0262	as a you know the certificate to teach train she have geography as her main subject if you look down and you drop down to the other subject that she actually have to pass specialism in term of you know i don't know why they do it like that
S0304	mm mm mm
S0262	you you weren't just a geography specialist you have to
S0304	yeah
S0262	you can see it but i think as well that she be she be chemistry but she have she have these other things
S0304	i feel kind of sexist she have to have home economics blokes have to have home economics
S0262	that she have to do as well
S0304	right
S0262	so chemistry be her great passion i think but you're right she be a
S0301	mm
S0262	chemistry teacher
S0301	and yeah well she be oh no she wasn't she never she never do chemistry no maggie never teach chemistry
S0304	she never teach straight into politics
S0301	she well no she she work as a chemist she work in no as a chemist yeah
S0301	she work in you know
S0304	ici or something be it
S0301	yeah she work on on the flavour of ice cream be what she actually work on
S0304	oh my god every time you eat vanilla or chocolate ice cream or neapolitan that's maggie
S0301	mm
S0262	but but i mean though she put something i read that she really get through to the you know teachers' unions and what not about we have to do this differently i remember that she have a great argument for i'm just try to think of what it be now maybe it be bring in a wider curriculum but anyway what be the point that you be say that she didn't like about history
S0301	erm that that you know erm what what so what what say be he say that this be actually an attack on on something that we've have for a very long time and basically be quite satisfy with erm and you know and and goves in he say in his view pick us not because he want to pick on the teachers or anything or pick on history establishment goves pick this because it be all about establish his position within the conservative party
S0262	mm
S0301	erm on the right wing of the conservative party he say that that be his take on the whole business and in the end he say yes we've make some change and there's nothing wrong with change but basically it's the status quo we we we actually he say common sense win we we win and there haven't be that many change and we're all pretty well happy with it apart from the woman who say i i can i can fit the curriculum in an hour a week and i think we all believe her actually
S0262	yeah but you know the thing i'll come back round to again be that the examine board erm teachers can choose which exams their students can take
S0301	yeah which which which board they take
S0262	so actually so which be a syllabus it's not a curriculum it's a syllabus
S0304	which they use for their examination
S0301	yeah yeah
S0304	i always use to wonder
S0262	so for example at gcse level i never learn about world war one and world war two anything like that i learn all about the tudors lancashire yorkshire you know war of the roses and a shitload about the suffragettes
S0301	yeah cos girls would be interest in suffragettes
S0262	presumably
S0301	what what they would
S0262	but i actually wasn't
S0301	oh dear
S0262	erm so i would have prefer to have have more of a world view of history
S0301	mm
S0262	cos when you're talk to people when you're travel yeah you can talk about suffragettes but not every person in the country know what i'm talk about so yeah if they talk about world war one world war two we would basically have some kind of you know conversation about something or you know any kind of war would be kind of useful we just didn't do war just girls ancient war
S0304	do ancient war war of the roses romantic war
S0301	yeah well i i
S0262	and love in term of the tudors and you know the stuarts and oh my god the the ins and out of who be sleep with who and blah blah blah you know it's like right great thank you that's real useful
S0301	yeah but what would argue you see that that doesn't make any difference that really if what you're teach be analysis erm there's no reason why you can't learn analysis from whatever particular era eh period you're do erm
S0304	you see and i might suddenly disagree that the bigger the fee the bigger the you're talk about
S0262	yeah it help yeah
S0304	the deeper the grey cells have to work
S0301	well that's
S0304	because i have a certain argument about brain circuitry
S0301	yeah
S0304	i don't believe in god or anything i believe it's all brain chemicals
S0301	yeah
S0304	so it take to to the harder you go the more brain cells you're make which mean in life kind of the smarter not more intelligent but the smarter you be if you're only look at something that's kind of two dimensional versus twelve
S0301	yes
S0304	it's like okay well can you play chess well that's one thing can you do a rubik's cube okay can you do a six side rubik's cube
S0262	mm mm
S0301	anyone want any more beer
S0262	yeah i'll have a beer thank
S0304	alright
S0262	but the as you say the suffragettes you know vis a vis like a world war like complexities of that you're right because students who normally kid be quite curious eh when they're they need to have it break up but at least there's something big enough to be curious about so if they're not really interest in that bite they might be interest in the politics of war they might be interest in the kind of like the actual strategic part of war least it's big enough for somebody to attach a little bite of interest and curiosity to whereas i find that history for me be quite slice and up already it be like you can only really move between this bite and that bite and i be like well if not actually interest in that bite it's not make it excite for me i'm not curious enough to ask any more question i now know that i know i just have to copy and just write what i see on the board that's not analytical that's just how good you be at memorise things and i'm actually not too good at that anyway so they didn't actually teach me that skill so it didn't really work you know and i just think that be quite a shame really consider how much money you be pay for that education
S0304	thank you
S0301	as well
S0262	yeah
S0301	yeah
S0304	i mean actually the bite you you raise i remember be at and it be a smallish conversation
S0262	thank you
S0304	erm but i always use to wonder why parent don't get more interest in it be be cos we be a public school but you have to do you have to do the and
S0262	mm
S0304	board
S0262	mm
S0304	which everyone kind of know be as in fact everyone sort of use to talk about well can't we do the aeael the ally and of london associate and and whatever it be board cos everyone seem to be able to get an a in that
S0262	that's the easy one
S0304	and it be like all the thickos you know who didn't get into your school who go to a you know you be at prep school with them
S0262	mm or something yeah
S0304	and of all the thickos that didn't get into your school all get as i'm like
S0262	yeah
S0304	but no one apart from no one at work or unis or anyone seem to mark this back where there's different school
S0262	mm no
S0304	so if you do the hard one and you get a c that equal twelve point if you do an easy one and get an a actually that's still only ten it doesn't become a point score system
S0262	no it doesn't it doesn't
S0304	so no one in your twenties and thirties be go to fuck argue the toss
S0262	apart from yeah but be only to get into or it's not to get into any other university
S0304	but you know
S0262	that's get high sort of you know
S0304	if you pay all this money why why pay to just do as in be why pay give me the easiest ones cos i want my son at the best uni i can get him in
S0301	mm
S0304	or daughter never understand it
S0262	but there's like other courtesies like
S0304	all the parent hang on a sec don't make them do the harder one make them do the most successful one
S0262	so many countries that do that do do national exams every like china i'll just give an example
S0304	there shouldn't be a different
S0262	and there's what there's how many thousands of children a year
S0304	yeah
S0262	suppose they do it out of administration because they couldn't actually go oh look and you blah blah and duh duh duh will add all these different you know syllabi all across the anyway we have to know who's good we actually have to know who be the top five percent go through into their universities who be the top ten percent it's it's strategic in a way because at least you actually really know you set it as a national examination we should bloody well know if they get into a chinese university they be good and you can put a lot of work onto them cos you know they're good whereas you can't necessarily put a lot of work onto students at in in universities in the uk you really don't know whether they're go to cope you can't actually just land it on their head intellectually achieve you know
S0304	the one thing that become really interest with with universities be and and again that you know if can we break all the rule what could you do one universities be once you go to one it's fix
S0262	mm
S0304	so say for example
S0262	yeah
S0304	and this be what the arguments for syllabus be
S0262	yeah
S0304	say you don't go to when you're do your course and you haven't go into or well then there there's a certain argument whether people be mature mature let alone intellectual in the way their brain but mature at different level
S0301	mm mm
S0304	you know everything's get to be set by eighteen which be kind of ridiculous people go away on gap years do stuff come back read stuff and it's fix
S0262	mm mm
S0304	if you start do a course at there should be a way of of go actually i'm go to fast track you through this
S0262	mm
S0304	and actually you're leave after the first year and go into second year
S0262	mm mm mm
S0304	or someone from sorry who's in the first year hasn't quite cut it be now go to or or
S0262	mm yeah yeah
S0304	there need to be freedom of movement of
S0262	yeah
S0304	to to understand people matriculate mature and grow up and intellectually
S0262	yeah
S0301	can you imagine the academic establishment agree to that
S0262	actually yes in a certain way because if you be work for and you know you be a tier two say you'd send me someone a tier three university but they'd tier three let's say that's a bite lower and you're work at say tier two and you're get the top of the tier three and you're go great i've get something to work with here i can i know what to put on these students to actually get them to where i want them to be you're probably think great i don't have to muck around with all
S0301	with the thickos we'll offload the thickos to forever
S0304	you're not really do that from to but i get where you're come from
S0301	yeah
S0304	but but the other thing that make it interest be you're now pay you know when when when i talk about this everything be kind of free
S0262	right but i would be fast track yeah
S0304	if you're now pay for that degree
S0262	if i be really do very well at university
S0262	yeah
S0304	rather than go to somewhere like where you'll actually have more time and
S0262	yeah
S0301	mm
S0304	and you're pay the nine k and someone else be pay nine k and isn't get something out of cos they should swap with you at for my money i deserve better than this
S0262	yeah
S0304	i need to be look after properly
S0262	yeah
S0304	when it be all free now someone's go well
S0262	it's kind of like it
S0301	it be never free be never free you know free at point of contact yeah
S0304	you're play rugby for so that's it you're stay
S0262	well it well it be kind of like a sport in a way isn't it
S0304	should be like should be like almost a sport there should be transfer market
S0262	yeah yeah base on merit
S0304	base on merit
S0262	which be good not base on money
S0304	yeah or or the time you do an exam
S0262	because that's what it be base on at the moment it's base on money or privilege
S0304	which even then i still think be weird
S0262	yeah
S0304	you're i know you're three years younger than me
S0262	yeah
S0304	but in a sense you're two years
S0262	yeah
S0304	because you're august versus september
S0262	yeah
S0301	mm
S0304	an accident of birth by days
S0262	mm
S0304	you'd be like mum you should have be try to hang on for another twenty eight days
S0262	yeah
S0304	cos it mean different say education wise you know where be you you know most people have already do their exams before you even get to your birthday
S0262	no that that's a very good point yeah yeah
S0304	so there's you know why isn't it calendar year as well
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	why don't you do of people at the top end the first six months and then of people at the second six months
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0304	there's all then again dad's dad's hear me bang on about this here's how i want to change the entire education system
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but no i like the idea of a university thing be that it should be give give more scope for merit base erm achievement
S0304	and growth at different stag
S0262	about academia yeah yeah it should be
S0304	i mean you you do your a level at seventeen
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah also
S0304	you might want to take a gap year you wouldn't go you'd probably someone sit in your class could be almost a year and a half older than you
S0262	and you might like your university like the campus but you might not actually like live in for example so it's not just about base on merit can i achieve to go to or whatever i'd really prefer to go to university cos i quite like the idea of you know go into the hill and have a walk or whatever but the idea be that geographical movement and mobility be part of the landscape in europe at least and there's certainly international students know about that because they're come in already as internationalism from china and from vietnam so they already know what it feel like and they might oh i get it wrong i didn't like london i want something smaller but they won't do it because they're lock into the payment scheme it's absolutely you've get to pay up front as an international student
S0301	mm
S0304	transfer too
S0301	and of course we're teach
S0262	and it cost money
S0301	and and and of course you know the universities be earn off these students they don't want to lose them
S0262	but it's not a bad idea because they have so many partnerships within the you know the global marketplace
S0304	then again the people i'm really talk about it's it's affect uk students
S0262	yeah
S0304	not really international students
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0304	erm
S0262	i think yeah i think you're right i think you know
S0304	cos cos the majority have get proper international students who be actually postgrads and you can do that anyway
S0262	yeah
S0304	the majority of undergraduates be uk base
S0262	yeah yeah and that's more likely when you're go to get wrong
S0304	yeah
S0262	as in you choose the wrong course or the wrong location or you just simply don't fit in or your lecturers aren't up to the task
S0304	or you know the only the only you've get that you've get be you know you're very clever but you be a big fish in a small in a small pond
S0262	because you might be very bright you know yeah nobody notice you
S0304	you're get a first at but you maybe want to get two two at
S0262	yeah but they're not challenge you
S0304	but if there be that freedom
S0304	you know in a in in a proper meritocracy then you would thrive otherwise it's go to go oh i've get another two years at i know i'm go to get a first here
S0262	mm yeah
S0301	mm
S0262	so so what you're say be yeah so what you're say be year one of your first year at undergrad you could say right everybody
S0304	so what do you really do to achieve you don't
S0262	yeah you be go to have your normal university exams but we're also go to have a look at the top five percent of that cohort
S0304	yeah we're look statistically across the board
S0262	and we're now go to give people an opportunity to see if they can get into the same degree pathway but at a different institution because that's just get that element to it
S0304	cos in a certain sense if you're all uk and and the scots leave them out because about scottish universities payment systems so you're all in england stroke wales
S0262	mm hm mm
S0304	and you're all pay roughly it's nine k to do or six k to do
S0262	mm
S0304	it's not another money issue
S0262	mm
S0304	and there might be certain people people who go oh but look this guy's go to be an blue can we keep him
S0304	well then there's sport sponsorships there's extra things you can do the problem with the other thing i still find funny and use to be quite good at it and still very good at it again to help all of this where be more of business come into academia to help with this
S0262	wow they be shameless they do fuck all they really don't do anything enough i don't think they really don't do enough
S0304	you know we have weird stuff with and at but there should be more businesses not just a milk round there should be more businesses help get involve and have people do internship and help qualify people
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0301	mm
S0304	you know be this person talented could they
S0301	well i i think it that differ from faculty to faculty
S0304	yeah but it but it shouldn't do there should be a there should be a national way of look at this
S0262	it should do if yeah i agree with you he's
S0304	and sometimes most of the students don't know faculty until they turn up
S0262	yeah they don't even know what the word mean
S0304	they'll go oh shit i get lucky sit in a good seat
S0262	yeah exactly
S0304	you're sit in the shit seat
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0301	certainly the engineer faculty here in university i mean they've get from all over the bloody place
S0262	yeah but then cos you know industry be clamour for their attention
S0301	mm
S0262	but i agree with you like if you're pay nine thousand pound industry have get input into various different universities geographically or sort of strategically or whatever but there be some universities that be just not do anything about industry input they're not partner up enough they're not actually have any effect on the syllabus or the learn
S0301	no
S0262	or the curriculum i should say
S0301	but again i suspect that really would be faculty drive it would surprise me if there be any engineer faculty at any university in the unite kingdom that didn't have a considerable industrial involvement
S0262	well engineer aviation anything scientific you know any industry
S0304	it's it's slightly easier
S0262	but you've get to think about industries in ah hospitality all the different other you know you know that they give yeah
S0304	i i think you'd have very very bright people who do mostly analytical degrees come into advertise
S0262	yeah but financial
S0304	most people don't come in cos they do media they come in cos they do you know i look at as one of my best friends he you know be a at just come to do to do this
S0262	industry yeah
S0301	yeah
S0304	and and there's lot of people like this it's not buy another
S0262	no the acumen
S0301	no
S0304	yeah the amount of kid who come in and go run an account you've get to make this account profitable
S0301	mm
S0304	and we don't just do any work we do the work that make us money cos
S0301	yes
S0304	and then what's that it's it's so oh there's an engineer firm work with the engineer faculty it's not necessary what i mean
S0301	no
S0304	there there should be ways that business and come into all of you all need to learn a bite about business how to run account
S0301	yeah
S0304	you all need to know a bite about you all need to know a bite about human resources if you want to start your own business what do you need to do and how do it work if you want to without have to do an mba to do all of this
S0262	yeah i think i i i think what you're talk about be professional skills yeah
S0304	cos this be skills that all of us whatever business you come into whether you're a law or you all need to
S0262	yeah you do and industry can input into that
S0304	how to look after staff how to
S0262	yeah
S0304	and pool it pool the money pool the talent
S0262	yeah they should they should
S0304	there should be like a little business staff college for students
S0262	mm mm
S0301	erm which the french which the french
S0304	part of your three years make make it three and a half years and part of six months be spend be a part
S0301	yeah
S0262	mm
S0301	which the french have get with
S0262	mm
S0301	erm
S0262	but then you have to actually go to one of those so you kind of know what you're get
S0304	this should be build into your sort of
S0262	yeah i think it's
S0301	yeah
S0262	so erm there's this idea of erm learn as you earn erm sorry earn as you learn so the idea be that you know you're definitely go to have to pay money for your first degree but you can actually go and do as part of your degree no it's well think out normally it's like you know do a bite of first year second year ply it on a bite more and then third year you'll come back into the fold and do exams but the idea be that you'll actually have a portfolio of learn and the industry provide the environment for you to learn and you can actually earn a bite of money so you really might use up all of your holiday it's not just like i'll bum off and go and see if i can find a part time job this be actually no
S0304	mm mm
S0262	you'll you'll really come here to to do your study
S0301	mm
S0262	but in your free time which isn't your free time this be actually part of your curriculum you be gonna go earn some money with this partnership that we've provide for you you'll come back and tell us what you've learn and we'll look at the whole thing of what you've learn we'll take your exams we'll take your portfolio your coursework some odd things and that's a broader sort of picture
S0301	well it be i mean it's a bite it's a bite like that year out you do in
S0262	and it help people to pay their way and you pay your way cos you know i earn what ten thousand pound a year when i be work for
S0304	erasmus
S0301	right
S0262	which be when you be a student
S0301	that's a lot
S0304	plenty
S0262	well well it wasn't bad i mean i eat out pretty much every single night i mean it wasn't top restaurants but i mean this be like new to me i be like cool but yeah you're right that money i could probably really tuck away and save and that could've help me to when i be try to find a job you know say at the end of my degree and i'd have a little bite of cushion
S0301	yeah
S0262	but also i would've make those contact
S0301	yeah yeah
S0262	even if i didn't want to go for work to for exactly that company you always network and you find out who else you could go maybe work for and you could interview with them and they'll sort of say yes or no or i'll give you some practice at interview it's one thing that they really be bad at
S0301	mm
S0262	career advice at universities no one know how to interview it seem like no matter what they try
S0301	because the problem be i suspect people who be revise haven't actually work in industry so
S0262	they're very nice people but they're not right on the edge of it
S0301	yeah
S0262	whereas at least if you're do these kind of like you know the work experience thing in and out of your curriculum they might actually provide that as a one day workshop let's all pretend that you're really go to pretend that you're really go to come and look for a job here now when you graduate let's all pretend or let's do it now
S0304	don't pretend get them to do it
S0262	yeah let's actually see if you can get in or not yeah
S0304	set up set up systems do the do the stuff do the do the psychometric test
S0262	mm
S0304	do this test see how people cope under a bite of stress and a bite of pressure
S0262	but you know lot of kid how to write their cv
S0304	talk to i know you all think you know social media because you all use facebook and twitter
S0301	that that that would surprise me
S0304	but you you you understand now you're a brand
S0262	but it shouldn't be
S0304	so so when you're use don't do it in the way that when i'm when i'm think about hire you for a job i look you up on the web i see you're every photo of the rugby club
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	linkedin be it be how to make yourself private you're a brand
S0262	yeah yeah
S0304	and the stuff you'd necessarily want people who be go to be prospective employers to see
S0304	have a good time but keep it private set it up that so just give people straight that you think you know social media i promise you don't cos as soon as you leave university and you go why don't i get a job dad
S0262	yeah well
S0304	and dad doesn't look at your facebook page cos i don't know i i think you be quite charm and a good young chap
S0301	yeah
S0304	why aren't you get a job ring me up and i'll go 's not get a job because do you want me to send you some link
S0301	yeah
S0262	well i can tell you i can tell you
S0304	that's not suppose to be one at work because every work practice now have a sort of moral code
S0262	yeah
S0304	there's an ethical code you have to buy into it we all do
S0262	yeah yeah yeah but the other thing be they don't know how to write cvs and they actually don't know
S0304	mm i'm not i've see millions of cvs and i'm go to be honest i'm not sure if i know the right cv
S0301	well i do think i think that's that's a problem everybody have but erm
S0262	no but i think it's easier when you're at an
S0304	i can tell you stuff not to do i don't know how to make it brilliant
S0262	a cv when you're actually erm just graduate should be one of the easiest cvs to write
S0304	oh when you're just graduate
S0262	yeah but they don't
S0301	very much to say about
S0262	yeah exactly so it's not that difficult blah blah blah
