S0655	oh right it's call life in a circus
S0653	uhu
S0655	and there's this boy name jamie
S0653	uhu
S0655	and he have really bore parent one be an
S0653	an accountant you think
S0655	yeah an accountant
S0653	uhu
S0655	and the other be like this crazy knitter
S0653	oh yeah crazy knitter yeah
S0654	what be you write
S0655	and
S0653	i'm just make note so that
S0655	the circus
S0653	mm
S0654	can i write note
S0655	like have a space for one
S0653	hang on a minute hang on a minute don't whisper cos we need to hear what you're say so you're say can you write note no you can just sit and listen for the moment
S0653	carry on
S0655	and he and he and there's the circus in town that like offer a space for a new for like three new people two parent and one child
S0653	right
S0655	and because jamie be an only child and doesn't have millions of sisters
S0653	uhu
S0655	or brothers or sisters he think it's a brilliant idea and his parent
S0653	uhu
S0655	erm be secretly in the circus
S0653	yeah but he doesn't know that
S0655	and they're like they hear him they see him practice and hear him practice but they don't stop him cos they think it's a brilliant idea
S0653	but he doesn't know that
S0655	but he doesn't know that
S0653	mm
S0655	and they put a cctv camera in his room
S0653	mm
S0655	to check what how good he's do and then like give him tip secretly
S0653	how well he's do
S0655	yeah
S0653	uhu
S0655	and when he ask the this be like get quite deep into the story
S0653	mm
S0655	and he ask his mum to knit him some juggle ball
S0653	cos he cos she knit everything doesn't she
S0655	yeah
S0653	uhu
S0655	er
S0653	that's a good idea
S0655	and then she knit load of like amaze look juggle ball and he's like these aren't sad
S0655	and then he's amaze and practice with do like all the time he can get
S0653	uhu
S0655	at school when he's suppose to be read toilet he do try to do he do he try once to do while wash his hand but all but he realise that his hand need to be a bite dry
S0653	yeah
S0655	to do it bed he always have dream about juggle
S0653	uhu
S0655	and he get the part and his parent disguise as other people and and disguise himself as other parent other people and then they so they they be previously in that particularly particular circus
S0653	mm
S0655	so they could take the part and then jamie be a bite sad that his sad that his parent couldn't get in
S0653	the parent
S0655	but
S0653	which parent couldn't get in
S0655	his parent he didn't know they have disguise themselves as other people
S0653	oh i see okay
S0655	cos cos she actually some clothe and didn't knit some and they be quite flashy actually cos she be really rich in secret
S0653	mm
S0655	apparently her knitting's worth millions
S0653	that would be cool
S0654	even though some bits of it it's just
S0655	and then
S0653	some bits of it be sad
S0655	and
S0654	yeah
S0653	uhu
S0655	not and then there like this child in the circus
S0653	uhu
S0655	name elizabeth and she really really hat it she hat be in the circus she doesn't even get to perform
S0653	mm
S0655	so she just want a normal life where like she can practice all the time erm a place where there's lot of space and if she fall off like a trapeze or something it'll be a soft land mm something like a knit carpet maybe
S0653	uhu
S0655	and then jamie hear about that and then amaze and er if the parent tell him that who they actually be and then he's he's half amaze half really really annoy
S0655	that they have to that his dad have to become an accountant and his mum have to be a crazy knitter
S0655	but then the girl want to buy their house for like half a for about one and a half million pound
S0653	a little girl
S0655	well not the little girl but a girl want to like like
S0653	have she get that money
S0655	it's a rich circus
S0653	mm okay
S0654	but i've
S0655	and then
S0653	hang on have get a question
S0654	wait hold on hold on why be you do mum's idea when you should be do your idea cos mum can write her own about it
S0653	we well
S0655	we just
S0653	it's a collaboration we're 's get the initial idea and then i just well which bite be my idea
S0654	the bite where the girl
S0653	oh the circus girl want to have the life yeah
S0654	join the circus and the and i just really like 's and i really want him to do it by himself and i want you to write your own story cos i don't think they should be together
S0653	well it's
S0654	cos they don't really make sense if the girl leave then his parent will switch over then his parent be like
S0653	no they're gonna have like
S0655	oh but
S0654	obviously run away with the circus and
S0653	no no no they're gonna have half their
S0654	and go on their own
S0653	half their life in a circus half their life in normal life
S0655	yeah and then like run off with the circus and then there's like
S0654	what about his parent
S0655	they run off too and need
S0653	they don't have to run off to the circus they can just join the circus officially can't they
S0655	yeah they join the circus officially they do be the same thing for a while until now and then like the girl and her two parent who find who secretly find the circus very bore but think she find it very interest and she think they find it very interest
S0655	and then they and then they don't find it interest because she can't do it so they just so they just like keep on practice and wait until she can do it
S0653	uhu
S0655	and by the time that happen erm they could sell all the wool for like fifty six million pound
S0653	okay
S0655	and then it'll be a normal house have all the furniture sell that for about twenty five million pound
S0653	uhu
S0655	because it's very clever because it's very
S0653	yeah and then
S0655	knit furniture
S0653	mm
S0655	and then somebody buy the house for two thousand pound
S0653	uhu
S0655	and then they become a really rich circus and then they can like and all they do be travel around the country and then if they need to they will bring they will back up the tent and do some stuff
S0654	mm
S0655	they'll pack up the tent and then they will er they'll pack up the tent
S0653	it's alright it doesn't matter if you haven't get a a clue yet that'll it's fine we can we can just think about it
S0655	oh yeah it's just i'm i'm get ah think about little other stuff now
S0653	well that's good it's good you just your first thoughts
S0655	yeah but it's my but i but i have in mind engineer
S0653	oh
S0655	so they pack up the stuff onto a boat
S0653	uhu
S0655	an aeroplane probably would work the it could be a like a luxury cruise so they're like oh this cost a thousand pound er for a twenty five people oh right we have millions and then there'd be a little bite of money to go on the cruise and then maybe it's
S0653	speak properly
S0655	so they have a little bite of money they they would have they would pay a little bite of money to go on a cruise then they'd just relax until they get to the next country and then
S0653	right well okay
S0655	they would just become richer and richer
S0653	right okay anyway so we be just throw about ideas yesterday include you and can write whatever he want to write i might write my own version of the story and you might write your own version of the story
S0655	it depend which one get publish
