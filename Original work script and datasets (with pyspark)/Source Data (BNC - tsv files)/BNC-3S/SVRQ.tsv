S0012	oh right
S0152	but the cruise control on this be not the same as the well it be the same as what's on my car but you do do it on the steer wheel
S0012	do you
S0152	there's a little button here you press
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then there's a little dial that you just move up and down to either increase or decrease
S0012	the speed
S0152	the speed
S0012	yeah that's handy isn't it
S0152	amaze erm the the satnav i've work out how to actually use the satnav so that's relatively easy it's all in a little button in the centre and you just move it about and things like that
S0012	oh great
S0152	erm it didn't seem to be use any diesel but it do now cos it didn't move for a long period of time and then
S0012	really
S0152	it's drop which be interest but erm we'll see
S0012	yeah
S0152	we'll see don't know don't know what's gonna happen i don't know what's gonna happen still no news on the engine or anything so
S0012	crikey
S0152	still no news on the engine
S0012	well you've get this one for a little while
S0152	yeah it's gotta be build
S0012	the engine have gotta be build
S0152	so it's gonna be a brand new engine come from germany
S0012	crikey
S0152	but it's not build so they've get to build it from scratch
S0012	well one off they can't get one off the shelf
S0152	no there's not one of the shelf there's not one on back order at all
S0012	wow
S0152	supposedly supposedly
S0012	well that's a bite remiss of them isn't it
S0152	so
S0012	crikey you'd have think they'd of have a couple of well ford would and everyone else have a spare engines don't they
S0152	well it's it's not a new model be it that's the thing
S0012	well it's ten years old isn't it
S0152	no they're only suppose to keep twelve years of
S0012	yeah
S0152	part for any for any car they have to have twelve years of part but if it's an engine
S0012	yeah
S0152	well they'll have all the bits won't they
S0012	they'll have all the bits
S0152	just get to just get to assemble it
S0012	put it all together yeah yeah crikey well well that keep them employ doesn't it
S0152	well it's just just the think of it
S0012	yeah that's what i be think here
S0152	just the think of build you know i know they have to build it but just the think of build that engine and you know you know will it be you know i be think will it will it be will it be the same engine or will it be like a new engine like the new version of the engine
S0012	yeah
S0152	i'd rather it be i think it's call a an n four three will it be an n something that they're put in them now
S0012	oh i see yeah well i see line up with the gearbox
S0152	yeah yeah so
S0012	yeah they've get to rebuild they've get to build an engine for him
S0013	yeah yeah
S0152	so
S0012	well
S0013	oh
S0012	you would have think they would have say to you well you better have another car
S0152	well i be i be
S0013	yeah
S0152	actually look at the website last night to see what be around
S0013	oh
S0152	and the you know my my car they would sell my car at twelve at twelve and half thousand
S0012	yeah
S0152	that's what they'd sell my car at
S0012	yeah
S0152	they would probably give me ten for mine
S0012	yeah
S0152	so they get that little bite of leeway
S0012	yeah
S0013	right
S0152	well it's cost them more than
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0152	you know why don't they just give me another car
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then they can put the engine in when they need to
S0013	yeah
S0152	and then there's no expense on the at a hire car they've get to pay or
S0012	that's right
S0013	yeah
S0152	anything like that
S0013	have you suggest it
S0152	no no
S0013	you daren't

S0152	but my car be a model that they haven't get if you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0152	because the spec that's on my car
S0013	right

S0013	right
S0012	they do don't they yeah
S0152	it's unbelievable
S0013	it's quite special then
S0152	well i think whoever have it put those extra bits on
S0013	right
S0152	which be extra for that car so the other cars might have something different but don't have the same spec as
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know i look last night and one same same car have get the satellite navigation in
S0012	oh right yeah
S0152	the same erm model

S0012	yeah but they they have to learn don't they we do
S0152	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	i be the model teenager
S0013	doesn't sound like it
S0012	pardon
S0013	doesn't sound like it
S0012	what do you mean it doesn't sound like it hey
S0152	pig fly
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	you tell us too much
S0152	we know the things you ought to tell us
S0012	all lie all lie i be always try try to be one of the boys
S0152	mm yeah no it's our school be on sky news on friday
S0012	sky news be it
S0152	yeah well they have just publish this thing about obesity and how it's drop in the last couple
S0012	oh yeah
S0152	of years et cetera so they sky news ask if they could come in
S0012	and film the kid
S0152	and film and have a chat and of course it be a good bite of publicity for the new principal
S0012	well of course it be yeah
S0152	you know
S0013	mm
S0152	and it be interest because i hear i hear the i do hear the conversation cos i'd er have a student who have misbehave on thursday a year seven student and i'd ask my line manager what be we gonna do with him because everything's in limbo at the moment
S0012	yeah
S0152	because we don't know what the consequences be gonna be because in the old regime it be if this happen they be in there for the day
S0012	yeah
S0152	type thing er if and she doesn't want that she want it a little different so i get this message to email her and i think be i put myself in the middle here
S0012	yeah
S0152	be i put myself in the middle but the message be from my line manager and another person be he say you need to email and see what she say so i email the boss and she come back to me because she wasn't in the academy and come back and go see me in the morning and we'll have a have a chat
S0012	oh right
S0152	so i go in one in the morning
S0013	oh
S0152	and just and we have this chat and she go right what do you do and i explain i say it have be go on quite a lot of the day from the statements which we've take i say she say right we'll have him as an internal exclusion internal inclusion erm but make certain it go on the record that but we'll put him in the time out room because we we can't do over in the hub because a person just break his collarbone
S0012	oh right
S0152	a little girl okay no problem and then i say i'd go and get him and when i go to get him she make this phone call and i hear the phone call basically so that she be negotiate what they could do and what they couldn't do when they come in
S0012	oh i see
S0152	erm
S0012	yeah
S0152	which be which be interest and then i speak to a member of staff later in the day and it be like i don't know who she think she be
S0152	well she's the principal she's the principal of this the academy she can do what she want
S0012	yeah
S0152	be but the problem she's have be when you when you're a head or principal of your own school
S0012	yeah
S0152	it be different to be principal or head in a federation because the federation have rule
S0012	yeah
S0152	of what we can and can't do where so if you need to do if you need to do something you need to inform the federation that you're gonna do this
S0012	yeah
S0152	but then that's a big step stone
S0012	yeah
S0152	because you've get to keep check
S0013	yeah
S0152	and the i'm sure what i be tell be the federation say if they if the press be come in you've get to let every every student's parent know
S0012	know
S0152	they're come in
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	so that they can say nay or yay to them
S0012	be film
S0152	be film or whatever
S0012	yeah
S0152	now we we have on record everybody's consent to say yes we can no we can't
S0012	yeah
S0152	but if you're a a student and it's like
S0012	well yeah
S0152	you know oh yeah i want to be on tv and you parent say no
S0012	you do it
S0152	you do it i mean i have a a problem when i be student his parent have say he couldn't have his picture take
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it be a whole school photo and he want he want to be in it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	and his parent say he couldn't and then he he ask me could you phone up and say what it be and i go yeah of course i can if that's what you want so i phone up and they be like well what be it i say it's a whole school photo and he would like to be in it with all his
S0012	mat yeah
S0152	with all his mat and it be like oh what's it gonna be use for i say it's not go to be use for anything it's
S0012	yeah
S0152	it be a whole school photo
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know and the problem be know some of the parent they don't want the picture take because if their son or daughter do something wrong you've get an image of them say who it be
S0012	yeah of course of course
S0152	and that and that's another little factor that come into play
S0012	i think erm
S0012	i think but when they i don't think they have erm they film the kid in the playground and all you can see be their legs
S0152	yeah
S0012	they don't show any face or anything do they or if they're a little more away they're blur them it's a blur
S0152	yeah
S0012	it never use to be like that do it
S0013	no
S0152	no it's just
S0012	i mean when when they that that seem ridiculous to me what what what's the difference between you know see kid play in the playground and film the kid play in the playground
S0152	because there be some kid that have be move school and they're in safe house et cetera
S0013	oh yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	and if their and if from whoever they're put in the safe house from see them on tv
S0013	oh
S0152	they'll know where they be
S0012	yeah
S0152	and they go and hang outside
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	isn't it a shame how things have change though i mean that be quite some time ago when they decide that erm you couldn't film your kid that at the nativity
S0013	yeah
S0012	and they decide that be fine at the end though
S0013	yeah
S0012	well we be we film our kid at the nativity
S0152	yeah i mean i think i think one person if i remember rightly on person in the school kick up about it one person
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it be only one and because one person kick up then because the way that headteacher be and know what be go on with the press she go no blanket no
S0012	yeah
S0152	no but in the then she actually i think she then some sort of guidance come out from the unions in little bits and piece which say you know you make it clear that they can film it
S0012	yeah
S0152	but they're only film their child or whatever it be
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm and if and if they don't and if the child can't be film then you don't put them in play
S0012	yeah that make sense
S0152	why stop if for the majority
S0013	yeah
S0152	because of one person
S0012	yeah course i mean people be so proud of they're so proud of see their kid on stage do their bite and then some idiot will say oh no not not
S0152	yeah
S0012	they spoil it for the entire crowd
S0152	that's what it come down to
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	that's what it literally come down to
S0013	so be the reason that these parent didn't want their son be photograph
S0152	well it be because he be always in trouble
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	he be always in trouble and there be one there be one case where we do actually manage to get a picture cos we hadn't get we hadn't get picture of a couple of students who'd do something
S0012	yeah
S0152	and we the head of pe do some film intentionally
S0012	yeah
S0152	intentionally too and they get the picture and then of course we can't use them because we didn't have permission
S0012	oh right yeah
S0152	yeah little things like that we just have deal with so
S0012	yeah we do yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's such a shame though
S0152	we just have to deal with
S0012	i mean parent some parent be the way they rant and rave
S0152	yeah some but we've i mean this week's be a it's a the hardest week again this week
S0012	have it
S0152	oh yeah with with everything that's be go on this week it's be the hardest week so
S0013	yeah
S0012	i suppose it become harder as the term go on doesn't it because they're think it will be half term it will soon full term or whatever
S0152	well last week we be tell that we've get to deliver a different course for our uni's
S0012	oh right
S0152	right start three weeks' time
S0012	and you've get to set the course out then
S0152	yeah
S0012	in three weeks
S0152	in three weeks so scheme of work project that you're gonna do
S0012	yeah
S0152	et cetera et cetera
S0013	mm
S0152	three weeks and it's not just for year it will be for two years
S0012	oh
S0013	right
S0152	because we're think the timetable might change
S0012	well what about the curriculum do that
S0152	it will affect it will affect
S0012	it will affect the whole curriculum
S0152	yeah it will affect it yeah but it will also affect all year nine students
S0012	yeah
S0152	because what they're gonna make them do be a dt subject
S0012	oh right
S0152	well not all students at year nine want to do a dt subject
S0012	no
S0152	they want to get out of it they don't want to do it
S0012	no
S0152	they've have enough of it
S0012	sure
S0152	but they're all gonna have to do it right and this be the year group that wasn't allow to pick its options last year in year eight to go into year nine because the school have go back to a traditional way of pick
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	right
S0012	so there will be some disruption there
S0152	right so and because the new principal have use this course at her old school which be relatively successful which be back to two worth two gcse's you know
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0152	doesn't personally yes it's a it's a qualification point that have no mean
S0012	no
S0152	but it get you on the league table and get the students
S0012	yes it's a bite this league table isn't it there use to be some some course you could take and they be
S0152	yes well the government stop that you see
S0012	they stop that do they
S0152	yeah because what be happen when that come in you could have that once course for four then pick up another one and you've get your five gcse's
S0012	five gsce yeah
S0152	so you stand you
S0012	yeah
S0152	you be high in the standards you be in the top because that's how use to do it
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then the government get onto the back of that and go no you've get to have five gcse's and include english and maths
S0012	yes yeah yeah
S0152	so that would become the gold standards
S0012	you must you must get it in english and maths
S0152	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	so it's all kind of change but you're think alright so we've get three weeks to do this course begin of the week we be tell we can't do it
S0012	oh
S0152	because it's already register as a course for the arts
S0012	oh right
S0152	so this certificate number which you have this certificate number with craft or art or bt or whatever you're gonna run
S0012	yeah
S0152	but if you're already run you can't do it again the kid can't do the same thing
S0012	oh
S0152	so it's like yeah okay we'll get something there i'm sure we'll get something sort
S0013	yeah
S0152	and then so and we have a parent's even this week and i think it be on thursday but it be on wednesday
S0012	oh dear
S0152	because we have one last week which be on
S0012	yeah
S0152	the thursday and i just think it be a week later but they move it to wednesday
S0012	oh
S0152	which and that be a good parent even that be because i have almost all my class the parent come
S0012	do you
S0152	so erm i have fifteen students and thirteen set of parent come
S0012	that be good wasn't it
S0152	brilliant turnout
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	and they be all happy they all want to see me which be really good
S0012	yeah
S0152	so so we have our department meet on wednesday but on thursday it be like well what we gonna what we gonna do because you know well if if you give them an option a lot of students want to do food
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	right because you're cook all the time
S0012	that's right
S0152	and and i say one of the things that if we run the course that we're gonna run which be product design yes there be an element of food in there but you only have to cook once or twice in the three three time really because you've get to know all the other stuff that be on the exam paper
S0012	yeah
S0152	like how to make a cardboard model what glue you might use what erm what print press you would use a flow diagram of design you know
S0012	yeah
S0152	and artwork have to teach but she's gotta do some work
S0012	yeah
S0152	when you when you look at it you just do an element which will have the food element
S0012	yeah
S0152	why it's the same with the electronics it's the same with the erm textiles it's the same with if you do it but the but the big percentage be just basic about
S0012	yeah
S0152	with a small element you know if you've get to do it in we've get to do this one in just over eighteen months probably two years
S0152	and you can do it in a bite more so it's not you've get to give the kid an opportunity to pick an area that they want to go in
S0012	yeah
S0152	because not all the staff can teach all the
S0012	well that's another thing isn't it yeah you know
S0152	if you're fortunate enough to be able to teach all the elements that i can teach
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	not not a problem
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	but i mean what about someone who can't teach you know could do the textiles and could do the food
S0012	yeah
S0152	could only do the food erm could do the textiles and she could do the card stuff probably
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm and could could to the electronics she could do the things but then about what you're actually do
S0012	yeah
S0152	if you've get a hundred and seventy two kid do product design as a gcse in moderation
S0012	yeah
S0152	it would just be
S0012	well they don't no
S0152	and the other the other factor be i think they want to cut the budget
S0012	really
S0152	i think they want to cut the budget
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know spend ten grand on food
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah that's a lot yet
S0152	i mean ten grand on food
S0013	that's a lot
S0012	that be a lot isn't it
S0152	you know that i mean that's all year seven eight and nine cook and ten and eleven
S0012	don't they bring their own grub in
S0152	no cos they would never bring it in
S0012	oh
S0152	or they would forget to bring it in and then you'd have problem because they can't cook because they haven't get the ingredients and they'd mess around and stuff like that
S0012	do they have to buy
S0152	no
S0012	it no
S0013	well we use to
S0012	we use to have to buy it at the end
S0152	yeah no
S0012	i mean when we do woodwork we use to have to buy what we do
S0152	we've start
S0012	pay for the wood that's it
S0152	we start yeah we've start charge for aspects of it
S0012	yeah
S0152	but because sixty sixty to sixty five percent of our students be pupil premium
S0012	yeah
S0152	we get the
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	now i hear i hear the principal say on on friday to this student have you get a jacket have you get a waterproof jacket have you get a have you get a warm coat
S0012	wow
S0152	because if you haven't get one we'll buy you one with your pupil premium
S0012	what
S0152	and i'm think what pupil premium go into the school design for the staff pay for some of your staff
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos that's the way the boss use it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	it doesn't go to the students it bring staff on so you have more staff in areas
S0012	yeah
S0152	she's she's get a lot to sort out
S0013	yeah
S0012	let's hope she do it
S0152	she's get a lot to sort out
S0013	yeah there be a limit to what you can do isn't there
S0152	yeah
S0012	well do the money come from the educations committee or do it come from
S0152	come from the federation doesn't it
S0012	it come from
S0152	because we're an academy
S0012	oh i see
S0152	so the government give you money for your establishment
S0013	oh yeah
S0152	right now when you've get x amount of school within your federation
S0012	yeah
S0152	all that money go into a pot and then it get
S0012	share out
S0152	share out with erm i don't know
S0012	yeah
S0013	school equipment's more important really than buy coat and that
S0012	i always think book and equipment
S0013	yeah
S0012	be education you know
S0013	mm
S0152	yeah we've get all these ipads and everything
S0012	yeah
S0152	and she's take so many ipads out to give to students so they can do work on them yeah it's a nice idea but ipad you know they've get they've get their own if they've get a tablet then they should be use their own tablet to do the work on
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	and most of them have a tablet in some description description
S0012	they do don't they all the kid have get phone now haven't they
S0152	you know but
S0012	smartphones
S0152	but the argument there be well they won't do it so if we give them something yeah okay and the and they have to keep the they can't download anything to it or they can suppose but they can't change the the agreement be they can't switch off the track device on it
S0012	oh i see
S0013	oh okay
S0152	where be we
S0152	where be we okay now i i think
S0012	have they block facebook and all them sort of things
S0152	well facebook be suppose to be block in school
S0012	it be yeah
S0152	but if you've get a smartphone with internet connection
S0012	you you pay for it
S0152	so it don't make any difference do it

S0152	if you've get a phone with internet access you can get it you can't you can't not
S0012	no
S0013	no
S0012	well that's difficult isn't it

S0012	oh right
S0152	so you'd have to have you'd have to have a
S0012	yeah
S0012	we're nearly over our limit this year
S0013	i don't know

S0013	yeah we be and we be every month
S0012	and what do you do you go on facebook and watch that little thing this morning
S0152	the the problem be
S0013	i haven't watch anything this morning
S0012	well yesterday then
S0152	yeah the problem be though because you're because you're skyping and
S0012	yeah
S0152	you be gonna go over
S0012	yes
S0152	because you use that droid you know
S0012	yeah skype skype do a lot
S0013	yeah i think we're gonna have to eventually
S0152	yeah you know from a i mean we're unlimited now because i don't have to worry about it because
S0013	yeah
S0152	that extra five pound which it which it be if you go over your limit
S0012	yeah
S0152	well that's what it be if you have unlimited
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	we keep think well we'll pay the extra five pound whenever
S0012	yeah we do but now with skype and and america there be download all the time
S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	and every single email's a download
S0152	yeah well email be not that big but picture but that band that you use when you be
S0012	yeah
S0152	watch stuff
S0012	yeah
S0152	be amaze
S0012	yeah youtube
S0152	yeah
S0012	download and
S0152	anything you know if you're on if you're on your on your pad
S0013	yeah it would be nice just to not worry about it really
S0012	that would be nice yeah
S0152	well there's some good deal out and about with bt
S0013	yeah
S0012	well i don't think i have bt anyway just because there's there's a what's that one plusnet they didn't say we're cheaper than this that and the other that's bt
S0013	yeah
S0152	but if you read all the small print if you go over your allowance and stuff like that it's more expensive
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	so you might as well just go with bt or you know
S0012	yeah or virgin or whatever
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know be it fidelity
S0013	erm
S0152	i think that's come in bt he's come in it will be a matter eighteen months
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know but if you want then you've get nothing then you've get nothing to worry about then because if you've get an i plan anything you miss for twenty past seven days now it's now a month that they'll keep the program on for
S0012	yeah well i think we leave him eventually every week every month
S0152	because it be only seven days you could do seven days of capture but now it's
S0012	well that's good isn't it yeah
S0152	so
S0013	mm
S0012	no i think we'll have to eventually anyway i mean we go over every week every every month when and be here cos they've get computer as well
S0152	yeah
S0012	we've have computer
S0013	sometimes
S0012	yeah
S0152	ten gig be nothing now
S0012	ten gig be nothing at all be it
S0013	no we think they might up it but they're not go to
S0152	no no they won't what they want be they want people to go unlimited then they haven't get to worry about
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	those things
S0012	yeah
S0152	so
S0012	well it be the best idea to go unlimited cos
S0013	oh yeah
S0012	really we worry about watch things that will
S0013	we do we don't tend to watch youtube much
S0012	no
S0013	because
S0152	you know when you when you break it down
S0013	mm
S0152	you know
S0013	yeah
S0152	but you know you you facetime and whatever and skype that be hit it big
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	well christmas we we think we we assume we be all fine you know
