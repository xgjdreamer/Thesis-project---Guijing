S0653	so we're gonna talk about brownies today cos what be your erm earlier question
S0655	be it be brownies
S0653	hang on a minute you want to start you're desperate to start the conversation go on
S0654	no i i be just remind you that it's gonna be brownies
S0653	yes i know it's brownies today but what be you say earlier
S0655	be brownies illegal
S0653	illegal now why do you why be you ask what's your issue with it
S0655	erm because it's sexist and that's against the law
S0653	and why be it sexist
S0655	cos they don't allow boys
S0653	cos they don't allow boys so it be an interest issue actually isn't it
S0655	mm
S0653	cos if it be the other way around people would be possibly up in arm and say this be real sexism and girls should be allow to join scout and things and they be now allow to do that but and it hasn't work the other way around have it
S0655	no
S0653	and the brownies' website do promote it say that girls prefer the fact that there be no boys but erm if you feel very strongly about it we could write a letter and make it public
S0655	right i'm go to ask some people erm who if they would prefer it if there be boys or not in brownies
S0653	you're go to ask the brownies themselves
S0655	yeah see if the brownies
S0653	but to be honest with you it's irrelevant if they that's not a legitimate thing cos you can't have you know people in a workplace say well i don't really want girls in there they have to allow girls don't they and boys in society so it be in fact very sexist that brownies doesn't allow boys
S0655	yeah
S0653	but i'm just say if you wanna make an issue about it we could write an open letter and put it on twitter or something to see what they might suggest i think in all i think perhaps most boys won't want to do brownies but that's not the point if you want you're gonna spill garlic butter everywhere put that tray down
S0655	there's barely any
S0654	no there's hardly any
S0653	but but if you want to join brownies and do the activities that they do then perhaps you should be allow
S0655	i may not want to but
S0653	yeah but i think you do don't you
S0655	yeah i do but
S0653	mm
S0655	i just want i just want so
S0653	you to be yeah
S0655	yeah i just want boys to be allow to join brownies
S0653	i've yes but i think we could really only pursue it if you if you do actually personally want to do it because perhaps nobody want to join brownies perhaps no boy want to join brownies
S0655	i'll ask some of my class
S0653	or they've not really think about it but i think if you make an issue about it then that other boys would start to think ooh actually yes i like the things that they do in brownies stop do that you know and i'd like to join in but you know i feel that if we manage to get the the rule change or whatever and then you say well i don't want to do it i think it would be a bite of a shame if they'd have to sort of go through all the you know fuss about it do you see what i mean
S0655	yeah
S0653	you shouldn't have to to do it or join it as justification for get them to change the rule i mean if you like you can just make a statement say that it be that you feel it's sexist in fact if you want i can film you say this and i can put it on youtube if you prefer
S0655	i think twister would be better because
S0653	you think twister twitter
S0655	twitter might be better
S0653	well i can also put youtube stuff on twitter but you'd prefer a letter
S0655	yeah
S0653	so what what be your thoughts do you want to to do that
S0655	if it really get into my head and then i and then i probably will
S0653	cos i know you've be quite upset about it on and off since join erm and understandably so and i think you'll probably be quite upset when we all do the brownies ice cream parlour and have an amaze time but erm
S0655	although there be one thing
S0653	mm
S0655	that's a problem
S0653	mm
S0655	will you be able to afford it
S0653	to do for you to do brownies as well
S0655	mm
S0653	i'd find a way of make it happen
S0654	also you don't do drama you don't do dive
S0653	you don't do dive any more
S0654	what do you do
S0653	yeah yeah
S0655	chess
S0653	chess and football football
S0655	mm but
S0653	but chess doesn't cost me any money
S0655	like like out of school what do you do after school
S0653	yeah
S0654	i do brownies drama and ballet
S0653	yes
S0655	okay brownies drama and ballet
S0654	bgb
S0653	oh yeah well you're not do any drama lessons at the moment so but the question be do i mean we've talk about this before haven't we in fact i saw something in a magazine and i take a photograph off today there's a senior army officer who join the army as a man and then realise that she want to become a woman
S0655	hey
S0653	so she's now become a woman erm because there be people that feel that they're bear in the wrong body or there be mainly men it doesn't really work the other way around that er don't want to change sex but they do want to wear ladies' clothe
S0655	like david walliams
S0653	like david walliams yeah or there's grayson perry
S0654	the erm the grand central boy do
S0653	the grand central boy the boy in the dress
S0654	yeah
S0653	yes that's right
S0655	there's also a film call the boy in the dress
S0653	ah erm yeah
S0655	the boy in the dress be basically a life story about david walliams
S0653	well it sort of be and he he he like boys and girls as a in fact so i think what i'm ask you and we're not really sure be if you know do you want to be a brownie because you'd like to be a girl or do you just want to join in and do what they do cos you like their activities
S0655	well apparently they're gonna go kayak and it's just seem like a lot
S0654	punt
S0655	punt
S0653	punt they're go to go punt
S0655	but it just seem like so but brownies just seem like so much more fun than er scout be it
S0653	yes i think you definitely would prefer brownies to scout
S0655	yeah and to beaver
S0653	yeah but be that like be that just because of the activities themselves do you want to become a do or you do you just not know the reason why
S0655	i do not know the reason why
S0653	yeah okay
S0655	that's why it have such a big impact in my life
S0653	well i don't want you to get upset about it this be just it's just a very complicate issue isn't it there's absolutely no need to be worry if you're confuse cos you're only nine and a half so er it's perfectly natural to not to not know how you feel isn't it some some grow up don't quite know how they feel about these issue
S0655	mm
S0653	erm and we've we've sort of we have decide to be sisters together haven't we sometimes
S0654	sisters
S0653	sisters together
S0653	that we could all dress up in dress and go out and stuff
S0655	yeah
S0653	which would be lovely and you've get erm a dress well playsuit and you look lovely in it
S0654	and you can be my girlfriend if you want to be a girl
S0653	yeah i just want you
S0655	because
S0653	to be happy and feel comfortable in your own skin that's the most important thing
S0653	so the whole kind of other sexual stuff be gonna come later but i still think we should make erm an issue about the brownies thing
S0655	really
S0653	because it be it be sexist and i think their argument on the website say oh it's nice to have somewhere to go where there aren't any boys i've i personally find that quite offensive
S0655	yeah
S0653	it's rude isn't it
S0655	i
S0653	because you'd never be able to say that of as a boy
S0655	yeah
S0653	you know
S0655	yeah if it if there be a boy say oh i love this place there's absolutely no girls there
S0653	everyone would attack them wouldn't they yeah
S0655	yeah everyone would be like oi that's against the law
S0653	yeah they'd say well they'd say it would be very sexist
S0655	yeah
S0653	mm so i think
S0655	just
S0653	i'll find out who the head of the brownies be and i will write to them about it
S0654	do brown owl
S0653	no no of the entire well of the whole country
S0655	the queen
S0654	well
S0653	the queen be not in charge of brownies
S0654	well the person do tell you
S0653	the person do tell me would you like to be a little bite more specific
S0655	yeah
S0653	like the person tell you that i be really good at brownies remember and she give you a little phone call on the like a texty
S0653	what a little phone call little do you mean
S0655	little phone
S0654	yes from brownies
S0653	there be somebody not the whole of the country there's someone in
S0654	i mean that she be the whole of the country
S0653	well we haven't meet her
S0654	she texted you
S0653	nobody's texted me to say that you be brilliant
S0655	can we also complain to the people in the law so even so if brownies doesn't do it then it might need to shut down because if it's sexist
S0653	well i think that would be a bite harsh but i think we will start with a campaign where we even where we contact the brownies' head directly and then if we're not happy with what they say then we'll go public on twitter
S0655	yeah and if and then if we're still not happy load of people be go oh no no no it's brilliant that there's load of place there's find a place where there's no boys and just girls then it then we might need to go to the head the people in the law
S0653	well yes which well that would cost money so it would be a bite tricky but they might decide that you could be an honorary brownie in for example
S0655	yeah er i'll ask my friends if they want if they wouldn't mind if they become a brownie
S0653	yeah that would be interest take a poll
S0655	because i'd like to have some friends there
S0653	well you've get load of friends you've get and and
S0655	yeah i think quite a few people have a crush on me

S0653	and you've get your sister
S0655	yeah
S0653	be that what you want to say
S0654	mm
S0653	yes
S0655	but i do want some like friends that be boys cos it would be a bite awkward if there be
