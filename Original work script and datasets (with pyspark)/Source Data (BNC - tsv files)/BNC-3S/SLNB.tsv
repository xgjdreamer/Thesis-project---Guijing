S0058	oh er yes there's some fork you've just get cutlery
S0057	you don't mind do you
S0058	no no and a couple of serve spoon and um okay i think that's pretty much it okay um i'll get the oh i'll get the meat out um
S0057	plate
S0058	er you might wanna put it down er it'll probably fit on there actually actually no i think it do um i can turn it i'm not sure i can
S0057	just lift it if you can you lift it
S0058	it's really heavy
S0057	i be gonna say you might
S0058	well you know it's either not have enough
S0057	yeah
S0058	or we think well it'll go in sandwich and then it won't be waste you know
S0057	oh i see
S0058	oh yeah yeah so that's so you steam the broccoli cos it's quite nice steam
S0057	i didn't realize how you be gonna steam it
S0058	that's fine doesn't matter
S0057	right shall we get er
S0058	yes i'll do some
S0057	shall i do some gravy
S0058	gravy oh gravy separator
S0057	how should i get the onions out or
S0058	er yeah you can do and it can go in one of these serve bowl
S0057	one of these
S0058	yeah they're actually pasta bowl but they work quite well if you wanna do that and then make gravy
S0057	yeah they're quite cook last week we have a really small joint and the onions just didn't cook
S0057	mm
S0058	and the parsnips be a bite woody and it wasn't a massive success so i think er have everything for age work quite well something's
S0057	slow cook
S0058	slow cook i've be slave over this meal since five i say slave
S0057	you've hardly be slave
S0058	i haven't be slave it's not a massively high intensity bite of cook
S0057	haven't have roast dinner in like months
S0058	i like a roast dinner
S0057	have one yeah
S0058	i like roast dinner mum's not a massive fan of the roast
S0057	no
S0058	oh just stick it on the side cos some other bits can go in there
S0058	oh it's fine don't worry um oh don't worry too much about it there's er
S0057	it's probably gonna make a mess
S0058	um i think i might just have it out of the bowl
S0057	hm
S0058	spoon it out cos a little bite doesn't matter yeah well it's er
S0058	right and then we can pour the juice into there i dunno best way of do it
S0058	shall i do that
S0057	or do you want me to do it
S0058	be you do you think you're more steady hand than me sure confident
S0057	be it all go in
S0058	excellent and that just take a minute to separate
S0057	where do you want me to put the um
S0058	er just put that back on the on the stave er on the hob
S0057	on the what
S0058	on the hob funny little word
S0057	what do you say stave

S0057	you say some sort of like weird word like stover
S0057	didn't know what you be say
S0058	on the stave carrots be pretty much carrots aren't they can't really
S0057	yeah
S0058	ah so yeah veg
S0057	how do this work then
S0058	it just the fat be rise to the top as it cool and just get lighter and then the spout
S0057	ah
S0058	come from the bottom so when you pour oi
S0057	amaze
S0058	it's good ain't it you just cook everything and throw it in a dish at the side apart from the meat be the critical thing
S0057	mm
S0058	oh i should probably get these out actually
S0057	yeah
S0058	they're probably quite cook
S0058	generally
S0057	um not for any particular reason other than have you get another bowl i might need a third vegetable bowl
S0058	there be a third bowl yeah um yeah actually yeah that's a good point if you put so if i put them in one put these in that one then there's another bowl in the bowl cupboard pass it here
S0058	um

S0057	can i just like stack these to get rid of them
S0058	um er they can go in the sink probably soak cos that ones a little bite they're non stick actually they're really good though these ones look they're really good oh the broccoli's go lovely and green
S0057	can i put the other one in as well
S0058	yeah um the other one yeah just just so they don't get too er um well i think we're there actually presumably
S0057	where be the bowl in here
S0058	er no in the on the leave down leave down that's it
S0057	right and then you drain
S0057	then what do i do with this gravy
S0058	and then the gravy um i will pour it so you just basically pour the um
S0057	you could always put your veg back in this grill bite
S0058	oh that's a good idea actually yeah
S0057	should i turn it off
S0058	just need to turn it off yeah
S0057	which one
S0058	just turn that one off the that one just turn it right to the top and then the one on right on the far leave turn it up to the top as well one just set the and one
S0057	oh there's peter there
S0058	oh perfect
S0057	should i turn er everything off
S0058	yeah
S0057	how do you turn this off
S0058	um just round to the top that's it click still a lot of veg still
S0057	to do some more carrots than what you say
S0057	so
S0058	well there be only a few carrots
S0058	better to have too many
S0057	how be i
S0058	don't like people to go hungry oh
S0057	how be i to do this gravy
S0058	then you pour the juice from the bottom into the thing but be careful stop

S0058	and that's just the suction
S0057	that's so um clever
S0058	isn't it i'm quite please with it and then we'll let that boil up for a minute

S0179	thank you
S0058	mm slightly different to leg i think
S0179	hm
S0058	slightly different taste nicer hm
S0179	i er believe it's generally view as slightly lower quality to leg it be just the only lamb they have in a decent amount
S0058	mm yeah we do look at all the different we sort of get to morrisons at about four o'clock
S0057	what time do close
S0058	er they close at four
S0057	oh
S0179	we get there at ten to
S0058	we get there at ten to um so it there wasn't massive amount of sunday roast leave

S0057	ten minutes before they close
S0179	no no one do roast dinners on sunday
S0058	a lot of people don't no you're right
S0179	as evidence by the fact it's such a small section of morrisons and that section be still pretty full
S0058	mm
S0179	but it er just so happen they didn't have any of the good size leave so er see as we be restrict from beef we've sort of have to improvise
S0058	mm and we think turkey be a bite christmassy
S0057	it be quite christmassy
S0179	and pork be just too experimental
S0058	and pork be just yeah we have never do a pork
S0057	oh

S0179	as in it's hardly as if she's be rely on public health
S0058	oh right oh i see what you mean yes
S0179	unlike david cameron much to his credit
S0058	mm much to his credit yeah
S0179	i'm full of respect for him for that
S0058	fair play to him
S0057	the only thing i respect him for
S0058	i i'm
S0057	bite of a creep
S0179	no
S0058	he's a bite he's a bite creepy but like i don't
S0179	well
S0057	he he's a he's an absolute sleaze he's disgust
S0058	he's not disgust
S0179	why personally why
S0058	he's he's no worse than any labour politician like
S0057	mm
S0058	but you know all politicians be pretty bad like
S0179	but as far as prime minister go
S0058	i don't particularly like any of them
S0179	both him and tony blair i don't necessarily agree with their politics but i respect them as people
S0058	mm
S0179	i think they've get a certain amount of integrity which
S0058	i be gonna say like he's
S0179	for politicians be impressive
S0058	ah but he seem alright like he doesn't
S0179	you take what you can get
S0058	he doesn't seem massively bad whereas nick clegg do fundamentally lie
S0179	rape the entirety of the student population
S0058	and he yeah
S0179	of this country
S0058	get all the students to vote for him and then just go oh sorry i lie which er at least david cameron have kind of do what he say he'd do which
S0058	in the at least i respect him for that because
S0057	nah
S0058	cos yeah i mean i mean yeah i don't like him
S0179	okay but aside from
S0058	but he seem yeah
S0179	aside from tory bash exactly what don't you like about him
S0057	well have you see the tory budget
S0179	yes indeed
S0179	well the coalition budget i think you mean but yes
S0057	yeah well
S0057	you know it
S0058	well as far as cleggy have any
S0057	mm
S0058	say in it bless him
S0179	well no but he do in all fairness the deputy secretary of the treasury be in fact a lib dem and it's quite a
S0058	ah no right no cos they do they bring in the
S0179	so it's er
S0058	lib dem policy about um lib dem policy be the one about the um raise the threshold for taxable
S0179	no they both want to do that in all fairness
S0058	do they oh right okay
S0179	mm
S0058	that's quite good
S0179	oh so what else about the budget
S0057	well just the fact that like they've screw everybody over with it
S0179	er specifically how
S0057	huh you can't huh
S0058	there be the front page of the
S0179	you
S0058	metro which i think be a bite sort of scaremongering where they have a picture of a granny go like that granny bash budget which really the metro
S0057	there be er um
S0058	so
S0179	um well all they've actually do as far as that's concern be freeze the increase on the tax free um allowance for pensioners i don't think that's unreasonable it's already well above what most people on a standard well anyone on a standard state pension will be get
S0058	mm
S0179	which be the time comment yeah so it's gonna affect the number of saga cruise that people can go on
S0058	cos it's the pensioners who have
S0179	big deal
S0058	large pension
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	well
S0179	it's you know just cos you're a pensioner doesn't mean you know it will be decades before i'm anywhere near as well off as my parent
S0179	who er who shortly will both be pensioners
S0058	mm
S0179	they own a house which be value at approximately a million pound
S0058	yeah
S0179	you know it it that's a generation which can take quite a bite
S0058	well there be a chart in the metro show how people would be affect by this and whether they'd be better or worse off and luckily couple who two people with no children be would benefit the most from this
S0179	well you see um i'm
S0058	but
S0179	i have absolutely huge sympathy i think it's a great idea to cut child benefit from couple earn over fifty thousand pound
S0058	well exactly i mean if you're earn fifty grand
S0179	that's like i'm
S0058	you're do alright like put it into the nhs instead like that make sense
S0179	yeah indeed and
S0058	spend it on cancer drug spend it on childcare like brilliant
S0179	stop give people free fuck contraception
S0058	mm
S0179	well instead of give them free contraception just er enforce them to be sterilize
S0058	oh god
S0179	with that
S0057	i be quite in favour of free contraception even
S0058	mm
S0179	oh i
S0057	i don't
S0058	oh no no
S0057	see a problem with that
S0179	i see a problem with that when you can't get drug which be potentially lifesaving on the nhs but
S0058	i think it
S0179	contraception's free but if you be say
S0058	i think it could be mean test
S0179	a chronic cystic fibrosis patient
S0058	yeah
S0179	you need to pay for the drug that will keep you alive
S0057	but it's not as clear cut as kind of this this take money away from that though
S0179	no but it's just still a question of what's get fund and what isn't
S0057	well in that case stop all the fund for the people who be drug abuse and alcohol abuse
S0058	mm
S0179	well but then you get into a question of mm virtually any medical condition other than genetically inherit ones can be say to be moderately self inflict
S0179	but the point be that your er contraception be an issue which be by most definitions recreational
S0058	well i think
S0179	in fact pretty much if you be use contraception it be recreational
S0058	i dunno i think it's bad that
S0179	i mean i think it in practice it's a good thing because we don't want
S0058	people you know kiddies can't get the right drug for for their
S0179	well children get free drug
S0058	oh fair er do you know what i mean like no but in all fairness like the nhs can't afford to prescribe
S0179	mm
S0058	certain drug to kiddies with cancer and i think well hm
S0179	mm quite
S0058	i dunno i think i er
S0179	but if you're a woman it's your human right to have a child so you can have ivf for free
S0058	i'm i'm uncomfortable with that
S0179	fuck off
S0058	i've gotta say that i think i think like yeah it should be spend on cancer drug for kiddies you know rather than ivf i think that's something that be slightly less critical to to bring sort of happiness to i dunno i don't know exactly how the figure work so
S0058	mm
S0179	the other unfortunate argument be we're many people have postulate across the years you know stop pay for treatment for people who have self inflict illnesses
S0057	mm
S0179	i e cancer from smoke two huge problems with that firstly you're essentially condemn those people to a slow painful death
S0057	yeah exactly
S0179	which be
S0058	which
S0179	not reasonable
S0058	it's not really the british
S0179	way of do things
S0058	health system way of do things
S0179	it's the american way of do things
S0058	i be gonna say yeah
S0179	it's um and secondly it's actually um cigarette tax be often generally equate with fund of the nhs
S0058	yeah
S0179	tobacco tax so it's like
S0058	hence why they won't ban
S0179	yep
S0058	smoke because it fund the nhs
S0179	well considerably more than the cost of each smoker the cost of er kind of twenty a day
S0179	the amount of tax
S0058	yeah
S0179	you'll contribute in your lifetime be sort of ten time that that your treatment will cost
S0058	yeah yeah that like which be why they're sort of not you know not too worry
S0179	mm it's only a slight shame that as a motorist the amount of fuel tax you pay doesn't actually go on the roads
S0058	yeah
S0179	ah well
S0058	never mind
S0179	there be some commentator rather cynically say on the bbc website other day um it's actually in the government's interest to make roads as inefficient and congest as possible that way more money get spend on fuel
S0058	yeah oh you can just imagine david cameron stand er in the middle of the er m1 stop
S0058	everybody wait here
S0058	actually no not david cameron he'd send nick clegg out to do it
S0057	yeah
S0058	in his high vis jacket
S0179	no one would stop
S0058	oh poor cleggy
S0057	not poor cleggy
S0058	hm
S0179	no
S0058	cleggy
S0057	cleggy
S0179	it just it just
S0058	he have ruin the lib dems forever
S0179	no but it's just the fact that if he'd just say
S0179	it be it be just a matter of what he say if it be just
S0058	yeah
S0179	i'm sorry but in order to make this coalition government work i cannot deliver on my student loan issue
S0058	mhm
S0179	that would've be bad but acceptable instead of which he say no i get it wrong
S0058	idiots
S0179	yeah
S0058	huh help yourself to oh you have good
S0057	don't worry i'm not shy
S0058	ah should we move off politics huh
S0179	dear everything be politics mm
S0058	unless you do an english degree
S0057	or classics
S0058	well look i be gonna say if english be purely sex and death for three years
S0057	classics be purely sex
S0058	nice pretty much accurate
S0057	yeah
S0179	they're all dead i think there's a certain amount of fatality in there
S0057	you never talk about them die though
S0058	unless it's the romans
S0058	die a lot
S0057	they love a bite of death
S0057	the greeks think they be immortal
S0058	who
S0057	the greeks though they be immortal
S0058	they think they
S0057	themselves
S0058	as in the greeks think the greeks be immortal right
S0057	well they didn't actually but like
S0057	do you know what i mean they didn't have the same kind of attitude towards death as the romans
S0058	hence it be just all about sex
S0057	mhm
S0058	pretty much that's good so it's just you know half of the
S0057	sex and religion fatal combination
S0058	oh religion yeah there's quite a bite of religion in most english literature as well but tend to be tie in with either sex or death so a bite less critical as a theme
S0179	see in contrast it's my job to enhance sex and prevent death
S0058	nice
S0179	no literally i work for medical devices team so it's our job to prevent death and i've also um learn that er we recently do a well we frequently do apparently do project in er sex toy relate
S0058	mm
S0179	um so
S0057	oh dear
S0179	should've see the condoms we be produce
S0058	oh
S0179	for some reason in the american market there be a demand for flock condoms
S0057	for what
S0179	flock so like fluffy
S0058	urgh
S0179	condoms
S0057	that be disgust
S0058	that's disgust
S0179	but er no but apparently it wasn't necessary just for them to be fluffy but they need to have stuff paint on the fluff
S0057	bleurgh
S0058	that's quite a logistical challenge to paint fluff
S0179	well louise be clear out a desk and find a sample they be use
S0057	that be grim
S0058	who put this here
S0179	yeah basically
S0058	boys excellent
S0179	no it's a product she'd be work on
S0058	nice oh dear aren't you glad you're do work experience with me
S0057	bleurgh
S0179	ours be a lot more fun
S0058	do sound quite fun
S0057	to be fair i've just be from be to amsterdam so i'm
S0058	mm
S0179	they don't have class four lasers in amsterdam
S0057	they don't they have a lot of sex toy
S0179	er
S0058	oh dear
S0058	why be you be whistle the archers theme tune
S0058	oh excellent
S0058	miranda reference right there oh yeah
S0179	oh it wasn't actually deliberate but never mind
S0058	really
S0179	yeah
S0058	maybe it be just a natural thing that people whistle the archers theme tune
S0179	oh yeah so how's
S0058	be
S0179	be he have some cake
S0058	be probably not have cake
S0179	i actually
S0058	um
S0179	resist the urge to cake when we walk past earlier
S0179	i be very good who would like more meat
S0058	oo i'll have a oo actually i've get quite a lot um maybe tiny bite really really tiny bite

S0058	yeah
S0179	quite a risk
S0058	it it be a bite of a risk
S0057	oh
S0058	um she's get she's get a condition which mean it be quite a high risk
S0057	oh i see
S0058	so basically that's why she think she couldn't get pregnant
S0057	oh
S0058	cos of this condition she could get pregnant it turn out but it do mean that she have a very high risk of miscarriage but she's still pregnant now so it's quite the risk have pass a little bite

S0179	yeah
S0179	change all the clock hang on two watch car phone i assume the laptop's update it might not have do
S0058	the the heaters do it automatically i be really impress with it's an intelligent little system it be the only clock that be right this morning when i get up
S0057	how could you tell
S0058	cos it's the it's an hour ahead of everything else
S0179	it's an hour ahead of everything else
S0058	jinx
S0057	oh i see
S0179	cos
S0057	one clock you wouldn't realize that
S0058	i'd see all the clock i go and look round and which ones i need to change mm
S0179	science
S0179	it work ow
S0058	sorry your bad leg be you gonna put
S0179	well no it be it be the knee of the bad leg
S0058	oh
S0179	so that be fine it be just the fact have you get like stilettos on or something cos that be really sharp
S0058	my big toe
S0057	toenail
S0058	toenail
S0179	fungal
S0058	yes
S0057	you haven't get fungal toe have you
S0058	i haven't get fungal toe no mm dinner conversation so politics
S0058	oh dear
S0179	so politics what do everyone think about the most talk about issue issue which be inspire the most vitriolic there we go comment on the bbc website raise the motorway speed limit to eighty
S0058	oh god i think that sound perfectly sensible most people
S0057	do that mean that they'll what be there currently like a limit beneath which you could get fin for drive too slowly on the motorway
S0179	yes
S0057	what's that limit
S0179	um
S0057	or do it
S0179	anything which be deem to be dangerous
S0057	dangerous
S0179	in the condition
S0058	mm
S0179	which be at the discretion of the police officer
S0057	oh okay
S0179	in free flow motorway condition be er in my professional opinion that would be definitely fifty or lower probably sixty or lower
S0057	mm
S0179	as in you shouldn't on a clear motorway you should be up at the limit if it's safe to do so but yes you should indeed be on any road um there's a well know fact that you will in fact um you will fail and rightly so fail a drive test for not be within a few miles an hour of the speed limit unless there's a good reason
S0057	mm
S0058	so if you're go along at twenty unless you're behind a tractor cos i mean it make sense
S0179	it make huge sense because people you be you be impede traffic you're cause congestion and you're encourage potentially dangerous overtake and er most critically people won't be expect you to
S0057	mm
S0179	do that speed therefore it's very dangerous cos it be hard to judge relative speed on the motorway and and if someone's not pay attention behind you they're do seventy you're do fifty they'll be on you pretty damn fast
S0058	so
S0057	but er
S0058	if they raise it to eighty what will be the
S0057	that's what i be gonna say
S0058	yeah
S0179	well cos at the moment the er in practice most people will do at least eighty on a motorway um the current system of speed speed cameras slash speed work out on the basis that it's the speed limit plus three miles an hour plus ten percent which on a seventy mile an hour road be eighty anyway um and the police will never stop you for do eighty because everyone do so it's not enforce they'll
S0057	mm
S0179	stop you for do much more than eighty
S0058	yeah
S0057	yeah
S0179	so you know ninety er you know eighty five to ninety you're ask for trouble but eighty's pretty much fine so it's essentially the unofficial speed limit anyway and people be just say well let's just legitimize this the other argument for it be that um actually cars today be an awful lot safer than they use to be and er the
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	yeah cos the speed limit be put in when cars weren't as safe so
S0179	yeah well it er use to be derestrict
S0058	oh right
S0179	that's mostly cos the cars couldn't go that fast
S0179	um and now they can um we also do have the slowest speed limit in all of europe
S0058	do we
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh right
S0179	france be seventy five um germany's
S0058	germany's
S0179	er derestrict basically
S0058	yeah cos germany's autobahn
S0179	it's either derestrict or eighty five
S0058	germany you can just drive
S0179	um
S0058	tire pet
S0057	mm
S0058	aw
S0057	really tire
S0179	so yeah er there be a bite and of course the arguments against it be if you make the speed limit eighty everyone will do ninety
S0058	mm
S0179	um which i don't think be entirely true
S0057	i be gonna say it's like some people don't feel comfortable drive kind of at that speed at those speed anyway so if you've get
S0058	well
S0057	if you raise the speed limit so some people be drive at ninety some people drive kind of you know say they usually drive sixty on a motorway they might not
S0179	mm
S0057	feel comfortable do seventy so then you've get like a big discrepancy in
S0179	well to be fair we possibly
S0179	oughtn't to be
S0058	but that be quite fast like er i don't know if people would actually
S0179	well
S0058	whether it would just be exactly the same as currently
S0179	i don't think it i think it would make it slightly worse but not that much um i mean er the basic question be should we legitimize something which be in practice already legal
S0058	yeah
S0179	well as it er as in practice isn't enforce um i mean road safety charities like brake who piss me off
S0179	say that of course you shouldn't speed kill er road safety charities like the iam and actually who be competent say that no speed doesn't kill bad drive kill speed be factor um but i'm not sure where i stand on this it's very it's very complex
S0058	mm
S0179	as contrary to the opinions of everyone spout their mouth off about the subject in
S0058	mm
S0179	like both directions um um
S0058	have anything happen yet or be there just talk about it
S0179	oh they're gonna have a trial on the um road that go from the m25 down to dover um
S0058	shall we have a drive down there one weekend go
S0179	um
S0058	what be they gonna well you mean a trial in the sense they're gonna see if people actually go at ninety
S0179	yeah well they're just gonna see how it work um the um of course the other interest point be that well actually er it's the speed limit on the dual carriageway as well and in it should be acknowledge that motorways be far safer than dual carriageways and you should either raise it on a motorway or lower it on dual carriageways
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's not um appropriate to have the same limit on both and i suppose er markably illustrate the other day
S0058	when
S0179	yesterday that er audi a3 the blue one with the
S0058	oh right yeah people just like swerve out into the motorway oh
S0179	cos motorways have certain requirements to make them motorways dual carriageways don't but dual carriageways have the same national speed limit
S0057	mm
S0058	they're as not as safe
S0179	so so dual carriageways have junctions across them whereas motorways it have to be a long slip road
S0057	mhm
S0179	dual motorways have to have um hard shoulder so that you can get off it if your vehicle break down dual carriageways don't
S0057	mhm
S0179	um motorways have er more stringent er more stringent corner um severity restrictions um and a better lip they're patrol better maintain um so it's not reasonable to have the same speed limit on both realistically um mm anyway
S0058	have your dinner chuck
S0058	what be you look for
S0057	sorry york
S0058	can i have a look
S0057	oh
S0058	it's all this food be that nice chuck

S0057	in hall there be a point when like your piece of lamb would like look like that
S0058	that's not good
S0057	and like you'd have like this bite of meat and that bite of meat and
S0179	mm
S0058	selwyn's never look quite that bad
S0179	no it have
S0058	we do go
S0057	this be in my first year with chicken and banana
S0058	oh we go one time and we'd have we we'd go to one formal at one college and it be really nice really swish cheese and biscuits at the end it be really nice and then they
S0179	kat's
S0058	kat's then they come to selwyn and they serve chicken kiev and chip
S0057	oh no
S0058	it be really bad it be so embarrass
S0179	i'd organize that
S0179	it be embarrass
S0058	yeah it's nine pound fifty now though
S0057	for selwyn formal
S0179	well we be the twenty third poorest out of thirty one colleges
S0179	as the bursar's recent report say which interestingly
S0058	you get
S0179	include the pay freeze pay rise freeze and bonus freeze for staff
S0058	that's quite bad
S0179	i be like yeah i understand now
S0058	i i i look forward
S0179	why the head porter's such a bitch
S0058	i look forward to my pay rise
S0057	why
S0058	and i will be get a mini bonus
S0057	why be they so poor
S0058	because
S0179	because the college
S0058	er
S0179	well fundamentally until until forty years ago it be a theological college
S0057	mm
S0179	so all of our well firstly
S0057	oh okay
S0179	we're not that old in the sense of only a hundred and twenty five years
S0057	yeah
S0179	secondly all of the old boys be priests
S0057	yeah
S0058	and so have no money
S0179	um
S0057	that's tricky
S0058	it's just how it work
S0179	and money generate money so
S0057	yeah
S0179	rich colleges with endowments of a hundred million plus yeah we've go down to thirty five million i believe
S0057	mm
S0179	um which be and it's be very well manage so we actually have an ex city banker as a bursar so he's far more professional that a lot of the older colleges so we're actually very profitable for our size
S0057	mm
S0058	but it's still do mean nine fifty for formal and give you chicken kiev
S0179	but we do have
S0058	but er
S0179	some advantage so we have all of our build roughly on site which be a huge bonus er both for the students and for conferences so as you have indeed find in virtually all of our central colleges if you go to say 's 's et cetera you will actually end up fuck off up or wherever to
S0179	have your halls of residence
S0058	yeah
S0057	i didn't mind that though it be the quality not the location that be the issue with 's
S0058	so be it oh so it be bad er build
S0057	the location be actually much better
S0058	mm
S0057	in my second year
S0058	okay
S0057	than be er on
S0179	well that's a tad different because 's er in it's very much a centre i believe whereas 's a bite more string out
S0058	it be a bite more
S0057	yeah
S0058	it's a bite bigger whereas be like
S0057	yeah
S0058	than
S0179	well as in cos the
S0179	city of be actually pretty
S0058	you know like
S0179	you know the city of be huge
S0058	be huge yeah
S0179	but the the central er what we would term as be very small
S0057	yeah
S0058	cos it's there's there's load in the north there's milton there's a science park there's which go on forever out that way's which go out forever that way er it's it's quite sprawl whereas
S0179	but the university be
S0058	and if you end up live in road you're miles from anything
S0179	well there's no er current uni accommodation up there
S0058	mm
S0179	but
S0058	road
S0179	no i don't think so
S0058	mm possibly not yeah but yeah um so
S0179	however um the beauty of selwyn be that you be never more than at absolute most like two hundred yards away from a plodge
S0057	yeah
S0179	which be
S0179	have advantage as in you can get you can still go to hall all the time you can stagger back from the bar you can
S0058	get to bed
S0057	yeah whereas like 's
S0058	but
S0057	like
S0058	mm
S0057	be um like twice the distance that 's be to their main
S0058	right
S0057	college from the city centre
S0058	yeah
S0057	so it wasn't so much of a you didn't feel like you be out on a limb
S0058	yeah
S0057	um so
S0058	have you get porter now at um you live in
S0057	this be yeah this
S0058	do you have porter at
S0057	we have um
S0058	er do you have a man like a
S0057	a reception
S0058	yeah
S0057	but they're not there all the time
S0058	okay
S0057	but we have sub wardens that be there all the time
S0058	yeah i be gonna say there's someone around
S0057	that you can call
S0057	who you gonna call ghostbusters um
S0058	who you gonna call sub wardens
S0057	i do once get them out to tell the people upstairs they can shut the fuck up
S0057	at four o'clock in the morning
S0058	oh
S0057	there's these er i'm not be racist
S0057	there's some
S0058	oh god
S0057	no no no no no there's some
S0179	that's not a good way to start a sentence
S0057	there's some international students just arrive
S0058	right
S0057	for this semester
S0058	right
S0057	and they've take the room of the people who be just here for a semester last semester
S0058	right
S0057	and they're noisy as anything at all kinds of anti social hours
S0058	mm
S0057	and it's really really annoy like i've be wake up about six or seven time
S0058	oh that's not what you want
S0057	by them play music and stuff at like really inappropriate hours um
S0058	that's
S0057	but like yeah we have sub wardens there all the time and we have people there from eight till six during the day so
S0058	so generally
S0057	and we have like a main warden who you can
S0058	you can ring
S0057	go to as well but
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah cos the only people we share a wall be that little bite there and um last week when be sleep in here they start play for some reason start play really loud music at six in the morning
S0179	be it r and b
S0058	i dunno what it be i i hear the er the bassline wake me up in that side of the house
S0057	that's really weird
S0058	but it yeah i mean you can imagine what it
S0057	who live there do you know them
S0058	well they're not be racist er i think they're eastern european
S0057	not be rude
S0058	signal that you're gonna be rude i think they're eastern european and they seem okay but you've see
S0179	they've perfectly pleasant
S0058	the pile of rubbish
S0179	as in they always smile they're
S0058	they do always smile they're perfectly pleasant
S0057	i haven't see the pile of rubbish no
S0058	they have unfortunately start fly tip on our
S0057	oh
S0058	visitor park er well well start off they be park their car
S0179	they also
S0058	in the visitor park space
S0057	yeah
S0058	and we think well that's not really fine then they start park two cars in the visitor park space and bin collection area they on and the pavements then they start dump rubbish in the park space it be a bite of an issue um
S0179	yeah i'm really tempt to say
S0058	i'm ring the council tomorrow
S0179	get off our land
S0179	but er
S0058	i'm i'm ring the council tomorrow anyway about um the address so i'll ring i i'll
S0057	why
S0058	cos our address isn't register and peter can't
S0057	why
S0058	get a phone contract cos it's a new house well it's a six month old house and er um apparently royal mail don't know that our address exist so when you put your postcode in they go i'm sorry this address doesn't register we can't do a credit check on you
S0057	that's ridiculous
S0058	yeah so
S0057	be that for a land line or
S0179	no mobile
S0058	no it's um just a mobile phone contract
S0057	oh okay be you gonna get a land line or not
S0058	we've get one
S0179	we have one
S0057	oh
S0179	have one for months
S0058	well the problem be we don't actually have
S0179	since before we move in in fact
S0058	yeah it's for the internet cos you
S0057	oh
S0058	need to get a land line in order to have the internet so we think well we may as well get a phone but it's just
S0179	and we have um free weekend call
S0058	free weekend call
S0179	yes
S0058	but not to mobiles just to land line
S0179	yes free weekend call to um mobiles and land line
S0058	do we i think it be just to land line
S0179	mm check that but
S0058	i think i'll check that
S0179	i think
S0058	i think it's just land line
S0179	no i think it's
S0058	okay
S0179	think it's both
S0057	will you give me your land line number then i can ring you
S0058	mm well yeah i be gonna say yeah i guess yeah i guess ring a land line be
S0057	be cheaper
S0058	cos i get free o2 to o2 and i get sort of certain number of minutes on my thing but have you get be you on like a
S0057	oh no i'm on minutes actually just on a hundred minutes
S0058	hundred minutes
S0057	which be not terribly much but i only pay two fifty a month so
S0058	woah that's amaze
S0057	i get unlimited texts and a hundred minutes
S0179	two fifty sterling
S0058	that's
S0057	mm
S0058	that's really good
S0179	on which network
S0057	because um i've be with virgin mobile since i be like eleven and so they i be mean to be pay
S0179	you have a phone when you be eleven
S0057	yeah
S0058	you get a phone before me
S0057	oh um
S0058	i get a thirty three ten
S0179	i didn't get a phone till i be sixteen
S0058	really i get a phone when i be
S0058	thirteen or fourteen
S0057	anyway yes as i've have a phone for like many many years and so they ring me up and be just like yeah yeah pay currently pay eight pound a month for this um bundle we're gonna reduce that to two pound fifty for you
S0058	wow
S0057	the catch be i've gotta keep it for a year but
S0058	well that's pretty good i mean i'm on ten pound no hang on i'm on
S0057	have you see my phone though
S0058	yeah
S0179	well you can just buy a new phone put the same sim into it
S0057	yeah defeat the object it's fine it do the job
S0058	but i mean you be gonna you be think seriously think about an iphone and sort of at the last minute think no which be er turn out to be a very good decision
S0179	well er
S0058	cos it would've be like be it thirty pound a month
S0179	well there be a deal on the back of the time magazine thirty six pound a month a hundred pound one off for a phone but it have this subtle attraction that you get two thousand minutes unlimited texts unlimited data
S0058	ah that's good
S0179	so that be quite impressive
S0058	it's pointless have an iphone without unlimited data to be honest because that's the point
S0179	no it's not you don't need er that data on that i mean it have a one gig data contract a month on my ipad i never exceed it
S0058	yeah quite a lot depend what you're do with it
S0057	cos i only ever text so
S0058	i be gonna say
S0057	i never ring people
S0058	mm
S0057	so that's why i don't really need anything
S0058	it's quite good because i'm i get free o2 to o2 minutes and 's on o2 as well which be good and
S0179	as do i indeed
S0058	er yeah so we can ring each other for free not use minutes
S0057	right
S0058	and i get so many minutes and
S0179	oh do you get unlimited o2 to o2
S0058	unlimited yeah it's free
S0179	oh cos mine restrict you to three hundred extra
S0058	still quite a lot normally it's
S0179	i don't wanna
S0058	what do you want for tea pasta good
S0057	that's like five hours so
S0179	and i don't wanna speak to you for five hours
S0058	i be gonna say five hours be quite a lot
S0179	quite a lot talk to you
S0058	rather than actually be we'll have to just go into another room and just ring each other we do that the other day like be set up skype so i sit in here on skype and you sit in there

S0057	oh okay
S0058	crap towns two
S0057	what's second

S0179	bradford probably
S0057	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	luton's pretty rough
S0179	no so er so we be there's i mean again not be racist luton have huge problems with cultural integration i e
S0057	mm
S0179	um so we er inadvertently end up go through the high street because another cos the ring road be close go home one night the motorway be gridlocked it it's five miles north of harpenden so it's very close but worlds apart and and er sarah's comment be this doesn't feel like england anymore
S0058	well
S0179	and it doesn't as in you're the only white people you can see everyone's talk mostly in another language
S0057	mm
S0179	and it's very threaten as in
S0058	er it's it's not
S0179	we get out we be go to get some food er somewhere we go into a kebab shop and just leave cos everyone be star at us
S0058	it be it be very weird it be er very strange atmosphere
S0057	blimey
S0058	and er it wasn't it be more the fact that it there be yeah no english sign it just
S0057	really
S0058	yeah it have a very odd

S0057	what be i do tomorrow
S0058	tomorrow be a quiet day as in you um we start at half eight and we'll show you round see what happen and then at half nine you've get a health and safety induction which be just compulsory um but the person who do it be very nice she's call that's for about half an hour to an hour i think and then um basically we're all gonna take turn tell you a bite about the and what we do and what you'll be do and in the afternoon i'm gonna show you the kind of i'm gonna start you off i basically i've get lot of task and i'm gonna start you off on them on different days and then you can just kind of get on with them as you will just do what you want when you want um so i'm gonna start you off with one of them on monday afternoon
S0057	what's that

S0057	will i understand what they're say
S0058	yeah i'll set you off on some really nice ones to start with
S0057	be it the same as like be i just check for like theirs and there's
S0058	partly you're also check that they haven't miss any word out cos sometimes if you're transcribe an hour's long
S0057	okay
S0058	record you might miss a few word so just listen for that um sometimes they might not hear something but you know what they're you can hear what they're say cos it's particularly good if you understand geordies
S0057	mm
S0057	do you need to type it in real word or in dialect
S0058	real um oo what do you mean sort of like how it
S0057	so like things like um
