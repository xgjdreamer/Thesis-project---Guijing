S0455	yeah and the good
S0454	yes
S0455	like something
S0454	there be something in the paper in that awful echo it do have the news but an awful paper erm about that new cycleway from
S0454	you know we be say they be consult on it a couple of weeks ago
S0452	mm
S0454	well apparently that's all be agree now
S0455	oh right
S0454	and it's go through the two main cemeteries on road
S0455	be it
S0454	i don't i can't think where they be though
S0455	mm so that be better
S0454	it will be better than the er what you have to do now you know
S0455	yeah
S0454	you know sort of bits
S0454	on a pavement alongside a very busy main road a proper cycle path
S0452	they're like really
S0454	yes yeah so it's sensible what they've suggest
S0452	mm set you away from the traffic
S0454	yes that's right
S0455	we should all be cycle a lot more shouldn't we
S0452	mm
S0455	there hasn't
S0454	yes
S0455	it i mean it's take off into the cities
S0455	you know the young people but really we all need to do more
S0454	yes that's right er when they build roads they really need to build cycle paths as part of it
S0452	mm yes yeah
S0455	mm
S0454	not try and retro fit it years later
S0452	not yeah cos they subtract them from the
S0455	no
S0454	mm
S0452	car
S0454	yeah
S0452	which then you can't get
S0454	no they've get to do it at the time like holland
S0455	yes
S0452	mm
S0454	it be excellent there wasn't it
S0455	and copenhagen yes and copenhagen be very good in the city centre
S0454	mm
S0455	mm
S0452	erm could you pass the bread please
S0455	mm
S0454	mm nice
S0455	mm it be nice it's get nice sort of bits in it hasn't it
S0454	yes
S0452	yes it's actually get four spoon could put a bite more in
S0455	you see that's good you've do half half cos that actually be as good as have a hundred percent wholemeal
S0452	yeah
S0452	well if a hundred percent mean you don't eat it
S0454	yes that's true
S0452	then fifty percent would be better than a hundred percent
S0454	that's true
S0452	cos you're have
S0455	mm
S0452	half of it
S0454	yes
S0452	instead of none of it
S0455	that be very nice
S0454	it be nice
S0455	cos i try and cut down at tea time
S0454	oh dear that's bad
S0455	yes
S0454	and do you erm don't have to chop all the seed up
S0452	no er er no
S0454	no they just come like that
S0452	i've get i've get get a packet
S0454	ah they're already chop
S0452	yeah they're like pumpkin seed
S0454	ah that's good ah yes that's good
S0452	sesame seed and sunflower seed
S0454	cos that'd be annoy
S0454	yes
S0455	well you might decide to make bread and
S0454	yes i might and you can always use gluten free flour
S0455	ah yes
S0454	if you be worry about it
S0454	it doesn't rise as well but you can just add more yeast
S0452	mm
S0455	mm
S0454	yes and i think a lot of it be just the way that modern bread be make
S0455	mm
S0454	that's too fast that
S0455	mm
S0454	that it's change cos you don't leave it leave it to
S0455	yes
S0454	prove or rise or whatever it's call
S0455	mm
S0452	yeah prove
S0454	but that do make sense doesn't it because it be a it be a well not bacteria yeast isn't it it's fungus be it
S0452	mm mm well alive
S0454	yes and it take time
S0452	mm
S0454	so if you then take that stage out
S0452	yeah
S0455	mm
S0454	then something different's happen to the food
S0455	your dad sometimes put half of it in the freezer if we're not to eat it
S0455	that's could do
S0455	but there's the best when it's fresh really good
S0454	mm
S0455	but you get use to have it a bite thicker erm so when you have er slice bread it seem very very thin
S0454	mm
S0455	slice bread
S0452	would you like a hot drink
S0454	mm yes please
S0452	herbal tea
S0454	yes please put some mint
S0455	mm ah yes there's some mint in on the window sill there's
S0454	mm
S0455	six leave
S0454	yes please
S0452	six be that what
S0455	no i'll have an ordinary tea please
S0454	i'll have er three leave
S0455	oh you only have three do you be that enough
S0454	for me it be
S0455	ah yes i don't know how many they're mean to put in
S0454	as many as you want
S0455	yeah but to be
S0455	i'll google it tonight
S0454	they normally say a sprig
S0455	oh
S0454	but i don't know how big their sprig be
S0455	but my tomatoes honestly you be right they're go to be
S0455	a really really good crop because you know they're sort of multiply all the time so er i've have today and there's still lot more flower on eighty
S0454	really
S0455	yeah
S0454	wow
S0455	so i hope they get to a good size but i think they will
S0454	mm
S0455	so it's quite excite
S0454	mm
S0455	those tomatoes just suddenly appear
S0454	then you'll panic cos won't know what to do with them all
S0455	erm no i don't i don't think so i think it'll be fine i'll i'll
S0454	mm
S0455	just you know i don't want to waste
S0454	no always make soup if it come to it
S0455	er yes that's true yes it seem a waste though doesn't it
