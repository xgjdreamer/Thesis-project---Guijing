S0686	right
S0684	from that system where they just didn't get the to comprehensive comprehensive be see as be more equitable fairer for people from different background you know that they would have to mix and you wouldn't have you wouldn't determine people's children's erm outcomes you know like career at the age of eleven on the basis of one test they do
S0686	i don't i don't think that's what grammar school do though
S0684	but they do seem to offer a better standard of education
S0686	mm
S0684	but they be very
S0686	but i don't think the standard of of education be unobtainable for comprehensive school either
S0684	no
S0686	i think you can probably look at grammar school and learn from what they be do right
S0684	but you have a much wider range of abilities in
S0686	in a comprehensive
S0684	a comprehensive
S0686	yeah but mix sort of mix ability class can hold sort of both the top and the bottom end of the
S0684	can you
S0686	of the
S0684	do you not do you not find it a problem
S0686	what mix ability
S0684	yeah
S0686	yeah i do yeah i think i think it's for both end of the class
S0684	you wish you could have be in a class where everybody want to learn
S0686	well yeah both that and sort of a class where erm more people be at the same level so i think yeah a lot erm not to be arrogant but you know there be some class a didn't find challenge erm
S0684	yeah exactly
S0686	cos of like the level that they be pitch to and i'm sure
S0684	because of the mix ability in the yeah
S0686	yeah and i'm sure some people in the class equally find that the class be you know
S0684	too difficult yeah
S0686	above yeah too difficult and you know they didn't learn learn as they should have from that so erm and then lot of people be very against like stream class though erm
S0684	yeah
S0686	due to ability
S0684	because of their ideological principles
S0686	yeah
S0685	you have stream in comprehensive school
S0686	you do for certain subject
S0685	mm
S0686	but things like so you do for maths erm from the outset and then science and english later but things like history and geography and things like that never stream
S0684	i'm all for stream
S0686	well i think it would help bring out the best in pupils to have stream class and you know there there be always the opportunity to move between those class
S0684	oh yeah
S0686	on the due to result it's just a traffic light mum
S0684	right
S0685	but in effect within comprehensive the distinction become between o level and and cse qualifications
S0684	tell me if it start to move
S0686	what be the cse
S0685	it be a it be a certificate of secondary education which be not as valid as the o level not as difficult to do
S0686	oh be that what
S0684	but gsces be half way between the two
S0686	the foundation
S0685	yeah gcses be midway between what the o level and cse be
S0686	but you do fewer o level didn't you
S0685	you could do couldn't do more than eight
S0686	yeah so
S0684	really
S0686	most people do at least ten gcse's now i think
S0685	mm mm but it mean you probably do
S0684	how many do you do
S0686	er
S0684	fourteen
S0686	fourteen yeah
S0685	probably never create a threat so they do
S0686	why
S0686	just end up do that
S0686	yeah i think they offer i didn't have i do triple science and that be an option
S0686	not an option
S0684	you do triple science
S0686	no i didn't do it as an option
S0686	i just do triple science in the same time everyone else do double science
S0686	that's the way that they use to do it and then erm i think i do art outside
S0686	outside and then i do further maths as well
S0686	so yeah i think i probably do music as well so
S0684	you do do music
S0686	can't remember whether it be inside or outside
S0684	yeah and i be discuss why you didn't get an a star why you miss it by one mark
S0684	when do i see him a while back
S0686	right
S0684	i go i must have go to see him about yeah it must have be 's parent even or something
S0686	well i know why i didn't get an a star
S0684	yeah and then he and then he go off he he be try to look for something in relation to your gcse
S0684	and he didn't find it but it doesn't matter now you know he's get what he's get
S0684	you wish you should have you could have ask for a remark you would have get eleven then
S0684	one third of a mark
S0684	yes but it would impress people more
S0685	what be your rule when you hit erm number like sixty nine
S0686	er sixty eight be the sort of borderline for a erm a viva erm
S0685	right
S0686	at degree level now
S0684	a viva
S0686	well yeah see if
S0684	to see whether you go into a first
S0686	well yeah they have they take you for an interview to see if you get into a first
S0684	so you would always have to go for an interview
S0686	erm otherwise they make the decision without you if you can't go to an interview but they tell you i've get the email about it and they say they'd erm just send to all the students and they say for borderline students they give you a ring on the even or the afternoon of the twenty third and you need to be there on the morning of the twenty fourth for the interview
S0684	what would they interview you about aspects of the modules
S0686	erm yeah general physics question
S0684	so you might get that
S0686	i doubt it but erm
S0684	you're nowhere near sixty eight
S0686	er i think just far enough away to
S0684	what about
S0686	er he might be but i think he's in glastonbury at the time so he doesn't particularly want
S0684	so when do your result come out
S0686	they give you barely twelve hours to get to manchester for a
S0684	yeah
S0686	interview which be pretty outrageous really
S0684	if you be at the other end of the country
S0686	yeah what if you're come from ireland or and international student
S0684	you would stick around
S0686	no no you have to be there
S0684	why why can't they use skype
S0686	erm because they're neanderthals
S0684	ooh
S0686	that's on tape well i don't know it's it's just there's no reason for them not to it's erm
S0685	not in this day and age it's like a conference call
S0684	be he come up
S0685	no
S0686	no there's con
S0684	do do you see in dad's list of presidents of the psychic society
S0686	yeah
S0684	that one of the early ones be the professor of physics at manchester
S0686	right i don't think that prove anything
S0684	no it doesn't they all they're the sceptics aren't they
S0685	er he wasn't
S0684	he wasn't he be a professor of physics oh boy but it wasn't call manchester university what be it call then something college
S0686	er
S0684	when be that mid nineteenth century or late nineteenth century
S0684	yeah
S0685	yeah most of them be erm there well it be set up to assess the claim of spiritualist mediums ostensibly but it quickly become a kind of science body look at non physical erm phenomenon
S0684	so he be he believe in them
S0685	yeah
S0684	and he try to find a scientific basis for them
S0686	erm
S0684	presumably
S0685	i think they be they be develop the notion of a of a kind of para science which become erm parapsychology basically
S0686	i don't think we've ever be in as good a position like in modern science and our understand of the universe to discount sort of apparent paranormal
S0684	say the first half of it again i didn't get it
S0686	i don't think we've ever be in as good a position as we be now with our understand of science and the universe to discount the scientific explanations of the paranormal
S0685	well it's interest you would have have an interest conversation with bernard carr who be the be the president when i be a member he be professor of mathematics at king's
S0686	right
S0685	and he felt that science wouldn't be able to explain it because basically there there be in operation non physical principles to
S0686	i think i've come across a couple of mathematicians erm er roger penrose include
S0685	mm
S0686	erm who's sort of erm logic and argument in relation to physics be erm sometimes er dispute by physicists themselves i think come from come at it from a mathematical perspective and come at it from sort of a physics perspective you get quite different viewpoints a lot of the time
S0685	yeah and bernard be er he be an astronomer as well
S0686	right
S0685	erm and he be er at the forefront of what one one of these particles that they be try to trap deep underground
S0686	er neutrinos
S0685	neutrinos
S0686	as an astronomer
S0685	yeah
S0686	okay
S0685	erm so he be he do a lot of work on on
S0686	what be his name
S0685	bernard carr
S0686	bernard carr right
S0684	how do you know him
S0685	well he be president he do a reference for a grant application i do
S0684	do you get it
S0685	yeah
S0686	yeah
S0685	no cos he be i be do the book on erm you know the paranormal book so i he'd invite me to give a talk on it
S0684	do he believe in the paranormal
S0685	as a as a phenomenon yeah but in and in you know he be incredulous to believe that every individual case be therefore true
S0686	what do you mean he believe in a phenomenon as in there be things that people couldn't explain
S0685	yeah
S0686	or do he believe that it could be er for example a psychological sort of a case
S0685	oh yeah yeah there's a lot of people like that
S0686	some people still think that genuinely be there
S0685	yeah yeah i do you know richard wiseman
S0686	erm yeah the name ring a bell
S0685	he be a prominent erm he he's a psychologist psychiatrist
S0686	right
S0685	er and he do a lot of work to debunk erm debunk claim through visions
S0686	okay
S0685	and spectres and things like that but you know what the society have build up over say a hundred and twenty years or whatever be this corpus of testimonials and experimental things that you know you couldn't just throw away and say that's just all delusionalism
S0686	yeah
S0685	er so you know the idea of a society be basically to sift and to try and develop a kind of scientific rigour but you know the biggest problem always be the unrepeatability of the phenomenon
S0686	i think it's an interest field to study as in like why why people do this but i think personally if i be if i be in in that field
S0684	why people do what study this or see these things
S0686	sorry why why people se these things and experience them
S0684	well dad have study it to an extent
S0686	yeah i think it's an interest field but like personally i'd be probably like come come at it from the this be false how can i show that this be false you know what other possible explanation could there be
S0684	a lot of people do that dad do it don't you
S0685	well i think all i mean it's not just be a ghost story that i've come across that couldn't have be fake but that's the nature of photography you know it's it's not erm as evidential as we assume it to be
S0686	but even if you see things with your own eye that's not even a that's no proof either be it
S0685	no no it's not no because you can have hallucinations
S0686	the brain stumble
S0684	it maybe true to you yourself personally
S0686	i don't well i don't think it can if you're rational i don't think it can be if you've get to know that you can see thing that aren't real for whatever reason
S0685	no the most persuasive erm test i've come across but again i suppose you could say there's always erm room for deceit be erm one of the members of the spr erm write a letter to the society and it be seal and give to an independent party before he die
S0686	okay
S0685	and then when he die he say that he could communicate the content of that letter in a in a séance which he do
S0685	and they open the letter and it be there
S0686	right well
S0685	so you know again you could say well that's a cunning trick
S0686	well i can think of numerous ways into which he could do it erm
S0684	can i make it no
S0685	no
S0686	as to which you know that could have be fake or to me that's not credible proof
S0685	no but the question be i mean you know which scientists have to argue be what would constitute credible proof
S0686	erm well
S0684	that could have be a big conspiracy could it
S0685	yeah that could be
S0686	well in in accordance with sort of scientific principles repeatability experiment and verification
S0685	but you can't you know
S0686	you can't prove anything but you can repeat it a thousand time and say i've do this a thousand time and it get the same result a thousand time
S0684	but a lot of phenomena don't happen like that
S0686	well that psychic or you know these paranormal phenomena don't but scientific phenomena do
S0685	yeah that's what they think that you know the argument be that you couldn't if you apply standard model of of physics or whatever to paranormal it would it would get you nowhere
S0686	yeah
S0685	so the society basically be try to come up with erm a parascience i mean that's what you could call it a pseudoscience if you like
S0686	yeah
S0685	erm in that would would spit the subject of it's enquiry which be in a sense what physics do isn't it physics grow out of the nature of the object it's scrutinise
S0686	yes and no physics i think physics erm try to find the most the most general case have you ever hear of erm occam's razor
S0685	yeah
S0686	so occam's razor be sort of take erm you have two theories erm that produce exactly the same result erm but one of them require like the of your axiom for the other and it's like be objectively simpler then the simpler one be truer in a sense rem so it's about you know if you can explain it simply erm
S0685	mm
S0686	or explain it in a really convolute way why would you explain it in a really convolute way so to me like have another branch of science that explain this rate of things that exist in our own universe and just come by the general laws at work and pretty much all circumstances so far erm why would he do that so
S0685	mm
S0686	i'm not entirely convince that create a new branch of science be really the erm the best way to explain it if it be indeed explainable beyond sort of our own what go on in our mind
S0685	mm
S0684	how do you explain things like that poltergeist thing we saw the one with the
S0685	what the enfield
S0684	the enfield yeah
S0685	erm i don't know i mean the the i think it's a mix bag that one of
S0686	how many people actually saw
S0685	oh load
S0686	this poltergeist race across the room
S0685	yeah load
S0686	okay
S0685	you know you have er
S0686	who be they
S0685	the two main er guy be maurice grosse and a guy lion treyfeld they're on the
S0684	the side again
S0685	er maurice be er an ex raf pilot
S0686	okay
S0685	bite of a bill basically
S0686	right
S0685	and an engineer and erm
S0684	we've lose time with all the delay
S0685	oh it's alright it's talk
S0684	sorry
S0685	er if you'd stop talk we get there quicker
S0684	no no it's the delay
S0685	erm guy be erm a cambridge graduate in history and i know them because i have breakfast with them
S0686	okay
S0685	at the conferences and you know if you have want the sort of the two people who be have head screw on you know they weren't kind of a one nutters
S0686	yeah
S0685	and have have a lot of experience of these things erm i mean what use to tell me about you know water would be you know sling at him it be it be quite extraordinary and it boil egg but erm when the when they start they be very reluctant to to investigate it because erm the circumstances be it be a council house in enfield
S0686	yeah
S0685	and er it be know that the mother be a single mother with about four four young children
S0686	yeah okay
S0685	one girl be go through puberty that might actually be quite crucial to it erm and some people say oh well what they be try to do then be to get out of the house so the council would give them a better house
S0686	right
S0685	so they they be sort of suppositions of you know a kind of strange motivation
S0686	yeah
S0685	erm but the spr be only get involve much later on er
S0686	how how how long be these sort of go on
S0685	it be go on for several months
S0686	okay
S0685	and it be sort of consistency and
S0686	what a third party presumably come into the house
S0685	yeah a policeman come in
S0686	and what saw
S0685	and yeah and there there be police report that say you know the policeman and a policewomen so they have corroborate report erm say a chair physically you know those big arm chair
S0686	yeah
S0685	come at them erm and no you know nobody around push it just come at them
S0686	mm
S0685	and erm and another one get hit in the er head quite erm hard by a lego brick
S0686	okay
S0685	erm that just sort of appear and hit him
S0686	yeah
S0685	and there be things like matchboxes would catch fire in drawers erm there be pool of water where there shouldn't have be there be lot of these kind of odd phenomenon that be take place erm the girls er be see to levitate erm a book in one in their bedroom mysteriously appear in the bedroom in the house next door
S0686	a book
S0685	a book
S0686	okay
S0685	erm so that what that be what be technically call a port where an object would disappear from one realm and appear in another so they bring in m
S0686	
S0685	come later because he be the more sceptical of both of them but he think that this be a the kid be actually just play trick
S0686	yeah
S0685	as kid you know do erm but then when they get there erm you know they they have all it be all the kind of hallmarks you know the typical kind of bookcases where you know camera batteries ensemble erm er simply didn't work you know they they all all the power drain out of them even though they have power them all up before they get there
S0686	yeah
S0686	er tape recorders would suddenly switch off and not be able to switch back on erm it be just you know if you put in the in his paper on this he have the original tape recorder and the original tape and he play it and within two minutes it so erm anyway it become increasingly centre upon the girl erm who they believe be possess by a guy call bill
S0686	right what what basis do they have for this
S0685	er because he speak to her
S0686	speak through her
S0685	through her
S0686	right okay
S0685	erm in a voice that wasn't hers
S0686	okay
S0685	and so the explanation for that be that they get eventually and it say well probably what she be use we do actually have two larynxes one which actually doesn't get use
S0686	okay
S0685	which erm so which you ventriloquists use so you you don't actually open your mouth but sound can come out so when she be speak when bill be speak through her she er she have this kind of rough right this kind of east end london accent and he be you know swear like a trooper he be quite a nasty bloke
S0686	right
S0685	and he be basically tell everyone to get out of his house erm and they do find out that there be someone in in the house call bill
S0686	okay
S0685	and er he tell them that he he die in a chair and they find out that that be true as well
S0684	gosh
S0685	erm and you know he say he be he be basically the one who be behind it all
S0686	okay
S0685	erm but exorcism didn't work in this case and the phenomenon simply die out but it go on for over a year
S0686	i do just think there's same you know some things which i can't immediately think of an explanation for especially when you to things like large object that really
S0685	yeah
S0686	erm you know conceivably someone could throw a lego brick at someone quite hard and not you know be in the room erm armchairs move you know for a third party as well you know
S0685	yeah
S0685	well they have you know the
S0686	professionals who come in come in and be sceptical about
S0685	yeah i mean they have to write a police report of what happen basically you know so they they have a a motivation of integrity and i think sometime the girls would play up you know they they they'd kind of do things that work with the ghost but the girls be actually very scar by this
S0686	yeah
S0685	erm but it be you now it it's an interest thing but more interest i think
S0686	but what do you what do you think
S0685	i don't know i mean i i think
S0684	be it
S0686	no you should have go on the
S0684	yeah no when when they indicate leave i think they be go to turn leave
S0686	well they they to turn leave
S0684	there be as pint there be a lay by to pull up that be a bite you know i would have go but because it be turn leave i think you know i won't i won't overtake but i confuse the signal
S0685	no i don't i don't know what i make of it really erm because the character of bill i mean this be a thirteen year old girl what bill be say through her be very adult so either you know there be some kind of very intrigue multiple personality disorder take place there
S0686	which be not beyond the realms of possibility
S0685	no it's not
S0686	people with tourette's you know
S0685	yeah
S0686	erm schizophrenia
S0685	yeah erm and there there's a tendency for poltergeist to attract themselves to erm to young people go through puberty
S0686	that's that's odd
S0685	well it might be that
S0686	correlation
S0685	yeah there might be a kind of energy so for example you might say er it's like what what
S0686	what do you mean by this i find sort of quite unscientific
S0685	yeah some some people would say we it's actually not a ghost it be actually the girl do it herself telekinetically that she's actually move object around herself via a kind of force
S0684	but that would probably not believe in telekinesis
S0686	i i don't er
S0684	but could could it be that there be an explanation we what you call a scientific explanation for these things erm that we haven't discover yet
S0686	erm it seem unlikely because you talk about these things which you haven't discover yet and you may use historical examples like erm you know einstein didn't you know it's because he and discover you know someone hadn't discover something but i think we're at a point now they didn't back then they know that they didn't know a lot about the universe it build up like explain sort of
S0684	yeah no
S0686	erm so in term of
S0686	in term of phenomenon sort of explain sort of explain erm electric and magnetic field i don't see any reason cos that's what you know it take to be erase you know things like camera batteries to be drain immediately and things like that but it sound like erm the presence of a large electric electromagnetic area
S0684	well it could but i suppose again the problem there be what it it's cause
S0686	yeah absolutely i don't i don't know you know that there should be necessarily a particular
S0684	be you go out
S0684	no
S0685	erm yeah the most intrigue one i've come across be what be callus a soul experiment which be do over three years erm and that be a group of so call mediums who meet in school which be a place up in i think it be in london and they actively invite erm scientists
S0684	oh close
S0685	erm
S0686	gps
S0684	psychologists erm conjurers who be always invite with the spr to come to do séances
S0686	okay
S0684	cos scientists be often dupe whereas conjurers could see sleight of hand
S0686	yeah yeah
S0684	erm that be the case do you know william do you know william cook
S0686	erm
S0684	nineteenth century scientist who invent the cathode ray tube
S0686	yeah yeah
S0684	erm he be thoroughly convince of it and he use to have séances in his house
S0686	right
S0684	erm and there be a manifestation of this young woman erm who be a you know a physical manifestation she could be touch and that happen over three years
S0686	right
S0684	but i mean that's another story that be interest because he be erm he be one of the most distinguish physicists of his day
S0686	yeah
S0684	erm and he have anyway have big faraday
S0684	really
S0686	yeah
S0684	there's a dramatisation of the enfield haunt on now tv if you want to see it
S0686	okay
S0685	yeah we should watch that actually
S0684	it's matthew macfadyen and timothy spall it's very good
S0685	guy didn't like it at all he think it be far too erm
S0686	sensationalist
S0685	no he think it it simply wasn't true to the intensity of what be take place
S0684	what it be less intense
S0685	no it be more intense
S0684	ah
S0685	than that anyway the scole experiment be erm it be conduct in the cellar and erm richard wiseman who be actually an a a a a sceptic
S0686	okay
S0685	a very very bright man he be invite to it as well so they get you know all the people who be likely to be able to defame them and see you know the trick be do and erm the protocols around that be probably the most intense that have ever be establish for
S0686	when when be this
S0685	nineteen nineties
S0686	okay
S0685	and erm they have a whole range of things the they would have a lot of it be do through trance erm in other word people communicate to the other side so call through through a trance but the voice be what be call remote voice manifestations so in other word other rather than come through the mouth of the medium these voice come from different part of the room
S0686	okay
S0685	erm and so the experiment be to ask for evidence irrefutable evidence and that be what the scole experiment be design to do
S0686	what what what sort of monitor what do they set up in the room
S0685	erm
S0686	heat camera presumably
S0685	there be heat cameras but it have to be do in the dark
S0686	why
S0685	erm because those on the other side things particularly where they be transfer in transfer image they wouldn't be able to do it now that's always be the major criticism of the scole experiment
S0686	yeah
S0685	that it be do in the dark although you know the the the root
S0686	it be slightly convenient isn't it
S0685	well it do i mean it that that's the bite that i find although you know richard wiseman who be also a conjurer
S0686	okay
S0685	he do a thorough examination of the room
S0686	okay
S0685	and there be no secret you know there be no kind of projectors or anything leave you know in there so that that that be as watertight as you could possibly be
S0686	yeah
S0685	short of do it in a or something like that you wouldn't be able to do it erm and he doesn't have an explanation for it i mean he doesn't
S0686	well they hear these voice
S0685	they they all
S0686	do they see anything
S0685	erm they saw light
S0686	right
S0685	which be little orb of light which would erm be hover in the room and you know first say oh god you know that's fibre optics or something you know
S0686	yeah
S0685	but they weren't because he say you know he could erm speak to a light and say come to my hand and it would and it would rest in his hand it would have no weight
S0686	right
S0685	and then it would pass through his hand and then through the table into the floor and that happen on lot of on lot of occasion
S0686	right
S0685	erm there be object
S0686	but how many time do they do do this
S0685	oh load over three years
S0686	okay
S0685	there be many of these experiment with lot of different people erm
S0686	what be they call the scole experiment
S0685	the scole experiment
S0686	okay
S0685	and then they be ask so these these light erm you know as i say would would come they would they would be at the bid of the people who be sit around it
S0686	okay i'm i'm still sceptical but erm
S0685	well i i wasn't there i mean i mean just think if you be there what would you make of it
S0686	yeah absolutely
S0685	you know
S0686	do they have like erm electric and magnetic field detectors
S0685	i don't know what what the paraphernalia be there but
S0686	okay
S0685	erm
S0686	cos you you'd have think well i'd have think i i be set up that experiment i'd want to know everything about what be go on in that room erm i'd want i'd want a heat map i'd want an electric field map i'd want a magnetic field map erm
S0685	yeah yeah
S0686	erm i'd want a sound map you know i'd want
S0685	yeah they they they have er video cameras go all the time in the dark
S0686	what do they pick up
S0685	er light
S0686	they the same light
S0685	not the same light no shape geometries
S0686	right
S0685	erm be appear on them er later on they have er unprocessed film in seal box which have be seal not by the erm the mediums but by the experiment the people who be observe the experiment
S0686	okay
S0685	and when they process them er they have write and image on them erm but one of the most remarkable ones be this erm it be dark and then they hear this thump on the table and there be this copy of the daily mirror form nineteen forty one absolutely pristine
S0686	right
S0685	and of course people think it's just one of those reprint so they actually take it to an analyst and say no this be actually paper that be print in nineteen forty one the ink be from nineteen forty one but there be no yellow or anything
S0686	okay
S0685	i mean i suppose the supposition be that that's a kind of temporal as well as spatial transference
S0686	mm okay
S0685	and they do be just the sheer weight of evidence that be so compel to some people i suppose
S0684	what do you think
S0685	i don't know
S0686	i think i'd want to do a bite more read into it but
S0684	i'm sure there's a lot on the internet
S0686	yeah
S0685	oh there be and there there be erm the society actually produce it's own erm review of it which be that thick erm but i i suppose where i part company which be why i leave company with the society be that i felt it would be become
S0685	it it be enthusiastic about prove things than disprove things
S0686	right
S0685	and i know
S0686	yeah it's very dangerous when you have a
S0685	it be and the thing that
S0686	agenda
S0685	seal it for me cos i be you know we be talk about phenomenon i say have we ever consider demon possession and they say oh no demons don't exist i think right i can see where you're come from that's your presupposition
S0685	so i think i don't want any more of this this be just you know this be just go nowhere
S0686	well it's it's bad science to cos obviously every scientist come at it with with a bias or an expectation but you know for you know for the society to have a an agenda be
S0685	well i think it be adrift to to erm
S0686	yeah
S0685	one or two individuals i think it's probably quite different now and i and i sort of i have half in mind at one point to get back in contact with them but erm erm i remember when i go up to the erm when i do that london tour in the serpentine a couple of months ago
S0686	okay
S0685	we go i go back to the er college of psychic study which be erm really where a lot of of i mean the college of psychic science study be the sort of a parallel to the society of psychical research
S0686	mm
S0685	and you talk you know you you get lot of kind of strange people turn up to these things erm and you know begin to realise that there there there's a strong element of credulity up there and it it you know there be there be some interest paper on erm psychology you know like the things that you're say about psychological explanations
S0686	well the the human mind it's extraordinarily powerful in how it remember things
S0685	yeah
S0686	as well as what we see and you know erm they've do you know i think it's pretty they've do study about you know the way that we remember events and that we change what we remember you know even detail of a of a car or something because i know that that's particularly erm relevant in erm in court case
S0684	mm
S0686	for example where they prove that you know an eyewitness
S0684	mm
S0686	doesn't always you know even if they're convince about that what they saw be not always what be there erm
S0684	that's that's
S0686	the power of suggestion be always very erm
S0684	that's remember i so that's memory but
S0686	well memories change even if you think you saw something you know it's the way that you remember it change
S0684	yeah yeah sure but at the time you experience what you think be a paranormal phenomenon you must believe that at the time
S0686	yeah sure i i don't i don't doubt that the power of what you believe be
S0684	you know what what colour dress somebody be wear you might not have pay much attention to it because it be a different kind of experience isn't it
S0686	it be but at the same time you know your your brain can trick you into see things that aren't there hear things that aren't there that you know that's well document in you know especially people who have you you hear voice for examples you know you be actually hear things that aren't there
S0685	but what be interest with the scole experiment be that the people they be contact say they be scientists
S0686	right
S0685	er that they'd be scientist in the previous life and they be communicate design erm for something call what be it call a transdimensional communicator i think this be star trek i mean no scientist would ever call something a transdimensional communicator and if you look at the design basically it's a series of germanium transistors erm
S0686	oh right
S0685	just a little bite more kind of sophisticate than a you know the sort of thing that mark honey would have put put together
S0684	well maybe there be some that type of at the time
S0685	well maybe yeah but i mean
S0686	but you wouldn't have call it that it sound daft
S0686	that sound one of the most unconvincing things about the whole
S0685	yeah
S0684	but why would they have give it a an unconvincing name if they if they be somebody be pull
S0686	if someone yeah someone be pull the wool over someone's eye you wouldn't it wouldn't have be a scientist and they and they've have call it something sound likely
S0685	well it's something that do appear to have some sort of science kudos about it and and mystique you know mystique be very important in all of this
S0684	the children tell me that that that that a bite more
S0686	well exactly and more than a couple of germanium transistors
S0684	germanium transistors
S0685	well it's a thing that you put in blood clot
S0684	not in your garden
S0685	no
S0686	it be obviously someone with a very very basic
S0685	effect box of germanium transistors and they give off a certain
S0684	why be it call germanium
S0686	because it's the main metal there
S0685	but it it's that make for a fascinate read
S0686	yeah i will i will be read it for fun i think it's interest if only to
S0685	i mean this society wasn't that uncritical of it you know it it it didn't feel as they felt that the the insistence on darkness be suspicious
S0686	yeah
S0684	who who carry it out
S0685	erm there be just a husband and wife medium team and they they they
S0684	they do the scole experiment
S0685	no i mean they have lot of other people er scientists and erm parapsychologist and others who be come to
S0686	to me the most likely explanation that it be a massive hoax very clever but
S0685	well if it be erm and i've talk to about this he say he couldn't get to the bottom i mean he know he's a conjurer i mean he you know he'd be he's someone who talk to you know david copperfield and others you know about how they do their illusions
S0686	right well i i i've watch david copperfield and erm who be the other one david blaine and people like that do some of the things that they do and i can't figure out how they do it
S0685	mm mm no i've see
S0686	but i don't think it's anything magical or anything like that
S0685	no no no it's not i mean i it's it's it's
S0684	they don't claim that
S0685	no it's it's very it's very clever i think youtube videos you can slow em down and you can't tell how they do it
S0686	yeah
S0685	erm but be absolutely he say you know he doesn't believe in it but he can't explain it
S0686	yeah right i think that's a perfectly valid position er i do i do believe that there be a side to the explanation out
S0685	the odd thing be in the nineteenth century these band of people who would talk to you form the other side they be all artists now they're all scientists
S0686	yeah
S0684	that be that be a bite tell
S0685	no well it be might be a bite tell but of course in those in the nineteenth century what the artists would do be communicate picture instant picture
