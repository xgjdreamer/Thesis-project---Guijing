S0164	mm if they're do in the oven anyway
S0064	i know
S0164	some people microwave their jacket potatoes and they ought to be take outside and shoot
S0064	well no if you're at work and you've not get an oven to do it in you can do it like that
S0164	do it in the oven at home the night before and then warm it up but don't cook it in the
S0064	no warm up isn't nice warm up go like leather
S0164	well then have it cook no you can't it's not a jacket potato if you microwave it
S0064	it's leathery
S0164	it's not it's a perversion
S0027	i honestly have no opinion on jacket opinions
S0064	well i think we might be about to have a fight on it so
