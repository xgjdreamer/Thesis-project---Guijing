S0012	ah
S0008	and you would i i be sort of think about it if that be if the one 0 one be build there
S0013	they'd have put it on
S0012	they'd have put that on
S0008	that that would've be the one what be on the sign i'd have think but
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then i dunno if this bloke didn't know either so i sort of keep this aura of
S0008	be know what i be talk about
S0012	you have to don't you
S0013	mm
S0008	that's what i hate about 's erm er samsung galaxy tab cos when i sort of say things like that she'll say hang on a minute open this

S0008	you know it doesn't really matter you know
S0008	but yeah whatever i say
S0012	she look it up now do she
S0008	she look it up now cos there's so so
S0008	often i've sort of say things which have
S0008	turn out to be wrong but with such an air of authority about it that
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i'm even like doubt my own
S0012	knowledge now
S0008	knowledge
S0013	oh dear
S0012	well er that's easily do i mean i've i've say stuff to you that i think be right and you have correct me

S0008	well this be the funny thing ain't it
S0013	mm
S0008	some stories you hear like when you're a kid
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm
S0008	like an uncle might say something and you take it as gospel and you repeat it all your life
S0012	you do yeah
S0008	and then you find out that
S0013	and er yeah
S0008	it wasn't really
S0012	it wasn't right yeah
S0013	i be convince florence nightingale be part of our family
S0013	and i tell everyone you know school and
S0008	and she wasn't
S0013	apparently not i don't know where i get it from

S0013	er she could've be but
S0008	be your family call nightingale
S0013	well i'm only take their word for it that she wasn't now
S0012	yeah course you be
S0008	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	well you'd have to you'd have to
S0013	look it up
S0012	go er go into that ancestry thing
S0013	mm
S0012	that cost a fortune don't it
S0008	well it cost money i'm not sure a fortune be
S0012	not an well it depend how far you want to go back
S0008	mm but there's so many sit now that
S0013	there be
S0008	it's like the army sit and things like that
S0012	mm
S0008	have all open up and the census that only cost like i think er a fiver for ten search or something like that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	do it oh
S0008	and like yeah obviously if you wanna do more than ten search
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	well it's erm you know it be a i mean that
S0013	give you a start doesn't it
S0008	you know it's not a fiver for ten search but
S0013	mm
S0008	it's that sort of it's that sort of level of price if you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know they give you like
S0013	mm
S0008	it might be a fiver for one day or something like that so
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	something like that i'm not sure but i think you're right when you say you know if you be on it all the time
S0012	mm
S0008	and you'd have to sign up for all of these different sit
S0012	you do yeah cos i know next door go into it and she find it really difficult
S0013	mm
S0012	cos they'll go so far i mean this be just her site she go on i don't know about the rest
S0008	mm
S0012	they'll go so far and then say that'll cost you extra if you want to go to there
S0008	oh right yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah there's one yeah there's several sit i know
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i mean my family history's all be work or my father's family history be all work out by someone else anyway
S0012	be it oh that be alright
S0013	yeah
S0008	and i think you'll find that as well
S0013	yeah our family my
S0008	the more more yeah well if you look into it you sort of contact someone with the same name
S0013	mm
S0008	and they say oh well we've already do all this you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	we'll send you the
S0013	yeah my cousin's do it in great detail hasn't he
S0008	mm
S0012	he's but we really we'd like to get a copy of it you know
S0008	oh right
S0013	but that's kind of he have work very hard on it you think mm that's not really fair be it
S0012	and and the er
S0008	can't won't he won't he just send you a copy
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm probably will if you ask him
S0008	or what you wanna do be ask him whether you could borrow it
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	to to to study it
S0012	mm
S0008	and then make make your own copy
S0013	well he's very keen isn't he
S0012	yeah
S0013	he's very keen all the time you know he bring something
S0012	well he go back to this big family who be they call the the
S0013	oh the s be on television the other
S0012	family and they be on television be the biggest builders in the country at the time
S0008	oh right
S0013	er they be the longest run
S0012	the
S0013	they're still go
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	and yeah they be still go yeah
S0013	from great great great grandma
S0012	and the family well 's family come from some of the s i've even get a picture of granny ain't i
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah so we can go quite right the way back really
S0008	mm well my mother work out hers through her mother no it wasn't it be through her her father
S0012	mm
S0008	and erm she work it out you know right back to i think it's something like sixteen eighty ain't it when the parish record first begin
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know to get back past that it's quite difficult unless you be relate to some
S0012	yeah
S0008	aristocracy you can
S0012	yeah lord or ladies or whatever
S0008	who who erm keep record and
S0012	mm
S0008	of course when they sell land or pass land down
S0012	yeah
S0008	you could go down through the will
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know cos er they all have to have will and these little document
S0013	yeah
S0008	so you can go back past this sort of this cut of point of whenever it be
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it's much more difficult
S0012	mm
S0008	and like when you consider most people don't come from the aristocracy anyway
S0008	well so they're say most people be relate to everyone else anyway aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they reckon if you go back far enough you're relate to everybody
S0012	well there's suppose to have only be two families in this in this whole world and
S0008	mm well that's you know one theory but that's be change recently
S0012	that's be change have it
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh well they decide it be two families
S0013	mm
S0012	one from africa and one from europe
S0008	mm
S0012	and that be it but it do make you wonder
S0008	mm well you know it could be right i mean like if you think about a tribe as a family
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	but they're find out more and more about
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	but there can't have be two i mean otherwise you wouldn't get
S0013	be more than that
S0012	the diversity of look would you i mean your chinese and and er japanese
S0008	yeah well the chinese the latest theory be be that the you know they all reckon that there be a migration out of africa dunno how long ago how many thousands of years ago tens of thousands they always reckon there be one which sort of come up through the middle east branch off there then go up through europe and then come er into europe
S0012	mm
S0008	but already in europe be neanderthal
S0012	yeah
S0008	people right
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	and also they find out they'd there be not only neanderthal people there be this other type of people as well in asia well no in in well i suppose it be asia
S0013	mm
S0008	but sort of north asia
S0013	right
S0012	yeah
S0008	that sort of area and they be the denisovans
S0012	be it
S0008	right who be
S0013	mm
S0008	this other sorta offshoot of neanderthal denisovans and then you get modern man sorta come up and slowly these other two branch sorta die out but on the other hand they reckon there be a lot of interbreed go on between em anyway
S0012	there must've be mustn't there
S0008	cos they be very sorta similar type
S0012	i mean it happen in
S0008	they be a very sorta similar type of
S0013	yeah
S0008	people but but now they're say that something like half a million years before that there be this other branch of people come out of africa which be also modern man which then go up round the coast of asia india china through the the straits you know all the
S0012	yeah
S0008	all the islands and that branch then get intermingle with the modern people and they're sort of like still there you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's you know i mean
S0012	well they say that the
S0008	when they talk about people come out of africa they aren't talk about like one bloke
S0012	no they're not
S0008	with his wife you know what i mean
S0012	well
S0008	you're you're talk about you know sort of
S0013	mm
S0008	well you're talk about hundreds over
S0012	of course you be yeah
S0008	time span of hundreds if not thousands of years
S0012	cos they've think the inuits
S0013	you think yeah
S0012	they come from er china
S0013	mm
S0008	i don't know but they reckon that it's like the north american and south american indians they don't know er how they get there now
S0012	no
S0008	you know they sort of always assume they come in at you know a certain period in time and sort of start
S0013	mm
S0008	colonise
S0012	mm
S0008	er north america
S0013	mm
S0008	and slowly move down into south america and they have it all sussed out then they suddenly find remain which be something like fifty thousand years earlier than that
S0012	mm yeah
S0008	and they say oh well perhaps they weren't the first perhaps there be these other ones
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they reckon
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah cos there's cos erm people up in northern er like greenland and place like that be chinese like
S0008	mm well i think the the the the sort of basic physical characteristics be only a very very minor
S0012	yeah
S0008	alteration
S0013	mm
S0008	in the dna
S0012	mm
S0008	you know what i mean it's just miniscule so like the
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	the facial characteristics and like like you can't really
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	you can't really sort of go by that i mean to a certain extent you can because they've probably get genes that don't happen somewhere else you know but
S0012	mm
S0008	you never know you see er you could get just like one gene suddenly alter
S0012	yeah
S0008	right and that gene be sort of carry on and you know through thousands of years it just take over er you know if there's a particularly strong gene
S0012	mm
S0008	cos that's what they reckon don't they they reckon some genes be stronger than others and er
S0012	they do and i remember when we be at school we be do we be do er that type of thing and this teacher i can't think of his name i usually know all the name this teacher say we be gradually grow another finger
S0013	oh i hear that
S0012	you hear that have you
S0013	yeah i don't see how you can think that
S0013	weird isn't it
S0012	and we say where he say it'll that'll become at this end
S0008	mm
S0012	so why because we we've be hundred and thousands of years with five finger or four finger and a thumb
S0008	mm
S0012	and that work well don't it
S0008	mm
S0012	why would you want another one
S0013	mm
S0012	because
S0008	no
S0012	that'd get in the way wouldn't it
S0008	well the thing be be that there's plenty of people who've be bear with a mutation with an extra finger
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	or an extra toe
S0012	yeah or even web hand
S0008	but that hasn't take off have it it hasn't like
S0012	no
S0012	no
S0008	hasn't sort of spread through at all
S0013	but do we descend from the ape or not for a start off i mean where do they
S0012	what be we look at
S0008	oh there's a buzzard outside
S0012	yeah there be a buzzard about here yeah
S0013	and where do the ape come from
S0012	what
S0013	do we descend from the ape and where do the ape come from you know
S0008	well no
S0012	mm
S0008	darwin never do say we descend from the ape
S0013	well where do we come from
S0008	he say that it's a diversion from the
S0012	yeah
S0008	like you know you get this sort of tree where these sort of divergent species come off and like right at the top
S0013	mm
S0008	there's sort of man go one way and ape go the other way
S0012	yeah
S0008	so they didn't sorta like ape and then man come from the ape
S0013	yeah
S0012	well they've find a they call it lucy haven't they
S0008	well that be a long while ago er that be lucy
S0012	yeah that be a long while ago
S0008	yeah
S0012	but she's get the er same type of erm forehead as an ape
S0008	mm
S0012	and she er
S0008	yeah but you see the whole thing about this business if you read something one year
S0012	yeah totally different next year
S0008	the next year it's just totally different
S0013	yeah
S0008	cos there be this really famous erm
S0012	do you want another one
S0008	no that's alright you have it
S0012	good
S0008	there be this really famous archaeologist right
S0012	yeah
S0008	i think his name be skinner and er he's about my age but when he leave school he or when he leave university he have this theory about it's you know before the time of dna or anything like that nobody anything about that he have this theory about now what the hell be it it be all to do with skulls and sorta like of early man neanderthal stuff like that and he go round every museum and scientific or er place in in erm well which be around which have
S0012	yeah
S0008	early skulls you know i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	we're talk about skulls from
S0012	donkey's years ago yeah
S0008	you know sixty odd thousand
S0012	mm
S0008	or more years ago and er even even in eastern europe and russia this be you know when the iron curtain be still up
S0012	mm
S0008	and he become this massive in later life a massive expert on you know human history
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know ancient human history and how
S0012	oh right
S0008	cos he'd he'd work on these skulls and he'd he have these new theories where he could date them and relate them and stuff like this from you know the different aspects of them
S0012	mm
S0008	like the teeth and the and er cheekbones and god know what you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	and and he'd sorta spend all his life you know you know dedicate to this branch and you know he be wildly acclaim because
S0012	yeah
S0008	he sort it you know he sort of more or less solve load of sorta theories or he didn't solve em but he give a basis for other people to judge against and stuff like that
S0012	mm prove them yeah yeah
S0008	and then about i suppose ten year ago when they bring in dna test
S0012	yeah
S0008	and stuff like that you know it just sorta wipe all his work out
S0012	yeah it would do erm well yeah
S0008	cos you know you can do everything that he'd spend all his life study and relate just do draw one tooth and you know er er half an hour later you get the dna
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	test and not only dna but they can
S0012	oh
S0008	like teeth be the most indestructible thing apparently
S0012	they be aren't they yeah
S0008	and er you can grind them up and do isotope analysis on em
S0012	oh can you oh right
S0008	and tell where the people be bear where you know where they live
S0012	all cos of what they be eat and stuff like that yeah
S0008	and that's right yeah because you absorb these minute
S0012	you do yeah
S0008	trace of these er earth isotopes
S0008	when you're eat and you know cos in er the construction of your teeth
S0013	mm
S0008	and er but he be really please you know you'd think he'd be you know gutted
S0012	devastate
S0008	you're devastate that
S0012	yeah
S0008	all his work be for you know he could've just sit at home and
S0012	knit
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah
S0012	but er
S0008	but he be really please cos he be a scientist and
S0012	yeah
S0008	one thing scientists like
S0012	yes i suppose
S0008	be things be be able to prove things or test things and what have you
S0012	prove things yeah yeah that's right didn't they just recently i think it be that they they've find a fully form body in er a er peat bog in northern ireland or something haven't they
S0008	well they're forever find them
S0012	they be aren't they yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and also in holland
S0012	yeah there's erm
S0008	they be quite a few er you know man be in holland
S0012	yeah yeah that's right
S0013	mm
S0008	and you know cos er now they cos like er i think when they be deposit i'm not hundred percent sure but i'm not but you know a lot of northern europe be one complete landmass
S0012	yeah
S0008	i'm not sure whether that be that long ago that'd be pre ice age wouldn't it
S0012	it would be
S0008	well anyway yeah they're sort of now the problem be be er well the thing they're try to work out be what they're do you know why they be there you know
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	cos they don't know whether they be sacrifice or
S0012	that's right
S0013	mm
S0008	or whether they be criminals or
S0012	yeah
S0008	it do look like they be sacrifice because in holland they've find sort of like young girls
S0012	oh crikey
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	have be in peat bog
S0012	oh well
S0013	mm
S0012	but there there be a rumour er i don't know how true this be but you know erm hall
S0008	mm
S0012	there use to be a big er and that go on just er wartime and that get destroy by fire i think from but when they when they be excavate they find seven lead casket now i don't know how true it be
S0008	mm
S0012	but they reckon that when they open these lead casket these people be seven foot tall
S0012	and all it be be a load of jelly inside
S0008	mm
S0012	you know all melt cos there be no air or anything
S0008	mm
S0012	and er tell us this
S0013	mm
S0012	cos he he's he's get history of erm
S0013	oh yeah
S0012	yeah and er
S0008	make an easy
S0012	yes
S0008	coffin lead coffin
S0012	lead lead coffin i mean why would they make lead coffin donkey's years ago
S0013	be it write down
S0008	well no they use to didn't they
S0012	they reckon they be vikings but i don't know
S0008	mm dunno it's quite likely they could be seven foot tall
S0012	yeah
S0008	or you know six foot eight they'd call it seven foot wouldn't they
S0012	they would wouldn't they yeah well you shrink over your age don't you
S0013	mm
S0008	but erm you know the romans use lead coffin as well didn't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	i mean for the rich ones
S0012	yeah
S0008	the poor ones just get a sack i expect
S0012	and they just get a sack yeah
S0008	if that
S0012	yeah be that where that say come you just get the sack
S0008	no don't think
S0013	no don't think so
S0012	no the the lord of the manor have you do in you see
S0012	stick you in a sack
S0013	mm
S0012	that's a weird say though ain't it you get the sack do it mean that
S0008	well perhaps it's just maybe to take your
S0013	do you get a payment sack of money
S0008	to take your goods away or your
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	belong away
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah i would think so
S0008	mm
S0012	or maybe a bite of grain
S0012	in the sack
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah there's some yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but i mean this history thing i i use to be really really interest in history
S0008	mm
S0012	when i be younger miss mrs miss her name be and er she be er she be a good history teacher but she be also an ri teacher
S0008	oh yeah
S0012	you know so the both of em get muddle up i think
S0012	but she be she be good

S0013	well there's a lot of history in ri isn't there
S0012	well i suppose there be a lot of history in ri
S0008	you get the er
S0013	mainly the fight
S0008	old testament ain't you
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	all the rap pillage and kill go on
S0013	yeah
S0012	she be a lovely teacher
S0013	there's always be trouble over there
S0008	you what
S0013	well there's always be trouble hasn't there israel and palestine

S0008	they all sort of have these sort of plan of their own
S0012	yeah
S0008	ideas to get them into power
S0012	yeah
S0008	but they'd form all these coalitions with various other general and then attack them to sort of get rid of the opposition

S0008	erm to attack him
S0012	oh i see
S0008	and then he then he'd be kill then someone else'd be top dog and then like you get two of em together say like what we'll do be like we'll both rule we'll just then we can get rid of all the others

S0008	i've i've i mean and i i've notice that from years and years ago you know like if you want to say if you decide you want to do some sort of christmas thing you know way of make money

S0008	come up to christmas and you be gonna do this by have hydrogen fill balloon with a print logo on it right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you want someone to make them
S0013	mm
S0008	if you go onto alibaba there's thousands of firm who make them for like fifty p a hundred and stuff like that all print off
S0012	wow
S0008	and send it to you
S0013	mm
S0008	it's it's just full of company who'll make anything or if you want a little cog or something or you want little plastic ball or you want a
S0012	yeah
S0008	cardboard box and all
S0012	oh wow
S0008	anything
S0013	mm
S0008	you know er this alibaba cos i mean that be only one bite of alibaba
S0012	yeah
S0008	the fact that there's all these firm in china and hong kong
S0013	yeah
S0008	who be will to do business with anybody in the world
S0012	well of course they be
S0008	at dirt price
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know dirt you know at really low price
S0013	mm
S0008	and er the other bite be they sort of serve as amazon and ebay for chinese people as well
S0012	oh right
S0008	it's it's amaze the cos they reckon in
S0013	oh
S0008	china this company alright it all belong to one bloke
S0012	yeah oh er right yeah
S0008	who's really but apparently they say in china it's do wonder for the rural economy
S0012	yeah
S0008	because before you have all these villages where people be live hand to mouth
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know like every family's get like three acres and they spend all the year grow food just to eat and nothing leave over
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they're say all their children be then see no future in it and then leave to move to these cities
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	but because of alibaba these people can now get into the sort of the rural economy make stuff
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	and can flog it on alibaba
S0012	oh right
S0008	whereas before
S0012	they
S0008	they'd then have to take it to a market which be only a limit market anyway
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	which'd soon become flood with er
S0013	mm
S0008	whatever they be do
S0012	yeah
S0008	and also they'd have to take time out go in there be in there all day come home and go all this sort of stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they're
S0012	yeah
S0008	say that you know there's load of people load of these villages have sort of set up
S0013	mm
S0008	microindustries make stuff
S0012	well
S0008	and
S0012	yeah
S0008	they be say that it's so good that they can make money and like the kid be come back into the villages cos they've you know get place to live
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er rather than
S0012	that sound really good
S0008	yeah it be it's a very good example of consequences
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you think you know what they need be to set up something like that in africa don't they
S0012	they do don't they yeah or in
S0008	huh
S0008	yeah but i mean you know these towns like soweto where there's
S0013	yeah start small
S0012	yeah where there's
S0008	no one's work and

S0012	well they're just
S0008	south america you know
S0012	they're just starve aren't they they're just starve
S0008	well they just drink
S0013	yeah
S0008	themselves to death cos there's nothing to do you know
S0012	no

S0012	no
S0008	yeah they could set up these little
S0013	mm
S0008	microindustries
S0012	yeah cor
S0008	and of course once you know these sort of villages get a bite more prosperous then they can you know the old capitalist thing ain't it they can then start buy
S0012	that's right
S0008	you know products to build better house or what have you or

S0008	you know just a five gallon barrel underneath there
S0012	yeah
S0008	which you could er put all your your rubbish
S0008	use to light the bonfire
S0012	yeah oh that's what i want you to bring some old sump oil you get plenty ain't you or have you get rid of it all
S0008	i have get some
S0013	what's that for
S0012	mm
S0008	do the wood
S0012	yeah
S0008	mix it with paraffin
S0013	oh
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	or diesel do the same if you mix oil sump oil with diesel
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but paraffin will evaporate a bite better
S0012	that do yeah
S0008	so it dry up
S0012	yeah
S0008	but that be the best thing i find for loosen rusty nut and bolt
S0012	cor ain't it ain't it i i've i've get a
S0012	little er bowl that i put rusty
S0008	yeah
S0012	bolt in
S0008	but some oil and and diesel
S0012	yeah
S0008	work wonder
S0012	oh i see the diesel yeah
S0008	cos there be once when we have er on site there be a dumper truck and er you know something wrong with it that it be just pump all the diesel into the sump
S0012	yeah
S0008	i don't know how it do that it must've be
S0012	must've have a
S0008	break pistons or something
S0012	yeah
S0008	so they keep turn it over and it be just inject er
S0012	yeah
S0008	diesel into it
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er i get a bottle of it and i i still get it actually there's a lot of it but i
S0012	yeah
S0008	i be just use that as sort of penetrate fluid
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it work wonder
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos when you think about it like the the diesel would penetrate wouldn't it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and the oil would lubricate
S0012	lubricate
S0008	and the carbon would also cos that be
S0012	that's it
S0008	as black as the ace of spade you know full of
S0012	righto
S0008	full of carbon molecules
S0012	yeah
S0008	so you know it's hardly surprise that work well
S0012	that isn't cor we keep get these stupid phone call about er solar heat and stuff like that
S0008	oh yeah erm our record show that you've not take advantage of our new boiler
S0012	that's it yeah oh piss off
S0008	government fund boiler for i just pick em up and if there's the slightest bite of a pause i just put it down again cos quite often they're automatic ones
S0012	yeah they be
S0008	you know you get a pause
S0012	yeah yeah they're er erm automatic ones now cos these poor er poor call centre people use to get a lot of abuse didn't they
S0008	mm i expect they be all sort of slit their throats or something and
S0012	yeah
S0008	hang themselves
S0012	that must be awful mustn't it only try to earn a shill ain't you
S0008	well that's right but
S0012	who be that
S0013	ppi
S0012	ppi
S0008	ppi

S0012	cos i mean that's only i know it's a german machine
S0008	thank you
S0012	that i get from aldi donkey's yonks ago
S0008	mm
S0012	and that work ever so well
S0013	biscuit
S0012	but of course that's
S0008	but you've get a lot load onto it now ain't you
S0012	yes chomp away there er i
S0008	mm
S0012	i've be get rid of lot of stuff on it cos i'm clean it up

S0008	oh you still chomp your way through mcvitie's digestives then
S0013	no
S0012	no do you know i don't eat er
S0013	age ago
S0012	i don't eat em any more
S0013	we we er we use them all up age ago
S0008	mm
S0013	you mean when i buy load
S0012	oh they're go
S0008	mm oh right
S0013	a long time ago
S0008	well these have get a hundred and seventy calories per biscuit haven't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	oh no they ain't seventy one seventy one calories oh that's not too bad
S0012	that ain't too bad
S0013	mm
S0008	i'm sure these ones i buy from be these special light ones no originals well the bag of these ones i've buy the er morrisons
S0013	mm
S0008	special cheaper ones i'm sure they be a lot more than that
S0012	they get more sugar in that's why
S0013	mm could be
S0008	mm
S0012	you can't beat mcvitie's
S0008	but when you get your computer new
S0012	mm
S0008	do you go through that do you make the recovery disk
S0012	no
S0012	no i didn't
S0008	i see cos normally when you switch it on that's the first thing they tell you make recovery disk
S0012	that be ain't it but this have get a recovery disk on the on the er on the other disk get you switch it on and it say press f eleven for recovery
S0008	oh i see ah right so so have that get a raid system on
S0012	yeah i think it have yeah mm
S0008	cos raid system you have two disk
S0012	mm
S0008	and it automatically copy everything onto the second disk
S0012	oh do it yeah
S0008	so that if the first disk which you use
S0012	go for it
S0008	you know break down or
S0012	mm
S0008	corrupt you can then use the second disk as a recovery
S0012	this one have er get disk c and disk d d be the recovery disk on er on a new one
S0008	oh yeah
S0012	but on the recovery disk it's only get er can't remember how many how how much it's get on it now but this the big disk have get one terabyte of of you
S0008	mm
S0012	you can put er one terabyte on it
S0008	yeah be that partition then no
S0012	no and the other disk be the recovery disk which would i suppose you'll have to wipe wipe the other one er clean won't you before you use it
S0008	dunno
S0008	i think it probably automatically do that
S0012	mm
S0008	to recover
S0012	yeah
S0008	the trouble be with the recovery disk be mind you if yours have get a raid system it's permanently all the update
S0012	update it yeah yeah
S0008	with 's laptop when she first buy it i make a recovery disk
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then about six years later she give it back cos it wouldn't load up
S0012	oh right
S0008	and it work so slowly well it would load up but it'd take about you know twenty minutes to load up
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er i sort of try clean it up i get rid of all her stuff and et cetera et cetera and all these sort of clean up things you can do
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er it be still really sluggish and then i sort of like
S0013	yeah
S0008	look in the the draw where i keep all the old gubbins and stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	and find this recovery disk and i'm like well sod it you know aren't lose anything you know cos it's i erm stick it in wipe everything load it up again
S0012	yeah
S0008	erm from new and it be like lightning
S0012	be it
S0008	it really be
S0013	mm
S0012	oh wow
S0008	which just go to prove there's load and load of stuff in the registry
S0013	mm
S0008	which you don't need which you can't
S0012	never use either no
S0008	which you it's slow it down
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	horrendously
S0013	mm
S0008	but
S0012	no matter whether you use that registry clean up or what
S0008	mm
S0012	you know er that that don't clean it right up do it
S0008	no
S0012	that's no
S0013	mm
S0012	no i've er i've registry clean up and i've
S0008	mm
S0012	this that and the other
S0008	no it doesn't work do it
S0012	and and when you look into the roam bite
S0008	mm
S0012	you've get er it's get load and load and load of information that you've you've you never put there that just go there
S0008	mm
S0012	and that's the bite that be use up all the all the memory
S0008	yeah
S0012	there's load on it
S0008	cos like in your in in the er in your registry everything you do get a little thing put in there
S0012	yeah
S0008	so it sort of check it out before it do anything else
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	even if you don't need it any more
S0013	mm
S0008	they'll still check it out and check it out check it out check out check it out check it out
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and er it must get massive it must get massive
S0012	it must do all the time mustn't it plus with all the how many er how many update come down the other day
S0013	oh ten
S0012	ten update from
S0008	mm
S0012	microsoft

S0012	yeah
S0013	and you don't know what they're do
S0008	that's right
S0012	but i mean the you switch it you switch your computer off

S0008	they have no pipe water or nothing
S0012	no no
S0008	and er obviously
S0013	mm
S0008	no well or anything down there
S0012	that's right
S0013	so i suppose they just boil it didn't they must've boil it up
S0008	well it's amaze they must've do yeah
S0013	for drink mm
S0012	well when
S0008	don't suppose you'd've drink it
S0013	that would've be alright wouldn't it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	no er i actually probably what they do be put it in a jar for one of them big earthenware pot
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	and let it settle
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and then they might've drink it
S0012	then they'd pour it out well
S0008	but in those days you could you could buy these jar
S0012	big brown jar
S0013	yeah they do
S0008	with a
S0012	yeah
S0008	with a charcoal filter in the bottom
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	where you'd have a layer of sand sharp sand a layer of charcoal and then another layer of sharp sand
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	and that'd have a tap at the bottom
S0013	oh i see yeah
S0008	and that would act as filtration
S0012	and that bite would filter it
S0013	filter it
S0012	yeah
S0008	er the charcoal would kill anything
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and the sand'd filter out all the bits
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah my mum
S0013	mm
S0012	when my mum have have er the house in what be it call my mum's house
S0013	yeah
S0012	what be it call
S0013	
S0012	well she call it but it weren't erm
S0008	in the range
S0012	that be er that be up in in in right up the top and that they call they they call and they be the only house down there
S0008	mm
S0012	you use to have to go through the woods over the hill and down and there be my mum's house build the first part be build in eighteen twelve and they be the servants' quarter to the hall
S0008	oh right
S0012	right and then they build my mum's house or or that weren't my mum's when they build it of course in nineteen fourteen
S0008	mm
S0012	right and for the servants' quarter they have a pipe go right down to the river
S0008	mm
S0012	and a pump that pump it up into the woods where this big old reservoir be in the woods
S0008	mm
S0012	and then that'd come down and that's what they the servants use to drink and that use to come straight from the river
S0008	mm but as i say the the the set er the tank er the in the be probably some sort of filtration
S0012	yeah probably yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	thing there as well
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but probably not a very good one
S0012	the tank be er as be half as big as this room
S0008	uhu
S0012	and about eight eight foot deep
S0008	mm but probably the worst thing about it be that all the pip be probably lead anyway
S0012	yeah probably lead yeah
S0013	mm er
S0008	so
S0013	didn't your mum have a a well
S0012	oh yeah they have a well that that
S0013	oh that be different
S0008	mm
S0012	that that be different that be that be dig age age before age after
S0013	mm
S0012	the servants' quarter be build
S0013	oh i see
S0008	mm
S0013	okay
S0012	that weren't nothing to do with the servants' quarter that be to do with the house
S0013	mm
S0012	and er
S0013	they test that didn't they and it they say it be unfit for human consumption
S0012	they test it and say they get unfit for human consumption
S0008	really
S0012	this be
S0013	and they'd be they'd be drink it all their live
S0012	it be in the middle of nowhere
S0008	yeah
S0012	and it be
S0008	why be it unfit
S0012	very very very deep
S0008	uhu
S0012	but i believe there be some kind of copper filtration in it
S0008	oh right
S0012	cos some of them some of them er have go if the bath drip you get the blue
S0008	oh right
S0012	copper but they have be drink it forever
S0008	mm well my parent have a well that be a quite a deep one i forget how deep it be but it be a long way down you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er a lot of rope and a bucket
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er that'd come up and every now and again you'd get little red squiggly worm in it
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and they say oh that's really good water cos
S0012	the red squiggly worm be in it
S0008	cos the red squiggly worm wouldn't live wouldn't live in pollute water
S0013	oh really oh right
S0008	no they test the copper pipe that come out alright
S0013	yeah
S0008	but they have that well there for well they only use it for probably three four years or
S0012	yeah
S0008	three years four years
S0012	well the water board
S0008	when we get the water you know woah we get the water the water
S0012	get water on yeah
S0008	the water's come
S0012	yeah the er the er the anglian water board say that they be go to start charge for everybody for well this be age ago now
S0008	mm
S0012	and they couldn't could they they reckon that the water underneath anybody's land belong to anglian water
S0008	yeah well it's a bite like america
S0012	yeah
S0008	america's get this idea that all the water belong to them
S0012	yeah
S0008	the government
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	that's wrong ain't it
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah
S0008	well and it make you wonder like if if er if you fill a water tub up when it rain would that be illegal
S0012	well that's right yeah would it yeah
S0008	theoretically it belong to anglian water
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah that's really weird ain't it i mean
S0013	mm
S0012	but i don't see how they can say that that belong to them
S0008	well they just say it and then wait for someone to say it's not true
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	i mean there be a certain thing in hydrology which be they're find in california now and also in the middle east be that the government have to control the use of water to a certain extent
S0012	yeah because
S0008	otherwise you'd just
S0012	some people wouldn't get it
S0008	well no i mean australia as well the thing be everyone no one it's like global warm no one'll pay any attention to it till that's all go
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then in in
S0013	mm
S0008	place like in california they're have horrendous droughts but they just keep put deeper and deeper well in
S0008	and pump more and more water out
S0013	yeah
S0008	and they're say well you know this be not sustainable
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	and like the thing be you you know all the the big erm orange growers and that and fruit growers
S0013	mm
S0008	they need the water
S0012	they do
S0008	and they're just say well you know it's our you know multimillion pound business what be we gonna do just
S0013	mm
S0008	give up
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they're say well you know we have to work out some different way you can't keep drill all of these deeper well because then the aquifers which supply you know the major towns in california
S0012	yeah
S0008	they're just all dry up
S0012	yeah
S0008	well there's er you know i mean
S0013	mm
S0008	there cos a lot of these aquifer er these reservoirs rely on snow melt
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they get quite high mountains there along the coast
S0012	yeah they do yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but of course they haven't have the snow in recent years and
S0012	no that's right
S0008	and there's picture of these these massive great lakes which be only about a quarter full
S0012	yeah
S0008	incredible actually think about it when cor when we go to spain when be about one or two there be reservoirs there where you could walk right down and you know where they'd flood these valleys and flood these towns and like the build be still stand you could walk go right down there and walk
S0012	wow
S0008	in
S0013	mm
S0008	you know we'd walk through the main street with these old build
S0012	wow
S0008	these old towns
S0012	there's a place in in yorkshire
S0013	mm
S0012	very similar to that
S0008	yeah
S0012	they they flood this er village
S0008	yeah
S0012	a whole village make it into a reservoir and it's get so the water have go down so much now
S0008	mm
S0012	some of the roof of the house and the church be show through
S0008	mm
S0012	they didn't get rid of them why surely all that stuff'd pollute the water
S0008	well it's like if you if you drown a reservoir er a valley you get all tree and god know what in there
S0012	well you do yeah well that's all clean up
S0008	all them little all them little creatures
S0012	yeah
S0008	what live in there
S0013	mm
S0012	that's all clean anyway the water be ain't it
S0012	i be just think of the lead on er on the church roof
S0008	i i think they'd take it off
S0008	i think if you're gonna drown you know this sort of idea that
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know you can still hear the bell ring in the church
S0012	yeah
S0008	i think anything of value be
S0013	mm
S0008	take out of these place before they be
S0012	yeah
S0008	abandon
S0012	i they would yeah yeah
S0008	there's always some fly by night who'll be there if that weren't do officially that'd've be do unofficially
S0012	that would wouldn't it yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh you can still hear the bell at
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	you could still hear the bell on certain nights you when that bell toll there's go to be something wrong
S0008	yeah bad storm brew
S0012	nah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah i say it's
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	but we know

S0008	yeah they aren't in the shop yet be they
S0012	ah
S0013	no
S0012	no but when they come in the shop they'll be three time the price you pay for em last year
S0013	well if they're not there now
S0008	not necessarily
S0012	no not necessarily
S0013	if they're not there now then er i can't buy them
S0012	well that's true
S0012	but you could look on the net and probably buy them half the price on the net
S0013	okay i'll have a look then i hadn't think about that
S0012	and you gotta pay you gotta pay you gotta buy at least fifty quid's worth of stuff before you get the postage free
S0013	mm
S0008	cor i've have to buy i mean you know er this sort of you know sort of do some hedge cut right
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i get the hedge cutter out and start the hedge the bloom thing
S0008	yeah well no the the the stud to hold the exhaust on have snap
S0012	oh
S0008	snap off
S0012	oh nice
S0008	and so then i spend the week
S0012	mend it
S0008	try to repair that like oh i'll do some strimming instead get the strimmer out that pack up
S0008	so i've twiddle with that er get it go again then it pack up again so then i have to buy some new carburettor gaskets for it and
S0012	oh right
S0008	and er
S0012	you didn't make any
S0008	well you in the carburettor they have little machine they're such small things
S0012	yeah they be
S0008	and the the two stroke work on the fact that part of the gasket be sort of like a little flappy bite
S0012	yeah
S0008	and that sort of flap one way and sort of stop the petrol go in
S0012	that's it
S0008	then flap the other way and let the petrol and it sort of
S0008	act as a valve you see
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er on the carburettor so you know after er you know lot of years it be a thing that always use to say he'd say well when you on a two stroke engine what you should do be always run it out of petrol
S0012	yeah otherwise it'll get sticky
S0008	otherwise these little gaskets be all
S0013	yeah
S0012	bung up yeah
S0008	they get well they i think they sort of get flimsy or something
S0012	oh do they i think the
S0008	mm
S0012	petrol
S0008	well whatever you know but i never bother so i always assume it's my fault with these things
S0008	so i strimmed my my hay meadow
S0012	do you
S0008	mostly but even so there's things not work a hundred percent but like all these things they've gotta you know they're all thirty year old you know
S0012	yeah i know yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	some of these be you know really sort of think well can i be arsed to buy new stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	and especially when you think you know you can get these sort of like modern strimmers and things like that
S0012	well you can yeah
S0008	and they aren't gonna be half as good as the one i've get
S0012	no no
S0008	you know like er cos the ones i've get cost eight hundred quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you can get a a modern one it's gonna cost you like a hundred and eighty two hundred quid but it ain't gonna be any good
S0012	it ain't gonna be any good no
S0008	or it's gonna permanently annoy you cos the only time you want it be when you've get some heavy duty stuff to do and that ain't gonna be enough
S0012	yeah yeah that's right yeah well how thick be the the strimming er
S0008	the string on it
S0012	the yeah
S0008	erm
S0012	it's about an eighth
S0008	yeah it's about two mil
S0012	yeah
S0008	something like that i think it be like two or three or something like that can't be three though can it yes it can
S0012	that can yeah
S0008	yeah it's three mil that's what it be
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's an eighth there
S0012	yeah it's an eighth yeah
S0008	but i have get one little electric one which i've get from 's mum which have get like the string like really thin sort of
S0012	yeah
S0008	one point one or something but that work alright
S0012	yeah
S0008	have to have a little battery thing
S0012	be there
S0008	like yeah that's alright for go round like the edge of the the er vegetable garden
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know grass sort of like
S0013	mm
S0008	fence'd start creep
S0012	creep across yeah
S0008	yeah i i go round there every now and again with that it work well for that but it ain't no good for
