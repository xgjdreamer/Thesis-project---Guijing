S0041	so i go it i say look i don't really know what the hell happen with that like i know i get interest every month because it's an overdraft
S0084	mm hm
S0041	it usually work out between five and ten quid depend on how much into the overdraft be for the majority of the month
S0084	mm
S0041	it's like one percent or something it's really good
S0084	mm
S0041	i've have it since i be eighteen em and i really leave a tenner in just to cover it but what have happen be my old insurance company have try to take my car insurance
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	and bounce it over then i get a like a a change to say we have to say no and a charge to say you're over your overdraft limit they're like

S0084	mm
S0041	they'd let us leave our stuff in their cupboards and lock it for us
S0084	really
S0041	yeah and then let us put our heel in there the next day in fact my friend be once she be my accomplice she be once so piss i get to before her cos i'd go back to this guy's house and she'd go back to her boyfriend's house i say right see you at work at seven you better make it or else i'm come to get you so she get to work even more drink than me she walk and it's like um like a hospital cos they call centre they're massive so she walk down the wall hold on
S0084	oh god
S0041	the entire way probably four lengths of this house
S0084	ah
S0041	i see her out of the corner of my eye walk through we use to work for the national rail walk through get to a seat plop herself down and i look at her and she look at me and as she look forward and she kind of spin
S0084	aw
S0041	and she look at her computer and just go dooosh and smack her head on the desk and pass out and everyone just look around i be like fuck and i be scream to our manager and he be like i be like ko'd ko'd quick quick and he like literally i kid you not it's like slapstick walk past me i be like seriously head desk go cos he obviously we stink of alcohol walk past me get a chair put her on and wheel her
S0041	wheel her to the nearest office i'd forget that
S0084	that's that
S0041	oh i'd forget that
S0084	that's that's actually genius isn't it really cos you can't lift a dead weight you can't lift a body
S0046	no no
S0084	just wheel it if in doubt just wheel her
S0041	they dose her up with coffee for an hour and send her home and she text me she get on the bus outside work and she be that drink she pay the bus driver didn't get too far before it set off fell over face plant the floor and be splay like that and some kid saw her laugh get up out of his seat walk down the bus and stamp on her hand
S0084	at least she wouldn't feel it cos if she be that piss she wouldn't have felt it
S0041	so not only do she get wheel out of work smack her face on a desk smack her face on the bus some kid like three four year old get up and stamp on her finger
S0084	stamp on her hand but surely that's a sackable offence though to work absolutely out of your face
S0041	we do all sort we do all sort
S0046	if you can get away with it yeah
S0041	they didn't sack anyone it be nobody want to work there you know it be in a call centre like script read all the time and the staff turnover be so high
S0084	even still though yeah you'd think that would be
S0041	so high
S0084	like i'm sure that's probably a sackable offence turn up piss you know instant dismissal like no warn you're out
S0041	yeah you're out see you later but we'd both be there so long cos we we'd work there from be sixteen
S0084	mm
S0041	a couple of days a week and then over the summer then a couple of days a week and most kid last like three weeks cos it be so bad or then move departments because it be so big they have like national rail british gas o2 o2 dice eh wanadoo and that be there like we have crack royal bank of scotland like next ventura like the biggest company load and load of them
S0084	oh god and they be all in the same place
S0041	yeah it be huge and people get bore and then move departments
S0084	mm
S0041	and spend eight weeks train again they're get pay to sit and play around
S0084	yeah
S0041	so
S0084	yeah it's not worth get somebody in

S0084	mm
S0041	yeah that be a fun time
S0084	those be the days
S0041	yeah you you just wouldn't get away with do that now can you imagine a kid turn up to work drink now

S0041	like cos i be organise the department but there's only two of us or four of us there and the rest of them be external
S0084	mm
S0041	and he the md have no idea what i be do so all the time i've get massive board up try to plan for like the rest of the year have to prioritise stuff for for olivia to do and like we use to have a board that have like a graph of urgency and
S0046	who be do it and time day month
S0041	mm mm mm mm mm importance urgency importance and split it into a b c d so if it be really urgent and really important
S0084	mm
S0041	it be b nothing ever should be in b cos then you're fire fight
S0084	mm
S0041	so if it's important but not urgent then just go to other box so it allow me to put all we use to have like sixteen task on the go at a time between the two of us to categorise who's gonna do what between that be just normal
S0084	yeah
S0041	run of the mill stuff of do cold call and me check her call and do my own work and it be so like
S0084	messy
S0041	all the time i couldn't go in hangover

S0084	yeah
S0041	i didn't know that
S0084	for some reason it it's something to do with the metallicness but um
S0041	oh that's my favourite thing to learn today
S0084	yeah there you go it keep the bubble so if we keep that overnight which obviously we probably wouldn't let's be honest but if we do it would still be bubbly tomorrow
S0041	really
S0084	yeah
S0041	ah that's brilliant
S0046	it's really good yeah
S0084	it's good it's a good top tip
S0041	yeah she's be she's be at the hotel a year now
S0084	mm
S0041	and she start as a sales eh exec without any sales experience
S0084	how do that happen
S0041	i don't know but she be on more than me
S0084	so be be that she's sleep with the boss
S0041	no
S0084	be that she's come recommend by someone
S0041	no i don't know
S0084	how can you do that how can you walk in as an exec and not have any experience
S0041	i don't know but that's their entry cos it's exec then manager
S0084	oh i see right so it just sound more glam than it be
S0041	whereas mine's coordinator then manager yeah
S0084	okay but even still
S0041	em yeah she start on more em she basically get hand her account because of the last person that be there so she didn't have to win any account
S0084	oh right easy street
S0041	yeah she's really have it piss easy
S0084	mm
S0041	and all the all the business that sam and i have win she's take credit for cos some of them be her key account so she hasn't work on the contract but she's get the credit for it

S0084	oh right
S0041	like we don't show up on any of the search engines it's it's just bad
S0084	have she have she get a freelancer in to design it
S0041	mm mm
S0084	no
S0041	no it's really weird like centrally they hand down the website
S0084	to like a templatey thing
S0041	yeah and it's all ready to go you can add offer on but they add offer as well
S0084	ah
S0041	it's
S0084	so you so you you're limit in a way

S0084	no way
S0041	yeah
S0084	it be that they didn't invite you you
S0041	someone have to stay on the phone
S0084	aw
S0041	and eve say she want to go for moral support
S0084	i suppose he have be there longer whether that count for something
S0041	which be fine with all my ideas by the way a whole page full of them
S0084	no way
S0041	yeah go cos they're suppose to be get more involve lap it all up the the gm lap it up so she come back and say yeah i be really impress with this and i i mean i trust eve she do tell them it be my idea
S0084	mm
S0041	em but we need to look into the website cos we're not come up on google blah blah blah so she send an email to this guy someone in the company she say will you just read this and see you just it need to be sucky up enough that he's go to help us but not sucky enough off cos i need to look professional and like he's not above me
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and i read it and i be like i know how to do that she be like what i know exactly how to optimize your website that's what i have to do for my last business i tell that six months ago and she didn't tell them
S0084	no way
S0041	sit in that meet with the gm and didn't say actually already teach me how to do this
S0084	no way
S0041	and just say yeah how be we go to do this it's so hard my life in website that i've win an award for be so hard
S0084	what a cow
S0041	yeah but eve there and then write him a an email with all we need to do
S0084	okay
S0041	cc'd me in and say it that it be me that do it
S0084	okay
S0041	so not only have this cow manage to win all these this stuff and be nominate for an award for a shit website
S0084	yeah
S0041	but she's not actually do any of the work she swan around have lunch
S0084	she just
S0041	yeah have lunch with clients and sell our meet space and she lose us six grand yesterday
S0084	what how
S0041	minimum probably about twelve grand actually
S0084	she lose a contract
S0041	no she sell a contract for our christmas party next year but obviously our cover be really good this year which be why i get the bonus
S0084	mm
S0041	and basically we can sell the whole space for twelve grand so someone can hire it out for twelve grand basically to cover their the room and for two hundred and seventy people to eat so it work out pretty good
S0084	mm mm
S0041	she sell it half capacity and promise it them exclusively and i say to her no i say no we're not do that and she say yeah we be i say no that's our peak day next month because the way the month land we're not sell it
S0084	mm mm
S0041	they could have one room exclusively and then we can only lose kinda twenty percent
S0084	yeah
S0041	but the bar spend on top of that last year be two grand so you're talk eight grand plus if they want bedrooms i say you can't take it
S0084	yeah
S0041	not that weekend i say give them this day or this day and then they can have it
S0084	mm
S0041	she didn't listen to me go to didn't think to question it cos he's more he's less argumentative than i be
S0084	yeah
S0041	and just say ooh you know that's a peak day she say yeah i'm try to talk them out of it give the contract get them to sign it
S0084	so be this the key account
S0041	yep she get mark cos it's her key account but we've just lose
S0084	yeah in reality
S0041	a shit load of money
S0084	yeah yeah yeah so it look good but after you really look at it
S0041	and not just the money but we'd lose two hundred cover for two hundred people and our achievement this year be four thousand so two hundred on four thousand
S0046	it be a lot of people
S0041	on the big pasty day
S0084	yeah
S0041	of the year
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0041	yeah and she's swanning around
S0084	freak
S0041	she's such a bitch
S0084	it's so hard isn't it but when you see people like that who be take who be get so much credit and you just think but they're actually not do anything it's probably more to do with the fact that the hotel be run really inefficiently because actually if you have someone there if you have you know the hilton run it it seem unlikely that they would allow someone like that
S0041	no
S0084	to get away with what they're get away with
S0041	and the best part be usually in the hotels the other people that do her job look after a cluster so they'll be a sales director and sales manager sales exec
S0084	mm hm
S0041	for a cluster of hotels they'll look after three or four hotels so their key account span across the region
S0084	right
S0041	and they travel a lot and they work for people but because of our hotel be shit like i don't understand what the fuck's go on she just have to look after one hotel so there's just the director of sales and her and they have an inbase office in the hotel which never happen
S0084	right
S0041	they usually don't have a base they have to kind of meet people all the time it's really hard work and network
S0084	yeah
S0041	hand on a plate she get her own desk own laptop
S0084	oh my god
S0041	company bosh
S0084	company car
S0041	she doesn't get the car she get the petrol allowance
S0084	fuck me but she's not go anywhere because she's post in cambridge
S0041	exactamundo
S0084	oh my god
S0041	yeah
S0084	she be laugh so what do you think she's on then salary
S0041	i know she's on twenty five
S0084	no she's not
S0041	she be she start on or she might be on twenty nah i might be lie i think she might be on twenty three but her bonus will take her up to twenty five
S0084	fuck
S0041	but she start on twenty and i start on fifteen and i'm do her leg work for her
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0041	ain't it mad
S0084	that's disgust
S0041	and she didn't have any experience but because before that have go through like four sales execs in a row and none of them stick around he obviously saw wet lettuce go to stay forever make it a career for life
S0084	yeah or what you would
S0041	yeah
S0084	she will she will never leave
S0041	no never
S0084	because that's an ideal job i mean unless twenty five grand become a wall but to be honest she will never get that do what she's do now anywhere else fuck me
S0041	yup
S0084	i don't know how they can do it
S0041	and one of her key account be a company she use to work for and that's why they're a key account
S0084	ah sweet
S0041	yeah
S0084	maybe she's not that stupid then
S0041	just
S0084	she she obviously isn't stupid she's just eh play it easy
S0041	yeah sales right through though isn't it
S0084	cos you wouldn't go out your way would you mm
S0041	yeah she's she be a piss take and this be the girl do i tell do i tell you about the matt cardle thing

S0084	yeah
S0041	how how much you can say to another person
S0084	yeah when you don't know them that well
S0041	cos you go from that yeah you know you're force into live with someone that you don't really know very well you're quite different to him and you don't know
S0084	you don't know how they're go to take it
S0041	it's really difficult to get gauge yeah
S0084	like all day i be like should i say something should i not and i be really nervous that's why i be like

S0041	mm
S0084	you drink all my beer so can you get some more in like
S0046	yeah
S0084	money be just really it's really crude and i don't want to talk about it
S0046	no that's
S0041	i find cos i agree with you on this i find it very uncomfortable i didn't even know i find out that i be a millionaire a year ago and that's because he's get divorce didn't have clue didn't have a fuck clue we don't talk about money we don't i mean he's not load
S0046	yeah
S0041	i'm not talk multi millionaire he's probably get accumulatively one or two
S0084	mm
S0041	not enough to write home about see as i'm try to help him with his frigging divorce
S0046	mm
S0084	yeah
S0041	em but yeah we never ever never talk about money never
S0084	that's what you learn from the earliest point when i say to my dad oh dad how much do you earn strike down like don't talk about it
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	you never ask you never talk about it it's just it's
S0046	yeah no i'm the same
S0084	so it's for me it be really like oh my god i be really nervous about it
S0041	yeah
S0084	a because i don't know you well enough so i don't know if you're gonna
S0046	it's only a few beers you know i'm not gonna get
S0084	but do you know
S0046	angry about it
S0041	but it doesn't last without you do it
S0084	i don't know i don't know what you're how you're go to react i don't know if you're gonna be like what the fuck like what it be only a few beers what be you talk about or if you're gonna to be like oh i'm so sorry i should have get beers in
S0046	oh no i know no no it be only a few beers but i mean i'm not i'm not particularly bother about it you know beers be beers you know we all live together
S0084	mm
S0046	we've all get to muck in together
S0041	and not everyone's into different type be they
S0084	well yeah
S0046	i'm i'm i'm i'm not bother about how help housemates out if i can you know and i well i'm not say that i expect the same back you know
S0041	yeah it take a while to bed in doesn't it to to show you can trust other people like that
S0046	it it happen so you know i'm not
S0084	yeah i think to feel comfortable around each other and i think it's nice that we all get on
S0041	mm
S0046	yeah
S0041	anna and carmen it would be nice if we can include them as well
S0046	yeah
S0084	but for me like i just want you to know like if you've get something that's on your mind i'd much rather you talk to me about it
S0046	yeah no no that's not a problem
S0084	because it upset me and it annoy me to think that you talk to somebody else
S0046	yeah
S0084	rather than come to me because then i think that's what breed anger in the house
S0046	yeah yeah no no that's that's understandable
S0041	mm
S0084	it make me feel uncomfortable to think you're secretly go and talk about me
S0041	mm
S0046	yeah
S0084	whereas actually you could be like i don't really understand why she do that
S0041	you don't know how to judge the situation
S0084	yeah
S0046	yeah
S0084	it's probably just like really harmless because i think in my head oh they're gossip about me what's go on but actually it's not like that
S0046	well yeah it's it's different cos you know me and you have get a different relationship to what me and have
S0084	yeah of course yeah well we don't know each other very well really
S0046	yeah so it's it's cos you be say this and then tesco's weren't you
S0041	yeah cos i say what i say to be that you you two have a different relationship than we have
S0046	yeah
S0041	but if you i say to him if you know like i know you'd know that whatever you be think you could say to her
S0046	yeah
S0041	and it wouldn't matter and i say be what will happen be over the more time it will just become normal
S0046	yeah
S0041	and that you won't feel a barrier at all
S0084	mm mm
S0041	it's just really strange like when you first live somewhere
S0084	i guess we spend less time less time together
S0041	that's it it's just a time thing
S0046	because you know it's it's obviously smoke socially
S0084	mm
S0046	and you don't
S0084	yeah
S0041	that's actually probably the time difference you know think about it
S0046	yeah you know it's quite a long time you know those five minutes god know how many time we've be out for a fag
S0041	yeah
S0046	you know it all add up but you know but you're you're a little bite more social
S0084	mm mm
S0046	than what you be you know if if you come through the door and i'm in the kitchen you won't necessarily put yourself in a position to want to socialise you may say a few word
S0041	yeah you you need your own space a bite more
S0084	mm
S0046	which be fine which be great you know everyone's different
S0084	mm
S0046	you know i'm probably the same but
S0041	yeah i i get you know what i'm like i'm a chatterbox
S0046	just she yeah no nosy nosy
S0084	yeah that's the nosy
S0046	cos you know
S0041	she be a nosy chatterbox
S0041	as it happen
S0046	you know
S0084	i just love live in this house
S0041	suck up to provide with our can and suck up the rest of the
S0046	no it's it's fine i haven't get a problem with anyone in this house i really haven't you know
S0084	no no me neither i mean the thing be
S0041	i do piss me off right now
S0046	oh
S0084	that i mean that's the defensiveness be a bite of a shame
S0041	but like that's the thing that's the only thing that i'm annoy about
S0084	i don't want her to feel persecute it be never a us against you it be never a we're attack you it be much very much a conversation i think
S0041	well yeah that's exactly what i think and i bring it up with and i say have it be when say to me you wake me up last night
S0084	mm
S0041	when i come in drink sing with
S0046	yeah she do yeah
S0041	i say i say look i'm really sorry em and when she when she say it on the night i say i'm really sorry i'm go to bed now
S0084	mm
S0041	and in the morning she bring it up and i say yeah oh no i'm really sorry
S0046	she stick her head out do she
S0041	yeah she stick her out of the bedroom
S0046	oh i didn't know that
S0041	and have a go and i say i know i'm really sorry i'm go downstairs now i'm really sorry i'm go to bed
S0084	to plaster even though no one's get a plaster
S0041	piss need a plaster
S0046	there be plaster where you've still get them haven't you
S0041	yeah in the bathroom yeah em and then the next morning she bring it up again and i think i've already apologise once you do bring it up
S0046	yeah it be a couple of days later weren't it
S0041	yeah she bring it up again
S0084	and it have only be once or twice you know like really
S0041	yeah that's the first time i've ever wake up
S0084	oh really okay
S0041	yeah and she come downstairs and she bring it up again and initially i be go to apologise and i go oh yeah i know i'm really sorry and she be like yeah i know and i have to be at work the next day so she push it again and i and then i just be like no i'm sorry i've apologise twice this be once in four or five months
S0084	eh hmm mm
S0041	and i say well yeah but to be fair in the grand scheme of things i've wake you once and i get wake up every every week so you know
S0046	mm
S0041	i think we're on quite a good winner there on your front
S0084	yeah oh absolutely
S0041	and that's what piss me off cos when i bring it up with her when she bring it up with me even though it be just a one off occasion
S0084	yeah
S0041	the first thing i do automatically be apologise
S0046	we'll stick it in the oven now it's on the grill
S0041	and then we bring it up with her and she didn't she didn't say sorry
S0084	no no she didn't say sorry
S0046	no
S0041	for the whole conversation she didn't say sorry once
S0084	and her fella quietly in the corner
S0041	run away upstairs
S0084	yeah
S0041	this be what i say to it's not even so much the the noise it's the attitude towards it
S0046	mm
S0084	and it's so hard because the last thing you want to be do be say to your housemates you can't have boyfriend over for in the night but what time be it like ten o'clock at night
S0041	aw
S0084	cos i'd be out he come in at ten you know he be go to leave at four essentially he's become some sort of booty call
S0041	yeah
S0084	which i'm not here to pass judgement on but if it
S0041	oh no
S0084	affect the house like it wake you up
S0046	yeah
S0084	which be what we say
S0046	well yeah sometimes you know like if i've get my window open
S0084	cos they say oh it's it's cos you two have get the worst room as if it's somehow our fault because we have a room downstairs
S0046	yeah
S0084	i say well it wake everybody up
S0046	yeah
S0084	you know if you're leave at that time it will probably wake up because he'll be awake because he's get up
S0046	yeah
S0084	well get up anyway you know well he doesn't every day he hasn't work this week
S0046	yeah
S0041	and then i say well you know he do make a lot of noise well i don't hear him i say no it's not a debate i'm not discuss whether or not he make a noise he do actually wake us up fact
S0084	he wake us up it's not like we're here just to like cause a problem like he do wake us up every time
S0041	yeah it's like it be a debate whether or not he make noise and i be like
S0084	and then she say
S0041	but that's not the conversation
S0084	and she say the reason she couldn't let him out the back door be because she go back to sleep
S0041	yeah
S0084	so she's not get an issue
S0041	no
S0084	she go happily back to sleep and the rest of us have to put up with him bang around the front door
S0041	yeah and i do say to her like families live together all the time you know parent work nightshifts and stuff and it work and you don't wake each other up because you just respect each other whoa whoa thank
S0046	marvellous thank you
S0084	so i just i just find the whole attitude really strange
S0046	but i haven't hear him for age i haven't hear him for age the last time i hear him be when he wake you up to let him in
S0084	mm well he be in here the other night but he be super quiet
S0046	no i haven't hear him and cos i've be come back late even i haven't see his bike out
S0041	mm
S0046	out front
S0041	i'll tell you what i think be really spineless of him like he didn't say i'm sorry or i didn't realise i be wake you up
S0084	yeah right just hide the corner
S0041	just he just stand there above the stairs like hide and i mean i know it be an awkward conversation
S0084	mm
S0041	it shouldn't have be actually anna be very immature when she handle that conversation
S0046	mm
S0041	she didn't accept responsibility she didn't try and talk about it she be automatically defensive and quite aggressive with it
S0084	mm
S0041	passive aggressive really
S0084	yeah
S0041	but you would think although he felt awkward he might say do you know what it's actually me that's get up i didn't realise i be wake you up i'm sorry i'll try and be quiet
S0046	mm
S0084	mm mm
S0041	that would have be end of convo end of conversation
S0046	i don't think it's not that much to ask you know if he leave his bike out there you know what's it gonna hurt if he leave that door unlock for an hour
S0084	no because gonna be up by five thirty
S0046	yeah
S0084	so it make no difference whatsoever
S0046	yeah for an hour
S0084	no one's gonna rob us between half four and half five
S0046	no and all our doors be lock anyway so what be they gonna rob
S0041	yeah pot and pan
S0046	mm
S0041	they're dirty go ahead i've leave them there for two days
S0084	disco duck
S0041	don't take the disco duck mm i think it be a very the whole the whole thing be very strange
S0041	mm
S0046	yeah it's not a major problem leave that door open at all
S0084	it's maximum two hours
S0041	mm hm
S0046	yeah completely even on weekend
S0041	i mean to be fair if someone come in we'd fuck hear him you'd be up
S0084	mm
S0046	yeah well yeah you would be wouldn't you
S0084	mm
S0041	no one's gonna rob you at that time cos they think people be get up for work
S0084	mm
S0046	yeah
S0041	which we be really so we'd hear them
S0084	for sure
S0041	mm
S0046	we be all early bird it's annoy that you know there's a few people that get up earlier than some which be quite frustrate
S0084	mm
S0046	you know
S0041	especially the weeks when i'm not to be at work till ten
S0046	mm
S0041	that's a piss take that's like two hours sleep i miss out on
S0084	it's a killer isn't it really it's so hard because the house be only design for like what three people
S0046	yeah
S0084	it would originally have be a three bedroomed house
S0041	yeah even though it's fall to piece so
S0084	so maximum mum and dad two kid
S0041	mm hm
S0084	so really to have five adults possibly six seven eight depend on who's stay here
S0084	yeah
S0084	there's just too many people for one small space
S0041	mm
S0046	completely i completely agree
S0041	although i've only ever hear you in the whole time be here i've hear you twice and i've never hear you
S0084	really
S0041	in how many months have that be
S0046	that's pretty good go
S0084	we've be here six months
S0041	isn't it that's a pretty good go
S0046	i do try and be quiet you know even like i know when i'm wash up i will close the door you know
S0084	eh hmm
S0041	i think it be the door that be wake me up you know cos since we've take that off i never hear it
S0084	i've sleep so much better this week
S0041	yeah
S0084	i don't wake up in the morning now because of that door
S0041	no i don't
S0084	so it obviously be the bang that we be hear
S0046	mm
S0041	i don't think i really i don't think i understand cos you know when you're half asleep
S0084	mm
S0041	that it be that that be wake me up it obviously be
S0084	that night when i go mental at you two cos you wake me up the first night second night
S0041	mm i don't remember that very well
S0084	that be the problem cos you wake up
S0041	oh yes
S0084	and drink a bottle of wine
S0041	i remember yeah
S0084	fuck alcoholic
S0046	oh yeah my fault oops
S0084	well like cos it be because your mate your mate keep go in and out of the kitchen door so in your head you're like that's really good we're keep the door close no one will wake up
S0041	mm
S0084	because the door's so noisy obviously that's what you hear
S0046	yeah
S0084	i think now that we've take the hinge off
S0041	yeah
S0084	which will never know because it's always prop up open anyway
S0046	yeah as long as you as long as you keep the the clip in the door
S0041	ooh and i find out today during my fire safety train she can't kick off to us about take it off
S0084	it's illegal to have open anyway isn't it
S0041	it's not a fire door it's not a fire door if it be a fire door it should be a heavy duty door and that's just wood
S0084	not window not with glass in it
S0041	yeah
S0084	well the hinge i think might have make it heavy duty
S0041	oh do it
S0046	it's a solid door solid
S0084	but the hinge always use the catch and it be so it make it heavy cos it be a heavy weight
S0046	no it's definitely a heavy door it be fire door it's an official fire door
S0041	be it
S0046	yeah
S0084	but the thing be she's complicit because she know that we could
S0041	no you can't cos you can't have glass in a fire door surely
S0084	i've never see i've never see
S0041	there's no way cos if it get hot the glass be go to shatter
S0046	it's get metal in it it's a proper fire door
S0084	it's pretty heavy like if you think about it when you've get the hinge on it
S0046	it's a proper fire door
S0084	but the thing be she know that we've always keep that prop open
S0041	mm
S0084	so she really can't complain
S0046	no
S0084	to be honest it probably be there when she buy it and she probably doesn't give two hoot
S0041	yeah
S0046	and in all fairness if she really want to get bloody technical that should be
S0084	when be the last time that be check
S0046	october last year
S0041	yeah
S0046	accord to this
S0041	yeah we're dead we're all go to die

S0046	yeah
S0041	ooh so when we set on fire
S0084	right can you mention that to tomorrow with your list of grievances the fact that the fire extinguisher won't work
S0046	and that
S0084	be fuck
S0046	quite clearly you know i know all you gotta do be pull that down but
S0084	i don't i don't trust it
S0046	i bet you i bet you will know what that be
S0084	certainly doesn't know what the code be
S0041	no
S0084	well i've i've me and know what the code be
S0046	what the fire panel

S0084	no but only me and be here last time hasn't see it
S0041	no
S0084	hasn't see it cook me
S0046	it's easy it do freak you out though the first time it go off
S0084	it's just the noise it's so intense it's like in your brain
S0046	i be here on my own when it first go off
S0084	ah

S0046	you know and a bed that's fuck
S0084	mm
S0046	you know
S0084	so what's gonna do then
S0046	i don't know i haven't speak i didn't speak to her about the bed
S0084	mm
S0046	she's get my wardrobe well just the drawers
S0084	lordy
S0041	what's this now what
S0046	no i be just tell about and the bed
S0041	oh yeah a bed for fifty quid you wouldn't turn it down for a dint would you
S0084	no
S0046	nice divan bed as well
S0084	oh she like them
S0046	yeah and all it have be a little dent in it
S0084	she like them with nail stick out of them though
S0041	yes she do you probably it be probably in too good nick for i mean if you still have spring in the bed i think em it's get to be a definite no
S0046	no i need a new mattress as well cos i think what i might do
S0084	i need to try and turn mine i've start lay in the middle of my bed all the time cos there's only me at the moment and i think there's like a dip in the middle now
S0041	just flip it over it'll be fine i need to get a new frame for mine mine's when my frame be free wasn't it i get it from freecycle so
S0046	oh do you
S0084	yeah
S0041	winner i think that's a winner of a frame you don't need a new one
S0046	it might just need to tighten up and a few drill hole put in somewhere
S0084	yeah it's just eh it's just really cheap it's probably like an argos spesh
S0041	oh
S0084	which be fine
S0041	i think you'll find
S0084	but i like the you know the bed itself cos i've get the old dodgy mattress that that free bed come with and then my lovely eh sleep time loveliness memory foam one on the top
S0041	yeah
S0084	so it's quite deep
S0046	but when i move if i move that will go and then i'll just keep the frame and then i'll just get a a nice frame when i find one that's
S0046	yeah
S0084	like not two hundred pound
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos that's how much the foam cost
S0046	no i definitely definitely definitely need a new mattress but i think i'm gonna hold out i'm not gonna spend all that money on a mattress when i might not need it
S0041	it's a bite of an issue
S0084	well yeah i mean you're only in a single bed at the moment aren't you because
S0041	yeah
S0084	so if you move somewhere else you might have a double bed so
S0046	yeah
S0084	you might as well stay put
S0041	get yourself an airbed
S0084	or get i mean if it's that bad get to get you one i mean if you can say to that this be just not acceptable she
