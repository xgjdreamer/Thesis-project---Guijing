S0266	so you be tell me what about work your new job or your old job for three years
S0272	yeah well it's three years now i've be work at that job yeah so lot of things i prefer erm lot some things i don't so i spend nearly twenty years be self employ so the transition from go from be self employ to be employ be actually mm in some ways difficult and some ways easy erm so that be suddenly have to be at the most difficult be have to be at my desk at eight o'clock every morning i hat that cos that's the latest you can start at so i use to have flexibility on when i start when i be self employ so that wasn't quite so easy but you know like anything you get into a routine and you get use to it erm and we do finish at lunchtime on a friday because you work four longer days and half a day on a friday and that's quite nice i don't miss at all erm look constantly think i've get to find new work that be i i didn't realise until i didn't have to do it anymore quite how stressful that be always look over your shoulder think what's the next thing that's come along and erm you know go network and you know have to be nice all the time
S0272	and you know sort of all of those sort of things actually i don't miss that at all erm but i do miss a little bite of the flexibility of the job you know so you know if i suddenly want to have a hence you probably haven't see me so much because i just can't stop because i can't stop and have a coffee morning or stuff like that that i use to
S0273	no cos when when you're self employ you can organise it to suit yourself can't you
S0272	yeah exactly
S0273	it's just whatever suit you and if you want to take time off that's fine
S0272	yeah exactly well i mean i use to just plug out my diary and nobody use to know what i be do
S0273	no
S0272	really it be up to me and if i say somebody ring up and say oh do you want erm you know can you can i have an appointment then and if i look up no i'm have coffee with i can't it's really inconvenient for me
S0273	i wish i could have persuade to work on that principle
S0272	er well erm yeah i'll i'll erm i mean and it's interest i find i be very i be not very confident about do do that to start with when i first start but i gradually get better and better at realise that actually if you say you couldn't do it it doesn't mean to say they're gonna run away to somebody else they've often oh right okay well let's see if we can find another day that suit us
S0273	yeah i can't do it then
S0272	exactly
S0273	not that i can't do it at all
S0272	i can't do it at all exactly right so in the end i erm i get more confident erm about just say to people well erm and if it be really really the only time and i be gonna lose out on that then in the end i use to say okay well let me go and speak to the person concern see if i can move that and come back to you i'd ring you up and say
S0272	can't make that coffee can you make it another time and we'd change it but erm
S0273	see this be something that annoy me intensely with over the years the number of time he know he he want to do this or he's get this book and he'll book something else and he book himself into ridiculous arrangements of have to be opposite end of the country on the same day
S0272	yeah
S0273	consecutive days and not not just say even if it wasn't true not just say i can't do that day i'm already book the number of time i well just tell them you can't do it
S0272	do it mm
S0273	if you have something else book you couldn't do it
S0272	that's right
S0273	mm
S0272	it take years i be surprise he didn't didn't eventually get to that stage because i get force into it on a number of occasion because it be things that the children want to do i be involve with something at school or something like that and i really really want to be there and they be sort of non negotiable really
S0273	mm
S0272	in term of well if i lose that contract i lose it because it's actually more important to me that i'm there for the children but then what i start to realise that actually as you say it isn't wasn't that i didn't want to do it at all it be just that i couldn't do it at that time the more i erm say i can't i'm sorry i that i'm actually do something that day i'm already book be it possible how about this and that and the other
S0273	mm yeah
S0272	i be surprise how often you know ninety five percent of the time people be yeah of course that's fine
S0273	yeah yeah course they're in the same position often themselves so once they
S0272	i know
S0273	get to make a
S0272	but he never get to that stage
S0273	oh well he do from time to time he be just so annoy the number of time be couldn't be somewhere because have to back himself into a ridiculous corner
S0272	mm well we all do that on occasion i wonder if he look back and regret that now
S0273	i don't think he'd regret it but he certainly doesn't miss it
S0272	yeah
S0273	erm yeah he go off last week go on monday even cos he have to be wherever he be on tuesday say oh this be just like old time don't miss it then
S0272	mm yeah say the same thing he doesn't miss it
S0273	no it's go it's over he not not pin for it at all
S0272	yeah yeah i know it's interest but i think that's actually quite an important thing i be talk about that with a i've make one particular friend at and erm we be have lunch last week both of us be talk she's a little bite younger than me but both of us be talk about the fact of erm when we retire and where what we're go to do and who we'd keep up with
S0273	mm
S0272	in term of that in term of er work erm and it's quite interest when you start to review that and i really like my job and i really like the people i work with and i really like i cos of the nature of the job i'm involve with a lot of people across the whole group and they're all really nice people
S0266	so what what exactly do you do
S0272	so i be responsible for all the education liaison that the company do so at the moment there be an enormous erm shortage of engineer in the uk so my role be to work with school universities put events on and increasingly work with er at government level on this issue around shortage of of erm engineer so it's sort of divide into quarter really erm in those four areas so it's because realise that they have to do something there be always bits that go on but nobody be coordinate it and nobody be actually give a strategy to it nobody just know what the other person be do cos it's a company that work very much in silos you know they've get these fifteen sixteen divisions that all work in silos and don't very often cross fertilise so er all the education stuff that they be do nobody know what be happen either so it be a bite ridiculous so you'd be in contact with and have a conversation and somebody'd say oh yes somebody from your company ring last week and we've do this this and this and you think oh well i want you to do this this and this and nobody do repeat so you know so they be all get irritate and there's no particular cohesion and strategy with erm with school either so that's sort of really what i do and i've just build i start absolutely nothing completely blank nobody have ever do the job before
S0266	that's quite nice though isn't it
S0272	so that be one of the reason that actually decide i decide to take it in the first place because of the fact it be a bite like be your own boss because there be nobody else look over you you could actually build it from scratch
S0273	and nobody say well so and so always use to do it this way
S0272	absolutely
S0273	yeah
S0272	yeah yeah so start with that that be actually quite a refresh thing to have actually that nobody else have do it before but it equally it be quite erm daunt
S0273	mm
S0272	because you have to sort of erm prove yourself if you see what i mean
S0273	and the other side of that be you didn't have somebody else's experience to draw on or anybody to ask
S0272	exactly exactly i didn't have anybody else's experience to draw on and erm so i have to sort of build it up for myself and and the first two weeks i be there the person i report into it happen to be a time where there be an enormous erm exhibition he he's head of communications and he's responsible for all uk erm all erm exhibitions across the world and there's a big one that happen biannually erm it be just come up about a fortnight after i join erm so i think he saw me for half an hour on the first day erm about erm an hour about five days later and then go away for two and a half weeks so didn't exactly give me a great deal of erm direction of what i should be do and erm so as a result i really have to start and build it all myself and i think actually look back if i hadn't of have that experience of be self employ i think it would have be very very difficult to do because if you're employ and a lot of people need some kind of direction because i didn't need any kind of direction cos i'd have to work on my own for a long time so erm and luckily be the sort of person he can be quite annoy on occasion because he can be so far the other way but he doesn't micromanage me
S0273	mm
S0272	and again i can't cope with be micromanaged yeah i'd go in and tell him the things he need to know the rest of the time i get on with it so that's fine so that's what i do
S0273	mm
S0266	so do you yeah that's what you but do you actually do any train
S0272	no i don't do any train anymore the bite that i miss i do a little bite of it but of the bite that i miss be the coach and at one point i be actually do some train for erm they they always say that they've get always say that they've get a mentor system for the new graduate come in but in reality they haven't and they certainly don't give these people any train so i actually do some train for the managers and so which be lovely thank you
S0266	do help yourselves
S0273	mm very nice
S0272	there's go to be a lot of crunch in this
S0266	that's alright
S0272	erm
S0266	fairly healthy stuff
S0272	erm so
S0266	who doesn't like celery
S0272	no i quite like celery
S0273	i'm fine
S0266	get some
S0272	i like celery just have some in a salad actually well it's great celery because it's suppose to
S0266	sorry
S0272	isn't it doesn't it consume more calories to digest it than it do actually have in it all together i think
S0273	that's the theory yeah
S0272	that's the theory yeah but whether it actually work or not
S0273	erm so yeah so anyway so that's basically what i do
S0266	so be you deal with all the universities and
S0272	yep
S0266	so what do you have to actually do
S0272	oh well i build up the relationships with them so that now we're do things like project with them erm obviously the career fair which i don't actually have totally responsibility for hr do that thank goodness i just go along to a few i feel like go to erm i help redo the graduate assessment process do all that recently erm do the apprentice assessment process recently so they they it's quite interest they call on me and use my hr and coach experience quite a lot when they need it but i don't do it as on a day to day basis i suppose but i quite so that's alright i quite like do that but i haven't really get time i wish i have more time to do the coach side but that's the bite that's the skill i'm sort of you lose a little bite which i'd like to have the opportunity to carry on with but you can't have everything in life can you so
S0266	but you're happy
S0272	mm
S0266	and what who who locally work there there must be a lot of people you know
S0272	mm there's quite a lot yeah but you'd be surprise how far people travel i be always under the feel that most people just do locally but there's one guy in my office that live in ross and one live in monmouth wales be quite popular they people live in sort of chepstow newport area erm erm gloucester

S0272	oh wow
S0273	which be the whole point of get a house in the first place
S0272	oh be it
S0273	well to hear her talk yes and it's get a cat flap so that's alright er so yeah i mean she's nicely settle cos she's be with for six years now
S0272	oh a long time isn't it
S0266	where do she meet from school or
S0273	she meet him through er tae kwon do in
S0266	gosh
S0273	but he be he's be a very good friend all the way through school of a lad who's her very best friend from school who also go to tae kwon do and the three of them have be live together for the last two years so they're all go their separate ways which be quite funny cos people keep say well you can take with you when you go to your new house
S0273	as though he be a cat or something so erm yeah they're they're very settle so they're like an old marry couple she's in charge
S0272	well
S0273	do as he's tell
S0272	do you think they will get marry
S0273	i don't know i think i be talk about this to 's mum last week and you know she's oh 'll get marry in a in an instant he he'd be he'd love to erm and never show any desire to you know i would have think it would be the other way round if anything because his parent have have quite an acrimonious divorce
S0272	oh
S0273	erm and you know would have think perhaps he be would be the one who would want to back away whereas she's get us and together forever so perhaps she want to go the other way but i they're quite happy and settle and if they never get marry they never get marry it's it's fine
S0272	i think
S0273	have an arrangement with a friend who's go to wear a hat at the wed for me if they do get marry
S0272	i think sometimes as well they they just they don't need to anymore do they
S0273	no
S0272	and i think sometimes maybe be she want children she might start think differently about it or she might not
S0273	mm i mean even then people very often don't do they there's just legal implications and complications and
S0272	yes yes that's the only thing you yeah yeah that's the only thing isn't it
S0273	but erm yeah she seem to be fine settle and if only i could say the same about
S0272	do he find some accommodation cos i
S0273	he do
S0272	oh good
S0273	yes
S0272	i be please on that day
S0273	cos yes well the follow day yes he's go he's go up back up to london today because there's something he have to do at the university tomorrow but he's not too sure what cos the timetable's all a bite vague but he have to be in tomorrow but he doesn't know why but he's go anyway
S0266	so be he study at the moment
S0273	mm
S0266	what's he study
S0273	he's do film production at
S0266	oh right
S0273	and unfortunately
S0266	and what year be he in
S0273	well he's just finish his
S0272	ah there's a story to that
S0273	oh well he's just finish his second year he's just start his second year they they want him to repeat the year er now he say it's purely because back just before easter he go to a party where somebody accidentally break a window and decide to be very responsible and sensible but in an alcoholic stupor of course and knock the remain glass out of the window so nobody would get hurt so consequently he have to have surgery on the tear cut tendon in his hand and that he have two piece of work to come in which he have to get an extension for and couldn't do very well and he say originally he say it be those two piece of work that they say be a problem and they couldn't decide whether he be capable of do the third year they didn't have enough to go on but he's be to show two piece of work that they say he hasn't give in and he say have which be a bite but you can never get to the bottom of anything with
S0272	well i know that's the problem when they're responsible and you can't it's not like be at school when you can ring up the teacher be it and ask
S0273	he i mean he swear he he give it all in and they yeah they have no record of it so so he's repeat his second year and er he's get somewhere to live and it all seem a bite more positive now so he's not snarl at me at the moment
S0272	well maybe in the long run it will be better for him
S0273	in some ways it could well be because i think he probably need a bite of a jolt to to make him realise that it's not just plain sail and he can't just coast along and he's gonna be with a bunch of people that he perhaps wouldn't have be with otherwise and mm he might get himself sort a bite
S0272	well i think i think it they need a sort of failure in life don't they sometimes
S0273	mm yeah
S0272	i think erm i think because of the type of parent that we've be all of us have be much more protective of our kid than certainly i experience as a as a child you can you come in and rescue them don't you and sort of sort things out and i think erm i think as a result they you know i i've be guilt it's just i'm not criticise you cos i'm very guilty of it
S0273	well yeah you do don't you if if you want to help you want to sort them out that's what we're here for
S0272	that's right but the think of my parent ever i mean i think it be i think it be just a completely different style of parent i mean my parent didn't i mean they care very much for me
S0273	mm
S0272	and we have a very good relationship but it be just different
S0273	well i i mean i don't know how true it be with other people but i be the first person in my family to go to university my parent have no understand
S0272	yeah
S0273	of what be involve and so fine you know it be up to me to get on and do the a level and so on whereas we've do it we've be there we've get the experience that we want to pass on and and help whereas our parent my parent didn't have the expertise or the knowledge
S0272	yeah
S0273	er so it's just sort of get on and do it which in some ways be probably better because you haven't you didn't then have parental pressure
S0272	no
S0273	encourage you try to we see it as encouragement they
S0272	no because my parent didn't know yeah absolutely they didn't know you know i remember them i remember my mother say be something about parent even you go my mum use to say well no i don't think so i don't think i'm a bite tire tonight i don't think i'll bother
S0272	and i'm think and i remember this distinctly because i'm think i would never have do that always i've turn up at parent even
S0273	always go to the parent well my mum do cos my dad work nights and i always felt terrible my mum's go on her own they'll think my dad doesn't care so
S0272	yeah
S0273	but you know one of them my dad go if he could er but certainly somebody always go
S0272	but you know when i
S0273	i can remember one occasion at when send a note round say that she be on a course there be two nights of parent even and she be on a course for one of them so she couldn't see everybody and you know could we let her know if we really need to see her otherwise and i say oh well don't bother and be absolutely furious what you're not go so we have an exchange
S0272	would have love it if i hadn't have go it because he be
S0273	well we have an exchange over the wall she alright yeah she's fine
S0272	yeah it's interest isn't it how it all how different it be but erm no i mean i just remember well i didn't go to university be the first person in our in our our erm family to go to university and erm so we so from that point of view i i start work at eighteen but i just look back and think you know if i'm short of money or anything i just didn't think to ring it's not that i didn't think they wouldn't help i just never i didn't have the mindset to think that i ring them and say oh i'm really a bite short this month could you help out
S0273	well they didn't have it
S0272	or they didn't have it that's right they didn't have it whereas my daughter ring yesterday and say oh mum i'm gonna really struggle to pay the rent this month could you pay this month's and then i'll
S0272	as i pay last month's
S0273	mm
S0272	as i be have to be a guarantor i do say to her i really do think at twenty seven that i'm actually feed up with this now i don't think i really wanna do this anymore she sort of look at me and say mm yes no you're probably right
S0273	well if they're rent there's always get to be a guarantor now
S0272	well there hasn't if you've get a permanent job
S0273	right yeah
S0272	but she's always mess around do this that and the other but hopefully she will be so the next one
S0273	do for this week
S0272	not not a problem when they're a student but she's not
S0272	she's do her two degrees and that's that's it so erm yeah oh well
S0273	suppose they'll all get there in the end
S0272	one hop so
S0273	mm
