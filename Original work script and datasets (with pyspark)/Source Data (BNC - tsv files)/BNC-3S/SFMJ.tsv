S0588	and they expect this sort of level of
S0590	yeah
S0588	brilliance it's just awful it's worse than it ever be
S0590	yeah
S0588	so if you're a young person now i mean in a way it put it off for three years doesn't it if you do a degree it kind of put off

S0588	the decision
S0590	it put it off yes
S0588	yeah
S0590	yes but erm yeah but you know when i be qualify as er in pure science
S0588	mm
S0590	er there be science erm what do you call them
S0590	exhibitions if you like
S0588	oh
S0590	when all the employers
S0588	okay
S0590	come up to
S0588	be there
S0590	university
S0588	to recruit
S0590	and there be booths around all the place ici courtaulds ferranti's
S0588	mm
S0590	every single er thing that employ scientists
S0588	okay
S0590	and they be more or less say you know we we be
S0588	come and work for us
S0590	we've get these job that be available
S0588	wow
S0590	would you like we be we be base in whatever
S0588	that's nice
S0590	and just swanned in no i don't i don't want to walk work in stroud and be along to the next one
S0588	oh how lovely
S0590	and you could have leave with
S0588	that wouldn't happen now
S0590	you know an assure job no
S0590	and in actual fact courtaulds the the year i be graduate they be there and er something like three or four years later for the next decade they didn't employ a single scientist so it it
S0588	yeah
S0590	it cut off
S0588	yes
S0590	really quite quickly
S0588	yeah
S0590	er just a few years after i graduate but you know we could have get just
S0588	and that's science as well
S0590	anything anywhere
S0588	i mean
S0590	yeah
S0588	art
S0590	yeah mind you
S0588	anything artistic
S0590	if you're a maths teacher or a physics teacher you could walk into a job
S0588	well that's the thing
S0590	just like that
S0588	with be a teacher isn't it it's
S0590	yeah
S0588	you and people always need teachers
S0590	well exactly yes yeah
S0588	and so
S0590	and it's a
S0588	that be the most sensible thing to go for
S0590	it's yeah
S0588	in your life isn't it
S0590	it be and it's also a very mobile career
S0588	yeah
S0590	because you know
S0588	exactly
S0590	it's every single town
S0588	mm
S0590	have school yeah
S0588	yeah it's very difficult when you're young to think about to think
S0590	yeah what
S0588	what to do
S0590	what to yes
S0588	but then i think the question to ask be what sort of life do you want this be what i'd ask do you want money in life things like that
S0590	yeah
S0588	and how much money do you want
S0590	yeah
S0588	erm
S0590	yeah
S0588	and they're the sort of question that be
S0590	mm
S0588	but the problem be your what you want change so you might not be bother about that
S0590	because after all
S0588	at a crucial time
S0590	and your experience be nil
S0588	yes
S0590	in a sense you're
S0588	yeah
S0590	er it would be easy
S0588	exactly
S0590	now to answer
S0588	no exactly
S0590	question and you
S0588	i know
S0590	so you can go back and be twenty again
S0588	and you're not bother when you're that age
S0590	yeah no
S0588	and and those things don't matter like
S0590	mm mm
S0588	own a house
S0590	yeah
S0588	doesn't really mean anything
S0590	no
S0588	cos you don't know what not own a house
S0590	house be yes
S0588	be
S0590	be yeah
S0588	cos it's all there on a plate
S0590	yeah
S0588	for you and
S0590	mm
S0588	erm and later on it start to matter and then you haven't do what it take to get those things
S0590	things no
S0588	that be my thing cos i
S0590	mm
S0588	i find out later what i want and then it's like oh damn it i haven't really
S0590	haven't
S0588	haven't sort it out
S0590	tread the right step
S0588	yeah oh look at this this be a terrible mess
S0589	's little paw
S0588	and that
S0589	it could be that chemical you see
S0588	we'll have to wash it cos it's well luckily it do wash well
S0590	yeah
S0588	well luckily it do wash
S0590	well do do say anything about reclaim it when she come back or not
S0588	no she didn't
S0590	no she didn't
S0588	mention that
S0590	no
S0588	oh true cos she'll be back in a year won't she
S0590	yeah but mind you they're do the house they they're certainly but
S0588	yeah
S0590	i suspect
S0588	we might be sofaless
S0590	well i suspect that she won't
S0589	we shall see
S0590	yes yes
S0588	she might want a new one
S0590	yes yes or she might see something that's more
S0588	yeah
S0590	period like
S0588	but i do think that you can always take step at whatever stage in life
S0590	yeah
S0588	and so you go i want that what do i have to do to get it and then you can
S0590	yes and it's never too late
S0588	you can do something i mean it's not too late no
S0590	no
S0588	i don't think it's ever too late
S0590	mm oh look at
S0588	but 's so lucky though she's almost get three set of parent she's get you and almost like another set of parent
S0590	parent yes yeah we be actually i mean yes yeah

S0590	her own mum
S0588	her own mum and she's get her dad
S0590	yeah

S0589	well the brown be
S0588	and they wash and every now and then we wash them don't we no this one hasn't be wash yet have it
S0589	no i'm still not convince that's real
S0588	really oh then that would be trade descriptions
S0590	be they suppose to be real fur
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah i always think the white one be
S0588	yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	it be
S0590	and the other one certainly
S0588	mm
S0590	in fact apparently the the reverse have be find that people have buy things with collar or whatever
S0588	yes that be call fake fur
S0590	as false fur and it's turn
S0588	yes
S0590	out that they're real
S0588	and there's be there's a bite there's a bite of a fuss about that
S0590	yeah which do seem rather weird
S0588	cos
S0590	doesn't it
S0588	yes it do
S0590	and of course people get
S0588	but people want fake fur
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	now i suppose you just the only safe way would be to just not have fur at all but
S0590	yeah
S0588	i mean fur be lovely
S0590	yeah i've get a i've get
S0588	yeah
S0590	the well a black persian lamb
S0588	but you kind of can't well i suppose lamb's not so bad
S0590	yeah that can't be actually because
S0588	because
S0590	you know after we we eat lamb
S0588	we're eat them anyway
S0590	yeah exactly so the skin have
S0588	yeah
S0590	gotta be use somewhere
S0588	you might as
S0590	yeah
S0588	might as well use it
S0590	yeah
S0588	you know oh
S0590	i suppose if you be wear a fur coat and you know
S0588	of an
S0590	that be something else
S0588	endanger species
S0590	then you you could just say this be a peruvian lamb or something yeah
S0588	i mean if you wear a leopard then that's morally
S0590	yes ah yeah now that's
S0588	questionable
S0590	yes that that be actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	yes yes
S0588	now nowadays erm but in the twenties they use to actually kind of almost wear fox didn't they
S0590	oh they do my mother yes

S0590	yeah
S0588	but yeah
S0590	there it be with its little head
S0588	yeah yeah
S0590	yeah
S0588	have there be any action opposite
S0590	no we get quite excite earlier
S0590	because we actually think that some people be come to look at the house and it turn out that they be jehovah witness or
S0588	oh
S0590	like that actually who be erm er
S0588	bloody christians
S0590	er yes exactly yeah
S0588	i want some action why aren't they come it's saturday
S0590	no it's not oh yeah it be actually of course it be yeah
S0588	there's not much go on be there consider
S0590	no yeah it's er yeah
S0588	i hope he manage to sell it
S0590	i think he's
S0588	he
S0590	bind to but
S0588	yeah well i suppose everything take these things take age though don't they
S0590	well they certainly can yeah
S0588	but then there's no forward chain on this one there be at least that
S0590	yeah
S0588	it's a funny thing a chain isn't it
S0590	yes
S0588	the house chain thing
S0590	oh it's
S0588	and it only end when
S0590	it's horrendous actually
S0588	well when do a chain ever
S0590	end
S0588	end if somebody
S0590	well er it always start with a
S0588	have die
S0590	usually a first time buyer wait a minute we be that yeah
S0588	so we didn't have a chain no they'd already move out so i suppose if
S0590	yeah
S0588	people move out anyway
S0590	yeah you you and you be not come from a chain
S0588	no that's right
S0590	if you'd own
S0588	yeah
S0590	then you would have be sell that
S0588	yeah
S0590	to somebody else and i suppose
S0588	and it all have to time
S0590	yes oh god yes
S0588	perfectly
S0590	and
S0588	and oh
S0590	it's very very difficult
S0588	yeah really difficult
S0590	actually yeah
S0588	cos the whole chain's
S0590	yeah
S0588	get to be time
S0590	yeah cos in actual fact
S0588	so
S0590	er
S0588	but if you chase the if you trace the chain it would go everywhere wouldn't it
S0590	yeah well
S0588	it would be like a house here a house there a house there
S0590	yeah oh yeah could be all
S0588	yeah
S0590	all over the place yeah when we sell number you know because we have always have such good neighbour we we actually hold a drink party
S0588	oh that's nice
S0590	to to introduce and to to the neighbour
S0588	yeah
S0590	and it be for a sunday morning and er when they er arrive on that sunday it follow the saturday when their buyer have a problem with sell their house
S0588	oh
S0590	so in actual fact we be go to be exchange in july
S0588	yeah
S0590	and this be the begin of july
S0588	yes
S0590	when there be a problem that
S0590	rosed it rise its head
S0588	yeah
S0590	raise its head
S0588	yeah
S0590	over something
S0588	arise
S0590	something to do with a path i think actually er

S0588	yeah
S0590	with the with the party
S0588	yes
S0590	erm we could you know

S0588	isn't it
S0590	yeah
S0588	right the way through you just never know if it's go to actually happen i suppose

S0590	they would they'd probably call your study
S0588	they'd have to
S0590	a bedroom you know
