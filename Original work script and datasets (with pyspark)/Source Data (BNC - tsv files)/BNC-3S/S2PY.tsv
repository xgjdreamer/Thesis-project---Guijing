S0008	yeah but i mean you get grant for tuition you don't get grant for maintenance
S0013	mm yeah mm

S0012	yeah
S0008	the kid in debt right
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0013	mm yeah
S0008	you know there's a lot of people like
S0013	which be what he's do

S0008	there's a lot of people who
S0012	otherwise you just have to get loan don't you
S0008	's friends you know she meet
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know their mummies and daddies pay all everything off as they go
S0013	yeah

S0013	yeah
S0012	whereas finish up with how much
S0013	still owe still owe
S0012	they're still pay off
S0008	yeah well it's same as
S0013	erm yeah
S0012	still
S0008	i think 's owe
S0013	i don't know about
S0008	twenty grand or something
S0012	yeah
S0008	owe about eighteen grand
S0013	yeah awful ain't it
S0008	still he's pay his back but he still owe about
S0013	yeah
S0008	god know how many thousand
S0013	yeah
S0012	it's ridiculous really ain't it
S0013	shame ain't it
S0012	free education at one time in this country now you have
S0013	but they be con really weren't they cos it be it be suppose to be nought percent finance and then they stick on
S0012	three percent
S0008	well this be it they start you know depend when you take your grant out
S0012	yeah
S0008	like er you know your loan cos it start out at nought percent
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	interest right
S0013	mm
S0008	and then they say ah well then it's something like two percent
S0012	yeah
S0008	straight two percent then they say oh well then it's
S0013	cost of live
S0008	something you know cost of whatever it be i don't know
S0013	yeah inflation
S0008	inflation
S0013	mm
S0008	plus something else
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	when people who work you know because when it start off it be only five thousand a year weren't it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	now it's nine thousand
S0012	well if you if you work out
S0013	mm
S0012	they they've put it up to three percent i think you've gotta pay and it start off at at nothing and now it's three percent
S0008	mm
S0012	well if if you're go to university now and you spend and that cost you nine thousand quid or something like that to go three percent of nine thousand pound per year ain't it
S0008	well the thing be it's not just
S0013	mm
S0008	nine thousand that's just tuition
S0012	yeah
S0008	you need another five grand on top of that
S0012	well you do yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	just to pay your rent
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	so that's fourteen thousand a year
S0013	mm
S0008	you know and the thing be before the interest only start when you finish
S0012	yeah
S0008	now the interest start as soon as you take it out
S0012	as soon as you take it out yeah yeah
S0008	i mean it's just er i dunno what the the idea of it be cos i mean the government be lose millions on it
S0013	mm
S0008	you know the scheme
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it's just the way er cos like er you know they stop give universities direct grant
S0012	yeah
S0008	so the university through student loan and then the government be have to pay back you know i mean something like thirty percent of student loan be pay back
S0012	yeah
S0008	and seventy percent be not and the government have to pay that back
S0012	yeah course they do
S0013	mm
S0008	and so they you know it's just a matter of go round the house the government be still pay
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah they be aren't they still pay the original
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	weird so how these student loan how be you suppose to pay anything back
S0008	how do you mean
S0012	well the interest on em
S0008	well what happen be
S0008	be that when you earn more than
S0013	fifteen thousand isn't it or something
S0008	be it fifteen or sixteen thousand
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh then you have to start pay back
S0008	you then pay back a proportion equivalent you know it's a proportion of what you earn
S0012	yeah
S0008	be something like five percent of everything above sixteen thousand
S0012	oh right
S0008	or maybe less or more but
S0013	mm
S0008	it's it's just like pay an extra income tax really
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	it's just that you get sixteen thousand tax free and then you pay above the rest
S0012	yeah
S0008	so you know if you're earn cos you know the theory be that everyone who finish university would get
S0012	would gotta get a good job
S0008	would get a job and you know thirty grand
S0013	yeah
S0008	start off at thirty grand so they could easily afford it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	but they suddenly realise that if half the population
S0013	yeah
S0008	have get a degree
S0008	there ain't that many job that be you know pay that money
S0012	no
S0008	i mean
S0013	they drop out anyway don't they mm
S0012	get her degree never do use it really do she she work for a wine company
S0013	yeah
S0008	mm
S0012	i mean she
S0013	well she work for first didn't she
S0012	first oh yeah
S0008	mm
S0013	and then er because digital come out just after she finish
S0012	yeah just after she'd finish her photography
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	then it become digital
S0013	so it's totally different really
S0012	so everything be different
S0008	yeah
S0012	so she be no good at photography
S0013	and then yeah they they sort of close down didn't they
S0008	yeah yeah have go
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i mean this be the same with really
S0013	mm
S0008	i mean she do a degree and never use it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah yeah
S0012	but 's do really well for herself luckily
S0008	mm
S0008	well same with i mean she's get a good job

S0013	start when be bear that be youngest be bear so it didn't count for the other years
S0012	it didn't count for
S0008	yeah but it still would've be
S0012	nineteen sixty and seventy one
S0008	but it still would have be sixteen years
S0013	but i be work all that time anyway
S0008	yeah
S0013	just have cos i have low income they suggest you didn't have to pay
S0008	oh right
S0013	so i get an exemption certificate
S0008	mm
S0013	to say because i've get such a low income
S0008	yeah
S0013	i didn't have to pay the insurance thing
S0012	no the stamp

S0013	yeah we'll give you an exemption certificate
S0008	mm
S0013	cos of your low income

S0008	you know the thing be er that
S0013	yeah wasn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you be quite you know in one way you be more lucky cos like as far as you're concern you need thirty years' stamp

S0008	i mean from next year you're gonna need thirty five years' stamp
S0012	that's right yeah

S0008	yeah but it's not not much in the in the scheme of things be it
S0012	not really no
S0008	but it's like have it in the bank and
S0013	it depend how long
S0008	how long you're gonna be on
