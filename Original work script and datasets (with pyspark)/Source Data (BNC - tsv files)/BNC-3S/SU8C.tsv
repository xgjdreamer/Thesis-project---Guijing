S0012	well yeah
S0008	cos they wouldn't have to worry about it when they're all privatise would they
S0012	now now they're and they're pull the army out of afghanistan
S0008	mm
S0012	that's not gonna cost them much either be it

S0008	mm
S0012	they're more or less redundant now aren't they
S0008	well they're always no they have a a stand army don't they of
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	several tens of thousands
S0012	but they
S0008	of people but you see for every soldier on the grind you need like ten people to
S0012	to cos you
S0008	to organise them
S0012	yeah yeah yeah all the
S0008	yeah
S0012	they just
S0008	but when you look at that and that camp bastion they build
S0013	mm
S0012	god
S0008	you know you've see picture of that on telly
S0013	mm
S0008	there's a town the size of read
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you and they've just abandon it and you think well i think it cost nine billion or something to build didn't it
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0013	really
S0008	and you think if they'd have spend that money in britain
S0012	on hospitals
S0012	and school
S0008	even on
S0013	yeah
S0008	repair the roads and that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but like you say hospitals where instead they put
S0013	yeah
S0008	hospitals out to private tender
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	and like for the norfolk and norwich hospital
S0012	mm
S0008	it's gonna cost over a billion pound
S0012	yeah
S0008	by the time we've pay for it
S0012	yeah
S0008	for a hospital that cost two hundred million
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	i mean you know it's
S0013	yeah the world's crazy
S0008	you know it's er they say it's the equivalent of of buy a house on a credit card
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	that's the that's the amount of
S0013	you're pay in the
S0008	interest you're pay rather than like the three or four
S0012	pay them
S0008	percent
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah yeah they how much be they pay
S0008	thirty five million a year aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	for thirty five years
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	for something that only cost two hundred million
S0013	oh
S0008	in the first place
S0012	but they say they offset it by give a load of money to ireland and charge them ireland and charge them a whole lot of interest didn't they
S0008	oh right yeah yeah yeah bail them out
S0012	yeah
S0008	but
S0012	bail er ireland out
S0008	yeah
S0012	and charge them i think they've charge them
S0008	but you know
S0012	six percent haven't they
S0008	it's sort of like you know they say like they can't improve the a47 you know cos that'll cost two hundred million or something
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but two hundred million be absolutely
S0012	no it's chickenfeed to what they've be spend innit
S0008	mm
S0012	and what they're go to spend in the future anyway
S0008	that's right i remember someone when all this pfi stuff be come out about
S0012	yeah
S0008	build hospitals and that and i be have this argument with someone and say well what you know the government could easily pay for that
S0012	of course they could
S0008	yeah and and they could create government bond pay three percent to pay for it
S0012	yeah
S0008	whereas you know people could just invest in it privately
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and rather than give it these for and someone be say argue they be say yeah well the government ain't get the money they can't afford to do that and you think the government could just i mean they've just print what be it three hundred billion
S0012	they have
S0008	er pound haven't they
S0012	they have yeah
S0008	just make it out of nothing
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean they can
S0012	they
S0008	fish money out of fresh air can't they
S0012	of course they can
S0013	mm
S0008	it's amaze when you think about like big sum of money innit
S0012	that be an er i mean they they talk about or they use millions and billions like we use pound
S0008	yeah
S0012	you know
S0013	yeah
S0012	and fivers
S0008	well it be only
S0013	mm
S0008	about ten years ago that people start talk in billions didn't they
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	yeah and before that it be
S0013	yeah
S0008	millions and then suddenly
S0012	yeah
S0008	it be billions now everything's billions
S0012	well in in the year two thousand the the actual debt our debt go up to the one trillion for the first time

S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah a million million innit
S0012	and now it's go up to one point
S0013	really
S0012	six trillion or something like that
S0008	but they say but it doesn't matter you know what it be
S0012	no it don't matter
S0008	cos you're never gonna have to pay it
S0012	no
S0012	so who be the
S0008	and if you have to pay it then you'd draw back all the money which other countries owe us
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and which be probably our you know this national debt figure be probably offset completely
S0012	by what we're
S0008	by what be owe us
S0012	yes that's right yeah but the biggest debt though in er in in the world at the moment be america isn't it
S0008	mm they have get untold debt you couldn't even imagine
S0012	you can't imagine the debt they've get now
S0008	and it's still what be it america produce a third of all
S0012	yeah
S0008	stuff in the world
S0012	all the world yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	incredible innit
S0012	yeah so er i i
S0013	why
S0012	i don't get mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	how do they
S0008	well it's it's it's just
S0012	be it the vietnam war and stuff like that be it
S0008	it's just what what they their debt be
S0012	yeah
S0008	well it's just like general stuff isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	which they owe money all over the place
S0012	and nobody's ever go to get it back be they
S0008	no
S0012	i mean argentina they've say no that's it right
S0008	mm
S0012	we're wipe out all our
S0008	yeah but argentina be like on the world stage be like durham in
S0012	yeah
S0008	great britain you know i mean
S0012	yeah it's true
S0008	i mean the the debt argentina there's all this fuss about argentina's debt it's probably the equivalent of what the common market have ask britain for to pay
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	oh can you pay us one point seven a billion pound by the first of december
S0012	december
S0013	mm
S0008	i mean it's like that isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	for argentina it's like the whole country's debt you know
S0012	yeah yeah he's say no so far ain't he
S0008	who
S0012	have he not cameron he
S0008	well it's it's just so it's er nonsensical
S0012	yeah
S0008	that you know it's just political
S0012	yeah er political
S0008	it's a bite like that ukraine stuff do you see what's happen now in europe get a third of its gas from russia
S0012	that's right yeah they do yeah
S0008	alright and europe have get this embargo on trade with russia
S0012	russia yeah
S0008	alright and russia export you know something like seventy percent of its gas through ukraine
S0012	yeah
S0008	which doesn't pay its bill and owe russia
S0012	load of money
S0008	something like three point eight billion rubles
S0012	yeah
S0008	or dollars and russia be now ask them to pay it upfront either pay the debt off or pay upfront before they have any more and you know so if they close the pipeline down then europe doesn't get its gas but europe have just agree some deal with russia that europe will guarantee ukraine's debt with russia for gas as long as russia keep pump gas into europe
S0012	oh i see
S0008	so europe have now give ukraine basically you know three point six billion
S0013	right
S0008	euros
S0012	yeah
S0008	which they be now have to but ukraine ain't gonna get it it's go straight to russia
S0012	to russia yeah

S0012	ah your well
S0008	you know it it only work

S0008	and that be like several billion pound worth and they say oh well we'll we'll not deliver it and you say oh yeah
S0008	i'm sure france be gonna turn their nose up at get
S0012	well that's right
S0008	a couple of billion pound or or whatever
S0012	well what would they want with a ship like that for
S0008	yeah
S0012	they don't want to do it
S0008	no they'd rather have the money i'm sure

S0008	and of course what happen be oh forget about that and if you do sort of investigate it oh yeah well the deal go through and that ship be now in the russian navy
S0012	that's right yeah yeah
S0008	i mean there's there's so much rubbish talk about all this stuff

S0008	you know but i mean she's get
S0012	that's their their
S0008	but she's get bona fide expense
S0012	yeah
S0008	which you know if you be a millionaire or a or a erm er mp
S0013	yeah you just claim
S0008	you know you just claim barefaced for them
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then everyone'll say oh yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	or er or worse you know but i mean she just the only thing she's she's sort of claim for which be er you know which add up be like use the car right and they say
S0012	yeah
S0008	well you can't claim for travel to work she say yeah but i need my car to transport all my stuff which i have to carry cos i can't carry it
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	you know cos i'm self employ you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i haven't get anywhere at work to keep it so i have to you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be a bona fide you know
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	how else would you get it there
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know no that won't count and by their manner they sort of say well you know if you wanna challenge this you know you have to go to the you know this and this and this and they'll have to inspect all your book and everything and all this lot and you think oh
S0013	mm
S0008	you know you're not gonna go through that rigmarole
S0012	no no
S0013	but if you be self employ you can claim can't you for for your
S0008	well that's right yeah
S0012	you're suppose to be able to claim for er
S0013	so be she
S0012	travel and
S0008	well off off her tax
S0013	self employ or
S0008	off her tax she do
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	she claim all this and it's all allow on the tax form
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and she claim for that but you see tax credit
S0013	mm
S0008	won't allow it
S0012	oh i see
S0008	they say you can't do it you see it's a different branch
S0013	but be that cos she's pay by the education department
S0008	that's right
S0013	yeah oh
S0008	they pay her
S0013	mm
S0008	sort of paye
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	so that make a difference
S0008	because they won't pay her as a self employ person
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know and and that be because in the past you have so many people who be sort of senior managers and that say oh i'm gonna resign and i'm gonna be a self employ consultant
S0012	yeah
S0008	and when you work
S0013	oh
S0008	then they'd work for theem again the same but
S0012	yeah
S0008	on a monthly
S0012	monthly
S0008	fee
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	rather than a monthly wage
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	which mean that they save pay national insurance
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know the the company save pay national insurance
S0012	yeah
S0008	and all this other stuff
S0013	yeah
S0008	and these people be get and claim load and load of expense because they be self employ now
S0012	yeah
S0008	and not pay any tax you know
S0012	amaze ain't it
S0013	mm
S0008	and the government crack down on that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and so and now people like who be actually self employ you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	can't get pay
S0013	mm
S0008	on an invoice you know i mean if she er you know really she should just you know send an invoice in to the er
S0013	that's right
S0008	the the er
S0013	this be what i charge
S0008	the office
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and get the money
S0012	yeah
S0008	for what she's owe
S0013	mm mm
S0008	but er but because they won't do that and then
S0013	yeah
S0008	the tax credit people get in touch with the er pay people paye people
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0013	and suddenly this year they say oh we see that you have earn blah blah blah from this and college and blah blah and this much from county council you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	so they already have the figure
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but they be like i say gross
S0012	gross yeah
S0008	pay before the deductions
S0013	yeah
S0008	which put her over the limit and see there's a limit of something like thirteen thousand
S0012	yeah
S0013	tut yeah
S0012	so they'd do it on gross instead of net then
S0008	yeah
S0012	that's disgust
S0013	mm
S0012	ain't it
S0013	mm
S0008	and you know so didn't
S0013	yeah
S0008	didn't really have a leg to stand on if they'd cos they'd change the rule you see
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	they move the goalposts all the time though don't they
S0008	that's right
S0013	they do
S0008	but i mean you can imagine that you know they're do exactly the same with people on work tax credit
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know you go down the jobcentre and you have to prove that you've apply for x number of job
S0012	so many job

S0008	private
S0012	it be a private place in norwich in actual fact
S0008	mm
S0012	this woman from norwich own the house or the bungalow

S0012	we need some we need some money anyhow she owe her seventeen thousand and in the end he she get the bailiffs in
S0008	mm
S0012	to get her out so the bailiffs get her out and then er the council have to rehouse her somewhere
S0008	mm
S0012	cos she have six kid

S0012	but when they go into the house there weren't a stick of furniture leave she'd sell all the furniture
S0013	she's wreck wasn't it completely wreck
S0012	and the place be absolutely wreck
S0013	it be awful

S0008	yeah why didn't she do something earlier
S0012	well this be the whole point
S0008	cos i mean the thing be
S0013	perhaps they never let them in
S0012	no
S0008	the thing be that these people why weren't they on house benefit
S0012	well that's right i mean
S0008	and i if you if i be

S0008	and then you'd get your money and they'd be
S0013	it's true yeah
S0012	but the the whole point be er about this this thing

S0008	no
S0012	in these erm
S0008	no no no
S0012	little bits and piece

S0013	mm
S0008	they aren't gonna pick the nice people who leave and leave every immaculate

S0008	when that person
S0012	when and they take over the house though you see they go in this room and they have a forty eight inch screen flat television on the wall
S0008	yeah
S0012	and they go in another room and that have another forty eight
S0013	really

S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean
S0013	mm
S0008	i notice this you know and you know a private house just be sell you know in the where i walk past in the even and the first thing they'd do be screw a massive great television on the wall

S0012	well he ain't
S0008	poor buddy

S0013	a state pension surely
S0008	keep me alive wouldn't it
S0008	well it's a lot more than i get
S0012	yeah
S0008	but
S0012	or all we live on be our state pension it's all we've get
S0008	but he he erm you know have this sort of you know different sort of thing yeah
S0012	lifestyle yeah
S0008	yeah he sort of want to go on holiday and
S0012	yeah whereas we
S0008	you know he's
S0012	we all live very frugally don't we
S0008	well that's right and he want to sort of drive all over the county and
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know and have you know like your sort of live car and put be able to put forty quid's worth of petrol in it whenever he want
S0012	well it only like twenty mile a gallon don't it
S0008	well i think he's get about thirty out of it
S0012	be he
S0008	which you know it ain't too bad i suppose
S0012	well
S0008	i think he's drive it a lot more carefully than he use to
S0008	and er yeah he erm i recently get another bill something else go wrong with the car what the hull be it
S0012	well i dunno why he want to keep it
S0008	well cos it still go well you see
S0012	yeah but it cost him a lot of money to keep it go well don't it
S0008	yeah i know but the trouble be be that like you say you buy another car
S0012	yeah that's true
S0008	and that could be just as you know like people don't sell their car you know it's go well
S0012	no they don't no
S0008	you know when they sell a car it's probably gonna need to something do to it or
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know whatever
S0012	what be the our our car call er who
S0013	what
S0012	when we go to buy this car they that's a certain they they get give it to people

S0012	nothing
S0013	no it's it's just a normal car but they
S0012	yeah i know but
S0008	well i think that's yeah cos people who who get mobility allowance
S0013	they provide them
S0012	yeah
S0008	they
S0013	with that car
S0008	get this allowance of something like i don't know whatever it be twenty quid a week

S0008	and you can just pay that straight to a garage and they'll just give you a car
S0012	that's it
S0008	a free car
S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah we think it be a good deal when we when we buy it
S0008	yeah well it's yeah i mean

S0008	more expense and that and as it happen he go round this breakers at which deal in them cars
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er you know oh yeah we can do one and they be like undo one off a car one of the breakers and you know it be only sort of like under two minutes off it come you know they clean it and give it to him thirty quid or something like that
S0008	like new ones be about two hundred quid i think
S0012	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0008	and he say and while we've get the hub down we'll just check the shock absorbers to make sure it's not leak and this one's oh oh this one's leak a bite oh well so what we do we just undo this nut here draw it out to the spring put a new one in when you're do this it's best to do the other one as well to balance it out and so we do you know and he go through it
