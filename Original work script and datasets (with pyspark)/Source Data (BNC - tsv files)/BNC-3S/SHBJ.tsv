S0180	you know when you get floaters you get floaters in your eye
S0070	no
S0180	bite frustrate
S0070	no i've just be notice over the last only a couple of months that when i read it's a bite blur
S0180	you can't see near i've get the opposite i can read with them off
S0070	can you
S0180	i can i can read now half a metre i can read it
S0070	okay
S0180	without my glass so you've get you be long sight
S0070	well apparently also i've get astigmatism
S0180	really
S0070	so so i've get some problem with they reckon i disagree with them cos you get so i go down to for an eye test and she say yeah the problem be we're so you need glass the short eh up close
S0180	it's all the read you've be do for the ma in
S0070	well maybe cos and i just think over the last little while it's cos i've be a bite tire or you know when you're tire it get a bite but apparently not apparently i need
S0180	oh no
S0070	and she say so so i've get varifocals
S0180	be these the ones you can just go into boot and buy off the shelf
S0070	well
S0180	read glass or you have to go in for a prescription
S0070	no because because she say there's some problem also with my right eye i think with distance
S0180	oh
S0070	she say do you have problems read road sign i say no not at all and i don't think i have when she put up her her chart up there and i read it quite well i think there be nothing wrong with that anyway so i get varifocals so apparently yeah you can't you can't get them off the peg can you so
S0180	no
S0070	and um two hundred and sixty pound
S0180	two hundred and sixty yeah i expect that
S0070	i have no idea
S0180	yeah
S0070	cos i go in there and i think that you know well as a student your eyesight be free test be free no it's not it's twenty eight pound and then
S0180	you get a student card
S0070	yeah but it's not you don't get any discount i say do you get discount he say yeah if you're an old age pensioner or a for glass
S0180	yeah for the test you get a discount
S0070	no
S0180	really
S0070	no no some place do but not but i go to vision express
S0180	get it free for the first year if it's a
S0070	oh really oh
S0180	and teeth as well apparently
S0070	and then and then and then they say lenses start from eighty pound and i say well
S0180	yeah
S0070	it's not gonna be eighty pound it would probably be like a hundred pound or something so i saw a pair of frame and i think oh okay it's gonna cost like two hundred quid altogether isn't it two hundred and sixty pound just for the lenses right i couldn't believe it
S0180	and the frame
S0070	well i have to reselect another pair i've gotta go back tomorrow and have a look
S0180	it's ridiculous but if you only use them for read just use a cheaper pair of frame but the lenses the cheapest be just two hundred and sixty
S0070	yeah
S0180	these might be especially varifocal
S0070	cos he start off with vary varifocal and then he say okay so we've get four ones the first ones which be excellent he say and of course i didn't know any price at this point i be still on eighty pound he say they be excellent they're scratch resistant de de de de three hundred and sixty pound and i just i didn't know what to say i didn't and i say you know i can't
S0180	it's scary but you can imagine if they if they privatise the nhs this what it will be like it's like there be four ways to chop off your leg
S0070	yeah
S0180	the first way be a bite more painful
S0070	for the
S0180	it's cheap though
S0070	the second one be you saw it off with a knife
S0180	no exactly
S0070	no but that's what it would be
S0180	for eighty pound more you can get an anaesthetic and fifty pound you get a pillow
S0070	yeah
S0070	you can imagine it can't you
S0180	that's what i call suspicious of the conservatives because like my mum work in nhs yes they do need reform you do see there's a lot of waste there go on
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	but that that's different from say that's different from privatise it
S0070	from privatise it yeah
S0180	you can reform something without privatise it in the way they might want to
S0070	yeah
S0180	along american line
S0070	yeah local subsidies
S0180	yeah it would be very i don't think people would accept that though but they know surely they know that most people wouldn't accept that
S0070	but then you know how would we not accept it how would we you know
S0180	people would get angry because they i think no i can't see it if that's privatise then hmm there's there's no no hope britain would be privatise it the nhs
S0070	yeah be that
S0180	hmm
S0070	no there isn't any hope but no it would be be shock wouldn't it
S0180	it would be it'd just be impossible wouldn't it what would happen if we do have what it would be the school systems like that the school system be not i think if they if they make the school system like nhs it would have be good but you know there's still in uk a lot of private school from the fifties onwards they've give they still let a lot of private school get away with be quite elitist
S0070	right
S0180	and you still get and in the uk now you've get
S0070	well and then the school i well the school i go to i maintain i didn't have a secondary education
S0180	really
S0070	it be it be a church school that that my parent pay for i mean we didn't do we didn't do anything
S0180	and they pay for it
S0070	yeah yeah i mean cos i suppose my parent sort of think oh we'll send them to private school that would be good for them
S0180	ooh
S0070	but my brother my brother be a pain in the ass and an asshole and a trouble maker so they didn't want him go to the local comprehensive school because he be a
S0180	a tearaway
S0070	yeah so he they send him into a school in and and because because you know i suppose he be my older brother and i want to go to in the same school as he do so they send me there but it be it be absolutely crap we didn't do anything like it be the kind of thing there be a few students who do who be kind of quite motivate and and engage with the class and i suppose come from families who who have some knowledge of education my parent didn't have any sort of real knowledge of education so you know when they come up do your homework yeah okay mm go out and play yeah yipee you know so so we didn't we didn't do anything and and you know the the where be there be no certain you know there be no ofsted then so you pay the money and that's it go in hang around come back again it's funny be say about in zambia cos i suppose again there you pay for education worth in africa because it's
S0180	yeah you pay for everything
S0070	you pay for everything
S0180	water
S0070	right yeah
S0180	like at the even if they now
S0070	yeah yeah and so so you then have cos she say she go to a school once and the teacher be lay down at the front of the class
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know and these be kid in front of a class of kid and he be pay to go there and i suppose they'd only pay a little bite if they pay a bite more he might have sit up if they pay a bite more he might have stand up pay a bite more he might have teach them something
S0180	about this all across the develop world
S0070	ah
S0180	you get a system like that there
S0070	what you pay for be what you get they don't get pen or pencil or paper they've get to bring their own paper
S0180	paper
S0070	and yeah yeah you can understand you know they're not you know but it's open to corruption then isn't it you know cos you pay a little bite you know well you can come and sit on a chair and you're not go to get teach anything
S0180	so my my cousin's daughter in kenya go to a school where some of the kid don't have enough to eat in the morning
S0070	yeah
S0180	so my aunt from australia who's go to kenya to do some charity work like have organise a kitchen so they can come and have breakfast and lunch
S0070	hmm
S0180	and be help her do that and i be shock and think hmm even the school that my cousin's daughter be go some kid be really quite poor you know she be say we need to go and do some voluntary work
S0070	hmm
S0180	because um to provide breakfast and lunch for these kid
S0070	hmm
S0180	get them in school
S0070	uh hmm
S0180	but they have like a huge gap between the elite school which be like you know have a dash of or whatever and then you have the opposite extreme it's an even bigger gap in those countries
S0183	can you hold him
S0070	yes
S0183	so i can get on with some stuff
S0180	aw be he sleep now
S0183	i wash his clothe
S0180	aw he make little noise try and take him out every day though cos fresh air's good for him and it just sort of sleep more more he's warm now ah he's so cute i would say that wouldn't i
S0070	i suppose so
S0180	aw he he sleep very well after feed he's sleep like that he's like conk out
S0070	yeah it's nice isn't it
S0180	mummy will wrap him up and i could just sit on the street and twiddle his dummy
S0070	well people would give you money there you go have some money you say yeah i can't afford to fee the baby down on the high street
S0180	i'll tell you what be so funny about people you know there's a wonderful old statue temperance you know the temperance statue they get well you know they have alcohol problems this year that they put these free water fountains they be talk about
S0070	i didn't know
S0180	so there's one in you know the church on
S0070	yeah
S0180	and it's the only spot where all the winos hang up and the fountains of this the temperance fountains don't work it's ironic isn't it they build that to give people water so they wouldn't drink so much gin and beer in the victorian time and drink and stuff and um now you just see all the drunks sit around it drink beer can and none of the fountains work just that whole i want to take a photo one day that's so ironic that scene
S0070	it be isn't it the fountains stop work long ago but the drunks be still here
S0180	but they sell those big beer can for a pound
S0070	that be shock like shock i've i've often think about that you know go past an off licence
S0180	yeah
S0070	and all those things be only design by alcoholics aren't they
S0180	oh yeah well a newsagent down here on road
S0070	hmm
S0180	every time i go in there for my morning paper on saturday or sunday there's a you know there's an old drink guy in there buy four for six can of tenant
S0070	yeah you get drink for a pound
S0180	yeah and he's always have some sort of drunken conversation with the poor woman behind the counter
S0070	yeah it's just mad and then you get those litres and white lighten cider i like a glass of cider but who else apart from
S0180	type of people who buy that
S0070	buy that and obviously it doesn't taste like cider but it taste like like rocket fuel cos for
S0180	the stigma but they they make it for the people
S0070	yeah yeah yeah and all that that like range of litter bottle that you get you know those little you know
S0180	yeah
S0180	whiskeys and you know what's that for then what's that one for or that one for or that one for
S0180	just for show you know
S0070	yeah you know and then all of those you know the cheap end of the whiskey you know your white stag your bell and teachers you know it's not you know sit at home and savour the taste of like it must be pretty weird to savour the taste of the whiskey anyway but
S0180	it be a weird the situation isn't it you can see a big bogey up there
S0070	you can suck it out put your mouth over it and suck it out yum yum baby bogey
S0180	be we record still ah twelve more minutes twelve more minutes to make half an hour
S0070	half an hour
S0180	but we shouldn't say that on the tape
S0070	i suppose not but it's an extra conversation
S0180	yeah he's put on about a kilo and a half since he's be bear so em
S0070	how long when be he bear nearly a month ago
S0180	five weeks ago
S0070	five weeks
S0180	eh five weeks on sunday about four and a half weeks ago he's one month but he he can sleep through it's amaze how they can sleep through conversations cos i can have i can have the radio on and wendy might be hoover and he'll still be sleep because they they have a way of shut off
S0070	i be go to say what do they have what do they hear you know do they
S0180	well they
S0070	what go on in their head
S0180	most things of noise but they can if they need to sleep they can just shut it all out and sleep
S0183	well that's cos when they're in the womb they hear it already so they just get use to use to it
S0070	mm mm
S0180	nothing new it's just less muffle
S0183	yeah
S0180	what's funny though be like when you after he's feed
S0070	oh they do smell yeah
S0180	they smell buttery
S0070	well apparently we smell buttery anyway don't we
S0180	but it with the breast milk he do it's like smell it's like he's eat some you know anchor butter or something
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's just a lovely rick he doesn't smell so much now but well he's get a in his mouth that's why it's go to be very weird and corny no but it's true it's nice it's a lovely sort of buttery creamy
S0070	yeah
S0180	you could eat him
S0070	yeah so yeah let's get some of that unpasteurised milk when we're in oxford street next and you can sit at home and sniff it

S0070	well it might not be yeah yeah yeah
S0180	in other culture it's not
S0070	i mean i don't know it be all that i find interest be travel all over to the other side of the world and camp people sound
S0180	yeah yeah they do
S0070	must be a phonetic eh
S0180	be he really
S0070	the phonetics of camp be he
S0180	ultra camp be he
S0070	not too not sort of you know not annoyingly camp but you know just the way the sort of
S0180	how funny
S0070	yeah do you know what i mean there's a kind of there's a there's a voice isn't there sometimes
S0180	and the funny isn't it
S0070	it be yeah
S0180	faster than me i use to do a teacher's cup there use to be a teacher couple of teachers in the town i be teach in in china and i have a really strong new zealand accent and they'd say crash crash and jump
S0070	yeah and they actually write it now in some place i suppose cos they go and
S0180	no they don't
S0070	yeah when they're emphasise that
S0180	oh really the combination ah right
S0070	i think they realise that's its yeah so we say we sell fish and chip fish and chip
S0180	all all our sport teachers at school in london be itinerant australians and kiwis they come to london for a couple of years and then go go back in
S0070	they're mad on outside things aren't they
S0180	we have a lot of them
S0070	i suppose you would be i mean
S0180	we have a lot of
S0070	tipodean
S0180	antipodeans one of my main memory be the big at the end of the sport session okay now guy put the cup in bag
S0070	cat
S0180	put the cup put the cup in the bag now people
S0070	be south africans be they consider as antipodeans
S0180	i think they be because it's a similar accent do you think it have something to do with the um
S0070	i think it mean a place
S0180	i don't know i think it mean southern hemisphere but that it's interest that it's a similar accent isn't it the
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	be it to do with the magnetic magnetism of the southern pole
S0070	yeah
S0180	do that affect the voice
S0070	i don't know
S0180	because why be it the south african accent so similar and why be american not like that
S0070	you know do you think it's to do with the em eh
S0180	cos a lot of irish go to australia
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	so why isn't the australian accent similar to the american which it do sound very irish
S0070	mm
S0180	these these be the really interest things about linguistics aren't they
S0070	mm
S0180	and socially but but again you don't see that
S0070	no i've not hear any
S0180	and it's nice isn't it
S0070	well i suppose you get to be careful where you start do things like that because people sort of accuse you of all kind of
S0180	well
S0180	well be damn
S0070	i would do and be damn yes i be in london meet the other day fill in a form and it come across ethnicity
S0180	really
S0070	and it be weird because there be a box with nothing in it be it wasn't a tick box and i think how strange how would you describe yourself ethnically i would never do such a thing you know and i suppose there be certain people who would who would like want to say i be this i be that but i mean i would not know unless i'm give a tick box and force
S0180	what be your form for
S0070	i can't remember it be some to i be re enrol so
S0180	but it's weird be i can i have one for like government cos they're obsess with it aren't they in the uk
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah and it's not accurate
S0070	no it's not because you're either white british white irish or go to bloody hell sort of thing
S0180	and white white doesn't mean anything anyway
S0070	white doesn't mean anything you know and and and and and but so so what i mean be if you're force to tick a box you you kinda go okay you're white bloody british then but if you're ask what's your ethnicity i don't frigging know you know
S0180	i always other or put mix
S0070	well you see i be actually think should i just write in the box other
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know cos like oh yeah
S0180	i suppose
S0180	cos how would you describe
S0070	yeah bite of irish
S0180	you get an irish yeah
S0070	yeah yeah i mean what what what i always put mix other cos it's true yeah because how would you sort of describe british british asian british
S0180	british those darn box i don't know but it's not
S0070	but they're they're not
S0180	and i'm not anglo indian cos my mum's not completely indian
S0070	right right
S0180	her mum be not indian
S0070	well there you go she be bear in
S0180	yeah
S0180	but even ethnically adapt but her mum didn't her mum be and they well they're quite mix themselves
S0070	oh
S0180	i wouldn't i wouldn't even say she be ever indian
S0070	we should start write a well actually
S0180	okay if they wanna know
S0070	yeah yeah if you're really that interest which you're not
S0180	so what be interest be that when we be in brixton in em costa coffee which be very nice new costa coffee they've build under the railway arch and there be a mother there next to us who be promote these these nappies that you eh not disposable what's the opposite reuseable nappies and they're launch them at the cinema where they have a mother baby parent baby afternoon from twelve till two and they're gonna a free demonstration of how to use them it look really good but she hand us a leaflet if you're interest fill this in and we'll send you some more information and one of the line be ethnicity
S0070	yeah why
S0180	what's ethnicity be they gonna see ooh you know en anglo saxons sign up for our be they be only ethnicities interest in do the dish
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	i mean what will they do with that information it's totally irrelevant in that context so i mean you know the government's be obsess with it cos they put it on their form cos they want
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	okay they want to know if discrimination be happen or or they want to know if certain ethnicities live in a particular area
S0070	right
S0180	so it can provide i don't know language service but then even if you it doesn't tell you anything it doesn't tell you what language you speak
S0070	yeah
S0180	it doesn't tell you um you know it's really mislead but it's it's a legacy of the past really isn't it
S0070	it be really yeah it be
S0180	obsess be that
S0070	so that be a box tick thing or or a space leave
S0180	no it's a space leave cos you've get to bloody
S0070	that's what i mean it's impossible to do it really if you're if you're a live conscious be
S0180	yeah
S0070	if you're a philistine and you think ah i want to be black caribbean then it's you know easy to fill in isn't it and i want to be white british wey
S0180	yes
S0070	you know it's easy but if you actually think well hang on a minute
S0180	that's the thing isn't it
S0070	i'm not in the national front
S0180	that's the thing with research isn't it
S0070	yeah
S0180	you've get you if you be design a survey or questionnaire
S0070	quite would you do such a silly thing
S0180	didn't we have this discussion with where be it what be it open or close research question
S0183	open
S0180	yeah and then what would you do with that cos be that quantifiable data well i suppose not
S0070	well i suppose this be it it's not isn't it it's put a quantity in in box
S0180	it it it it yeah it would
S0180	so you could divide the box somehow quantify it can you
S0070	yeah but if they want to what would they say oh we get a lot of others
S0070	ooh we're all others i'm go to start tick other cos what would they say if you do tick
S0180	start a campaign everybody tick other
S0070	yeah yeah yeah what's that
S0180	none of the above
S0070	none of the above
S0180	oh yeah do you see that it's a great film isn't it i love that i love that film
S0070	it's brilliant yeah
S0180	and he be and john candy
S0070	yes
S0180	yes they work well together didn't they cos he be just such a nut case in that film which it
S0070	yeah brilliant
S0180	i love the bite when eh what be it they go they get into the hotel and the top floor's already take how much be they pay and the they find out oh we'll pay double it's a film about madness of the eighties isn't it
S0070	yeah and it's into no we don't
S0180	it's it's it's a remake of an original
S0070	oh be it
S0180	the original be make in the fifties or something
S0070	ah
S0180	and in the end he just make it and he have to spend thirty thousand in
S0180	and he buy that stamp and send it
S0183	yeah
S0180	em cos it's postmark be it not
S0070	oh yeah it's not worth anything
S0180	great isn't it
S0070	no it's a good film
S0180	yeah well well none of the above
S0070	well quite yeah because how would that how would that fit you know do you have to then explain if you tick other do you have to explain what other be
S0180	well that's the thing you don't sometimes so that render their survey a bite useless doesn't
S0070	but would you cos you know when you when you fill in a land card and it say nationality as state on your passport so that you don't start say you know
S0180	cos your nationality doesn't mean ethnicity
S0070	no exactly yeah
S0180	but some people take it to mean nationality
S0070	and i be think the other day about racism isn't that a bite of an outdated a term really cos we don't sort of talk about it race anymore do we we call it like ethniscicism
S0180	yeah
S0070	i don't like your ethnic group
S0180	yeah and ethnic group can mean you have the same ancestry but different religion cos they've start say you know if you're jewish ethnicity or if you're eh
S0070	yeah right or like an india northern indian
S0180	or muslim ethnicity
S0070	a muslim or
S0180	but that's not people get very confuse isn't it because muslim be not an ethnicity it's a religion
S0070	mm mm yeah yeah
S0180	but you'd be surprise if you ask people even university professors
S0070	right
S0180	some people take ethnicity not to mean genetic ancestry but they mean religion
S0070	yeah
S0180	belief
