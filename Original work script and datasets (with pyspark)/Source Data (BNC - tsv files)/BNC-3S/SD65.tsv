S0152	so why be they make all these cut it's just a game
S0012	it don't make sense do it
S0152	no
S0012	and yet they're advertise for more teachers
S0152	yeah and it's a lie what's on the on there
S0012	yeah
S0152	total lie
S0013	mm
S0152	about the amount of money you get
S0012	what do they put er
S0152	twenty five k i think it say
S0012	twenty five k to start off with
S0013	yeah
S0012	it's about fifteen ain't it
S0152	nineteen
S0012	nineteen be it
S0013	be it mm mm so things might be work out for you might they
S0012	well he could work them out
S0013	i miss the whole
S0012	yeah
S0152	i have my meet with the head i ask about the job that be come up could i apply for them
S0012	mm
S0152	and she say definitely you know course you can not say you'll get them but you know you can apply for them
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm she ask i i kind of put her in the picture of what i use to do and where i'd be and she say right she say i'm not look to lose experience staff she say erm and the bottom line be what i've hear about you so far be all good
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	so there's that and then i ask about the salary would if i get if i be fortunate enough to get an intervention teacher job if i didn't get a dt job
S0012	yeah
S0152	would my salary still stay the same and she go yes erm they've extend my contract as head of year seven till the thirty first of july cos it's suppose to finish next week but they've extend it to
S0012	so that's good ain't it
S0013	yeah right mm
S0152	and then i've be think about if i be to be able to go part time erm take early retirement i get a lump sum
S0013	mm
S0152	i could cut my mortgage by half
S0013	oh half wow
S0012	that's a lot ain't it
S0013	that would be good wouldn't it
S0152	i could cut my mortgage by half i could then work three days a week with my pension would work out to be the same as i'm earn now
S0013	wow oh
S0152	i wouldn't have kind of that would be it then and whatever i earnt that would be my money
S0012	yeah
S0152	because i've get things pay off
S0013	ah right
S0012	yeah
S0013	so you might not have to sell now
S0152	then i might not have to sell
S0013	would you leave it to sell or
S0152	no i'd take it off the market
S0013	you'd take it off mm
S0152	and then i'd do some job i'd take it off the market and then do some job
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos a couple of days a week not work you can do those job
S0012	you can yeah that's true yeah cos after after five days work you don't really wanna graft over the weekend do you
S0152	you know you know and then look at sell it in a couple of years time where i'd've pay some more off on the mortgage
S0012	yeah
S0152	go for a smaller property
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	so i haven't waste all that lump sum as such
S0012	mm
S0152	i could i could
S0012	would you rent or buy
S0152	erm in three years time or in two years time i'd buy
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh that's a much better idea
S0152	yeah
S0012	cos i could sell
S0013	yeah
S0152	er rent until i've find somewhere and if i move out the area
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	could do something like that
S0013	mm
S0012	well things be look up then
S0013	oh that's good
S0152	so it's just a think it's just a think i've i've get it in my in
S0013	yeah
S0012	well that's well you've get you've get every angle haven't you
S0013	mm it'd be nice to have that
S0152	yeah if i be to be fortunate to get the head of school job i be say to think i work out that i could just about do it from september by not take early retirement and all the other bits and piece
S0012	yeah
S0152	if i get the head of school job because that be a big salary increase
S0013	oh right
S0152	so
S0012	that'd be good won't it
S0013	mm
S0152	and then it'd just be a case of just juggle certain things and
S0012	mm yeah and not buy new cameras and stuff
S0012	or computers or
S0152	i haven't buy anything have i
S0012	no or go to rome or anything like that
S0152	i can't i haven't get a passport
S0012	what have it run out oh great
S0012	so have mine
S0152	i can't leave the country so i can't do anything like that
S0012	you could go to scotland
S0152	i could i do need to get my passport though cos just in case i wanna do something but
S0012	i still have to get one too
S0013	why
S0012	i don't know cos i don't or fly anyway so
S0013	wait till we decide something then you get it
S0012	yeah but it take so long to come through don't it
S0152	yeah well it's ten years so i'd get it just in case
S0012	yeah
S0152	so so that's what i'm that's what i'm think at the moment
S0013	mm
S0152	that's what i'm think
S0013	well that's some stress take off isn't it that you've get that to fall back on
S0152	nah well it be it be er it be some it be it's it's make me think a little bite so i'm not so
S0013	yeah
S0012	yes
S0152	but i don't i still get i've gotta make that decision i've gotta do the
S0013	mm
S0012	yes you have yeah you gotta take
S0013	what if they in the meantime someone say i want to buy your house
S0152	i'd sell it
S0013	mm
S0152	i'd sell it
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah and carry on as you be
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well the buy season be now come up again so
S0152	i'd sell it i'd sell it
S0013	mm
S0012	might've be only three hundred thousand weren't it

S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	quite a bite
S0013	yeah

S0152	he'd come to do his roadshow
S0152	and he start off it's tough time tough time ahead it's start here at our place erm with change to the structure but it's gonna happen in all the academies that we've get you're fortunate that your intake be still on the rise cos you know it's it's stabilise where it be a hundred and seventy five
S0012	yeah
S0152	two hundred and eighty students come in can't take any more than that really
S0012	no
S0152	you know we're the academy's build for er a hundred and eleven they're predict in ten years' time there'll be a erm thirteen hundred intake well the academy ain't build for
S0012	never build for that sort of intake
S0013	mm
S0152	for that type of thing but as an organisation he put it we can't expand and we can't expand because of you that's what he say
S0012	oh
S0152	we can't expand because you be hold us back because your because your floor target don't meet national standards so the government won't let us extend our
S0012	do you know that but in
S0013	mm
S0012	in just about every every place you get an idiot like that come in don't you how much do they get pay

S0012	yeah
S0152	add to
S0012	yeah
S0152	right and you're think yeah okay and he and he come back to it a a couple of time the reason we can't extend our academy chain be because you're not meet the floor because you're not meet the standards

S0013	mm
S0152	because you can balance your book or whatever
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it it doesn't work like that
S0012	no
S0152	because what happen be it cost you more at the end of the day because you employ people to come in because those people go off on stress
S0012	yeah
S0152	the youngsters go because they don't know how to deal with it
S0012	no
S0013	yeah

S0152	mm i if i'm notice that
S0013	yeah
S0152	pattern and i don't have that job to do any more
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know cos that's one of the job that i use to do be all the other bits and piece
S0012	yeah
S0152	you look down it and you think mm yeah okay
S0012	ah
S0013	mm mm
S0012	there's too many people up there tell everybody else what to do and they're do nothing about it there there's too many people what do they call it er too too many chiefs and not enough ain't it
S0013	mm
S0152	so you kind of think oh well but he i he just he just you know and i er the the only message that i take from that meet be you're stop us
S0012	yeah
S0152	expand
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know and what i book i book something in the diary back in january time for the seventeenth of april i get an email yesterday that we need to move it

S0152	why do we need to move it because we've get mock exams that week in that room so can we put it in the atrium
S0012	oh
S0152	i've book it well in advance
S0012	yes
S0152	we've get an outside speaker come in and we're gonna put them in the
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's bad ain't it
S0013	mm
S0012	so they can override everything you do anyway
S0152	you know and you think well okay why why organise something
S0012	why organise anything yeah
S0152	you know
S0013	yeah
S0152	i've gotta organise something for the twenty second of april i've now get the i provisionally book the room fortunately it's the week after but i'm think to myself i have to get permission for that
S0012	mm yeah
S0152	so
S0013	mm
S0012	that's that's er the right hand not let the leave hand know what they're do
S0152	yeah and when you and when you do do everything by the book that you're suppose to do it get override
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you think well hold on you decide to put another mock exam in in a couple of weeks time
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know we don't need mock exams now what we need be kid in the room with us go through the stuff
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	not take a a two hour mock exam and and er cos that put more pressure on cos you've then gotta mark it all
S0012	of course you have yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	you know we have to do we have to do last week there be a deadline to put some grade in put them all in this week we have to put other grade in for other subject
S0012	oh right
S0152	but then we find the grade that we'd put in last week they'd all be delete because not every department have do it and it's like duplicate your work
S0012	yeah barmy barmy
S0013	mm
S0012	why do they do it though why who be these chiefs that keep change stuff
S0152	oh it's the the government be play a good one at the moment because they're say we're not cut the fund to education we're keep the fund to education the same so everyone things that's good
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah you'd think it be good look at it on the tv
S0012	yeah yeah

S0152	right national insurance have go up
S0012	yeah
S0152	pension contributions have go up
S0012	have they oh yeah cos of the budget i didn't take any notice of it

S0012	yeah
S0152	money into your pension and all of this business
S0012	yeah yeah yeah
S0152	and that so if you get more it get dilute more doesn't it
S0012	well of course it do yeah yeah yeah
S0152	you know
S0012	that's a bite stupid it well i mean when when you use information like that that can always be manipulate can't it
S0152	yeah
S0012	facts and figure be so manipulate
S0152	well they can manipulate it how they want to
S0012	however they want to do it they can manipulate it

S0012	and people believe it that's the trouble they i mean whatever they hear or or or read in they believe it
S0152	yeah
S0012	if if the prime minister say something oh yeah that's great but he say it in such a a round about way that there's load of interpretations you can put on it
S0152	yeah you know depend on which newspaper you'll read will depend on what it mean
S0012	yeah yeah that's true yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	you know we know that from you know
S0012	yeah
S0152	and newspapers change their allegiances
S0012	they do don't they
S0013	mm yeah
S0152	so
S0012	be it the sun that use to be really tory weren't it at one time
S0152	yeah at one point it be really tory
S0012	that be wasn't it
S0152	daily mail be really tory
S0012	that that's really tory what's the telegraph that's a bite
S0152	that that's a bite leave wing isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0152	the telegraph
S0012	it be the daily mirror that use to be
S0152	that use to be labour
S0012	labour through and through that use to have a slogan on the top forward with the people
S0152	yeah
S0012	that be their slogan
S0013	mm
S0012	be that still about that paper the daily mirror
S0152	yeah the daily mirror's still about
S0012	be it
S0013	mm mm
S0152	thing i mean i i don't know whether you've see miliband this week miliband no last weekend i think it be he be quite passionate about what he be actually say
S0013	mm
S0152	but then then people will turn
S0013	they turn it round yeah
S0152	turn his situation around
S0012	yeah
S0152	from the point of view well
S0013	mm
S0152	you've get a house that you've get a nanny and all the other bits and piece
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	well
S0012	yeah
S0152	he he believe in it for everybody else he's work
S0012	yeah
S0152	and he's employ people
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0152	so dunno it could be an interest election in a month's time
S0013	mm
S0012	well it will be but when when they er like like the budget they do stuff where they er take away from pete to give to paul and all that sort of business but when it when it finish up the budget be the budget and that's it
S0013	mm
S0012	and then you get the opposition come on and they say they would do it different now when the opposition be not the opposition and they do the budget then that opposition say we would do it different
S0152	yeah
S0012	they cannot agree one little item
S0152	yeah
S0012	and they make everybody look bad
S0152	yeah the thing at the moment be this thirty billion that they're gonna cut from the health budget that that they're say
S0012	yeah billion

S0013	it go somewhere else doesn't it
S0012	somewhere else

S0013	mm
S0152	because if you if you like if you're gonna cut it you don't have to spend thirty billion do you
S0013	oh i see
S0012	no that's true no
S0013	yeah
S0012	but they get thirty billion that they could spend on something else
S0013	save
S0152	yeah but well they take that off the deficit then don't they
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	so if your deficit be whatever it be
S0012	yeah they gotta get the deficit down
S0013	mm

S0152	yeah yeah
S0012	they use to have the import export balance didn't they
S0152	yeah yeah
S0152	i mean at the moment the stock exchange be quite high at the moment it's break record it's the highest it's ever be
S0012	be it yeah
S0152	but i think the inflation this month will go up cos petrol's go back up
S0012	yeah petrol's go up again ain't it yeah
S0152	cos it be one 0 four a litre
S0012	yeah
S0152	that's the cheapest that i put in or one 0 five cos that be
S0012	yeah
S0152	point nine nine isn't it
S0012	point nine ain't it yeah
S0152	it's now one eleven
S0012	be it yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	so it's and but nobody say nobody say well hold hold on how come that's go
S0012	yeah
S0152	back up
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	we hadn't hear about that have we
S0012	no
S0013	know it have come down but

S0013	mm
S0152	it be one 0 it be one 0 four
S0012	do they put extra on the on the petrol
S0152	no
S0012	cos
S0152	no
S0012	they stop it for yonks didn't they
S0152	they still they still keep it they still keep it
S0012	yeah
S0152	the duty the thing be they've take a penny off tax on beer and spirit and you're think
S0012	well that's nothing be it you know compare with what people drink i mean they're not gonna sit people who be drink don't save anything do they what's a penny
S0013	mm
S0012	that might work out to quite a few million in in the
S0152	across the whole
S0013	yeah but they could take off five pence and no one'd make any difference really
S0152	no
S0013	so
S0012	or they could put it on and earn more money
S0152	yeah
S0013	but that's what i that's what i mean sorry
S0012	yeah
S0152	they could put it on
S0152	and it'd be worth more
S0012	well i mean
S0152	but yeah you know why why's he why's he do that he's do that because he want to get if the work class think oh we've save money on our beer or whatever
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and our and our cider and our spirit
S0012	yeah yeah that use to be that use to be a if they put anything on cigarettes and spirit or alcohol it be not a work class budget
S0152	no
S0012	as though the work class be smoke and drink like hell
S0013	mm
S0152	more drink be probably do with the
S0012	with the posh
S0152	with the posh yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	i be i i mean i watch we watch gogglebox and whatever and that posh couple

S0152	you know they're always drink
S0012	yeah they've get their wine haven't they yeah
S0152	they've get their wine
S0013	yeah
S0152	they're always try something different
S0012	yeah
S0152	and they say something the other day and i just think you're take the mickey out of somebody be posh et cetera you be just as posh as them if not more so
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	with what you you do
S0012	yeah yeah they be ain't they
S0152	so
S0012	yeah
S0012	no that's really strange there's so so much paradox and in the in the government's way of think
S0152	yeah it's just
S0012	that's just ridiculous er but i be say to who be i talk to just the other day er it's not so much the government that be it's the civil servants that be run the government they never change
S0152	always the same
S0012	they never change that's you remember that yes minister
S0013	mm
S0012	and maggie thatcher say that be
S0152	it be quite close
S0012	just how it be
S0152	yeah
S0012	where you go in and the the minister say oh we're go to do this and the oh no you can't do that minister you cannot do that well what you have to do be in this sort of way and
S0152	yeah
S0012	and they manipulate the they manipulate the mps
S0152	it's it's funny because they manipulate it for each party
S0012	they do yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	and you're think well where be the balance
S0013	yeah
S0012	there's no balance there be there
S0152	there's no balance there if you you know you're gonna make one party look good when they're in and one party look bad when they're in because of what you
S0012	yeah
S0152	you do
S0012	because of the civil servants i mean the civil servants never change that's really weird that be you know
S0013	yeah
S0152	you don't have you don't have a a a labour set of civil servants
S0012	no you don't
S0152	so you don't say oh change of election all these be come out now and then all
S0012	no they're all get the
S0152	these come out and this group go in type thing
S0012	and we're this yeah

S0152	yeah
S0152	alright there be some mps who will who'll try and manipulate it as well but
S0012	well there be but they i mean
S0152	you know i can't see the like of osborne and ed ball sit down with a calculator say right we're gonna spend this amount on this and that amount on that

S0013	mm
S0152	yeah
S0012	of of civil servants aren't they
S0152	yeah they've all get their their little quangos which they've try to cut and whatever
