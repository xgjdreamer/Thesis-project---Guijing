S0486	that there be rook pull off all the straw off thatch roof
S0523	oh dear
S0486	and erm yeah er come over here and we can all talk together in fact
S0523	oh yeah
S0486	erm you carry on talk about that in there and i'll make coffee
S0489	yes i think it's some something to do with the weather and maybe the the bug that they're look for in the grass and have proliferate through the warm weather through the winter
S0523	yeah
S0489	perhaps you know
S0523	yeah
S0489	unfair really
S0523	i know so few certainly the garden's look very nice actually isn't it you know for this this for this time of year
S0489	we've we've we've get it reasonably stable now i think that's the thing
S0523	yeah
S0489	cos you've finish the fence i see all the fence here
S0523	oh yes yeah yeah
S0489	just paint the horizontals yet
S0523	yeah
S0489	but er and we've put a path down this side of the fence
S0523	right
S0489	so you can get into the far side of the border without too much difficulty that make it a bite different
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah excellent yeah
S0489	so yeah it's it's reach a fairly stable situation i think
S0523	the grass look pretty good as well doesn't it i mean apart from there where the crow's do that
S0489	yes we have a yeah
S0486	yeah that's just so unfortunate
S0523	yeah
S0486	because we have a lot of moss and erm well between myself and we get rid of it because i sprinkle a lot of this stuff on and i make some nasty black patch in the grass
S0523	mm mm
S0486	and ruin the lawn however
S0523	mm mm
S0486	alan titchmarsh say that he'd do the same thing and he's never go to use that product again
S0523	oh yeah oh really
S0486	er yeah that i hear that subsequently
S0523	oh right
S0486	erm so erm
S0523	and what so what do do you do
S0486	erm it be erm er er er you sprinkle it on it be a dry mix that you have to sprinkle on to the erm to the er moss
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	and then i think it would just seep into the grind and the moss would die
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	instead of that it burn the moss and make it black
S0523	yes yes
S0486	so you have ghastly black patch all over the lawn
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	which you well obviously didn't really want so erm now i've er er now erm we get rid of those last year so that go the lawn grow back it look wonderful and then

S0486	i'm a whole stone underweight
S0523	oh wow

S0523	yeah
S0486	but erm yeah i mean i'm not eat any sugar
S0523	yeah
S0486	i'm not eat erm any yeast erm all these things erm upset me you see
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0486	so why have them
S0523	well yeah exactly yeah
S0486	and erm i don't want them anymore
S0523	no no no no
S0486	i have i i have be have eat a hundred percent chocolate from peru and it's get no sugar in it at all and it's the most bitter thing you've ever taste but i've actually get to like it out of desperation just to have that taste of chocolate you know
S0523	yeah yeah what about the erm the very high chocolate content you get in sainsbury's they're they're only like they're kind of dark chocolate
S0486	yeah yeah
S0523	i think they're seventy or eighty percent chocolate
S0486	and and the rest be sugar
S0523	be it oh be it oh i see
S0486	yeah so now a hundred percent it's get to be a hundred percent sometimes if i'm out and i'm really really desperate i do buy eighty five percent
S0523	ah mm
S0486	so you can get and do you know where you can get them
S0523	yeah
S0486	you can get it in erm it's er fairtrade and you can get it in oxfam
S0523	oh right
S0486	mm
S0523	okay
S0486	mm and so erm i i do see my allergy consultant last week and she say that i could give myself a treat sometimes and have the seventy five percent
S0523	mm
S0486	you know but the trouble be you start to want to chocolate the the sugar again
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	if you don't have the sugar i go to the chocolate hotel of chocolate or whatever they call it
S0523	mm
S0486	and i buy it in there and you can get three bar of a hundred percent peru chocolate for erm i think it's nine pound
S0523	really yeah yeah
S0486	and you you have to buy them in threes to get a discount
S0523	yeah yeah yeah
S0486	and they all say to me how on earth do you eat it and i say well the first time the first time i have it i be out shop and i think i could fancy a bite of chocolate and i just buy it and i'd never have it before
S0523	yeah
S0486	so i break off quite a large piece i put it in my mouth and i be walk round the supermarket i wonder where i could spit it out because it be so bitter
S0523	yeah so yeah
S0486	erm and er just dreadful and no sugar and you but if you have little bits of it
S0523	yeah
S0486	you get the taste of the chocolate and then you're look for the sugar all the time in the chocolate and it's never gonna come you know it's not there but as soon as i start eat something that's that's
S0523	the chocolate it's it's get lot of be it it get the endorphins go
S0486	yeah yeah it's it it's a brilliant
S0523	yeah
S0486	in fact i've get a a a leaflet about it that erm she give me i i'll just keep talk erm she give me and i'll bring it i'll bring it to you
S0523	mm have you find something
S0489	well i think there's several possibilities there but
S0523	mm
S0489	it's get the hang of the websites
S0523	mm
S0489	they all they all seem to have their bloom quirk don't they
S0486	the properties of chocolate this be give to me by the allergy clinic cos they be say how good chocolate be for you
S0523	mm mm
S0486	it say erm dark chocolate be load with nutrients that can positively affect your health make from the seed of the cocoa tree it's one of the best source of antioxidants in the planet study show that dark chocolate not the sugar crap excuse me can improve health and lower the risk of heart disease that's what he put i didn't say that dark chocolate be very nutritious if you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content then it's actually quite nutritious it contain a decent amount of soluble fibre and be load with minerals a hundred gram bar of dark chocolate with seventy to eighty five percent cocoa
S0523	mm mm mm
S0486	contain eleven grams of fibre sixty seven of the recommend dose of iron sixty seven percent fifty eight percent of the recommend daily dose of magnesium eighty nine percent of the recommend daily dose of copper ninety eight percent of the recommend daily dose of of manganese it also have plenty of potassium phosphorous zinc and selenium
S0523	mm
S0486	well that's good isn't it
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0486	erm
S0523	but when when you think about it it's like a plant like like a plant like a you know vegetable
S0486	well exactly
S0523	it all have a lot of er
S0486	pure yeah
S0523	nutrients and things
S0489	plant extract sort of thing mm
S0523	and it's only the things that you know man make that be add
S0486	exactly
S0523	i i i presume
S0486	yes it be
S0489	mm
S0523	that actually be the things that you that you don't really want to have
S0486	well it's the add fat any chemicals in refine it in production plus all the sugar
S0523	mm mm yeah
S0486	because people in order to you know in order to eat that chocolate you've get to really need to eat it i mean you wouldn't eat it
S0523	mm mm
S0486	if you be of low er reserve of low spirit
S0523	mm
S0486	because it's so bitter
S0523	mm
S0486	and of course hundred grams three point five ounces be a fairly large amount and not something you should be consume daily all these nutrients also come with six hundred calories and a moderate amount of sugar
S0523	oh
S0486	if you're have it seventy to eight five percent
S0523	oh right okay
S0486	for this reason dark chocolate be best consume in moderation i mean it be full of fat er cocoa fat
S0523	mm mm
S0486	the fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate be excellent the fat be mostly saturate and mono i can't say that monosaturated with a small amount of polyunsaturates it also contain stimulants like caffeine and theobromine but be unlikely to keep you awake at night as the amount of caffeine be very small compare to coffee
S0489	mm
S0486	bottom line quality dark chocolate be rich in fibre iron magnesium copper manganese and a few other minerals well it can't be bad can it
S0523	no that's very good
S0486	there's two page of it three page of it i won't go into it in great detail
S0523	mm mm
S0486	i mean it well it be it it can improve several important risk factor for heart disease in a control trial cocoa powder be find to be significantly decrease oxidise ldl cholesterol in men it also increase hdl and and lower ldl in men with elevate cholesterol
S0523	mm
S0486	erm and it improve blood flow and lower blood pressure and of course it's an antioxidant
S0523	mm
S0486	erm what else have she put in here it may improve brain function
S0523	be that
S0489	do it do it make the tea as well
S0486	a take home message there be considerable evidence that cocoa can provide powerful health benefit be especially protective against cardiovascular disease but of course this doesn't mean that you should go out and consume lot of chocolate every day it be still load with calories and easy to over eat on maybe have a square or two after dinner and try and really savour them be aware that a lot of chocolate on the market be crap excuse me again i didn't write this you need to choose quality stuff organic dark chocolate with seventy percent or higher cocoa content dark chocolates often contain some sugar but the amount be usually small and the darker the chocolate the less sugar it will contain there be of course other benefit to chocolate that i have not mention such as the awesome taste
S0486	i i go i go to the allergy clinic for a check up this week
S0523	mm mm mm
S0486	and to change some of my pills and erm and she give me that but she i've be have a lot of dental problems and it's really amaze she also give me a bottle of erm of that which be erm any any of the dental chemicals that they've use while fill the tooth or root canal fill or anything
S0523	mm mm mm
S0486	this be like an antidote
S0523	mm
S0486	it's a homeopathic antidote
S0523	mm
S0486	so i show it i've be to the dentist this morning i show it to my dentist this morning she say keep take it she say
S0486	she's great like that
S0523	mm mm
S0486	i felt that she might have say gosh i might stock some of that for my patients

S0486	but anyway i only have it because at the allergy clinic have have such trouble with her dentist in fact she have to change
S0523	mm
S0486	and she be in such pain she have three root canal fill
S0523	mm
S0486	three nerve die in her teeth within i don't know three or four weeks so she have three root canal fill one after the other
S0523	mm oh how old be she
S0486	about my age she's about my age erm she she erm be in a terrible state
S0523	mm mm
S0486	and so she source this and erm she she say she she think it help it certainly help me with my nerve pain the last few days i'm sure of it so i'm really please with that
S0523	mm mm mm mm
S0486	she say to me i tell her you see what happen be she be fill this tooth and she stick a needle into the tooth with erm the hydrogen peroxide that they use to kill the nerve
S0523	mm
S0486	unfortunately unbeknown to the dentist there be a hole at the end of the tooth
S0523	oh
S0486	and the hydrogen peroxide go through the tooth and right into the hard palette
S0523	oh
S0486	and so it essentially it burn the inside of my hard palette
S0523	oh dear
S0486	and the pain be dreadful i be in the chair and i be anaesthetise and yet everything be go alright as far as it can go alright
S0523	mm mm

S0523	mm
S0486	so the the fluid instead of go in in you know just to the end of the tooth and burn off all the bacteria and the old dead nerve and all that sort of thing it shoot straight up into the hard palette and i've have pain on that hard palette ever since and it's start to affect this tooth
S0523	oh god mm well they they can't see these things because i have
