S0086	be it
S0060	it wasn't it wasn't
S0171	yeah i didn't i wasn't all that keen on it actually
S0060	but i don't know whether it's from a book but if it be i imagine the actual the story in the book would be a lot lot better the they didn't really they could have you know you could tell there be probably a lot more toe the story in different bits and they just sort of move on cos the the story they're tell there wasn't a great deal to it
S0086	really it just sort of rely on the on how it look
S0060	yeah but no
S0086	but avatar be like that though they spend so much money on the effect that they just sort of forget the story line i mean unobtainium
S0060	yeah
S0086	how long do it take them to think that up two second it be essentially just fern gulley wasn't it the twenty first century i mean i like fern gulley but you know i don't think it's grind break particularly but quite entertain i think john carter didn't it look a lot like star war that sort of desert scene
S0060	they've they've try to sell to on say it's the the star war for the next generation but it's definitely not that
S0086	it's not
S0060	it's not it hasn't get the big sort of galaxies scope it's it's basically well they kind of there's there's a lot of in the first one be obviously where it sort of it if nothing else it's sort of set a scene for a bigger story to come sort of thing em but even then it's not go to be anything yeah no
S0086	anything on the same scale
S0060	no
S0086	well i mean to go and see the first star war in 3d but i didn't get around to it it would have be really good on the big screen
S0060	i go when eh when they bring out what be it the second one
S0086	the second new one
S0060	yeah there be a you could go and watch the five back to back through the night kind of thing
S0086	oh god
S0060	it be it be when i be at college i think so we go and watch that through the night and it be like oh
S0086	yeah i think they do that just recently with harry potter
S0060	do they oh my god
S0086	they do yeah my friend go to watch all five and one saturday night they do like one to three and then they do four to six
S0060	yeah yeah
S0086	and then seven's in two bits isn't it so yeah that be a bite epic cos they just get longer and longer
S0060	yeah cos i remember go to see the the eh exorcist at midnight cos it when it have come back after have be ban
S0086	oh yeah yeah
S0060	it be i think that be my first year at eh at uni we all troop off down to the cinema at whatever in the morning or or yeah it be the last show sort of thing to watch the exorcist and it be like comic it really be
S0086	it hasn't age well have it
S0060	no no i mean it be that you know this film have be ban it have to come back we all troop down there to watch it i don't i don't think i'd ever see it before but i mean literally we be just in stitch laugh throughout the thing it be
S0086	yeah it's not scary
S0060	no
S0086	it's funny that these things get ban but then i think i don't know whether it's because i hate mask but texas chainsaw massacre but i think it's still really scary
S0060	yeah you're right there's a new one come out which be very much that sort of thing smiley it's call
S0086	thank love smiley
S0060	yeah
S0086	be it mask
S0060	yeah its em very much of the sort of scream texas chainsaw massacre kind of thing it's all about and a bite like em i suppose it and those kind of ones but it's of a his face be like
S0171	i'm go to start on the hard stuff
S0086	oh nice
S0060	yeah as though he he's get no face and his eye and his mouth be like cut into it with a knife or something so it's sort of a a sort of bloody cut on his face but it's just no face he's get the shape of a face but no feature apart from these knife cut to make his eye and his mouth
S0086	jesus
S0060	and it look one of your film that do smiley
S0086	yeah you like a gruesome horror don't you
S0171	i do but i've never hear of smiley
S0060	yeah well it's a new one i've see it advertise but eh that's a perfect i mean eh one of the little computer game we play minecraft there's load of youtube videos of people play it cos they build load of stuff and it's you know all sort of creative stuff and because you do that the load cos they've get load of subscribers and they've get load of videos up they're part of youtube so they get pay for it because they put advert so there's always this you know you get five second before you can get to the video you want and so often it's an advert for a film and you ooh start and then you start look at that and eh
S0086	oh that's clever
S0060	but eh but yeah that be one of the ones but there's some good ones
S0086	smiley
S0060	that one em i ask you to look at prometheus
S0171	mm
S0060	that look like that's go to be really good
S0086	mm
S0060	ridley scott em very alien i think although i i don't know for definite but it look like it's ask around the alien space craft or the alien that have the spacecraft where they find the alien first of all
S0086	oh okay
S0060	do you remember the one that be kind of look like an elephant kind of you probably can't remember
S0086	oh right no
S0060	they find the massive there's a huge big alien in the spaceship where they find the alien egg in the very first film
S0171	in the very first film what be the very first film
S0060	alien
S0171	alien oh that right okay
S0086	the one where john hurt's on the bed and the alien come out of his chest
S0060	yeah where he eh on the breakfast table isn't it yeah
S0086	that's my mum watch that when she be eight and a half months pregnant with me i be her first bear she watch that and she be like holy cow oh my god oh my god i've get a life come out of me in a matter of weeks
S0060	well it look it's go back to that sort of dark sort of thing with that so it's really cool that should be good
S0086	mm that's interest he's make yeah sort of hit and miss film for me some of them be really good and some be just a bite cheesy
S0060	he's make his name of the back of that hasn't he
S0086	yeah i like gladiator
S0060	yeah that's a good one but there be talk of a new gladiator wasn't there but i've never i've not see there's a couple of
S0171	be you not think of the series
S0060	no no no no there be talk of gladiator two effectively but i never saw anything more of it cos it you know any film that's really successful like that they're go to make a sequel aren't they like well no i don't know cos it wasn't a successful film like wrath of the titans after clash of the titans
S0171	yeah
S0060	cos you want to go and see that don't you
S0171	i do want to go and see that yes
S0060	i reckon it's just go to be pure cheese
S0171	yes
S0086	he be a bite of a hottie
S0060	well actually it's all sell on him be a good look guy
S0086	mm
S0171	the other one it's em obviously come out very well be eh be it taylor lautner from the twilight series
S0086	oh yeah he's do a lot of film on the back of that though hasn't he
S0060	yeah it
S0171	mm load
S0060	that's what i be say yesterday cos what be the film
S0171	bellamy
S0060	yeah
S0171	he's in bellamy
S0060	that's robert pattinson isn't it
S0171	oh be it
S0086	yeah
S0060	yeah you're think of the other one
S0171	oh yeah i'm think yeah i'm think yeah be think wasn't i rather than
S0060	load of stuff but i don't i don't think the stuff at the cinema or the film that have come out in the last sort of while have be all that good
S0086	no i haven't be to see any blockbusters for a while have a very cultural even with my mum on thursday we go to the ballet
S0060	oh
S0171	mm
S0086	madame yeah well she say i want to go to the ballet therefore you have to get me ticket and you must come and
S0171	you have no choice
S0086	and birthday girl prerogative you just have to do it but actually it be really good it be you know the arts picture house they televise you know play or ballet and the show it to you so rather than spend forty quid one the ballet which you probably won't enjoy you spend ten pound and you get to drink during it so that's fine
S0060	oh that's good
S0086	so we do that but actually i be really surprise i really enjoy it i don't know whether it's just because it be romeo and juliet so i know the story i didn't have to try and work out what the hell be go on
S0060	yeah
S0171	yeah
S0086	em so you know and it be very it be really beautiful by the end everyone be like mm and they finish dance and then the curtain come down and the two lead come out and they be cling on to each other cos it have be such an emotional experience and it be really definitely you but i haven't do any cultural things for age so it be nice actually
S0060	oh right i can always remember when i be do the do my gcses and that do english literature and we use to go down to the eh to the theatre and to opera supposedly to broaden our eh
S0086	expand your mind
S0060	horizons it be very much like that with opera mostly italian opera as well where you have if you didn't know what the bloom thing be about in the first place you didn't know what be go on
S0086	yeah you're screw and it last for four hours
S0060	yeah exactly i can remember go we go all the way over the stratford to the to the theatre there and what be it we watch it be tame of the shrew or something like that but the bloom to get all the way over there for the for the show and bloom the drive back it bloom it be bloom even it be so late by the time we get back i be like bloody hell we're not go to do this regularly
S0086	do you enjoy it
S0060	mm yeah it be very good but he
S0086	yeah there's something about see live theatre actually isn't there
S0060	yeah cos that be ah who be do it
S0086	rsc maybe if it be stratford
S0060	no i'm try to think who be in it i think it be em what's her name do the darling bud of may
S0171	i haven't get a clue
S0060	what's her name be in entrapment
S0171	oh catherine zeta jones
S0060	catherine zeta jones i think it be her i think she be the shrew i think
S0086	mm that's interest i would never think of her as a stage actress
S0060	i'm pretty sure it be her
S0171	i suppose you've get to start somewhere
S0060	it be a long time ago though so my memory may have totally fail me
S0171	it must have be before it must have be before her act career then
S0060	no
S0086	the thing be i think it take a lot more to do stage doesn't it cos you've only get one chance to do it whereas if you're use to do a lot of tv then eh
S0060	well yeah everything that's on the telly and you know cinema and that it's all about you know it's all perfect light perfect sound edit dub you know tweak to be perfect
S0086	yeah you can do as many take as you need to
S0060	whereas eh but eh
S0086	yeah
S0060	there be the sort of stage actors be usually a lot lot better they can put across stuff a lot better
S0086	so you've be work saturdays then my love yeah busy
S0171	yeah yeah we've em historical record have just go through the roof
S0060	be grumble every single time but when she get her wag through she be like ooh

S0171	so end up stay at home with
S0060	and do like cos she work at she do quite sort of shift work and all this kind of stuff so it's quite a lot of effort for them plus i don't know really whether either of them well i suppose be but isn't really or wasn't i think he's change a lot wasn't really kind of a reliable family man shall we say
S0086	right
S0060	he have change for the better over the years but i mean their relationship now i've know them two now
S0171	it's be volatile for quite some time
S0060	for for years cos i use to work with well i still do but he now work in a different bite to me but eh we use to rent a flat well not a flat a house together out in and that be when and first meet and eh i use to be the bloom agony aunt for both of them cos they use to row and they would go from everything be brilliant and you know to the total everything's off we're never go to speak to each other again we want to kill each other in a course of a couple of days
S0086	mm it's quite extreme
S0060	and yeah but eh but no they i mean they're lovely but eh they be a bite eh up and down aren't they
S0086	some relationships be like that and it just it take one of you to sort of say actually be this can be this sustainable like can you carry on with this
S0060	well they they have get to the point
S0171	they have do that hadn't they
S0060	where they'd sort of say look this isn't go to work
S0171	yeah
S0060	and eh they sort of totally split up but they end up get back together as i mean it's work out i mean that be it must be they must have be together six or seven years now it must be on on and off for the first few years but they must have be that long now i mean they buy the house together a year and a bite ago yeah
S0086	mm so the buy a house and have a baby all about the same time that's quite stressful
S0060	yeah
S0171	yeah
S0060	and then get marry
S0171	and then get marry
S0060	yeah they move in and they have to be out of the place they be in on new year's day or something like that or christmas day one or the other i can't remember what it be now and it be the the house where i use to live with with and eh i be say why don't you bloom speak to the landlady and say look can we have a few extra days sort of thing i be like she's not get anyone move in on bloom new year's new year's day or whatever but they end up they move everything on new year's eve and new year's day didn't they so i mean i give them a hand with a few bits and piece but a lovely place they've get it's out near em out through and out the other side of the village be well it's kind of there's like three house isn't there that's about it but em
S0171	that have to be careful when they first move in it wasn't all that liveable be it
S0060	no it be
S0171	paddy have to do a lot of work on it
S0060	it'd be em i suppose it's like a bungalow isn't it really a sort of a
S0171	yeah
S0060	and it have sort of be they'd obviously the original owners have sort of do one room and then probably leave and then another occupant have do another room and so it be nothing match
S0086	oh god
S0060	you know it be all the doors be different different size different colour different style all the room be a bite higgledy piggledy weren't they and everything none of this there be sort of bits of skirt board be there or not there and all sort of and eh they spend the first cor must be six months sort of work on the house but thankfully both of them be very practical so although she work at 's she actually do em like restoration and em i don't know why she doesn't do it still now cos she make a fortune out of it but she do like restoration murals and sort of
S0086	wow
S0171	she use to go to em various different countries didn't she she would be hire by people
S0060	to go
S0171	that own like these massive villas
S0060	she do a lot of work in eh
S0171	and she'd do mural and paint and so on
S0086	yeah well especially
S0060	it be dubai she get fly out to dubai
S0086	oh god
S0060	to do murals in this you know mansion house kind of thing and eh she do a load of restoration work and stuff doesn't she but i don't think she do much of it any more to be honest but she do until a few years back but eh there's a few a few of the restaurants in town actually where eh the murals she's do them eh the one
S0171	yeah the one that i've see be em
S0060	the one on square isn't it sorry okay disaster
S0171	isn't it brilliant how you try and have a conversation and join in on the conversation and you think of something to say and then he's just de de de
S0060	sorry sorry
S0171	em yeah you know where the square be there's a i can't even remember what it's call now but there's a an italian place
S0060	it's underground
S0171	under no it's not underground no yeah the mural be it's downstairs in the basement
S0060	yeah it's get a basement be the part of the restaurant's downstairs
S0086	oh yeah yeah
S0171	you know where the you know where the disney store be when you're come out there
S0086	yeah yeah oh i know where it be not la be it
S0171	it's right on the end on the corner
S0086	yeah i know where you mean yeah
S0171	they usually have all the canopy out and canopy you know get the table
S0060	isn't it further on than that
S0171	no
S0060	no okay but anyway
S0171	although the disney store have close down now but
S0060	yeah but it's there cos we go there for his birthday didn't we
S0171	yeah no her birthday
S0060	be it her birthday i think it be his
S0171	oh no no it be 's no it be 's
S0086	so she paint murals
S0060	yeah
S0086	oh wow
S0060	she draw all of the cos it be em it be a beach scene or something wasn't it or
S0171	something like that it wasn't in a very big room either so i don't really know what they be go to do with it but
S0060	it's sort of the private function room with a bar wasn't it a sort of little private area but it be right across the wall all that sort of side it be nice but she's good at that kind of stuff so she do all the sort of decorate and all the sort of file and fix and stuff and i mean go through and sort of rip out all the doors and i think redo all the doors and do all the the sort of they put a wood floor throughout
S0086	wow they must have spend quite a lot of money
S0060	and all this sort of stuff eh they get it i think they get a decent mortgage and the price of the house be quite low cos it obviously need a lot of work so they do that but it's get a huge garage it's like em it must be four or five car garage
S0086	mm
S0060	that they basically use it as a sort of storage base
S0171	yeah cos they've get eh they've get a couple of cars haven't they but they park them out the front
S0060	yeah they've get a nice sort of long drive that lead to it
S0171	well you can always convert them you know over time
S0060	yeah well i think originally that's what it be build for be you know it be a tiny little well it's not tiny it's quite big bungalow really isn't it
S0171	it be yea
S0060	but it's a bungalow and then there be the bigger sort of garage and it be kind of you could see that they be think we'll live there and build a garage and then that will become the hone sort of thing but i think they never get permission to do it cos you have to get
S0171	plan permission
S0060	plan permission to convert it don't you
S0171	yeah they've get a nice garden though it's get a little pond in it
S0060	yeah they have yeah no it's a really nice place actually
S0171	mm
S0060	but it be a bite out in the wilds a bite away from everything
S0086	yeah you'd have to drive everywhere
S0171	yeah it's it's literally it's on a it's on a main road and there's only three house it's not you couldn't even deem it a village it's just a
S0086	there's not even like a local shop
S0060	nothing no nothing
S0171	no there's nothing there at all
S0060	the nearest be i suppose it's well
S0171	yeah
S0060	but i suppose really
S0171	but every time we go down there we always end up drive past it and have to come turn around and come back again
S0060	yeah it's one of those where the entrance be it's all sort of hedge and everything all along there and then the entrance be like in it em
S0171	he build some reflectors don't he outside to try and help people fine it but no and of course because it's on the right hand side of the road because you're do sixty down there cost it's obviously a main road you can't be crawl along at twenty miles an hour watch out for the reflectors you know
S0060	so when you're go down there you sort of you go ah there it be damn it
S0171	so every time we go down there yeah it's literally we're like a spill second away from it oh damn it we miss it fuck so then we've now get a a turn point which be nasty to come out of
S0060	well no thankfully
S0171	it's like some sort of farmer's front gate or sommat and we're use that to kind of get back out
S0060	yeah there's a it's like a quarry or something isn't it place that's obviously close down in the even or whatever just turn around in there and come back
S0171	and then as we're come back again it's like we're right wait for it wait for it be it come very soon
S0060	well it's easy it's easy to see that come that be it's easier to see isn't it but eh
S0171	i don't know be it
S0060	but eh yeah it be yeah
S0171	i always miss it
S0060	cos i can always see the house first whereas you come the other way and it's not till you're already pass it that you can see the house cos if the way it be em so it's eh yeah
S0086	it sound nice i've be think about move out of the city just cos it's so expensive you know even just to rent cos i can't afford to buy
S0060	well i mean here rent
S0171	we get a deal on this place
S0060	be be
S0171	we be lucky
S0060	it be just their own stupidity but thank
S0171	no it be not their stupid they be nice
S0060	we we gain we gain from it this place be less than we be pay for a two bedroom flat in town
S0086	and you've get a three bedroom house
S0060	yeah
S0086	nice
S0060	well i it be a hundred quid or something like that less wasn't it i think from memory
S0086	a hundred quid less a month
S0060	yeah
S0086	jesus
S0171	yeah it be
S0086	but you can't cycle from here can you into town
S0060	you've try it haven't you
S0171	not oh god no
S0086	you nearly die
S0171	that's hilarious that's fuck hilarious no when we i cos we'd leave the bike at the flat my bike at the flat and i say to oh no it'll be alright i'll just cycle it that's fine i'll cycle it and yeah it take me about three hours
S0086	mm
S0171	and i'd go up through and and come out that way
S0060	cos the the only way
S0171	and when you come out on to the main road at between that connect to and you know the other end the other side it's you're this close to fuck great big lorries
S0060	yeah so unless you want to try
S0086	yeah that's the thing
S0060	unless you want to ride on the a14 you've get to like go out and round
S0086	through the villages
S0171	through the stick yeah and that be fuck terrify i have to walk the last bite
S0060	but there's a there be there be a cycle path isn't there with with a little light up cycle path but it doesn't come all the way round
S0171	oh i don't know i end up i think at the time i end up use the the busway before the busway be actually build they'd just tarmacked it
S0060	yeah you can use that yeah
S0171	like they tarmacked it
S0060	there's there be a cycle path that go out i think it go out somewhere near but it then doesn't carry on round so you're then on just tiny little roads to come round the top side in from em
S0171	yeah i be bike i end up walk cos i couldn't cos you can't cycle on the on the road you can't it's just not possible so the only thing you've get leave to choose be grass and unfortunately the grass be not helpful but eh
S0086	yeah i think because you know cycle obviously quite popular i the city there's lot of websites that tell you all the cycle rout in and around the city so i think what i'll probably try and do be look at that map and then try and find somewhere that i can do that
S0060	the best thing to do be to go to you know where
S0086	no my geography be shit
S0060	i be just go to name a pub in town actually so you're you're bind to know that
S0086	oh yeah well i night know that
S0060	em it's what's it call it change name to i can't remember what
S0171	yeah he's just about to name a pub that he can't remember what the name of the pub be
S0086	and it's also change name
S0060	yeah
S0171	yeah
S0060	yeah it's the one in on the riverside
S0086	well that's where i live but all of those be close
S0060	so what's the pub
S0086	the be probably what you mean cos that change name the
S0086	yeah that's close
S0060	be it really
S0086	yeah all of the pubs apart from the have close in
S0060	oh no
S0086	all of the locals blame it on the gypsies i'm not sure we can blame everything on the gypsies much as everyone would like to the have close down the have close down there be one on the high street apparently before my time be close it's all board up just before you get down to high street tesco's it's just before there yeah so why would i have go there
S0060	not because it's a pub but from there there's a cycle path that go out all the way out to
S0086	go past doesn't it on the right
S0060	yeah but what's the what's where the train station be
S0086	
S0060	and then it carry on well it doesn't carry on but then you carry on up there i know that's there because i build it
S0086	ah nice
S0060	so i know there's a few guy a couple of guy who actually work for the council that live there and cycle in all the way down into
S0086	really from from
S0060	yeah
S0086	be really nice i don't think yeah it's probably cheaper than but there's it's get a couple of nice pubs
S0060	really
S0086	iit would have be nice mum use to live in the black house on the river which be also know as the x file house apparently
S0060	alright
S0086	em and from there you just have to walk around the river and round that bend you've get to the in so it would have be really nice to have a little bridge over there cos the only other bridge be the one by the so you've get to walk and if you walk on that other side it's all field be like a common but yeah i could do that definitely look into do that cos if you live in i mean that would be fine
S0060	there's load of place out here up for rent now
S0086	i know it's just it's just the em have to rely on the bus
S0060	well it's not that bad but you've get a car now
S0086	it's my dad's car i mean i basically have a car
S0060	yeah
S0086	but it's my dad's car if i the only reason i can use it so much be that
S0060	you'll probably find out that the money you could save you'd probably be able to run a car anyway
S0086	yeah
S0060	cos it make a well it's make a big i mean we're on a different tax bracket out here so we pay less tax
S0086	really
S0060	yeah less council tax
S0086	how's that oh council tax yeah
S0060	yeah yeah em less council tax i'll be honest and say the bill be actually a bite less as well despite it be a three bed that we're try to heat and everything but the rent be that lower
S0086	that's good
S0060	i mean i mean the silly thing be as well for me for the car i'm usually drive south down to london most days but it actually take me less time to get from here to london than it do from town to london you know it's it's another i think it's about another fifteen minutes sorry another fifteen miles further than we be and it probably take about fifteen minutes less
S0086	nice
S0060	to get down there and it make a big difference it's surprise you know just do the bite in and out of time cos we use to live em behind the cinema actually behind cinema
S0086	i oh yeah yeah
S0171	what's that road
S0086	mm
S0060	and to get out from there it eh you know and it's not far but eh it take a while
S0086	yeah you just get jam don't you that's the thing
S0060	i suppose where you be at the minute you be quite close out to the fourteen aren't you
S0086	yeah it's a really good location i'm in at the moment in term of get out but
S0060	you've get place like but they're a bite far out again
S0086	be not a cheap as i think it be go to be like
S0060	no cos it's all new or the new bite out to the north be ordinary obviously but the original bite n the middle but that's all old people so you know you've get to wait for them to die
S0086	yeah
S0060	but em
S0086	yeah it's it's i need to look into it really i just eh you know i turn thirty this year

S0086	bloody hell how be they go to do that
S0060	i think it's just that do you know what i mean the stuff can always take it but they've sort of drip fee it out really to show that they you know people would buy better each time sort of thing it's the same as microsoft isn't it you know a new version of window's every five minutes it's not because they've come up with a new thing it's just that they they drip fee out for yeah
S0086	they want us to pay for it
S0060	yeah if they'd come out with windows seven in nineteen eighty you would never have buy windows three point one would you but eh
S0086	ah hilarious bloody technology so how be the wed plan come along
S0060	well we be talk about it last night weren't we that you need to start eh
S0171	there's lot of talk go on
S0060	you need to start book some view
S0171	and lot of order go on
S0086	ah woman know your place
S0060	that's it
S0171	it be a bite like that but eh but know we're go to keep but i cos i've be work on saturday's you know i can't and won't
S0060	you don't reckon you're go to need to work now be you
S0171	well i do need to work i reserve a with work yesterday that i should have go and do
S0060	well there's other people at work
S0171	there be two actually there's probably guarantee to be one probably not so much with the second cos he hasn't actually do any saturday overtime at all
S0060	no
S0171	whereas be the guarantee one cos he's be do saturday weekend the same as i have but eh historical record manager himself em if he do turn up yesterday it be his first saturday overtime he's down at all
S0086	really and it's and it's their department that's kick off
S0171	it's it's them yeah it's their responsibility
S0086	so what's go on why be it so busy
S0171	because originally the vocational qualifications of historical record be base in coventry eh they close them down to save money
S0086	right so where be they now
S0171	so we have two weeks' worth of train in november before they be officially close down and make either redundant or second and eh we've be pick up the piece ever since november or the start of december em and it's be absolutely manic because the gq and the vq two different process so they're two different things you've get to try and remember and eh vq i pick up quite easily em and eh and the vq stuff i end up do before the exec stuff em i do a lot of post work in the morning so when it would all come in i would sort it all get it all do so i end up become the eh the vq post pro em and then we have start as a temp em which be before our start for the winter series and the idea be we be go to have two temps come in em one be and we have a one a week later call be difficult
S0060	those weren't the word you use the other day
S0171	well i it be the kindest word and eh and then there be and end up be i be obviously train him on vq post so he naturally sit next to me but the idea be be that be suppose to be do vq and because wasn't wasn't guarantee to be start or at least a temp for in ' position be suppose to be someone start eh but then end up start and she be my ex checker but i couldn't get her to do anything
S0086	mm
S0171	em i end up chuck her all over the stuff but she couldn't even pick that up em she she couldn't log them either and
S0086	mm she just a bite simple be she
S0171	i be like jesus jesus weep em so that wasn't work too well and then of course i've get breathe down my back with breathe down 's back
S0086	mm
S0171	about how the stats be crap
S0086	yeah
S0171	so i'm now work longer hours and longer days then cominghome to get a belly ache from say you shouldn't be do it
S0060	yeah well well well
S0171	cos i be unpaid i wasn't be pay for it
S0060	yeah that that
S0086	oh really well no that's not on
S0060	yeah that's what i be grumble about
S0171	yeah
S0060	and especially as you tell me you be get it and then
S0171	mm mm no i never once lie to you
S0060	mm
S0171	when i be work on vq as overtime that be overtime
S0060	mm
S0171	it's just like it office politics be bollocks
S0086	mm mm
S0171	because it be it be a case of if i want to finish at five but then do extra time if i do vq i'd be pay for it if i do i wouldn't
S0086	mm
S0171	and eh it be that be suffer because i be have to do vq if i want to be pay
S0086	god that's weird though
S0171	so i go go bollocks to that then i'll just do and
S0086	what be the point of i mean generally in life
S0171	just generally in life i don't know
S0086	cos be he help at all
S0171	he's try to but he's he's obviously manage me and
S0086	mm
S0171	em ad he'll the the one thing that really pee me off with be that he expect me to do things for him immediately
S0086	right
S0171	and i i
S0086	he's get no concept of how busy you be
S0171	my mentality be be generally to be rude and i don't actually mean to be but i be most of the time i'm rude to him i'm like yeah it can wait yeah it can wait you know and i be like i can't remember what i'm do and then i get he know i'm go to do it it's not you know i mean i'll get it do within five minutes
S0086	mm mm yeah
S0171	em but sometimes it's it's it's he'll start pass things over to me cos you know those you won't i don't know if you ever saw them but the the dividers the the pin board that divide our desks
S0086	oh right
S0171	he'll slop a bite of paper over it just leave it there yeah sure i'll do that and it's other things like mirs right
S0086	mm
S0171	we're in the in the midst of vq last this week just go we've have two two people second to other departments and we've lose two
S0086	mm
S0171	we've get half of the team that be leave come own with a cold
S0086	mm
S0171	and then of course half of those guy that be have a cold be not come in cos they be sick
S0086	mm
S0171	em and then we have go on eh leave for the back end of last week
S0086	oh right yeah
S0171	so there be that there be me still turn up late em oli be off sick we have a new temp we still have and that be about it but then we've get to we're suppose to be cover gq and vq as well as mirs
S0086	oh really mm mm
S0171	and eh yeah it's be a nightmare and neil will say to me i'm in the middle of try to do vq or search or something
S0086	mm
S0171	em and he'll say oh there's an mir in pick it up to neil and he do he do pick them up but he's kind of get to a stage where he cheat now cos he'll pick them up look at them and if it's not a delete mark support so it's not something really really easy he'll ask me to pick it up or he'll give me the mir tell me to vestigate it and then he'll resolve it off
S0086	he's a horror isn't he
S0171	yeah
S0086	he only really like do the interest ones the difficult ones
S0171	mm
S0086	you know he would cherry pick
S0171	mm
S0086	the ones that he want to do that's what i always use to find really frustrate about him
S0060	just a think have you actually ask whether she like mushroom or not
S0171	i have already kind of ask if she's allergic to anything
S0060	oh okay
S0086	i do like mushroom now i didn't eat them until about a year or so ago
S0171	mm
S0086	i i'm a grow

S0086	mm
S0171	cos i have the phili cookbook
S0060	yeah there be a phili cookbook and
S0171	phili cookbook and i go absolutely mental for phili and but eh but no this this i think i end up i'm an experimental cooker don't like instructions so although phili the phili book obviously help but i don't like
S0060	the only reason you don't like instruction be cos they be not detail enough so when it's
S0171	be he call me stupid
S0060	yeah pretty much yeah
S0171	no it's cos if it if it doesn't say exactly the way to like turn the spoon over to do something you you throw a fit
S0171	anyway and then after that
S0086	mm
S0086	we're go to have some gnocchi with some garlic bread
S0086	oh that sound delicious
S0171	mm but it's a it's a creamy creamy pesto sauce so it's it's just like pesto

S0060	and eh we look at it and oneand obviously with her fly thing but
S0086	yeah
S0060	the money to go for their wed it be like bloody hell you know
S0086	people be so selfish
S0060	be lovely for your wed wouldn't it but
S0086	mm it's like people get marry in thailand my cousins get marry in thailand i think it be deliberately
S0060	i know yeah they be quite ah we say well you know we're not gonna come sort of thing mm it's our wed why can't you come like cos it's go to cost us like a grand or something to come
S0086	yeah absolutely
S0060	and yeah it would be nice if it be like we be have a holiday anyway
S0086	mm mm
S0060	eh but eh but yeah
S0086	yeah that's it it be like the cost of a holiday isn't it
S0060	yeah
S0086	excuse me yeah well i get quite a god deal on a hotel in brighton as well i mean it be essentially just like a little bed it's a single bed in a
S0060	yeah
S0086	room it's a b and b and i'll only be there to put my head on the pillow
S0060	yeah
S0086	so that'll be fine
S0060	no it's something we've have to think about for ours be that obviously most of hannah's family be sort of
S0086	far far
S0060	scotland most of my family be sort of down in berkshire or on the south coast
S0086	yeah
S0060	and it's kind of you know wherever we pick you know we've get to make sure that there's somewhere everyone can stay that's a reasonable
S0086	mm
S0060	price if they want to stop over and things like that and
S0086	yeah
S0060	you know so that be why what be the other place we're go to look at the one you really want for the wed
S0171	i want to go to eh hotel felix
S0060	felix that's it and eh no sooner have she mention this to my mum than she's be obviously look at it and apparently there's a deal they do where when you book
S0086	mm
S0060	em for a wed function there they give you three room as part of the three you know three room for the night as part of the thing
S0086	oh okay
S0060	so my mum go so that would be one room for you or room for me and your dad and one you know like right okay i can see how this be go
S0086	mm
S0060	but uh
S0086	nice nice yeah well it's an expensive business get marry
S0060	yeah it's surprise the difference in price with some of the ones we've see there's some where you're get virtually nothing and it's
S0086	mm
S0060	really expensive and others where you're get way more for a lot lot less and it's like
S0086	really you're notice a real difference
S0060	yeah yeah yeah
S0086	mm that's interest
S0060	yeah it's surprise
S0086	yeah
S0060	but eh
S0086	that's really strange you'd think that people would you know kick off about that
S0060	i think a lot of it they they do it on the name of the venue and you know they can sort of say oh you know but eh
S0086	mm but at least round here you know you sometimes do get discount on travelodge and premier inn like i notice in brighton because it's you know hen party and stag do and whatever like it's always popular and the travelodge be never less than a hundred pound
S0060	yeah
S0086	even when they do these special nine pound a night things
S0060	oh yeah
S0086	you never get it i mean unless you're there during the week em it's never very cheap bloody weddings i've get time to eh prepare myself for yours then if it's two years if you be think april fourteen be you
S0060	the nineteenth of april
S0086	nineteenth of april

S0060	i'm glad it be you on the open to her not me actually cos she would've have a go at me for not remember
S0171	yeah cos if it be you she would've she probably would have kill you
S0060	yeah and her birthday's the day after
S0171	mm
S0060	like no yeah the day after that's right yeah
S0171	oh that's another thing that keep tell me be that he think that his parent like me more than they like him
S0086	aw
S0171	so that could well be that might well be why i manage to get away with it
S0060	they definitely grumble at me and not at you i get grumble at
S0171	that's cos they know i'm a sensitive soul
S0060	ohh you're the one that get all the special food all the things sort for you
S0171	i do yes they be very accommodate
S0060	whereas me i just get whatever's gong
S0171	like she'll em most of the time she'll know that she'll always get chicken if she's do a roast she'll get chicken for me
S0060	oh okay mm
S0171	everyone else will have beef or lamb or whatever but she'll get me some chicken
S0060	yeah

S0171	my mum use to cook it and she use to cook a lot of stew and i hat them
S0086	mm
S0171	cos she would chuck anything in them and do hat them
S0060	yeah you see that's where the idealize mum because she be she's very good at cook so she would cook all sort of different things and it be good
S0171	yeah
S0060	so our our i mean i i i wasn't i be a fussy eater when i be a kid but you know over the years and stuff you know i'll just eat anything you know i can't think well no that's a lie there's only one thing that i can say now that i would rather not eat i would rather starve than eat and that's celery i absolutely cannot stand it

S0060	no you're mean to i say you're mean to plan out the even you know have the eh have a comedian
S0086	what's our evening's entertainment go to be
S0171	well i'm not go to get some sort of
S0086	belly dance
S0171	god no
S0086	i'm most disappoint
S0171	no you're not
S0086	i love a bite of come dine with me i'd quite like to do it but i can't cook i mean if people be happy with fish finger sandwich then that's fine cos that's what i can cook
S0171	ah do you know what i've have a seriously bad bad experience with fish finger
S0086	you haven't
S0171	i have
S0086	what do you have what happen
S0171	it be disgust i think i decide to cook i've not have fish finger since but i don't know what the hell happen but we'd cook them and we then tuck in i just have a mouthful of one and it's i don't even know it must have be off
S0060	they be em
S0171	yeah probably rotten more than off
S0060	no no no well they be
S0171	you eat them i don't know why
S0060	cos i'm double hard
S0171	obviously get the stomach for it
S0060	what it be be they we have no food in so we think well we'll defrost something from the freezer and we have these fish finger in there but i think they'd be in there quite some time and when they come out they weren't we'd cook them cos they didn't you know they don't look any different when they're freeze and eh they be just a little bite dodgy
S0086	aw do they smell
S0060	eh they didn't smell but they do taste a bite weird
S0171	they taste disgust
S0060	with anything at all
S0171	cos they be nice
S0060	whenever something doesn't taste the same as it do the time before hat's it it's the end of that as a food
S0086	game over aw
S0171	yeah the thing be that be really annoy that really annoy me with him be that now since then at every opportunity i'll say to him have you check that be it still in date be it alright do it smell alright even chicken even chicken that we buy precook from like waitrose if it smell funny or if it's a bite watery i'll run it under his nose be that alright be that alright he'll be like yeah it's fine just eat
S0086	it's really difficult with freeze foods though because obviously you don't know quite how long it's be there so all the date be wrong so it could have be in there six months but it's freeze so it's okay but it might have be in there a year in which case chuck it
S0060	no i i find quite often things like fish don't last very well in the freezer
S0086	my fish finger don't have the chance to last till they go off i'd cook a really good chilli the other day actually
S0060	yeah
S0086	yeah i generally well i don't ever cook with beef mince my mum raise me as a veggie so we always use to use quorn or soya mince so that's what i cook with like the smell of beef actually turn my stomach the smell of it fry yeah i could eat a burger but i'm not a massive fan normally have veggie
S0060	no i be eh my years of college and then eh live away from home with work here there and everywhere my my idea of food be whatever will keep me alive of the longest with the minimum of effort into make
S0171	actually do something that's good when he do do when he do cook with him just say how he chuck everything in a pan and do it one thing he do do well be your tagliatelle
S0060	yeah that's cos it's easy
S0171	yeah well cos he we have like chorizo onion mushroom and he just chuck it all in cook it all and then just toss it all together that's kind of unit food isn't it you just kind of chuck it all in
S0086	yeah everything in a pan one pan food
S0171	yeah
S0086	my uncle come cos like my mum's birthday be yesterday and em he love to cook which be brilliant cos none of us like cook and he make a really nice risotto it be a pea a mushroom it be basically all we could find in tesco like wild mushroom peas white wine but my mum and my sister be veggie so we cook a pan of risotto and for me him and my brother he cook this chicken and it's just really basic you just put it in a pan bite of butter bite of stock bite of mustard bite of black pepper bite of thyme it be amaze it be really really nice he's quite confident about what go together i think when i try i put like chinese five spice with thyme and it just or mint and everything taste a bite weird i've get no comprehension of what like for italian dish you should use this and chinese dish you should use this it all just go in together
S0060	i always remember do different stuff at at unit and i end up literally there be a row well in fact i've do the same ere actually at the back of the cooker there be a row of all different sort of herb and spice and whatever and it would literally right what shall i do to add some flavour into it cos otherwise it's just totally bland yeah
S0086	i've get a bite of thing with of have a dish of food that all taste the same as well but that's quite difficult but that that's the thing about risotto or pasta that sort of put me off i like it but i suppose after about half way through it's sort of
S0060	a bite much of that yeah
S0086	all the same i suppose when you go to a restaurant they just give you quite a small amount don't they i mean in our house there's four girls and one bloke ad the bloke be the one who do all the cook it's hilarious i try as much as possible not to cook

S0060	it be lovely
S0171	and we be sit outside in the sun it be really nice and i say to i hate the fuck sun i bloody hate sun i can't stand it and i go well actually no that's a lie cos i like the sun it's just what come with it that i don't like then i can go out for a fag and be terrify
S0060	no i mean i don't like hot hot weather but i do prefer what we've be have the last sort of week or so it's be nice
S0086	yeah cos you can sit out in it it the sun's warm but it's not too overpower it's not that sort of heat where you can't move
S0060	no i suffer unfortunately with the sort of low sun especially like sort of drive at morning and even into the sun sort of and eh i end up with very very bad eye it's bad at the minute i must go the doctor and say i've get very very dry eye
S0086	oh no
S0060	and eh sort of when i wake up in the morning it's like i've just be cheese grate around my eye in the night they're so sore
S0086	oh no
S0060	but eh but yeah the bright sun doesn't help but
S0086	have you have that before
S0060	when i when i be little em i use to suffer with this eh i can't remember what it's call now but basically my my eye be very photosensitive so like if i be out play like during the day when it get to the even and then sort if it be get darker my eye would burn it would feel like they have em 'scuse me like hot grit in them
S0086	mm
S0060	i use to have like cream and i use to wear sunglasses all the time even like an overcast day i'd have to wear dark glass and stuff cos i mean i don't get it anywhere near as bad now as i use to but i still do get it you can sort of you know drive with it sort of bright now i know i'm go to be sort of have bad eye that night sort of thing
S0086	mm rubbish i use to feel really sorry for the kid at school who have really bad hay fever you know and as soon as the summer term start they let you go out in the grass and the play friend and there be a kid and he be he couldn't he like even just look at the grass his eye would start to stream
S0060	really
S0086	he have to stand on the playground and everyone else be off play in the grass sad little face and jut really use to suffer from it
S0060	unfortunately i do think that's a symptom of the way we live these days that you know we've spend so many years just pour disinfectant over ourselves and you know that just not get any tolerance of anything you know it's awful i mean i i suffer very badly with the with dust allergies so i take anti histamine which work brilliantly for years i use to just say no it's all mumbo jumbo it doesn't make any difference it's try to sell you something em i try it for a few weeks and i mean i i would i would have like sneeze fit and my eye would be stream and now hardly anything at all be it
S0171	mm well only when you remember to take them
S0060	well yeah when i forget to take them it it get a bite but yeah make a big difference but i mean like you say there's people out there now that even the slightest hint of anything they're bloom a wreck but eh you know all these peanut allergies and all this stuff now that everyone have to be so aware of you know it be never even hear of didn't exist but it's get worse and worse and worse more people more allergies and stuff i mean they reckon bloom globally reduce the bloom male sperm count because of the amount of oestrogen in water because so many women be take the pill and it obviously get put back into the into the water supply mm
S0086	oh my god blimey it's funny
S0171	that's alright women will always rule the world
S0086	yeah
S0171	that's one way of do it put some hormones in the system
S0060	cos there's so much you know go through it the water supply through
S0171	you all do mrs
S0060	you know all that recycle yeah
S0086	i'm do that be delicious thank love mm
S0086	it's like when you see the anti bacterial spray isn't it with mum and their baby you think baby need germs actually they need to build up a resistance
S0060	well i can remember when i be a kid be take round to the kid that have chicken pox or the measles or whoever so that you'd catch it you know but now it's all about you know keep them all in a little cotton wool cocoon and not expose them to it and then you see guy when they get into their thirties you know twenties or thirties or forties get something that when you're that age it you know like chicken pox and things like measles especially it can do horrible stiff to you when you're older
S0086	when you're an adult absolutely doesn't it do things to your testes
S0060	yeah measles do and chicken pox can cause you to get shingle and things like that
S0086	elephantitis of the ball
S0060	yeah
S0086	it's not what you want
S0060	not really
S0086	not when people be go to be see them or or just carry them around that must be quite a hardship do you need a hand
S0171	oh no i'm alright love it's not actually me that cook it it's the the oven
S0086	ooh lovely
S0060	but no
S0086	ah dvds how many dvds do you think you've get
S0060	far too many
S0086	you've get load do you watch them
S0060	yeah yeah
S0171	how any of these should i do shall i do one or shall i do tow be one go to be enough
S0086	em yeah probably probably i would only have a a couple of bits
S0171	you'd eat the whole thing wouldn't you
S0060	no no no i know you i'll end up with the two end so yeah that's fine you two can share the middle
S0171	yeah then i'll just do the one
S0086	cos i be like this i get into a real habit it's almost like an addiction you know you see a movie and you buy it and you buy it and you buy it and i really have to stop myself
S0060	yeah no 's get that anything anything she see at tesco's that she think ooh that might be we get it
S0086	yeah it's easily do through and i just i be get to the point where i think i'm never go to watch these again what be i do but it's it's collectables i'm like with book though i'm the same the book and nowhere to put them which be why i'd quite like my own little bedsit
S0060	well that's why there's there's book everywhere that's that's me stack book up everywhere
S0086	run out of space you just you have get a lot of things haven't you do you need more shelve units
S0060	yeah i i win i own like one or two things
S0171	yeah extreme need
S0086	yeah
S0171	yes of course you do yeah everything else be all mine right if you're go to excise me i'm go to go outside for a cigarette i shall not be a moment don't be rude
S0060	me i'm never rude no we've get em we know that we didn't have much storage space so we buy two two or three i can't remember excuse me of those book case so we've get one upstairs that's get load of stuff on it but eh that's what one so the back bedrooms virtually be just a bloom storage repository bookcases and cabinets and stuff to keep everything
S0086	well that's the thing cos i for a while i be move all the time so i basically just have a handkerchief on a stick you know i be really get really ruthless i be cull everything but then it get to a point where you think i've get to want this stuff and i eventually i hopefully will actually have a home rather than just a room that's the thing about house share you don't i don't feel like i can spread out i mean we don't have a live room if we do i don't think i'd put any of my stuff in it
S0060	when eh before i move here with with i mean the stuff i have at regency square i hardly have anything at all really but eh but since then we've kind of fill you know expand to fill the space that we've get sort of thing
S0086	yeah
S0060	with the eh
S0086	well you you would do as well
S0060	i know i mean i mean like we be say earlier i really struggle to see the point of of move from where we be it be like well you know it's a great place it's big enough for what we need blah blah blah blah blah but have since move out here i mean it's a lot lot better
S0086	mm it's good that you're notice a difference
S0060	oh yeah well there it be always helter skelter hustle bustle and you know busy streets lot of noise whereas out here it's all very calm and relax it's a lot easier to get to em yeah if we go into town or whatever you know well if it's during the day we get a bus but if we're go in for a you know go to the bar or something in the even or something it's what twelve quid or something for a taxi which be nothing in the grand scheme of things you know it's a few pints of beer
S0086	that's really good actually be that how much it be about twelve quid
S0060	yeah what be the what be the the taxi for you the other day
S0171	oh
S0060	to get home
S0171	it's usually about fourteen pound but
S0086	that's really good though
S0060	fourteen pound alright
S0086	that's really good though cos for me to get a cab from where i be on cost about eight nine pound
S0171	god i think the last time i catch a taxi though he actually charge me less i don't know if he's just be nice or if he's or if he's cos he charge me twelve by the time we get in
S0060	yeah i i be just say twelve cos i think that be what you pay last time
S0171	yeah it be the last time yeah
S0060	but eh where i be at at that use to be like twenty two pound or something like that
S0086	jeez
S0060	yeah and that that be back in the days when we use to go into town a lot more often
S0171	yes those be the days i cannot anymore park eh
S0086	we're grownups now
S0171	yeah we're grownups now we don't get any more but eh but no i remember cos with taxis it depend on where they go and most of the time i mean obviously they're allow to use the the bus ways you know the bus barriers they can get through them and i think that's probably what he do differently be when he come out of town
S0060	oh so he take the short cut
S0171	he go he go a slightly different way and although the other the other taxi take me you know the the road that run between lloyds and eh lloyds and boot
S0060	yeah i know where you mean
S0171	he be take me through that way whereas the last taxi have take me straight through via the bus route
S0060	well i always use to think that em go out in be cos we be you know once you go across the a fourteen it become more expensive if you cross and go outside of the town sort of thing but eh
S0086	taxis man they're a joke i mean when and when it snow you know six weeks ago or whatever it be my friend live in but she be in the city we be go to meet on the saturday night but she be with her fella during the day i think i be home wait to hear from her and then the snow start it start on saturday night didn't it
S0060	yeah
S0086	early even and i think ah i'll just wait for her to text me but i won't come and meet i'll get her to some here just get a cab and then it start snow quite heavily and i hadn't hear from her so i give her a ring it be about seven o'clock and i say where be you she say oh we're in the pub we're just we have dinner and we get carry away sorry where be you and i as like oh i'm at home it's snow she's like what she get out of the pub and she be like holy moley i have no idea it be go to snow and i be like be you be serious she say no i didn't check the weather forecast like how be you go to get home she's like yeah how how be i go to get home mm i may as well look at the bus and then i'll call you back walk to the bus station on no bus no sign no nothing and i say just get a cab home and we'll meet another time and the cab weren't go they wouldn't even leave the city and so she get a cab to mine next morning manage to get a cab but not until later in the day cos if all that snow panther charge her i think they want to charge her and extra ten pound go between because it's instead of go from to go from my house rather than from town even though normally it would cost about like seven or eight pound to get from mine to town want to charge her an extra ten pound so the cab home to haverhill cost thirty five quid
S0060	no
S0086	yeah taxis in be a joke so expensive the meter start at like four pound doesn't it so bad
S0060	no that that saturday you be talk about we be out and about and we'd come back and there'd be no sign of anything we be home and we be go out on the sunday and we get up the next morning and it be like what on earth's happen here kind of things
S0086	mm there be load of it wasn't there
S0060	em well we'd get we we it be fine for us come out on the sunday and we drive out down and literally all round the loop road there be cars park up on the verge where they'd obviously the the main road have be eh clear but no one could actually get in to their road o they just par there and walk so there be just a long line of cars all the way round and we're like this be weird so we drive out round isn't it do you remember that
S0171	what's that
S0086	the abandon cars
S0060	all the cars that be park along round the road in the snow
S0171	ah god yeah well you know the last time it snow it wasn't really a lot be it
S0060	no no
S0171	not really
S0086	it be more flowy
S0171	well there be em abandon cars up on the top of the hill again
S0060	yeah
S0171	there be hardly nothing hardly a bite of snow and they go in and ah bugger it and just abandon their cars
S0060	yeah but unfortunately these days any bite of snow be just use as an excuse now ah it's snow i can't get to work i can't do this can't do that yeah i mean i remember last last january the year before last rather yeah year and bite and eh i be i have to go for eh we have we have our monthly like commercial review at the regional office and for me i normally i would leave at five and would get there for seven so i can miss all the traffic on the m25 and eh i'd leave and it be when i mean all the real bad snow and i leave at five and i get there at eight l and i sit outside cos wait for someone to turn up to open it up and everything and it get to half past ten and no one have turn up so i just want oh bugger that i'm go to go and it take me it only take me two hours to get home because obviously by half past ten all the people that be go to try have try and just it be do no one else be travel so it be clear em but i mean there be people that be that live almost in walk distance of the office and they just hadn't even bother to come in i'm like i've drive a hundred miles and i've get there where be everybody else you know people that be really close to the office and didn't even bother to try and go in you know really pee me off but eh i mean i can remember when eh good few years ago when be that nine years ago now yeah will have be nine years ago when the m eleven end up in shit because of the snow and they hadn't grit anything and i be work at harlow at the time but live out on the m four and eh i'd leave and it be i'd leave at sort of basically say oh we need to get go otherwise we're go to get stick and i'd leave at three o'clock or four o'clock something like that i'd come out onto the m11 go south and there be nobody i mean there be snow everywhere but it be like where be everybody what's go on and it be cos it be close further up where it have just be totally white out and it be so bad that people be stick in their cars like over like twenty four hours and they be in their cars and they be run out of fuel where they would have it leave of tick over to keep warm and things like that and it be like days before all of them be eh clear but i mean thankfully i be sort of ahead of the storm so to speak so i get home and everything fine but yeah they've never it's never be well they've they've always be more prepare for it now but then they'd do absolutely nothing before the snow they know it be come but they'd do nothing cos they didn't think it be really go to be as bad and like suddenly the whole of the m eleven be totally out of it totally go
S0171	well that's what they do this year didn't they after last years they end up stock up on extra salt and extra grit and then they've not not really use it now cos it's not be that bad
S0060	well they haven't need to but the whole thing be everyone every year moan say oh well how can you know place like norway and sweden and all this cope and it's cos they have a lot more often a lot more regularly so they pay to have stuff in place well we can all pay more tax and have snow plough and grit and all this sit there do nothing for eleven months of the year and maybe do something for a month maybe
S0086	absolutely yeah
S0060	and eh
S0171	well it's not even month though be it
S0060	well no it's not few weeks if that
S0171	it doesn't last a month
S0060	and it's like well you know people aren't go to do it they'll moan and gripe about it but if you actually say them okay well
S0086	give us some more money then
S0060	okay an extra hundred pound a month in tax and we'll have it all sort for you everybody would be up in arm oh well don't need it rah
S0086	absolutely be interest to find out what they do about the privatisation of the roads they be talk about that last week
S0060	yeah that's interest yeah they've they've be say well no no exist roads will be make into toll roads
S0086	yeah load of new roads
S0060	so so there's go to be a lot of new roads go up to say there you go use this
S0171	more work for you then darling
S0060	well it will be i mean that's it all start with the m six toll which we build you know that be one of the first eh dartford cross obviously be a toll but the dartford cross be the one i still curse them because when that be build it be that it would only operate as a toll until it pay off the bill
S0171	yeah yeah
S0060	em but they obviously realise they be go to make too much money out of it so it's it's operate as a toll ever since cos they long long ago pay off the bill
S0086	pay off the builders yeah well they're say the the if they do expand the a14 it will be pay for the toll do you think that's what's go to happen
S0060	they've have one the book plan for do it for so long but there's always be so much protest over what would have to be do cos it go through so many middle of the nothing place and eh it's be put back and put back and put back and put back you know but i mean the there's some very basic stuff that they could do which would make it so much better you know get rid of all of these at grey junctions so like catthorpe interchange and all of those junctions where you're come down everything's come down to nothing and then wind through a tiny little bite and then go again you know get rid of them and make them grade separate junctions where the a fourteen carry on and it's just people then come off and it would make it a lot easier but eh but yeah i think they're go to have to get a lot more money just to overcome all the the protest and wooha there be in the different areas and yeah probably the only way to do that be to to say oh yeah we're go to have it operate and maintain by a company that's go to fund it you know so i wouldn't be surprise if you know probably some of my lot end up come up with something of how they could do it fund it and operate it you know pfis be a lot of the things these days so just have a taste see if it be poison
S0171	if it be poison i think the pair of us would be in a lot of trouble
S0060	we might have keel over be interest to see if they do anything to a ten on the way to norwich cos that roads pretty em pretty slow isn't it if you get stick behind a tractor you're screw
S0060	well they be go to build this new town weren't they em somewhere
S0171	don't we go down the a ten to go down to read
S0060	no the a one
S0171	oh
S0060	the a ten do go all the way down there just between what's the next bridge up can't remember what it be on the a10
S0171	
S0060	no no you're go the other way
S0086	you're go south
S0060	north
S0086	em i can't remember what it be now but there be plan to do that
S0086	ely be the a ten isn't it
S0060	sorry
S0086	ely be on the a ten isn't it
S0060	ely yeah but not that far up em and there be a load of hooha say well you know you've get all these plan for build it it be like ten or twenty thousand new house they be go to build and it be like there be all these plan for build and this but you've not get any plan to improve the a ten so where be all these people go to go they're go to commute down to cambridge or they're go to come to cambridge to get on the train to go into london you know where be they all go to come they're go to come down on the twenty ten twenty miles of the a10 which already be pretty chock a block every day em but yeah i mean they be talk i don't know whether it's go to happen of build a new train station to the south of cambridge to act as a commuter station so instead of everyone have to come into cambridge to get a eh to get a train rather it would go there and and get a commuter line down but i've not hear any more about that but eh
S0086	i think they should do that with the students you know they're build load of em new flats and house in the c b one quarter they're build them for students well students can fuck off quite frankly put them in a little village with a bus a couple of time a day and you know
S0060	there's load of what do they call it i can't there's some name which basically mean cheap and nasty but it's not
S0086	house association
S0060	no cos they don't nothing be call the house association anymore
S0086	oh right
S0060	it be em a type of house they call it now what's it what do they call it cos when we be there build the riverside bridge they be there's a big house development on the south side of the river isn't there and it be all about how certain ones of them be go to be price as you know for get a decent amount of money and there be other ones they be have to build as part of the plan permission and it be call this other thing and i can't remember
S0086	affordable house
S0060	no it wasn't it wasn't it be something i can't think what it be
S0086	welfare house
S0060	but yeah it basically mean it it basically mean affordable but it wasn't it be a you know a bite of a phrase i can't remember what it be cos we be talk to them cos obviously why we while we be there work and everything and they be say ah yeah you know because it at the time i be sort of think oh maybe i could you know buy something here and that and but when we be talk to them it be like ah yeah you wouldn't want to look at any of these and i be like why be that oh well just you know the one's over there that were' go to be charge out at sort of three hundred grand cos they're go to have riverside frontage and this that and the other they use all the nice materials and all the cheap chit get put into these ones over here and it's like really look bad but eh but yeah
S0086	that's bad but that's how they get away with it cheeky they should be build house with solar panel as well really shouldn't they
S0060	do you read there be a thing in the news some little old couple have be tell they've get to remove twelve thousand pound worth of solar panel that they put on their house cos they never get plan permission to do it and it doesn't fit in with the local
S0086	no way they won't you know postdate the plan permission they won't agree to it
S0060	say they wouldn't agree to it wouldn't ever wouldn't even agree to if they'd apply so they have to remove it
S0086	mm twelve grand that's a killer
S0060	it be basically they'd they'd do it because it would get them
S0086	would save them
S0060	they would have no need to to rely on the national grid anymore and the local council turn around and say no it's doesn't doesn't fit with the local area and you get to remove it all
S0086	that's rubbish that's the sort of thing you see on grand design isn't it when they do all these lovely things and they're like yeah plan permission be you know it's just wait for the sign off and you think that's dangerous
S0060	i always remember when we build eh the at the junction at we have the offices and the sort of compound in that little well they call it the teardrop it's basically that bite of horrible scrubby land on the side of as you drive into
S0086	oh yeah yeah
S0060	and there the guy have plan suppose plan permission there for a development there because he want to sell it to eh like travelodge or something like that he obviously never get permission cos obviously they build on the south side by what be or whatever it's now but eh but yeah so that stay as a horrible little bite of scrub land with its ponies and whatever on it as the entrance to
S0086	oh charm yeah one of my colleagues just buy a house in she say it's nice but i'm
S0060	some of its some of its quite new but
S0086	it's new that's what that's what put me off i don't i don't really want to end up anywhere new i need somewhere with a bite of character but need must
S0060	cos you've get what's it call the berry the strawberries and blackberry and all the roads round the top end be call
S0086	oh be they i don't know it that well i mean be it suppose to be a little village in it's own right be it suppose to have it's own
S0060	yeah yeah yeah it's get everything well i mean there's big tesco's there eh but it's a village in it's own right so it's get like a few little shop and things
S0086	have it get a school
S0060	i don't know i can't remember ever see one in honesty but it's get like there's a a doctor a you know a chiropractors and a you know takeaways and pubs and you know all that kind of palaver em and there's a little sort of business estate it's actually not really a business estate but there's a sort of industrial business bite there and obviously just across the a fourteen be the science park and everything
S0086	yeah yeah it be a great location
S0060	yeah you can walk across now actually well there a bridge there's a pedestrian bridge across
S0086	be there oh that's quite good
S0060	yeah literally you can go north to south across the a14 across the pedestrian bridge
S0086	oh that's good cos i be think about go you know and that's not very far from me so i must find out where the bridge be
S0060	well it's right there right on the junction
S0086	be it
S0060	literally right there
S0086	so as you drive past the science park approach the roundabout
S0060	it's on your right
S0086	it's on your right oh ok
S0060	you can literally you can walk on the science park up and across the bridge and into tesco's virtually you have to cross two roads but you do get there you go straight across
S0086	oh that's quite good
S0060	literally as you go if you're on the a14 you go under the the junction and it's literally right there as you go through the big arch little architecturally do bridge
S0086	okay i'm go to investigate
S0060	yeah that's be there oh a good long while now
S0086	i never pay much attention i don't think i've ever i think i've only be to a couple of time that be on my drive lessons when i start to learn the area
S0060	it's alright but it be quite expensive it's not cheap because it's right next to the science park so they charge a lot for the convenience you alright
S0171	yeah

S0086	yeah you know but they em i think it's because also the press be a start off as uk company even though it's global now if you be you know an employee live in another country there the you get certain benefit rather than six weeks you get three months so eh which they don't need to offer you but you do get other perk as well but em that's pretty intense so she's leave for three months cover and three months maternity it's quite nice you can go for a long coffee break long lunch but it's pretty busy at the moment try to keep my head above water with the new job pretend like i know what i'm do say word and hope that they're the right ones say yes in all in the meet and then go back to your desk and cry
S0060	oh no
S0086	what have i agree to mm it's good though
S0060	well as long as it pay the bill
S0086	yeah yeah yeah this be the year that i clear my overdraft which i'm practically there so that's good and i'm put money aside so i'm think my birthday be in december my best mate turn thirty three weeks before so we're think that we'll go to new york cos i've never be

S0086	yea you've get to pay you've get to pay to go from america as well i mean i it's impossible for a an american citizen to fly from america to cuba i don't know i think it's a massive hassle do it as a british traveller they charge you a hell of a lot
S0060	when we try to do it i mean this be a long time ago it be a load of hassle and we say oh we're not bother
S0086	which be why i go into mexico and fly from there and it be much easier and they don't stamp your passport now when you leave cuba for for american nationals so they can't tell that's where they've be with the embargo i demand a stamp on my passport but em yeah but they don't stamp

S0086	wow
S0060	and the two of us the two guy we'd be drink like most of the day and we be real bad and the other's have come and meet us and eh the guy that be with i can't remember what the hell be his name i can't remember his name now but he'd be alright when i be chuck up but so far go and he buy em as we be leave the bar so that i could be sick on the beach he buy a bottle of eh like don perignon or something like that it be like a it be a hundred and twenty dollars or something and the footage of me vomit there on the sun lounger then pan across to him with this bottle of bollinger do or whatever it be do this on it and then two minutes later he's vomit up this hundred and twenty dollars worth of champagne or whatever it be on to the beach
S0086	ah bless that's not what you want
S0060	well no we we be there two or three week i think we be there in florida and i mean we didn't do any of the sort of em we didn't go to mgm any of the the like disneyland or any of the sort of touristy place but there be just absolutely tonnes to do it be really really good
S0086	i'd love to go to florida i've be watch a lot of dexter
S0060	yeah
S0086	so definitely would love to go to miami it's very it be a very strange to be like it's a mix of like really old people and young people go to theme park
S0060	yeah i be go to say yeah when you're on the eh sort of all the beach like south beach and everything be all very fancy and all very you know do up sort of thing but then there's a lot of other bits of it which be very sort of much older and very different style but no miami be really nice really enjoy down in to the quays em and eh the everglades the everglades be really nice
S0086	yeah do you go on one of those boat with a propeller
S0060	yeah yeah their boat yeah
S0086	nice
S0060	yeah go out to an alligator farm and all of this but eh but we'd go eh it be spring break so obviously the whole of america have descend on florida anyway we didn't quite realise this before we before we get there but eh but no it be really good but eh it be about when we get there it be thirty degrees and about eight per cent humidity and we'd go first we'd go up in further north in florida before come down into the everglades and the down into the quays and we be just due to drive back to miami to get the flight home when in the quays it have get to i think it be like forty degrees and hundred per cent humidity and it have just get the the point where i be start to go no i'm go to die if we don't leave sort of thing em but eh once we get out of the quays and back up to like miami it be nice but eh
S0086	yeah that's intense you can't really have a holiday like that can you cos you can't really move
S0060	well i mean i would have expect i mean i suffer usually in the heat but it until it have get to that point it have be fine
S0086	okay
S0060	because everywhere's air condition you know as soon as you step in a door or somewhere it's like cold you know so it's only when you're out and about and there be just so much i mean there be so much to do i mean there be only i think there be only one night i mean give that it be em spring break you know so there's load of people there be only night where we have any trouble at all find something to somewhere to stay you know and literally we would we would just drive pick somewhere to go and we would drive there do something during the day and then in the even try and find somewhere to stay i think it as only one night in sort of three weeks where we have any trouble and i think that be the first night down into the quays we end up stay at this really if if we hadn't have be a a group of of youngsters probably piss at the time it be one of the place it's a lot of em like holiday camp you know trailer park kind of place you would never have though to stay there and it be eh but it be hilarious the the two guy that run the place and all this and it be hilarious but eh we be convince that we'd get carbon monoxide poison from the bloom eh the air condition unit that be just go in the room all night sort of thing but eh but no i mean it be really good but i mean the only i always say the only trouble with eh america be the americans but they be in honesty really good
S0086	yeah they be nice i do like them i mean they're all batty as hell i mean even before i be travel with my australian friend cos i meet her when i be in san francisco and we carry on together even before i meet her the australians the americans can't tell the difference between an english and an australian accent so wherever you go ah you're australian no i'm british oh that's so great do you know the queen et cetera et cetera et cetera no i don't know the queen there's actually sixty millions of us you know funnily enough don't know the queen but it be lovely have a really good time and it be the last until last year when i go to croatia and berlin in like a long holiday that be the last sort of big holiday that i'd have i think that's why maybe i've get itchy feet well actually no that's not true i do go to australia just over a year ago for a month okay yeah i be lie which be amaze i get back i be like right that's it i'm move out there not really because it be an amaze place it be lovely and it's pretty and the people be nice and i've get friends there but it's just a really good place to explore that part of the world you know you just feel i don't need to go that far
S0060	i get load load of friend and workmates have go either new zealand australia and just go don't need do come back
S0086	yeah well new zealand be much i think be much prettier and maybe it's more like home you know it's it's really green and luscious which australia isn't but it's pretty none the less but it's just expensive to live there but i suppose it's all relative if you're work ooh be this me thank you so much

S0171	no
S0060	we'll see the new house won't we
S0086	oh have they move
S0171	yeah when we last go up there's em there be an empty plot of land behind my grandparents place and em my mum take us round there to look at this nice bite of land and she say yeah they're do a new house development in there and that she'll be one of the first people to get a house in there
S0086	nice
S0171	and eh she move in what july
S0060	yeah it be back then wannit basically they i mean they live in basically council house and the council obviously build newer house cos the stuff there have be there years and years and years and years and years
S0171	survive the weather of course
S0060	yeah it be very much you know survival style house sort of thing they build a lot of modern house and they've just be you know move them from the old stuff into the new i don't know what they're go to do with the old ones now whether they're go to get rid of them or
S0171	well from what i speak when i when mum be say about when she move out there be already someone move in to her old her old bungalow so but for some reason a lot of people want to live up there there's not a lot of work to do up there but
S0086	i know what do people do
S0171	well
S0086	can you farm be there farm
S0171	there's a bite of farm land up there but you can't do any forestry work up there because orkney be practically bare for threes
S0086	mm i be go to say be there any tree a few
S0171	there's a there's a forest down the road from mum's old place isn't there but that's on private land em but yea apart from that there's absolutely nothing that i've see anyway you might get the odd tree here and there that's kind of be forget about i think they be chop them all down but
S0086	there's very very little i mean i i be say one of the
S0171	there be lo lot of sheep there' a lot of sheep
S0060	i can't i can't imagine what the next generation up there would do if they would not leave
S0171	yeah i don't know what charlie's go to do when she grow up yeah
S0060	you know because there's literally nothing there's not enough people and not enough happen but
S0171	although although the only thing they've get up there be where mark use to work which be my step dad em he use to work on an oil rig that's up there
S0086	right
S0171	and em
S0060	well it's an oil terminal isn't it
S0171	yeah oil terminal yeah and there's a lot of job go on there but only if you can hack the bounce of the little it's just a little dingy boat that they take you out
S0060	basically in between all the islands be the oil terminal where everything come in from all the oil rig
S0086	right
S0060	and eh
S0171	when when you're sail in and out on the on the mainland ferry on the actual ferry you actually go past it and you've always get the you know you know it's there because they they light the flare and em the fire go up and
S0060	obviously the only way to get to it be by boat so there's a tiny little you know literally
S0171	dingy
S0060	dozen man dingy right to get you out there
S0086	and do they have to be base on that
S0060	yeah and there' slot lot of people work on it it's one of the main sort of
S0171	it's the only employee well
S0060	employers yeah
S0171	yeah man employee but otherwise if you're into farm land into farm obviously that again be all private so if you own a farm
S0060	farm farm only take you know only cover employment for a very small compare with the amount of land it take up it's a very small employer isn't it of people
S0171	and then of course there's the people that rely on tourism like and and be the people that we stay with when we go up and they have their own b and b business and obviously they then therefore rely on the tourism that go in up there which there be a lot of tourism up there that's i think that's get to be orkney's main main income
S0060	yeah it must be hard in the winter months you'd have to make enough money in the summer to sort of tide you through i think what they do in the west say like in the winter months we go down to the seaside towns everything be board up
S0171	mm yeah but i mean my mum seem to enjoy it she's work in tesco's there's a tesco's up there she's a check out
S0060	yeah finally
S0171	lady
S0060	there's be a tesco's up there for like a year at most it's there hadn't be one up toil now
S0086	wow it be a nice part of the world my uncle bite of a strange man generally everyone he meet become a firm friend
S0060	yeah
S0086	he's get one of the face everyone want to talk to him and he's sort of the good side of alcoholism you know not far away from the bad side
S0060	right
S0086	and eh he's get a friend call who own s an island in scotland as you do as you do he inherit it from his father and on the island it's off the em paris lewis be it lewis and harris they be islands on the west coast
S0060	harris be not
S0086	harris
S0060	yeah
S0086	so it's you would go i think you'd get the train up to sky you get the train to skye or be skye an island
S0060	skye be an island
S0086	so you get the train up somewhere the you have to go up to skye by boat and then from there you have to go to harris and then from harris
S0060	that's why you call it the isle of skye
S0086	and then from harris that's probably why they call it the isle of skye so it's about one train journey and then i think there's a train over a bridge to and island and then there's a boat from an island to an island and then there's another boat from an island to and island
S0171	oh god
S0086	and what you be say about you know the next generation move away that's what they do as soon as they get old enough they all move away so it's that sort of generation that's be like in their forties and fifties and all they do be they just go toe the pub and get absolutely shit face so it's nice to go and visit it's relay really pretty it's really nice from what i've see haven't be myself bite then i don't know how sustainable it be and what's go to happen to it once that generation die
S0171	mm
S0086	cos they haven't get anything there themselves they have to import everything
S0060	well it's like i be say for me there'd be absolutely nothing for me to do work wise
S0171	no not even
S0060	there's so there's so few people the build that go on there be the very very bare minimum you know there's nothing happen
S0171	even the original roads that they build be still like new there's no pot hole there's no fade of white line be there
S0060	yeah i mean the roads have be there for you know year upon year upon year and it's almost as though they've only just go down cos there's so few people drive on them you know i mean there's what twenty thousand people something like that
S0171	i don't know how many i don't know but it's sort of its small
S0060	it's certainly decline from what it use to be it use to be more people back in eh well back a hundred years there use to be quite a lot of people but it em i think it start decline in sort of the eighties and sort of
S0086	what make your mum live there
S0060	get away from her
S0171	i wouldn't be surprise by that
S0060	em no she be get away from 's dad and although well i well i that's what i think she go up there for she tell me otherwise she tell it's because nana and granddad's accident em cos nan decide that she be go to em drive down to say main road that's rarely use at seventy miles an hour and then pass out
S0086	oh my god
S0171	yeah granddad be fully awake
S0060	sit in the car beside her
S0171	sit in the car next to her and eh thankfully
S0060	can you imagine drive on a road sixty mile and hour you you're a passage and the driver pass out on the
S0086	shit why do she pass out
S0171	we don't know she em it's not a common occurrence for her but she's an old lady now she's you know get push on ninety i think now em and she'd thankfully probably would have do her more damage than anything else and consequently she's still like it but ooh excuse me thankfully she be drive long a particular part of the road that em have road field and then se em and thankfully she manage to when she do pass out em she thankfully manage to plough herself into one of the hay bale that be there in the field otherwise if she if that hay bail be not there she would have end up in the sea
S0060	yeah oh i knock it off yeah thankfully rather than end up in these they get stick in a hay bail
S0171	granddad be absolutely bricking himself
S0086	god someone be watch down on them that day
S0171	mm but no my my nan em even to the day she today she wear a neck brace and her head just crumple like that
S0086	really
S0171	em but em and she's get a real bad ass attitude as well but she em my nana and granddad be of that era same kind of era as 's mum and dad in that once you're marry that's it and em and they've be marry for about fifty years now i think and he and my nan be a right old bitch she's really horrible
S0060	yeah unfortunately your nan where as a people get older or some of them anyway the the sort of wire in their brain start to decay a little bite and she's turn into
S0171	a monster
S0060	a horrible old harridan who absolutely torment your granddad
S0171	the one thing that she be do be shortly after i move up there and obviously shortly after they'd have this accident naturally my nan be talk she's not allow to drive for obvious reason but she do not like this and eh and it be down to my mum em because obviously she couldn't leave it to my granddad cos granddad be just pant for my nan em so she'd take nan's car key em and be keep them to prevent her drive crack idea and mum be the amount of tie that my mum and she my mum never call me i usually end up call her and when i would call her she would be in in in tear and so really upset because my nan my nan would be slag her off something chronic call her all the name under the sun just to get her bloody car key back
S0060	when we first go up there and eh
S0171	nan's always be civilise to us though hasn't she she's be
S0060	yeah but even first time i'd meet them and you hadn't see them for years and your nan be well she wasn't red but she be very much
S0171	oh her own
S0060	couldn't couldn't care whether you be in the room or not kind of thing
S0086	god
S0060	and eh be couldn't get us out of the door fast enough relay could she
S0171	no i mean another example of how nasty my nan be my granddad be lose sight in his eye and em to the point where rather than kind of you know when you turn out of and old fashion television and it do the the line and the dot in the middle it's a bite like that
S0060	yeah he's basically just get sort of his vision be down to like
S0171	a sliver
S0060	a little slither across his vision
S0086	ah bless
S0171	and it's get worse and my nan treat him like a bloody dog
S0086	really
S0171	and a slave yeah make cup of tea i want a cup of tea please where dinner
S0086	he have to make the dinner and he can't even see that must be dangerous poor granddad
S0171	yeah i mean my granddad
S0060	it's even worse cos he use to be em he use to be like a graphic designer so you know everything be with his eye and he do well he still do but he use to be you know do a lot of photography and things like that so obviously a lot of what be his life be obviously virtually go
S0086	yeah
S0060	so but it's very hard i mean up there they're very isolate anyway aren't they i know they've get their friends around there but you know they're two old people you know and it's not easy for them to get around at the best of time you know so i it's a very the weather up there be never very good
S0086	right
S0060	so i mean for me i would always you know you get you know you're isolate already cos of your age and your frailty and if it's always bad weather or it always seem like it's bad weather and you know it must get quite depress for them i would of think i mean when we go when we first go up there foolishly i go first in january and it be so cold i mean it there be a constant gale blow across the way wasn't there always i mean i be i be in like eh like three or four layer and then like a great big coat over the top woolly hat and a scarf around like this and i be still cold when i be out in the wind wasn't i and we've get photos what i don't think i've cop them they must be on the old computer but eh there's photos where i'm i'm out take photos of things there's photos from like frame by the car window where hannah's take it of me from within the car with the engine run to keep warm she's like i'm not go out there
S0171	i'm not up for
S0060	we go to eh skara brae didn't we and you stay in the car cos it be too cold
S0086	fair enough it do seem like a crazy time of year to go be that your idea
S0171	usually be my idea
S0060	we even go we go back no when we go back for your mum's wed in june
S0171	yeah
S0060	that be alright wannit it be quite nice it be a little bite windy but it be quite nice
S0171	it be better

S0086	mm it's not somewhere i would definitely think of as a holiday destination unless i have family there
S0060	ah but it's beautiful
S0086	i'm sure it be yeah
S0060	but the weather i mean it be just batter off the north sea
S0086	i'd quite like it if we could invent teleportation
S0060	to go for a visit and then
S0086	to go for a visit cos i'm sure it be beautiful but i wouldn't want to waste my week holiday somewhere where i wouldn't be warm not that i'm a sunflower anymore i use to be but just to know that it's worse weather there than it be here it
S0060	that's the thing so far you don't really know what's it like till you get there
S0086	it's like the jungle i'd like to go to the jungle just to have look around yeah it's fuck scary
S0060	back back to the normal world yeah
S0060	but eh but no i mean it's a really lovely place i mean we're very lucky we find it's a bed and well bed and breakfast for want of a better expression but really they they sort of treat you like you're part of the family you know it's a lovely lovely place
S0086	that's nice
S0171	and they've just add a jacuzzi for sprig this year just in time for us to go up
S0086	yey
S0060	an outdoor jacuzzi you can't really see it work but
S0086	i suppose well they have them in sweden don't they
S0060	yeah that's true but they also flog themselves with birch and jump into icy pool
S0086	yeah don't do that that's dreadful have you not see the muppets swedish chef yeah i don't know how i'm go to last till the end of the year for a holiday i do it two years ago when i go to australia and everyone be go off on a sunny holiday for the summer and be the only to be here
S0060	well we we've not really i mean we we do we go on a few holiday in the uk we go to centre park and we do a few different and we already tell you we get to have our honeymoon abroad so you get a so that's a good point actually we need do get some quiet sort of scotland time so that you can get use to the idea i remember you say you'd speak to the doctor about get somewhat it's call
S0171	valium
S0060	valium that's it
S0086	sledgehammer to the brain knock you out what you might find be it's more of the idea of it once you combat the idea you'll be alright like it be literally just tell yourself this be safer than cross the road and how many time do you cross the road
S0171	mm
S0086	do you play the lottery oh
S0060	you're more likely to win the lottery than die in a plane
S0171	mm
S0060	so if you win the lottery the day before you fly maybe think again
S0086	yeah maybe walk pass that part get the car
S0060	but no
S0086	it be really funny actually my my friend be say to me the other day you've get the same chance of walk up to a stranger in the street and guess their house number than you do of win the lottery cos it's that it's the same sort of add isn't it get a a series of number you don't you'd have better odds of guess someone's house number cos there be two
S0060	you probably have yeah cos there be only go to be
S0086	well maybe three but you know it's not like the stake where it's like five number
S0060	yeah no its i mean i've not do the lottery for years but i remember when i first start work we have a syndicate at work and for a year it be only the saturday lottery then and for a solidly for a year there be i think it be like eight of us do it we use to pay into the syndicate and we use to have two ticket each and it be every saturday for a year and i don't think even win a tenner
S0086	really
S0060	in all that time you know we it would've be better to just keep the money in our pocket type of thing
S0171	part from those bus drivers of course
S0086	do you hear there's a guy guy in the state i think it be
S0171	no no this be uk last
S0086	that he didn't he didn't tell them be it the uk he didn't tell them that he he be the one who cash in the syndicate he go and buy the ticket and they win and i'm sure this be in the state
S0171	no no this be a different story
S0060	no okay go on then you tell the story that you're go to tell
S0171	there be a bunch of bus drivers who have they have do the same thing they be buy lottery ticket together and they win the euro millions
S0086	how much do they win
S0171	twenty four million
S0086	shit how many bus drivers
S0171	i think there be eleven
S0086	ah nice
S0060	it's like two million each that be
S0086	ah that's better than a poke in the eye
S0171	mm so they all quite their job naturally so we have even less bus drivers i don't know if they be base or if they be just stagecoach base eh
S0060	cos at em now i know that's not the same story it probably be the state cos i remember it be the state
S0171	yeah more than likely
S0060	one of the guy he use to go buy the ticket and all this and eh they win and he didn't tell them he tell them that they didn't win and eh a week later now he go off say he go off say he be unwell or have an injury that he couldn't work and two weeks later then say oh he'd win it himself em and the next lottery
S0086	suspicious
S0060	and give up work and everything but obviously they find out he's be do for fraud i think they be say or something like that yeah but it be eh fourteen million dollars or something like that he be eh try to heap it all for himself
S0086	bloody human
S0060	yeah they're terrible
S0086	fourteen million that'd be nice
S0060	yeah anything anything with that many noughts on it would be nice

S0086	spider baby in the
S0060	hoard of them like arm
S0171	exactly like even when it be at even when it be at regency it would be lock
S0060	there's so many that it's actually a spider power bike
S0171	i'm not surprise
S0060	the pedal go round on their own
S0171	no but we use to have it lock up form a chain that be dangle down from the ceiling of our car port and it would be tie up lock up there and every single time i get on it i would check underneath the saddle to make sure there wasn't anything live in it there's nothing quite like cycle along with your bum hang out for a spider to just go plup
S0060	this image of a spider crawl climb into your crotch
S0171	it can happen
S0060	why why would a spider do that when have you ever read one the news about this accident cause by a spider
S0171	what look you think you think you think there's kind of like prejudice against what's a butt crack and what's a crack in the floor
S0060	very much so
S0171	no anyway spiders be actually attract to heat dispute what you say
S0060	alright alright
S0171	that's why they eat you when you're asleep
S0060	eat you you eat them
S0171	don't give a shit that's why i have nightmares i have bad dream about them and i have bad dream about wasps weird cos i don't i don't i never remember it but apparently i'll know about it in the morning cos he'll sort of say to me actually you ask me that this morning and i didn't ask do i he he usually say to me
S0060	you have a bad dream last night cos she'll literally just sit up in bed and just scream ah literally
S0086	quite for you like
S0060	when it be when she first do it i be like shit what's go on but now i'm so use to it that literally
S0171	just sit up grab me
S0060	i'll sit up go like that and just lay back down and within a couple of minutes she's calm down and fall back yeah she doesn't really wake up you know she's not awake awake and literally i'll lay lay back down with hold her like this it's fine it's fine it's fine like you
S0171	do i have a bad dream last night then
S0060	no
S0171	oh
S0060	i can remember you wake up one night scream i go what's wrong what's wrong and you say oh em there's a spider there's a spider i say where she say oh i saw it i saw it it's pitch black how can you see it oh yeah
S0171	apparently that's exactly what i do
S0060	literally straight back to sleep when she be like oh yeah there can't have be one asleep
S0086	do you remember it do you think you be fully awake for it
S0171	no i don't remember any of them i don't remember any of them sometimes if you're sometimes you'll remind me and it's the dream itself that i remember not the scream and wake up but that i remember i remember that i usually just remember the nightmare
S0060	cos sometimes you you burst out laugh in your sleep or your you'll say a word there' be time where i've kind of be i've sort of wake up and go be we talk or be we have a conversation i've fall asleep or something you know i you know it's weird but eh
S0086	don't think i've ever say anything apparently i make a noise i make a noise like
S0171	that's what he do
S0086	which mean i'm probably think about food
S0060	food yeah
S0171	yeah you do that
S0060	i think it's cos i end up with a dry mouth
S0171	and it's really annoy cos i get really quite but most of the time if i'm already asleep i'll sleep through it and i never hear it but if i'm like i've be sick i've not be very well so it's take me an awful long time to go to sleep in the first place and the second he start make that noise it's like i'm shoot i'm never go to go to fluking sleep with him make that stupid noise and eh and other time i mean recently i've actually wake up in the middle of the night with you make that noise and usually i don't wake up when you make that noise
S0060	normally yes
S0171	usually i i beat him
S0060	wake up
S0171	or it's roll over or shut up
S0060	you're you're the worst in the morning if you've leave your alarm on on like a saturday or a sunday your alarm will make me up it won't wake you up and i'll be leave there go turn it off turn it off and then i'll roll over you and like knee to the back you're awake now oh the alarm's go off
S0171	no cos most of the time it doesn't even work the amount of time that he's be prod me for quite some time he's like
S0086	really
S0060	she's so annoy
S0171	switch it up
S0060	if i've stay up and she's already go to bed and she'll be asleep when i come up she more often than not will wake up when i come in the room to go to bed but if i'm try to get her awake in the morning she just sort of
S0086	you must be a deep sleeper
S0171	yeah i think i do yeah i mean but at the moment i'm alright i've get a new phone it's a different tone it's different alarm i've get two different alarm on it
S0060	you've get two but one of them i can't remember which one it be but more often than not of late you've not it's not wake you up you've just carry on lay there and i'm go turn it off turn it off i'm go bad turn it off
S0171	that's probably the first alarm that'll be the first alarm cos there's on that go off at six forty and then there's another one that go off at six fifty and i think it's the six fifty that await for
S0060	no i have i must admit if i'm honest i can pretty much sleep anywhere any time on anything
S0171	do anything
S0086	so be you already up by then i think you leave really early
S0060	at the minute no i've i've be do much more eh
S0171	reasonable hours
S0060	yeah reasonable hours of late apart from the odd time when i'm have to get out the door at sort of five in the morning or something but
S0086	god
S0060	if i be do normal work that i do i probably have to leave about six i suppose but at the minute i'm usually sort of seven to half past seven get to work eight just after eight something like that but eh yeah cos where i'm do em you know like development job so it's all offices and meet and visit and things so it's a lot more flexible hours so you know i'll probably only do right till three or something like that and bigger off you know rather than seven till seven
