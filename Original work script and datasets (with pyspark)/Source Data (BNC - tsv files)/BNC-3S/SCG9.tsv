S0653	so i've just tell you about some of the plot for the new story i'm write erm and yeah so this man the bite that's relevant be the man in a sweet shop that's for adults only be secretly use hamster poo
S0655	yeah
S0653	and it's actually make everybody ill but he's try to frame people that work in the circus now what be your question no what you have something to say didn't you have something to say
S0654	yeah yeah mum after they like blow their cover
S0653	yeah
S0654	then
S0653	oh they'll try and dispose of the evidence won't they
S0654	no like say they could they could still make you if they could like hide it but still make it in a different product
S0653	they might do
S0654	and like and like say oh look if they didn't get sick they must have do it let's get them
S0653	yep so he he's obviously try to put the blame on somewhere else but yeah the kid that be investigate it have get to keep a sample and prove that it's get hamster poo or guinea pig poo or whatever it in it erm and yeah so that's that's as far as i've get to in my think of it you have a question
S0655	if you get if you get the book er publish then
S0653	yes
S0655	why can't i illustrate it
S0653	because erm publish but do you not hear what they say in author's panel yesterday anyway erm but i know this basically publish house have publish erm author and they also have illustrators so they will decide who be go to illustrate the book i don't i won't have a say over it
S0655	what if you want to illustrate it yourself and then actually give the job to me
S0653	well i'd they've have they still have to like the illustrations so you could still you could you know do them and they could see if they like them
S0655	yay
S0653	but as i say if they didn't i mean in the imaginary world of me actually write it and finish it and send it and get publish if you if they didn't like them you could still do stuff for the website cos helen moss have get lot of stuff i be i be mean to say to you the other day we should look on the helen moss website cos there's actually load of stuff for fan on there and i think there's
S0655	be there game
S0653	i think i don't know but there's definitely other stories that fan have write and all that kind of stuff so it'll be worth you go on there
S0655	but anyway i'll try the illustrations
S0653	yeah
S0655	although
S0653	so
S0655	someone else can do the front cover
S0653	okay so i'm just
S0655	i could do the sweet shop on the front cover actually
S0653	oh my goodness stop interrupt me so
S0655	mm
S0653	yes so that's what i've get to so far in my plan so there be some other things that need to happen and obviously one of the character ashad or whatever his name be when i rename him you know his dad be
S0654	how about tony
S0655	michael
S0653	no it's get to be an asian name cos it's go to be like ashad
S0655	really
S0653	and it's important for there for there to be asian character in stories so that people feel that they be include in stories
S0654	so like they think their mum be kind of erm a bite crazy but they actually think or they actually find er they own the best mum in the world and like when the circus
S0653	slow down
S0654	come to town
S0653	sorry when the circus come down
S0654	yeah but she didn't have the one thing cos they
S0653	can hang on i can't understand anything you're say
S0654	she doesn't tell them she doesn't tell them one thing cos she think they're bore circus
S0653	she do get that chip off your head
S0653	she doesn't tell them one thing what do you mean
S0654	erm like the family
S0653	that they don't know she do the hoop do you mean
S0654	yeah
S0653	yeah well i i think they're kind of they kind of think she's quite cool but they're not really they're just use to her be as she be so they don't know that she be in the circus erm but they're kind of not really surprise and the ashad character like really like their mum and think she's really really cool but teejay and katy really like ashad's mum and she's go to be base on my er student sumi and she's like really quiet and lovely and keep the house really clean and bake for them all the time and teejay and katy kind of think oh that would be really cool to have a mum like that i mean they do like their mum but erm yeah
S0655	the grass be always greener on the other side
S0653	exactly but sumi ashad's mum be a little bite kind of take aback by teejay and katy's mum so whenever they see whenever they meet each other you know katy and teejay's mum be always do something crazy and sumi just think oh my goodness me what be this lady do so one thing that i do know be that the woman the wife of the nasty man that own the sweet shop just for adults and be sell stuff with hamster poo in it
S0654	erm
S0653	she be go to er actually train to do the aerial hoop in secret and then she's gonna leave him and run off to the circus at the end of the book
S0655	mm
S0654	yeah but maybe erm find out
S0653	can you
S0654	what she want to do and then go oh i know i know i can teach you
S0653	yes she's gonna teach her
S0654	and erm
S0653	can you stop use your hand because you've get a perfectly good fork and knife thank you yes so she the mum be gonna teach her how to do the aerial hoop and she's gonna be like a quite a big lady like a large lady who do no no not finger erm but she's still gonna do erm a hoop performance in the grand finale before the circus leave town which think'll be quite cool and she's gonna wear like a big pink dress that look a bite like a blancmange and look a bite
S0654	what's a blancmange
S0653	a sort of wibbly wobbly dessert so any suggestions of other bits of the plot would be useful
S0655	erm
S0654	i
S0655	it could be that the man erm i mean the owner of the sweet shop
S0653	uhu
S0655	try to like get rid of his wife well not kill her but like erm
S0653	mm he might do
S0655	maybe just
S0654	mm get erm
S0655	i don't know
S0654	erm i think
S0653	stop use your hand
S0655	erm
S0653	yes
S0653	get your hand away
S0655	cos she might report him to the police
S0653	mm
S0655	and
S0653	i don't think he's i don't think he's nasty nasty nasty like that yes be what be it
S0654	erm maybe he could like think wait erm if she's er really she could run off and tell the children cos he be in his sweet shop
S0653	i don't think he think she will tell but i don't think they're very happy and what's gonna happen be he's go to get eventually find out cos the kid be go to reveal everything and everyone's gonna say sorry to the circus for be mean to the so they're gonna like do it in an exclusive newspaper article so that mean that ashad's dad will still have a job cos he's get like an exclusive er scoop for that and then he's gonna end stop use your hand use your fork and knife then erm the man be gonna end up in prison in jail for you know illegally use hamster poo however a bite at the end of the story will be that another company decide erm that actually it's get load of health properties and that it be the way that he be treat it that he should have do something to them i dunno like bake them or something erm and then all the bad stuff go so there some some company be go to go and sell hamster poo chocolate and charge a fortune for it erm and with all these health properties and so he could have in fact have become very rich if he'd do it properly instead of an underhand sneaky way and i think that's quite a good kind of revenge thing on him that he if only he'd do it in a a sensible good way rather than deceive everybody i can see you're use your finger and i would like you to stop that cos that's why you get ill quite a lot isn't it
S0655	when you er say stop use your finger use your fork
S0653	yes
S0655	it sound like this stop use your finger use your fork
S0653	yes i be do a robotic voice
S0654	i'm mm
S0653	and
S0655	no you weren't
S0654	no
S0653	yes i be
S0654	welcome to king's cross station
S0653	stop use your finger use your fork and the other thing
S0655	welcome to king's cross station
S0653	that that he want to do but then he didn't get round to do be that he be plan on erm use slug in jelly
S0655	oh
S0653	little jelly sweets that sort of thing so that shop end up close down and it could be that if we do another story then that's shop could open as something else and that could be another story
S0654	yeah but erm eventually
S0653	yeah
S0654	the could be a shop
S0655	and it and it's about
S0653	hang on don't talk over what
S0654	but maybe there could eventually become a shop which just sell antique
S0653	no cos there's an antique shop next door
S0654	i know but erm
S0653	run by the annoy man
S0654	the antique actually like they never never never never break so it
S0653	what
S0654	you know how antique be really fragile
S0653	yeah some of them be
S0654	and that can like be they can maybe out of plastic and like and
S0653	well no cos
S0654	everybody start to like that one cos they're really cool and they
S0653	oh a rival
S0654	and they want to overthrow that one
S0653	mm
S0654	but then erm the only reason which happen be you have to say i like antique shop next door because everybody really like you and if and and if that happen you could get end up with a dodgy boyfriend but obviously it would be okay cos you like that man
S0653	well i like that i like there be a rival and then they have to come to the rescue
S0654	and then then that
S0653	i mean you can't get plastic as antique but perhaps they sell fake antique
S0654	yeah
S0653	you know or they're take er they're they're make people sell their antique for not much money whereas actually they're worth a lot of stuff so it could be like a wheeler dealer that someone that sell that buy stuff that could be a good idea
S0654	mm
S0653	for another story and as you say the man that run the antique shop he's not like he you know he's quite nice he's nice he just he just shouldn't fancy their mum cos they're just not very compatible stop
S0654	oh
S0653	use your finger
S0654	mm mm
S0653	if i see you use them again i will take your food away from you and you will have to go hungry okay
S0654	yeah
S0653	so erm yeah so there might be some stuff that happen in school
S0654	mm
S0653	oh and yeah so some of that's why some of the kid be sick cos some of them be kind of pilfer their parents' sweets cos they want to try them and they taste disgust it's just that adults think that you know oh it's a special adult thing so they kind of pretend that they like them and then there's one grandma that always like let her kid eat whatever she like and let her get away with stuff and she buy them for her and that's where she get it all and she's really mean erm she's not a very nice kid so
S0655	oh we could do it that that girl be the next door neighbour and in the second or third book
S0653	mm
S0655	wait let's say there's a like really old next door neighbour and when they move out they like to see their family more
S0653	mm
S0655	cos they're quite old and they can't really do many visit
S0653	uhu
S0655	and then she move in like to get closer to get like further way from school so he she have an excuse of be late instead of what instead of say oh my tv show be very long and then she be like really annoy and always catapult her dog's poo over the fence
S0653	well that be our other story that we have wasn't it
S0654	yeah the drop
S0655	yeah but we haven't make it yet
S0654	we be drop pot of
S0653	i know
S0654	erm what's their name what shall we do there oh
S0653	we could
S0655	we
S0653	we could combine
S0655	great idea
S0653	that story with the we could combine that story with the other one perhaps
S0655	yeah and then and then i make a little erm
S0653	don't use your finger
S0654	catapult for and then she shoot some with the and then
S0653	it's not it's teejay and katy
S0655	er yeah and then i make a little catapult for katy and she have a pillow on her back and when she land she take the pillow off and chuck it down with the and then chuck it over with a stone i mean the just chuck it over and then i know she's okay
S0653	uhu
S0655	and then she and like put the catapult so that it when she do it it fling into a window
S0653	mm
S0655	and then i and the windows and then she open the window
S0653	uhu
S0655	and then both and then pull a face at the girl
S0655	and then she go back and keep sort of jump up in the and say
S0655	and then she shoot the catapult and it land in her in her room house and then the dog go yap yap yap yap yap to try and get the poo back as
S0653	we could well maybe
S0653	but in that story that we do
S0655	bad
S0653	the sister be much younger cos you be go to be a you know teejay's gonna be like eleven
S0655	twelve
S0653	and and katy's go to be nine so you're they be only gonna be a little bite older than you guy
S0654	erm yeah
S0653	yeah
S0655	it would be it would be cool er if i be like twelve and be something like three but i just
S0653	but if you want
S0655	bring her up so i just bring her up so well cos you bring me up well i kind of learn on my own in that book so teejay would have bring katy up so well
S0654	mm
S0655	so well that she could like walk and be a very fluent talker and then she be like this ah and then pretend to be a baby when she be around everyone and pretend she couldn't talk
S0653	oh that's a nice idea
S0655	and then she would be like this na du ba and then everybody think she be really cute and then she be like this be really well
S0653	can you speak that not whisper it
S0655	and then she go and then she whisper to me this be go really well
S0653	mm
S0655	people won't suspect me if i do anything
S0653	that would be a good different story yes for sure
S0655	yeah
S0653	i like that
S0655	but she pretend she's like that to load of people but only
S0653	and then she can get away with stuff
S0655	yeah
S0653	i like it
S0655	and that's exactly how me and get the sweets from the shop she call in go doba da and then the man
S0653	well no nobody's go into a sweet shop for that one or be this a different story now
S0654	erm
S0655	erm or she could just go into sweet shop and then go do go ba and then
S0655	or
S0655	and then she and then she make them erm cry to the downstairs while the man be still wait for someone to go in cos he be erm look over and then she just crawl in

S0655	and then she
S0655	go and when someone's go out of the sweet shop she get out and go go gu ba

S0653	yeah it's
S0654	why
S0653	good to for you guy to know about that
S0655	it's funny that she be like and there's actually and i didn't know that until i find out there's actually a book that tell you exactly how to write a story
S0653	it do i mean it's it it be a really good book a really interest book and it go through classic stories and film like style i mean that be what george lucas who write star war he do use that book the hero with a thousand face to base the the the plot and it's very successful that plot isn't it star war
S0655	uhu
S0653	mm
S0654	erm luke skywalker be like dorothy
S0653	like the the wizard of oz indeed and lot and lot and lot of really good film and stories be base on that key plot structure
S0655	be maleficent on it
S0653	i would imagine so cos that's a very good story isn't it
S0655	be your story base on it
S0653	well i've always know about the joseph campbell thing what i'm gonna do be i'm gonna plan out my story and then i will check against the hero with a thousand face hero structure to see if it kind of roughly follow it i think that will make it successful
S0654	mm
S0653	uhu
S0654	can i ask a question mum
S0653	mm
S0654	erm the bite where helen be answer my they ask for my quench my question in that room that be my best bite
S0653	that be great so that be a panel of author wasn't it
S0654	yeah
S0653	talk about their write process
S0654	yeah it's like erm from
S0653	and what be your question
S0654	what do it feel like when your book get publish
S0653	mm and it be nice that for her to check what you mean
S0654	yeah
S0653	by ask you and it be it be interest wasn't it
S0654	and she be like erm where's and i and we're like me and everyone be like
S0653	and also helen although she didn't didn't get time to read out 's question she say that it be a very good question that you have as well
S0655	uhu and i if i ever get a chance i will ask the author that question
S0653	mm
S0655	what be the question again
S0653	yours
S0655	yeah
S0653	out of the book they've write which be their favourite
S0655	oh yeah
S0653	which be a good question but always a hard one erm
S0655	yeah
S0653	but 's it be
S0655	what's the favourite book they've write
S0653	sorry
S0655	yeah what's the favourite book they've write
S0653	mm
S0655	ever
S0653	but 's question be interest because many of them say that when they first find out they be get publish they be really excite and then lot of them say there be such a long time to wait
S0655	isn't it a year and a half
S0653	yeah a year and a half two years some of them that they be actually quite nervous i think hilton pashley who get to see his book be produce in the factory i think that be really cool to see that erm and to touch a book that be still warm literally hot off the press that's what that phrase mean of your own book that's very very cool he only live in you know they're all local author all of those people but i've er i've never meet him before i've have this book for age erm and when we go last to cathedral his book be in the cathedral and erm i tweet him last night say oh look there be your book which i forget to bring to get sign and it's a hardback one and he say oh wow they're actually quite rare those hardbacks cos not very many of them be make and i get that when i be work at so that's pretty cool isn't it
S0655	yeah hardbacks be annoyingly more expensive than paperbacks
S0653	they're a lot more expensive
S0655	mm
S0653	i don't really know why people bother to have things in hardback any more i think it must've be
S0655	it's cos it's
S0653	important originally but er it's a bite pointless now isn't it
S0655	yeah
S0654	yeah
S0653	cos you know why
S0655	it only make them
S0655	like waterproof but
S0653	no it's not different it's just literally get a hard back and a
S0655	mm
S0653	a wraparound cover they don't tend to do it for every book now they'll only do it for the really successful ones like harry potter
S0654	like diary of a wimpy kid
S0655	and diary of a wimpy kid
S0653	mm yeah
S0654	cos erm like it's
S0655	i have two hardbacks
S0653	yeah
S0653	well and that's what why they do it i think cos they know
S0655	oh yeah
S0653	that you you can't wait you know you're gonna have to get hardback because you you don't want to wait for the paperback to come out but then it usually mean and this be what i have with my harry potter be that four of them be paperback and three of them be hardback and it's really annoy isn't it cos you think i want a whole row of either paperbacks or hardbacks so people end up buy a whole nother set of of book just so that they they all match but most of my the series of book i've get there's always at least one that's hardback which be kind of annoy isn't it cos then they don't match but yeah but you've get the same thing with diary of a wimpy kid
S0655	yeah two hardbacks every single one that's be out i have
S0653	yeah
S0655	it start off as a at the dance fair where i get diary of a when i get the first one and then i read it
S0653	where where
S0655	erm at my dance thing erm the a fair
S0653	oh right
S0655	yeah and
S0653	be that what happen
S0655	yeah and then i read it and i really like it so
