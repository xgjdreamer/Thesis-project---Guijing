S0653	good grief
S0655	that be very funny
S0653	i beg your pardon
S0655	i say that be quite funny or in the correct
S0653	you're gonna have to go to bed early tonight alright
S0655	let me just feel crazy
S0653	you're really over tire because it's the first week back after easter and you need your sleep and you obviously haven't have enough
S0655	guess could go to bed early as well
S0653	doesn't need to go to bed early
S0655	now that be not fair
S0653	it be fair cos she doesn't need as much sleep as you
S0655	she always sneakily read so there's no point
S0653	well that's fine you just shut your door and can read and you can go to sleep
S0655	shut your door and shut your face what it's a song
S0653	that you've make up
S0655	yes
S0653	it's not really appropriate though be it
S0653	oh so they've be do some in depth analysis into the loch ness erm and they do find something that look like the loch ness monster but it
S0653	well it turn out a film be do quite a long time ago erm use er it be an arthur hang on a sherlock holmes an arthur conan doyle story erm which feature the loch ness monster so there be a sort of robotic model of the lock ness monster which they use on in the loch ness and then it sink so that's what they have discover but they have find so far sink boat oh and there be a man that try to do the fastest journey across water and then crash i think he be kill erm and so they find the thing that he be use on there
S0654	what be it
S0653	some sort of
S0655	a jeep
S0653	i don't know what it be
S0653	cos it must have be very fast jet engine something
S0655	a jeep
S0653	but they often no not a jeep
S0653	on the water because it would sink wouldn't it
S0655	a jeep on wheel
S0653	right cos jeeps don't have wheel normally
S0655	no
S0653	i think they do but they be often try to say about the loch ness that there be sort of hide cave with the loch ness monster sort of hide away but erm they haven't find anything like that yet
S0654	i believe in the loch ness
S0653	well the thing be i just think it's a bite sad to be analyse it like that
S0654	yeah
S0653	cos the story have be there for a long time it's sort of a mythical thing isn't it so it's a bite bore for everyone to go oh no we haven't find it because maybe there be a monster and maybe he go away or maybe he die
S0654	or maybe to protect them
S0653	yeah
S0655	like saint george and the dragon there might have be a beast that protect them like from other dinosaurs that want to stop on the place
S0655	what
S0655	if it be on the
S0655	and t rex would go hotdogs
S0655	or even better hotdog shop with a big hotdog on top
S0655	even though it's not real i'm gonna eat it and the t rex would go

S0653	mm
S0655	erm from other dinosaurs that want to stop on them
S0653	well not dinosaurs
S0653	cos this be when people be around
S0655	and then
S0655	the t rex would go to a hotdog shop
S0655	and see a giant and see a big model of a hotdog on top of it
S0655	and then he would
S0653	i'm just try to see if i can find a a news article about it i don't think i can
S0655	and then
S0654	about what
S0655	he would
S0653	about the loch ness
S0655	try to pick it up pick it up drop it and go no erm there's a there's a lovely hotdog i'm try to eat there's a hotdog i'm try to eat
