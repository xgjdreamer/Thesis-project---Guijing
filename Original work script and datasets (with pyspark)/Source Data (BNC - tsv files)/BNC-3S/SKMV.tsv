S0262	anyway here we go cheer
S0261	alright cheer
S0298	mm
S0262	chin chin
S0261	nice to go to a good film that we could actually all sit through
S0298	yeah yeah
S0262	and not complain
S0298	do you cry in the end
S0262	no
S0298	okay that's unusual
S0262	no
S0298	you have a very low cry threshold normally
S0262	yeah but i've have some
S0261	it wasn't a cryable film though
S0298	yeah
S0261	didn't think there wasn't a lot of emotion in it
S0261	no
S0262	i kind of know she wasn't
S0298	even the suicide be er
S0262	yeah that be so undramatic
S0298	i think it be
S0262	i love it
S0298	i think it be quite fun though
S0261	it be fun but it be actually well do
S0262	yeah
S0261	he's just like i've have enough i'm gonna jump out the window
S0262	yeah
S0298	yeah yeah
S0262	it be brilliant actually the way it be do
S0298	yeah
S0262	i like it but no i find i mean i find that yeah she wasn't i didn't think for one moment she be actually go to become a nun
S0298	yeah
S0262	so that be the thing be that i think oh she's just go to have to
S0298	she's far too pretty to become a nun
S0262	yeah it's unbelievable really she have a child she could have just become her aunt
S0298	yeah
S0262	she could have just move into the aunt's place
S0298	yeah
S0262	and become some sort of you know
S0261	of course she could have just live her life
S0262	but the but god win through
S0298	yeah
S0261	she just want to come out for a peek before she kind of sign up
S0262	well i think it be i think if that be if that's true that's a good idea that if you're if you're bring up in a in you know
S0261	it's a test
S0262	that they actually
S0298	oh and she i mean from what i understand she she be bring up in a convent
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah that's right mm
S0262	but the fact be they say to them you can go away and come back
S0298	yeah
S0262	you need to go and test yourself before you really take your vow i think that's a great idea
S0298	yeah of course
S0262	i didn't really know that they do that but it be a good film it's actually nice to see something which be professionally shoot
S0298	i mean i really i really like the photography in that
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0298	because it be just it be really nice
S0262	mm
S0298	and they tap over the slightly er slower bits i mean the film wasn't particularly fast either but it be a because it be just like so nicely shoot and so calm and reasonable
S0262	yeah it be it be quite meditative yeah
S0298	yeah you be just like sit there and you know chill
S0262	yeah they're quite nice still actually when we come out there be like three really nice still from the film
S0298	yes yes
S0262	you be say that one under the arch when they be the jazz erm player
S0261	yeah when she be talk with the jazz player yeah mm mm and they put some nice jazz into it and carry a good story
S0262	funny that they have to put the subtitle up at the top
S0298	yeah
S0261	i think that be that be just it be
S0298	i think it be even better if er once they drive back to er if she end up in a in a ditch again with the same policeman
S0262	yeah if she'd learn to drive somehow yeah
S0262	yeah that would be funny get the horse to pull the car out of the ditch it's just unbelievable
S0298	no i mean this be like what like nineteen seventies nineteen eighties er poland
S0262	ah even when i be there when i be drive on their well their main roads not the motorways well kind of like a motorway it's a main road
S0298	yeah
S0262	and erm you know there'd there'd be one lane and there would be four different set of traffic in your lane
S0298	yeah
S0262	and you'd be overtake some slow car and the slow car be overtake somebody on a bike and the person on a bike be overtake a horse and cart
S0298	yeah mm
S0262	and then you'd have bmws and mercedes
S0298	yeah
S0262	overtake my car which would i have a hire car i can't remember what it be
S0298	yeah
S0262	just like four set of traffic overtake each other in one lane
S0298	yeah yeah
S0262	and then you'd find that the erm the rut
S0298	mm mm
S0262	in the roads be so bad
S0298	yeah
S0262	that it's uncomfortable drive unless you know you're drive off the rut but drive in the rut be it's just
S0298	yeah yeah my parent be there in eighty five i think cos my father be from erm and he
S0262	your dad
S0298	yeah well he he can't remember it he be like three years old when when when they flee but er cos they the russians be come
S0262	yeah
S0298	but some of the his relatives stay there erm er but they didn't get much er contact with them only sort of occasionally sort of letter and they be still speak german there but they're and they several of them come to my grandparents' golden wed anniversary er but not as a couple although the children have to stay behind to make sure that they go back
S0298	i i'm not kid you
S0262	yeah yeah no i know i know but they do they have to use them as collateral yeah
S0298	yeah so
S0262	but its it's yeah it's funny that that's the way it's do so
S0298	so and then my parent and my uncle go there a couple of time
S0262	yeah
S0298	er and that must have be sort of eighty five eight six or something like that
S0262	yeah wow
S0298	and er i'm not sure they still have photos from there be i remember see the photos and it be very much like like the film
S0262	like that yeah yeah yeah some of the hotels i go to
S0298	and when i go in eighty nine it be still very much like that
S0262	yeah like that hotel they be stay in just not that dissimilar from the hotel i stay in
S0298	oh no we stay in really nice hotel but i mean we have er german mark right so er the hotel we stay in in er in be really nice it be like some old grand hotel kind of thing and
S0262	yeah yeah
S0298	mm get a couple of bottle of vodka for er for fifty p and er
S0261	yeah and you'd be away
S0298	yeah
S0261	and that's it a couple of bottle of vodka and cigarettes be a quarter of the price of the bottle of vodka
S0262	two great cities
S0298	i know we go into bar and we go to like a really nice restaurant i think we pay like one mark
S0262	really
S0298	and the the toilet lady because i the toilet lady you have to give them a tip and none of us have have right so i sort of throw one mark at her thing and er she be overvalue because it be like a month's salary on the black market
S0261	wow
S0298	it be
S0261	wow
S0298	pretty pretty extreme
S0262	yes yeah so erm but the pole whocame here but then they go back be that be that what happen
S0298	sorry
S0262	the pole who come over to england
S0298	yeah yeah
S0262	be think that they be go to find what a job paradise be then
S0261	gold
S0262	and then and then er apparently they they just think it be shit and they've move back
S0298	yeah a lot of them move back yeah
S0261	but what's the real reason do you think it's just that the economy get better in poland
S0298	yeah mm and when they have an opportunity here they earn some money they be work quite hard and
S0261	they get what they need and go home
S0298	i mean poland isn't poland isn't a a bad place to live either so er i think a lot of them when they be here they be work very hard and er certainly like the sort of trade be better than the er the english counterparts in most case and they work harder and more and probably earn more money and then yeah go back right
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	yeah
S0298	i suppose they have you know enough money to like build a house or whatever so
S0262	yeah
S0261	have the erm have the economy kind of european economy change so it's that a lot of work get outsource to poland or
S0298	dunno
S0261	i've hear of it kind of be like romania and bulgaria and that kind of thing no
S0298	no and it it's not
S0261	it's not something you've hear of
S0298	it's not really i mean poland be poland be still very much
S0261	what i know be that some
S0298	er i mean it i mean it's a a very large country so it's it's i think the second largest in area size after
S0261	germany
S0298	er france
S0261	after france okay
S0298	yeah er but it's agriculturally it's bigger than france and france be be actually a very agricultural country
S0261	yes mm
S0298	er but you know i think in the cities there be job and stuff so we
S0298	they're they're not like a you know so it's not like sort of i don't think poland ever be a a sort of a er a cheap labour kind of country unlike erm
S0261	romania or bulgaria or somewhere like that
S0298	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0261	okay
S0298	so
S0261	but it but i've hear that there's
S0298	because they be always they be always quite you know civilise well well educate and er so yeah
S0261	no yeah of course of course erm
S0298	and relatively rich compare to say bulgaria or hungaria like even in in er in soviet time
S0261	so there's a big scale difference even in in between those countries
S0298	yeah i mean in in poland okay you have to queue i mean when my parent be there which be before the with with you have to sometimes you have to queue for like three hours to get a loaf of bread or something like that right
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	mm
S0298	er coffee be er impossible to get so we always have the parcel with coffee and shit like that
S0262	yeah wow
S0298	but they use it to trade right and well overall they be you know not too too too bad off i i i think they probably manage the transition reasonably well as well so
S0262	well my erm well my business partner she be polish and she show me her parents' old flat and they be you know in their thirties and forties and it be it be like wow okay it's communist kind of era obviously but it's like but she say you know what it all work because her dad have a job her mum have a job they have enough money to buy food
S0298	we i think in sort of er in the in the soviet era i think east germany have probably the highest standard of live because they have most most industry erm be be best off from from all of them erm
S0262	yeah
S0298	and and poland probably wasn't too far well poland be a bite off from it but well
S0262	mm yeah it be a good film consider there wasn't really anything else on to watch anyway
S0298	yeah well i mean i look through through the list and i think you're more likely to come to er if there's a film on rather than just say let's go for a drink kind of thing
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0298	er so i look at it i say be that it erm eh
S0262	i know i mean friday there's nothing on apart from some sort of opera or something
S0298	yeah and then there be er there be a film with seymour hoffman on
S0262	yeah i'm not sure
S0261	yeah i've see a poster for that
S0262	i'm not so into that idea
S0298	yeah yeah and er
S0262	it's a bite weird
S0298	it be quite funny when i be stand outside have a fag there be like there be this group of asian people there
S0262	yeah
S0298	asian students they be look and they be consider i think go to watch tony benn because they didn't know what it be
S0298	i think that be quite amuse
S0261	let's go and see tony benn
S0262	yeah they'd probably last about ten minutes and walk out
S0261	that be brilliant
S0298	yeah they be very indecisive so one of them go in and i think sort of look and
S0262	it's like
S0261	mm
S0262	well at the weekend we be get into erm the spy series the bbc erm do a four part it's my dad he's get the dvd
S0298	okay yeah
S0262	and erm it's the spy i don't know if you know much about that
S0298	i vaguely recall hear something about it but i don't know
S0262	yeah it's you know it's it's quite good because we saw a film call the fourth man which have anthony hopkins in it
S0298	okay
S0262	and it be make quite a long time ago
S0298	yeah
S0262	erm and we just love this character in it
S0298	yeah
S0262	and he happen to be a spy
S0298	okay
S0262	his character be really quite amuse
S0298	what be spy again be they
S0262	so they anthony blunt guy burgess mac mac try to think of what his name be now macclean and kim
S0261	it be kim macclean and donald
S0262	not it's donald macclean
S0261	donald mcclean and kim
S0262	pirus pireus or something
S0261	can't remember but they they be erm the two film be actually link
S0298	mm
S0261	the spy on be when they be young and go to
S0298	yeah
S0261	and the er blunt one be when post war post the second world war
S0298	okay
S0261	and they be all communist
S0298	okay
S0261	and it turn out the blunt erm blunt be a politician be that right
S0262	mm
S0261	blunt be a politician that be call he be call out by margaret thatcher in the seventies as be a communist spy in the war
S0262	no he wasn't a politician he be the the the the royal family's erm top bloke to look after their entire private collection in the uk
S0261	he look after the collection
S0298	okay
S0262	of that of that
S0298	yeah
S0262	so he be put in power the king and queen
S0298	but the other guy become spy within erm mi5 and mi6
S0298	oh okay
S0261	so they be spy within the spy agency for britain
S0298	yeah yeah
S0261	but they be actually erm report to to moscow
S0298	ah so they be double agents
S0262	yeah
S0261	then this this this yeah this all start when they all meet at university
S0298	okay
S0261	in the nineteen thirties
S0298	oh
S0261	and erm and and they kind of follow the whole war and then they felt erm betray because russia align with hitler and all of this kind of stuff erm two of them be gay and it be a really kind of complicate really kind of complicate arrangement but a really interest story
S0262	yeah
S0298	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	there's this one guy the character this guy burgess and he's really the kind of erm you know he's the he's the the outrageous queer of the time right but he's get very important he have important position he's an alcoholic he's just way off you know way out of it and erm they there's two two of them get send to america to do some important job you know when they be british erm but of course they be still spy you know in their position and erm and this guy burgess you know he he he just have the gift of the gab and he's you know he's he's actually in england in london he's i think he's arrest for loiter i think that be the the way they use to call it at the time
S0261	yeah the official
S0262	erm and but it be really a cottage you know that you know and and anyway he manage to sort of somehow get himself erm off that charge
S0261	yeah
S0262	but the wink and the nod be the judge know someone who he go to eton with he go to with and what my dad be tell me be that erm the americans and the er well who who be it no it be the english who be just break his code all the time
S0261	yeah the enigma code
S0262	and they keep on the other one and they they keep the one that be harder than the enigma i forget what it be call now but they be break this code and it take age for them to break cos it be just so hard and even after the cold war finish they keep on try to keep crack this code because they think it would be useful to actually have the whole picture in case they ever need it for whatever reason and erm so they keep everyone there and they be they actually use it in a way be to get the the the name of these spy because they through the code they be crack the code they begin to realise that these spy be imply an elite status position in england
S0298	okay
S0262	and they be english
S0298	yeah
S0262	and that's in the end they get them because they get anthony blunt because they keep on crack the code and they find out that it be this you know royal family friend
S0298	yeah
S0262	and that's when thatcher come down hard on him and he be say oh look cos he'd be he's go away to to russia and he be exile in russia and and he apparently write this letter to margaret thatcher it's quite famous say dear dear margaret erm i know that i'm go to be you know hang for treason or he wouldn't have be but you know basically i know that i'll be lock up for evermore for for treason but can you just allow me one thing can i please go to erm a cricket match at the oval one last time
S0262	or whichever one and then you can have me you know like you can handcuff me and erm and she just write back and say no you're not even come back to england you're stay in russia you make your bed and you should lie on it
S0261	but the but the guy we couldn't remember his name of the i mean he get bury with honour in moscow
S0298	okay
S0261	and all this kind of thing so they very well er respect spy from from the russian side
S0262	but the anthony hopkins guy
S0261	really pretty outrageous
S0298	yeah
S0262	just anthony hopkins play this eccentric queer sort of you know just
S0298	yeah
S0262	erudite as well to the
S0261	gentleman
S0262	he's just so funny in this role it obviously he's not mean to be funny it's just the way it come across but
S0261	yeah he's get that classic line yeah so he he have a whole night out he's absolutely hungover and he wake up the morning and his mate's hang out try to talk to him and here he be just knock back the leftovers in glass
S0262	drink
S0261	you know wine and all this kind of thing right he grab this bottle of wine that's half open and he's try to finish it off in the morning and his friend go you've just gotta stop drink and he go er i kind of like my wine slightly over oxidise
S0262	yes no well oxidise
S0261	well oxidise well oxidise
S0262	he's just knock it back
S0261	yeah
S0262	brilliant he's really good it it he's really funny but then we saw well i saw it last night because erm yeah i be like there's only really one it's gotta be i can't imagine where else the be and erm it yeah and so it be all film in and in
S0298	oh no i've see that on the on the programme guide there be something call but erm
S0262	yeah
S0298	i watch something else
S0261	what be it about
S0262	it be all about this vicar from in
S0298	that sound that sound excite
S0262	i know and the only good thing about it be that he's a really good look actor that's the only reason
S0298	not not that i care
S0262	no exactly and he you know it's really quite a dull it's a dull it's a dull drama
S0298	yeah yeah
S0262	but i mean look wonderful look lovely you know but apart from that it's it's more it's get nothing to it erm but yeah the the spy film be quite good fun
S0298	yeah
S0262	because they're use obviously all of the
S0298	yeah
S0262	all of the locations in
S0298	yeah
S0262	erm it's really great how they how they how they can get that look you know this period kind of look and i keep go round look and i'll be like be that where they film that i wonder where they film that they must have really have to tighten the camera the actual you know to to to take the lamppost out you know kind of make it look that
S0298	they can probably do that in photoshop
S0261	actually it's it's a erm like the film we've just watch it's a well compose film
S0298	yeah mm mm
S0261	the the imagery in it be really well put together
S0262	mm yeah it's it's quite interest except there must be this thing about be back in at the moment
S0298	yeah
S0261	we're a bite more observant than the than than than the local er
S0298	there be a thing on wasn't there wasn't there some like stupid film about er you know the national poet or something like that who
S0262	recently
S0298	no five six years ago and he be there's a whole bunch of er big shots which er which because he he come he also go to and there's a whole part of that film which play in we might have see that together in the er in the but it be probably like six seven years ago it be a bite rubbish because it be sort of another one of these oh oh oh
S0262	oh it's amaze ah yeah
S0298	it might have be part of the sort of club kind of you know the people who
S0261	oh the rupert brooke and and
S0298	yeah yeah
S0261	virginia woolf and
S0298	i don't know
S0262	i'm try to think what that film be cos normally i can kind of remember film i've see but that doesn't ring a bell at all he's a poet laureate
S0298	sorry
S0262	he be a poet laureate
S0298	yeah something like that but then there be he he might have have to resign because either he be gay or he have an affair with someone else or something like that there be a
S0261	or he or he get jail
S0262	sound quite good
S0298	no i think i like very hazy recollection i didn't like the movie at all because it be like all a bite er
S0261	you're not you're not talk about archer be you
S0262	a bite too
S0298	no no no no no no
S0261	talk about archer
S0262	they might have go up to them and say can we use your house as a as for this drama
S0298	no it be definitely sort of a feature film erm
S0261	oh okay
S0298	and i didn't yeah it be like basically almost all of these sort of okay it wasn't like a a period drama as like two of them be advertise which i hate with a passion i i can't not even with a passion i just can't be bother
S0262	yeah fair enough yeah
S0298	er but it sort of like a more sort of nineteen twenties nineteen thirties kind of period thingy and it be just like or maybe a little bite later actually so
S0261	well that's interest
S0262	oh i think i think mm wasn't that bertrand russell film that we saw be it
S0298	i i i that's all i remember from it
S0262	because we do see a bertrand russell film and he go to
S0298	uhu
S0262	i don't remember him be a poet laureate he be like a you know a groundbreaking mathematician
S0298	no no this be about a poet it be the sort of film like gwyneth paltrow would play in as a muse or some shit like that
