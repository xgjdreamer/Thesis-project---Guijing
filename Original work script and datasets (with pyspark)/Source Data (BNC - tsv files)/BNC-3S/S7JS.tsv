S0519	they all do it yeah he do there be even an office to go and have your picture take
S0520	yeah exactly
S0519	erm but my thing be he like to carry everything with him in his briefcase and he completely ram it full so you know when you can't actually get your hand in without take everything out
S0520	mm
S0519	and then he want to look sifter all the document but they're in the briefcase somewhere and there's sixteen sockets and he doesn't which of them be
S0522	he want to keep them yeah whereas put them away somewhere you now and everything's out before you get there and

S0520	there be restaurant er record sometimes they're a bite annoy so i just do it and if i don't think it's worth submit i won't submit it i'll be fair about it
S0519	or you could stop it at that point
S0522	why would people want people chat
S0520	it's a linguistic research so what they're do be study how people talk in order to create erm textbooks for english language learn that's more or less what i think because it's part of the erm language learn educational erm department in the university press so they've produce all this learn material for people learn english and for whatever reason they want to collect sample of how people speak english naturally like not in a contrive situation like not when they're make a speech or
S0519	mm
S0520	pretend to have a conversation
S0519	just chat
S0520	but just naturally they study it with all these different academic methods and erm a lot of it be very very technical i think linguistic stuff they go into the detail of how the sentence be structure and so on and they just i guess figure out from there what be the best way to teach people the language the most effective way to teach people and they produce erm educational materials it's a really big thing in there be like a massive number of language school there and in the summer young people use to come from all over
S0519	mm from all over the world yeah
S0520	the world to learn english and so it's become quite the centre of it and this be one of the reason they're do this particular study be because language have change so much in the last ten years because of the technology like phone and all devices and whatever
S0519	yes of course
S0520	not not only be there a lot more word lot of new word which relate to technology and social media like facebook and all of that but also erm the way that people actually communicate have change so they want to make they want to have a sample but the last time they do it be fifteen years ago i can't remember twenty years ago maybe do something on this scale they want to have a
S0519	mm another sample
S0520	an update sample basically and so they just set a erm goal to get two million
S0519	oh
S0520	minutes or something of speak conversation and it doesn't matter what you're talk about who you're talk about it they they you'll have to fill in a very short form later but erm
S0519	a whaty
S0520	short form
S0522	a short form to say you're allow to use me
S0520	they want to know where you're from in term of the your what your accent be but that's all really they don't want to know your credentials even so i don't know i think it's very technical
S0522	oh right yeah i know you didn't even ask whether i mind to have my
S0520	yeah sorry i didn't ask your permission i mean to and i erm
S0519	be erm put this forward to me as a method of me earn money see as dad only give me four hundred pound a month
S0520	i'm not be funny
S0520	i mean you could do it literally you put your phone on when you go out for lunch you get eighteen quid an hour
S0522	that's very good
S0519	it's really good why eighteen it's huge isn't it
S0520	it's massively expensive it's like my salary it's a bite out of proportion i get thirteen forty an hour or something
S0519	yeah people get six pound
S0520	's like what it's hardly minimum wage but i've be do it for a long time so i'm not sure why eighteen i mean there's a little bite of administration to go with it but i be just worry for you you have four hundred pound a month
S0522	i suppose people have to be incentivised to do it if it be a fiver you'd be like never mind
S0519	no i can't be bother
S0520	never mind yeah and it's suppose to be like reasonable quality
S0519	no it's great
S0520	well there's a there's a cap on it i can only submit thirty hours but erm
S0519	that's a lot of money
S0520	it's five hundred pound for no
S0519	for no effort
S0520	i could do
S0519	well a very little effort
