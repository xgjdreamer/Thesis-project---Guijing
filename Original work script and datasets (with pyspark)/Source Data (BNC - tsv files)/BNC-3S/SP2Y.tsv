S0240	what would you say my accent be
S0238	well i don't know you i think you're suppose to decide yourself
S0240	oh okay
S0238	where be
S0240	just
S0238	where be you bring up
S0240	sort of southern english it's the pronunciation really isn't it erm
S0238	posh
S0240	queen's english where do you currently live
S0238	no i don't think you quite sound like the queen
S0241	i erm
S0241	my my cleaner texted me on be it saturday or sunday night and saturday night i think it be and say get onto the x factor now because erm because there's the spit image of you on there so i say okay so i go onto the x factor and erm and there be this woman who speak with a very posh accent and be twenty three year old and a model be how she describe herself as and i think not a bite like me very quirky by my cleaner obviously think i'm quite posh
S0241	which it's quite interest
S0238	mm
S0241	cos when i do the record they always say oh that accent oh no it's not acceptable so
S0238	mm
S0238	well i would have say you speak standard english with a slight accent it's not a heavy one at all
S0241	no it's inconsiderate to be so why be the tell us to how to write the date
S0240	mm
S0238	well i say er because er the americans write it the other way round and they want to be clear what date it be i suppose but
S0240	mm
S0238	since there aren't suppose to be any americans on it
S0240	date er yeah
S0238	because the person i talk to most be american and i be think i could record our conversation and then realise i couldn't
S0241	be they gonna put all of why do they need this
S0238	i don't know
S0241	be i go to put and then or should have put these
S0238	well that's a good question isn't it erm by the time

S0240	that bite
S0238	and the paper
S0241	yeah confirm if you

S0241	oh we could maybe you could print it out for her or something or
S0238	well that's a
S0241	it's alright i mean yeah
S0238	that's a printout erm so
S0241	right cos shall we just go through some general things first
S0240	yeah
S0241	that i need to confirm
S0238	yeah okay sorry
S0241	erm so it's confirm that it's at the in on the twenty
S0240	be it a café
S0241	it's do it say café
S0240	yeah when i
S0241	when what
S0240	when i look it up on google it say café it surprise me a bite
S0241	well it be a café it's er it's a but it's a bigger than a café
S0240	yeah
S0241	it's a an art centre
S0240	oh right
S0241	it's like and
S0240	oh oh be it
S0241	but smaller than that
S0240	oh i haven't be there
S0241	i mean it's an old school actually
S0240	mm
S0241	it's a former former school
S0240	oh right
S0241	and erm and so it's there and the title of it be have change as success in international business through effective communication we've say these time to them and they have now put the time on the website which basically reflect what we've say so they those be the this be what they've put on
S0240	yeah
S0241	so that's the description of what's on
S0240	yeah
S0241	just so we know
S0240	be that what you send us earlier on today
S0241	yeah i can't
S0240	yeah
S0240	er might have do
S0238	yes
S0240	i think so yeah
S0241	erm so we know what the time be and the from contact me the other day and say so far there've be no book onto it but
S0241	but she have only just put it on and erm and so could i let other people know about it so i contact businesses and employer engagement here and everybody for them to promote it but then i email them back actually and say do you do you know have you any idea why people might not have enrol on it yet
S0238	mm
S0241	because erm it you ask us for it so i think you you must have think there be a demand
S0240	mm
S0238	mm
S0241	erm but she hasn't get back to me about that but i just the main reason i want to say that to her be actually be because what i don't want them to do be they've pay us some money to prepare this and do the things that we've do and what i don't want them to do be start say well as if this doesn't run that actually we'll get you to prepare something else because they've have our money now because
S0240	yeah
S0241	we've prepare it and they can use it another time
S0238	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	and now i've already email them and say we you know we've this be the money that you've pay for us so far it have now be use up
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	so erm
S0238	well we've all put some time into it
S0241	yeah so if it doesn't run i think it will i think i think we'll get some people in
S0240	yeah
S0241	but erm i mean if it doesn't run then we could offer to run it again in the future some time but erm
S0238	do they have a minimum number of people on
S0241	i don't think so because i mean when i go to the china one there be there be from another person from somebody else that kind of know them from and so there weren't actually that many at i think there be only about three or four actually businesses
S0238	mm
S0241	as far as i could tell and that they be there make the number up i think
S0238	mm
S0241	and that be with the china and me you know
S0241	and do i count so that sound like
S0238	see the one that i go to there be at least twenty people there i would say
S0241	mm
S0238	so that's a quite quite a different thing
S0241	the mexico one i go to have be a roomful
S0240	i mean it's the time of year for people book they people be just back from holiday since the bank holiday and all the rest
S0238	i would think that there'll be
S0240	they they they
S0238	that people won't start book until next week
S0240	probably haven't get round to it yeah
S0238	yeah yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	mm i say that to her as well i say people have be away and they won't have realise yet so right so then so we've get the structure there and so i suppose what we could do today be just go through the structure of what
S0240	mm
S0241	you know where just go through it as as if we be do the day and see what's what the er so this be the first thing be the effective email communications obviously be this one so yeah it look much i think it's we're just about there i do write some a few note in but it be mostly just suggestion things just little things so obviously the title's change now
S0238	yes
S0241	but we i think we should keep speak the same language on it even though it's not on the official title and then push successful what be the title that we call it now
S0238	success of international business through
S0240	that's more a subtitle isn't it that one
S0241	oh yes so success in international business
S0238	so
S0241	yeah so effective communication
S0240	could that not go into the or be it too late to have that speak the same language
S0241	they won't put it onto the website they say that the
S0240	oh
S0241	they say it's too long i send them those i send them two or three options that we're look
S0240	yeah
S0238	well that's okay there that'll look work it fulfil
S0240	for them
S0238	the same function as our subtitle
S0241	mm
S0238	and we keep speak the same language
S0241	yeah
S0238	ahead of that yeah
S0241	okay there
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah erm so then i just write on this front slide as a note thing erm about what we would do when that slide be up and be that the point where we say where we introduce ourselves and cos otherwise when would we do it
S0238	er yes
S0240	yes
S0238	i think that's logical
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	so we'd introduce ourselves then
S0240	mm
S0241	so where we live languages that we speak and our business experience so basically the bio we haven't she didn't actually put the bios up in the end so
S0240	oh
S0241	i keep them but we haven't use them i wouldn't put in cos if you get people from different part of yorkshire they don't know anyway
S0240	they oh okay we'll
S0241	people that do know
S0240	or
S0241	don't see it as very positive
S0240	oh well it's just the location though
S0241	they see but it's a rough area of
S0240	oh okay
S0241	so people won't necessarily think oh that's a really good place to be whereas be a good a good company to work for
S0240	yeah okay yeah
S0241	so
S0240	shall i put then
S0241	i'd why do it matter
S0241	i mean i would just we'll see
S0240	okay yeah
S0241	you don't need to change it
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos if they're ask for it
S0240	yeah cos they're not gonna go anyway yeah
S0241	i'll just change it yeah
S0238	mm
S0241	erm
S0240	teach experience and business experience so more or less that
S0241	i don't think the teach
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah well just not so much
S0240	country yeah
S0241	yeah country
S0240	international experience
S0241	so where we've live the languages that we speak and business like if you've work in you know like that you've work at
S0240	well i've look i've work in load of businesses
S0241	yeah like lot of businesses such as
S0240	actually but that be the most recent
S0241	yeah
S0240	in spain
S0241	mm
S0240	i be always go off to work in company and businesses
S0241	yeah
S0240	and part of it to work
S0241	so it do say that
S0240	erm yeah
S0241	so if we just do a quick thing like that erm and then they would introduce themselves i suppose we could ask them to introduce themselves with their name job company which languages they speak which culture they have experience of and if anybody have a different first language to english
S0240	yeah
S0241	so any different and and then maybe just they ask question and comment as you go along if you've not a it's not a a talk a speech be it
S0238	mm yeah
S0241	it's er interactive so so those be the note that i make about the first one
S0240	introduce themselves will that depend on the number because there might be if there's twenty thirty
S0241	there won't be twenty thirty if we've get none so far
S0240	no
S0241	there just won't there'll be like five or six
S0240	okay well
S0241	i think
S0240	that'll work then won't it
S0238	mm
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos if there be more then we can't
S0240	could go on rather a long time otherwise
S0241	yeah if if there if there be more we just can't
S0240	they'd have to mingle
S0241	we just can't but
S0240	yeah
S0238	if the i mean if there be a lot
S0241	there won't be
S0238	i suppose plan b be that we ask things like erm
S0240	do anybody have a
S0238	have a different native
S0240	yeah have any
S0241	yeah
S0238	cos that's relevant
S0240	have a hand up if
S0238	yeah but but rather than go round
S0241	yeah what languages do you use
S0238	and do all the name
S0241	yeah what languages do you speak and
S0240	yeah mm
S0241	yeah have you be live in the countries and things general stuff erm yeah so that be the oh and i do make a note here about name card and there be a few things i want to ask when i contact her but a bite nearer the time when she's confirm there's people here cos cos it the last one i go to they have a slide at the begin at this thing this be part of our passport to export programme so they might need to send us that to put at the begin just so we can say this be part of 's passport to export programme but you don't have to explain more about it than that and they have we have name card last time so and that i don't know whether she provide them or the guy that run the session but
S0238	mm
S0241	people just put their first name on it so i can ask about that when we see how many people be book and things
S0238	well again i i think when i erm sorry i don't know where the microphone be
S0241	oh sorry
S0238	where i go last time i yeah they provide name card they be just there
S0241	yeah but whether they be there
S0241	because the facilitator bring them or whether they be there
S0238	right
S0241	because bring them be what we need to check
S0238	right
S0241	presumably bring them but i think i just need to check that
S0238	yeah
S0241	er and whether there's a flip chart or power well powerpoint's there for a start and whether there's a flip you know cos they won't in
S0240	yeah
S0241	i don't think there'll be a a
S0240	there won't be a white board no
S0241	a board so i think we'd need a we might need a flip chart to write on at some point or something
S0240	yeah
S0238	mm okay
S0241	yeah
S0238	yes so so all those sort of things
S0241	so i'll ask her about that
S0238	and we're leave that to you to to sort
S0241	yeah so i'll just contact her about this at some point who set the room up beforehand so if it start at nine fifteen the register do we need to be get there quite a bite earlier to set it all up
S0240	mm
S0241	or how be it go to be set up this kind of thing
S0238	mm yeah
S0241	what shape you know what what layout
S0238	yeah
S0241	but i'll ask her all of that erm
S0238	all in one long email with lot of question
S0241	in one email
S0241	and erm yeah so that be that so then we've get the programme there be this the same as what it say on here nine thirty to eleven effective email communication in international business and that eleven fifty ah there it say eleven yeah this be eleven fifteen isn't it
S0238	right
S0241	it's eleven to eleven fifteen
S0238	oh okay
S0241	eleven thirty's a long break isn't it when people have get to get back to work
S0238	so that will be till twelve forty five
S0241	yeah
S0238	right okay
S0241	and it's use international english for effective business communication in email and meet
S0238	okay right
S0240	mm
S0241	and so what we'd say be for the first ten minutes more or less of your bite
S0238	mm
S0241	that we'd do the introductions then we'd do the agree and disagree section
S0238	mm
S0241	for about half an hour so the their introductions and us introduce ourselves which on that first slide right we've talk about and then the today's programme erm so we'll have already introduce ourselves by then and this be today's programme and you don't even need to say anything about it it would just this be it
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm and and then we get to the next slide which be your introduction to this section
S0238	so we're do that agree disagree thing while slide two be up
S0241	i would put it do it while slide three be up because i think we're say here this be the whole day
S0238	okay
S0241	and we introduce ourselves this be this be be your general thing
S0240	yeah
S0241	this be what's happen all of today now we're gonna do the first part of today which be slide three
S0240	yeah
S0241	so by then we'll have all introduce ourselves they'll have introduce their selves and we'll know what the session's gonna look like and there might be an extra slide in there about passport and export
S0238	alright okay
S0241	and then at the effective communication say this so we're gonna look at how to make be effective in communication and then we hand out i hand out the agree and disagree
S0238	mm okay
S0241	so that now look like this
S0240	mm oh yes that's better
S0241	but it's not actually i've make it purple now
S0241	erm because
S0240	we've go purple
S0241	erm because i'm very corporate but part
S0240	that's much nicer
S0241	and partly because
S0240	mm
S0241	it do a bite of light blue so all of these bits
S0240	really
S0241	yeah
S0238	i much prefer purple
S0241	so i make it purple and actually it be a nicer colour than the
S0238	mm
S0241	the blue be the standard one that come up when you open a word
S0238	mm yeah
S0241	and it make you look lazy if you use that
S0238	yes
S0241	so actually it be better and so it's just that one page now
S0240	why do why do that line go there and not over there any particular reason
S0241	over where
S0240	well that blue extend to there but that blue didn't extend
S0241	oh good point yeah
S0240	so it just catch my eye
S0241	yeah i didn't yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	good point we'll get rid of that yeah
S0240	but it look lovely
S0238	mm
S0240	yeah much better
S0241	so that's that and then well they'll just go through it and i'll let them fill it in and then
S0238	right
S0241	and then we can go through it and that's half an hour
S0240	half an hour yeah
S0241	so that be that right erm while we've get slide three up and then you do from slide four erm
S0238	and that's suppose to be be the be you say the the agree disagree be thirty mins so that's forty minutes with the introduction
S0241	mm yes
S0238	yes yes
S0241	yeah
S0238	right
S0241	yeah and then we'd say originally in one of the previous meet the powerpoint be then forty minutes
S0238	yeah
S0241	and the email exercise be ten minutes that be the idea
S0238	okay
S0241	to get to the break erm so what have i just write here so you've get these note haven't you you've say all that already it might be worth in in when you're see it all this what you're say here we're gonna look at the culture and how it affect communication and vote on email and all the stuff that you'd write in your note to say and you know there be some handouts as we go along and handouts at the end or something like that
S0238	mm
S0241	but it's very clear so i think so i think that's fine the picture i think that's great cos you'd write you've write here about the image and everything
S0238	yes yes
S0241	i think that's fine
S0238	well er you i mean i get feedback on that mm and i think that's easy enough to read now and everything
S0241	mm
S0238	and it's about the right erm
S0241	so then we get to this one about edward t hall
S0238	mm
S0241	be you gonna say who he be be be how he be
S0238	erm
S0241	even if you just say a one liner
S0238	it probably would be appropriate wouldn't it
S0241	yeah
S0240	mm yeah
S0238	i mean what the the thing that i saw that do she be go something like a very wise professor call so and so and that sort of thing
S0240	bite patronise
S0238	which well it be a bite not so much patronise as cute
S0238	you know sort of
S0240	yeah
S0238	it would be sort of
S0240	it's treat them like
S0238	the japanese word be
S0240	yeah
S0238	you know
S0238	erm erm which i actually it i think be very interest because she be talk about cultural differences
S0241	mm yeah
S0238	you know and i actually though oh i wouldn't have say it like that at all so yes erm and i need to think so i need to think what to say
S0241	so you could say edward t hall what so we're gonna look at edward t hall's categories of culture context time and space he be a culture an american cultural anthropologist who die in two thousand and nine
S0238	thank you
S0238	for talk about that bite
S0238	well now i know what he be but i didn't know when he die
S0240	cultural anthropologist
S0241	you don't need to write all that actually cos all i need to do actually be just why don't i just shove this through the printer then any any handwritten stuff i've get in here you'll just get as well won't you
S0238	well it's alright i'll i can
S0241	i'll write it as well and then i'll print that up
S0240	mm
S0241	erm and
S0238	it might not be a bad idea cos your handwrite be a hell of a lot more legible than mine
S0241	so i also write he specialise in intercultural relations and his ideas erm be very practical for business or something like that
S0238	yeah
S0240	mm
S0241	but really it's just
S0238	yes i mean you don't want it to look as though we're gonna hit them with a lot of theory
S0241	mm
S0240	no
S0238	but at the same time as you say
S0241	so i'm just underline the word
S0238	pro
S0240	yeah
S0240	yeah colleague at least
S0241	yeah so what we're gonna do be look at his ideas and how they relate in a very practical sense to business communication
S0240	oh that sound good
S0241	erm and then you're gonna say all these things that you've get in your note here
S0238	yeah
S0241	that you're generalise and this kind of thing everybody be an individual i've say i've write here warn everybody be an so it's a warn that whatever we say today er always remember that everybody be an individual in every culture and that there be multilingual and multicultural people in all culture now in businesses so even in the uk you could have email recipient who be not an english native speaker when you send an email
S0238	mm
S0241	erm
S0240	well you're very likely to
S0241	and erm yeah
S0240	to be honest not just could but
S0241	yeah you're very likely to yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	and that
S0240	and
S0241	and that they're likely to have they could be in it they're likely to be in it it could easily be an immigrant and they're likely to have marry if you know a different first language erm so yeah and then we get onto so first of all we'll look at context and yeah all that be fine so what be you gonna do with the country but be you just gonna to say to them which like be you gonna do it just ask them on this one
S0238	yes
S0241	so what do you think what do you think china might be and see what people say
S0238	well i guess so just
S0241	or what you think germany might be
S0240	mm
S0238	just call out
S0241	cos like in a plenary thing
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah and you'll light it up with the colour which be very good
S0238	yes
S0241	and and then what you've just say about the implications for business
S0238	yeah
S0241	which be good and then low context and implications for business and then the issue that they might predict which you're gonna ask them aren't you
S0238	mm
S0241	erm i add a few extra things on there
S0238	good yeah
S0241	i put high context emphasis on not lose face i know you've write that somewhere but i didn't see it here oh cos i'd write examples do we want any examples
S0240	oh yeah
S0238	mm
S0240	i forget about that one
S0241	cos you'd say er high context might feel that the lower context would we would all feel pressurise to give answer and this kind of thing which be alright but there's also the high high context ones have an emphasis on not lose face so so if you ask so as an example if you ask if somebody mail you and ask you for information that you've already send it to not say as i mention in my last email
S0238	mm
S0241	this be like this
S0238	mm
S0241	but to act
S0240	mm
S0241	as if they've not do it
S0238	mm
S0241	and as if it's the first time and they do it's just an oversight on your part
S0238	mm
S0241	so something like that
S0238	mm
S0240	yeah it's difficult
S0238	yes yes i mean it's a good idea to have
S0241	an example
S0238	er various examples in the note
S0241	mm
S0238	that you might or might not need to use
S0241	mm
S0238	because it depend what
S0240	they might come up with it
S0238	it depend
S0240	if they've
S0238	how responsive they be and
S0240	yeah
S0238	and how much they're come up with themselves if if we're get plenty from them and i'm look and you're look at the time
S0240	yeah
S0238	then you know but yes
S0241	yeah so let me just write here
S0240	i mean in a way the examples be the most interest part
S0238	yes
S0240	because
S0241	mm
S0240	because it's so sort of innocuous isn't it as i mention in my last email it's
S0241	mm
S0240	harmless for us really it doesn't
S0241	yeah
S0240	well i wouldn't
S0238	well i wouldn't no
S0240	would it annoy you
S0238	if i'm if i be do that it be a kind of rap over the knuckle you know
S0240	as i mention in my last email
S0238	i mean i have that last last week with the report for the japanese course
S0240	mm
S0238	erm be sort of tell i only find out about this yesterday and and i look at my send email and think well actually no i send you an email about it a week
S0240	yeah
S0238	so i actually
S0241	mm
S0238	say that in my reply because it's make it look as though i haven't tell her and actually i have
S0240	and i suppose yes i suppose it depend on the tone and the
S0238	yeah erm
S0240	the content of the rest of the email
S0238	yeah
S0241	but actually what this be say which be what say from be even though you're fully aware of that
S0238	yes
S0240	yeah yeah
S0241	in business that it's no
S0238	yes
S0241	that it make them lose face so it isn't worth
S0240	yeah yeah
S0241	say that but just
S0240	oh yeah
S0241	even though you're fully aware
S0238	so i think you very often when you do that you have get that sort of
S0240	i suppose so
S0238	self justification kind of motive
S0241	mm
S0238	and and what you're say be don't just think about yourself but because
S0241	mm
S0238	when it's in a business
S0240	but that's a really good interest example
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah and that
S0240	and ask them how they would respond to that in an email
S0238	yeah
S0240	get a you know
S0241	yeah
S0240	a bite of a bite of to and fro on that and well
S0241	and then they might say it doesn't matter i just think oh yeah fine but but it a japanese person for a high context person might
S0240	would take umbrage
S0241	take more might take it more and you think well you know
S0240	yeah
S0238	mm
S0241	because they're lose face it's a bigger thing for them
S0238	yes
S0241	so i don't really wanna give that example of something like that anyway
S0240	mm
S0238	yeah
S0241	er and that be everything about that and it's time then isn't it next
S0238	mm
S0241	and monochronic time and polychronic time erm oh yeah you'd write in your note polychronic emphasise the process of transactions and involvement of people over the schedule and i think you need and example there
S0238	mm okay
S0241	cos that's very hard to take up what that mean
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes yes okay fine
S0241	er so what an example that i be read about the other day be erm but it might be on the next slide actually that you say this but that a brazilian for example if he know he's get a meet he might sort of and he's talk to somebody he might just meet he might carry on his conversation first and then arrive a bite late to the meet cos he's chat to the person that he's talk to
S0240	and it would be rude to cut them off
S0241	it's more important than get to the yeah
S0238	mm
S0241	wouldn't wanna cut them off get to the meet slightly late cos flexibility of meet don't start on time anyway in our culture
S0238	i don't think that that's an example of
S0241	involvement of people over schedule
S0238	that's involvement of people yes okay yes
S0241	i don't know about the process of transactions
S0238	no
S0241	cos i don't really know what it mean
S0240	mm no i don't know what i mean either
S0241	so i don't i don't i've write i don't know what it mean
S0238	er i think that that well my understand be that they're look at do your your example be of something else that be interfere with the transaction if you see what i a a you know your conversation isn't anything to do with the meet i presume you mean
S0241	no
S0238	but i think this process of transactions be that that rather than worry about we've get to get it all do by tuesday it's we need to do it successfully and so that johnny's involve and sarah have her say and so and so get a chance to show what they can do so it's more about
S0241	mm
S0238	how the whole thing work and whether it work successfully and
S0241	mm
S0238	rather than whether you know i mean quite often if you're meet a deadline
S0240	rather than a result mm
S0238	you can end up cut somebody out of a loop
S0240	yeah
S0238	because you just need to get something do by a certain time
S0240	yeah so it's about get good centre then
S0238	yes so
S0240	people be in agreement
S0238	that's that wasn't that be my understand of
S0241	but it's not necessarily about successfully then be that it it's about because it can still be successful even if you miss some people out it just the end product might be successful
S0238	mm
S0241	it's just the that the people
S0238	but it's that
S0240	yeah
S0238	the process need to be successful
S0240	the process
S0238	as well as the end product
S0241	yeah yeah
S0238	i suppose be what i'm think yes
S0240	mm yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	yeah cos the people
S0238	yes
S0241	can get upset about it so it's try to involve all the people yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm
S0240	well that be on that erm questionnaire you send us
S0241	mm
S0240	i do try that one about you know whether you think it be better to get things do or
S0241	oh yeah
S0240	ensure that everybody
S0241	everybody's involve
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	i didn't really have time to read all the result but
S0241	mm
S0240	i will do i've print them out
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	so i other word you've put that question mark there so that need a little bite more explanation
S0240	mm
S0238	which i think be fair enough yeah
S0241	mm yeah yeah okay
S0238	it's very abstract that
S0241	but i mean the thing about finish the conversation before you know that you might get to the meet a bite late
S0238	oh i'm not say that that that's
S0241	that could come next anyway
S0238	yes
S0241	cos we've get the example
S0240	mm
S0241	er so that's fine and then the implications for business about time and it well you'll ask them what you know what they think
S0238	mm
S0241	but i add extra things
S0238	good right
S0241	i put value i'll pin i'll copy this pitch but you might not be able to read it
S0238	yes i think that's probably the best thing to do i haven't get the space
S0241	value spontaneity and improvisation
S0238	mm
S0241	so whereas we in polychronic culture they've like spain
S0240	mm
S0241	oh you now everything go wrong when i go to spain to give a talk but but it doesn't really matter cos that's fine it's all part of what happen and things so it doesn't matter that the the room be lock that we've go to and then it all get delay and start late and that
S0238	mm
S0241	and that the students be in a different place that it all end up fine in the end and in fact that's the good thing about us that we can manage to
S0241	improvise
S0240	mm
S0238	mm
S0241	and and so erm so value spontaneity and improvisation view time in flexible
S0240	mm
S0241	so life isn't and you've say be flexible as the start and end time of meet but i think it's because they view life as flexible view time as flexible so life isn't predictable so why bring why be why be so precise about schedule
S0238	mm
S0240	and it's extremely annoy
S0238	mm
S0241	but only if you're not from a polychronic culture
S0240	but it but it
S0238	yeah
S0240	well yeah but
S0241	i don't find it annoy
S0240	but it's i've be
S0238	i do
S0240	for then ten years but i have a lot of spanish guests visit me in over the summer and we be arrange to meet they didn't they weren't there then we get a message say they be come they be only five minutes away in morrisons' car park apparently it be a whole hour before they actually get you know
S0238	yes
S0240	and then it be like everything be throw out and you know
S0238	mm and i don't think that's
S0240	and then i think and then when they arrive they arrive like a whirlwind you know and and that it didn't matter at all like you say
S0241	yeah
S0240	they sort of manage to make it
S0238	i don't think that's just spain though i think that's people who text
S0240	mm
S0238	because i have the same problem with english people that i know who be incapable of stick to a timetable because they're so use to the fact that if they're run late they can just text someone and say it
S0240	yeah
S0238	and they don't seem to realise that that be actually throw me out
S0240	mm
S0238	because i've organise my life around the time they say they be go to come
S0241	that's cos you're monochronic you see
S0238	yes i'm very monochronic
S0241	and time don't time be something that be get waste or lose or
S0240	yeah
S0238	well it's such that i from a practical point of view if you're cook a meal from for somebody it's gonna be dry up in the oven if they arrive three hours later than they say they would
S0240	well in
S0241	mm yeah the way we do it yeah
S0238	but you know
S0241	the way that we do
S0240	the way the spanish do it they wouldn't would it cos
S0241	they would they run it that way cook them
S0240	they don't even they didn't i've be on spain where they've invite me for a dinner and they haven't even start the shop when i've arrive
S0241	yeah
S0240	they all set off to the supermarket to buy the stuff for a barbeque
S0240	and they i mean er one one place we go we be by the seaside and we just well all we want to do be eat and go to the beach and it go on and on and on and on and on and on and eventually we get to the beach about seven o'clock when they think it be perfect time cos it be cool
S0241	yeah
S0240	you know and there be the people have leave the beach and
S0238	right yes
S0240	oh
S0241	yeah so it be just a different
S0240	yeah
S0241	so it's so like as life isn't predictable why be so precise about schedule schedule aren't important they value relationships with the people which we mention before
S0238	mm
S0241	so make schedule erm a they value the relationships with the people more than they should get the schedule right
S0238	mm
S0241	so they'll all meet each other in morrisons' car park and make sure that they've all get there
S0238	mm
S0241	and if one person's really late
S0240	yeah
S0241	they'll still wait for them rather than get with the schedule whereas
S0238	mm
S0241	we would be say oh we'll go along you come along later
S0240	yeah
S0241	but they'll not let that one person come along later though
S0238	mm yes
S0241	erm so they emphasise the be rather than do he say make sure everyone who should be involve be involve which we mention just before hierarchies and stuff a brazilian might be offend by the uk's insistence on punctuality or get straight down to business er but the uk person might be offend by the brazilian arrive late
S0238	mm not so much offend as irritate i think
S0241	irritate yeah
S0238	but i mean that can then mean that they show that irritation
S0241	mm
S0238	and that can that could escalate
S0240	don't you think it's interest how the british sort of you know we don't get down to business immediately we always have like a minute don't you find at every meet
S0241	mm
S0240	there's always a minute or two however formal the meet of friendly chit chat and then immediately it's down to business
S0241	yeah
S0240	it's like you have that bite don't you
S0238	where you switch
S0241	yeah
S0240	and you get really annoy well if it go on and on and on
S0241	too long
S0240	yeah too long that bite cos you wanna get down to business but it seem like too abrupt to suddenly do it
S0241	mm
S0238	mm
S0240	but other culture don't do that
S0238	mm
S0240	they they don't know what's go on when we have our little chit chat they think it's a social thing but it's not it's part of the
S0238	mm
S0240	part of the official part of the meet in a way isn't it
S0241	yeah
S0240	it's become so
S0241	it's yeah
S0240	i think that's really interest
S0238	mm
S0241	but you can't have it on too long like you say
S0240	mm
S0241	cos otherwise it become
S0240	yeah eat into your your time yeah
S0241	and some and yeah and eat you know the fact that something eat into your time i don't think spanish people more spanish that i know would even think about think eat into their time
S0240	they don't no they don't
S0241	you know our concept that it can be waste or use in that way er
S0241	and some traditional time management program and book for businesses here don't necessarily work well in polychronic culture
S0238	no no
S0241	cos it's all about do urgent and to important and to do list and things like that
S0240	mm
S0241	which just don't work in
S0238	mm
S0241	you know erm and then monochronic on the monochronic slide you'd put emphasise schedule punctuality preciseness and to do list i write
S0238	yes yes
S0241	erm emphasise do things value productivity get things do on time the in monochronic culture we see things as time as something that can be lose or waste
S0238	yeah
S0241	so it should be manage plan and use efficiently yet we spend our all our time feel really rush
S0240	mm
S0241	don't we
S0240	yes
S0241	when we're do that whereas in spain
S0241	they don't think about time in quite the same way and they're not try to manage it
S0240	mm
S0241	and plan it all the time and so they're actually we what we would call not as productive cos somehow they're not do you know they've get meet that and have a start date which start late and then they haven't even get a finish date time sometimes
S0240	mm
S0241	so you don't even know when it's gonna finish so you can't put another meet afterwards yet they somehow seem less rush
S0238	mm
S0240	mm
S0241	so
S0238	mm
S0241	so even for all our focus on productivity and get things do we still feel rush
S0240	yeah
S0241	and feel more rush than them
S0241	so erm so what issue would you predict erm and you elicitate with everybody yeah erm i only write be the other things that monochronic people might feel frustration anger and impatience whereas the polychronics would feel offend or irritate
S0238	mm yeah yeah
S0240	mm
S0241	i also here don't you mean p time there the p time people be pressurise by constant reminders
S0238	no i mean no yes i do sorry yes
S0241	mm
S0238	which be why you be quite right when you say that rather than have this p time and end time you
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah
S0238	you need and i but i i haven't do it in the note
S0240	mm
S0241	mm
S0238	so yes you're right
S0241	so yeah so that's well
S0238	yes
S0241	it's just some think to think about later
S0238	yeah
S0241	that on that slide it's p time er and then it's space
S0238	yes
S0241	erm mm you haven't put countries for the space but it doesn't really matter you put countries for the time and the
S0238	no i just kind of
S0241	but i don't think it matter
S0238	because a lot of them be the
S0241	yeah
S0238	i mean not always like japan as you say be high context but
S0240	mm
S0238	i teach this summer i teach spanish people in july and japanese in august
S0240	really
S0238	and it be nine thirty start walk i walk in at the first day at at nine twenty three or something like that in order to set the computer up and they're all sit there wait for it
S0240	yeah yeah
S0238	amaze
S0240	and what about the spanish they drift in and
S0238	well they be actually they weren't bad because they be teachers
S0240	oh yeah
S0238	rather than students but they certainly weren't all there at nine thirty no erm so
S0240	that's a good example as well you know
S0238	mm
S0240	the the direct contrast like that
S0238	yes but i didn't think that i i think it's a bite too repetitive if we do the countries with all three concepts
S0241	yeah i think you're right
S0238	particularly since it's a lot of the same
S0240	yes i agree i agree
S0238	countries
S0240	yeah
S0238	that's why i didn't bother
S0241	yeah
S0240	mm
S0241	no i think you're right i think you're right about that erm then you say personal space be figurative rather than a literal sense
S0238	mm
S0241	and i think i think if you say that in a in a in the meet people won't
S0240	they won't
S0238	no well i mean
S0241	get
S0238	i would explain what that mean
S0241	right okay
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah erm how would you
S0238	that isn't a script
S0241	oh right that's just you explain it
S0238	that be note
S0240	mm
S0238	yes
S0241	yeah yeah so you'd just say it
S0238	er
S0241	so that be that i don't think there's anything else to add there
S0240	it be partly physical though isn't it this didn't that you stand there
S0238	that's that's yes but that's a different that but i er i don't know to what extent those things correlate
S0240	mm mm
S0238	i mean maybe they do
S0240	mm it's quite relevant to meet and things isn't it yeah
S0238	that be also relevant yes
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah the highest space ones maintain social distance and and the low space ones will allow to be closer but whether you actually be physically
S0238	that's what i that's what she's talk about
S0240	yeah
S0241	i think you be
S0238	i would think that there probably be quite a strong correlation there
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	but i don't actually know so
S0241	mm
S0240	mm
S0241	but i would imagine so
S0240	yeah
S0241	er and so let's so you explain them and then what the implications be there for business the importance of interpersonal exchange interest in long term relationships over short term gain so my example be it's not just about the make the sale now but
S0238	yes yeah
S0240	mm
S0241	but build up that relationship
S0240	mm
S0238	yeah
S0241	erm and you have that example about when you be invite out for dinner with some students and erm actually with a student do you remember you be invite out for dinner with a student and you weren't sure what it be why the student have invite you out
S0238	mm
S0241	you be a bite worry that cos it be a boy or it be a man or something that you think it might be a date or that he might be think of it as a date but actually he be just want english class for his niece or something
S0238	it be a senior executive at in
S0241	oh right
S0238	not a boy
S0238	erm and and when i get there i immediately know it wasn't a date because he introduce me to his mistress
S0238	and since i know someone who teach his small children and therefore know his wife i be really quite and quite offend by the whole thing but i couldn't say anything
S0241	and how do you know it be his mistress then cos you know his wife
S0238	cos he introduce me er this be my girlfriend
S0240	oh
S0238	and she's twenty three
S0241	see there's an example for you
S0240	mm
S0241	about
S0238	and it be and the most important thing about her be the fact that she be twenty three she be quite ugly
S0238	in my opinion but she be twenty three and he be in his forties and you know
S0240	well there you go
S0238	er and then he take me to this host take us we go to eat and then we go to this host bar which okay be because it wasn't his niece it be the niece of the of the host bar
S0240	mm
S0238	where he go so he be there with his girlfriend and for about three other host and the all fawn round him
S0238	one of the erm girls be from taiwan so she and i have a little conversation in chinese about the whole thing
S0238	it be quite interest nobody else could understand
S0241	i mean it's a good example not necessarily in so much detail
S0238	no
S0241	but it's a good example of how you just you know you don't quite know what but actually his whole thing be erm that he be think about the space and that he be just try to create this relationship so that he could get something out of it
S0240	mm whereas anybody else would from another culture would just ask straight out wouldn't they
S0241	would just ask
S0238	mm
S0241	yeah that's it
S0238	yes
S0238	yes if that have be in germany
S0240	yeah
S0238	they'd just have say
S0240	yeah
S0238	you know so and so want an english lesson
S0238	so we don't know what to think of it
S0241	yeah
S0238	erm
S0241	erm so yeah what be the implications for business high space culture tend to focus on task and maintain social distance as you say distinguish more between work life and private life erm and you've leave the space bubble the bubble empty cos it's more about what you're not talk about it's that
S0238	mm
S0241	you're not talk so much about private life and things like that
S0238	yes
S0241	erm and i don't know when we be i've write here actually stand i do assume it be connect stand close to each other
S0240	mm
S0241	the uk the british person keep move backwards on the pavement
S0238	mm
S0241	you know i think it be actually
S0238	mm
S0241	i for me to have write that i have read that somewhere
S0240	mm
S0238	oh i mean that's definitely true but what i be read be they do actually say you know we're talk for about figurative space rather than
S0240	literal
S0240	yeah
S0238	literally the literal space
S0240	well you could bring it up
S0238	but i would i
S0240	and you mention it
S0238	i i
S0240	ask around
S0240	yeah
S0240	see what people
S0238	certainly i mean yes i can remember my sociolinguistics lecturer at uni talk about that sort of thing
S0240	yeah
S0238	erm
S0241	and and you know things that you don't ask about so we don't ask about salary or age or things like that whereas i be want a in in the tube in madrid we meet this girl that be sell flower chinese girl and she ask me my salary and she'd only be like speak to me two minutes
S0238	yes
S0241	and that's china
S0238	oh yes i've have that experience in china
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	it be quite a common question
S0241	mm so things like that and then what issue might arise in email communication between them and you've get examples there erm yeah that be that and then what about you i would just put that in one colour
S0238	mm
S0241	rather than three different colour cos it look a bite
S0238	well it be suppose to be vary from red to green which be what we've be look at but i've
S0241	ah i see i didn't get that but
S0241	i like the idea
S0238	okay well if you the
S0241	i just wonder why be it in three different colour
S0240	oh yeah
S0241	so but you if you clarify that it would be fine what be you be you red and
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos people might not have necessarily notice
S0238	mm
S0241	so be high space so red be high space low space high context and polychronic
S0238	yes yeah
S0241	yeah and this be monochronic
S0240	mm
S0241	and low space so i mean for people to remember that it's quite difficult anyway i think
S0241	i think so i think the terminology can be a bite yeah
S0241	i can't remember it now
S0240	i don't think you need to remind them of the you know
S0241	yeah mm
S0240	what about you they'll know whether you're talk about
S0238	yeah
S0240	be you on that side or that
S0241	yeah yeah
S0240	you just need a physical gesture or somewhere in between
S0241	cos you've get the picture haven't you
S0238	mm
S0240	mm
S0240	yeah i wouldn't repeat all this bite off put
S0241	yeah so what what you know what about what's your attitude about time or er
S0240	mm yeah
S0241	space in really in your know talk about private live in your or your thing about
S0238	mm
S0241	you know how important you know or just think
S0238	and be we do that erm well i suppose it depend how many people we've get doesn't it be we do that as a open class as it be
S0241	yeah if there's not many
S0240	if there's not many yeah and if there's it's all silence and they don't want to talk about it then then it could be tell your partner
S0238	mm
S0240	tell your
S0238	well group
S0240	you yeah yeah
S0238	couldn't you
S0240	that would do yeah tell each other
S0241	er we just ask people and then i i think they'll say something
S0240	mm
S0238	well by that point they've they've sort of be in the room for a while they should be warm up a bite shouldn't they
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	it depend how much they join in as it's go through i mean it would nice if they do
S0241	they might
S0240	yeah and sort of chip in with examples from their own international experience
S0241	mm
S0238	well i mean also
S0240	they might or might not have that
S0238	if if we have have a bite at the begin of which culture they've have experience of and so on
S0240	mm
S0238	and i can remember who's who's say what when i might be able to
S0240	yeah
S0238	look at specific people and say when
S0240	mm
S0238	you know when you be in turkey what do you you know that sort of thing as well as
S0240	yeah
S0238	erm what do you think
S0241	well you see if we have a flip chart
S0238	yeah
S0238	we might be able to get one of us might be able to write down somebody's name and the countries or something like that
S0240	mm
S0238	yeah
S0241	or just a few point as we go
S0238	i mean obviously
S0241	so we've get it as a reference
S0238	it would be good if we'd get some people with different
S0241	yeah
S0238	first languages
S0240	yeah yeah
S0238	or different culture but even if they haven't if they've be in other place then we could ask
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	er and then we've get the final quote here
S0238	mm
S0241	er and then i've just put erm with the final quote and so erm that actually but it's always worth remember that it's more about cos we will remind them it's not stereotype
S0240	yeah
S0241	they're all individuals
S0238	mm
S0241	but it be much more about everybody be of course an individual in every in these culture
S0240	yeah
S0238	mm
S0241	and that it be more about be sensitive to others and adjust it to other
S0240	mm
S0241	other people's norms especially if you're sell to them erm than than have hard and fast rule with these
S0240	and also don't you think you know it's likely that as as business become more internationalise that you know all these differences will become lesser become diminish because of you know i mean in the same way that language have become reduce to a simplify version of language i think it's likely that a lot of the differences will be smooth out over time and probably that process be start to happen at the moment
S0238	maybe
S0240	i think that's quite an interest question of whether they
S0241	maybe
S0240	whether they think that
S0238	but
S0241	mm
S0238	but i think i think we've a lot way to go before that happen
S0240	mm
S0241	mm
S0238	and i think there's a danger if you're speak the same if you're all speak english of make the assumption that
S0240	yeah well yeah
S0238	that you're sing from the same hymn sheet
S0240	mm
S0241	mm
S0238	you know
S0240	that's quite a that's a nice point to finish on as well yeah
S0238	i mean i've have that experience with with germans who will often speak really good english
S0240	yeah
S0238	but be quite abrupt the way they would be in german
S0240	mm
S0238	and they come across as rude
S0240	yeah
S0238	and and that's why germans have this reputation for be rude not because they be
S0240	mm
S0238	cos what they're say wouldn't be rude in their own language
S0240	yeah
S0238	but in english it be erm and i think again because they speak english it it's both side be make assumptions because their english be so good
S0240	yes yeah
S0238	that that they've get the culture right as well
S0240	that's an interest point isn't it i think that's yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	worth mention
S0241	and then i think the only thing i've write at the end oh i you i just i'd i don't think you need to put that cos it's just a lot of word to read why don't you say how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language do we need that first line even though it be his quote but do it matter
S0240	let's see
S0241	after all when you come right down to it how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language
S0240	you don't think that we need that quote at all no
S0241	i don't think we need that first line
S0240	no
S0241	i think we just say how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language and then you make that point that you've just make
S0240	yeah mm
S0238	erm well i wasn't necessarily go to read those out i be gonna leave them on the thing
S0240	yeah you could just leave them
S0241	yeah
S0238	if you change that you can't make that into a capital h that's the actual quotation you'd have to have a dot dot dot and a small h wouldn't you
S0241	er
S0238	it's not the begin
S0241	if you be academic yeah if you're in a business meet no it just look odd
S0241	you know what's it matter how exact your quotation you know he do say this it's just not the start of the sentence but it actually doesn't matter do it in a you know in in the rest of the world it doesn't actually matter
S0240	no it doesn't
S0241	in real life whether they do or not
S0238	i don't my
S0240	they might expect speakers from a university in case they've be through the process
S0238	yeah
S0240	of study and academics together but
S0241	i doubt well they're not even gonna know nobody's gonna go actually i i know that quote
S0241	and it's not the start of the sentence
S0238	no as i say i i be just gonna put the the slide up and talk rather than read i don't really believe in read read things off slide
S0241	no i don't think you need to no i'm not suggest you read it out but
S0240	just something to leave you with
S0241	to leave them with
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah erm but i just don't think you need as many word
S0240	in a way i mean in a way one would be better than two as a final thing to leave them with because
S0241	mm
S0238	well i put that other thing in because i like both of those
S0240	cos once they sit in silence to yeah
S0238	but yes you're right
S0240	it always go back to the audience you're try to reach and the way they think about their problems i think that one
S0238	you think yeah
S0240	just leave that
S0241	yeah i think that first one yeah
S0240	yeah yeah cos it's and then in fact if you be gonna have just that one you might as well have the whole one cos it's not too much
S0238	i
S0241	oh yeah
S0240	too many word
S0238	i think it's more
S0241	mm yeah
S0240	but that one's get it's nice
S0241	mm
S0238	but it be more round with that bite with that
S0240	yeah
S0241	mm it be more round i be just think cos it's a lot of word
S0238	it might be yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	but but yeah just put one actually because we're call it speak the language that's good isn't it
S0240	yeah it go back to the begin
S0241	mm
S0238	yes right
S0241	we nail it
S0238	jolly good
S0241	so that's a big one and then so you do that get to the end of that and then say so you know so we've look at how this these different aspects of culture relate to erm the business environment so we're just gonna look now at a few email and how to see this in practice with some email and then we've get the handout with the email and everything which be this one here so we'll have do that one
S0240	what time would it be here then we've do ten minutes on the introductions half an hour on the
S0241	agree disagree
S0240	on the agree disagree
S0241	well for the whole
S0240	and then
S0238	so
S0240	that's forty
S0241	and then
S0240	and so how long for the slide to plan
S0241	and then forty minutes on the slide
S0240	forty minutes okay
S0241	and then ten minutes on this final
S0240	yeah
S0241	or thirty five forty minutes on the slide and then this final thing here which be this what
S0240	ten minutes
S0241	erm yeah i mean i've print up all three page out for us but actually you'd only give them the first one
S0240	i be wonder if there's any way i try to do it but didn't have time to do it properly be be to get erm you know an email look format pro forma or whatever you call it to put them in cos it would just look it would look much nicer
S0241	oh
S0240	on the page
S0241	mm
S0240	i don't know if you know how to do that
S0238	oh yeah
S0240	i try for a bite but i think i be go to be late for the meet if i carry on do it with my i'm sure you can
S0241	mm
S0240	but it just it would just look
S0241	mm it would be yeah you're right
S0240	yeah
S0241	it would look better
S0238	i'll play about with that
S0241	mm
S0238	and see if i can work out what to do
S0240	what would you call it pro forma or
S0238	have you get the er
S0241	shall i send it i'll send it to you
S0238	yeah the yeah
S0241	to play with yeah
S0240	i mean it might just be a question of somehow drag a copy paste delete and then inputting i don't know but
S0238	well i'll try i'll try do that yeah
S0240	in the short time i try it i couldn't do that but
S0241	you could somehow you know you could do print screen can't you so if you have it
S0240	oh a screenshot yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	you could do a screenshot so you could like create an email that say this somehow and then print screen and you'd get it but i don't know how it would work see how it go but then so you would then need on this but i would think won't we just all as anybody else could chip in any time
S0238	at this point we'll all chip in
S0241	yeah
S0238	yes i think so
S0241	but it er what about during the powerpoint itself
S0238	i don't know what do you think
S0241	you've always you've gotta be aware of the time
S0238	mm
S0241	but it might help to move it along at time and things like that
S0240	what to chip in with stories
S0241	if like we chip in at the same time
S0240	well i think so cos it vary it as well
S0241	yeah
S0240	but only if well you could you know you could indicate when you want a a story or mm you know
S0241	you won't know when i've get one though
S0238	no
S0240	well if you do because you've
S0241	but i think if we just
S0240	well you've be say
S0241	yeah but she wouldn't know you wouldn't at that moment you won't necessarily think oh 's get a story about that or yeah and
S0240	mm
S0241	but i think it i would imagine we just play it by ear on the day and we're conscious about time as well so you're not
S0238	mm
S0241	chip in too many of of erm if we see the time's go and then we've get ten minutes to do this one
S0240	mm
S0238	i certainly think with any kind of thing when we're elicit things from them or
S0241	try and let them talk
S0238	that that yes but
S0240	yeah
S0238	but it's fine for any to to
S0241	yeah
S0238	to chip in at that point
S0241	yeah as long as they get a chance to speak as well
S0238	you know so
S0241	so yeah and so yeah so then you'll introduce this exercise
S0238	mm
S0241	wouldn't you about erm the scenario and erm and why do they think and then i've put on the next page which we wouldn't give to them
S0238	no right
S0241	but the next page be kind of the answer that you might want to point out to them on the next two and that i think that's the original one so the next page tell you the answer be it that way so
S0240	yeah
S0241	so if you have a go at that and send it back to us then we can get it change
S0240	do you really think we can do this in ten minutes cos even just for them to read them it's gonna
S0241	actually it's not
S0240	you know
S0241	it's gonna take more than ten minutes isn't it
S0240	it's gonna take more than ten minutes definitely
S0241	mm
S0240	for them to read them give their ideas and then decide
S0241	we need to shorten the agree and disagree a bite
S0240	i would say so actually
S0241	mm
S0240	anyway because
S0241	it's a bite long anyway
S0240	yeah yeah
S0241	or be it that be something i be gonna bring up earlier actually so let's say
S0240	or or ask them to look at the first oh er you know to start with and then have three as a well they're quite nice all sort of all them aren't they
S0241	well they need all three cos it's
S0240	yeah they do no yeah they do need all three
S0241	so if we say that the agree and disagree be twenty minutes instead of thirty
S0240	mm
S0241	and then you've get twenty minutes for the email haven't you you've get twenty minutes to do that so that would be better let's do it that way
S0240	mm
S0241	right
S0240	twenty
S0241	okay so then so then you do that bite and then i have create this well you create it this handout here about and this be the purple that i'm gonna use
S0240	oh yeah right
S0241	erm
S0240	oh that's good yeah
S0241	this erm this handout for them and on the back i've put some quote so there's the quote i mean
S0238	mm yes
S0241	bits of the first one and the most important thing be probably you know be
S0240	i like that that's good
S0241	you know what it be what it be he say
S0238	you could of course have make the outline of those purple as well
S0241	i just want to vary it i do it on both
S0241	i just think it's sort of a bite bore if it's just all purple
S0240	yeah
S0241	but do you think it should be purple
S0238	i don't think it really matter
S0240	i think i would centralise those it would look better
S0238	okay
S0241	oh yeah yeah
S0240	it's just
S0238	mm
S0240	you know it's just
S0238	well you've get the less
S0240	the way it sit
S0238	you've get your version with with those on
S0241	i'll do it
S0238	so you do it
S0241	yeah okay yeah i can do that
S0238	and oh yeah erm
S0241	and
S0238	no i be just gonna say they're actually in they look fairly small print don't they but
S0241	mm
S0238	if you make it any bigger it would be a longer box
S0241	i'll look at that
S0238	so that's probably not such a good idea
S0241	yeah i see how it work
S0240	or could it be two columns there and one in the middle there i don't know cos they do look a little bite small compare to the other one
S0238	yeah yeah
S0241	mm
S0238	anyway
S0240	or could they be randomise you know dot around
S0241	then it's hard to read isn't it
S0238	that be
S0240	oh
S0238	yeah that's
S0241	i don't think it i think it's big enough to read
S0240	no it's just it's
S0241	so
S0240	okay
S0241	er and then i have this other handout for some point or other erm which be the
S0240	oh the one you send yeah
S0241	which we be maybe do at the end
S0240	mm
S0241	a handout at the end to them erm
S0238	mm
S0241	cos i don't know how we're gonna hand all these handouts out some of them we need to give them at the time cos they're do it like the agree and disagree
S0238	yes
S0241	they're yours but others
S0238	i think that's probably at the end of the session
S0240	yeah
S0241	and the end of the session
S0238	yeah
S0241	but what do we give them to them in
S0240	we need a little pack yeah which one erm
S0241	we're not gonna give them it i don't know what pack we give them though because we haven't actually get unless and have like a little folder we can put them in
S0238	well be this another be this another question to ask her
S0241	yeah
S0238	because ideally i would say that they should be give a i mean either you give them a folder at the end with various things that we're only hand out at the end in and they can put everything that we've work on that they've have during the sessions
S0241	yeah
S0238	into it as well
S0240	mm
S0241	mm
S0238	or you give them the folder at the begin with the first handout and say you'll be get other things that you can put in there
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	i mean either way would work wouldn't it but
S0240	yeah that would be good
S0241	yeah
S0238	but if we're suppose to be provide a folder then we need to know
S0241	so we'll ask cos we can't provide one cos you're not go to have one with on necessarily
S0238	no
S0241	so i'll ask her if she's get a folder and if not we just hand these out at the end
S0240	mm
S0238	yeah
S0241	erm so so that would be in purple and so if you look through these at some point when we get point and see if there's anything that you want me to change and there's your chance
S0240	can we give some examples when we
S0238	we've do that already haven't we
S0240	we've do it
S0240	oh okay for maintain good relationships
S0241	well but that's the whole thing by the time they get to this
S0238	i think this
S0241	they'll have have load of examples from you won't they
S0238	i yeah this be just
S0240	oh okay
S0238	a summary of what we've be say
S0240	yeah so first name conventions the use of first name or honorific title do you think that's a bite use of you know could be phrase in more in simpler international english type language
S0238	well this this be
S0240	diverse name conventions
S0238	mm
S0240	and honorific title sound a bite
S0241	i've change that now yeah i've change that since yeah how be we gonna name that word that then consider
S0238	oh i think that's fine
S0240	oh
S0241	i i could put consider different countries' name con
S0240	yeah
S0241	name conventions use of first name and title not necessarily you know
S0240	title yeah
S0238	yeah
S0240	yeah i think it's good mm
S0238	yeah
S0240	very good
S0241	so i mean this thing at the end i don't know whether i need to put this if it's just a handout that we're not actually give them then i don't necessarily need to sort of point out you don't need to put that
S0240	no
S0241	what would how would i put that by the way
S0240	or not just these tip be useful why not with a capital
S0238	i would i'd just start with these tip be useful
S0240	yeah
S0238	and don't and don't put that way
S0240	cos you've you've say to cut out word as best as you can
S0241	yeah so those two be use for domestic email communication too
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	or don't forget these tip for email be very useful for or these tip be useful for domestic communication too right that's that yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	right
S0240	erm well it's a silly very small thing but there should be a space after the ten point it's
S0241	oh yeah no you're right
S0240	yeah i don't know why things like that catch my eye
S0241	yeah no that's good
S0238	yes they do me as well
S0240	yeah but when i write them they don't
S0238	yeah
S0240	and when other people write them
S0241	yeah
S0241	so yeah excellent thank you
S0238	yeah
S0241	so then er so that will be hand out at some point er so then after we've do your thing by this will be the break now so then we'll come back after the break and get a
S0240	the break's fifteen minutes
S0238	mm
S0241	the break's fifteen minutes and then we're and then we'll be play er in the second half i mean originally what we'd say be erm that in the second half we'll so in the second half we're look at use international english for effective business communication that's what we're call it in meet and in meet and email
S0240	meet and email and i'm gonna start start off by talk about yeah
S0241	and this be where you start off and we say well first of all we're gonna look at use so the theme be be language isn't it it's try to point out and it's language and we use erm so how we use language when write email first of all erm whereas the this one before be about culture isn't it
S0238	mm
S0241	more than the language
S0238	yes
S0241	so actually we've gotta make sure we remember that that when we're do this one it's not about look at specific
S0240	yeah
S0241	well language items as that it's about look at
S0238	yeah
S0240	yeah well that can come in the introduction oh yeah we have one yeah
S0241	the high context and time and that kind of thing but not specific sentence the way that they they word it but more about
S0240	culture
S0241	the culture so the first half be all about culture and you can say what it's about at the begin of the day the first half of the day be about culture
S0238	well i mean that's when you're look at the programme
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	and the second half be more about the language that we use
S0238	yeah
S0241	and so you say we'll be look at international english and how erm in email and then in speak meet and that and in meet as well and that you're gonna start off with this
S0240	and meet
S0241	i think international english have a capital i because it's it's actually it's like academic english
S0240	right yeah
S0238	it be yes it's an english language
S0240	yeah
S0241	actually you've put it in later so but yeah this look really haven't look through it properly yet so i'll just have a look no it have get an extra page on the end
S0238	that's right
S0241	that we need

S0238	and to get rid of them you click on it again
S0240	okay
S0241	and highlight it yeah so erm
S0240	highlight and click again i just reduce it to one quote because i think it be enough you don't need it again
S0241	yeah that's enough
S0238	yeah yeah
S0241	international english be a simplify version of english use between business people around the world to help them i wouldn't say it's a lingua i
S0240	i like that phrase though a lingua franca
S0241	cos we're linguists that's why we like it but
S0241	i just think god if i say that to like or
S0240	okay okay
S0241	well like it
S0240	okay
S0241	but my dad or you know i just think nobody know what it mean apart from us
S0240	okay get rid of it okay
S0238	so use between business people around the world to help my communications so you don't
S0241	yeah
S0238	you just
S0241	to help make communication clearer and easier to understand
S0240	it's a bite the same isn't it clearer and easier to understand but i think it's
S0238	well
S0240	it's a yeah well cos
S0241	yeah and then you've get a bite about yeah we've say that be a limit range of vocabulary
S0240	and you didn't want me to go into anything about international english establish as a way of you know that as it's become the sort of way that people learn the language as well as the way that people speak the language you know
S0241	be it
S0240	well yeah in a way it be if you look at text book and things not the you know the ones that be teach in the uk cos they're still teach the english students but a lot of international
S0238	i think that that's something that's interest for language teachers
S0240	for us yeah yeah yeah
S0238	but not really language students
S0240	i've get to i've gotta stop myself
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah erm but no it's very clear
S0238	yes
S0241	yeah erm see i always think that when i'm give an example about the limit range of vocabulary i always say you know think about when you be learn french or whatever language you lean at school
S0240	yeah
S0241	you know would you know the word chair or seat or deckchair or bench
S0240	yeah
S0241	and that you know they're all sort of things to sit on but if you just say chair each time people understand it much better than
S0240	chair bench
S0241	deckchair and seat
S0240	seat deckchair yeah
S0241	seat
S0240	yeah
S0241	people er
S0238	they don't know a deckchair they'll know the other three
S0241	and so
S0240	people understand you don't need all the
S0241	but you don't you know if out of those
S0240	and people and when it come to the specialise stuff they understand it anyway
S0241	yeah
S0240	cos it's their their field yeah
S0241	their field yeah
S0240	erm
S0241	so yes so look at these follow extract from email and decide what you think the writer intend to say how could they have write it more clearly so you're gonna ask them you see that's something i think you could just ask them to do with somebody sit near them
S0240	yes
S0238	yeah
S0240	do it with a partner
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	er so start off this be you know these be people who be not use international english
S0241	mm
S0240	and have not present their ideas very clearly
S0241	yeah
S0240	can you help them
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	and at the begin of when you start the second session off i would just remind them that you know in the first half we've look at culture
S0240	yeah at that yeah
S0241	now we're go to look at language
S0240	yeah language yeah
S0241	yeah your write and speak
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm so there's the activity oh and the time
S0240	yeah
S0241	be oh you're do half the time then aren't you the other half of the time more or less isn't it
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	i mean i i might not take too long
S0241	for that
S0240	because it depend how quickly i've reduce it a bite
S0241	mm
S0240	so i just you know i'm gonna try and go through this really quickly
S0241	but i can make it the other bite as long as
S0240	yeah
S0241	as we like and it doesn't matter if you finish slightly earlier and people get back from their fifteen minute break slightly late so
S0238	yes yeah
S0241	it kind of it'll work out
S0240	so roughly how long well it's er how
S0241	forty five minutes roughly
S0240	for me i don't think i'll need that long actually
S0241	because it's an hour and a half altogether
S0240	but but yeah
S0241	you know even if it's half an hour or something
S0240	mm
S0241	it doesn't matter so they'll decide this unless you fail to inform us
S0240	well that be the double negative triple negative
S0241	but nobody would ever say unless you fail to inform us it's if you fail
S0240	it's an exaggerate version in a way
S0241	but even if you say if you fail to inform us of your inability it's still difficult to understand
S0240	yeah
S0241	nobody would ever say
S0240	well i'll change it if you like but
S0241	they cos cos nobody would write be that authentic
S0240	it it well it be semi authentic
S0241	yeah i don't think that i don't think anybody would ever write that i think they'd say unless you inform us of your inability
S0240	okay if
S0241	or if you fail to or or unless you i don't think they'd ever say unless and fail i don't think anybody would ever say both
S0238	no no
S0240	okay unless you
S0238	unless you
S0240	inform
S0238	inform us in advance of your inability to
S0241	well i would i would keep fail
S0238	that's still confuse enough
S0240	unless yeah unless you
S0241	i would keep fail i cos i think unless be far more difficult to explain to somebody whose native
S0240	okay if you fail
S0241	if you fail to inform
S0238	if you fail to inform us in advance of your inability to attend the event you will be bill
S0241	you will not be bill
S0240	will not be bill for those presentations
S0241	if you
S0240	have a
S0238	if you fail to then you will be
S0241	ah
S0240	well the thing be it's mean to be a little bite funny you know
S0241	it's mean to be unless unless you fail to inform us
S0240	yeah i mean the thing be it's an exaggerate version
S0238	yeah
S0240	and i don't think that matter you know
S0241	you will not be bill
S0240	but the point of it be that what do they actually want to say
S0241	but i just can't get my head around it to my honest i can't the way it's write at the moment i can't even start to do anything with it's it's it's
S0241	it's so unauthentic and so many negative that i just don't think anybody would write it
S0240	okay
S0241	and i can't actually process it
S0241	so
S0240	wait unless you okay
S0241	if you fail to inform us
S0238	well what it's basically say be
S0241	of your inability to attend
S0238	tell us tell us in advance that you can't come otherwise we'll make you
S0240	make you pay yeah
S0238	you'll have to pay for it
S0241	unless you inform us actually it's if you wanna make it like unless you inform us of your inability
S0238	you will be bill
S0241	ah but then it's you will be bill
S0238	for those presentations
S0241	yeah i mean you could put unless in and say well actually that mean they've get
S0240	but all they've get to do really be i i mean i'll change it if you like
S0238	that's alright
S0240	but all they've get to do be put a clear message
S0238	yeah
S0240	and write
S0238	but i mean
S0240	you know
S0241	i just find it really hard at the moment because i just think that be so unauthentic
S0240	okay
S0238	i think if you
S0240	okay
S0241	that i just would i can't i wouldn't even able to process it
S0238	if you change that to unless you inform us you will be bill that's still quite confuse
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	and there's still plenty of negative in there and it's
S0240	unless you inform us in advance of your inability to attend the event you will
S0238	will be bill
S0240	will be bill
S0241	yeah
S0240	that's easy though will be be for the presentations where you cannot avoid miss yeah no that's enough actually i agree
S0238	no i think that's enough there
S0241	yeah and then yeah
S0240	yeah yeah that's enough you don't want to
S0241	unless you inform us
S0240	give them too much of a hard time
S0241	in advance of your inability to attend you will be bill
S0240	yeah
S0241	so and so what be you expect them to write as the answer
S0240	erm not to write anything but just to say
S0241	or to say
S0240	erm you know please let us know if you cannot attend er otherwise
S0238	if you don't
S0240	yeah if you don't if if you if you do not let us
S0238	if you
S0240	if you do not inform us of
S0241	if i be you i would write it out first
S0240	we yeah no i will
S0238	yes
S0240	write out the answer
S0241	mm
S0238	probably make yes probably make two as you say we're do there make two sentence
S0240	yeah
S0238	yeah please inform us before
S0241	yeah definitely yeah
S0240	definitely yeah
S0241	but if i be you i would write the answer cos otherwise when you're actually explain it to them you'll you'll you'll
S0240	yeah
S0241	it it's hard to just think it up on the day
S0240	yeah yeah don't worry i will
S0241	yeah
S0240	i'll
S0241	i'm not convince that this be really the best approach to this problem also i'm a little concern about your the budget for this project it seem to be rather on the optimistic side mm
S0240	well because what they're try to say be it's a load of rubbish you know
S0241	mm
S0240	but they're phrase it such couch it in such you know
S0238	mm
S0240	diplomatic language that the
S0241	yeah no
S0240	the real message be not get across
S0238	yeah
S0241	mm
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah and so what would you so you think about what you want to say
S0240	well erm i i haven't look at it for a while i just paste this one on erm
S0240	also i'm a little concern about the budget for this project well i don't know i haven't er i i can't think about it so
S0241	so have a think have a think about what you would actually
S0240	yeah i will yeah
S0241	want them to say
S0240	yeah
S0241	but actually you don't need to actually you although you would leave it in here the answer doesn't need to include budget you could say i'm not erm oh i'm concern about
S0240	the cost
S0241	the approach
S0240	yeah
S0241	and the budget or even the yeah i suppose that i'm concern about the approach and the and the budget for this project
S0240	yeah
S0238	i don't think they're very realistic
S0241	yeah i don't think they're very realistic
S0240	don't think they're realistic i can concern
S0241	yeah cos this rather on the optimistic you know it's er it's optimistic it's very
S0240	it's very typical british language
S0238	yeah
S0241	it's very it's what people say
S0240	of when you don't want to hurt offend somebody
S0241	yeah mm yeah
S0240	and you want to put it so diplomatically isn't it and that's what they might do but it would not be there's no way anybody could understand that
S0238	no
S0240	however good their english be
S0241	yeah
S0240	they just wouldn't pick up the message
S0241	mm mm
S0240	and that's the point i be want to make with that one
S0241	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0240	so it's a i suppose it's more perhaps no it's language it be language
S0241	yeah
S0238	mm
S0240	because you know
S0238	it be language yes
S0240	because er a native speaker would immediate realise that
S0241	they're
S0240	that person who's not convince but
S0241	yeah cos i mean the things like i'm not sure that this be the approach to this see even just something as simple as i'm not sure that this be the best approach to this problem
S0238	yeah
S0241	be enough i think cos it's like say what you're say be this isn't the best approach to this problem but
S0241	but you've still get to phrase it in a polite way to international audience haven't you
S0238	no oh well you're say that's enough of a i mean you've get
S0241	yeah it's enough of a complication
S0240	yeah
S0241	i be not sure that this be the best approach to this problem
S0240	it mean that you're
S0241	doesn't mean that you're not sure that it's the best it mean you know it's not
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	doesn't it
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm
S0240	well do you want me to change it to sure but the but why because that's more
S0241	i'm not convince
S0240	british though
S0241	yeah that's the same yeah it doesn't matter
S0240	yeah erm
S0238	i i think
S0241	this be fine though
S0238	it's
S0240	mm
S0238	i think it's okay
S0241	okay
S0238	i mean i know what you're say be that you've get three sentence there and they've all get issue and therefore it's quite complicate
S0241	yeah
S0238	but er no i think it's er it's the whole thing
S0241	see i don't think you need the middle one i just think you just say i'm not convince this be really the best approach to this problem it seem to be rather i don't know
S0240	do you mean make it a bite shorter
S0241	just make it shorter
S0240	i'm not convince this be the best approach to this problem maybe that's enough
S0241	problem er
S0238	well i don't i think no i think it's fine
S0241	yeah just leave it and then you just discuss
S0238	i think it's a
S0241	yeah
S0238	it's a good example
S0241	yeah
S0238	of a chunk of
S0241	of the
S0238	of that kind of person's language
S0241	complicate yeah
S0240	over diplomatic
S0241	but then just think about
S0240	where the meaning's lose
S0241	way how you might say it
S0238	and the the whole thing be quite long
S0240	well what what what would we say then
S0238	that mm
S0240	what would we say instead then erm erm i'm worry about i'm worry or er even
S0241	see you don't necessarily even do we need to have an actual i mean you need to have in your head an idea but but actually what you would say in reality you know that it's just if you be we would say that quite a lot with we're contribute it as a speakers now on culture cos
S0238	yeah
S0241	we know that people would understand it but they'd actually erm if you be say it to
S0240	please can we discuss the budget for this project
S0241	mm the budget yeah
S0240	erm i i've i be concern that we may need more you know something like that please can we discuss isn't it
S0241	yeah
S0240	you need a call for action
S0241	yeah
S0240	we discuss i mean i actually write an email very similar to this my niece send me erm she's suppose to be create a a book for my
S0241	mm
S0240	my father's ninetieth birthday and she's collect all his write that he's do all through his life together
S0241	mm
S0240	and have them publish she it's on the twentieth of october and she hasn't actually do anything yet
S0238	oh
S0240	so and she say oh i'll send it to the publishers it'll take about a week to be do so i send back an email which be really similar to this you know
S0241	mm
S0238	yeah
S0240	it's like i think that's slightly on the optimistic side there may be some you know holdups and delay that we have to
S0238	yeah
S0240	allow for please ensure that you know that it do it doesn't
S0241	see maybe in this one you don't actually need to write it in a better like the first one you might say think about a better way to put it
S0240	yeah
S0241	what do they intend to say think about a better way the second i know you're ask the question in the instructions but in this second one you maybe you don't need to actually have a
S0240	no
S0241	you maybe just need to get the get across the point that actually they mean this be a problem
S0240	yeah it's
S0241	and it's not rather on the optimistic side it's totally unrealistic
S0238	yes
S0240	okay so it's not how could she have write it more clearly so what do you think the writer intend to say i could get rid of that second instruction couldn't she couldn't i
S0241	well i think you leave it but you don't necessarily need to do it every
S0240	okay
S0241	every question necessarily
S0238	yeah well see whether they come with something
S0241	see what they come up with
S0238	i mean it be a tricky one
S0241	yeah
S0238	in that you you've get this issue of face and if you say i'm sorry i think that your solution be really your solution and your cost be really unrealistic
S0241	mm
S0238	you're be quite rude and and put them down
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0238	but at the same time if you say it like this they're not gonna understand what you mean
S0240	yeah
S0238	erm
S0241	but you could say i think i think probably your answer be something to do with can we discuss the
S0238	yes so maybe a solution be
S0241	the quote so can we discuss this problem and the budget in a bite more detail
S0240	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	erm
S0238	so maybe so you can
S0241	but look at different ways to solve it or something
S0240	or yeah how to finish it
S0241	or something like that
S0238	yeah
S0241	rather than say this isn't work say can we
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	can we look at this again can we discuss this problem again
S0238	so you can link that you know there's a language problem here which be not
S0241	right
S0238	that it's not the mean isn't clear but
S0240	problem with language
S0238	if you go for really clear language you've get a cultural problem there
S0241	yeah mm
S0240	yeah to can we discuss this problem again and the budget in more detail to make sure that erm you know it well
S0238	well not even that
S0240	no
S0241	can we can we discuss it in in more detail
S0240	in more detail
S0241	can we discuss this problem in the budget a bite more
S0240	yeah
S0241	right
S0240	balance of
S0238	and yes i think it's a good idea to use a word like worry cos
S0241	mm
S0238	if you be go to you know
S0240	cos they will want to yeah
S0238	i'm a little bite worry about if you want to
S0240	yeah
S0238	you know but cos
S0241	but even i'm a little bite worry be take a lot
S0240	it mean it's cast doubt on
S0238	yes it be it's true yeah
S0240	yeah cast doubt on the first the first but then that's that be what you want to say
S0238	but if you then if you then do that can we please discuss it
S0240	yeah it's it's actually call for action
S0241	yeah can we please discuss it
S0238	yes
S0240	and that's the main thing
S0241	yeah
S0240	you you've get something you want them to do and that's always it should you know
S0241	yeah yeah
S0240	erm
S0238	and then please give me your answer by the end of the week it do matter whether i have it on friday
S0240	oh i don't really particularly like that one actually please give me your answer by the end of the week it do matter whether i have it i can't i i leave that one in cos i i just copy it in but that's not the brilliant one i
S0241	you could either look for a different one or just have two
S0240	yeah
S0241	couldn't you
S0240	yeah alright
S0238	but i think well cos i actually think that a native speaker would look at that and think do they mean doesn't or do they actually mean do
S0241	yeah when i first read it i think it mean doesn't but it do mean do
S0238	it do mean do yes
S0240	but it's not clear be it
S0241	sure
S0238	no
S0240	no
S0238	no i mean i agree it's not very clear but
S0240	it's not mean to be but i mean but it's
S0241	yeah
S0238	i'm not sure that that's a
S0240	no i don't
S0238	a native speaker
S0240	no
S0238	or a non native speaker lack of clarity which be what we want to focus on isn't it
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah i i think i'll look for a new one
S0241	yeah
S0240	but if you anybody else find one they can send it to me but i'll look for another one
S0241	or just two
S0240	or just two
S0241	it give you something which you know give you enough to talk about
S0240	yeah
S0241	right and then all of this
S0240	i've just
S0241	there's be lot of examples how be you gonna
S0240	go through it
S0241	go through it mm
S0240	well i mean i i think i think i might number them but then i when i try to do it everything jump around in the box and it wouldn't fit on the page and things but i think that would be easier because then at least if time's run short or whatever i i i don't have to go through it all anyway i could just refer them to number three or number seven and talk about that one like you do
S0241	i think you need number you're right yeah but put it in here
S0238	have you tell your computer not to do automatic number
S0240	no no but if
S0238	it's full of
S0240	i already have the grid you see
S0238	yeah but what i'm
S0240	and
S0241	but put it inside your grid
S0240	yeah i try to i try to yeah
S0241	put your number there
S0238	what i'm say be
S0241	you try it and it didn't work
S0238	my computer doesn't do anything that i don't
S0241	you can jump you can jump them around then
S0240	oh i oh i
S0238	if it's not do automatic
S0240	oh i know what you mean yeah
S0238	if it's not do automatic number then you just type a one and a and a dot and a space and a two and a dot and a space
S0240	but for some reason it it
S0241	and it jump it about and everything
S0240	it push everything around in the grid and it and it
S0238	but if you
S0240	it you know it go off the page and
S0238	it's should be in auto correct
S0240	mm
S0238	and you un tick everything you can possibly un tick it's the first thing i do when i get a new computer
S0240	really didn't realise
S0238	it drive me crackers when it's try to do things i don't want it to do
S0240	i'll have another go er
S0241	but if you can't do it
S0238	if you can't do it
S0241	just when you've do when you've get your final version and you've change your little bits
S0240	yeah i'll send it back yeah
S0241	send it back and just say to me put the number in and we'll put them in
S0238	yeah we'll manage it somehow
S0240	erm pit language pitfalls shall i put
S0241	yeah
S0238	yes
S0240	mm pitfalls and i don't i don't think i'd need capitals in all of that either
S0238	that be a good example of front
S0240	no
S0238	language pitfalls shall i put
S0240	and how how should be should it how to avoid shouldn't be in and then shouldn't be yeah
S0241	no just i mean these days
S0240	yeah
S0241	people don't put capitals
S0240	no
S0241	for every word and erm
S0240	just the language pitfalls
S0241	i do wonder whether you get them to do something with it
S0238	mm
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah and
S0238	well obviously otherwise it's it will be as it
S0241	cos otherwise how do we go through it
S0240	yeah
S0241	and maybe you could take out every other one or something so like give them the first one and say here's a clear example or give them the first or give them
S0238	the first three or
S0240	or get them to write some of the
S0238	do you think you could give them the first three or something like that
S0240	yeah
S0238	and then erm
S0240	and then get them to write clear examples and then flash up the some answer so that they can compare
S0241	yeah
S0238	well we can hand out a we can hand out your version in the if we're hand give out
S0241	handouts
S0238	handouts at the end anyway
S0240	yeah
S0241	we can do that can't we
S0241	we can give yours out at the end
S0238	erm
S0240	yeah i think do a few of them
S0241	yeah cos you could do the first four or something like that
S0238	so that the
S0241	so have it write in
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm
S0240	four together
S0241	yeah
S0240	and i might change the order
S0238	mm
S0240	of the first four
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	but i quite like this old fashion over formal thing i mean you make them think about this cos i bet they'll find it hard you might put the first one we acknowledge receipt or thank you for send
S0240	yeah
S0241	and let them think about the other ones
S0240	mm
S0241	cos i think it's quite difficult for them to you know if you if you put the first if that in that box you put the first one and let them and leave the others blank
S0240	mm
S0241	i think it would be a
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	good thing for them
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes that would be a good one yes
S0240	the first would go and and the
S0241	and the same with that at this time now
S0240	others blank sorry be the same as
S0238	the the with the next one where you've get quite a lot at this time and now
S0240	oh yeah
S0238	and that one would be
S0240	those ones
S0241	and then you leave the others ones
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0238	erm
S0241	i mean but things like the abbreviations you'd just leave that one in as this be the answer isn't it
S0240	yeah
S0241	and so
S0238	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	erm and not don't leave the passives blank because they might not know what a passive be
S0241	they'll not
S0240	no
S0241	they'll not know how to do it yeah
S0238	for instance
S0240	yeah you remember we talk about that and you say there wasn't another way of say so we have to put
S0241	so let's talk about the ones
S0238	but
S0241	that you'd actually put in i would put i i would give them this give them the first one with him
S0238	yeah
S0241	as an example cos that's hard
S0238	mm
S0241	erm and
S0238	oh i have a question about about that one actually that by and then the before i find that sentence a bite weird
S0240	yeah
S0238	erm
S0240	please send me and advise four pm standard time before we
S0241	on on
S0238	and why not on wednesday the fifteenth of august
S0240	well by the yeah
S0238	or
S0240	or just a comma when no because if you say on it's get to be send on that day hasn't it but i want
S0241	no cos it's by
S0238	no it's by
S0240	please send by me
S0241	by four on four o'clock in august
S0240	by four pm standard time mm
S0241	by this time on that day
S0240	i think you just have a comma
S0238	well that's kind of i don't
S0240	by four pm standard time
S0241	i would
S0238	an american way of do it but but
S0241	yeah
S0240	wednesday the fifteenth of august
S0238	but but it doesn't
S0241	i wouldn't i'd always put on
S0240	cos it otherwise it say it it suggest that you're gonna post it on the or fifteenth of august to me
S0240	no it's by
S0238	i don't think so cos the by
S0240	okay
S0238	of of the
S0240	okay
S0241	that time on that date
S0240	okay yeah
S0241	yeah so i would them that one and give them this one and the delivery arrive yesterday we hope to
S0240	they're quite a bite bore some of those they could go further down but they be
S0241	yeah you can move them further down
S0240	they be classic ones aren't they
S0241	but i would give them yeah i would give them them
S0240	yeah
S0241	and then leave
S0240	erm
S0241	the date the date one and let them think about that and can i call you at four o'clock
S0240	yeah
S0241	leave that blank and see if they can work out what's wrong with that
S0240	leave
S0238	yeah
S0240	and leave blank and leave blank
S0241	and then give them the i'm up to my ears but leave the other one blank and you just need to explain to them in some box there's more than one that they maybe put some line so they know
S0238	yes
S0241	to fill it in
S0240	yeah
S0241	like you know not long enough for them to write
S0240	yeah
S0241	but so that they know
S0240	explain that they be to complete some
S0241	yeah
S0240	in the column
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0241	and then we acknowledge receipt of i would give thank you for send
S0238	yeah
S0241	and then leave the others blank
S0238	leave the others yeah and you'd probably
S0241	and these these ones like the date i'd put some of these er nearer the top
S0240	yeah
S0241	but maybe one of these first and then some of these other ones later erm cos they well the second one about the time highlight the issue about be problems with time and so that'll give them a chance to practice
S0238	that really it
S0241	date and time then
S0238	yes
S0240	you want the
S0241	themselves
S0240	date and time leave where they be
S0241	that one
S0240	do you say
S0241	the vague and ambiguous word need to be at the top cos then it give
S0240	yeah yeah
S0241	it's highlight to them issue
S0240	mm
S0241	about date and time
S0240	yeah
S0241	that then they've get to put into practice themselves later
S0240	okay
S0238	mm yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	and any different ones in
S0240	so that's alright then
S0241	yeah
S0238	yes
S0240	and leave that one there
S0241	yeah i would just leave it yeah
S0238	well i think
S0240	well i can't really move that that nearer the top
S0238	i think that one's
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	and the other complex word leave that as at this time but then
S0240	leave
S0241	make the other one the other bits blank
S0240	blank
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	blank
S0241	erm oh but you need a space after that
S0240	oh yeah a space
S0241	erm i would leave all of the could cos i think that's so difficult that
S0240	which one
S0238	yes
S0240	could should yeah
S0241	could should
S0238	yes
S0241	just leave that as an example
S0238	but that's a that should you that's a a good i've get a
S0241	yeah
S0238	a sentence for correction that i've do with with quite advance students and that isn't the problem
S0240	mm
S0238	it's a completely different problem in that sentence
S0240	mm
S0238	and every single student i've ever do it with have pick that up and say that that be wrong cos they've never learn that structure
S0241	yeah
S0240	they should
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	as a
S0241	yeah
S0238	as another way of say if
S0241	yeah
S0238	and so i've leave it in because
S0240	yeah
S0238	i think advance students should know that
S0241	show it
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah yeah so i would leave that leave that whole box
S0238	mm
S0241	there but point out to them
S0240	because it be quite a classic
S0241	it's cos it be a classic but
S0238	yes
S0240	cos it's typical in formal letter and things
S0241	people won't think
S0238	yes
S0241	how difficult it be
S0240	and how should you require further information
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos you've say to them you know why why you know you could say to them why why might this be difficult
S0240	mm
S0238	and again
S0241	because if you use if
S0238	with noun the noun phrase cos they you need to give an example there
S0241	so i'd give take a decision
S0238	yeah
S0241	and then put a blank for the others
S0238	yeah and as you say leave the abbreviations
S0241	leave the abbreviations
S0238	yeah
S0241	cos it's just write in full
S0238	erm
S0241	leave the passives
S0238	leave the passive because they might not know what that be but but sentence contain if that's okay you could leave that
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah you could leave it there
S0238	yeah you could er i don't mean leave that i mean have it have it blank
S0240	leave it as that
S0238	you know
S0240	it's not a i mean i er i struggle to find a good one actually with if
S0238	yeah
S0240	but i if you it's a bite critical anyway isn't it think lot of get into it i'll just leave it as it be they can just you know they've just get to know that be careful with this
S0238	and you don't want them to be do too many of these
S0241	mm
S0240	no
S0241	yeah leave that one
S0238	so i'd probably that ask question maybe just
S0240	knock it off
S0238	well no leave that one but then don't have it the last one because you want the last one
S0240	yeah
S0238	to be something that the they've get some input to
S0241	mm
S0240	mm
S0238	do that make sense
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah make last one
S0241	the more than one negative in a sentence you've already get ask question
S0240	i could get rid of more than one negative
S0241	mm
S0240	cos we've already get that in the first example couldn't i
S0238	well no no i think
S0240	oh no i'll leave it on the grid yeah
S0241	no it'd say it yeah
S0238	it's worth have it there
S0240	last one then
S0238	and just refer back yeah erm
S0240	have
S0241	put the noun phrase at the end
S0240	yeah
S0241	for example
S0238	yeah
S0240	okay
S0238	but i think that's cos i think those be all things that they'll easily
S0240	i'll
S0238	easily be able to come up with something for
S0240	yeah
S0241	mm
S0240	i'll put nouns
S0238	but there's enough
S0240	instead of noun phrase
S0238	input well
S0241	yeah
S0240	it's off put isn't it in phrase
S0241	yes it's
S0240	nouns that can be place with
S0238	well i don't know cos they're
S0241	they're not gonna know what a noun or a verb be though i mean half of them
S0238	they be noun phrase though
S0240	okay yeah
S0238	they're not just nouns
S0240	yeah
S0241	they're not nouns so would you then with this once you've get it like that you say well we've get here be some common language pitfalls
S0240	yeah
S0241	we've get lot of examples of problem areas here we've give some some examples and you might talk through the first two or three
S0240	yeah
S0241	but then you're gonna have it intersperse with will you have like some of these ones where we've tick that you're gonna give it will we just leave them in the so you'll sometimes have blank and sometimes have it where they read it
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos then if you do the first three say
S0240	yeah
S0241	choose some first ones where it's actually all the answer
S0238	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	there's enough of these things but three where it's all the answer and then they go through and some of it's get the answer in
S0240	yeah
S0241	and some of it hasn't
S0238	hasn't yes
S0241	and then
S0240	or i could have for blank in the second one er elicit it from the so that they get the idea of fill it in and say right
S0238	no i think it's
S0240	in no
S0238	no i don't think it's a a
S0241	no i don't think you need to no
S0238	it's not a difficult concept
S0241	no
S0240	two first three together okay er
S0241	yeah
S0240	so do first three
S0241	yeah do first three and then something about
S0240	the other and then hand over
S0238	then say right
S0241	yeah have a look through these other ones and intersperse it with ones where like the one that's abbreviations where it be already answer or the could and should
S0240	yeah
S0241	where it's already answer
S0240	yeah
S0241	and leave that in just in the middle as it be now
S0240	yes
S0238	yes
S0240	oh yeah
S0241	so they can read them so you don't need to go through it
S0240	yeah
S0241	as you introduce them
S0238	yes yes
S0240	yeah
S0241	because they can just read them
S0238	so that there's not too much of you
S0240	that's some
S0238	just read out what's in front of
S0240	some have answer and some you have to do some work for
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah and then as you go through it all with the answer then and explain why and what's difficult about it
S0240	yeah
S0241	then you when you get to this point you can say well you know what's difficult about should at the begin like this
S0238	yeah yeah
S0241	and ask them if you know if they realise so you could just cover the ones that you've give the answer to like the passives and things as you're go through and then the gap the one at the end the noun phrase at the end
S0238	yeah
S0241	but no i think it's good and
S0238	yes yeah
S0241	i think it will take you forty five minutes
S0240	yes i do i do now that we've put a bite of work into it
S0241	yeah
S0240	and also it's
S0241	and then
S0240	yeah more attractive
S0238	and it fit very nicely onto four side
S0241	yeah and then identify the possible problems
S0241	well as long as you're
S0240	it'll be on behind the back it'll be on the back won't it
S0238	yes yeah that be
S0241	yes that'll be on the back yeah
S0240	that's
S0238	erm that's what i mean i mean i think that i i wasn't just be sarcastic there
S0240	oh
S0238	i mean i actually think it
S0240	yeah
S0238	it's good if it do you don't want something that's go on for page and page
S0240	no no
S0238	but it's get to be solid at the same time
S0240	right i haven't read through these again and erm so i haven't change them i've just literally
S0241	mm
S0240	put the square round them to and i attempt to put them into an e box format but i think they're better with the square round them anyway
S0238	mm
S0240	because it separate them a bite then
S0241	i think even if we can't actually i think this be quite a good way to make it look an e
S0240	yeah
S0241	email actually
S0238	yeah
S0241	that that's probably near enough on the other one
S0240	yeah
S0241	actually
S0238	perhaps
S0241	be you gonna see how you go
S0238	i'll i'll play about with that yes
S0241	but you could just so
S0238	i'm interest to see what i can achieve there now that's the trouble
S0240	i think i'll get rid of practice it's too schooly i'll just put look at the email there and identify possible problems
S0241	mm yeah
S0240	as an instruction
S0241	yeah
S0241	and what so if we just look through them what be the problems i'm just gonna nip to the loo but maybe we could just
S0240	i don't
S0241	talk through what the problems be so we're clear
S0240	well this be the time and date thing isn't it
S0238	yes
S0240	it's not clear on friday after three you know you use the twenty four hour clock not the
S0238	yes and
S0240	you know and the date be not clear and the
S0238	and you do need i mean you don't know it depend where the person be because obviously if they're nine hours away then they're gonna realise you're talk about your time but if they're one or two hours away
S0240	mm
S0238	they're actually probably less likely to be sure which time you cos either could be possible
S0240	yeah
S0238	erm i mean i've my friend in germany always when we're arrange to skype always say bst
S0240	yeah
S0238	with the time
S0240	yeah
S0238	so that we're well i'm sure
S0238	and that's not business but he be a business person you know
S0240	yeah
S0238	he's not an english teacher
S0240	i think the phrase please let me know if you have an availability be quite it's not an easy phrase for everybody it be you free at this time and if not can you suggest at that time and can you suggest and if not please suggest alternative time the follow week i can't
S0238	and with the follow week i would then perhaps
S0240	yeah that's that's rubbish isn't it
S0238	well no then put in
S0240	the week begin the twenty fourth or whatever yeah
S0238	well i mean you could say the follow week but you also
S0240	the next week
S0238	then in bracket need to put ie week commence whatever or ie
S0240	a different time yeah a different instead of alternative time a different time erm in the week in the follow week week commence week
S0238	well can't you just put date in bracket
S0240	yeah
S0238	cos you
S0241	yeah
S0238	i mean week commence be a bite long isn't it
S0240	yeah yeah so date
S0238	and and people would be likely to put w stroke c if you do that
S0241	yeah
S0238	and and
S0240	yeah
S0238	why would anybody understand that abbreviation
S0241	mm
S0240	that's right yeah so basically the first one be a fairly simple one about it's not clear what time they want me to meet
S0238	yes so there's not there's not a huge problem it's just that
S0240	no and then the language could be simplify into you know er let me know be not a very good phrase let me know it's a please be you free at the time if not please suggest a different time in the follow week
S0241	yeah
S0240	with the date okay
S0238	mm yes
S0241	yeah
S0240	and the availability right the second one
S0238	yes i mean you be suggest yes no question rather than
S0240	yeah
S0238	suggestions
S0240	mm
S0241	mm
S0238	yes
S0241	yeah very good
S0238	so be you free be clearer isn't it
S0241	yeah
S0238	er the next one
S0241	well the first sentence
S0238	well i mean i think actually if you read that you'd be er for a start you'd have to get a dictionary out
S0238	and you might actually be sit there think i'm not a hundred percent sure what's be decide
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah yeah because you don't know from the headline the subject headline
S0238	yes no
S0240	what the you know it need to be a clearer headline for a start
S0238	things like
S0240	or about what the decision really
S0238	have have we have obviously that's a
S0241	well the headline i don't think
S0238	well
S0241	i don't think i'd put the answer in a headline
S0238	no
S0240	i would because otherwise they they read they might be read it wait for good news and then they find out it's bad whereas it's better to make it clear right from the word go i always try and do that so that so that people don't get up their
S0238	well i think that's something to ask of
S0241	well what would you put in there what would you put then
S0240	erm well i i haven't i can't remember the thing say originally the business be be take over we be that the project be no longer not possible priority
S0241	gosh i'd never put that in a million years
S0240	wouldn't you
S0238	no i don't know that i would either
S0241	in a million years i'd never put that in a subject
S0240	wouldn't you you think it's too brutal
S0241	if i have to break bad news to somebody
S0238	no
S0241	i just think that be just
S0238	i think maybe that's a question have you
S0241	yeah
S0238	if you if you think you would maybe that's a question to ask the audience
S0241	ask them whether they would
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	what they would because and say we have some disagreement amongst us what
S0241	yeah
S0238	cos i don't think i think i think that's adequate
S0240	i hate it though when i read an email and i think it's one thing and then you come to it at the end of it and you find it's something completely
S0241	but they're not say it's a good thing or a bad thing
S0240	no
S0241	they're just say that it's about the project
S0238	yes
S0240	yeah it's be cancel
S0241	well yeah but the
S0241	but they're not say it have or it hasn't be cancel they're just say the topic of the thing be about the project
S0240	okay that make
S0238	yeah
S0241	so at
S0240	okay
S0238	and the first sentence well no the second sentence tell you that it's
S0241	yeah
S0238	be cancel so it's just
S0241	yeah have we have be another of these should we have
S0238	yeah should you wish and all this er yes so erm and do not hesitate to do something i know that that's we think that's
S0240	please don't hesitate to contact me
S0238	be polite but actually that's
S0240	please contact me yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	yes
S0240	it's just a more pleasant isn't it
S0241	and if you wish to discuss the matter be also might make people think that actually you're not say no
S0240	yeah
S0241	because
S0238	yes yes
S0241	and and so
S0240	so not clear what the real not clear what the message be really be it
S0241	well i think it be clear that the message be the message be the project's not viable
S0240	yeah
S0241	it's just that people often will
S0240	to a native speaker it be
S0241	yeah
S0240	but erm to a non native
S0241	i think it's just a long wind way to say it
S0240	yeah a long long wind
S0241	and we're look at language aren't we
S0240	okay too long wind
S0241	yeah
S0240	and their their job be to simply that's
S0241	yeah
S0238	yeah i mean those those first two sentence
S0240	do you think it's a bite similar to do this though
S0238	should be run together shouldn't they as i'm sorry but
S0241	but here they don't have to simplify it you're ask them to identify problems not simplify it
S0238	mm yes
S0240	oh yeah
S0238	actually that be true
S0240	and possible problems
S0238	they're not rewrite be they
S0240	yes okay and that would be good
S0241	otherwise they're do the same as the last exercise
S0240	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0240	so that would be good for time as well
S0241	so what's the problem with it
S0240	the problem be just
S0241	the problem the first sentence
S0240	it's just far too wordy
S0241	it's wordy it's wordy that's the problem with it
S0240	yeah
S0238	mm
S0240	too wordy too long wind
S0241	too wordy it's to they've get pick out
S0240	yeah erm
S0238	and it's get some quite complex structure in so
S0241	and it's get some of these examples of structure yeah
S0240	complex structure
S0241	yeah
S0240	that we've
S0238	yeah
S0240	tell them not to use
S0241	complex sentence
S0240	structure
S0241	structure doesn't mean anything to a non linguistic
S0240	yes oh okay sentence i'll i'll refer them back to some of the things
S0241	yeah
S0240	in here yeah
S0238	or just say quite complex language
S0241	yeah
S0240	complex language yeah
S0241	mm
S0240	language and just
S0238	i mean even things like that but trust with the ellipsis
S0240	mm
S0238	of the i
S0241	mm
S0241	mm
S0238	to a to a lot of foreigners it's
S0241	less trust oh yeah but trust yeah yeah
S0238	but trust it's not clear that could be
S0240	could trust yeah
S0238	that you're order somebody to trust
S0241	right
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0238	do you know what i mean
S0240	yeah yeah
S0241	yeah i wouldn't do three actually i think just two be enough for the
S0240	yeah
S0241	by the time you've do
S0240	i
S0241	that exercise
S0240	i agree but you last time you say put one extra in it in
S0241	oh in case
S0238	yes
S0240	that be in case activity
S0241	yeah
S0240	but i think you're right
S0238	so
S0240	we will only get
S0238	i think
S0240	up to two
S0241	yeah
S0238	well we you'd be look at the time there wouldn't you
S0241	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	and see and if you have
S0241	we'll see but you're right yeah
S0238	belt through it then we've get a third one in reserve
S0241	we've get one haven't we
S0240	yes and also
S0238	otherwise say well we didn't say i put this one just in case
S0240	yeah
S0238	you be really fast but but
S0240	yeah
S0238	we didn't really expect to get through three or something
S0240	and in
S0241	yeah
S0240	and in case anyone's have time to read it the main problem of the third one be boom
S0241	er yeah
S0240	which i can't remember what it be but
S0241	it's er it's already do
S0240	erm the question be be not clear it need to be bullet point of exactly what they want to know
S0238	mm
S0240	in clearer language
S0241	mm
S0240	so it's clarity of question really you know i've get three question and here they be
S0241	mm
S0240	you know and it's just all mix up in the
S0238	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0240	so
S0241	yeah
S0240	write it's it's it's the format as much as anything yeah
S0238	mm
S0240	this one erm clarity of question yes i i hopefully we particularly get onto that but the
S0241	yeah
S0238	have you ever actually send us your powerpoint i know you've do it before
S0241	i've get it copy here
S0238	but
S0241	oh i think i have but but i might not have do
S0238	i don't think you have do
S0241	if you haven't get it then you haven't get it no well i'll do it now so right and so that's that i think that's the main thing with that isn't it
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah erm right very good
S0240	and then i'm gonna hand over to my colleague be we have a break or
S0241	no there's no break
S0240	no oh there's no break so who be go to take you through or talk to you about
S0241	this so this have be about write
S0240	yeah
S0241	for email and write language
S0240	yeah
S0241	now we're gonna look at speak language and i've gotta find it international english use speak in speak language oh there there we go
S0238	you've be very extravagant with the colour print
S0241	uh huh well because if i'm try to show you
S0238	no i mean yes
S0241	cos we have to at some point we have to look at what it look like don't we
S0238	we do yes
S0240	two
S0238	oh dear i need my flip read glass
S0241	oh so anyway erm oh no so i need really i should just put you're use cos you've already do email communication i should really put use international english for effective communication in meet
S0240	yeah
S0241	shouldn't i and not really mention email here
S0240	no because i didn't mention cos i don't want to have to explain it
S0241	yeah yeah
S0240	or so cos they'll say what the hell be that
S0241	erm so this be a summary of it all this second slide er the tip for effective communication so i be just gonna er when i've do this before i'd just leave that there say this be the summary think about and as you're go through just remember this picture and i'll come back to it at the end and it's just er get them think about it as they go through and then we look at the different variety what different varieties of english be there
S0238	mm
S0241	and so obviously there's all these different ones on the leave and then within britain there's all these different ones and others so the question be whose english should we be use when do business internationally and then people have all different view on that should you use oh you know if you phone should i use a north east local accent and i always say it's it's fine to use different accent i would go you know be careful about use dialects and things but if you're speak clearly and you're aware of your accent and you know cos you know for example i'm from the north east i don't say blood and trouble when i'm talk to people internationally but i you know tone it down and be aware of it but not
S0238	mm
S0241	not get rid of not everybody speak queen's english
S0238	no
S0241	and so what's your view on that but not dialects so i wouldn't say i'm go down the to by myself a paper
S0238	mm
S0241	in erm geordie or something
S0238	yeah
S0241	but that people will speak with accent and
S0240	yeah it's part of the
S0241	mm mm yeah
S0240	skill of be an international communicator
S0238	well i mean apart from everything else
S0240	so you've get to be tolerant of different
S0238	if you try not to you end up produce very weird result
S0241	mm
S0238	you know like you've ever hear anybody from yorkshire try to speak rp
S0241	mm
S0238	you'd be very often come a the the hyper correct and say and things like that it's you know which
S0241	which just sound really odd
S0238	yes which just sound ridiculous
S0240	mm
S0241	so we ask them what they think about that and then apart from the accent what other difficulties might colleagues have internationally with understand native speakers when they speak english
S0240	what do that say on here
S0241	that say one minute cos that's er
S0240	oh
S0241	it's an egg timer
S0240	oh
S0241	so actually when you've get it on the screen it go when i click it go down so they've get a minute to think about that
S0240	oh i see
S0241	so just have a think about it
S0238	right
S0240	that's clever
S0241	er and then these be some of them so individual sound the way that sound get put together in the so individual sound within a word word themselves and then when the word get put together in a sentence and then culturally specific things which you'd already touch upon
S0238	mm
S0241	and then i just go through them all a little bite so these be the individual sound and don't worry i'm not gonna go through all of these different sound here in this picture er and i look at long and short sound a little bite like shoot and short or chip and cheap and how people can't always get that and then er and consonant cluster like comfortable and then individual word and up come the word look and i say you know what difficulty might people have with a word that's a simple as look and then people will say oh well it's the same word the pronunciation of it or they might say it's because it might be look but you've always get the word food so why don't you say look
S0240	mm
S0241	some people that would make a problem
S0238	well you do if you're from lancashire
S0241	in some place or they might say most of the time what they say be luck as in good luck it's the same pronunciation as
S0240	mm
S0238	right
S0241	so they'll think about that er and then i say yeah what about the word that come after luck and how look at look after look for it's a totally different word in most other languages look at be a totally different idea to look for so they've get to listen carefully to what come after
S0238	mm
S0241	so even a simple word can seem difficult
S0240	mm
S0241	but then when you start put it when you start put speech word together then it can be really difficult to get so the first one this want to wish you sweet be i'll say well we i be in a meet once where somebody say a sentence and one of the people hear this and they couldn't understand what be say what do you think be actually say and then people try to work it out and then the i bring the second one up that start and say another person with the same sentence hear this and they try to guess what be actually say and then actually what be say be the last one
S0238	mm
S0241	so it's just know you know you might the last one the word be not difficult but sometimes when you're listen to a foreign language
S0240	it's not just it's
S0241	it's hard to know where one word end and the next word begin
S0240	so what's the advice or do that come oh yeah tip i mean
S0241	the advice come later
S0240	i mean would you not give them like how can you avoid you know create that problem for people
S0241	i don't think i think if i start give them tip and go back and forward
S0240	yeah
S0238	mm
S0241	it just become
S0240	okay
S0241	very
S0240	yeah
S0241	bitty
S0240	yeah
S0241	i think it's i'd rather first of all
S0240	okay
S0241	say what the issue make them aware of the issue and then look at things
S0240	mm
S0238	mm
S0241	and then and look at sometimes i don't do this one but which one do you actually hear
S0238	mm
S0240	right
S0241	and and and things and it's just an awareness really a bite of fun but a bite of awareness that it be quite difficult to know where one word end and one where one word begin things that seem very simple er can be quite difficult and actually you could pronounce all of those a and b both the same
S0240	yeah
S0241	in certain context
S0240	mm
S0241	er and so then to practice that a bite more about when be the next one so we've write it the first one be where d'you live
S0240	where d'you live
S0241	and the third one's very difficult of course and then ain't it hot isn't it hot and people like say ain't it hot in 'ere or isn't it hot
S0238	yeah mm
S0241	and and to think you know people we all say this kind of thing well you know not necessarily all of these but people say this kind of thing all the time
S0238	mm
S0241	and it's really difficult for people to pick up on it sometimes er and then culturally specific or specialist vocabularies so abbreviations and i don't need to say a lot about this cos this have already be touch upon elsewhere
S0238	mm
S0241	but the specialist vocabulary people might know about but and then there's four examples here how might you say them and just like to jot down the number i give them a ring or shall i run through that again
S0238	mm
S0241	so a phrasal verb be not that i use that word or use abbreviations like ceo or let's get down to the nitty gritty which we it come up before
S0240	i put that on cos you give it to me
S0241	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	that's good
S0240	but if you want i can change it
S0238	no no that's fine
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0241	and people speak either with a very monotone fast or too and then bear in mind with cultural specific things that there's a apart from the different business culture which you've mention there's also the fact that we talk a lot in in everyday speech and in work about business celebrities
S0240	mm
S0241	or famous people and people that be well know in one culture be not necessarily well know in another one
S0240	yeah
S0241	and people that you just assume everybody know be not always know so david beckham might be quite well know in japan
S0238	mm
S0241	but other people that we know really well like off the friends television programme or from the x factor or that some of these famous people singers people don't know sometimes it's base on some culturally specific things they're just simply from before
S0238	mm
S0241	the student that the person's time that you're talk to
S0238	yes
S0240	yeah
S0238	you need to know how old people be
S0241	yeah and so erm or it's base get sometimes you can you end up talk about things which be very base on life here and it's not erm people just don't get it cos it's
S0238	well i have a problem with when i'm watch comedy show on i mean comedy chat show now
S0241	mm
S0238	because quite often there'll be joke that refer to people from popular culture and i've no idea who they be because i don't watch enough television
S0241	mm yeah no i have that problem
S0238	and i actually gradually deduce who some of these people be from the joke that be make about them but i don't actually know
S0241	yeah and so it's you know there's you can't assume that things that everybody just know
S0238	mm
S0241	and aren't know in other culture so what vocabulary do you have and a match i be gonna a bite of that but there might not be time and then the tip for effective communication be here in a list and i i go through them one by one
S0238	mm
S0241	but er and we just talk about them all
S0240	yeah it's good
S0238	yeah
S0241	it's what i've do in the past and
S0240	what's that that one sorry what be the suggestion
S0241	oh that's just here be some suggestions
S0240	oh i see yeah
S0241	and then just go onto it
S0238	yeah
S0241	so it's quick and then i bring up those original picture again with the blank here and really what i'm do be i'm test them on what i just say on the slide before which be a bite vocabulary it's word dense
S0238	mm
S0241	so really i'm just test them on the same things again
S0238	yeah
S0241	so i say what do you think then this picture and they don't have to get the right answer it doesn't matter it just make them think
S0238	yeah
S0241	it make them activate gonna ask you about what we've just say doesn't it
S0238	yeah
S0240	what be it
S0241	so the first one
S0240	a dolphin
S0241	a dolphin
S0240	a shark oh okay
S0241	with his mouth open
S0240	okay
S0241	doesn't really matter what the in a way it's kind of just meet them think get about it again so vocalise so don't don't be don't speak with a really if you if you have a tendency to mumble don't mumble and erm to be or not to be keep sentence short and precise which you've say things about this don't make things over complex avoid negative question and double negative we can talk about as well
S0240	mm
S0241	er use frequently use vocabulary like chair instead of you know and so call the spade a spade in effect er have regular break in meet because and a cup of tea or coffee have break cos it's very difficult to work in a foreign language all the time
S0240	mm
S0241	but also
S0238	it's it's exhaust
S0240	mm
S0241	the cup of tea also represent erm cultural reference that we we tend we might have a tea break or say we'll have a coffee break
S0240	mm
S0241	and where coffee's always write in italian these days but people have a a tea break but in other culture people don't stop for tea break
S0240	mm
S0241	you know er and then so cultural reference that you might make and then send the agenda in advance to people erm so they can see what the meeting's gonna be about erm so they can and send a summary afterwards so put things in write as well as speak so that they can
S0240	mm
S0238	yeah
S0241	erm get it both
S0238	yeah
S0241	and then name number date and place always write them out name and place that seem really obvious to us
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos everybody know worcester
S0240	mm
S0241	you can't expect people to know er to know what that wor ces ter be actually worcester
S0238	mm
S0241	or that er and that
S0238	yes
S0241	even name like really common name like jam other people might not know that or surnames that people know that be really common in the uk
S0240	yeah
S0241	they're not necessarily know by other people other culture
S0240	mm
S0241	so write things out and then the question and i haven't put your erm thing on here from
S0238	no
S0241	but i will do or
S0238	well yes i mean i've struggle with that
S0241	yeah mm
S0238	on the on the receive end of people students tell me what their name be and say the whole name and i don't know where the surname end the first name begin or vice you know whichever they're say first
S0240	yeah
S0238	and they don't seem to to realise that it's a name and therefore it's unfamiliar
S0240	yeah
S0241	mm
S0238	but it's important so you've get to be clear
S0241	that student do this morning that be upset and she say my name be
S0238	yeah
S0241	god i just miss that altogether
S0241	cos it wasn't a name i'd hear of before
S0238	yes exactly
S0241	but i need to put your name on the bottom
S0240	mm
S0241	i'd put us two actually because we be run this afternoon i suppose
S0240	yeah yeah but but it's the last though isn't it
S0241	but it's the last slide so
S0240	oh yeah
S0241	i put all of us on erm
S0240	comment and question how long will be you go to allow for that or
S0241	oh it depend how much time there be
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes
S0241	and whether there's any comment or question
S0238	yeah and how keen they be on run off for the lunch

S0240	send it off tomorrow well no not tomorrow next week er or early next week
S0241	so i need to ask about that we've plan the delivery oh yeah the only other thing be that they have get a link to it's for this cultural profile what's your cultural profile
S0240	i like that
S0241	it's like a little quiz
S0240	it's really good
S0241	i don't know whether you've see it
S0240	i do i do
S0241	but it's good
S0240	it's very good cos it go back to a lot of the the issue that have come up so
S0241	yeah and erm where would where would be put it though
S0240	on your
S0241	on my handout
S0240	country one the one about the country couldn't it go there
S0241	on here
S0240	that one yeah
S0241	what be your cultural profile
S0240	mm
S0241	yeah cos we're either put it on there or on effective email it's not that be it
S0238	no
S0241	so it's that one on it
S0240	do that one need to be you know
S0238	so
S0240	can nothing go on the back of that just to reduce the paper do you know what i mean
S0238	well there be
S0240	well i know but we've already get those in in the thing i just wonder if
S0238	well
S0240	so that we're gonna have so many handouts
S0238	if you make those a little bite smaller you could put that link on the back couldn't you but no i don't think
S0240	mm
S0238	i cos the other handouts be
S0240	be part of the talk
S0238	er or most of the other be most of the other handouts two side or be they all one side
S0241	i be actually gonna ask you whether we should be use double side or not
S0240	oh definitely definitely
S0238	yeah
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah because you know we don't want to waste paper on it
S0241	mm yeah
S0240	and er as as little paper as possible
S0241	mm
S0240	and nobody like go away with load and load of paper
S0241	load of yeah load of paper yeah
S0240	they're more likely to bin it i think well if you think it look nicer on single side
S0241	i think in a folder it can you can see but it doesn't matter i'd only
S0238	well
S0241	i'm not feel strongly about it
S0240	oh well it yeah i dunno cos you're hand out your well you're it's very we've have this
S0241	well wait i think your handouts we'd certainly have it on double
S0240	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	i think we will just use double side won't we
S0240	oh think so
S0241	yeah erm
S0238	well i mean that one be only single side
S0241	yeah
S0238	and i think that's fair enough
S0241	that would be that would be single then
S0240	why couldn't that go on the back of that one there be
S0238	well no cos i think that look a bite cheap
S0241	cos cos it look cheap if you
S0240	do it
S0241	cos it's not the same exercise at all
S0240	no
S0238	no no
S0241	you know it's not you want
S0240	well it's not an exercise it's just a
S0241	but when people look at that it won't even be connect to this
S0240	okay
S0241	they'll turn over and it's not even the same nobody's even gonna mention that for like half an hour
S0240	okay
S0238	yeah
S0241	so i certainly don't think we should have double
S0238	no no
S0241	this be where it's probably why i be ask it really cos i don't think we should have it for the sake you know for the sake of
S0240	no okay
S0241	a few piece of paper
S0238	but i think
S0241	you know it's
S0238	the way we've get them like that i mean that and then as you say you put that on the back but if you if you
S0241	that i'll put the culture profile
S0238	if you could put that link go on on that somewhere
S0241	yeah
S0238	yes erm
S0241	yeah
S0238	erm
S0240	be there gonna be erm an you know an e an email version for them so that they can click directly on that link cos that's how most people like to access all their stuff now
S0241	be it
S0240	mm
S0241	it's how most people have to access their stuff now
S0240	yeah most
S0241	whether that's how they want to be another matter
S0240	yeah well business people and younger people do
S0238	well cos they we don't like it maybe
S0241	business people and younger people be not the same thing
S0240	no i know but i mean
S0238	we don't all
S0240	that's the that's the sort of tendency now that you you just click and you get rather than
S0241	it be but
S0238	well
S0241	but every session we've be to with it's always hand out
S0240	i'm not say we shouldn't hand it out
S0238	yes
S0241	isn't it and
S0240	i'm just say they should have the people who want to should be able to click somewhere and get it you know online rather
S0238	well do we have any mean of give them something in e format i don't know that we do
S0241	well if there be a way will tell will ask
S0238	will sort that yeah
S0241	ask us to send it cos she'll say send it to us
S0240	yeah i think they should it just look more up to date you know to have it available at least
S0241	oh yeah we can have it available yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	and she'll probably ask us for it later i would think
S0240	mm
S0241	cos she'll probably want to but i don't know whether she send it i don't i don't know i think what happen actually in the last one i go to i get it we ask we say can you send us it can you cos it didn't actually happen through our
S0240	yeah
S0241	we say can you send us the slide so then you know and we say oh yes okay then
S0240	mm
S0241	so i think if people ask us for them we will we can do but erm
S0240	yeah
S0241	i know what you mean about print things out and i mean but i know that my students for example i don't on work with languages doesn't even print out the module handbook
S0240	we're not allow to we're not allow to print out at
S0241	it's all just on and i know university doesn't
S0240	yeah
S0241	and this kind of thing now but and i don't print it out for for work with languages now but erm but students hate it
S0240	do they
S0241	yeah
S0240	mm
S0241	cos they don't read it
S0238	well
S0240	well they don't read it anyway
S0241	they can't get they can't have access to it cos even though they've all get mobile devices that be smartphones
S0240	mm
S0241	you don't wanna read a module handbook on your smartphone
S0238	no
S0240	but they don't read it anyway the module handbook
S0241	well that's what
S0240	but at least they can refer to it you know
S0241	but they can't refer to it in the same way
S0238	if they can't refer to it quickly
S0241	if it's stick on the virtual learn environment
S0238	yeah
S0240	mm
S0241	and so so like even like the powerpoint slide you know the students they've have to get use to now but they don't actually like i don't think do you think your students like go on there and have
S0240	i do i do
S0241	it cost them a fortune to print it
S0240	i think they prefer it they don't they get annoy and lot of them have tell me not that's partly why i'm a bite sensitive to it
S0241	don't print
S0240	yeah
S0238	right
S0240	they've say there's too much paper too much paper you know put it all all on the vle you know we don't need the paper yeah
S0241	oh
S0238	well i think
S0240	yeah
S0241	mm
S0240	yeah
S0238	i think you know yeah i mean in class i would say to the students you know i've i i would double side a worksheet two different worksheets
S0240	mm
S0238	from the same
S0241	oh yeah
S0238	and that sort of thing and and and yes i'm aware that there be a number of students who feel as i do that we shouldn't be cut down so many tree
S0240	mm
S0238	but i do think a business environment be a bite different and it be partly about presentation
S0240	mm
S0238	and so i agree i don't
S0241	yeah
S0238	i think that that agree disagree thing shouldn't be er back to back with something else
S0240	no no no okay
S0241	no but i do think that this one
S0238	but it think 's thing
S0241	should be
S0238	should be double side
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0241	and i think this one should be double side
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos it's one handout
S0238	yes
S0240	yeah
S0238	yes if it's
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0238	that's why i be say it's good that it's four side
S0240	yeah
S0241	yeah
S0238	rather than a
S0240	mm
S0238	an odd number
S0240	yeah
S0238	because it it work out quite
S0241	and actually on this one i do kind of put something on the back cos i think well if i'm gonna handout one side i might as well put something
S0238	yes
S0241	on the back of it that that you're not
S0240	yeah
S0241	but not for the agree disagree because it's at a different time of the meet
S0238	yeah yeah
S0241	but i will add this this
S0238	link
S0241	onto the back of it
S0238	yeah
S0240	mm
S0238	okay
S0241	and we can tell them about it
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm what else have i get in here
S0240	oh
S0241	so we're nearly there aren't we
S0240	yeah
S0241	erm we need to think about in what we're gonna do if we'll keep work on our bits and then maybe
S0238	mm
S0241	have one more meet but and about payment for you
S0240	yes
S0241	so be you add up some
S0240	well
S0241	you know you need to think about time and how much
S0240	i haven't be add it up but
S0241	no
S0240	but i mean
S0238	mm
S0241	well you need to
S0240	yeah
S0241	cos we can't do that because we don't get pay extra for it anyway
S0240	you don't get pay extra anyway well i don't know you must have have an idea of from whatever you get i i can try and add it up like
S0241	i have no concept
S0240	i mean but the thing be it's not a sudden all in one block like today for example i go into work at whatever time ten or something
S0241	mm
S0240	and then i do a lot of other stuff and then i start properly about twelve
S0241	yeah well you need to think about
S0240	twelve one two three
S0241	how much money you want pay for it
S0240	you know
S0241	how many hours
S0238	well i mean the each of the meet that we've
S0240	and some of the other ones i've spend longer on yeah
S0238	have be about two hours i mean
S0240	yeah they have yeah
S0238	you see you know erm
S0240	so how many meet have we have three
S0241	three
S0240	three
S0241	so that's six hours
S0240	yeah
S0238	but then obviously the time that you've spend on your own
S0240	yes
S0241	you have to work out for yourself
S0240	okay
S0241	yeah so have a think about it
S0240	i will yeah
S0241	but you know it might be i dunno and then to claim it
S0240	yeah
S0241	we need to check with again but she do tell me something about this she say she say you either claim like say it's take you fourteen hours or something
S0240	yeah
S0241	right well then you either claim it as at the meet rate
S0240	mm
S0241	fourteen hours at the meet rate cos the meet rate be a sixty minute hour isn't it
S0238	mm
S0240	yeah
S0241	so er fourteen hours at the meet rate or you claim it at you claim something like seven hours at the teach rate
S0240	yeah
S0241	something cos you claim half as many cos it's for every hour that for teach you're get pay for prepare and mark as well
S0240	yeah
S0241	so you're kind of get another hour on top of it
S0238	right yeah yeah
S0241	so so it's something like you either claim fourteen hours at the meet rate or half as many hours i think it be
S0240	yeah
S0241	at the teach rate and one of those work out slightly better for you
S0240	okay
S0238	so do the maths and
S0241	but
S0240	yeah
S0241	know this cos 's do it before with people
S0240	yeah
S0241	so she like 's do things for
S0238	yeah
S0241	lot of project stuff so she'll know
S0240	i'll ask i'll ask yeah
S0241	but what you'll need to know before you ask be how many hours you've spend on it
S0240	yeah okay
S0241	and it would be useful if you tell us that cos then if she say to me or how long have it take then we can all sing from the same hymn sheet
S0240	ah
S0238	yes
S0240	okay
S0241	cos if she say to us make us guess
S0240	but i haven't be write it down because
S0241	mm
S0240	you get involve in it don't you and you start read up on stuff
S0238	well i mean our answer to that be we know how long we've spend in meet but we don't know how long she's take on on work the
S0241	yeah on the rest of it
S0240	no
S0238	the work why should we
S0241	but she she might ask us what do we think be reasonable and it would be handy for us to know
S0240	mm
S0241	what you've think about before
S0240	yes
S0241	before we get
S0238	yeah
S0241	ask that question
S0240	okay
S0241	just so we all
S0240	well for each meet but i mean no i can't i can't work it out i mean i'll think about it
S0241	you can't so think about it
S0240	no because you know sometimes you're read up and you're read and you're click
S0241	yeah
S0240	and try to find link and and i've be do that but i i certainly didn't time it
S0241	yeah
S0240	i should have do really but
S0238	yeah
S0240	you know
S0241	see i time i'm do exams at the moment
S0238	mm
S0241	i write down every like i look at the seven o'clock to eight o'clock seven o'clock to nine thirty i write down
S0240	do you
S0241	every single time yeah cos i'm get pay by the number of hours i've do
S0240	i would do i would do again
S0241	yeah
S0240	i would do again if as you do it but i be i be more to start with interest in the project you know
S0238	yes
S0241	yeah
S0240	and then when it come to do the work obviously you would like to get pay for it
S0241	you don't
S0240	but i be actually interest in do
S0241	yeah
S0240	it just seem and interest thing to
S0241	you need to get the
S0238	mm
S0240	obviously i want to get pay
S0241	yeah and i don't know whether will have an idea you know if we say thirty hours she'll she'll say
S0240	yeah
S0241	well you can't have that anyway but
S0240	mm
S0241	erm it's something i dunno where what she's get in her head about and actually it's get pay for out of the money
S0240	yeah
S0241	so it's just erm
S0240	yeah
S0241	but erm yeah
S0240	i mean i'll try and calculate
S0241	but work work the first thing be to work out
S0240	yeah this weekend i'll
S0241	we can work out how you claim for it afterwards
S0240	yeah
S0241	when you've work out
S0240	okay
S0241	erm yeah when you've work out how many hours you think you've put into it
S0240	mm
S0241	which we're not mm finish yet have we
S0240	no
S0238	no
S0241	and then the day that we deliver it assume that we be gonna be deliver it and then
S0241	and then the erm
S0238	that would be quite funny actually if we didn't
S0241	well then we'd have to think about a ways of use it somewhere else wouldn't we
S0240	yes
S0238	yes
S0240	yes definitely yes
S0238	yeah
S0241	and
S0238	can i go home now
S0241	yeah
S0240	yeah
S0238	i want my tea
S0240	what time be it six be it
S0241	i bet you're starve aren't you cos you come with your with the wrong food for today
