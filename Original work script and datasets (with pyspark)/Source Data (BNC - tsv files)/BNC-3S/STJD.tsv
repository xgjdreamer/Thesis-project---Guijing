S0157	basically
S0084	i never really wear make up these days unless i'm go out now
S0041	mm
S0157	really
S0084	like during the day i've get a bite a bite of foundation bite of eyeliner bite of mascara that'd be it
S0041	i
S0084	cos i just can't be arsed
S0157	no
S0041	i wear this every day
S0084	i think if i can get away with yeah
S0041	every day
S0084	i think if i can get away with it at this age about not wear much make up then
S0157	that's what i wear yeah
S0084	i'm gonna milk it as long as i can
S0041	mm
S0157	a bite of eyeliner mascara and
S0041	mm
S0157	and that's about it
S0041	i always wear foundation bronzer ah mascara
S0084	mm but only if i'm actually go out like i'll go out today and i won't wear any make up
S0041	no i can't do that
S0084	no i i won't i'll refuse cos i feel like i don't have to and like the world's gonna judge me
S0041	right
S0084	today i'm not go to the office i'm not actually see anyone that matter
S0041	i can't do that
S0157	luckily i think i bring my mascara with my eyeliner with me nothing else so key things
S0084	key important things
S0157	put those on right
S0084	be she actually naked god what so how're we do for time then
S0157	so
S0084	what be they you've get a flash message
S0157	no that's be there since i get the phone
S0084	good
S0157	i don't know what it be
S0041	you don't know what it be
S0084	how long have you have the phone
S0157	it's not it doesn't mean full inbox because it's be there for like ever i've have the phone for two and a half years
S0041	mm
S0084	good
S0157	go to about just over two years
S0084	good good
S0157	hopefully i can get a new one soon in march
S0084	you must be due one
S0157	i have be due load but i've be go through simplicity things
S0084	oh right yeah
S0157	to keep it cheap
S0084	nice
S0157	now i've gotta wait till march
S0041	can i feel how heavy it be
S0157	then i can get an iphone
S0041	oh it's not too bad
S0157	i'm gonna get an iphone
S0084	oh that's quite excite
S0157	i'm so excite
S0041	yeah i really want an iphone actually i don't i want the samsung galaxy back
S0084	oh
S0041	after it die at new year it just run away from me
S0084	the samsung
S0041	i know i use to love it
S0084	mm
S0041	but i like them better than the iphone i think cos they're a bite more like the way they work be more intuitive than the iphone whereas the iphone have their own way of work don't they
S0157	yeah i'm a bite uh
S0084	like if you've have apple products before then it's it's fine
S0041	yeah
S0084	but i think there's probably quite a learn curve there
S0157	i think it's gonna take me a while
S0041	mm jord's get one though and i've have a play on it and there's it's not it's rare that i'll get stick and go what've i press here
S0084	mm
S0157	mm
S0041	so they can't be that bad
S0084	i love them but to go from nothing to an iphone be expensive like record track
S0041	yeah
S0157	yeah
S0084	and obviously because my phone be about a million years old and it's worth ten pound um on mazuma mobile um i've get nothing to go towards a phone so unless i get a contract that's forty pound a month i have to pay two hundred pound for the new phone and if i get a contract that's thirty pound a month i'd still have to pay like a hundred pound for the phone and it would still be thirty pound on my contract and
S0041	oh god
S0084	so i just think there's just so unless my until my phone die there's no uh incentive for me to do it
S0041	no
S0084	apart from the fact that it's beautiful
S0157	apart from the beauty of course
S0084	i dunno what i'm gonna wear on my feet in the snow
S0041	i
S0084	i don't have any wellies
S0157	no
S0041	oh i wish i have wellies
S0084	i wish i have wellies
S0041	i have boot
S0157	do you what i find the best thing be um ugg boot because you would think that they're really bad in snow
S0084	absorbent
S0041	yeah
S0157	but actually they're the warmest thing and they be surprisingly absorbent
S0084	yeah but you don't want absorbent though do you surely if it's wet outside
S0157	i be no i mean they're um i mean they're you know they don't
S0041	absorb the snow in
S0157	no it doesn't go through them they're the best thing i've find to wear in the snow mine be

S0157	and also it clean them
S0084	oh useful
S0157	i always wear them in the snow deliberately because they come out really clean

S0157	oh
S0084	didn't get any sleep ever that be her in the morning when she be like i just need to sleep cos it be so noisy i fell asleep at like eleven o'clock cos i'm so lame
S0157	yeah
S0084	and i'd be up since seven cos i drive down and um i fell asleep
S0157	where be that do you say
S0084	in brighton i drive down to brighton last weekend
S0157	oh
S0084	to see her and to see her mum and her family and like our old haunt my old house and and uh i fell asleep quite early cos we get food and drink and just go back to the hotel room i fell asleep and sort of during the night i could hear noise outside in the night all the club and stuff cos our hotel be on the seafront so it's really central
S0157	yeah
S0084	and i could hear people but i just like sort of
S0157	zone it out
S0084	be aware and then hiya and then roll over and i wake up in the morning like oh morning how're you feel and she be like i didn't get a wink of sleep last night
S0084	she be so frazzle apparently at three in the morning she go down to reception desk like hair wild in her pyjamas like be you take the piss it's so noisy i can't sleep and they say um it's brighton what do you expect
S0157	yeah
S0084	she be like i expect a good night's sleep and they say well we can't move you cos the only other room be on the same side of the hotel and obviously i be schnoozing dead to the world
S0157	yeah
S0084	so she just come back to the room be like write complaint letter like go on trip advisor and check up all these review cos her sister have stay between christmas and new year and have a really good time but i think it be quite quiet
S0157	yeah
S0084	people weren't really go out cos they be go out at new year so it be a very different experience so she hadn't look at the review when she book it cos have say
S0157	yeah
S0084	she have such a good time so um
S0157	the same hotel
S0084	same hotel yeah so in the morning they wouldn't give us our money back all she'd pay they wouldn't give her her money back they say you know even in a travelodge it'd be a hundred pound a night in brighton like it's never cheaper than that
S0157	mm no
S0084	so they give her her money back to a hundred pound and then give us late checkout
S0157	mm
S0084	but she be pretty frazzle for that entire next day i have to like push her round the seafront like come on we're go for a walk
S0157	oh
S0084	oh okay coffee
S0157	that's not bad though um i mean at least that show why it's good to complain at least cos at least you get something out of it
S0084	mm well yeah they i mean they do say like come through to the manager in the morning cos they in the night they be just like well there's no one here to see you to complain to
S0157	exactly see i probably would've just think oh well you know it's it be gonna be noisy cos it's on the front and probably wouldn't have complain and then wouldn't have get anything
S0084	well they i mean the thing be they say we don't want stag party we don't want hen party like no group of more than two men or women
S0157	yeah
S0084	be allow but they bill themselves as a quiet friendly like a not a party hotel at all
S0157	yeah
S0084	so to be able to like bill yourself as one thing and then say oh well it's a party town what do you expect
S0157	yeah exactly
S0084	it's it's a bite cheeky
S0157	cos you'd think they'd have ways of
S0157	limit the noise
S0084	right how're you do
S0041	yeah good i think we um
S0084	hm
S0041	when we need to go play in the snow we might need to go and get coffee somewhere
S0084	that sound like a lovely idea
S0041	that sound like a good plan doesn't it marshmallows and things on top

S0157	i know so be i
S0041	stupid work
S0157	it be stupid work
S0084	i think i think teach might not be the um the plan yeah

S0157	really
S0041	yep really very grey yeah shock isn't it
S0157	oh no
S0041	so i be like oh my god i'm not even twenty five um i be probably you can probably see like not even just the odd one like especially at the front there be like a cluster of maybe six or ten together and then all the way through from on the root i be just like what the hell be that what be that cos i've always always dye it
S0157	yeah
S0041	yeah so now we've we've block colour over it

S0084	mm and we've be talk about go to the beach for age
S0041	yeah
S0084	we will have to though it it would be really pretty today all the snow on the stone

S0157	can i come
S0084	mm yeah everyone's welcome in an olive
S0157	thank let's go
S0084	let's do it shall we run away
S0157	yeah
S0041	yeah let's
S0084	oh a year
S0041	let's run away from real life this be me study right now this be me test my mental maths i can feel it go in
S0157	you're suppose to be work as well
S0041	yeah huh
S0157	i'll be fine once i get start and start do it i'll just get into it and it'll be alright it's just it's always the think of all the work that be just sit there to be it's
S0041	the pile
S0157	like the pile yeah it's like oh do i have to i don't wanna do it
S0157	but this be still nothing compare to my first year where i'd spend
S0041	yeah first year be absolutely horrendous
S0157	every every yeah every weekend i use to have this guilt thing about like do anything at all other than work
S0041	yeah
S0157	and
S0041	and during the week you use to call at you you'd stay at school and do it or come home and do do bloody plan after plan after plan
S0157	mm yeah
S0084	
S0041	yeah and then the worst part be like cos they it be teach like anything from thirteen to eighteen it wasn't consistent either so he's have to chop and change subject
S0157	yeah
S0041	chop and change level and sometimes you can re use stuff in class but very rarely cos it wasn't
S0157	yeah exactly
S0041	it be just light uh
S0157	yeah at least i've just get just the one class
S0041	but i mean i always keep it all which i suppose you probably have as well so as the next year come round he's get bits that he can use
S0157	yeah
S0041	organise it
S0084	cos they tell you that you're allow to re use it
S0157	although i've change school each year so it hasn't really help me so far
S0041	oh
S0084	but then can you just re use everything then cos no one will know
S0157	well you you yeah but i this be the first year i've teach year three so it's all different anyway
S0084	oh oh
S0157	and obviously you have to you have to you have to be teach the same thing as the other class in that year
S0084	oh right
S0157	so you couldn't just do your own thing you'd have to you have to plan with them
S0084	oh so there's another class for that year group
S0157	yeah and they kind of encourage you to change the plan anyway like from one year to the next year you have to adapt it for the children you've get and so it wouldn't be i mean it still would eventually if you stay in the same school and teach the same year for a few years yeah it would get easier
S0084	mm
S0157	i've just never really get to that stage
S0084	uh
S0157	fish
S0084	bore
S0157	don like fish
S0084	oh not another one
