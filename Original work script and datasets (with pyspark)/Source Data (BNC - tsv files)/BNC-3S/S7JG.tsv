S0041	so i really lively say why don't just say hello just say morning
S0084	yeah my mum would've be exactly the same when i've get visitors round she's always pop in like d'you have a nice time you alright
S0041	yeah i like i don't i don't' think it's strange at all
S0084	right no i've always see it as really sweet
S0041	yeah it's like why would you be argumentative in that way and i i can remember if you be maybe sixteen seventeen
S0084	yeah
S0041	you would've be like mum come on leave us alone but 's like she keep say to me all the time there's only two years difference between us i'm think two years
S0084	mm
S0041	like she's twenty three this year
S0084	mm
S0041	and i think i didn't i think she be twenty two this year i be like what
S0084	oh yeah when you tell me that even even when you say that she be twenty two you see i'd be surprise
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos she act like an eighteen year old
S0041	yeah yeah she do
S0084	yeah it's cos it's probably cos she's never move out and so she's never grow up more than eighteen
S0041	no i just couldn't believe it
S0084	that be really badly behave
S0041	yes really
S0084	i'm surprise you know obviously it be always gonna be quite hard for her mum to ask her to leave and she obviously hasn't do that
S0041	no and i don't think she have any intention of it to be honest cos i suppose while 's there pay her rent cos be say oh you know i um i'm gonna get this new job basically it's just like an after school club cos she work at the school so she'd get more hours
S0084	yeah
S0041	um and she be like oh so i can earn a bite more money cos i'm absolutely skint all the time and inside i be bubble cos i be like be you take the piss
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	she earn about a a hundred pound less than me a month and she live at home and she's talk to me about be skint
S0084	oh right and she live at home yeah yeah absolutely and your rent be a joke
S0041	i be like seriously and she be like yeah i know i say tell me about it she say no really i be like how much money do you think i earn
S0041	she be like well you know a bite a little bite more than me and i be like yeah a hundred pound she be like well there you go then i be like i doubt very much that your rent's like mine she say i do pay rent i say yes and i doubt very much it's five hundred pound a month
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	she be like well no but it's two hundred
S0084	so she's get an extra two hundred pound on top of you then
S0041	so she yeah she's she's compare two hundred pound to my five hundred i mean in some months it's four five five so still work out weekly so actually it's not five hundred pound it's four five five
S0084	yeah but still yeah but still so much
S0041	i be just like what and i be like
S0084	i can't believe she charge you twenty quid a week more than she charge me
S0041	yeah
S0084	for a room
S0041	yeah
S0084	only just bigger than mine think it's just absolutely outrageous i think she definitely put the rat up when we move in
S0041	yeah
S0084	she just doesn't really live in the real world so she's no idea how much rent cost
S0041	no no and she be like
S0084	cos she doesn't need to
S0041	yeah so that so that mean there's not that much difference between us and i be like yeah um and pay for food
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i pay for transport and i pay the car insurance and i say well this month with the car fiasco that be fun and the whole time i mean i didn't i wasn't i wasn't say it to have a dig i be say it so that she kind of understand that really her situation isn't that bad
S0084	yeah
S0041	d'you know what i mean
S0084	absolutely
S0041	and she just wasn't get it not at all
S0084	yeah she live on a different planet though doesn't she i mean it be
S0041	yeah
S0084	she's a nice girl but it must be difficult to be friends with someone like that because you be so different
S0041	it's just craziness like i don't i didn't expect her to go oh yeah poor you
S0084	mm mm
S0041	i expect her to maybe appreciate that have her mum like that
S0084	yeah she's lucky to have that
S0041	yeah and stop be so rude to her
S0084	to be able to to say yeah to not take her for grant and to appreciate what she's get
S0041	yeah
S0084	well that's the thing cos you would think that have speak to you know once or twice about your family situation the think would've occur actually d'you know i haven't have half as much drama with my family as i've as 's have with hers maybe i should be a bite more grateful about what i've get go on at home whereas people like her you tend to find that they're just as selfish because
S0041	yeah
S0084	they um they just see it see their problems they don't see other people's problems they don't see that what they've get actually be quite a good situation
S0041	very very strange i'm gonna fill this with the
S0084	okay and i will get the thing for the gravy
S0041	yeah that type of mentality i saw in earlier today but

S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah that's the thing you know he's he's an independent business man like it must be difficult to sort of juggle the two
S0041	yeah

S0041	a chicken baby
S0084	a chicken baby
S0084	so they don't like her cos she's get boob
S0041	yes basically you know what they like they're all like squaddies and hmm this be all men
S0084	hmm
S0041	grr
S0084	god
S0084	be this a true story then they never use to let women in the navy seal
S0041	well i don't know if they do now
S0084	ah
S0041	don't know we certainly don't let them in the marines
S0084	don't we
S0041	no the only thing the only way a woman can be in the marines be if they play in the band
S0084	awww
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's shit
S0041	which i think be fine i don't really see a problem with it probably cos i won't don't wanna go to war mind you i suppose if you really want to do that and you're a girl i can't imagine any girl that would want to but if you do i could see that be a bite unjust
S0084	yeah and that's because they think that women aren't as tough as men
S0041	mm
S0084	what
S0041	marine force recon uh oh
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't think a woman could be in the marines they'd have to be build like a wrestler or something
S0084	yeah the marines you meat you meet be fuck hench
S0041	yeah well they have to train with thirteen stone on their back
S0084	mm
S0041	that's more than me
S0084	yeah it's more than me i'm eleven stone
S0041	that's a lot
S0084	mm
S0041	like i i couldn't even if i really want to there's no way i could walk with you on my back never mind run couldn't do it
S0084	no no and they've gotta go on a hike
S0041	yeah like nine miles they have to do
S0084	yeah like in welsh mountains in the rain
S0041	i just i couldn't do that and i can't imagine any amount of train where i would be able to do that
S0084	i be gonna say cos you go from the navy don't you
S0041	mm
S0084	you don't go in as a marine
S0041	no i think you can think you might be able to
S0084	can you
S0041	yeah
S0084	god think you have to have be train
S0041	the only true you your training's much more difficult and even the entry requirements like their fitness test they'll run they run two so the first one they have to do in the same amount of minutes as me and the second one they have to do in ten minutes and they have to do the second one straight after the first one
S0084	what
S0041	yeah
S0084	they have to beat their time on the second run
S0041	so they run it yeah yeah so they run it and have to get my time and then even if you're forty there's no restriction like age bracket like in the navy
S0084	shit
S0041	and then after that i don't know how long they get but it's basically straight away they probably get a breather get a drink or something and then do it again but they have to do it in ten minutes
S0084	i don't know now
S0041	we're gonna learn to hate him
S0084	i already do hate him
S0041	with his moustache
S0084	do you ever have that french vhs tape at school moustache the cat and he use to speak french i use to watch it moustache
S0041	wow
S0084	he be a little french cat
S0041	aww
S0084	yes i think i think you um have miss out there we have moustache he be very cute
S0041	i think i might need moushtache
S0084	moushtaaaache
S0041	i remember watch couple of episodes of some type of spanish sitcom type thing
S0084	mhm
S0041	which be basically like our our version of fawlty tower like
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	he be a cleaner in a in a block of flats and it's like slapstick comedy
S0084	mm
S0041	definitely wasn't moustache

S0041	um think that's a lie

S0084	what be they do press up under water
S0041	um those funny ones you know you drop your bum
S0084	how weird
S0041	have you ever try do it
S0084	no be it really hard
S0041	yeah i can't do one you might be able to cos you beat me at press up the other day
S0084	umm i would've think it be easier cos that's how i do press up normally i drop my bum more than i drop my whole body
S0041	oh maybe i think the idea be that it's harder to drop drop the front the front of your the front of your chest so low
S0084	mm
S0041	i think that's it
S0084	mm why be there a helicopter just hang out there in case any of them drown
S0041	maybe ambulance airlift
S0084	ohh
S0041	yeah she try to tie her hair up out of her face and he push her in the water
S0084	nice
S0041	stop fannying on with your hair
S0084	well fair enough why isn't her hair tie up

S0084	master chief he's a meanie
S0041	oh yeah i forget he make them eat rubbish out of the bin not even have dinner
S0084	what what

S0084	do this not make you worry i mean i know you're not go in the marines but still
S0041	yes while i be watch it yesterday and i think i hope to god that this be really really extreme and that nothing like this would ever happen anywhere near at all ever look they're just fight to get dinners and stuff bloody ridiculous
S0084	shit oh my god that's intense
S0041	yeah and later on obviously must've not be able to have time to everything so they shove them back out again in a minute they they get they there's a really really bad bite after this really difficult train and you think holy shit how be they all still alive
S0084	mhm
S0041	and then he say right you've get three minutes to get something to eat and they run up and he have those trash can out like what they're put the rubbish in now and that's what he give them to eat

S0041	cos all the men like to just climb over wall
S0041	yeah
S0084	and how do the rest of them get up
S0041	i know what happen
S0084	cos they like tread on her head
S0041	so she be like help up all the massive heavy men look he just run and
S0084	jump on her back yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then how how do she get over they just leave her
S0041	no well the the thing be that she help up the last person properly the last person over be suppose to pull the last man over
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	so technically if she wasn't a woman and have that box that'd be her go now she'd'a fail the course because of that
S0084	jesus but then do they not be they not view all this be they not watch it all
S0041	yeah but nobody know that they're view it
S0084	mm
S0041	like like that guy who be the gun master chief person that just saw it through his gun rifle
S0084	ohh

S0084	they're all leave
S0041	yeah
S0084	not get emotional here
S0041	they just be all the way through they're like they're purposely try to make them fail all the time

S0041	yeah
S0084	and you'll be in the navy um just to say money she's already ask me to move back in and while i don't really want to it would be a good opportunity to not spend any money
S0041	yeah
S0084	ooh that'd be nice
S0084	mm
S0084	oh i've get my mum's version of talk to her cos i say that when we try to watch it on yours we couldn't get the subtitle to work and i didn't know if it be my disc but she's take a copy and say she's watch it and the subtitle work so

S0084	what be they do she's gotta pull herself in the boat
S0041	yeah and she doesn't make it
S0084	umm
S0041	and that stupid knob every time make some type of bad comment about her and so because he make the comment they all get put back in
S0041	but then they all blame it on her cos they're like oh you be the dead weight and then it's only just at this point where someone pull pull up the rest of the squad they say it's not her fault it's his fault for comment on it
S0084	aww
S0041	cos the whole point be that we should be a team
S0084	yeah men be so stupid
S0084	have they get um inflatable neck brace on or something
S0041	yeah
S0041	world war two
S0084	disgust isn't it i mean they have segregation in the in america until nineteen sixty eight
S0041	yeah that doesn't make sense to me at all
S0084	mm
S0041	that's so late
S0084	it's not very it's very it's very recent
S0041	it's so late
S0084	yeah
S0041	like in my head when i saw the picture of this happen you know you're see book and on film and stuff i think of it as be about nineteen forty nineteen thirty nineteen forty which to me
S0084	what the civil right movement
S0041	which to me yeah which to me be still late
S0084	mm
S0041	but that's that's what i think of segregation people on different bus that's when it happen
S0084	mm well yeah it be happen then but it be happen right during the forties fifties sixties
S0041	yeah
S0084	i mean rosa park who be the what they say be the start of the civil right movement when she refuse to give up her seat to a white person like she be um a sixty year old black woman travel home on the bus from work and obviously at that point there be segregation there be a black area of the bus and the black people have to sit out that be at the back
S0041	yeah
S0084	and she refuse to give up her seat to a white person and i don't think she be abuse but i think you know she be certainly shout at and that be the start when people would then sort of get involve and start have you know um start riot and start protest movements and that be nineteen fifty nine so that be really late and it wasn't until um jfk um abolish segregation and bring in the civil right act that um that that sort of thing be sort of make illegal but that wasn't until nineteen sixty five
S0041	that's crazy no that's that's not long ago
S0084	well no it's only fifty years isn't it
S0041	like people that
S0084	mm and certainly the mindset didn't change overnight d'you know what i mean like if you go to america most of the shitty job there be be do by black people just as if you come to this country most of the shitty job be be do by eastern europeans
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah yes it be still not equal by any mean yeah it's like men and women it's not equal here
S0041	no
S0084	it's not equal anywhere really
S0041	that's her husband

S0041	and he's give them information about her
S0084	he's such a massive knob
S0041	yeah you think he's be a knob but but he's actually do it because then any information about her that's be make available to the navy he know about
S0084	right

S0084	unfortunate
S0041	d'you find it strange how other culture think their music sound good and we don't
S0084	d'you not like any world music
S0041	yeah i like it but i i it shock me how the taste's so different like if somebody
S0084	mm
S0041	even in english start sing like this
S0084	mm
S0041	english people be like what's he wail at
S0084	yeah
S0041	d'you see d'you know what i mean
S0084	i can that yeah yeah absolutely but i suppose you can appreciate whether you like that something's good and you can like it but yeah obviously everyone's culture be gonna be different
S0041	mm like the way he sing the manner in which he sing
S0084	cos there's like the way that they play guitar be know as spanish guitar isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	the way that they pluck at the string rather than strum like it's a very spanish way of play but they think it sound good and you can think it sound good but yeah it be different
S0041	i suppose it's like the fashion be what i mean more like
S0084	mm
S0041	it's not fashionable in england to sing that way
S0084	yeah you wouldn't have someone in the chart sing like that
S0041	yeah
S0084	but i think people
S0041	in their chart they do
S0084	they do yeah i think there's there's quite a bite market for world music here so i think people do like it
S0041	for what
S0084	there's a big um there's a lot of uh interest in world music here
S0041	yeah
S0084	people really like it i suppose the more you travel the more you hear music from other countries
S0041	yeah apparently there's italian music on my ipod actually cos i would just put it on the random songs and just press skip i be like ooh ooh forget about you
S0084	and of course you've get like eurotrash stuff as well haven't you which be pretty bad
S0084	bet you do
S0041	yeah i do yeah i've get load of it
S0084	that's why you're not in charge us of the music ever
S0041	ever i'm not in charge of the music ever cos i have a horrendous taste in music
S0041	i openly admit it
S0041	i think when hilary duff come up on my uh
S0084	ah man alive
S0041	ipod be a tell tale sign
S0084	who be that hannah montana
S0041	kind of but before her
S0084	mm
S0041	she be lizzy mcguire
S0084	lizzy mcguire yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	see where be they now cos she's suppose to be in a coma
S0084	huhh just star at naked women
S0084	hm
S0041	can you run in a coma
S0084	i've no idea
S0084	so you can have no eye when you're in a coma
S0041	yeah you can be in a wake coma can't you my dad be in one for like three three four weeks
S0084	jesus christ

S0041	he didn't sleep for three weeks
S0084	he didn't sleep
S0041	he wouldn't sleep they keep give him shitloads of medication and he wouldn't go to sleep
S0084	so they call that a coma
S0041	it's a wake coma so
S0084	ohh
S0041	he be talk to people wander round and interact but he won't remember any of it because apparently it's all subconscious your body you you as you know you now be kinda shut off
S0084	be asleep how do they know that
S0041	yeah cos your body go to if your body go through trauma your body shut down to protect itself
S0084	yeah but how do they know that you're in a coma if you appear to be normal they ask you like test question something
S0041	yeah yeah if you don't know what what day it be stuff
S0084	mm
