S0416	mm
S0417	it's kind of nice it's really nice
S0416	mm
S0417	i'd love to go away with erm
S0416	have er have an amaze job
S0416	like amaze
S0417	who's
S0416	but be 's dad
S0417	oh okay
S0416	er he use to work a lot and he have an amaze job be an accountant when he when he be a bite younger
S0417	yeah yeah
S0416	now he can't really work as much so but three days a year he get he get to a job he get pay load of money
S0417	what for three days
S0416	three days a year
S0417	be that all he work
S0416	yeah
S0417	oh my god
S0416	he he be earn sixty i mean like he be sixty
S0417	yeah but still what how much money do he get
S0416	a lot of sixty year olds don't really work any more
S0417	well most most do now i mean you you can't retire until you're sixty
S0416	i i
S0417	i mean if you anything earlier than that be early retirement
S0416	mm
S0417	special retirement what do what what do he how much do he earn for three days in that year
S0416	i dunno he hasn't tell me
S0417	my god that be just so sew up isn't it
S0416	it's not like but they're not super rich though
S0417	well if you can afford to er pay for a big house and
S0416	erm that be a long time ago when he have like that twenty four seven
S0417	okay but if you can afford not to work the rest of the year and take holiday you be definitely in that upper upper bracket aren't you wow
S0416	mm yeah
S0417	mm i should've i should've marry a rich man i do oh you you've hear all about mister
S0416	mm
S0417	jam
S0416	yeah but i don't think it matter really about how much money they really have
S0417	well it do help i think
S0416	it do it do it do help but i don't think you should do it solely on how much money they have
S0417	no but i do it so the opposite so erm i didn't worry at all i didn't worry if anybody have like no money or anything like that
S0416	good keep do that
S0417	well i don't know if it's do me any favour but that's probably terribly cynical advice
S0416	well it's make you it's make you a good person
S0416	cos you'd be a bad person if you'd've marry for the money
S0417	it's not make me bitter have it
S0416	no
S0417	joke erm yeah but it do help
S0417	cos money money but then i suppose
S0417	i suppose for you if if you be gonna marry a woman yeah i'd hate you to marry a women who's just after your money if you be make load of money that would make me feel sad
S0416	yeah they're call gold diggers
S0417	yeah i suppose if you marry a woman who be like me work too i'd be really happy because i think that person's also you know erm get something about them they they know how to do a job so even if you do have kid together that a life outside of that and that kind of thing and we could just we'll just
S0416	yeah well i'm not that age yet i'm not that age yet
S0417	no i know no but
S0416	i don't really wanna talk about it yet
S0417	don't you
S0416	no because i know all that stuff already and i don't like it's like twenty years thirty years in the future so
S0417	yeah
S0416	i'm gonna be talk about that stuff all again then cos i've already talk about it
S0417	you don't like see these as pearl of wisdom that be just
S0416	no
S0417	i see yeah you'd rather talk about the next pok√©mon game
S0416	yep
S0417	but yeah i mean that's er that's really quite wealthy three days though that be quite there's not many people who could probably say that even david cameron probably couldn't say that
S0416	mm
S0417	well obviously he can't cos he work more
S0416	's not as rich as david cameron i don't know what you're on about isn't rich it's just like
S0417	people say that how could people say that if you're live in a very and you can you don't no hold on
S0416	first off they have they no no no you hold on
S0417	you hold on
S0416	yeah i've gotta say something
S0417	okay i'll listen
S0416	he be quite rich back in the day when he have when he have like he have that job twenty four seven well but obviously he get a bite he get pay a bite more every year because it's only three days a year
S0417	mm
S0416	so it's quite a bite more he get pay for his job now cos it's only three days
S0417	mm
S0416	but when he be work a lot he be get a lot of money and that's when he buy the house for good he doesn't have to pay any money now erm so it's it's his house and he buy all that stuff and he buy a car and he buy all all of that stuff and then he retire and he doesn't and then he kind of work like three days a year in a in a pretty good pay job he doesn't have to pay anything so if you think about that
S0417	but that be wealth isn't it because then you've get your house which er be worth a lot and that be be wealthy and i'm not put them down but that be be wealthy it's just i've know a lot of people who be quite wealthy i don't know for some reason keep say that they're not but i mean it's okay it's not if you've get wealth you've get wealth i mean it's just a fact isn't it there's nothing like good or bad about it it's quite neutral
S0416	yeah it's just when i think about be rich or i think about like sit back on like a thing where you have like twenty twenty personal assistants mow your garden
S0417	what you mean a super yacht well that that's like super rich isn't it that's super super wealth
S0416	david cameron probably have a really nice house and a lot more money than
S0417	yeah i mean his wife's get a load of money actually apparently david cameron his wife his wife be load
S0416	pardon
S0417	cos his her parent be very wealthy but yeah i i i use to be money doesn't matter at all but now i realise it do a bite but not to the point where you'd want it to make you greedy or horrible i agree with that
S0417	like it's nice to be able to you know
S0417	to give your give your kid everything isn't it
S0417	so maybe you should think about go into account it's actually not a bad job
S0416	mum i'm i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do a job that i hate because i might be the richest man in the world but i'd be depress
S0417	why would you hate account
S0416	i i think i would really would hate account
S0417	i think i i wouldn't mind it actually maybe i should become an accountant do you think it's too late
S0416	yeah
S0417	oh thank you just have no hesitation oh my god what do you do you think i'm er over the hill
S0416	no i don't think you're rich and it'd cost a lot of money to become a good accountant
S0417	i think yeah you have to take lot of exams and i think
S0416	exactly
S0417	to erm to get very good clients which give you a lot of money
S0416	you have to have a lot of money
S0417	i think no yeah partly you have to have a but you you have to have good contact and i've get no good contact do you know your grandfather my sorry your great grandfather
S0416	no
S0417	my grandfather
S0416	i didn't
S0417	be now you're just be facetious erm
S0416	i don't know my grandfather
S0417	be be an accountant
S0416	mm
S0417	be an accountant
S0417	grandpa's dad
S0417	he be the first catholic accountant because do you know at that time
S0416	not in the world
S0417	no in scotland at that time there be protestant accountants and they wouldn't employ a catholic
S0417	erm so anyway he become an accountant and er he be a really really well respect man really good man he use to help he use to use his money and his cos he he get quite erm well know he use to use to help out football team that kind of thing and the manager come to his funeral and that kind of thing
S0416	mm
S0417	he use to get apparently he use to get load of erm gift every christmas like like turkey send and things because he would help some people out especially some people who be poor and didn't have that much money he'd he'd do the work for them for like nothing or very little and so because they be so grateful for years they just use to send him stuff and but whenever my erm my dad your grandpa go back to anybody hear he's his son he he just say it's amaze sometimes people just come out of the woodwork and say do you oh do you realise that my he really help my dad get a job because he you know he saw he didn't have anything so he introduce him to this man who could give him you know he do load of things he never talk about it he be really humble so he nobody really even know he be do all this good stuff he be very quiet about it but yeah he be a really really amaze man but he do that through accountancy which sound a very bore job but he be anyway so you've get it in the family as well
S0416	yeah it's just if i do that i'd probably be depress
S0417	you've get two mouth you've get like a chocolate one and a real one it look really funny you can't make it it go it's it's go in a smiley way i don't think you can make it go in an unhappy way
S0417	so what job would you do
S0416	oh scientist
