S0110	mm
S0167	mm this breakfast be good thank dad thank dad
S0104	this be yum yum
S0167	this be yummy scrummy in my tummy
S0104	you think they'll take all the erm recycle at the side of the bin
S0110	well 's get two out there so er
S0104	mm
S0167	i guess everyone would if they over the christmas period they thingy it what do they expect
S0104	i know do some but he hasn't today because quite often he have a couple of box beside his
S0167	i don't suppose the actual bin men actually give a poo do they
S0104	no well they do
S0167	i don't suppose they give a poo they'll probably just take it
S0104	three people in a house how they manage to produce the amount of stuff that they do
S0110	ours be you can't get into ours so old bottle
S0104	i know
S0110	you can't get into his because it's one one box of er thornton's chocolates amongst all the spray aerosols and clean it's great isn't it
S0104	well that's what he fill up his thing cos he's an obsessive cleaner isn't he
S0110	yeah yeah there's load of spray
S0167	so bad for the environment
S0104	i know and he hasn't get a wash line so i can only think that summer no matter what time of year he tumble dry everything
S0167	tumble dry oh that's terrible isn't it
S0104	he never hang his clothe up
S0167	well
S0104	i know i get a bite embarrass about our recycle bin sometimes
S0167	well what would you rather have a recycle bin full of aerosols or a recycle bin full of wine bottle
S0104	a bottle of wine
S0104	i think it show the difference in lifestyle
S0167	i think it show the very difference in lifestyle i'd rather have your one
S0110	he's clean and we're piss
S0167	yeah
S0110	shamble with his
S0104	live in squalor
S0167	or he's bore and you have fun
S0110	ah that's another way of look at it
S0167	do they have anyone round for christmas
S0104	don't know they have a really bore
S0104	i can't imagine what they do the three of them
S0167	just probably really bore like probably just watch christmas telly eat a bite of turkey but i bet they didn't even have crackers
S0104	he doesn't eat turkey oh no i don't think she be
S0110	no
S0104	cos i think i remember him say he cook meat for them but he wouldn't eat it
S0167	why because he care about animal right yeah he like
S0104	yeah but then he'll go out on the field and fee all the sheep up make them nice and plump ready for our dinner give them all his bread
S0167	he's a kind man
S0104	he do associate better with animals than humans that's true
S0167	i'm surprise they never get another cat after
S0167	after i'm surprise they never just buy another one
S0104	i think they be too traumatise
S0167	we just every time ours disappear we
S0104	with another one
S0110	you remember when use to go out there that last for months didn't it
S0104	yeah
S0167	he go the same time as didn't he
S0104	mm more or less and that's why i think cos they be both quite long haired
S0167	yeah i think they be steal
S0104	i i think they be take
S0167	ah i hope they weren't torture
S0104	no i hope they be take for nice reason
S0110	for floppiness reason
S0104	mm
S0167	yeah no one take old short haired do they
S0104	no
S0167	well what would you do with a long haired cat
S0104	well i don't know
S0167	be there a market for cat fur
S0104	oh well i don't know what about the one hundred and one dalmatians
S0167	yeah but that's a dalmatian fur what's a black fluffy cat gonna give you
S0104	i don't know
S0167	a rug
S0104	i think there be they could be pass off as
S0104	pedigree you know some people like a i don't know i just really hope that
S0167	i hope they be resold and then
S0104	i hope she didn't have a horrible
S0167	death
S0104	what can you do about it so we get little instead
S0167	ah
S0104	i do love though
S0110	i don't love that ginger thing

S0167	he's very fat
S0104	very fat get like a lion's mane around his neck

S0167	yeah he'd probably be more attractive if he be thinner
S0104	we've get this ginger tom that keep hang around here
S0167	mm
S0104	he come in spit and spat he'll disappear for weeks and weeks
S0110	and then he'll spat
S0104	and then he'll suddenly appear and he keep try to sneak well he do sneak in sometimes i know because he spray cos sometimes you get up in the morning
S0167	er
S0104	and the house absolutely reek and you can't it sort of it doesn't not in any one particular area it's just all over
S0167	oh god

S0167	probably just cos it just go round eat all the other cat's food
S0104	mm maybe but he hasn't be in to spray for oh a long long time have he but there be a period when it be happen all the time
S0167	oh that's so annoy

S0104	no honey honey
S0110	i be observe what would happen
S0167	yes
S0110	with there be a woman
S0104	oh bless you
S0167	sorry
S0110	with about six kid you know
S0167	yeah
S0110	she get that amount of of
S0104	mm
S0110	napkins out and put them on the table and they be literally about three inch high
S0167	okay
S0104	right
S0110	and they have about what you know four or
S0104	people always take way too many of those
S0110	i know i don't understand why that's not be
S0104	mm cos you're always you're always do don't you
S0110	yeah yeah yeah
S0104	you always take way more than we need

S0167	yeah yeah it's er i really think they'd just give you a napkin at the thing
S0110	well not yeah it do seem a strange way of
S0167	they do well they do that in the i think it's just ease of like stuff cos in the airport when they collect everyone's stuff i notice that lot of people hadn't eat their little pot of jam like unopened pot of jam or butter and things and they just leave them on their plat they should have just come round shove the lot in the bin put some on plat i would have think they could just go straight back in the
S0110	well i think yeah it's probably health and safety isn't it
S0104	mm
S0167	yeah but they're unopened
S0110	i know i know
S0104	do you know what
S0110	what

S0104	on my arm
S0110	and it drop and it look like you'd just sort of wipe your nose on that
S0167	dad
S0104	why be you such a girl
S0104	you're such a baby you're such a scream young girl
S0167	that be a very sexist comment you just make mum

S0104	oh buy macafem
S0110	i dunno
S0104	i just try another one where it say read more as well and it wouldn't react to that either
S0110	well that's alright
S0167	erm yeah do you know potatoes originally come from peru
S0104	erm no i think they come from where do i think they come from where do raleigh go raleigh bring the first potato back didn't he
S0167	from from peru
S0104	oh be it peru i think it be the americas oh i suppose that be
S0167	yeah
S0104	okay but i be think i be think usa
S0167	american yeah
S0104	erm
S0167	yes they erm well they be actually discover by the spanish before the english but i guess
S0104	well yeah i don't i'm say after he bring the first potatoes back to england
S0167	oh okay yeah the spanish yeah apparently okay so the spanish discover these new things call potatoes and they try them and like them and take them back to spain
S0104	yeah
S0167	and they start be use all over europe
S0104	yeah
S0167	and because they be a really cheap way of feed workers and all of that erm and but the french wouldn't accept potatoes as part of their natural diet
S0104	the french never do do they
S0167	for about three hundred years or some long amount of time because in their they have a very strong class system and the upper class eat things that grow above the grind and the and the underclasses grow thing er eat things that grow below the grind
S0104	right
S0167	and so erm it be not see as proper that an upper class would eat a potato because it's a root
S0104	right oh
S0167	erm and so it wasn't part of their diet and for a very very long time because of that reason
S0104	mm
S0167	cos it wasn't see as a proper thing to eat but apparently there be about three thousand varieties of potato in peru before the spanish get there and now there's about one thousand
S0104	why
S0167	of just i don't know they've just die off they've just i don't know i think i think because they use to grow wild they weren't cultivate before that people would just pick them wild and then when the spanish come and everything they start be cultivate so there be only about there be only a few choose as you know ones to grow and gradually the other varieties just die off
S0104	oh
S0167	so that's the story of potatoes
