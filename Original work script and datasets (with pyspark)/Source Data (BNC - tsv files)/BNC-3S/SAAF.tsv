S0654	see waterfall picture
S0653	okay
S0655	mum
S0653	mm
S0655	why do good always triumph over evil
S0653	mm i don't know i mean most of the time it do i guess because most people be good so in the end they're not gonna stick with a bad person what do you think
S0655	mm well sometimes there's not really good and or a bad because most people think they're the good guy and the other ones be the bad guy
S0653	mm i think i think some some people don't necessarily think they're the good guy but they think that they be right
S0654	crackers
S0653	in their beliefs
S0654	crackers
S0653	sorry
S0654	please may i have some crackers
S0653	you want some crackers you can have that after
S0655	although
S0653	your roll
S0655	guy you know people think guy fawkes be erm a very bad person
S0653	well the king the people who support the king do
S0655	but actually i think guy fawkes be the good guy because he even though he do want to blow up the house of parliament he a king tell him and his friends that he they couldn't have their belief
S0653	exactly
S0655	in how the world be make and they have to go to his church if they want to pray and he didn't agree to that so he just do what he think be right
S0653	mm
S0655	but most people didn't cos they didn't cos they didn't want to get execute like him
S0654	but that's why they have fireworks night without him there wouldn't be a special occasion which i love cos i get free hotdogs
S0655	you don't get free hotdogs
S0653	that's true i remember once tell a chinese student why we have fireworks night and she think it be very strange that we remember kill somebody in such a beautiful way
S0653	but yes it be nice to have fireworks
S0655	mm mm
S0653	or odd
S0655	erm we would probably have figure out another way for fireworks
S0653	well we've always sort of have bonfires around that time
S0654	for kill people
S0655	like easter eve
S0654	what's easter eve
S0655	the day before easter
S0654	mm
S0655	and father's day eve
S0653	do you think darth vader's properly evil though isn't he but i suppose he think that that he's on the right side
S0654	no he be
S0655	emperor palpatine technically be the main bad guy
S0653	mm
S0655	it's like kylo ren he just want he's just a darth vader groupie
S0654	yeah because darth vader erm he
S0655	i'm guess he erm he didn't know how darth vader come to die
S0654	well
S0655	cos darth vader become good
S0653	well darth vader be relate to him actually
S0655	mm

S0653	i don't think they think he give birth
S0655	well he
S0653	but be the father of rey
S0655	yeah
S0653	mm
S0654	last film which say which tell us about what like
S0655	although i wonder
S0654	oh she's here

S0653	mm
S0655	i wonder
S0653	who his her mum be and things

S0653	well this be a sort of set in kind of roughly medieval time isn't it so they didn't have witch then

S0653	even in scotland but if they have
S0654	they do believe in the welsh dragon
S0653	in the welsh dragon
S0654	they do believe in
S0655	leprechauns
S0653	this be
S0654	yeah
S0653	that's in ireland this you're look at
S0654	oh
S0653	scotland they would've be scar if there have be a witch
S0654	be it ireland would have the loch ness
S0653	it's scotland that's just a myth though a legend
S0654	they
S0655	for now
S0654	well they do believe in legends
S0653	mm
S0654	so could've believe of the loch ness
S0653	i'm not sure how old the loch ness
S0655	mm mm
S0653	legend be though
S0654	over a thousand years
S0653	how do you know that
S0655	a loch ness monster must be old
S0653	mm
S0654	well the teacher
S0655	do not
S0654	she say i think it's one thousand years old
S0653	mm mm
S0654	because they do
S0655	and who be the teacher you
S0654	miss
S0653	i don't think it's that old
S0654	well
S0653	and it's a big it's a big lake i'm sure more people would've spot it
S0654	it's a legend mum
S0653	oh
S0655	it's a monster
S0654	i dunno she just tell me there be a legend
S0653	most countries have a sort of legend about a giant beast like a dinosaur type figure
S0655	what's our one
S0653	saint george and the dragon
S0655	well actually but
S0654	what what's wales's one because they they make friends with the with the red dragon
S0653	mm yes
S0655	i be go to say that saint george wasn't famous for slay the dragon
S0653	what be he famous for
S0655	he be famous for say that no for say no to the king about have to be erm have to have a different religion and not be able to do his normal beliefs and he and that's how he die he become a marty
S0653	a martyr
S0655	martyr
S0653	but that's not yeah but that's not the legend the legend that's grow up it's the same thing about king arthur
S0655	king arthur
S0653	king arthur didn't exist in the way we imagine it
S0655	how be king arthur then
S0653	well cos we always think of king arthur as a a king of medieval england but there be an arthur sort of in charge of an area of england i think in the fifth century but nothing like you know it wasn't at the time when they have joust and knight and shin armour erm
S0654	medieval
S0653	so they and and you know stone castle it wasn't like that at all but people have always like that those stories that legend
S0654	yeah but what's wales's legend i mean what beast do they have they've get
S0653	well yes the red dragon as you say
S0654	no they make friends with the red dragon
S0653	yeah but dragons didn't exist really though do they
S0655	do we know that
S0654	they do make friends with it but what's the beast because the loch ness
S0653	well the loch ness be not a nasty creature
S0655	it's never be know to do destruction
S0654	and what do it
S0653	it's just a big animal
S0654	but what do it do
S0653	doesn't do anything it just stay in the lake
S0655	yeah it's like a giant sea snake
S0653	it's like a dinosaur it's like a no not a pterodactyl what's the one ones that go in the water can't remember now
S0654	amphibians
S0655	diplodocus
S0653	sorry
S0653	diplodocus no but it look sort of slightly like a diplodocus but the reason why they have these legends be because at some point they will've see you know the fossilise print of a dinosaur and think oh what be that that must've be a big animal that use to walk on the earth and be no longer or there's often legends about giants you know
S0655	oh yeah
S0653	cos everyone think that there there be a time before when there be er giants roam the earth
S0655	we find we haven't find any footprints yet
S0653	no but it's funny that it's quite common to most civilisations but then they have find you know in prehistoric time absolutely giant snake and giant er crocodiles you know
S0655	oh yeah i hear of this giant snake that be like er bigger it could wrap itself round this house
S0653	absolutely enormous so there's a there's a a model of one i show it to you a couple of years ago in an american museum and it's just
S0655	yeah
S0653	absolutely huge you know and the same thing if you saw er one of those crocodiles it would just be really scary so so there be giants around weren't there in a sense but just not people
S0654	yeah
S0653	mm
S0655	it's weird how far legends go
S0654	but they be true in a way because there be really big people who be really strong just like
S0655	yeah they're
S0654	and they're kind of giants but they're not the huge ones which could look at this house and go hello hello
S0655	well i could tell you a fact about legends
S0653	mm
S0655	they're base on the truth
S0653	not necessarily
S0655	no legends be mean to be base on the truth
S0653	no they're not they're just mean it's first of all it's a story it usually have a mean doesn't it
S0655	yeah
S0653	it have a mean behind it that doesn't necessarily mean it's true
S0655	no not true but
S0653	but it's an important thing to know about
S0654	well
S0655	yeah it could sometimes it have a little bite of truth in cos because you know the dragon for
S0653	mm
S0655	well you know there may have be a there may have be a giant snake that could well could've be something that
S0653	but just not around sorry carry on
S0655	yeah in prehistoric time that may have save that that certain place
S0653	no no no because the what i'm say be er the we be not around at the time be we i think that storytellers look at the print on the grind and think oh my goodness
S0653	there be obviously some giant animal roam the earth i wonder why it doesn't why it's not here any more that must be because some brave hero rescue us against it that's what i'm that's where it come from i think they take inspiration from their surround you know
S0655	yeah
S0655	which be so it mean it's a little bite true but not true true but not true
S0653	well it's not a sort of it's not a lie it's a it's a story of explain something isn't it
S0654	can i speak
S0655	i'm try to find the right word for it
S0653	but it always
S0653	for me it always come back to humanity yes
S0654	there be a legend which be true in wales that the build and the sea be draw as a picture the build the tree the house under the sea
S0653	what be that then
S0654	the legend tell us
S0653	i don't remember it what be it
S0654	one night there be this build which which have house and tree
S0653	mm
S0654	around it
S0653	mm
S0654	and it be right across the sea and they build this gate around it so you they close it so the tide can come in
S0653	mm
S0654	but somebody forget to close it so the wave come in and all the house and the tree sink to the bottom go to the bottom of the sea legend have it that there be that they be still there today and i know it's true cos send me a cos give us a picture
S0653	of it a photograph
S0654	a picture of a picture of a forest under the sea
S0655	what would be really scary
S0654	mm
S0655	if they be still alive and they have grow gills and flippers like when harry potter eat
S0653	yeah
S0655	that gillyweed and they'd be like ahh
S0653	have become amphibian
S0655	yeah and then they'd
S0654	and the tree
S0655	and then whenever someone go back to there they would jump out and drag them under the sea ah
S0653	i mean it's not necessarily true it's just that people have find something that look like that could be there
S0655	well
S0653	but it's like the legend of the green children isn't it they've all
S0655	huh
S0653	i tell you that all the time the the green children of woolpit which be a village in suffolk near to where i use to teach and it's
S0655	oh la la
S0653	er and it's record in a couple of different book and it's about the story of these the this brother and sister that be find by other children in the village and they be completely green in their complexion in their skin and the boy be kind of very sad and die but the girl eventually er she would only eat green bean for a long time but then she do eventually eat other things and then she lose her green ness on her skin and learn to talk and she then explain to them that they come from a different place erm and where it be always dark all the time and that they hear music so they follow the music and they come out into the sunlight and there they be and then eventually she marry a local person
S0654	but why do the boy die
S0653	cos he didn't want to be there and he just sort of pin away and didn't eat
S0655	what do pin away mean
S0653	when you're really sad about something and you want to kind of go back to somewhere you kind of give up but it's such an interest story oh and woolpit which be a village forty minutes from here it originally mean wolf pit so they find these children in a wolf pit and as i say
S0653	it's in two er write twice two different write and i just think it's there must be something behind there mustn't there there must be some sort of truth because it's get record of her baptism and things in a church
S0655	what
S0653	and i
S0655	that be just
S0653	it's a bite weird isn't it
S0655	mm well actually there be this lady who eat load and load and load of carrots and her skin eventually get an orange tinge to it
S0653	yeah
S0655	so that so they might've actually become green from eat all that green food
S0653	well and especially if she be in a place where they be hide in cave or something so she didn't have any sunlight perhaps her face would've be green but i
S0655	or she would've just felt very ill
S0653	yeah but i've always find it really interest
S0653	and the fact they didn't speak any english for years i just find it fascinate there must be some sort of truth behind that particular legend i think or there's a er legend base on a place in erm call swaffham in norfolk about now i won't be able to remember all of it but about a man who have a dream that he be go to find riches in london so he go all the way to london
S0654	oh yeah
S0653	erm and he
S0655	mm mm mm
S0653	can you remember
S0654	i can and he
S0655	dick whittington
S0653	no it's not dick whittington but it's very similar he meet somebody who tell him that she or he or she'd have a dream about someone find treasure in their own back garden so he then go all the way back to swaffham dig up his garden and then there be load of treasure in the back garden
S0653	and again you just think well there must be some kind of truth about it because it's a name person in a particular village
S0654	i've get an idea maybe it's
S0655	well to be fair
S0653	hang on
S0654	maybe it's erm if you you when you travel far away
S0653	mm
S0654	if you if you if you try really hard then someone who then someone might tell you your truth
S0653	yeah i mean it but it's a it's a really cool legend
S0654	yeah
S0653	it's it's get an actual specific real village name in it
S0654	yeah
S0653	it's not that it's completely make up so there there must be there must be some some kind of truth in there
S0655	i'm guess that they say they would find their riches in london and he kind of do
S0653	well he kind of do and he need to make that journey and that's the hero's journey isn't it be that actually he could've just if the dream have be more specific he could've just you know dig up his back garden but the point of it be that he travel all that way and learn lot of things and er kind of find himself discover who he be but it's a really good story isn't it i think
S0655	who be he a person who dig a person who dig in his back garden but doesn't plant flower
S0653	i don't know but he do give
S0653	some money to the church you know he wasn't greedy with it
S0655	mm i mean some people some idiots i think might eat gold cos they'll say mm chocolate coin mm chocolate coin ouch
S0653	i don't think anybody would think that darling
S0655	people who be starve to death maybe oh i wonder what
S0653	if they're starve to death they've get some gold then they'll sell it and
S0655	mm
S0653	they'll get some food won't they
S0655	but if they're in the middle of a desert
S0653	mm
S0655	then they'll be wish they be in the middle of a dessert
