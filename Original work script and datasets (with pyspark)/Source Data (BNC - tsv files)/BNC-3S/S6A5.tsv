S0012	yeah
S0152	all in one and er i think we must have be in there around about four hours
S0012	oh
S0152	it be really it be it be really interest and er we have some conversations about the ship and and people didn't realise how how many people go from liverpool and as you walk in to the maritime museum there's all about children hundred thousand children be move to different countries like canada australia
S0013	yeah
S0152	barbados because the parent didn't want them any more
S0012	well
S0013	awful
S0152	you know and the and the and the government's way of do it be
S0012	that be in the sixties wasn't it
S0013	yeah
S0152	er yeah early sixties it be just after the war as well yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	not that long ago in when you put it into a time frame
S0012	i remember them all go from from liverpool to australia and and they have queue of little kid go
S0152	yeah and it be like oh and that kind of make you think and some of the build on the on the front of liverpool on the dock cunard build type thing cunard build they be one of the biggest people transport they have children to other countries and you kind of think okay do they make their money out of that
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know so that be interest and then we go through the maritime and stuff and there be really good display and then there be this display and it be about we could be who we want to be when we be on the on the merchant ship etcetera and it be about and it it's it do say hello sailor
S0012	oh do it
S0152	and when you read it it be about homosexuals and things
S0012	oh be it yeah
S0152	and how they felt out at sea they could do what they want they wasn't under the jurisdiction of anything and could be free and they prosecute and
S0012	that's where you get me over a barrel come from innit
S0152	yeah things like that
S0012	yeah
S0152	and that be like and it like why have they put that up here i say because that's what happen out at sea that that's tell you about how and they've get this special language that they use be with a p i can't remember poyet or something like that where certain word mean certain things
S0012	yeah
S0152	and if you use them people know that you be that way incline
S0012	oh i see
S0152	but you be and you be safe well they shouldn't have that here pardon do you really say that
S0152	be i you know that's part of the history of the maritime and everything that go with it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	and then it be like oh and then we get into another bite of a conversation and i i'm think be you try to wind me up here or be you just be a norfolk girl as i put it
S0152	be you try to be a norfolk girl be you in the sense that you're gonna make comment which you know you shouldn't really be make type thing
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	which be not really appropriate if you be a human be at the end of the day you may you know whatever you think so we get up onto the slavery floor and i think that really hit home in in some respect just how these big concern be actually make them money by trade in slavery
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	for the spice and gold and stuff like that
S0012	the east india company and the they do all that too didn't they

S0012	you know i mean you get really good er train of think different train of think when you go to university cos you get teach in a different way
S0152	yeah
S0012	and that's what's really interest
S0152	she you know and it be like well they should be out at work do work on the job and i say well look i say there isn't much difference between i say there's your we go to school at the same time i say but the school that i go to when you're in the sixth form it's a comprehensive school they they try to push you to not push you they encourage you to go to university
