S0416	naruto it's a japanese anime an anime be like a carton in in japanese style so they don't do as much of like real life act they do it in cartoon but it's not like a kids' cartoon it's like what i guess it's not like it's not like that thing where you're like run off a cliff and then you're still like run and then you only realise it and then you fall down do you know what i mean
S0417	right hold on i've just get to get a form hold on i don't really get that worry run it off a cliff anyway
S0416	because you know in cartoon
S0417	yeah
S0416	you know how they just make everything really silly usually
S0417	yeah
S0416	like in erm erm what's that one with the ostrich and it's just run and then there's like the wolf thing that try to eat it
S0417	oh yeah
S0416	yeah and then eventually a lot of the time he'll chase it and then he'll be in the edge of like in the air on a cliff and still be run and then only when he look down he fall
S0417	oh oh i see
S0416	silly cartoon bite
S0417	yeah but the yeah i think they're suppose to be quite good some of them but some of them aren't suppose to be pretty graphic and a little bite violent aren't they the ones that i hear although some of them be good
S0416	it's possible that's like that's like just say some tv show be like that cos anime be anime be everything basically
S0417	right i'm just check that the ones you're watch aren't be they
S0416	no
S0417	yeah okay do you like kiwis

S0416	plat tectonic plat
S0417	yeah i mean well it's very hard to predict
S0416	melt lava melt lava
S0417	or you might see it in the film that why would they not predict that why would it be commotion cos cos around san san francisco around there they're cos obviously it's very important for them to know when it's go to come
S0416	because it's because they're they always put strain on each other if they're goinna make an earthquake and eventually they snap but you never know when it be go to snap that's

S0417	that's bad
S0416	mm mm
S0417	what like every day
S0416	most days
S0417	who mock you not your friends surely
S0416	no not really occasionally but that's just kind of like a funny kid just like just kid but other people i just hate them but it's old news
S0417	well it's really not i mean don't your teachers
S0416	they do it for my three years of primary school as well
S0417	well i didn't think they do it much whenever anyone else ask you about it it be like well it wasn't much just every now and again
S0416	the first year and a half they do a lot of the first half year this year they do it a lot just because they're new people
S0417	mm they're not in lessons and things surely with all the teachers around
S0416	no not really just in yards just if they see me they'll just go alright in just like a really bad english accent and like with their friends and they just laugh
S0417	have you tell the teacher that cos they shouldn't be do that in the yard either
S0417	you okay you bump your head
S0417	
S0416	mm mm
S0417	have you tell any of your teachers about that
S0416	mm no
S0417	cos you know if somebody have like an irish accent

S0416	yeah i'm not affect by it anymore doesn't matter just yeah doesn't matter
S0417	well i can still say something if you want me to
S0416	no that'll probably make it worse to be honest it's not like i'm heavily affect by it
S0417	mm it still shouldn't happen and it's the teachers' responsibility to have a place where that kind of thing doesn't go on
S0416	mm mm
S0416	it didn't happen as much in for the last year and a half or like two and a half years or whatever because they do enforce a lot of no bully like they always come in to talk about no bully
S0417	yeah
S0416	they don't really anymore well as much
S0417	yeah there's a bite more of a like ah kid get on with it attitude in secondary but i don't i don't know if it's always good cos i think you've still get to keep an eye on things and people go there to learn and if you're get stick just for be a for learn then on something that you can't control then i do think
S0416	mm mm
