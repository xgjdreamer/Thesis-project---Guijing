S0152	yeah
S0012	cos they say oh why should we have to do that
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and they all create a a sort of a a gang that disbelieve in anything
S0152	mm yeah and they just push it and then and then if you be firm in the sense that no you don't do that this be what you need to be do it's like oh it's bore in here isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0152	you can't mess about
S0013	oh dear mm shame isn't it cos they should have they should be have such fun really
S0012	well when we be when i be at school
S0013	and you'd be like till you leave school
S0012	yeah but when i be at school all the disruptive children be take out i think they go up somewhere didn't they they go somewhere else so they they just weren't tolerate at school
S0013	mm
S0012	and that they be stream right down to d stream but i think everybody behave theirself you know someone bad fight with the boys and someone get stab but that be it
S0152	yeah i mean there's there's not it's just this i don't wanna go to this lesson so i'll walk off
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it's and it's get and it's go how it use to be
S0012	yeah
S0152	i don't think they you can put in but there we go
S0012	no
S0152	twenty four twenty four million pound build and you've get no wall on your classroom
S0013	yes
S0012	that's a bite er stupid ain't it
S0152	your breakout space be well sorry breakout space be not
S0013	well over the years they must've have so so many format to the school that they know exactly what it should be
S0152	you know so why
S0013	and then they don't put wall in
S0152	one one one group of one group of erm academies want it one way and one group of academies want it another way
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know want this academy to have a bridge between the two section well i'm sorry but
S0013	yeah
S0152	why cos the kid cos
S0012	mm
S0152	because a it cause problems cos when the kid walk across it they drop things over the top and it's all the way down
S0012	that's right yeah
S0152	right so and that that's and that wasn't a problem but that's start to be a problem
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm it's a waste it be a you know the glass panel that go all along it be sixty thousand because the height of the thing wasn't high enough so they have to put safety glass in
S0012	well of course they do yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	you know little things little things like that
S0012	yeah huh
S0013	like you say there's nothing wall space you could put anything
S0152	get no wall you know i my classroom where i teach my time be two classrooms next to each other no wall on the corridor
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0012	that's a bite stupid ain't it
S0013	mm
S0012	open plan
S0152	you know so when the so our lessons be usually like two hours or an hour and a half so when there's a changeover lesson you get all the noise and you might get a a student who's be silly come into your classroom
S0012	yeah
S0012	that's a bite that's daft ain't it daft
S0013	i think they be you know cos you complain about it didn't you when they build the school
S0152	yeah
S0013	build the academy and then
S0152	i this great big
S0013	they haven't change it then
S0152	no this great big space which be the ideal of you put two or three class in there and you teach and you put lot of students in well you can't do it because the kid interact if you've get sixty kid in one room
S0012	oh dear
S0013	mm
S0152	try to teach them with a great big projector you're still gonna need three staff in there
S0012	yeah
S0152	to get all the way round
S0013	yeah
S0152	it's just like er it's just dire
S0152	so they so they've put a they've they've put half a wall up they've put half a wall up but they couldn't finish it off because they haven't get enough money
S0152	so you know it's like
S0013	they cost millions these academies don't they
S0152	you know this high school here's another one this high school be sit on one point three million in the bank
S0012	really
S0152	and they're happy to make people redundant
S0012	what well
S0013	mm
S0152	be that not you're not suppose to be make a profit in education
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0152	but sit on one they're sit on one point three million
S0012	well how come how do they make well they get allocate so much money
S0152	they're just not spend it
S0012	and they don't spend it
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's very strange because er er years ago each er when i use to go work for my mum and dad the firm like and and all the build firm have so much money to spend and if they hadn't spend it before april they didn't get so much the next year
S0152	mm
S0012	so they just spend it all
S0152	yeah
S0012	you know they have this that and the other don't they build some lovely place you know and they build good house because they spend it all i mean you only gotta go round to see some of the house that build or that
S0152	yeah
S0012	build fantastic place
S0152	yeah
S0012	because they have the money and they have to spend it
S0152	it use to be the same in education you use to have to if you hadn't spend your budget by the end of the year
S0012	yeah you get
S0152	use to be take off and then it use to be reallocate
S0012	yeah that's right
S0013	yeah so that's not the case any more at all
S0012	but now you don't have to spend it
S0152	no well we're probably
S0013	they just keep the money
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0013	it's a funny system now isn't it
S0012	it be a weird system

S0012	mm
S0012	we have to fill in the crack before we can do it
S0013	
S0012	it's quite amaze how much that that crack
S0013	mm
S0012	and all the all all around the edge of the plus they didn't put any up when they put the plasterboard up
S0013	in the ceiling
S0012	in the ceiling
S0013	yeah
S0012	so that the ceiling's sort of crack away
S0013	not very well make at all really

S0013	no but you weren't down here to watch them or anything
S0152	oh
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0012	i think when we be build this house the i put up be hundreds weren't they
S0013	yeah too many in the first one didn't you
S0012	i use too many in the first one
S0013	in the kitchen
S0012	well that plasterboard be very heavy you know and
S0013	mm
S0012	you know if you miss out a couple of space you'd get it sort of
S0152	it bow
S0013	mm
S0152	it bow so
S0013	then we gotta get up there and lag it
S0012	yeah we get the lag
S0013	we buy the wrong type
S0012	we buy the wrong type though
S0013	but we just cut them in half i think
S0012	yeah we buy the ones to go over the top of the ones that be already lag
S0013	mm
S0012	you know
S0012	you're suppose to have about that much lag now ain't you
S0152	mm
S0012	well we get we get lag up here all in between the joists then you're suppose to go over the top of the joists aren't you
S0013	mm
S0012	i don't see how that'd work out if you want to put any board down
S0152	you can't can you
S0012	no
S0152	but the board will lag it though won't it
S0012	that would do yeah yeah
S0152	board would lag it
S0012	you can buy the special board now with the fibre on one side with the with the aluminium foil so it'll reflect all the heat back now cos it's surprise how much heat get lose in the ceilings
S0152	mm
S0012	well when you think about heat rise anyway
