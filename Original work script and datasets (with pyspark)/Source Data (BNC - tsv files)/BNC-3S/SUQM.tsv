S0008	saw the package when he be suppose to sort them out
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er there'd be perhaps about thirty odd pack in a trolley or something
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then you know we start about eight o'clock and then at midnight the midnight train would come in and we'd have to unload some more trolleys you know depend it could be about another ten or twenty or thirty even sometimes
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er we're suppose to spend all night sort out these trolleys right well we'd get in there at eight and there'd only about two of us there three of us and we start sort these trolleys out and this guy he be he wasn't the boss but he be sort of like the big brash bloke tell everyone what to do
S0012	yeah
S0008	we use to have this sort of rule that you weren't allow to do more than twelve twelve trolleys
S0008	then we use to stop by which time it be about ten o'clock and then we'd kip down for a couple of hours till the train come in
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then we'd unload them trolleys just stash them away then we'd kip down for another couple of hours
S0008	and then well then we have to go upstairs after that and you know an hour before we go cos i use to get a lot of catalogue and things
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	cos there be two big erm you know sort of er what do you call them these ah catalogue house
S0012	oh yeah yeah
S0008	you know and they use to ship out all these thousands of catalogue
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	and we have to put them into the areas where we go to and then bind them up into bundle and there be always stack and stack of these things to go out but we'd only do it about you know an hour or less and then we'd go home you could easily clear the whole bloody lot
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know what i mean
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	could easily have do if you work right through
S0012	that's terrible innit
S0008	but these people these you know these blokes who work there for years they have to cos you have to register what you'd do
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they didn't want to let it be know that it be possible for to do everything
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	otherwise they'd say oh how come this day suddenly
S0012	yeah
S0008	you'd do all this whereas before you'd only be do so much of a day
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know er we use to go there just sort of like turn out with a sleep bag
S0008	really cos you know
S0012	yeah i go one when i use to work at there be we have the time and motion people come around
S0008	oh yeah
S0012	cos i be work on the cap and lag and and set them all up and do and er the foreman come up he say look it take a minute and a half to do one of those cog or whatever i be take a minute and a half okay don't do it under a minute and a half otherwise you've spoil the whole lot for us
S0012	righto then and you have to do it by hand you see
S0008	mm
S0012	and it be so bore take your time like that you know
S0008	yeah
S0012	and get your copper out and get the motor motor
S0012	out and measure that and then and then take a bite off with a little bite of emery paper and measure up again you know and you've get to get to a tenth of a thou which be quite easy to do
S0008	mm
S0012	you know it be and the time and motion bloke would be there like that you and you'd get the nod from the foreman down there right and then you'd finish off the minute forty five you take there's somebody have take a minute and a half to most people say oh i'm sorry you know they say okay he say you so the time's time be still a minute and half but you could do them literally like that
S0008	mm
S0012	literally in about thirty second
S0008	yeah
S0012	that don't go on nowadays they can't do it nowadays cos it's all automate
S0008	well exactly and like when you think about what you be do there that's like outta the ark innit
S0012	that's outta the ark yeah yeah
S0008	and now you get these automate laser cut machine
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and they just like spit them out dum dum dum dum and they're all every one be more accurate than you could do if you spend a month on it
S0012	yeah well i i use to work on the cap these automatic cap at engineer and er knock these things out i mean once you set them up they knock them out and knock them out and knock them out and you're there at two o'clock in the morning think oh christ there's no you know all you have to do be go and check every now and then and see it that's right
S0008	yeah
S0012	and so well i've probably tell you the story before i get so feed up with it i just go round and switch all the machine off
S0012	and the bloke say what be you do i say i'm now go home you can't go home what about us i say well you can look after it yourself i'm off and i never go back to engineer again i i think this be not go to be my life
S0008	yeah no
S0012	for the rest of my life i'm not do this i can't i mean and now it must be even worse cos they're so mat and there's hardly anyone there now
S0008	all you gotta do now read a blueprint and fee the
S0012	yeah
S0008	the read into the into the machine
S0012	into the yeah
S0008	and that's all do on remote computers and
S0012	yeah
S0008	probably you don't even need to read you just copy the blueprint into the machine and that read itself
S0012	you needn't be an engineer anymore need you
S0008	well no well this be it you don't have to be an engineer
S0012	no
S0008	the only engineer now be in erm stuff like research and development i reckon
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	where you get so many you know individual stuff that you have to make yourself
S0012	yeah you have to make yeah that's true yeah
S0008	or in stuff like
S0012	tool make
S0008	tool make robot make
S0012	yeah yeah yeah
S0008	all this sort of stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	where it's all you know individual stuff
S0012	yeah i mean someone get to make tool that the robots use to do the job and
S0008	yeah that's right
S0012	and somebody get to make the robots and stuff like that
S0008	but there again you've get these you can make
S0012	robots make robots
S0008	in another another few years when you get 3d metal print
S0012	god yeah
S0008	you know we're go there it ain't gonna be long
S0012	it ain't gonna be long be it
S0008	and you won't need anyone to do anything with you
S0012	it's a
S0008	all you need be a designer just to make the picture
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	a 3d picture
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and that'll be it
S0012	i mean they they can make plastic gun now can't they
S0008	yeah
S0012	with plastic bullets too
S0008	well no they fire real bullets i think
S0012	well they can fire real bullets but they make because they they be talk about this on on on one of the program i be watch make these plastic bullets be as easy as make a a real bullet
S0008	mm
S0012	but the only thing they can see in the x ray be the date inside
S0008	oh right so even the case be plastic
S0012	yeah everything be plastic
S0008	yeah well they reckon that they can print ready to use mobile phone
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	or they will be
S0012	it will yeah
S0008	or probably they already can well that's something innit you know where you can you know like print circuit will be actually print circuit
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah dear i mean what's what's go to happen in another twenty years i mean
S0008	god i dunno it'll either be really fantastic or horrendous
S0012	well in the in the sixties when i be out to work they use to say that very soon there'll be so much spare time there'll be nobody at work
S0008	mm
S0012	well that didn't work out in the sixties
S0008	no now you've get more people work in britain than there ever have be
S0012	yeah ever before yeah
S0008	yeah maybe cos all the women be work whereas before at least fifty percent of them use to be quite happy to
S0012	stay at home yeah
S0008	stay at home and raise a family
S0012	yeah
S0008	then the blokes could earn enough to keep them
S0012	to keep them go yeah
S0008	keep them go well it's that's the main difference i'm sure a lot of people wouldn't mind one or the other of them stay at home
S0012	well that's right
S0008	but you can't afford to now
S0012	no you you can't cos erm i tell you when my mum and dad buy their house in nineteen thirty nine just before the war it be three hundred and eighteen pound
S0008	mm mm
S0012	right now he be on something like nine pound a week at the time
S0008	yeah
S0012	i don't know what what's that that's suppose to be a third third of your wag innit your mortgage
S0008	i don't know but anyway yeah but the thing be in well no before the war it be quite tricky to get a a loan wasn't it
S0012	it be tricky to get a loan yeah
S0008	but the proportion like ten pound a week versus three hundred quid be a lot smaller than it be now though isn't it
S0012	that be yeah yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	you know but it's funny that you know the the the bank be very they won't lend to
S0012	well every everyone down our little road all own their own house
S0008	well that be quite unusual though
S0012	that be quite unusual yeah yeah everybody
S0008	yeah
S0012	which be really weird when you think about that i don't know how i know that provident man use to come around every every week so
S0008	well be they new house or
S0012	brand new build by and
S0008	yeah well that'd be the difference you see
S0012	yeah
S0008	that'll be the difference cos they be build to sell
S0012	yeah
S0008	as oppose i mean people didn't well i don't know there's there's load and load of house buy all them terrace house that be build in the nineteen hundreds i be gonna say they be rent out weren't they
S0012	yeah i expect they be
S0008	that's cos they be own by the rich people who rent them
S0012	yeah well my gran use to live up
S0008	that's where i have a house up
S0012	do you hers hers her house be
S0008	yeah really
S0012	yeah and er i don't know whether they own it or rent it but they move from there and buy a house in er er up if that's still alive that be a little bungalow up in or in that's right off there's and there and there's a off of there's a little home depot across it and then it come down into which be at the bottom of which lead to old don't it lead to yeah
S0008	yeah yeah yeah
S0012	and they they buy this house there and my aunt she move from london er to live up the top of in this little tiny cottage which only have one bedroom no loos no bathroom no water and the loo at the bottom of the garden and she use to have er a water pipe outside
S0008	mm mm
S0012	where they use to go and get the water and
S0008	whereabouts be it
S0012	this be up in
S0008	right
S0012	right up the top of i think that'll go all the way through now now it's all i reckon that little house have be bulldoze pull down and something else have be put
S0008	oh i'm sure it have yeah
S0012	but er i use to go when i be an apprentice i use to bike from from er where where i use to work at the bottom along all the way up to and go and have my dinner at my aunt's
S0012	and funnily enough cos she use to smoke like a trooper
S0008	mm

S0008	no but this be what they're bank on innit really i mean some people might do it
S0013	would they
S0012	well some people might if they're healthy and strong and
S0008	well you look if you get if you get a hundred thousand pound
S0012	yeah
S0008	you can get five thousand a year right
S0012	yeah
S0008	so five thousand a year be a hundred pound a week
S0012	yeah
S0008	from a hundred thousand pound so
S0012	it'd still take twenty
S0008	a hundred no wait hundred thousand pound be a hundred pound a week so a thousand pound be a pound a week no it's more isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	so seven hundred pound for a pound a week seem like a bargain if you get the spare cash
S0012	if you get the cash yeah
S0013	how come
S0012	but then you're then you've get
S0008	well if if you have an annuity right you understand what i mean if you have a hundred thousand pound cash save up
S0013	right
S0008	you can buy an annuity which pay you five thousand a year for the rest of your life however long you live
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	okay
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	so that five thousand a year a year be a hundred pound a week innit
S0012	yeah
S0008	so a hundred thousand pound be pay buy you a hundred pound a week
S0012	yeah
S0008	so it's a thousand pound be buy you a pound a week
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	that be the standard rate which be go so if you're offer a thing seven hundred quid for a pound a week that's a bargain
S0012	but that depend
S0008	but you see what happen be be that you're pay them seven hundred quid
S0013	yeah
S0008	and the government be put in the extra three hundred quid innit
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and you're get a pound a week but that's taxable
S0012	yeah
S0013	i'm get an extra fifty two pound a year
S0008	yeah
S0013	for put in
S0008	seven hundred quid
S0013	yeah
S0012	so now she's get
S0013	you can't
S0012	fourteen years before she get the money back
S0008	well that's right yeah but i mean you look if you're sixty
S0012	yeah you get
S0008	well it's you know fourteen years be only seventy four i mean you're you know if you live to be if you're sixty you're expect to live to be well over eighty now aren't you
S0012	you're right yeah yeah
S0008	eighty five so it be a bite of a bargain
S0012	yeah i suppose it be if you look at it like that yeah
S0008	you know it's it's a you know i mean this be for people who've get the cash right
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	i mean you know you get a lot of people who you know they retire and that and what with one thing and other they add up all the cash they get and they get like twenty grand lay about or thirty grand or forty grand or whatever you know you think well i'll i'll invest that to live off right
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you invest seven hundred quid there's no way you're gonna get fifty two quid a year interest out of that
S0012	that's true
S0008	be there
S0012	no
S0008	cos you're talk about the interest rat of about eight percent
S0013	i see just sound ridiculous to me
S0008	but eight percent i mean nowadays the interest rat you get you know if you put in a build society you're get one percent if you're lucky
S0012	yeah if you're lucky yeah it's point something percent now innit
S0008	so one percent of seven hundred quid be seven quid a year so you could be get instead of seven quid a year you could be get fifty two quid a year
S0013	right
S0012	yeah
S0008	but the thing about this increase you know what you can buy with this increase you know pay to increase your pension thing
S0012	yeah
S0008	you can only do it up to a maximum of an extra twenty quid a week be it or fourteen quid there's some limit on it you can't
S0012	there be a limit on it yeah
S0008	yeah cos if cos obviously for a lot of people with a a private pension pot
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know they suddenly say oh bloom heck you know if i can get you know fifty fifty two quid a year for every seven hundred quid
S0012	yeah that's right that's that's that's
S0008	well go for it instead of get five thousand a year
S0012	that's right look at the
S0008	you're then get
S0012	yeah
S0008	something like seven or eight thousand
S0012	yeah
S0008	but twenty year ten year well ten year fifteen years ago if you have a hundred thousand you'd be able to get twenty thousand a year
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know and now it's down to five thousand
S0012	yeah that's true when we be save up to buy the field or the house one of the two it be fifteen percent interest
S0008	mm
S0012	weren't it
S0013	mm
S0012	we be get fifteen percent
S0008	that's right i know i know at that time she'd erm be hit and have her hip have her pelvis smash when someone run into her bike
S0012	oh right
S0008	when she be at the traffic light and she get a whack great pay out twenty thousand or something like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and she put it all in the bank she be get seventeen percent interest on it
S0012	yeah
S0008	and that be a hell of a lot of money
S0012	that be a lot of money yeah
S0008	interest
S0012	how do that get up that high
S0013	i mean normally
S0012	what
S0013	normally that's
S0008	who be you point at
S0013	huh
S0008	you're sit there go
S0012	she just point
S0013	what i'm just think
S0012	she just point
S0008	look at that
S0013	normally if you put you're talk about put money into something
S0008	yeah
S0013	put seven hundred into something i've still get my seven hundred won't i
S0008	yeah this be the drawback
S0013	i'm not give it completely away to get my percent
S0008	well that's right this be this be what you've get to weigh it up
S0013	well that just seem to be you're throw it away for er
S0008	well you're not throw it away cos you've get a guarantee income
S0012	for a pound a week
S0008	you get a guarantee income cast iron guarantee
S0013	yeah if if i live er for how long
S0008	fourteen years
S0012	fourteen years
S0013	you get you gotta add that seven hundred plus again haven't you
S0008	live to be seventy four seventy five
S0012	yeah
S0013	i can't see it
S0012	then you've get to live as long as me that's the point
S0008	not if she make you that onion pie
S0008	mushroom pie that be what i mean to say
S0013	seem to me you're just throw it away
S0008	i'll just go and get us some mushroom
S0012	yeah
S0008	well it's not throw it away it it's like you know i mean it's it's a thing about whether you can foresee that you might spend it as a lump sum might need to spend it as a lump sum right
S0012	yeah
S0008	or it's money you think i'll just have that as an investment long term investment
S0012	that's true
S0008	you see this be the thing it's like well
S0012	well if she's
S0008	normally normally you wouldn't if it be the only money you'd get you wouldn't do it cos you'd think this be rainy day money
S0012	yeah
S0008	i never know now when i might suddenly need you know that money to do something or to do you know but it's the sort of thing that you know if you've already get a rainy day fund and this be more money which be just sit in the bank
S0012	yeah but what if what if snuff it before me
S0008	you know not do anything yeah
S0012	would i get that pension money
S0008	no
S0012	no that'd be lose
S0008	yeah
S0012	that'd be lose i wouldn't get anything
S0013	you wouldn't get anything yeah
S0012	that's hardly fair
S0008	but if you die before then would get a bigger pension anyway
S0013	surely it'd be better for me to invest it into something isn't it
S0012	she would wouldn't she
S0008	as a widow's pension
S0013	if i invest it into something okay i wouldn't get the same interest but it's still my money
S0008	yeah but i mean like you could say you could say with this seven hundred quid right sort of like you could say oh i'll invest it in i don't know gold sovereigns right
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they're likely to increase in value but on the other hand when you come to need the money
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know this sort of thing whenever you buy anything it's always expensive but when you sell it it's always bloody cheap innit
S0012	yes yes
S0008	you know and
S0012	plus you have to pay a fee don't you
S0013	mm mm
S0008	well it's like all this stuff whatever you whatever you invest it in i mean it's like anything you know i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean i get you know a couple of thousand quid just sit at home
S0012	yeah
S0008	in a tin you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you think cor i should really put that in the bank you know i could get one percent interest and every year i'd be ten pound better off
S0012	yeah but you would also be lose you'd be worse off as well because of the inflation rate
S0008	and then you think no
S0012	i mean the inflation rate be more than the interest rate
S0008	well that's right but that's chew away at the value of the money i get at home anyway
S0012	you get anyway yeah
S0008	and you sort of think well can i be that arsed about it you know
S0012	well that's right
S0008	and it's the same i get stuff at home which you know i get a bloom you know two motorbike
S0012	yeah
S0008	and a triumph spitfire car sit in the garage
S0012	you have haven't you
S0008	slowly decay into the grind
S0012	yeah
S0008	mm and i think well you know i should sell them and get some money and then i think well what be i go to go with it anyway if i've get the if you don't need the you know it's a funny thing with money if you don't need it it's pointless fret over it
S0012	you see
S0013	yeah
S0012	the whole point be between the difference between me and and you be we be not greedy
S0008	well exactly that's it
S0012	we just can't we can't be like these greedy entrepreneurs that that would that would kill their grandmother for for the
S0008	but also yeah yeah yeah they'd do anything to make quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean the thing be be that you know you you know in the back of your sort of financial system you've always get this house
S0012	yeah
S0008	set down haven't you
S0012	yeah we have
S0008	if the worst come to the worst you could trade down
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean it would be a lot of work and effort
S0012	it would be
S0008	but eventually you know that's like
S0012	yeah
S0008	just cash sit there better than in the bank innit
S0012	well it's yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	we have think about it haven't we we have think about flog the house
S0008	mm
S0012	but then we think all that work
S0008	well exactly it's the same with my house you see i mean you know i just can't face sort it out
S0012	all the work and sort everything out
S0008	and also
S0012	that's up to the kid when we're go
S0008	yeah
S0012	innit
S0013	ah
S0012	we have to sort our parents' house out didn't we
S0013	yeah
S0008	but then you sort of look at 's mum who you know have to sell her or sell her house have to sell the house all the money's bloody go now
S0012	it's all go yeah she's in the
S0008	you know she sort of get you know probably about forty grand leave
S0012	yeah
S0008	out of a house which be worth you know a hundred and eighty
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and er
S0012	where that's go what happen there yeah
S0008	yeah but the thing the other thing be be that when you get to a certain age which you be now you can get equity release on your house
S0012	you can yeah
S0008	you see
S0012	we have think about that as well
S0008	so if you're ever if you're ever get short of money
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know i mean the thing be they use to say that be a bite dodgy cos there's a lot of dodgy firm and that but
S0012	it be yeah
S0008	but it's now sort out now that it's actually a bona fide establishment
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	sort of run it
S0013	mm
S0008	and you could probably borrow get a hundred thousand cash out of this house
S0012	yeah
S0008	no sweat and you never have to pay it back
S0012	no
S0008	because they they just take it when you die
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and it's not when one of you die when both of you die
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know and it just like build up over the years obviously but then you sort of think well the value of the house build up as well
S0012	yes it do don't it yeah
S0008	slowly but surely
S0013	mm
S0012	but then a hundred thousand quid what would we do with a hundred thousand quid
S0013	yeah but you see we're we're so bad at spend anyway
S0012	yeah
S0013	you know we really struggle to erm go out for a meal or anything like
S0008	yeah yeah but i mean
S0013	and that's normal for other people
S0008	yeah but it's not something to sort of like consider as a negative thing
S0012	no
S0008	it's a thing
S0013	no
S0008	yeah so you i mean alright you know i mean i just get i'm live on pension credit i can save up money
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know quite a lot of money that you know that
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos i just don't spend it i don't need it you know
S0012	well i doubt whether we spend all our pension do we
S0013	mm no well actually it's go down
S0012	yeah because you haven't be spend
S0008	yeah i know
S0013	a bite more than normal
S0008	you know i get mine pay in every week
S0013	we've cash in our isas and
S0008	yeah
S0013	and premium bond and that i mean we're cash them in

S0012	yeah
S0008	you know and that include you know i've give money and lend money and all this sort of stuff

S0012	we get a load of load of stuff to put up there
S0008	mm
S0012	we be go to put it up there weren't we
S0013	yeah well i think we're still that be the plan isn't it

S0008	yeah
S0013	we buy the wrong sort
S0012	yeah we do
S0008	why be that what be wrong with it
S0013	oh we we buy some big stuff to lay it on top of really

S0008	yeah but it be you can buy
S0012	you can yeah
S0008	a four inch in
S0012	yeah
S0008	small roll and build a frame with joists
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah we're gonna have to that's that's one thing we're
S0012	we're gonna have to do something about that
S0013	yeah
S0012	look at that budgie he keep one the ceiling
S0013	cos the plan the plan be you see clear that out about two years ago now maybe even maybe over three years ago
S0013	think ahead and er
S0008	it be probably five years ago
S0013	and we get the stuff i know that get the stuff two years ago didn't we at least
S0012	we buy the stuff in b and q
S0013	and er

S0008	er put that in there
S0013	get rid of the box that we don't need put the others in there
S0012	yeah

S0008	yeah so you'll have to you have to erm line out the joists as well
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	the big plan
S0012	get to line out the joists first

S0012	yeah
S0008	you know with a board
S0013	mm

S0008	and then put another foot down
S0012	cor yeah and then then have the insulation in the wall do yeah that ain't gonna work
S0008	yeah yeah
S0012	big plan

S0008	no you wouldn't
S0012	if if they want they can come and investigate knock on your door
S0008	cos the other the thing be now that you can watch live television on your computer can't you
S0012	yeah i suppose you can yeah
S0008	if you stick a card in a tv card in
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and also on top of that the bbc be actually show live stuff stream online

S0008	and er on these letter and that they say whatever media you be watch television on computer tablet phone television set you be you have to buy a licence right and then you go right down the small print they say a little mention of live tv but they don't say
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	you know they don't say anything about
S0012	record tv
S0008	record program
S0012	no
S0008	you know be available because apparently load of students now cos they this be why i mean tv you know really get up my nose at one time if you have a household you have one licence per household you can have as many televisions set as you like couldn't you
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know but then they think oh multiple households with students you know what they're get away with just one licence
S0012	one licence so yeah
S0008	so what we'll do we'll make it for everyone who's get to have their own licence
S0013	mm
S0008	you know which be just unfair isn't it
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	especially if that you know they have a common room with a a television in you know
S0012	i i think because it's only a bbc tv licence innit
