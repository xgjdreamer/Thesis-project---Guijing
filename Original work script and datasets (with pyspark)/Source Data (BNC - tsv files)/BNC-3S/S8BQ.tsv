S0517	yeah
S0558	but er there be thousands of products out there that have be use for years
S0517	for years and years and years i must admit i'm not keen
S0558	do you know what i mean
S0517	on the way on the way she's do it at the moment
S0558	mm
S0517	with the whole don't use this don't use that it's bad and then it it's not back up with anything you know she's like it's all a bite wishy washy this well use neal's yard
S0558	yeah
S0517	because it it's do good things to you inside i'm think good things to you inside you can't

S0558	no
S0517	it
S0558	no
S0517	good things to you
S0517	inside i'm think
S0558	drink plenty of water it'll flush your insides through
S0517	yeah
S0558	and no i won't buy any of the products they're too expensive
S0517	well why why be you have the why be you have the party
S0558	just to give her experience

S0558	yeah and i'm invite
S0517	cos i think well i'll i mean i'll buy something there but er er
S0558	oh well i'm not have it because
S0517	there's not a lot
S0558	i want the products
S0517	that i want to buy

S0558	for her wasn't it and it be gonna be very sort of relax
S0517	mm
S0558	but i'm invite like friends that know
S0517	okay
S0558	so she might on the back of it get a party
S0517	yeah yeah oh well that's yeah that's
S0558	that's why i'm do it
S0517	but i just think
S0558	i'm not gonna use the i'm just do it to support her really
S0517	if i'm honest i don't really like the smell of the stuff either
S0558	no
S0517	there's be nothing that i've really think mm that's really nice
S0558	and when you be say about the smell it take me back and i'll always remember erm always say when she be little how i think i'd i think it be when i'd be in hospital
S0517	mm
S0558	and i'd come back and like i be give her a hug and that and she be say oh you smell lovely mummy and it be obviously the cream
S0517	the cream yes yeah
S0558	you know that erm
S0517	yeah but there's nothing there be nothing that i'd really
S0558	no
S0517	so yeah i'll buy i'll buy something on the first but i don't
S0558	you don't have to
S0517	i don't really know what
S0558	don't feel obligate
S0517	that's why i buy the catalogue home really so i can have a look and decide
S0558	it's all so expensive
S0517	well yeah
S0558	i mean my my olay be ten pound a pop i only ever buy it when it's at five pound
S0517	mm
S0558	and when it's at five pound i buy two
S0517	two yes yeah i know what you mean
S0558	which keep me go then till next time it's
S0517	mm
S0558	somebody's always get it on offer whether it's
S0517	yeah i know
S0558	asda wilkinson's tesco's
S0517	i know i mean it's not it's not really the the price for me cos i do i mean the the decleor stuff be as expensive be as expensive
S0558	yeah
S0517	i do but again i wait till i find it on on offer on the internet
S0558	yeah
S0517	i always do i never buy it i never buy anything full price cos at
S0558	no
S0517	some point somebody's always get and even if what i'm use hasn't quite run out i think oh that's a good price i'll get the next one
S0558	yeah
S0517	but i like it and i like the smell and i just think
S0558	yeah
S0517	i don't really like the neal's yard stuff
S0558	no no
S0517	not so far
S0558	i say to i say don't be talk into buy anything because it's good for teenage skin
S0517	do she like it
S0558	and all the rest of it she didn't comment very much to be honest
S0517	no
S0558	i say just you know i say if you want to buy something it's entirely
S0517	mm
S0558	up to you
S0517	mm
S0558	but don't feel pressure to buy anything i say cos obviously this be 's live this be how she earn her money
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	and she's aim to get sales but don't feel obligate
S0517	mm
S0558	and she didn't
S0517	no oh well there we be then
S0558	yeah the thing be be it's once you start
S0517	well yes
S0558	you tend to particularly like you you've find a product you like you're happy with and all the rest of it
S0517	yeah
S0558	and you've stick with it same as me with olay
S0517	yeah it just make
S0558	i i've stick with it i could probably do with change i could probably do with i dunno i don't know
S0517	but anyway well like you say that's her live so she's get to try and sell it to people but sometimes i think you need a little bite more of the science back it back this up here because
S0558	yeah
S0517	you can't just say that's good and that's bad and not
S0558	no
S0517	say why
S0558	no
S0517	like you say all these big name brand clarins clinque estee lauder i mean they have be around donkey's years really well respect er
S0558	products
S0517	and you just can't help but think do you know what if they be bad for you
S0558	yeah
S0517	we'd have know by now
S0558	absolutely
S0517	they've be around for so long
S0558	absolutely

S0558	so at that point if the long range weather forecast be not look
S0517	mm
S0558	very good at all if you're go back to a brick build at night you can cope with
S0517	yes
S0558	less during the day
S0517	yeah you can you can
S0558	cos you know
S0517	yeah
S0558	it don't matter but when you're camp
S0517	no not
S0558	erm
S0517	if the weather's bad it's no fun then be it
S0558	so if if the weather's really really bad we won't bother and we'll just transfer the deposit to our summer holiday which we're go down to woolacombe

S0558	primarily to do bodyboarding and
S0517	yeah

S0517	cos do get her wetsuit for christmas and she hasn't use it yet i don't suppose
S0558	well and that yeah but she's go away with and her family for the weekend the last weekend of the holiday the easter holiday
S0517	oh okay
S0558	and they've get a house in wales
S0517	right
S0558	and they're go so she's gonna be take it with her cos they're go in the sea

S0517	in bloom april well
S0558	say i'll be alright with my wetsuit on
S0517	oh gosh
S0558	must be mad so erm so she'll get to to use it for the first time then bless her
S0517	ah that'll be nice
S0558	yeah yes that'll be nice
S0517	yeah oh
S0558	she'll have a nice time
S0517	cos yeah they finish their exams don't they and in
S0558	when do they finish then
S0517	before that before the whitsun week
S0558	mm yes so they'll be finish
S0517	do you speak to about 's work experience while you be chat to him
S0558	no i didn't because i'd text and ask the question
S0517	oh have you
S0558	so say leave it with me i'll speak to
S0517	mm
S0558	and she say it be highly unlikely because they'd stop it because they be be bombard with request so it be something they'd stop
S0517	oh
S0558	and 's also get his own son go in this year
S0517	oh have he
S0558	so she say it probably very doubtful but leave it with me so she text back and say oh i'm really sorry erm i can't do it this year cos of blah blah blah
S0517	mm
S0558	but maybe next year if he need to do it again which i don't think they do do they
S0517	i've no idea
S0558	i don't think they they need to do a work experience for it
S0517	right so have have any more thoughts we haven't do anything more about yet
S0558	he's apply to
S0517	oh have he
S0558	yeah cos i think it would be just a really good male environment to drop him in i haven't tell this
S0517	be it your suggestion then
S0558	well i say to him why don't you try because i know the manager that be that be there
S0517	oh okay
S0558	he use to be a neighbour of ours in but he retire last year
S0517	oh
S0558	so i phone up and ask the question and they say it be something we have do
S0517	mm
S0558	so he give me the contact detail of who we need to speak to erm and he's have an email back say it's be send his request have be send on to the director and they'll get back to him with a decision
S0517	oh right
S0558	so maybe but i think it's it's gonna be like shuffle bits of wood around and different things and a bite of sweep but it's a heavily male environment
S0517	it be yeah yeah
S0558	so he'll have the banter and just
S0517	mm
S0558	drop him in it and let him cope
S0517	oh that's a good idea
S0558	yeah he that's what need isn't it
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	it's what need
S0517	good idea
S0558	so so i'm hop that'll come off if not he's think the
S0517	oh
S0558	which would be a lot more of a probably more suitable to
S0517	mm be much quieter wouldn't it and much more
S0558	yeah probably be more suitable to 's but i think would be good
S0517	be good for him yes
S0558	mm
S0517	yeah oh you're quite harsh you you're a little bite devious aren't you
S0558	i yeah
S0517	cos won't be use to all that type of you know
S0558	i know
S0517	all that male banter he won't be use to that will he that's why you're do it
S0558	yeah
S0517	you
S0517	look at you look at that look on your face oh
S0558	yeah
S0517	how funny
S0558	expose him to
S0517	well it's a good idea actually
S0558	erm out of his comfort zone
S0517	he will be poor lad
S0558	he's gotta deal with it
S0517	oh you be funny we haven't really get any further with we're still think one of the holiday park but the one
S0558	yeah
S0517	would like to send him to because of the manager in place be the one at the in which be not a holiday park it's only a residential
S0558	residential isn't it
S0517	and even when when go up there he have to he stay in a b and b there's nowhere er i think there be staff caravan but there's no nowhere to stay as such
S0558	oh be that the manager who be there when we
S0517	yeah
S0558	be there and he come and meet us
S0517	yes yes yes
S0558	yeah
S0517	who who be
S0558	see i wouldn't again still if that be an option i think that would be good for him you know when i say
S0517	yes yes
S0558	if do it i'd be quite happy
S0517	happy to send him up there but we
S0558	with and
S0517	well i think 's speak to but i think pretty much in effect would end up put up for the week
S0558	mm
S0517	which would be okay with
S0558	yeah
S0517	i mean he's get a a spare room cos obviously he's he's get a family and they come and
S0558	yeah
S0517	visit so but it's we haven't really get any further with it but then we be talk because they have they have a tennis coach there who have now go there be some sort of question over him some sort of i dunno something on his record that i dunno i don't know whether he go or be sack but they haven't get one and they be gonna get somebody in to do tennis sessions for the kid in holiday
S0558	oh
S0517	so have get enough qualifications to do those sessions himself now although he would only be almost seventeen he's get his coach he's get his first aid
S0558	do he pass his one the other day
S0517	er he we haven't he hasn't hear yet
S0558	you haven't hear yet right
S0517	or at least he hasn't tell us if he's
S0517	i haven't hear i i do ask him a couple of days ago and he say he hadn't hear yet but even if he hadn't that be to run tournaments though
S0558	mm
S0517	that's slightly different but yeah he's get enough he's get he's er he'll get his dbs and then he's get his first aid and he's get his next level of coach which enable him to have group of children so be like you know we could almost ask if he could do either mornings or afternoons in the different departments and the other part of the day offer tennis lessons
S0558	absolutely
S0517	to the people cos i mean they're all
S0558	yeah
S0517	they're they're really wealthy people that the ones with their home there so that you know and the
S0558	and but
S0517	week that it be at the end of july so our last week of term but obviously everybody that own holiday home there all their kid be at private school so they'd all be finish
S0558	so they'll be there
S0517	they'd be there
S0558	that's what i be gonna say if there's no children there it's pointless but
S0517	no they'd be there
S0558	yeah
S0517	so and the other and the so have mention it to and he seem open to the idea and erm but we haven't really get any further with it yet say that ought to ring himself and talk to him about it but we haven't he hasn't do that yet
S0558	yeah i erm
S0517	but that might be but it's just that one isn't it you know it's like it would be live i suppose in effect with say cos i'm not even sure there's a spare staff caravan and
S0558	mm
S0517	would he wanna be on his own and would like take him
S0558	that's right
S0517	up to the restaurant and
S0558	yeah where i say to like you like if go
S0517	if they be together yes
S0558	they'd go off
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	and do their own learn through the but at least
S0517	at least
S0558	they've get company there
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	erm
S0517	but i don't know we haven't get any further but i'll let you know if we do we'll see
S0558	mm
S0517	but he be i mean be quite keen on the tennis side of things
S0558	mm
S0517	obviously
S0558	cos that i mean that would be a fantastic experience because one you're in a work environment and two you're also away from home
S0517	yes
S0558	they've gotta do your own cook and
S0517	yeah
S0558	get you know get themselves up and out to work every day
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	it's like a a mini university week wouldn't it really
S0517	it would really
S0558	in in in a
S0517	yeah except except you're work anyway so we'll see nothing's really come of it
S0558	mm
S0517	yet but erm
S0558	well i'm think
S0517	he hasn't
S0558	when 's go off to university i think i might apply apply for a job on one of 's caravan park
S0517	be you
S0558	yeah i'd love that
S0517	you'd be good at that
S0558	yeah very definitely
S0517	what will you do with just leave him at home
S0558	oh no he could come as well
S0517	oh i
S0558	yeah both of us
S0517	oh he'll be retire by then won't he
S0558	yeah yeah well retire from the police
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	and when they're both at university i'm think i i really would like to work in an environment like that cos you know
S0517	it be a cos they're not caravan be they
S0558	no you know erm you know you have people who work for caravan and camp club
S0517	mm
S0558	couple who manage the site something we've always say that i'd love to do this
S0517	you'd be really good at it you two run like clockwork
S0558	i know
S0517	it would
S0558	so i'm i i think i haven't speak to about this yet but maybe that could be a possible option
S0517	how many years be we talk which let me just er be you warm
S0558	he'll have
S0517	i'll get
S0558	probably leave by then
S0517	who
S0558	yes
S0517	yeah probably er but how many years till
S0558	well 's year ten isn't she
S0517	so we've get

S0517	and we're halfway through this one gosh
S0558	and then she'll go off to uni
S0517	blimey

S0517	you could
S0558	as long as i've get somewhere to put my head down at night i'd do anything on the park now
S0517	you'd be very good at at er the housekeep i've proofread their manual for the housekeep department
S0558	oh yes
S0517	standard operate procedures oh and it do make me laugh it be so specific and about how they have to you know how they have to vacuum and which part of the room to where and how they have to fold the corner of the bed and how they have to go along the top of you know it be just like literally everything and erm and i think of you actually i though oh would just have this

S0517	cos one of the geography teachers erm not mrs you know the other lady that be at the parents' even with her
S0558	i don't know the name
S0517	but you know the the one i mean
S0558	yeah
S0517	with the he say she she's she say she's always off but they don't they don't seem to replace her they just miss those lessons
S0558	mm
S0517	i mean i know the after school ones he keep get promise these after school booster sessions or revision sessions or whatever they're call them and if they get cancel well you you that's a bite of a grey area isn't it because
S0558	mm
S0517	they weren't oblige to put them on in the first place
S0558	no
S0517	but you know the lessons in the week they're oblige to put on
S0558	oh god yeah
S0517	mind you i remember when i be do my a level many years ago it be when all there be there be load of teacher strike in the you know in the eighties and i remember my mum and dad sit at home moan and complain and
S0558	yeah
S0517	my children's you know all these strike like we would be at home for a day
S0558	yeah
S0517	every other week we'd have a day off oh strike strike strike and we be me and she be upper sixth i be lower sixth and i do remember them sit at but you know we get through but but we be the sort of children that well i be that want
S0558	get
S0517	would sit at home
S0558	you've get
S0517	and work
S0558	yeah
S0517	you know
S0558	yeah
S0517	on a strike day i'd be oh you and i'd do do my homework and stuff but but lot of kid like mine don't
S0558	the thing be be have work in the primary our primary school i tell you know er you do have to look after yourself and you do have to
S0517	oh yeah i know
S0558	want to learn because
S0517	yeah
S0558	it's a joke quite frankly i think
S0517	mm
S0558	an absolute joke
S0517	it's it's and then we wonder how so many kid come out of school without basic english and maths
S0558	i know
S0517	well it's not hard to gather because so easily for them to just slip through
S0558	yeah
S0517	the the it's just shoddy the erm
S0558	i mean the
S0517	the communication and the
S0558	yeah i know and in the classroom environment
S0517	the staff turnover
S0558	and it's the kid who be be disruptive be the ones that be get the attention because they're be tell
S0517	mm
S0558	off and you know and all the kid who be compliant be just be forget and you know
S0517	mm and at 's parents' even
S0558	right from primary level
S0517	last when be 's last week last thursday the amount of teachers nearly say something to one of them he i say you can't speak he say i nearly say what be they put in the water they be either about to go off on maternity leave or have just come back from maternity leave probably four of them so there's and the science teacher be new and wouldn't even give out appointments because he hadn't he didn't know them but only have them for a week or two and just say no er so i didn't even see science and that be one of the ones i want to see erm i forget i forget which subject now one of them the english lady she be due three weeks so she be about to finish erm but she'd have him up till now and then there be another one say well you know i can't say very much cos i've only be here two weeks because i'm just back from maternity leave i think that be geography and the history lady as well be also just back from maternity leave so didn't know him that well which i know i know i know and we be female and i know you have to but it be just it be virtually half of the people we saw hadn't really have him for long
S0558	no and then these
S0517	but there at you know year nine's always one of those years they don't focus on
S0558	no
S0517	because they haven't start their gcses yet have they
S0558	no
S0517	you know they're choose their options they the
S0558	yeah it's
S0517	it be always one of those
S0558	it go a bite by the by doesn't it
S0517	it do really
S0558	year nine
S0517	bite like year four
S0558	mm
S0517	at primary you know they've do their end of year er year two sats or year three rather you know they're still far enough away from year six years
S0558	yeah
S0517	years three and four a little bite
S0558	mm
S0517	they're not focus on and i think year nine be definitely a a not focus on year
S0558	yeah
S0517	but it it be just you know there be a like but like i say he the i didn't even get an appointment with science cos he wasn't give them out
S0558	i mean in many respect you can kind of admire him because he's not gonna fee you rubbish and try and pretend he know the children so in in many respect you've get to admire him for that
S0517	yeah
S0558	but then maybe a couple of months in he should send a little report home of what when he have have the opportunity of get to know them just send a little report over
S0517	yeah
S0558	of how they're do
S0517	oh he he won't get that though will he
S0558	no
S0517	yeah mm i know
S0558	and then these supply teachers come in and i'm not i'm not be rude cos they're not all the same but they're very often do supply work because they just want the convenience of go in
S0517	mm
S0558	when they want and not when they want and they wanna be able to go in and do what's be set
S0517	yeah
S0558	and come away
S0517	and then come away
S0558	they don't wanna set it up
S0517	and they don't
S0558	and when
S0517	wanna mark it
S0558	no
S0517	and they don't really no i know i mean
S0558	so you know
S0517	i know it's very difficult
S0558	it's a shame and it's just unfortunate that the boys and be the first guinea pig of the new system aren't they
S0517	yes yeah yeah they will be i'd be interest to see what the school say to you if you ring
S0558	yes oh i will ring i just wait for
S0517	mm
S0558	i say to her last night i want you to do me some note so i've get actual
S0517	yeah
S0558	evidence of
S0517	mm
S0558	examples i've get the loomband one you know
S0517	so tell me about when do she come back
S0558	erm i i think she's actually be back a few weeks
S0517	cos she be at the wasn't she the the what be it call be it call
S0558	no there be talk that she be go to go to
S0517	where do she go
S0558	she go to 's
S0517	oh that be right that be right
S0558	and then she come back from there
S0517	right cos there be a set there be a set phrase wasn't there
S0558	yeah it be she be be
S0517	she wasn't expel
S0558	no she be gonna be send to 's and she could either er behave and continue there or if she be naughty she would come back to the and be give a second chance so she's return to and she's be give
S0517	what because she be naughty at 's
S0558	yeah
S0517	oh god
S0558	and then say erm only a few days ago that she think she's gonna be send to
S0517	oh so it's not work out so why do she why well why would you say if you're naughty you can come back what sort of
S0558	i know
S0517	bizarre logic be that
S0558	to to be give i know it
S0517	it should be if you're naughty you go to the as the next stop
S0558	straight to the
S0517	instead
S0558	it's like this be what say how many chance have that girl be give you know and it's just constant disruption all the time
S0517	or
S0558	with her attitude
S0517	do she have many lessons with her
S0558	er she's in her form
S0517	oh right yeah but they don't they're not learn in the form be they
S0558	no no

S0517	i do i tell you referee his first two football match on sunday
S0558	no no have he do it
S0517	he do them on sunday
S0517	and it go alright go alright so he get twelve pound a match
S0558	wow that's good
S0517	i know
S0558	that be really good
S0517	twelve pound a match so he have
S0558	and it's only what an hour
S0517	er er yeah it be an hour each one be an hour so the first match be nine thirty so i think and he leave at nine o'clock and they weren't back till quarter past twelve so he have a nine thirty one and then a ten forty five and obviously there's five ten minutes at half time and then they drive home so yeah so he be out for three three and a bite hours and as be who earn nothing
S0558	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0517	and i say you're gonna have to take a cut anyway
S0558	yeah petrol money
S0517	so no er he's get another two this sunday morning he they'd have give him three he could have do the twelve o'clock match as well erm but he have to be away to
S0558	that's fabulous
S0517	to play his own match cos he have to you know he have to be at his match at one fifteen so he couldn't fit in three
S0558	no
S0517	otherwise they'd have give him three
S0558	i know it's a nice little earner that
S0517	that's a really good little earner so but it be under twelves which be only really the season below him
S0558	mm
S0517	or two season below him sorry erm but that that's the oldest he could do but er that be all they have available er so they say it cos the guy after they'd do the course say if you can get the younger group to start with because it'll be easier but erm
S0517	he couldn't
S0558	excuse me
S0517	that be all they have available so so he take it but you get more money for the longer match which be you know twelve pound so i say to i say so next week
S0558	yes
S0517	would you leave him on his own
S0558	yeah
S0517	he say no i say no he say no say right he say because he say the although 's match both his match be very uneventful and there be no hassle he say it be all kick off on the pitch next to him parent yell
S0558	mm
S0517	you know bite of unpleasantness couple of them you know say things
S0558	yeah i can imagine yeah
S0517	to the referee and he say
S0558	yeah
S0517	you just don't know what you're gonna get he say i'm not sure i'll let i'll i'll leave him at all he say because they've get no one to turn to have they there's no
S0558	no
S0517	cos say because this he have to do five as part of the course so he's do his course he's do his test he have to referee five match and then he have to go and take an exam so in effect these first five be like part of a train even though he's get pay for them and say well er be there somebody there supervise it or er you know erm what's the word mark him
S0558	yeah
S0517	and say well no he be just no he just be there
S0558	he as the referee yeah
S0517	he be in charge so there be nobody there i mean he's only fourteen to to turn to
S0558	well the thing be i
S0517	and that's why say he wouldn't leave him at all
S0558	yeah but there's enough people there that there's enough witness that nobody would actually get physical with him
S0517	oh yeah no no but it's just
S0558	but it's not a nice experience
S0517	put him
S0558	for him be it
S0517	no it's just put him at the
S0558	mm
S0517	in the early days put him in a situation that could become quite
S0558	mm
S0517	and and how would he deal with it i say to i'm more concern about how you'd deal with it if
S0558	well yeah
S0517	people start shout at
S0558	yeah
S0517	at the referee and he be your son but erm but no so i say i say how do you feel about that i say cos that's like that be that be your sunday morning you know
S0558	mm
S0517	he be they be up and out at nine back at quarter past twelve and then we leave again at one for 's football match which always like to watch
S0558	yeah

S0558	but it's not all year be it
S0517	no it's not all year it's not
S0558	so you will get

S0558	it's not necessarily gonna be
S0517	no
S0558	every week be it
S0517	no it's not no you're right but it's again this sunday it'll be the same this sunday
S0558	what it what perhaps you might have to do be maybe once every six weeks or something just cross the calendar through
S0517	yeah and not yeah
S0558	so at least you get a family day
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	the pressure's off of him
S0517	well we never get a family day because he play football
S0558	mm
S0517	but at least it's not all day i mean i say i'd go and stand there
S0558	mm
S0517	he say what be you gonna do i say nothing
S0517	there's nothing and i don't even really know the rule and you know they could be justify in what they're say i don't know
S0558	yeah you'd be go like
S0517	i'd be go do you make a bad decision
S0558	yeah do you
S0517	do you

S0517	take his
S0558	that's really good
S0517	it be yeah
S0558	really good because that's that's a skill he can use when he's work full time
S0517	oh absolutely
S0558	if he need a bite of extra cash
S0517	it's the sort of thing should do
S0558	families come along yeah
S0517	he'd be good at it he'd be really good at it in fact my come away and say that he say should have do that
S0558	yeah
S0517	my say wish i'd do the course i could have be referee on the pitch
S0558	well yeah
S0517	next to him and we could have both earnt some money
S0558	absolutely
S0517	and i wouldn't have just be stand there for three hours
S0558	yeah he'll have to erm
S0517	i say yeah you could actually and then you could
S0558	he could be earn as well
S0517	he say it would be just my luck he say erm i'd do the course and then we get put in two totally separate
S0558	oh locations yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	i wouldn't be able to do mine
S0558	ah
S0517	i say yes i'm not sure the referee outfit would suit you as well either
S0558	no
S0517	he say no you're right
S0558	oh
S0517	but er no that be quite funny
S0558	oh that's fantastic so we've get with his
S0558	football and
S0517	with his tennis
S0558	the man with his tennis
S0517	i know
S0558	anybody would think you be an incredibly sporty person
S0517	i tell you didn't i what i overhead say to a few months back might even be a year back now they didn't know i be there listen and they be talk about all the various things they be do and go to can you imagine like if mum even have the tiniest bite of a sport gene she'd pass on could you imagine how good we'd be then
S0558	could have be swimmers
S0517	oh and he say to me all the time do he say you didn't pass on any good genes to me he say the only good gene you've get which be you know you can spell you've keep it to yourself

S0558	how's he get on with all that with his dyslexia and that be he
S0517	well he still get extra time but he doesn't take it
S0558	doesn't he
S0517	no nobody's really mention it
S0558	do he
S0517	they don't
S0558	do he struggle on a day to day basis
S0517	i think he's a lot better than he be
S0558	mm
S0517	he be a lot better than he be to be honest with you though i haven't read anything he's write for quite a long time
S0558	mm
S0517	because it's it's i think it's still quite poorly write
S0558	mm
S0517	but nobody ever like at parents' even it it's not important to them they don't ever mention it
S0558	i thing be be the way people communicate now and will in the future it's all
S0517	well i mean
S0558	type base
S0517	er yeah oh it be it's all type base
S0558	it's
S0517	this be only the only time they write isn't it at school
S0558	mm
S0517	and i mean he he can't spell either er all the time i hear him talk to his phone because you know if he's type
S0558	yeah

S0517	right
S0558	so like a an email come out yesterday say that erm in a couple of saturdays' time there's some erm sail opportunities and kayak opportunities for six pound for like an hour and a half
S0517	oh wow

S0558	so that's something organise by district so if the kid wanna go he hasn't get to be there with them
S0517	right
S0558	because there will be certain people
S0517	the other adults
S0558	from
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	yeah erm so there there's there's things that happen in addition to what he organise and all the rest of it erm so there's lot of opportunity for them
S0517	okay and have he get his helper i've forget i've forget who he want but
S0558	yeah he's get erm he do ask but couldn't really commit so 's dad probably don't know he's a policeman

S0517	oh okay
S0558	an assistant and helper as well
S0517	oh that's good oh i'm sure it'll be very successful
S0558	yeah yeah very
S0517	i mean it'll be nice for to be able to run it as he want to run it
