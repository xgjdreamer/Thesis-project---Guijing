S0391	do you
S0393	a massive reputation
S0392	yeah definitely
S0391	do you want it put on the music insurance
S0393	yeah that's why er
S0392	hang on with my musicians' union membership i might be able to get it cos you get insurance up to two thousand pound in mine

S0392	well then you'll have to sort yourselves out won't you
S0393	alright now that's why
S0392	you know
S0393	we'd need something else as well
S0392	oh right well we'll discuss that later we'll see who's right later yeah
S0391	i would just get the guitar insure though
S0393	yeah so it's five seven nine it's already down

S0392	then it's you move up to darlington
S0393	be there a rivalry between darlo folk and
S0391	no
S0392	they're so geographically near but
S0391	if they've
S0392	remove
S0391	no people from darlington go shop in middlesbrough they think it's just on their doorstep they wouldn't even see it as a a rival really
S0393	cos they all support borough don't they
S0391	well they they haven't really get anything else do you know what there's not many football fan in darlington believe it or not
S0392	really
S0391	darlington never ever draw a large crowd
S0393	no they
S0392	how many people do it draw
S0393	doesn't do
S0391	they reckon there's a solid core of two hundred
S0392	two hundred
S0393	two thousand
S0391	no a solid core that like give their weekend up to raise money to try and save
S0393	oh right
S0391	the they the rest can take it or leave it
S0393	really
S0391	that's why that's why they disappear
S0393	that's a bite like carlisle except the carlisle ones
S0391	no carlisle
S0393	there's more glory
S0391	have more
S0393	if they do well
S0391	carlisle have always have more
S0392	mm well actually
S0391	like darlington have never have
S0392	well if they do well
S0393	yeah like if i have live there i'd start go if they be do well
S0392	like middlesbrough have get a lot of them like they have about fourteen thousand do a solid people who go even when they're not do so well and then about
S0393	yeah
S0392	ten thousand
S0391	yeah ten more
S0392	further
S0391	yeah
S0393	soon see that drop off if they be in league division two
S0391	yeah they would drop off
S0393	they'd go down to three or four i reckon
S0391	no i think
S0392	yeah
S0391	they they've get they have always
S0393	or five
S0391	have more middlesbrough have always have more
S0393	they go down to five six thousand when in the eighties
S0391	do they
S0393	when football attendances be low man u be
S0392	yeah
S0393	get
S0391	really
S0393	thirty five thousand
S0392	hooliganism and everything yeah
S0393	yeah
S0391	yeah but what about nineteen what's on their badge nineteen eighty six or something

S0392	that's when steve gibson buy them yeah
S0391	oh be that when they be start to rise
S0392	when be football crowd at their biggest then seventies or what
S0393	now

S0393	yeah
S0391	people today be be they're wear er protest t shirt and hold placard against ticket price
S0393	yeah they will be yeah
S0392	yeah cos in
S0391	i think it's
S0392	spain and germany they're so cheap aren't they
S0391	i think it's this saturday they're do it
S0392	that's why spain and germany
S0391	it's every
S0392	get such big crowd cos the price be so
S0391	there's
S0392	small
S0391	more money in the grassroots stuff as well the the erm all of the premiership and of the championship be protest today
