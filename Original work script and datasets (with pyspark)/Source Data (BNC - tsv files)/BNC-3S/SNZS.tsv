S0653	mm
S0654	be the lose boys
S0653	be they now
S0655	yeah they're a little lose and i'm wonder though eventually i think be able to explore the whole of neverland they haven't
S0653	do you think it's a place that's real then
S0655	well if you're like in if you be there you would be able to explore every single part of it cos it have a limit amount of space and it would take us age and you would have enough time erm on your hand to explore it although you would never have enough time to explore earth
S0653	i'm sure the lose boys have explore it a lot
S0655	yeah like they have just probably explore it
S0654	they live in an oak
S0655	yeah they live in a
S0653	in a big oak tree
S0655	and they would have be there
S0654	yeah
S0655	they would have be there enough to erm know their ways around it quite a lot
S0653	yeah well they know about the mermaids don't they
S0655	yeah and the pirate
S0653	and tiger lily
S0655	and the indians

S0653	indeed properly nasty
S0655	mm smee's not very nasty
S0653	i like smee
S0655	he's really funny
S0654	yeah because he doesn't really like he doesn't really like be a pirate
S0653	well he's not evil be he
S0655	no he's not a bad pirate
S0653	i don't know if jam hook be evil either
S0655	well he isn't but he be
S0653	mm
S0655	i mean he he be but he wasn't he wasn't once

S0654	yeah and i really like it
S0653	he trick her didn't he
S0654	mm cos she's a fairy that get ban from fairy from fairyland
S0653	mm
S0655	yeah
S0653	mm
S0655	bad really do you like erm the other tinker bell film with the nature one
S0654	yes
S0655	and the really big beast that actually keep them from die but they think it be a baddie

S0654	tinker bell and the neverbeast
S0655	yeah the neverbeast
S0653	i haven't see that
S0654	it's really really good
S0655	yeah it's fun
S0654	it's really good and they think the beast's really horrible but actually it's harmless
S0655	yeah and it isn't harmless but it can erm but it do save their life but they all
S0653	be this a full length film
S0655	yeah
S0653	i haven't see that one at all
S0654	oh
S0655	and they're only realise it too late
S0654	where
S0653	what happen
S0654	it's about it's about not tinkerbell but another fairy
S0655	yeah
S0654	one of her friends
S0655	she's a nature one she's
S0653	oh okay right
S0655	my personal favourite
S0654	and she and she get this out and hide it in blackberry but she doesn't but and she do haunt fairies but it's
S0655	it's a baby
S0654	it's a baby so the so the so i think she's try to make it so it doesn't eat fairies
S0653	mm
S0654	and then
S0655	yeah
S0654	all the then all the big elves come and all the and all the and then the rescue fairies have to come
S0655	yeah they erm i'm not sure what they do and i'm not sure if i want to know what they do
S0654	they just get the and they get all the elves and put them back where they be
S0653	mm
S0654	if they can
S0655	they might have to do a bite of violence
S0654	they do a little bite of violence
S0655	mm i tell you i didn't want to know what the what it be and i be right
S0654	like throw net that's all they just throw net
S0653	they just what
S0654	they just throw net at them
S0655	and zero percent gas
S0654	they've get gas
S0653	and do it hurt them if they throw net
S0654	they've get sleep gas no it doesn't hurt them if they throw net
S0653	alright
S0655	it depend where they throw them at
S0653	how big be this beast though what be the beast
S0655	like fairy fairy be about this if a fairy
S0654	this be the beast
S0655	if the fairy be this size
S0653	but fairies be tiny aren't they
S0654	yeah they're like the fairy be this size and the size
S0655	the fairy look if a fairy be this size and the beast if the fairy be this size
S0653	mm
S0654	mm
S0655	then the beast then the beast be that size
S0653	but it's nothing that we know it's not an animal that we know
S0655	no it's not an animal we know
S0654	yeah because it doesn't have normal eye
S0653	okay
S0654	and i think
S0655	but anyway erm after they destroy it and it make four tower which mean that he could like they would attract the light the green lightning
S0653	mm
S0655	that would that would either if they go to there they would erm they wouldn't they wouldn't do anything but if they didn't get on there they would destroy the whole of neverland
S0654	no
S0655	that
S0654	fairyland
S0655	oh yeah fairyland
S0653	mm
S0655	and include every single fairy on it
S0654	but the but they fairy start destroy the tower
S0655	yeah they destroy one tower they manage to shoot a big rock and it and destroy one tower and then and then the neverbeast be try to make another one and get shoot by lightning
S0653	oh dear
S0655	and so one of the fairies
S0654	it stop it stop the storm and it stop the storm but then when and but he be dead and one of the fairies come up and she touch him and get it and er and she may have be electrocute i can't remember
S0653	mm
S0654	and she's get shock as well she get shock as well
S0655	yeah she get shock as well but not that badly
S0654	and she be
S0655	and then and then she give the electricity into him
S0654	and he wake up
S0653	oh
S0654	yes but he be very tire and he just get
S0655	yeah and he have to go back to his and he have to go back to his sleep
S0654	for a hundred years
S0653	a hundred years
S0654	be it a thousand or a hundred
S0653	probably a hundred
S0654	a hundred
S0653	that's kinda like a fairytale
S0654	but they make it erm but they make erm like if he ever get thirsty
S0653	mm
S0654	there's some water for him and in case he get scar of the dark they'd get some they give him some light so they might
S0653	ah
S0654	and i'm not sure if fairies ever die
S0653	no i don't think so
S0654	so they'd be able to see him again
S0653	mm
S0654	but not for a hundred years and i think they know and i think they know that he be very nice and kind and gentle yeah and she probably get a and she probably get a lot of pixie dust because a pixie dust yeah
S0653	i like the pixie dust tree
S0654	what about that be that like the be there two pixie dust tree to to be exact
S0653	mm
S0654	because in the big pixie dust tree
S0653	mm
S0654	there's erm there be a pixie dust there be like this there be a blue pixie dust orb
S0653	oh yeah
S0654	and then they shatter it and it go onto a tree to give it but it just look really good so then and a
S0653	it go sort of stronger didn't it in the end i think
S0654	oh yeah and they didn't punish tinker bell
S0653	no thank goodness
S0654	but the main thing be that tinker bell always seem to do like
S0653	get in trouble and things
S0654	she always seem to be very adventurous and very
S0653	she be adventurous isn't she
S0654	it's like when she go to that island
S0655	so be a nature fairy to be fair
S0653	but that's not normal for fairies be it normally they like to just stick to what they know
S0654	but she's like the other guy which have like glass
