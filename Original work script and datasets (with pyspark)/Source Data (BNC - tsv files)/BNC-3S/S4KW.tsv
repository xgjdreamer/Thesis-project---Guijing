S0230	oh
S0198	it's better to make sure you check and also just to mention the disable park again so
S0230	mm
S0198	it's just good that they know who you be when you arrive really
S0230	when you arrive
S0198	make things quicker and easier save explain stuff
S0230	yeah i phone that erm up on
S0198	oh yeah be it then not
S0230	yeah yeah it be
S0230	yeah erm cos i phone er wednesday when i get back from the shop but she finish at half past two
S0198	oh
S0230	and i didn't phone till half three
S0198	ah
S0230	so whoever i speak to say can you phone tomorrow
S0198	yeah
S0230	i say oh i can't tomorrow cos i be on a twelve hour shift again
S0198	mm
S0230	she say friday i say yes i can phone friday after nine thirty so i phone while we be
S0198	oh so you do it in the car this morning
S0230	yeah yeah
S0198	ah so that's why you be so like ah get an interview
S0230	yeah
S0198	so when be that
S0230	next tuesday at ten o'clock
S0198	okay you get to go over to the office in
S0230	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0230	yeah
S0198	ah and be it with do you know the interview
S0230	i well i think so and i say cos i've still get the erm application form i so i say oh i've print the application form off now so i can bring that oh yes she say that that's good that'll save some time
S0198	oh right good so yeah that make you look keen as well doesn't it
S0230	yeah and it save me have to post it off doesn't it
S0198	hopefully i mean it's good though they obviously there be enough on your cv for them to feel confident enough to call you
S0230	call me
S0198	and they understand that you're still work at the moment which isn't any bad thing be it
S0230	no
S0198	that mean you're commit
S0230	yeah
S0198	so and but thankfully only work part time hours or whatever so you can go for an interview obviously check it all out make sure it be what you want to do still
S0230	yeah yeah
S0198	but i don't see as you say i can't see how it's any worse really
S0230	no well i i it's get to be easier hasn't it because you care if you're care for people in their own home they're not gonna be so physically demand as the ones i'm do at the home
S0198	yeah cos they're in their own home for a start yeah some it could be some really basic stuff couldn't it like
S0230	yeah
S0198	shower them or which would be the other end or just take them shop or something can't it
S0230	yeah or even sometimes it be
S0198	housework
S0230	just make sure they take their medication or do them a light meal or something
S0198	or something yeah yeah yeah that's good yeah and you're on and when you be with a patient it's just one patient you're concentrate on
S0230	exactly
S0198	you haven't get you haven't get bell ring from the other patients or anything
S0230	no no
S0198	i guess what it might be it's it's the same amount of hours or whatever cos of have to drive and stuff but the actual contact time isn't so erm stressful it's not so constant surely once if you go go between house you have time to you know take a break for ten minutes or something at least you're sit down
S0230	yeah yeah
S0198	so i don't see i just the only thing it might be be get time off cos you might feel a bite more commit to the individual individual er customers
S0230	mm
S0198	so i don't know how it work for like christmas and stuff like that like you do you go round for christmas
S0230	i don't know
S0198	do the family take care of be that the time when they you might not have to do that
S0230	i don't know what'd happen
S0198	but then at least pop to a house isn't the same as have to
S0230	do a twelve to twelve
S0198	stay in the same place for twelve hours maybe i don't know
S0230	er apparently erm they always use to make christmas rotas so you go towards straight over towards
S0198	yeah
S0230	erm they use to make christmas day erm no er people just do the seven hour shift
S0198	oh right yeah so no one do twelve hours or anything like that
S0230	but but erm be say yesterday that last couple of years they've they've have twelve hour shift as well on christmas day
S0198	oh really
S0230	yeah
S0198	who want to do that on christmas day
S0230	i know
S0198	that's a bite harsh isn't it i mean i suppose if you haven't get any family but most people have some family haven't they
S0230	yeah yeah
S0198	even if it's just spend it with their er like adult family it's still christmas it's a shame cos we don't have many festivities in this country
S0230	no
S0229	get a funeral up the front now
S0198	yeah not have much luck with the traffic be we
S0229	not through here we ain't jesus
S0198	time's not seem to be go down as quickly as we're move
S0229	where's it all come from
S0230	well it's
S0229	why aren't they at work
S0198	it's school holiday isn't it as well more people take time off this time of yeah it's a friday but yeah yeah that guy be quite the classic
S0198	er builder type like it's funny tell us that story about stitch up a traffic warden
S0198	don't mind it be fifteen years ago so you know i be younger different time then like yeah whatever
S0198	i think cos it come up about obviously park and stuff and assume that they just get you know can park wherever be the engineer type people but they can't
S0230	they can't
S0198	no they get ticket quite often i think it's partly it might be because they take liberties with where they can park i don't know if they find it if they find a pay and pay and display spot i'm not sure they have to pay but they can't park in permit holders' spot or on double yellow line i don't think
S0230	mm
S0198	so maybe there's just so many of them they're really they're a private business aren't they
S0230	it's it's really straight over dear
S0229	third exit
S0198	so it's not a public service or anything oh the sign look like they're go over there
S0230	it's more or less straight
S0198	which way be you go towards
S0198	ah that's where be say she's
S0229	that that one up here
S0198	no it's the leave yeah be say she's get a er 's get a job interview in but i think she be make it sound like it's a lot closer to than she realise
S0198	still eighteen miles from here isn't it
S0230	yeah
S0198	say she might be commute into to work but i doubt that i mean i suppose she could
S0230	especially if this this'd be the dark the route it's gonna be busy isn't it
S0198	hour's drive or something at this pace
S0230	yeah
S0198	ah probably won't be that but she's erm they phone me last night as well actually about seven o'clock er and put me on like loud speaker
S0230	oh do they
S0198	do a joint phone call with me which be quite nice
S0198	but i'd not long obviously speak to dad on the phone a little while earlier in the even and then you phone and so after you be like be your phone gonna ring anymore
S0198	i say no so the first night in here and you've have three phone call
S0198	yeah it's just nice people be nice so we're just not use to have a mobile phone

S0198	yeah
S0230	might as well have a day
S0198	have a day trip to the coast
S0230	yeah
S0198	cos erm when will that be i'll be in uni won't i but off on well if my schedule doesn't change i'm off on wednesdays and fridays so maybe you can come down on a wednesday
S0230	mm
S0198	but i do get an email through say this morning he check his message and he look at the handbook for the module i've choose and it say something about have i think i have to sign up to a language class for free but i have to experience and document learn a second language for myself as part of my course so that might really mess up my nice schedule that i have at the moment
S0198	i'm a little bite annoy about it if that's the case i'm happy to do it but i'd rather do it in my lecture time than give myself extra hours of study do you know what i mean
S0230	yeah
S0198	and i've get a feel it's gonna there's gonna be some real abstract lesson er languages there so it's not gonna be anything easy or anything new to learn and it doesn't matter how well you learn it but i've still gotta go through the process in order to write my diary thing it's like it's like three thousand word developmental diary or something i'm like ah i'm already think about change modules
S0230	ah
S0198	but hopefully i'll have the wednesday off so either come to you or you can come to me
S0229	have you do anything to the laptop to make it better
S0198	no not yet because we haven't have the internet have we so erm i'm just like i haven't even turn it on really i charge it today but no i say i'll sort it out
S0230	for sale
S0198	what's that our new laptop
S0230	that's your new one
S0198	yeah it's on windows eight point one which be similar to yours
S0230	yeah
S0198	and give me the quick lowdown on how much better it actually be it's pretty
S0230	what than eight
S0198	well no no it's just better than the windows before
S0230	ah
S0198	he say it be really good
S0230	they look the same to me i don't really know the difference between the two to be honest but the way you've the way you can use windows eight or windows eight point one with that like application look desktop screen do save you a hell of a lot of time that you that be your start bar
S0229	we've get windows eight eight point one now add
S0198	oh you update it do you
S0229	yeah i do it last night
S0198	so next time i'm home i might give you a quick lowdown but then i do it depend what you use your computer for you you don't really use it for much
S0230	no we don't do we
S0198	but for us it's good because when you turn on your computer everything's already there for you to click on so if you click on your mail application 's get both his hotmail and his gmail link to that account so even though he's get two separate email account from different company they're both link under that and they both stay open automatically you click on the facebook app and you're already log in like you're already log in to lot of different things already
S0230	ah
S0198	which save you the whole time of go to the internet and open it it you can save document on there and stuff stuff it's it's just there it's just faster they call it your start screen because before you use to go to start in the bottom leave corner didn't you
S0230	yeah
S0198	and that bring up everything well now you don't have to do that that be what be on your screen
S0230	oh
S0198	that's the whole idea of it that be your start bar
S0230	oh
S0198	so once you get kind of over that and you get use to how you have to click and drag things around the screen that's not that bad at all he seem quite happy with it so
S0230	good
S0198	yeah i mean
S0230	what do he pay for that one
S0198	three fifty
S0230	oh that's not bad
S0198	on on from amazon yeah it be on sale but yeah so not bad at all i mean it's not i think it feel a bite flimsy as an actual laptop i guess they're get lighter and lighter anyway it's lenovo it's a chinese company
S0230	oh
S0198	and er some people love it and some people like buy the products and it doesn't work
S0198	so it's a bite hit and miss but overall they get good review
S0230	ah
S0198	as good as any other company and for that price it's gonna do what we need it to do for the next couple of years so can't really grumble erm but yeah it's definitely yeah it's fine three fifty can't complain but really it's i mean we call it our laptop or do but i mean really it's his laptop
S0198	he get he want to show me it show me everything and i just don't find it very excite
S0198	he's tell me to stop unpack when we first move in he be like let me show you this like just sit down for two minutes and let me do this let me show you i don't really care the printer come something else he's order ah i don't find it that interest
S0230	ah boys and their toy
S0198	yeah basically he still get excite about things like that organise stuff on the calendar
S0230	there's a there's a word now for erm the antique that men go for
