S0152	i do have a couple of glass of whisky
S0012	do you
S0152	yeah
S0012	what not that nice one oh
S0152	i try to get er i i text i want you to try this with some water and without water
S0152	and she go it's better without the water and there be a mark difference there be a mega mark difference in it it's gotta be pure water you can't have tap water because of the chlorine in it but it it be different and it's amaze just how different it be
S0012	oh
S0152	but i do have a couple of glass
S0012	oh well why not that's what it's there for
S0152	i felt like i need to have a couple of glass well only one glass a night but i do feel like it
S0012	yeah very nice you can make a glass of whisky last well a half a pint last for age
S0152	half a pint
S0013	right
S0152	no i'd
S0013	but be it very different it's just not you know not just weaker or something else
S0152	it have it have a different taste to it
S0013	oh
S0012	supposedly this this woman tell me i don't know how she know but she say when you drink whisky straight that's fine you can have more whisky straight than you can have whisky with water because whisky with water will get into your bloodstream quicker
S0152	yeah
S0013	oh do it
S0012	than straight whisky
S0152	because it's because it's that little bite thinner and water go it's absorb
S0012	yeah
S0152	more water be absorb isn't it
S0012	in the gut
S0152	but it it have a it have a a sweeter taste to it this whisky have a sweeter taste to it
S0013	oh
S0152	when you put some water in it when you put pure
S0013	so you prefer it
S0152	erm i don't mind either way
S0012	no
S0152	but it it's just i i've never think it would make such a difference i always think like you it make it weaker
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	so you're dilute it which be what you're do but it's a totally different character then and it's so really different and you only have to put the small the minute you know let's say a thimble full in a in a measure
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it's amaze just how different it be
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	absolutely amaze
S0013	right
S0152	absolutely amaze so
S0012	even morrison's have get litres now litres at fifteen pound a litre bell whisky
S0152	yeah well that's a blend isn't it
S0012	well you wouldn't get fifteen pound a litre for for erm pure scotch whisky would you
S0152	you see bushmills the irish whisky alright
S0012	yeah
S0152	that's a blend even though it's a single malt
S0012	yeah what a blend of single malt be it
S0152	what they do be they have they make all the bushmill whisky and they make it all
S0012	yeah
S0152	they they put it in the the bond etcetera and then they tip it all out into one big vat to mix it
S0012	oh right
S0152	to get the characteristics of the bushmill
S0012	yeah
S0152	which be i never think of it like that but that's what they do where others will put it in their barrel and each one be slightly different
S0012	yeah
S0152	it'll still have the same kind of taste but the bushmills taster have to blend it so it's always the same taste
S0012	oh right
S0013	oh
S0012	i wonder if you can get a job as a taster

S0152	they would put twenty five house there that be to compromise
S0013	but it's not the same people though
S0012	it's the people who live in in the house
S0013	it's yeah
S0012	in in old house that have put in the plan
S0013	they'd put that one in
S0152	they've put it in have they
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah whereas the other ones they've put in for and there's one up in
S0012	yeah they put in for now you know where you go up and that and that and the road stop
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	they've put in for house on on the rest of that land
S0152	behind the school
S0012	yeah behind the behind the school yeah
S0013	but this one be a private one really it's just the guy that move in there
S0012	but i didn't know they have a great big protest along that road
S0152	mm
S0012	load of load of people
S0013	yeah
S0152	yeah i saw it in miscellaneous just a few people
S0152	yeah but
S0012	well they've get line of people up there
S0152	it's only a single road isn't it a line of
S0012	yeah yeah but i mean at least they have people out there do it
S0013	mm
S0152	yeah well to be honest
S0012	eighty odd house be no good because it's just gonna all as they say it's gonna overrun the doctor's and and the school because the school isn't build for it
S0152	yeah but the problem be we have there aren't that many children in at the moment of that school age
S0012	no
S0013	but they
S0152	so the school in theory could close because there's only a small number come through
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh
S0152	so the the effect of not have cos if you think about it the village hasn't get that many young people in it
S0012	no no it's an older village now isn't it
S0013	mm
S0152	erm and it all depend on how many preschool will give you some idea of how many students
S0012	yeah
S0152	will come will come through
S0012	yeah
S0152	but i i be under the impression there's a little bite of a dip at the moment with the number of kid in
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	it must be the water but
S0013	mm
S0012	but if if they're go to try and build eighty house down there down at there will there will be a lot of problems but the entrance to the village be pretty useless anyway innit
S0152	well if you think where it be
S0013	mm
S0152	and if you come off the
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	you don't have to come down only eighty house a hundred and sixty a hundred and sixty people
S0012	eighty house a hundred and sixty people that's just a hundred people a hundred sixty
S0152	that's two people per house
S0012	two people and if you say three and a half people per house which they reckon be average three and a half people then you've get eighty
S0152	you
S0012	three eights three eights
S0152	that's two hundred and forty basically
S0012	two hundred and forty two hundred and fifty
S0152	your your big issue the only issue
S0152	i would say that you would have the only erm this be think about what's happen at and place like that be that people won't be they'll build the house and people won't be able to get the mortgage
S0012	no they won't will they
S0013	yeah no
S0152	erm and therefore it go to social house
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you'll have social house people that end of the village
S0012	yeah
S0152	which be not knock people in social house or anything
S0012	no no
S0152	but that that's what
S0013	mm
S0152	or you'll or you'll have
S0012	will they be house or bungalows that's the point cos most of the place and they're actual bungalows haven't they there's some house down that way
S0152	yeah what you all the house
S0012	and there's house along the
S0152	there's there's bungalows all along which if you think about what's erm because you've get be it erm what's her name who's the artist down there
S0012	oh yeah
S0012	yeah what's her name who paint
S0013	erm
S0152	whatever her name be
S0152	no no cos she's
S0012	oh you mean the other one right up er up that long lane
S0152	yeah
S0013	oh
S0152	you've get so you come along there and they're all bungalows until you get to that what use to be the house that be up for auction with a swim pool and whatever
S0012	yeah
S0152	then you've get house from there
S0012	yeah
S0152	and then on that then you've get that big house the big white house by the bus stop just before you get to
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	what's the road call as you go around like the back of up there
S0013	mm
S0152	as you come down and those be all house along there
S0012	yeah i know where you mean
S0013	yeah
S0152	so so the house need
S0013	mm
S0152	so if they put house there it wouldn't make any difference
S0012	no
S0152	because you've get the house on that side
S0013	mm
S0012	but then as as a as a good way into the
S0152	but you see they do the watercourse there a couple of years ago
S0012	yeah
S0152	so they know something be happen
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos they actually strengthen the bridge there
S0012	yeah and another thing be the new waterworks they're put up that's go to supply that's go to supply load of people have you see it i mean it's massive ain't it you know so they're get the water ready to fee lot more people otherwise i mean when we first move here there be no water pressure you could hardly get water pressure upstairs could you
S0013	and there be a water tower
S0012	yeah and there be a water tower down there a big green water tower weren't there but there be still no water pressure and then they have to pump the water up from up to this one here but now they're put their own one in which be a big bore they're gonna put in or they're put it in
S0152	yeah
S0012	i mean they've be bore for age now haven't they you can hear it go every day of the week and er well that'll get the water up
S0152	be that the bore or be that the concrete mix cos they've get that big
S0012	yeah they've also get that but they've be bore as well with a big crane and ballum ballum ballum ballum ballum ballum go down and down and down
S0152	drill down
S0012	so they've get to bore anyway to get the water out and they can't pump all that water up from
S0152	underneath there
S0012	it must be there's more water on the top of the hill than there be through the bottom there it's weird innit cos jack and jill go up the hill to fetch a pale of water yeah
S0152	so
S0012	i think it's really weird when you get erm you get up in in the dales and and and you get water come down all the time
S0152	yeah
S0012	all the time
S0152	yeah it's just a permeation through the rock isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it find it's an easy way out
S0012	you think it weren't ever go to stop doesn't it
S0152	they have some nice snow up there at the weekend
S0012	do they
