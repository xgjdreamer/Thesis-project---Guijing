S0012	anyhow eh i've gotta go wednesday
S0008	mm
S0012	to have the first
S0013	it's a few wednesday's yet
S0008	first fit
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0008	oh that's a bite have you have it do before
S0012	no
S0008	oh that's a bite of a
S0012	be it
S0008	they get this sort of stuff and it's a bite like play doh
S0012	oh right
S0008	right
S0008	but more sticky
S0012	oh
S0008	and er they use load of it right and er you open your mouth up and they have this sort of like big wodge of it like it's about er er i dunno how big er but it seem like that thick by about
S0012	yeah
S0008	that size right and they stick it in your mouth and they say right bite on that and like mm like that and it go everywhere
S0008	and then then this sort of thing where they er oh i can't quite remember how they do it where they leave it there for a couple of minutes
S0013	gotta set hasn't it
S0008	to set and er then they sort of like this
S0008	and a mouthful of stuff
S0012	oh crikey
S0008	and
S0012	go on put me off put me off
S0008	and then they sort of peel it off you know
S0013	mm
S0008	how they do it and then they say right that's it and you're only there for about ten minutes
S0012	ah
S0008	then you go back after a couple of days and
S0012	yeah i gotta go back three
S0008	and then they do another one
S0012	mm
S0008	and then they forget how they how they sort of like a set of teeth they make out of it
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be suppose to match your mouth
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	well the inside of your mouth
S0013	mm
S0008	and then they can make this denture
S0012	yeah
S0008	fit the but you know when they sort of do all this you sort of think well how'd they get it so wrong you know
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos the worst thing be i find cos cos the one i have it's sort of be shape to clip cos it be only a part thing on the back it be sort of
S0013	mm
S0008	shape to clip on the bottom of your front teeth
S0012	mm
S0008	you know and then the sort of the plate sort of not very big plate but it sort of go back and then there's sort of it sort of clip on the back teeth and er you think well that ain't very much you know but it just it's in your mouth you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	you it's sort of like a lump in your mouth
S0013	mm
S0008	all the time
S0012	mm
S0008	and your tongue get catch up on it
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos if you think about it like
S0012	mm
S0008	when you're talk
S0012	yeah
S0008	your tongue be just constantly go
S0012	course
S0008	to and fro on the
S0012	yeah
S0008	on your bottom palate
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah that's right mm
S0008	it's constantly go to and fro as you talk
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er cos there's a big lump there and it's sort of like a ridge which isn't much
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it feel like a ridge about an eighth of an inch thick you know
S0012	well it's like anything yeah yeah if you get an ulcer er in your mouth that feel oh it's a that's a great big
S0008	mm
S0012	carbuncle but when you look it's just a little tiny white spot or something like that
S0008	mm
S0013	mm
S0008	but then i think they give you all this sort of information on fixodent which i think
S0013	right
S0008	you know cos cos they say oh wear it for a while and then your
S0012	yeah
S0008	gum get use to it
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and then you this fixodent which be like be like
S0012	gluey sort of stuff ain't it
S0008	yeah it's sort of er a gluey sort of stuff
S0012	a soft glue mm
S0008	come in a tube like toothpaste and you you know put it on the bottom of the dentures and on the denture then push it down then it sort of set it and hold it there apparently very effectively
S0013	be this a bite like the stuff they put in your mouth er in the begin
S0008	i don't know what erm
S0013	mm
S0008	could well be sound a bite similar but then you know you have to sort of clean it off every day
S0012	do you oh
S0013	oh
S0008	well i think so otherwise your teeth be stick in
S0012	oh of course they be yeah
S0013	right
S0008	and they don't recommend
S0008	leave your teeth in er
S0012	no they don't do they
S0008	overnight
S0012	no
S0008	so it's just like er you know another thing on the weekly shop bill
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know three quid's worth of denture fix
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	now you're really worry aren't you
S0008	but it's worth it for the experience i tell you
S0012	just for the experience
S0008	well they might work i mean i never get mine properly fit it's not
S0012	no
S0008	that be where i go wrong because i get this one tooth at the back
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	which it clip onto
S0013	mm
S0008	and i get a feel there's something wrong with that tooth anyway
S0012	mm what's it a wisdom tooth
S0008	mm
S0012	be it
S0008	it's the only one i get leave on that side
S0012	yeah
S0008	at the bottom
S0013	yeah
S0008	no er the reason i get dentures be i think well if i lose any more teeth i'll need something to
S0012	yeah
S0008	to be able to eat on or to chew with
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	cos i've get
S0013	yeah
S0008	not many leave now on the bottom

S0008	mm
S0012	i use to spend age down the bottom of the field with my pliers and my screwdriver

S0012	well yeah no er the school dentist
S0013	scary
S0012	use to just put just pull em out
S0008	mm i know

S0008	mm
S0012	i've never know em with teeth
S0008	never have any problem without teeth

S0008	well that's the first erm reaction weren't it to bad teeth
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but it's very strange that they say that nowadays the erm you know like people eat so many sugar and all this
S0012	mm
S0008	and how terrible it be and er and how bad kids' teeth be but kid don't seem to have
S0013	mm
S0008	as bad teeth as we have
S0012	yeah
S0008	when they say we have a perfect diet
S0012	yeah
S0013	that's true
S0008	sort of after the war you know
S0013	yeah
S0008	they say oh load of vegetables and no sugar
S0013	that be true isn't it
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	but everyone i know er use to have bad teeth
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm
S0008	it's like when they use to come round and the school dentist come round
S0012	mm
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	everyone have to have fill and stuff didn't they
S0012	yeah they do or pull out
S0013	mm
S0008	but i can't understand that when they sort of run on about it's how such a wonderful diet it be
S0012	no
S0013	yeah
S0008	and you know they sort of you know
S0012	that's true i've never think of that
S0013	yeah
S0008	i mean teeth need calcium don't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	so they can't say anything about that cos they use to give you free milk
S0012	yeah they do didn't they yeah
S0013	they do
S0012	we use to
S0008	use to drink a third of a bottle of milk
S0012	third of a bottle a day and i use to be milk monitor
S0008	which nowadays they reckon that
S0013	mm
S0008	er you know you shouldn't drink that much
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know it's bad for you
S0012	i use to be milk monitor
S0013	we're a great believer in milk aren't we
S0012	yeah we love our milk
S0013	mm
S0012	and er when i be a milk monitor at the senior school funnily enough
S0008	mm
S0012	we use to have load of milk over cos kid didn't
S0008	no one'd no one'd drink it would they
S0012	well it be a funny taste one
S0008	well it weren't no it be in the summer when they'd be stand there and
S0012	yeah it's all be stand there all day
S0008	stand out in the sun all day
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	weren't so good be it but that be full milk wasn't it
S0012	mm full cream milk that be yeah
S0008	mm
S0012	i remember the first time that get pasteurise though cos we use to have our our dairy in in er they use to 's his name be and we use to have to go up to him with a a jug and in his dairy he have a great big concrete bath type thing
S0008	mm
S0012	full of milk where the where the
S0008	all the fly come round it and
S0013	yeah
S0012	and a and a great big wooden paddle
S0013	get warm get warm
S0012	and he always use to say you make sure you stir that milk boy
S0012	so you'd go in there and scoop er scoop the top off first and then then stick it in and that'd all mix up by the time you come out again and he'd look and you'd pay your money it be only about three pence or six pence something like that
S0008	mm that be a treat the first bite weren't it the cream off of it
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	and
S0013	it's all gotta be pasteurise now though
S0008	eh
S0012	it's all
S0013	it's all get to be pasteurise hasn't it
S0012	well when it be first pasteurise
S0012	i hat the stuff
S0013	homogenise
S0012	yeah i think that be horrible stuff cos the co op be the first to pasteurise the milk weren't it
S0008	dunno
S0012	yeah they use to have the milk market board down er i think it be the bottom of
S0013	yeah it be
S0008	oh
S0012	and next door to it be the co op milk place so they be
S0008	mm
S0012	both together i reckon they must've be collude
S0013	at college we use to get
S0008	i think the milk market board no i be gonna say they probably control everything but they didn't do they

S0008	you'd think that as she's do it every time she'd remember
S0013	but it's dangerous to keep
S0012	yeah
S0013	get down and do it all again
S0008	mm
S0012	but to get down there that's why she fall over
S0008	yeah

S0013	mm

S0012	right
S0013	mm
S0008	uhu
S0012	they come past you in in their you know
S0008	mm
S0012	and they're they're have a good time and then they look down at whatever it be they're look down at why do they do that have you ever notice em
S0008	they look down no
S0012	when you watch these bikers that come past you
S0008	what sort of bike be they rid
S0012	well all sort of bike decent bike you know
S0008	and you reckon they look down
S0012	they look down to see they just and they
S0008	no i've never notice that
S0013	mm
S0012	ain't you
S0008	no
S0012	well i've notice it every time every time they come past
S0008	you know which be you don't get nowadays people who've rebuild their own bike
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they're look down to see if there's any oil out or the nut
S0012	well that's probably what they be
S0013	yeah yeah
S0012	they these these
S0008	something like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i mean on a modern bike
S0013	mm
S0008	most people never put a spanner on em so
S0012	no they don't do they well they're not
S0008	in a like in a modern car you know you don't need to do any maintenance
S0013	mm
S0012	i think there's only one bike who british bike now ain't there be a triumph or be it a norton one of the two
S0008	well triumph have bike norton have make they're not the original norton it's just people buy
S0012	yeah
S0008	the name up and build some sort of bike
S0012	yeah
S0008	but that's you can still buy a norton yeah i think you can still buy an ajs but that's
S0012	yeah
S0008	run by an indian company
S0012	yeah that's right yeah that's right
S0008	and you can still buy a er enfield bullet
S0012	oh you i saw them on the television just the other day the enfield bullets
S0008	they're make they're make by in india
S0012	they're yeah and they be they be talk about all the old motorbike you know like
S0008	mm
S0012	and there be ariel come up remember the ariels
S0008	yeah i have an ariel
S0012	yeah
S0008	but they erm i get a feel that there's some i think you know there's another you know what they do they buy all the components from china
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and put a all they make be the tank with the write on it and call it something else you know
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and er i've get a feel there's a an ariel about
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but it's nothing to do with the original company you know
S0012	no no no they just get the name now haven't they
S0008	but triumph be do well
S0012	they be do well yeah yeah
S0008	you know they make these sort of big prestige bike
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and apparently they sell quite a lot of em
S0012	they're quite a lot of money too
S0008	and that be quite good because that's this company who buy out the old triumph
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er sort of start off just make replacement part and stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then sort of slowly er have er one bike and then get some money from somewhere and redesign the whole system
S0012	yeah
S0008	the whole the whole lot but they work out the principle that they would make twin i don't think they no they don't make a single they make twin a triple and a four cylinder bike you know with
S0012	yeah
S0008	different engine you know these three different engines but nearly all the part be interchangeable like the pistons the rods
S0012	oh i see
S0008	the crank
S0012	they're all the same yeah
S0008	and all this stuff so that they don't have to make load of different bits
S0012	no that's a good idea
S0008	like you know and things like starter motor and
S0012	yeah
S0008	er alternators and they're all interchangeable
S0012	mm
S0008	in all their model
S0012	mm
S0008	whether they still do that now or not i don't know but that be er sort of the money save idea that they have
S0012	yeah when do the first er electric ignition come in cos i hadn't i can't remember an electric ignition when when i be younger
S0008	what the starter motor
S0012	yeah well
S0008	i mean they have em in the war didn't they
S0012	do they i don't know they they be the german ones they have during the war weren't they
S0008	what be you talk about on a on a bike
S0012	yeah when you
S0008	oh i'm talk on a car
S0012	oh well no i'm talk about bike
S0008	oh on motorbike
S0012	yeah
S0008	probably when the japanese model first come over
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	that would have be in about nineteen sixties
S0012	yeah
S0008	early sixties when the japanese model when the bigger bike
S0012	mm
S0008	bigger japanese model come over
S0012	that's right yeah yeah
S0008	cos that be all quite amaze weren't it they have electric start
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	oh no kick start how what be you gonna do if your battery
S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah the old kick start
S0008	and their early ones they have kick start and electric start didn't they
S0012	yeah yeah well you have a kick start and electric start didn't you on on that one that you have up here
S0008	no no
S0012	i'm sure you do
S0008	i just have electric start
S0012	that be electric start but there be a kick
S0008	what the red one
S0012	yeah there be a kick on it as well weren't there
S0008	no no
S0012	weren't there
S0008	no
S0012	oh
S0008	it be just electric start
S0012	oh i think i saw a kick start on it
S0008	no no no
S0013	mm
S0008	that's why i be a bite dodgy about hop it be gonna start
S0012	that's right er yeah you be weren't you
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah yeah you could never run start em could you shall we have a cup of tea
S0013	yeah do you want a cup of tea now or do you want to make the most of what i'm now

S0008	's sister yeah who live in singapore have a baby
S0012	do she oh
S0008	no live in hong kong
S0012	in hong kong right
S0008	cos and the reason she's didn't come back to have the baby because she want the baby to have dual citizenship with china
S0012	oh i see yeah yeah do you know there's a lot of people do that now
S0008	why
S0012	i don't know i mean
S0008	why would they we couldn't understand why she'd want her child have dual citizen
S0012	that's right
S0008	chinese citizenship
S0012	no well 's friend
S0008	yeah
S0012	they have the baby's birth at the same time
S0008	yeah
S0012	but that's what one of em come back to edinburgh where she live
S0008	yeah
S0012	so she could get british citizenship and chinese citizenship
S0008	mm
S0013	and she's think ahead her scottish so you don't haven't to pay for university that's
S0012	yeah you don't have to pay if they're bear in scotland they don't have to pay for
S0008	yeah tuition fee
S0012	tuition fee
S0008	that's it
S0012	but that that's a long while ahead though ain't it
S0008	big change before then
S0012	yes
S0008	but i don't understand why these this couple want to have dual nationality
S0012	no
S0008	cos they're do the same thing when be there
S0012	be they yeah
S0008	well what be she do be she
S0012	english teach english yeah
S0008	yeah that's that's right that's what i think i didn't know whether she'd go into something else

S0008	but erm that's what they're do in er hong kong
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and do you know what they call the baby boy

S0012	oh dear oh dear you're not you're not the greatest of at the moment then
S0008	no honestly call the kid
S0012	well that's right i mean
S0008	like perhaps the idea be you you get rid of all the bad luck straight away
S0012	yeah probably still he could have be eat by a whale couldn't he
S0008	mm but then i be sort of think about it and i be think i'm sure that's a erm you know to be a be to be someone who bring bad luck
S0012	yeah
S0008	isn't it i'm sure of it
S0012	and to be a er be to be a turncoat ain't it
S0008	well er that's right yeah but he weren't call
S0008	that be his middle name
S0013	yeah
S0012	what be you look at
S0008	i just sort of notice that sort of dome thing you get
S0012	oh that's a that's a load of wood that a friend of ours
S0008	oh yeah
S0012	and er and he's put a over the top of it
S0013	cover it up cos of winter
S0008	just to keep it nice and damp inside
S0012	probably yeah so it'll stink like hell when you when
S0008	yeah that's how they go rotten don't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	the thing with wood be you've gotta keep the air flow through it
S0012	you have yeah yeah
S0008	but then his wood his
S0012	mm
S0008	but then you say his wood his
S0012	that's right yeah that's his wood but they do come along and cut all my grass for me er down the field
S0008	oh really
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah when they hear you be go into hospital wasn't it
S0012	yeah

S0012	no
S0008	so you can burn it that'd be for you
S0012	that would weren't it yeah still we can burn a lot of it
S0008	yeah
S0012	then then i'll attack it with a chainsaw i think that's the only thing i can do i can't
S0008	mm
S0012	i can't chop it
S0008	no
S0012	i'm not go to chop it probably get a few slice off of it and that's it you know
S0008	well that's right i mean the thing be it's get to the stage where you know you sort of quite appreciate the challenge but then er you're gonna do your shoulder in or something
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	or do your back in
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's a long while
S0012	that's a long while heal ain't it yeah

S0012	anyway cos that's i dunno how long ago be that
S0008	a couple of years ago
S0012	a couple of years now yeah yeah
S0008	it's gonna be reasonably dry

S0013	oh gosh
S0012	oh no
S0008	so he but he say oh it's silly really cos i i shouldn't really go cross country with them thin road tyres on
S0013	oh
S0012	well he shouldn't should he
S0008	no and with clip ons
S0012	oh what
S0008	you know they have
S0013	oh no
S0008	these things where your your feet be actually clip to the pedal
S0013	yeah
S0012	clip to the pedal yeah
S0008	i mean
S0013	oh you're stick aren't you
S0008	i mean he's daft isn't he
S0012	well he's gotta be ain't he
S0008	well that's oh i'll have to tell him next he say i say you wouldn't go think of go motocrossing with your boot glue to the peg
S0012	no you wouldn't would you
S0008	you know you need your feet out to
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well that's a bite silly ain't it
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0008	ain't he
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and then er he ain't peg up anymore so why
S0012	no that's right
S0008	you know it's not hard
S0012	i i've never understand people who clip the
S0013	no
S0012	clip the shoe into the pedal
S0008	mm
S0012	why do they do it
S0008	it's so you can pull the pedal as hard as push it
S0012	yeah but i mean that's that seem a
S0008	extra power
S0012	that seem so daft to me
S0008	mm but then he buy he's gotta make erm he have his winter project to make four chair right
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos you know he he sort of be practice with erm bentwood chair
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	well he make himself a steamer and
S0013	mm
S0008	he make a you know he get the the table with all the peg in
S0013	yeah
S0008	and he actually make in last year he make himself a bentwood chair
S0012	oh right
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know where you steam the wood and you bend it round the frame
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then when it dry out it stay bend
S0012	stay where it be yeah
S0008	and er so he have this erm you know he'd he'd do it all last year or whenever and he be gonna make four of these chair and try and sell them and he about this for a long while and then he suddenly find this site on the internet where you could actually buy wood to your which have be machine to your specification right
S0012	wow
S0013	mm
S0008	and so he spend two hundred quid on buy all this all this wood for these chair already cut and machine you know they're sort of like little
S0013	yeah
S0008	sort of thin
S0012	yeah
S0008	sticky bits that be all gonna be bend and er
S0013	mm
S0008	so he he start do that and er stick em in his steamer mm didn't seem to work very well so he he buy a new yet another wallpaper steamer thing
S0012	yeah
S0008	to provide more steam you get these immaculate sort of like long box what he's make line with you know insulation and stuff like that and
S0012	yeah
S0008	which the steam go in the wood all and er so he improve that so he get more hot hotter and er that didn't work and then he chuck all his wood in his pond so it get you know
S0012	wet yeah
S0008	wet
S0013	mm
S0008	and then try it again
S0012	really soak yeah
S0008	and er he go alright sod it heat it up as much as he could get it out slap a bite on this thing and it just go snap
S0012	oh no
S0013	oh
S0008	just snap
S0013	oh
S0012	do it oh
S0008	and er he's try a couple of time
S0012	cor i'd've love to have be in there and hear the blue air
S0008	he try that a couple of time and er he just can't get this wood to bend
S0013	mm
S0008	and er then he be couldn't work out why why it wasn't work you know and this be the thing you know i mean it should work
S0012	yeah it should yeah
S0008	and so why isn't it work and after much search and on the internet
S0012	it be cut the wrong grain i suppose
S0008	no it wasn't it be cos it be kiln dry
S0012	oh
S0008	right
S0013	oh
S0008	once you kiln dry wood below a certain moisture content you get this chemical change
S0013	yeah
S0008	in the wood which be irreversible
S0013	right
S0012	oh right
S0008	and that's why stuff like furniture don't move about
S0013	yeah
S0008	and it's all make with kiln dry and
S0012	yeah
S0008	then once it's kiln dry you know the moisture isn't gonna affect it at all because it's
S0013	mm

S0013	yeah
S0008	look at erm how to put a front headlight in a volkswagen beetle
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	a couple of days ago
S0008	god i mean that's a it's erm you meet haven't you
S0012	yes yeah
S0008	who live in france she take her car into 's for her mot
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it fail on the fact that the driver's door the automatic lock didn't work although it still lock on the key
S0012	oh right
S0008	right and the headlamps be a bite dim you know like the
S0012	yeah
S0008	the plastic be a bite haze on em like
S0012	oh i see
S0008	and i think they cost the best part of a thousand pound to fit them
S0012	what
S0012	oh what a rip off
S0008	well that's right these headlamp
S0008	replaceable headlamp units i think they're about dunno must've cost more than a thousand because they be about four hundred pound a piece
S0012	wow
S0008	or the best part of that i'm sure they we're something like that
S0012	and they just go hazy do they
S0008	well the the plastic on the outside
S0012	yeah
S0008	it sort of like go hazy it's like ours on our car it's exactly the same it look go a bite cloudy
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er
S0013	mm
S0008	we get round it by put extra powerful light bulbs in
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they measure the lumens right
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	and er but the you know the official price for the headlamp unit for er these beetle be something like four hundred and thirty quid each
S0012	crikey
S0008	and the door lock you know be several hundred quid
S0013	gosh
S0008	and i look i look on the net

S0012	wow
S0013	yeah
S0008	and have em deliver to your door

S0008	erm and er with er for the beetle
S0012	yeah
S0008	there be two clip you er undo the main lock clip undo the hold clip wriggle it a bite and it just slide out

S0012	oh right
S0008	so it's that easy right
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah

S0008	mid november i hate have an mot at that time of the year
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know cos if you don't fix anything it's sort of cold and wet and horrible
S0012	yeah
S0008	not in the summer you know it's sort of
S0012	yeah
S0008	get more
S0012	you'll have to bring it down there and put it under your under the thing
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well you you can do that can't you
S0008	yeah i would do yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	but last last year it fail on the exhaust pipe and you know it's where the pipework come under the car
S0012	yeah
S0008	go into the the main can
S0012	yeah
S0008	and all the back of that have all rot through that
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	so i have to i mean the rest of it be perfect
S0012	yeah
S0008	but the back of it have all rot through so i have to put a get a new one
S0012	you couldn't weld it up
S0008	no it's you know it have go completely
S0012	yeah
S0008	and plus the fact be that
S0013	mm
S0008	you know you can get these aftermarket exhaust bits for next to nothing and like
S0012	you can yeah yeah
S0008	like go to kwik fit and it's like oh that's a hundred quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you go online and it's like twenty three quid deliver
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and anyway i get this bite back have a hell of a job
S0012	put it on
S0008	take it to bits cos you're sort of like on your back and it's like this far away
S0012	yeah i know yeah
S0008	and but it's sort of like a bite of a challenge you know what i mean
S0008	anyway i'd just connect it all up put it on but then i notice that where it join like the the the the erm silencer bite this you know it's get a round end
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and this pipe have get a flare end
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	where it fit
S0012	yeah
S0008	together and then you put a clamp on
S0012	and then you clamp it up
S0008	and of course this pipe come along at the flare end half the flare have all rot away as well
S0012	oh crikey yeah
S0008	so i sort of put it together and fill it all up with firegum and er it pass last time but this time i think you know over the course of a year all that sort of filler and that have probably fall out so it probably need
S0012	yeah it's probably get too hard and fell out you know
S0008	yeah
S0012	the the the rust have let it go too
S0008	but the the problem i the the the the the well not the problem the joke of it be be that when i buy the silencer for about twenty three quid off ebay you know one of these firm
S0012	yeah
S0008	i could've buy the whole length you know all three bits
S0012	yeah
S0008	like the end that bite that middle bite and the bite at the front for about fifty quid
S0012	oh
S0008	which i should've do you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	i really should've do put it all together but
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	now if it that middle bite go i've gotta take it all to bits again
S0012	you gotta take it all to bits yeah the lot have gotta come off ain't it
S0008	but luckily there's no erm catalyst on it
S0012	ain't there
S0008	no luckily cos the new ones have get them catalysts in them ain't they
S0012	they've all get catalyst converters ain't they
S0008	yeah and they've get erm particle filter as well

S0012	it say hill start help that's what come on
S0008	mm
S0012	hill start help and off you go
S0008	and what and so you stop at the traffic light on a hill
S0012	yeah
S0008	you take your foot do you take your foot off the brake

S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	cos on something like that you wouldn't
S0013	oh i suppose you you could you could put the handbrake up now
S0012	you could put the handbrake on
S0013	you could do it
S0008	you have actually get a handbrake have you
S0013	well that's that little little click

S0008	this button
S0013	just
S0012	whether it whether that work on the on the
S0013	where the driver bite be

S0008	no where's the button when you're sit there
S0012	the button be right next to you
S0013	yeah
S0008	so it's just sort of where the handbrake normally be

S0012	you put it through the say you can do thirty
S0013	that would
S0012	that'll keep you go thirty and er if you exceed it
S0008	yeah but i mean you're say that

S0013	yeah it flash up red doesn't it if you're go over
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	our do
S0008	on a satnav

S0008	that's good though ain't it so
S0012	yeah
S0008	kind of
S0013	er you you don't always watch it do you so
S0008	eighty quid to go to a bloody speed awareness thing
S0012	oh yeah you do didn't you
S0013	yeah but doesn't er always take any notice
S0008	yeah but it's so easy
S0012	rubbish you're sit there say
S0013	you don't
S0012	you're sit there say huh it's thirty
S0012	yeah okay
S0013	yeah i think you're do seventy five
S0012	oh
S0013	okay i can't go down anymore
S0012	just follow the traffic that's all you're do
S0008	mm
S0013	but it's go flash flash red
S0008	well when we go into london last time we go in on the a12 which take you down and it come in at the blackwall tunnel right
S0012	yeah
S0008	then it's basically er erm canary wharf you know i mean
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	but and er when i use to live in london you know sometime i live in and er i use to sort of go back up the a12 again sort of drive round all these streets and round the house and
S0012	yeah
S0008	through these high streets and that so i never bother to go on it before
S0012	no
S0008	cos i think oh that's that's always
S0013	mm
S0008	a bite tedious anyway this time i think i'd try it out and you drive along the m11 to the north circular
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know you get your go under the m25
S0012	that's right
S0008	get on the north circular soon as you're on the north circular you get this sort of fork to the a12 you know a slip road
S0012	yeah
S0008	go to the a12 big roundabout head towards london and i tell you what it's like a glacier have be through london
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah it's just dual carriageways have be blitz right through the centre of london
S0012	wow
S0008	right it's all the way as far as blackwall tunnel and you go underground some bits you know and
S0012	yeah
S0008	but this
S0013	mm
S0008	massive great wide road but that's sort of fifty you know so you have
S0012	yeah

S0013	mm
S0008	and it sort of go round there but what a brilliant road
S0012	be it
S0013	yeah
S0008	and how much must that have cost to build
S0012	well do they er destroy house and villages and stuff
S0008	they must've do like i say it's like
S0013	mm
S0008	a glacial valley you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	you're drive along this road and there's sort of wall up there and there's people up there you know sort of go about normal life
S0013	mm
S0008	a few overpasses then you go in the tunnel and
S0013	oh
S0008	you come up again and it's sort of like everything in its way have be demolish
S0012	that use to be a horrible road
S0008	it do it use to be like traffic light and god know what
S0012	yeah
S0008	and the
S0013	mm
S0008	all the high streets use to go to through it didn't they
S0012	yeah yeah

S0012	cor it be nowadays ain't it
S0013	mm
S0012	when i be a boy we have to dig hole
S0012	with a spade

S0008	not much you know but it be er above atmospheric pressure
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i say to this guy who be who be interview me for the job i say er well you know what about these er you know er er problems with work under compress air do you alleviate you know how do you do that sort that out and he say oh we're not really bother about that
