S0212	yeah
S0202	the cinema and like
S0202	hi
S0212	it's like my erm
S0202	
S0212	one of my friends who's er
S0212	but it's like my er
S0212	american friend obviously there's a lot of erm racism
S0202	police brutality
S0212	with the police over there and she say cos she live in quite a dodgy neighbourhood and she say some of her friends would literally cos they have quotas so they would literally stop her black friends and like search them but be really like aggressive towards them for like no reason and it be just
S0202	yeah
S0212	mess up so it's kind of good that now it's come to light and
S0202	mm
S0212	hopefully but i think the main guy doesn't wanna move out or whatever so
S0202	yeah but the thing be like it really piss me off er why have it take so long for it to come out
S0212	yeah
S0202	why have it take fifty years like
S0212	mm
S0202	forty years or whatever i mean i know these victims be scar of come out and stuff but like surely someone know something someone who didn't agree with it know something and be and like
S0212	yeah
S0202	didn't want to speak out but it's like you go to the police and you give them an anonymous confession or you can even ring up from a phone box like
S0212	mm
S0202	where you don't live and no one's gonna know it be you
S0212	yeah
S0202	but the thing be the information's there the police have get it they can investigate it like if they have a tip that someone be run this big thing with paedophiles and shit then the police will go out and investigate it
S0212	yeah
S0202	whether it's anonymous tip or not they've get to by law they've get to do it
S0212	yeah
S0202	so i just don't understand how so many people cos there must have be so many people that know about it and didn't say anything
S0212	yeah
S0202	and i don't care how much money someone pay me if if i know someone be rap a baby or a child like
S0212	yeah
S0202	i er
S0212	that's mess up
S0202	it don't matter how much i would take the money and then i would go and like
S0202	no but like if they say to you right
S0212	yeah
S0202	i'll pay you out or i'm gonna kill you like i'd take the money and then i'd fuck go and
S0212	yeah
S0202	grass them up to the police and hand the money over to the police as proof like
S0212	yeah and the thing be now the people who probably know and didn't say anything they're probably gonna get in the shit as well anyway so
S0202	yeah that's even if they're in on any of the record cos now it's so far back there's only paper record they can go by like
S0212	mm
S0202	they can't go by hearsay this far back cos it'd be throw out in court cos the that's the thing with the law like you know you you're study it yourself you know like
S0212	yeah
S0202	you've get to have solid evidence to
S0212	yeah
S0202	to get someone
S0212	beyond all reasonable doubt
S0202	yeah like and if you haven't get that then it'll get throw out in court
S0212	yeah
S0202	and it's just waste money and time
S0212	yeah it's kind of things like that that make me want to be a lawyer like justice so
S0202	yeah justice to the people
S0212	yeah but my dad i think he be say that erm one of his friends work for like social service in yorkshire and she be say that like in one in ten households there's abuse and all this stuff and you're like okay england's go to shit
S0202	well you you like lose prophets right or you use to before all that come out well the two
S0212	i use to love them
S0202	the two erm women that be involve in it be from where i live
S0212	really
S0202	in yorkshire like they be gonna give them his six month their six old baby six month old baby so he could have sex with it
S0212	yeah
S0202	like how fuck in your head do you have to be
S0202	to do that like

S0212	mm
S0202	what if they have a kid again like
S0212	yeah
S0202	cos they don't have to go to hospital and tell someone they're pregnant they can just carry the term through cos if they know they're gonna get it take off off them by social service straight away then they just won't tell anyone will they
S0212	yeah
S0202	and then they're free to do it again

S0212	mm
S0202	benefit
S0212	unemployed yeah
S0202	benefit erm
S0212	mm mm mm
S0202	no it's not it's not
S0212	no it's fine
S0202	the same in france though be it
S0212	yeah
S0212	i just kind of like assume it be unemployed benefit
S0202	yeah benefit yeah
S0212	yeah
S0202	well you can be on benefit and then you can be on the dole if you're on benefit you're on benefit for a short amount of time because you're out of work if you're on the dole you've be on the you're on the on benefit because you don't want to work
S0212	yeah
S0202	and it's easy so them sort of people go there and polish cos they're look for cheap cheap house and stuff like that they go there as well but in january erm the charter that be on romanians and bulgarians be lift so
S0212	yeah i remember hear about that
S0202	romanians and bulgarians have be able to come into england and a lot of them have move to and there be actually er have you hear of edl before
S0212	ring a bell
S0202	it's a very racist party
S0212	oh yeah
S0202	yeah
S0202	yeah like bnp
S0202	edl er well
S0212	there's a lot of those party in england
S0202	yeah
S0212	but they're not as far right as that right
S0202	far leave or far right
S0212	yeah
S0202	it don't matter which
S0202	they're fuck racist anyway
S0212	yeah
S0202	so they do a march through because basically old women and like pensioners and like stuff like that and people daren't leave the house on their own
S0212	mm
S0202	or at at a certain time because these romanians be basically mug people and play loud music and just be like completely disrespectful to the area
S0212	mm
S0202	because it be a rough area but the
S0202	the people
S0202	it's it's their culture
S0202	it's their culture
S0212	oh
S0202	it's get nothing to do with the race at all
S0202	mm the culture be different to ours so like these people daren't leave their house at night like these pensioners and stuff who've live there their whole life
S0212	mm that's quite sad
S0202	and like people with baby and stuff like that daren't walk down the street er in daylight and it's just ridiculous and there's be stuff in paper about it and all that and the police aren't do anything
S0212	mm
S0202	so edl march down there and there be riot and it be just a fuck nightmare but it's the same in like romanians
