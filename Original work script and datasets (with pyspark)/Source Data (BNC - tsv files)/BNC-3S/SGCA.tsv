S0454	i didn't want to do a big shop there
S0455	no no but anyway it'd be handy if you run out
S0454	co op's not get the huge range
S0455	ah
S0454	i mean it's not a megastore cos i want to do one big shop
S0455	yes but anyway people have get you know you need some milk that probably
S0454	yes i mean that's all price match isn't it
S0455	yes it's good
S0454	mm mm lovely
S0455	i be tell i be an amaze person yesterday
S0454	oh by
S0455	no it's quite funny cos say that
S0454	do he tell everyone
S0455	once to me and i didn't know what she be on about cos we just think of ourselves as we be no we meet dad's friend the lady who the prison and her husband
S0454	oh yes she's in prison or
S0455	no no er he work with
S0454	yeah right
S0455	and we have a coffee after the swim and i start tell her about the coast path and cycle the hebrides different things and she she texted dad afterwards she say be amaze
S0454	oh that's nice
S0455	oh this be good so good to take
S0454	that's nice
S0455	i suppose it's my age isn't it and things like that
S0454	mm
S0455	be not many people quite
S0454	mm
S0452	your car's do forty three thousand
S0454	low isn't it
S0452	well yes mine's on seventy three
S0454	yes i must get it service though when i turn it on it say service now
S0455	oh do it
S0454	but it doesn't have any warn light on when i'm drive
S0452	no but that's
S0454	so i think it just you know they're clever aren't they they know
S0452	they would they would have set it that point to zero
S0454	mm
S0452	when it do the last service
S0454	mm
S0452	and it's obviously
S0454	so i think that's all it be but
S0452	yeah
S0454	i must do it anyway but it it sound fine remind me before i go fill up the water on the the windscreen wiper cos it's basically pure soap evaporate
S0454	it's go along and it's get more and more unclear but only because of the
S0452	foam or or just
S0454	no like soap like fairy look like fairy wash up liquid soap it's not foam it's actually dissolve soap but it's not clean it properly and i must just wash the screen properly cos it's all up the side
S0452	yes
S0454	i'll take it in and get the valet do but
S0455	yes it's probably
S0454	worth do yes
S0452	oh yes especially when it's
S0454	for the inside it's worth do isn't it
S0454	you can never get it the same with a hoover
S0455	no and even if you just have it
S0452	no
S0455	do the once
S0454	mm
S0455	and then do it yourself after that
S0452	be it self service valet or they do it
S0454	no proper
S0452	do it say the oh well it would do it's tesco
S0455	take grandpa's car to tesco's on the edge of er
S0452	yeah
S0455	and have it all do i she say it be about fifteen pound but she seem to think it be worth that
S0454	i think once cos you just can't get the seat right yourself
S0452	no
S0454	you can never do it
S0452	isn't it
S0455	and it be in a pretty bad state really wasn't it
S0452	upholstery
S0454	inside it need do properly
S0452	use upholstery erm sort of spray
S0454	i think there's no point do that until the service be do
S0452	no
S0454	they might get oil
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0454	i mean they try and be careful but
S0455	yes
S0452	yeah
S0455	see i don't think i tell you the story grandpa's dishwasher do i
S0454	no
S0455	erm it wasn't work so get to call them and take it away and then she get back and they have to ring me to say and she ring he say well it take me hours and hours he say erm to get it sort he say it be so clog up
S0454	oh really
S0455	he say i've never see a dishwasher like it
S0455	he say the only thing i can think of be that your father's be put wash powder in from the wash machine
S0454	oh no
S0455	instead of dishwasher tablets so anyway i check i don't think he have but of course when you're his age it be possible to do that because it's completely separate and the dishwashers tablet's in a seal packet and it's loose powder for the wash machine so i tell him and he say well i i don't know i don't think so but maybe i do
S0455	but anyway it's still work a month later
S0454	good funny
S0452	do he do the man have to do anything
S0455	he have to as least an hours
S0452	clean clean it
S0455	get it all out and he'd never meet anything in his work life like this
S0455	so i don't know what
S0454	oh dear
S0455	what else he's put in there
S0452	and that be the wash machine be it or
S0455	that be the dishwasher
S0452	that be the dishwasher
S0455	it be about a hundred and thirty pound but it be still cheaper than a lot of
S0454	yes
S0455	than buy it
S0454	oh dear
S0455	mm
S0452	yeah 's wash your wash machine cost what be it three hundred and fifty
S0454	a hundred and fifty new
S0455	your what
S0454	wash machine
S0455	ah yes so this be the dishwasher
S0454	dishwasher's probably more though
S0452	dishwasher be closer to three hundred
S0454	yeah
S0455	yes well that's
S0452	say two fifty on this
S0454	it's a lot isn't it
S0455	it be
S0454	wash machine that's very reasonable i think
S0455	yes
S0452	yes
S0454	actually a very good price but
S0452	i wouldn't feel bad if you know
S0454	no that last two years and it break i wouldn't feel bad about that
S0452	that would average out yes but it won't it'll last longer than that
S0455	the wash machine honestly it's a long i've forget what the average life be that's six or seven years but you might get longer than that
S0452	yeah they get better
S0454	that's very good mm
S0452	they've they've get better in the last ten years
S0454	yes that's very good yes things things do last here a long time they're expensive to buy but they do last longer than other countries i've notice that like we all drive
S0455	that's good
S0454	quite old cars here lot of people drive old cars they're fine they work and they're reliable
S0455	yes yes yes and your
S0454	they're build to last things like volkswagen they're very good
S0455	and your fridge freezer i mean that should last for years and years and years
S0454	yes that should last
S0452	yes
S0455	cos we throw out
S0454	yes
S0455	a chest freezer erm years ago but ten years but i don't think there's really anything wrong with it to be perfectly honest
S0454	no
S0455	you know i think we've go indefinitely with that sort of
S0454	yeah that's very good
S0455	it's good
S0452	it doesn't mean you won't have to you can do some bulk shop can't you
S0454	yes that's why i want a bigger one
S0455	yes
S0454	it's slightly too big but
S0454	yes in term of be able to freeze things that's useful
S0452	can you reach the top shelf
S0454	yes i mean that's fine for me
S0452	yeah
S0454	in term of be able to freeze stuff that be useful cos you can cook then
S0452	yes cos
S0454	two things at the weekend and freeze it
S0452	yes
S0454	and then not have to eat the same food over and over again
S0455	that's horrible
S0452	yes
S0454	cos that's horrible so you need some freezer space that you
S0455	yes
S0454	don't have to
S0452	and you can fill the fridge up with bottle can't you
S0454	that's what i think to make it full you can you know by the time you've buy
S0452	even if it's just
S0454	you know soft drink like can of
S0452	keep a few beers in there
S0454	yes exactly just permanently keep beer and
S0452	you know just to fill the space because and then it just
S0455	mm
S0454	and soft drink in there that actually take up a lot of room
S0455	yeah to stand things
S0454	yes
S0455	upright as well if you want
S0454	that's right
S0455	and you've have a big expense now but if you think about it you will never have an outlay like again
S0454	yes that's right
S0455	because you think in five or ten years time oh yeah perhaps i will have another settee but you won't be buy at the same time
S0454	no
S0452	three white goods at the same time
S0455	yeah
S0454	that's right no it it's a one off isn't it
S0455	it be and you see often you go into a house as well you and the carpet be already there you might pay extra or they might throw them in free so if you're not fussy
S0454	yes
S0455	then you don't have old next carpet
S0454	that's right
S0452	so if you move out of your house now cos of the particularly unique shape of those room they a bite
S0454	yes
S0452	lift them all up
S0454	yeah
S0452	and they won't fit the new place anyway
S0454	no there's no point be there
S0452	and then you often get to a new place and they decide to leave them there as part of the price
S0454	yes
S0455	yeah we've often have carpet that have just be there like here there's we do have to buy a lot but there's two or three previous ones
S0454	yes that's good
S0455	there be nothing wrong with it it's pointless have another one
S0454	no that's right you have this one do didn't you
S0455	yes and this be expensive so probably all last us forever to be honest
S0454	yes
S0455	and those carpet grandpa's get be live forty years
S0454	they've have those forever haven't they yes
S0455	there's nothing wrong with them they look really nice don't they
S0454	no they're good yes they're lovely
S0452	and they've have reasonable wear
S0455	yes they have
S0452	you know like in the bottom of the staircases where
S0455	yes
S0452	where everybody go on that one square yard
S0454	mm
S0452	erm well the doorway into the lounge it be gonna wear anywhere it would have wear there it's hold up extremely well cos it's a you know
S0454	yes
S0455	your postcode's nice and easy to remember cos you've see it
S0454	yes it's good isn't it
S0454	that's right i think that yes
S0454	yes
S0454	yes and yes it's a good one
S0455	yes
S0454	yes
S0455	no be
S0454	yes

S0454	oh that's good
S0455	which be good news so five pound six three
S0454	mm
S0455	so they normally put on an ounce a day so i be think that's an awfully long time before they get to a normal birth weight isn't it
S0454	yes
S0452	yeah
S0455	you know we're like a month when they be due originally
S0454	yes yes
