S0012	yeah
S0008	whatever the other one be the massive one
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah in the past twenty years they've explode haven't they
S0012	they have yeah they've er

S0008	it be
S0012	that's a big big surprise
S0008	well it's get the biggest population of any country hasn't it india have
S0012	mm
S0008	they overtake china recently
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er yeah when you think that their economy be everything from you know mud hut rural economy
S0012	that's right
S0008	you know people you know sort of die of starvation and no water no toilets no nothing no electric and then you get other bits of the economy where they're send you know orbiters around mar
S0012	that's right yeah yeah what be that about
S0008	and stuff like that
S0012	why do they do that though i mean it seem such a waste
S0008	well they reckon there's a lot of money and that's a well they do it you know where they say
S0012	to say we can
S0008	well no i mean america send an orbit around mar
S0012	yeah
S0008	which well go around there about a week after the indian one do
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it cost america two hundred and fifty billion dollars
S0012	yeah
S0008	and india do it for forty three million or something like that that's all it cost them
S0012	yeah that's amaze isn't it
S0008	you know and there's there's a hell of a lot of money to be make in space exploration activity there be
S0012	yeah well i suppose there be yeah
S0008	and i mean you look at yeah when the first telstar go round everything
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah it cost a fortune what what's the point of that you know
S0012	and all it go be
S0008	yeah and now you look gps
S0012	well yeah
S0008	yeah internet internet satellite
S0012	that's right
S0008	telephone satellite
S0013	mm
S0008	you know that be just make the economy explode
S0012	that be that be
S0008	you know i be say about the erm alibaba thing
S0012	yeah
S0008	well they reckon that in place like china and in africa they've completely cut out you know fix line telephone and stuff like that
S0012	that's yeah i
S0008	everything be do on a on a erm mobile phone
S0012	yeah and computers as well

S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	you know solar recharger and stuff
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and you know this all come from things like telstar programme
S0012	it do it have to didn't it yeah yeah
S0008	you know because if you didn't have the satellite none of this would happen
S0012	no
S0008	and they'd still be
S0012	wasn't that the russians that send the first one up though the sputnik weren't it
S0008	yeah sputnik be the first one wasn't it
S0012	yeah and then
S0008	i think telstar be the first radio wasn't it

S0008	probably the first electronic number one
S0012	yeah probably
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	well it's strange isn't it when you think it's sort of like step in
S0012	yeah
S0008	human invention
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know things what really change the world and you know like i mean radio erm not radio telephone do to a certain extent
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	all this wireless
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	my aunt i mean she's dead now she be ninety three when she die so she be bear in eighteen hundreds nine nineteen hundred no eighteen hundred and seventy five i think seventy five or something like she be bear
S0008	mm
S0012	and she say that she be live through the the world of invention
S0008	mm
S0012	and discovery and never have anybody anyone ever realise this sort of stuff because she saw the bicycle this be what she tell me i've see the bicycle and i've see the motor car and i've see the aeroplane
S0008	the aeroplane yeah
S0012	and now i've see the rocket how many more people can do that
S0013	mm
S0012	well you know when you think about what they saw and what we see
S0008	well that's right but they be all sort of very physical things aren't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	like the invention of the internet
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	be sort of fairly ethereal but that affect so many more things
S0012	that do
S0008	nowadays than you could possibly imagine even in even in ways that you don't think be in it's affect you but it do
S0012	it do it's
S0013	mm
S0012	it's affect everything hasn't it
S0008	mm i mean it's a bloody wonderful thing really
S0012	that be
S0008	but i mean even like the the useful things like be able to buy stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	without have to you know write a letter to some factory in birmingham which be the only supplier of this sort of particular
S0013	yeah
S0012	twenty eight days later you
S0008	yeah and all this sort of stuff you know and and er you know and and anything you need really anything at all you can buy on the internet can't you
S0012	yeah of course you can yeah yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know any sort of gizmo for anything you know
S0012	anything
S0008	erm if anything break down you can get it on the internet
S0012	yeah and anything you want to know
S0008	yeah that too
S0012	you can you can learn it on the internet
S0008	that that's like
S0012	anything
S0008	yeah
S0012	anything you want
S0008	well you see but the other things be though it's like affect politics and stuff like that as well
S0012	yeah that must be yeah
S0008	you know because there's like you can't hide anything nowadays
S0012	no you can't
S0008	governments can't hide anything
S0013	no
S0012	no
S0008	because there's someone out there who'll be
S0013	mm
S0008	even you know especially since smartphones
S0012	mm
S0008	there's someone now just instantly stick it
S0012	on on facebook or whatever
S0008	yeah on twitter or something like that
S0012	on social media
S0008	and people get to know about it you know
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	there's absolutely no cover up any more
S0012	no there isn't there can't be
S0008	and er this go together with the sort of propaganda stuff as well doesn't it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but people can bring out propaganda
S0013	yeah
S0008	and that that go everywhere instantly
S0012	instantly yeah
S0008	whether it's true or not
S0012	yeah yeah yeah that that that be one
S0013	but then you can come back on it again can't you and say no you're wrong
S0012	that's another thing they can do isn't it i mean
S0008	yeah
S0012	you say this in nineteen fifty three and we have proof you know cos all these record that
S0008	yeah that's right but it's the same like when the trouble be there's so much rubbish on the internet as well
S0012	well of course there be
S0008	cos you know you get every
S0012	you just have a
S0008	tom dick and harry give their opinion on something
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and so you have to really but i mean if you get a mass movement on something
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	it's quite powerful
S0012	that be quite powerful
S0008	i mean like you be say you know there be these people donate a million quid to the dogs' home
S0012	yeah just like that yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	just cos they're you know like it's not like someone donate a million quid there's hundreds of thousands of people donate a fiver or a quid even or even
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	that's that's really strange because you know when we be kid all we have be the newspapers
S0008	that's right
S0012	to know what have happen but mostly you only know what have happen in your local area didn't you
S0008	mm
S0012	i mean the the news the newspapers come out with some murder victim or whatever
S0008	mm
S0012	and but in your local area be it be real big news if someone nick something from the co op or something like that
S0008	that's right
S0012	and that would be plaster across the headline you know and i know i know a lady who take a a quarter of a pound of ninety nine tea from the shop and she get nine months in holloway
S0008	oh really
S0012	nine months in holloway
S0008	bloody hell

S0008	mm
S0012	and er she get do nine months
S0008	and be there a protest
S0012	huh
S0008	be there a protest
S0012	well there weren't they just say oh dear oh dear oh dear i mean she be ridicule more or less

S0013	the suspend sentence
S0012	it will cost about eight hundred quid a month er a week to keep a prisoner in there
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	what they should have be use up all the all the ex rig that don't work any more

S0012	they've still them out there just stick them on there with a fish line you get on with your life
S0008	yes
S0013	he's hard
S0008	what they should do be like inside the prison have these great big poison areas with incinerators you know when people go to prison just like do away with them and then shut the door and forget about them
S0012	oh crikey
S0008	and no one would know
S0012	this be hitler talk oh dear now that be even more radical than what i be say weren't it
S0008	yeah but they i mean even
S0013	just give them porridge every day
S0008	even now they send far too many people to prison
S0012	course they do for no reason at all half of them

S0013	yeah
S0012	that make you wonder if all that work we do when we be thirty and forty and that
S0008	mm
S0012	whether that wear you up quicker
S0008	yeah
S0012	physical work wear up joint well that's what what the quack tell me once wear and tear
S0008	joint they're the bone doesn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you would have think your body would have be able to cope with that
S0012	you would
S0013	mm
S0008	but i think like get back to this idea of like development of the human body cos in the past when people use to work hard well not so many years ago either probably about a hundred years ago people you know would work hard but they'd be dead at just over sixty
S0012	they would wouldn't they
S0008	wouldn't they
S0012	they would
S0008	and it's only when they when you get to you know and your obviously your body hadn't develop the idea of preserve the joint beyond sixty because there's no need for it
S0012	that's right no no and this be why pension now have go through
S0008	well this be why it sort of make it sort of ridiculous pension i mean these people who devise that you know you have to be what have it go up to seventy two or something like that
S0012	something like that yeah
S0008	or seventy four even perhaps i don't know
S0012	i don't know something like that yeah
S0008	increase you know the the the age at which people can retire the people decide that be all people who have spend their life sit in an office
S0012	course it be yeah yeah
S0008	you know none of these people have do any hard work
S0012	they don't know what hard work be do they
S0008	but if you imagine if you start work at eighteen now
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you're work like as a brickie
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you're still try to lay bricks when you're seventy five
S0013	oh dear
S0012	yeah
S0008	oh it's impossible they say oh well then they can do admin job oh yeah there ain't that many admin job
S0012	no of course there aren't
S0008	around they'd just be just be out of work
S0012	there's also minors and people like that ain't there
S0008	well that's right i mean not so many minors these days
S0012	no but there be some
S0008	well people work in in er merchant ship and stuff like that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and fish
S0012	yeah fish look at that yeah
S0008	you know i mean they say oh well there's old so and so he's in his eighties he'll still go out crab you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you know you know he's go through the motion but he ain't actually do anything
S0012	no no that's true he'd go out
S0008	he ain't earn he ain't earn a live
S0012	on his boat don't they yeah yeah yeah that's that's weird isn't it
S0008	yeah don't know how that's go to pan out
S0012	wow it won't will it who's go to work at that age where be the work come from
S0008	well even know you know when you know you know you you get a pension at sixty five you're either out of work at sixty
S0012	yeah
S0008	no one's go to give you a job be they
S0012	course they aren't no
S0008	unless you sort of do a bite of odd job in garden or
S0012	yeah that's right
S0013	mm
S0008	or diying or something like that you don't
S0012	or stack shelve somewhere in middle of the night that would be different at least
S0008	mm but then they've get kid to do that haven't they
S0012	teenagers do that don't they they stay up all night anyway
S0013	yeah
S0008	i suppose you'd get a you get a job push the trolleys back in tesco's

S0008	no preparation no mark
S0012	no
S0008	you just go there sit with this girl for so many hours come home and that's it forget about it
S0012	oh wow that's
S0008	you know what i mean
S0012	no stress then
S0008	that's right although she do have it bad in the class and that and there be a possibility she could do a day's teach there
S0012	oh that will be handy
S0008	yeah cos she's frantically search for money
S0012	what
S0008	yeah well she chuck in college you see
S0012	of course she do yeah
S0008	so she hasn't get that any more and her maths class have be cancel well one of them she do two maths class
S0012	yeah
S0008	and one of them have be cancel and the other one have only get five people in when there should be twelve or something
S0012	twelve yeah that's right
S0008	and she say i don't know how long that's go to last but she do have this job mark right and it be mark overseas gcse paper for gcse art
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	and er it be like seven days straight off you know do these you have to go and mark all these paper cos they all have to be mark within a certain like time limit
S0012	yeah of course they do yeah
S0008	between hand in and
S0012	that be stressful
S0008	and er well the trouble be she sort of work say oh yeah think she sort of realise she'd have a about i forget how many minutes something like eight minutes for each paper
S0012	ouch
S0008	right to make any money and er to mark these they all have you know art portfolios to you know a discussion with someone else all this sort of erm what do you call it a sketch book and they all have to be assess in a proper mark give in eight minutes
S0012	wow
S0013	mm
S0012	no way
S0008	and she say right when she's mark at college that would take all even to mark something like that
S0012	course it would
S0008	you know properly
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean i say well you know it's only gcse you know it's hardly a rigorous standard
S0012	no
S0008	you know what i mean it's like o level and that i mean surely when you mark she wouldn't take anything i say into account anyway but i sort of say well surely if you just sort of flick through it you can make an assessment of how good they be
S0012	yeah i suppose you can you could yeah
S0008	you know and like you know you only need to read a little bite of the final essay or whatever they write or the conclusion to see if they'd actually use any of the
S0012	cos that's why they've eight minutes to do
S0008	that's right
S0012	because they they can do that i mean it's obviously be time sort you know
S0008	mm
S0012	a time in motion study
S0008	yeah
S0012	on the paper itself and well lot of people have get these this this fast read
S0008	that's right and it will also i mean i'm just i mean it's always subjective anyway
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you'd be able to tell if someone's take any care over it or
S0012	well of course you would yeah
S0008	you know get decent sketch book or you just sort of flick through and check this check that oh right you know and
S0012	yeah
S0008	what grade oh c
S0012	yeah
S0013	she didn't have to write any comment either
S0008	erm
S0013	cos that would take time wouldn't it
S0008	i don't know i mean
S0013	right
S0008	but anyway she be all set for this and apparently you could earn good money at this because they pay you really good expense and all this sort of stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it be in in er erm
S0012	oh what
S0013	oh so she hasn't do any of it
S0008	so she'd have to drive to
S0013	oh
S0008	work there
S0013	right
S0012	and drive all the way back
S0008	all day and then drive home again
S0013	oh
S0012	oh that's too much isn't it
S0008	and then
S0012	god
S0008	two of these days she'd then have to teach in the even when she get home
S0012	oh well
S0013	oh
S0012	but you would think that
S0008	and like
S0013	i think you mean she'd get the job
S0008	well she have get the job but she have to turn it down she's sort of like weigh it all up
S0013	but she's not do it
S0008	but i mean honestly she's go to like today
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	she's get to drive home and teach this even
S0012	yeah
S0008	she fall asleep come back from she's sort of like you know doze off in the car and hardly keep her eye open
S0013	oh dear
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know and then get home and then she can sort of get enough time to make some soup and then she go out and do maths
S0013	mm oh that's
S0008	and so what you know this be what i be think you can't do that and drive back from
S0013	you can't
S0012	no
S0008	cos you know the thing be that i say to her if you be go to do it what you could do be to stay down there in some cheap
S0012	hotel yeah
S0008	you know hotel
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then you could work longer hours and just go to the hotel have something to eat go to kip get up and do it again
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then she say oh yeah that's what i be think of but that would cost forty quid a night
S0012	that would cost forty at least wouldn't it yeah
S0008	and you know even if you get a deal you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	which you probably could do but forty quid a night that's not forty quid you're go to get in your pocket be it it's
S0012	no no
S0013	no probably probably that in petrol though isn't it
S0008	erm
S0013	there and back
S0008	no i think that be sixty miles each way so
S0013	suppose you wouldn't have to do it again
S0012	well a hundred and twenty mile you can do that
S0008	no it would be a couple of gallons at least
S0012	that would only be a couple of gallons
S0008	probably with three gallons alright two two and a half three
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	but they yeah but i mean the thing be it's a you know she's sort of
S0013	it's not worth it
S0008	cos her friend do it you see
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	but some people even when they get quite old can drive can't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean i can remember when i use to have to drive all over the place
S0012	all over the place yeah
S0008	you know when i be work at i mean that be a fair track back to
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er i use to take that time to wind down from work
S0012	yeah
S0008	i use to find it quite relax
S0012	yeah
S0008	sort of drive back you know and the time sort of totally wind up work by the time you get home again you're sort of like okay again you know
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and er but ain't like that
S0012	no
S0008	she find drive a you know sort of a chore
S0012	yeah and she get bore
S0008	like today she can't keep keep awake
S0013	she can't share the lift with her friend
S0008	well no i don't think that her friend come from the other side of or somewhere
S0012	oh and she still have to drive quite a way anyway
S0008	that's right yeah but even then get back in time to go to work
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	no it doesn't sound very good though do it
S0008	no
S0012	no it doesn't no
S0008	yeah well i yeah i i think i suggest that
S0013	i wouldn't do it
S0008	no it's not worth it
S0013	i know i wouldn't do it
S0008	it's really not worth
S0012	no it isn't be it
S0008	it's the sort of thing you can do when you're young
S0013	i don't like the drive too far anyway
S0008	mm

S0008	really
S0013	it come up all the time
S0012	do it
S0013	to ask question yeah
S0012	oh
S0013	if you want to
S0008	if you put a query in you always get a wikipedia answer don't you
S0013	there all there's always something
S0012	be it oh
S0013	once you put in oranges it will come up wikipedia oranges be
S0008	well i don't mind wikipedia actually it's usually get some sort of information on long dead people
S0012	oh it's get information
S0008	or something like that or
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but it's it's feed by the social media isn't it you know people can put it on
S0008	yeah well not any more they can't
S0012	isn't there they can't do it any more
S0008	no
S0012	oh
S0008	no well be say they're try to cut it down
S0012	oh right
S0008	and like the people who be sort of start it up and be keen on it i mean you're talk about fifty thousand around the world
S0012	yeah
S0008	members of wikipedia they sort of do a probably more than fifty thousand it would have to be they do like a when you put some information in well they they can run their eye over it
S0012	oh i see
S0008	and er before that it doesn't go straight in any more
S0012	no
S0008	at one time it use to go straight in
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos do that she didn't realise what she get wikipedia up and she be sort of cut and paste some information out of it and so she be sort of like more or less sort of you know cut this bite out and amend it and something like that and so next time she look it have all be change change on the page
S0012	oh right
S0008	yeah but i don't think happen any more i think you have to submit it and then
S0012	no i see
S0008	you know they will sort of check it out
S0012	it's all check by load and load of people
S0008	well no sort of one person who just sort of look and think a bite
S0012	oh i see
S0008	look roughly but what they do be like all the facts what they like to have be a some sort of reference right
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos of the cos everything on there have get a little number by it and then underneath be a massive great where this information come from
S0012	come from i see
S0008	you see
S0012	yeah i see
S0008	so if you say david cameron get fin you know two pound ten for shop lift when he be twelve
S0012	they'd have to find out whether it be true or not
S0008	they'd look at that and they'd verify it you know check that
S0012	yeah
S0008	they wouldn't just let it go in
S0012	no no because that would be wrong
S0008	that's right but it be like the whole idea be good isn't it
S0012	yeah it be good that's brilliant yeah
S0008	i mean when you look up it would have load of information about in it

S0008	there be this super offer and he work it all out and get there and it be go to cost him more than it than normal
S0012	be it
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh of course the the funny thing about that them photo book be you can have a photo book for say twenty quid and that will give you like twenty six page
S0008	mm
S0012	but these offer ones be sixty page
S0008	mm
S0012	and they cost an or a hundred page aren't they
S0013	yeah can be
S0012	they're on offer special offer photo book for x amount whatever it be
S0008	mm
S0012	and then you've get to look at it and there's sixty page well it take an awful lot of photograph to fill in
S0013	well it's about three time the price isn't to compensate yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	no i think this particular offer that be talk about he say it be some offer where if you register right
S0012	yeah
S0008	you would get a discount tokens
S0012	ah yeah and you have to pay in advance
S0008	every time you you get these you know have a book
S0012	yeah
S0013	right
S0008	and as he be go to do this christmas run he think well i'll do that you know get a bite off
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then he it all work out and it come out more expensive
S0012	oh dear
S0013	oh
S0012	that's pathetic
S0008	mm
S0012	cos you can have a you can have a photos print at say
S0008	mm
S0012	er six by six by four photo frame for around about ten pence each
S0008	mm
S0012	which be pretty cheap but you have to buy an enormous amount to get them for that you know
S0008	that's right yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah but them photo book i mean they're quite good you know they're quite reasonable quality
S0012	they be yeah
S0008	but i think they're overprice for what they
S0012	they be yeah
S0008	when you consider it's like i'll bet you there's nobody the only person in a factory there be the person who's pack them up and post them
S0012	yeah probably yeah yeah
S0008	you know it probably come with a pre print stick or in a bag that's the right size and they just put them in a bag put the sticker on chuck them out
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	yeah yeah
S0008	cos i think there's totally automate process
S0012	that must be yeah
S0008	and you know when you think about the volume they actually use
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know they must have pay for them machine a hundred time over
S0012	they must have do now yeah
S0008	you know
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos the thing be be that it you know they look fairly good but the actual hard cover be nothing special be it
S0012	no
S0008	you know what i mean
S0012	well you can pay for the you pay extra for certain cover
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah but i mean that's only different sort of sort of material or fabric or something like that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but you know the actual you know cos i be look at the stuff which like the arts college
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they've get their own sort of bookbinding thing
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0008	but in in the sort of final year exhibitions you know quite a few people partly think it's to make a book
S0012	yeah
S0008	of the design and the
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	especially in the the clothe bite or whatever it be textile bite
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and you look at them and they're really good quality bind on them book
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	you know they be really well do
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm right
S0008	and i don't think they pay
S0012	but you won't them for to last don't you if you're go to pay that sort of money for them
S0013	yeah you do
S0008	that's right yeah
S0012	i mean that's no good have a bind that's go to fall to bits
S0008	that's right
S0013	yeah
S0012	after a few usages you know i think
S0008	well i be think of put you know get a photo album and just print picture of and put them in right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i've start print picture and i'm sort of look for you know just like the you use to get like a book you know when you open it and it's you know you can put your photos in that
S0012	that's it you do yeah
S0008	well i tell you what you you know you use to get them for next to nothing didn't you
S0012	yeah yeah and now they're
S0008	they're properly expensive now if you can get them
S0012	yeah
S0008	i be i be absolutely
S0012	we have
S0008	you know really surprise how how difficult it be to actually find a photo book
S0013	right
S0008	for your picture
S0013	to put your photos in
S0012	we have a photo book right to put your picture in which have cellophane cover on the picture
S0008	mm yeah
S0013	yeah there be a sticky band kind of a sticky
S0008	yeah that's right but they're fairly rubbish aren't they
S0012	but they after a time the cellophane stick to the photograph
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	and you couldn't take it off and they and rip all of it off
S0008	mm
S0012	ruin all the picture
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah the best ones be those sort of little plastic things where you just slot them in
S0013	yeah you want those slot in ones
S0012	yeah where you just slide the side in yeah
S0013	so they're not damage at all and you can
S0008	that's right
S0012	yeah
S0013	check them
S0008	i mean i've get a couple of little ones which be sort of flip book
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know them sort of smaller just sort a4 size and they've get you know your flip you know
S0012	yeah that's it yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	they they're pretty practical but you know they not not quite as good as the book that way
S0012	no no
S0008	you know cos a book you open that way
S0012	that's right
S0008	and you've get a space to put a little bite of information in there as well about what the picture be actually about you know
S0012	and they have yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	now they have all different type of book some book you you can open and you can't see it cos that open and that don't lay flat now they have lay flat book
S0008	oh right
S0013	oh yeah photobox do them don't they for an extra
S0012	and photobox do that as an extra
S0008	oh right
S0013	they do lot of things as extras
S0012	so you know you don't you don't want a book like like a an ordinary paper back that you have to push down to read round the corner
S0013	start off
S0008	right
S0012	of the
S0013	or to spoil your photo
S0012	to and that spoil the photo you know
S0008	they could do a spiral bind couldn't they
S0012	well they do spiral bound now which be lay what what they call lay flat book which be more expensive you see
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	but some spiral book bind book get stick halfway and then then they wear wear away and
S0008	yeah bits fall out
S0012	and bits fall out yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	the best thing be put them in a book and never use it
S0012	that's it
S0013	that's it
S0012	that's it
S0013	the answer
S0008	anyway
S0013	yeah
S0012	i think the best thing be be to
S0013	that's a turk's head
S0008	yeah
S0013	would you like one to try
S0012	do you want one
S0008	no i'm not
S0013	no this be this wasn't ripe but
