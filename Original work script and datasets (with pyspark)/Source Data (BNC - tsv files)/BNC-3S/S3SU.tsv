S0110	it's sort of a bite seventies
S0104	yeah
S0110	it's something that people use to go when they use to go on holiday to spain you know
S0104	hand in hand with babycham
S0110	yeah it's a spanish thing isn't it
S0104	mm
S0110	people use to go to majorca for a holiday it's
S0104	mm
S0167	be you gonna drink your tea or
S0104	i be
S0167	i be
S0104	it's a bite hot at the moment to be honest
S0167	i be
S0104	i be
S0167	i be ah
S0104	so be worry then that he couldn't get in touch with anyone
S0110	er he's well i dunno ring him up
S0104	no can't be no it's no point i can only ring him on viber when he's at mum's cos he's get no internet at the house
S0167	at
S0104	mm
S0167	they don't have internet be that a conscious thing or have they just not go round to
S0110	ah
S0104	well i think for the amount of time they're down there time they're down there it's not worth it
S0167	it's not worth it mm
S0104	yeah
S0110	i'd say that's do now but how much do you want of it
S0167	i'll have half for now and then maybe go back
S0104	and also if they're go down there for a fortnights holiday it's actually quite nice to be cut off the internet
S0167	yeah
S0104	and not
S0167	i say to when you go away place what do you do with er i keep call him and she go we put him in kennel
S0104	mm
S0167	and i say yeah that's normal isn't it and erm and say oh but my sister take her dog everywhere it's really annoy
S0104	mm it be really annoy i don't understand them
S0167	no cos i think maybe that's just what people do maybe it's just me be fussy but yeah it's not just me
S0104	i know mind you i think partly it's it's the expense with and but
S0167	well yeah
S0104	but for something like over the christmas period i don't think they would have even consider it whereas also you know cos and they wouldn't dream of go unless they be go on a specific holiday that they book with the dog in mind
S0167	yeah
S0104	you know hire a cottage or something but i mean they've
S0167	i mean that's their own thing
S0104	well yeah yeah that's fine she have a great time at it's their own house and
S0167	yeah but i think maybe that's just what people do with dog and i'm just be naïve but obviously not
S0104	i just think if you're go to stay in other people's house to say oh can i bring my dog be you know it's cos i'm pretty sure in the position where oh yes
S0167	you can't say no
S0104	yeah but it it's a huge you know if you're a person who hasn't get dog it's a massive adaptation especially when you've get cat and the dog keep try to eat them
S0167	oh she try to
S0104	and actually completely ignore the cat this time didn't she
S0167	do she usually not
S0104	she be a bite chasey during the summer she use to chase them out the cat flap quite a lot
S0110	ah
S0167	maybe she's just
S0104	but i genuinely don't think would have hurt them if
S0167	she's a bite too small to hurt them anyway she couldn't really
S0104	yeah but i i seriously think she would i don't think she'd you know
S0110	play
S0104	disagree with me but i i she's not evil she's a dog and she's a terrier and terriers be
S0110	evil mm
S0104	and she's not use to cat and she's aggressive towards them
S0167	's sister's get marry again
S0104	again why be she divorce
S0167	well no she's be with this guy for about ten years
S0104	mm
S0167	and they they be engage when be about sixteen she be really excite cos she be gonna be a bridesmaid
S0104	oh i remember then it all split up
S0167	and and then well they didn't split up but 's sister just decide she didn't wanna get marry any more and it be like she'd get the dress every like everything be all
S0104	mm
S0167	she decide she didn't wanna get marry so they break up the engagement but they be still together and now they're get marry their engagement
S0104	so be gonna be bridesmaid again
S0167	well she say she say be be a bite funny cos she hasn't ask her to be bridesmaid she didn't even tell their mum
S0104	oh
S0167	until it just kind of pop up in conversation and apparently her
S0104	perhaps it's just go to be a really small affair
S0167	maybe but i mean her mum didn't even know and apparently her mum only find out out of fluke and then she and now she's really upset and angry
S0104	ah
S0167	and then say oh cos the the little niece she say oh so you're have as a flower girl and she go oh i hadn't even think about that so it sound like she's just it it's all very strange don't you think
S0104	flower girl don't ever say flower girl please
S0110	why
S0104	it's american we don't have flower girls in this country we have bridesmaids
S0110	that's not the same thing
S0104	in america yeah in america they have bridesmaids and the little girl who walk be the flower girl
S0110	yeah alright
S0167	yeah
S0104	we don't have that in this country
S0167	i'm just tell you a story that say
S0104	no please don't use americanisms in this house
S0167	we don't do that in this family do we
S0167	we're not anti american but we just don't we just hate anything american
S0104	no it's not that it's just that our language be become americanise by the day
S0167	i don't see i don't see the issue
S0104	mm no i don't with a lot of things but erm
S0110	like flower girls
S0167	if your
S0104	no i mean things like movies i don't like movies i i don't but yeah no no i do i i find it that annoy i don't find it annoy that things be change because of texting because that's kind of natural but i find it annoy when we use americanisms cos that's pure copy
S0167	so i copy from french if i say déjà vu you wouldn't tell me not to say it
S0104	well no cos that's a sort of french expression that's sort of
S0167	that's consider it's consider more high class to speak french than american
S0104	no it's but anglicise isn't it it's just it's just a sort of anglicise expression
S0110	and it sound nicer
S0104	be the buzzer go
S0110	hm
S0167	anyway erm i don't know how we get onto the story of
S0104	no it's cos you say flower girl
S0167	well yes cos that's what say
S0167	erm yeah and so i don't really know what er
S0104	be upset
S0167	she's not upset but she's like she better be have me as a bridesmaid
S0104	ah
S0167	but it seem a bite strange she wouldn't tell her mum but maybe she just forget cos she's be engage before to the same man she forget she be engage again
S0104	be she still really shy
S0167	yeah
S0110	be she you look at me then
S0104	i do not
S0110	be she be she really shy
S0167	yeah
S0104	not with you though
S0167	no obviously not with us just with people
S0104	so do you have a really good time anyway at the pub
S0167	yeah it be quite good we arrive about nine
S0104	mm
S0167	and then we just have a drink sit down with some drink for about an hour while the place fill up
S0104	mm
S0167	and erm we go to the dance floor and dance for about two hours we wait for the countdown and then we leave say that we're old losery grannies
S0104	what cos you leave early why do you leave early
S0167	we just have enough of dance
S0110	and you go to the chip shop didn't you and get sausage and chip
S0167	er huh
S0104	cor i'll tell you what if you get the chance to have a look on the internet
S0110	i will
S0104	look at the london the fireworks last night
S0167	yeah i bet they be good
S0104	it's amaze
S0167	the thing be that always put me off go to london be that hotel price be
S0104	yeah
S0167	probably i mean i'm sure you could find cheaper ones but
S0104	it be erm anyway it's ten quid a head now and on principle i don't think i'd want to pay that
S0110	yeah but it's for safety reason
S0104	yeah i know exactly
S0110	and do you see the chinese one
S0167	yeah
S0104	no oh yeah little bite
S0167	oh thirty thirty six people die
S0104	yeah
S0110	because of
S0104	overcrowd
S0110	overcrowd
S0104	yes but i mean it's never happen in london before have it there's people go up every year for the sort of
S0167	yeah but apparently it be get bigger and bigger
S0110	yeah
S0167	apparently last year there be five hundred thousand people there
S0104	be there
S0167	mm
S0110	i think their safety thing be an issue but obviously they're gonna make some money out of it
S0104	mm
S0167	yeah
S0167	although i don't think a tenner i mean it could be a lot more
S0104	i suppose a tenner isn't too bad but i just look at the thousands and thousands of people and i think true i know the fireworks will have cost a pretty penny
S0167	mm hm
S0104	but i can't see that they cost however many tens of thousands
S0167	well a hundred thousand people there time ten ten hundred thousand what's that i can't work out so there's seven noughts no hundred so six a million pound they make in just the entrance fee
S0104	yeah be there be there a hundred thousand be that
S0167	they sell a hundred thousand ticket yeah
S0110	i think it's quite good
S0104	but could you stand in there presumably you could stand outside the barriered area for nothing
S0167	i guess so i guess they can't stop that
S0104	yeah i would have do that but no it be they they be they go on for about fifteen minutes they be absolutely spectacular
S0110	yeah i do see them on the news this morning
