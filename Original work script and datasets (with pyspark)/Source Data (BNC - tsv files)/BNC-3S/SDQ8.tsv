S0653	okay tell me again what you be say about how much go to spain cost
S0655	well i think the house cost a thousand pound and i think
S0653	cost cost not cost
S0655	how be cost not a word
S0653	just isn't a word
S0655	really
S0653	yeah
S0655	huh
S0653	er it cost a thousand pound for the holiday do it
S0655	yeah
S0653	mm well as i say the thing be you won't know whether that be it probably be the flight and the accommodation where you be stay but what people forget about holiday be that you also want to have a bite of spend money cos you're go to be buy food out there and you want to enjoy yourself
S0654	we didn't need to buy food
S0653	mm
S0654	we didn't need to buy food
S0655	yes we do we go to the shop and it be boil and i need to sit next to the freezer
S0654	yeah we actually have to go in the car and wait our car be so cool
S0653	who be in the car with you
S0653	mm
S0654	granny
S0653	mm
S0654	uncle auntie dad me and
S0653	no no but who stay in the car with you when they go shop
S0655	dad
S0653	really
S0654	yeah
S0653	he get to go out get out of shop
S0655	yeah
S0654	he say we be get too hot and he have to stay with us
S0653	in the shop you be get too hot
S0655	yeah
S0653	be it not air condition in the shop
S0654	well erm
S0653	wow
S0655	i well normally shop aren't air condition it's cos the people in spain be pretty much use to it there
S0653	but as you know the money for the sound record that we're do even the one right now be towards go towards our holiday in
S0654	mm
S0653	and erm i think it's very expensive in normally but i manage to find a a really nice house for us for a week and er
S0654	we saw that house
S0653	sorry
S0654	we saw it
S0653	you've see it haven't you it's very pretty might be able to come and spend a couple of days with us although
S0655	how much do it cost
S0653	right well i think it cost something like four hundred pound for the week
S0653	which be very very good i mean but normally i wouldn't be able to afford it at all but what i'm say be cos you be say oh well you know we could go to spain or something but the thing be not only have we get to pay i mean i've pay some money already towards the house
S0654	yeah
S0653	that we're go to live in for a week but i need to pay the rest of it but i need to make sure we've get enough money set aside for for food when we go there
S0655	and for souvenirs
S0653	and er yeah souvenirs and ice cream and you know one of those meals that we have at least will be hopefully fish and chip so i'm not constantly slave in the kitchen like i do normally
S0653	so it's important that and also the petrol cos it's a really long way to go to from here i mean probably the petrol alone will be about a hundred pound i reckon
S0655	woah
S0654	also mum
S0653	mm
S0654	erm
S0655	be it further than to wales
S0653	erm yes in term of where we're go yeah er yeah definitely i'll have to show you a map

S0653	mm hetty feather be quite sad we'll get some up it'd be nice actually to to hear harry potter six
S0655	huh booya
S0653	we would definitely
S0653	sorry
S0654	in the car we could make a story
S0653	mm
S0654	and then listen it we'll listen to it
S0653	mm what you mean record a story yourselves
S0654	yes and we can listen to it
S0653	mm
S0654	and then we can have and then we can have erm something like the we be watch about the kind of frog prince

S0653	mm
S0654	that be a that be a cliffhanger
S0653	it be a cliffhanger
S0654	i want to know what happen
S0653	mm i don't think i don't see how i could record you make a story whilst i be drive but erm
S0655	finish please can i get down
S0653	no
S0653	erm but we'll definitely pick some good audio cds
S0654	yeah
S0653	i think it will take about eight hours of drive
S0654	and er and also erm if we leave very early in the morning
S0653	yeah
S0654	like we could stop at erm
S0653	we don't need to no we don't need to get up in the middle of the night cos i would be too tire to drive anyway

S0655	yeah like this
S0654	wake us up quite early we can pack some book well i can i'm really upset that 's like car sick
S0653	i know but that's
S0654	cos it make the drive so bore for him

S0654	yeah
S0653	cos we can all listen to them then
S0654	can we take a toy
S0653	yeah but the thing be because it's self cater when we get there we'll be able to save a lot of money on kind of food because we'll make pack lunch and we'll have breakfast at at the house and everything

S0654	mum should we erm
S0653	yep
S0654	pack our pillow because we might be still a bite tire
S0653	yeah and do you know what that's a great idea and also because we're not go camp we'll have lot of room in the car because we have so much stuff to take last time

S0653	to take a little bite longer
S0654	six add
S0653	well it's two more hours to go to
S0654	two equal eight
S0653	mm
S0654	so
S0655	we only have four hours when we get there but
S0654	if we set off early we will
S0655	that depend er wait
S0653	hang on a minute what do you mean we've get four hours when we get there

S0653	what be you gonna say
S0655	i be gonna say that if we erm get off at four in the morning then we would erm then it would be night time by the time we get there
S0653	well that's not true at all be it if you leave at four o'clock in the middle of the the morning like really early then you would still be there in the afternoon but we'll set off about nine o'clock okay then we'll probably have a bite of a break at lunchtime
S0655	what
S0653	so like four hours in one o'clock so we'll have maybe er an hour's break because it's actually quite tire to drive
S0654	yeah and just like stop at er somewhere

S0654	but also mum
S0653	mm
S0654	at dad's house it'd be smaller than that er it actually only have four room a bathroom

S0653	i saw a very funny thing on facebook last night it say there be a post that say maybe if i start shout get your shoe on now
S0653	their children might be ready in time tomorrow so there's this idea that on a sunday night
S0653	you would start say get your shoe on
S0653	and maybe just maybe the children would do it and i think oh that's familiar
S0655	i be gonna do it
S0653	mm
S0654	if you do i'll just go in slow motion like
S0653	no but it do show you that children just go into some weird time vortex where
S0653	they just don't do anything suspend animation
S0655	we go in the tardis
S0653	i be gonna follow you one of these mornings just to see what you do
S0653	when i allow you to go off and brush your teeth for example and then i come up five minutes later and then you're just go to get your toothbrush and i think what have you be do for the last five minutes and then equally i'm brush my teeth and i'm wait for you to get your shoe on and i come down and you're both usually stand in the live room look in the mirror
S0653	but neither of you have your shoe on or you haven't put your pack lunch in your bag and i'm think but what have you be do the last five minutes yeah what be it that you do
S0655	children stuff
S0653	children stuff yeah
S0654	mm
