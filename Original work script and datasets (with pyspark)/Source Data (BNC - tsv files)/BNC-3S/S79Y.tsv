S0110	you'd just call it and then him in it and you can have it and it would be a huge hit

S0110	and then of course people would think oh what a cute kid and that you know by the end of the first series
S0104	but they'd also be laugh at him

S0104	what a lovely world to live in
S0167	i know
S0104	but then again he have no well i don't think anyway he he hasn't get any lovely memories to hold cos as you say he live in the moment what's go be go he doesn't
S0167	but he doesn't need memories he doesn't think oh damn it i wish i have some memories
S0104	no cos memories help us learn and he doesn't need to cos everybody else do it for him

S0104	yeah
S0167	that's what he like to do
S0104	why have you just take away my little where you
S0167	she's actually purr into the microphone

S0167	oh that's cute because it
S0104	nudge my arm with her wet nose
S0167	that's cute because it mean she want another stroke
S0104	oh no it's like dribble on me wipe her nose on me they've get some kind of salivary problem these cat just doesn't do any of that she just sort of sit there and like be stroke but i don't i don't i just push them off sometimes cos i don't want to be dribble on or wipe on
S0167	i be erm listen to the jeremy vine show and they do this piece about erm female genital mutilation
S0104	that's nasty
S0167	apparently it's be illegal for thirty years but erm
S0104	where
S0167	here in this country
S0104	have it be it ever legal
S0167	well i don't think there be ever a specific law against it obviously the act of
S0104	i suppose it be
S0167	butcher someone be
S0104	yeah
S0167	i mean
S0104	i suppose people weren't really aware of it for a long time
S0167	exactly yeah
S0104	yeah anyway yeah
S0167	erm but there's be more pressure lately to actually start take the law seriously and actually start bring people to court and erm charge people
S0104	oh why have nobody ever be prosecute over here
S0167	no one's ever be prosecute
S0104	yeah
S0167	or investigate and apparently it happen to like thousands of girls every year in the uk
S0104	really
S0167	not by doctor necessarily like most of the time by you know family members or
S0104	mm
S0167	and stuff like that erm but there be this man's be buy to court be bring to court and he's be acquit and the question on jeremy vine be whether this be have ruin the campaign against kind of fgm and
S0104	mm
S0167	and bring people to justice because he be bring to he be bring to court because erm this woman have a baby and her she'd have it do when she be six she come into hospital
S0104	oh god
S0167	and she be bleed
S0104	i think they have it do in their teens
S0167	well this girl this woman have it do and she be from somalia she have it do in somalia and
S0104	oh right
S0167	come over and erm she be bleed apparently and he undo the stitch
S0104	oh
S0167	erm and then afterwards after she'd have the baby he redo it as it be as he find it erm
S0104	but be the doctor
S0167	yeah
S0104	oh well that's not his fault
S0167	i know but that's that's what people be say that's why he be acquit because
S0104	oh
S0167	he be cos i think the court be be pressure to bring someone in and he be
S0104	right
S0167	the one they choose for some reason and erm he erm he's be yeah he's not he hasn't go to prison or anything now he's back in his job but
S0104	mm
S0167	because he do it erm because he do it back to how it be before which be an fgm
S0104	but do he do it because he think that be the best thing for her because otherwise
S0167	yeah cos it be bleed
S0104	yeah
S0167	so he stitch it back up
S0104	yeah
S0167	erm and he and his defence be it be an emergency situation
S0104	yeah
S0167	she be bleed he need to get her into theatre quickly and he have it have to be very quick
S0104	yeah
S0167	he didn't have time to kind of and he say he didn't know it be an fgm cos he's never come across it before
S0104	right be be he a somalian doctor or
S0167	no he come from sri lanka and he's a hindu so
S0104	right
S0167	it be like part of his defence be it's not his cultural background so
S0104	yeah
S0167	he's he would have no reason
S0104	i wouldn't i wouldn't
S0167	to want her
S0104	i've no idea what a fgm look like
S0167	i know apparently that's what he say as well
S0104	right
S0167	and he's never see one before and he's get no reason in his cultural background to want to do it and stuff like that
S0104	yeah
S0167	erm and yeah so that's all fine and the woman the woman give a statement as well say that he he be a good doctor and she doesn't have any problem with what he do and all of the
S0104	oh it's a stupid stupid one to bring to court
S0167	i know
S0104	why don't they just get one of those father who have just do it to their daughter and bring them to court
S0167	yeah i know i think that's what they're try to do but i guess it's harder it's easier to bring a doctor to court isn't it cos you it's in the open whereas it's harder to know when it's be do in the home i suppose
S0104	mm
S0167	but erm yeah and there be a there be erm one nurse phone in and she say she be at she and three other midwives be this woman be have a baby and she'd have fgm and they'd have to unstitch her
S0104	yeah
S0167	because it's not big enough if you've have an fgm to have a baby
S0104	so how do they manage out in the bloom
S0167	probably die
S0104	yeah
S0167	erm and then they say to each other okay we'll erm put it back nicely as a you know
S0104	mm
S0167	we won't restore the fgm we'll put it back as a nice vagina
S0104	neatly
S0167	neatly
S0110	excuse me
S0167	and apparently the husband turn round and say you put it back how it be they say no no we'll we'll do it er nicely so it's open next time she have a baby and he go you put that back how it be or i'll go home and do it myself
S0104	oh my god
S0167	and she say erm they be alone it be it be the middle of the night they be kind of alone in the hospital in that area of the hospital and the three women and this man be really threaten and erm so they they have no choice they put it back how it be
S0104	i would have phone security
S0167	yeah
S0104	and have him arrest
S0167	but then i guess you wouldn't want him to go home with her if he say that
S0104	mm
S0167	you'd rather do it yourself wouldn't you
S0104	mm
S0167	but yeah it's a bite weird it's a weird cultural thing that they
S0104	it be really weird i don't i wonder where it come from why
S0167	i don't know
S0104	really weird
S0167	it's strange
S0104	oh damn it i wish hadn't steal my dry shampoo she nick it i'd just buy it as
