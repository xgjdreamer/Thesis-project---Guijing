S0152	but the but the problem be if you have a big lens which be just a lens in the sense that it's a four hundred you can't do anything else with it
S0013	no you can't no
S0012	no
S0152	so that mean you've get to swap and change
S0013	well you have to actually
S0012	it's annoy isn't it
S0152	yeah oh i hadn't think of it
S0012	one with the long long lens like that
S0152	long lens i hadn't think of that oh dear
S0012	and then of course you want another one for the macro and another one midrange
S0152	just midrange yeah i can only get like
S0012	three cameras yeah
S0013	that bloke who who live in the in the maasai
S0152	yeah i know what you mean the desert
S0013	maasai desert maasai
S0152	the eh game park game reserve
S0013	yeah he live there right well he doesn't live there he travel around it and he's get a range rover and on every window of his range rover all through and everywhere he's get the thing he's get all these different cameras with all these different lenses on depend on which one he want to use he's there all the time and he's wildlife photographer of the year and he's
S0152	well he probably earn a fair little bite from the picture that he actually take
S0013	he probably do yeah he do he do it for national geo geographical geographic
S0012	there you go
S0152	so yeah he's bind to have good things
S0013	but he's get he lot and you just see him and he and he spend he's a frenchman i think and he spend about six months of the year in the desert or in the wherever it be massai i can't think of it maasai mara or something
S0152	maasai mara yeah
S0013	he spend about six month a year in there and then he go home to paris and sort all his picture out and that will take him just as long to sort all his picture out cos he's take thousands and he say he'll finish up with about a hundred
S0152	that's the normal rule isn't it
S0013	and then he's get to work through the hundred and he finish up with five or six
S0152	you think what they use to say about a reel of thirty six the old fashion film you'd have one picture on a reel of thirty six which be good
S0013	yeah
S0012	and that's if you're lucky really
S0013	yeah
S0012	but we don't travel we don't see tigers and lions and giraffes and

S0152	i think one of them one of the other children who be in hospital in london
S0013	oh right
S0152	but it's not the nicest of families be it
S0013	yeah
S0152	and it kind of make well no i shouldn't really wonder anymore it doesn't it just annoy me now it really make me cross really
S0013	yeah well it would do
S0152	it make me cross
S0013	mm yeah well she she be a bite yeah wasn't she
S0152	she be alright at the begin
S0013	yeah but she want to change your life that be the problem
S0152	but she weren't go to you know well that wasn't go to happen be it so
S0013	yeah
S0152	i stick my grind didn't i whatever i have my value in the end of the day
S0013	yeah yeah i still can't understand why you put up with it for so long you put up with her all that long time until you have a row that night with the children well not a row but you you say what you think and then she she keep slap that back at you
S0152	because it be just the feel wasn't it
S0013	love be blind as they say
S0152	yeah there be nothing i could do about it i i you know i i'd say after the issue with the kid that i wouldn't let the kid get in the way or something that i wouldn't let the kid get in the way and and know that's what i do with
S0013	yeah well you didn't really let the kid get in the way you let that that get in the way
S0152	but school be difficult at that point in time if you consider what what have happen in the last six years
S0013	yeah well you've go through hell and high water you have
S0152	since since two thousand and five
S0013	out of the fry pan in to the fire as they say
S0152	you know it's it's it hasn't be the easiest of
S0013	no no it hasn't
S0152	with everything that with everything that go on at at school i mean get move from one school to another which be good cos it be a promotion and everything else which be which be good and i enjoy that time i learn a lot
S0013	yeah
S0152	but then have to deal with that child protection issue with that ex deputy that wasn't that wasn't good have to deal with a school with special measure then when you think the things that be okay on the personal front you've literally get that be go okay
S0013	and then you get
S0152	and then and then you get somebody there you know it just wasn't it just wasn't right it just wasn't
S0013	but then that's change your whole attitude towards work as well that's the point you don't you don't feel like go back into everything
S0152	i be you know we've we've sit here before and we've go through how not feel value
S0013	yeah
S0152	that's that's the whole thing wasn't it it be a whole it be a whole feel value so not just work but also in a relationship which you try you know i feel that i work hard
S0013	in both
S0152	in in both and get nothing for it
S0013	yeah yeah yeah yeah that be difficult for you
S0152	you know and even even go when i go in november that be fine because that be just like be on holiday november through to christmas cos i be be i be be pay so it wasn't nice at the time and i know for a fact i be quite low
S0013	yeah well you be
S0152	and it's not as bad as it use to be it come and go but the biggest the biggest change be actually go to north orsham
S0013	yeah
S0152	and actually realise that it wasn't me
S0013	well yeah it's do you good hasn't it
S0152	you know it it wasn't me that have the problem cos if i can if i can walk in a school where i like two members of staff know me three members of staff know me and a couple have hear about me in the sense from confidences and stuff like that and the kid have never hear of me but to be able to walk in and not and have and have that respect
S0013	yeah
S0152	and prepare to be prepare to listen and take on board what you be say in short period of time
S0013	yeah you do very well there pity that be only part time
S0152	you know em
S0013	well see you wouldn't have want it full time would you
S0152	i couldn't have do i salary wise it just doesn't work but i'd like you know if i could if there's some if i be in the position where if i be in the position where that type of i could do that type of job because i didn't have to worry about what i've get to pay then i would do it
S0013	yeah
S0152	because it be reward in another in another sense
S0013	yeah
S0152	but i do want to be back in the classroom
S0013	yeah
S0152	i do want to be back in the classroom
S0013	you wouldn't want to be head then you haven't hear anything from 's
S0152	i've not hear anything from i've not hear i'm go to make a phone call this week to a special school
S0013	yeah do you reckon someone would put the kibosh on that sort of thing
S0152	oh yeah somebody would count it
S0013	yeah
S0152	somebody in county put the kibosh on it
S0012	why
S0013	why because it all stem back into go into special measure

S0013	yeah
S0152	alright and then when we be go into the academy we stick together on the right of we don't want to be part of we want a separate academy for and they didn't like that
S0012	mm
S0152	and i think certain things be say and i i i haven't get the proof but the head at north orsham have kind of very much say the same
S0013	yeah so you don't reckon your chance of get your head in north orsham be any good
S0152	no
S0013	weird isn't it isn't it weird what the power that be can do
S0012	not great be it

S0013	yeah
S0152	doesn't that go against
