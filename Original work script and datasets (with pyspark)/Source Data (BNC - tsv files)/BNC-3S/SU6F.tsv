S0281	i've get no idea
S0281	i never see them before

S0281	well
S0144	or you just saw picture of it
S0281	i just saw picture of it
S0144	yeah
S0281	yeah cos when we be i mean it be too late because i be er i well i presume it be too late i maybe it be something to do with how low in the sky it be
S0144	yeah
S0281	cos all these picture that we saw that take about half a six and
S0144	yeah
S0281	when we be have a foot massage about oh well well it be an hour and a half so it be from half past nine to eleven o'clock
S0144	yeah
S0281	really cheap actually
S0144	yeah
S0281	yeah
S0281	for oh ninety minutes and very do this weird thing that i've never experience before it be right at the end and erm and it have start off er with er your normal foot massage
S0144	yeah
S0281	er and then work up to your knees
S0144	yeah
S0281	and erm then erm that that one for a long time erm oh no no no it start erm it start off with er sit on the stool and er do some neck and back massage which be really nice erm then er the foot massage erm and but it finish off with back massage and it be something really weird and i didn't know what be go on until i saw what be they be do the same to what they do be erm first of all they give you a erm a massage er to loosen up the lower back this you'd really like this
S0144	yeah
S0281	and erm er then they put these strip of i it's some kind of tuber some root vegetable
S0144	right
S0281	i mean use it in my cook
S0144	mm
S0281	on the rare time she cook
S0281	and they put strip about so long er on your back which overlap just on the the lower back and then they place a cloth over the top
S0144	mm
S0281	and then she bring in these they look like huge joint
S0281	two two huge spliffs
S0281	er that be attach with this clip and then proceed to wave them about between one and two inch above the back
S0144	mm
S0281	and this be the heat i felt i i i think it be wax
S0144	mm
S0281	that be be pour on my back i didn't i i cos i couldn't see what be go on and er i it be only when be have it do to her that i i could see what they be do
S0281	and there be this this be the heat and er it's a it's a bite whiffy you know it's erm a bite strong smell smoke in the air
S0144	yeah
S0281	but not that that totally unpleasant but there be smoke around yeah but er amaze yeah
S0144	yeah
S0281	yes
S0144	oh good
S0281	well
S0144	so they're massage you at the same time then do this or this be after
S0281	no no no this be the last thing they do
S0144	right
S0281	they do the massage first i think to loosen it up i suppose
S0144	yeah
S0281	i but i i mean they they say it's good for you and presumably the heat somehow release the goodness from the vegetable which then seep into your back or whatever this er it work or not i know but i don't know but i mean i didn't have a bad back so i i couldn't compare you know whether it work or not or whatever
S0144	yeah
S0281	so but erm er i don't know but erm i mean if you want to try it out it's it's right next door to where we live
S0144	oh okay yeah so
S0281	and that's
S0144	i know with taoism there's some some type of smoke i can't remember which ones but they're suppose to be cleanse er you know take out the impurities i can't remember which ones though no frankincense it be er will know but yeah if they be put it at the base of your back so that's the back of your erm solar plexus chakra would that be
S0281	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0281	i be suppose to have a stomach massage before the back one but erm erm i didn't want that in case of get a funny tummy you know
S0144	yeah i don't really like stomach massage it's kind of
S0281	mm
S0144	i dunno there's too many things there to prod isn't there
S0281	well
S0144	like no i can't see what the good that do really massage your stomach
S0281	mm
S0144	i suppose you can move stuff if it's block but i don't know i don't like the idea of that i prefer like deep muscle
S0281	mm
S0144	on your back or legs or something
S0281	well i felt mm since i hit the a couple of bottle of wine the other week erm my stomach hasn't be the same so i've be very careful of what i've be eat and drink
S0144	yeah
S0281	and erm in fact i go down the the the other night have a couple of pints but er apart from that i you know haven't be eat much either
S0144	yeah
S0281	so do i i think cos a er what i be scar of i be gonna get the the pancreatitis be gonna come back
S0144	oh yeah
S0281	and i didn't wanna get that back in the hospital especially since i don't have medical insurance any more
S0144	yeah that's true it's not that it's pretty cheap though isn't it but i suppose you'd wanna go and have good treatment
S0281	well
S0144	would you go to a chinese hospital
S0281	well well no i mean where i go before be an an you know in hospital but it be erm it be er you know it's the inconvenience of it i mean the first five days no food or water
S0144	mm
S0281	just this intravenous drip for five days sort of thing
S0144	mm
S0281	and then after that er you only sort of like stodge you could eat you know like porridge and
S0144	mm
S0281	other stuff like that
S0144	yeah
S0281	so i've be a bite careful
S0144	mm yeah i've have enough of drink as well and i've not gonna i'm not probably won't go to again for quite a long time i should think
S0281	really
S0144	well it take me until wednesday to start feel normal again

S0024	it's a bite weird to have a teachers' day at the begin of term they should have it at the end of the year and then if er if you feel like you're you've have a good year with your teacher then you can do something if not don't
S0281	yeah
S0024	you know it's a bite
S0281	yeah think it's up to the parent anyway it's get
S0024	yeah
S0281	don't think kid have get any say in it but anyway it's er it's expect so i don't agree with it but
S0024	what do you get

S0281	mm
S0024	we get the end of the day with her as well when she's tire
S0281	yeah
S0024	but
S0281	but i think the idea be with one of you you're just split the work
S0024	yeah yeah we be so they're come back but there's a lot of mark lately so you know we're try to do
S0281	mm
S0024	do bits and bob as well so bring work home do a bite of work at home i get distract so easily i just wanna know what's go on in the other room if he's play you alright
S0281	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0281	i certainly miss the money and you know the and the company with the and all the rest of but the the contact with the kid but i certainly don't miss the mark and and
S0024	yeah
S0281	have to get up at seven o'clock every morning
S0024	see i see i do that last term i be do stuff in the morning cos i'm a morning person get up early to finish mark
S0281	mm
S0024	and do bits but now with she get up in the morning so i can't do any extra in the morning so er even er i've gotta stop it i've get to stop work the even
S0281	mm
S0024	and come in cos i've be come home to spend some time with her and then do bits in the even do you pick her up or leave her in the
S0144	i pick her up
S0024	pick her up
S0144	and she have load of wind
S0024	really
S0144	so i think that's what might be why
S0024	you're much better at the wind than me
S0144	yeah
S0024	he be
S0024	he be much
S0144	it's what i eat
S0024	er yeah you're better at get rid of it more
S0144	get rid of the wind
S0024	so she should sleep now once she's asleep she's fine
S0144	yeah
S0024	but it's difficult to know whether she cry like she cry for a reason usually doesn't she but
S0144	yeah
S0024	she's get so many emotions lately that i think she might start cry to get cuddle
S0144	mm
S0024	extra cuddle you know
S0144	that's the problem
S0024	do do that
S0281	what's that
S0024	cry for attention you know there's two
S0281	yeah
S0024	people either leave them to cry
S0281	i don't know
S0024	or they go in to them but always seem to have something wrong with her when she cry
S0281	yeah
S0144	yeah well she's get that age now i think where she's gonna start really play with us a little bite
S0024	i don't know mm maybe not
S0144	anyway you need to go and do your work
S0024	i know
S0144	shouldn't be mark in the even anyway of course
