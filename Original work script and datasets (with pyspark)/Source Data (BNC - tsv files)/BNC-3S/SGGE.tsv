S0198	no she didn't
S0230	well the
S0198	she'd just have it do
S0230	oh
S0198	i think they just do it
S0230	and look the edge still haven't be finish
S0198	oh
S0230	see 's terrible for finish off job
S0198	no he do the bulk and then leave it
S0230	yeah
S0198	like me so but do he do the bathroom or do they get someone in to do that
S0230	no i think somebody do that well he might have do it
S0198	i suppose he's capable
S0230	yeah
S0198	what be it do he be he an electrician or
S0230	yeah
S0198	a plumber an electrician
S0230	an electrician
S0198	that's handy isn't it
S0230	yeah
S0198	that's a good trade to have
S0198	have he always have a similar position have he work his way up do you know
S0230	i don't know really
S0198	tell no
S0230	well he's work for the council council for a long time
S0198	yeah i know that it mean he should get an alright pension doesn't it
S0230	yeah yeah he should get quite a decent pension oh well
S0198	but you don't know if he's have any promotions within that
S0230	no
S0198	i imagine you do to a certain extent say that 's dad's be do a very similar job for the last twenty years
S0230	yeah
S0198	yeah but he doesn't get pay so much for his but erm
S0230	so much as what
S0198	as an electrician i imagine
S0230	what do 's do then
S0198	he do he drive around one of the things he do be he take photos of things for the council that be gonna get like he's design disable ramp before and he'll go round and he'll take a i think he survey a site or something that they're gonna use for something
S0230	oh i bet he be quite well pay
S0198	doesn't i think he know how much he earn and i don't think it's above twenty
S0230	oh
S0198	might be twenty just above twenty or something but 's always go on about how his parent have never their combine wag never mount to such and such
S0230	well er mine and dad's combine wage never amount to much
S0198	no i know it didn't which be i always through 's dad would have be on maybe he's on more money that think he be but i'm sure he's be frank with him but i dunno i'll have to ask him again
S0230	but when start uni do they get help with the tuition fee or
S0198	no well they assess both households and his parent be divorce
S0230	oh yeah of course
S0198	so he he be really annoy about it cos a he'd be live on his own work for a year so he want to go independently assess and for some reason they wouldn't do it they have to assess one of his households and they his parent have just separate so he choose i think his mum and he he say recently you know they they examine both but i'm sure at the time he say he choose have to choose one but it wasn't a very good representation cos he say on either side my their partner's not help me and my fact they his parent weren't help him either
S0230	oh
S0198	so he he end up get less i mean he get most all the basic stuff but i don't think he get like i his loan's slightly more than mine by about a thousand pound and i think that's the grant that i get that i never have to pay back but i mean he still get the full loan for everything else basically anyone can get that
S0230	so have they who have to pay his cos
S0198	i mean he pay his tuition
S0230	from his loan
S0198	yeah for his house and stuff like i do
S0230	because the the first year you be there we pay some we have to pay so much didn't we
S0198	oh towards the tuition
S0230	yeah
S0198	cos you be both work
S0230	yeah
S0198	do you
S0230	yeah
S0198	no down
S0229	get down come on go on
S0198	i didn't
S0230	yeah
S0198	i don't remember that
S0229	stay
S0230	yeah we do
S0229	sit
S0230	the first year you be at uni we have i can't remember how much it be but because our combine wag wasn't a huge amount it be a reduce amount we have to pay
S0198	okay yeah see maybe he have to pay all his tuition then initially
S0230	yeah
S0198	i know as it go on my tuition get a little less maybe cos once you stop work once dad stop work
S0230	well yeah and i obviously i'm
S0198	you stop at some point altogether as well
S0230	but i mean the first after i finish at erm finish work full time i i mean what i be earn be nothing then
S0198	no yeah exactly
S0230	it's all like sixty pound a week i think it be in the
S0198	so i didn't think i i don't think i have to pay too much in tuition at all my loan be mainly for it be for live
S0229	down
S0198	it be to pay for the rent
S0229	down
S0198	and then to pay for
S0229	sit down there
S0198	towards live expense
S0229	don't
S0230	yeah
S0198	it's not really that's the thing in america they have these huge loan and it's because their tuition be so high and like our loan be kind substantial but only because we've just pay that on rent and stuff i don't know what they do about accommodation i mean i guess they still have to make money to pay for that as well
S0230	but our tuition fee be a lot higher now than when you be there
S0198	a lot higher that's a joke that's an understatement they're disgust now
S0230	what be they now
S0198	about nine thousand a year nine thousand pound a year when i do when i go to university it be twelve hundred we
S0230	and then they go up to three thousand
S0198	we
S0230	didn't they
S0198	yeah they
S0230	you just miss that didn't you
S0198	do the top up fee yeah
S0230	yeah
S0198	but nine er between eight er universities now can charge between nine and up to twelve thousand i think but i think they're all about nine thousand a year which be what be go to be pay for hers
S0230	mm
S0198	that's an expensive degree it's a joke consider so much europe be still completely free we've completely in one year like within a couple of years basically since david cameron's come in just flip and like education we've completely copy the american system
S0230	the americans
S0198	and realise how much more money some of the loan the student loan that be take out ten years ago or so they've sell those loan off to private company so now they those people don't deal with the government loan student loan company any more they're private company deal with them and they can introduce new rule about how you should pay back i don't want my loan if my loan go off to a private company i'm screw like i'm have to pay that back instantly they shouldn't be allow to do stuff like that but of course when you're eighteen and you sign it you don't know what you're sign and even if you do you don't have a choice
S0230	no
S0198	they just grab you by the ball basically which be what have well you know so i just i wouldn't want to be in 's position particularly
S0230	i i mean how when you think how it's change when when go to uni she get pay for go
S0198	i know
S0230	to university she have grant throw at her
S0198	yeah for go and stay in education
S0230	yeah she didn't and nothing have to be pay back
S0198	no
S0230	that's what
S0198	yeah 's brother say she he get pay to go to university to train as a doctor his education be pay for in the er only they only start charge tuition in the nineties
S0230	yet her parent weren't hard up
S0198	no
S0230	it wasn't as though she come from a poor background
S0198	background well she probably wouldn't have get to university if she have
S0230	no
S0198	just cos of your level of education and the attitude of the family
S0230	yeah
S0198	but yeah it's a shame i guess too many people start to go to they they just turn it more into a business i suppose
S0230	like everything
S0198	yeah want everyone to go to university
S0230	it's like i know it's completely opposite but it's like the care home it it's not a care profession now it's a business it's there to make money for the
S0198	the owner the profit
S0230	for the yeah
S0198	the organisation
S0230	the organisation that own it
S0198	same as
S0230	which be why everything why the staff be the bare minimum
S0198	i know
S0230	when it be private when it be first open by dr who open it as a care profession we have so many staff
S0198	oh really do you be you there at when it be be open then be it
S0230	not when it first open but it hadn't be open all that long
S0198	oh really i hadn't realise that
S0230	when i first start
S0198	oh really
S0230	yeah it be erm
S0198	what be there before do you remember
S0230	yeah council offices
S0198	oh really
S0230	mm
S0198	in the same build
S0230	yeah
S0198	oh
S0230	you could actually get marry there at one time
S0198	oh could you
S0230	yeah
S0198	that would have be a cheaper wed
S0230	yeah i mean i there be so many kitchen staff
S0198	yeah
S0230	and carers there be there be twice the amount of carers that there be now
S0198	it's cos there there be a point when provide service be provide a good service wasn't it
S0230	mm
S0198	we seem to have become very detach from that in our culture
S0230	but he must have be able to run it at a profit he couldn't have be lose money on it
S0198	no
S0230	otherwise he wouldn't have be do it
S0198	otherwise he wouldn't have do no when do it change then that be when you be a cook wasn't it

S0230	well i suppose it's a level of
