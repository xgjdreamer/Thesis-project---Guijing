S0189	maybe it's there
S0192	er or if you just it's pretty good be it right that you need to run batteries out you shouldn't just leave them plug in you should like
S0189	don't leave it plug in all the time
S0192	yeah
S0189	like unplug it like and charge it down and then back up like once a month or something
S0192	that's what i've be do
S0189	yeah that's fine you don't need to like do it frequently
S0192	oh okay just every so often
S0189	mm
S0192	okay unless it's ssb be that right
S0189	no that doesn't matter the sst be the hard drive not the battery
S0228	run the battery down flat then charge it up

S0192	it be tell me earlier not to de frag if i have sst but i don't have hdd or something
S0189	yeah you probably don't have an sst on it
S0192	yeah
S0189	er i once a year
S0192	it's set up on windows 8 it's better at do it apparently accord to some
S0189	yeah
S0192	de fragging i ain't get a fuck clue about computers anyway
S0189	i wouldn't worry about it
S0192	i can use the one
S0228	i mean the best thing to do be just to er i always just put it back to what be it restore mode where you put it back to a date
S0189	yeah
S0192	mm
S0228	just do that then
S0189	or if you get a virus
S0228	yeah but if you just go what it be f11 mode go into safe mode
S0192	yeah yeah
S0228	so if nothing happen you can get rid of it
S0192	i've get one touch restore or something on it it's get a little button on the front
S0228	that sound a bite dodgy only if you touch it by mistake
S0192	uh
S0228	what happen if you touch it by mistake
S0192	i think it ask a series of would you like to as a rule
S0228	well surely a virus
S0192	you start it when it's boot i think but erm i wonder why
S0192	i buy a terabyte but i buy a terabyte hard drive er but you don't need a disk or anything like that you don't need to like do anything i just have a terabyte hard drive but when i actually get it it be only like eight hundred and sixty i look it up and they be like
S0228	push the ashtray this way a little bite please
S0189	yeah sure
S0192	it have a it have er start up image write on to the hard drive so that i can always restore it back to when i first buy it without a cd or without anything else
S0189	yeah
S0192	so it's get i've lose space but i've get the image so
S0189	yeah
S0192	and i can back up another image of what my computer be now to like a hard drive or something which i may well do but i haven't actually do it yet i don't know if this image be actually like a a zip kind of file that i can't actually access or whether it's
S0189	it's probably like a hide partition that you can't actually see at all
S0192	yeah i think it be it's a bite crazy just partition a massive chunk away but i've get terabyte hard drive so it's not terrible
S0189	yeah i'm sure you won't run out of space until you've download load of crap
S0192	yeah i've get one on my computer and now i've get a hand hold one as well
S0189	yeah

S0192	wobbliness to it and i pick up one in the shop as
S0189	that's the key wobble
S0192	yeah
S0228	write battle arena it's like e d g

S0192	we didn't really do that much kick box he be just train us up to be fit enough to actually be able to kick box he be take it pretty slow with us but he be good and i do it for like
S0189	what be the structure of your course like do you do any er like core exercise or anything like that
S0192	erm
S0189	
S0192	yeah it be just load of exercise it wasn't like actually fight or anything we didn't get to fight i only do it for a few months and it be then the course just start
S0189	yeah i don't know how it be there but
S0192	it be just intense
S0189	fight fit at the be like you go there and then like you'll do a bite of shadow box for like a minute
S0192	yeah
S0189	and then every minute the thing that you're do change so you do it for a minute and then you don't get any rest really er so like you do some press up and erm
S0192	i'm pretty sure it be like similar
S0189	things like that
S0192	but it be erm small scale it be just one guy and he rent out a classroom the university i guess he be try to get people
S0189	maybe
S0192	it be full on i remember it be like you didn't get much of a break at all and it be like
S0189	yeah
S0192	tough lot of press up
S0189	yeah you do that for about ten minutes then you get the the like half size fight bag that you can like punch and shit like that
S0192	yeah yeah
S0189	do that for another ten minutes and then the kick bag which you then punch and then you kick and then you punch and kick
S0192	yeah
S0189	and then it's some core work out and then like a stretch and rest and that's it
S0192	i do need to start a class how much be they though about fifty quid a month

S0228	what be you eat what you eat cucumber
S0192	i have a cucumber and some egg or something
S0228	what
S0228	i wouldn't eat that
S0189	so random
S0192	well i do i take like when i go hike i take like nut egg cheese cucumber bite of veg something like that erm some pepper or some carrot or something raisins
S0189	i'm pretty sure that nut take like three hours to digest so you're probably like oh i'm hungry need some energy i'll eat some nut
S0192	oh i find nut be pretty good actually
S0189	yeah
S0192	they're good for just a continual energy cos you just like keep munch on them but they're pretty high in fat and protein
S0189	i know but those be the things that take forever to digest and get into your blood
S0192	yeah but they don't seem to take that long like probably if you eat then with like raisins or something it help
S0228	you use more water and stuff for digest fat and stuff don't you to break it down
S0192	yeah but they're good they're slow burners but they burn
S0189	yeah
S0192	i like raisins
S0189	funny thing be if you have too much sugar in your diet you kind've lose the ability to actually metabolise fat
S0192	yeah
S0189	like that you eat or that be part of your body

S0189	oh they have barely any carbs they're like
