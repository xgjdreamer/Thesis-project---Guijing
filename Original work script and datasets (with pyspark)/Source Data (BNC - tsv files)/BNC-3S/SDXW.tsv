S0013	how the other dog go and fetch him and
S0278	oh it's extraordinary that that i've never
S0013	friendship
S0278	i've never see anything quite like it wasn't just go to fetch there be a urgency she go like a streak straight for him do you know today i have a seat where his crate normally be
S0013	mm
S0278	i open the door he jump up straight into the seat
S0012	do he
S0278	he can't see at all can he
S0012	no
S0013	oh right
S0012	well he get well that's your seat here
S0278	i know that one one i think oh you probably want me to come and get the seat
S0278	that's the thing the sofa
S0012	and and we get some wood for you
S0278	have you
S0013	that's
S0012	yeah
S0013	those doors you say you want it for something
S0012	you say you want them doors yeah well you'll see em anyway
S0278	oh that's what i be think of put the i don't know
S0013	you don't want them now do you
S0278	well let's have a look well the idea be to take off my garage door the front of the garage and put a window and and doors in there in its place so that if i be work in there it's no good have a garage door cos the moment you open it all the all the heat come out in the winter
S0012	yeah
S0278	but i've find a solution for the winter cos i just in my i just work in my lounge
S0012	well yeah it's the best thing
S0013	yeah
S0012	you can do
S0278	erm and that that's better than try to heat up another area isn't it
S0012	well of course it be yeah
S0278	erm
S0013	no
S0012	that
S0278	so
S0012	you can't get two that's not toxic be it your
S0278	mm
S0012	stuff that's not toxic the stuff you use the the glue or the what the cleaner
S0278	my get a bite excite about the the stuff i use for etch glass
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0278	she say i really should have a erm a fume cabinet that exhaust out through a tube
S0012	oh i see
S0278	erm and i could build one of those quite simply actually erm but the thing be i do it i do it in the open in the summer you know the the doors be all open and
S0012	yeah
S0278	so i can
S0013	oh
S0278	erm sometimes my eye use to sting a little bite but but they don't i'm not i'm i'm not mass produce
S0012	no
S0278	every time i've do a little glass with etch on for somebody for a wed or something they love it you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	i do one for 's daughter when she get marry there and and er what they really because they've both get home to start with they didn't want any gift really but a little bite of money would've help towards the wed cos it cost em a lot of money
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	but well they couldn't do that and i didn't know about that what they want so i make just a little tank glass with love joy peace and things like that on it and their name two name and the date
S0013	yeah
S0278	and that apparently be in the middle of their mantelpiece and they and they think it's wonderful
S0013	yeah lovely
S0278	but the effort require erm think there be something like six pound from er what's er be it a norwegian firm or swedish firm that make furniture
S0012	oh what the
S0278	yeah you know they don't we don't one up here
S0012	we don't have one
S0013	to get glass you mean
S0012	no
S0278	no i buy that's where i buy these glass from and they be really cheap
S0013	yeah glass
S0278	i buy i buy a sort of a quite a stack of them i've still get some up in the loft
S0012	swedish firm that er
S0278	yeah ikea
S0012	ikea that's the one
S0278	and and then but then from the point of view i just draft it out cut out get a stencil with my sign write stuff stick it on the glass get i've get plastic tool i just dig out dig out it's only a little pot
S0012	yeah
S0278	dig out a bite smooth it on smooth it on leave it for about
S0013	oh
S0278	quarter of an hour scrape off what i can and put it back in the pot
S0013	mm
S0278	cos that's that's not be use and you put it under water wipe it off with the with gloves
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	you wipe it all off erm the and it's etch the glass
S0013	lovely
S0278	it's a lovely actually it's probably safer than grind it cos you've get all the dust
S0012	well you do you get yeah
S0278	mm
S0012	well you'd have to wear a mask yeah
S0278	well everyone's always thrill whenever i do one and it's so simple
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	erm but say oh that what be it i do look at the do say what it be on the piece of paper come with it
S0013	right
S0278	and erm
S0012	oh that's some kind of acid isn't it that's gotta be
S0278	yeah
S0012	an acid thing

S0012	one one of them little face mask
S0278	mm but i couldn't find the goggle last time so i do em without the goggle my eye do do sting a bite
S0278	so yeah why be we talk about that cos i i
S0013	erm
S0278	what lead on to that
S0012	i don't know
S0278	i your doors
S0012	oh yeah oh we're not about great big doors
S0278	doors
S0013	no we haven't get any big doors
S0278	they're small doors
S0012	we're talk about the doors that fit on units and stuff like that little kitchen unit things
S0278	i use
S0013	you you ask for er like a just a piece of wood really
S0278	oh that be for plonk my i i get away without do it
S0013	right yeah
S0278	i find the wire be long enough what it be in the church
S0012	oh i see yeah you weren't gonna
S0278	that that be pardon me that be quite
S0013	mm
S0278	quite amaze the cos i sit i in the end i didn't use their their speakers they they're really just for voice the speakers they're weren't do music well they be do it but not well enough
S0013	yeah
S0278	cos i try first run erm from the phone outlet
S0012	yeah
S0278	there i get a wire run it right to the front and an adapter to stick it in the a microphone socket on the pulpit
S0012	oh i see yeah yeah
S0278	and it work
S0012	oh
S0278	and actually we find out that one of their speakers hadn't be work for years
S0012	mm
S0278	it be paint over and the last time that be paint be donkey's years ago and the wire be under the paint and it be non existent it be only one side of the wire
S0012	yeah
S0278	the other half have be eat at some stage
S0012	we we've gotta chuck some speakers away do you want any speakers
S0278	oh don't chuck speakers please yes
S0013	yeah
S0278	cos if i could fix up speakers in the church and just plug in that'd save me two things it's if we don't if we haven't get an organist i can be the organ and we have the hymn that that be play by this guy find on the internet erm he be be a
S0012	just check
S0278	organist at york minster
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and he erm he play the organ in a little church parish church up in the country and so it suit a small church and he
S0013	oh
S0278	be start there the year i finish the job he be get on a bite but erm he do one cd which be popular hymn and he play through the first line
S0012	yeah
S0278	and then start it
S0278	and it's beautifully do you could actually hear him move the stock
S0013	oh
S0278	it's mp3 so it play on that
S0012	yes
S0278	online
S0012	yeah
S0278	and erm so i i do that for the hymn use these speakers but they're bite bite big to carry round
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and then at the end we get right to the end and i play a voluntary he have a voluntary do
S0012	wow
S0013	oh
S0278	and the moment i stick that on at the end of the service turn to and say who's play the organ and up until then he hadn't realise that they he well he perhaps think the hymn be be be record
S0012	yes
S0278	but when the voluntary come on
S0013	mm
S0278	he didn't associate that with anything electronic
S0012	oh yeah
S0278	he say er who's play the organ
S0012	oh
S0278	and isn't that lovely
S0013	yeah
S0278	so it obviously suit because it's must've sound like that little organ in there
S0012	oh
S0013	oh
S0278	yeah
S0012	how be he be he be he
S0278	oh yeah he's he's alright
S0012	be he
S0278	he's a little bite uncertain on his feet someone gotta be with him all the time
S0012	yeah
S0278	er go out erm she often ask me if i'll pop round just for half an hour
S0013	mm
S0278	or well actually about three hours last time i think she sometimes like to have a day away cos give her a bite of respite you see
S0012	yeah
S0278	and erm so it's good to sit with he's no difficulty to with at all he's you'd have a good old conversation with him
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	you say you be gonna send me update for the church you know
S0278	yes i well well what what i'd like to do anyway go back to speakers if the speakers be you know if they're half decent ones then they will be better than just the the the little things hang on the wall
S0012	well that's it yeah
S0278	and i could leave them there that would be good and then i just if i run
S0012	they about that big
S0278	oh that's lovely i
S0013	we've get several actually i be
S0278	if i run the wire the wire to the back of the church
S0012	yeah
S0278	or just to where i'm sit will be fine
S0012	yeah
S0278	where i normally sit to that pew
S0012	yeah
S0278	and then how do the wire fit in the back have they get the little clip in
S0012	they've get little flip and
S0278	oh that's superb so i just need just need to get some wire
S0278	any old
S0012	yeah
S0278	electrical wire would do that won't it
S0012	well course it would
S0013	mm
S0012	i think i've get some actually
S0278	have you if you've get some of that as well then i'll just run that along the floor to where i sit
S0012	mm
S0278	then i just gotta take that bite that be lot easier
S0012	that would work yeah
S0278	and it's only i do think of go get more elaborate for them try to find something you know perhaps borrow something from or something bite of a fold back speaker or something
S0013	yeah
S0278	but that think that's over the top
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm so it would that not it's that would be useful thank you yeah
S0012	well we've get so our 's go to for my speakers but er
S0012	i've get speakers in in the in the shed you see
S0013	well you can still do that if you want you've still get speakers haven't you
S0013	or be they small ones
S0012	they're the small ones but they're big enough aren't they yeah i mean they belong they belong to that little thing though don't
S0013	yeah we don't want don't want much in there

S0013	a little bite
S0278	do you know isn't it often the way the older stuff be actually better
S0012	yes yes
S0278	they're cut corner to
S0013	yeah

S0278	and erm
S0013	oh right
S0278	and then now today she's go off see
S0012	uhu
S0278	think she's not feel too good at the minute or something yeah
S0013	so where do you stay on this trip to wales
S0278	right well what what what happen cos i wasn't prepare to leave for four as a no four days too long for and erm try to get out of it really but but i know i do enjoy help them last time erm and so didn't give up and he come up with a solution i i cos i've get the only vehicle that would take the four of them plus the bike so i have four bike on the top and er stand upright as you see them in the race do in the race
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh yeah
S0278	and so
S0012	what make to go on that then
S0278	well they they're special
S0012	they've get
S0278	or
S0012	yeah
S0278	clamp across then the special bike bits that go on
S0013	yeah
S0012	do they supply them then
S0278	and yeah and they you put you put them all on
S0278	and then so it have nothing to do with put on erm so we have two bar go across and then the the bike rack be sort of there's a long piece that go and then your wheel slot in between two pole
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0278	in a special bite and then all it have be a a plastic strap go over and hold the bottom of each of the front and the back wheel and then there's a bar that come up belong to the the lengthwise bite
S0012	yeah
S0278	that come up with a clamp on the top and that clamp on to the cross the the the forty five degree bar on the bike k
S0012	yeah
S0278	and hold that so the only thing hold the bike up it's it really be tramp up tight onto that bar
S0012	yeah
S0278	that's hold it upright and what's keep it on the top be just these two strap
S0012	yeah
S0278	on your bottom wheel
S0013	right
S0278	and then you can't i mean you can move them a little bite but
S0013	mm
S0278	there's no way they're gonna come off
S0012	do they make a row drive along do they whistle and
S0278	erm i do have some funny hoot at one stage i say what on earth's that you know and he say oh that'll be tube tube on the bike somewhere
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm but you know there not not an awful lot hold them on there
S0012	no
S0278	then ask him what sort of speed can i go he say well you you won't get much over sixty anyway and he's right you sorta hit a brick wall you go up to sixty and the car doesn't want to go any faster because of all your your
S0012	yeah all the
S0278	the wind resistance on it
S0012	yeah
S0278	it doesn't wanna do any more
S0013	oh right
S0012	no
S0278	so it end up be sixty and just below but then you get some occasion where you're stick right on the back side of the truck and you've gotta do a bite over sixty to get past him
S0012	yeah
S0278	and that and that be that be tricky cos i hate not be able to see the road ahead
S0012	that that's awful when you're behind a great big old truck yeah
S0278	i don't like them when yeah and erm and he's just go an awkward speed
S0013	mm
S0278	so i have to on couple occasion they get up to sixty five but poor old car struggle to build up
S0013	mm
S0278	up
S0012	yeah
S0278	to that speed but anyway so when when so the solution so i didn't leave more than two nights and be say yeah you'll be he be alright for the two nights last time i go from third night he be yowl his head off all night like i wasn't gonna put him through that
S0013	no
S0278	he's in the car at the minute but he's happy in the car cos he know that so
S0012	he's yeah
S0278	so he know it erm so

S0278	well yes but it's still one to one

S0278	cos there's
S0013	yeah
S0278	there's a lady in the village who's do it
S0012	yeah
S0278	er but and she be actually i have a chat with her she get walk her dog as well
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm and she be say oh erm you mention last time we meet about the youth the the youth club in the village say yes and and i say actually i think six to eleven no eight and nine or something i forget forget what it be but they're specific years school years only
S0012	yeah
S0278	i think it's the last year at and then they can still come their first year at the next school
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0278	so it keep everything so all those people that come from they can come back from that and still meet their mat
S0012	yeah
S0278	in there and that but it they're quite strict about the years er and she say oh right who who who run it and i say well it's it's it's oh i know i've meet her before and i point where live you know she tap on the door probably get the detail from there but tell me say no they're wrong wrong year we can't it's sad cos they need it it would be good for them
S0012	yeah
S0278	well
S0278	yeah but i mean 's a good school shame isn't it that it doesn't for some reason it didn't work
S0012	yeah
S0278	mm
S0012	well i don't know why they can't have a a youth club for youths i mean
S0278	erm
S0012	they have em up to fifteen at our at when we be there didn't we didn't we
S0013	don't know
S0012	yeah they be up to fifteen
S0278	it it probably it might've be a i guess it's easy as it's quite nice cos if you first of all for the first hour
S0012	be it still in the church room
S0278	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	for the first hour it's the one year group and then for the second hour it's both of them
S0012	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0278	and sort of
S0013	mm
S0278	and i think it probably be easier for the kid if it's like that than if you have a very wide age group
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh i see
S0278	it probably be more difficult
S0013	yeah that's true yeah
S0012	the youth club
S0013	yeah
S0012	that be there when we be up
S0278	mm
S0012	up the top of it the kid use to go
S0278	mm
S0012	to the youth club and use it as an excuse to go out
S0013	they just stand outside so they don't have to pay their pound
S0278	to get out
S0012	and they just stand outside and go up the fish shop and stand outside the fish shop and just
S0013	they just they just get together outside
S0012	and that's all they do
S0013	that's when it all go a bite wrong
S0278	mm
S0012	and it's all go and go all totally wrong
S0278	well they they it's all it's all the parent have a have to agree and they they be they sign in and if they leave before the end for any reason they have to sign out and the time that they
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	they if they do leave i mean you can't forcibly keep em in but you can get but
S0012	no you can't no

S0013	yeah
S0278	and it work
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's work people be turn up and
S0013	mm
