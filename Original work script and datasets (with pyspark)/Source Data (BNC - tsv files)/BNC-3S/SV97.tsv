S0486	right
S0523	antigua st lucia

S0523	yeah yeah yeah i know
S0489	well that's bore
S0523	i mean to get from from southampton to barbados would probably take yeah several days i should i think four five days at least i think that will be
S0489	yes what you're on the boat
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	yes that's a bite tedious
S0523	yeah well
S0489	when we go to the mediterranean we have one day on the boat
S0523	mm
S0489	and one night
S0486	mm
S0489	before we get to the first call be er be it lisbon i think we have one day and one night
S0523	mm
S0489	erm and actually it wasn't very smooth be it across the bay of biscay erm but it be you know that be long enough
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	oh and there be one day on the rhine cruise where we be sail all day down the river but there's so much to see
S0523	mm yeah yeah yeah

S0489	super day
S0486	i mean i quite like days like that where you just you be able just to sit down a read a book

S0486	instead of be interrupt all the time in what you're try to do
S0489	yes
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	yes
S0486	erm but i've never find those those viking tour there's too much go on really
S0523	mm
S0486	you know we we often say well we'll
S0489	yeah there's always something
S0486	well you know
S0489	we we miss quite a lot of things just to sit down for a bite
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	yeah yeah
S0489	sit and watch television didn't we watch a couple of film on television which be very good
S0486	yeah there be the that be quite funny really have these war film on didn't they
S0489	oh yes of course relevant to the area
S0523	oh yeah yes
S0486	relevant to the area
S0489	the bridge at remagen and er
S0486	yeah we saw so you have all that sort of
S0489	a bridge too far and
S0486	all the information that you need be usually on the television if you watch it
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0489	yeah
S0486	but i mean i don't mean we sit in and watch telly what we do be after lunch we go back and we sit in bed and have a rest for an hour or so and watch the television
S0523	mm mm
S0486	er and then in the even we have the meal and
S0489	yeah it be good wasn't it sometimes there be another visit in the even so
S0486	well we would get out and we would just you know erm
S0523	mm mm
S0489	but yeah you need to get off the boat every day i think
S0523	mm mm mm mm
S0486	yeah
S0489	so that's for sure
S0523	mm so we're we'll book a flight to barbados we'll be be fine
S0489	yes
S0523	erm erm so yeah so it'll it'll be good but otherwise it's erm that's that's it really at the moment
S0486	that's er yeah that's it for you
S0523	we we've have we've we've do six six or six quite a lot of tour in in er six tour in the last in the last about eighteen months or so
S0486	right

S0486	yeah yeah
S0523	it's really bizarre
S0486	yeah
S0523	absolutely bizarre
S0486	we have a a run of three different place we go to erm they be short break
S0523	mm
S0486	but actually we be really tire afterwards
S0523	mm mm
S0486	because we seem to be as soon as we be unpack we be pack for something else
S0523	yeah i know
S0486	and i don't really want to get into that again
S0523	yeah
S0486	i would rather they be a bite more isolate

S0523	mm
S0486	because the problem with that be that you cancel her and immediately if you get poorly you think oh i need someone to to help me a bite so there you go anyway

S0486	i've make a mess now on the nice clean table
S0523	at the moment i'm i'm try to go through old wine stock i've get i've build up
S0486	oh yes
S0523	i've build up
S0486	that sound onerous
S0523	it do
S0523	yes it be but er see the over the years we've be give erm bottle of wine
S0486	yeah
S0523	and for one reason or another the the date we haven't have a good rotation so i've take it on myself not to give it to anyone else but to drink it quietly in the back
S0486	yourself yeah very wise if you can
S0486	nice work if you can get it
S0486	i'd love to join you in that but i'm afraid i can't have wine any more which be terribly sad but there you go carry on
S0523	so anyway we're we we're slowly whittle it down but it do
S0486	yeah
S0523	it it it's erm it's just amaze how some of these things build up and you you just don't realise there's a bottle of wine stick at the bottom there that or at the back of the cupboard and anyway before christmas we be check to see how how much alcohol we have and we've have get we we've be give we've buy and it's have duty free from lot of trip
S0486	yeah
S0523	and so say to me aren't you gonna go and buy some then i say no we've we've get we've get we've get stock aplenty we've we've probably get enough for next christmas and the christmas after
S0486	how many bottle have you how many bottle have you get then
S0523	well we've we've we've get we've get bottle of erm we've pick up bottle of i i can't remember exactly but we've get we've get gin brandy we've get all kinds of you know all the
S0486	no you need to have a party don't you
S0523	oh yeah
S0486	you can have a party
S0523	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0486	you could invite all the people that have help you over the years with the house and
S0523	yeah
S0486	people who you know
S0523	yeah
S0486	just have a party
S0523	well that's true
S0486	the trouble be if if you might not want everyone trudge in
S0523	no no no no no no don't want that no no
S0486	well we we we er get a bite like that we think well you know people will come in and they won't put slippers on they'll
S0523	yeah
S0486	come in on a wet night with muddy shoe and walk all over the carpet and
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah i know
S0486	at least the smoke business be now over
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	nobody smoke in people's private home now
S0523	no no
S0486	well i'm sure in some place they will where everybody smoke but you know
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	well we're erm we're go to new york
S0523	mm
S0489	and the concept be to use up all my air miles
S0523	yeah great
S0489	so of course you use to be able to use airmail and get free flight
S0486	mm mm
S0489	and that be it but now of course a you can't get free flight you always have to pay a proportion
S0523	oh right
S0486	yeah
S0489	and also
S0523	it's be it it's probably quite low though isn't it
S0489	oh very low yeah
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	and also there's tax you've gotta pay in cash and duties and whatnot
S0523	mm mm mm oh right tax
S0489	anyway we're go to new york first class
S0523	oh first class oh brilliant oh great
S0489	and er and we're stay in a smart hotel in new york as well with some of the air miles so it's go to be quite a relatively cheap trip
S0523	mm mm yeah yeah
S0489	but erm yeah first class with british airways
S0523	yeah wow
S0489	i've do it before but erm of course you get on get the first class you get a big bag of stuff
S0523	mm mm
S0489	and you get a jumpsuit to change into
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	not as good as it use to be
S0523	mm
S0489	they kind of sort of devalue over the years erm it use to be a really sort of smart erm sort of well like a boiler suit a one piece onesie that you you wear with
S0523	mm yeah yeah
S0489	british airways first class
S0523	yeah
S0489	now all you get be a t shirt and some sort of jog
S0523	right
S0489	trousers but it's it's something
S0523	mm mm
S0489	the closest i remember i've ever come to a first class jumpsuit in the old style be
S0523	mm hm
S0489	i be fly somewhere and must have be across the atlantic and be sit in a three this be in in erm premier economy i think
S0523	mm mm
S0489	and there be a mother and a little girl
S0523	mm
S0489	the little girl be sort of sit between us
S0523	mm
S0489	and all the way this little girl be stuff you know sweets and crisp and god know what you know i'm think to myself oh you know i don't like this
S0523	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0489	and we weren't far off land probably an hour before land or so
S0523	mm hm
S0489	and i look across at her and she be green
S0523	oh no oh no
S0489	and i think oh god you know and she sort of look at me and i think don't look at me and she look at her mother and she and and then it come up you know
S0523	oh no
S0489	and just fortunately she face her mother rather than me
S0523	oh no
S0489	so her mother get it all over her
S0523	oh no
S0489	all over her
S0523	oh no
S0489	and i felt so sorry for her cos she you know she'd take her just the two of them travel together
S0523	yeah mm
S0489	anyway the cabin staff sort of take her off to the toilet and wash her down and whatnot
S0523	mm
S0489	in the end they give her one of these jump suit to wear you know while her clothe be in a big bag and i think to myself yeah it's on balance it's probably worth it to get one of those jumpsuits
S0523	yeah
S0489	but now you just get as i say a cheap t shirt and some
S0486	hi there
S0523	mm
S0489	some trousers so it's not worth it really
S0523	we'll we we we go we go to we go business class to new zealand with korean air and we be impress i be i mean it's the first time i've be business class and erm
S0489	oh right
S0486	oh oh
S0523	and and so erm we've be premium economy and that sort of thing
S0486	yeah
S0523	but but absolutely i couldn't couldn't fault it be absolutely
S0486	oh how marvellous
S0523	absolutely
S0489	yeah
S0486	who be you with british airways
S0523	korean air
S0486	oh korean air right
S0523	ah they be they be oh we be very
S0489	and do they treat you as do they address you by name singapore people do but
S0523	erm they there's a lady who come round and say you know welcome abroad
S0489	yeah
S0523	cos individually so it's like welcome aboard er
S0489	yes yeah
S0523	hope you're you know you know and all that sort of thing all customer nice customer so smart and courteous and everything like that
S0489	yes yes yes
S0486	oh isn't that lovely
S0523	and i think oh this be really you know
S0489	yes the singapore people you get someone meet you at the plane door
S0523	oh right okay
S0489	and immediately greet you oh welcome mr
S0523	oh right right oh right yeah
S0489	you know how they know i don't know but they work it out somehow
S0523	oh yeah
S0489	they've get some mean and you're conduct to your seat here we be take you through it's incredible
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah that that's good yeah
S0489	you don't get that with british airways i'm afraid even in first class i don't think you get that but
S0523	yeah no
S0486	do er do er say we're go first class
S0523	yeah absolutely
S0486	that's it's bizarre isn't it
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	but the only the only that be the only flight available first class well it it erm and in
S0489	it's bank holiday monday you see
S0486	bank holiday monday
S0523	mm
S0489	so they've probably get a few spare seat in first class
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	and on on the way back we're come well he probably say we're come back business class
S0489	business class come back yeah
S0486	so it'll be interest compare the two from my point of view i cos could've do all three then couldn't i
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	well
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	my opinion would be that if you want to sleep and and have a quiet night business class be probably better than first
S0486	right
S0489	that's assume as i as i as i recall the first class seat they're nice and wide
S0486	mm
S0489	but they don't recline absolutely flat
S0486	right
S0489	whereas business class bed do
S0486	oh do they
S0489	well
S0486	well we don't need to lie down flat on the way out
S0489	exactly so
S0486	because we're gonna be there about
S0489	it's the best combination
S0486	we're get there about
S0523	yeah
S0486	two o'clock in the morning or something aren't we
S0489	yeah
S0486	and so it won't be the whole night that we're there
S0523	yeah no
S0489	it it it's the best way round really
S0523	yeah
S0489	first class out and business class back
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	in fact i think that's the way i would choose base on my experience the way
S0523	yeah
S0489	that's the way i would choose
S0523	yeah
S0486	can i ask you something and i know have travel all over the world and things and he say that i won't get anywhere with this but do you think i could ask for a special diet on the plane
S0523	well they do ask for er well you could ask i mean there's no harm in ask and and erm i i you know i i i my there be er usually on the form somewhere it say special request
S0486	yeah
S0523	whether it's erm er you know everything from it erm type of meal to but i would have think first class they would
S0489	first class you can choose whatever you want anyway
S0523	yeah yeah yeah
S0489	if you ask for a special meal all you'll get be some crummy vegetarian option
S0523	yeah erm yeah
S0486	so so you can get them to deliver you a meal and and you get the meal and you can't eat any of it so then you say what else have you get and you keep go through their menu until you get what you want i suppose you could do that on first class couldn't you
S0489	my
S0523	yeah
S0489	one thing i would recommend though
S0486	mm
S0489	and i've do it myself if you're fly back from somewhere and you want to sleep choose the the special option i've i've do this before choose the vegetarian option because you get serve first
S0523	mm
S0489	which mean you can eat your meal put your blindfold on and try and sleep
S0523	mm
S0486	yeah
S0523	whereas the ordinary food take a lot longer
S0486	but the thing be with me it's not like i'm do it because i don't like certain things because it it make me ill
S0523	mm mm mm
S0486	you know if something make you ill by law now if i come in here and i say i don't want any yeast in this
S0523	mm mm
S0486	my my friend's a chef and she's also a nutritionist
S0523	mm
S0486	but she say if you go somewhere and you say i can't tolerate yeast or i can't tolerate this and your ill they're liable
S0523	mm
S0486	there's a law a new law that's come out recently and everyone's a lot more careful now about what they give you
S0523	mm yeah yeah
S0486	but the only problem arise when you have foreign staff serve you who don't understand english properly
S0523	no exactly yeah yeah yeah
S0486	and they say oh good good everything's good you know and you know they're just talk rubbish to you
S0523	mm

S0486	if you have somebody like you know people who can understand english and you you say
S0523	we have yeah i mean
S0486	can i have this and that that waiter who be here just now that one there with glass i say to him can you make sure that there's absolutely no yeast

S0486	erm i don't know whether yeah terribly tasty cos i can't have any any puddings
S0523	mm
S0486	not here but i mean i might try it again today see if the chef can do cos they're ever so helpful very busy at all be they well yes they be now they've get a lot more people down there now yeah mm
S0523	mm and i yeah i know i know on the china tour which be it's really really good i i erm we have a a great time erm but i do know one or two people who have specific dietary request
S0486	really
S0523	erm they be struggle with some of the place
S0489	yeah
S0523	yeah they they really
S0489	yeah
S0523	china be be be in someways it's incredibly advance and in some ways it's way behind you know
S0486	that bad yeah
S0523	so
S0486	i'll tell you i'll tell you what happen at at christmas
S0523	yeah
S0486	i write well in advance and say you know yeast free sugar free gluten free you know

S0489	yeah
S0486	and the chef be on be on a sort of trial
S0523	mm
S0486	and he be try to
S0523	on trial
S0486	trial for murder food and he be on trial
S0523	mm
S0486	the new the manage director or the group company man be er oversee everything in the changeover so this chef be try to impress everybody
S0523	mm
S0486	so everything have to be like a wed banquet
S0523	mm
S0486	and on a wed banquet you don't know what you're get
S0523	mm
S0486	there's a bite of this and a bite of that and a you know and i be really hungry
S0523	mm
S0486	and they say to me they be give me gluten free yeast free bread and now i would query whether i have that because
S0523	mm
S0486	the bread be gorgeous i really enjoy it but when i come back yeast free gluten free bread doesn't taste like that
S0523	mm mm
S0486	it taste like it smell like wet dog
S0523	mm
S0486	and it taste ghastly so erm you know i query that that's what i be have
S0523	mm
S0486	erm but anyway it doesn't matter it didn't seem to do me any harm at the time whatever i be have
S0523	yeah
S0486	they do they do they keep assure me that it be yeast free gluten free but i don't know how they get it to taste like that
S0523	mm mm mm
S0486	because my friend who's a qualify chef and a nutritionist she can't get it to taste like that
S0523	mm
S0486	and it's not it's nothing like the texture
S0523	mm
S0486	i've make it
S0523	mm
S0486	i've make it i've make two lot of bread now and throw them away
S0523	mm

S0523	mm
S0486	and they make and i can't bite through them they're so hard
S0523	mm
S0486	but you know remember
S0523	have mm
S0486	sorry
S0523	have you start google erm because i i i
S0486	yeah i've do all of that yeah
S0523	have you yeah yeah yeah
S0486	yeah i've do all of that
S0489	i think the best thing about first or business class be that you ought to be able to get through a fast channel on security it doesn't always happen but
S0523	yeah yeah yes yes yes
S0489	but usually you can get through a slightly faster channel
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we just walk through
S0486	well what about take
S0489	well yeah
S0523	that be that be that be the nicest nicest amaze
S0489	it er it it do vary
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	i i've be catch you know as bad as anybody else but
S0523	mm hm
S0489	erm normally at least you it you don't have to check in so early
S0523	mm mm
S0489	cos you know it's a good
S0523	well i see well one of the things i i've always think about heathrow be er er you might know heathrow better than i do but i remember as a from school go for our school trip from to heathrow and stand out where you where the you know you use to see the beatles come in you use to be able to wave and go up in the roof and it and it be great i
S0486	oh yeah be that how you imagine yourself
S0489	yeah
S0523	and i
S0486	as a retrograde beatle
S0489	yeah yeah those days be go you can't even go on the roof any more
S0523	no no but but but
S0489	it's all finish
S0523	we go to this lounge erm and i i couldn't believe it we have this lounge and the windows along the side of the lounge overlook the airport
S0489	yeah
S0523	so we could have our we we arrive there early morning so we have our breakfast or you know lunch we have it there about lunchtime so have lunch there which be nicely provide for and we could have as many drink as we i mean i couldn't believe it i have read it on tripadvisor
S0523	but there be there be whisky there be brandy there be wine you could you could be absolutely sozzled
S0489	yeah
S0523	i i be
S0486	yeah and then they and they don't like people go on the plane drink
S0523	yeah i know i
S0486	it's crazy
S0523	but but but have say that they have the nicest coffee so we have a lovely coffee a nice meal and we could watch the plan land and take off and i think that be an absolutely lovely way
S0486	come and go who be this with
S0523	this this be with korean air you see
S0486	oh korean air like korean air
S0523	and and yeah and i i i mean obviously
S0489	yeah yeah i don't think i've fly korean air before but yeah
S0523	the lounge be obviously there be lot of lounge for different company
S0486	mm
S0489	yeah
S0523	erm
S0486	be this when you go to cuba
S0523	this no this be when we'd just be to new zealand
S0486	new zealand oh new zealand oh wow
S0523	yeah yeah yeah it be absolutely fantastic yeah
S0486	really
S0489	yes the british airways lounge at terminal five
S0523	mm
S0489	which be where we shall go be be
S0486	i've be in there with you you take me in there once didn't you
S0489	no not first class not concord lounge i mean that be
S0486	oh i go in a very good lounge with him once
S0523	yeah yeah yeah
S0489	very er i'm not absolutely sure you can see the plan land and take off there but anyway whatever yeah
S0523	mm mm mm mm mm mm it's lovely it's lovely and and and it set i know we could sit in the lounge and i think well if we go there if there's any delay we know that to some extent you're cover er
S0489	oh yeah with british airways lounge most of them you can get hot food
S0523	mm mm mm
S0489	and first class lounge have a full
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	three course meal and it's all free of course it's all whatever you want
S0523	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
S0489	and as you say enough drink
S0523	yeah
S0489	any amount of drink
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	whatever you want which be i think probably i i suspect there's a general fallacy that you fee people drink to relax on a long flight
S0523	mm mm mm mm
S0489	but of course there come a point where
S0523	yes yes yeah
S0489	people like this ryanair business at the moment so yeah
S0523	oh i think we do indulge we have one glass of wine each
S0489	yeah
S0523	but we think we because this be such a long flight it's twelve we be do twelve hours to seoul and then we're do change plan and then there's another twelve hours to auckland so it's
S0489	yeah yeah
S0523	so you you we think we wouldn't want to risk erm you know because they say dehydration and all that sort of thing so
S0486	yeah oh yeah
S0489	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0486	i would i i will never i always use to have a nice glass of wine on the plane i'll never drink on a plane again which be terribly sad but
S0523	mm mm yeah i know
S0489	but the point be of course if you're if you're in a nice lounge it's worth get what food you can
S0523	yeah yeah
S0489	because of course the food on the plane may not be that brilliant
S0523	yeah that that yeah yeah yeah
S0489	and very often in business class you get serve some very good food
S0523	mm
S0489	but it's quite small
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0489	you know you actually end up be quite hungry
S0523	yeah yeah so we
S0486	the yeah the thing be what you've get to do on a plane be to look after your body that's the most important thing you've get to do
S0523	yeah yeah yeah well
S0486	and the only way you can do that be to drink as much water as possible
S0523	yeah
S0486	erm not too much water but
S0523	no no no
S0486	just keep yourself hydrate put fly at that altitude and drink alcohol be be like a kamikaze wish for me
S0523	mm mm mm mm
S0486	my body won't stand it i use to do it and the other thing we find out very soon on i use to love a glass of orange juice
S0523	mm
S0486	i can't drink if i drink orange juice it just burn my stomach anything acid i can't take
S0523	mm mm
S0486	so oh dear
S0489	the thing about aircraft of course as a passenger you never realise be that drop of pressure
S0523	mm
S0486	mm
S0489	which make you very sensitive to our process of dehydration
S0486	yeah yeah
S0523	mm mm
S0489	erm i often think that i must admit but if you go on board with a water bottle and you've drink three quarter of it
S0523	mm
S0489	and there's just a bite leave at the bottom and you put the bottle on the side there obviously the atmospheric pressure in the bottle will take off and after about fifteen minutes this bottle be all right up in front of you
S0489	we'll do it when we fly you'll see
S0486	yeah yeah i don't think i want to i i can understand it
S0489	pressure drop to about a third of the normal atmosphere
S0523	mm
S0489	and you really some people suffer quite bad i i i often get headaches on the plane because of that
S0523	mm mm
S0486	well it affect my sinuses i mean we we go to and i go to once and i just have the most dreadful cold hadn't i it it hadn't go actually
S0523	mm hm no no no
S0486	and we take photograph of ourselves on the beach and we both look as white as sheet
S0486	and i look like i'm well i look really ill
S0523	mm
S0486	and within two or three days in the sun my sinus have go i couldn't hear when we touch down
S0523	mm mm mm mm mm
S0489	yeah some of it be be the brain itself though
S0486	my sinus have go it yeah but but also you know come from a really cold february in england to to a lovely i mean
S0489	yeah yeah
S0486	i be wear summer dress and the maltese keep say ooh you're wear summer dress they be go round in cardigans and winter boot and and to me it be a summer day
S0523	mm mm mm
S0486	and do you remember i've get those photograph we take round the pool and i actually say to the gardener oh it's a bite cold this morning and he say it's okay heat the pool we turn up he say and he turn the heat pool up didn't he ah
S0523	mm yeah yeah lovely it be a very good pool
S0486	oh it be absolutely gorgeous
S0523	that be a good pool
S0486	that be a lovely pool wasn't it
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0486	i'll never forget that because er the reason i don't forget that be because it be such a contrast with mum die in january didn't she
S0523	mm i think so
S0486	and we get we get through the funeral and everything and access this really cheap holiday with wasn't it yes
S0523	wasn't it yeah
S0486	it be and find it and we go off together and erm it be amaze i mean it it it be a contrast to be in virtual hell to be in virtual heaven it be that contrast really
S0523	it be a be yeah yeah yeah and we have i mean exceptionally we have really good weather
S0486	yeah
S0523	it be sunny most of the time of all the time i think
S0486	yeah it be yeah
S0489	it be incredible really to get good weather in in malta because you know i've look at the statistics and it's it's not often very often when you go
S0489	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0486	well we go to we go to for the day and the weather be brilliant there i remember it
S0489	mm
S0523	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0486	and we be on the beach and there be nobody on the beach except for us
S0523	and no no that's right that that be golden beach and there be
S0486	golden beach it be a huge beach it be the most like go the most popular beach wasn't it
S0523	yeah yeah yeah
S0486	because it's call golden beach and it's huge and and i be be sunbathe on our own
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	it be bizarre the whole thing
S0523	it be bizarre yeah it be ah but now i believe i mean i like erm want to go to malta
S0486	yeah oh we we need to go yeah
S0523	er but but but i think i think erm from what i've read you know clearly it's you know it's it's a bite like go back to new zealand thirty years
S0486	yes i know
S0523	be a hell of a long time and think
S0486	i go back
S0523	yeah
S0489	well when we go to a few years ago i mean the mainland malta be just a mad house
S0523	mm really oh right oh right well
S0486	yeah it be yeah it be of course be erm be full of snake and erm
S0489	it be quite desert but it wasn't a terribly good hotel unfortunately
S0486	it be quite desert because it be a extremely hot
S0523	mm
S0486	and they have trouble with animals die the ventilation system
S0489	yeah yeah yeah
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	and the smell in our room be just unbelievable
S0523	oh yeah
S0486	and erm they move us two or three three time didn't we we move three time there be damp in one room so damp and then
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	i think it's one of these place that's close down through the winter they open it up in the summer but they never really properly refurbish it
S0523	mm mm mm mm
S0486	and and and and we
S0489	yeah basically it's overdue for a major

S0486	yeah and there's only one hotel you and might like to try it
S0523	mm
S0489	it's a place that be
S0486	it have that sort of
S0489	overdue overdue for rebuild
S0486	you can walk all over the island jump over the snake
S0489	if it be rebuild it would be fantastic
S0523	yeah yeah yeah

S0489	yeah we have a er
S0486	or be it we go to
S0489	well we do both we have a day trip to and a ah that's funny it's be a bite slow here we go i'm sure it be call the hotel
S0486	it seem like we to tell her that we're not eat in the restaurant i'd better tell somebody

S0523	okay
S0523	well it look very nice

S0486	let's have a look i've forget what it look like
S0523	yeah
S0486	yeah it do look very nice
S0489	let me see how much it be
S0486	i expect that be when it be just build promotional spot shoot about thirty years ago
S0523	yeah yeah yeah
S0489	well to be fair it might be that it's erm well that room look a lot better than we have
S0486	let's have a look no it's just the same when you open the wardrobes up they be full of mould
S0523	mm mm mm a a a lot of a lot of these hotels you know i think by the nature of what they be big hotels they're always refurbish on a regular basis
S0486	yeah they have to
S0523	so they might do one floor
S0486	yeah
S0523	floor
S0489	yeah absolutely
S0523	so it just depend on whether you're lucky to be in the refurbish lot or the other lot you know the ones that be still to be do
S0486	right mm
S0523	and i think that must be a constant
S0489	er well well it's get quite good review
S0523	mm
S0489	absolutely love it we'll be back
S0523	this be and all all the s
S0489	yeah somebody from huddersfield mind average
S0523	yeah
S0486	the food wasn't very good though be it
S0489	no no it be it be a bite basic
S0486	the food wasn't very good at all
S0523	mm
S0486	and i mean really when you consider that everything's buy over on a boat and there's no do your shop
S0523	mm yeah
S0486	oh dear
S0489	talk about the score range from nine point one
S0486	yeah
S0489	to five point eight and there's there's a nought point seven
S0523	oh oh dear
S0486	what do
S0489	positively the worst hotel we have ever stay in completely knackered seventies style
S0486	yeah absolutely
S0489	with wear out stain carpet smell of back up toilets and stale chlorine
S0523	oh no
S0489	the foyer be cold and resemble a railway station
S0489	the food be inedible we be constantly serve leftovers
S0523	mm
S0489	soggy vegetables on the verge of rot angel delight be king here and
S0486	well the food be like very bad butlins
S0489	that be october twenty fourteen so it's
S0523	mm mm
S0486	that must be well that be not long after we go
S0489	no we go about twenty 0 five twenty twenty 0 six something like that it be a long time ago
S0486	well
S0523	mm
S0486	i'm surprise they've get the brass neck to keep go
S0489	this really be an awful experience go at your peril
S0523	mm
S0486	yeah i would say that
S0523	mm mm
S0486	i would say that about the hotel but i wouldn't say that about the island
S0489	this be the this be the thing
S0523	mm
S0489	the next one be excellent eight point five if you want solitude and somewhere just to really chill out this be the place for you
S0523	mm
S0489	bar drink be expensive but i've now be five time
S0486	yeah but you see you don't know what sort of person they might have worse at home
S0489	yeah top tip
S0523	mm hm
S0489	regular free hotel boat to where you should stock up with supply at the supermarket by the port all room have fridges so in other word they obviously go and cater for themselves
S0486	ah well there be a lot of self cater there
S0523	oh right oh yeah
S0486	we be offer weren't we when we finally get to the third bedroom and we couldn't stick it they say they would we like to sleep in a bungalow
S0489	well there be some yeah there be some bungalows there be yeah
S0523	yeah mm
S0489	very date hotel but as long as you know and can see past this this hotel be an amaze set
S0486	it be an amaze set
S0489	stay in the bungalows which be even more date
S0523	mm
S0486	oh really
S0523	mm mm
S0486	oh
S0489	yeah so it's
S0523	well i i that
S0489	it's basic
S0523	yeah i i think the thing to do i mean er if you're if it's a very short break you probably wouldn't want to do this but if it's you know a reasonable length be to go straight to reception
S0486	mm
S0523	on see something and say you know there's this problem with damp or whatever and usually they move you quite quite easily erm most most most hotels i think will do that erm
S0489	yeah
S0486	well we do we they do move us there be
S0489	it be okay but it be
S0486	ah here we be
S0489	yeah
S0486	yeah two chip
