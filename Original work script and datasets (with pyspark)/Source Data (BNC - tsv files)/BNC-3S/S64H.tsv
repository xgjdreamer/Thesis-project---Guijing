S0255	no no i'm joke i'm joke i'm joke it's fine beef and mushroom might be nice
S0257	yeah
S0255	do you like that i like the
S0257	mm
S0255	chinese mushroom
S0257	the straw mushroom
S0255	add it yeah okay so that's twelve fifty so that's enough unless you want anything else with it do you want anything
S0257	no
S0255	no
S0257	no not for me but do you
S0255	just
S0257	want some starters
S0255	no i'm fine i i know it's alright you think this and then you get a couple of bits and no right order now
S0257	i buy a jar of those straw mushroom and i put them in the cupboard
S0255	mm
S0257	with the egg noodles ready for when i do a chinese they be there and do a curry
S0257	a proper indian curry nothing at all chinesy and he and say er oh i couldn't find any fresh mushroom i say no no you need to go and get some do you go and get some he say no i find some in a jar
S0255	oh no
S0257	and i say but they're straw mushroom for chinese he go oh i didn't use them all and there be five in the bottom of the jar
S0257	that he'd leave what be i gonna do with those
S0257	it certainly won't be something with mushroom
S0255	oh i might need to create an account i think i'd do that okay talk amongst yourselves er
S0257	so what do it come to altogether
S0255	twelve fifty i have a look the other night and i be go to do it and then because we be go to get papa luigi pizza
S0257	oh okay
S0255	cos we like it from there and they go on it we then go and try to do it online with their online order
S0257	yeah
S0255	which sound great but actually want to do a erm choose your own
S0257	yeah
S0255	and you there wasn't there wasn't the option to choose pick your own
S0257	oh pant
S0255	and then we go onto this trio treat which be three twelve inch ones off the menu or pick your own so again we couldn't so then i think right okay do margherita with your own toppings and that will be like that and it but and it would have be except it then add all the price of the toppings on top
S0257	oh
S0255	so you didn't get it oh so in the end i ring them up and say okay great idea love the website love the order online but actually there's a slight problem with it and he be like oh i'm really sorry oh i'm ever so sorry oh i'm really sorry and like
S0257	and where be that
S0255	erm papa luigi
S0257	papa luigi
S0255	yeah i like there because i don't er like pizza but it doesn't tend to agree with me that much
S0257	mm
S0255	with my stomach so i like it if i have a nice thin crust
S0257	yeah
S0255	it's not as bad and a lot of place if you get the pizza it's always a real big thick deep crust or
S0257	yeah they're quite stodgy
S0255	where with them you can ask for the yeah ask for the thin crust and it's pretty good so
S0257	mm
S0255	so that's why we tend to get it from there rather than domino's or somewhere
S0257	well we're go out at work for a a meal on friday erm every month
S0255	yeah
S0257	there be eight team eight different departments erm account there's bill there's provision administration so eight different departments
S0255	yeah
S0257	and every month you be give a department and you have to provide feedback
S0255	okay
S0257	on four different point and it's always the same four point but along with feedback you you give the team a score out of ten
S0255	right
S0257	erm and each month the the team with the highest score get to go out for a meal well this september we're september now aren't we august be the final month we're do that we're change it because we've do it for the last year or so and we just like to keep things fresh and different
S0255	yeah
S0257	so er my team have win five out of the last twelve and in fact five out of the last from january january february march april and then august
S0255	yeah
S0257	but for february and march i say to the directors look you know we can't and er it would demotivate other team so we award it to other team erm but this be the very last one and i'm so please cos my girls work so so hard and erm we're go out to there's a new bella italia at
S0255	oh yes i try to go there the other day and it hadn't open
S0257	oh
S0255	we find out when we actually go and try to open the door and the man come out and it it be open
S0257	ah
S0255	and he go erm oh he say we're not actually open yet and we're like oh right okay he say but we do have some vip space for breakfast for next week when we open and my mate say well i'm not from round here and i be like er and and you could see him think it's not gonna happen
S0257	no they're not gonna come
S0255	we'll come when you're open okay bye oh it be funny
S0257	well we be look at the menu today cos er i've not be to a bella italia i tend to in all honesty i tend to avoid chain
S0255	yeah
S0257	erm i prefer little well i i prefer family run place but just just original place but er i be look at the menu for bella italia today and er a lot of pizza restaurants do it now they do a really low fat version and it's like a a pancake thin pizza
S0255	yeah
S0257	these be rectangular ones i guess they're not go to be massive but it'll be enough for lunchtime with erm lot of rocket and things on them rather than cheese although there be
S0255	mm
S0257	be scrap of cheese although i be go for the what be i go for as a starter italiano chicken wing i think it be
S0255	yeah
S0257	so it's like have a it's like have a i don't know a bacardi and diet coke if you're watch the calories
S0257	so i'm gonna have big fat chicken wing and then a then a low calorie pizza
S0255	mm
S0257	with chip
S0255	well we go erm when i be up in go with to prezzo's cos there's a
S0257	yeah
S0255	er there's you know a few different place you can eat there and they do a real nice it's a round pizza really thin base with
S0257	er with a hole in the middle
S0255	yeah the hole in the middle
S0257	yes
S0255	with the salad
S0257	yes
S0255	and we have that and it be really nice really tasty
S0257	yeah
S0255	really tasty
S0257	we'd erm exchange some tesco vouchers on a couple of occasion for prezzo although we think we we've wear out the menu now there wasn't
S0255	mm
S0257	in all honesty there wasn't a massive amount that i would have choose cos i don't like just normal run of the mill
S0255	no

S0255	yeah
S0257	and you can't eat any chip either
S0255	yeah
S0257	so you've just gotta eat your wing
S0255	yeah
S0257	i'll give you five pound
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i say fiver you know it's not worth it
S0255	no
S0257	that's gonna really hurt
S0255	yeah
S0257	that's why you have coleslaw cos it cool your mouth down
S0255	yeah
S0257	as you're eat them and she have tear run down her face
S0255	oh
S0257	and she be it's for a fiver it's for a five and of course at the end of it
S0255	yeah
S0257	go yeah well i be only kid
S0257	and so we have this massive argument
S0255	wow
S0257	at 's birthday meal
S0255	oh dear mm no i must admit i mean these weren't and we that be we weren't allow to have drink in between or anything i mean it be just a load of things
S0257	mm
S0255	wing but er you know they weren't and i actually have whatever i have be the hot whatever and it wasn't that hot i remember we come back here one night after the beer festival and a load of people come round and we all have curry
S0257	yeah
S0255	and always have really mild curry and be take the mickey out of her na na na you don't eat so she be say look it's not that i can't eat a hot curry i just don't like it she say i like the flavour but i don't anything too hot she say i don't like the sensation in my mouth you know
S0257	mm
S0255	not and he be go oh right you have some of this i'll he have a phall cos in somebody like oh we're gonna have a phall have a phall yeah right so we're have this phall so you eat some of this say you have five mouthfuls
S0257	they're they're so macho
S0255	oh i know i know you have have some of this and i'll give you twenty quid you know and he say well in fact i'll give you what have i get in my pocket and he pull out all his change yeah it be seventeen pound eighty six
S0255	and so she go yeah alright he say you've gotta have about five mouthfuls yeah alright she say and she just eat it she didn't flinch she didn't do anything she just eat it eat it eat it so there you be satisfy she say i can eat them i just don't like the sensation
S0257	yeah
S0255	i don't she doesn't like anything too sweet too spicy erm too sour anything like that and i actually saw something a programme on something and it be talk about people who have the the supertasters
S0257	right
S0255	erm and it's this be how obviously how your taste bud be make
S0257	yeah
S0255	but you taste things more concentrate almost than other people so something that you would taste and it's really sweet they taste it as extremely sweet
S0257	mm
S0255	so that it make sense because i'll eat the the sweetest stickiest sickliest puddings and i'll have second and go back for thirds she'll eat half a bowl of it because she say it it's just it's too er like overwhelm too much
S0257	yeah
S0255	and so i think that it might be that with her
S0257	oh
S0255	i think she might be one of these supertasters
S0257	yeah possibly then
S0255	mm so she say she'd be quite good go in as like a taste thing for something like have a job do that
S0257	yeah
S0255	like the perfume smellers or somebody who's who taste things
S0257	yeah yeah
S0255	but she say she'd actually sort of get the extreme thing of you know of the taste so
S0257	see i'm i can eat very hot food but like i prefer i prefer to taste what i'm eat
S0255	yeah
S0257	so when we make our our curry we do put a lot of spice in but we put er them in there for flavour as well as heat
S0255	mm
S0257	and we always have chilli in there but it it's always for the taste
S0255	yeah oh
S0257	and i don't understand these people that have to have always have to have the hottest to prove a point because they're not
S0255	yeah
S0257	necessarily enjoy
S0255	no
S0257	it as much as they might enjoy something else
S0255	mm
S0257	and erm when it come to things to to sweets i really like sour sweets i've i've
S0255	yeah oh i do yeah
S0257	get more of a sour palette
S0255	yeah
S0257	erm i think i take after my mum as well because mum grow up in in malta they use to have a lemon tree in the garden
S0255	mm
S0257	and she be pick a lemon peel it and eat it
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i i seem to have more of a favour to the to the sour taste
S0255	mm
S0257	than the sweet taste
S0255	yeah
S0257	whilst i love sweets and chocolate i can't eat things like minstrel er not minstrel sorry maltesers cos i find them too sweet
S0255	really
S0257	and i and i i won't eat them
S0255	i eat a whole bagful
S0257	oh yeah
S0255	if i have the big bag to share i'll sit and eat a whole bag of that
S0257	well i will with chocolate
S0255	yeah
S0257	so it's minstrel or
S0255	yeah
S0257	or whatever it might mandm's
S0255	i suppose the honeycomb
S0257	as well
S0255	it's that particular that sweet
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	erm i make a a big cake on friday for work for erm macmillan cancer fundraise
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	and it be four layer of fatless sponge
S0255	right
S0257	no butter in it
S0255	oh i saw the picture on facebook yeah
S0257	it be er it be low calorie sponge
S0255	yeah
S0257	with all the cream and chocolate fudge ice and chocolate things all around the side
S0255	cream chocolate fudge ice and
S0257	yeah but it be a fat free sponge
S0257	and i put minstrel on the top and maltesers
S0255	mm
S0257	and i have a slice at work and i couldn't eat that i just leave all the maltesers and people be go oh god you're not eat them but you love chocolate you're a real chocoholic
S0255	yeah
S0257	yeah but i don't like the middle bite
S0255	yeah
S0257	and erm the other sweet things i don't that i'm not keen on erm ice cream but i think it's the cold rather than the sweet
S0255	mm
S0257	cos i'll make my own ice cream
S0255	yeah
S0257	and 's diabetic so i make some ice cream the other day and i make it with er evaporate milk
S0255	mm
S0257	and it be just evaporate milk and cream and i didn't put any sugar in it and i say taste this and i actually think it taste quite nice it be almost savoury
S0255	yeah
S0257	and he say it taste like cheese
S0257	and i have another taste and i kind of get what he's where he be come from
S0255	yeah like like a dairy taste
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i think but that's actually nice
S0255	yeah
S0257	i like it so whilst i can eat chocolate er
S0255	mm
S0257	i can't eat bournville cos it's too sweet and yet
S0255	mm
S0257	i love dark chocolate
S0255	yeah yeah yeah i i know what you mean
S0257	but it have to be quite bitter
S0255	yeah so like the green and black's ones
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	mm but i do love i do love i do enjoy sweet things
S0255	yeah
S0257	but i'm more more savoury i think
S0255	so would you do you eat sugar as in sugar cub cos that's sweet like as in the brown
S0257	i
S0255	you know when you're when like in the café cos they're
S0257	yeah if i do a yeah i'll sometimes
S0255	yeah
S0257	have the brown sugar cube because it's not as sweet as the white i find but
S0255	yeah
S0257	i think it's more nostalgia
S0255	mm
S0257	cos we use to do it as children
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	it be such a treat you know when the little sugar cub come in er
S0255	mm
S0257	paper wrappers didn't they if you go to the
S0255	yes
S0257	a café like woolies
S0255	yeah
S0257	café
S0255	yeah
S0257	mum would have a cup of tea or coffee
S0255	i love woolies
S0257	on a saturday
S0255	the café yeah
S0257	and erm they'd always put sugar cub on the tray or they'd be on the table or something
S0255	yeah
S0257	and can i have a sugar cube can i have a sugar cube can i have a sugar cube
S0255	yeah
S0257	and you'd unwrap it and there'd be these
S0255	well i still do now i
S0257	two little gems
S0255	when you're place like that you know i just you sort of think i'll sit there and you think oh you're in a café and they always say don't because of all the stuff you're touch and other people touch it and things like that
S0257	yeah
S0255	but i just sit and i think oh now just eat them
S0257	it er for me like i say it's nostalgia
S0255	yeah
S0257	you use to do it as children and it's one thing that
S0255	mm
S0257	it just take you back for that instant of be a child again
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	i think something else that i do at the moment and i can only put it back to childhood cos otherwise it make me a big daft
S0257	my coat that i wear to walk at the moment
S0255	mm
S0257	be full bulge of the pocket of conkers
S0255	mm
S0257	i can't resist pick up conkers and stuff them in my pocket and we do do it for a practical reason cos like to chase them she'll chase them
S0255	yeah
S0257	bite them in half and spit them out again
S0255	mm
S0257	so we'll start off the walk and i'm throw conkers but as we pass under the chestnut tree
S0255	yeah
S0257	i have to fill i have to wait wait a minute i can't there's too many to pick up you're gonna have to carry some of these
S0257	and er i i literally have my pocket cram and i'm carry as many as i can carry in my hand and i'm look back at all the ones that i leave on the grind think what a shame
S0255	you need to start take a bag
S0257	god no
S0255	or take the bag with you and just
S0257	but the thing be the logical part of my head be say don't be stupid there'll be there tomorrow when you take out again
S0255	yeah but somebody else like you might come past
S0257	but the
S0255	and pick them all up
S0257	yeah yeah the nine year old in me be think
S0255	yeah
S0257	there's a big one and i go to look at the size of this

S0255	mm
S0257	and you don't need
S0255	no
S0257	expensive equipment and
S0255	no
S0257	my dad use to make so much for us i remember so proud cos i be a bite of a tomboy
S0255	mm
S0257	see the girls think i be weird i guess
S0255	mm
S0257	walk up and down with my pram pull hedge to piece
S0257	but my dad make me a rifle and
S0255	mm
S0257	do you know it be the simplest i think it be just a a square or a wooden dowelling maybe
S0255	right
S0257	bite of wooden dowelling
S0255	yeah
S0257	and a and a flat bite for the erm sort of the handle and a bend nail for the trigger
S0255	yeah
S0257	that's that's
S0255	yeah
S0257	all it be it be like three things
S0255	mm
S0257	maybe a little bite more i be so chuff with this rifle
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i remember i could i couldn't have be much more than about seven cos it be in the summer
S0255	mm
S0257	and of course we have fantastic summer every day be wonderful wasn't it
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	and all i only have my jeans on and some sandals
S0257	so i be topless
S0255	yeah
S0257	cos this be how much of a tomboy i be
S0255	yeah
S0257	so i can't really have be realistically more than about seven i don't suppose
S0255	yeah
S0257	and to have this rifle
S0255	yeah
S0257	that's just amaze it be the best toy ever
S0255	mm
S0257	but my mum use to work erm in the even again to escape us
S0257	erm there use to be a toy company in call
S0255	right
S0257	erm around area where that be now
S0255	okay yeah yeah
S0257	and they use to make er plastic toy and it would be things like erm and my sisters and i all remember we have erm plastic saucepans but they be different colour and different size
S0255	yeah
S0257	they all have face on them
S0255	oh yeah i remember them
S0257	so she use to er be able to buy these quite
S0255	mm
S0257	cheap at you know
S0255	yeah
S0257	a staff discount so we have load of plastic toy and i suppose then in the when be i bear so in the early seventies she start work there a bite before maybe before i be bear even but in that era the late sixties early seventies plastic toy be just come in
S0255	mm

S0255	oh yeah
S0257	new and modern and so we be really really chuff to have all these amaze new toy
S0255	mm
S0257	and they probably even with the staff discount and things they probably cost a hefty amount of money at the time but
S0255	so she be probably just work to earn the money to get
S0257	yeah yeah
S0255	the toy for you to play with
S0257	i think actually i don't think that's that's far from wrong
S0255	mm
S0257	well because she start it be it be a christmas job it be the year i be bear actually i be bear in april sixty nine and i think she start it as a christmas job for that

S0255	mm
S0257	and she stay there for i don't know now a little while anyway

S0255	oh less than two
S0257	ah
S0255	so she would walk along and but it be it be up and down it be a terrace street so it wasn't so bad it be i use to go up and down these two terrace streets that join on to each other and i'd i'd work out if you're gonna come and do your avon you know when someone drop a book through the door and you don't know when they're come back and it so i have a real set routine it be every three weeks
S0257	mm
S0255	so i go out the very first time and i have a little note and it say i'm just start to do that i'll be come to collect this book on that day and i will give you the next book then and you know or so that sort of thing so i go round and knock and do it on all the doors and you know if you don't want to be disturb leave it outside so there be lot of book on the outside and some of them have little note thank you don't want to have it

S0257	at the same time
S0255	so i'd be drop off the stuff they'd order collect the book and give the new book so everybody know every three weeks and especially in the run up to christmas
S0257	mm
S0255	you know it get people know them and they start sort of buy this stuff

S0255	yeah

S0257	yeah
S0255	like every time i look at it i be so pig sick of it cos all i have do be do this knit and then it be take so long and then it wasn't right and then and er yeah
S0257	yeah i know what you mean

S0257	yeah
S0255	other time you can be in in a really like big company and actually there's a lot more of everybody try to get involve
S0257	yeah
S0255	in do things so it just depend you know where you be oh i see that's why oh sorry just bear with me the telly play up you get so use to everything just happen and do things and then but it's try to record things you have to then choose what you're do and
S0257	oh
S0255	your brain go to meltdown cos you're so use to just press button and
S0257	mm
S0255	everything's alright
S0257	we often don't even put our tv on you know
S0255	mm i tend to just have it on erm
S0257	bite of background
S0255	yeah music more than anything oh no never mind it's go
S0257	we've be have trouble with our broadband recently
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i say to well look we've get our broadband and phone with talktalk
S0255	yeah
S0257	we've get our tv through sky through virgin
S0255	yeah
S0257	and it seem to be go up gradually little bite here little bite there
S0255	mm oh yeah
S0257	admittedly it's sky sport that go up all we tend to watch be things like watch a few bits on dave erm a lot of bbc erm watch a lot of sky sport we don't watch we don't have movies because we just don't watch them
S0255	mm
S0257	er he's get so many between us we've go so many dvds
S0255	yeah
S0257	i think he bring three hundred dvds from dublin when he come
S0255	oh
S0257	so we've get a lot of that sort of thing
S0255	mm
S0257	erm so we don't have it and i i've say i'm sure if we pile it all together we can get it cheaper if we put our tv broadband and phone line
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	and company tend to bend over backwards to get you because
S0255	mm
S0257	they want you to have everything with them
S0255	yeah
S0257	so i start look and there's some company we don't have a tv aerial and my first port of call be talktalk cos they've be advertise about their new television package they're do
S0255	mm
S0257	and i say well you need a tv aerial and i go oh well you know that's that's tough then really i think i'd already price it just in case and i and i say i'd be tell it's about a hundred and twenty pound
S0255	right
S0257	er and he say well what if we pay ninety of that straight off what if we pay ninety would you stay with us
S0257	and like i say well you've give me something to think about it i'll have to go away and think about it which we do and then i think well i'm gonna have to take a day off work
S0255	mm
S0257	to wait for some aerial man to come along to install it
S0255	who probably won't turn up
S0257	yeah erm so i'm look at sky now i be with sky before i move house but on the day of my move the phone line be fine
S0255	mm
S0257	and i'd ring up and i'd give them all the detail about the phone the broadband and the tv so the phone be no the tv be fine but have no phone or broadband and they say well you didn't order it i say i do i do it all at the same time how come my tv be work absolutely fine
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i this woman be so obnoxious that i ask to speak to her supervisor and the supervisor be so downright rude
S0255	mm
S0257	i say look i be prepare to sort of wait a little bite i say i've be a customer for how long at that time fifteen years i'm really loyal i'm a loyal
S0255	yeah
S0257	loyal customer
S0255	yeah
S0257	i've be a customer for about fifteen years i say but your attitude have absolutely put me off i've never be unhappy with the service from sky but your personal attitude
S0255	mm
S0257	have now lose you a customer
S0255	yeah
S0257	and she didn't apologise nothing she she just keep say to me well you didn't do it properly you didn't order it you didn't order
S0255	mm
S0257	er i do
S0255	mm
S0257	i know i do
S0255	the thing be when you ring a call centre if you ask to speak to a supervisor you just get put onto another person at the call centre
S0257	mm
S0255	that
S0257	yeah
S0255	they just say yeah i'm the supervisor
S0257	it's another voice isn't it
S0255	yeah exactly
S0257	yeah that's it
S0255	mm
S0257	precisely
S0255	mm well no we have sky erm 's have it sort of since day one
S0257	mm
S0255	and he's always have the full package cos you know he's he's biggest be best you have this you do you know
S0257	mm
S0255	etcetera although more recently he's start to look and go well actually you know it cos it like you say it keep go up and go up
S0257	mm
S0255	and all of sudden we're pay oh eighty odd pound a month
S0257	mm
S0255	we've get the second box which mean well when and be here they could watch it in another room whereas now
S0257	yeah
S0255	just use it all the time
S0257	yeah
S0255	but then we take it to the caravan in the summer when we go backwards and forward at the weekend we take it with us and we actually take it over to france now when we go over to there and we have it over there so
S0257	yeah
S0255	i think fair enough you know we we be use it so it's worth have a second box
S0257	yeah
S0255	but erm when you whenever he ring and say you know this be ridiculous it's so expensive i'm i think i'm gonna cancel it they then say oh well we'll give you a discount rate for so long or knock some money off and do that
S0257	mm
S0255	but the way they've set the package up if you have all of them except for the movies you might as well have the movies as well or if you just cancel cos you have to cancel almost all of it and go down to a basic package
S0257	yes
S0255	for it to be a lot cheaper
S0257	well that's what we start look at i think it say
S0255	mm
S0257	you go up eight eight channel be it so you you still get all your terrestrial channel
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	and you still get all the free to view ones
S0255	mm
S0257	but then there be something like eight very basic ones and i say to that would probably do us and he say
S0255	mm
S0257	as long as i get this this this
S0255	yeah
S0257	i'm happy and it literally be about three different channel
S0255	mm
S0257	along with the sport package and i couldn't particularly think of anything it's very rare that i'll say oh i wanna watch that
S0255	mm
S0257	and if i do it's something like dara o briain school of hard sum or
S0255	yeah
S0257	the science one that he do or great british bake off
S0255	yeah mm we tend to find
S0257	very easily lose
S0255	we take watch some of the sport but he get so annoy because you have to pay so much money for sky sport
S0257	mm
S0255	because it's mainly for premier football
S0257	mm
S0255	he doesn't watch football he doesn't like it
S0257	oh
S0255	i don't like it so we're pay all this money for this premier football
S0257	mm
S0255	but you have to have that because they split everything else on all the other ones so you have to end up you know you can't just have one of the sport things
S0257	no
S0255	you have to have all the sport ones
S0257	that's it it's five or six or seven channel i think
S0255	mm
S0257	include sky er sport news
S0255	yeah and when you want to watch something like the ice hockey you have to subscribe to that which he doesn't cos he say that's just a step too far
S0257	yeah
S0255	erm but now the bike race the motogp
S0257	mm
S0255	that's on bt sport
S0257	mm
S0255	so cos we have bt as the landline we've get well we've get broadband with them as well you know and we get that for free but you think well if we do excuse me if we didn't you know you'd end up have to pay more for that
S0257	yeah see that's something we get free at the moment
S0255	mm
S0257	but we'll sit of an even and go through however many hundred channel there be
S0255	yeah
S0257	and there's nothing
S0255	nothing i know
S0257	absolutely nothing that we want to watch
S0255	mm no we find the same
S0257	we do have quite different taste mind you so there might be something
S0255	yeah you'll watch
S0257	of a and i think oh i'd watch that no and it be do i wanna sit with him moan
S0257	see if i'm not interest in watch something i'll just pick up my knit
S0255	mm
S0257	if he's not interest in something he'll pick up a book
S0255	yeah
S0257	or more often than not he'll pick up a guitar
S0257	and just sort of sit and so i'm try to watch
S0257	and i've get the all this noise and he doesn't quite see it as that
S0255	can't he plug the guitar in and have headphones on

S0255	no
S0257	and i be er it seem to be a group of about twenty of us would all sort of be in tune
S0255	mm
S0257	not that we all think the same but we'd be quite happy to have a bite of a debate

S0255	yeah
S0257	and then he go back to dublin and we carry on message and i don't know we just sort of get more we get to know each other more and the more we get to know each other the more we like each other
S0255	mm
S0257	and that be it then really it all start off like that so it's everybody else's fault apart from mine
S0255	be that what he tell you
S0257	mm
S0255	mm apart from him
S0257	mm
S0255	no mm
S0257	mm we be quite chalk and cheese i don't think you've meet him have you
S0255	no i think i've see picture on facebook

S0255	mm
S0257	i think erm have meet him at a at a beer festival but erm no i don't think you be there
S0255	no
S0257	at that particular one on that occasion anyway
S0255	mm so where do you you live then when you meet him in
S0257	mm
S0255	mm
S0257	yeah i've always live apart from when i've i mean i be marry and live in germany when the girls
S0255	mm
S0257	be each bear out there
S0255	yeah
S0257	we come back to each time as well
S0255	oh right
S0257	so all my family be here
S0255	mm
S0257	not say that i wouldn't move and we actually do say a couple of years ago when the children have finish school which they both have now 's at college but
S0255	yeah
S0257	not at school then we'd think about move somewhere maybe a little bite closer to cambridge
S0255	yeah
S0257	cos 's so much into his music he can't find reliable like mind musicians around
S0255	mm
S0257	those that he have sort of have conversations with and even some that he do form a band with briefly they be more cambridge side
S0255	yeah
S0257	they be a lot closer to cambridge
S0255	mm
S0257	er and he doesn't drive either which doesn't help he can and he we're on l plat and i get him insure and he drive home from work every day
S0255	oh right
S0257	but he doesn't have a licence
S0255	right
S0257	and oh well he have a provisional licence
S0255	yeah obviously yeah
S0257	yeah well he can't drive himself put it that way
S0255	yeah
S0257	so i have to fetch and carry him
S0255	mm
S0257	and i'm so busy work now i keep say to him i'm you be and he desperately want to get a licence pass his test
S0255	yeah
S0257	get his licence get a car
S0255	yeah
S0257	but he also want music equipment so he's just pay out two hundred and something odd pound for a second hand amp which be a really good price but that's money that
S0255	mm
S0257	it in my head he could have put towards
S0255	could have go to yeah
S0257	drive lessons or
S0255	mm
S0257	pass his theory test or
S0255	yeah
S0257	something to get him on the road to drive
S0255	yeah
S0257	cos i'm not gonna be take him everywhere i can't
S0255	no no
S0257	and he'll
S0255	and particularly if you've get your the party that you're do
S0257	mm
S0255	that always be go to take precedence isn't it
S0257	absolutely definitely yeah and he'll be miss out
S0255	mm
S0257	and at the moment when they're rehearse they only go to and when he set up the first rehearsal i say brilliant can any of them give you a lift he say oh no i can't really ask i say but have you tell them you don't have a vehicle
S0255	mm
S0257	you're reliant on lift he say well no it's not not their business i say but you've be in band where people have say to you i'll be come in on the train can you pick me up at the train station
S0255	yeah
S0257	and take me
S0255	mm
S0257	i say what's the difference between you say i do rely on for a lift if i'm stick
S0255	yeah
S0257	you know where do you live be be anybody pass my front door can i share petrol money or something
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	cos he's get no common sense or logic he doesn't think to ask these question
S0255	but 's very much like that though with er he'd go out of his way to help anybody bend over backwards do anything for anybody
S0257	mm
S0255	but he won't think where to me something be quite logical that if someone's come past here and we're go somewhere and they've say at other time if we want a lift if we say oh we're go to you know do you you know can you pick us up or do you wanna pop it off drop it off as you you know somebody that work in town and drive out this way to go to to go home
S0257	yeah
S0255	and we're go to bring us something i i'll you know so i i for me i'll be say do you wanna drop it off on the way to or from work let me know when and i'll be here
S0257	mm
S0255	whereas he'll be like oh no no we can't say that we need to go
S0257	it's impose on them
S0255	yeah we we need to arrange to go and pick it up and it er and yes i'd be quite happy to go and pick it up but i know the people that we'd be deal with at the time would be more than happy but actually say why do you say do that why er
S0257	yeah
S0255	of course i can drop it off
S0257	yeah
S0255	you know why why wouldn't i do that
S0257	they're more than happy
S0255	mm yeah exactly er cos i just logically think well it would make sense if we do that and that or if they do that or we do this
S0257	mm
S0255	or he won't oh no we can't ask we mustn't no no no and then
S0257	aren't men
S0255	we put ourselves out yeah put ourselves out really put ourselves out just to get something do to sort something to do something something which probably to help somebody else anyway
S0257	yeah
S0255	when actually why don't we just do that
S0257	too logical
S0255	mm oh i really enjoy that food
S0257	mm there's still lamb but i think i'm very full now
S0255	yeah yeah i must admit i think taste wise i could quite easily eat another plateful
S0257	mm
S0255	cos of the think of put it in my mouth and enjoy the taste of it but actually i know my stomach be definitely full
S0257	yeah yeah mine be
S0255	mm
S0257	mine's very confuse at the moment
S0255	mm well 's skate tonight er so she may
S0257	where's she go
S0255	erm at the the ice rink
S0257	mm
S0255	yeah up at so she may appear back she's do erm she do i tell you she's do this assistant coach or start to work towards be an assistant coach
S0257	no
S0255	yeah well cos she she love do the skate
S0257	mm
S0255	and she's really good particularly if they have young kid there erm you know cos she's so good with kid anyway so she's really good at help and her coach say to her she ought to put in to be this assistant coach and the way it work be you have to pay so much to register for do it and then
S0257	right
S0255	you log all your hours and basically your coach or there's a couple of coach there sort of teach you how
S0257	how to teach
S0255	how to teach as such
S0257	mm
S0255	but a lot of it's do it when they're have lessons or learn to skate or various things like that so you're there help and say that her the two coach that she do the stuff with be really really good some coach would just sign people's hours off and it's like your right you've do the hours on this course thingy as such you've do the time and therefore you're an assistant coach
S0257	yeah
S0255	whereas these two be both very right so you've do that and that what do you think how do they do it like well how would you explain that maybe they need to do what do oh well how do you know and and her get her
S0257	they're push her to think about it a bite more
S0255	yeah to think about it and she's very good at do things and explain anyway so she's she's really enjoy it and
S0257	oh good
S0255	i think you have to log about a hundred hours so it'll be a long time before she'll actually be
S0257	yeah
S0255	assistant coach and i don't you she get pay for be it either it's just that she can then go and and do and do stuff as such
S0257	yeah good for her
S0255	erm mm yeah it be like she's she's really enjoy it
S0257	one of the ladies i know through events that i do her daughter play erm you know it be her daughter she do a lot of ice skate and
S0255	mm
S0257	erm but she play ice hockey
S0255	oh yeah

S0257	mm
S0255	or play erm mahjong i've get
S0257	yeah
S0255	erm get the mahjong game and i play i play that why have that go on there play that on my computer i've actually or on the ipad i actually find a erm a a really good one i use to play years ago and then i find it once you've do it you know and you go through it and you've do it
S0257	yeah
S0255	and and it be alright but erm then i every er now and then i'd find one and try it and it be just be so easy you'd sort of and it wasn't worth it whereas i've just find this one now and it's absolutely brilliant it's one of these ones that pop up on facebook you might like to play it idea
S0257	mm
S0255	and most of the time i just ignore them cos i'm not interest but i think oh i'll i'll have a go on this and i'd i usually play about one game and then i think no it's not worth it start to do it and it's actually call a thousand and one mahjong so it's sort of like there's a thousand and one puzzle and it just go on and
S0257	oh
S0255	oh and i'm work through and i'm on about a hundred and something now
S0257	and and how do it work do you be it actually the game of mahjong
S0255	yeah
S0257	the proper
S0255	well as in the match
S0257	with the four side
S0255	no it's
S0257	oh
S0255	no no it's not that it's erm it it's all the tile place at a
S0257	yes so it it's
S0255	yeah
S0257	match two tile
S0255	no er they're all face up erm but some be in stack in tile
S0257	in different layer
S0255	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	so then you match and you match and you match and and you can obviously only match the ones that haven't get any touch
S0257	yes
S0255	so i don't know how do you play the proper mahjong then
S0257	the it's so incredibly difficult i buy a set years and years and years ago before the children be bear and
S0255	mm
S0257	friends of ours know how to play and they have a set as well
S0255	mm
S0257	and it's it you it's a bite like poker i suppose
S0255	right
S0257	you sit with four of you and you you the and a bite like scrabble as well in that you you have so many tile but you do you do have a a bite of a a wall as far as i remember with layer of tile
S0255	yeah
S0257	but then you have some in your hand as well and it it's to do with make the set so you've get the four wind you've get
S0255	yeah
S0257	north south east west
S0255	yeah
S0257	you've get the four season
S0255	yes
S0257	you've get flower that
S0255	yeah
S0257	i think there be a lotus a lily i can't remember
S0255	yeah
S0257	what the others be
S0255	we use to have mahjong card
S0257	so the same as as the tile
S0255	you use to read them so
S0257	oh okay
S0255	yeah so yeah
S0257	so it it be all about and what do you have the circle the bamboo stick
S0255	yeah
S0257	i can't remember what the others be but it be all about sort of match them and create set
S0255	mm
S0257	and i and i it be so complicate and
S0255	yeah
S0257	all the tile as well they don't all say what they be on them
S0255	no no
S0257	the ones i have
S0255	and you've get ones that actually be part of a set but they don't look like they be cos they look different and
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	the set that i have didn't like it didn't all the east wind for example
S0255	mm
S0257	it didn't say east it just have a chinese symbol on it
S0255	yeah
S0257	and the and the north wind didn't say north it have a chinese symbol on it so i i think
S0255	i'll show you this
S0257	we only maybe play a couple of time with the friends that have it and yet i have this beautiful set it wasn't erm ivory it be plastic and it look cos i wouldn't ever have buy ivory but it it look very beautiful but it be a it be really lightweight and just didn't know what to do with them just could not remember how to play but i like the the
S0257	mahjong game that you get on on your phone as well where you
S0255	yeah like
S0257	like the same one
S0255	oh yeah the match one
S0257	exactly the same one you're describe
S0255	yeah just just i'll start this i don't it i don't think it sync right i i don't really play it on this one cos it's so so like that
S0257	oh yeah yes
S0255	and and you just you go through it and then you just match off the ones
S0257	yes so you can do the top ones or the very outside
S0255	yeah
S0257	where where you can sort of slide them away without
S0255	yeah that's it so you just match up the ones oh go away with that so that you do well that that one it's so tiny here and then you could do it with that one cos they so they match
S0257	yeah
S0255	erm and i can't see this be why i don't play it on her cos it's too little
S0257	you've get well the four there erm four there
S0255	so yeah yeah that's it
S0257	yeah
S0255	so then you go and we're and when you when you're do it erm obviously it get harder and harder and they get so it's less easy to to see them as you go through but
S0257	mm
S0255	i play it on the ipad and as i say the the phone it's just ridiculous you can't
S0257	mm
S0255	you can't see
S0257	yeah too tiny
S0255	yeah but i i play it on the ipad and i i i really enjoy it and you can go back and retry the level so any of them that i'm i'm over about six minutes on
S0257	mm
S0255	i'll go back in and there's some where you know
S0257	try and beat yourself
S0255	you just go oh yeah really hard but no i'm really enjoy it and i'm think i think i'm on a hundred and something and it's like i've get hundreds to go
S0257	yeah how will
S0255	and i'm sure that by the time i get to the end they'll they'll add more on and oh
S0257	yeah
S0255	i just love it find it really relax
S0257	i sometimes find though whilst it be a relax i'll sometimes think oh god an hour's go
S0255	yeah
S0257	what a waste i could have be do this or this
S0255	oh
S0257	or read or that or the other
S0255	no but it's it's you time though
S0257	yeah
S0255	it's not a waste of of your time it's you do something to just
S0257	nothing something and nothing
S0255	yeah yeah no i i do i never think that i use to sometimes think oh i you know i shouldn't do it for too long because i need to be do this but there's always stuff you need to do sometimes i just think
S0257	of course there be
S0255	actually i'm gonna sit
S0257	take a
S0255	and have a few go of this
S0257	yeah
S0255	so
S0257	oh thank you for the chocolates
S0255	one more there's only four in the box
S0255	but yeah mm
S0257	oh what a shame nobody else could come and join us
S0257	and share it to share in our chocolates
S0255	we need to hide the evidence before
S0257	yeah
S0255	come back cos if she's back soon
S0257	oh there you be when she come in and we've both get
S0255	didn't you save me one
S0257	both get mouth cover in chocolate hi
S0255	mm
S0257	you be eat chocolate who me
S0255	certainly can't erm certainly can't sort of finish it too quick if she come in i wouldn't be able to just
S0257	mm
S0255	swallow it right now i've just get to savour it
S0257	put it in your hand hide it under the table
S0255	save it for later
S0257	mm
S0255	mm
S0255	mm it's nice
S0257	mm i think it's the sort of thing you you relish
S0255	mm
S0257	isn't it
S0255	yeah oh yes
S0257	have you ever have erm hotel chocolat their chocolates
S0255	mm
S0257	have you see the taste box they do
S0255	no
S0257	they're brill
S0255	yeah
S0257	particularly if two of you particularly love chocolates it's er a monthly or every two months or three months you choose how
S0255	mm
S0257	or weekly you choose a frequency and they come in a long box
S0255	yeah
S0257	about that wide that go through your letter box
S0255	right
S0257	so there be at least two of every chocolate in it if they're very small chocolates or little batons of chocolate there there might be
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	four or six of them even
S0255	mm
S0257	and there's a big old assortment and you get a card with it there's lot of paper with it you get a little card with it and it's a score card
S0255	oh right
S0257	and it show you a picture of the chocolate and you have to score one to ten
S0255	mm
S0257	and then you can go online and you can put your score in along with everybody else's
S0255	yeah
S0257	but it tell you where the cocoa originate from what country or what region of that country and who the chocolatier be that's create this some of them have alcohol you you can go for the box that have no alcohol or they're all
S0255	mm
S0257	milk chocolate or some be plain and some have
S0255	yeah
S0257	alcohol and a real mix
S0255	mm
S0257	erm and the idea be it's just a little a little soupcon of chocolate
S0257	and it might be all so praline and ganache or a soft cream in the middle or and they're
S0255	yeah
S0257	just such high quality as well
S0255	mm
S0257	and you're mean to just save them you know maybe bite them in half so you can see what you're eat as well as
S0255	yeah
S0257	taste it
S0255	yeah
S0257	and we've have them a couple of time and i really appreciate chocolate and i appreciate it's like it's like i keep say to but it's like wine a different grape from a different area
S0255	yeah
S0257	give you a different flavour and he'll sit there and he'll just go shove
S0255	shove it in
S0257	what be that
S0255	and chew swallow
S0257	oh oh god you didn't even taste it
S0257	what do it taste like and like i dunno chocolate
S0255	chocolate
S0257	something fruity oh my god it's you know it's sherries and it's
S0255	oh
S0257	it's erm a creation and it's it's cocoa from this region or from that region and
S0257	and the chocolatier be jean paul and
S0257	and you didn't taste any of it and he just shrug
S0255	and he'd like sort of another one yeah
S0257	i think and yet he like his wine so he do understand
S0255	oh do he
S0257	and he like coffee as well
S0255	yeah
S0257	so he totally understand
S0255	yeah
S0257	you know coffee bean from this country
S0255	yeah
S0257	taste like that and from that area
S0257	and from a bright and from a a very wet area you know the different flavour
S0255	yeah
S0257	that you get and he just
S0255	doesn't get it
S0257	doesn't get it with chocolate and it's such such a waste
S0257	but you're mean to share them and compare
S0255	yeah
S0257	and i mean discuss them and
S0255	when when you do the score on the website where do they go do er can you look at chocolates then and see what score people have give them
S0257	yes
S0255	that's the idea
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm oh
S0257	mm yeah
S0257	it it's it's nice though because you get a little bite of chocolate it's not too much
S0255	mm
S0257	but it's it's rich enough that you you feel you maybe don't need more than a couple
S0255	no
S0257	you know
S0255	yeah
S0257	i've have some really really nice chocolate and they might be very very lemony or very
S0255	mm
S0257	er pistachios all the way through it or a
S0255	yeah
S0257	a ganache in that one or you really rich or a little bite of alcohol in that one so you it's not
S0255	mm
S0257	it's not like a box of milk tray where you're just go to eat them and then go mm
S0255	yeah
S0257	they've all go
S0255	yeah
S0257	you're go to savour them and put them away and then get them back out again another day and and share another and put them away
S0255	so i sort of like the idea but i think i'd probably end up eat the whole box
S0255	i would savour them and enjoy them
S0257	mm
S0255	but i i would keep eat them
S0257	yeah
S0255	i must admit
S0257	mm yes i i do use to put them away and then sneak into the kitchen
S0255	yeah and get another one
S0257	yeah yeah it's certainly worth it if if you if you do like different chocolates
S0255	mm
S0257	artisan chocolates then
S0255	yeah
S0257	it's certainly nice i think that they be about
S0255	it's
S0257	fourteen ninety five but you get intro offer of
S0255	yeah
S0257	nine ninety five or something
S0255	it's quite a nice thing to set up for someone for a christmas present
S0257	yeah
S0255	so that they get it deliver to them so every month they get this little thing of chocolate and
S0257	mm
S0255	and if you know a chocolate connoisseur you ought to suggest that to
S0257	yeah
S0257	yeah i yeah i like chocolate uhu
S0255	so christmas list a bird watch little book
S0257	uhu
S0255	and flower
S0257	mm
S0255	a book
S0257	of wild flower yeah
S0255	and yeah a wild flower little book and chocolate hotel chocolat
S0257	hotel chocolat
S0255	yeah a subscription
S0257	ah you know that's a really good idea
S0255	mm
S0257	cos we always get to christmas last christmas i couldn't tell him i i didn't give him one thing that i want for christmas
S0255	no no
S0257	i didn't want anything
S0255	no
S0257	i think i say in the end oh look if you're stick for ideas then how about some amazon vouchers cos i'll always buy book
S0255	yeah
S0257	or top up my kindle
S0255	mm
S0257	and yet he's every christmas birthday whatever it be he can give me a list of fifty things that he would like
S0255	mm
S0257	they be mostly book
S0255	yeah
S0257	or cds
S0255	yeah
S0257	or erm dvds or
S0255	mm
S0257	the odd bite of clothe not much at all it it rarely vary from those
S0255	mm
S0257	few things
S0255	yeah so i always find it hard with because he er i well it's like both of us if we want something we'll buy it
S0257	yeah
S0255	just like that if he want something and hasn't get it yet it's because he's still research it cos it's a real technical gadgety thing
S0257	uhu
S0255	in which case i've get no clue what to get him it's something quite expensive so he's think shall i get it when shall i er yeah i probably not that he can't afford it just
S0257	mm
S0255	he's think that's a lot of money to spend on that and then he buy it
S0257	mm
S0255	er and it's just and and other stuff he's just not bother about so if you can get him something and it's like oh yeah thank yeah oh mm yeah so i struggle with him a bite
S0257	mm
S0255	more so now because over the years we've get more and more stuff whereas when we first meet you didn't have everything you know whereas now
S0257	no
S0255	there's not a lot that he want and if he want something say it's another pair of ski which be gonna be hundreds of pound which he want these particular ones and you think er yeah i that's not gonna happen yeah
S0257	mm but i think as well you become we have this conversation in the car the other day you i'm i'm at the age now where i'm content with what i've get
S0255	yeah
S0257	i would love a bigger house i'd love a newer and bigger car
S0255	mm
S0257	i'd love a a a van for work
S0255	yeah
S0257	instead of have to use the car all the time there be things that would make life easier
S0255	mm
S0257	but i can't honestly say i really really really really really want any one thing in particular
S0255	no
S0257	and what be it we be on about the other day oh that's right cos he be say you know i want to make my music work i want to have a band that have some success even if it's only go out and gigging but play our original songs
S0255	mm
S0257	and not just do

S0255	mm
S0257	at that age now where i'm i'm happy and i'm comfortable with my life
S0255	mm
S0257	i just think i'm a few years before him where i've get to that stage
S0255	yeah yeah i i must admit and we see that now you know we we use to buy load of things and you know you just always go and get the next one and the newer one
S0257	yeah
S0255	the bigger one the this one the that one er it's like now we say you know we've get the little place in france and we think ideally we'd like to get a little place in lanzarote where we'll go and do our bodyboarding and
S0257	yeah
S0255	i mean whether we will or not or whether we'll just end up have time there but we think we actually don't want that much more and we don't need this big or we need the big place at the moment cos obviously
S0257	mm
S0255	's still here and his mum's still here
S0257	yeah
S0255	but if they weren't we wouldn't need this and we don't want to keep buy and achieve and do and we're quite ready now just to say let's go and spend a lot of time in france potter around with the ski
S0257	mm
S0255	bite of this you know bite of time here bite of time there and and that's it we'll be quite happy
S0257	yeah
S0255	quite happy to do that
S0257	yeah
S0255	you know and so many of our friends now who be fifty to sixty be all say absolutely have enough of work don't really wanna be do all this any more
S0257	mm
S0255	if we could just like step off this and just spend time together and do what we want to do
S0257	mm
S0255	i think you do you know you get to that stage and you can't imagine that ten years ago you could never have think
S0257	no
S0255	that you'd actually feel like that because you're so oh yeah yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	and i don't think it's the fact that it's the habit of it or you you're do it and you're do it i think it's just that be how you be at that time
S0257	yes
S0255	that be what you want and you look and you grow
S0257	yeah
S0255	and you achieve and you you're do and all of a sudden you get to this point and it's almost like overnight in a way just
S0257	mm
S0255	suddenly dawn on you and you think
S0257	why be i do this
S0255	yeah actually
S0257	mm
S0255	there's so much more to life
S0257	yeah er er and i think a lot of it be you do it because that's what you've always do and
S0255	yeah
S0257	my erm one of our brother in laws he's now what be he about fifty five no hang on fifty six maybe fifty five or fifty six
S0255	mm

S0255	mm
S0257	totally out of the blue

S0257	and it knock him back a bite and it actually do rethink his life and he say i i would be i'm almost at the stage where i'd be happy to retire now
S0255	yeah
S0257	he say if you'd ask me that a year ago i'd have say don't be silly
S0255	no
S0257	he say but i i think he's do start to climb the wall a bite because erm my sister work she work part time and she doesn't work every day of the week she work for erm er a preschool

S0255	yeah
S0257	like be company for me
S0255	ah
S0257	so he he'd mm almost at the stage where it be climb the wall but it it do make him sit back a bite and think my life that i have before redundancy would i be happy do that for the next ten
S0255	mm
S0257	and he say no
S0255	no
S0257	no he say it it's really open my eye
S0255	yeah
S0257	say i'm not ready for it now i know i'm not ready for it now
S0255	no no
S0257	and that that time that he be force to stay at home prove that for him
S0255	mm mm
S0257	he say it er i now know i'll be ready for it a lot sooner
S0255	yeah
S0257	than i would have say last year
S0255	yeah well the thing be people always put all this on oh mm for when they retire you know oh when i retire i'm gonna do this when i retire i'm gonna do that
S0257	mm
S0255	but by the time you get to retire you're probably too knackered
S0257	exactly
S0255	probably get health problems not necessarily but a lot of people have
S0257	yeah
S0255	the number of people that think they're go to then go and just stop and then they're gonna do this and this and this and it doesn't happen
S0257	or that's when their children start make demand on them again
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	they've grow up and leave home
S0255	yeah
S0257	but then they start have their own families
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	and er you know can you look after the baby
S0255	yeah
S0257	can you look after them
S0255	yeah
S0257	can you pick him up from school
S0255	yeah
S0257	can you do this and that
S0255	or even the fact that that people think they be gonna move away but actually when there's grandkids there they don't want to
S0257	no
S0255	they don't want to leave them oh you know
S0257	no
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	mm i know lot of people that that i work with who er particularly the girls one of the only reason they can work be because their parent or their partner's parent have the children after school or they have them in the morning
S0255	mm
S0257	and take them to school
S0255	yeah
S0257	or they have them the one day a week when they're not at nursery
S0255	yeah
S0257	and they wouldn't be able to
S0255	no
S0257	function if if that wasn't the case
S0255	mm
S0257	they wouldn't be able to go to work if that wasn't the case
S0255	no
S0257	but i also hear them say about be sometimes quite elderly parent if they're not very well they've get their own health problems don't know what i'll ever do if
S0255	yeah
S0257	they're not around to
S0255	yeah
S0257	you know to look after the little one and it's a difficult situation my with when my children be grow up when before school age definitely i i be i be work for nothing because every penny i earn put them through childcare
S0255	mm
S0257	but i need to work for my own sanity
S0255	yeah
S0257	so it didn't bother me that at the end of the month i have nothing to show for it cos it be all go
S0255	yeah
S0257	straight into er
S0255	yeah
S0257	straight to the childcare provider
S0255	and it be it's quite good for them to be with other kid and and
S0257	definitely
S0255	and have them start that as well isn't it so
S0257	yeah yeah absolutely
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	absolutely
S0255	mm
S0257	and i would never i know i and i really appreciate what my parent have have give me and my sisters and they'd do it for the four of us so
S0255	mm
S0257	they they they'd do it for all their marry life
S0255	mm
S0257	and i always i never actually speak to them about childcare and they never speak to me about it i think cos they be scar i be gonna say oh can you have the girls
S0255	yeah
S0257	but i i be always adamant that would be and and this have be one of my perhaps fail i suppose that i would be totally independent
S0255	mm
S0257	if i want to to go to work i would pay for my children to be look after
S0255	mm
S0257	nobody else would it wasn't
S0255	yeah
S0257	it wasn't like it wasn't their their dad's responsibility to look after them i'm very old fashion like that it be i'm the mum it's my responsibility
S0255	mm
S0257	so if i'm not go to be there to look after them i will earn the money to pay for them to be there
S0255	yeah
S0257	look after
S0255	yeah
S0257	if it be the difference between stay home with them and keep my sanity and go for work go to work well that's what i have to do
S0255	mm
S0257	i go back to work because they be both bear overseas but with er with we move back to germany when er back to the uk when she be only seven weeks old yeah about seven weeks
S0255	mm
S0257	and er i go back to work when she be four months but with i move out to germany heavily pregnant and she be it be just before she be about three months before she be two that we move back from germany and i start work the week she turn two
S0255	mm
S0257	and i start work full time with the think that if the children be suffer in any way i could reduce my hours but if i go back to work part time it would be harder to increase
S0255	yeah
S0257	and if everything be alright
S0255	yeah
S0257	and er i never look back
S0255	yeah
S0257	there be never any problem at all
S0255	mm
S0257	in term of hours they both thrive on the company of other children
S0255	yeah
S0257	and it be in the childminder or kindergarten they both go to kindergarten
S0255	mm
S0257	and they absolutely love it
