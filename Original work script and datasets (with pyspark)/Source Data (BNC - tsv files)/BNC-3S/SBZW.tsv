S0392	yeah
S0390	and then it's three days
S0392	yeah
S0390	full and then it's three days till you're better
S0392	that's probably more like it but all the other ones i've have be probably you don't know how many days in cos you're you're not aware of it
S0390	you don't know how many days you've be incubate it
S0392	no and then probably about mine in the past have be probably about eight or nine days have it and then two more three more days lose it so when i get this last one i be i be shock about how mild it be it be brilliant

S0390	i like it
S0392	yeah
S0390	i like it better now than i
S0392	mm what do you think of the new layout
S0390	i like the new layout
S0392	do you think it's nice yeah
S0390	easier
S0392	i remember when they first start they have those sort of watercolour picture for everybody
S0390	yeah
S0392	then they get rid of those didn't they
S0390	i didn't like it when i first start then i have to think about it
S0392	i think it's a lot better the old one just felt like something you get out the but now it feel more like a current affairs thing that you'd find in smiths
S0390	it be more you're right
S0392	it's a lot more sort of contemporary isn't it
S0390	you're right it be a current affairs erm i be read i'm sort of up to date now but last
S0392	yes
S0390	daniel o'leary be quote your dad which i be very
S0392	oh yeah
S0390	i be very impress with
S0392	well erm still it's i still don't like that on the front cover you know the the word tea be sort of centre
S0390	mm
S0392	i think that they could probably do like a new logo header for it it look a bite more contemporary
S0390	i never notice possibly i never notice
S0392	yeah
S0390	i must say i be say to er erm i like it when daniel o'leary quote
S0391	that's why he ring up
S0392	mm
S0390	yeah
S0391	that's why he he he he phone us
S0392	that's amaze you know the the the mobile company ee they do broadband and phone stuff
S0390	oh yes i read on the news about them
S0392	and get her mobile and broadband bt have buy them
S0391	they've buy them
S0390	buy them
S0392	that's amaze
S0392	that's so significant cos bt always want to they be buy all the new like mobile network and 4g when they come out and everyone wonder why because
S0390	oh
S0391	oh
S0392	they they don't
S0390	they don't
S0392	they don't didn't do mobiles but now they've buy them that's obviously why they do it but vodafone have say that they want the competition authorities to intervene so it's not much of a monopoly
S0390	yeah well they're probably get a bite scar now
S0392	rather than oligopoly as it be yeah still around here ee they don't have very good network connection in this sort of area
S0390	well my network connection's rubbish
S0392	you're broadband aren't you be you on plusnet or something
S0390	oh that
S0392	or
S0390	yeah yeah well bt
S0392	yeah
S0390	it's a subsidiary of bt
S0392	well it might be it might be to do with your computer though instead i i've notice a lot of people
S0390	no everybody in the village
S0392	they might all have old computers cos what i've notice be we use to always think that oh the internet's slow and everything and then phone bt and then a new computer it just
S0390	then you've get
S0392	i think that's the problem the government's spend load of money on fibre optic and everything and no one's notice any differences but then probably the people who be complain about it it might just be that their computer's not as new
S0390	well that's the point i be not buy a new computer till i'm after i've move
S0392	that's a very good idea
S0390	i'm not settle
S0392	yeah
S0390	you can pop in for you you know for a cup of coffee if your mum's busy after school
S0392	mm
S0390	don't have to get the bus home be great i'm look forward to it hey this look good erm
S0392	mm
S0390	do you have to pay for it or be it
S0392	oh no yeah you've gotta pay for it

S0392	yeah
S0390	i can see that
S0391	buh bah buh bah buh bah
S0392	cos they be quite offensive some of the cartoon they do weren't they
S0391	buh bah buh buh bah
S0390	well i don't know where i stand on this to be quite honest

S0390	i don't think you be i'd hit anybody who hit my mother
