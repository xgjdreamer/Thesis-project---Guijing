S0423	well it look like we're head towards a referendum for europe over here aren't we
S0421	yeah
S0423	i think it's a bad idea to come out now
S0421	yeah probably
S0423	i think i'd vote to stay
S0421	probably i don't know that much about it yet but i'd have to research it
S0423	bear you'd be bear to stay in wouldn't you cos you know it's better for your parent travel and what have you your mum and dad
S0422	we be in the the thing i've get against it be this bloody mess with greece why would why should we pay for their you know the the bloody they just sit around play chess or whatever on sun nobody work and they get all this big debt and other countries have to budge in and
S0421	well that's not quite how it work but
S0423	it's a little bite it's a little bite racist that
S0422	it's not racist
S0423	say they sit around in the sun all day
S0422	well no but every time you look at them you know there's there's big unemployment and people just don't wanna work
S0423	i don't know if that's true they i think they'd be happy to work if there's job wouldn't they
S0422	well i dunno
S0423	don't think its
S0422	i'd have to read up on it to really know if i want to stay in or not
S0423	as well there's less i think since they have the euro as well it's not do them any favour because it's their currency use to be it sort of things use to be a lot cheaper over there so they get load of tourists and there's a lot less tourists go so cos it's pricier
S0422	don't understand i think they give it to anyway
S0421	i think that but they've give you one
S0422	furniture i don't think i'm buy any furniture bloody cat
