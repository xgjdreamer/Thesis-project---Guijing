S0654	yeah because he have a passport
S0653	i probably oh no i renew mine two years ago but for a while i hadn't i didn't have a passport for about a valid passport for two years
S0655	what's a valid
S0653	one be one that's current that you can use so mine have become out of date because we hadn't be anywhere but it didn't matter because i wasn't go anywhere on holiday however passports be very important for job and things because they be our way of prove who you be it's probably well they either people like to see your birth certificate or and your drive licence and your passport but the passport be the best one because they be quite actually hard to get you prove that you live here for permanently and all that so actually when i be get teach work i have to it be very difficult to not to try and prove who i be without my passport so that's why i renew my passport so i still haven't be abroad i haven't use my passport
