S0548	right
S0549	him look good
S0548	but like it's alright make him look good but he's gotta get off his backside and do a bite
S0549	i know cos like do a hell of a lot more than him and be sit there i be like i'm just a bite like why be i make the thing cos i have make a group chat of network plan between me and
S0548	yeah
S0549	cos i'm the chairperson 's the leader 's er treasurer i just think we need an exec meet to sort out all that because at the minute 's get everything and 's get nothing like be happy to do the book and sort out the money and the bank and all that but she's not get anything to do it with and she's ask before and he's just go oh we'll have to sort it out over christmas and then he's just never do anything
S0548	that's all over though isn't it
S0549	yeah
S0548	and i think he'll do less and less now he's work
S0549	everything be like oh but i've get a job oh but i'm work
S0548	mm
S0549	i'm work
S0548	yeah i think it will be
S0549	then when he wasn't work it be like yeah but i can have a massive lie in and do whatever i the whatever his situation be
S0548	it's always better than yours
S0549	yeah
S0548	yeah
S0549	if he be unemployed it be great because he could lie in and he could do whatever he want whenever he want but now he's get a job it's great because he's earn load of money and he's gonna be dead rich
S0548	need to grow up a bite really
S0549	and then he be moan about the tax the other day
S0548	why
S0549	just cos he's not be tax before have he so
S0548	well welcome to the real world
S0551	i know i pay three thousand on my bloody pension
S0548	mm
S0551	all this be say to you know what she say you you must stand fast you can't have him back
S0548	oh they won't send him back they won't they know you can't have him back
S0551	mm
S0548	if they can't cope with him when they've get people come in for eight hour shift then go home how can you cope with him twenty four seven
S0551	mm that's right yeah
S0548	they won't they won't do that
S0549	they won't they'll never do that
S0551	mm
S0548	and there's other place they're refuse him say that they'd never be able to cope with him
S0551	yeah
S0548	they're certainly not gonna send him home
S0551	no
S0548	if the worst come to the worst they'll section him and he'll end up in the which isn't ideal but
S0551	i know but that's what er oh not er who be it that say
S0548	it be a last resort
S0551	what about the
S0549	what what be
S0551	it's it's the where the doctor come from
S0548	i think it's part of the hospital really
S0551	but you know i can't think who it be that say you know how do they expect you to go to no it's ridiculous
S0548	it be but then if there's nowhere else what do you do cos they won't section him unless they really really have to that's a that's the last straw
S0549	it's hard for both side cos it's er you can't
S0548	well
S0549	like you say like it's hard for you to have to travel to but at the same time if they literally can't find anywhere else to put him it's not their fault and if
S0548	no no
S0549	that he have a unique condition that's end up be like this they can't like
S0548	i fail to believe that it's unique to be honest
