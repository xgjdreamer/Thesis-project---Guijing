S0485	as in jabal jabal tariq the tariq's mountain which be
S0428	gibraltar
S0485	gibraltar
S0428	yeah
S0432	mm
S0485	and
S0428	yeah which be a little town when
S0485	it mean in in arabic it mean the island
S0432	er
S0428	er
S0485	it's an island yeah so it be all about that roderick
S0428	mm
S0485	but then that be the er moor write about their own invasion of spain it be great fun
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	i really like to see all the arab influence in spain
S0485	yes stagger they're still there

S0428	i don't have to work seven days a week like that's not true yeah i'm go to go on holiday which i'm really excite about
S0432	yeah relax
S0428	to my favourite place in the world
S0485	i remember when i finish my first degree and it my last exam be in arabic and i have these the the i have quranic arabic to do and i have this book on roderick last of the goths and i i mean the i have to memorise so many different languages and so many different dialects and i manage it except that when i finish the exam i remember go to the common room pick up a time and start to memorise the the the stories on the front page and i think there's something wrong here
S0428	yeah need some real life
S0432	just train your brain in to
S0485	i get yeah i use to to try and get the arabic be the most difficult and i read the arabic into a tape recorder and play it when i be asleep
S0428	do that work
S0485	yes
S0432	that's such a good i like listen when i be practice spanish i listen to like podcast and things and just keep
S0432	yeah
S0485	but you know and i could i only have to pick up the first word or two in a in a unseen translation and you know i would know what it be cos i have it all in my head
S0432	wow
S0428	that's i think that be a myth
S0485	no it work
S0428	like sleep with the dictionary under your pillow and it might just all go in
S0485	no no that's not
S0432	yeah it'll just float into your mind
S0485	it's a bite different
S0428	osmosis
S0432	yeah
S0428	no but i didn't i i i've hear that as a myth but i didn't know it be actually
S0485	well it seem to work for me
S0428	yeah that's incredible
S0485	whether it be psychological or not i don't know
S0428	i might erm i might start have podcast on in spanish when i'm sleep
S0432	yeah they say yeah they say like if you want to give up smoke or something listen to like or if you want to learn i think they do say
S0428	mm
S0432	listen to them while you're asleep be
S0485	but it be be very it's a bite tricky really do this degree it be a i have endless seminars all week you know with different members of the faculty in different languages and if i didn't turn up there wasn't a seminar
S0485	you know and i have i be the only person who could answer all the question cos i be the only other person there
S0428	than be incredible they run the course just for one person i don't think they'd do that nowadays
S0432	no they wouldn't do that
S0428	no no they stop the they close the department when i finish that's why i couldn't do a go on to do a
S0428	carry on
S0485	postgraduate work in in in ancient languages so hence i go to the career advisory service and hence i get become an archaeologist
S0432	ah mm
S0485	and when i come into archaeology it i find it be so from a disciplinary point of view so flatulent you would say oh well i think this be such and such a thing you know you make it up as you go along i think i'd come from such a hard discipline where unless you absolutely know what it be you couldn't say
S0428	mm yeah
S0485	you know you have to know it
S0428	yeah
S0485	er and it take me six months
S0432	to
S0485	until i wake up one morning and though do you know what i'm an archaeologist and i never look back after that
S0432	ah
S0485	start teach shortly after that and zoom that's a long time ago ladies
S0485	a long time ago
S0428	well it's just like really great that you've be able to do something like that you love and be a passion and
S0485	oh absolutely
S0428	rather than have wake up and go oh
S0432	yeah i've get work again today
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0428	i i really love what we do
S0432	mm
S0428	i really enjoy it
S0432	yeah i do
S0428	it's it's quite a bite a bite of a treat i think to have study languages and then to be able to work with them cos there aren't that many job
S0432	mm yeah
S0428	with languages
S0485	yeah so be you permanent staff of er
S0432	yeah
S0485	press
S0428	mm
S0432	yeah yeah it's fun
S0485	excellent
S0432	yeah
S0485	so how how how long will you go on do this particular piece of research
S0428	well the we hope that two thousand and fourteen will be the middle point so we start collection in two thousand and twelve and it will hopefully finish kind of february twenty sixteen so but to to to reach that target we need we need about fifty hours in a a month so it's quite a quite a high target to get to
S0485	oh i see
S0428	so hope that's when we're hop to finish to data collection obviously the like the quicker you can collect it the tighter it be
S0485	now
S0428	yes
S0485	language and pedagogy research
S0432	yes
S0485	right
S0428	mm
S0485	erm i fell out with the university of over the word pedagogy
S0428	why be that
S0432	oh no
S0485	i have i have a letter from some daft woman who say that i have to go and attend a weekend seminar
S0428	mm
S0485	on the assessment of dyslexic students
S0428	mm
S0485	and other pedagogic issue and i think what and i write back and say if you if you really understand the word pedagogy you know then i'll come but since i'm absolutely certain that you don't then i won't
S0485	and i never look back from there
S0428	mm
S0485	so what what do you think it mean exactly
S0432	oh no be test now
S0428	yeah wish be here
S0432	well we only have one person in the team that's really work on it and she look into erm kind of teacher materials how they're use in their classroom at the teach and learn side of
S0485	what be pedagogue
S0428	i'm just scar to get it wrong
S0432	yeah don't want to say any more
S0428	in in the context so we where we work it's it's the study of like like teach but communicate the how you how a how you be able to pick something up how you be able to learn something and the method
S0485	but you use pedagogue almost in a derogatory sense you can do mean someone who teach rather pompously
S0428	no that's definitely not erm the sense that it's all about
S0485	but you still don't still don't know what it mean pedagogue be a person who teach children
S0428	be it oh i guess i guess ped yeah yeah
S0432	so just
S0485	that's what it mean
S0428	yeah yeah it make yeah
S0432	yeah that make sense
S0485	it's a it's a schoolteacher if you like
S0428	mm
S0485	since i know this woman do not know that i think well
S0432	yeah so pedagogy
S0485	yeah but it's change its mean obviously because of latin
S0432	yeah mm
S0428	yeah well it make sense
S0485	it's your actual latin you see which you know wouldn't you from your italian
S0428	yes
S0432	that do make sense now
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0485	curiously enough i do the equivalent gcse be o level in those days i fail o level latin
S0432	oh no
S0485	i i can't believe when it's such an elementary language and i teach it to my i be teach my son latin and i think how how could i possibly fail this and get a degree in all these other languages
S0428	just wasn't your language or
S0485	no cos i be go out collect rock all the time
S0428	oh the rock i remember the rock
S0432	yeah
S0428	i've never well i've do italian but i've never do latin so erm but they're obviously very close in part
S0432	mm
S0485	yeah
S0428	interestingly i be live in and and there they speak valencian which be like a dialect of catalan
S0432	but they don't they like you say that though
S0428	yeah they don't like you say that and you can argue where it anyway that's another like whole issue but know i think know french and italian help you more with understand valencian than know spanish
S0432	yeah yeah definitely
S0485	really
S0428	because yeah and
S0432	yeah and erm
S0428	it the way it's put together the structure it's not very spanish
S0432	no i think like catalan as well
S0428	yeah
S0432	just know french more than spanish would help
S0428	yeah help
S0432	would help you more
S0428	french and and italian
S0485	when you be study chinese be presumably mandarin chinese
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	i there any well there must be literature in as we describe as literature
S0432	in write
S0485	write
S0432	in
S0485	in mandarin
S0432	er yeah the character's different in that they're it would be in traditional character rather than simplify
S0485	oh
S0432	cos i learn the simplify version which they
S0428	which be still very complicate
S0432	yeah so they could help with it be mainly so they could help with the the eyesight cos chinese people be erm they all wear glass because they be concentrate so much on all the different part of each character so they simplify them so they could
S0428	really
S0432	yeah
S0428	that's fascinate
S0432	yeah because they've get the highest and they have a really high rate of erm illiteracy and it
S0428	because they be so hard
S0432	because they be so hard so they just simplify it for their eyesight and so they could so people could learn it
S0428	that's really interest i didn't know that
S0432	mm
S0428	so have you have have you ever learn any chinese or you say
S0432	and there's
S0485	nearest i'd say i've get be turkish which be a an altaic language it's from the altai mountains in mongolia
S0428	altaic
S0485	altaic altai mountains be the almost the border between russia and mongolia
S0428	yeah
S0485	it erm turkish and all the turkic languages come under that designate as an altaic language you can speak modern turkish from you know izmir in the west all the way to the oxus river and beyond bukhara samarkand and you would be understand apparently
S0432	mm wow mm
S0485	yeah
S0432	there be load of different dialects
S0428	in china
S0432	in china as well so many
S0485	i'm sure
S0432	well i be in which be in the south erm yunnan region and i when i be just walk down the street some of the chinese i couldn't understand cos they be talk in a different dialect and
S0485	well yeah you know long may it last
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	the greater the diversity of language the better
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	my erm my uncle's from the cameroon and he his language be completely like the next village along they can't understand a word
S0432	oh really
S0428	and then the next village along a completely different language again and they've get they've get french and english its erm those two be always teach
S0485	that imply they've be there a long time
S0428	yeah
S0485	for that separation
S0428	it's and he yeah it's incredible
S0485	it's er i mean look at bush bushman languages the sam languages in southern africa erm there be originally score of them
S0428	mm
S0485	and they be all different and the you know they would they'd be there for hundreds of thousands of years
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	yeah so but it language be an absolutely fascinate thing
S0432	mm
S0485	you know we try and work out when do language start erm to the extent that i be on on the ship er in april come up from and we come up the and the other lecturer with me be a musicologist he's actually amongst other things the director of the cambridge university shakespeare festival
S0428	oh that's amaze i go to three
S0432	oh yeah
S0485	well his name's
S0428	ah
S0485	and and i have a most fantastic time we we laugh so much go go on this thing and he say he be talk about the difference between indian music arabic music and western music and how it come about and so on and he say of course at the end of it that there be no such thing as music music be speak language which modulate and have come down to us through a variety of different phrase and so music develop out of that but he say actually it's speech so
S0432	mm
S0428	mm yeah
S0485	which be interest when you look at something like homer because the homeric epics be obviously sing the open of the iliad be something like sing rage oh muse
S0432	mm
S0485	er talk talk about the pen of the trojan war
S0428	mm
S0485	yeah it's incredible
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	and then they would remember hours' worth of the stuff and would sing it in modulate speech
S0428	it's amaze
S0485	well i have i have just the last cruise now i have a couple of the boat who be a lovely couple er and and be a really lively woman she be a good good look woman i would say in her fifties really enthusiastic love my lecture she think they be great and i be have dinner with them and i notice straightaway that she use a type of language you get i've see in the london area where they instead of you'd say er i be go to the shop oh be you
S0432	mm
S0485	where they use the singular rather than be be you
S0432	yeah
S0485	er and she would do that regularly and didn't know she be do it you know that be her normal way of speak
S0432	yeah
S0485	it be rather rather quaint i think
S0428	that's the kind of thing we're hop well not that we'd be particular interest in but someone would be interest in for the in this project be we we collect all the metadata of of where people be and where they live and and then you could look up and you could you could look up be you and then find all the people that have say that and you could se where they're from their age gender
S0432	yeah to see if it
S0485	well i haven't hear it for for years but there be use that and of course
S0432	be you yeah
S0485	what my mother would say say use language she'd say mean bad language in that case
S0432	mm
S0485	yeah
S0432	i i always notice my friend from northern ireland she would say when we be like cross it in china it's really hard to cross a road so you kind of have to just take it
S0428	go
S0432	just go and er you're wait for all these cars to go pass and then you're like right and then she's like ah we should have go then and i'm like no
S0485	we should've go yes
S0432	we should have go then we don't say go
S0432	that's that's not right and i always notice i don't know if it's from north
S0485	well that's how language develop
S0432	yeah
S0485	i i i spend a
S0428	i'm just go to pop to the toilet one sec
S0485	i spend a couple of years live with a guy who be do er an ma in language english language and the use he be fascinate by the by the use of the english language
S0432	yeah
S0485	and and i'd say oh but that's wrong he say no no it's not wrong i be use it differently and don't forget he say language er change by the by the people that use it
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	so i can use it then
S0432	yeah
S0485	that's how he would say it
S0432	yeah otherwise we'd all by we'd still be speak latin if it didn't change
S0485	true true true
S0432	if that be the earliest
S0485	but i mean english be a most extraordinary language cos it's so have i mean it's a bastard language
S0432	mm
S0485	it have romance and teutonic and
S0432	yeah
S0485	all sort of things all mix together er and i it's it's so expressive but it's be so grind down in certain part i be talk to erm a lady from new york
S0432	mm
S0485	last week and listen to her speak and in in new york they don't like to have an open vowel at the begin of a word
S0432	oh okay
S0485	so they'll take the consonant from the previous word and stick it on to the
S0432	put it oh
S0485	so as in lon gisland
S0432	lon gisland oh okay i've never notice yeah
S0485	yeah
S0432	yeah that's fascinate
S0485	you you runcle
S0432	your yeah
S0485	runcle so you you're take the you you emphasise it with the last consonant of the word before in front of the word which doesn't have it which which have a vowel
S0432	well that's interest because erm we find out erm not long ago actually that the word uncle use to be nuncle
S0485	yes it do
S0432	so and that's kind of a similar thing we've just change it over overtime we use to say a nuncle now we just we've put the n into the word before so an uncle
S0485	well it's the same with erm erm orange it be actually narange
S0432	narange
S0485	er
S0432	yeah it's it's really fascinate isn't it
S0485	yeah
S0432	i want to say nuncle now
S0432	change it back
S0485	you do get it with some older texts as a nickname nuncle
S0432	oh really wow
S0485	er for for an uncle i've see that but it's it's er the way in which language develop and evolve
S0432	mm
S0485	er and it must go back a long long way
S0432	yeah
S0485	you know we try in paleoanthropology to work out when language start
S0432	yeah that yeah
S0485	erm but it i mean it's it's impossible to know
S0432	mm
S0485	there be a there be a very famous paper write in the nineteen sixties by two erm american paleoanthropologists it say you can tell can't you why homo sapiens er develop over neanderthals erm because and this be a scientific paper they say it's because it's because neanderthals could not pronounce american vowels
S0432	what
S0485	you think what no it be it be in all seriousness
S0485	and that's why they and he be er no and they become extinct bizarre totally bizarre
S0432	yeah i just find it strange when people be erm say when they like my friend say oh i should have go then
S0485	should have go yeah
S0432	like that's totally wrong i mean it's not wrong if that's how
S0428	if that's how she say it then
S0432	if that's how they use it in that kind of region then it's not wrong it's just change change form what the rule that we that we be talk
S0485	yes
S0428	my my my dad use to get really angry because i grow up near here and we like with the the glottal stop so like water
S0485	oh yes yes
S0428	and he'd be like pronounce it water and it it wasn't he use to think i do it deliberately to annoy him
S0428	and and it wasn't it be just how i speak it be how all my friends speak
S0432	yeah
S0428	and it it be natural and he's get so angry and yeah and it's just how i i use to say to him you we should have live somewhere else you should have
S0432	in new zealand they say like wader no i'm not very good at the accent but
S0485	if you if you live anywhere anywhere near the thames estuary you you lose all all your consonants you know the estuarine english be i mean i be in with my brother in and we
S0428	hello
