S0417	mm
S0416	whatever she want
S0417	if she can come
S0416	ah be it like be it like a maybe
S0417	yeah it's a maybe because erm 's still have his treatment and he kind of need somebody to keep an eye on him really
S0416	yeah
S0417	but his son you know
S0416	yeah
S0417	do you know he's kind of coincidentally go to be there at the same time as she's suppose to be go away so that's why she think she's go so we've just gotta wait and see if that's

S0416	it's good that 's sit up
S0417	yeah well he didn't stay there though that's the only thing
S0416	mm
S0417	cos while he's step in he kind of have to stay there till he's finish
S0416	mm

S0416	yeah
S0417	and he's start bite his fingernails
S0416	have he
S0417	yeah do you still bite your fingernails
S0416	not often
S0417	do do i wonder whether he's copy them

S0417	yeah
S0416	yeah yeah i don't think so i can't recall do it
S0417	yeah do you like that better than ben and jenny jerry's
S0416	yeah
S0417	really
S0416	yeah it's because
S0417	be it softer
S0416	ben and jerry's have better chocolate ice cream
S0417	mm
S0416	but they just put in so much stuff
S0417	yeah they do
S0416	like here's layer of caramel with bricks of brownie and
S0417	yeah
S0416	other things and you don't you're not really eat ice cream you're just kind of eat lot of brownies
S0417	mm
S0416	with just a little bite of cream in them
S0417	i can't believe that didn't get chocolate i be like i be gutted
S0416	yeah
S0417	i be try to be like oh it's so nice it's fill and everything i don't really like any thing else apart from chocolate really
S0416	yeah i didn't really like it either
S0417	yeah i know what make her think of it maybe all like the other stuff
S0416	yeah
S0417	cookie dough
S0416	yeah i think all the kid like cookie dough
S0417	yeah
S0416	i'm not a big fan it taste a bite too sugary for me
S0418	why
S0417	yeah it's not my favourite either i just i just have to try and be nice
S0416	i like things yeah i like things with sugar in but i don't like things that taste too sugary
S0417	mm
S0416	but i like sour things
S0417	yeah you like sour things right
S0416	which which doesn't really make sense it's just if i can if i can taste the sweet sugar which be nice i i hate i hate cereal sugar
S0417	really
S0416	i hate it yeah my dad like cereal sugar i don't at all
S0417	mm yeah but you like when you you don't actually have porridge any more porridge be really good for you
S0416	mm
S0417	but you could only eat that with sugar really
S0416	mm
S0417	but then that's that kind of need sugar doesn't it it's very like
S0416	yeah
S0417	it's just sticky and otherwise could eat all his pizza
S0416	cos cereal be already quite sugary
S0417	yeah
S0416	mm
S0417	i'm tire i'm gonna try finish my book do some other things today still don't know what a good name be for the cat maybe percy the penguin that's too bite too obvious as well load of percy the penguins around
S0416	mm
S0417	patrick the penguin
S0416	mm
S0417	no
S0416	long name aren't really
S0416	what do you think a good name for penguin and the cat or maybe it should be the pig that's who do you think should go away with the balloon the pig or the cat or the penguin
S0416	penguin
S0417	yeah that would be better
S0416	penguin's small and more cute
S0417	and he's gonna erm he's get a one of the ways he's gonna be save be by grab on to the bunny's ears to barry's ears he'll jump up and he'll grab hold of barry's ears cos they're so big and tall do you think the penguin would be able to grab hold of his ears with his flippers
S0416	no not in real life but i think in a kid's book it'd be alright
S0417	so shall i just mention the penguin not mention any other of the children's name cos i'm try to make it nice and simple but
S0416	yeah you just don't mention like the cats' name there's no real need
S0417	so the penguin what would his name be barry rescue
S0416	i dunno i like percy but i don't think it'd matter to a kid i think percy'd be amaze for a kid but in the adults' eye i can see how
S0417	
S0416	would work i think it would
S0417	the penguin even though we know an annoy don't we erm
S0416	do we
S0417	yeah 's friend
S0416	oh that
S0417	that's a long that's long name though
S0416	yeah i dunno
S0417	jim jimmy
S0416	i dunno i'm i'm i wouldn't i'm not feel jimmy but i dunno
S0417	erm
S0416	i don't know if i'm the best advisor but
S0417	barry and and wesley stanley
S0416	steve
S0417	steve i don't like steve
S0416	steve wouldn't really be good for erm
S0417	a penguin
S0416	yeah
S0417	maybe he should have like an un penguin like name like rocky erm william no that's too pompous charlie
S0416	i don't think think kid would like they're like what's that
S0417	yeah
S0416	what do that mean a name that's common enough i think would be good or maybe
S0417	jude
S0416	yeah mm
S0417	no
S0416	not common enough
S0417	i dunno about charlie either for a penguin i don't know barry's gotta be the name isn't he cos he's the main man
S0416	yeah
S0417	yeah so he's get like one mate the penguin
S0416	he's get more mat
S0417	well yeah but that's his main mate don't scrape the
S0416	sorry since when
S0417	well just one mate that we actually say so it look like he's kind of i think it might be confuse if we talk too much about the other ones it's only a short book
S0416	mm
S0417	do you think it's a bite confuse that he can hear the bite about him hear animals in the night be that a bite weird about him have his ears tie up as a baby do you think that's a bite weird bite odd
S0416	yeah i don't really understand why
S0417	cos they be trail along the floor
S0417	but not yeah
S0416	well i think if it be an adult's book there wouldn't really be
S0417	if you be gonna do a children's book what would you do
S0417	why you lookin at the ceiling ah
S0416	mm
S0417	okay what if you be gonna do a children's book well

S0416	yeah
S0417	okay well can you just maybe clear the cushion next to it and just not
S0416	mm
S0417	cos you kind of fall asleep with it on and then one day that cushion's gonna lie on top like the monkey by mistake possibly or it will make it
S0417	or it'll make it fall over and go on it
S0418	mum mummy
S0416	yeah the only thing be when i sleep i move around a lot

S0416	and it pick up all the people and that's the end
S0417	it's a good idea
S0416	not really
S0417	different people or different animals
S0418	mm mm mm mm no
S0416	animals would be best
S0418	that's not a bad idea
S0418	ow man good
S0417	yes cos they can go be it every time they they can go
S0418	ow
S0417	ah
S0416	and it's actually already be do but never mind
S0416	it's already be do
S0417	mm
S0418	a bite
S0416	yeah have a show
S0416	where that's what happen
S0416	train go round in a circle
S0416	on the same track with the same music
S0418	one mm mm
S0416	and they pick pick up an animal each time they go and first they pick up one animal then two three then four then five
S0417	yeah but sometimes simple things be the best
S0416	mm mm
S0417	lot of stories have be do similarly i'm sure there's probably be a bunny rabbit story before
S0416	mm
S0417	right we're off the table cos you like take a million years to finish by leave the table all the time
S0418	mm mm
S0417	so be you gonna do some revision how you gonna do it
