S0653	that's a problem with it but that's why they serve them or have them available in bar and pubs so people get thirsty and drink and want to drink more
S0654	oh
S0653	sneaky
S0655	uhu
S0653	uhu do you notice me erm do any hoop move on thursday by the way no cos i be do er a move call the russian split which be quite tricky
S0654	what be it
S0653	when you hang off erm okay so
S0655	like be when you're hold onto the top of the hoop and then you let your legs go off and try and do a split in the air
S0653	right so first of all you do the prow so you be hold onto the top of the hoop you flip your legs through the top all the way down and then the knees reach the bottom of the hoop and then you kind of move your body out so you look like you're er you know a figure on a ship like a pirate ship and then
S0654	so like you're hang upside down
S0653	so you're your arm be there your knees be you've kind of twist your arm around
S0654	like this
S0655	ooh
S0653	like that and your knees be on the hoop like that and then you er get one leg up so one leg be point up and one leg be point down
S0653	but the hoop be you're sort of hang down from the hoop so if you let go you would fall on the floor
S0655	ouch
S0653	but it look really good do i not show you the photograph of it
S0655	no
S0655	mm no
S0653	okay i didn't take well obviously i didn't take any photograph cos i can't take any photograph of myself certainly not while i'm

S0653	let me think but i get my friend to do it because it's useful to see what you get up to so this be that be the picture of it there
S0655	oh that look painful
S0653	it's not painful it's just dangerous cos you have to hang on really hard
S0655	what happen if you fall
S0653	you hurt yourself really badly but it's good isn't it
S0655	yeah it be
S0653	but you're very good at take photograph
