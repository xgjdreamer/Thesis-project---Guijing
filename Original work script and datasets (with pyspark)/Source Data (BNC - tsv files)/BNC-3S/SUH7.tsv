S0403	what do you listen to do you listen to anyone
S0405	erm ah taylor swift's like she actually release a new album
S0402	you actually film it
S0405	yeah it be record now i actually like
S0402	how long's it be record for
S0405	er two minutes now okay erm
S0402	this be just a whole heap of shit man
S0405	yeah
S0402	might even cut that out
S0405	they're not go to like this material okay erm
S0402	i just wanna say for the record i nearly fell off the table
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	so i i don't swear a lot i just
S0405	they're they're listen to you right now
S0403	disclaimership
S0405	okay erm no no no what
S0402	i'm not a bad person
S0405	have you see the hobbit trailer or at least
S0403	the new one
S0405	yeah there be a new one like
S0403	i've not
S0405	a couple of day ago watch it erm alright let's talk about
S0402	should we give our name should we call ourselves like mr x or something
S0405	er it's just no mr x use our real name like
S0403	john smith we're all john smith
S0405	we're all john smith
S0402	oh i i i just need another just need another and just use the name there cos like they'll wipe
S0405	that'll be alright actually have you watch pulp fiction
S0403	i have
S0405	yes yes three people watch pulp fiction
S0403	yes
S0405	okay i watch i watch another review about it yesterday cos i i watch it like three time now it's so good i like it more than fight club
S0402	and i like fight club
S0405	i i like i be amaze by fight club
S0402	i be amaze by pulp fiction
S0405	and then i tell him to watch fight club
S0402	i tell him to watch pulp fiction
S0405	i'm now amaze by pulp fiction
S0403	pulp fiction's like
S0402	i'm now amaze by fight club
S0405	every minute of pulp fiction be so well make
S0402	not not not the part where there's like random sex scenes and
S0405	no the thing be no that that all have a secret not a secret tone a tone and a a motif that it's try to try to portray
S0403	yeah but it's not
S0402	yeah what about the rape scene what be that try to portray
S0405	yeah yeah yeah it's show eh erm it's okay let me think about this erm the the rape scene be one of us
S0403	it just seem that people's people like it so much it seem like it's just take the mick
S0405	yeah
S0403	cos bits of it be just rubbish like
S0405	i think it it be a i think it be a mixture between comedy and a bite of satire
S0402	you know tarantino it's not basically it's it's ultra violent
S0405	the fact that a mob a mob dealer be get rap
S0402	no no the point be you haven't see django yet
S0405	no i haven't see django
S0402	or any like kill kill bill and all that
S0403	kill bill's amaze
S0402	basically i haven't see it but tarantino's it's like tarantino's go to thing
S0403	yeah yeah
S0402	oh er erm inglorious basterds
S0405	he's he he's do it best
S0402	tarantino's go to be make ultra violent movies ultra violent if you go
S0405	but in a in but in a better way than say michael bay do which be action and women
S0403	what's an ultra violent film
S0402	like but
S0405	just very violent
S0402	yeah like
S0403	oh ultra
S0405	violent
S0402	violent yeah
S0405	erm no no
S0403	uv light
S0405	tarantino i he he try to put a message across i i
S0402	he doesn't he doesn't really
S0405	no okay he do it
S0402	alright think about django yeah
S0405	but he do it well that's the point
S0402	have you see you haven't see django it's basically about a black slave get revenge
S0405	oh no okay well every every every director have a bad eh good and bad film
S0402	no hang on a second that be a great film
S0405	oh really
S0402	not say it's a it's a great film
S0405	okay okay so so so what's the problem with that if you make good film and it's the thing with erm the thing with fight club be i read the book and i'd like fight club erm for the message i think it's try to put across but i think too many people
S0402	the acting's good the acting's good
S0405	yeah yeah yeah edward norton and brad pitt amaze that really get me into brad pitt like
S0405	you know what i mean that's a different but
S0402	no i don't
S0405	i get deep into brad pitt erm okay
S0405	eh i'll start i'll start again erm what be i go to say yeah i think people interpret it to be and it get criticism for the fact that it's it's it's a film that encourage erm it encourage violence fight masculine attitudes eh eh towards as in it's masculine to fight and take back your humanity personally i don't think that's what chuck palahniuk be try to put across
S0402	yeah yeah they've take the wrong message
S0405	people just be get the wrong message the name of the it be fight club it's all about oh wow when you fight you become a man and men be be
S0402	yeah i know but
S0405	men should go home
S0402	but that whole the whole evolution of fight club be where they didn't end as fight club they're just project mayhem didn't it
S0405	yeah that's true that's true
S0403	isn't it sort of base it seem like communist revolution type they call the proletariat or call the you know the chefs and
S0405	proletariat
S0402	but yeah
S0403	all the like they all sort of group together
S0405	the workers
S0402	yeah yeah no it be more than that because like it be just people felt run down
S0405	yeah
S0402	they felt like that as though the system have screw them over
S0403	that's fair enough yeah that's cool yeah
S0402	sort of like that's why they blow up the credit card company
S0405	oh yeah yeah
S0402	cos they be sick of er
S0405	when he try to blow those up
S0402	yeah yeah yeah i guess it be revolution style
S0403	revolutionary type
S0405	yeah he be say take back your take back your your er what you what it mean to be human for you and he you know people just think that mean fight and stuff but you know like like when he be describe how erm he say self improvement be masturbation as in improve yourself be be pointless and worthless and it only be for yourself it's it's try to say that you be everything you need to be
S0403	yeah
S0405	we just think that oh we need to improve ourselves by become hench and become ah a gucci model
S0402	yeah i i i i don't i don't a hundred percent believe in that because to say that you're perfect the way you be i guess it's like if you say that ah it's a really nice thing to say to someone
S0405	yeah
S0402	and it give them a lot of self confidence but to be honest if you're you know get diabetes or something it be your fault that you have like type two diabetes
S0405	not all but yeah
S0402	yeah i know
S0403	but it sort of like it seem to be sort of it's like how in religion you know you ask for forgiveness from god you sort of
S0402	yeah yeah
S0403	it's like scapegoating it's not take responsibility and you're not improve yourself if you you know say you're find it hard
S0402	yeah
S0405	that's why
S0402	but everyone have the capacity to improve it's just i guess fight club's way of think about it be be free
S0405	but that's why that's why he say
S0402	i ain't cos even then their self improvement be let go of all of their erm prerequisite and then
S0405	self destruction that's what he say
S0402	no
S0405	self destruction be be the root to humanity humanity's success but
S0402	yeah but even then that's that's a form of self improvement cos they try and that be that's what he that's what tyler durden believe be
S0405	but that that's that's get yeah
S0402	erm the the way he could self improve himself
S0405	yeah a different a a a point that a point that me and er talk about yesterday be erm the fact erm tyler durden talk about people shouldn't be pack themselves into gyms and
S0403	yeah
S0405	try to be perfect and yet brad pitt be pretty much the of a hench guy who fight and he's attractive to women
S0402	and he's he's marry to angelina jolie it's true
S0405	yeah exactly erm even the tyler durden figure be so you know maybe ai say that that be probably due to the there's more homoerotic theme in in the book it's much it's much more about edward norton character be attract to tyler durden erm but then also christian think that be be the point of view that erm he think that it show edward norton have already be sort of erm er influence by society to believe that that be the perfect image cos tyler durden be perfect in his mind
S0402	oh yeah well he say that he say that
S0405	so maybe he's already yeah exactly
S0402	cos he say like i fight the way you want to i talk the way you want
S0405	yeah
S0402	like f asterisk c k the way you want
S0405	straight to
S0403	well say
S0402	keep it clean here
S0405	oh right oh oh yeah yeah yeah
S0405	exactly yeah
S0405	i the thing i like about i can enjoy pulp fiction more now i i say i i i just find it so funny intrinsically
S0402	ah yeah it's hilarious but there's always that's like low or high pleasure that's like the lower that no you find it but there's something something like amaze to me about something that's such a high level of think that you're actually like question rather than
S0405	pulp fiction make me question things
S0402	like
S0405	samuel l jackson the whole the whole movie be about chance the whole movie
S0402	yeah it's very hard yeah it's it's very hard to question something when you have samuel l jackson
S0405	the whole movie's about grunt and like you know
S0402	shoot people in the face
S0403	it's just what's it it's just mr tarantino try to get some what's it you know catchy line that everyone will oh you know replay try to make money that's the whole point
S0405	yeah that that be true isn't yeah but isn't everything influence by
S0403	i think it's
S0402	i guess
S0403	i suppose yeah but there's no
S0402	i you've get to think of the purpose of the writer i mean cos
S0403	it's like
S0402	i don't know it eh i don't know the writer but do he write the book want to make a profit or do he just write it just cos he just want to write it
S0405	who palahniuk for with er fight club
S0402	yeah
S0405	eh i think he i think it be his first hit book and he really want to send a message
S0402	okay well if it be send a message then i can understand that slightly more than erm er pulp fiction
S0403	exactly pulp fiction be mean to be entertain
S0402	yeah pulp fiction be mean to be entertain whereas er er fight club be mean to be think provoke that's the difference
S0405	yeah okay
S0402	fight club be mean to actually make you stop
S0405	you're you're like compare two different things but
S0402	no i know i know that's what
S0405	yeah that's why we can't but erm
S0402	obviously there's no definitive answer as to what be a better film but
S0405	no no it's like everything be objective but erm
S0402	imdb say
S0405	imdb
S0405	ruin their career thingy erm er
S0403	better question be the music in pulp fiction good the music
S0402	yeah
S0405	yeah it's
S0403	that's the most important part
S0405	but but end
S0402	yeah get down on it
S0405	and the music they talk about erm the the end credit eh music to fight club that's the song that be download so much more be it's like erm
S0403	what be it be it
S0405	where be my mind where be my mind
S0402	get down on it dede dede
S0405	i don't think that anywhere be better but it it it it get to it be such a good song i'll i'll play it if i can it's it's such a good song
S0403	it's like he do like chuck berry ah it's incredible music
S0405	yeah i know i know it's like it's like a guardians of the galaxy soundtrack
S0402	ah
S0405	and and the theme behind
S0402	that's the the most amaze soundtrack ever
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0403	which one
S0402	guardians of the galaxy
S0405	have you watch
S0403	i've i've never see it
S0405	you have to see it it be the best i i i we're massive marvel fan
S0402	it be i we're yeah well yeah
S0405	and we both love that it's my favourite marvel
S0402	i i i'm confuse whether that or erm days of future past i suppose marvel
S0405	it be okay
S0402	it's the best in that it it's the best in
S0405	why do that it be another wolverine movie it really be all about wolverine
S0402	i don't know no no no no it wasn't about that it wasn't
S0405	it be as much a wolverine movie as
S0402	it no no it be like wolverine like in the x men movies
S0405	yeah
S0402	where he have like he be the he be basically the main character
S0405	yeah
S0402	but he it it be far from the wolverine movie cos cos i you know the more the best bite be the bits between mcavoy and fassbender
S0405	yeah exactly
S0402	but they be they be my favourite part of the movie
S0405	okay
S0403	quick guy quick guy he be brilliant
S0402	yeah quicksilver
S0405	quicksilver er you you know they add that right at the end it wasn't actually something that they
S0403	oh really
S0405	yeah and and and and the quicksilver that's go to be in the age of ultron be go to be so much worse
S0402	age yeah
S0405	than erm cos you know age of ultron avengers two that's come out
S0402	yeah
S0403	oh yeah
S0405	there's there's a they they they're also have quicksilver but they're not make him a a mutant they're make him a they call him
S0403	right
S0405	erm because of right and and stuff
S0403	yeah
S0405	cos fox own the right to avengers and
S0402	oh yeah yeah fox yeah i know but they they kind of do kind of don't
S0405	yeah
S0402	because
S0405	no no but as in they can't combine them and i i'm just say they've set the bar so high
S0402	yeah i know but no but the point be here yeah yeah
S0405	er yeah they've set the bar so high for quicksilver and erm there's quicksilver's go to be in erm
S0402	yeah cos that cos that quicksilver be comedy quicksilver
S0405	yeah
S0402	yeah but the
S0405	but his be amaze
S0402	yeah i know the but yeah exactly the that that be music great music again
S0405	that's one of the best ah do you yeah
S0402	you know the part where he run around
S0405	time in a bottle time in a bottle
S0405	it's so good it's so good
S0405	erm yeah
S0402	and he just run around and start flick stuff and move gun around
S0405	physics in that scene be legit as well
S0405	ah they keep the physics fairly fairly legit with that scene as well i know
S0402	erm okay if you want
S0405	no yeah yeah yeah yeah they're
S0403	i mean the problem with
S0402	i mean f equal m a so
S0403	the problem with
S0402	his acceleration be awesome
S0405	yeah no
S0403	the problem with
S0402	ah ah because when he move the arm his acceleration do that be like like amazingly massive so the mass of that arm time that acceleration be gonna like just decimate the guy's face
S0405	it's go to
S0405	and that's a good idea that's what he do
S0402	no he no no no i mean like it would like punch a hole in his face
S0403	when he run
S0402	it's like that yeah yeah
S0403	yeah but when he run how come the the air resistance doesn't rip his skin off like
S0405	because he wear that those goggle
S0403	or like er you know
S0402	and those headphones it's the headphones
S0403	he's a mutant and how don't his clothe shatter to piece like
S0402	or yeah and the floor why didn't the floor crush when he run on that along the wall it's like innit
S0405	okay you know that the you know the question everyone you know the question everyone want the answer to
S0403	see you next week mate yeah
S0405	see you erm you know that song time in a bottle
S0403	yeah
S0405	if he be go at that speed how could they play that song at that do he speed that song up about a hundred time and then play it back so do you see what i'm say
S0402	well no because time be a time be relative time be relative the faster you go the closer you get to the speed of light the more time slow down
S0405	cos he
S0402	so those those headphones that be be part of or on his erm the the object that's him be move at the same speed as him
S0405	he be no way be he run round and it be go at so what what would he go to
S0402	so technically yeah yeah
S0402	no no no no
S0403	to real people it would sound a lot slower
S0402	yeah yeah
S0403	but if he speed if he speed up super quick i think it it would sound normal to him
S0405	yeah yeah that's what i'm say be that what he do
S0402	no no no no no it's not that no because time be so the faster you go
S0405	yeah
S0402	the er the more time slow down but but relative you to you you won't see a difference cos you know you around you but everyone else
S0403	yeah
S0402	erm will see you go fast you would see everyone else go slow
S0403	yeah
S0402	the headphones which be part of him
S0403	yeah
S0402	erm because he they're they're move at the exact same speed as him
S0403	yeah
S0402	he hear them at at the exact same speed everyone else hear them slower no faster relative to to him
S0403	yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	it's just physics
S0403	it's messy
S0405	yeah yeah i i won't understand that
S0405	that's that's fair enough
S0403	it's effort
S0405	no it's just it's just funny to me to imagine he speed that up like however many time
S0402	it's like yeah no he didn't need to
S0405	think think he would
S0402	no he wouldn't need to because he's yeah cos as he as he time be relative to him
S0405	yes
S0403	so it's speed up for him cos he
S0402	yeah
S0403	ah i see i see
S0402	no what yeah well yeah to him it doesn't change at all
S0403	that's cool it's pretty cool
S0402	yeah it's like the classic einstein think experiment with the er
S0403	which one the
S0402	the bounce the neutron up and down be it eh bounce a proton up and down it's like erm eh so eh mr and mrs einstein
S0403	yeah
S0402	classic isn't it eh so they both have clock and the erm like the pendulum of the clock be a photon and it bounce up and down between two plat and that's how you use cos that that never change that the speed of that photon
S0403	right
S0402	erm you you can calculate time precisely right
S0403	okay
S0402	so it's move up and down and then so you know what the interval be and you can calculate time precisely and he theorise that
S0402	if he be eh run eh if he be fly near the speed of light that erm that and he and he be move that photon would need to cover that distance compare to that distance hence why
S0403	oh right
S0402	erm it would it would seem cos to to him that photon be move at the same rate to him himself but to everyone else it's move that distance hence must be slower so erm the entire world be seemingly slower so so by him move faster he slow down the world around him but compare to everyone else
S0403	that's amaze
S0405	everything speed up i think you mean because if it cover that distance it need to move quickly
S0402	yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah sorry
S0405	so yeah yeah yeah okay
S0403	that's cool
S0402	yeah that's just like sort of one of his classic think experiment
S0403	it's like schrodinger's cat that's sick and i think i can understand it as well
S0405	yeah yeah i know it's it's a way of think
S0402	it's kind of
S0403	that's weird like
S0405	it's it's a way of think
S0402	yeah it i know the
S0405	at least the way my brother try to explain it to me
S0402	the the pop culture way of think of it be just like the cat can be both dead and alive which it can't
S0403	it's so cool cause okay for the record
S0405	yeah
S0403	you have a cat
S0405	yeah
S0403	in a box
S0405	in a box yeah
S0402	there's a fifty percent chance
S0403	with a some dynamite which have fifty percent chance of blow up
S0403	and then and so after and the dynamite's in the box so no one can know if it's blow up
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0403	so therefore be the cat dead or alive
S0405	yeah
S0403	before you open the
S0405	why can't it be both dead and alive
S0403	cos it can't
S0405	it can why not
S0403	well it can't
S0405	like in the sense
S0402	no no no the whole point
S0403	through our common sense it cannot but quantum physics it can why not
S0402	the whole point it be that it yeah i know because the whole point be it's mean to be an allegory for the particle wave duality
S0403	right right
S0405	oh
S0402	yeah so a a wave can be both a particle and
S0403	love the way the big bang theory turn it into into a relationship paradigm
S0402	yeah
S0403	by we can be both date and not date
S0403	the way leonard and penny do it
S0402	so so a wave can't be a particle at the same time as it be a wave but give it's undefined up until the point where you define it
S0403	but mm how how do us see it how do us measure it make a difference
S0402	because
S0403	cos therefore that imply our thoughts have physical impact
S0402	no our physical impact because it's the way we measure it cos you you think of erm the photoelectric effect
S0403	right
S0402	that can only happen when it's a particle so it must be a particle that's hit the thing but whereas erm like a when a a a wave erm like reflect a particles can't reflect like that
S0403	right right
S0402	so erm it's like it's undefined so the cat be both dead and alive it's it's kind of it's not it doesn't mean that it's both dead and alive at the same time it just mean that it's undefined
S0405	right it mean it's neither
S0402	yeah it's neither
S0403	yeah yeah
S0402	so it's a completely undefined as what it be up until the moment that you make it define itself
S0403	mm undefined be very similar to like how here's a question what's one divide by zero
S0402	yeah it's undefined
S0403	exactly yeah and it's and it's not infinity because if you approach it on a a y equal one graph it approach infinity
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0403	but the reason we don't say equal infinity because normally if something approach something we just say equal that
S0405	yeah
S0402	yeah
S0405	yeah
S0403	but the reason
S0405	it doesn't it actually never do
S0403	cos it well it approach it but and if if it if that be it we'd say it equal infinity
S0405	yeah
S0403	but it approach different number depend which way you you come from
S0405	yeah right yeah
S0403	if you come from the bottom it approach minus infinity which be completely different and
S0405	oh yeah
S0403	there's some there's some other sum where you can make it approach zero or one or anything really
S0405	yeah
S0402	well yeah well
S0403	therefore it's undefined and it doesn't have a limit like
S0402	yeah yes
S0405	oh man
S0402	i guess that's where where physics start to make sense when
S0405	it's friday
S0402	it physics make so little sense that it start to make sense again
S0405	no no it right right right
S0402	that's like that point
S0403	i think it's just you hear it so much you start to believe it
S0405	fair
S0402	yeah well no i i can kind of get schrodinger's cat i don't know well obviously
S0403	why do you
S0402	we don't get the mechanics of it
S0403	yeah yeah
S0402	because you know we we we can't because er by the very nature of try to understand the mechanics of it you change the mechanics of it
S0403	yeah
S0402	yeah that's the that's the that's the issue isn't it so we can never know if it's
S0402	i guess feasibly it could be both dead and alive but i don't think that would really from a physics standpoint hold but so it's more likely to by undefined up until that point
S0403	do you have any idea how we understand what photons be like cos we obviously we can't see them
S0402	yeah erm
S0405	be it still a theory or
S0403	well cos the moment they hit your light they're go they're eye your eye they're go
S0405	oh right yeah
S0402	yeah yeah yeah eh that's the that's the whole heisenberg uncertainty theorem isn't it
S0402	that you can never know a a position and eh momentum at the same time
S0405	god damn it
S0403	yeah it's cool isn't it
S0402	yeah yeah yeah
S0403	the more you closer you get to one the
S0402	yeah and and you can do that with anything so like i think a woman famously try to get out of a speed ticket because she use uncertainty theorem to say how do you know er where i be
S0405	really
S0402	cos you can't know my position and my erm my speed that accurately at the same time
S0405	that's just someone mess that's someone mess with their
S0402	obviously they still give her a ticket
S0405	yeah i know it be like like anyone's go to buy that
S0403	stupid guy you know might just fall for it like
S0402	yeah yeah
S0405	yeah look just to dumb this conversation down quite a lot be be this be more philosophy oh well
S0402	yeah yeah sure
S0405	relate to philosophy be philosophy and talk about er hypothetical stuff pointless in itself
S0405	or be
S0402	that's sorry that's basically what a physicist do anyway
S0405	yeah yeah i know yeah exactly so why spend your life talk about something that be only go to be relative to people
S0402	because they they actually have real life applications i mean if you think of a
S0405	how many people think oh be i go to do this schrodinger's cat or this principle or
S0402	no no i know yeah i know i know you think it's completely mental but like you think of a quantum computer
S0405	yeah
S0402	oh you you basically people you know you know potheads have for years have be basically do physics
S0405	yeah
S0402	and and everyone say well there's no real life application that until you get to something like a a quantum computer
S0405	yeah
S0402	which where you can have an electron you know you know you can split an electron can't you
S0403	i think you eh you give an electron like ten spin at once and you can measure them all at once or something and it cos
S0405	yeah sick
S0403	on a normal bite on a computer zero
S0402	that mean there's ten electrons yeah
S0403	but this can be like every number between one and zero at the same time
S0402	cos each electron have a quantum number
S0405	yeah
S0402	which be define by its charge erm its eh position its eh energy level
S0403	yeah yeah
S0402	and eh its spin
S0403	and you can measure all of them at once
S0402	so if it if it have if it have ten different spin that mean it's effectively ten different electrons
S0405	yeah oh right yeah yeah
S0402	which mean that effectively you can do the time the amount of calculations time
S0405	what so like when it's move it change its makeup or
S0403	i i don't know how it work but
S0403	you you give it a like yeah somehow and it have lot of different qualities
S0405	yeah
S0403	and you can measure each of them to get different stuff out
S0402	yeah
S0405	right right
S0403	and they reckon it'll be better to make like a brain type computer
S0405	yeah
S0403	because brain work more like that they work you know more complex and you know fire lot of things at once
S0405	yeah yeah
S0403	instead of just a linear
S0405	brain brain's mad
S0403	so they reckon like they the quantum computer it can do like five plus eight and that's like the best it can do in at the moment
S0405	yeah really
S0403	yeah yeah and it and it's like this big and cost like fifteen million quid yeah
S0405	do you think that will advance at the same rate computers have advance
S0403	i think they'll advance faster
S0405	look like look like they be yeah
S0403	we have computers to use as computers that we didn't have before
S0405	yeah oh that's amaze
S0403	yeah yeah yeah
S0405	so i'm again change the subject maybe deliberately erm
S0403	and it's go to come back to physics again
S0405	no no yeah we will we
S0402	it's like me and talk where it's like everything revert back to physics
S0405	yeah i know erm
S0402	and what happen in physics it explode there we go
S0403	so what sort of musics do you like
S0405	yeah yeah yeah i i i think i think they want more erm they want a genuine and this be this be a genuine conversation
S0402	but this this be a genuine conversation
S0403	we're just
S0402	and i think they're go to be revel in it
S0405	i don't think they care what we talk about
S0403	it's true we're just eff weird they're not go to want
S0405	no i know
S0405	they're not go to listen to everything erm oh no they be though cos they're transcribe it so that's cool
S0402	well yeah they could be transcribe this
S0405	they're go to turn everything we say into into er word erm there's seven minutes leave of this half an hour record
S0403	that's pretty cool
S0405	erm what be i say erm yeah what music do we like okay erm
S0403	yeah do you just like
S0405	cos i think we all completely have complete opposite erm i've change a lot right now i'm probably still into hip hop rap
S0403	oh my god
S0405	shut the shut the
S0402	that's not music
S0405	okay no not erm i don't like nicki minaj er what's that ah
S0403	have it get
S0402	that ice cube thing
S0405	lil wayne kanye kanye's kanye's okay
S0402	kanye man kanye kanye's awful i just like him cos he's a prick
S0405	kanye's have you see yeah cos he's such a prick do you see what he do to taylor swift at the vma award
S0402	yeah yeah yeah
S0405	when he take when he take the mic
S0402	it's like excuse me excuse me hi taylor i have a lot of respect for you
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0402	but beyonce make an amaze video this year
S0405	make that moment history so it be at the vma award
S0402	ah it be
S0405	it be
S0402	have you see erm erm have you see er oasis er liam gallagher's reaction to that
S0403	i know he go on what do he say there's so many
S0402	eh he go erm he go if if i ever win another award again i'd personally invite him to come up there and see what i'd fuck do with the award
S0405	so many would just like punch him so so have you see it it say taylor swift be receive her first ever vma
S0405	and she be so grateful and cos she's a country singer
S0403	ah so happy yeah
S0405	she it be like a teen who have get her dream come true
S0402	and everyone just go ah except for kanye west
S0405	and she go she be like ah thank you thank you
S0405	kanye drink go up
S0402	burst onto the stage
S0405	steal the mic she's like what be go on and he be like he say er wait what's become the meme he say erm i'm gonna let you finish
S0405	that's what he say
S0405	erm and then he say erm he basically say beyonce's video be better it be it be for video of the year
S0402	yeah and i think she should have win
S0405	and he say beyonce's video be history and then he storm off
S0405	erm and taylor swift doesn't say anything she's just like she's just like stand there and it's ah it's so sad
S0402	yeah she doesn't know what to do
S0403	it's funny though so
S0405	and then he who get the biggest backlash ever go to japan for a year make no er er you know er eh not propaganda
S0405	erm er news conference whatever you want to call it erm no music he be just he be off for a whole year cos it be just the amount of crap he get
S0405	he's a prick he's he's a
S0402	ah yeah douchebag he's he's marry to a kardashian so you come to expect that now
S0405	i know a kardashian they're so perfect for each other it's
S0402	yeah i know
S0405	ah i'm so happy i'm not ignorant or
S0403	i need to like expose myself to more of this gunk like you know like kardashians and stuff
S0405	yeah i know literally i find myself two days ago i be just like oh what be this and i know i know kanye cry a lot and and and have rant and stuff but
S0405	but anyway what be i say so i like i'm a big fan of eminem that's all i'm go to say
S0402	no ah
S0403	he's good actually i must be fair
S0405	i yeah i i
S0402	my favourite be will smith and that's just it
S0405	yeah yeah yeah will's ah funny that okay there's a topic erm will smith criticise the way rap be head erm
S0403	yeah
S0405	early early two thousands
S0402	he doesn't swear at all
S0405	i know
S0402	in his rap and his rap be just like happiness in a rap
S0405	yeah i know yeah exactly
S0402	that should be a subway advert
S0405	so that be end of end of happiness in a rap
S0402	you hear it first
S0405	oh i get it
S0403	patent
S0402	i'm patent that one
S0405	oh my god
S0402	transcribe that and send it to me please
S0405	what happen be if you care yeah will smith criticise erm basically the rap industry for for become swear
S0402	yeah
S0405	and then then tupac and biggie die and then everything just go back to normal eminem start swear more and eh it be
S0402	i the rap
S0405	i just like i i i i genuinely think he he's he's eh genius be the wrong word and people hate it when you call idiots genius
S0402	yeah
S0405	but yeah the the way he can er conjure rhyme and and then and
S0403	well
S0405	it's like in alliteration erm assonance and
S0402	well pitbull's a genius pitbull's a genius you know why you know why pitbull's a genius he rhyme kodak with kodak
S0405	yeah exactly he could rhyme orange with anything
S0402	yeah
S0403	he probably doesn't what's it even write it do he
S0405	no no he he write his own songs and that's that's not just me
S0403	
S0405	he he he he's one of the few erm yeah
S0403	okay
S0402	sound like you're fanboying here
S0405	trust me i do i i he be amaze he he write his own songs
S0403	yeah
S0405	he he he genuinely write his own his own lyric the the thing that people do admit be usually steal be erm they're call sample of if you listen to any rap song
S0402	yeah yeah
S0405	usually the chorus be be it's not steal it's give permission but it's from a different song like erm like there's five eminem songs there's there's one with a dido verse that go become one of the biggest songs in the world call stan and then
S0403	yeah
S0405	you know they steal off of erm aerosmith well they didn't steal it they get permission you know
S0403	yeah
S0405	so that's call sample there's a big debate about that but generally rappers write their own lyric though
S0403	that's cool
S0405	erm i can see i can see i've hat eminem at time as well
S0403	see eminem like not afraid erm you know the love the way you lie he do with
S0405	yeah with eh rihanna
S0403	they be brilliant brilliant songs
S0405	yeah well they're they're two of his biggest songs cos
S0403	but
S0405	erm well at least at least now you know he's have some really awful albums
S0405	and that he's he admit now for be as awful as you know in that they're horrible bass line horrible but pointless lyric i mean i think there's pros to each album but i mean i like i just like eminem for it give me a moods eh it really speak to me like
S0403	yeah yeah
S0405	from the heart yeah
S0405	okay away from the hip hop i like erm i get into linkin park more recently
S0403	okay yeah
S0405	erm they have their up and down as well
S0403	like when they do numb and stuff numb and new divide they be they be brilliant yeah
S0405	yeah new divide erm in the end er what i think that's sort of two thousand and seven onwards two er even later than that
S0403	yeah
S0405	erm
S0403	they be very good but like the newer stuff i've only hear one of their albums a thousand sun maybe
S0405	yeah yeah yeah a thousand sun that erm
S0403	that be awful
S0405	yeah yeah they be know for turn we're talk about linkin park
S0402	oh
S0405	erm linkin park be know for for have a really awful term like twenty ten to twenty twelve and now they've release another album erm er with with some well what i consider great songs linkin park songs
S0403	yeah
S0405	they they they basically put dubstep in their music and
S0402	oh yeah i guess every er band go through that phase where they have to do something
S0405	yeah change
S0402	change so that it show that there's differentiation in their music
S0405	yeah i know that they're not just put out the same it's like the beatles never have to do it do they
S0403	yeah i've never say song be awful but when i listen to that linkin park oh my it's just absolutely you know
S0402	so yeah i don't i don't like i don't like eh certain rap where these people just feel the need to swear
S0405	yeah
S0402	unless and i don't like er heavy metal rock or any thing which people need to shout
S0405	okay
S0403	yeah
S0402	don't swear don't shout
S0403	i suppose i suppose that's fair like yeah
S0402	i like i like a certain melody in music cos at the end they i can talk and swear a lot and i probably do
S0403	it's true
S0402	so i do that make me any different
S0405	yeah
S0402	shout and talk
S0405	i i agree with you on that there be yeah
S0403	it's like a the thing with metal and the main reason people like the proper scream stuff be that er it's impressive because it's so
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0403	hard to play
S0405	yeah
S0403	and it's so cos the drum and the guitar that very few people on the planet can do that
S0405	yeah
S0403	and that's the main reason it's popular
S0402	do you think there's a certain amount of also like rebellion in it
S0403	yeah that's true and
S0405	oh yeah all music be
S0402	rock be like the ultimate like rebellion kind of thing isn't it
S0403	yeah well it be back in the sixties and it still be now really
S0405	yeah how it start
S0402	well i guess it it go from like
S0405	yeah
S0402	i guess it go from
S0405	beastie boys
