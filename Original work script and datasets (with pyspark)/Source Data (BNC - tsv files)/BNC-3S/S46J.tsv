S0653	so i just want to tell you guy about the fact that i have do an obstacle course race today which be the first time i've ever do one and i do it all on my own and i'm very proud and it be five kilometres and i get very muddy and very wet there be lot of things to jump through and under and over and climb up erm but mainly it be very muddy and i get a medal at the end which be the first sport medal i have ever receive in my entire life so there you be it just show you that even at the age of thirty nine you can still like achieve new things erm and as i be say to you before i have a special one just for kid in september which be a mini version of it and i totally want you guy to do it what be your opinion
S0655	well i think it should be a small one cos it should be for kid and grow up cos not all grow up be as fit as you
S0653	do you know that's a totally valid point and in fact one of my friends who be the horror writer who you know of he be desperate to do something erm like that but he be very unfit now in fact it be a really relax race today and there be people who be quite old erm and lot of people be just walk it but one of the people erm injure themselves go up the hay bale because it be too difficult so i completely agree with you and i in fact i do say to cos he be like oh it look like so much fun and i really want to go but i can't cos i'm so unfit and that's what i say to him i say take your daughters to the one on that the child friendly one and cos you have to go around with them so if i if you guy both go then i have to go around with you of course and it'll be lot of fun erm and that that's a way of him see what he can do and also just see what it's like and then make him less scar cos it be a bite scary drive there on my own this morning obviously i didn't have anyone else to go with and i just think gosh what be it go to be like you know i just didn't have any i be i be really nervous but now i've do one i totally want to do heap and heap more and erm 's dad be do quite a scary one in september the spartan race and that's really full on and they've get a fire and stuff in it but i'm now think do you know what i think i'm gonna have a go cos at the end of the day it's gonna be no more than an hour and a half of my life and if i can't do you know all of the obstacles it doesn't really matter but it just make me realise today get up those hay bale and how easy it be that i'm actually really quite strong so i can do the run and i can do the pull up of the arm stuff so i reckon i've get a good chance of succeed that so i'm gonna give it a go what be your thoughts
S0654	i think
S0653	do you want yeah
S0654	you should do it mum
S0653	the spartan one
