S0255	mm
S0257	do you watch the secret life of dog
S0255	yeah
S0257	have you be
S0255	yeah i've be watch that
S0258	no i should watch that
S0257	i i should be record or set it to come on but i tend to just sort of catch it part way in
S0258	mm
S0257	and the first one i saw they be talk about overweight dog
S0258	mm
S0255	yeah
S0257	and they er invite owners into laboratory condition and say just prepare your dog's food
S0255	mm
S0258	mm
S0257	and this be all dry food and over eighty percent of owners weigh out too much or or they serve up too much food
S0258	mm
S0257	only about two out of twenty use a a er a scale or
S0255	mm
S0258	mm
S0257	or a receptacle that to to measure it out it's like when we fee i've get an old tupperware bowl and i know that about that far down from the top
S0258	mm
S0257	be the right
S0258	mm
S0257	weight for her
S0255	mm
S0257	but over eighty percent overfed and some of them you could see them they would sort of put some in look at it and go
S0258	mm
S0257	oh put a bite more in
S0255	mm
S0257	and they what they do be they set up cameras in people's home erm or or the environment the dog be in and sometimes it's about behaviours this time it be just about obese dog
S0258	mm
S0257	as i say and er there be this little i think it be a king charles spaniel or something quite little and he be a barrel
S0258	oh
S0257	and she say they be very careful they weigh his food out and he'll walk away from it in the even very often but what they didn't what the lady didn't realise her elderly mother live with them
S0258	oh no
S0257	and she would sit in the live room with a tray
S0255	mm
S0257	and the family would sit in the in the kitchen or on the din room so the dog would go into the live room and just sit like that so mum old dear would every single time would fee the dog
S0258	oh no
S0257	and er they they run a pub
S0255	mm
S0257	so in the even the dog would be down in the pub as well and they put cameras up there and the bar staff erm be lovely to this to the little dog and all the customers be but they be sort of use the dog as entertainment
S0258	oh no
S0255	mm
S0257	throw pork scratch
S0257	and they be slide them along the floor and the dog be hurtle along so it's er
S0255	mm
S0257	they say it's actually get some exercise
S0255	mm
S0257	so it's better than just feed it so it's get some exercise
S0257	but it would go through two packets of pork scratch a night
S0258	oh no
S0257	and then eventually cos it keep look at it's dinner go mm that's not pork scratch
S0255	no
S0257	but eventually it would come back to it and it would eat all that on top of everything else
S0255	mm
S0257	and the poor woman be absolutely horrify
S0257	that er everybody else be feed this dog
S0258	i think dog be like that aren't they cos they'll just eat whatever's in front of em won't they or i always i don't really know that much about dog but say you like
S0257	some breed
S0258	some breed will
S0257	will will eat er be it labradors or er be know for do that
S0258	mm
S0255	mm
S0258	mm
S0257	our dog she tend to she's get she's get ocd as well it doesn't matter how full her bowl be
S0255	yeah
S0257	it's like you cut it in half she will eat half of it
S0258	mm
S0257	but she'll eat half of it down to the bottom of the bowl and it's
S0257	it's like a solid wall of food and then the other half the bowl be full
S0258	yeah
S0257	and she she never eat more and she rarely eat less it's half the bowl you can see she's
S0257	measure it out she's go right that's it and then she'll go back to the rest of it later but later could be four or five hours later even
S0258	oh see my
S0257	but there's nobody else in the house that will eat it she know that
S0258	oh yeah so she know it's safe
S0255	mm
S0257	but the cat will go and have a little look
S0258	yeah
S0257	but the cat and the dog share the same water bowl
S0258	yeah
S0257	but the the the biscuits be too big for our cat to eat
S0255	mm
S0257	so yeah she's never have never go hungry she's get no reason to to worry and and just eat it all really quickly
S0258	yeah that it might be eat
S0255	mm
S0258	see my mother in law's dog won't eat in front of you like if you put her food out you have to go out the room
S0258	she'll only eat or she'll take it and she'll go in the corner and she'll eat herself dog be weird
S0255	strange
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0258	dog be strange
S0257	will get a mouthful of biscuits and our we've get a kitchen diner the kitchen part of it where all the work units be
S0258	mm
S0257	it's get a erm er a washable floor but where the din room part be it's it's carpet
S0258	mm
S0257	so she'll she'll her food be on the
S0258	mm
S0257	on the hard surface so she'll go and get a mouthful carry it over to the carpet put it all down on the carpet and then pick it up off there
S0258	oh
S0257	and i don't know why i don't know why she do it
S0255	strange mm
S0257	there's no rhyme or reason unless she just doesn't like stand on that floor
S0255	could be mm
S0258	oh animals

S0257	mm
S0255	erm and er it be really interest they start show how how we see things cos light bounce off it
S0258	mm
S0257	mm
S0255	and obviously if it's a prism or the rainbow
S0257	mm
S0255	you can see all the different colour
S0258	mm
S0255	and how different animals use different layer of the spectrum of the colour to actually enable them to hunt and and survive
S0258	mm
S0255	erm and it go right through to infrared where where er a snake erm which be some sort of bat eat snake it be call or something erm but it use to be in the cave with the bat and it actually use infrared
S0258	ah

S0258	mm
S0255	with the with the animals
S0258	that's amaze
S0257	mm
S0255	and the other end of the spectrum be the erm er like ultraviolet
S0258	uhu
S0255	that sort of and and it be show the the animals that use that and
S0258	mm
S0255	and how show it it be like fly with all the millions of eye and how they can see
S0257	mm
S0255	in slow motion and how this be why you can never sort of hit a fly with it or
S0258	yeah

S0255	just cos er i happen to be flick through and it be the first one as a coincidence when i start watch it
S0258	yeah
S0255	and i watch that series but apart from that erm one the other time i've go in i've not be interest in it cos i think er it's it's very much like with the british bake off you get to know the people and you like them
S0258	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0258	it's the character yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm same with america's next top model and all those sort of things if you start watch any any of those things
S0257	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	you need to watch them sort of from the begin
S0258	oh definitely yeah
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah no i've kind of give up with next top model cos i do start watch it

S0258	oh okay
S0255	and then social media all these photos be put up and er at the end social media have a vote to put one person back in

S0258	a little bite
S0255	whether it's for the final or mm
S0258	oh that's good

S0258	he's not the wrestle guy someone else just so you know
S0255	no just another one
S0258	it's not the wrestle guy
S0257	not the weird one
S0255	not the weird wrestle one

S0258	erm well he live on his own
S0255	mm
S0258	he use to share a house with his brother but his brother's move out now and i would probably say he's a little bite set in his ways
S0255	mm
S0258	cos he's live on his own for quite a while and he's he's quite tidy and he just he probably doesn't go out that much maybe
S0257	but that must mean that he's get
S0255	's 's not tidy i don't know how that would work
S0258	but i dunno if he's look for the right person to
S0255	would he would he tidy up after her she might like that
S0258	i don't know if he's look for the he need the right person to bring him out of his shell a little bite you know
S0257	mm
S0255	yeah mm
S0258	there's potential there
S0255	yeah it's funny cos she's quite chatty and bright but er she's actually really quite shy
S0258	yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	she have she say it's funny because you know normally when people start to get interest in each other there's a bite of a do he like me doesn't he oh he say that what do that mean
S0258	mm
S0255	oh well i'll say so and so and i'll text and she say it's that excitement bubble she absolutely hat that it terrify her
S0257	yeah
S0258	do it
S0255	er well not even not so much terrify she just doesn't enjoy it
S0258	mm
S0255	she say i just we start a bite like this she say and and i just wanna say to them look be something gonna happen be it go somewhere
S0255	cos if it be that's great let's just get on you know
S0258	mm
S0255	and go out and see what happen
S0257	if not
S0255	or if not er er cos er i don't like this
S0255	and or i do you just wanna be a friend and so she's sort of almost like feel and she have to hold back
S0258	yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	and she sort of go mm i really really get in a tizzy about it bless her but oh i'm sure it'll happen i'm i'm sure it'll happen
S0257	i would hate to be a teenager early twenties and set out on the
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	journey to find a a life partner
S0255	mm
S0258	it's all different now though it's like everyone do online don't they
S0255	yeah
S0257	that's how i meet though online
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah but even like at work the one he be he meet his girlfriend when he be twenty one and she be twenty three online and i be really surprise by that
S0255	mm
S0258	cos i always think that i know people my age use
S0255	mm
S0258	online date but i didn't think someone in their early twenties would
S0255	no yeah they do
S0258	cos i think surely they're use the the same old meet in the bar and stuff
S0257	yeah
S0258	but no
S0255	no no
S0257	no
S0258	it's across the board now it's everyone isn't it
S0257	it be absolutely yeah
S0255	mm mm
S0258	yeah
S0257	and i think it's partly because some people be er nervous about meet somebody they don't know and be with er be in the same room or go on a date
S0258	yeah
S0257	with somebody they don't know whereas online you can get to know people well you
S0258	yeah email and phone and
S0255	yeah
S0257	if you've get if you haven't get a weirdo on the other end
S0258	yeah that's the thing you have to filter
S0255	mm
S0257	you can get to know somebody before you actually meet them
S0258	yeah
S0257	and at least know things about them and about their character sense of humour and that sort of thing and their interest
S0255	mm
S0258	but even if you be search like you can filter down people they always say what they're look for don't they
S0255	mm
S0257	yeah
S0258	so there's none of that kind of like if
S0258	if you want children
S0255	yeah
S0258	you want someone who want children and someone that
S0257	yeah
S0258	specifically say i don't want children you're like okay
S0255	yeah
S0258	i i don't want him you know you can
S0257	mm
S0255	mm
S0258	get you know get to the right person
S0255	just like that that advert where the guy's sit there with a camel next to him
S0257	camel yeah
S0255	on this date website you er you you like long walk on the beach and in the sand or something on this website you'd be a match
S0257	and they're both the same age yeah
S0255	and they're yeah it's like mm yeah
S0255	it's funny
S0257	mm
S0255	but i think with thing like tinder now which i mean i'm
S0258	oh yeah
S0255	i'm not on but i think that just show you who's in the same area doesn't it and you can start chat or stuff
S0258	i think that's more for
S0255	young
S0258	hook up like
S0255	yeah that's no and that's what i be gonna
S0255	i be gonna say that though because
S0257	's daughter go on didn't she
S0255	yeah mm
S0257	get an alert or something
S0255	yeah she get an alert that she'd go on that er just
S0258	yeah
S0255	i be just think er cos of that my one of my oh what be it somebody vaguely in the family's daughter they send a a snapshot on facebook and say look this be er you know only on tinder or whatever and somebody have go oh hi how be you i'm okay how be you and he say shall we play pearl harbour and she go what's that i lay back and i'm japan and you come in and blow me or something
S0257	oh my god
S0255	and it's just like she go oh my god send it to the lad's bible and wait to see if i can get famous
S0258	yeah
S0257	no
S0258	oh my god
S0255	and it's like say so it'll say tinder
S0258	yeah
S0255	although the idea be oh well you can see who be er yeah it be
S0257	yeah
S0255	basically just a
S0258	make me a bite uncomfortable though
S0255	yeah
S0258	know that people can see exactly where you be
S0257	mm
S0255	you can switch your location service off they can't
S0258	oh oh can you
S0255	well not on tinder
S0258	not on tinder
S0255	i don't know on tinder the whole point of tinder be i think be that
S0258	yeah you can yeah
S0255	yeah it's who's there but
S0258	yeah
S0255	no no i mean generally it's like when everything's post on facebook now and it say where you be when you post it so
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah yeah
S0255	but you can switch that off as well can't you
S0258	you can turn it off yeah
S0257	yes yeah
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	i think it's just a lot of people don't know what you can and can't do and
S0258	no
S0255	they don't know what's happen when you've get thing like this facebook messenger now have you see that now
S0258	oh yes
S0255	if you've get iphone's
S0258	yeah
S0255	you have to have the messenger it's the only way you can see message and if you've get that it then get access to everything
S0258	yeah
S0257	really
S0255	erm and there's all the and i keep read different bits and think well but you can't get off it if you want to do messenger
S0257	no
S0258	yeah
S0255	and the whole thing i like on facebook be you have messenger and you could be if you're on the pc you could be chat to people or you're chat on your phone to people
S0257	mm
S0255	at the same time as be on facebook
S0258	yeah yeah
S0255	but now it have to go into this different app and if this other app's take all this sort of stuff and you keep go in try to change the settings and you think well actually it sound like they're be a bite naughty
S0258	it's a little bite strange isn't it yeah
S0257	cos there have be time where you know you might be a might be a game or something that look interest or er or
S0255	mm
S0257	some kind of app within facebook and you think oh yeah i'll have a look at that
S0255	yeah
S0257	and then it say to do this you need to allow
S0258	yeah
S0257	access all of your information blah and
S0255	yeah yeah yeah yeah and allow it to post on your behalf
S0257	yeah
S0255	and i'm like

S0258	oh
S0257	i know
S0258	that's a bite
S0255	be that so people don't know you're dead or do it say by the way i die this be what i think
S0257	but you but you can yeah you you can set message

S0257	yeah
S0255	and i do that so often i read book
S0257	yeah
S0255	and then i totally forget i've read them
S0258	oh really
S0257	mm
S0255	and i can get em and i start read it and i start think this be a bite familiar
S0255	this be this be actually very familiar do i do i think i've read this
S0257	that's the only thing i've erm i don't like about my kindle
S0255	mm
S0257	cos when you when you're read a book book
S0255	mm
S0257	the first thing you do be you see the title
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	and and then you crack it open to where you need to be but with your kindle you just switch it on it go straight to that page
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0257	and i'm every time i read something on a kindle i can't remember what it's call
S0255	mm can't remember what book you're read
S0257	i don't know what it's call cos i i only it's only when we're in book club that we say this be the title of it
S0255	mm
S0257	and then you download it
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	and you don't see the title again normally after that
S0255	mm
S0258	do you know i have to admit i really do miss read proper book erm cos i take erm i let have three pound a week pocket money and he can usually get like a kid's book but he get one for four pound this week but we go into wh smith and you know when you walk past like all the bestsellers
S0255	yeah
S0258	that's where i use to always
S0255	yeah
S0257	mm
S0258	look for book but i don't even like you know i just walk straight past it now and i do think
S0255	yeah
S0258	oh i do look at one and think oh it look nice
S0257	mm
S0258	i'll look at that on amazon later but
S0255	mm
S0258	i you know that feel of actually have book
S0257	yeah
S0255	cos i use to go to charity shop
S0258	oh yeah i love go to charity shop yeah
S0255	i use to go and rummage through charity shop or boot fair or something and just go along
S0257	tesco's be fab
S0258	yeah yeah yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	on at the right time because they they're sell book for diabetes
S0258	the offer yeah
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	so fifty p for a paperback
S0255	yeah
S0257	pound of a hardback
S0258	yeah
S0255	well i think that but i know i wouldn't actually want to read a book again because the odd time we've have a book with book club that we've only be able to get in er in an actual book copy i've really er not like have to carry a book with me so when i
S0258	that's the only thing
S0255	when i'm wait somewhere and i'd flick it on my phone maybe and read four or five page while i'm in the queue somewhere
S0257	mm
S0255	i can't do that if i've actually get a book to you er
S0258	yeah
S0255	cos you don't get the book out and stand and
S0257	yeah
S0258	that's the thing yeah
S0255	that sort of stuff so yeah i must admit i that's the only only thing i don't like now and that's why i don't i always read
S0257	the convenience
S0258	yeah
S0255	i know cos i've get the app on the on the apple ipad
S0258	yeah
S0255	so i'll just have that with me all the time and read that erm
S0258	i know get mad at me cos he's always like oh you should just why don't you use your kindle but that app be so good
S0255	mm
S0258	cos i read often read on my phone or my ipad whatever
S0257	mm
S0255	yeah yeah i do
S0258	whatever i can really
S0255	well i say my kindle i've get a kindle from when i have it originally and i take that on holiday so if i'm on the beach
S0258	yeah it's perfect isn't it
S0255	that's or by the pool or something like that
S0257	mm
S0255	i've get that
S0258	it's perfect
S0255	because i know then i don't mind if that get a bite of sand on it or a bite of whatever
S0258	yeah
S0255	it's not my ipad
S0258	exactly
S0257	mm
S0255	and you can actually get erm the internet on that as well now can't you on the kindle
S0258	oh yeah yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	well you can could anyway but mine be sort of a test thing of it when they be test it
S0257	and be it you that say when you get your your kindle you you actually get it because you be feed up with have a laptop in bed and you find the
S0255	no
S0257	er somebody say to me they'd get a erm one of the kindle's with internet access because their laptop be too cumbersome in bed
S0255	mm
S0257	so they buy the kindle
S0255	yeah
S0257	to use for the internet
S0255	yeah
S0257	not for not for read book
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0257	just because of its erm of the of the convenience of its size and everything
S0255	mm
S0258	i be really resistant to have a kindle like when they first come out
S0255	yeah oh i be
S0258	i think oh i wouldn't want that
S0255	that's what i say to all the time
S0258	yeah oh why would i want that
S0255	no
S0258	but then my sister get one and she keep rave about it so then i sort of look at hers and think oh that would be handy
S0255	mm
S0258	and then you don't look back then do you
S0257	i'd never even look at one in the shop i cos i
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0257	be er a book lover
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah
S0257	i love book
S0258	yeah
S0255	mm
S0255	not anything else but i have when i first get a blackberry it come with a few book on it er sherlock holmes
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah
S0257	and a bite of shakespeare and something and so i i just start read them
S0255	mm
S0257	and then hadn't even mention a kindle hadn't mention a kindle and he just buy me one out the blue for christmas
S0255	mm
S0257	and i kind of say to him that's really kind but i don't know if i'll use it really
S0255	yeah
S0257	and he's never touch it because he love book so much but i would take them like if if we when we go to dublin i'll read on the plane
S0255	mm
S0257	you you're hardly up there for fifty minutes
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	so you just pull it out read a couple of page and
S0255	mm
S0257	and tuck it away but i wouldn't do that with a book because i'd be afraid of damage it or
S0255	what read it on a plane
S0257	well just try to shove it in a case or
S0255	or just shove it oh yeah yeah yeah
S0258	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0257	you know have a big enough handbag or something for it and
S0255	mm
S0258	mm
S0257	and spoil it
S0258	see i love the choice
S0255	mm
S0258	cos i think there's nothing worse than if you say i use to if you're go on holiday i'll buy like five or six book
S0255	yeah
S0257	mm
S0258	i'll be really excite about this be what i'm gonna read on holiday but if you get a rubbish one i'll be like oh don't wanna read that
S0257	yeah i don't wanna read
S0255	mm
S0258	i'll leave that here
S0255	yeah
S0258	and then i'll be like oh i'll read the next one but obviously when you're carry like five hundred book around with you
S0255	yeah yeah
S0258	you don't really have that problem
S0257	mm
S0255	no that's it
S0257	no
S0255	well get me my kindle erm it be when we start go out to that chalet in france for ski
S0258	yeah
S0257	mm
S0255	and he'd be out there for so long and i'd be fly backwards and forward and he get me it for christmas and he say i know you don't want one he say but i just think even if you just read it literally when you're on the plane
S0258	yeah
S0255	er up and down and then er just use it like that and i start use it and that be it that's
S0258	mm
S0257	mm
S0255	so the only book i've read since be one that i read to try and help me with my maths which be er for like about teenage lads to help them with their maths and stuff and i think oh yeah and it's really good or primary school lads erm but apart from that er it's only be when book club it's
S0258	yeah
S0255	we can't get it on

S0258	yeah i'm the same
S0257	yeah yeah

S0255	to keep it open so i do i do miss book but i know i'd never read them again now in the same way because
S0258	yeah
S0255	er i've as i say i've be condition into do this
S0258	we've move on

S0258	that's it we have haven't we
S0255	yeah
S0258	but erm i have start cos i've get so many book in there but i be say to that if i hadn't buy the kindle cos i've have the kindle probably about as long as you maybe like three years four years if not longer
S0255	mm yeah
S0258	imagine how many book we would have
S0255	yeah
S0258	if we didn't have the kindle
S0255	mm
S0258	i be say i'd probably have about another two hundred book where would i have put them
S0255	yeah yeah
S0258	erm but my mother in law always use to for my birthday she'd like spend like say fifty pound on new book for me on amazon
S0255	mm
S0258	and like no one can buy you book any more can they
S0255	no
S0258	that's the only thing like you can't get book as present

S0255	anyway back to the book
S0258	mm yes
S0257	mm
S0255	so right yeah as as i say i read it over a year ago when
S0257	yep
S0255	recommend it to me
S0257	mm
S0255	erm and it's funny because it be only when you say this i read it and i enjoy it
S0258	yeah
S0255	erm things like er the flora whatever her name at some point through it she start to really annoy me cos i be think
S0258	yeah
S0255	if i be there i'd probably've slap her round the face and tell her to get off and you know let me carry on er with my own life and
S0257	yeah no weird interbreed line
S0255	and it just yeah and and like at the end when matey fly in and then she go off and they live happily ever after i suddenly think it change into a totally different book
S0258	yeah
S0255	because it be suddenly you didn't need the big cheesy grin at the end with them get marry and
S0258	yeah
S0255	live er happily ever after i love the things like the name of the cow
S0257	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	be it feckless
S0258	pointless
S0255	pointless
S0258	aimless
S0257	graceless
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah er yeah so er i i love all that sort of stuff but it be only when you say er recommend it for this time and say erm oh it's your favourite satire and all this sort of thing
S0258	yeah
S0255	and when i actually look and i be try to buy it and wonder why it wouldn't let me buy it again and i be see the things with the review and i think actually cos i didn't read it at all as a satire book
S0258	oh okay
S0255	and it be only when i look and saw sort of start look into it again and saw the character name mrs smile who be the nice and i suddenly think and it be like this big penny drop
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	and i totally miss all i just read it as a book without
S0257	mm
S0255	and when i start go through it think back to it i think oh yes oh and that's why they be call oh right oh and big business the bull and you
S0257	mm
S0255	and all this sort of stuff and just and i i say i hadn't read it like that but i do really enjoy it i do do really enjoy it apart from the when she start to annoy me to a certain point and
S0257	yeah
S0255	things like when it be all be build up i think when it be gonna be be it for the wed some somebody's wed they be organise in the house
S0257	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	and they be try to do it without the old lady know
S0258	yeah
S0255	and it be all gonna be fine and then they get her down and then it be just you sort of think well that be set things up so much for a fall that actually
S0257	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	real life even fantasy life they wouldn't have do that because that be just stupid so
S0258	yeah
S0255	things like that annoy me but erm but yeah i suppose the quote cos i give it seven out of ten
S0257	okay
S0255	erm and er i just great escapism
S0258	great
S0255	yeah
S0258	oh i've write load i'll fill it up as there's only us three
S0258	so okay shall i go next
S0255	mm
S0258	erm i give it nine out of ten i will say it's my favourite book cos i always think that it's like me and my sister's kind of sense of humour
S0257	mm
S0258	like we find it i always still find it really funny like whenever we go on train we always say like don't forget to fee the parrot and like no one really get it but
S0255	mm
S0258	i just i think oh my sister read it when she be about fourteen and i think i must have read it i would've be about fifteen i think so we're yeah it's like a really sort of old book
S0255	impressionable age
S0257	mm
S0255	mm
S0258	yeah we just i find it really funny it's my sense of humour i guess
S0257	i find it very witty i've i i do like i like all of the character even the miserable old woman upstairs
S0255	mm
S0257	even the the ones that you want to slap i think i think there be all it be very quaint and paint the author have paint
S0255	mm
S0257	really lovely picture of of all the character and really set the scenes and when they be decorate the farm for the wed
S0255	yeah
S0257	you could picture what they be do with all the flower and erm just create great image
S0255	mm
S0257	i i think but er i can't say it make me laugh out loud necessarily but i do sort of titter
S0255	mm
S0257	at at several little bits and it do encourage me to look to see what other book the author have write on that same on the cold comfort theme so erm yes i'll be i'll look out for them and get them once i work my way through my backlist of of book to read that's those be on the list as well
S0255	mm
S0258	i've get another one i could recommend you if you like this erm by nancy mitford call er move over darling which be a bite sort of er nineteen thirties kind of satirey kind of one
S0257	mm
S0258	but they're kind of cos erm the mitford sisters be really interest cos i only realise when i i think i pick that up in a charity shop and i i find it really funny and it be just about i haven't read it for age but like english girl marry this french guy and they have this child and then they're gonna split up but then the child's try to get em back together
S0255	mm
S0258	but again it's quite witty but she be one of erm think her sister be like a nazi wasn't she or something they're all quite famous like i think all there be erm two or three and they're like quite well breed kind of post world war two family
S0255	mm
S0258	and one of them be an author one of em i think be very high up with hitler like a british girl who run off to germany to join the nazis and the other one's do various bits and bob as well i think one of em be in the fascists or something like the british union of fascists but they're all really interest anyway
S0255	mm
S0258	so that's i think it's call move over darling that's quite good be it move over darling or something it's get darling
S0257	yeah move over
S0258	be it call that what's it get
S0258	what's the what's the rat on amazon it might have a i've tell you this and it might have a really bad rat
S0257	christine stovell
S0258	no
S0257	oh
S0258	let me put in the author's name cos it might not be move over darling it might be something darling
S0258	i'll know from when i see it
S0257	because move over darling be a film with erm
S0258	that's it no sorry it's call the bless something totally different

S0258	lovely
S0255	mm
S0258	what we should do
S0258	we should do the next meet shouldn't we
S0255	we should
S0257	yeah
S0255	do you want to know about the next book
S0258	oh yes yeah sorry let me just er
S0257	how be we choose the next book
S0255	well er it's still off that list isn't it so
S0258	do you wanna just choose any book
S0257	i don't have i don't have the list
S0258	no
S0255	oh well er but it be say on say on facebook do i have the list
S0258	that's really stupid
S0255	but yeah
S0257	and you be honest
S0255	i say i do
S0258	why didn't you lie
S0255	cos she be gonna send me it if i didn't have it
S0257	oh flip
S0258	can you not
S0255	well
S0258	can you not just choose a book cos i think i'd much rather read a book every book that you've choose i've really enjoy actually
S0255	yeah er yeah that's true erm in that case i'll i'll hold i think what we need to do be maybe put a motion forward that we don't do the list because i mean for me it's alright have this list and and want to read lot of other book that be like this and like that but then when it's her turn she can choose a book like that and we can read it
S0258	she choose a thriller though the irony of it be be
S0257	yeah
S0255	she choose i be pilgrim didn't she
S0258	she choose i be pilgrim which be the best thriller of the best thrillers of the lot
S0255	and that be one of the best book we've read yeah
S0257	when be his next book come out hasn't it go to print
S0255	well no he's er he's get erm two three and four in his head ready but he's gonna do the screenplay for erm i be pilgrim
S0257	i be pilgrim
S0258	oh that'll be a good film though
S0255	so yeah but cos he be his background be write screenplays isn't it
S0258	yeah yeah
S0255	action film
S0257	well as long as it's not tom cruise play
S0255	well no
S0258	i think it'd be better as a tv series
S0255	depend if tom cruise'll erm if he buy
S0258	yeah
S0255	the right to the film then he'll be in it i'm sure
S0258	probably will
S0255	but it'll be i'm hop he's gonna he'll get the other book go and get the next book come out
S0257	mm
S0255	but he say he wasn't gonna spend all the time write the second one until he know how the first one be receive
S0255	and then everybody love it so
S0257	yeah exactly so he need to get his finger out and
S0255	mm
S0257	get the next one out
S0255	yeah
S0258	i hope it's not too rush if he do it as a film cos a lot happen doesn't it they don't wanna miss any things out
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0258	it'd be better as a tv like a homeland kinda
S0255	yeah series
S0258	tv series wouldn't it
S0255	yeah yeah i think so
S0258	yeah oh sorry
S0257	sorry
S0255	mm
S0258	right shall we do our next date
S0257	mm
S0255	yes let's do the next date
S0258	yeah let's do the date so
S0255	and then i think what we need to do be have a bite of a chat with everyone involve and say let's decide what we're do for the book and stuff
S0257	or
S0258	it's get too complicate now as well because you know how be ask who choose and everything
S0255	yeah
S0258	i think no one's get a grip on what's actually happen
S0257	yeah
S0255	no
S0257	and i don't think that's any any person's fault anybody's fault at all
S0258	no no no not at all
S0257	we've just kind of lose our way a little bite
S0255	mm
S0257	i think as well where we've have people drop out
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	people have come in so they've
S0257	the rota's get shorter because the number of people be er less
S0255	yeah yeah this be it yeah
S0257	what if here's a suggestion what if you just choose a book
S0255	mm
S0257	nominate a book
S0255	mm
S0257	if you have one in mind that that you'd like to and then we say erm whilst we know we've get the list
S0255	mm
S0257	we couldn't actually or or you couldn't find one that you would personally nominate
S0255	mm
S0257	so if nobody have an any objection you'd like to nominate a different book if if anybody
S0255	mm 's yeah
S0258	yeah go on
S0257	if anybody object strongly
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	then we can revisit the list
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah that's a good idea
S0255	yeah because i mean i've find one that i look er cos i be the thing be i start look at all these different ones
S0257	mm
S0255	and think no no no no no and then i find one
S0257	and if nothing really jump out
S0255	well i find one that i think i be actually chuckle read it but it's mean to be one that people either laugh out loud and think really funny
S0258	yeah
S0255	or don't get in the slightest so i think well that could get a good discussion go
S0258	mm
S0257	mm
S0255	but erm no i think i'll er i'll have to have a think though cos i haven't get a i don't wanna just
S0258	well of course yeah yeah of course
S0255	choose one else it won't be a very good one
S0257	i mean list as well it depend how they're compile
S0255	mm
S0258	mm
S0257	doesn't it if they're if they're if it's compile by sales then it just mean a lot of people have buy it not necessarily a lot of people have really really like it
S0255	yeah
S0258	yeah
S0255	but this list it's a hundred book to read before you die and it's be compile by somebody so it's all the greats and the this and the that
S0257	but who who say it's great
S0255	well exactly yeah yeah
S0258	mm
S0257	this be an argument that and i have very often and er well you know
S0255	mm
S0257	you watch these top ten of this and top ten of that
S0258	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0257	and we'll be scream at the tv say well who choose not in my top ten
S0258	yeah
S0255	no exactly what about this what about that
S0257	who put that one in there yeah yeah
S0255	mm yeah okay that's fine so let's do a date one two three four
S0258	the ninth
S0257	so you need to be after the
S0255	well my operation's the thirteenth

S0258	yeah i can do the thirtieth
S0257	thirtieth's good for me
S0255	yeah
S0258	well let's say the thirtieth
S0255	okay which i'm gonna write that down instead of erm
S0258	it's sort of it's get really strange with the choices do you do you
S0255	yeah thank
S0257	mm
S0258	with all the book choices now though hasn't it because it's like you're choose tonight but then on your night be choose i'm guess or it's like you know what i mean it's don't worry it's all get a bite topsy turvy hasn't it
S0255	yeah i think i think it have and the thing be cos we
S0258	yeah
S0255	cos we've often host for other people anyway
S0258	that's it as well yeah yeah
S0255	which have get it out of but that doesn't matter cos we've er so you don't always choose on the night that you're host
S0258	yeah exactly yeah yeah
S0255	but actually it's yeah it's get a bite out of sync but i can't remember what say so i think it's i'm choose that i think oh wasn't mean to be choose next time
S0258	maybe that's why cos i've definitely do three so i know i've i'm cos people have only have two
S0255	yeah oh no i've do i've do two yeah
S0258	yeah so
S0257	yeah i've do two i think excuse me i think say she's do three
S0255	mm
S0258	have she do three
S0257	excuse me i can't remember if that's what she say
S0258	pilgrim
S0255	i don't know
S0258	no me neither
S0255	i'm gonna stop this
S0258	well we say book club at 's house book to be
S0255	yeah to be confirm
S0258	to be confirm
S0257	's choose three say i've choose twice host twice can't remember when i last choose but it be i be pilgrim
S0258	i think it's cos
S0257	and she and 's say it be a year ago cos it be a book club that she be in new new york
S0255	yeah she be in new york wasn't she
S0258	we have that rota didn't we
S0255	yeah
S0258	and i think probably cos i've i bet it be then it be me who've choose three
S0255	yeah
S0258	and then i bet the next one be the one where it all
S0257	mm
S0258	you know like get change and everything
S0257	cos on tuesday even say how about choose next and the one after then
S0255	mm but then it's sort of like hasn't come tonight
S0258	yeah
S0255	and you just sort of think i think
S0257	and she hasn't respond to that either
S0255	no i think er er to me it's almost like we need people that be come er that can come and if people want to come and go
S0258	yeah
S0255	then they just go along with the book that we're do
S0258	yeah
S0255	cos it'd be a shame it er it's be so good it'd be a shame if it do drift out i mean er
S0258	yeah
S0255	it's be over two years we've be do it
S0258	yeah
S0257	yeah er i think
S0255	and it's you know i've make some really good friends with
S0258	exactly
S0255	with come do this but
S0258	oh i really don't want it to fizzle out
S0255	no
S0258	but i i do think that this new way of choose book be to blame a little bite but i wasn't there for that one so i
S0255	no i wasn't
S0258	i would've strongly oppose it
S0255	yeah
S0258	cos i like choose book that erm other you know cos i like
S0255	yeah cos it's a book you've enjoy and it you
S0258	yeah
S0255	not that you think everybody else be go to necessarily enjoy it cos some people won't
S0258	yeah
S0255	but it it's a book that you know you think be a good book
S0258	yeah
S0255	rather than just pick a book out of the air you can look at review and you can look at this that and the other but
S0258	but even if we be want to do something different you know like richard and judy do their like book club list
S0255	yeah
S0258	even we could go through that
S0255	yeah
S0258	cos they're all a lot of those like the house at riverton like those book like
S0255	mm
S0258	they're all on there aren't they
S0255	mm
S0258	like all those kind of bestseller type book
S0255	yeah
S0258	if we want to do something that wasn't all classics
S0255	yeah and plus er yeah there must be some sort of book club recommend this
S0258	yeah book club recommendation
S0255	yeah
S0257	mm
S0258	cos a lot sometimes a lot of the kindle book have the book book club note at the back don't they note for book club
S0255	yeah that's right yeah and question for book club be that be that something
S0257	yeah
S0258	i think they must be
S0257	discussion point
S0258	yeah discussion point and things
S0255	cos we use to all talk about it and then we use to er use to ask a question didn't we like the person whose book it was'd ask a question
S0258	yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	about the book and everybody have
S0258	oh yeah yeah we use to do it properly yeah
S0255	yeah and we use to do a lot more structure like that and then i think it then get cos obviously get more and more friendly and chat more and things go on
S0258	yeah
S0255	and
S0258	yeah
S0255	which be great and it but it's almost like we think well we need to maybe have social time as well as
S0258	yeah
S0255	which we you know we have do we've do christmas and we've have the anniversary and
S0257	mm
S0258	yeah
S0255	and that sort of stuff and
S0257	cheese and wine
S0255	cheese and wine
S0258	oh yeah
S0255	lot of cheese
S0257	mm
S0255	more cheese more cheese
S0258	mm
S0257	a beehive
S0255	beehive
S0258	that be good
S0255	yeah yeah so maybe
S0258	yeah
S0255	we need to be do stuff like that and have the social side and then try and keep the book not not talk and chat and stuff but
S0258	yeah
S0255	make sure we have a structure book club bite for it
S0257	yeah a a focus night
S0255	mm
S0258	cos 's usually quite good at do that but i think she's cos i don't know if it's cos she's busy but she seem to have like
S0255	yeah
S0258	step back a little bite from it
S0255	mm
S0258	now doesn't she
