S0246	they've get chickens up at the erm animal sanctuary
S0245	do they
S0246	bird
S0245	chickens be weird
S0246	it's really oh honest to god right i would love that if we ever have enough money that's what we're do
S0246	we'll open our own sanctuary cos i think that would be like my ultimate like dream like to do that
S0249	mm
S0246	but it take a couple of million to like get it up off the grind
S0249	yeah cos then as well you've gotta cater for that i hate be
S0246	cos it's a non profit as well
S0249	yeah so how do they take the money
S0246	erm because they have load of people who go up and volunteer to like walk the dog and stuff like that
S0249	yeah
S0246	people donate stuff like all the time erm people do like run and stuff and like raise money for them they do they do load of fundraisers
S0249	yeah
S0246	themselves and then the society at uni do fundraisers erm and stuff and then yeah it's just and they've get the café as well they've get like a café
S0249	yeah
S0246	there so like be you paint up i'm paint across which way be we go
S0249	doesn't really matter cos you can't really tell the brushstrokes
S0246	okay erm but yeah
S0246	they've get a they've get a café as well erm so if people go up there and they take their kid and stuff on weekend to go and like see the see the dog and like have a cake and some tea and a sandwich and whatever so they've get that that's all run by volunteer as well
S0249	yeah
S0246	and then they've get two shop like two charity shop
S0249	have they
S0246	as well so yeah they do like they do alright to be honest
S0249	er cos a lot of them be like a lot of sanctuaries where you go and buy the animal well you go and get the animal they ask for a donation don't they before you can take them
S0245	yeah
S0246	yeah
S0249	but but like
S0249	they're they're really good at like sort of erm like fit the animal to the right people and like if you go up to adopt an animal you're not allow to just like go and be like oh i wanna take it you have to like bring everybody up that's in your family include like any sort of animals
S0246	yeah
S0249	obviously not cat cos that's not but like if you've get other dog to bring up to see what they're like together and see what they're like with other people the
S0245	oh
S0245	yeah
S0249	so like you go up and and that and you're like you er you take them on a walk and then you go up again and you take them away for like half a day
S0245	yeah
S0246	ah
S0249	and then you bring them back and then you sort of like make a decision
S0245	yeah
S0246	well it's like adopt a child isn't it
S0245	yeah
S0249	yeah but they've just get another dog up now he's old he's he's erm his parent well they be like parent aren't they he's like erm the people that own him have to give him up cos they're too old so they can't look after him
S0246	and no one'll get take him dog there
S0249	i'll go up and i'll probably go up and go and start walk him to be honest
S0245	ah
S0245	what's he call
S0249	he's call i can't he begin with b it's like it's it's a weird name
