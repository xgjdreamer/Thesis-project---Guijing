S0631	i dunno
S0632	so manage to cure his vegetarianism
S0631	okay
S0632	but
S0635	but i
S0632	why why do decide to eat meat
S0635	well cos he wasn't do it for ethical reason he be just raise as a vegetarian and he felt that he would be intolerant to meat if he eat it and he just and he's always be quite poor as well i think so
S0631	okay
S0635	he just avoid meat and then he be like oh i have no ethical objections and i'd like to try it so he make himself do it
S0631	interest i've know someone i go to uni with someone once who erm who be bring up a vegetarian but she she do eat meat but she mainly just have fish cos she really like it that's a story isn't it
S0632	yeah i really like fish like a lot and
S0631	even the wiggly ones as well
S0632	i like the idea of be a vegetarian and i'm not sure how i feel about the lab meat
S0635	why
S0632	i'd try it but i really sincerely doubt that they're gonna get a fish texture right
S0635	well but it would be like biologically identical
S0631	how would they do it though would there be some sort of element of cruelty involve initially
S0635	what
S0632	would the lab meat have a face
S0631	no
S0635	no no i think they just you could just grow like a rump steak
S0631	but they're not gonna grow it from nothing so where have that come from so where's that that process that
S0635	they'll copy one i don't know
S0631	cos
S0635	i mean we know we already know like the you know genetic makeup of a cow rump no doubt just
S0631	yeah but would you not have have to have a cow in the first place and do something with that cow and would that not have
S0635	yeah but it's probably already do and it's for the good of like the future like you kill one cow so that they can all go free again and run around the cities
S0631	the cities
S0635	you know and go shop
S0631	i don't know it seem a bite too hypothetical for me to say cos i wouldn't be able to i wouldn't have i haven't get the facts do you know what i mean they haven't do it so i haven't get the facts so
S0635	yeah
S0631	i can't make
S0632	so you can't hypothetically decide whether or not you'll eat
S0631	i can't make an inform decision of whether i would or wouldn't
S0632	as in a yeah as a as a vegetarian you can't hypothetically decide whether you'd eat lab meat until
S0635	would you eat it if it be grow on the back of a mouse
S0631	no
S0631	of course i wouldn't
S0631	no with ears and in gcse english i read the article and cry
S0632	oh yeah i think i remember that
S0631	i just think i'm not do it i'm not cop i can't cope with this
S0632	it's too sad
S0635	yeah you're actually right i
S0631	then this
S0635	because and i be talk about where do vitamins come from like in vitamin tablets
S0631	yeah
S0635	and it's and yeah obviously it wouldn't be necessarily be directly harm animals but really
S0631	would they be exploit you know
S0635	nothing come from nowhere yeah
S0632	you can't just pluck the vitamins out of the air
S0635	no
S0632	they have to come from somewhere
S0631	mm mm
S0632	because they've get to be extract or create somehow
S0635	but it hasn't be do yet people think they're close but it hasn't be do
S0631	okay
S0635	so yes you'd have to
S0631	anywhere though that an animal be a commodity there be cruelty so if that be lab meat but animals be still be use in some way as the initial process be probably cruelty cos they just don't tend to get
S0632	that make sense cos that's a similar argument to the one about marginalise and oppress people cos like if there's a motivation to oppress someone to extract labour and erm
S0631	yeah
S0632	service from them and then yeah then you nothing's simple you can't just sweep it aside as no it doesn't exist
S0631	no
S0632	so yeah there's a motivation there to oppress
S0631	and like behind everything as well where you think you're gonna be do something like for the right reason but then somebody like be probably you know like if you buy something and you think you're do that for the right reason there's probably some sort of like some child might have do you know what i mean it's always something
S0632	there's always something like and that's the thing about the palm oil as well so you think you're eat clean and do your best and buy seasonal food and it's like yeah but my peanut butter have palm oil which be really harmful to the environment
S0631	yeah
S0632	and everything's just bugger up
S0631	i know i yeah
S0632	bugger
S0631	bugger
S0635	mm
S0632	lot of time
S0631	no it's nice
S0632	mm
S0632	yeah go for it please do
S0631	thank i will i will
S0632	you can move on up to the higher potato run potato mobility
S0631	there's a very limit bite of you know on it you know
S0632	rosemary
S0631	yes
S0632	yeah
S0631	rosemary
S0632	be you look for a scoop
S0635	yeah
S0632	or a way to
S0635	i would like something to extract all the vegetables
S0632	i don't know i i like the idea of eat very little meat i really love molluscs and they can't and no one else even like them why can't i have them
S0635	i i doubt they're the worst i mean
S0632	do you think should i investigate whether the fish practice that get molluscs be harmful to the environment
S0635	yes i also think just reduce the amount you would eat would be do a favour to the animals in some ways
S0631	but you should also look at erm who be involve with the farm industry problem okay there might be
S0635	and different countries will have different policies
S0631	there might be people get wage
S0632	yes
S0631	there might be people
S0635	mm mm but that's almost in everything and once you really get down to it
S0631	exactly
S0635	like you you basically
S0632	it's terrify
S0635	stop eat
S0631	so that's probably so that's why i be a bite like well i couldn't commit myself to this erm
S0635	no no
S0631	lab meat thing cos there'll be cruelty somewhere
S0635	yeah and
S0631	cos there's cruelty in everything there's probably cruelty in this potato
S0632	cruel free parsnips
S0635	and if you eat things that be only grow or make locally it's very expensive
S0631	mm mm
S0635	you know erm you know if if i have all the money in the world it would be very nice
S0631	i know
S0635	but that isn't
S0632	well we'll need to make our house a smallholding
S0635	mm mm
S0632	where we have chickens
S0635	oh yeah
S0632	chickens good
S0631	well that would be good would really like that
S0632	she can be the farm cat
S0635	yeah or the neighbourhood cat
S0631	to be honest she probably wouldn't know what to do with a chicken
S0632	well we've get fox too but they only eat jam sandwich
S0635	oh yeah
S0632	they wouldn't know what to do with
S0635	see the fox you haven't see the fox yet have you
S0631	no
S0632	i think it's the wrong time of year it's get dark too early that you're not gonna see them until the spring
S0635	yeah
S0632	unfortunately
S0635	if you're ever at the sink keep an eye out out of the window
S0632	it's a good fox watch spot the sink
S0635	mm mm
S0631	okay i will would you work in a an abattoir
S0635	yeah i mean well
S0631	you would
S0632	it wouldn't be your first choice would it
S0635	no
S0631	would you spend the day in an abattoir and not like cry
S0635	no i mean i yeah i've never be in one
S0632	i've never be to one
S0635	but yeah maybe it would change my mind i don't know i feel like if i'm gonna eat meat then i should
S0631	yeah but that's what my counter argument be that you couldn't you probably shouldn't
S0635	yeah
S0632	yeah
S0635	i i think i probably could but
S0632	my my erm argument about be able to eat meat do often stem from the fact that i you know pluck and gutted bird that i saw alive only a few second earlier and i never pull the trigger myself and and just
S0631	no
S0632	just bird as well nothing else but like so the idea of like kill a pig or a cow or something bigger and that's loud thank you
S0631	well i kind of erm you know my argument be though like if you're not like i think it would be fine if everyone hunt their own animals that would be fair game but the
S0635	mm mm
S0632	but they don't
S0631	the farm industry isn't like that
S0635	mm mm
S0632	no
S0631	erm so
S0632	no exactly and you're right yeah it's not the same thing
S0631	a bite like if you're prepare to put up with that and like would you be prepare to watch it whatever
S0632	it's it's a really i mean you're so right that me gutting and pluck a pheasant be not the same as me eat a factory farm chicken or cow or pig
S0631	yeah it's
S0632	it's not the same thing
S0631	and if it be your like your hunt like kind of instinctively you do that because you be hungry and blah blah blah blah blah yeah do it
S0635	mm
S0632	yeah yeah and that's like
S0631	because if you have to
S0632	you take all the food
S0631	for survival you would
S0632	yeah like you would take all the food that be on offer whether it be berry or bird
S0631	but like that's not
S0632	that's not the world we live in there's food aplenty
S0631	no
S0632	and and it's not the same
S0632	thing be my idyllic experience of you know the bird live wild and free up until the moment of its death that it didn't see come you know
S0631	yeah
S0632	which be just like nature be you know and it and it be much closer to be part of nature than buy food from an abattoir it's not the same
S0631	no
S0632	i get your point it be compel
S0631	kill them myself because i like to see the animals
S0632	that's a one hundred percent why you be and should be a vegetarian
S0631	yeah i wouldn't myself
S0632	you wouldn't even if
S0631	but i'm also up i like agree in freedom of choice
S0632	yeah
S0631	in a way
S0632	yeah no that make sense that make sense it's a personal personal choice do you wanna watch something
S0635	er er yes
S0632	okay
S0635	yes
S0632	we could watch a curb your enthusiasm even though it make me slightly nervous
S0635	maybe this one won't it's a new season
S0632	oh i hope things go better for larry
S0635	i think they never will
S0632	they never ever will
