S0086	yeah and you've be the mature person since you break up you're the one who say look i'm sorry for this i'm sorry for that and
S0041	i except this and he hasn't do anything
S0086	and he hasn't he hasn't take any of that on board himself
S0041	no
S0086	he hasn't reflect at all he's put it all on you
S0041	and that just show you exactly exactly how immature he be cos he's not he's not want to take that on board
S0086	yeah
S0041	and that's why we break up because he be immature so i mean really it's quite reassure to know that the decision i make back then be right
S0086	be the right one yeah
S0041	i be it be true for what i be think even though i be so close to the situation
S0086	that's it you get out at a good time really
S0041	yeah just not sure that anybody else be go to try and but i be say to today at work the way the way he's be now i mean i don't believe for one minute that he's be malicious you know he just doesn't know me better and he just need to grow up and learn that when he's get somebody to lean on who be go to come back in the peck order and and say okay we'll do this and he's always go to have someone to do it for him and right now that someone have get to be me
S0086	and you can't keep make allowance for that

S0086	you know he's an adult can't keep excuse his behaviour by say he's immature you know he's get to stand on his own two feet you know
S0041	that's it he can't i mean he can't keep do it it's only go to be worse or longer for him cos i'm go to get shit on he's never go to grow up just the next person that have to rely on him really
S0086	absolutely you have to worry about him start a relationship so soon after one end particularly a serious one because you don't have that period to reflect and look at yourself and look at how you be in a relationship you just lurch form one to the next to the next you never change you never grow
S0041	that's that's what he's kind of do

S0086	so be he come from work then
S0041	he's go straight from work to his house to get the box
S0086	in st ives then he's come here then he's go back to st ives

S0086	crazy boy
S0041	em that's not very much flour be it
S0086	i don't know maybe it's deceptive
S0041	okay okay let's just make it accord to the plan
S0086	let's just put that in the small one and then we can always make another batch
S0041	i'll put it in there any way cos i then i can whisk it
S0086	okay
S0041	i can fit my whisk in alright i'd imagine
S0086	ding
S0041	ding
S0086	mm bite of growth
S0041	i love growth
S0086	not as good as your growths obviously
S0041	i mean they be practice practice growths
S0086	yeah do you want to do do you want to grease the fry pan with butter or with oil
S0041	eh craig and i use sunflower oil last time wherever that be we can just use contraband sunflower oil
S0086	but there's people in the house today
S0041	it will not stick ooh it's 's anyway
S0086	ah fine
S0041	yeah but it didn't stick so i think
S0086	ah
S0041	it's pretty pretty safe
S0086	you're a genius oh hang on i don't know if it be 's if it's this one this be definitely
S0041	no that's olive oil i'm sure it wasn't 's

S0086	top right this one
S0041	yeah ah no front right
S0086	front right this okay mm
S0041	cool doritos go down a treat i wonder what the be suppose to be
S0086	em cool you ninny doyle
S0041	do you think we might need to double this
S0086	eh yeah it's not very much be it although you have load leave after you make some didn't you do you think that it's just how much do you use last time a ladle yeah so we will need to make more
S0041	yeah maybe we'll double the recipe maybe we won't put more milk in we'll just put water in instead cos otherwise we've get no milk
S0086	oh no
S0041	just mix it in there and then pour it together
S0086	yeah
S0041	i think it'll be fine with water
S0086	yeah probs seem highly likely when do the egg go in then
S0041	after the flour
S0086	have you just make that up
S0041	no make a well in the flour
S0086	make a well in the flour
S0041	for the yolk to sit in
S0086	ah and then then you spoon then you do the whisk
S0041	then the whisk all the whisk
S0086	mm good job you're here doyle what be wrong with your computer
S0041	doesn't your computer have a name
S0086	no oh it should we didn't sift our flour never mind
