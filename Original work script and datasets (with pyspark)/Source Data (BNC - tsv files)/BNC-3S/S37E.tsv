S0440	yeah
S0439	oh god it have actually hasn't it what be they do with this
S0481	oh
S0440	nothing
S0439	cos that really why can't they do anything cos no one want to buy it or the
S0481	well no i i i cycle round now and because you're go slower you realise how many empty build there be
S0439	yeah
S0440	that's
S0481	there's no shortage of house there be a shortage of i mean turn them into house that's the problem
S0439	yeah cos they've turn the there be a pub in into a house now haven't they
S0481	they well a a number of house have be
S0440	yeah
S0439	yeah
S0440	the the pub be one house and then they've put four three house in the in the garden
S0481	but they're not build little ones be they
S0439	no
S0481	you get the feel that will benefit from have from you know a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand doesn't need any house do it
S0440	well that's what those little ones be those little ones be already two bedroom job yeah
S0439	but that's the thing like affordable house like in obviously be not the the the place for affordable house but it's just a joke to charge the amount they charge for house
S0440	cos the the the thing be you now with plan don't you if you want to do something like that pub you have to put affordable house in there as well
S0439	i don't i don't know there's erm
S0440	so
S0439	oh
S0440	yeah sorry
S0439	be a girl in my office she's twenty six and she's have a boyfriend for ten years and they're well they're move into a house together they're do the buy to let with the government
S0440	mm
S0439	er they're more the the house itself be three hundred and fifty thousand i think their deposit be thirty thousand and the government
S0440	mm
S0439	chip in something like a fifth or something
S0440	mm
S0439	but erm and she be say she say it's a bite like the sims which be a computer game where you build house and control people
S0440	mm
S0439	like you once you've buy the house you then go online and you buy like extras to go in it like you can buy wardrobes or close like you know like the slow close toilet doors
S0440	yeah
S0439	and mirror and stuff like that but the thing be she's like i can go on there and spend she hasn't spend it but hypothetically she can go on there and spend thousands of extra pound
S0440	uhu
S0439	with just a click of a button which i think be really dangerous especially
S0440	but how much
S0439	as you can't see
S0440	be their mortgage a month then
S0439	don't know like especially as you can't see the actual quality of the stuff you're buy i think that's really bad it's good for people who don't care about the quality of the stuff in their house but for people who do it's not very good i don't like it they don't i don't know how much her mortgage be gonna be per month
S0481	but people now people just have more stuff
S0439	yeah definitely
S0481	you have you have box whereas there be about the time when people have a garage now people have garage and they don't use them they've get too much stuff so
S0440	and they never use their garage ever why they didn't turn it into another room i don't know
S0481	well yeah and could still get their car in if they tidy it a bite
S0439	it's true
S0481	so could be turn into a tesco's without anybody object
S0439	oh really
S0481	yeah cos it's er it's not a change of use it's a retail outlet
S0439	oh so be that what they're gonna do do you think change of the
S0440	yeah
S0481	well i just make that up i mean
S0439	but why don't you buy it dad
S0481	with what
S0439	i dunno
S0481	i should think
S0439	oh
S0481	exactly oh
S0440	you'd have to strip it right back and have to
S0439	the only pubs i go into dad be nice country pubs
S0481	yeah
S0440	that one we go in at i mean that hotel we stay at when when
S0481	oh
S0440	we go down in the morning and er the reek in the
S0481	of stale beer
S0440	it be ghastly
S0481	thank well it wasn't thankfully but you know the smoke
S0440	no but it be it be terrible
S0481	yeah
S0440	and you be sit there eat your breakfast think
S0481	yeah you've only ever be in the but it be well it be that part of it and 's mat be in the er
S0439	oh yeah
S0481	and i've never be you know i probably have it in my youth but it be go back to that the
S0439	but you've be in the pub with grandad sometimes to watch football haven't you
S0481	when
S0439	do you not go to the or the or

S0439	no
S0481	never be in the
S0439	i've never be
S0440	i've

S0440	i've i've be in the
S0481	i have be in the but only on day twenty years ago

S0439	dad your alcoholic ways
S0481	that's why they're
S0439	just haven't support the the local community
S0481	no i'd do what everybody would do and bring the booze home
S0439	mm
S0481	people cannot people cannot or won't the smoke ban be one of the biggest problems though
S0439	yeah yeah
S0481	the pubs be ban it cos it be then you would think that some people you know
S0439	and people like to smoke when they have a drink
S0481	when they have a drink but the problem be that when they don't smoke they drink
S0439	so they
S0481	it doesn't
S0439	drink at home
S0481	it's no well they they they would go for an extra pint because the the there's they're do something while they're smoke or

S0439	that's why i be
S0481	even take the or er even take the across to the canal on the other side
S0439	mm
S0481	people be take the so people be sit over there with the picnic area
S0439	yeah what's the one it's on the way if you go the back way to

S0439	same as like the though isn't it
S0481	well actually you don't have to drive up you can swim
S0439	or cycle
S0481	or yeah you could in actual actually swim down there
S0439	be it actually illegal to cycle drink
S0481	i i think there be so many laws in the country now you could be probably illegal to do absolutely anything i mean when be the last time anybody get prosecute for a sling a fag end out of a car that doesn't happen millions of time a day
S0439	i saw an article in the news about erm a way to reduce the amount of cigarettes people throw on the floor they have a cigarette bin and erm it's get a question i think it be who do you think be the better footballer and they have ronaldo and messi and then you put the fag in the option you think
S0481	oh right
S0439	be the better footballer to motivate people to not drop their fag on the floor i think that be quite clever actually but erm yeah
S0481	you look at paris they just flick their fag straight in the
S0439	oh to be fair
S0440	but no you have if someone come around at five o'clock in the morning and sweep
S0439	yeah
S0440	them all up
S0439	i be gonna say normally
S0481	no they don't sweep it up they wash it
S0440	alright they wash it down
S0439	normally paris be grim but when
S0439	we go the other weekend actually i think it be really clean
S0440	it be really clean yeah
S0439	and i dunno what they i dunno what's happen maybe the french have suddenly realise how to
S0440	no they've just employ
S0439	clean up something
S0440	they've just employ a lot more people in the middle of the night
S0439	yeah
S0440	i be surprise when i hear something outside i look out of the window and there be everybody
S0439	yeah
S0481	the waste just push
S0440	yeah they be just
S0481	fag end down
S0440	clean them all
S0481	down the sewers
S0440	clean the streets
S0481	and
S0439	but they do that in barcelona as well the the the dustbin men and the cleaners be come round all the time
S0481	yeah
S0439	there be no there be never garbage outside
S0481	no
S0440	no
S0481	in stockholm well they didn't need the
S0439	be it just immaculate in stockholm
S0440	it be yeah
S0481	it be really
S0439	well i'll have to add stockholm to my list of place to go
S0481	no i don't think you have to go that far though
S0439	oh okay
S0440	copenhagen's nice that be
S0439	i still think budapest be on i still want to go to budapest
S0440	yeah mind you at the moment you wouldn't
S0439	why what's wrong with budapest at the moment
S0440	it's full of millions of migrants
S0481	it's where of these
S0439	oh yeah fair enough yeah yeah
S0481	there be a last night in barcelona do you see that
S0439	a war
S0481	one and a half one and a half million demand independence from catalonia
S0439	what so they don't want to be part of catalonia but what do they want to be part of
S0481	part part of spain
S0440	which be why i don't understand why we be take kid to barcelona who be do spanish
S0439	no but i always think that barcelona be part of spain
S0440	it be
S0481	it be but they don't want to be part of it
S0440	they want they want to be they want
S0481	like the basques
S0440	yeah
S0439	oh they want to be part of catalonia
S0481	well they they the they haven't get a they haven't get a or anything
S0440	no
S0481	it's all political
S0440	they've get but they speak their own language there and all sort
S0439	yeah the but some of them speak spanish but yeah i know what you mean
S0440	yeah so why we're take kid to barcelona i've get no idea
S0439	but i don't understand why they're do it like why do these stupid little niche people think that become independent be gonna do anything
S0481	because the governments or the the political class have become remote they're not represent you anymore they be autocratic arrogant and they don't seem to be able to change things at the speed that local people want them but it's not easy for local politicians and if you then suddenly say hey we have to have our own energy supply therefore you be go to have a nuclear power station next to your house mr whatever whether you like it or not someone's gotta make those decisions
S0439	yeah
S0481	at the moment it's easier to blame the westminster government or somebody else like
S0439	yeah
S0481	sturgeon and the scots keep do it's a bite harder when it come home to roost and you've gotta make the decision
S0439	i just think be a politician must be so hard because you would you be never gonna please sixty million people
S0481	well that's
S0439	and it's just and but people don't seem to understand that it really annoy me that people just want what they want and don't really look at the big picture
S0481	yeah they're very short termism and if they've
S0439	yeah
S0481	they have to get elect that's why company owners often take longer term view and have come up with better solutions cos they've get wider options they can go to different countries
S0439	yeah
S0481	they can so if they're not make enough money in america they can say well why don't we build a factory in china and build and bring it in the they've get more flexibility than what a politician have
S0439	cos that's be the problem with obama hasn't it it's just he hasn't be in power long enough to make the constitutional change
S0481	i don't think obama come from a class that he have enough leverage
S0439	no
S0481	and with with the with the of class in other word there be so much er
S0439	well no not nepotism
S0481	well yeah nepotism bribery
S0439	yeah
S0481	corruption er only do things for your state i mean the people that hold up the the health er plan simply because they be try to screw some more out of obama for their state who frankly just they should have be shoot
S0439	yeah it's not for the wider picture be it it's for
S0481	no and
S0439	it's for them
S0481	and yet the mayor of lille be hold up as be great because he insist that if you're gonna go through his region he want a station
S0439	yeah but that make a point though
S0481	and it's revolutionise lille
S0439	yeah but that's a good idea though isn't it
S0481	well i dunno i i suppose to other people it it cost twenty million to put a station lille that slow their trip down by i dunno twenty minutes i've no idea but i'm just say that he take a very localise view and it's revolutionise his city so all you can do be he's not elect to run france he's just elect to
S0439	represent his region
S0481	run lille yeah
S0439	yeah
S0481	and you could say the same about democratic even america because you be you be not elect by take the wider view you be just elect for take a very narrow view it's like
S0440	the last time i come back by eurostar we come back via lille
S0481	don't we always come back via lille
S0440	no no
S0481	oh right
S0440	no
S0481	cos lille be north of the erm
S0440	yeah but we come back via lille and we come back via ebbsfleet i'd never be to ebbsfleet either
S0439	but i don't see any problem with have a slightly longer journey to stop in place that actually people want to go to
S0440	well the lille be now be gonna to be big now because it's the it's the way you go when you wanna go to erm
S0481	brussels or those place
S0439	yeah so
S0440	brussels but also when you want to go to erm the south
S0481	it give people the yes
S0440	avignon
S0439	so i don't really see
S0440	you don't have to go to paris
S0439	such a problem with it it would be random if he run if he put a if someone be force a station in a little place that no one ever want to go to
S0481	no i agree but he he take a very
S0439	and it pay off yeah i know what you mean
S0481	yeah er whereas you get the other ones who think that you know the the politicians who stand up and say oh we've we've only get a bypass because i do this and i do that and whatever you know well it might be true or it might not but the the the big gap between you get a decision and the bypass be build in britain could be ten bloody years wouldn't it
S0439	be they
S0440	i get an we get an email from eurostar yesterday do you read it
S0439	erm talk about email why do a viking longboat company have my email address with your name
S0481	it's not a viking
S0439	what be it
S0481	it's just a cruise company call viking
S0439	well why why do i have it
S0440	i don't but it's because you're on a you're on a thing of they've get a demographic that old people live at
S0439	no but you must have sign up to something
S0440	no i haven't sign up to anything they've sell my name on to to viking from something else

S0439	no no but it's only like three pound mum
S0440	oh
S0481	they erm there's be a lot of trouble about people at station not be give the best price but this come to like we just expect people to research the best one there be and you think why i dunno i mean it's like with our price list our price list aren't price list at all they're all up for negotiation with farmers
S0439	yeah all of our typesetter price be up for negotiation
S0481	yeah so this idea but you know you it's in a market where the public cannot be expect to know
S0439	yeah
