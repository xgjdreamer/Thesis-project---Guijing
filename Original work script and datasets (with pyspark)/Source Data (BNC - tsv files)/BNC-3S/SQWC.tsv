S0041	what a
S0084	yeah it be pretty pretty nice
S0041	er
S0084	but it's all a bite more bearable
S0041	how do that come about then do he come around
S0084	um we be talk last night and he be he'd have some sort of drama obviously cos his middle name's drama
S0041	obviously cos his name's

S0084	we'll have to call him um have some drama with his sister and his kid or some such whatever and he be texting me last night tell me he be really piss and he doesn't really drink now and so i realize something quite serious be up and i cos we be just sort of try to calm him down um he say what be you do tomorrow i say free during the day cos i be suppose to go and see hannah but but of course cancel again third time be the charm might see her next week
S0084	um do i wanna come over for lunch so i think i'll just i do wanna see him cos i wanna clear the air and i wanna make sure everything's alright and then i'll you know i've be sort of calm about the whole thing he say yeah sound brilliant and then this morning i be sort of laze around in bed think i probably should get up at some point at half eleven think oh he'll probably just cancel cos er or he'll forget
S0041	yeah
S0084	um but he texted in the morning say what time's lunch so probably should get up now
S0084	like quarter to twelve probably should wash myself so he come over i didn't cook lunch couldn't be bother oh well my plan be to make soup and he could've have which i have now do and he could've have soup but it be really hot like it be too hot to make soup even in the house so that's when we go out to the pub and er it be fine actually it be really nice i have a little talk eventually um and i just say look can we not make this into too much of a drama can we just you know do you wanna do you wanna just see what happen or you know cos he obviously send me that message say oh i i think we should stop see each other

S0084	and see me
S0041	yeah
S0041	negate say message
S0084	so yeah hmm and from what he tell me i don't think he's get anybody else in his life who he's could particularly talk to about stuff so even if it's just that you're a bite of a saddo because that's what annoy me it's that it's not just a a shag
S0041	yeah
S0084	situation
S0041	yeah
S0084	there be more to it which be i think be where that's gonna get confuse that line be already a bite blur
S0041	yeah
S0084	um but then at the same time it's quite nice to have a bite of chat and a bite of banter and know that you get on you know that it's not just
S0041	yeah
S0084	a a shag thing but we've both agree that for me he's mental like as much fun as he be he's not
S0041	have you tell him he's mental
S0084	boyfriend material yeah
S0041	right mhm
S0084	well not quite as callously as that i do just say

S0041	ah that's good
S0084	i think if it get to a point where it's too much for either of us we'll just have to walk away
S0041	yeah
S0084	for now we have er quite a giggle
S0041	that sound like a good plan to me

S0041	then really that just show you and i just think
S0084	fuck
S0041	i say to yesterday
S0084	mm
S0041	i say it it's just a stark example of the person that he's turn into
S0084	mm mm
S0041	cos the that i meet three years ago would he would've do that for anybody never mind his ex girlfriend you know
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	the fact that that he's get information like that and doesn't see it as be important
S0084	cos er that's er
S0041	it's just
S0084	it's it's anybody it happen to anybody you
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	know yet alone anybody you're suppose to care about
S0041	yeah it's just shock
S0084	you'd be holy shit
S0041	you know what he's think be oh that's bad but i've get gemma here so i'm gonna be selfish
S0084	yeah
S0041	that's exactly what he's think
S0084	well i can't come and see you because obviously for the next forty eight hours i can't leave her side
S0041	yeah whereas if i imagine i i think of it the other way imagine if it be one of the weekend like you age ago when matt come
S0084	mm mm
S0041	if i'd have hear that i would've
S0084	mm
S0041	say to him
S0041	look i'm gonna have to do this
S0084	mm
S0041	do you wanna
S0084	oh er clearly
S0041	do you wanna put a film on or something i'll be back in an hour and a half
S0084	yeah
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	or do you mind if i just make a phone call like even if it be just a phone call like he wouldn't go
S0084	mm
S0041	to call me actually talk me and say how be you do what hurt and
S0084	mm
S0041	be you sure you're okay not even a phone call
S0084	nothing
S0041	no
S0084	weird
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's very strange
S0041	say that she think he doesn't really know what he want she say he must he must feel like if he talk to you or do anything with you that he's be disloyal to her i mean if he's spend three hours a night on the phone to her he's basically build his life around her now
S0041	and mental as that may be for someone that you don't really know
S0084	no
S0041	very much
S0041	she say if i be you i'd just write him out write him off
S0084	this be what i keep say
S0041	mm he need just write off
S0084	i just think
S0084	every every time
S0084	everyday he just
S0084	make the situation worse do you know what i mean every time
S0041	yeah
S0084	that he let you down
S0084	it's a blow
S0041	yeah
S0084	and there's only so much that you can cope with
S0084	like you're already like if you feel shit like this weekend you feel shit you don't wanna be remind
S0084	that he's act like a tool at the same time
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	but it's easier it's i do appreciate it's easier say than do
S0084	but
S0041	i say to as well like this be the first time i've be
S0041	hurt since i've be apart from him
S0084	mm
S0041	like and seriously and i come home and i i say to on friday i come home i be more upset that i be on my own
S0084	mm
S0041	and that he wasn't there to look after me
S0041	or run a bath or
S0084	mm
S0041	just tell me it's gonna be alright you know
S0084	well it's not until like something like that happen that you realize how like
S0084	how different he be now with you
S0041	yeah and i and i just think do you know what if that's the type of person that he be now i don't want him i don't
S0041	want to be around him
S0084	well no no because he's massively selfish now
S0041	yeah
S0084	isn't he
S0041	really selfish
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean i always know he be selfish
S0041	and i use to tell his mum he be selfish but i never think he would go to this extent
S0084	mm
S0041	i never think he would never
S0084	i mean you be say that you know with his other friends he's be cut them out when he be cut them out when you be with him but surely if one of them have a problem it would've be a completely different story he would've call them or he would've try to see them
S0084	check that they're okay
S0041	no
S0084	really
S0041	that's it what i think what
S0041	he be try to say to me when we be in be that basically his friends don't come to him
S0041	because of how crap he be at life and he cut them out and doesn't really talk to them
S0084	they don't even bother to
S0084	when they've get a problem
S0041	yeah they don't go to him
S0084	you'd be gutted wouldn't you
S0084	like if you like with
S0041	mm
S0084	she doesn't talk about her problem
S0084	because she think it's really bore so
S0084	i didn't even realize that she'd split up with this person she's be see for a little while and she didn't tell anybody she only tell her housemate because obviously they'll see her every day
S0084	she didn't call me and you sort of er you take it really personally
S0084	because you think
S0041	yeah
S0084	oh my god you feel like you can't come and talk to me
S0084	and it's it's not alright it's because she can't she doesn't want to burden people with her problems
S0084	even someone like me and we're really close but if i think that actually she couldn't come and talk to me
S0084	so devastate cos you wanna be a good friend
S0041	
S0046	mm
S0041	can you close the door to please thank dear
S0041	it's make me feel a bite sick
S0084	yeah yeah it's make the house smell hmm
S0084	it's hard like why would you not er er it's like we say before
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know if he's get if you feel like you're a bad friend do something about it
S0041	that's he be say when we be in london he get upset he say you know my friends can't rely on me they don't come to me but
S0084	er
S0041	actual by actual fact he shouldn't have bother say that cos he didn't want to do anything about it he didn't
S0084	yes yeah
S0041	care for sure
S0084	like it's not he's just it's almost sort of like he's point out that that's the problem but he's there's no culpability there there's no
S0041	yeah
S0084	accept that it's his that's his fault
S0041	yeah
S0084	er or plan to do anything about it
S0041	i think yeah i mean i just realize it's he realize it's his fault he doesn't take it take the responsibility for it
S0084	mm no mm
S0041	i mean er to be honest i don't really want him to come round cos it's just gonna anger me
S0084	mm
S0041	cos i know what's gonna happen he's gonna come round to here and i'm gonna say well it's good i didn't die a few days ago
S0084	i don't think see him be a good idea i don't think be in contact with him be a good idea let alone him actually come to the house cos the last time you saw him face to face be london be it
S0041	yeah
S0084	and the last time before that you saw him face to face when be that um my point be do you be you argue every time you're see each other i think
S0041	no
S0084	no be you sure
S0041	no
S0084	cos seem like every time you see him there's some sort of he let you down or there's a problem or you know and that's a good enough reason not to see him
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos there be the comedy club be that the last time you saw him face to face
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	and that be a bite of a problem
S0041	yeah it be yeah you're right
S0084	do you want anything
S0041	no thank you
S0084	tea no
S0041	just a guilty pleasure ain't it it's just it's stupid cos um i want to see him
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i know i don't actually want to see him
S0084	oh well no absolutely um and cut someone like him out of your life be always gonna be hard because he's you know if not the one the most important then one of the most important people in your life
S0041	yeah
S0084	but you've gotta think of it as self preservation you know it it's not do you any good and actually probably not do him any good either you know so see how you feel tomorrow
S0041	i'm gonna text him and say do you know what don't bother don't bother come round tomorrow i need you sunday sunday er friday saturday sunday
S0084	mm
S0041	not monday four days later
S0084	mm absolutely
S0084	yeah
S0046	mm
S0084	because it doesn't this boy
S0041	no
S0084	you know he's not do anything to put any effort in no one if you don't work at a friendship
S0084	i have this with a friend of mine at uni he his point be you shouldn't have to work at a friendship it should just be natural and if if it's not natural then it's there's nothing there
S0041	no
S0084	and i'm like that's the most retard thing i've
S0041	yeah
S0084	ever hear in my life he can just fuck off cos true
S0046	yeah
S0084	i don't think that's true at all
S0041	no
S0084	it take constant all relationships take work and effort on
S0041	yeah
S0084	both part
S0041	well it's a friendship girl and boyfriend be a friendship
S0084	yeah
S0084	exactly
S0084	exactly so um
S0084	bollocks
S0041	course it do cos it that's how that's how you lose friends cos one person stop put in the effort
S0084	yeah
S0041	that's what happen
S0084	absolutely
S0084	speak of i'm start to feel quite guilty for not go out last night with for 's thing like she hasn't
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	she didn't reply when i send her a message last night say that the cramp be really bad which they be and i be gonna try and override them but i be feel pretty ropey the idea of go out really late and not know where we be gonna be i just didn't fancy it send her a message and she hasn't reply i think she feel a bite
S0084	oh you could've let me know sooner
S0041	mm
S0084	i think well
S0041	i don't know i'd be a bite selfish on this one and say you know if it be that important to you you would've be able to tell me where to go and what time
S0084	yeah
S0041	seriously
S0084	i mean i have to chase her for the plan
S0084	and i think
S0084	if there'd be a well this be what we're do not like military precision but you know
S0041	no
S0084	this be what i want to do
S0084	it would've be different
S0041	yeah i think i
S0084	but i still do feel a bite guilty
S0041	i'd be sit on selfish street for this one
S0084	yeah
S0084	i mean no one want to think of themselves as a bad friend but it doesn't seem to bother
S0041	no it really doesn't
S0041	it really doesn't
S0046	one two three
S0041	the more i think about it
S0041	you're right the more i think about it i really don't wanna see him tomorrow
S0084	well the thing be er if you wake up tomorrow morning and think oh do you know what i probably do wanna see him don't get yourself up about it
S0041	like just see his face be gonna anger me
S0084	yep
S0041	he's gonna make my blood boil
S0084	it's gonna end in a in a argument
S0041	yeah
S0084	at this point
S0084	how much more can your heart take er cos the constant blow every time it let you down
S0041	yeah i need to get myself into a place where i don't i don't think of him i don't think to rely on him cos he's never gonna be there never
S0084	well doesn't seem like it he's not prove himself to you at all be he
S0041	no
S0084	so no i would say he's not gonna be one
S0041	huh
S0084	at least er but the more that you recognize it the more that you see it
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's gonna get easier do you know what i mean cos you're gonna keep put a bite of distance between the two of you each time
S0041	yeah yeah i think i'll text him tomorrow just say do you know what don't bother come round later i need you friday saturday and sunday
S0084	yeah
S0041	i don't need you four days later it's too little too late
S0084	well
S0046	i think
S0041	which be true
S0084	i mean it's totally up to you
S0046	it's one of the same ain't it
S0084	i mean you can either you know say that as a way of make a point
S0046	yeah
S0084	or just say look
S0084	just don't come round i've you know be come round or something like someone you can actually rely on
S0041	mm
S0084	cos obviously if you start down that road he's gonna come back with something
S0084	and that's gonna open communication channel
S0084	so it's whether you wanna sort of engage in that
S0046	yeah
S0041	i think if he reply after that i just wouldn't reply i just don't
S0046	message thing that i use call what's up
S0041	i know what's gonna happen
S0041	either he come here and i'm gonna lay into him or
S0046	it's so much easier to use than my text message my text message slow
S0041	i'm gonna want to lay into him if i don't say that to him
S0084	yeah it's like gonna build
S0041	he's not yeah he's just he's he's not take it on board he will never
S0084	mm
S0041	come to that conclusion himself
S0084	yeah
S0041	and really i think we both know it's not gonna make any difference whether he receive that message or not
S0041	to him
S0084	yeah
S0041	but it'll make me feel a bite better that i've have a little dig
S0084	yeah
S0084	well then
S0084	there you go
S0046	really
S0084	sound like a good idea
S0084	cos it's it's so hard when you rely on a person like that and they let you down every time
S0046	well
S0046	yeah
S0046	well most of that
S0084	huh
S0084	my tummy hurt man
S0041	urgh death
S0084	how be you feel
S0041	just shakey
S0084	shakey

S0041	that's a man isn't it
S0084	so yeah so we clap be that gabriel no he's too fat
S0041	get a very strong accent the um so the other guy that just come in that be ask for work as an actor be that the hot guy
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah think so
S0084	that's the hot guy

S0041	he say cunt
S0084	do he
S0041	yeah
S0084	maybe they can't put that huh derrière
S0041	i think he he basically say clap you cunts
S0084	mm
S0041	that's
S0084	right that's him that's him as a woman
S0041	oh
S0084	nice sideburns
S0084	wow isn't it so funny when you see some men who lend themselves quite well to look like a woman
S0041	yeah don't you just think though
S0084	cheekbones
S0041	if you're an actor like wouldn't it be bad if you be employ to be like a transsexual or a transvestite cos that's what you look like as a girl you're employ
S0084	possibly
S0041	because you look like a man you'd be a bite gutted
S0084	yeah i think that about all the people who be employ as like unfortunate souls you know like the fat ones
S0084	the ugly ones things that you just can't help i feel so sorry for those people
S0041	yeah
S0084	who when they're employ they're employ because they're like like heather trott from eastenders
S0041	yes yes
S0084	she's employ because she's ugly
S0041	yeah and i also think as well actually good on these people cos usually if you're ugly people say you can't be an actor
S0084	yeah
S0041	they've persevere through er
S0084	yep
S0041	and get through because of their look but because they be bad
S0084	because they're rank
S0041	you be rank
S0084	well i suppose that you know not everyone can be beautiful they're probably very good at weld or something
S0084	maybe they're gonna solve world the hunger the the
S0041	the hunger the hunger
S0084	they could solve all the hunger
S0041	yes
S0084	all of the war
S0041	er
S0084	i don't really know what's go on oh er he's
S0041	he just walk up to him outside
S0084	he's touch him up for some reason mm
S0041	do they both know that one's a man
S0084	well the well the the man who's a woman know he's a man
S0041	well he he must know i suppose
S0084	and presumably that be definitely er a drag night the noise he's get really skinny legs oh you'd just walk out at that point if er if he just pass out
S0041	yep
S0084	you'd be mortify this be what i mean about prostitution i really think it might be the way forward get a car
S0041	yeah
S0084	get some money ah why would you wanna do it for no reason
S0041	i have no idea i really have no idea
S0084	surely no most women don't really you know get much
S0041	enjoy do that
S0084	er you know you don't get
S0041	yeah
S0084	any pleasure from it really apart from to see their pleasure i suppose and if he's pass out weird maybe it's different if you're a bloke though
S0041	er no i can't believe it
S0084	i'd quite like an authentic blonde wig cos so sometimes i could be blonde
S0041	yeah

S0041	yeah
S0084	have you be sick today oh you be sick this morning weren't you

S0084	really
S0041	yeah it be really bad
S0084	oh huh
S0041	and the worst part be towards the end of it the last few time i wake up before i be sick i wasn't actually sick i just felt like i be gonna be sick so bad
S0084	yeah
S0041	i wake up sit up and burp a few time with bucket on knee and then nothing would come up and i'd just
S0084	mm
S0041	go to sleep again
S0084	oh
S0041	it be strong enough to wake you up and think oh god it's gonna it's come now uh
S0084	shit
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's so weird though isn't it because there's nothing to come up
S0041	yeah i think that might be the only reason why i wasn't sick cos there wasn't anything leave
S0084	cos there's nothing there god almighty
S0041	now i'm concern that i've eat the burger that could come up
S0084	i think it would've do by now though would it be a good few hours
S0041	yeah maybe yeah
S0084	hopefully oh well i hope it's not catch because there aren't enough bathrooms
