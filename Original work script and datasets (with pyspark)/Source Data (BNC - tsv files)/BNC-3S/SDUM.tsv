S0520	the thing about our lovely be that he's one of the most space out people i've ever meet in my life
S0519	mm
S0520	and as a consequence he be i mean it's a little bite frustrate sometimes
S0519	mm
S0520	so for instance i will send him a design like a photoshop document you know with all the design on it or i'll send him a text that need to go on the website
S0519	yeah
S0520	you know and i'll write him an email and it's all like it's get a title say attachment for blah blah blah
S0519	yeah
S0520	design for you know so you can spot it in our inbox
S0519	i love it
S0520	do the same
S0519	no subject
S0520	no subject be 's classic style so that you really don't know what you're do i'll do that
S0519	they're just er
S0520	basically what you need to with this
S0519	yes
S0520	i give him you know step by step instructions about it
S0519	mm
S0520	i would say and i'm not exaggerate nine time out of ten he ask me to send it to him again after have be completely confuse he'll be like erm you know several weeks later when it actually be get do he'll be like oh and erm i'll need the design for and i'll say yes i send that to you in a on
S0519	yeah yes on such and such a date
S0520	on such and such a date oh i don't think no it's in my inbox yes it be in your inbox cos i send it to you and i know that i do
S0519	it's send and all that stuff yes
S0520	and that's problem number one and it do irritate me
S0519	ah
S0520	because i want to be do the thing where it's like i've do that it's behind me
S0519	i know
S0520	i've cross it off my list i've do it i've move on
S0519	i know what i don't like
S0520	and he be never almost never on the ball and he say this to us erm kind of as a not as a way he's not apologetic at all he say i can't do things unless i'm actually work on on it at the time it's basically not worth your while
S0519	so sorry don't bother send it to me i'll ask you when i need it
S0520	but you know really
S0519	i'm not very good with with that in one way in that they send me information in three weeks' time you will need to pay these people they don't know exactly how much yes yet but this be the invoice guess on how many days and hours we might and i think well i don't need the guess information
S0520	yeah
S0519	i need the real invoice
S0520	yeah don't send me the maybe
S0519	don't send me the maybe and then it turn out that they so i file the maybe just you know in case but i'm hop i never have to retrieve it erm and erm only they decide then could you tell me again what that amount be cos i've forget how much we and i'm think oh god so i have to trawl through
S0520	i know yeah no
S0519	the thing that i didn't want to see in the first place please
S0520	well this be the this be problem number one and er and we just adore this person so we don't the other problem with him be in fairness he can't be he's not very good with critical criticism
S0519	he's not
S0520	not even criticism but like if you will say to him listen dear erm this be really annoy what i send you which i have do by the way when i send you an email with an attachment put it in a folder even if you don't do anything with the email
S0519	it's get a name
S0520	and then you'll know
S0519	yeah
S0520	that you've get the file that you need when it come to the thing but he get a bite upset yeah a bite defensive
S0519	mm i don't do that sort of thing
S0520	well not he know that he do it but he refuse to be apologetic and he refuse to try and change
S0519	mm
S0520	the way that he work and that's not as cool because we've all change the way that we work you know some some like all of us have our things like can be too bossy
S0519	mm
S0520	and erm full on with that side of things
S0519	yeah erm
S0520	and she offend people with her way
S0519	the greek people have go off her
S0520	the greek people didn't like her at all and it it wasn't the first time that's happen in fairness she be she can be just a little bite i think some people find it patronise
S0519	yes
S0520	that she sort of assume that you're work for her a little bite but she you tell her this and she's so
S0519	can't believe that it's yeah
S0520	take it in and be like really okay and i'm you know and she try so hard to change the way that she do it and
S0519	yes i have to say it remind me a bite of dad
S0520	she get a bite upset but yeah
S0519	he i'll hear him on the phone and he'll he'll laugh at people and i'll think i'm just in your eye
S0520	yeah
S0519	and they that they kind of get to know that he's a nice man and he doesn't mean it and he's laugh and it's not hurtful you know but he's actually extremely rude
S0520	offensive
S0519	and when they don't know him you can sometimes hear the bristle
S0520	ooh yeah definitely i've hear him on the phone as well and i've think ow
S0519	ow me too
S0520	he's just not realise that people be take things offence like be take offence on things
S0519	yes you do what
S0520	it's quite a skill to be sort of diplomatic with people isn't it so anyway erm have this problem and i think that's you know it's his achilles heel really because you're not gonna improve as a person to a degree if you can't if if you can't respond well to negative feedback and it's not negative come from me and
S0519	no
S0520	cos we're his like we're good friends of his and you know we really it's obvious that we have lot of respect for him by default it's you know it there's no there should be no issue there should be no question of that really so that just yeah so today he's be in top space out form so he's send all these email which be erm which be as a result of the fact that he's not read any of the email that we've send before and he's ask now he's ask the question as if we've never speak about it but we've send about a billion email on the subject to him personally and each other and he's obviously just not read any of them so we're back to square one with him you know and it's a little bite like and he's send them all to the wrong email address and stuff it's like so not on the case i mean you can't he's one of those people that he remind me a bite of do you remember you meet

S0521	mm
S0519	and parsley sauce
S0520	it'll give you like all your omega three in one go
S0519	so what do you say to that young man
S0521	mm
S0519	would you like to chop me a bite of parsley
S0521	could do
S0520	come on dad expand your culinary
S0521	i've be criticise for my chop skills
S0519	i'm hop you'll be able to recognise the difference
S0520	do you actually chop an onion and stuff for your cottage pie
S0521	oh you hear the story do you
S0520	no
S0519	i haven't tell her see i haven't dobbed you in
S0520	do you have to wear spectacles
S0521	i've be criticise for my onion chop
S0519	he leave the skin on
S0520	oh
S0519	and just sort of randomly poke into it from all directions and then try to fish the skin out
S0520	dad
S0521	mm
S0519	so there's we've have three shepherd's pies all all of which have be delicious but even at the second one he decide that peel the potatoes be a waste of time so he would put them in in their skin you know and just mush it up with the skin on
S0520	dad
S0521	it be delicious wasn't it
S0520	it depend on the potatoes but yeah it can be especially if you use new potatoes then there's a there's a special fancy word for it like crush crush potatoes or something
S0519	yeah but that's not what you put on top of your shepherd's pie be it
S0520	well you could
S0519	and then he didn't have any proper cheese
S0520	onion be pretty key to the whole process
S0519	and he didn't have any other cheese so he mush up the potatoes with their skin and then he decide to put feta
S0520	feta on the cottage pie dad
S0519	erm
S0520	and be it nice
S0519	it actually i have to take it all back cos i just go i say look
S0520	swallow your
S0519	follow the recipe for at least once
S0521	well when there's no other cheese in the house what be you suppose to do
S0519	just have it without cheese but actually it taste delicious so who can say
S0521	well there you go so what you talk about
S0519	mm
S0521	there seem to be one snag with your er your theory we only have we only get no white
S0519	i only buy red
S0520	she didn't buy white that's why we have to go to the pub to get it
S0521	deary me
S0520	well the the first step be make but unfortunately the second second step have prove a hurdle which be the actual not drink of wine
S0519	sorry
S0521	so i've spot a performance of marriage of figaro and of all
S0521	all the place
S0520	no
S0521	of all place it's in
S0521	yeah
S0520	sound good
S0521	so i'm think i should invite my mother
S0520	ah that'll be nice
S0519	okay my love you're on chop here you be take this just hang it up there okay
S0521	before i start erm be there a recognise technique to this chop
S0519	no as it happen my lovely it's actually pretty damn easy
S0520	finally dad finally
S0519	just keep go till it's a bite frothy
S0520	very nice dad
S0521	what
S0520	it's just very funny to see you with a with do anything culinary
S0521	what right
S0520	cool
S0519	we need the erm need the what do you me call it whisk
S0520	's be demand
S0519	what's he demand
S0520	he just do this thing where he'll ask me to do something on viber and then about a millisecond later he'll be like have you do yet
S0520	and then he'll make a joke out of it but actually he would like it to be do that quickly
S0519	he really would
S0520	if it be him we would we would we would not be draw breath
S0519	right that's grand you i i don't need it any smaller than that my love that's beautiful
S0520	be you use a fork
S0519	that be what you do with the onion you have a knife and fork at it that be what make me smile about it
S0520	that's really funny
S0520	no not at all it's just it's erm er it's unconventional
S0521	i think the word be creative and
S0520	if you like yeah
S0521	unconventional
S0520	ah mm it's not the er it's not the accept wisdom in term of chop to use a fork funnily enough cos you do use them to eat our dinner but it's more for the shovel to the mouth than the er chop
S0521	yes okay
S0520	you're suppose to do something really canny like put your finger like this if you have a sharp knife you hold the thing like that and then the knife go along this part of your finger instead of it then you don't chop the end of your finger off
S0521	oh that's always helpful always helpful not to chop your finger off
S0520	well yeah people do sometimes
S0519	okay i need three plat

S0520	yeah i know i know that tactic i'm also very good at it
S0519	tactic
S0520	you're suppose to do them first
S0519	yeah
S0520	that's the erm that's the advice i've have
S0519	receive wisdom
S0520	mm
S0519	job okay i think this fish be cook and everything be ready
S0520	we should put some flower in the room as well in the bedroom
S0519	the what pet
S0520	we should put some of those flower in the bedroom as well
S0519	oh definitely
S0520	to make it nice
S0519	we've get to do everything to make it beautiful for him so he feel properly look after right hob can go off ching would you erm the spinach through that

S0519	you've get half of it on the floor
S0519	oh dear
S0520	oh my
S0520	be that too much
S0519	that's fine there be go to be a bite of fish but you can just put it at the side of it
S0520	well we'll just do a nice green blob like that
S0519	yeah
S0520	like that
S0519	yeah so it's sore then when you come
S0520	ooh erm
S0519	very well off for the green bits
S0520	mm and the little it's suppose to be good for you
S0520	okay go to the pub it's a bite some eccentricity involve
S0519	okay do rather demolish the kitchen but other than that be have all be very successful
S0520	mm
S0519	there's a little more i might have give you too much potati
S0520	potati
S0519	tattys if it's too much i'll just
S0520	that's fine thank you
S0519	i've already take one off
S0520	oh that would be a bite of a pile
S0519	it's a little bite generous on the tatty front there's a little bite more parsley sauce if you would like
S0520	thank you expertly chop parsley in that as well
S0521	now there's no need for this sarcasm
S0521	you haven't taste my cottage pie
S0520	i know well i'm never go to probably unless i have a change of heart on the old veggie front
S0521	oh okay
S0520	make me a vegetarian version
S0521	oh oh
S0520	it be interest in that programme bronowski programme
S0521	bronowski
S0520	the first one he's do the show the evolution of man from the ape you know that be his that's what the first programme's about and erm it's sort of it's quite funny because it's quite old fashion like you know the way it all look and stuff
S0519	mm
S0520	he go on the computer and it's like this
S0521	that be state of the art then
S0520	it be state of the art then and the whole programme be probably really state of the art you know the way they do the montages with the music and it's all very now it's kind of you recognise it but i think then it be all very creative wasn't it anyway he he show on the computer the how the skulls
S0519	oh sorry
S0520	erm the different skulls that they've find at that time i don't know what it's like now if they've find a lot mine but er skulls of the different
S0521	yeah it be interest wasn't it
S0520	developments and one of the thing that he show be that the three be like branch away from human from ape that develop into other type of ape and there be a a branch that develop into humans you know so
S0521	mm
S0520	some of them be meat eaters and remain so and they develop different teeth and a different jaw and and their brain change and the main thing be the brain and the teeth which distinguish er development into human be from other
S0521	mm
S0519	mm mm
S0520	evolution of ape into other species of ape instead you know that be the interest thing that it be say
S0519	yeah
S0520	so their brain specifically be grow much much bigger and their diet be change i mean i think they they evolve from the i can't remember if this be true whether we evolve from cos they be be herbivores originally weren't they
S0521	yes they come down from the tree on to the savannah
S0520	yeah
S0521	and then they start to hunt and the hunt obviously mean that they be have animal meat
S0520	yeah and they be actually physically very small creatures and quite weak physically and that's why they have to develop
S0521	develop tool
S0520	tool in order to survive in the savannah environment
S0519	and be it to cut up the meat as well
S0520	erm i don't think so no
S0521	yeah
S0520	i think they cut the meat up do they didn't they just eat it directly
S0521	no i think they cut it up
S0520	do they mm
S0519	well
S0520	they have like very very simple tool
S0519	mm
S0520	and the other thing that be interest because of their physical size be that they have to hunt together
S0519	mm
S0520	so you know then you have like a social species as oppose to like cat for instance who be like more of individual species because they hunt alone
S0519	yeah
S0520	but we're like dog because we hunt together
S0519	yeah
S0520	and then there's the sort of group the social behaviour start you can see that even in the monkey like if you watch the monkey i watch them sometimes in india in the retreat place cos there's load of them how they behave with each other they're completely social animals you never see monkey on its own do it's one thing you know
S0519	mm mm
S0521	right
S0519	no
S0520	and erm like dog be like that as well and therefore they develop kind of an emotional like the difference between cat and dog dog be not be emotionally needy
S0521	mm
S0520	and they need like affection and communication in order to feel happy whereas cat
S0519	a little but not much
S0520	a little bite but not much
S0521	oh
S0519	a little but not yeah like jay come and sit on you
S0521	jay yeah
S0520	but they be very domesticate pet cat aren't they
S0519	mm
S0521	mm
S0520	and they've develop the certain different habit but in the end
S0519	no a cat
S0520	mostly alone
S0519	mm
S0521	i think they also they also think that the switch to meat er be part of the thing that enable the brain to get bigger
S0520	yeah they say that as well
S0521	because the meat be much richer in protein obviously
S0520	different food yeah and then this be in africa the originate then they migrate very long distance
S0521	cos of climate change
S0520	why do he say that be
S0521	cos of the climate change
S0520	cos of the climate change and then there be an ice age there be two ice age and there be small group of humans homo sapiens let's say that survive the ice age
S0521	mm
S0520	but in order to do so they have to develop quite sophisticate techniques because they weren't build survive that kind of temperature so they start to live in cave
S0519	mm
S0520	and they start to migrate with the animals so like for instance they'd follow a herd of reindeer on their natural migration because the reindeer be their source of food
S0519	mm
S0520	so they just follow it
S0519	mm
S0520	and that's how kind of more of a nomadic lifestyle start to develop
S0521	mm
S0519	and also that the animals probably have the instinct of where to go that it be warmer or for protection from the winter and all that
S0520	yeah it's altogether a good idea isn't it to follow them but they didn't i mean humans don't have a natural migratory instinct
S0519	no
S0520	they're not migrate they're not a migrate species
S0519	no
S0520	they're just try to survive er they what he's say be that they start to consciously develop erm strategies of survival that weren't just inherent they weren't like you know a salmon swim up the river it doesn't decide to that's its
S0519	no i see what you mean
S0520	preprogrammed
S0521	instinctive
S0519	so there be a a definite choice
S0521	adaptive yeah so there's a certain kind of there's an element of conscious decision involve you know that that in in how they decide to and that's obviously a huge difference between
S0519	i'm sorry my love i have eat my whole dinner
S0520	you have
S0521	be you hungry
S0520	you be ready for the pub already
S0519	i be starve hungry
S0520	i be hungry
S0519	and you've nicely sit and chat
S0519	i'm just eat my dinner
S0520	i actually eat quite slowly i notice that
S0519	mm
S0521	yeah that be an interest thing wasn't it cos he follow erm he go to have a look at some tribes today
S0520	yeah
S0521	which be on be it afghanistan no
S0520	iran it be
S0521	be it oh yes
S0520	b bahiti i'm not go to remember
S0521	and the the tribe be entirely dependent on cattle or whatever the animal be some form of cattle
S0520	sheep wasn't it
S0521	be it
S0520	no goats
S0521	goats yeah
S0520	yeah
S0521	erm his comment be that the fact that they spend all their time chase goats that be their entire life and they have no time or energy leave for anything other than survival
S0520	he be try to prove wasn't he that the follow step be to settle in erm stable communities develop agriculture
S0519	develop a way of live without follow
S0520	yeah exactly because nomadic life be so
S0519	mm
S0520	erm all the aspect of survival be so all consume they have no leisure time they have no time to create anything and their whole lifestyle be base on what they'd do before what have be do and prove to work before they go on the same migration rout they make things in the same way they didn't need at any point to develop anything new and they didn't have time to so so yeah these people will stay the same and the idea be that we don't kind of thing it be kind of his theory wasn't it more than the facts
S0521	a little bite yeah
S0520	but
S0521	he do say it be his personal view didn't he
S0520	the whole thing be his personal view and
S0519	yeah what's amaze when you look back and something like that be that probably he's very close to what people still believe and but he be it be quite extraordinary for somebody to have
S0520	very influential yeah
S0519	that theory then
S0521	yeah
S0520	well it be a really interest programme and erm
S0519	i love think that in the seventies with that you know ludicrous computers and all of these things that they send a man to the moon
S0521	yeah
S0520	that's true
S0521	in the sixties actually
S0519	it it yeah it's hardly people didn't have a computer then do they
S0521	no
S0519	erm at home
S0521	just a research thing
S0519	erm and they send a man to the moon
S0520	yeah that's true it's amaze
S0519	it's extraordinary isn't it so sorry yes i know that's a diversion
S0520	no
S0519	but er
S0520	in the er the series that and i have be watch it's a not a documentary any more it's a drama series set in the sixties in america and it's be really popular it's call mad men
S0519	ah i've hear of it i haven't watch it
S0520	yeah have you hear of it yeah so basically it's about these this advertise agency in new york in the nineteen sixties and the whole series span across a decade from nineteen sixty to nineteen seventy one of the and one of the things that i think people like about it and that's make it popular be that it kind of show the development in american society at that time which be so significant and erm it's really kind of they've try to keep it very very real so for instance like the first episode you watch you're watch it's all set in an office so it's kind of like a professional environment
S0519	mm mm
S0520	and then they follow the character home and obviously get you get involve in their domestic life as well but erm for instance like the way that they speak to woman
S0519	mm
S0520	and treat them in in that environment be like completely shock
S0519	mm
S0520	and they don't you know they obviously try to replicate exactly how it would be you know
S0521	yeah
S0520	erm but anyway the cool it's really that's a nice thing about because they there's so so many things happen in that decade
S0519	mm
S0520	that you know about as be culturally significant you know and inventions that be start to happen and the whole kind of birth of consumerism really
S0519	mm
S0520	people this be because it's an advertise agency you kind of become aware of it of people want
S0521	mm
S0520	and brand have brand identity and stuff
S0519	interest i i haven't watch cos i just think it be all you know sex which i know be
S0520	there's no well there be i mean to be honest they it's not really not explicitly anyway the their lifestyle be quite hedonistic these in this specific er i can't speak properly at the moment this specific erm genre of business how do you say it
S0519	inexplicit mm that'll do anyway
S0520	so they do you know drink a lot go out party and erm and cheat on their wive effectively so there be that element i think that's also more just a reflection of what they be what it be actually like because it be such an male environment as well
S0519	mm
S0520	and they go to work and it be as if they have a different life there
S0519	mm
S0520	that they could have the freedom to do whatever they want and then they go home and they have their family life and it be very very two very separate things and their wive be not
S0519	aware of
S0520	involve or aware they be just like at home be you know a nineteen fifties housewife really and then there be some women in the office who erm gradually have start to you know be able to have an independent life but it be you know it be the sixties so like things do start to change
S0519	the erm it it
S0520	it's not that good i wouldn't like say watch it it's just
S0519	no a lot of people yeah a lot of people have say
S0520	in the way that it portray it and i think it's kind of nostalgic
S0519	mm
S0520	i don't remember any of it obviously it be nostalgic of that time
S0521	yeah
S0520	and it do make you think how there there be a lot of things that start out there that be very recognisable in our society
S0521	yeah
S0520	the way people start to think about things and their value change and so forth
S0519	that's interest
S0520	yeah it be
S0519	there be a a programme here which i didn't watch a lot of and it it it but it be a police series and it be set in the be it in the seventies early seventies anyway erm and there there be a couple of women police
S0520	mm
S0519	in the office and or in the department and it's
S0520	i'm listen
S0519	no
S0520	i'm just check the phone
S0519	no eat your dinner and listen
S0520	yes mummy
S0519	bad girl erm
S0519	so the er but similar to what you say absolutely shock how they speak to the women and how sexist they be and how erm belittle
S0520	mm
S0519	and that it be really really hard and the women of course just take it
S0520	mm
S0519	and have no choices about just take it because that be the environment they choose to come into
S0520	yeah exactly
S0519	be the way that it's sort of put and also how the police treat other people
S0520	mm
S0519	like the criminals and whatever you know smack them and hit them and you know try to get a confession out of them think that they be do you know good a service to the public erm it be you know it it wasn't
S0520	mm mm
S0521	this be this the one with martin shaw the erm he he's the main guy and there's a young assistant
S0519	yeah
S0521	be this the one you're talk about the geordie one
S0519	erm
S0521	cos that's very similar to what you describe i don't know whether it's a
S0519	yes i i think there might be one where it be specifically you know all the cars everything's very authentic
S0520	yeah
S0519	it's all back in that time
S0521	mm
S0519	that's
S0521	they be very in the seventies weren't they
S0520	mm mm
S0521	that's our decade
S0519	mm
S0520	that's your decade even recently there be this thing i don't know if you read about it this woman lawyer so she's on this social media website call linkedin which be like professional social media
S0519	oh i've just read it yeah
S0520	thing so you put your profile but it's not like a social it's a professional thing so you put your cv you put your criteria and the idea be that you can be headhunted or you can connect with other people in your profession and that's the level of how it work you know so this woman be a young woman in work in as a lawyer and she er somehow get in touch with this partner of one of the law firm in london and sort of middle age man probably in his fifties or sixties and erm he write her a message on this website say erm something like this might be completely un pc but you look absolutely beautiful in your profile picture you know kind of that level of flirtation you know
S0521	yeah
S0520	so she write back to him say this be completely unacceptable behaviour
S0521	yeah i read that i read that
S0520	and you know misogynistic and you know this be how men assert their power over women in the workplace by reduce them to the the way that they look instead of their you know like a cool reply and then she post it on twitter the whole exchange and there be obviously a big frenzy at that point
S0519	mm
S0520	you know of people respond in different ways some people be extremely rude to her
S0521	bite over the top really wasn't it
S0520	and a lot of women say good on you wish i could have do that because that's i encounter that kind of prejudice every day in the workplace and especially in the law erm industry where it's all an old boys' club essentially
S0519	mm
S0520	and it have be for a long time so you know it's there's some quite and it's like that in cambridge as well you know that kind of thing be quite acceptable because it's all be a male environment for so long and it's still traditionally they're still it's still structure like that in a lot of ways you know and like er you know there's one woman in the faculty of whatever as a token
S0521	gesture
S0520	i didn't think i mean it seem a little bite over the top but it's not like in as a single incident you can just brush it off and say whatever you know the guy be just flirt with this good look girl
S0519	yeah she could have just say don't er make speak to me like that
S0520	but the fact that it it be symptomatic of a certain type of wrong perception of what's okay
S0519	mm
S0520	you know and it seem as if like as a woman if you bring it up as and make and issue out of it it's like people'll go you know don't exaggerate
S0521	right see what you mean
S0520	but it's an accumulation of those small things you know
S0519	i know what you mean
S0520	i do think that it be a good thing to do on her behalf and some people say it be career suicide as well cos she be just never gonna get
S0519	yeah no
S0520	anywhere because
S0519	because no because
S0520	she's speak out against the establishment
S0521	yeah
S0520	but i mean it's horrible if that's you know if if if one of your male colleagues be even
S0519	mm
S0520	in in any way perceive you in that way an older male colleague who have power over you and have the potential to
S0521	mm
S0520	advance your career or not
S0519	mm
S0520	to make to make them feel to make you feel as if that be a factor in their decision make at all
S0519	mm mm that's true
S0520	be not fair
S0519	that's true
S0520	i be on her side
S0519	put in such term
S0520	anyway you know what it's like in social media it always get bite out of hand
S0519	oh completely out of control you can't comment on anything
S0520	there's always these disgust people as well who be go be just
S0519	mm say awful things yeah
S0520	be horrible
S0519	well you do finally work your way through the dinner and you're not allow to touch your phone until you're finish
S0520	what this
S0519	you didn't imagine how many time you would moan if people sit in a restaurant and eat and look at their phone instead of talk to you
S0520	i don't look at phone in restaurants
S0519	well this be your dinner what i have make for you
S0520	sorry mum i agree with you
S0519	it's the little green bits could have be crease out a bite better
S0519	and preferably not on the floor
S0520	sorry i have a bite of a shock cos i pour it in and then i couldn't see
S0519	no i know what you mean
S0520	there be all steam in my spectacles
S0519	very good i enjoy that
S0521	mm
S0519	it's very light even with the potatoes isn't it and the cheese
S0521	yes
S0519	and the saucy stuff it's still a light meal
S0520	yeah it's nice
S0521	i don't remember shell be misogynist really
S0519	you wouldn't know
S0520	you wouldn't know
S0519	you wouldn't have a clue
S0521	i probably wouldn't have a clue
S0519	you be very very very bad in
S0521	i'm sure that it be my perception yeah
S0520	i'm certain in fact
S0521	i'm sure that it be
S0519	and and you personally would say things
S0521	my my observation my observation be that women that get to the top be quite obnoxious people
S0519	but that's what you that's what i mean you think they're obnoxious cos they have to be tough
S0521	because yeah they have to be they have to be hard nose and thick skin to to get where they get
S0520	well everyone do
S0519	everyone do but you don't mind that the men be
S0521	erm that's an interest point of view yeah
S0519	do you right i'm go to brush my teeth cos i'm in a big hurry
S0520	i do i mean i'm not say because i do think the er that women in powerful position can be be notoriously erm how to say
S0520	harder equivalents of their male colleagues
S0521	that's what i be go to say that they over compensate
S0520	yeah well i think
S0521	maybe because they have to
S0520	maybe maybe or maybe because they have a chip on their shoulder about be a female
S0521	yeah
S0520	which be unnecessary but i mean first of all there's just the facts and the figure you know in term of erm
S0521	number of women in high position
S0520	get pay less and women in high position you know they just prove that there's discrimination happen because at university it's fifty fifty so why should it be
S0521	yeah i see what you mean
S0520	uneven at that in that type of environment not not to mention politics
S0521	well the labour party make a big thing about women be in their party but mr corbyn apparently have give all the top job to men and then make sure that the total cabinet be half women
S0520	mm dodgy
S0521	do you read that
S0519	i like the little joke do you
S0520	erm
S0519	they they they be moan because he's only give the women the menial job
S0521	the minor the minor job
S0519	so erm so the little er advert in the time this morning be erm er corbyn talk to a woman and say now your goal be to make sure that the erm red flag be nicely iron
S0520	yeah exactly well it's better than a kick in the teeth but er
S0519	only just
S0520	i do believe there's some way to go
S0520	the erm
S0521	do you use any pan my love
S0519	i use every pan
S0520	every pan
S0519	just in case you be wonder at any stage
S0520	in norway you have to have fifty fifty by law
S0521	do you
S0520	so they do like a positive discrimination drive to make it even
S0521	okay
S0520	and er and that's always controversial because it might not be base on merit but eventually it's suppose to sort of you're suppose to sort of break into the convention and then let it trickle down
S0521	well that of course be the other side of the coin that you have you appoint women because you have to rather than that they have the right credential
S0520	i know
S0519	your jeans will fit a rake on starvation ration
S0520	no you've shrink my jeans
S0519	and the little leggy thing be tuck in it's not dry only one leggy thing
