S0262	yeah yeah
S0305	so even though the whole recruitment selection thing be nothing to do with me the way they do it
S0262	no it's not yeah
S0305	for that particular role be nut
S0262	yeah yeah
S0305	they give make them do a logic test this be media assistant job it's like
S0262	what
S0305	twenty to twenty four grand or something
S0262	which section be this
S0305	an lts that's in your it use to be my section i use to be in charge of that section and then they get erm production managers in to streamline everything as the begin of all this enhance capabilities centralise everything this be the start
S0262	bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit
S0305	bullshit bullshit bullshit so anyway part of it be as part of their application they have to do you know you've see the application form it be that plus a logic test which half the people work in house fail
S0262	yeah
S0305	get all these team work in house as media assistants
S0262	yeah
S0305	they all fail it so that's piss off half the people involve
S0262	be it a lateral think or logic logic test as in
S0305	i don't know
S0262	not quite sure right okay
S0305	i would have fail it probably
S0262	somebody obviously think i know i'm go to be really erm
S0305	oh they bring the consultants in
S0262	about this
S0305	yeah
S0262	you know something like think fast think slow i think that's like can't remember that's erm
S0305	well that be the begin and then as well as that they have these three question one of which be if you be organise a music festival how would you do it my friend organise music festivals
S0262	yeah so she know exactly how to do it
S0305	i've just see this amaze job at the
S0262	and she still doesn't get the bloody erm job
S0305	well she get an interview
S0262	yeah thank you
S0305	where they be give another logic test to make sure they hadn't cheat on the first one
S0262	that sound exactly like what my brother do when he be try to erm recruit but you know i ring up that guy ring me up which be really nice actually
S0305	oh yeah god you be tell me about that so what do he say
S0262	so he if you come across he do seem a bite
S0262	anyway so while i just sort of calm him down i be just go yes and be all very calm and everything about it and he realise i wasn't gonna jump down his throat and then he sort of open up but he's a bite and then in a way it take him age to actually tell me he go you know what actually i've be try to work for the for about two years and i keep get keep i keep get i keep be knock back erm and i couldn't understand why not cos i think i be do alright and the thing about it be i say 's get a structure to it he go you think they're be open but they're be really close
S0305	very close
S0262	it's just have such the opposite so i be be all flowery and colourful with all my like you know i think i be try to it's a communications officer job so i think i'd be a little bite more on the side of meet the brief but do it in quite a little title paragraph little title paragraph little title paragraph i just think it'd be slightly but i be basically make sure that i just send i meet all the essentials and what he tell me be he say
S0305	this be what i suggest he do
S0262	and he say look after quite a lot of pull and of teeth a bite on this one and then he sort of warm up to me a bite and then he's like no okay right what we just really need to do be just list that criteria bullet point list bullet point list bullet point i say yeah that's fine if you come from a really communications background
S0305	really
S0262	he actually then he change his mind it wasn't but i'm the learn advisor i'm now apply for a communications officer job if you're try to change career as long as it's a title base thing
S0305	yeah
S0262	you've get to really work it you've get to try to really give some explanation he well that didn't actually work in your favour you've gotta do it the way we want you to do it and he go if you ever want me to check one of your he be nice actually he go in the end he go if you ever want me to check one of your applications again in the future and i be think actually yeah my god if i run it past i know he would have just say no just change it go like this you know and er but he be like go no if you wanna check if want you know ever try again and i be like well i'll run it past you and i'll run it past him then see you know see like you know
S0305	well there's recently they've all question i don't know they've get interview i can get people as far as interview
S0262	yeah
S0305	but then the recent interview have be shit
S0262	he do okay he
S0305	because the other thing they ask suppose to be a competency base interview but one of the question they ask them be there's a stopwatch you've get five minutes a tidal wave be come you're by the sea
S0262	oh for god's sake
S0305	what be you gonna do inevitably do that as well and
S0262	this be all this lateral think test isn't it it's oh my yeah
S0305	what a load of bullshit we don't want people who can save people from bloody tidal wave we want people who can follow fuck instructions and set code course materials
S0262	yeah exactly
S0305	how mislead
S0262	it's more for the interviewers to have a bite of a laugh like do you really say that like you know she be face with a tidal wave but she'd just crap herself you know what would you you know to be honest with you you'd just
S0306	well the answer the answer be be one of those question the answer be not
S0262	yeah yeah
S0306	they're not look for the content of the answer they're look for how you deal with the question
S0305	yeah exactly
S0306	so people ah it's like okay well you're not
S0262	not but then i think that people get actually like you you probably just wouldn't go ah er you'd probably go okay let me think about this i'll think about it and then people actually start accept that as quite normalise it's like okay let me think about this if i be to actually be look at a massive and then if you do get the wrong answer because people have get preconceive ideas of what they would actually answer so if yours be
S0305	well 's answer sound really good that be the thing
S0262	yeah but what i'd say be good
S0305	and i'm like actually you probably answer that better than all the other question about
S0262	yes though that's bollocks you know my understand of a tidal wave be be you've get no time to think anyway so
S0306	yeah well you would say that a tidal wave would never be that big actually a tsunami maybe but not a tidal wave
S0262	but it do make you
S0305	well there be the one because some group say tidal wave other group say tsunami cos there be like three different panel
S0306	okay
S0262	right and it make you try to look like you're cleverer than you're not
S0305	mm
S0262	like in a way they're try to say you know out clever me
S0306	yeah yeah
S0262	see if you can cos it's not possible because i know actually i'm clever far cleverer than you so you're really be pit against their sense of themselves
S0306	yeah
S0262	which be in interview it's not fair
S0306	yeah
S0262	it isn't
S0305	the whole thing's not fair and the thing be they've be send a thing say it's a competency base interview
S0262	actually i feel like i probably get away with you know cos what you be tell me about refocus
S0305	well that's lts though iet be not part of lts
S0262	oh i bet you anything they're next just wouldn't surprise me
S0305	well we actually think that we be gonna be become part of erm under the refocus
S0262	yeah
S0305	and that hasn't happen yet i suspect in three years' time my
S0262	but do you know what i really like the idea about work for be i know it's really good because you get you know an offer to like you know study and whatever but this educational doctorate thing so i be look at phds today i be look at they call them doctorate in education and people who work for the be gonna get their fee waivered just because they work for
S0305	yep
S0262	no other reason look i'm look at them go but i don't work for but i'm go have to pay like fifteen thousand pound for this
S0305	mm
S0262	but you work there as an associate lecturer or as a tutor blah blah blah blah blah you're gonna get all this scot frigging free
S0305	yeah the nbs be like ridiculous otherwise
S0262	right so i'm i'm look at that i'm look go that be one of the reason why you do wanna go and get a job at because
S0305	yeah
S0262	they're pretty generous you've gotta work for it they're not gonna hand it to you on a plate but my god you could save yourself a shitload of money
S0305	yep
S0262	which be what you're do you know
S0305	it's what i'm do
S0262	so you can see but like in the end the bloke be really the guy i be talk to today be go in a round about way he be say if you don't find the level of expertise here as a supervisor you you might wanna consider look for expertise somewhere else
S0262	what you say to students on an open day cos you've gotta just keep believe that they gonna wanna come to the you know to their place
S0305	yeah they've gotta believe no wonder their open days be crap
S0306	well be they that's kinda good though isn't it because
S0262	oh i like this guy you know he be on my side in that sense
S0306	because that that go against the grain of like the whole education system
S0262	yeah yeah
S0306	because things be just sales you know and
S0262	yep
S0306	market base aren't they
S0305	yeah they're not students they're customers
S0262	mm mm
S0306	erm so like so you know somebody actually look out for the the education of their prospective like
S0262	mm mm no totally with it but i know that if there'd be somebody else in the room he
S0306	yeah
S0262	he never would have say never in a month of sundays but good on him
S0306	yeah
S0262	cos he just basically explain he's get you you you just have to find someone to be commit to them for about five hundred years of your life you know what i mean involve ever
S0305	it's a long time
S0262	if you genuinely don't have an interest share common interest with this person and explain to me how this supervisor erm thing go terribly wrong be that it land on their desk they feel obligate because they're under pressure as an academic to get the money come in as in supervise a phd candidate
S0305	yeah yeah
S0262	they say no too many time big black mark
S0305	mm
S0262	you you don't get promotions base on that so you have to kind of do it but then you're do it because you have to kind of do it and that poor person genuinely think that that research that they're do be original that it's go to make a big difference to everyone er like even someone not even just you know just somebody else like it might make a difference but it isn't cos that supervisor's just basically go don't care not interest couldn't give a shit actually i'm gonna give you minimal supervisory er you've pay shit load of money
S0305	well i didn't realise how lucky i be with my master supervisor
S0262	mm
S0305	he be so patient he be actually a quaker which probably help but he have the patience of a saint
S0262	mm patience yeah
S0305	he he give me like i i'd go for bloody months without send him anything
S0262	mm
S0305	almost years in fact
S0262	mm
S0305	seem to go over a chapter for a year for the first couple of years
S0262	yeah
S0305	and he be still really positive and contractive
S0262	and my master be completely different i feel like i've be sell down the river by the i feel like they've make this educate doctorate in education because of people like me
S0305	i can't remember i'd have to show it to you it be it be that thick
S0262	do you know what i write for my master five thousand word
S0306	be that all
S0262	can you believe it
S0305	really no way
S0262	and they ask me to write no this be honestly
S0305	that's brilliant i might do one of those next wow
S0262	do you know what they've ask me to write about choose a top down sorry a top down management approach erm in a in a in an education set of your choice it's non negotiable right okay fine and then argue the case from a scientific paradigm a constructivist paradigm an interpretist's paradigm and a critical erm theoretical researcher's paradigm and i go what the fuck do that mean
S0305	yeah
S0262	you know like we haven't even
S0305	that would probably take me four years to work out what that mean actually
S0262	what do it matter and it and that and that just get on with it and do it in five thousand word i be like so all of my learn of a whole year all you're interest in be what i can actually argue about be like worzel gummidge put one head on and be one person and then be another person and another person be that all you're interest in you're not really interest in me at all be you at all
S0306	yeah
S0262	you couldn't give a shit about what i think you just want me to think like you
S0306	mm
S0262	in five thousand word and do you know what it be so babyish it be like task one two hundred word task two three hundred word this be post graduate
S0305	that's unbelievable
S0262	and they think that people who like me who have just write five thousand word can then go on to do a doctorate degree okay it's not a phd but it's get doctorate in it it's a higher degree
S0305	mm
S0262	how be people mean to make that jump exactly i put my question up i go my up and i go how exactly be people mean to make that jump it's kind of like not allow people to well certainly miss out on your gcses and no certainly miss out on your a level go from gcses straight into university that's what that's like and i sort of mention it a bite like that and they're like oh no what's this here what's that one in the corner talk about she's ruffle people's feather and then say oh well then you would change track to be a phd i say but then what you're say be that phd's superior
S0306	mm
S0262	to a doctorate in education but why would you say that because it's not it go on like that for a while and then when i find that guy
S0305	them
S0262	he be actually really mellow he didn't have that edge on him which be like market money you know he be just like oh yeah you're right it's a bite like this a bite shit but you know if you really want it think about how much you want it though that's what he do say you know think about it and i be like yeah i'm think about it man i'm not just gonna sign up for it because you know i've get nothing better to do
S0305	wait till i've get a job here and then that's pay for cos otherwise
S0262	yeah well exactly well then i would frickin do it and i could see why i mean there be only one guy there this be like phd for this be their open day
S0305	mm
S0262	one male and he leave at lunchtime
S0305	welcome to my world
S0306	you mean the staff or
S0262	er staff no that's fine that be quite representative it be like a balance
S0306	okay yeah yeah
S0305	oh no cos they be senior academics they be mostly male but then all the lower level be chicks and then that's the weird thing it's like all the chicks and yet all the seniors be guy it's like how do this work
S0262	but it be like but this be education this be academia this be you know this be just try to get on and do something a little bite you know i be think a fair bite of men might be knock around go i'd quite like to do a doctorate degree in blah blah blah but then i remember
S0305	nah it's all chicks
S0262	education
S0305	chicks
S0262	but then when you look at academics as in the pure breed of that mean of the word
S0305	mm
S0262	but that's a healthy mix you know i don't know you know
S0305	yeah usually but education be generally more female
S0262	mm mm
S0305	but still that be incredible there's only one
S0262	mm one
S0305	wow
S0262	mm pretty bad
S0306	mm
S0262	i dunno maybe it be just an off day
S0305	well bad weather
S0262	yeah it well yes
S0305	be the football on or something
S0262	well i don't know it might have be
S0262	but how be you enjoy your course
S0306	yeah i mean go you know i'm certainly enjoy it erm they're make me work all of a sudden which i wasn't quite expect
S0262	mm
S0306	like i cruise through life to get like one essay we do every six weeks
S0262	mm
S0306	turn up like forty percent of the time no turn i've get three deadlines in the first four weeks
S0262	oh that's a lot
S0306	it's like not major project obviously but like just a consistency they be need to
S0262	yeah it's like boom boom cha cha cha yeah
S0306	yeah erm so it's like i felt with that like i like to really get to get to grip with something and i feel like that's not not enough time to churn stuff out you know like
S0262	yeah
S0306	if you really want to display your understand very well and really read a book on the essay or whatever
S0262	yeah yeah
S0306	erm
S0262	but the good thing for you i think be where students have really your peer would be like if i call them that for want of a better word but erm what i've notice cos i do a lot of you know erm help on erm academic skills development and didn't matter what your background be people always have question it doesn't it really really didn't matter but one thing i absolutely know when people be talk to me about how they think they be go to approach erm do a task an assignment and i just think if you've get a sort of basic awareness of what an argument look like an academic argument not even any kind of argument
S0306	mm
S0262	back to and fro blah blah blah probably gonna do alright as long as you don't get too clever
S0306	mm
S0262	whereas people who've get no no construct to
S0306	mm mm
S0262	they just actually think it's all descriptive write blah blah blah blah blah and whatever and they will fail because of that erm so i think as long as you i don't know prob probably say but i think that what i learn to do be just just stick to things like my argument be my rationale my my and then they don't they'll actually just pass you whether you actually read that book or not i know that's in a way it's kid yourself because you actually really wanna read that book but you're really kid them because all you really wanna do be kid them right now because you can always read that book in your spare time
S0306	yeah true
S0262	and you don't actually have to prove anything
S0306	yeah
S0305	right decision time
S0262	yeah
S0305	shall i cook or do we do we want to go out
S0306	i think we should go out let's go out
S0305	you wanna go out
S0306	be that alright
S0305	yeah
S0262	mm
S0305	i wanna go out we do have a ridiculous amount of food in the house but that's okay maybe we can freeze some of it
S0306	let's go out do some this week
S0262	you wanna go out yeah cool alright so do you do you me to
S0306	huh
S0262	do you want me to drive
S0305	no don't be silly
S0306	it's only a walk round the corner
S0262	mm
S0306	how be you alright but you know it's only round the corner
S0305	you're you're probably over the limit
S0305	to be fair we've have like two and a half
S0262	well i haven't be knock it back too much cos i wasn't too sure what the situation be but
S0306	i imagine that's mostly 's don't worry
S0305	it wasn't entirely
S0262	no no no no we've be like like
S0305	it wasn't just me
S0262	well alright so we just walk around the corner then
S0305	it's it's a ten minute walk
S0262	okay
S0305	be it still rain we can get a cab back
S0262	mm so that's what i think i think that in a way as long as you just they don't even you know the most depress thing about it be be they don't actually read anything about what you've actually learn
S0306	mm
S0262	i know that sound awful but they don't actually care and that's what i have to accept be okay so they don't actually care they couldn't give a shit erm so might be one you might really write really well for because you you think that they've actually show an interest in you because you've show an interest in them you know how that relationship work like
S0306	yeah
S0262	no i really like your stuff oh then i'll like your stuff and then they might actually really write some constructive feedback for you
S0306	mm
S0262	as a kind of go you've get that you haven't get that you have get that oh well do but most of them be just robotic
S0306	yeah
S0262	they use to have just to give you an insight into this they use to have erm competitions with each other and first year particularly about how quickly they could mark an essay
S0262	and one of them go i do it in three minutes
S0305	who do this
S0262	these be academics
S0305	jesus three minutes
S0262	who be who be who be good academics like
S0305	they've me i've never do three minutes
S0262	on piece of paper you go
S0305	i'd always give them at least twenty
S0262	but exactly but they compete they try to out compete i mean all of them i mean a lot of them be actually really like slog it hard try to give you feedback but actually kind of not the point either really what you have to do be condense your feedback and give it back to them really succinctly so you can't give people too much to think about it just worry them and so it's a balance but they they when i be do some research into this about evaluation of metaphors into evaluation and education which be the last thing i be do i give them like little card which be the evaluation be a production line evaluation be and evaluation be in term of students' performance or academic achievement or learn progress they could interpret it if they like it's amaze how many of these metaphors be come up which be more to do with market more to do with accountability and these weren't even people who have actually a market background or any kind of account they've just be bombard with it from every day discourse
S0305	mm
S0262	management speak and you have to think like this you have to do like that so they're actually begin to think like these people
S0306	mm
S0262	when they're actually never ever really you know start out that way so it be like so i be try to make a connect to what their previous study would have be or their previous industry experience so so evaluation in your previous job what be it have it evaluation in your job now what be it get to do a little venn diagram and then ones that meet in the middle it be really really interest but it didn't really matter what they put where it's what they say that count
S0306	mm
S0262	so i record all that and i look back at it and i be like they hate it they actually almost hate themselves
S0305	well i think
S0262	there be a self loathe about it cos they they didn't like
S0305	yeah yeah yeah cos they're
S0262	the pictorial graphics on this one when they saw their diagram yeah
S0305	some of the for my first assignment from be similar because it's like you've get these people and they feel passionately about the subject area
S0262	yeah
S0305	but now like so many other things like music or whatever you're not just expect to do this you're suppose to promote it and get students in
S0262	yep
S0305	and you're suppose to be everything to everybody
S0262	yeah
S0305	and they can't handle it they just can't handle it
S0262	yeah and i don't think i could either i actually know my limitations and i think i'd probably run for the hill it's just the way people'd say oh look but you've get all the teach experience all you need to do be get your research degree
S0305	oh project manager sorry project manager
S0262	yeah yeah
S0305	the stay away from that
S0262	you know if you climb from lecturer to senior lecturer you could do the career path blah blah blah you know if you be really to go and get that phd you know just get yourself in with somewhere you cos you've get the teach bite you won't have to worry about it so much because most of the academics have get research degrees but no teach qualifications it's like that's really hard
S0305	mm
S0262	you have to do like about sixty percent of your job be teach but you've get no idea
S0305	despite the business score crash and burn at the moment they've get these really dare i say it
S0305	nerdy guy who've study finance and they're try to make them teach
S0262	scar
S0305	they have to
S0262	they're really anxious because
S0305	yeah
S0262	when you're just research on your own or collaborate you can kind of hide and you can sort of make make things kind of happen in the background cos you actually get somebody else to do a lot of the work but with teach you're absolutely there people be judge you evaluate you that you can't we could try to hide but if you have to do a lecture where be you gonna hide exactly
S0306	mm
S0262	behind the well non existent whiteboard because now it's a screen and you have to look beautiful and you have to do this and you have to prepare that
S0305	and then put your note on moodle afterwards even though you might not have actually do it on any note in the first place
S0262	yeah yeah so you might have prepare a brilliant lecture with a guest speaker throw in for good measure and a little bite of exercise as i use to do a lecture in critical think where some people would say would you come into my lecture and do twenty minutes of it just to boost the of it
S0305	oh god those be the most traumatic lecture that's what put me off be a lecturer be critical think
S0262	yeah
S0305	richard fuck dawkins the selfish gene man
S0262	yes
S0305	that be traumatic that be so traumatic
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0305	as know i hate richard dawkins with a passion now
S0262	mm
S0305	he almost redeem himself when he be gonna take on the pope and then he chickened out
S0262	yeah
S0305	and i be like you're just a you be a dick dicky dawkins you're just a dick
S0262	dicky dawkins
S0305	but yeah the selfish gene critical think
S0262	yeah yeah
S0305	awful horrible
S0262	yeah yeah yeah so
S0306	yeah but the the problem with that be i'm sure you'll happily disagree but like the problem with that
S0306	it's not it's not richard dawkins it's the structure of learn
S0305	it's the students that's what all the academics say to me it's the students
S0306	well it's the no no it's the structure of learn
S0262	it's always the student's fault than the other way round
S0306	although students have come but they seem to come through this it's make that task alien alien to them or they they pick up completely the wrong that be the it be the literal critical think skills that have not be teach previous
S0305	well that's what we're attempt to teach
S0262	but
S0305	ironically enough and with dawkins
S0262	yeah
S0305	it's the fact that if you do dare i say it look at the selfish dean don't buy a copy cos he'll get some money from it
S0262	yeah
S0305	but there's like at least two if not three chapters that be just base on metaphors and there's no scientific fact
S0262	no
S0305	but he's such a persuasive writer he's just such a good as a rhetoritative i can't even say the word
S0262	yeah yeah exactly it's the rhetoric yeah yeah it's the rhetoric yeah
S0305	that you read it and you just believe especially if you're a first year med student you read it and you go wow this be amaze
S0262	yeah i remember because i i be lucky cos i have erm a job where i have students come to me and ask me really great question about how do i write an essay how do i do reference and every single person's question be different and i answer it differently so every individual's get a slightly different take on things so that's brilliant and then when i be have to work with academics try to imbed academic literacy whatever that mean erm into their course of you know it be just basically upskilling them a little bite
S0305	yeah suppose to do that
S0262	slightly more aware of students than they be previously that's really the job but you know i could act as an intermediary so i'd actually say to students you know like how you're grapple with this they're grapple with that too cos they don't know how to mark it whereas i'd say then to the academics you know how you're try to assess it well so your students be also try to understand whether they're go to make any progress or not they don't actually know whether they're gonna learn anything or not they don't even know if you're actually gonna be able to be able to tell them or not so you're actually you're both on the same side but you're pitch from the start as if you're against each other why i mean even some lecturers who like their students who be generally interest and i mean first year lecturers be actually some of them be just like love you guy because they want some adoration but they also kinda get something about it but they do actually feel students' feel you know
S0305	every guy that i work with one of their students that oh be another issue
S0262	yeah but most of the time if you ever go into lecture and i observe lecture and i literally slip into the back of lecture like whatever just to see what everyone be do most of them be on facebook but i'd actually want to see what the lecturer's actually try to achieve and then i kinda look at their powerpoint okay you know what be they communicate as a communicator what be their presentation skills about zilch like as in no it's like the
S0305	complete rubbish rubbish
S0262	you know like the erm like a castle like a medieval castle it be like the drawbridge yeah or all the
S0305	yeah
S0262	so students aren't gonna be interest in you because you've already before you've even set foot in the lecture theatre you've already really make yourself non accessible you may be brilliant in your mind but your mind isn't work effectively because it isn't actually flow outwards it's just keep itself within and students will go on facebook but i tell you i've see the difference when somebody fuck say something in a really interest way you know mobiles get put away laptops get put down and people go i've actually see that happen which be i've also see the reverse of course it's like bore just whatever but it's not like students go to university to be bore they actually go cos they think they're gonna be excite
S0306	mm mm
S0262	but then through their first year they realise they're not actually be excite on most occasion
S0305	i can still remember how disappoint the lecture be
S0262	and then they get into a mindset be that university be actually quite bore and then your second year and your third year be kind of really taint by that so first year lecturers have to be brilliant
S0306	mm mm
S0262	but they actually put the shit ones in the first years and then leave the ones the with the it's the reverse it should be people who have a broad church of perspectives not just in their discipline they can go you're do a degree in okay i can see how why this might be important for you but you can say that to five hundred people you can say that to one person i always say to lecturers whatever you're say and think you can say to five hundred people you can say to five you don't need people clamour for your attention you don't have to have them around you to feel like you can give them something give them something from the start i mean you'll know all this you i'm talk to somebody who know all of this cos like that's what you do you're a dj you know you're not think about number of people how many people be dance how many people you're just like i'm gonna give i'm gonna be generous but you'll notice how many of them even if they want to be generous with their knowledge they can't really block
S0306	but do you think
S0262	it's like kind of a big poo but they can't
S0306	but do you do do you think like it's largely the the erm how do you describe it so like the traditional teach methods or like the the that give people that inhibition about actually express their themselves in their their their subject in a way that really relate because we go through this huge process of like you know er school not not be very fun and formal curriculums have to be convey and so on and so forth so so by the time that you probably become a lecturer you you've go through your own education yourself and you've pick up unconsciously you've internalise a certain manner in which
S0262	mm
S0306	information be convey
S0262	mm mm mm mm mm mm i think that's very interest what you're say i'm sure that's a large part of it i don't know much about it
S0305	see i
S0262	but i think that's really interest what you've ask yeah
S0305	i can actually remember how bore the lecture be when i be eighteen
S0262	yeah
S0305	because i'm a visual person and i remember noise and i've learn that over the years but the problem with study by distance be you're just read all this shit over and over
S0262	yeah
S0305	and i don't remember a computer screen
S0262	yeah
S0305	i mean do you find if you have an interest lecture do you remember it or do it just blend into another lecture
S0306	erm
S0305	cos the few interest ones i have i use to be able to and even the bore ones i can remember because they be just so tedious
S0262	like word for word almost yeah yeah yeah
S0305	i can remember this this history teacher and it be thursday mornings i always have a hangover cos we go to the pub on wednesdays
S0262	yeah
S0305	and she keep go on for weeks about this bloke call bloody arthur this and arthur that she use to handwrite it overhead projector things in those days
S0262	yeah which be i love it
S0305	handwritten she'd be scrawl on them and and you'd be like what the fuck do that say blah blah blah
S0262	there's something so personal about it though
S0305	i'm hungover i can't see what she's write and i can't ask her
S0262	it be if the handwrite be bad but i like the fact she make an effort you know it's something personal
S0305	you know i'd get home and i'd be like arthur let's have a date
S0262	yeah whatever
S0305	and there be only like when i finally she finally type something up and give us a course erm description and that be like king fuck arthur be in medieval british history
S0305	i mean for all these
S0262	arthur arthur where the fuck be arthur who the fuck be arthur
S0306	so you so you be you suppose to be in that or not be you oh right okay
S0305	yeah it be nine o'clock on a thursday morning and i be hungover as hell always i be like it be the one day i didn't have science because i be do a medical intermediate because my parent want me to be a doctor so all the other days i be do biology and chemistry which i hat and
S0262	yeah
S0305	didn't really remember anything of but history be like yeah i wanna do history so i get up and go
S0262	yeah
S0305	and i'd sit there go how can she make something that should be so interest be so bore
S0262	so dull yep
S0305	arthur arthur and then she oh who be the other bloke there be some other really important bloke she'd be talk about for weeks
S0262	but what about your lecturers at the moment like do you find do anything what we're talk about kind of represent how it's come across to you or
S0306	er er yes certainly what you're say about like erm the difference an engage speaker can make so i mean erm in one of my lecture we're do the geographies of the body so there be a particularly
S0305	oh be that all the french feminists
S0306	no there's definitely there's definitely yeah possibly yeah erm so it's just about it's fairly new new discipline
S0305	oh what be the name what be the name i be really try to do a margaret atwell book analysis
S0262	no i don't know anything about this what be what be geography of the body
S0306	so it's this idea that so er it's about spacial spacial concepts in geography so like you know you can treat the house as a geographical location you can treat the street the the city but you can also treat your body as a geographical location
S0262	okay i've be get into a bite of yoga recently i think i can go with that yeah okay yeah
S0306	erm so so in term of say like so we be we be be we be talk about erm the way body be view in be view in certain contexts so the beach or the er you know
S0262	mm mm
S0306	er girls' school in the nineteen sixties
S0262	mm mm
S0306	and how these you know erm it's probably form as probably part of human geography i think it's part of human geography
S0262	yeah
S0306	erm er it's all a bite wishy washy and conceptual to be honest but er erm
S0262	do you like wishy washy conceptual stuff though or do you prefer it to be a bite bite more ground
S0306	erm
S0262	cos each learner's different so
S0306	i certainly no i like mm er da da da erm i i i just like concrete stuff that i can see apply to
S0262	yeah
S0306	cos i'm very political very orient into politics and like stuff that be
S0262	yeah
S0306	kind of can concretely i can concretely take away and think ah so that mean something because i see it in the real world or
S0262	yeah
S0306	it enlighten me about a particular event or something erm
S0262	yeah yeah and i i can get that and you know what i don't think you're alone in that it's political or but the idea of erm go look i have a world vision i vision of the world i need to see it through my eye to begin with
S0306	mm mm
S0262	and then once i've understand how my eye work and er how they may not work so there's some science there too the ones that i can kind of deal with me then i can maybe even branch out a little bite and deal with some other people
S0306	mm mm mm
S0262	you know but that's not really how we work we really work the opposite we learn the opposite which be everyone else have think about it
S0306	yeah
S0262	we've kind of already work it out for you so we've do the work out and all we're gonna do be tell you the bits that we think
S0306	you find be interest yeah
S0262	you know might necessarily for you but we probably leave that with shit load of stuff that's really interest for you
S0306	yeah
S0262	or at least give you curiosity about it so we really really come from a different mechanism of learn and i think that's really important to bear in mind that when you're look at your lecturers and you're go how the fuck have they actually choose to give that example but not an alternative example which you might actually have question as in as in put your hand up and go i i really like what you've be talk about there i think that's really great erm i i personally be just wonder you know you've probably already figure this well out but could you just sort of tell me about how that might ply onto this situation here because that's my interest if you don't mind just sort of you know and i think if more people ask question in lecture we'd all go
S0305	but that's a mature student thing most first year students will sit there
S0262	it be but but
S0305	they just wanna listen they wanna be entertain
S0262	but that's why
S0305	they're there cos they pay for it they haven't really think it through
S0262	but they but they they hog the the limelight and that really annoy me cos i've actually have to say to mature students
S0306	we hog the limelight do we
S0262	just no not you but i'm just say you know if you get a reputation as a hogger
S0306	yeah
S0262	it piss everyone else off
S0305	i use to dread mature students
S0262	yeah
S0305	i i know them all by first name erm
S0262	you've you've really gotta give you've gotta give somebody else a chance
S0305	we have over a thousand students we have twelve hundred students
S0262	yeah
S0305	and i know all the mature students by first name
S0262	right there you go
S0305	and i use to actually in some case i hate to say it though well we know your opinion already so how about you over here who hasn't talk for two months what do you think
S0262	yeah
S0305	i mean what can you do
S0262	but then if you're if you're a mature student you're a mature student right i could see how this could work where the other people have be look at you go okay rather than you be and kind of come across to them you're not a know it all but you come across not you not specifically but it could be that people who actually really be quite well read
S0306	mm mm
S0262	really very literate very interest in what they're interest in very knowledgable and already start to implement some of their ideas in real life these be things you know you're an advance learner there's no doubt about it but for somebody who's just really never even start to think about anything yet
S0306	mm
S0262	you'll meet them you'll you'll you know who they be
S0306	yeah
S0262	so i guess like the way to do it be like you don't want to alienate them and you don't want to alienate the lecturer cos the lecturer'll go oh fuck here we've get you know so and so probably know more than me and they hate that bite you know it's like not that you really do but you do know quite a lot so it could be that you might come across as slightly challenge that's okay i don't think there's anything wrong with it but for the other people who don't understand what the challenge be it's an argument isn't it but you know what i be say to you during about earlier be that some people don't know what an argument be
S0306	yeah
S0262	so what i be say what they think you're be
S0305	but they don't and that's back to critical think isn't it
S0262	so i could see why one thing i do you know what i really like about it
S0262	ask a lecturer for everyone's sake be what be the misconceptions about this so you're not actually say i know what they be people who go what do he mean about misconception that force the lecturer to think you're actually just ask it from a flipside rather than go please validate what i already know cos i kind of like already know but i want you to further extend my understand
S0306	mm mm
S0262	but you can't cos you're in a lecture if you be in a one on one be plenty talk away till the cow come home
S0306	yeah
S0262	but i've often find i say to my first year students whether they be mature students or first year students put your hand up when you're really genuinely confuse okay or genuinely excite anything that's go on within you in term of like you feel something put your hand up in a right kind of breath of you know pause and just say but what be the misconceptions about this that get people think even if you don't know fuck all and if you know shitloads because everyone's get a contribution to make i think the misconception about human geography be about this i think the misconception be about somebody's sit there go what be a misconception but they'll learn because you'll be have a three four five way dialogue so they'll go the misconception be that i've actually get this wrong i be tell you about that earlier but i think that's a really good way of rather than say tell me what i want to hear you're actually ask the lecturer to do the reverse of that be like tell me what i don't want to hear tell me something that i don't actually understand and i think for you that would be great because you need challenge you need to not be bore with the fact that a lot of people you're study with be gonna know nothing about this
S0306	yeah okay i'll give that a shoot when i'm er
S0262	well no i just you know i don't know it's just another way of do things
S0305	if you get really bore at least you can
S0306	it's it's definitely there's definitely gotta be a way to spice things up a bite more cos i've do the i've do the smartarse thing in lecture and then yeah
S0262	and how do that go down
S0306	we yeah no you just feel a bite awkward afterwards
S0262	yeah you do
S0306	cos i'm i'm grasp for a a sense of something that be like or a level of something that nobody else in the room be grasp for so the so the the lecturer be just like
S0262	this be gonna blow everyone's mind yeah
S0306	okay then yeah
S0262	yeah if i give you my honest answer it's like his intellectual approach of his answer that will blow the rest of them so they will be out of it all a sudden the start
S0306	yeah
S0262	but i do think that erm enquire and just flip everything around that you can just like go not that you're hide your bushel you know you're not say you don't know anything you definitely do but at least you can engage other people in debate
S0306	yeah
S0262	because somebody might go no i disagree with you your misconception about this isn't the same idea of my misconception about in a way it's easier to deal with misconceptions for some really weird reason because yeah i don't quite know why it work like that but it's kind of almost like say tell me what you don't know and tell me why you don't know it's it's a really different way of learn it's like a pushback rather normally we tell everybody what we've learn and how good we be at learn and what we can intellectually argue this be the completely reverse of that but i bet you anything it include more people and i think if you wanna actually have lot of people to talk to about things you're interest in this be the way to build that kind of rapport with your with your fellow learners cos misconceptions be around us
S0306	mm mm
S0262	all the time and you can play devil's advocate i mean like play you know but you could actually skilfully for you know you know you could play with it and that's good for your essay write because you can actually then just go well this way things like this counter argument be mm i know even today i hear in my class or tutorial mm mm so you be gonna help yourself to learn from other people cos otherwise i think you'll just get really bore
S0306	mm
S0262	i think you'll get really bore i've see people like you come through and go this be dull and i'm like but the subject isn't dull yeah no but the people be as you say you've get to spice up and you've gotta find a way to keep yourself interest otherwise you could take a fuck and get certificate i mean i know i'm not not say that you would cos you want like i'm not say that you would but you could just go and do it off your own bat and sail through it
S0306	well pretty much everything i write about in essay be book i've read anyway so almost yeah
S0262	well that's a great start and i think that i think that will endear you to your your lecturers yeah
S0305	see i didn't get that into like my post graduate year and even that be stuff i could
S0262	oh my god this guy's read a book not just the first paragraph and plagiarise it
S0262	i mean we be look at some awful i mean practice in term of academic practice from students but then i won't go on about the
S0305	i live in fear of be do for plagiarism because
S0262	yeah me too
S0305	one of the problems with be they want you to regurgitate the book
S0262	mm
S0305	and how can you do that when there's just one book
S0262	yeah yeah
S0305	at least you know he's throw in the whole bloody book he's read because he's want to
S0262	well then he have a legitimate right to do it you're on you're on shaky grind
S0305	i'm on real shaky grind like my last tma i be actually because i hand it in at one and a half minutes to twelve so i'm already in the
S0262	yeah time okay corraly like this sort of
S0305	yeah it's like right at the last minute
S0262	yeah
S0305	and then of course i get it back last and everyone else have get theirs back already and they be like oh yeah so so hard and do okay and i be like actually i be just think back because they're so short you can say fuck all and stuff
S0262	yeah
S0305	it's harder for me do the short stuff than the long stuff
S0262	oh me too like a
S0305	there be like about four paragraph they hadn't off the website
S0262	ah ha
S0305	and because that's the only place that you're allow to get the information be the book or the website cos it's the business school
S0262	yeah
S0305	luckily for me they do still have book hallelujah i can write all over them and take them on the bus and
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0305	should see the state of them
S0262	oh instead of like caress them book
S0305	yeah book yay but i be so paranoid by when i hadn't hear for an extra week i be sure i be sure i be gonna be do for plagiarism cos one guy who'd do quite badly in the exam and he'd do well in the assignments cos we have a really good study group for the previous module he get look into for three months and i be so embarrass the
S0262	be they watch him from the start okay
S0305	well i think the thing be because he'd do so badly in the exam compare with the assignments and he'd obviously do well in the assignments because we have a really good study group so we'd all get there and talk like i get seventy in one of my corporate finance because
S0262	right brilliant yeah
S0305	you know i be the study group
S0262	cos you all work really well together
S0305	yeah and they give me the answer but i do actually sit there for a day for each question
S0262	yeah
S0305	i take five days off work for the last tma and i would spend a day on each question and try and work it out for myself
S0262	yeah
S0305	because i know that be really important to do the exam
S0262	yeah
S0305	and if you've get five days you can do that
S0262	yeah yeah that's true
S0305	but when you've get forty five minutes per question
S0262	it's not gonna happen
S0305	you can't do that
S0262	it's not gonna happen
S0305	anyway this poor bloke
S0262	yeah
S0305	they really really fuck him round and in the end they finally say oh well actually what it be we put your second tma through this i can't remember the name of the software
S0262	like turn in or some sort of plagiarism checker yeah
S0305	there be two paragraph
S0262	which be total bullshit
S0305	he basically paraphrase from the book his english be a second language he's from bangladesh or somewhere
S0262	yeah
S0305	and he hadn't put a an
S0262	yeah and it can be sometimes it can be just you're on a deadline and you just literally mistake it be a mistake you know
S0306	yeah
S0262	it happen we're we're bloody humans anyway shall we go for something to
