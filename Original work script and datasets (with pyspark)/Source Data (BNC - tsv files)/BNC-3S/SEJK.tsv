S0454	ah yes that's one's very good i like how it start
S0455	oh right
S0454	quite interest
S0455	yeah yes it be because it's historical isn't it
S0454	yes and it's
S0455	i remember that one
S0454	it's quite interest cos it's look at two issue as well
S0455	yes
S0454	the erm return soldier
S0455	mm
S0454	and then also how the black erm
S0454	be treat at that time
S0454	but also how difficult it must've be cos they be treat very differently in france
S0455	yes yes that's right
S0454	and then they come back and then have to
S0455	yes
S0454	do all the racism and then see it as a sort of chance to
S0455	yes
S0454	make change but of course people who hadn't be to war didn't see it like that
S0455	no
S0454	they just want to
S0455	no no yeah
S0454	keep go in the same way and they be fine with it
S0452	sorry sorry
S0455	yes
S0454	it must've be doubly difficult for them
S0455	mm what's sort of recently be what a lot of research you've get quite a lot of
S0454	yeah
S0455	because you have to be so knowledgeable haven't you about the facts there's no point if you've get it all wrong
S0454	yes that's right it seem like that author do
S0455	mm yes
S0455	no i find it very interest
S0454	mm
S0455	treat very badly weren't they the soldier on the
S0454	terrible
S0452	be that the first world war
S0454	yes
S0452	yeah
S0454	this be about the erm black soldier return to
S0452	right
S0454	florida
S0454	which be particularly bad because they have more lynch there than anywhere else in the state and when they come back it be the depression as well
S0452	yeah
S0454	so actually it be probably worse than before they leave less work
S0452	yeah
S0454	and the white want to consolidate power
S0452	yeah
S0454	so it actually get worse for them
S0455	and haven't things change in a relatively short time
S0454	yeah it's good mm
S0455	florida
S0454	yes it be good
S0455	mm
S0454	i think there's a lot of resentment on both side
S0455	mm
S0454	you don't really see that in the uk but
S0455	no
S0452	it seem to be
S0454	yeah sort of underlie racism in
S0452	yes
S0455	mm
S0454	in er well yes er what i think be interest be the segregation be completely voluntary on both side but very extreme like i remember the din hall in you remember when
S0455	oh
S0452	oh yeah yeah
S0454	eat in the cafeteria the black would all sit at one table and the white would all sit at others that be totally by their choice
S0452	mm
S0454	i think that be very worry
S0452	mm
S0455	yes
S0454	cos er that wouldn't happen in the uk would it
S0455	no
S0452	no
S0454	it would never be that extreme
S0455	no no
S0454	mm
S0452	mm well police do erm use additional violence they seem to don't they when they arrest black people
S0454	yes they do
S0452	and of course there's immediately there's an immediate riot
S0454	yes
S0454	well yes it do seem there's problems of
S0452	yeah it's more
S0454	institutionalise racism as well
S0452	yeah
S0454	mm
S0455	but erm i think things have move on a lot cos when i be at college there be just about four african students
S0454	mm
S0455	and i be cos use to bring people home
S0454	mm
S0455	erm you know for the holiday and things so i'd go and sort of chat
S0454	yes
S0455	but er but otherwise they seem to be completely separate they they stay with as friends the four of them but nobody seem to mix in with them
S0454	oh right
S0455	separate race but that wouldn't happen today would it
S0452	no
S0454	no
S0455	no it wasn't deliberate it be that just like oh you know they're different sort of thing and probably didn't make the same effort
S0454	yes

S0454	mm nice if you've get grapes you do see them like some quite well establish vines grow outside in don't you
S0452	yeah
S0454	cos it's not that cold in the winter
S0452	in the summer
S0454	it's more about the wind and the shelter
S0454	yeah
S0452	five miles from here i think that's get a vineyard
S0454	ah yes that's right i wouldn't mind go there one day have a look
S0452	forget what it's call
S0454	have you be
S0452	no
S0454	well i wouldn't mind stop in there yes that must be alright mustn't it they're outside
S0452	well yes of course that's on a greater scale
S0454	yeah and grandpa have a vine didn't he in that greenhouse for years
S0452	yeah
S0454	but i think the root be outside
S0452	yeah
S0454	mm so you're not tempt to grow chillies after the front page story in the time
S0452	no mum doesn't like anything like that so we don't
S0454	no
S0452	but you know
S0454	i suppose if you're on your own it's not difficult to
S0452	no
S0454	put one in whatever you're cook
S0452	no
S0454	guess you could do something easy like chilli con carne
S0452	cook about normally about three three time a week yeah
S0454	that's just one pot cook isn't it
S0452	yeah
S0454	mm
S0452	like the bean and
S0454	yes that's just one pot and then rice
S0452	yeah
S0454	yes yes i like dal but not that often but that's have that
S0452	what's it call
S0454	dal d a l
S0452	i i don't know actually
S0454	ah well you can do it
S0452	be it spicy
S0454	yes so it's a very cheap meal so everywhere in the gulf if you go to a local restaurant properly local then it'll be run by either bangladeshis or indian
S0452	mm
S0454	and they never have a menu and they can't speak english but if you say dal
S0452	yeah
S0454	always have a pot of dal on you know it's safe cos it's vegetarian
S0452	and be it and it's safe
S0454	it's just lentils basically lentils red lentils
S0452	i've get quite a lot of lentils i've get red and green
S0454	ah yes you can either use the small red ones or the bigger erm split
S0452	green
S0454	yellow lentils and then you just basically
S0452	yeah
S0454	boil them until they turn to mush it's like porridge
S0452	yeah
S0454	thing really and then in a different pan you'd fry an onion and some chilli
S0452	yeah
S0454	and then add that at the end with butter a knob of butter and if you want people put in chop tomatoes it's very one of those really economical meals
S0452	yeah
S0454	which you can see
S0452	and do they have anything with it like rice or garlic bread
S0454	erm yes you often get rice or bread with it
S0452	something just to
S0454	and cos they don't use cutlery
S0452	yeah
S0454	so the bread usually bread cos then you just
S0452	yeah scoop it
S0454	scoop it yes or you can thin it down a bite and make it into soup but erm yes that's quite nice i have that for lunch sometimes like concrete line your stomach
S0452	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0452	be it hot er hot or
S0454	yes but you can choose how hot
S0452	you can just have less of it can't you
S0454	yes you can choose how much you put in yes
S0455	to put in
S0454	yes er but if you have it in a restaurant it's very hot oh this look lovely thank you
S0455	that's good cos there's plenty more
S0454	oh lovely smell nice
S0455	those
S0452	thank you
S0454	mm nice colour and to make it less hot you can cut the chilli open and remove all the seed
S0452	yeah yes they're the hottest bite aren't they
S0454	that's the that's the bite which really make it hot if you take them out then it's not bad and then i think don't chop it up too small cos then if you want to you can pick the bits of chilli out
S0452	yes yeah
S0455	but go back to novels i think
S0454	mm
S0455	you can learn such a lot can't you i mean
S0454	yes
S0455	you know when you read novel

S0455	yes well it sound like it
S0454	certain industries
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0454	like journalism it's all
S0455	yes
S0454	private school
S0455	yes
S0452	mm
S0454	children mm mm
S0455	but it say towards the end of the article cos i skip read it that people from state school erm will actually stick at their job longer
S0454	ah right
S0455	than people who have be in the private sector they often chop and change perhaps they're more fussy that's just great for the
S0454	mm mm

S0455	oh right
S0454	mm
S0454	and in the winter it will die back anyway
S0455	ah yes
S0454	it's not really worth the dry it i don't think
S0455	no okay
