S0617	yeah
S0641	yeah just talk about things because i've the last couple of weeks i've be work by myself
S0617	yeah
S0641	so i guess it's just nice to catch up and talk about the future to kind of
S0617	mm definitely
S0641	give me a bite of motivation for the next couple of weeks you know just it's just nice to get out of the office and be in a different environment sometimes isn't it
S0617	yeah buzz
S0641	yeah i don't think it's sink in really i think cos he's so revitalise after his holiday now he be er he's not that bother but it'll be amaze sort of the stuff he's get plan i look i'm really jealous
S0617	i think everyone will be won't they
S0641	mm
S0617	be jealous
S0641	mm i guess so yeah yeah i think that's the sort of thing i'd like to do next bite of an american trip i think
S0617	yeah just money isn't it you say next next year
S0641	i dunno some of the excursions he's get sound quite sound i'd love to go and see a proper american basketball game
S0617	mm that would be so cool
S0641	yeah back to florida go on all the rid it's amaze isn't it

S0641	you could tell that fresh
S0617	that's good
S0641	yeah it be nice fairly cheap it be about eight pound each
S0617	really good
S0641	i think it's important to get out of the office cos if you're in an office all day you get stick and everything it's like remember be it one of your managers that be say you need to be out of the shop once a week go for a coffee or something
S0617	mm
S0641	just to
S0617	mm
S0641	you get stick in the routine don't you
S0641	get a bite of fresh hair
S0617	that be
S0641	mm
S0617	yeah cos your new ideas come to you when you're not do what you normally do
S0641	mm hm
S0617	that's when you think of new ideas like when you're on holiday when you're on a beach when you're
S0641	mm hm
S0617	when you're not sit in an office like you normally be all day every day
S0641	yeah
S0617	that's when
S0641	bite of inspiration
S0617	yeah good things come don't they
S0641	i think that's like amaze do you want some of this
S0617	er no i'll have a bite of
S0641	shall we halve it
S0617	the wrap i don't want any of the inside though but the wrap's do you reckon i can just erm fry this a little bite that be really really tasty the wrap be
S0641	yeah it be yeah yeah erm yeah that's and 's mentality though they're always go out for food they usually go out for food pretty much every lunchtime
S0617	i think it's such er
S0641	must spend a bomb
S0617	yeah they must spend a lot of money but in a in a way it's a good idea isn't it
S0641	mm yeah they're all they're all they're always go to like seminars as well and they be at business school yesterday and go to like a talk bite of meet it's kind of a bite of a network thing so talk to other businessmen and listen to people that talk on stage which be quite cool isn't it
S0617	really cool yeah
S0641	well also sometimes a bite unnecessary like they need to be do
S0617	oh definitely yeah yeah

S0641	it's funny cos in our in our group it's that get the most banter
S0617	yeah
S0641	do you know that
S0617	yeah
S0641	so he's he's probably he must be dread it cos he's gonna get absolutely rinse
S0617	tomorrow
S0641	mm even by 's dad rinse him
S0617	yeah
S0641	mm he's pretty nasty to him actually
S0617	oh
S0641	mm
S0617	i remember him say something to you once about me 's dad
S0641	mm hm
S0641	punch aren't you
S0641	do alright there haven't you son
S0641	be talk to er today about get bike as well pretty serious about it
S0617	it'll be cool i wanna get a bike
S0641	get one then
S0617	wouldn't be allow to in it though
S0641	's pretty nervy you'd probably be better than him but i wanna go i use to go with in a couple of summer ago
S0617	mm
S0641	in this erm over the actual er trials they're design for bike
S0617	yeah
S0641	and they're quite it's quite tough in place but me and use to absolutely bomb down them
S0617	yeah
S0641	so i dunno if that's that's my idea of get a bike that's the sort of thing i wanna be do
S0617	didn't wanna do it
S0641	but i think 's a bite more of a wimp you have another one of them
S0617	you i've only have two same as you just didn't fill them all up
S0641	do you want some fill
S0617	no
S0617	so what want to do it but he doesn't want to
S0641	he just keep say oh don't wanna go down there i don't wanna fall off
S0617	well same with you you
S0617	oh god
S0641	bite of a lunatic i be aren't i
S0617	here we go again
S0641	adrenalin junkie yeah but you're gonna you need to push yourself don't you and go fast and yeah there's a chance you might fall off but you're not gonna kill yourself be you so he say famous last word
S0617	you just need to be careful
S0641	bite dry these aren't they be nicer if they have some cheese
S0617	yeah cheese would be good
S0641	and salad
S0617	be tonight or tomorrow then
S0641	erm i think so
S0617	huh
S0641	i think so yeah i think sometimes prefer it when it's a bite more intimate when there's less of us
S0617	yeah
S0641	cos when there's a lot of us it can get quite crowd
S0617	yeah
S0641	you don't talk all at you talk in group don't you you end up talk to the one or two people close to or they have this sort of four or five of you on a wednesday everyone's involve in the same conversation which be good
S0617	yeah
S0641	any more than that and you start
S0641	disperse off into different group
S0617	yeah
S0641	and 's not a big drinker either so he's quite get pretty rip for that
S0617	cos he probably what
S0641	he's not a big drinker so he doesn't drink pints at all so
S0617	no
S0641	i think he feel a bite intimidate on er these sort of sessions
S0617	hasn't why why would but if you be if they be your proper friends then surely you wouldn't feel intimidate like you don't drink but you just kind of drink load because they're drink load that's not who you be that's why it's just weird like i don't know
S0641	intimidate be the wrong word then it's just peer pressure i guess it's it's
S0617	yeah
S0641	just be with the lads it's like a big occasion
S0617	yeah but i guess again
S0641	it's like if imagine it be one of your friend's birthday like be you come out be you drink and you're like no they'd be like oh that's a bite bore isn't it
S0617	mm
S0641	cos it's hype up to be such a big occasion it's like come on have a pint but i agree i think erm it be funny in england isn't it if you don't drink it almost seem a bad thing
S0617	yeah
S0641	which be
S0617	like you and don't drink
S0641	but we'll come in and 's dad'll be like you not drink you so and so it's because all lads be like it aren't they but it's
S0617	mm it's a weird
S0641	imagine if i say what you don't do drug you loser people would be like oh that's a bite so drink it's not exactly good for you
S0617	no no
S0641	yeah i'm just say if you don't like a drink if you you don't
S0617	drink be just see as more sociable isn't it
S0641	but it's not good it's bad for you
S0617	no mm
S0641	and it's socialist without a drink it's just weird isn't it
S0617	yeah no i totally agree that's what i'm say to you
S0641	mm but i don't i enjoy a few pints
S0617	yeah
S0641	erm
S0617	but you don't get wreck that's not who you be it's not
S0641	i do sometimes
S0617	mm very rarely
S0641	yeah very rarely if it's like a big occasion i'll i'll drink i don't drink to get drink but if it's an all night thing it's inevitable isn't it just happen
S0617	huh
S0641	happen i'll ring you at two be to fetch me mm
S0617	you be careful
S0641	also i think uni like yours where you drink and
S0641	binge drink yeah yeah i'm look forward to it
S0617	the pub
S0641	so what's your plan on sunday you cook for your mum
S0617	yeah i be mean to call back actually
S0641	what you cook
S0617	beef i think
S0641	beef dinner
S0617	mm
S0641	roast dinner
S0617	mm
S0641	ooh
S0617	dauphinoise potatoes
S0641	what potatoes
S0617	dauphinoise
S0641	nice
S0617	ask if i be gonna go to the shop with her tonight
S0641	what for to ingredients
S0617	yeah for sunday i say
S0641	be that really necessary
S0617	no i'm i'm only just leave work
S0641	well for leisure yeah well i've say i'll cook for my one as well but eat meat say yeah you can cook meat if you want but then i'm like just but do you actually want meat then she hasn't really give me any suggestions of what she want so all i've be tell be yeah maybe something with salmon or say she doesn't mind either way and have you ever hear of hello fresh it's the company that erm they do new recipes each week and then er they send the recipes out to you the ingredients
S0617	oh
S0641	so it's like a it's a set meal plan so you'll say oh yeah this week on the menu jamie oliver be erm in partnership with them so some of them be jamie oliver recipes
S0617	that's cool
S0641	but you know if you look at a recipe online you'd be like you need crème fraîche obviously you only need two spoonfuls of crème fraîche you don't need the whole pot do you
S0617	no
S0641	and the same for a bite of coriander or
S0617	oh
S0641	so this give you the right potion for that meal it give you all the ingredients you just cook it and within twenty minutes or thirty minutes
S0617	no waste
S0641	yeah and i think it's reasonably price 's mum's use them before and i've have one before they're quite nice but it change each week and it's nice things
S0617	mm
S0641	erm so she's think of do that but there's a veggie one and then like a non veggie one she be gonna go for the non veggie one but i think she's decide to go for the veggie one
S0617	why have you
S0641	i mean she's like
S0617	speak to her
S0641	no no she just like the look of the recipe more the recipes
S0617	mm
S0641	i'm not really sure if she be or isn't to be honest
S0617	mm
S0641	she eat what she want she bring some bacon back the other day mm
S0617	oh well let her let her be so her ring's there
S0641	mm i'll transfer the money
S0617	it's alright i think it be forty quid
S0641	be it
S0617	good isn't it
S0641	mm
S0617	from seventy five
S0641	very good
S0617	i think i don't know
S0641	shall i put twenty and then just get to put twenty do i tell you i have a phone call from say she'd spend thirty quid on some sort of jewellery for her cos my mum say to me she want this ring but she hadn't speak to so he's obviously go out and get something it's typical of mum that be she's so lay back and lackadaisical about everything isn't she
S0617	she'll lose that
S0641	do you reckon
S0617	yeah
S0641	she'll wear it for a few months
S0617	and then lose it
S0641	mm yeah
S0617	which be annoy
S0641	yeah well 's on that tablet
S0617	oh yeah
S0641	she's go out with erm tonight for a meal just them two it's weird isn't it
S0617	yeah
S0641	she ring me yesterday actually and she say er do you send parcel i'm like yes
S0617	what's one of them
S0641	right cos i know she be obviously just get onto something and she
S0617	yeah for him
S0641	and then she's like 's ask me if you could send some parcel for him on a weekly basis
S0617	what
S0641	and i be like right no first of all she say what courier do you use and i say well it depend do you mean domestic do you mean export do you mean small parcel big parcel we obviously we use load of different couriers and er she be like oh okay can you can you send some for him on a weekly basis i be like what what for money like
S0617	yeah
S0641	some sort and she's like no
S0617	what
S0641	i think right well no then really
S0617	yeah
S0641	and then she have someone at the door at work so she have to she say oh okay i just text her back say tell him i use this website for domestic parcel within the uk over two kilograms be the best the the the most competitive price wise and they're pretty efficient they're good never have a bad experience so yeah to use that and then i text her again say i'm not gonna commit myself to be at the warehouse at a certain time each week for his collections and then also have his parcel take up space in my warehouse for no monetary gain i won't do that i'm not a charity i don't even know the guy
S0617	and what do she say
S0641	she put she text me back something like okay fair enough just ask i think maybe he could help you out in the future kind of i scratch his back he scratch mine sort of thing i do him a favour he might be able to do me favour in the future but i be think i don't really need favour at the moment what's he get to give me it's just it's just weird
S0617	it seem a bite weird
S0641	yeah like i
S0617	he yeah but he i feel like he walk a little bite all over your mum like what's what's he go out for dinner with her for
S0641	well
S0617	like
S0641	she she enjoy it so
S0617	yeah i know but er he he now know that she doesn't wanna be just friends she's admit that to all of us and that just doesn't go away
S0641	no
S0617	that doesn't go away
S0641	no
S0617	and he know that he know that you she tell you that you tell me that so we all know
S0641	yeah
S0617	and i think the way that he then still take her out for dinner cos obviously your mum's gonna say no i don't wanna speak to you to start with but then cos if you like somebody you'll let them in won't you and you'll cos that's what
S0641	yeah
S0617	that's what it's all about and like you're a fool
S0641	i think she's she obviously enjoy have him there
S0617	yeah
S0641	than not at all
S0617	but again i think it's really bad
S0641	even if it's friends
S0617	on his behalf then i think
S0641	yeah but if they're both enjoy it doesn't mean so what
S0617	no yeah i know but i think he just walk a little bite all over your mum i don't know i don't think it's very i don't think it's very right i think
S0641	but at least she know what she's get he's be honest hasn't he well he probably wasn't that honest
S0617	i doubt he be
S0641	i dunno it's i don't
S0617	no i know
S0641	i don't know the ins and out and
S0617	i know but i just think that's what that's my opinion on it
S0641	but my mum's not exactly be hundred percent commit to him anyway she's be
S0617	yeah i know but when she be get upset about it all
S0641	she do get quite upset about it yeah
S0617	i think i dunno i just think it's you're put yourself out there aren't you but yet he quite rightly doesn't wanna be with her in that way
S0641	obviously not
S0617	so
S0641	well maybe he do maybe he's just unsure god know my mum's excuse for him be he's just come out of he only recently split up with his wife
S0617	mm that's all a bite dodgy to me
S0641	he's get two young children mm but i think he's a bite seedy a bite dodgy how keep ask like
S0617	yeah
S0641	it there's definitely a hide agenda there
S0617	yeah again like you've just tell me there again it's just that's a light bulb in my head he's do it's just weird you wouldn't do that like why have he ask your mum for you to send parcel for him
S0641	he doesn't know anything about me
S0617	what why
S0641	obviously my mum probably bigs me up but
S0617	why
S0641	but remember like a few months ago he he say i'd like to meet up with your boy
S0617	yeah
S0641	and just have some
S0617	yeah
S0641	ideas from him
S0617	weird
S0641	and have some
S0617	weird
S0641	it's almost like he's look for an idea to steal or
S0617	weird
S0641	it's definitely isn't it
S0617	yeah babe
S0641	will he send some parcel that's just an excuse to come along and look at my unit
S0641	and see what i'm up to isn't it
S0617	mm hm hundred percent it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work that out
S0641	he's a businessman at the end of the day he want to make money he's get
S0617	of course
S0641	kid to fee and
S0617	yeah
S0641	he doesn't care about me
S0617	no
S0641	will you send a few parcel for me
S0617	bad isn't it
S0641	it's just thing be though i think my mum's very naïve about it but i can see straight through it
S0617	but then again i'm quite naïve but i can see straight through that
S0641	but you can i suppose a lot of businessmen do like to network and i suppose if you do have a good team of
S0641	friends and you can help each other but
S0617	this this
S0641	why me
S0617	this isn't
S0641	he doesn't know anything about me
S0617	this isn't friends
S0641	i'm not a million pound businessman be i
S0617	you're not friends no you're not friends be you
S0641	i've never meet him
S0617	you've never ever meet the guy before so why on earth do he want you to send his parcel
S0641	weird
S0617	exactly so
S0641	cos it's so easy to do
S0617	so he can come to your warehouse
S0641	see what see what i'm up to
S0617	and so he can see what you're do and so he can start take ideas that's all it be
S0641	reckon he want to get in or something he's he just want to get involve in something doesn't he
S0617	and i think it's really bad again that he's go through your mum i think it's awful do you not think because again your mum's so lovely and doesn't he know that
S0641	yeah
S0617	doesn't he know that
S0641	yeah
S0617	so he know that your mum's obviously gonna then ask you and try and
S0641	yeah
S0617	he know that
S0641	i might just say to mum
S0617	and then didn't she she's buy him stuff in the past like i know he do stuff for her but what be all that about him use the car and him use this and she have stuff in the land for him not so long ago and stuff from school
S0641	yeah she's have a printer for him and she's
S0617	stuff from school for him
S0641	apparently he help her out just as much apparently
S0617	with what
S0641	i dunno
S0617	be there as a friend i dunno i don't like i don't know i don't like i can't really have an opinion cos i don't know him
S0641	reckon he's just get a load of women that do a load of stuff for him
S0617	i think
S0641	do you reckon he's get three of my mum
S0617	i think be much better than that
S0641	i don't know he get her a really nice christmas present and he he take her out he do
S0617	yeah
S0641	treat her well
S0617	yeah

S0617	yeah
S0641	who know but i i think my mum be a bite naïve so i think she tell him like like probably tell him quite a bite about what i do but i've say you know he's not interest in that he's not interest you know he's get his own things to worry about if i find out he be do something that be make lot of money i would want a thousand percent to get involve not with him but i'd start do it
S0617	course you would
S0641	if i find out your neighbour be do something i'd do it
S0617	would you
S0641	if i find out
S0617	i think that's just that's just be a human though surely everybody's get that instinct
S0641	yeah
S0641	but it's like 's dad
S0617	mm
S0641	he come to our unit
S0617	mm
S0641	a couple of months ago in fact he's actually tell us about this quite a few time but his girlfriend who he's be with for maybe five years now

S0617	mm
S0641	her dad be it or uncle someone in her family sell toilet roll
S0617	toilet roll
S0641	yeah import load and load of toilet roll from china
S0617	mm
S0641	make an absolute kill on it apparently like he's
S0641	he's get his porsche he live in dubai and the first thing he say to be get your do do why don't you start do that have a look into it and that's his that's his girlfriend's family doesn't take far for people to think well yeah i'll do that those people that be your friends like it wouldn't if if i find that be do something that be really good i'd start do it
S0617	good riddance
S0641	i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't have any loyalty to him
S0617	good riddance
S0641	yes i would it sound as harsh as it sound if if some of my close mat be do something i wouldn't start do it i wouldn't tread on or or obviously but much further than that and you just do don't you it doesn't they're nothing to me so yeah it's a bite of a weird one thank for come to see my dad yesterday by the way
S0617	that's alright
S0641	wasn't too bad be it
S0617	no i can't make your dad out
S0641	mm
S0617	do you get what i mean when i say that
S0641	you think he's quite a complex character do you
S0617	mm do you think so
S0641	erm i understand him a bite more but yeah
S0617	can you see why i think that
S0641	do you almost see him as just like a bore typical man but then he's get this sort of bite of a sharp side to him and then also he's get a bite of a fun side to him as well and he love love his bike you see all the extra mods he's have do to it
S0617	mm
S0641	there's like a big twin exhaust put on he's have an air filter on and it make it louder and faster
S0617	but again to me that's like the opposite to isn't it
S0641	yeah yeah but i like that sort of stuff and that that's no you be it
S0617	mm i be gonna say it would be the opposite to as well isn't it

S0617	he do it
S0641	yeah about three time
S0617	yeah
S0641	like the lads all in favour of finish aye
S0617	be that the day that like have a go at him
S0641	yeah it's horrendous i dunno he's it's routine he's so needy and she's she purely be the easy option i know it sound that's the reason
S0617	yeah but
S0641	she's an easy option
S0617	come on
S0641	she give him such a hard time
S0622	come on he need to just grow that backbone now and just be on his own for a bite because he can't be with her for the rest of his life he's twenty four now
S0641	yeah
S0617	he's gonna be twenty five this year he need to sort himself out
S0641	yeah i've i've say openly i've say
S0617	honestly
S0641	i think you should in the like i there's not really a nice way of say it but get rid
S0617	you like do see himself with
S0641	no i don't think he do
S0617	what the hell's he do then what's he do
S0641	i think he's because he's be with her that long he know
S0617	why be they mess around at this age
S0641	he know no different he think oh maybe it's just part of our relationship that we argue maybe it's just
S0617	normal
S0641	it's just part it maybe it's just she's a bite fiery like that's just maybe i'd be bore if it wasn't like that
S0617	mm
S0641	horrendous
S0617	it do easy
S0641	put the phone down on him and put pressure on him and horrendous but two weeks and she's they didn't see each because she be moody cos he have to go to work it's obscene isn't it
S0617	like i be say to you if she have a career that she be really interest in she'd understand that more and if she have something where she be an important position somewhere then she'd understand that more cos he's obviously a very important position in your
S0641	mm hm
S0617	just like you be so it's it's erm
S0641	she's just selfish she doesn't she have no she completely disregard anyone else their opinion and just just them in general doesn't care she doesn't care the consequences of anyone else
S0641	like and his mum go to the airport didn't care it be about her
S0617	yeah yeah then again this be where be right isn't it
S0641	mm hm
S0617	when do she sit down with him
S0641	i think she say it a few weeks ago maybe i'm not sure
S0617	before they go on holiday
S0641	i'm not sure when it be say but be tell me yeah
S0617	what just when he get back
S0641	yeah yeah
S0617	and you know when he be tell you that do he agree with what
S0641	yeah i think he know it
S0617	that he's
S0641	he i dunno why he's there's something keep him there obviously she must be unreal in bed or something
S0641	yeah she must be get something right
S0617	what though
S0641	god know
S0617	cos they're both so unhappy
S0641	i think so i think she's unhappy as well really
S0617	but you you can see that you can see that
S0641	yeah
S0617	and even when we go to london
S0641	that be but i think that be their his excuse be that it be like their roughest patch who'd go through
S0617	yeah but
S0641	what's the point
S0617	yeah but again
S0641	of struggle through it
S0617	yeah if you have a rough patch like that then i i dunno like yeah you'll have one or two like but you don't have them constantly
S0641	no and not for months
S0617	and that be terrible the way that they be at that oh god i'll never forget that
S0641	they'll stay together until one of them find out that the other one's cheat
S0617	well i dunno cos you say that would never cheat on change your mind now aren't you
S0641	think they'll be force to but then he say oh you know be and she adore me it's just nice she love me so much it's er
S0617	oh god it's all
S0641	she's so supportive
S0617	put on isn't it
S0641	i think no she's not
S0617	for the time be
S0641	it's purely from a convenience
S0617	but then doesn't doesn't it annoy you like if he come in and start talk and like moan about her
S0641	he's not mm
S0617	do it annoy you
S0641	er
S0617	cos that would annoy me if i'd have my say or and i say look like like you basically tell him like what be you do
S0641	he's an askhole in that he never take
S0617	he's a what
S0641	askhole
S0617	what's an askhole
S0641	someone that ask for your opinion but never take it anyway
S0617	oh i think it be like say bite of an asshole
S0641	yeah askhole it's a combination of the two
S0617	oh
S0641	so yeah he ask for everyone's advice but he already know what he want to do anyway and ignore everyone's advice
S0617	be that what he's like
S0641	that be completely
S0617	mm and what's the point then

S0622	oh
S0641	bite of a
S0622	just a bodge job
S0641	yes
S0622	oh
S0641	it taste okay though we eat it all
S0622	very good okay
S0641	eat about four wrap afterwards as well
S0617	i didn't i have one
S0622	one big one
S0641	yeah
S0641	yeah be you er at work tomorrow do you want me to move my car
S0622	i'm not go to work
S0641	oh okay fine
S0622	might be
S0641	yeah she's on the late tomorrow so
S0622	oh a late tomorrow yeah
S0641	i assume i'd be up at seven o'clock to take her to the train station but it's a pleasant surprise that i won't be
S0622	that's good news
S0641	yeah get me into a bite of a routine
S0622	have a bite of a disaster today
S0641	yes
S0617	yeah
S0622	next time you just walk back in and get the car to
S0617	yeah there's no point like i say i just kind of assume i'd get on a coach but like you say after i speak to you and you say it take hours it's a good job i didn't but the coach they didn't their answer be we don't know when the first train's gonna be and we don't actually know when the train's when the coach be come there be load of people in all shove in that little
S0641	i can imagine
S0617	mm
S0641	that's horrendous isn't it
S0617	all school kid
S0641	should be compensation
S0622	i would imagine that er
S0617	we cos i get on the train with all the school kid
S0622	yeah i imagine the stock answer be yeah we're gonna arrange a coach but it won't be it's never when they say they're gonna be it's like
S0641	mm
S0622	three hours later
S0641	well i suppose they have to
S0622	by which time the train's back on so
S0641	yeah
S0622	they haven't get a coach on demand they have a coach like they can get in a few hours so it take an age to get round all the station anyway so it's a bite of a waste of
S0641	yeah oh yeah cos they have to stop off at every station let people off
S0622	well pretty much i've do it before but it take an an age if but if the line be down and the track be inoperable then yeah it's the only option to get home sometimes
S0641	mm
S0622	well for me it be unless you get a taxi and then in which case you bite the bullet and
S0641	yeah
S0622	you use to be able to get compensation i wonder whether there's any
S0641	it's probably a really lengthy process isn't it
S0622	probably have to be er so many hours wait or so many days out or whatever i don't i don't
S0641	you're not so you'll probably struggle on that one
S0617	mm
S0641	remember when er when we er first part of the train line be close off for maintenance and they have a coach but it be quite efficient wasn't it
S0617	yeah yeah
S0641	as soon as you get off the train
S0622	yeah because they er
S0641	they anticipate it it's
S0622	yeah the they plan for that
S0617	mm
S0622	the coach whereas i presume today get up in the morning and er
S0641	it's all mess up
S0622	soon as they realise it the train be not gonna work
S0617	so how come they're not work what what why what make them not work
S0622	well there's well i dunno a breakdown of the train a breakdown
S0617	train man over here
S0622	that's the usual one as soon as the train stop
S0617	signal
S0622	and then they have to move that train to get there so they have to get another train out to move that train out of the way push it to the one side somewhere and then and then
S0617	they're talk a lot about
S0622	and then the service can resume
S0617	signal
S0622	and the if the signal fail they have to get an engine out to look at the signal
S0617	yeah that's what have fail
S0622	signal yeah
S0641	it's better that they're safe
S0622	we've have er we've have tree down on it so that's take the the cable down so that take a day i've have that before
S0617	yeah
S0622	or or even just tree on the track you know
S0622	big big erm or then another where erm you know er you know railway a a bridge and then over a road and then a a lorry go into the bridge so they have to go and get the
S0622	get a a risk assessment of the bridge and make sure it's safe and that sort of thing and that take
S0641	yeah
S0622	okay if that happen
S0617	hours
S0622	then well then you're then they wouldn't go over the bridge er obviously for safety reason you know if the bridge collapse with the the
S0641	yeah
S0622	weight of the train they'd have to er get it check out or mend the bridge and that could take a day or two at least but er other reason there be lot of things that could happen but er yeah it's not every often but er obviously you draw the short straw today
S0641	do you know what i google the other day i google how many suicides there be in the uk in term of
S0622	do you
S0641	er
S0622	what you be feel a bite morbid where you
S0641	in front of train
S0617	why
S0641	i be i be intrigue i dunno why
S0622	oh yes yeah i
S0641	there's be about
S0622	what do you wake up and think oh i wonder how many
S0641	yeah yeah quite an unpleasant think
S0617	yeah
S0641	i dunno i think that you
S0617	happy days
S0641	you must have be get the train and that make me think of japan and i be remember talk to think i wonder how many people actually do do that and it's er there's about three hundred and forty a year in the uk alone
S0622	right
S0641	that's like one every day almost someone jump in front of a train i think that's it be on the erm i think it be on the national rail website i think the procedure be for them obviously the train driver have to swap that's pretty traumatic for them
S0617	oh my life
S0641	yeah crazy innit about three hundred and forty a year
S0641	one a day it's horrible isn't it so they must have a pretty routine response for it it must kind of
S0622	right yeah
S0641	cos in japan they be efficient they know exactly what they be do didn't they
S0617	oh yeah
S0622	right yeah yeah
S0641	they they'd clean it up within
S0641	a couple of hours and they have all
S0617	oh it be quicker than that
S0641	the public
S0641	yeah the public didn't say anything they have their erm
S0617	tent
S0641	massive sheet and
S0622	to hide it yeah away away from people
S0641	yeah can't believe it's
S0617	yeah
S0641	so high in the uk that's crazy isn't it that
S0617	yeah it be weird
S0622	it be quite a lot
S0617	one a day
S0641	isn't it isn't it the biggest killer between the age of twenty to thirty though suicide
S0622	i don't know
S0617	i wouldn't know that no
S0641	mm
S0622	yeah yeah i dunno
S0641	well that could have be the reason
S0641	the train be delay
S0622	that's your next project google the sort of the er reason for deaths between different age group
S0641	yes
S0622	report back
S0641	uncooked quesadillas
S0622	yeah yeah food poison from
S0617	oh don't say that mum's already make a joke about food poison
S0622	oh that be it yeah
S0617	i say my day's
S0617	go bad to worse
S0617	she's like oh don't go next thing you know you'll have food poison from your dinner
S0622	mm
S0641	oh nice
S0617	it's probably why i be so worry about the chicken
S0641	it'll be fine i'm quite a good cook
S0617	and then you've just speak about food poison
S0622	mm
S0617	oh god
S0641	and then she get a park ticket as well just to top it all off
S0622	mm oh you'll that's fine must be something er where you can go and er prove take a picture of your receipt and all that sort of thing
S0617	haven't get a receipt
S0622	well it's on your phone isn't it
S0641	it's on your phone isn't it
S0617	yeah
S0622	that's what i mean didn't tell you how to er
S0641	make sure they've get better systems in place for
S0617	oh that's what i be say
S0641	for traffic warden and
S0617	i'm so annoy at them
S0641	cos surely it's do be that the only mean of get a ticket by texting
S0617	no you could
S0622	might not be
S0617	you could put you could put coin in but only coin you i have note but i couldn't put the note in cos there be no
S0641	so you know when you get the text say thank you for do you
S0617	i have
S0641	do it say you've gotta display anything
S0622	it'll be display
S0617	what's my number plate
S0622	it's on the phone
S0641	oh that's why what have you put
S0617	m
S0622	m mother
S0641	oh yeah it's your own stupid fault then isn't it
S0617	shit
S0622	oh that's why they haven't match it up then they do it
S0622	they'll do an electronic match won't they
S0641	you've get n haven't you
S0641	n for november
S0622	oh
S0617	but i be look at it when i say that but it must have be my erm
S0622	type
S0617	accent or something no i say it on the phone like
S0622	oh right okay oh well
S0641	oh yeah
S0617	but it be an automate thing i say
S0641	do it not confirm do it not say
S0617	no but then i should have read that cos i get that straight away
S0622	no but they can he but the
S0617	and it say park in zone two eight eight six from
S0622	right so that's why you've get one of those but the that
S0617	you've be charge ten pound forty
S0622	right that's which be fine
S0641	they're go to know that it's your car though
S0617	but it i say like they ask me what car it be a mercedes what it be white all the things he's write down there they ask me
S0622	well yeah well apart from the end yeah no that's fine so all that's happen he's er er
S0622	he will have check you presumably that you you'd er telephone
S0617	so it's my own fault actually
S0622	yeah well it's no it's it's er you'll get out of it because that's a
S0641	it's an automate system
S0622	that that's er that that's an automate system and erm voice recognition which have just go towards the n rather than the m
S0617	how be the fine by the way do you know
S0622	i dunno
S0617	it doesn't actually say on there
S0641	be it sixty but if you don't if you pay it soon it halve
S0617	like my bus lane
S0641	it'll be similar
S0617	thirty quid
S0641	to the bus lane if you pay it on time
S0622	pay this what's that i i can't read it without my glass fifteen 0 seven fifteen seventeen so he's come in the afternoon have he the fourth of the third
S0617	what
S0622	i just well he er dunno if this be the time he come along in which case the obviously you would have register that
S0641	he's probably get a target to hit saw your mistake know that it be a mistake but think no
S0622	no i i reckon he put would wouldn't he have a machine and he he put the registration in
S0641	didn't match up
S0622	and if and if it didn't match then cos then it it wouldn't even show that she'd she'd put
S0641	probably
S0622	they'd just be
S0641	cos otherwise
S0622	you know just look through a list of all list of which would take a years he wouldn't even er
S0641	probably just scan yeah probably just scan doesn't it doesn't matter
S0622	or yeah take
S0641	or on a computer
S0622	and he do a check and he can't find the so therefore it
S0617	yeah
S0622	but it it's it's
S0617	there's me
S0622	it's
S0617	rant my bloody fault in the first place
S0622	so so that's the reason so that's that's actually quite good because you can er that's er that's er explain why they've
S0617	yeah
S0622	give you a ticket so that mean you can er you can er go back to them and plead er
S0617	when do
S0622	you know that actually
S0617	they're not open till monday i don't think
S0622	well it doesn't matter
S0617	it's just annoy i'm open saturday and sunday why be no one else
S0617	i be
S0641	i know you be i'm not
S0622	i don't know what you'll probably have it'll be to respond to this anyway at least anyway you'll have to read it and make sure you're in time and that sort of thing you don't what you don't wanna do be additional comeback and all that sort of thing there's a number to ring here as well
S0641	except premium rate probably spend fifty pound try to call
S0622	well yes
