S0326	what you just sit there
S0383	you just sit there there's not even a screen even you just sort of like sit on the motorbike and don't go anywhere it's like a motorbike on treadmill basically it's pretty shit i go to on friday
S0383	and none of the machine work in the arcades but they don't put out of order things on them and i be like i
S0328	it's well out of order
S0383	it's well out of order and i complain cos i'm like in to complain these days i've like turn and basically i buy an ice cream the other day and it be really nice
S0328	and didn't want it
S0383	yeah no i didn't and my friend get the same ice cream and get load of pistachios on it and i moan and they overhear me moan and they're like do you have a problem i i like really i be like that's really unfair you get load more pistachios and then the guy be like do you want more pistachios i'm like yeah and he buy me another ice cream with load more pistachios on it and then i get the bill and he charge me for two ice cream this be such a bore story
S0328	he charge you for two ice cream
S0383	yeah and they be like seven pound each so i like complain and then he give me another free ice cream and i be like
S0326	so you get you get two you pay for two and you get three
S0383	i pay for one and i get three
S0326	oh
S0383	and load of pistachios so then i be complain totally work so i complain about the arcades
S0328	where where be you
S0383	at
S0383	their ice cream be really good cardamom and saffron flavour solid
S0328	erm yeah also if you get if you if you like and get fire then you get load of money
S0383	really
S0328	well like cos obviously his staff be like totally take it it be quite funny actually like i'll make it a short story but she she he have this member of staff work who be always always always stitch him up like come in late not show up and like sort of lie about it to get out of shift and stuff and then the she's she's and stuff anyway so she want to get out of the shift and she be like no you know like i email you about it and he's like okay i haven't get it but if you forward me the email then like fair enough so like a day later she forward him this email it's like obviously be doctor and really badly like she forward to herself and then edit it and then forward it and then be like yeah see here i write this but like she'd do it in a way that totally leave this like clear evidence of what she'd do you know
S0383	yeah
S0328	she didn't change it in any way but the main thing that she do wrong just cos it be like suppose to have be in january like twenty twenty ninth or she forward the email to herself to change it on twenty sixth of february so she change it to twenty ninth but leave it as february and so it be like twenty ninth of february which actually doesn't exist
S0328	he be like
S0383	hasn't happen yet
S0328	no cos it's like a leap year it's like the one so it actually doesn't exist
S0383	oh oh it actually doesn't exist
S0328	it's like so i get this email that you send either three years in the past or when you're in the future but either way like it didn't come through yeah anyway so he be like look we be like you can't have the shift off and like you've obviously send me this like really awful lie like she didn't say anything she didn't go to work to the shift and then and then he message her like cos of that you're fire she be like you know long time come wasn't it anyway so she's get a lawyer and be like unfair dismissal and now he have to pay her like severance and like it's in the eye of the law like she's in the right no matter what cos you have to do a write verbal warn write warn
S0326	physical warn
S0328	not matter what physical warn erm so anyway
S0326	you have to do a warn can you do like a write warn and then like just ten minutes later fire them
S0328	i don't think so i think i don't know actually i don't know bite there's a definite like clear thing that you have to do and he didn't do it so
S0383	what so then he
S0328	so then she win man he have to pay her stiff
S0383	how much
S0328	well it's like they're close the restaurant in three weeks anyway so it's like the rest of the shift that she would have do
S0383	oh be it at thingy
S0328	railroad yeah so that's three weeks' worth of work erm and then i think you have to do like severance pay so he reckon about six hundred quid could be worse but like also suck just to have to give it to her she's like but anyway
S0383	what a dick for actually pursue it as well
S0328	be like so you just have to get a job and then you get fire and then you'll get severance
S0326	plan sort
S0383	i'm sure like you know when like mad like people in really urban corporations get like fire cos they're like fuck prostitute and then they get like two million pound severance i'm sure people just do that on purpose
S0328	hard to get another job then though
S0383	don't need it when you get get like
S0328	you have to open a street food van or something maybe a hotdog van sell hotdogs i once hear the best erm like announcer on the train it be like the lady be like maybe she be erm but she she she be like talk about what they have in their erm the in the snack cart and she be like and today we have special get one sandwich get one kit kat free lucky
S0326	lucky
S0328	everyone's a winner on this train
S0383	mm
S0328	we go we have dinner at yesterday
S0383	
S0328	at railroad
S0383	haven't they move to
S0328	no he hasn't he's still base in here but he's always like work in the
S0383	what be he say
S0328	just say
S0326	he say that he's a green man now
S0328	he's a green man now so what don't you have that turn of phrase here
S0328	unless you mean alien no erm but basically he's have this like thing ever since i've know him but i think even longer like he get really really stitch by his agency with like you know how they send your book out and whatever you wrap up like a debt to them
S0383	oh yeah
S0328	he be earn a shit ton of money and then he be like you know can i have some money back and they be like no you owe us like a hundred and fifty thousand pound he's like what i've be like do like really well for age for years
S0326	money
S0328	and they're like no no no you owe us load of money so he be work really hard do load of like campaign and shit to the trade farers and then like when i get back from which this be like a year ago he be like go to me he be like okay he be like finally clear the hundred and fifty grand loan he be he go to them and be like really expect they'd be like okay cool like champagne like you know and that and they're like no no no like in the mean in that time you you've owe us another like seventeen thousand pound they spend money on his behalf you know
S0383	yeah
S0328	so anyway they've get him right by the ball by the shackle and arm you know and
S0383	by the shackle and arm
S0328	by the shackle and arm yeah
S0326	by the ball single ball
S0328	yeah ball
S0328	and then he's finally clear it now so apparently in like they do a green man who isn't green or whatever it's like no we don't have that
S0383	yeah to invest there the ones like agents be so fuck retard i deal with them every day and like they lose their like clients so much work just
S0328	really
S0383	yeah like one the other day we be like offer them like i can't remember what it be oh yeah it be like topshop campaign so they pay like fifteen thousand quid like no sorry he's go blah blah and then phone up the day before and be like sorry i fuck up erm obviously he'd actually obviously didn't put someone else there it's like you've just lose that person fifty grand and they always like they spend so much money like we do it as well we spend so much money on like shit the amount of shit that i buy on other people's job
S0328	yeah
S0383	but it's also like you kind of balance it out though it's kind of fair like the way we do it cos like we put like load of money on like corporate job so then like when we work with photographer so say if if we work with
S0326	it's sunnier now
S0383	like we do all this editorial stuff for him but like pay for it and like so he doesn't have to pay anything to use that portfolio
S0328	that's what that's what they be say like i think that's what the
S0383	yeah but agents don't do that production company do that
S0328	i think that they they be cover for like editorial but they be charge him for it cos they be like oh when you want that thing like and we sort it out for you this be how much it cost but they never tell him that you know they be spend this money on his behalf erm
S0326	yeah
S0383	it be amaze the amount of money the amount of shit we buy and just charge random people but i kind of like
S0328	like like the cold presser
S0383	yeah like the cold press but we lay we we lay
S0328	press
S0383	a pink carpet across the entire office which cost two thousand pound to get fit and then buy the carpet on another job cos we have to get carpet for this other job it be aws some like fashion chain
S0328	when you say you be get a pink carpet i mean i think you mean like a red carpet like for her birthday just lay down a pink carpet
S0383	oh no no we've get like a pink carpet actually
S0328	yeah you need a pink cake get a pink
S0383	yeah get a pink lamborghini pink limo erm
S0328	that's so naughty how do you pretend that's part of the job the carpet

S0328	oh i see
S0383	you steal from your stuff from those people
S0326	that's right you
S0383	you steal from those people and then like

S0383	i dunno there's a witchcraft museum that's in a mine
S0328	where's that
S0383	cornwall the witchcraft museum
S0328	be it any good
S0383	never be i've be to the it's pretty good pretty magical
S0328	pretty magical
S0383	pretty pretty magical
S0326	how long do you think it take to learn to drive
S0383	age
S0328	like think he seem like he think he can go everything half time like there be like a course like horse rid course
S0326	i didn't think that
S0328	it's like it's like a week it's like a week in like or wherever to learn how to do horse rid it's like two hundred and ninety five quid or whatever he's like what about for smart people have you go a one hour one for smart people what if you're smart
S0328	so i'll take that one fifty quid
S0383	d'you know what though horse i learn i can horse ride cos when i be in i just get a horse after twenty minutes you've get to learn to do it else you're fuck he just like put me on a horse and go go and i be like and i just figure it out
S0326	yeah see i think that's what it'll be i think in car might be a bite like that
S0383	i mean you can learn to drive like it's easy to drive but like you have to learn so much shit
S0326	the theory test
S0383	no the theory be easy that's just like common sense
S0326	and it's like when to look in your mirror and like due to have to develop those sort of habit
S0383	yeah it's like no one if i do my drive test now i'd a hundred percent fail there's absolutely no chance in hell
S0326	cos i do a
S0383	cos it's really
S0326	motorbike one and pass that and you've get to do stuff like look in the blind spot every five second
S0383	yeah it's just basically all the stuff you have to do be really like counterintuitive
S0328	you could probably do it do it now when you've get when you're young you can learn things in ten minutes
S0383	yeah but i reckon it would take about six months
S0326	what
S0383	well you do like one lesson a week
S0326	i'd rather do like three a week and do it in like a month
S0328	i want to go to boot camp
S0326	it's a grand though you can definitely do it for cheaper than that
S0383	have a car be the best thing in the world
S0326	exactly that's what i be think
S0383	you can literally
S0328	you you learn to drive i'll get a car
S0326	and then also i can get a bike and have people on the back

S0326	and like i be wake up and i didn't have any hand luggage or anything and i couldn't they be so fat i could literally not like couldn't get the attention of anybody
S0383	you be block in
S0326	and i didn't there be no tv on the plane there all the magazines be in spanish i didn't have a phone i didn't know what time it be but i didn't know how long i'd be on the flight or anything i couldn't work out i be like have nothing to do i didn't know how long it be go to go on for and i be just stick there between all these fat people like star at the back of a plane seat like doesn't that sound bad to you
S0328	yeah that sound awful
S0383	yeah that sound pretty bad
S0328	i have one that be really bad but it be kind of lolzy after a while i have a kind of if you can't beat them join them attitude i be like oh well better to enjoy it where like there be like a couple and they be quite chubs and erm they pull down this like when they get on the flight they like immediately get out this massive like m and s like bag stuff with food and i be like oh sweet they buy food for their whole trip it be like no man they eat it all on the plane it be they be snack like heap heap heap it be so gross they keep offer me it be like no no no thank you cheesy dizzles for me

S0328	all these like weird snack you know and erm anyway the guy have a er ipad and he be play fruit ninja and he he be just sit there do this like the whole trip right and i be like at first he be oh excuse me but they he just didn't get it but he keep get quite high score so he be like ah
S0326	out
S0328	and after a while he be just like i know right after a while i be just like yeah man good good go score yeah you get really good point
S0326	i go i go on a quite bad one to actually because the plane get delay by about four hours when it everyone be already in the gate when it happen the plane get hit by lightning so obviously everybody start tuck into their duty free booze by the like within like an hour people be like smoke in the gate they have to send like arm police to like supervise
S0383	no way
S0326	and like by the time we get on the plane people could barely walk like half the people on the flight be like waste and then they're like just typical like that like when air host be do their like the like how to put on a life jacket stuff all the lads be like heckle her
S0328	oh my god i have a really funny picture there
S0383	be an air host must be the worst job in the world
S0328	i think some people really like it but yeah i agree
S0326	i think it i think it be it's get he's like it's probably get worse
S0383	yeah it use to be like quite glamorous in the seventies
S0326	do you know that guy that
S0328	ryanair people it's just like you work in shop
S0326	my mum's you you that guy
S0328	yeah
S0326	he be talk when he be over once his dad be an air pilot in like the seventies and they use to go to just be like sort of drug sex cos they all get really bore on these like long flight
S0383	yeah
S0326	and he like be base on new zealand or whatever so every flight be long and they use to do stuff just do like load
S0383	that where most pilot train isn't it in australia
S0326	he be in new zealand yeah
S0383	cos there's like load of land to fly over
S0326	they use to do like shit load of smuggle
S0383	really
S0326	like cos they have a have a memory of his mum like sew in the pocket to like stash gold in into the dad's fly jacket and when he put it on he could barely walk cos it be so heavy with gold
S0328	it's like gold line i be on a flight once in erm something happen to this lady like she get sick or whatever but i couldn't quite see but it be like in front of me and em that thing happen which always happen in cartoon where the like air host go on the voice on the voice over and she's like be there a doctor on the plane be there a doctor on the plane
S0383	i've be on a plane where that happen
S0326	i have plane as well
S0328	yeah so then this guy be like er i'm a doctor and like she's like be you and be like go over like i couldn't see exactly what be happen but like he like lean over he's like there for a while and then he go back to his seat and then she go to be there another doctor on the plane
S0328	and some guy be like yeah i'm a doctor it be funny he be able to help
S0326	yeah i might next time someone ask that like me
S0328	be there any more doctor on the plane
S0326	doctor of philosophy
S0328	yeah
S0383	do you do you see that derren brown when he like there be this guy that be terrify of fly and he like it be over a really long period of time and then he like hypnotise him and then he get on the plane and they fake like an emergency on the plane and they hypnotise him not to knock him out and put him in a flight simulator and he have to like land the plane it be really amaze like so they like hypnotise him and then like they're like we need someone to like to land the plane the pilot have die or whatever and no one on the plane volunteer so it get to the point at which he be like i'm gonna have to do it cos everyone on the plane be actors but it be like a real flight and then they hypnotise him knock him out put him in a flight simulator so he genuinely think he be in a a cockpit and like land the plane it be really funny but erm
S0328	and then he wasn't scar of fly any more
S0383	but apparently like he didn't it wasn't to do with like to overcome his fear of fly
S0326	probably just make it worse
S0383	it be just like a tv show
S0328	that's crazy
S0383	have you ever think you be go to die on a plane
S0328	no er a couple of time i've be like er you can you know when it get like and you can erm imagine

S0328	it can just be text that one though
S0383	i just don't know i mean it won't be a lot to do
S0328	just do it just do whatever even if it look shit it's just like it's drive me nut now
S0383	it's just open a whole can of like demand worm
S0328	i wish i haven't like let him give feedback in the first place cos now it's like it's his project and i'm like he's tell me whether it's right or not it's like if you want to do it you should have just do it from the start it's just like
S0383	erm but i i'm go to get up early tomorrow and like do like three page design for that page cos it doesn't to make it's not go to take anything more just to be like click to this click to this but erm that's why i be just like maybe we just keep it as it be so it can get build but
S0328	i tell him that too but he's be
S0326	get things do
S0328	mm
S0383	erm but 's be email you right about like actually like the build
S0328	erm i be just ask about that thing about the
S0383	about the form
S0328	form which seem fine it's just go to go the gmail and then a spreadsheet or something
S0383	cos all of that shit's build anyway but they're not have to rebuild that it's all it's all
S0328	yeah it's fine
S0383	but yeah i'll send you some options for that in the morning and if they
S0328	can't they get go with what you've get while you do that page
S0383	erm
S0328	cos if it's go to be three days we'll just give them everything that's be sign off
S0383	yeah cos what do say say it's go to be three days but
S0328	it's go to be three four days' work and like if it's just the work with us page or whatever can't we just like while we're go it
S0383	yeah i i'll speak to in the morning and just see if they could like what the time
S0328	get on with that other shit
S0383	yeah
S0328	cos it i i'm scar that it won't be three days it'll be like three weeks
S0383	yeah
S0328	well
S0383	but yeah i'll speak to in the morning and get him to do it
S0328	i don't know what to do about my site should i still get to do it or not
S0383	well it's
S0328	cos you've do the design but like nothing else have be do on that so like
S0383	well the guy start it i dunno i i'll update i just
S0328	cos i could just get someone else to do but but i don't know what to do
S0383	let me see where it's at because i think it's like half build it's just like it's just get to be like touch up you know it's just like it's build but it's just like
S0328	really i think nothing have be do on it
S0383	no it's like build to you know it's like you build the framework and then it's just like go back through the code cos you like the way you do it be like you build it and write all the code or whatever and then you'd be like oh that bite doesn't swirl properly you've get to like you know it's like a process of like fix as oppose to like
S0328	yeah
S0383	so i think like that's do and it's just about like work out the bits so it's like yeah it's probably at a stage where you can just get someone else to look at that or but i feel like if we get someone else to work it out it'll just take longer
S0328	yeah
S0383	you know and it they'll be like well that's gonna cost whereas with us it's like i'm just like you have to finish this
S0383	do and like i can't wait to be able to lose my shit on him he's
S0328	where do you meet him
S0383	you know my friend there's like his
S0326	how do you how do you find them
S0383	no but it's like i've know him for years but i be never really like friends with him it's like 's wife he's like her old school friend and he be always one of those like cos he use to work at he have like really good job
S0328	he always strike me as a pothead
S0383	yeah he's like he totally be and he's like i tell you he like make load of money buy shit for and stuff like that he's like a bite of a blagger but then he have like a really good job at and a really good job at like some other like 3d motion company but
S0328	what happen to those
S0383	well it's since transpire that actually his friend this guy's be basically like just like a whizz kid at code and he just get the job and 's just like the guy that know a abut about everything but doesn't really do it so he like cling on to me to be like oh yeah you can do the design and cling on to this other guy to be like and it's just like so he doesn't really do anything he's just but he's not even good at that
S0328	yeah
S0383	you know it's like if you're that like you become a project manager and you're like really good at oversee stuff and get like this be the timeline this be
S0328	cos what he really do or what really happen to the whole thing be that it be really badly project manage
S0383	yeah
S0328	i mean that's like what go wrong basically like he just wasn't upfront about things
S0383	yeah yeah because but also basically it's like what really
S0328	didn't really run with it
S0383	yeah and it's just like even stuff it's like i'm like yo have you send that email he's like oh didn't forget to press reply or and it's just like be you fuck retard like
S0328	yeah too stone
S0383	but but also there's just too it's like it would have just be easier if we but also like that's the whole thing it's like it's not like confident put him in a room with like and that you know it's like
S0328	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	but actually that would have be well easier if at the begin we be just like okay guy what do you want and then it's like we'd be at the stage that we've get to now which actually could have get do it two weeks
S0328	yeah but i didn't know he be go to suddenly like have a really really really strong idea about exactly what it be and to be honest i haven't even be look at what he's be say i've just be go yeah yeah fine make you happy but it's it's likely that i wouldn't even agree with him you know that i would have do it differently like i don't know when it become his thing he's not even one of it's just like he's i dunno it's super annoy man i don't know how we've get into this situation where
S0383	i don't know
S0328	's like i'm go to and put at retard like the one bite i do read be like when he change the home page text it be like i'm not say that that's so lame
S0383	no but half the shit as well the thing that's really annoy be like when people propose stuff like maybe this will be a good idea and just be like i want this i want his and that kind of shit you can't be like oh maybe i want this and it's like actually no i want this and
S0328	yeah yeah yeah i know well i i do speak to him
S0383	but again that's like 's but that's like 's shit cos like cos keep you know when's like well we don't have all the stuff so i haven't do it i'm like if you need all the shit tell them that this be what you need
S0328	i tell i be constantly say do you have all the content you need from us and he'd be like oh i need this one thing and that's it and i'd get him the thing and then he'd be like you know but like i be ask that all the time
S0383	that's what i mean like that's why i be try to be like look like if you
S0328	and now i'm like where be it he hasn't even save all the stuff i send him i have to get it again
S0383	yeah but that's what i'm say it's like but also it's like if that be the case you just be like look this be a stage we don't move on to that stage until this stage be complete rather than be like hey we have a bite come in and cos then you're always like it's basically just not commit to something and just be like yeah we'll we'll like make it through like like we've always get an excuse you know it's always like a bite like yeah well we didn't do this because he didn't do that
S0328	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0383	and like de de it's like it doesn't matter if you need that to do that
S0328	should have get it
S0383	get it
S0328	oh man
S0383	it's just fuck tedious process
S0328	anyway what be we go to do to to get him
S0383	well one the thing be i don't want to say anything to him until the site's do until we figure out what's happen with yours
S0328	yeah
S0383	and then like we haven't pay him the second half of this one yet anyway so we're definitely not pay him that
S0328	you should get it
S0383	erm but i just i just don't i want to keep him sweet until we get what we need out of him before we torture him
S0328	break his legs take away his weed take away his like netflix subscription and like delete all the pizza delivery number from his phone
S0383	ruin him
S0328	and what
S0326	what's the
S0383	he he's just
S0328	some reason and i don't know why whenever i do stuff for ybfs it go wrong i'm not i'm good at stuff like you know if i say i'm go to do something i do it like and i do it well like on my own stuff it's like fine i think it's happen before like i do a photo shoot and i get a friend and like somebody who be like i really think be go to be great and he just do like an awful job
S0383	really
S0328	we can never use the photos so for some reason i just things go wrong when i do it for anyone else apart from me almost like
S0326	maybe cos you get your friends to do it
S0328	no like no more than i do in normal thing and like this guy be like it's like somebody always work with and like be really highly recommend and like should have be great he just get it wrong he just fuck it up waste load of people's time waste of money
S0383	yeah
S0328	but also to an extent maybe that's like not be use to work with other people who have opinions any more cos like if it's my thing i just do it i know if it's right if i'm try to please somebody else and like guess what they want then it's like
S0383	that's the thing be that you're constantly second guess
S0328	yeah
S0383	but it's the it's the same shit as like when i be work for that guy in it's like he be the one who have the relations with the client but i be like i be like deliver to him to then i be try to
S0328	yeah
S0383	understand what he want to be the what he want me to deliver to him to deliver to the client rather than him just be like you guy you can speak to the client and then i know what they deliver so it's like i be second guess what he want or be i do something that the client want
S0328	yeah
S0383	cos i know what he's ask for they're not go to want to so it's like
S0328	right yeah that's it er but now i feel like like i feel like 's my client you know what i mean it's like what it's my thing
S0383	but that's the thing it's like as soon as you give people like the ability to exercise
S0328	yeah yeah and i only do that
S0383	that they like they take
S0328	because i like felt guilty cos we miss the deadline and i and i have vouch for it and like it's fine leave it with me i really
S0383	because actually it's the easiest thing to be able to go through something and be like no that need to be like this and this need to be like that like
S0328	cross the things out and then i actually look at what he'd write and i write to him i be like we're not write that on my home page it's fuck retard
S0326	what be it
S0328	ah i don't want to say it out loud man it's just like this like awful like matey language like try to be your mate yeah
S0383	try to be your friend
S0328	try to be your friend
S0326	back of an innocent smoothie
S0328	yeah like innocent smoothie
S0383	i still think that like no age hashtag no age limit be the funniest shit in the world
S0328	that's not on there though
S0383	it be
S0328	where
S0383	i don't know
S0383	it's like hashtag no age limit but also to make that like your twitter handle it's like
S0328	it's not a twitter handle
S0383	it's not a twitter handle but it's a twitter hashtag that would for a while it be on the end of everything hashtag no age limit
S0328	that's probably me write that to be honest
S0383	i know but just like if people like search hashtags for no age limit like the weirdest shit be go to come up it's not go to like
S0328	well if you search ymf you get you're my fabulous that's what that mean
