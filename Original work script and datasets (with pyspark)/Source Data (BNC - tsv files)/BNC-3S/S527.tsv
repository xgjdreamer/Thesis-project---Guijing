S0655	er could you that's
S0653	no don't use the small spoon to scoop up the mixture use the big one okay i would hold fire for a bite and let do his and then you can add yours hang on right pop that one in and i'm gonna get erm a spatula to scrape all the last

S0655	or here
S0653	yeah try not to get it on the side of the bake parchment you want it flat
S0654	i kind of get some
S0653	that's fine cos a small amount occasionally will be fine you don't want too much of in one corner though do you so don't put any more in that bite cos there's a huge amount of black of dark chocolate there don't put any more on that side
S0654	it's not dark mum

S0655	like here
S0653	by all mean do that and we haven't overmixed it it do very much look like a marble cake at the moment doesn't it rather than a big squidgy mess
S0654	there there
S0653	that be
S0654	be that good enough
S0653	lovely don't you think
S0655	mm
S0654	mm beautiful
S0653	very beautiful
S0654	and do we and then do we cook it
S0653	now we're gonna cook it and what will happen be that that lovely pattern
S0654	eww
S0653	i'll give you a wipe in a second i think this be probably be the best marble
S0653	i've ever see of a cake so well do
S0655	include bake off and crème de la crème
S0653	yeah i reckon
S0655	wow
S0653	i think you've do a very very good job there cos it do really look like marble and that pattern will stay in the cake
S0654	oh mum there's bits which be not mix
S0653	no but that's fine because the point of you look at the cake that's er the the one that's bake in the the photograph
S0654	mm
S0653	the marble isn't do all the way through because that will just be too much this be what it look like
S0654	shall we go and wash our hand now
S0653	hang on let erm yeah i'll put it in the oven or do you want to put it in the oven
S0655	mm you can put it in the oven
S0653	i'll put it in the oven okay go wash your hand then
S0653	okay so the cake be cool now and now we're go to need to do part one of the ice don't muck around with the golden syrup so what we need to do be we need to melt the chocolate butter and golden syrup
S0655	that sound tasty
S0653	yeah stand there
S0654	and mum we can just like
S0654	sprinkle these on top
S0653	well first of all we're make a fudge a hot fudge ice
S0653	and honestly it's one of the best ice ever erm but that mean that obviously it be go to be heat so we're go to make it ice sort of melt everything together and then er we'll need to leave it to cool a little bite why do you think we'll need to leave it to cool
S0654	cos if we erm cos if we don't leave it to cool
S0655	it
S0654	then when then when we cut it open it won't be very good cos the all the
S0655	i know why
S0654	cos all the ice would just sink down
S0655	erm it's kind of that but the ice would be too runny
S0653	yes that be the reason why
S0654	mm
S0655	it need to cool down and become a sticky ice not a very very runny one
S0653	yes exactly cos it will be super super super runny
S0654	so how many minutes
S0653	be you quite impatient
S0654	yes
S0653	yes
S0653	and you're desperate to see the bake off as well
S0654	how many minutes
S0653	erm well
S0653	a good ten minutes i would've think
S0655	doh oh
S0654	oh
S0653	i know
S0654	no fair
S0655	mm
S0653	i could i don't really want to put it in the freezer cos it will get off those
S0653	but yes we'll add the chocolate chip when we erm
S0655	so why don't you want to put it in the freezer
S0653	because it will make everything else that touch er it in the freezer defrost that's the only reason why you don't put stuff in freezers normally you know they often do it in bake competitions but that's because there's nothing else in the freezer erm so if i could clear a bite of space we could do that but i'll try not to get it let it get too hot
S0654	yeah cos if it be too hot then er when
S0653	it'll take forever
S0655	yeah
S0654	it will just and also if it's too hot it will become more runny and
S0653	no no it's not if if it's too hot the chocolate will separate which be disgust it's not nice at all
S0655	yeah and then you get like really dark chocolate and really light chocolate
S0653	no it's just that it sort of the fat separate out of the chocolate
S0655	oh
S0653	and it look all like really gloopy mud
S0655	mm
S0653	and you can sometimes bring it back bring it back you can make it a bite better by add a little bite of cream but we don't have any cream so i don't wanna take it to that point
S0654	mm
S0653	so i've take it off the heat now cos i'm hop that there will've be enough heat for it to melt the chocolate and
S0654	we've get quite a snazzy kitchen
S0653	we've get quite a snazzy kitchen
S0654	yeah with that
S0653	we've get a very old kitchen
S0655	yeah
S0653	do you mean with the extractor fan
S0654	yeah
S0653	snazzy mean kinda fashionable we don't have a fashionable kitchen
S0655	no
S0653	that's alright we don't need posh nice things do we
S0655	no
S0654	mm
S0653	just need
S0655	i think if we have posh nice things then and there's not really a point cos you don't cos there isn't really a competition of best look kitchen
S0653	do you guy want to stir it
S0655	it's more the live room
S0654	yeah i'll have a stir
S0653	there you go keep stir it
S0654	you can stir it first
S0653	just make sure
S0653	you don't touch the side of it cos it's well the bottom cos it's quite it's not very hot but it it be a little bite hot
S0655	why do you mean with my finger or just with the spoon
S0653	with your finger you can obviously touch the
S0655	oh i think you mean with the spoon
S0653	no no no i'm just say
S0654	cos the wooden spoon be very strong
S0653	yeah they don't
S0654	and have to do it have to do it really really really really hot
S0655	i can't get that stupid piece of butter to go
S0653	you just need to let it melt it's only gonna do that in the heat wood doesn't conduct heat so it's quite a safe thing i just mean that the bowl itself have be on water right let have a little bite of a turn it might be that we have to put it back on so it be in a bain marie can you remember what a bain marie be
S0654	no mummy
S0653	a water bath so i've get a saucepan of lightly boil water and then i put that erm glass container in the saucepan or just rest over it so the the steam basically melt it so it's quite a gentle
S0654	mm
S0653	way of melt you can do this in a microwave but it you have to be very careful cos it doesn't take very long and you can end up have little pocket that have get erm bits in them so i don't do it in a microwave any more cos our microwave be quite powerful do you want to give it to me and i'll have a look how be we do
S0654	how good be that
S0653	well that's alright there's a bite of a a lumpy bite which i think be the chocolate
S0655	oh i think it be i think i be butter
S0653	do you think that be the butter
S0654	that be
S0655	yeah
S0654	actually butter cos it be yellow
S0653	oh you're right
S0655	yeah it be butter
S0653	well look it's it this be why you don't need to heat it very much at all do you
S0654	that be so that look so nice
S0655	it's quite
S0654	and also
S0655	black l
S0654	it
S0655	black but still
S0654	no
S0653	it's nice
S0654	erm
S0653	i mean do you want to add a little bite more golden syrup to it to make it more sugary
S0655	wait can i have a smell
S0654	i think so
S0655	can i have a smell i'll have
S0654	yeah
S0655	a smell
S0654	a little bite more golden syrup
S0653	okay
S0654	that smell quite dark can i add a bite more erm of golden syrup please
S0655	and i get a little bite on my lip
S0653	yeah i mean you can taste it if you like to see what it
S0654	not yet because
S0653	well no taste it now because we can alter
S0655	can just erm shall i dip my finger on the spoon
S0653	no get erm a little teaspoon here you be if you need us to add er or i can add a little bite of milk to make it creamy
S0655	that
S0653	what do you think
S0654	mm it's quite dark
S0655	it have a lovely taste but not very nice aftertaste
S0654	yeah er we should put a bite more golden syrup in okay mum
S0653	okay yeah
S0654	because
S0655	it's a bite er
S0653	be it too dark
S0654	yeah dark
S0655	yeah it taste amaze
S0654	but then
S0655	it's just the aftertaste
S0653	right let me put a little bite in now you need to give that a good stir
S0655	i
S0654	and then we can check what it taste nice but do we need to dip erm
S0655	oh
S0653	right have you taste it
S0655	nope
S0653	right give it a little taste
S0654	i'm a bite lumpy here
S0653	don't worry about the tiny lump come on better
S0655	i'll have a try
S0653	yeah
S0655	uhu
S0653	you have to say yes
S0654	it be
S0653	oh it's gonna rain on my wash what do you think good or bad
S0654	it's good
S0653	so it's better now
S0654	oh
S0653	yeah right what we will do
S0654	i'm glad we have a taste
S0653	for it's very important in cook isn't it
S0654	yeah
S0653	to do that
S0654	but only tiny taste
S0653	okay we'll put it in a new container cos that will help it to cool down quicker
S0655	good
S0653	and you'll notice obviously the longer we leave it the thicker it will become and then it would eventually set so we don't want to leave it so long that we can't be you enjoy yourself there
S0654	yeah can we watch a bite of tv
S0653	no because we're go to watch the bake off when you've make completely finish the cake
S0655	yeah we can watch some tv and then the bake off
S0653	no
S0655	why not
S0653	cos all you do be ask to watch tv
S0654	mm
S0655	we haven't watch any tv today
S0653	no well nothing it's bad be gonna happen to you be it
S0654	please
S0655	wait be the x factor on today
S0653	you mean britain's get talent
S0655	oh yeah
S0653	yes i believe it be
S0655	mm
S0653	and michael mcintyre
S0654	only in the night
S0654	it's only in the night
S0653	your favourite programme
S0654	it's only in the night
S0653	sadly only at night time
S0655	yeah
S0653	well in the even yes
S0655	mm wow
S0653	right let's just see if we can cool this off then
S0653	so while we're wait for the erm ice to cool down let's talk about the great british bake off crème de la crème so out of the three finalists group who be your favourite
S0655	bake school
S0653	yeah it's the bake school for me what about you
S0654	park lane boys
S0653	the park lane boys so why do you like the park lane boys
S0654	well just that erm they don't like say oh yeah we're professional we've get two professional chocolate bakers here and
S0653	they don't say that
S0654	yeah and also one of them's get like an illness but he doesn't say and just step right up and say i'll do it again even though i'm sick
S0653	so you're impress by his work ethic
S0654	yeah
S0653	cos even though he's poorly he's still gonna do it
S0654	yeah
S0653	yeah and you're not sway at all by the fact that they're gonna make a a chocolate a white chocolate ferris wheel or anything like that
S0654	i be well that's basically one of the reason but it's not like a
S0653	oh that's good so and i do like the other group with the very tall head chef and the very short lady
S0654	mm
S0653	i think they're very sweet
S0655	i don't really like them cos they kind of
S0653	you don't like them cos they be
S0654	kind of cheat cos they keep on check like a that we could we could well yeah we could do that and er
S0653	i don't think they cheat but they be take the thing be i think they probably could have learn a lot from each other if they'd have the time to see what the other ones be do but they didn't change things halfway through but who that's who your favourite but who do you think be gonna win
S0655	erm i think that the park lane boys probably do have a chance but the bake school
S0653	mm
S0655	do seem to have pretty good er chance
S0654	yeah
S0655	to do it
S0654	erm
S0655	because they're
S0653	the
S0655	do it about their life and i think plat and bowl stack up be probably
S0653	uhu
S0654	also
S0653	bake school
S0654	because the park lane boys and the other group be give quite bad mark and it didn't faze them out at all do they
S0653	you mean so far at the begin
S0654	but do i want to eat it no
S0653	they didn't look very polish i mean i love the hamburger or the cheeseburger macaron
S0655	yeah
S0653	which look
S0653	amaze and the but the little ice cream cone thing
S0654	yeah
S0653	look pretty but didn't taste nice and the little baby mini toffee apple didn't wasn't finish very well be it
S0655	no
S0654	no
S0653	it didn't look very neat and tidy
S0654	no
S0653	but then the bake off bake school their rhubarb and custard tart they say didn't really wasn't very nice so they didn't do brilliantly with that but they've always do with their show piece haven't they
S0655	yeah always
S0653	although they be very good with chocolate but they haven't always they're their skills be with chocolate rather with pastry
S0654	yeah
S0653	and the and the park lane people they're very good with their pastry aren't they mm
S0654	i know
S0653	so who do you think definitely be get the best chance of win
S0654	bake school
S0655	park
S0653	do you
S0655	i think the park lane boys have a pretty good chance
S0654	yeah
S0655	like they have load of pastry ideas
S0653	well they all they all have a chance cos they're all in the final but who do you think be mostly likely to win do you think
S0655	erm i don't know i'm undecided
S0653	mm
S0655	i think they all
S0655	have an amaze chance
S0653	well they all have a chance cos they're in the final but do you mean
S0654	also if i be in there i'd just go with a knife
S0653	what do you mean you would just
S0654	so like i would get a peephole
S0653	what and stare at everybody else
S0654	yeah
S0653	yeah but there's no point in look at other people be there to see what they do at that point you've just gotta crack on and get on with your own er thing i think i mean it be have you see
S0654	no like when the i be behind the door
S0653	ah
S0654	and just go
S0653	have you see anything in there that you would like to try yourself
S0655	erm
S0654	yeah
S0655	i have never actually have a macaron
S0653	haven't you
S0654	i've
S0655	no
S0654	never have a macaron in my life
S0653	you would love them because they be almond base
S0654	i know i know macarons look so good
S0653	well we could definitely make them but i know that place like waitrose and mark and spencer's sell a beautiful selection of all different colour
S0655	yes be that do now
S0653	perhaps we could have a little be the be the chocolate the ice ready now no it's be about four minutes
S0655	three minutes actually
S0653	three minutes actually
S0655	well about four minutes
