S0589	it's nice it work very well with the spinach i would
S0588	yes it do
S0589	say
S0613	but this can't be all bad though
S0588	er
S0589	it's pretty not
S0588	quite bad
S0588	erm carbohydrate fest isn't it really
S0613	get your green
S0588	mm there's not a lot er in there
S0589	it's get one of your five a day
S0588	only just barely
S0589	onion
S0588	the onions be good though and anyway if you be starve this would keep you alive
S0613	this be far superior to a macaroni cheese i remember
S0589	do your mummy use to make it
S0613	yeah she do
S0588	she do i didn't like it then
S0613	she she use
S0588	it take me years to erm like macaroni cheese
S0613	she actually use macaroni
S0588	mm
S0613	which i just always find it very slimy i didn't
S0588	no macaroni's lovely i usually use macaroni
S0589	well it be probably how she make the cheese sauce that be the erm issue
S0588	no it be years before i start make macaroni cheese cos i do have that erm i didn't like it
S0589	i mean it but it might have be like a granular cheese sauce add boil water
S0588	no erm i don't know
S0613	it be
S0588	but i remember not like macaroni cheese
S0613	yes it wasn't very tasty i don't think just just very
S0588	mm
S0613	slimy i
S0589	mm
S0613	to me
S0588	or something that you don't like when you're younger
S0613	yeah
S0588	like it though doesn't she
S0589	what
S0588	macaroni cheese
S0589	uhu
S0613	you see i don't think she add anything like onion or i think it literally be
S0613	macaroni and cheese sauce wasn't it
S0588	yeah mm probably yeah
S0589	i'd still maintain that she probably didn't do a real french cheese sauce like with a roux
S0588	well how would she have there be only one way of make a cheese sauce isn't there
S0613	yeah in fact she she teach me how to make sauce a white sauce and then
S0588	i've get a
S0589	okay
S0588	white sauce in my cookery book
S0613	mm
S0588	that come from her and
S0613	mm
S0588	it's do with the flour and
S0589	well i i stand correct
S0588	butter
S0613	yeah you melt a bite of butter and then you
S0588	mm
S0613	add the
S0613	yeah and i always remember erm think it be a miracle cos when i first start make it it go all lumpy
S0588	mm
S0613	and you you panic and you go oh my god it's just go all lumpy
S0588	yes it's all quite chemical isn't it
S0613	i think you have to have faith and and
S0588	mm
S0613	keep whisk and add the milk and
S0588	yes
S0589	she be always surprise when i would do a real gravy
S0588	yes so what do we do with gravy do she just
S0589	which be the same kind of principle isn't it
S0588	i remember gravy as be very thin
S0613	it be only though erm
S0589	could i have the salt dear
S0613	in later years that she start use those packet gravies she use to make it properly
S0588	yeah
S0613	proper gravy
S0588	i remember yeah
S0613	use the the the
S0588	they didn't come in till later
S0613	juice from the meat and the veg water
S0588	mm
S0613	and
S0589	and cook through a flour in the fat to be the thicken agent
S0588	i remember love sunday roast
S0589	mm you still do dear
S0588	mm and she do load of bake as well
S0613	mm
S0589	i think this gain more from the spinach than it lose from not have bacon
S0588	it do actually yeah you're right but i also think it need that extra something otherwise it's too much cheese and pasta
S0589	and spinach
S0588	no otherwise it's too much cheese and pasta
S0613	have you put garlic in it
S0588	no

S0613	so maybe that be
S0588	it's erm it's very expensive the film cos it's really beautifully er craft and
S0613	mm
S0588	er it make me laugh though cos it's get everybody always erm people don't really do this in real life but they be erm kind of like linger for age
S0589	yeah
S0588	stare at each other after they've say something
S0613	yeah meaningful look yes
S0588	you know
S0589	there's a lot of that
S0589	yeah
S0589	in his slightly too
S0588	it's like if that happen in real life it would be really embarrass it's like mm what what
S0613	yeah
S0589	his slightly too
S0588	what be you look at
S0589	close fit trousers and jacket
S0613	yeah and his moody look yes
S0588	oh yeah and their sort of furrow
S0589	furrow brow
S0588	everyone have a
S0613	but you the when audio describe something like that it's it become so hard because there's only so many time you can say furrow brow and you know
S0588	yeah
S0613	star and a linger stare or
S0613	their eye lock
S0588	the linger stare be so funny
S0589	a pregnant pause
S0613	and it's kind of like
S0588	yeah
S0613	oh get to think of something else to say
S0588	yeah
S0613	and they're do it all the time
S0588	yeah
S0613	but er
S0588	it be a bite funny but the torch be especially make me laugh there he be he's get his touch out again
S0613	he get out his torch
S0589	thing be when he get it out he never try to see if the light
S0589	work
S0588	i've see a couple of time he have they have actually attempt to make an explanation of the fact that it's dark and he's get his torch out and he's sort of vaguely try the light switch but most of the time they don't even bother with that well just attempt to give an explanation here at least try a light switch but er no
S0613	so you watch it all on iplayer
S0588	yeah
S0613	cos you don't
S0589	the other one we always enjoy be what be it terrible name crime stories back case
S0588	oh
S0589	case history
S0588	that wasn't very good really
S0589	i always like that
S0588	mm
S0589	and i think the lead in that be terrific he i've never see him in anything else ever
S0588	he probably be
S0589	he's a terrific lead
S0588	i can't remember his name
S0589	but it it be the same series
S0613	mm
S0588	yeah similar
S0589	where where i mean in term of the characterisation
S0588	he be always out jog
S0589	he be always out jog and then
S0588	mm
S0589	do pregnant erm star in into the the
S0588	oh that be that be more light hearted though that wasn't nearly as sort of
S0589	oh it have much more of
S0588	dark
S0589	a of a comedic
S0588	kind of yeah
S0589	element when when in
S0588	it wasn't
S0589	into his interaction with various other character
S0588	this be the bleakest one i've ever come across really for bleakness and even even bleaker than vera which be set up north and it's
S0589	pet
S0613	what about all the erm the nordic ones be you watch any of those
S0588	yeah cos this be very base on those i think
S0589	yes yeah so there a real fashion for those now
S0588	and they they they must have start the whole
S0589	you i also think part of the reason why it's bilingual be specifically to appeal to in term of market it
S0588	well it's very trendy isn't it
S0613	mm
S0589	in the nordic countries
S0588	yeah well no i don't know why they just don't have the whole thing in welsh and have subtitle
S0589	they do they they they've they've do more series
S0588	but they don't have subtitle
S0589	oh no no but i mean
S0588	yeah
S0589	they they have do for for erm welsh tv
S0588	but why not have subtitle cos it's really trendy at the moment to have subtitle
S0613	yeah yeah
S0589	but he doesn't speak welsh
S0588	i mean i'd watch it
S0589	or be that do his character doesn't speak welsh
S0588	no he doesn't erm no he must do in the other ones though
S0613	so in the welsh version
S0589	that's a good point
S0588	the welsh ones yeah
S0613	unless he speak english and they have welsh subtitle for when he
S0589	so there you go maybe so
S0588	oh i don't know
S0589	cos it's er really for welsh speakers
S0588	but why not just have more welsh things with the subtitle
S0613	mm
S0588	it make sense
S0613	but it must be really weird for the actors cos they have to do everything twice once in welsh and once in english
S0588	but they're not the same ones though be they
S0589	yeah
S0588	be they
S0613	i think so yeah oh there's be
S0589	i think there's be additional series that have never be show on on bbc which
S0588	i think that
S0589	er on bbc england
S0588	it probably start out as welsh
S0589	which be entirely in welsh
S0588	and then
S0613	so be you watch it on bbc london then
S0589	no we're watch it on
S0588	iplayer
S0613	wales bbc wales
S0589	the
S0588	no just the iplayer it's on bbc4
S0613	cos it's really weird
S0589	bbc4 so the bbc wales one i think maybe be
S0588	be welsh
S0589	and there've be additional series which haven't be show
S0588	it be welsh cos i look it up
S0589	yeah there you go
S0588	and it's call
S0589	mm good ish

S0589	there she be tuck in and then i start to get sort of you know tingly
S0613	oh legally don't you have to have a certain amount of space i mean you shouldn't have to be
S0588	yeah but that's never happen before
S0589	i think legally we have enough space but what they've be do over the years
S0588	they just do the the legal limit
S0589	and the company have expand erm there's be a erm a sort of requisite er shrink of of the
S0588	of course
S0613	so you have to be
S0589	across individual desks
S0613	quite quite slim to get a job
S0589	and also the the space between the aisles
S0588	oh it's disgust
S0589	be as well i don't i mean i don't mind it it's not
S0588	oh i hate it
S0589	as long as people aren't eat
S0588	no i hate it

S0588	yeah but people eat fruit people eat bananas oh i can't bear it you know and they're it's like there and they start eat fruit and bananas and it's like oh
S0589	but i mean i'm happy to tell something if i think what they're do be antisocial i didn't tell the girl eat peanuts
S0613	mm
S0589	cos it in and of itself it's not antisocial
S0588	but even just eat at the desk's
S0589	erm
S0588	a bite gross when other people be there
S0613	yeah i mean meal time where you sit round a table together and it's a share thing
S0588	mm
S0613	but to have somebody go through
S0588	i mean cos that's what i can't bare about bare about it that's why i can't do it it's it's erm no that's disgust
S0613	how's how's your ear now be you still do the eardrops
S0589	it seem okay now
S0588	have it clear
S0589	well i've not have the same kind of issue yeah
S0588	it's unblock itself then have it
S0589	well it's no longer block whether it will become re block in the next sort of
S0613	be it wax that be block it
S0588	yeah
S0613	mm you didn't have to have it syringe then or
S0589	no
S0588	that's good
S0613	hoover out
S0589	no
S0588	but
S0589	well i go yeah have have i be to the nurse before we have that conversation
S0613	you say you be put the drop in i can't remember if you be put them in to soften the wax or whether
S0589	no i think that be just what i i'd buy yeah sorry i go to see a nurse assume that i'd just be refer to see a a either a specialist or or they'd be able to do the at the practice i e not syringe but the the
S0613	mm
S0589	whatever the the thing that you say that you have have once before and in the end the have go all the way there and queue up and go to see them there sort of forty minutes after my appointment time she say well put two drop of olive oil in and then the next day put two drop of bicarbonate and you know any any any idiot
S0613	bicarbonate and olive oil i've never hear
S0589	just cos bicarbonate of soda
S0588	i've never hear of that one
S0589	no i've hear of olive oil but not bicarbonate of soda it would go all fizzy wouldn't it
S0589	well yeah she she cos all she write on the little be a little erm pad of paper so it wasn't like erm it be a prescription or anything she just say bicarbonate of soda so straight away i think of
S0588	weird
S0589	okay so the powder
S0613	that's you use in cook yeah
S0588	that's for teeth
S0589	the powder so then i
S0589	so then i have to stop her and say okay so but i i dilute the bicarbonate of soda in
S0613	water
S0589	olive oil or or or mix it with olive oil or water she go no no no no no no no oh silly me you you get that from the pharmacy and sure enough
S0613	the way she say you would have be put
S0589	yeah exactly yeah shake it into you picture that i think that's what she picture
S0589	and sure enough it's one of the sort of ear clean products that that that you find off off the shelf er not even from the
S0588	never head of it
S0613	and so do it fizz cos i've use one of those and
S0589	it didn't
S0613	they they go all bubbly and fizzy in your ear
S0589	they didn't fizz but er that might just be me cos it always fizz for
S0588	there's another one that do fizz call optrex or something like that and it fizz and i really like that
S0589	but i think that's just a
S0588	it's fizz
S0589	that's a urea base acid which i have previously be use but anyway it seem to have clear up so
S0588	that's good cos you can't have it syringe anyway can you
S0589	er i want to
S0588	cos of your asthma
S0589	avoid that
S0588	you've get so many
S0589	but it's the only time i've ever have like
S0588	things wrong with you

S0589	version after that but annoyingly i buy it for be it a present or i just buy it and then sort of the next week they release
S0613	they bring the touch one with the
S0589	the latest erm you know bell and whistle
S0613	mm
S0589	one
S0588	but i if i i differentiate between erm
S0589	it be be it touchscreen i think it be touchscreen
S0588	yeah i differentiate between the tablet ones and the the ones that be exclusively readers because the readers be like book and they read as
S0613	yeah
S0588	they've get a page look and everything
S0589	yeah but no but the then they
S0588	so i don't really even compare them
S0589	bring out the the paper white whatever it's call
S0588	oh the paper white that's the one i want
S0589	and it's back light
S0613	cos 's get the kindle fire which be more like a tablet
S0589	that's a tablet which be
S0588	that's a tablet
S0589	one that we be look at buy
S0588	i don't even consider that a reader
S0589	as buy as a tablet
S0613	mm
S0589	not as
S0588	no
S0589	not as
S0588	yeah
S0589	a reader
S0588	but the e i want the one with the
S0588	light and the white
S0613	yeah
S0588	paper but they probably do that on purpose didn't they cos maybe they could have do that first but i've get the grey page and i've always think that's a bite grey can't i
S0613	mm
S0588	turn it up a bite
S0613	yeah
S0589	none of them use to do it until quite well quite recently in the last sort of
S0588	bet they have the technology
S0589	three or four years cos i remember have a conversation with erm who like you she want to be able to read in bed
S0613	yes
S0588	yeah
S0589	without a light on
S0588	yes
S0589	whilst
S0613	yeah
S0589	her husband
S0588	exactly
S0589	kip
S0613	yeah
S0589	and of course with all the readers you need a light
S0613	yeah
S0589	er
S0588	and then now
S0589	and so i research and and i find a couple of things that
S0588	you'd have think
S0589	cos now
S0588	they could have do that firstly
S0589	now they're all backlit and you can read them
S0613	mm
S0588	that's just so that you have to buy another one i'm sure
S0613	well no mine's
S0589	well no they er
S0613	mine's an antique now
S0588	be it
S0589	they they didn't have the erm technology
S0588	i think they would have have the technology
S0589	i mean that no one ever think of apply it they have the technology
S0613	you you could buy a clip on light for it
S0589	yeah cos they have
S0613	but and when i get mine
S0589	all kinds of er
S0613	yes you could have a sort of light you could clip on the top
S0588	i've see those
S0589	they have all extras like that yeah
S0613	yeah
S0588	i don't think it's worth me get a clip on light because i'll end up get erm the kindle white one probably christmas or something
S0589	well it doesn't it doesn't and it doesn't keep me up anyway do it so
S0588	it doesn't actually but i'd like to read in the dark i think
S0589	and er
S0588	that would be nice
S0589	ah oh i worry about your eye though cos you do a lot
S0613	they're suppose to be kind for your eye good for your eye oh well okay for your eye aren't they they've just design it all so that
S0588	it doesn't glare like a
S0613	yeah like a computer yeah
S0588	computer it doesn't feel the same way at all but i don't know it's obviously not a page page but it's a beautiful thing to i mean even the old one i've get it's very beautifully clear and i love the way you can just make the write whatever size you want to and everything
S0613	yes but then you've yeah
S0613	thing be i've get to the stage now i think oh i don't need to wear my glass to read but if i actually make it big enough
S0588	yeah okay
S0613	i end up get about three word per page
S0613	so it's not
S0588	it's get worry
S0613	yeah
S0589	i can't do
S0588	yeah
S0589	without my proper book though

S0589	it seem to somehow demean it though
S0588	it's what it's all about
S0589	uhu it's all about the richness of the language the lexicography
S0588	it's about money
S0613	do they have to have erm a big variety of people talk though
S0588	yes
S0613	so you can't have it you
S0588	they've get to cover the whole country
S0589	that's my worry when i say be there a political bias on the basis that if it's just sort of twenty somethings
S0588	no it's everybody
S0589	and and often student base
S0588	no no no no it's all age group
S0589	that you're gonna get a very quite a specific
S0613	yeah
S0589	erm demographic
S0613	most people be leave wing though
S0589	well not accord to the erm
S0588	all of them across the board i've only do one
S0589	not accord to election result my dear
S0588	exactly but maybe that's mean that people don't admit to it
S0613	no exactly i think that's that's more the point
S0588	it's because it's erm
S0613	people don't people
S0588	it's morally more right to be leave wing so that's how people will talk but when it come to elect
S0589	you become more selfish
S0588	yeah
S0613	yes
S0588	ultimately
S0589	yeah yeah
S0588	it must be
S0613	right
S0588	it must be something to be ashamed of then to be right wing
S0613	but i suppose right wing politics you wouldn't kind of go
S0588	cos it's very mean sound ring wing
S0613	exactly isn't it i mean it's alright
S0588	so you don't want to sound like
S0613	to say something leave wing like i think we should all look after
S0588	we should share
S0613	every member of society
S0588	exactly
S0613	whereas if you say no i i i earn work very hard to earn my money and i'm not give it to anybody
