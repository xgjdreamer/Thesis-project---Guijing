S0084	yeah
S0082	and the date be the ninth of april
S0084	oh good
S0082	so if you put the kettle on
S0084	yeah
S0082	then i'll just put this shop away and make us a cup of tea
S0084	mm oh
S0082	mm
S0084	so mass be at three
S0082	yeah well it's er yes the um it's er um it
S0084	veneration of the cross
S0082	yeah it change er i don't know when before i become a catholic
S0084	mm
S0082	because at one time it wasn't a mass er on good friday it be only the the veneration of the cross
S0084	yeah
S0082	but then they decide that they would make er they would add communion so you don't get you don't get what's call the consecration where the priest doesn't er um um conduct the word which turn the bread and wine into the body and blood what they do they take they're er call they're call reserve in other word what be consecrate yesterday
S0084	right
S0082	or before
S0084	okay
S0082	be use today
S0084	and that's because it symbolize the day that jesus die
S0082	yeah but i mean well you know
S0084	mm
S0082	you didn't have this so in a way you're commemorate the day he die in fact it's probably not a good idea to have communion i don't i don't know
S0084	no it do seem a bite strange to me
S0082	yeah and it make in longer i know i know you shouldn't say that but er
S0082	it's a consideration
S0084	it do well that's it
S0082	well it's a long service anyway because
S0084	it's a long service cos er all of you have gotta go up and kiss the feet
S0082	on the over the weekend you know er saturday even count as a sunday mass
S0084	mm
S0082	so you get an eight o'clock a nine thirty a ten forty five twelve o'clock be a polish mass and you get a five o'clock so you get five mass plus a polish mass
S0084	mm
S0082	on a normal weekend sunday so you get all of those people in theory go to the one good friday
S0084	mm
S0082	event so it be a long process and to add communion to it make it well for a lot of people quite quite difficult
S0084	mm
S0082	me um a photograph
S0084	i do
S0082	but i can't
S0084	huh
S0082	access it

S0084	blimey
S0082	two hundred and fifty texts two hundred and fifty megabytes
S0084	how have you manage that
S0082	well it's an easter deal apparently because i'm a customer of virgin

S0084	they don't wanna lose your custom
S0082	with er the
S0084	that's why 's get a four pound a month phone bill

S0082	yeah
S0084	but you know that's up to you you er but
S0082	yeah

S0082	yeah i just didn't believe him anyway about four or five hours later er er somebody else phone me and say er i hear you're you er phone us and want to leave us you know
S0084	oh
S0082	can i ask why have we er have we not you know provide a service i say no you've always give me good service

S0084	oh there you go
S0082	so um well i i er i don't mind i mean i i just can't believe even though they will do almost anything i can't believe they'd give me a brand new smartphone i mean i'm not a customer if i have a smartphone and i just say to them i don't wanna pay twenty five pound a month i'm sure they'd knock my um rental down to to um what pay
S0084	mm
S0082	but to give me a smartphone and eleven hundred minutes and two hundred and fifty texts and two fifty megabytes for thirteen ninety nine a month i can't i can't see them do that so

S0084	you can see it's me
S0082	and it tell you fine okay i i didn't know that
S0084	and then you can just pull that back up again
S0082	as you tell me the other day you only get the very minimal of information in the box
S0084	yeah yeah
S0082	and you have to go on the internet to their website to get the rest
S0084	it's
S0082	and of course it's quite difficult when you've get like a little book you can just put it in your pocket and pull it out when you've get a problem but you don't
S0084	i know
S0082	you don't wanna keep sort of go into the internet every time and
S0084	i know
S0082	look things up
S0084	it's really annoy
S0082	it be it be annoy but er
S0084	if i um
S0082	have a seat
S0084	thank dad
S0082	er yeah the um the reason i have a er i couldn't do much yesterday be we seem to we seem to be go through a stage of things break down
S0084	oh no
S0082	nanny and nanny would say things happen in threes but
S0084	nanny yeah
S0082	the fridge first and then the bathroom light
S0084	oh no
S0082	yeah er come out of the bathroom yesterday and say the light won't go out so i say what do you mean the light won't go out
S0082	he say well i keep pull the cord and the light won't go out
S0084	mm
S0082	so i say oh right so and he be absolutely right it wouldn't go out
S0084	mm
S0082	er would you like um would you like a biscuit
S0084	um i'm alright actually thank dad
S0082	be you sure
S0084	i'll just have this banana thank you though
S0082	um so er fortunately when i move in here
S0084	mm
S0082	um before i buy the place i get er we have a one of the people that work on 's um er loft extension
S0084	mhm
S0082	er well not one but a number of people er be electricians because they have to they have to wire it all
S0084	mm
S0082	and i be so impress with them i meet the person in charge i be so impress that i keep his detail so when i make an offer on the flat i give him a ring and er he send one of his guy down
S0084	mm
S0082	and he give it a thorough check over
S0084	mm
S0082	and send me a report and um there be a couple of small things that have to be do which they do but the main thing be to put a proper fuse box cos it have the original fuse box
S0084	oh i remember
S0082	in that cupboard
S0084	yeah
S0082	and what they do now and we have the same issue in road exactly the same actually er and what they do now be instead of have fuse you have what they call contact breakers so
S0084	mm
S0082	if you get a surge
S0084	mm
S0082	which in er a fuse box have like a fuse
S0084	yeah
S0082	um it that there's no fuse but er er the um tut er this unit flick a switch which cut all the power off immediately
S0084	oh right
S0082	so it have two function one it act like a fuse so it's it protect your wire from burn out if there's a huge surge
S0084	mhm
S0082	and two it's um er a safety feature
S0084	mm
S0082	because you know children often put their finger in plug point men er go out and mow the lawn with an electric mower and cut cut through the wire and stuff like that
S0084	mm
S0082	er and electrocute themselves women get terrible electric shock sometimes electrocute themselves from wash machine and things
S0084	mm
S0082	er whereas when you've get this consumer unit the the the first element of the short it's call a short circuit when that happen
S0084	mhm
S0082	the first you know er in a nanosecond the first awareness flick the switch
S0084	tut okay
S0082	so you can't electrocute yourself
S0084	nice
S0082	um so what i do i um i flick the switch
S0084	mm
S0082	which turn the light out and then i take the er um this you know it's pull cord
S0084	yeah yeah
S0082	i take it apart and i i fiddle around i i mean i the my first reaction be well this be this be do for
S0084	mm
S0082	but of course i you know think well i can just have a go so i fiddle around with it for about an hour
S0082	and er i mean basically the spring er cos if you think about it you know when you pull it flick back up you know you pull it down it flick back up
S0084	mm
S0082	there's obviously a spring in it to do that
S0084	yeah
S0082	the spring be not only rusty but have break
S0084	oh
S0082	it's probably forty years old
S0084	mm
S0082	the same age as the flat
S0084	tut yeah
S0082	so um so i um i try to sort of cobble that together and i put it all back and then er inside there's a little wheel on a spindle and as you pull it it turn and that's what you know
S0084	oh okay
S0082	it's like like a little can it's it sort of flick the switch
S0084	mm
S0082	as you do it and all and all that be fall to piece as well the the plastic runners that it be seat in er have wear right down er and so it didn't make contact so it be ridiculous so anyway yesterday er i look on the internet at nine o'clock cos i think b and q might not be open until er nine thirty or something think about how the shop open in the city centre
S0084	mm
S0082	i be quite surprise to find that b and q be open from seven in the morning until
S0084	mm
S0082	nine at night and
S0084	blimey
S0082	so i cycle round to b and q
S0084	mm
S0082	and er i buy the whole new unit you know sort of
S0084	oh how annoy
S0082	and then er it be only a fiver er and then i replace it but you know have say that it take me a while to do all you know i have to cycle over there and then i have to come back and
S0084	yeah
S0082	and do it all it take a while
S0084	can you buy the um the pull cord separately or do you have to buy a whole new unit
S0082	er you can i mean you can you can buy er yeah i mean i if somewhere like um
S0082	er yeah yeah i mean it's probably not exactly the same but you can buy it separately
S0084	no i be just think that in our house because they've get so many people come and go
S0082	mm
S0084	i notice the other day that the pull cord at the bottom be a completely different colour to er at the top
S0082	mm
S0084	cos people have be disgust not wash their hand or anything like that so
S0082	mm
S0084	it's really dirty at the bottom
S0082	yeah yeah
S0084	and obviously that's the landlord's responsibility but it'd be quite nice to sort of
S0082	mm
S0084	say to her look it's only a couple of quid from b and q or something
S0082	yeah
S0084	can you just have it replace cos that's disgust
S0082	or or buy it buy the um what you need to do be to work out whether you can connect it
S0084	mm
S0082	in into the into the thing that's that's the that's the other thing be if you buy
S0084	i think it's one of those ones where where you unscrew it
S0082	right
S0084	at the top
S0082	yeah but you've gotta disconnect the power first cos
S0084	yeah
S0082	er all of that's live up there
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0082	mm so you've gotta find a way to disconnect the power when nobody's use you know light and stuff like that i mean i don't know what sort of fuse box you've get in your place but
S0084	probably a hundred years old
S0082	yeah
S0084	i wouldn't
S0082	i don't suppose she's replace it so you you have to be very careful with things like that
S0084	yeah that's why i would never do it myself
S0082	mm er but in theory you can
S0084	i mean it's not like a press
S0082	you can replace cos i'm sure because of this rather weird system of you know run this pulley across the top of the door and down the side
S0084	yeah
S0082	i'm sure somebody must've um put that in er and the wooden um tut er er pull thing
S0084	mm
S0082	er have a hole inside that's far too big for the um cord
S0084	tut oh right
S0082	that's on the new pull switch
S0084	mm
S0082	so i've leave the plastic one on what i've do i've because there be two plastic ones in there now
S0084	mm
S0082	one for the shower unit and one for the light
S0084	yeah
S0082	i've um move the handle you know the bite you pull
S0084	mm
S0082	up
S0084	oh okay good
S0082	the cord so that when you go in in the dark you can only grab
S0084	mm you don't pull the wrong one
S0082	you can at shoulder height you can only grab hold of one
S0084	mm
S0082	if you want if you want a shower you have to put your hand
S0084	oh that's a good idea
S0082	um i haven't cut the cord er on it yet i've just you know kind of just in case i get
S0084	just tie it or something
S0082	in case i think of a better way of do it i've just tie it up
S0084	mm
S0082	just to see how i how it work
S0084	mm
S0082	er but er if i if i can't think of a better way and i can't find any flaw in in it i shall just cut the cord and it'll just instead of be a you know a metre and a half long or whatever it be before
S0084	mm
S0082	it'll just be you know a foot
S0084	yeah
S0082	a foot long so you just reach up and pull it well i mean basically i don't think that's a problem cos there won't be any children do it so er
S0084	no exactly
S0082	and er you can always replace as i say you can always replace the cord if you
S0084	mm
S0082	want to
S0084	absolutely how come the um tut the light switch be in the place that it be that you have to trail the lead
S0082	stupid electrician i think
S0084	yeah
S0082	or a er either a stupid electrician a lazy electrician er or um a devious electrician because you know stupid because he didn't think about it
S0084	mm
S0082	he didn't think about the door open
S0084	yeah
S0082	lazy because he just didn't wanna run any more wire across it be convenient for him to er just put a little bite of wire on or devious because he's save the wire
S0084	yeah
S0082	um
S0084	and charge them probably
S0082	mm and charge the full rate um
S0084	yeah
S0082	and if he do it in all of the house er all of the flats you know eighteen of them
S0084	yeah
S0082	he'd save himself eighteen metres of wire
S0084	yeah
S0082	um so um i don't know what it be but yeah it's just stupid it should be er mm they should've run the wire you know above the ceiling above the above the er artex ceiling
S0084	yeah
S0082	and to the the side of the door
S0084	mm
S0082	which open
S0084	yeah
S0082	not the side of the door where the hinge be
S0082	so you can't really crazy
S0084	stupid
S0082	but i've see that often i mean er sometimes i've see it because people have change the way the door swing
S0084	right
S0082	and of and and that happen a lot in road cos all the door well not all of them but lot of the doors have be rehinged
S0084	mm
S0082	because people you know want to use space in a different way
S0084	yeah
S0082	of course there's you know that's just one of those things you know in a er actually what they should've do when they rehinged the door be get an er an electrician in to come and
S0084	mm
S0082	rewire that light but of course you know that's an expense that a lot of people don't want
S0084	absolutely
S0082	but um sometimes in new house er or even in er older place like this i've see it you know where quite clearly er it's be like that from the word go
S0084	mm
S0082	you know er it's just down to the electricians and the same with the in the bathroom if you if you um in the bathroom and in the kitchen sink you have tap with lever on and not
S0084	yeah that's it yeah
S0082	and er the way they the way they should work er be that um when you um when you turn them on you do that
S0084	yeah
S0082	okay and when you turn them off you do that whereas the one in the bathroom when you turn them on you do that
S0084	yeah it's weird
S0082	and it's it's er you know you have to sort of remember
S0084	it's counter intuitive
S0082	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0082	which way you're do um and what they've do they've use two er leave tap
S0082	instead of a leave and a right
S0084	yeah
S0082	and again you know be that stupidity of the plumber be it laziness of the plumber or er do they do it deliberately cos they didn't wanna open another box of tap
S0084	mm
S0082	and they have two leave hand ones oh i'll just stick those on they'll
S0084	yeah
S0082	be alright
S0084	they won't care probably probably mm
S0082	so yeah so um so i be out er and there be you know the um holy thursday service at seven thirty last night
S0084	oh it's an even service
S0082	yeah so i be out until er huh about half past nine

S0082	so what what actual size be the be be the actual bite you eat then
S0084	i don't know
S0082	be it like that be it like a football be it
S0084	it's it's probably tiny no it's probably fill with smaller ones
S0082	oh oh i see
S0084	well you know they do little egg
S0082	yeah
S0084	like cream egg
S0082	yeah
S0084	they do egg that size

S0082	oh right so she's er
S0084	funny time of it so she prefer to just drive
S0082	be she alright be she apart from apart from that
S0084	she's alright they've um they've have a bite of a thing with recently but sort of
S0082	be he back in or be he
S0084	tut he's back in he go back to thailand for a while with you know his
S0082	oh yeah his former former
S0084	the woman who steal his
S0082	sort of or his second wife or whatever
S0084	his second wife who steal all his money but for some reason he go back to thailand with her i dunno but that's obviously another reason why 's get power of attorney
S0082	mm
S0084	he's get some sort of detach retina
S0082	oh dear
S0084	so he come back from thailand to have the operation
S0082	mm
S0084	but hadn't really communicate that to anybody
S0082	mm
S0084	and he be really um he turn up at the house and be shout at and
S0082	really
S0084	all this sort of stuff and he wasn't i say to you know have he be drink she say no that be the worst bite
S0082	mm
S0084	that be the first time they've see him so irate and so sort of manic and
S0082	why why be he shout at them because
S0084	he be annoy that nobody have be er at to pick him up
S0082	mm
S0084	but at the time they didn't know that he be back
S0084	so no wonder
S0082	mm unless unless unless you make an arrangement with someone er
S0084	yeah
S0082	nobody's gonna be there be they
S0084	well apparently he call and didn't wanna ask or cos she didn't want them to feel oblige
S0082	mm
S0084	um and she he he'd call for some money for the operation and she'd put a thousand pound in his account and
S0082	mm
S0084	pit have steal it or something i don't really know
S0082	mm
S0084	um and he be he come round to the house shout the odds and anton just saw red and tut
S0082	mm
S0084	get in between and
S0082	mm
S0084	um and so i think have to try and diffuse the situation
S0082	yeah
S0084	so
S0082	sound very nasty
S0084	it be and i i think he's get so he have this eye problem he's now have the operation
S0082	mm
S0084	but he's also get pre cancerous cells you know cos he he have leukaemia didn't he a few years ago and then the
S0082	mm
S0084	they have a then he have another scare a few years ago
S0082	mm
S0084	and they think that this must be his time then he recover and
S0082	yeah
S0084	now they've come back um i suppose each time they just wonder like what be it that's gonna get him in the end cos he's
S0082	yeah
S0084	he's pretty frail and he's an alcoholic and
S0082	he's probably one of those people who'll live until he's ninety though isn't he and have all these things
S0084	yeah
S0082	i mean er
S0084	and it's obviously it's just such an emotional rollercoaster for all of them
S0082	mm
S0084	so
S0082	yeah it's er
S0084	i don't think that's particularly easy and i think er probably unfairly get quite annoy at for not stand up for herself and
S0082	well she be very er sort of timid well not timid but she's um you know sort of not one to shout and rant and
S0084	she's not exactly
S0082	rave at people
S0084	she's er just that's just not in her character
S0082	no
S0084	and um even the next day it be his birthday and they all take him card round and even though the day before he'd be round say no one love me no one care about me they'd all take the time to send a birthday card
S0082	mm
S0084	and get a card from and he'd draw in it
S0082	mm
S0084	you know and and have have him in the house hadn't she you know when he be in rehab
S0082	mm
S0084	she'd have him in the house with
S0082	before he'd start drink again mm
S0084	yeah before he fell off the wagon again so
S0082	mm
S0084	this be just how it's gonna be
S0082	i think so
S0084	it's always gonna be like this
S0082	alcoholics be quite difficult to deal with
S0084	yeah
S0082	well anybody that's on a drug dependency be
S0084	exactly and if it's especially if you know if it's a close family member you know
S0082	mm yeah
S0084	there and there's no rule book
S0082	mm
S0084	i think she sort of beat herself up about feel a particular way and
S0082	mm
S0084	there's no rule book on how you're suppose to feel or how
S0082	mm
S0084	how you're suppose to deal with these things so
S0082	mm
S0084	um but luckily her grandad 's go off to italy for three months
S0082	oh right
S0084	cos that's always they always breathe a sigh of relief when he go
S0082	where do he go when he go to italy then where do he stay with his do he have relatives out there
S0084	he he go yeah he must have friends and relatives out there
S0082	mm
S0084	i dunno
S0082	cos it be on
S0084	cos he have to sell the
S0082	it be on 's mother's side
S0084	yeah
S0082	the italian er
S0084	and then he get remarry
S0082	ancestry wasn't it
S0084	yeah
S0082	and then he marry an another italian woman
S0084	he marry another italian woman
S0082	but but that all er come apart mm
S0084	and she take all his money
S0082	she take all mm
S0084	which be why he's have to live with
S0082	mm
S0084	er although 's auntie um who live do you remember they live in the west
S0082	oh yeah because we meet them at
S0084	yeah
S0082	her baptism didn't we

S0084	yeah she's a teacher
S0082	yeah she be a nice woman and i
S0084	she's really nice
S0082	i speak to her for a little while yeah
S0084	but she's um like most people who be quite well off doesn't spend any money
S0082	mm
S0084	and so felt oblige to take in her dad even though she doesn't really like him
S0082	mm
S0084	and have get more than enough mouth to fee
S0082	mm
S0084	so convert the garage put up her dad who you know rant and rave at the kid
S0082	mm
S0084	and be just generally a bite difficult to live with
S0082	mm
S0084	and he's get on obviously he have an accident i think last year have a hip replacement tut um
S0082	he must be on cos ellie's er sort of mum's age well fifty
S0084	yeah late fifties i think
S0082	mm
S0084	i think 's thirty six this year
S0082	mm so her dad must be in his late seventies i would've think
S0084	er yeah he's at least eighty eighty one eighty two i think
S0082	mm
S0084	yeah
S0082	mm
S0084	and they're all live in that house so he's go off for three months
S0082	mm
S0084	and so 's come in and be stay in the granny annexe
S0082	mm
S0084	be in the toblerone room which i tell you have be
S0082	yeah
S0084	wallpaper now
S0082	oh yeah yeah three feet high and
S0084	three feet high
S0082	you crawl in
S0084	yeah ellie do it apparently i think have do it but she get her mum to wallpaper it which be
S0082	wallpaper it
S0084	pretty good go yeah do you remember we be say like how be it even possible to wallpaper three foot high
S0082	oh that's right yeah
S0084	room
S0082	how would you get the step in there
S0084	yeah
S0082	but um no i be just think of you know put board across it and think that would be difficult enough wouldn't it
S0084	well it's get board on the floor like mdf on the floor and mdf around the wall
S0082	yeah but somebody must've do that
S0084	so which yeah before they move in
S0082	oh before they move in
S0084	yeah so it's er it's always be like that
S0082	mm
S0084	it's not be like an expose
S0082	oh i see
S0084	roof space like in 's cupboard
S0082	mm
S0084	but it's that size
S0082	mm
S0084	um obviously cos it be the roof
S0082	mm
S0084	and it's er slop on one side but luckily they didn't have to clean it out or anything like that it already have the mdf board
S0082	mm mm
S0084	around the outside
S0082	that cupboard er on 's stairs er be so filthy i mean i have to
S0084	yeah
S0082	go in there and clear it all out before we move i mean it's
S0084	yeah
S0082	a hundred years of dirt and muck in there
S0084	tut that's it yeah but i think cos when we move in obviously we have all the box of whatever we weren't gonna unpack
S0082	mm
S0084	and they just get shove in there didn't they
S0082	mm
S0084	so they have to all come back out again
S0082	mm
S0084	tut but yeah i think she yeah apart from er the drama with their dad it's she's quite enjoy live at home
S0082	mm
S0084	so
S0082	mm
S0084	i think it's all go okay she's get i tell you didn't i that she get a job work for the counterterrorism unit for the olympics
S0082	mm yeah that's right yeah
S0084	so i think she's quite excite about that
S0082	mm
S0084	i try to probe her but she wasn't give anything away she's not allow to talk about it so
S0082	she's um you might be a terrorist
S0084	i might be a terrorist
S0082	mm so she's er she's leave er the er the f be it fco
S0084	well that's it's a department within the fco
S0082	oh right
S0084	but it's only temporary
S0082	but she she be she be talk about leave wasn't she
S0084	she be yeah i think this job come up because it's much more excite than where she work at the moment
S0082	mm
S0084	she work you know if you write to david cameron
S0082	mm
S0084	it's they answer those letter
S0082	yeah that's right and he put a stamp on it or or they put a stamp on it
S0084	they put a stamp on it if you write you're more likely to get a personal response if you write to your mp as oppose to members of
S0082	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0084	members of the public just write to
S0082	yeah if you write to
S0084	david cameron
S0082	if you write to any member of the government you won't get a personal response cos they're too busy
S0084	but then you could write to cos if your mp be er william hague
S0082	yeah
S0084	he's also a cabinet member
S0082	mm
S0084	so you could write to him
S0082	mm
S0084	and then they would pass
S0082	mm yeah
S0084	i presume i don't know i'm not quite sure
S0082	i dunno i dunno how that work
S0084	i don't even know
S0082	er i still think you'd get a letter from somebody in the cabinet
S0084	mm
S0082	er and whether or not um he er would be aware of it i don't know
S0084	i think he um they just have standard responses cos er her her desk in charge of syria europe and libya do she say so if anyone write in on those subject
S0082	mm
S0084	to david cameron say
S0082	mm
S0084	you know
S0082	mm
S0084	please why aren't you invade syria or what what be you do to help the situation in syria
S0082	well syria could kick off in a big way quite soon so she might be busy
S0084	yep well they get a lot of letter but if you've just address it to david cameron he will never see them
S0082	mm
S0084	and i be say why don't you just you know start put stuff in the internal post to number ten
S0082	mm
S0084	you know just
S0082	mm
S0084	even if it be just a proportion of the letter that he be get through because he's not see anything
S0082	well she's
S0084	he's not aware of the
S0082	she's
S0084	level of
S0082	she's probably under order not to do that
S0084	she can't yeah
S0082	mm
S0084	she'd be fire
S0082	mm
S0084	but er
S0082	it's very tight
S0084	he doesn't know
S0082	it's all very tightly control in the civil service always have be
S0084	yeah er well it have to be now
S0082	i mean sometimes that's er that's good um because it it run efficiently if everybody know what they should and shouldn't do
S0084	mm
S0082	but of course the big danger be that um things get fudge
S0084	mhm
S0082	and er and worse you know
S0084	mm
S0082	it's a civil servant make decisions and not an elect politician
S0084	mhm
S0082	so um
S0084	tut well exactly and er you know a lot of stuff she be say just get put in the bin
S0082	mm
S0084	you know if they don't include a return name and address
S0082	mm
S0084	for example
S0082	yeah
S0084	and you they can't respond or er she have people
S0082	mm
S0084	write to her from prison you know she have a guy write from broadmoor
S0082	mm
S0084	which i think be a
S0082	mm
S0084	psychiatric prison
S0082	well
S0084	isn't it
S0082	yeah but it's
S0084	it's full of crazies
S0082	both yeah it's both it's both a prison and it's for the highest level of
S0084	mentally disturb
S0082	of mentally disturb er criminals
S0084	yeah
S0082	mm
S0084	say that
S0082	i mean er not well i dunno whether they call them criminals now it's it's people who would otherwise go to prison
S0084	but they
S0082	but because of their
S0084	can't be hold accountable
S0082	mental situation er they're they go to a um they go there instead
S0084	urgh
S0082	and er er and be keep in er sort of condition which be similar to a prison but they would they're also treat for their condition
S0084	right oh okay
S0082	in a way i'm not sure how much they're treat but um it maybe just they're give lot of drug to keep them quiet i don't know
S0084	yeah
S0082	um
S0084	lobotomy
S0082	yeah
S0084	so um i don't think she's particularly enjoy the job and she's be quite cheeky i think she um
S0082	mm
S0084	she should get the train at eight thirty and be in by ten
S0082	mm
S0084	but sometimes she get the nine o'clock train
S0082	mm
S0084	and get the tube
S0082	mm
S0084	from victoria
S0082	mm
S0084	so it's pretty lazy she roll in at like ten past ten but i think once you're in it's one of those job that once you're in
S0082	mm
S0084	it's very difficult to um fire anybody
S0082	mm often be interest in the civil service since i deal with the rail industry when i when i you know when i work before i um become involve in well er in fact it overlap before i get involve in directors and officer liability which be what i be do at the end before i retire
S0084	mhm
S0082	um for er you know four or five years um because nick er my boss get involve initially
S0084	mm
S0082	er and he pass it all onto me when he get feed up with it um i er advise the rail regulator who be a civil servant
S0084	mm
S0082	er on er insurance matter
S0084	okay
S0082	and basically it be when they privatize the rail er could it use to be a nationalize
S0084	mm
S0082	industry
S0084	mm
S0082	but when they privatize it in the mid nineties um every rail company have to have the same type of er what's call legal liability insurance
S0084	mm
S0082	as every other rail company whether it be the in those days it use to be railtrack which be the biggest part now it's call network rail
S0084	mm
S0082	er they're the organization that manage all the line the signal station and things like that
S0084	right
S0082	but all of the train operators you know like the ones in first capital connect and
S0084	yeah
S0082	east anglia or whatever it's call um er they all have to have um er the same cover you know
S0084	mm
S0082	because if there be a major er rail accident er the government wouldn't want to be in a situation where somebody could say ah why be all these people not able to claim you know they've all be injure why be they not able to claim um er because there's no
S0084	but it's privatize industries that you'd be claim against
S0082	because there's no insurance
S0084	though wouldn't you
S0082	yeah
S0084	you'd be claim against er um the
S0082	but but because it's a public
S0084	the national rail or whatever
S0082	because it's a public service and it be nationalize and
S0084	right
S0082	and then it be privatize
S0084	yeah
S0082	um the government would get some flack er and of course there's you know overlook the political situation you know if you didn't ensure that adequate insurance prevail then people might be in a situation where if the rail company be teeter on the brink of um insolvency
S0084	mm
S0082	you know or
S0084	mm
S0082	go out of business and there be a major crash and it be the rail company's fault and there be no money to pay the um kinda injure people
S0084	mm
S0082	and their insurance be either non existent or defective in some way
S0084	mm
S0082	then of course there'd be a national outcry
S0084	mm
S0082	um and and of course er people who should be er compensate wouldn't be
S0084	mm
S0082	um so my job er a mix job initially and then my job be to make sure that every rail company have the right sort of cover and i get to know um not the rail regulator who be you know quite high up
S0084	mm
S0082	but his staff basically he be the
S0084	right
S0082	head of the department
S0084	yeah
S0082	and i know all his staff and i mean you get a mixture of people as you do in any organization the sort of second in command initially be a woman
S0084	mm
S0082	and she have a er an eastern european name although she be bear in or somewhere
S0084	yeah okay
S0082	er she have a very strong northern accent um and she be quite a difficult woman to deal with
S0084	oh really
S0082	she be yeah she
S0084	in what way
S0082	well in the
S0084	just rude
S0082	in the sense yeah she be very
S0084	unhelpful
S0082	direct and er
S0084	mm
S0082	er and you know er have no sort of small talk or sense of cos sometimes you know once you've finish business of the day
S0084	mm
S0082	you just over a cup of tea or coffee or something you might but she she wouldn't do that and er i i find it very difficult to get er and in fact i never know her really
S0084	mm
S0082	er
S0084	she always just have her professional face on
S0082	yeah er but her assistant who take over when she she move off to another department somewhere er a guy call er he be er he be quite strange you know this big bang theory
S0084	yeah
S0082	well er sheldon remind me of him
S0082	but but not in the sense of be completely isolate from humanity as sheldon seem to be
S0082	but um in be a very intelligent and b very obsessional about things
S0084	mm
S0082	and um it wasn't any um coincidence that um he choose er the rail regulator's office er as the area he want to work in er er in the civil service because he be mad about he know everything about train you know
S0084	aw trainspotter
S0082	he be just a train expert yeah and and he'd go off and see this train or that train but he be er i mean he be a nice guy he be er you know he be a pleasant person to deal with but very intelligent and very obsessional about train
S0084	oh
S0082	er and he have a team er a young chap er who be the sort of the office junior who sort of work his way up he be quite pleasant and a a couple of women er one who leave i i don't know why she leave er er she be the one who have the most in my estimation the most common sense the most practical ability er and she'd be there a long time
S0084	mm
S0082	you know she'd work er in other areas that involve transport you know because of the rail industry be very new to the civil service er they need external advisers like me you know
S0084	mm
S0082	they have them all over the place not just on insurance because obviously the civil service have never deal with well er that's not quite true they do deal with um er train but not in the not in that way you know because the
S0084	excuse me
S0082	the er the government be liable
S0084	okay
S0082	i mean the government strangely enough use to buy insurance and i don't think anybody know that cos people think that if british rail when it be nationalize er cause any accident then the government would pay up
S0084	mm
S0082	um and that be true but the government buy insurance um er for british rail you know so they do have some connection but they didn't have the expertise in lot of areas so they employ people that do um er but this woman i'm just try to think of her name i think it be you know our father
S0084	tut oh
S0082	i think it be i can't remember her first name but she um she use to talk about travel she use to travel in from it be in and it be the little island in the estuary where people in the you know i always think of it as a nineteen thirties nineteen forties nineteen fifties holiday resort
S0084	oh
S0082	um and nobody go there now
S0084	oh right
S0082	mm really small place and um and er it be an island it's get a bridge
S0084	oh wow
S0082	really weird i don't know whether it still work that bridge but they use to have a really weird bridge that use to go up and down to let the boat through it
S0084	oh
S0082	you know like tower bridge open like that
S0084	yeah
S0082	well this have four tower
S0084	yeah
S0082	and the whole bridge lift up as a as a as an entity
S0084	so it would be wet
S0082	yeah
S0084	when you drive across
S0082	so you have you have the road here
S0084	yeah
S0082	and when the bridge be down it it be like that you know just like a like like a road
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0082	but when a boat want to come through they they lift the bridge section up so you have the road either side and a hole in the middle and the and the you know and the the bridge part up there so the boat could go underneath
S0084	oh so they didn't put the
S0082	and then and it come down again
S0084	bridge into the water
S0082	yeah yeah no it be really weird
S0084	oh right
S0082	er really strange
S0084	very strange
S0082	and she use to come from there and and i er i mean she be in the office quite early but er she must've leave her her home at the crack of dawn um that's all
S0084	she didn't like stay in the city during the week or anything
S0082	yeah that's all i that's all i know of her but er the guy who be the rail regulator
S0084	mm
S0082	um er the first one i deal with be a senior civil servant and he basically be just there to keep keep everything move forward you know i mean he be he'd work in other areas i think he'd be involve in rail and things before but um he didn't um he he be basically someone who advise minister
S0084	mm
S0082	on x y and z but when he retire um the person who take over from him be a er solicitor in fact he when he when he'd have enough he go back to be a solicitor
S0084	mm
S0082	and er he be a shocker he be
S0082	a very fiery temper guy
S0084	really
S0082	well er yeah i didn't witness it obviously cos er um i i i didn't work for the civil service but who i tell you about
S0084	mm
S0082	er when we be have lunch once after we'd finish do some business and we just um have a bite quick bite to eat he tell me that er each of the rail company have to have this uniform insurance you know have to er have to comply with all the requirements that er we'd set down and er like all insurance it have to be renew you know they be annual contract and there be a procedure so that the um at specify time the rail company whoever they be whichever rail company it be have to provide information at certain time and they didn't they miss a date and er i be worry because um you know if there be a problem with the renewal and there be an accident you know the the scenario that i describe a little while ago could er could arise you know
S0084	mm
S0082	er injure victims wouldn't be compensate
S0084	mm
S0082	so er obviously i let er know that this company hadn't submit all its detail get in touch with his boss the rail regulator and the rail you know be in his boss's office and the rail regulator phone the chief executive i mean
S0084	bloody hell
S0082	just er completely ignore the insurance department of this rail i mean i can't even remember which rail company it be completely ignore the people that i would deal with completely ignore all the underlings
S0082	phone up the chief executive and get his secretary and say i want to speak to so and so and the secretary say well he's in a meet at the moment and he say well get him out of the meet so the secretary say well i can't do that you know he's with clients or he's with somebody and so on he say look i'm the rail regulator
S0082	and er er and your company hasn't comply with the insurance requirement unless you want to er lose your licence get him out of the meet er and er the chief executive come he's er on the phone accord to obviously his feather be very ruffle at this stage
S0082	and he say well what do you mean by er speak to my secretary like that and he say let me tell you something unless the documentation be on my desk in the morning your licence will be suspend
S0084	huh
S0082	be that clear and that be it so that show you what power these people have
S0084	good grief
S0082	and and he be completely within his right to do it because
S0084	right
S0082	it's a legal requirement they have to have insurance cover er as prescribe and it have to be um evidence
S0084	mm
S0082	in the way er that the rail regulator have set down
S0084	okay
S0082	if they don't
S0084	well at least he be take it very seriously
S0082	if the rail company yeah if the rail company don't comply with that they break the law
S0084	okay
S0082	so er he be just let him know that er the consequences of break the law
S0084	mm
S0082	be lose the licence
S0084	absolutely
S0082	and er
S0084	well at least he be on the
S0082	they er as a result of that they er they get the document on the regulator's desk the next morning er and the insurance advisors
S0084	mm
S0082	to that rail company get the sack
S0084	really
S0082	mm well mm
S0084	it be that serious
S0082	well er you know chief executive
S0084	yeah okay
S0082	be er yank out of a meet and shout at by the by a
S0082	by that civil servant er isn't something that most chief executives be likely to er accept
S0084	take well
S0082	without sort of draw blood somewhere
S0082	yeah
S0084	fair enough hmm
S0082	yeah yeah so i be but um er the um marsh you know it be originally sedgwick who have the contract and obviously marsh take over sedgwick and then at the time i be er work on directors and officer liability
S0084	mm
S0082	um because there's er again another legal requirement in er under the e european union laws for competition er all public body have to er um put their outsource contract up for um you know um tender
S0084	yeah
S0082	er we lose out you know we put in our tender and somebody obviously undercut us so er
S0084	tut
S0082	we lose it after about five years i think in a way it be a relief in a way i be a bite sad because i you know
S0084	yeah
S0082	i'd spend so much time on it and so have nick
S0084	yeah
S0082	i mean i think nick be even though he be very happy for me to deal deal with it all er he'd lose interest at that stage he be we didn't earn that much on it but it be just a sort of prestige thing to have really
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0082	um but one of the um in fact one of the guy that use to work in marsh um who leave and go to another broker he he his area er get the account so he have a lot of inside information cos he work in marsh
S0084	mm
S0082	so he know um i mean he didn't know the he didn't know how much we be get or anything like that but he er i'm sure he have a rough idea and he know you know what sort of level you could go in at to er win the business
S0084	yeah it's just er it's difficult when you invest so much of your time in something
S0082	well yeah i mean we do quite i mean we get pay you know whatever you know we we agree a fee with them and they pay us you know i mean
S0084	mm
S0082	we didn't have a problem um but er it be quite oh yeah there be another guy there call i'd forget about him
S0082	he he he be there at the begin then he leave for a while he be still in the civil service er but he do something else for quite a few then he come back but that be at the time when er just just before we leave we we lose the business so i didn't really know him that well but he he be a nice chap
S0084	mm
S0082	he live in but have a house have a a sort of country um small house in um
