S0509	yeah so drama lesson today work on the monologues
S0510	yeah
S0509	so i'm do the piece from little voice
S0510	that's it yeah
S0509	yeah er it be good
S0510	be it
S0509	it be good yeah she just she be get all of us to show like a little segment of it we have to learn it and do it
S0510	right
S0509	and if i'd know i probably would have learn the whole monologue beforehand but i hadn't i hadn't realise she be go to ask us to perform it off script so
S0510	ah
S0509	just do a little bite like
S0510	yeah
S0509	the first i don't know third of it
S0510	right
S0509	and erm yeah cos i've get scream in mine i have to scream
S0509	so er i
S0510	yeah
S0509	she be like do you want to go into the corridor i be like yes i will go into the corridor so i don't disrupt everyone with my scream every five minutes
S0509	erm so i do but then you awkwardly have people walk through and erm ah like a bite part of the my thing be that i'm hold this like half of a break record
S0510	okay
S0509	which i can actually have when i'm perform it i can buy a load of record break them and put them on the floor
S0510	break them great
S0509	to make the scene which be cool
S0510	yeah
S0509	erm but i so every time someone like walk through i have my hand like clench as if i be hold this record
S0509	and it would just be there and they'd walk past and i i'd have stop and i still have my hand in that position
S0510	right
S0509	it must have look so strange
S0510	bite bizarre yeah
S0509	but i think it i think it go really well like she
S0510	yeah
S0509	i be the last one who have time to do it in the lesson i think a couple of people have to do it next time cos they didn't have time today
S0510	mm mm
S0509	but erm she erm yeah it be her it be who's one of the drama teachers and who's a
S0510	yeah
S0509	like a ta
S0510	mm hm
S0509	and erm they be they give us feedback afterwards and like i think i think they quite like mine although she be say you still need to strengthen your northern accent a bite
S0510	oh great oh right
S0509	i actually forget to do it on the first line
S0510	right
S0509	i get the first line in and i be like yeah i'm mean to be do a northern accent switch into that quickly
S0509	but erm yeah
S0510	what be your first line
S0509	oh it's erm and now you will listen one time one not in a northern accent but anyway
S0510	mm mm hm mm hm
S0509	but yeah and then i scream
S0510	right
S0509	which be fun er yeah she think i have a reasonably original take on it and ban me from watch the movie cos she say that would ruin it
S0510	oh ah
S0509	and i'd end up do it like the movie
S0510	yeah
S0509	but erm the yeah
S0509	she give me like a few pointers of things i need to do like i do some mutter
S0510	mm
S0509	and it need to be mutter but mutter so that it's distinct and audible
S0510	tinct yeah aha yeah
S0509	which yeah be it's like whisper whisper be so hard to act and it's the same with mutter
S0510	right
S0509	cos you you still they still need to be able to hear it
S0510	yeah
S0509	it's crazy but erm and also er her and give me some play to read that be about the northern work class at that time
S0510	class right okay
S0509	cos i be say to her that i'd read up about the play online but there wasn't much about it cos i we have to write this like piece about it
S0510	mm
S0509	and talk about like social historical
S0510	context mm
S0509	and political context i be like well there there isn't any and she be like oh yeah there's a bite but you can like in say you can talk about the whole work class
S0510	work men's club and mm mm
S0509	and yeah that's exactly like a massive part of it
S0510	yeah absolutely
S0509	and erm and you can compare her to other character er like and the stereotype of the northern woman that be in these other play
S0510	right right
S0509	or that aren't in these other play
S0510	yeah
S0509	and yeah so that that'll be interest
S0510	oh that'll be good to do what be the other some of the other play
S0509	oh i get road which be by the same author jim cartwright
S0510	yeah
S0509	and hangmen
S0510	oh i've not hear of that
S0510	yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah cos that's the thing you know the whole erm fabric of their sort of society if you like you know northern towns be tie up in work men's club because you know that's where they all go
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm you know even like where dad be from in originally heck of a lot of work men's club round there because it be what do they call it i've forget what they call it chem city or something because of all the different chemical plant there and so

S0510	you can imagine it be a very you know work class area and a heck of a lot of work class club and everything and wales be very much like that all the miners you know
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	and erm that be sort of where their the epicentre if you like of their social life be really
S0509	yeah and like it play a big part in er the rise and fall of little voice cos erm
S0510	right mm
S0509	this this er talent scout who's not actually all that much but he discover her and he make her sing at these work men's club
S0510	mm hm that's it i remember from the the film

S0509	and would you have pay eighteen pound for a really super cool the cure shirt that nobody else have
S0510	no er well no because you know by comparison that amount of money now so you'd have to do the equivalent wouldn't you
S0509	yeah yeah the equivalent of that
S0510	er well do you know what i don't know that i would have do because i'm not that
S0509	i guess maybe it's a bigger thing now use clothe to like express like a specific
S0510	yeah
S0509	erm taste for a thing
S0510	i mean t shirt have always be that way you know sort of band t shirt and all the rest of it
S0509	yeah
S0510	there's always be a strong kind of you know teen sort of thing to do and not just teen you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	go on erm so even in my day
S0509	even in your day
S0510	it be a very popular thing to do but yeah i mean in term of merchandise sort of outside of music as well
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm maybe not quite so much yeah maybe not quite so much outside of music
S0509	yeah
S0510	which that clearly be but i mean you know yeah
S0509	i i guess you kind of
S0510	yeah the availability wasn't there
S0509	yeah
S0510	and i guess the stream weren't there that there be now you know you know
S0509	like you get so many fan design now
S0510	exactly yeah
S0509	cos i yeah most of to be honest most of the like official design be terrible
S0510	yeah
S0510	mm hm
S0509	for majority of things
S0510	yeah and fan be and everything wouldn't have have such a broad erm
S0509	oh it couldn't have have
S0510	channel as it do now you know
S0509	no no no
S0510	the pipelines weren't there dear the pipelines
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	mm mm so yeah mm
S0509	and it yeah it's just like someone can come up to me and be like ah you like sherlock me too

S0509	which be slightly irritate cos it's like a bunny gonna protect me
S0510	aha
S0509	but erm yeah i do think of something else at one point but i can't think what it be
