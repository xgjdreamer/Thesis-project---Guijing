S0441	she must have get a very low opinion of herself hasn't she to think that that's alright
S0439	massively low opinion
S0441	it's quite sad really
S0439	to let someone do that
S0441	very sad i think
S0439	mm i mean just like on the last day just kind of like hang over us
S0441	yeah
S0439	like
S0441	probably ruin it a bite like taint it
S0439	cos yeah cos cos the thing be like because she didn't have a phone i give her my old one to borrow
S0441	yeah
S0439	and you know that the only reason she didn't she want she need a phone like she be really panic about it be because she want to like message him
S0441	yeah but then you wonder what he might have might have do if you know
S0439	yeah well that's what she he say he's like you you've be you've be weird with me this for the last two days and she go i didn't i don't even have a phone like

S0439	like she doesn't normally she have like like a day or two abroad or something but
S0441	yeah
S0439	the sim card only have data like five hundred megabyte like a really pathetic amount that cost load of money so she didn't take the phone out during the day and stuff and she be like well normally i'd send you know like in picture the things i saw or but i obviously couldn't cos i didn't have a phone i be like yeah he should understand that
S0441	sound like a nutter
S0439	because he tell her she she when we be go round she message him in the even and be like oh it really remind me of when we go to rome together it be such a nice holiday and
S0441	mm
S0439	i'm so glad we do it we'll have to go again some time you know like i'm so look forward to like go on holiday with you again and have a romantic time he say to her that the think of her go on holiday and say those things to him while he be me with while she be with me make her make him feel sick like her
S0441	wow
S0439	be with me on holiday make him feel sick
S0441	be this he's so control
S0439	yeah and i be like
S0441	she need to get away from him immediately
S0439	yeah i be like like i'm not i respect however you're gonna deal with it either way
S0441	none of this be right
S0439	no i i say i be like no offence but a boy er your boyfriend shouldn't dictate to you who you hang out with shouldn't dictate who or where you go on holiday
S0441	and how often you text
S0439	and shouldn't emotionally blackmail you
S0441	no
S0439	i be like this behaviour be and then i put like two asterisk whatever word you want to use to fill this space because there be so many word that could be use to describe that behaviour it's like control possessive completely inappropriate slightly psychotic like
S0441	just
S0439	wrong
S0441	wrong wrong
S0439	and i say and i
S0441	on so many level
S0439	and then like apparently last night he be he be back to be fine with her again and i be like
S0441	well because he'd get her where he want her
S0439	yeah he want get her back in the country
S0441	yeah
S0439	i be like that
S0441	she need to
S0439	that flip er that mental flip
S0441	that's not normal
S0439	be not normal to go from be so aggressive and rude and obnoxious to oh yeah we're okay now be not
S0441	with no explanation
S0439	no no
S0441	you should at least be angry for a couple of days if he's
S0439	yeah
S0441	that angry he's just he's just get her exactly where he want her
S0439	mm
S0441	right round his little finger
S0439	just i just can't i just don't wanna deal with it anymore like
S0441	no
S0439	when he be just be rude to her it's kind of like well you've choose to put yourself in this position so
S0441	yeah
S0439	all i can do really do be support you but when he start slag me off
S0441	well that's a different story
S0439	no no no i don't need to put up with that shit
S0441	no
S0439	i be like sort it out or i'll sort it out and
S0441	really weird
S0439	if i sort it out it won't it won't ever
S0441	and he must have know that she would have tell you as well
S0439	yeah
S0441	that's the thing like
S0439	exactly
S0441	he must have know that so he be pretty much say that to your face
S0439	yeah
S0441	he know that
S0439	and pretty much
S0439	tell her that he he want to break up with her
S0441	yeah because she be see another person
S0439	because she be go on holiday with her friend who apparently upset him in july
S0441	jesus christ get a grip
S0439	i know like haven't even like
S0441	it's
S0439	you didn't like very much
S0441	mm
S0439	but that would never be an issue like
S0441	yeah i'd never blackmail you about him
S0439	yeah like i can't believe you're see break up with him like you'd never like you never you never
S0441	if you go and see i be never see you
S0439	yeah how be i go to you just don't do that to your friends
S0439	or you or your boyfriend or your like just because your boyfriend or girlfriend doesn't get on with your friends or stuff like it just isn't an issue but
S0441	no
S0439	for him it really be
S0441	be he hot
S0439	no not at all
S0441	i be gonna say have he get any any redeem feature
S0439	no no
S0441	no he's just a nasty
S0439	dick
S0441	horrible person
S0439	he's just a bully and i think the reason he doesn't like it when i'm with her be because he know that i be a bite stronger and i'll say
S0441	yeah
S0439	what i think and he's worry that i'll influence her or i don't know
S0441	be the guy that's a muslim no
S0439	no
S0441	be that a different guy
S0439	no that be the old boyfriend who be just as control and as awful and as freaky
S0441	oh she need to
S0439	she's go for the worst men
S0441	she need to have a break of men and get
S0439	mm
S0441	some confidence in herself and er have a bite of me time
S0439	exactly
S0441	ah
S0439	not be with these fuck dicks but she won't do anything about it
S0441	no cos that obviously that's what she think be normal i guess
S0439	yeah or acceptable
S0441	which be awful
S0439	it's like every time i've see her since last november since berlin every time i've see her they there's be a problem like he
S0441	which be so strange isn't it
S0439	yeah
S0441	to even think that's okay
S0439	it's not yeah it's not okay like berlin be bad because he tell her they have no spark when we go to the v and a she be upset because he tell his feel hadn't grow since christmas and he didn't love her yet
S0441	it's almost like he's make everything every time she want to branch out on her own he's make it all about him again
S0439	yeah
S0441	and like not let her
S0439	yeah
S0441	go away from him
S0439	he's like i don't wanna ruin your weekend and talk to you about it now well you already have
S0441	well
S0439	ruin why
S0441	you can't say that and then just be like
S0439	why be you
S0441	we'll don't want to talk about it now
S0439	yeah
S0441	such an idiot
S0439	why even be angry about it
S0441	they're just obviously not mean
S0439	they're not mean to be together and until she realise that
S0441	yeah as i've say it's only her isn't it who can make that decision
S0439	mm
S0441	which be unfortunate
S0439	as i say in my message today i be like his behaviour wasn't acceptable but it's your decision on how you deal with that i just want it to be okay
S0441	see when i think when you start make excuse for someone's behaviour that's when it's get a bite
S0439	she she apologise for it
S0441	yeah
S0439	like after my message like i say i just want us to work it out like i don't want there to be any problems and she be like yeah i'm so sorry about how i vent you i be so untactful erm i'm so sorry
S0441	yeah
S0439	why be and i be like
S0441	she's
S0439	why be you
S0441	yeah
S0439	why be you apologise for his for his for his behaviour
S0441	yeah
S0439	it's his behaviour not yours
S0441	but that's what i mean she must know that it's wrong
S0439	yeah yeah i think she do
S0441	otherwise she wouldn't apologise would she she'd just say that be she'd that's probably be on on his sort of wavelength wouldn't she
S0439	yeah
S0441	but
S0439	she must know that it's not right she's just i think she's just afraid of be alone
S0441	oh how sad
S0439	i know it be sad to a point where it's self inflict and sadistic but to keep put yourself like i don't even i don't wanna keep put myself through it i don't know how she's manage to keep put herself through it just
S0441	she could do with therapy

S0441	i'll see what they say
S0439	mm
S0441	they they might say pay the next one then do it after that
S0439	yeah yeah it's annoy like we could just leave it and the other people could pay it but
S0441	i know
S0439	they don't like if you give us thirty pound a month we'll just
S0439	be pay the internet for you cos it's just such an annoy thing to do because they're gonna have to uninstall or they're gonna take the box and they're gonna have to wait three weeks for someone to come and fit another box for them
S0441	yeah it's stupid
S0439	it's completely redundant it's like
S0441	it should be a lot easier shouldn't it really
S0439	yeah internet shouldn't be this difficult
S0441	no it really shouldn't
S0439	like if we actually get yeah if we'd actually get to speak to them i'd be like do you want to like leave it in here and you pay it but they just it's that company be just shit
S0441	well they're moneymaking aren't they they just wanna get your
S0439	yeah
S0441	as much money as they want i guess
S0439	yeah even though wifi apparently accord the government be what like isn't it something like erm a basic need nowadays
S0441	be it
S0439	yeah
S0441	what along with water and air
S0439	along with water and well apparently so apparently the government be
S0441	oh
S0439	make it a priority to make internet and broadband and stuff like a basic thing
S0441	what's it's weird i be say this be gonna sound really stupid but i be say to it's weird to think that like it would be weird if you go like go somewhere in england and and you didn't get wifi whereas somewhere like i dunno africa as an example there it's like like you know you wouldn't ever get it
S0439	yeah
S0441	i mean in some place it's like
S0439	yeah
S0441	normal that you don't get it which be weird
S0439	well that's the strange thing actually cos i didn't i don't use my phone abroad cos obviously the data cost so much money to use but wifi i do in bratislava everywhere have open wifi like
S0441	do they
S0439	every café every bar every museum you could get wifi in naples you generally couldn't get wifi anywhere
S0441	yeah
S0439	it be so bizarre it's just like
S0441	it be isn't it
S0439	how be it that an eastern european country have wifi and fuck italy
S0441	yeah
S0439	doesn't
S0441	it's so strange
S0439	very bizarre but also be the stingiest person ever
S0439	it's hilarious like like she'll be really she'll record it like say you go on holiday with someone you know like you all spend two euros here or you all sub someone two euros there blah blah blah i think anything under five euros i just write off but she'd be like oh wait a minute like i give you a euro to go to the toilet yeah
S0439	i pay two euros earlier for you to do what be your point
S0441	oh no
S0439	yeah so like literally like keep up a track record so i'm like you're actually
S0441	she's keep her pennies
S0439	she do but then the moment you spend any of your money on her
S0441	mm
S0439	it's it doesn't like
S0441	it's fine
S0439	yeah it's fine erm and like we go to this café like it be a really nice café it be like quite a posh one by the palace and stuff and we go for cake and coffee and she realise that the the coffee be a bite too expensive it be five euros which be expensive but you're in a café by a fuck palace you know
S0441	not that bad
S0439	and she order water
S0441	oh no
S0439	i know i be like be and i say be you not order anything because you're cos you're be stingy and don't want it to she go yeah oh actually no no it's not it's because i i don't wanna have a sugar rush if i have a hot chocolate and a piece of cake i think you're you're just lie to me
S0439	and lie to yourself like you just don't wanna pay like
S0441	you're on holiday
S0439	yeah
S0441	pay
S0439	and you're on holiday just pay fuck five euros for hot chocolate
S0441	yeah and then just lay off hot chocolate when you get home
S0439	yeah stop be so stingy
S0441	oh
S0439	you stingy bitch like you're gonna see her when we go to a restaurant she'd like pick one of the cheapest things on the
S0439	it's so weird when you're with someone who's like that
S0441	be she struggle with money or not
S0439	no not really
S0441	i guess not if she's go on holiday and stuff
S0439	yeah i wouldn't say she's struggle like she doesn't save very much but she isn't
S0441	what do she work as
S0439	she be a market executive at
S0441	oh of course yeah
S0439	i think she's on she's on about twenty four erm then what she get about sixteen hundred maybe no maybe a bite less maybe fifteen hundred or something
S0441	that isn't that
S0439	yeah
S0441	that
S0439	she's pay six hundred in rent and yeah she pay about sixteen hundred in not sixteen six hundred in rent and then the rest be pretty much disposable income
S0441	mm
S0439	like she have a i don't even think she she doesn't even pay her own phone contract her mum pay it for her
S0441	where do she live
S0439	in in so it's that's why it's so expensive but fifteen hundred minus six hundred that leave her what nine hundred quid disposable income
S0441	that's pretty good
S0439	pretty good each month like if i have that much disposable income each month i'd be bloody happy i'd have the best wardrobe ever
S0441	well exactly
S0439	so i'm not entirely sure what she's moan about but yeah no five euros for a cup of hot chocolate be just too much for her tip er tip her over the edge i think okay
S0441	if you say so
S0439	god
S0441	well each to their own
