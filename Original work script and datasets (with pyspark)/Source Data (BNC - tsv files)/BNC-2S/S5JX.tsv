S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	so

S0618	as we be say
S0619	i'm just feel really really good
S0618	yay
S0619	just don't know how to put it into word
S0619	just feel really good
S0618	good
S0619	but it's so i just also feel like from an outside perspective and probably really bore
S0619	that be that be the student you know always finish first
S0618	oh yeah yeah yeah i i know him yeah
S0619	erm you know erm
S0618	do he what do he tell you you be bore
S0619	no no no no no i've just overlap two conversations that i be talk
S0618	oh oh okay right
S0619	the first one
S0618	you be have two conversations but you
S0619	yeah
S0618	just sort of forget to tell me
S0618	okay
S0619	we drive past him and there he be erm right erm from an outside perspective i probably look really bore i go to bed at ten o'clock and i wake up between six and seven and i you know eat porridge and exercise and drink water and
S0618	uhu
S0619	don't i'm not drink so i probably look really bore but i've do all that stuff i've do the drink and the party and
S0618	yeah i
S0619	you don't get anything out of it
S0618	i find i have phase though
S0619	yeah
S0618	do do you have phase where
S0619	oh yes really cyclical
S0618	you know yeah you'd be on a fit one for a while and then
S0619	mm mm
S0618	it sort of go by the wayside for a bite
S0619	yeah and we're sort of i think we've have this conversation before where like for me it's from january to june be good and then from july to sort of christmas be bad
S0618	yeah why why be that why that sort of turnaround point i mean i notice that coincide with the end of term so
S0619	erm i think it's
S0618	be it then er yay party
S0619	because yeah it's like the sort of transitional period of the job you know from in summer i'm erm you know er do whatever i want
S0619	and i don't have a routine and i'm live erm at home
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i don't have a gym and i can't follow the the sort of erm regime er and then from september to christmas it's like settle in to a new life
S0618	okay
S0619	and new place and yes i do the i go to the gym in this period for example but you know you're try to make friends so you're go out you're socialise eat more drink more
S0618	mm mm
S0619	and then it's christmas
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and then in january you've make the connections you've get the friends erm so i dunno
S0618	yeah
S0619	you may disagree
S0618	be be you no but be be you generally in a different place each i mean geographically in a different place each june to december or january to june you be talk about sort of be at your parents' and then finish there and go somewhere
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so like it's be last year and this year
S0619	mm mm mm mm
S0618	next year possibly somewhere in spain be
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so i mean you know and what what precede that be if you sort of build up a pattern over a number of years where you feel you need to be
S0619	oh
S0618	quote unquote less healthy and get drink a lot and party and make friends
S0619	probably yeah because at uni that's your sort of lifestyle as well
S0618	okay
S0619	from september to christmas it's fresher's and you're you know erm you know the emphasis from september especially be you know party and even in the summer you're see your friends from home and you're back at your parents' house er and then from january to summer you've gotta work harder exams be come it's like a lot more serious it so like and i work well under routine and with you know this go to the gym go to uni study blah blah blah so it's probably since two thousand and nine that i've have this erm
S0618	mm
S0619	two thousand and nine since i've have this sort of pattern
S0618	yeah i'm wonder be this sort of a
S0619	don't know
S0618	erm judgment of january to june good july to december bad
S0619	i don't think so i don't think so i i don't think i've really sort of
S0618	okay
S0619	think about it
S0618	so it's not a problem
S0619	mm no it's not a problem
S0618	so you feel healthier for the first six months of a calendar year and less healthy for the second six months
S0618	you know it's not a problem don't worry about it i guess
S0619	yeah it's and we're not talk in term of erm
S0618	oh i can take my fleece off er
S0619	yeah i suppose i cos i'm still exercise in the second half of the year though without any sort of er goals or motivation
S0618	yeah and with alcohol
S0619	er and with alcohol
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	don't know and i think there's some sort of social condition i suppose that you know you're in january you're ready to sort of get fit for the new year and you're walk towards the summer bikini body for example
S0618	mm
S0619	and then from september to christmas you're like oh well fuck it what's the point
S0618	it's christmas
S0619	it's you're get up to christmas you're not gonna have to take your clothe off in public so what's the point
S0618	yeah you can wear more
S0619	it's yeah it's winter especially live here it's really cold
S0618	mm
S0619	so
S0618	i suppose it speak a lot as well about perceptions of other people and what other people's opinions might be
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm you know it's not necessarily a bad thing either because
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i think we all want to be love and we all want to be like we all want to have friendships but i do wonder be everybody have these perceptions of
S0619	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	of oh i need to be this particular way at this time of year and then
S0619	aha
S0618	it's almost like you know you start see those things on facebook about hooray now i can stop shave my legs now until march but then why do you have to shave your legs anyway who say
S0619	yeah aha yeah exactly
S0618	so
S0619	so yeah and talk sort of more generally than than from me personally for that kinda thing
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos i realise a long time ago you know if i'm fatter or hairier or whatever someone somewhere will still have sex with me so it doesn't really matter
S0619	like i've learn that i've get over it okay people really don't care you know they just don't touch your legs if they're disgust
S0619	just don't do it
S0618	ah
S0619	you know
S0618	okay
S0619	do you know what i mean like you don't have to no one care apart from you
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so more generally though i think people start to feel relax from the end of summer onwards
S0618	yerah
S0619	about their appearance
S0618	but then why do you care i mean you know be it a problem that you care be it do it matter that you care
S0619	no no
S0618	fair enough
S0619	don't think so at all
S0618	yeah
S0619	where be we go we're not on the motorway
S0618	i've no idea i'm kinda follow the sign and satnav
S0619	car at the front

S0618	but do say an hour and three minutes about about twenty minutes ago and now it say er time to go an hour so
S0619	so we're just
S0618	we're in a space time warp thing
S0619	i think just keep go forward

S0619	uhu uhu
S0618	erm and you just sort of keep an eye out for them perch on fence post
S0619	nice you'll just have to come and drive along this motorway every so often
S0618	yeah it's definitely a this motorway thing
S0619	yeah
S0618	i suppose now
S0618	it's proper poland completely cos there's just so many hill and
S0619	there be that
S0618	yeah
S0619	yay
S0618	it's really nice
S0619	yes yes it be i start look at job in spain yesterday but so far
S0618	oh
S0619	not a lot go on there's a couple of school advertise already but i just think like
S0618	yeah
S0619	why be you advertise in january for september
S0618	yeah
S0618	somebody's tell me i can't remember who it be erm that it's as well to get a job last minute
S0619	yeah it be
S0618	quite often because if you if you're promise one like months in advance then they can at the time say ah sorry it's go
S0619	yeah like don't be too hasty if i accept a job now
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	all that's gonna happen be i'm still look and gonna get a better job and turn these poor people down or
S0618	or they're gonna keep look get a better person with more experience and let you down so
S0619	yeah yeah exactly
S0618	so
S0619	so
S0618	it's a lose lose
S0619	what i'm gonna try and do be get a job through someone that i know
S0618	definitely
S0619	rather than
S0618	yeah
S0619	do this sort of random stuff but
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos i know people who live in barcelona in malaga in you know the ideal place that i wanna be rather than
S0618	aha
S0619	you know go out on a whim and just find some job somewhere
S0618	yeah yeah i i from what i gather as well spain be like the international hub of tefl teach or one of them
S0619	yeah it be
S0618	and there be so many bad bad bad school out there
S0619	yeah it's super competitive to get good ones
S0618	yeah unreliable payment and blah blah blah and i think the good school can demand years of experience
S0619	yeah
S0618	er so
S0619	yeah
S0618	it's a tricky one but if you get a recommendation brilliant
S0619	yeah we'll see what happen
S0618	mm
S0619	i'm not worry like i'm really not worry about it i know that i'll get a job
S0618	oh god course you will yeah
S0619	it's not it's not anything to be concern about at all
S0618	and you wouldn't know where you're mean to end up i think there's
S0619	yeah
S0618	a fair degree of universe'll sort it out for you
S0619	absolutely
S0618	you know you've just gotta put yourself our there make the effort and look and what you end up with be what you're mean to end up with
S0619	mm mm
S0618	it'll be perfect
S0619	yeah because i think like i think it's true you know i don't know whether you know you how you feel about this the line everything happen for a reason but last year go to er and have you know at the time it be pretty shit but look back it wasn't that shit you know erm it need to happen i need that bird
S0618	well spot
S0619	i need that bird
S0618	you be a buzzard expert
S0619	er
S0618	i love buzzards that's just beautiful
S0619	i need
S0619	i need that year i need it i need to be alone i need to sort my head out and blah blah blah and all these things so it need to happen and whether i appreciate it at the time i dunno i think i start to actually but it need to happen so
S0618	it's good it's good if you can look back now i mean you know it maybe kinda suck at the time
S0619	mm
S0618	i suppose any period of feel not good be not necessarily a desirable thing but at least you can look back and have a positive take on it that's really good
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah i've give i'm give myself a little bite of a hard time about where i'm at here now because i get really bore sometimes
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and i
S0618	i do think part of it be maybe i need this just stop
S0619	yeah
S0618	time
S0619	yeah
S0618	you know take a deep breath i've not get enough teach work at the moment to keep me busy and not bore
S0619	mm
S0618	in the meantime i'm tend to do erm course on on the web i've get a few on the go at the moment hippy dippy relate stuff which be you know quite nice it's nice to have that
S0619	mm
S0618	time go within but yeah i dunno i feel like i need more human contact
S0619	mm
S0618	but then again as i be say earlier today sort of take my lead from nature a bite nature isn't so social in a way but
S0619	yeah
S0618	everything's kind of freeze in stasis right now and all of the work be go on on the inside you don't see it on the outside and then spring come and everything blossom and bloom so even though i'm not necessarily enjoy it that much sometimes i do
S0619	mm
S0618	feel it's a necessary chunk of time
S0619	mm
S0618	do the inner work prepare for the spring time when things will blossom
S0619	yeah
S0618	so
S0619	exactly
S0618	yeah it need to be do sometimes
S0619	it do and i think erm not enough people have the luxury of do it i think it's a good thing i think it isn't sort of erm i dunno luxury's not the right word but you know you know what i mean like not enough people have this time time to themselves time
S0618	yeah
S0619	without rush erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	er this kind of just
S0618	just be
S0619	er
S0618	time
S0619	yeah yeah be
S0618	be rather than do i suppose
S0619	yeah
S0618	or do on the inside but you know
S0619	yeah
S0618	not a lot of be in not a lot of do in physicality or be but the inside there's quite a lot go on
S0619	mm
S0618	so yeah
S0619	and you know last year i use to really envy my friends at home who seem to be do excite things
S0619	like go for lunch
S0618	mm
S0619	isn't a big deal we do it all the time like this
S0618	yeah
S0619	me last year you know i never go for lunch who be i gonna go for lunch with er but
S0618	ah
S0619	no i no i
S0618	ah
S0619	i do go for lunch occasionally but you know what i mean like erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	i use to be sort of envious but there's also a lot to be say for you know not do not do
S0618	yeah
S0619	take it for yourself
S0618	you be do quite a bite of that the end of last year i wonder if your sort of party party hit a bite of a peak
S0619	yeah
S0618	it be i sort of get the impression you go a bite i'm not do this any more no fuck off i'm just gonna sit here and stare at the wall now thank you
S0619	yeah i do that's exactly what i do
S0618	yes good for you
S0619	er and i say i be have this conversation with and i be just like it be way too much and it be too intense and it be always in my bedroom
S0618	it be yeah
S0619	and i just think
S0618	in your space
S0619	fuck it i didn't sign up for this like
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm it's nice have friends it's nice do stuff but not all the time not with people that i don't particularly wanna spend time with
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	and not always in your physical space
S0619	and not in my space and
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know ah i'm not gonna forgive a member of this group ever
S0618	which particular australian i think yeah
S0618	the one you go to see yesterday
S0619	er like
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm i'm just not not play that game no way
S0618	fair enough i mean you
S0619	yeah and er that's what i learn last year as well
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know it's
S0618	and you can also change your mind
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos i think what's right for you in one particular moment might not be right in three days three weeks three months three years
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you have the right to change your mind at any moment or not
S0619	yeah
S0618	so
S0619	yeah
S0618	no good for you
S0619	you don't have to be friends with people end of sentence
S0618	you don't have to be yeah
S0619	you know if you say i don't really like them why be i spend time with them that's
S0618	mm
S0619	okay like you don't have to be everybody's friend
S0618	yeah
S0619	mm
S0618	i agree
S0619	and don't spend time with people just cos just because you you it's there the option's just there
S0618	yeah yes interest you be say about that i'm think about sometimes i'm desperate for human contact but then i'm not that desperate it's a bite like
S0619	mm
S0618	you know be vegetarian if i'm hungry at what point be i desperate enough to eat a steak
S0619	yeah
S0618	probably i dunno i'd probably starve first i really feel quite repulse by steak or the think of it so yeah would i sacrifice certain other aspects of myself just for human contact no i don't think i would
S0619	mm
S0618	but then i don't know you know so how be you do temperature wise
S0619	i'm okay
S0618	blast it up a little bite
S0619	i'm alright
S0618	good yeah no it's interest and i do think as well when that be i i think over christmas maybe i should've offer to have have some of those events over at mine but you know that say my i love my neighbour
S0619	mm
S0618	erm you know she's an older lady she go to bed eight o'clock nine o'clock
S0619	yeah
S0618	she's up five o'clock six o'clock
S0619	uhu
S0618	and i wouldn't want to have much noise
S0619	yeah
S0618	beyond eight or nine
S0619	yeah
S0618	so with that in mind that's not such a realistic proposition
S0619	mm yeah
S0618	yeah the wall be paper thin i can hear her talk on the telephone
S0619	but like especially have lose or have never have this kind of erm
S0619	empathy you know er er you know of like turn music down and would just sort of turn it back up and go what be you do
S0618	yeah
S0619	i'd go well one i want to be able to talk to er people in this room without have to shout over your shit choice of music
S0619	and i don't wanna upset the neighbour but he just can't see things from anyone else's perspective apart from
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know him right there in his world in his moment erm and it's
S0618	do you know i wonder be this a bite of a bloke thing i've be on a lot of aeroplanes and i do this little experiment sometimes
S0619	be it with arm rest
S0618	yes
S0619	yes
S0618	just to see who choose to put their elbow all the way across the arm rest
S0619	yeah
S0618	men generally go for it straight away women will generally wait and see if i use the armrest and if i haven't use it within twenty minutes half an hour
S0619	yeah
S0618	they'll use it
S0619	yeah
S0618	have you do the same
S0619	i've i well i've not but erm i follow someone on twitter who do a year of not move out of the way for men
S0618	ah
S0619	so in the street if a man walk towards her she wouldn't move out of the way she'd just carry on walk er and she get call all sort of name have all sort of abuse shout at her cos she just refuse to move off her path and she do it with arm rest
S0619	and she be on
S0618	who be shout at her
S0619	no men no
S0618	she be only do it with men she be a woman men uhu
S0619	only only do it with men uhu
S0618	okay
S0619	erm and she do a thing with the armrest and she you know er it get to the point where it be like comical they be just push up against each other's elbow
S0619	on the tube
S0619	and when it be time for her you know he be like tutting and shake his head at her
S0618	wow
S0619	and she stand up and go you don't always get the fuck armrest you've gotta compromise sometimes this be what it's like be a woman all the time
S0619	er and she just you know stand up for herself and things you know she would say to men on bus er if they be sit next to her please can you close your legs you're take up my space
S0618	wow
S0619	er and you know it's i think it's brave erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know she sort of stand up for herself and sort of
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know women's right to their own space or to the armrest or to the space on the bus
S0618	yeah it's interest
S0619	yeah so it's kind of play in my mind a lot this kind of thing
S0618	i do wonder also if she's experience a bite of that because she's look for it she's expect it so
S0619	uhu yeah
S0618	the universe have deliver back what she's expect to see i think there's probably
S0619	yeah
S0618	you know a large degree of that but also there be a there be a valid point there you know i've experience that myself
S0619	uhu
S0618	with just my sort of experiment
S0619	yeah
S0618	this kind of thing flash
S0618	thing so or me that i might just slip of the edge of the road
S0619	oh dear
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's interest it's an interest one anyway but i think yeah it be what be i watch or listen to and it be about how men and women view things and
S0618	yeah
S0619	this just sort of lack of i don't know manners and you know i just don't think a woman or a girl would ever do that
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm don't know
S0618	no it's interest it be interest i wonder if a lot of it be sort of upbringing and
S0619	mm mm
S0618	you know i suppose my generation be the last generation where the woman stay at home and cook and clean wash and iron and basically make life as easy as possible for her breadwinner husband
S0619	mm mm
S0618	mind you say that you know my mum do go out to work as well she do both cos she be a superhuman so i guess my parents' generation be the kinda transition generation
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i be bear what early seventies
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and my parent be bear mid forties
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so yeah they be probably the last generation of that my generation certainly both partner go out to work equally although still domestic chores and child raise i suppose it's predominantly still perceive as a female role but i do think even my mum even though she go out to work she still do all of the chores and
S0619	yeah
S0618	she i i suppose i learn from that that the female role be to make things or make life easy as possible for the male because they have the important bread win win role so to carry out yeah no i guess there's a lot of that so i guess that's now be challenge and come undo but i do wonder with your woman as well though it come across as pretty aggressive walk in a particular line and not get out of the way
S0619	mm mm
S0618	which
S0619	yeah it be say you know i'm look for a fight i suppose
S0618	yeah yeah yeah
S0619	or be it or be it just sort of challenge er societal norms or what be expect
S0618	yeah it
S0619	it's expect that we're gonna move out of the way
S0618	it's an interest experiment i suppose you know i've do it from with the armrest experiment
S0619	yeah
S0618	from the other way i've not take the armrest to see if a man will take it and find that they do quite quickly
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and i've find that when i'm sit next to a woman it take them a long time but they do eventually take the arm rest
S0619	yeah
S0618	so i've do it form the viewpoint of i'm not take the armrest
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	and then observe what do
S0619	yeah rather than try to take it yeah
S0618	yeah whereas your woman have say right it's mine
S0619	yeah
S0618	which i suppose even a woman might find that a challenge i don't know yeah i mean equally if she be to take a line walk down the street refuse to get out of the way of women
S0619	mm mm
S0618	would she be get a bite of verbal abuse
S0619	yeah abuse in the same way i dunno
S0618	don't you just hate this i pull out to overtake this car and the car speed up you dick arse anyway where be we right
S0619	erm
S0619	we must be nearly there be we
S0618	yeah be we nearly there yet i need a wee
S0619	i know do you
S0618	yeah i do
S0618	i'm not desperate old age
S0618	we must go before we leave and go when we get there if there's an opportunity along the way even if we don't really need one we'll have one anyway cos you never know
S0619	you never know i i need to do some kind of exercise
S0618	pelvic floor
S0619	yeah i do it's
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's
S0618	you can do em now
S0619	it's
S0618	and squeeze
S0619	i you know erm especially it's okay like in day to day life oh no it's not okay
S0619	alright here's the story so erm i've sort of google these kind of things and it's link to have asthma
S0618	oh wow
S0619	not because of your breathe but because of the cough i cough more than normal people because of my asthma
S0618	right
S0619	erm and repetitive or chronic cough can lead to problems with your pelvic floor
S0618	how interest
S0619	cos these muscle be be er relax when you cough or something like this anyway erm so that happen have be happen erm so i don't notice it so much in my day to day life unless i sort of cough and sneeze and really need the toilet or
S0618	okay
S0619	in the gym
S0618	yeah
S0619	if i'm skip with a skip rope
S0618	oh my god don't skip don't skip
S0619	i have to go to the toilet every five minutes
S0618	or star jump yeah
S0618	start jump be the worst i can't do more than five star jump and not wee
S0619	like
S0618	but anyway
S0619	i've have to yeah i've really think about go to see someone
S0619	er yeah but there's like things that you can do or muscle that you can build i mean not like your pelvic floor muscle but if you improve like your posture for example it help
S0618	yeah
S0619	everything be connect
S0618	might find it help your lungs as well
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah it's not be so bad and i manage to get through the winter touch wood
S0618	good oh
S0619	without any really bad sicknesses or illnesses so
S0618	i keep get sick this winter
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i buy something back from england it go and now you know it's back again
S0619	mm mm
S0618	it's a lung thing i look it up in my eastern philosophies book and it's erm yeah er a shortage of lung qi which be also connect with the spleen and also connect with the bowel
S0618	yeah eat white foods be mean to be incredibly good mushroom and things like that and then there be some qigong exercise
S0619	marshmallows
S0618	no not the pink ones
S0619	oh
S0618	yeah there's some qigong exercise as well
S0619	mm
S0618	which i've get to do read actually you might might enjoy some of those
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah and strengthen these this particular erm meridian yeah well the eastern philosophies they talk about sort of twelve major meridians and lung be one of them and so yeah might help you to know what the exercise be
S0619	mm
S0618	for the lung practise those as well might help with the the old pelvic floor too if it's all interconnect which of course it be
S0619	the old pelvic floor
S0618	oh dear
S0619	look at the birdhouse
S0618	oh that's cute isn't it yeah no there definitely be issue as you get older i can remember do circuit
S0619	ah
S0618	erm back in northern ireland at this er tiny gym at the bottom of a peninsular and as one of the instructors there really lovely guy and he'd just qualify he be quite nervous about
S0619	mm mm
S0618	do class and you know be up there talk in front of people but he'd be do the reception for a long time so we all know him and be very sort of sympathetic towards him and for his first circuit class he have load of star jump load of box jump
S0619	oh god
S0618	load of burpees erm i say to him quietly afterwards you know if you get sort of class of predominantly mid thirties to mid fifties women these be not good exercise
S0619	mm mm
S0618	without sort of tena lady there's a bite of an issue here and he be completely unaware of it
S0619	yeah
S0618	but you think they would teach them things like that
S0619	yeah i don't think they do though
S0618	i mean you know equally they can just add some pelvic floor exercise into the circuit class
S0619	yeah at the end
S0618	yeah right just sit and clench
S0618	relax and clench and relax
S0618	okay repeat for sixty second
S0619	oh no
S0619	no yeah i just don't think they think of it like that
S0618	no i suppose anything with the south of the belly button tend to be a bite taboo still
S0619	mm mm
S0618	especially in northern ireland erm and i suppose in poland i think catholic or especially religious countries
S0619	mm mm
S0618	do tend to be a bite fuck up when it come to
S0619	oh
S0618	talk about life the universe and everything
S0619	in the gym with my trainer yesterday he be spot me when i be squat er so he have he be stand behind me and he be bend with me
S0618	uhu
S0619	erm as i be bend with his hand like under my armpits just to help me get back up and afterwards i be like i'm so sorry that be just so weird
S0619	that be like we weren't touch
S0618	yeah

S0618	yeah
S0619	and i find that really weird i be like i get it
S0618	which you can understand
S0619	yeah

S0618	fair enough
S0619	she be like if you wanna rub your arse against someone's crotch it's always appropriate if it's consensual by both party but
S0619	in a gym set where you're fully clothe and you're hold a weight on your shoulder
