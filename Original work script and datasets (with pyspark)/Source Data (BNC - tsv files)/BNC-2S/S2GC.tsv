S0144	okay what's the problem
S0024	right so well i be i'm just a bite confuse really
S0144	with what
S0024	right you've get to compare the examples of the academic text feature here yeah with this text
S0144	yeah
S0024	and i it's
S0144	where do it say that
S0024	really hard the that one
S0144	mm
S0024	erm if you turn back to their self study
S0144	yeah
S0024	it be erm find examples of these feature in economic malaria in one point three
S0144	oh really
S0024	this one and it's really hard really hard
S0144	oh i didn't do that
S0024	so
S0144	oh hang on i'd better get my book
S0024	it's it's their self study thing
S0144	oh where's my book
S0024	but erm suppose to go over it in class but there must be so many examples of it what be you gonna do just go round the class and well yeah that that's an example of hedge yes that's an example
S0144	no you just have
S0024	or
S0144	to take one example
S0024	so basically an example of complexity they could read any sentence from this from this this faculty of write and say that's an example of complexity
S0144	yeah so i don't think you can spend much time with it
S0024	explicitness
S0144	oh i have get the avu book sorry
S0024	yeah
S0144	don't get excite
S0024	well at least i can i be gonna think i be gonna have to go in really early
S0144	no when be we gonna have dinner
S0024	i don't know i think i would be do with this fairly quickly but it's take longer than i think
S0144	right
S0024	like
S0144	er
S0024	see to me i'm still confuse hedge an argument i would say you you put you blame it on somebody else don't you
S0144	what
S0024	when you hedge an argument
S0144	hedge be about how to strongly er state your case
S0024	that's what it say here
S0144	isn't it
S0024	well i always think
S0144	it's about your stance
S0024	yeah okay
S0144	and how much you want to agree with some an argument cos maybe like say you've get argument x which you're in favour of the arguments that you use against that you're gonna kind of hedge it and you
S0024	and blame it on other people
S0144	well not blame it on other people but make that argument weaker or make it not put your
S0024	okay
S0144	voice into that argument make sure
S0024	oh
S0144	it's like someone else's point of view
S0024	yeah
S0144	and then you can rebut that
S0024	economists believe okay here's a hedge yeah so it be it be what i think but i didn't get the definition right properly
S0144	yes which page be this
S0024	i'm on page thirteen so they've get economists believe that malaria be responsible for blah blah blah blah blah
S0144	but where
S0024	erm in
S0144	exactly
S0024	paragraph two so that's hedge it
S0144	hedge okay so that's hedge what be the other
S0024	but i mean that's not say that it's i mean to me you would then contrast that economists believe this but but it doesn't oh maybe that's not
S0144	yeah but with say economists believe that's take the power away from your answer
S0024	take the power away yeah
S0144	it's set up a rebuttal really isn't it say that
S0024	it be but they've not do a rebuttal
S0144	well
S0024	have they
S0144	well it depend how you're the context of it
S0024	okay
S0144	i mean if if it's in the
S0024	do it
S0144	context of economists purely economists then that's a strong statement isn't it economists believe that's assume that all economists believe but if you're erm talk in term of the world say economists believe it's kind of weaken the argument because it's only one type of person
S0024	so that's
S0144	who think that
S0024	say that second bite again
S0144	mm
S0024	say the second bite again
S0144	erm if you're assume that you're talk about the whole world you're make a global statement
S0024	mm well
S0144	then it's weaken it so it it depend
S0024	right okay
S0144	but yeah that's hedge it could be for or against your argument what be the other ones yeah these have you do any of the others
S0024	right okay so complexity well you can choose any sentence can't you
S0144	well it's
S0024	but it's not say that it's a complex sentence compare to a compound sentence be it it's completely it's so confuse for them they've only just start academic english
S0144	yeah
S0024	already they have to learn the difference between a complex and compound sentence and now they're learn or this guy here say that complexity er just mean
S0144	well
S0024	a complicate sentence oh
S0144	can you see anything have you get an example of that
S0024	well any of them
S0144	be there any subordinate clauses
S0024	oh okay then we can say it's a complex sentence
S0144	yeah
S0024	and it's a yeah but that might confuse them as well
S0144	well what do cos they don't need to know these word really it's not it doesn't come in later do it to the course
S0024	no they have to write it not learn
S0144	not learn the word it's just metalanguage which be what they say not to do
S0024	it's in the book
S0144	erm more specific word and more sophisticate grammatical structure stupid
S0024	well it could be any of them right it could be any of them right can you see an
S0144	okay well yeah
S0024	example of
S0144	could be anything
S0024	of for er explicitness evidence explicitness
S0144	explicitness well
S0024	it's all
S0144	that's just a general thing isn't it
S0024	general
S0144	say it's explicit you can't point to a a phrase that's say that show explicitness
S0024	well the exercise be find an example
S0144	explicit well maybe an example then of up to one point three percent per year
S0024	i be gonna use that as an example of precision
S0144	okay well any of the statistics or examples show explicitness don't they just give more detail
S0024	well it's in explicit rather than implicit there's no hide mean it's just facts
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's all just well oh
S0144	okay well
S0024	i'm just think about all these question they're gonna ask me
S0144	well no it's great just get them i think look at these word fuck that i'm gonna get them to find an example of hedge
S0024	find an example of hedge okay i'll do that
S0144	and
S0024	be there any more examples of hedge in there
S0144	i dunno but they whatever they shout out you can say yes or no
S0024	oh yeah okay right find an example of see the accuracy one too i mean it could be any of them
S0144	anything
S0024	anything and responsibility er
S0144	i'm gonna so i'm gonna skim over that responsibility what the fuck erm
S0024	you must support any ideas that make and demonstrate what they have understand to source text that they have understand the source text
S0144	objectivity
S0024	oh
S0144	as well could be anything it's all factual there's no personal opinion in there be there
S0024	no
S0144	and it won't say every sentence be objective
S0024	which be what you want
S0144	formality same thing
S0024	mm
S0144	yeah i think the only one
S0024	okay
S0144	er for the concrete example be hedge
S0024	yeah now what
S0144	okay
S0024	what where be you start this class
S0144	eh
S0024	where be you start
S0144	erm i dunno i just have
S0144	have a quick look at it really erm students compare examples mm
S0024	compare to this table you see but we're not
S0144	they're gonna write a load of stuff from there
S0024	oh so we just read the text
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then go to the avu book
S0144	exercise two it's
S0024	we're not do these exercise until after the break
S0144	oh but they're read the text
S0024	oh
S0144	well i might save those question i must just look
S0024	save that for later
S0144	i'll save the hedge bite for later and go okay now we're on to this can you remember hedge from the first one
S0024	yeah
S0144	otherwise they're gonna end up read the text again
S0024	yeah
S0144	and it's just gonna
S0024	it's silly
S0144	confuse the hell out of them
S0024	okay so can i have a look at your avu book on page ten to eleven review
S0144	be that the next bite
S0024	yeah so that might be where we kind of start the class
S0144	okay so then what be special about academic english
S0024	just wanna see what kind of exercise they didn't have to do that for homework do they
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh they do do avu for homework then
S0144	erm let me just take a quick look yes so i mean good luck with that i don't know what to do with that
S0024	you've get the answer
S0144	yeah they're easy
S0024	oh be they i'm gonna have to go in early and just check things over cos i've forget my book this be the problem with work from home i forget things and leave them at work
S0144	well just keep all your stuff in your bag
S0024	yeah i didn't have the avu book i but
S0144	erm yeah the answer be easy for that but i dunno what to do about that page i'm gonna read it it's like what the fuck i haven't get
S0024	but they should have read that for homework
S0144	yeah but we've get gotta go through it for twenty minutes
S0024	review a b and c oh okay review a b and c
S0144	well what i be gonna get actually oh no that maybe put them get do microteaching where one of them be the teacher and explain what it's about and then for b the next student can explain what that one's about
S0024	group of three mm
S0144	that might work cos i i'm not gonna stand up there and like and go through all of that
S0024	oh no
S0144	get them to explain it to each other mm
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's the only way to do it
S0024	we don't have to have a powerpoint for this do we
S0144	no there's no there's nothing
S0024	i just need to jot this down on my powerpoint
S0144	yeah so yeah do that for twenty minutes go through the answer
S0024	microteaching group of three
S0144	mm maybe not even go through this answer on the next page cos that's just gonna be tedious as well
S0024	yeah no they can
S0144	they can check just
S0024	do this
S0144	check each other's work
S0024	correspondent a and number one
S0144	er don't know
S0024	everyday word
S0144	i think so yeah
S0024	one point two
S0144	yeah it's about word which be use generally and then the same type of the word be use
S0144	academically like focus the camera or the focus of the essay it's the different mean of the word focus
S0024	oh my god i remember this i'm sure i've get a type out of this
S0144	yeah yeah i mean it's it fairly easy
S0024	ah
S0144	but if they've do it for homework it's gonna like oh twenty minutes of boredom hopefully they'll have make some mistake and then i've get something to talk about okay
S0024	okay
S0144	shall we move on
S0024	erm mm
S0144	so we're use three different book tomorrow
S0024	yeah
S0144	this make connections be bloody shit i mean it's it's a crap lesson so far
S0024	yeah
S0144	isn't it but you wait till you get to this bite
S0024	oh man these core students can develop er strategies to acquire academic what strategy which strategies to acquire this
S0144	to acquire what vocabulary
S0024	yeah
S0144	okay i be just gonna brainstorm ideas make a vocabulary notebook put up a model example on the board where you've get the word you've get where the what part of speech be erm
S0024	the one from the listen and speak exercise
S0144	no i'm just gonna make my own up just draw it on the board and then write the word in context
S0024	mm erm
S0144	mm
S0024	academic
S0144	and what else
S0024	vocabulary
S0144	tell them as well to with vocabulary to learn it in you know and sometimes it's good learn it in group
S0024	mm
S0144	like lexical set instead of just list
S0024	mm
S0144	things like that and not to try and learn big group of word like seven word at a time be be a good chunk
S0024	mm so
S0144	anyway and then once they and don't just write them in their book cos this be what they do they do write them in their book and then forget about it
S0024	yeah
S0144	what they've get to do be write it in their book and then try and use it in everyday language
S0024	yeah
S0144	so they give themselves a challenge to to try and use those like word like during the course of the day and then use them the next day as well
S0024	what academically what
S0144	well
S0024	while they're discuss homework and stuff
S0144	i think this be the way to
S0024	yeah
S0144	learn vocabulary and then and then use it the next week and then use it again within the next two weeks then with them the next month and then that's the only way to get it to stick otherwise they'll just be write these word and they
S0024	yeah
S0144	they forget them so some strategies like that just ask them how to do you learn vocabulary so that they can't
S0024	yeah i might start the class with that a big brainstorm
S0144	yeah
S0024	okay big brainstorm number one brainstorm strategies do then the microteaching of this avu you've get the answer in the back of this yeah
S0144	erm don't know
S0024	oh can i just check
S0144	uhu
S0024	yeah answer be in the back
S0144	okay
S0024	okay so i'll get somebody to be teacher for each of them and i'll just go round and answer question right
S0144	so you're gonna get someone to explain that
S0024	mm
S0144	and then they and then they can check their answer for that
S0024	i'm not sure they
S0144	and then do that with that
S0024	correspondent perfectly
S0144	oh i don't they
S0024	do you think
S0144	i dunno maybe treat it separately then do each page separately
S0024	yeah
S0144	okay next
S0024	these more formal alright oh right it do more formal yeah noun phrase underline two verbs with adverbs after them okay er okay they do kind of correspond
S0144	yeah so you could get them
S0024	yeah
S0144	to do one at a time
S0024	yeah
S0144	explain it and then check the answer the teacher check the answer at the back
S0024	yeah
S0144	and then yeah okay right come on then
S0024	alright er have that erm make connections
S0144	okay you have to go to page two three nine
S0024	yeah
S0144	so this be about read and basically not stop
S0024	yeah
S0144	every time you read try to understand the word you don't know through the context
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah erm so again i think it's gonna have to be er microteaching cos this be just you can't stand up there and go through this stuff the first two i mean you can go through the strategies maybe
S0024	the and they've do this for homework
S0144	yeah they've do the whole class for homework
S0024	mm
S0144	we're just check their homework erm
S0024	okay
S0144	so just get to practice one or two just personal opinions so
S0024	you get answer
S0144	this be personal opinion
S0024	oh
S0144	they just choose what's most suitable for them whether they generally understand it or
S0024	alright i never hear of something call a what so they've do that at home and we don't have to check it then
S0144	no not one and two but three
S0024	erm
S0144	and four we do yeah so three erm yeah they've gotta look at the word and look at the paragraph and try and guess what that word mean just from
S0024	ah
S0144	the context
S0024	yes
S0144	without look at the dictionary
S0024	okay
S0144	and do that with their word
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah erm and then number four erm it's the same thing isn't it
S0024	so we're just discuss
S0024	in pair what they think the word mean
S0144	be that the same thing
S0024	er short text unit one read four
S0144	it's the same activity but just base on a different read
S0024	use these strategies for
S0144	yeah
S0024	okay
S0144	so three and four be the same
S0024	so be you go through that in class
S0144	eh
S0024	discuss what i bet they've all translate it i bet they've all
S0144	yeah
S0024	do it and then translate it
S0144	i bet they just look at it in the dictionary and write the definition
S0024	so what be you gonna do with them if they've do that
S0144	i dunno i wish i hadn't say to do it for homework
S0024	mm me too
S0144	it's stupid isn't it in fact i'm gonna stop do that
S0024	well no the read they have to do
S0144	oh some of them they're the i mean this could have easily just be do in class would have be much better for them to do it in class
S0024	mm
S0144	okay so then it's break yeah
S0024	oh but i i don't know how i'm gonna do this
S0144	make it up
S0024	get them just to just to discuss it discuss the answer to the homework okay
S0144	yeah crap eh and then after the break more online resources introduce students to online dictionaries and thesauruses
S0024	we do that already
S0144	yeah and who use online dictionaries these days
S0024	i do
S0144	yeah we do but students have get their apps on their phone so i mean they don't it's kind of redundant they i mean and we've get ten minutes to tell them to use a dictionary which we already do last week
S0024	mm
S0144	so
S0024	onelook dot com never see that
S0144	no
S0024	okay
S0144	so i don't know what i'm gonna do at that probably just skip over it
S0024	uhu right and now they work through the booklet
S0144	yeah but have you see it
S0024	one point three no let me see they've get to do this vocabulary thing yeah
S0144	i tell you what it's an awful lesson for them
S0024	i'm gonna brainstorm malaria vocabulary
S0144	brainstorm on the board yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	uhu
S0024	brainstorm on the board erm
S0144	yeah
S0024	maybe i'll take load of pen and they can just in their group on their table
S0144	yeah
S0024	there's three table they can write as many as they can word to do with malaria what do you think
S0144	yeah and then bring it together in the class
S0024	er maybe get some large sheet of paper
S0144	ah get time for that right page twelve to fourteen so yeah that's that one erm exercise two be where we go back and mention this hedge thing read through the text to get them to read it out loud
S0024	read aloud you didn't do
S0144	well yeah just to well for the time we're so short of time you know what i mean so much spare time
S0024	uhu
S0144	erm
S0024	yeah i know they say that this course be pack but actually if you do it if you do it efficiently it's not
S0144	mm
S0024	it depend on their understand i suppose
S0144	okay so they've gotta try and determine what the word mean that they don't know
S0024	okay so that's what they do in in avu
S0144	yeah
S0024	same as avu
S0144	same thing
S0024	but they do it in class
S0144	erm and then maybe if okay we so we've oh here it be exercise three so four of the unknown word they have to write it down and then without use the dictionary this be the key thing so when you when they get to read it don't use a dictionary but they would've already do it for homework
S0024	well they're keen at the moment aren't they so they're they're jump ahead a lot
S0144	i should never have say
S0024	they haven't do this er
S0144	to do this
S0024	they haven't do this for homework
S0144	i tell them to
S0024	you do it wasn't on the homework list
S0144	wasn't it
S0024	no it er exercise one be
S0144	really
S0024	mm
S0144	oh okay thank god for that
S0024	but i bet because they do exercise one that they've read all of this
S0144	yeah i bet they have
S0024	because they
S0144	they've get free time at the moment and they're keen
S0024	yeah they're just too keen
S0144	erm
S0024	okay
S0144	okay
S0024	thirteen fourteen
S0144	yeah
S0024	exercise four
S0144	yeah this be where it start get messy okay so go back to the article and and circle four general academic vocabulary items what the hell do that mean
S0024	mm er oh i've forget to
S0144	subject specific vocabulary okay it's to do with health anything to do with health malaria illness
S0024	yeah subject er specific be fine
S0024	it's like general academic vocabulary
S0024	mm
S0144	so you it be those word like focus erm
S0024	mm
S0144	but i dunno i find four but the students will never get them they'll just be come out with random stuff
S0024	but there's no answer
S0144	no
S0024	nothing
S0144	no
S0024	okay let me
S0144	but i i get
S0024	get a red pen general academic vocabulary
S0144	it's i i i read through it it's get erm and have recently be show in the first paragraph third line
S0024	mm
S0144	show
S0024	be you just do show
S0144	well show be
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's kind of a metaphor in this cos they're not really show it it's like an idea
S0024	constraint significant significant
S0144	oh okay
S0024	constraint
S0144	oh so you're do that right i be think of word which have two different mean okay
S0024	oh
S0144	i be i be think in a different way so you're just talk okay just academic language
S0024	yeah
S0144	right
S0024	affect
S0144	yeah oh okay in that case it's not a problem
S0024	hang on i'm go to write lot
S0144	lead to
S0024	annual
S0144	yeah this one yeah
S0024	what
S0144	lead to
S0024	where where be you
S0144	er in the second paragraph fourth line
S0024	uhu yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	be i circle
S0144	but
S0024	this or
S0144	you're put a big fuck exclamation mark next to it because if you go back to page ten language to avoid in academic write most phrasal verbs eg lead to
S0024	oh oh yes
S0024	oh my god
S0024	i'm sure we've lead to
S0144	yeah lead tos which lead to
S0024	so you're do spot the mistake
S0144	which
S0024	or just leave it
S0144	phrasal verbs be just there's a lot of subjectivity in there
S0024	i think it's lead to
S0144	lead to mm
S0024	what would you say instead really give us an alternative to lead to
S0144	okay this penalty result in
S0024	isn't that a phrasal verb
S0144	a consequence of this i i
S0024	a consequence of this be okay or when compound over the years
S0144	that's not necessarily a consequence though be it lead to anyway
S0024	oh
S0144	forget that
S0024	well yeah but when you've get a native speaker in your class she's gonna ask me question like this
S0024	just say the problem be with this one say lead to look
S0024	it's a bad example
S0144	it's a bad example
S0024	and i think it's okay
S0144	phrase most phrasal verbs yeah you shouldn't be use them in academic write but lead to be debatable it really be
S0024	and if they ask for an alternative mm compound over the years this penalty
S0144	the result
S0024	the result of
S0144	of
S0024	this penalty be
S0144	yeah
S0024	the result be okay right so
S0144	right erm
S0024	i'm just circle some more academic vocabulary
S0144	er cost
S0024	mm
S0144	or be that
S0024	mm
S0144	so what kind of cost be that
S0024	yeah
S0144	well anything academic
S0024	a combination of expenditures mm
S0144	erm account
S0024	support for
S0144	account for
S0024	account for yeah
S0144	at the bottom second line up where's support for
S0024	support for third paragraph fourth line
S0144	yeah i mean they're just gonna be come out with all all kinds of word and you're gonna say yeah that's that can be use in academic write
S0024	oh okay
S0144	i'm not gonna confuse them with this
S0024	no right so they're just do general academic vocabulary subject specific
S0144	mm
S0024	vocabulary fine
S0144	so that won't take very long will it
S0024	no how long be that
S0144	go online
S0024	my time be all over the place you know i'm not cos it's like thirty five minutes for the whole thing
S0144	yeah so when they've
S0024	so
S0144	these four word that they've get they've basically gotta go er
S0024	ten minutes
S0144	okay
S0024	okay yeah
S0144	go on the dictionary
S0024	but when though
S0144	find out the exact word
S0024	oh for your list oh yes i remember
S0144	so don't use a dictionary
S0024	yeah
S0144	again just keep tell them
S0024	once you know the exact mean of the word write a sentence use a different form of the word
S0144	yeah
S0024	use four general academic word
S0144	mm okay that'll take what ten minutes
S0024	use a different form of the word well what if their word be malaria
S0144	yeah that's that's why i say it have to be word like cost and account for account word which have a double mean but there's there isn't really any in there but they'd never get that
S0024	what if they change the form like
S0144	i'd say you can change no what's the point of change the form
S0024	if they say i don't know the mean of economists okay that's your your word and then you change it to economy and you write a sentence that's fine but
S0144	mm
S0024	really so so this be what
S0144	use a different form of the word if possible
S0024	disease
S0144	but then they might they might choose a word which be not academic
S0024	i think they be choose just any vocabulary that they don't understand
S0144	no these be four general academic vocabulary word they're the ones that they're look at in the dictionary
S0024	oh i think it they be look at this list
S0144	eh
S0024	any four unknown word
S0144	oh but they've do that already here mean what do you think it mean
S0024	oh
S0144	then
S0024	check
S0144	they look at the dictionary for the real mean
S0024	right right so yeah so exercise five we can do for the general academic vocabulary
S0144	yeah
S0024	use four general oh they've just
S0144	yeah it doesn't
S0024	it's a bite
S0144	make sense
S0024	backwards isn't it
S0144	it doesn't it's badly write so you say change the word but make sure i no i'm just gonna say keep the same word just write it in another sentence if that's the word they don't know that's the word they need to practice but they could just end up write completely different word
S0024	i suppose if they choose any general general academic vocabularies you can
S0144	okay so say they choose account
S0024	accountable
S0144	the disease may account for okay so they look up account a financial thing so they've get their sentence about some financial service that's just confuse them
S0024	well they should be look at the context anyway
S0144	anyway that's the best one
S0024	mm
S0144	right
S0024	i've get a feel that i have trouble with this last year and there's something write in by the book
S0144	i think it's gonna be you're gonna have to really kind of
S0024	oh be that it
S0144	stretch it out yeah
S0024	you'll be expect to work through the academic that's it
S0144	yeah just i'm gonna take it really slowly
S0024	mm

S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	in term of script
S0024	uhu
S0144	mm i mean you know david lynch he get some er freaky visual stuff
S0024	mm
S0144	but
S0144	it's the you know if house of card be the most intelligent thing i think that i've ever watch
S0024	yeah
S0144	like series
S0024	ah
S0144	whatever team of writers do that they deserve a
S0024	oh no they're brilliant aren't they
S0144	oscar or something
S0024	i don't
S0144	and
S0024	get how they
S0144	and they they should erm teach it at school like to politics students or
S0024	they must have they must be politicians the people who write it what's this you've get out cayenne pepper
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah alright cheese
S0144	no they don't have to be politicians i don't i in fact i'd say they're definitely not politicians
S0024	really i'd say they be like they know every how it all work and everything
S0144	oh
S0024	they need to they need to
S0144	yeah an understand of politics but
S0024	mm
S0144	but to almost expose it it be like an
S0024	yeah they
S0144	exposé really
S0024	it's an old yeah
S0144	what
S0024	the
S0144	bloody sociopaths these people be
S0024	yeah
S0144	and how it do work
S0024	but some of the stuff
S0144	and how it isn't a conspiracy and and things do link up and things be you know how
S0024	i'd say
S0144	manipulative
S0024	somebody
S0144	these people be and
S0024	would have work in that
S0144	the lobbyists and
S0024	whoever write it they must have see all of that
S0144	mm
S0024	who do write it
S0144	well that be the english series wasn't it in the nineties
S0024	see we haven't see that one with
S0144	no cos that be base on erm thatcher
S0024	be it
S0144	yeah whereas thatcher
S0024	let's watch that
S0144	thatcher be the like the president who be get oust
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm and strangely enough i think actually a couple of months after it be show she resign
S0144	erm yeah yeah i can't believe we haven't
S0024	let's let's
S0144	see that actually
S0024	watch it but
S0144	but i think all the
S0144	characters' name be the same
S0024	really
S0144	and i i think they do two series so it would be basically the same thing
S0024	mm that cheese be nice
S0144	but they're do a first series with the american ones
S0024	erm
S0144	which i think
S0024	probably
S0144	be gonna take it a step further cos erm at the end he's get together his little team isn't he
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	like he's get that woman who basically will do anything
S0024	he basically put everybody in there yeah
S0144	he's get all of his team in place
S0024	can you pass that
S0144	so
S0024	do you need a cloth
S0144	which be basically it's very it's i mean the person
S0144	who write that must know a lot about erm well hitler as well cos i think they're base it a lot on exactly what hitler do in his rise to power get
S0024	really
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh of course you've read his book haven't you i haven't read it
S0144	i've read mein kampf but that doesn't say very much
S0024	no
S0144	it's very badly write actually oh
S0024	don't splash me i've have so many injuries lately say i have to go
S0144	oh
S0024	wear red
S0144	why
S0024	apparently if if it's your year
S0144	right
S0024	like my year be the year of the horse
S0144	right
S0024	if it if it come round again which be have for me
S0144	what the year of the horse
S0024	yeah
S0144	what do you mean if it come round again it always come round again
S0024	when
S0144	when you die you mean
S0024	when it come round again
S0144	what do you mean
S0024	when it come round i need to use that one when it come round again year of the horse
S0144	yeah
S0024	then if you you have to wear red for good luck
S0144	what all year
S0024	er if you wear red you have a lucky day i need a bite of luck
S0144	well yeah that sound logical

S0144	i dunno you're just not interest in what i be say
S0024	i be interest i'm very interest sorry i don't know where that come from
S0144	no i be say the house of card third season you can see how he's put all those his people in power and
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	yeah i reckon it's gonna go into like a nuclear war or something i think it have to doesn't it
S0024	very clever do you reckon you could write something like that
S0144	no chance
S0024	no
S0144	no well you haven't get you need insider knowledge a little bite don't you
S0024	that's what i say
S0144	yeah yeah but but i think maybe not actually be part of it or maybe people get kind of disillusion with it and leave
S0024	be this alright can we
S0144	yeah
S0024	open a new one this look so old
S0144	can i smell it
