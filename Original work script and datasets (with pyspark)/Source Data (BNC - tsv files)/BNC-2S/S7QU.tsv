S0115	right so um
S0114	so do we decide that those bigger seed be be pumpkin seed on the bread
S0115	uh no uh i dunno actually they be some funny colour they be like um they be like browny green or or almost but uh i didn't know what that be um but uh i've
S0114	i've eat them often yeah
S0115	actually i've see pumpkin seed that when we take them out at halloween
S0114	yeah
S0115	uh have the you know take out the seed and sort of throw most of them away we keep a few of them and toast them but uh they actually white those ones so
S0114	they may turn green of course they may go a different colour
S0115	i dunno so i don't i i dunno but um
S0114	i've see them many time but i've eat them many time but i don't know what they be
S0115	so i never think of grow a pumpkin but uh i guess they'd be good cos you can make soup can't you
S0114	i think i might oh do i do we tell you we've make some absolutely wonderful compost
S0115	no uh
S0114	we've be cultivate it for years um and it's finally
S0115	oh right you actually put sort of like a
S0114	it's turn into the most wonderful soft light soil so um
S0115	alright so it do work then it's not just a not just a joke
S0114	yeah it work yeah and what's really lovely about it be that dad pull out this long piece of wool and um he say
S0115	oh right
S0114	i think that be really nice because if you if you shouldn't put something into the composter it tell you cos it doesn't break down
S0115	it sort of yeah it's just there yeah i mean it's a good thing to have isn't it
S0114	so we've get this wonderful light really soft light soil cos it's full of worm if you look in it it's disgust it's get all these worm in
S0115	yeah well i'm i'm sure it's disgust i mean i would expect compost to cos they they smell quite bad don't they for a while that's why you have to put them at the end of the garden don't you away from uh away from yeah
S0114	yeah yeah they smell bad yes be that where we're go wrong so
S0115	because uh i suppose they attract they do attract sort of fly and things and uh maybe uh wasps or something but uh
S0114	they attract fly yeah they do yeah
S0115	but but when but it be a way of save yourself money isn't it because if you want to grow uh you know if you want to grow plant then you'd need to buy soil so how much what sort of volume d'you think it
S0114	oh yeah oh mass a whole barrel a really quite a large two uh three foot high barrel uh of it
S0115	yeah so sort of a substantial right
S0114	and um so what i'm go to do be when the weather's a bite warmer i'm go to um dig it into those two the terrace bed at the bottom and uh for my veg
S0115	oh yeah right so you're gonna a sort of self sufficient or you know move towards slowly towards self sufficiency
S0114	yeah yeah i'm dig out the raspberry can cos they completely fail and then i'm go to grow i'm go to grow runner bean this year d'you remember when we grow them at langleys road you grow some and they be really successful very successful
S0115	yeah um uh i remember have when the can be we haven't do any here cos we don't really have um
S0114	no we haven't but we uh we're go to do that this time
S0115	um well i suppose we don't eat that many of them but
S0114	you would if you grow them
S0115	the yeah i mean it's one of those things we have to think about uh what be sort what's gonna save us money what what will we actually cos it's all very well grow you know ten um you know uh gooseberry plant or something but well we don't we don't eat gooseberries ever so we wouldn't have any use for that but
S0114	yes yeah no
S0115	well we have a cucumber one that save us sort of you know fifty p each cucumber you know so
S0114	at least
S0115	but um
S0114	mm
S0115	and things we we eat a lot of uh carrots and potatoes but
S0114	yes
S0115	well there be a problem cos of course you you can't really match the kinds of demand that you have you know you buy a bag of potatoes every week uh but it'd be hard to grow that many but uh it'd be
S0114	yeah you can grow a lot out of one plant in a tub so that's another thing we're go to do i'm go to waste valuable grind space on potatoes cos you can grow a lot on a plant i saw jamie oliver do it um but i'm go to grow some carrots we're go to have the bean just in front of the terrace to give a better view um and a bite of privacy as well in that corner
S0115	i see yeah
S0114	so and then in that bed i'm go to grow onions red onions but um
S0115	oh right yeah
S0114	um and white onions i'm go to grow some garlics lettuce with a cloche
S0115	that'll be good i mean it's it's a question of can you uh you gotta use the space haven't you i mean cos how much space have you get you've get about i don't know how to judge space by the way into square metres yeah
S0114	we we might we're get a greenhouse as well um in that if we use those just those terrace we've get um we're about six feet wide by six by three two of them six by three
S0115	oh so sort of six by six so in feet translate that to metres
S0114	i don't know see it's never enough for your vegetables but um
S0115	two by two by two metres no it would probably be more um
S0114	cos you then you need a big space between each of them the broccolis we're go we're get a greenhouse so we'll probably put the lettuces in there um because um last year we grow those cauliflowers and they start off with a a fist size ball and they be so healthy white and we'd get all these slug pellets round them but we didn't realize that the danger come from overhead the caterpillars the cabbage white lay their egg all over it and they be totally ruin cauliflowers broccolis the lot go into the bin
S0115	be it oh yeah yeah yeah moths and things the little moth things yeah yeah um well they're really they be hard to grow those ones cos we have we have some some you give us a broccoli and uh they they just grow into these really hideous uh things where the the individual the individual yeah uh frankencabbage
S0114	yeah oh it's terrible yeah day of the triffid
S0115	uh the the um the individual tree sprout the whatever they call them the individual sprout of it be sort of grow at different rat so you'd have bits stick out uh certain clump stick out and other bits hold back and then it be go off and also it be get eat by a variety of things so that i think that sort of broccoli and cauliflower be perhaps you know amongst the amongst the harder things to grow be they do do they need more heat yeah
S0114	yeah oh i know ridiculous for the greenhouse yeah beetroot's i tell you uh you get good ideas go round um garden centre round the um the kitchen garden you get lot of tip then cos you can see that you can grow beetroots and then in between them you can put a carrot uh you can put something in between them that doesn't need as much space you get load of good ideas by go round those um the women's institute often do a garden and you get uh you can get ideas for grow all sort of things
S0115	yeah yeah oh yeah you gotta do that there's a lot of um you need to need to read yeah well there's an allotment down here but i be think you know obviously the internet be a real good source isn't it cos i know yeah
S0114	oh yeah yeah
S0115	remember that that programme you know with the when jamie oliver have his you know he's get his gardener i'm sure he's get all his everything have be plan out so i assume there's load of knowledge that that you can get about it uh
S0114	yes mm monty don as well you can get lot of ideas
S0115	but it's a question of you have to learn a lot yeah you have to learn a lot quite quickly uh be the hard part i suppose
S0114	about shoot and get them in the pot to start with but we've get some uh we're gonna start little things off in egg trays well when we get the greenhouse that'll make a huge difference um cos we can put the tomatoes and lettuces and things like that that be slug prone into there
S0115	yeah i mean you know yeah yeah yeah uh how big the how big be the lettuce gonna be sorry the the greenhouse gonna be
S0114	uh eight by eight by six or yeah or six by four
S0115	yeah
S0114	pends how much space there be
S0115	so you can then you can get lemons cos i've get a load of lemons over there but they they seem to have uh
S0114	grape vine
S0115	oh yeah yeah we'll we've get one in the cemetery isn't there
S0114	yeah well we're yes what you do be you plant you take a piece of window out of the bottom out of the corner of it and stick it and poke the root into the grind so that it get water and then the rest of it grow round your greenhouse
S0115	oh yeah yeah mind you in in where you be you may be able to grow it outside but yeah
S0114	um yes you get a lot of concentrate sun in that one corner i grow tomatoes in that corner yeah
S0115	you could've could've as well actually cos he be in he be in he might've be able to partly just to red them i'd think
S0114	yeah white white and red i'd grow red
S0115	well there's two there's there's one in the cemetery which be an old and it's an establish sort of old plant and then there's one in the um there's one uh there's one in a pub down there it sort of go round the on a trellis on the side of the house
S0114	can anybody pick it be they be it it's not for everyone to pick really mm oh i'd love to do that i'd love to do that
S0115	but yeah so i don't know if it have to go inside but i suppose it doesn't matter i mean
S0114	if you've get plenty of sun on it constant sun cos there or the maximum sun cos there's a the you know the way our garden be the way our garden be there's um areas where you get um a lot of sun concentrate sun for all day and in our garden it's in the bottom right hand corner
S0115	yeah yeah yeah the the south the south face bite isn't it the uh you your garden though be actually you've get a north face garden haven't you or have you
S0114	the south yes that's right actually no the the um yes but it get um it doesn't matter because it come over the because the garden slop at a certain angle it get the sun on that spot and then our neighbour get the sun the other side of the fence in that corner so they've get a bench there and we've get we but we grow plant in ours cos um
S0115	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah cos i mean it's not just about the direction as well i mean obviously if you have the south face you you can't have you'd have to chop tree down at the bottom if you have a south face one you'd have to chop tree at the bottom otherwise you'd have to yeah i suppose you'd have to chop all your tree to maximize your light i suppose wouldn't you well yeah
S0114	we could yes yeah yes but we wouldn't do that cos uh there's this particular area that get um a lot of sun uh it get the sun um from about eleven onwards from eleven till
S0115	yeah it's there there's be your your garden get quite hot actually uh i mean i didn't go i don't normally go in the sun very often but uh
S0114	it do get very hot yeah but um but the good thing about our garden be when you're in the front garden it's absolutely boil hot you've get your sun hat your sun glass and it's torture
S0115	oh yeah you'd probably do better at plant in your your front garden that's really hot
S0114	so what we could do we could put some tomatoes there if they be or we could put um sweet peas or something
S0115	yeah
S0114	but um if it's far too hot in the front garden which it quite often be you you can go to the back because after eleven o'clock you get the shade from the house you get the shade from the house so you can sit on the patio and of course the sun move round the shade move round but there's an almost always a little patch of the garden where you can be in shade which be really handy cos i mean it's a small garden but it's not tiny by any mean you can do quite a lot with it uh it's get
S0115	yeah yeah oh yeah for uh yeah well it's what you it's what you make of the space isn't it i mean people that
S0114	of the space yes
S0115	you know in i saw a thing in uh central london where they they have all kinds of innovative sort of garden techniques you know there there be mushroom growers you see um they don't mushroom doesn't need light so
S0114	outdoors
S0115	they they do yeah they they have a sort of a kinda indoor garden sort of thing
S0114	peter and ann use to make them in the in the cellar
S0115	peter and ann
S0114	yeah
S0115	oh mott yeah yeah yeah um the cellar yeah yeah we we should um yeah that's quite a good trick actually i i think i'd like to do that i mean i've get a lot of aspirations that don't have you know necessarily time or experience to um
S0114	so you could make them you can yeah yeah or space there's a lot of things you can grow that don't need much space
S0115	yeah like i don't like like brew i mean i'd always like always want to brew or um wine or cider beer yeah
S0114	yeah wine i'd like to make some wine i've get an i've get two big cartons of um damsons in the freezer from last winter and i haven't do a thing with them yet
S0115	yeah
S0114	so i mean i i uh i'll make a pie i'll make a tart that'll be nice and uh i might um make some damson wine or something but i haven't get uh the facilities
S0115	i be just think actually some some of the things uh back to um your fungus again um some type of fungus be very um valuable aren't they famously truffles be valuable aren't they
S0114	truffles be they the ones that grow on the tree
S0115	no truffles don't grow on tree they're the ones that the pig the pig come and um
S0114	oh there's a stake oh sorry i'm think of mushroom um yeah those be the stake the stake mushroom they be they call it
S0115	oh yeah you mean fungus that grow on the side of a tree uh yeah no um no i'm think of things like truffles and similar i mean i be i think there's a bite of a you know it's a bite like champagne with truffles i think it matter where the you know where the region be that they come from
S0114	i don't think i've ever eat them actually yes
S0115	with you need to i think they're they're suppose to get italian truffles and specifically the greatest most expensive truffles presumably come from a particular region of italy like i dunno um uh yeah the place that's at the foot of the mountain uh i can't remember piedmont or something
S0114	yes yes mm
S0115	um it's this region in north of italy anyway um cos i saw a programme about it anyway um there be them two italian chefs uh that go and there's they take truffles very seriously in in italy and um very very valuable
S0114	yes they do
S0115	but anyway yeah so if you have a cellar or someone have a cellar you can just turn uh a bore cellar into you know somewhere that you could possibly produce something valuable if if you could grow something like that or or um you know the other type of things like brew or you you can you can use space that way i mean there must be a lot of um a lot of trick to to make extra make the most of the same money yeah
S0114	it'd be good yeah yes there be and the the apple tree that and the fruit tree that grow along the wall um they're a very good idea because i mean we've get these apple tree and they're very intermittent in what they produce um most of our apples this year be from um be from the tree that's on the right which be golden delicious but um the quality for for a golden delicious apple it's not the quality wasn't very good uh but there be hardly any on the um the jam grieve which be good when you get those those be superb quality very big um it's a matter of time the pick before um before the bird and the grub get in it uh and before it fall off but allow them to ripen i mean we have a superb um crop of apples last year cook apples last year and we give load of them away and uh you have a lot didn't you um but um but this year we have hardly any from that tree
S0115	right yeah yeah uh yeah quite a um we we didn't make any cider though
S0114	oh i tell you why we crop it we cut it back
S0115	yeah
S0114	cut the tree right back prune it i didn't think it would leaf even i mean the way dad cut it it be so big and ugly um and the way dad cut it back uh i didn't think it would ever grow again but um we have lot of leave and a few apples so i mean we'll probably get a good crop this year but i yeah
S0115	yeah yeah well that's good i mean i think if we prepare for that actually we should be able should get uh a press or something to press the to filter the apples
S0114	yes
S0115	um cos that's the hard part uh well one of the hard part of make um cider from apples be be um be that you need to filter to press them and filter them
S0114	be to yes yes to get the pulp
S0115	um uh not not the pulp the to get rid of the pulp to get the juice
S0114	get juice yeah
S0115	um you know
S0114	d'you peel them
S0115	yeah i think yeah i mean so you peel them and that'll take a long time um
S0114	yeah yeah
S0115	although uh yeah i think so because i think the sometimes the skin doesn't have well it have sort of i suppose you don't have to i suppose you could put them in the press with the skin on as well uh but i'm not sure if the skin have the right sort of things in it but uh
S0114	yes i'm not sure what they do no
S0115	we make a little bite of cider uh
S0114	oh the skin have the healthy bits in it the the um the skin of the apple but for the cider yeah
S0115	oh no i mean the the bits for the cider the the you want the sugar uh the water and sugar
S0114	i would make cider vinegar if i be do it i love cider vinegar
S0115	yeah well we do cos we leave it too long you see cos it start off as cider and then if you leave it it turn into vinegar
S0114	oh do you have some usable
S0115	we make cider vinegar yeah
S0114	do you i didn't know about that
S0115	it's quite easy actually we pretty much just do it with uh what be those cloths that you squeeze the uh like a
S0114	sieve uh muslin yeah
S0115	yeah we basically um sort of uh blend them or chop them
S0114	yeah yeah yes
S0115	a blender would be very useful or some kind of big blender
S0114	yes and then you you can leave it to to drip through
S0115	yeah you gotta peel and core them yeah peel and core them blend them or yeah some way find some way of blend them then then this be the hard bite you've gotta press and filter it you know you've get the so we do the the muslin thing and just squeeze out the uh the juice of it and then uh um
S0114	yes the juice cos you can leave them overnight to drip but it be
S0115	we leave it in a bottle with a sort of we tie some muslin over the top of it i think and then leave it
S0114	oh i didn't know
S0115	cos the the yeast be in the um air
S0114	oh
S0115	we didn't add any yeast um yeast just settle on it and uh and it turn it start to fizz it turn into cider but them it it if you leave it the alcohol sort of evaporate and you're leave with um well the alcohol get turn by some other i dunno what the science of it but you end up with cider vinegar if you leave it too long so you have to know when to also i think it get stronger so i think if you if you start uh it go through a phase of of initially it would just have a bite of alcohol then then i guess it would get stronger um and then presumably it would get weaker again as it be start to turn into vinegar so but we didn't know much about it so we hadn't we hadn't do what you should do which be to properly read instructions first and make sure you've uh follow it um accord to accord to those so uh um yeah d'you want any any coffee or
S0114	mm mm cider oh yes please yeah cider vinegar's get uh load of health properties you know that don't you all vinegars have um not they don't just go on fish and chip you know that didn't you you can use it for clean um medicinal and but um but for medicinal heal like aloe
S0115	oh well uh what um oh yeah with yeah clean yeah
S0114	our aloe's grow really well uh that little plant it's grow all through the winter actually um it have when you give it to us it have two big stem and one little stem and that stem's grow big and there's another one half grow as well it's grow ever since you give it to us that's a good one
S0115	yeah the i think they um right yeah um we've we've get a sort of extra um bite come out you know the the the little the little one on the side uh that's we have yeah we have another
S0114	yours be yes oh a baby oh
S0115	that's connect to it we have uh two of them but actually the other one die and it it be suffer for a while but uh i put it on the uh windowsill it seem to have improve but i think they're quite uh those ones be quite hardy uh you know whatever
S0114	yeah yes they're very um those uh i print off um i look on the internet the uh heal medicinal properties heal properties of um aloe um and it's not just burn there be a whole page of it same as tea you look at um tea um ordinary black tea as well not it doesn't have to be green tea and then there's um
S0115	oh yeah i've see that on uh wikipedia yeah there's load of uh load of chemicals in there isn't there yeah yeah i mean there's all these different things some of them be controversial aren't they
S0114	a garlic load of them some of them be controversial but you see our our forebears know all this hundred years hundred well hundred and fifty years ago uh you know the people with their cottage garden they know all about uh the heal properties of herbs and we be realize
S0115	yeah base on well yeah i mean ancient in ancient as well and things like uh like the the the um penicillin yeah the mould the you know i think aboriginal uh people be use um mould from bark or something to um to to as an antibiotic you know as an ancient thing yeah something like that
S0114	yes yes and they find during yeah they find during the war that um during um the first world war i suppose it would've be that the soldier that be injure they cos it take time to catch up with the soldier that be injure you know after battle um and when they go to them they find that maggots have get into some of the wound uh which be a bite disgust but then they realize that the ones whose wound have be um eat by um maggots be be heal where um they'd eat all the the germs the bacteria out of it
S0115	yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah on yeah yeah the the the the bacteria yeah the dead uh the dead um the dead flesh which have bacteria in it um leave only the um leave only the good leave behind the good flesh
S0114	yes that's right amaze isn't it yes enable the good flesh to heal
S0115	yeah get rid of the bacteria i suppose uh
S0114	get as oh that's amaze but plant have get terrific
S0115	that's an accidental discovery isn't it uh as oppose to um
S0114	yeah like um penicillin but we we've turn our back on um on herbal on herbal remedy for an awfully long time and uh people be realize you know by analyse these these foods
S0115	well i dunno i mean different yeah some of it um be uh some it's sort of dispute i mean things like the uh anti oxidants um i think the they you know they get in uh berry and things and yeah yeah uh tea i think and you know
S0114	everything oranges apply it
S0115	but it have sometimes in some ways it's good because uh it's get the the the you know the free radicals you know the um it it can reduce um
S0114	yes
S0115	uh it have an effect of get rid of um you know the dangerous free radicals in the blood but also uh it have certain other may have certain negative effect as well
S0114	yes
S0115	depend on you know various things but
S0114	overconsumption uh like they say
S0115	yeah i think yeah for some things like tea i think prevent uh absorption of some tea prevent absorption of some other stuff like iron but it depend on a lot uh i guess it's complicate though so
S0114	oh do it yes
S0115	i mean um
S0114	i hadn't read that
S0115	i mean i uh yeah
S0114	it have get anti oxidants to that's protective against quite a few illnesses
S0115	and yeah and some some it's like with the cancer study often you get you say that this some study will say that it's that it help against cancer but another study will say that it can actually make can actually have no effect or can actually increase the chance of cancer and there's a lot of complicate uh things about that and these sort of things take a long time cos you have to do load and load of experiment i suppose
S0114	yeah yes there be yeah yes
S0115	um it oh there be there be one substance for cos it be aspirin wasn't it uh aspirin be suppose to to help against cancer wasn't it um
S0114	oh well that's the one that's uh oh well aspirin be the one that you know that become the um the the you know the ultimate remedy and then they then they suddenly announce oh no it's um it's it's terrible don't take it at all
S0115	well no i mean the i i think it's it's good in smallish dose actually but i i have hear cos you sometimes you have it and you don't realize like it's in um it's in like that bonjela stuff you know that for you to put over mouth ulcers um so it's in that but it be natural isn't it it's from the willow uh so it be a naturally occur you know
S0114	it's just yeah in small dose yeah yeah yes it's natural yeah but it i think most of things i've read be be its good its good outweigh its bad um you don't know you know you have to take it with a pinch of salt don't you
S0115	oh yeah i think the most of the bad of aspirin be involve um stomach damage or something it damage your stomach but uh it i think it have a lot of positive stuff include yeah like cancer benefit something to do with that it compare with paracetamol it sort of it kill it stop process rather than merely pause whereas you know paracetamol would pause a process and then when it wear off the process start again but uh aspirin i think um just kill the stop the process
S0114	stomach bleed yeah uh hair but um yes yeah it's more powerful yeah
S0115	and that translate to somehow to it actually inhibit cancer growth but i don't know exactly uh exactly how that happen but oh yeah so i be wonder d'you want any uh coffee um yeah
S0114	we don't know no yes please yeah shall we have a cup of coffee then i think dad's ready for some coffee as well
