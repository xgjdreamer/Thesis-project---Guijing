S0192	i do that and i take some for my pack lunch to the uni and it must have leak so i have like paprikary oil all over my fuck bag it be terrible
S0228	oh mate
S0192	it be horrible but i couldn't make it in korea cos we don't get tahini and i couldn't find any tahini anywhere
S0228	you could just surely you could just use
S0192	sesame seed it's tahini's make from sesame seed
S0228	chickpeas
S0192	oh yeah i i've i mean the main ingredient be chickpeas but you a proper hummus recipe need tahini as well doesn't it
S0228	no i think it's
S0192	i i try do with that only it didn't quite taste right
S0228	i think i think you get like load of different type i don't think there's a standard
S0192	no i've erm
S0228	i've always just think if you look at tesco's ones and just the standard one in tesco's it will just be chickpeas lemon garlic salt pepper
S0192	yeah there's no tahini in it oh fair
S0228	no
S0192	i erm
S0228	tahini i always think be er its own separate thing
S0192	i make erm falafel quite a lot as well
S0228	yeah i've try make them but i can never get the consistency right
S0192	what's go wrong
S0228	that they just
S0192	too wet
S0228	too
S0192	too crumbly or
S0228	yeah they're a bite too crumbly and erm if i put more in they just get too too
S0192	do you add any flour to it
S0228	erm sometimes i do sometimes i do yeah
S0192	if i tend to put the flour in at the end and i'm do but erm i've my falafel's be good i'll tell you what's not what's kind of er might make it a bite more crumbly but sometimes i freeze them and they hold together quite well
S0228	yeah
S0192	i do that but i have them
S0228	i don't fry them though i put them
S0192	i have them for lunch
S0228	in the oven
S0192	yeah do you put them in like patties or like in a ball
S0228	in a ball
S0192	yeah it be tasty though it's nice that
S0228	mm they're good for you
S0192	yeah i eat quite a bite of chickpeas they're cheap so it's a good source of protein
S0228	yeah we only have chickpeas once a week
S0192	yeah you can't eat them too much can you cos i probably have it like three time a week maybe four time maybe
S0228	and they just get a bite bore then don't they
S0192	yeah yeah it do bite like but and i for lunch probably will have like hummus with veg and then maybe a bite of tortilla or something you know some egg and a bite of cheese or some shit that's normally my lunch pretty much it do get bore though every day you're like oh right hummus again some more carrot some more pepper
S0228	mm
S0192	bite of cucumber
S0228	you can mix it up a bite don't you
S0192	yeah yeah the problem be have time as well to do this shit
S0228	it don't take that long though
S0192	no but
S0228	it's all in the preparation
S0192	i'm in i'm in the uni four days a week as well so it's
S0228	it's all just in the preparation like if you make a bulk thing so freeze some of it and
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0228	you can save things and add things to it later
S0192	yeah
S0228	like pizza dough mate you can have anything on a pizza
S0192	yeah
S0228	anything
S0192	i've never make pizza though
S0228	it's easy
S0192	i've never have yeast
S0228	it's so easy
S0192	do you use yeast yeah it's gotta rise a bite no
S0228	mm
S0192	my mate do it
S0228	you can just use like anything on it i reckon erm
S0192	i make my own naan i do that
S0228	yeah
S0192	probably
S0228	that's an unleavened bread isn't it
S0192	yeah it's not amaze like if i
S0228	what be it just flour and water
S0192	no i mean i would say flour and water would be more like chapatti but there's again variations of the recipe but when i make naan i use egg and i don't use water i use milk erm and then i'll probably put a little a little bite of bake powder in there
S0228	yeah
S0192	erm but i don't have a tandoori oven or nothing so it would just i stick it in the oven and it it rise a little bite and it's maybe i'll put a bite of coriander in it or something like that
S0228	mm
S0192	but it taste good but it doesn't taste of like
S0228	pitta bread and like i like pitta bread
S0192	doesn't taste of bread quite a lot
S0228	i think they'll be pretty easy to make
S0192	to tell you honestly the naan kind of come out like a pitta bread in fact sometimes you can kind of like half it there's like a gap in the middle so
S0228	cos i know when they've make greek bread they've put milk in it sometimes
S0192	yeah
S0228	they'll like they'll let it sit for a bite then put milk in it
S0192	yeah i'll tell you what be really good mate when i be in china last time there's they've get a type of bread there call baba bread
S0228	mm
S0192	it's really good
S0228	yeah
S0192	it's i dunno what it be but they i be chill in er tiger leap gorge eat baba bread and honey with er special special butter
S0228	special butter
S0192	yeah baba bread
S0228	's cousin he's only fourteen and he be say about this creamy chicken his his mum cook it's like proper unhealthy

S0228	just all the stuff what's bad for you but make it taste really nice
S0192	yeah
S0228	yeah i've never have ghee
S0192	it's just butter isn't it
S0228	yeah it's
S0192	but un it's clarify like you
S0228	yeah i dunno if that mean it's thicker or something
S0192	i've make it once
S0228	yeah
S0192	you like skim off the the fat or something
S0228	yeah
S0192	erm i can't remember how i do it i think i have to like cook it slightly and then like you skim off the bite that come off the top i do it a couple of time i be like this be mission like skim this butter
S0228	mm
S0192	unclarified butter or clarify butter or something like
S0228	yeah
S0192	i think that's what it's call
S0228	clarify butter ain't it
S0192	yeah
S0228	yeah
S0228	taste the tea mate
S0192	it's boil
S0228	so what do you think
S0192	yeah it's good
S0228	it's alright innit
S0192	yeah
S0228	bite different than just
S0192	bite sweet how much sugar do you put in
S0228	two teaspoons
S0192	in that whole thing
S0228	yeah
S0192	yeah i suppose it's not terrible it's nice
S0228	otherwise i think the tannins in the tea would make it a bite too bigger
S0192	yeah no it be good
S0228	it's what i just drink in morocco mate cos they don't really drink out there
S0192	get a little bite of a chai flavour a little bite might be the sweetness to it i'm not sure
S0228	maybe
S0192	mate some chai in india be rank they like have a proper skin on the thing and you drink it in these little clay cup
S0228	chai
S0192	yeah
S0228	it's just tea innit
S0192	yeah yeah but they they kind of make it like we do in england like sweet with a bite of milk kind of like that kind of stuff and like you drink it in these little well not always but like sometimes there be these little clay cup but the clay hasn't be bake so you've gotta drink it quickly otherwise it start to seep through
S0228	mm
S0192	and then everyone just like smash the the cup afterwards it seem a bite random but every time you meet someone they'd be like chai you know so i'd drink chai and they're
S0228	they call it chai in cyprus
S0192	yeah
S0228	yeah
S0192	chai well in korea they call it cha
S0228	yeah
S0192	so it's pretty similar it's gotta come from the same kind of thing
S0228	probably come from china doesn't it
S0192	yeah
S0228	yeah
S0192	nokcha be green tea cha
S0228	you know green tea be just normal standard tea

S0228	yeah it's just
S0192	and everything else be something else
S0228	a different oxidisation
S0192	oh
S0228	i think green so when you get the brown tea the brown have just be completely dry out steam and then dry out while the green tea have just be partially steam then dry
S0192	kind of fresher
S0228	that's it yeah it just mean there's more in it it's all the same plant though see

S0192	crap
S0228	yeah
S0192	yeah malarone the one i be tell about that expensive one i carry some sometimes because they actually use it to treat malaria unlike doxycycline where you have to take it every day you can keep like a week's worth of malarone and if you think you've get it
S0228	mm
S0192	you can just take four days' worth and then you still need to go to a doctor but it kind of treat it so i usually cos it's expensive i keep like a week on me and then
S0228	yeah
S0192	if i need to i can like but i've never have any symptoms or anything like that to be honest though there it's a bite difficult to tell because it have similar symptoms to other things like just a general kind of fever and cold and that kind of shit
S0228	you know quinine
