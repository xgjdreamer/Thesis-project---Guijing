S0619	uhu
S0618	she could've be hack or whatever
S0619	and you have to pay for international transfer

S0618	or be run out and curious thing in northern ireland you can have either erm and post offices in northern ireland will give you a form for down south ireland
S0619	mm
S0618	and down south ireland will give you a form for up north ireland or uk erm so he say he be think the same about the price and blah blah blah erm blah blah blah he say i go to the post office this be in the bottom of the peninsula arse end of nowhere to get an irish passport renewal form they've run out of them at the moment but they say supply them that's the local chip shop
S0618	erm but the local chip shop man who seem to be in his chip shop twenty four seven be also the local councillor so
S0619	uhu okay
S0618	so yeah but it make sense i suppose that as a
S0619	that's so funny
S0618	public service
S0619	uhu
S0618	he's probably get all sort of form together with his
S0619	yeah
S0618	tomato ketchup vinegar
S0619	run a solicitors back through the back
S0618	yeah exactly
S0619	ah
S0618	i just think that be typical that's so funny but anyway we both like the look of another place as well which be a little bite out of town but it's get this erm it's right on the sea and get this really cosy
S0619	nice
S0618	outdoor like nook bite where you can
S0619	nice

S0618	yay so anyway blah blah
S0619	good good good glad you've get it you've get the ball roll and
S0618	yeah definitely definitely
S0619	yeah
S0618	so how be you what have you be up to
S0619	yeah i'm really good i'm good
S0618	
S0619	i'm so strong
S0618	you be i know
S0619	get stronger and stronger
S0618	yay
S0619	erm you know it's really funny if he really push it or i push myself and he sort of help
S0618	mm
S0619	er
S0618	when do you see him again
S0619	at ten today
S0618	today oh my god
S0619	yeah so that's why i'm sweat so much
S0618	mm
S0619	cos i run home have a shower eat hot food walk here
S0618	mm
S0619	with a coat on and it's really hot
S0618	it's really hot outside i know
S0619	my nose be sweat still
S0618	mm
S0619	erm so upper body really good erm i think sometimes surprise with how strong some part of my body be
S0618	yeah
S0619	and then really surprise er with how weak the rest some bits be
S0618	other bits be yeah
S0619	so we be you know do whatever and i be hold again this weight which weigh nothing half a bag of sugar and i be just like what
S0619	that's enough oh so he be like right do ten with this er tiny tiny weight and then do ten with just move your arm
S0619	it's just like i'm so weak my exercise be just move my arm up and down
S0618	oh my god have you ever be to a craniologist
S0619	no
S0618	it's erm like a bizarre branch of osteopathy or erm chiropractic or whatever
S0619	mm
S0618	erm and they play about with bits in your head
S0619	mm
S0618	and i use to see this guy i think he be a chiropractor primarily erm but he would do these sort of strength test things
S0619	mm
S0618	by get you to hold up an arm or push here or pull there or whatever and base on that and where he detect weaknesses
S0619	mm
S0618	he would then prod bits on my head and like really push into bits on your skull
S0619	mm
S0618	and then he'd like leave me to set for five minutes and then he'd come back and do the strength test again and it be so different
S0618	how weird be that
S0619	mm
S0618	so yeah google that
S0619	mm
S0618	craniology it's erm
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah it's nut i'm not sure of the science behind it but he obviously link it in with chiropractic
S0619	yeah no it's just you know i really work on you know if er if you notice like really quick improvements you tend to do that more than where the the improvements be slow
S0618	mm
S0619	so those bits naturally become the weakest over time
S0618	yeah
S0619	so whereas i can fling around eighteen kilos with one arm like it's nothing
S0618	yeah
S0619	i can't hold a two kilogram plate in front of me with
S0618	in front of you yeah
S0619	without like drop it or fall over
S0619	but oh it's all fine
S0618	good for you though
S0619	i'll get there it'll get there
S0618	well i'm please you can walk again that be a little bite of a concern these last few days so
S0619	i know cos i be when we get back i be just sort of google it and if you tear or pull a muscle there's three stag
S0618	mm
S0619	and the first one be it hurt but you don't have any sort of noticeable limp er you know you can still walk the second one which be what i think i have but quite severely be noticeable limp hurt to do anything twinge
S0618	yeah
S0619	and a slow pain it hurt even when you're sit or lie
S0618	yeah that be you
S0619	and then the third one be like completely fuck can't do anything at all ever
S0618	mm
S0619	and you hear when it happen you hear like a pop
S0618	oh okay
S0619	of like the muscle like come into piece
S0618	eh
S0619	i didn't have that one erm and it say
S0618	but you just have a bad number two
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	and it say sort of er a week two weeks until back to normal erm
S0618	you've be less than a week
S0619	yeah so
S0618	spirulina ah
S0619	well it still be sore and i say for the train on monday we'll just have to do upper body again
S0618	mm
S0619	i don't want it to go bad
S0618	yeah
S0619	and with the calve i just say only bodyweight
S0618	mm
S0619	no
S0618	no additional
S0619	two thirds of my bodyweight weight
S0618	jeez
S0619	erm
S0618	i know that's pretty crazy to start with really
S0619	mm yeah
S0618	and they're difficult muscle to warm up as well cos
S0619	uhu uhu
S0618	really you're sort of warm them up with your bodyweight cos that's
S0619	yeah
S0618	the minimum you can do and
S0619	yeah
S0618	sometimes that's just enough
S0619	so we'll just have to take it slowly
S0618	yeah
S0619	he say do you want to skip it all together i say no
S0618	no
S0619	because that's stupid we'll just have to do it really sort of sensibly
S0618	yeah
S0619	er cos you know the my legs can hack a hell of a lot like they can take a lot of weight
S0618	mm
S0619	erm but apart from my calve can't
S0618	yeah
S0619	but they will eventually
S0618	yeah you can do calf raise every time you make a cup of tea or something
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	and that will at least train sort of train the muscle to get use to work cos you don't
S0619	yeah
S0618	traditionally work those muscle unless you climb mountains every weekend
S0619	yeah or you're sort of reach up to put stuff on shelve
S0618	yeah
S0619	like that but most of the time not really but
S0618	yeah
S0619	anyway we'll see what happen
S0618	good for you that's brilliant
S0619	yeah so i'm feel really good
S0618	cool good
S0619	yeah and i just need yesterday to you know just
S0618	stare at the wall
S0619	well not necessarily stare at the wall but you know
S0618	mm
S0619	i clean on wednesday when
S0618	oh yeah
S0619	i get in and then yesterday i just spend more time
S0618	clean
S0619	you know do bore stuff like clear out the kitchen cupboards wipe them down and put stuff back in in a more logical order
S0618	mm
S0619	and do the same in my bedroom and sort out all my drawers
S0618	yeah that's really cool
S0619	i think it just help to get it do erm
S0618	and again to my mind the physical always always the last place to manifest so that's a lot of clear out on the inside
S0619	mm
S0618	that's
S0619	yeah
S0618	you know now a lot more readable on the outside
S0619	yeah and i have like so much energy to do it i think
S0618	good
S0619	stir crazy but
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah so it's it need er there's just dust and dirt and hair everywhere
S0618	mm
S0619	it's sweep cinderella
S0618	yeah
S0619	but yeah
S0618	i find dust seem to accumulate incredibly quickly
S0619	yeah
S0618	i've no i've no idea why unless it's because it's be cold and people have be burn all sort of shit
S0619	mm
S0618	cos there's generally a lot of black smoke chug out of chimneys
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i just presume people have save up all their plastic during the summer months
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	and as soon as winter start burn it erm but yeah they do do seem to be a lot of black smoke out of chimneys maybe it's residue from that come in mm
S0619	yeah i don't know
S0618	yeah it's weird
S0619	i suppose if you be put on layer and take them off
S0618	oh yeah
S0619	themselves and move around way more in the summer i don't know
S0618	dead skin yeah maybe
S0619	i don't know erm
S0618	no
S0619	it's cos your skin's drier in winter anyway i suppose
S0618	for sure
S0619	don't know erm but finally it's er some sort of assemblance of order
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos
S0618	good on you
S0619	i do my report
S0618	yeah
S0619	and half do my cv so bore
S0618	yeah
S0619	so bore
S0618	i take mine down to one side of a4 reasonably space and it just i find it a relief to be ruthless
S0619	i mine be one side of a4 er and i ask on twitter and it be like you know because i've get load of work experience work in retail what's that how be that relevant so i've just write i have six years of work experience er of work in retail full stop don't need to say where and where who give a fuck no language school in spain's gonna
S0618	yeah
S0619	ring a shop and go oh tell me about her
S0618	yeah
S0619	so like summer school celta
S0618	yeah
S0619	about me
S0618	if you've get space and could be arsed you could add a sentence or two of transferable skills
S0619	it's obvious though
S0618	from six years in retail i develop great interpersonal skills
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i can relate to everybody blah blah blah
S0619	i just don't think it's it's it's obvious it's not gonna have make me more antisocial to work in a shop for six years
S0618	this be true
S0619	and you know so i'm really and then i be like right no do it on two page and i be like oh but it look so nice on one
S0618	mm
S0619	and you know if i if i be look at cvs and it have everything on one page i'd be like well they're obviously and organise boom
S0618	mm
S0619	erm whereas i've see cvs of like three and four page and you're like
S0618	yeah
S0619	be you still harp on about duke of edinburgh you do when you're fifteen and you're now twenty seven
S0618	yeah
S0619	get a grip like
S0619	you you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	move on move on but i'm put it into two page with quite hefty erm bits for each school include you know the textbooks that i use
S0618	mm yep and i think the cv's an entirely different document for whatever job you're apply for
S0619	mm
S0618	so no two cvs of yours
S0619	yeah
S0618	look the same
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah i do recruitment for in various job roles for donkey's years and i didn't take cvs
S0619	mm
S0618	and if people didn't read the big thick bold print that say people who send cvs will have their applications ignore then
S0619	mm
S0618	you know more fool them so i use to ignore those and that stop a lot of on spec applications
S0619	mm
S0618	and people just fire them off which frankly piss me off i want to know that people want not just a job but my job
S0619	mm
S0618	and they wanna work for my organisation as part of my team
S0619	mm what so be it er like a a form with question
S0618	yeah so it be a form with question say you know not even some quite often with job you'll get the job description person specification and then it'll say look at that and then fill in the box to say how it apply erm but no i mine be more specific in say for this role you need this this and this skill tell us about a time when you have use these skills
S0619	mm
S0618	give examples erm so it's much more specific and it be the sort of application that if you do it properly would take a long time to fill in
S0619	yeah
S0618	but hopefully you then get the right people i mean
S0619	mm
S0618	and you do get people who be shit at fill in form but brilliant at do the job
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you can spot them a bite
S0619	mm
S0618	if they've have you know six years at this place which be similar
S0619	yeah
S0618	and ten years at that place which be similar whatever so yeah it be interest interest time
S0619	mm
S0618	have very high staff turnover one charitable organisation that i work for in the first two years i pretty much overhaul half the team
S0619	oh right
S0618	and get new people in who be magnificent make a big difference to the effective run of everything it be wonderful erm but because of that and i have so much
S0619	do you fire them or force them out or
S0618	erm people have the choice to get up to the standard or to go away
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and people that want to get up to the standard i be very supportive
S0619	mm
S0618	with train
S0619	mm
S0618	and erm also send them to other shop and sort of buddying them up with other managers
S0619	yeah
S0618	who they could take to and would support them as well erm some people couldn't be arsed
S0619	yep
S0618	didn't really like the job they be do anyway and probably better off out of it quite frankly and then and so i bring in very passionate people who love what they be do love the team and bring that energy to the table which be wonderful but anyway yeah so i use to do a lot of shortlist usually with a bottle of wine of an even erm but you do get a feel for it and that passion come through
S0619	mm mm
S0618	in what you read
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah but no if you see these yeah i suppose you have a basic template but then tweak it to the job you're apply for
S0619	mm i don't think it it matter so much though in this industry a job in a school be the the same
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't think it will it change mm really
S0618	yeah
S0619	between job between school that you're apply for
S0618	i don't know when i be look there be a lot that say you'll mostly be teach young learners or
S0619	mm yeah well yeah but i wouldn't be apply for those job
S0618	okay yeah me either yeah

S0619	oh be this the one with the erm where it give you
S0618	yeah
S0619	the translations
S0618	it's in english and you get english subtitle and at any time you can pause it and highlight the bite of the subtitle that you don't understand
S0619	yeah and save it for later
S0618	and and look at what it mean in polish and then you can save it for later and you can look for each episode you can do a print out a little review of what you learn from that episode
S0619	that's nice
S0618	and you can build it up over time as well to build up you know it's like a vocab build up over time
S0619	uhu
S0618	it's brilliant absolutely brilliant and i say to him at the end of the lesson you know i expect you to be a little bite slower or to have difficulty find the word
S0618	and he say that he felt it be a good erm a good lesson and he felt that it flow very well and he find it very easy and that's what he put it down to
S0619	mm
S0618	so exposure to the language i think that be really interest but it's obviously in a way that work for him as well and i think with he's very visual and he remember language when he see it and he see word write down
S0619	yeah say mm mm
S0618	yeah so that probably help him that it's in that format
S0619	yeah well i didn't do any spanish on tuesday wednesday
S0618	mm
S0619	monday tuesday wednesday
S0618	we be away yeah
S0619	erm and yesterday i do about three hours and it be the first hour i be just like oh god i can't remember any of these word
S0618	wow
S0618	and do you do it while you're do other stuff clean
S0619	no i can't
S0618	no no
S0619	i've gotta really
S0618	no i can't
S0619	sit and
S0618	yeah and concentrate
S0619	do it yeah no music nothing
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so it take me about two and a half hours to do all of the review
S0618	mm
S0619	no new language at all apart from at the end
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it be just review and review and review i be just like oh gosh the duck be still white
S0619	no it's more complicate than that now
S0618	yeah
S0619	i have speak to my brother
S0618	oh very good
S0619	which be quite excite
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah good stuff
S0619	so
S0618	my polish i'm still on it be bank it be studio be it a bank or a studio
S0619	oh no
S0618	it be a studio yes it's not a bank
S0619	so just abandon ship completely
S0618	ah i know
S0619	i'm at this level where i can just do whatever i need to do in in a day
S0618	mm i think polish would be if there weren't so many bloody syllables i keep come onto that and come back to that erm but when get back i'm definitely gonna get her round for a tea one day and get her to just write post it note on everything in my house what it's call
S0619	mm
S0618	erm and i'll write
S0619	but be it useful though if you need if like why do you need to know the word for kettle in polish like
S0618	well i've be look again at these work away websites and i think i'm gonna do a little tour of poland
S0619	mm
S0618	for summer and autumn er argentina i dunno i'm kind of attract to portugal spain now
S0619	yeah
S0618	portugal particularly erm for the winter months there seem to be so many opportunities and so many little eco villages all over portugal
S0619	uhu
S0618	i be so surprise and place that be look for people over winter as well
S0619	mm
S0618	have specifically say there be winter task here erm a lot of it be basic diy and paint and decorate
S0619	nice
S0618	i be a painter and decorator for six months like
S0619	oh so you've get the skills
S0618	way back when yeah so i've get the skills and i love it so yeah i can help out with that over winter i just think that'd be really nice and they have lot of place sort of between the mountains and the sea so it seem if you believe you know the distance that they've
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	put on their little profile page so that be good so yeah so polish will be helpful but then erm either spanish or portuguese
S0619	mm
S0618	probably portuguese we'll see
S0619	mm
S0618	so excite
S0619	how excite
S0618	i know yeah
S0619	so good for you
S0618	yeah and a lot of the polish place actually be with erm polish families where they don't speak any english
S0619	uhu
S0618	or they've get a younger child who speak english but they don't live there
S0619	yeah sure
S0618	but you can talk to them on skype sort of thing so i think that's probably the best way to learn a language
S0619	mm
S0618	rather than hang out with polish people who be english teachers

S0619	er you know mm
S0618	it's good
S0619	sense of achievement i guess

S0618	mm
S0619	a little bite every day so

S0618	what lesson plan and
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah good on you
S0619	just er just a couple it'll only take a few hours and then i won't have to erm
S0618	mm
S0619	really panic next week
S0618	oh and both and ask me again this week when exactly i'm finish and if there be any other natives in
S0618	so if you like
S0619	uhu

S0619	ah i just erm
S0618	if you if you're not incline to do it don't
S0619	i really need to think about it because

S0619	you know it would be great to have the money and you know it's only an er a couple of hours a week
S0618	mm and it's easy money
S0619	i think that's part of it like
S0618	mm
S0619	i dunno
S0618	so if you think about you maybe you know at the most get an hour's prep for an hour's lesson
S0619	mm
S0618	and you're pay thirty thirty five złoty for this there's very little prep it's an hour and you get sixty and they come to your house and there's no travel so you've get no travel time very little prep time all of your money be yours
S0619	and what be their availabilities
S0618	erm i see of a morning eight be erm and at six of an even erm live in live in but he travel a lot and work a lot
S0619	mm

S0618	he's so funny there's they're chalk and cheese this pair arrive at six on the dot i will swear he sit in his car round the corner
S0619	mm
S0618	and then drive when it's exactly time
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	and he leave exactly on time i think i tell you yesterday be it yesterday or the day before he be twenty minutes late so pay me for an hour but just do forty minutes and be off again just rush in rush out
S0618	oh er hi bye
S0619	uhu uhu
S0618	yeah for forty minutes and off he go again so but have a ponder anyway but if you don't want to then don't if it doesn't feel right then don't

S0618	mm
S0619	hook onto a kitchen cupboard
S0618	right
S0619	and yesterday he come in and be like oh be there a dustpan and brush and i be like yeah it's in the cupboard under the sink and he sort of open the cupboard and go oh like he hadn't realise there be a cupboard there
S0619	and a bin

S0618	i would imagine a man that doesn't think i wonder if there's a bin in this entire house probably have no thoughts about you whatsoever
S0618	he's probably not really that aware that he's share a flat
S0619	comparable to a bin
S0619	yeah
S0618	i just mean from the viewpoint of you know how far his conscious ideas extend
S0619	yeah yeah yeah

S0618	cool you're do really well on that aren't you
S0619	well i'm only read book write by women
S0618	yeah
S0619	so and it's not very many on the one hundred book you should read before you die
S0618	mm
S0619	cos these book be write by the patriarchy
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i read interestingly david bowie's top one hundred book
S0618	oh
S0619	and there be two women on the whole list so i think fuck you i'm not read any
S0618	what
S0619	yeah
S0618	really
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	how bizarre
S0619	so i'm just
S0618	you'd've expect better from him
S0619	yep
S0618	anyway
S0619	so i'm steadfast steadfastly
S0619	only read book write by women so i've send him
S0618	good for you
S0619	this book that i'm read at the moment send my dad erm just a case for his tablet that he want and i'll buy him game of throne dvd when it come out in march
S0618	cool
S0619	and that's it so i need to send some card
S0618	my latest book be not write by a man or a woman it's write by er an energetic personality essence
S0619	nice
S0618	i know so where do that come on the list
S0619	god fill in a form where it say what what er how would you define your gender
S0618	yeah energetic personality essence i like that
S0618	yeah it's channel through a woman though so
S0619	uhu
S0618	if that count but
S0619	i saw something online about erm a school er a high school that ask its students to say what gender they be as part of a study and there be twenty three options
S0618	mm wow
S0619	but like no definitions for the options
S0618	okay
S0619	so unless you like know
S0618	yeah
S0619	the gender you be sort of for sure
S0618	unless you agree the understand behind what be mean by a particular term
S0619	yeah they be so pointless just like how don't even know what some of these be myself
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm but it be like really it's interest they say boy girl male female
S0618	oh right
S0619	as though you might sort of identify as sort of be i don't know a younger person
S0618	yeah
S0619	as oppose to a
S0618	how interest
S0619	i don't know
S0618	yeah
S0619	and then sort of non binary binary gender fluid
S0618	binary what gender fluid
S0618	huh
S0619	yeah so
S0618	it's interest
S0619	non binary you're not either
S0618	if
S0619	or you're somewhere in between
S0618	yeah
S0619	or
S0618	oh er binary yeah as in both i think we're all kind of both and neither
S0619	yeah exactly
S0618	yeah i mean you know physiologically speak
S0619	yeah
S0618	most people can be define by one or the other but
S0619	yeah and then
S0618	yeah
S0619	gender fluid would be er it depend on your day
S0618	yeah
S0619	or what's you know in the wash or i don't know maybe not what's in the wash but
S0619	well i've only get the two
S0618	so
S0619	don't wash
S0618	so female today yeah we'll see about next week
S0618	ah dear it do seem a little bite pointless in so many regard
S0619	mm
S0618	it's a bite like erm in northern ireland they still ask you be you catholic prod or
S0619	mm
S0618	whatever and
S0619	yeah
S0618	i have to tick catholic because you know i'm very anti religion as you know and anti dogma but erm you have to tick the catholic box if you live in a catholic community
S0619	oh
S0618	and i live in a very predominantly catholic community
S0619	uhu uhu
S0618	where even people that don't believe in god all still go to church on sundays
S0619	yeah
S0618	or on saturday night erm
S0619	so yeah and i think stuff like religion and stuff like sexuality
S0618	mm yeah
S0618	gender i mean how many ways can humanity divide itself
S0619	yeah
S0618	and it's all part of divide and conquer i mean really you just tick human for the most part
S0619	yeah
S0618	but i wonder if there might even come a point where humans as a species don't even necessarily identify as human because they recognise extra energetic personality essences
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	which be form part of their humanity but be a larger part of themselves
S0619	i'm sort of tear by this and i don't have an answer really as to the sort of question of label should we label each other should everybody be put in this box
S0618	no
S0619	er to identify themselves but then i you know and i think it's probably inherently wrong
S0618	mm
S0619	but at the same time then how do you how do you know
S0618	how do you know if diversity wise you'll be equally representative if you don't monitor these things yeah
S0619	yeah like it's you know you need to monitor you well you don't need to monitor
S0618	yeah
S0619	think it should be monitor and stuff erm there not that there should be no maybe there there should be statistics there should be sort of you know
S0618	mm
S0619	things you there should be some degree of erm identification
