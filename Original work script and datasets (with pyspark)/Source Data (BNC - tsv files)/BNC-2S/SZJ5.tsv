S0161	yeah sometimes yeah
S0072	yeah i mean it there's be quite a wide variety over the years of people that have
S0161	yes i think with it be the first one this be what they tend to do wasn't it keep it as wide as they possibly could i've never actually do one it's on my to do list l
S0072	yeah
S0161	but the thing i think i the one i would everybody say glastonbury but i actually quite fancy womad because i love world music
S0072	yeah smaller festivals be
S0161	yeah that's true besides i've get
S0072	i'd i'd quite like to go to a small one cos that's one of the problems i think with glastonbury be it's just the size
S0161	it's just so big isn't it yes
S0072	have to queue for like six hours and
S0161	that's not on be it yeah have be to womad two or three time
S0072	yeah whereabouts be it

S0072	no well my parent have get a house in spain so i'm well off
S0161	oh good you be well off
S0072	but cos it's i've be that many time now it's kind of it's still a holiday but it's
S0161	yes but it's it's not
S0072	but it's sort of also see them and my granddad live in spain as well
S0161	i see yes
S0072	so it doesn't seem as much like a holiday
S0161	something else i must admit this year because of that that sit that be in the eh that guy be advertise on marketplace you know the one who be do the the cheap flat on the costa del sol hundred and fifty quid a week between january and may
S0072	right yeah
S0161	two bedroomed apartment five minutes' walk from the beach ria del sol so we think right we'll give that a bite of a try no problems cos i like spain and spanish be one of my languages so i can actually get round on it
S0072	so have you already be
S0161	em we've be to we've be to barcelona twice and we've be to valencia eh barcelona be partly with the family one year on an architect's trip on the occasion as the valencia one be which be great marry my own guide book very handy don't have to worry about that but we've never actually do the costa del sol so we think we'd give it a try and we're go in june so it's not too hot
S0072	too right
S0161	which be a thing for me love heat i wilt no good with it at all
S0072	mm it's the same with with my nan cos she she live in spain for eleven years

S0072	we go to em we go to greece a couple of years back and we go in july cos we have to because lou be go on em placement and i be absolutely wipe out there we be in greece and it as absolutely gorgeous it be a dry heat but july be be too warm for me and we think to come back after and the lass behind the lass in the hotel reception say don't come in august she say even the fly be too hot but she say you you i know you need to be there before october because they close everything down in october when we be in pefkohori i be talk to the lady who run the one of the souvenir shop and she say they all close up completely at the begin of october begin to middle and they all go back to chalkidiki which be where most of the live but peph be gorgeous little you know very small coastal town really really nice and the best one of the nicest small town square i've ever see in my and lot of mini supermarkets as soon as the kid find the cold beer and they get a they get a free cool band with it so they use to fill it with can and waft down to down to the beach
S0072	sound good

S0072	i be still only twenty so i couldn't go to any bar or anything
S0161	oh right yes of course yeah that stupid eh that stupid yeah
S0072	it be still go though so we be there for five days
S0161	excellent
S0072	but i'd quite like to go to new york not to new york city to the state and see all the quiet part rather than
S0161	yeah somebody i use to teach with he and his wife go down the eastern seaboard for their twenty fifth wed anniversary and say it be amaze he say the time be then you get all the tree and it's really good i've not do the state 's be again he go down the eastern seaboard and again we have a friend of a friend a musician play keyboards for when be on tour and live in tulsa live in oklahoma somewhere he's a head case silver smithing from that and doors the way the em it it it's what they don't hat indoors and everybody be raise an eyebrow it this be what the man do but he have this most fantastic silver banner which he make in colour card definitely it be really nice i would like to go to the state but i think we're go to have to win the lottery to do it
S0072	that that's my dream too win the lottery and the six months buy a clap out old banger and just drive around for
S0161	oh that would be good yeah yeah one of my colleagues from stockport she and her partner they do colorado and they go through maybe where the big bat be you know what be they call you know the desert there oh what's it's call where they film all the westerns you know the one i mean don't you

S0072	not sure
S0161	ah but you you know the place i mean and her her photograph be to die for
S0072	yeah it must be amaze
S0161	absolutely yeah and i think we will probably be go to eh to sussex we've get friends down there so we go on a camp holiday and for a week
S0072	that's what i'm look to do cos we've never be to cornwall
S0161	cornwall be great
S0072	and with not go to glastonbury this year i i kind of i like the fact glastonbury do feel like a holiday definitely be normally it be nice weather although this past year it be horrible but i i be think maybe instead of go abroad
S0161	cornwall be nice
S0072	this year yeah might be have a british holiday i
S0161	yeah if you decide you want to do that let me know cos i we've get friends who have just move back from bermuda to just outside st oswald so if you want to go down there let me have a word with and for you and find out what it's like it's good oh no cornwall anywhere down the south west dorset's get quite a lot to recommend it and that's not just because i grow up there em you've get more more prehistory than you can throw a stick at i mean i be wander round a medieval site when i be a kid and don't not a medieval like a stone bronze age site it be badbury ring it be call and eh completely unaware of the significance i mean now ill be back there one of life's ambitious to get on time team if i'm to still still steal fill hat
S0072	i think that's the thing about this country that
S0161	we've get the weather
S0072	it's like yeah once you've get the weather
S0161	you need yeah if you get the weather you wouldn't need go anywhere i mean the southwest of scotland be fantastic all that all of that from argyle down to shire be absolutely stun it's beautiful but you
S0072	there be so many place
S0161	yeah but you need the weather
S0072	yeah i mean that's the thing you can book for
S0161	yeah
S0072	five days and then if it be rain
S0161	and northumbria be nice the north eastern coast be great em we take louise when she be a baby she could only have be about eighteen months we take her we go up to em be it annock go up to annock stay in this sort of convert country house you could kind have a party in the bathroom absolutely great
S0072	we we a couple of years ago my friend get a house be abesoth
S0161	oh abersoch make me laugh
S0072	we be there for for a week it rain the whole time
S0161	of course of course
S0072	but it be a really good holiday
S0161	i go we we we've get a friend who's get a caravan down on which be just a bite north of abersoch on the coast and we go to abersoch and i'm think why be everybody rave about this place it's get one main street you know i grow up in sussex eastbourne you've get a pier to go at you've get beachy head you've get langley point you know i'm think this be not a sea side resort this be a small town that everybody have make a fuss about but it be quite good fun watch watch the juvenile cheshire set play and take the boat out but in fairness to them they be lovely kid and they be really nice with each other small brothers and sisters manners immaculate nice people no nothing beautifully behave kid
S0072	yeah it be it be yeah nice there
S0161	you you people spot in abersoth people spot
S0072	well i mean if the weather be nice it would have be amaze we go
S0161	oh yeah
S0072	yeah on the beach for about half an hour to an hour just to
S0161	ah no
S0072	we felt we have to
S0161	yes quite to make a point
S0072	but then we just walk
S0161	yes
S0072	and just go to the pub and
S0161	i'll tell you where's good for that we go down to st david's and i go down on a rid holiday last summer and there be a beach just not far out of st david's call new something or other i'd have to look it up and it's three miles end to end and it be hardly island it be quite chill it be july but it be quite chill and we just walk we go that end and we go right the way back down again and it be gorgeous because i mean stick my feet in the water and you've lose me i have paddle in the baltic just on principle by god it be cold and i didn't find any amber so i have to get to buy me some i think we've run out of steam hal be that enough i be when my kid be small they use to go to a methodist ah playgroup which be base in a methodist church and eh i be in there and they be discuss fundraise and they be talk about they be you know they're have a springier or something like discuss fundraise and i say eh why don't you have a raffle
S0072	mm
S0161	well of course methodist view of raffle be gamble now if you mean holy roman everybody will be in raffle nobody think about it
S0072	that's true
S0161	it's gamble i say no it's not it's a raffle vera wouldn't talk to me for about the next three weeks i mean we do the lottery here but we do it as a syndicate
S0072	what what happen when it launch cos i never really think about this
S0161	absolutely no idea absolutely
S0072	cos be it ninety four when it
S0161	oh get be it that far back i be bring up children at that stage so i can't remember but eh
S0072	it must have be controversial but you be right though cos they don't think of em raffle or bingo
S0161	no no no bingo be you know bloody some some some of the methodists i think they do it for i mean i would never i'll chop that it because basically what we do be if we save save money it go in the deposit for the christmas meal
S0072	yeah
S0161	so really it's quite an effective way of save for something that we all want to do and keep the price within an intelligent limit
S0072	yeah
S0161	so if you view it as a save thing and also the way interest rat be at the moment you know you might as well put it in the lottery before you get a
S0072	you might yeah
S0161	of course apparently the bigger the syndicate you have the more chance you have of win but eh we have a flutter on the grand national but be of irish stock i don't do gamble i've get to say but what would you do if you win it
S0072	i've i've be ask this question a lot and i think buy an old banger drive round america
S0161	that'd be good
S0072	eh i wouldn't be particular flash i wouldn't go go crazy
S0161	no no no no no no i don't think i would either
S0072	i think i'd just buy maybe buy a house buy a house in didsbury which would obviously be nice
S0161	what for buy in didsbury there's more interest place than didsbury but yeah yeah
S0072	i suppose yeah but i don't know i it just be strange to win like the euro millions
S0161	oh good grief yes
S0072	eh that lady in ireland dolores wasn't it she win a hundred and eighteen million
S0161	wow what would you do with it
S0072	i definitely wouldn't go public
S0161	oh no no
S0072	which be what she do
S0161	i must be quite honest i think a lot of mine i think i would set my kid up
S0072	yeah
S0161	with with a house each and give enough to finish his train and and maybe two or three years money to keep go for two or three years i'd make sure we'd get enough i'd make sure they'd get enough money to look after and i get a decent pension and then frankly i would give a load of it away
S0072	yeah
S0161	and it go to the cancer charities to place like christies and st anne's you know i some of my favourite ones you know animal charities things like that cos what you know what can you spend it on
S0072	yeah what can you do i i i think i'd open a business
S0161	oh that'd be a good idea
S0072	but i wouldn't want to just fritter my money away and not do anything there i'd find it weird
S0161	no no no absolutely not what what kind of business would you
S0072	i'd probably open a bar or a restaurant or something like that yeah
S0161	oh good good good you'd probably get business off this place wouldn't you
S0072	well exactly
S0161	what sort of bar just a bar any would you would you theme it
S0072	like a nice cocktail bar i think
S0161	that'd be good middle of town or
S0072	yeah middle of town an old an old bank or an old build jamie's oliver have just open an italian hasn't he in eh
S0161	that's right yes and it's a apparently that build which i didn't know although i should have guess look at it now i think what i would do the other thing i would do be put enough money on one side to be able to do a post grad course in creative write
S0072	yeah same i'd go yeah i'd go back to uni definitely do a master's in
S0161	what would you do
S0072	yeah politics i don't know what not sure what but something to do with cos my undergrad be in politics
S0161	right i see
S0072	em yeah definitely
S0161	yeah oh yeah and place i would have to go definitely moscow and st petersburg definitely cairo for the pyramid and definitely madrid for the plada and probably paris as well but em and i of and the other place easter island cos i love i love easter island head they're my favourite statues ever since i saw and utterly brilliant cartoon little little carton in one of the i the student rad rad mag at glasgow
S0072	yeah
S0161	and it be a there's this easter island paper just in profile and then an indian come up bend down put a bunch of flower in front of the easter island head and the next picture it's get a smile on its face and i've be a fan of easter island easter island head ever since so just i like the way some of them have get hat some of them have get no hat and nobody's get a flame clue how they get there and the other thing i'd do i think i would em i'd ask nicely if i could go and join time team for at least one programme cos i'm an archaeology nut
S0072	why not a series it would be too much work
S0161	no i wouldn't mind that actually i think i'm marry with two children you know work's not a problem but em i think i'd like i want to steal phil harding's hat or one of phil harding's hat and possibly nick aston's jumper but i just i just love it i'm eh you know and in fact one of them down at em aha i stick my head round prof 's door and say do they ever take volunteer on the dig and he be actually quite you know this be obviously quite with this who be they mad person want to go and dig for because he
S0072	they're em they're do a dig in hume at the moment where em
S0161	so i believe
S0072	on stretford and berley field
S0161	right what do they find
S0072	i'm not sure they it's part of mm they in didsbury and move it to hume
S0161	yes yes yes yeah
S0072	em so they've just i can see that there be something there i think it's a road or the remain of a build or something that they dig up
S0161	well give that manchester be a roman be be a roman settlement wasn't it because they must obviously have have a camp here hence hence the chester castra yes cool what aren't there bits of down at castlefield
S0072	yes there's the roman
S0161	yeah so the chance be if you go to the outlayer and chester be a a roman camp as well you might have have a connect link as well hey how time team can come back and look for a row between but no i be em do you there be one last week and em tony robinson be tell phil harding off for come on in a rip shirt and phil harding say it's clean what's the problem which one nick aston roll up and phil harding be complain to him about the fact tony robinson be grumble about this eh this rip shirt nick aston say well he say he say when it's rip beyond use he say you cut the button off and use it for something else at which point tony robinson go and walk away
S0072	sustainable
S0161	absolutely sustainable yes yes
S0072	reuse recycle
S0161	yeah and there be the do you see the one program where they would they'd make them cocktails for some reason and phil harding take one mouthful and these face quite clearly say can somebody get me a proper drink the man seem to like his beer you know so you'd open a bar you'd go round america and anything else
S0072	yeah i don't know travel i'd always travel
S0161	yeah yeah
S0072	i think the danger with have a big win like that be that you'd get bore
S0161	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0072	unless bore of travel but if you didn't do anything
S0161	yeah
S0072	just buy a big house and
S0161	i couldn't be do with that
S0072	i just couldn't imagine what would you what would you concern yourself with what would your day be fill on
S0161	yes exactly exactly i think that that's why i say i i think i would give a pretty high percentage of it away
S0072	yeah
S0161	you know have it have it go and have it go and do something useful for other people
S0072	yeah definitely partly i think probably cos that's the way i be bring up
S0161	yeah
S0072	yeah so people must get so bore when they win i they don't do anything win a huge amount
S0161	yeah yeah
S0072	em and i remember that the woman in ireland she have to have security twenty four seven follow her and her children round just cos obviously people around her know where she live because she live em
S0161	yes yes oh no i mean i'd get rid of it
S0072	yeah i definitely wouldn't go public
S0161	i i would i i would i would get rid of it and then there's no reason for anybody to come pursue in you because you can't give them anything
S0072	yeah there's programme on at the moment on bbc one call the syndicate which be a drama about eh a syndicate of people
S0161	oh yes and and the whole thing seem the whole live the inference be that their whole live all apart
S0072	yeah
S0161	well if you em there be that amaze documentary well drama doc docu drama form eh about vivienne nicholson
S0072	right
S0161	who be the first and they call it spend spend spend
S0072	yeah
S0161	and she just get rid of the whole lot jut just blow it and
S0072	there's a sixteen year old girl from workington that win the lottery she she spend it all and as well he eh
S0161	oh that's right i remember him
S0072	he spend it all as well
S0161	yeah
S0072	em but sixteen and win that much money
S0161	well unless you've get very sensible parent how the hell be you go to know what to do with it i think also the thing be if you've get other people to spend to spend it on as i have you know two kid a horse em and i think i'd probably spend the money to to get our own house really which be go to do anyway but if we've get other people to do it for us we could probably do it a bite faster which would be good but no i i suspect that have lot of money be be more responsibility than anything else and it's not one i think i i would do my utmost to get to get rid of it you know
S0072	yeah it's all relative isn't it you'd soon get use to
S0161	yeah absolutely yeah
S0072	what originally you think be amaze just become bore after
S0161	which i i think be probably what would in fact we be talk about it this morning we all say we reckon say quarter a million or half a million would probably do us do us quite nicely cos i think you could do most of what you want to do seriously
S0072	definitely
S0161	and then just have a bite of and incentive i certainly wouldn't stop work
S0072	no
S0161	i'd get bore
S0072	i'd get bore
S0161	and also probably kill my husband i don't know whether you'd kill your partner but i would definite kill my husband
S0072	probably
S0161	which be one of the reason why i've go on work cos i love him to death but twenty four hours a day oh no
S0072	i think my dad's worry about that when he retire in june about he he do he's a yoga teacher as well
S0161	right
S0072	he start yoga about five years ago and he teach teach science and maths and he go on a yoga teach course he do that now two even a week
S0161	he can do that when he go over there
S0072	yeah i think when he go over there he's just go to
S0161	i think the expats will probably bite his hand off
S0072	yeah do it a few days a week cos it cos it's a bite strange to retire and then
S0161	well i reckon i reckon reckon he doesn't know i be how he have time to go work i remember my dad say that but you know i'm i'm regularly a beer widow
S0072	right
S0161	because they they saw big in recognise a good organise talent when they saw one so he be now quiet heavily involve in organise the beer festival so we don't go anywhere at the end of may begin of june cos my husband be run the beer festival
S0072	how big be how big be it
S0161	it's quite big they use county's grind and you know the the runway underneath they've put it down there which mean it's absolutely like a furnace it really be do you need to deal with that bod
S0072	yes yeah can do
