S0519	you can just delete them and they come up in order with the time that you take it on and
S0520	yeah
S0519	and you can even name it and everything so
S0520	definitely
S0519	it's a very neat
S0520	i don't even know i don't even remember why i have a oh no because i i record the retreat on my phone as a backup cos we have like an official record that we you know that's really good quality
S0519	mm
S0520	of anadi when he give talk erm but sometimes it fail for whatever reason
S0519	you just have to
S0520	record it with my phone so so i i download this application voice recorder application on to my phone but i didn't you know consider the options at the time i just quickly do it
S0519	yeah
S0520	whatever come up first but maybe it's just not a good app
S0519	mm
S0520	i sellotape my tweezers together
S0519	i've get lot of pair of tweezers
S0520	i need to buy some
S0519	well no i've get lot quite a few good ones
S0520	oh there
S0519	so and i've get a little mini pair that you might like but er
S0520	i've get a big grey streak come through
S0519	woohoo
S0520	i'm not old yet so it feel that it's unfair
S0519	it be entirely unfair
S0520	i don't think i'm as bad a but she's have a few more years than me
S0519	have she er have she get quite a few
S0520	she dye it but you you when she doesn't dye it you see
S0519	i know she do the the you know
S0520	she's do highlight hasn't she
S0519	yes and a rinse dye
S0520	yeah
S0519	that's what i use to do for a long time
S0520	that'll do yeah but when she doesn't dye it she's get quite a few i've just get a few right at the front
S0519	i've be interest see as i've get my little blond lock
S0520	oh yeah
S0519	to actually see that i've get quite a little bite of dark still
S0520	oh yeah
S0519	very little but a little bite of dark and certainly at the back er so i will have some colour
S0520	yeah exactly
S0519	erm i wish you could have like a very thick tooth comb and just go like that and that and put a brown dye in that much you know
S0520	what like yeah
S0519	just like brown streak
S0520	as if it be brown
S0519	it's as if it be brown
S0520	yeah i think you just need to go to a really good hairdresser like once
S0519	i will i will
S0520	and get them their advice about it and maybe the trick seem to be to dye it grey
S0519	somebody be it you that say that
S0520	if you want it yeah
S0519	yeah die but i don't really want to do that the whole point be to get rid of the thing but
S0520	no no no as a as a step through as a step stone through
S0519	yes
S0520	and then you know it doesn't matter if you have to go to the hairdresser a couple of time a year
S0519	yeah i think once this have be cut now there'll be a lot less of the yellow might go a tiny bite shorter
S0520	yeah
S0519	and just get rid of quite a bite of yellow
S0520	get the yellow out
S0519	erm but no i know what you mean if i if i twice a year have some kind of nice highlight
S0520	that's what i mean
S0519	that would be a nice thing
S0520	like yeah you don't want to be again have to go every three weeks
S0519	three weeks dye my hair dye it grey
S0519	i can provide that on my own

S0519	cos the guy his job be get the erm the the the sort of proof through to us if we're go to be sell it at conventions supposedly
S0520	i know
S0519	erm and he suppose to have get the proof through and they go back and forward and back and forward and he's still finish off some other chorus's cd
S0520	no ways
S0519	and we've not even hear the proof yet so and he keep say no it'll be fine don't worry well they're they're really worry
S0520	don't worry
S0519	the music team want to you know really have time to do some edit
S0520	that's annoy
S0519	yeah
S0520	so you've not hear it
S0519	so we've not hear any of it yet no
S0520	i'm go to
S0519	and we have erm we have erm our own one of our own girls who's go to university just his year to study art
S0520	oh yeah
S0519	design the cover he be go to design it for us but erm she's design it
S0520	oh right
S0519	and we've see the proof of that it's beautiful
S0520	mm
S0519	erm
S0520	so be you go to sell it on itunes as well
S0519	i doubt it no i think it'll just be a word of mouth sell erm i'm go to turn my side of the heat apparatus down so feel free
S0520	yeah it's quite warm isn't it the sun's actually shin so
S0519	yeah so if you turn this down it's the coolness of the air on your face
S0520	right
S0519	so and then it come out of here and so you can have cooler air on your face which be sometimes nice
S0520	be dad go to let you upgrade the car never
S0519	erm well i plan that
S0519	erm when he when he get his retirement fund so i i have vaguely hint at it
S0519	i've make a plan and dad have make a plan in his head
S0520	good for you
S0519	no we've have this whole big thing that we have to solve yet
S0520	which be
S0519	which be erm that erm i we dad and i always assume we would just take his whole pension package as a monthly salary and when he go to the retirement sort of course that erm be provide erm they talk about options of take lump sum of different size and you can take a huge lump sum the maximum be about half a million pound so we're talk huge lump sum
S0520	as a percentage of your pension
S0519	as a percentage of your pension and then you get a lot smaller pension monthly and you invest the lump sum or do things with the lump sum whatever you want to do you know so you could use it for certain things to start you out and then invest the rest and erm they be say if you if you just invest it and you get be per cent per annum of it will be investment then it would entirely replace the money that you have miss
S0519	monthly yeah
S0520	monthly but the plus side be that of course you also have half a million pound to leave to your children instead of your pension be go when you've go do you see the difference
S0520	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0519	so you've actually get half a million pound you're not lose out on your on your pension or monthly salary but you've get this lump sum as well
S0520	yeah
S0519	which perhaps later in your life you could start use
S0520	to what degree be it go to reduce your monthly income
S0519	er well it do reduce it quite a lot so what we need to do erm dad go and talk to the bank of course erm and what he really talk about be what sort of investments he could do so that we wouldn't touch the lump sum at present and we would replace any of the money that we lose erm with you know a a moderate risk investment erm and i i'm just really nervous about the whole thing like you know i i want us to feel really comfortable monthly and not have to worry about that
S0520	definitely
S0519	erm cos dad's personality be such that if you have a lot less that he could you know cope with that
S0520	no he couldn't
S0519	and also that dad you know his whole tie everything all up scenario mean you then be
S0520	i be just about to say that
S0519	live on less and you can't get at the benefit
S0520	i be about to say if you take the lump sum dad's tendency would be to lock it up somewhere
S0519	absolutely and we wouldn't be
S0520	and you'd be on ration and eat bean on toast
S0519	yes this be the whole thing that worry me
S0520	you have to figure out what your monthly
S0519	so we need to decide that by next may so we've get time
S0520	you have to you have to maybe er figure out what your monthly
S0519	yes
S0520	expenditures be you know i know it's hard to tell
S0519	no that's right
S0520	because things change but roughly you know because i imagine it's quite a lot
S0519	it it's funny because we we've since we've be live here and dad be so worry about the money and that's what i want to wipe away i don't want that
S0520	absolutely yeah
S0519	erm it's in his nature to be worry
S0520	yeah
S0519	about it and but it it make life hard because we weren't we weren't relax and enjoy we you know we haven't be on a big holiday we didn't do all these things and i want to do all the adventure you know while we're young erm so it it but we find that we can live quite moderately but i don't live at all now in the same way that i do where i don't think about money if i want something or i want to give something i didn't even think when dad be earn in the last years i just do whatever i want i never think about it
S0520	of course well that's the goal isn't it
S0519	and that be the luxury that we what we'd earn over all those years of of work for it
S0520	yeah
S0519	but this year i don't i don't i don't feel that at all i feel
S0520	no it's depress
S0519	i have to think about everything if i want to give anybody money i have to think about it you know i have i have to you know i haven't get much myself so i haven't get that liberate feel er so it it need a lot of think and
S0520	yeah
S0519	a lot of assurances you know that erm that we would be so comfortable that we that we could regain an element of that luxury feel
S0520	yeah well that's
S0519	we don't have to spend all the time cos i think i probably get into quite bad habit erm you know and now i i realise i you know we could still sort of be luxurious without be wasteful
S0520	yeah fair enough i do wonder though like of it if dad's get three two thirds of his final salary as a pension that's right isn't it
S0519	yes
S0520	two thirds
S0519	more even
S0520	and you're not earn but you don't have a mortgage
S0519	no that's right
S0520	and what else don't you have
S0519	erm so what er we we just don't have the mortgage that's the big things
S0520	yeah that's the big thing so
S0519	erm which at the at the
S0520	which dad be pay off at the rate of
S0519	and yeah hugely
S0519	so it be about two and a half thousand a month dad be pay off so he could get rid of it
S0520	so two and a half time twelve be like let's say thirty grand a year
S0519	and and then that's after tax you know so erm i think what dad work out
S0520	i'm just say whether you would you know you're roughly in term of spendable money
S0519	yes what he do be yeah
S0520	what's the word expendable income whether you be go to have more or less the same as you do when he be work
S0519	i think that's what he work out and what he forget be that my salary be in the last years quite small about sixteen thousand
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm and there be something else erm he forget to think about erm but that that's not nothing and erm
S0520	not at all and that's you be yours
S0519	and that be mine and erm
S0520	jolly
S0519	and so i think he forget that we would be lose that so we will be a little less well off but then eventually we will get our pension at sixty seven i'll get my pension which will replace a bite of that erm i don't know we won't be much worse off anyway
S0520	like you say like it's no well it's important to to for dad to get his head around that cos he's get this weird mentality of like i'm on my pension but it just doesn't really apply do it if that's the if that's your pension he's not get a state pension you know so he he have he have to kind of acknowledge like that you're just as well off in term of and then he have to have some some pot that be accessible for things which be like
S0519	yeah
S0520	extraneous expense like for instance when you move you're go to have to buy a lot of stuff
S0519	yeah yes that's right
S0520	furniture decorate the natural
S0519	change the house
S0520	change the house yeah
S0519	yeah
S0520	yeah and that's not go to be part of your monthly outgo right
S0519	mm
S0520	it's not like a monthly thing so there have to be somewhere from somewhere from where you're go to take that money for those type of things holiday and erm trip and what have you you know that that's
S0519	no that's right
S0520	he have to know you don't mind really
S0519	no
S0520	it's just for dad it's just a case of like have it in his mind you know because he somehow feel as if he doesn't have money which be completely ludicrous and it's just because it's not accessible
S0519	no that's right
S0520	so he need to have accessible bits for the purpose of your spend and enjoyment allocate i guess that's what this big pot would be wouldn't it if you take the money out first at the if you take the the pot from the pension and then
S0519	yes
S0520	keep the rest for monthly instalments
S0519	yes erm
S0520	yeah you want to keep some of it sort of like liquid
S0519	mm that's right or something that's pay you a monthly dividend or pay you
S0520	yeah
S0519	a an annual dividend that you divvy out i don't know but erm
S0520	yeah so the bank advise him to take the pot do they
S0519	well no the
S0520	oh
S0520	pension fund say that the majority of people take the lump sum and these be the reason but erm they they also talk about the reason that be very hard for dad to get his head round which be that you actually do something with the er pot like that you use some of it right at the begin for some things that you've maybe always want erm that you know anything
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm that you have a plan of what what what would be nice to do with this money
S0520	to do with it yeah
S0519	it's such a huge amount of money erm and so funnily enough that's what the bank manager reiterate he say you know to take this huge amount of money to invest be erm it's not really the only way you should be look at it that you should be look at the money as what can i do with it
S0520	yeah
S0519	er for me
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm and invest it but you should maybe have a plan of what why would you take it you may as well just have the luxury of know you've get this money
S0520	yeah
S0519	i don't know it's i can't get my head round it and i wasn't at any of the conversations that be have
S0520	oh
S0519	erm so i'd like to be
S0520	yeah you should be
S0519	mm i i my one criticism of dad it's a kind of a a i he's so clever that he doesn't even with financial things he doesn't tend to have get his head round erm the tax situation the differences you know and he'll sometimes just suddenly say he doesn't know if that's pre or after tax or whatever and you think well that actually
S0520	make all the difference
S0519	negate
S0520	yeah
S0519	the whole conversation we may as well just wait till we find out you know erm and you you can have things like capital gain tax which be huge tax like forty per cent on erm one one of the pot of money that he's put away we will be have to have capital gain if we release any of it i be like really you do that erm and then he say well we can have so much a year without capital gain and we can take that each but it be all very woolly you know like how it all work you would need a taxman to help you or a you know an accountant to get his head round all of the things you should do
S0520	he's very clever but he's not he lack common sense
S0519	he's not practical no
S0520	and that's very typical of very intellectual people
S0519	yes that's right
S0520	like they don't know how to tie their shoelaces you know it's like that kind of thing so it's i mean i do trust him to know what he's do but on the other hand
S0519	i do he do tend to miss
S0520	cos your decisions could actually your input could actually be really really valuable
S0519	absolutely so i think i'd like to be part of the next
S0520	well now it's kind of more the share share income isn't it as well
S0519	yes that's right that's right
S0520	so you want to
S0519	i have to laugh dad set himself up do you do you remember you get all this money all of a sudden and then it disappear again
S0520	oh yeah i be woohoo
S0519	so he set himself up in a with a bank account cos i tell him if i be have four hundred a month he could have four hundred a month and erm
S0520	four hundred
S0519	i know it's hilarious erm he could have this princely sum and buy all his blink cds with it
S0520	amazon order
S0519	amazon stuff and everything and immediately he set it all up but he put all of the extra money into his as well and i say no no no no no no no no so that be what that all be that be him supposedly transfer all the extras into his account no that's not how it work
S0520	yeah he's funny funny dad
S0519	so we need this nice weather for come
S0520	i know it's quite fun cos he's like he's not from around these part
S0519	no
S0520	so it's quite fun to sort of
S0519	no it's go
S0520	i mean he's be to england a couple of time but to london
S0519	no but that's london that's not england
S0520	and watch to watch the footy and his brother and his father his father come over london but his brother and his father come to to old trafford
S0519	okay two big cities
S0520	you know that's their reason for be here
S0519	but you be say his family be quite city people
S0520	yeah they be yeah they've never be to the lake district erm yeah so it's nice that it's kind of bite quintessentially english
S0519	completely different it'd be just glorious if it be like this as well
S0520	i know but you can't hope for these things yeah but i get to show him stuff like this be england and these be the this be tea real tea
S0520	make with boil water
S0519	this be er a pint of ale simple
S0520	yeah
S0520	he always like my englishness and think it's funny yeah it's just nice to have him see things we do look in england to see if we could find a retreat place as well there's a lady who live in london who come she's retire and she's really good for do things she's a serious lady so she be look all over the place in wales epically and scotland erm but we didn't find anything suitable really
S0519	mm mm
S0520	there lot there be such place in england there's plenty of things go on in england of that nature but we just have quite specific requirements in in the size have to be quite big
S0519	yeah
S0520	it all have to be quite big and er other things and also it be expensive i mean it's more it's more affordable especially at the moment for people to pay in euros if they're come from other countries you know but yeah so then i be imagine everyone come to england it be quite funny
S0519	erm that's what my dad always say i can't understand why can't find this in england
S0519	there's all sort of wacko people be more or less
S0520	yeah
S0519	there's plenty of religions go on you know she should surely find one that she like and we have a little giggle
S0520	wackos
S0519	it's the you know it he doesn't say that but that's what he
S0520	i know no that's what he's he's think
S0519	say there's all sort you know i
S0520	yeah well that's yeah that's for sure
S0519	there's bind to be something she could have
S0520	there's something for everyone a lot of buddhist place in england
S0519	mm
S0520	it kind of make sense to people here
S0519	yes erm i think it all well i don't know when i be younger and more involve with the catholic church it be the religion that people default to from catholicism
S0520	yeah interest
S0519	erm it be you would imagine they'd go to islam erm to me
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm but no no they go to
S0520	well there be certain crossovers like there be mm some esoteric something like that school of christianity mystical
S0519	yeah
S0520	which be more kind of erm base around less base around kind of er certain type of moral system and more base around like mystical inner experience or you know look for god inside yourself i know that that concept be in religion as well but it's like erm just a different emphasis you know so there be like erm later on christian mystics in erm in germany for some reason who be become influence by eastern religion and philosophy and start to kind of er interpret certain elements of christianity more in that way and it's really interest it's like take things very metaphorically as well you know the holy spirit the the holy trinity as kind of symbolise certain things that be within yourself you know
S0519	mm
S0520	whatever that kind of i hope grandad's okay that's a really intimidate thing to happen
S0519	horrible yeah i must give him a ring today
S0520	it's good that he phone you
S0519	it be i'm really glad he do
S0520	mm
S0519	i think would have always phone she would never do anything without
S0520	yeah that's good just to know that there be such people out there you know it's horrible i like your bb cream
S0519	mm
S0520	it's nice
S0519	it be lovely it's a bite of glow
S0520	a bite of

S0520	a bite of glow yeah
S0519	when you put that other one on it didn't do anything
S0520	it be very deaden wasn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	mm
S0519	no it look lovely when you just turn round
S0520	purchase some more it's a shame the spf be so low for me
S0519	mm but you could maybe put sun cream under
S0520	sun cream under yeah
S0519	and then put it on
S0520	you can get erm moisturiser nice moisturiser with a high spf as well just i mean i don't know what the problem be with sun cream it's fine as well it's just sometimes it's a bite greasy
S0519	it's just not yeah a bite bite
S0520	and shiny but it's better than nothing in thailand they put erm whiten in everything
S0519	yeah everybody want to have pale skin
S0520	it's really weird and so all of the moisturisers that they sell be have er have whiten
S0519	it's not good for you either yeah

S0519	you shouldn't put it on you
S0520	i wouldn't i don't want to be whiter
S0519	good girl
S0520	and i certainly don't want to put bleach agents on my skin but you see some women in thailand i don't know what they do they put some kind of a mask on i think and they have like a literally like a white round white face that's like a different colour to the rest of their body
S0519	no horrible
S0520	i'm not sure what the deal be
S0519	erm oh no it
S0520	be it this one

S0519	no i i just have never test it so i didn't really know how it work
S0520	i suppose when you er special it's quite good that
S0519	erm when dad and i just pass here when dad and i go to it be really beautiful and i really like it but i couldn't imagine live there
S0520	really
S0519	and i haven't say it to him except that i i say that erm i didn't feel anything about it except negative things from be near the cotton mill and the er and also it it's like a strange weird thing but as if it's a a barrier be the other side of the m6 it's all
S0520	a barrier to what
S0519	like like i don't feel near to be on the it it's
S0520	like on other side
S0519	i don't on the other side it's just a weird thing but 's the where it always star to get busy so you you end up that you know you'd have to avoid rush hours and all of those things and and i don't know i just
S0520	no i think one hour either side of you're go to have that problem
S0519	yeah that's true
S0520	so it's not really a factor
S0519	not but i i do i like it and it be beautiful but i it just felt like a a very foreign place erm like i didn't i didn't know where i be
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm and my dad i suppose that it it kind of make me realise when we say to my dad we be look near he say er
S0520	why
S0519	why would you want near it's a horrible place
S0519	and of course it be
S0520	well yeah
S0519	but but just ten minutes outside it's absolutely beautiful but then you could say the same about a lot of place
S0520	yeah especially around here cities aren't nice be they
S0519	no but be a nice little town and er
S0520	oh good i mean maybe you would feel more at home in cos you do come from and you do live in the for all those years
S0519	yeah that's right it's it's kind of weird isn't it
S0520	so it kind of make sense i mean er yeah i mean i don't it make more sense to me that you would be this side of the of i don't know why but mostly because you have access to the lake district
S0519	but we're go to keep the house
S0520	well if you do then yeah
S0519	er so suppose what might happen if we go to we might not keep the house because there wouldn't be much point
S0520	yeah no i think you're right no that's
S0519	erm because then you could go up to the lakes so why would you why would you do a
S0520	no you wouldn't keep the house
S0519	no
S0520	unless you want to have it in the family but even then it doesn't really make sense do it
S0519	whereas south of we would just keep the house and erm
S0520	mm
S0519	it it there's a lot everything will unfold and what i think will happen be you find a house and you and that be the key factor
S0520	yeah that's what i say to dad as well that it's go to be house that probably decide it a little bite you know
S0519	yeah that's right
S0520	i can imagine you in sort of erm south area it's just a shame that it's not so pretty around there
S0519	no that's absolutely right
S0520	it's prettyish but it's just kind of plain
S0519	yeah that's right
S0520	but you would get better climate and you would get erm access to and erm
S0519	that's right
S0520	south of you know and you should be nearer to grandma as well i mean
S0519	mm
S0520	i mean
S0519	you have to kind of not
S0520	i know you don't i know
S0519	you know it it's true but it's go to be a few years hopefully many but
S0520	yeah
S0519	not you know
S0520	no i know it's not like er
S0519	you can't think of a lifetime er but be ninety seven
S0519	dad's sisters erm no that's not right not dad's sisters erm my my dad's mum's sisters so my dad's aunt live into their nineties as well
S0520	do they
S0519	incredible isn't it
S0520	you have the genes
S0519	we definitely have something go on
S0520	ninety seven crikey
S0519	and be still all there which be quite
S0520	yeah that's pretty amaze
S0519	a little bite confuse at time but not
S0520	yeah but so's grandma to be honest
S0519	yeah absolutely and and we've see that deteriorate
S0520	yeah
S0519	and i think you know everything's change in her life so that do cos the
S0520	it's destabilise yeah
S0519	the confusion yeah that's right
S0520	yeah i do notice that with grandma when we go to see her last time that she wasn't she be much more confuse and kind of foggy
S0519	yes
S0520	and after we'd be there for a while she be better
S0519	yes
S0520	i guess that she's on her own and that you kind of withdraw into your mind don't you
S0519	yes yes absolutely
S0520	so she look a bite confuse for a while and she didn't really understand really what be go on and the kid be jump on her and things but erm but the later one she kind of return to herself it's just all the emotion as well isn't it
S0519	no no that's it i've see her a little bite worse each time that we've go
S0520	yeah i think it's be alone as well
S0519	i agree yeah
S0520	be that it's just er what happen to grandad because of his hear i think he just withdraw into his own world too much and then it make you er it make you lose orientation
S0519	totally mm mm
S0520	he couldn't follow the conversation so he didn't
S0519	no no
S0520	dad seem like he's do better though
S0519	yes yes
S0520	than last time
S0519	very very much so
S0520	i be quite worry about him
S0519	mm
S0520	and last time he be still quite depress and
S0519	yes
S0520	he be very tearful about about grandad
S0519	that's right
S0520	and just not in good form you know like kind of kick off against you a lot

S0520	his skin be so bad and everything
S0519	yes
S0520	that's cool
S0519	no it's be lovely erm to just to see him kind of come out of it it's really remarkable that he's i've ask him a few time if he think about work and hardly at all
S0519	i you know for somebody so devote to his work it'll come i'm sure
S0520	yeah
S0519	he's still on holiday kind of
S0520	it's still kind of a novelty isn't it
S0519	yeah yeah
S0520	mm
S0519	but you know when he we be say about the norwegians and the that they go home at four o'clock you know that would be horrendous to him
S0520	yeah yeah
S0519	he would have he would think they be not do their job
S0520	yeah
S0519	he would be angry he would like think oh these people have no life
S0520	have a life yeah
S0519	erm
S0520	well that's good
S0519	no he he's er
S0520	i think about it the other day i be just think he never have to go to work again what's he go to do but he's you know he's good he's do a lot of music
S0519	yes

S0520	squash club
S0519	squash erm no that would be just great it's a good winter sport and they have so i be go to say they have a squash ladder so a league you join probably at the bottom but you just play each other at that level and then you move up if you're so you don't have to know anyone you know you just get to know them as you go
S0520	that's nice well that'll be perfect
S0519	and it's a club and of course it's at the rugby club you know just opposite the in
S0520	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0519	erm so either they'll have a bar in the rugby club or they'll probably all go across the road to the so it could end up be quite a nice social even cos thursday be their club night you know
S0520	well i hope he erm meet his match and he hasn't play for a while
S0519	no well he do play in
S0520	oh really
S0519	just once a week if they be both in the country be kind of how it be work out there be a couple of different people he play and they be a bite better than him so he use to be just please if he come home and he get a a a game

S0519	no he didn't even go no i quite enjoy it
S0520	you be there with the
S0519	interest

S0520	yeah it be
S0519	he want to clean the windows and clean the cars so he's obviously want to give himself job and i just want to take the car for a proper clean
S0520	dad's not go to do the serious job that you need
S0519	he go out with a bucket
S0519	to clean the car and that be about three months ago
S0519	it's only fifteen degrees still

S0519	look be all we need
S0520	bright sunshine yeah
S0519	as long as bring warm clothe
S0520	i tell him to bring warm clothe he doesn't really own very many well he do but he leave them in india he doesn't have to use them elsewhere he should be alright no he say to me he's never meet parent english parent so he's wonder what the deal be
S0520	he say spanish parent be fine cos spanish and israelis be pretty
S0519	yes probably closer
S0520	equally rude forthcoming kind of er you know they be i think there be just more similarities you know in term of culture i think he felt quite relatively at home in spain
S0519	mm
S0520	i can imagine that
S0519	yes where he doesn't even feel at home in england
S0520	yeah
S0519	it's kind of weirdness
S0520	yeah exactly it's like we be say about germany where you feel that you kind of get what's go on in reverse well he can speak very good english that's a very lucky thing for me that's a like a bite of a barrier not for the
S0519	yes
S0520	kid not for the family family cos they all speak very good english but the well first of all you know they speak hebrew to each other a lot
S0519	mm
S0520	so you miss
S0519	mm
S0520	what people be say and half the time you aren't involve in the conversation
S0519	no that's a little bite disconcert isn't it
S0520	it's fine cos i'm very use to it but erm it's just a factor you know in in er when you're when i'm in er with er when i'm with them
S0519	yeah
S0520	with his family that i don't really understand what's go on some of the time and then i just kind of switch of into my own thing you know and they're very polite like they always try to speak english
S0519	mm
S0520	if i'm there and even to each other when they're not directly address me
S0519	yes so you're still in
S0520	but you know it's your family so you just default to your own language don't you
S0519	yes if you've get something to say quickly or urgently
S0520	yeah or even if you're just chat and it become animate which it usually do in israel you have to but
S0519	i hope he get dad's humour i hope you've give him a whole load of warn
S0520	i tell him he's likely to be gently insult no he get that he's quite sarcastic himself actually he do tease me the same way grandad and dad use to
S0519	oh mr
S0520	and yeah with the kid like i can't talk to the kid at all
S0519	yes
S0520	so that's a shame cos they really want to you know
S0519	yes to chat with you
S0520	to chat and tell me things and they'll just chat to be in hebrew
S0519	mm
S0520	i have no idea what they're talk about i just go yes but the young one the big the one who's be on big brother be american originally she's the sister in law
S0519	oh right yes
S0520	so she erm speak english to her daughter
S0519	okay
S0520	sometimes as well her daughter clearly be a very clever girl and can clearly understand english actually she doesn't dare to speak it but she's only four
S0519	yeah no but that's that's quite nice yeah she she get what you're say
S0520	but you can tell that she understand what you're say she be much more shy by the end she she would come and babble at me she know all the word to the freeze songs so we be sing them together
S0519	yeah yeah oh lovely
S0520	it be cool so erm go to sleep in the afternoon do he or not always
S0519	erm not always so we'll just see erm i'll text
S0520	so we pick him up from school
S0519	yes we'll probably have to go straight there
S0520	eleven o nine what time be oh eta
S0519	twelve
S0520	twelve and what time be it
S0519	twelve
S0520	oh twelve yeah but it always go down in the end
S0519	it do just near the end and then an extra few minutes but you can't walk through the school you have to walk round and it take a good five minutes
S0520	erm be park on the other side do you know where that be
S0519	so yes i know where to go in
S0520	no but you know that you can park on the entrance way that open to the main road like this be the school
S0519	yes
S0520	and this be the house
S0519	yeah
S0520	and you can park there on the road
S0519	yes
S0520	but you can also go all the way round to the other side
S0519	that's what you have to do you're not allow through
S0520	i see
S0519	at lunch time so if you decide to walk it you've get to walk all the way round as well
S0520	oh rubbish
S0519	erm and that's why you need to be a bite earlier erm than this so i'll we'll just drive there and pick him up even though we have no seat to put him in
S0520	oh i see what you mean yeah we be thirty second and be quarter past three be it
S0519	yeah erm a funny thing i go for her last time and so they use to have class one and class two together so where you pick her up the next door class be class two so i just go to that place and i could see through the window there be all these quite grow up children and i think that's not our 's class and i then have to go run round go where's class two cos hadn't say which room to pick her up from
S0520	oops
S0519	and er
S0520	yeah she's not in the other classroom isn't she very grow up
S0519	she do didn't she
S0520	mm it's funny with her though i don't know if it's just kid thing but you ask her a question like what kind of snack do you buy at school then you know she get her thirty p and she just like completely make up the answer
S0519	make it up i know
S0520	yeah what's that about
S0519	i don't know
S0520	i'll say what do you do at school i mean sometimes she answer you know there be certain question where she just
S0519	no say we go on a coach trip
S0520	yeah
S0519	do you really erm so when it be really funny because we be erm and then she would say that's a lie
S0519	erm and you're not really suppose to tell lie you know and i be completely baffle but the erm on her birthday erm i be take her to school and be actually away in so i think it be the friday and have go to work and she say i'm allow to wear my own clothe and of course i didn't believe her so i say well i'll tell you what we'll take your dress in the bag
S0520	oh
S0519	because i'd just like to really be sure that it's okay because the teacher didn't say that i i'm not sure and i'd texted and didn't reply in time so i take it to school and when we get there the teacher say yes they be
S0520	oh no
S0519	so we go and change her in the toilet
S0520	funny
S0519	oh funny
S0520	it's quite isn't it but i mean i think it's typical with with there's a kind of there's a thing about quite direct question be a bite funny with kid they do just either they don't understand exactly i mean you can't you can't suppose that she doesn't understand the question what snack do you buy at school
S0519	no no no no
S0520	and something in her be not like connect the dot
S0519	a little bite naughty as well
S0520	do you think it's naughty
S0519	no i do yes it's just like a little story
S0520	she's like i have macaroni and this it's like no you don't have macaroni as a snack
S0520	yeah we do
S0519	no that's right
S0520	have macaroni
S0519	once you've question it
S0520	right
S0519	it's the little naughty story
S0519	it's like an an imaginary thing that then it become a lie and they don't really they really don't know quite what the lie be
S0520	not sure what the difference be
S0519	yeah why be it different to tell a story to tell a lie
S0520	oh i see yeah
S0519	do you see what i mean
S0520	yeah like if you'll ask her so what do you do what do you see when you go on safari
S0519	yeah
S0520	she might just invent a story about have see a giraffe
S0519	totally she she tell no she tell me something ridiculous erm erm you know animals a hedgehog or whatever you know nothing to do with i'm wait for her to say a giraffe come out of the bush i saw oh and owl she say
S0520	i saw an owl in safari
S0519	in safari
S0520	mm yeah
S0519	funny isn't it but i think sometimes it's the things that be also maybe a little issue like erm be tell her for quite a while that she need to buy snack she doesn't buy it so the money just stay in her bag
S0520	okay
S0519	and she she just say no she doesn't want snack and i think there be a little bite of a tussle go on so you wonder if that come into it
S0520	yeah yeah
S0519	that she's then sort of think you're part of the spy team
S0520	the conspiracy that want her to buy
S0519	with the snack snack yes i see what you mean
S0520	yes
S0519	oh just that's fine
S0520	it's an emergency
S0519	emergency heat require we be play shop so it be just and i be the shopkeeper and i be buy all of his truck go in he would like potter over to the big toy box and pull one out now you buy this police car right fine and he be quite good he be do like he be scan it with the little dooby thing
S0519	oh right yeah
S0520	and i'd be like how much do it cost and he'd go six and i'd get another thing and how much do this cost and he would go six so he wasn't quite it be all very sweet then come and it become like a full
S0519	full shop experience
S0520	full shop experience erm she erm make a pet store with all of her little cuddly toy and erm she tell me all how you need to look after them but the funny thing with her be that she tell you what to say

S0520	it's wednesday thursday so dad say er you say you be too old for the other car
S0520	and it isn't very comfortable be it
S0519	it's not very comfortable
S0520	i be notice that cos he be drive me to the station and it be quite
S0519	you get all the bump
S0520	it's very bumpy
S0519	it's quite bumpy
S0520	it's all bite race car
S0519	it's just vroom
S0520	yeah there's a lot of accelerate
S0519	i don't feel calm
S0520	i don't feel calm especially with dad drive
S0519	and dad be you know and then he decide to overtake people
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm and i don't feel quite so relax and whereas in this car everything happen smoothly and you don't have that same race boy feel
S0520	i think you've just get to let him have it
S0519	in yourself
S0520	you've get this one
S0519	so i yes exactly i don't want to sell it it's his but i i don't feel very often
S0520	that you enjoy it
S0519	the joy of go out in it
S0520	yeah i agree
S0519	it's actually quite nice to drive yourself
S0520	i be go to say exactly that maybe you should just take it out
S0519	yeah the the i don't think the passenger get the same pleasure erm and i i personally feel if you've get the hood down you need to go quite slowly cos otherwise it's too windy
S0520	yes
S0519	i'm sure this be not the idea
S0520	it's not los angeles be it
S0519	but so if i go out in it cos it's a sunny day i just tootle along quite nicely and it feel really nice
S0520	yeah that's fun
S0519	but if dad's go at sixty you feel completely buffet
S0520	yeah i know i don't
S0519	i don't
S0520	erm it encourage that type of drive as well
S0519	i think that's what it do yeah
S0520	so driver be i really want to be able to drive
S0519	i know
S0520	i feel very handicap and i just don't see when that's go to happen
S0519	you need to come back for a
S0520	for a few months
S0519	few months at some stage and you you're you're right there you know you're just right there and it
S0520	no i know i just need to de traumatise myself
S0519	absolutely and get get somebody really good
S0520	yeah
S0519	and just take your time do do it properly don't rush yourself
S0520	yeah it's rush isn't it
S0519	erm and just say you know what i can already drive i just need to refresh and get all those little detail that that guy just didn't seem to have a clue about
S0520	he didn't know any of it and he didn't teach me some of the main things either
S0519	he didn't teach you properly at all
S0520	on the way to the first test like the night before i'd be study and er realise we'd never do an an emergency stop which be a guarantee in the test
S0519	be always do
S0520	so i be like we've not do an emergency stop on the way so you just don't feel you know
S0519	oh totally not
S0520	any confidence
S0519	no shame
S0520	i don't i shouldn't really have fail so badly i just
S0519	no but it get worse
S0520	no i just lose all my confidence
S0519	yes exactly
S0520	and he kind of you know he go a bite loopy on me didn't he
S0519	yeah and that be one be a write off
S0520	that be
S0519	the second one be worse than the first and the third one be a write off
S0520	no the second one er the second one be good i think i'd pass
S0519	ah
S0520	the third one be a write off i don't know why i didn't pass the second one i be obviously not ready because the first time he say you're too hesitant
S0519	mm
S0520	erm the second time he i can't remember his reason i think i might have make a major error
S0519	you make yeah probably
S0520	the thing be though i do all the right stuff i do all the erm manoeuvre and everything all of them and get them perfect that's what most people fail on
S0519	yeah no
S0520	so i obviously have good control over the car i just felt
S0519	to be honest i think it's
S0520	uncomfortable in certain situations and i think i still would
S0519	yeah but i think that's erm
S0520	like traffic erm inner city situations

S0519	no but even if you drive all round the town and keep include the route
S0520	yeah yeah it be and i think erm you i could have just do with be drive for instance in quite a bite because the situations where i felt less comfortable be where there be lot of junctions there be round you know inside the city one way systems or whatever you know i felt like i didn't quite know how to do that
S0519	no all of that should be clear up shouldn't it
