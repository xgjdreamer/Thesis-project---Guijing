S0428	we never joke
S0432	no we're always be serious serious people
S0428	i look at the map and i think the erm i think the holiday inn be really central like really near the station you know so when we get there we can just
S0432	oh be it i've get a map actually i don't i don't know whether it's worth get a taxi or not
S0428	i think we can walk yeah
S0432	ah it's quite actually i should probably get it out because it's er we'll probably need it won't we
S0432	i'll wait until he's
S0428	yeah
S0432	i don't know why i put them at the bottom though well they're not they're like in the middle
S0428	i always do that like the stuff you need
S0432	yeah i will just be able to see my face
S0428	i need to eat when we when we get there we can like find oh because of the meet finish at five we could have er maybe a quick like like half an hour walk around it'd be nice to stretch our legs
S0432	yeah yeah definitely because we've be sit down for a long time
S0428	oh like just like a normal day
S0432	i would like i didn't know what everything each piece be so i like highlight the bits of information so like there's the station oh yeah six minute walk
S0428	yeah yeah yeah we can do that
S0432	so that's fine and it's quite a while to the quite a way to the uni
S0428	yeah i think we're go to have to get a taxi every day
S0432	yeah or the i think you can get a bus
S0428	yeah i think
S0432	yeah by bus
S0428	i think say we'll just like after three of us have pay for like pay for a bus we might as well just get a taxi
S0432	might as well get a taxi that's true actually
S0428	a limousine
S0432	definitely a limousine with champagne
S0428	that's the that's the uni
S0432	that's the uni map i print off that one and i make that one
S0428	oh okay
S0432	but that's where the bus take us if you do get out and that's where we need to be
S0428	yes i be like oh okay it's quite big
S0432	yeah it be isn't it like it's get like a proper like driveway go in well a road even like separate little road set i be like it's massive but then i think the uni of be like that whereas because it be like a city campus and it be like all all over whereas that's all like one
S0428	wow yeah all dot around yeah uni be a campus
S0432	yeah
S0428	but there be it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't that big really
S0432	no i don't remember there be like roads when i go to it
S0432	like my erm friend go to uni of to do spanish and english i think and she leave after about three weeks because one because spanish wasn't actually like learn spanish it be more like english light but for spanish if that make sense
S0428	no really
S0432	yeah so they be just like study play and stuff and that's not really what she want to do erm and also because cos it be a campus and she be live on campus she couldn't like she never leave like the whole three weeks you can and like and like other people have say like you can just get so like lose because there's like a supermarket there there's like everything you need on campus you don't actually need to leave
S0428	yeah lose yeah be a bite like that it's quite weird
S0432	yeah i be like i never actually know of that one because i want to go to uni of i just didn't get in and in and in the end i be actually quite glad that i didn't well only from like what people have say obviously a lot of people love it it be it be an amaze campus
S0428	yeah i've never be to the uni there
S0432	it be really nice
S0428	mm
S0432	erm
S0428	i don't i don't think you really put much think into the course when you're choose that i didn't realise like i didn't look at the course and compare them and think oh i'd much prefer to do this than that
S0432	no i didn't
S0428	but i think when i go round to look i go when i go round look at them some of them felt more old fashion and kind of look really look i be like oh i'm not sure that's really for me
S0432	yeah it's just i've they say like when you're when you look round them you just get a feel as soon as you're there like this be the one but then don't that's like the atmosphere rather than the course and you do have to think about the course as well because that's obviously go to make such a difference
S0428	yeah yeah i really want to go to uni by the sea
S0432	oh do you
S0428	so i apply to like all the unis on the coast like erm i apply to like which be quite close but then i end up at
S0432	yeah a few people go to that i know and they always post photos like even in the winter like we're just on the beach
S0428	yeah
S0432	they have like coat and scarves and stuff but it just it's it be it be nice i only have like four choices though to do spanish and chinese
S0428	i bet there weren't many at all
S0432	there be five but one of them be at and i didn't want to go there and then there be like and then so i didn't really have much choice and then i because i'm like i know anyway so might as well i've get family there and stuff i know i kind of like ignore and so i just decide between those two but like i don't i remember sit in like my friend's live room with like thousands of like prospectuses like just look through them all not know where to go and what i want to do what be like what you need to like prioritise
S0428	you want to go yeah yeah what no i have not get a clue
S0432	no
S0428	and everyone be like it's your decision like yeah but
S0432	yeah i don't know how to make that decision and we be in the end we be like let's all just put them in the middle one of us pick one and we all just do that and we'll just go there and do the same course because we have no idea well a lot of my friends erm most of them didn't go and then i think there's like six of us seven six or seven of us that do go and only three of us actually continue with it most of them like drop out in like the first term
S0428	yeah yeah really drop out oh just didn't like it
S0432	and i be like maybe i should drop out just because everyone else have their course you be like it's so weird
S0428	i want to do a gap year erm but it i i be the last year that get in on the cheap fee and if i do a gap year i'd have to have pay so so i be kind of the whole time i be like oh it's fine i'm go to go away then after a year i'll like think about it and then it be like oh no i'm go to pay more so quickly put in an application
S0432	oh be you yeah i think about a gap year but then i just have i want to do it with one of my friends but she want to go to uni and i didn't really have much money to be honest like i think i think about it too late i didn't i couldn't save i didn't want to work i just want to travel so it wouldn't have work
S0428	mm yeah yeah yeah that's my other like i have no money and i be like i'm go to have to work in england for six months and then travel for six months or like actually i just i don't want to do that
S0432	yeah no i mean i could've carry on work in the hospital because that be quite good money
S0428	yeah
S0432	so i'd probably i probably could've do my six month work six months travel but in the end i just don't think i would've get back into like study after that
S0428	no
S0432	i'd be like oh let's just keep travel
S0428	it be really hard when you like stop study and start again
S0432	yeah
S0428	i really yeah
S0432	and even in the year study
S0428	yeah
S0432	so you aren't completely like out of habit do you think you will do any more study after your master
S0428	no i don't think so i think i'm do now erm just write this dissertation yeah like my supervisor be like you know if you ever do a phd i be like woah there like stop it i don't think so
S0432	you don't need to continue that sentence
S0428	yeah that's not gonna happen
S0432	no i think my dad be like because his sister my auntie she's basically be study her whole life i swear she's do like load of different things but now she's like a lecturer at liverpool university so and he's do quite a lot of study and but so he think that i should carry on study no i think i'm do now i might consider do a master so like if it's go to like benefit me in my work or whatever
S0428	yeah yeah i've really i've really enjoy the master but i'm not sure i don't think i could do it again like i i have all these like i want to do all these plan and i'm like no i've get to stick and finish this and i'm really excite to finish it
S0432	mm yeah yeah it will be like such a weight off your shoulder when you
S0428	yeah
S0432	i remember finish uni and just like wow i feel like i can do whatever i want to do now
S0428	yeah
S0432	but it wasn't such a relief hand in my dissertation though i think that would be because it's such a like big part but i be still worry that i'd do it all wrong
S0428	yeah same
S0432	but like just finish uni and then wait and then i think it be more hear what result you have get rather than finish uni
S0428	yeah that be
S0432	it be in that time it be still worry if you'd actually do well enough because load of obviously load of thoughts go round your head don't they like what if i completely fail and have to do like another year
S0428	yeah yeah i think i remember have dream of like fail pass do really well do really badly
S0432	yeah i can't i because erm obviously you get your result by the post or or and online
S0428	oh we we'd get them on a board
S0432	oh do you
S0428	yeah they be like up so everyone could see them
S0432	oh no
S0428	it be really weird yeah
S0432	that's horrible i wouldn't have like that
S0428	we all have to like go up to the uni and yeah it be really weird because i think that's like quite traditional i think
S0432	yeah we have that in first year where just for linguistics your like student number be on there
S0428	yeah
S0432	next to your like grade you get from particular exams we but we just have it online but erm so i be wait for that then just get like a random phone call one day and it be like the head of department and i be like hello this be random because i know it be a number on my phone and then they be like we're just call to let you know that you get a first and i be like what and then because they ring everybody personally that get a first like before the result come out and i be like oh and like no one be at home then so i be just like jump around in my bedroom on my own like yay i've get no one to tell yet and like i think he could tell that i just want to like squeal in excitement because he be like you can go ahead and scream
S0428	oh yeah oh that's so nice that's so excite yeah i really want to try and get erm a distinction in this master but i don't really do any work for it so in this dissertation
S0432	i'm sure you er you have do well so far though haven't you
S0428	yeah i've get distinction so far so it's just just i need a distinction you know that little thing i think i'd be really really happy
S0432	yeah i'm sure you'll do well because because you kind of you're in the job as well
S0428	yeah
S0432	so i think you might even if you don't think it have like make a difference to it i think it have like
S0428	yeah i'm a little bite worry though because i've choose to work and i be go to be like this be just like really obvious by the way
S0432	no i'm sure you'll be fine
S0428	yeah
S0432	like if you want us to proofread it or
S0428	thank you
S0432	i get my auntie and uncle to read through my dissertation i be like i'm really sorry this be go to be really bore for you but they actually pick up on like good like obviously not like a sense of stuff but just like typos and stuff
S0428	yeah other stuff yeah my aunt actually on the phone last night she's like have you start i be like no she be like i'm go to help you with it
S0432	ah that's nice
S0428	because she's just lose her job like she kind of she kind of know it be happen because she's she work at erm which be like like a uni place and she teach like international students english but they just in the business department they just have no students so they want to down she's like a she's like a lecturer and they she doesn't have an ma so they want to downgrade her but they it's really bad they should never have like give her the job if they think she because she she's clearly she's clearly absolutely she's be there for like ten years so they want to make her
S0432	oh no mm yeah oh no if they be go to down that's horrible yeah and they would have get rid of her before then if she wasn't do a very good job
S0428	yeah exactly so they they want to make her like support staff so obviously her pay would massively decrease but she also she teach at which be the another uni so hopefully they'll she'll get some more hours there so she's like i have load of free time to help
S0432	yeah help just write it for me
S0428	yeah i think you need to do the whole lot
S0432	and have a proofread
S0428	yeah good at that but she's so good at that kind of thing she spend her life like teach like academic english and that kind of thing
S0432	yeah i get because my auntie erm lecture in like oh what be it molecular biology like those type of lecture and stuff and she be like i'll read through yours but mine be because mine be more like a literature base one rather than a first experiment one which if that make sense i don't know what they're technically call but she kind of change she only like read my introduction and she change bits and then i show like both to my lecturer i didn't obviously say who'd do it but i be like which one do you prefer and she prefer the one that i'd do so she be like this one's kind of go off a little bite and not like really get to the point of what you're try to say so
S0428	yeah she be like
S0432	yeah i felt really bad like not give the rest of my dissertation to my auntie but i didn't want her have to go through and waste all her time like if i wasn't go to use it i mean that's great she help with like cvs and stuff and other bits because she obviously she help students and stuff like she help my i mean because my older sister do a psychology equivalent degree so she help her with hers
S0428	yeah yeah that's really good like so maybe more
S0432	yeah and my sister do dance but she do like a she have to do like her own like own like data or whatever you call it like she have to find out her own result from her hypothesis and stuff so she be able her able to help her

S0428	yeah ah yeah yeah well maybe she yeah
S0432	and i don't know if she need to do anything more than just
S0428	like qualification or apply i guess she's work in the right kind of sector to go into it
S0432	mm yeah yeah yeah because er like someone at i think she work from like sixteen and up as well so like some of them be teenagers obviously but that's more like house market like rehabilitate but she want to do and that's us all
S0428	yeah there's so many
S0432	that's all of us
S0428	it must be so nice be part of a big family
S0432	yeah it's weird like now i've move out like the home be really quiet
S0428	yeah so how how many of your sisters live at home
S0432	er three and my older sister's move out end of december so only two yeah but that's quite a and like obviously where we've move out my house be quiet i'm not use to be like it be that quiet like use to well walk in and it'll be like chaos
S0432	and like my boyfriend say i've get a really loud voice but i'm like i can't help it i think i've just like get use to talk over everyone because you literally have to shout to be hear
S0428	so there'll be two leave yeah i love chaos not the chaos but i love a like a buzz in the house
S0432	yeah yeah that's nice
S0428	yeah we we don't like why like my immediate family be quite small there's i've just get my brother but then we've always get family around so it's just mental
S0432	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's good though
S0428	yeah
S0432	like you seem to go up north quite a lot as well to see them
S0428	yeah yeah i think i think just have i don't know i didn't realise until quite late on in life that actually like spend time with family isn't a give it's and like you obviously your they're like blood relatives and you care about them but when you you just actively love them at time it's like the best thing really
S0432	yeah mm yeah yeah yeah i know there's so many of us as well like you forget to like arrange to meet them and like because when you're younger obviously your parent arrange
S0428	yeah yeah so you see them anyway
S0432	so you're like ah i'm go to continue see you this often but you don't because it's actually us that have to arrange it and like sort it out but
S0428	yeah yeah no my cousin's we put a date in the diary and we're like right we're do this
S0432	yeah that's good i think we should start do that
S0428	yeah cos then you you know that you always do it like organise and things it's like mamma mia
S0432	mm yeah yeah yeah that's good ah that's so good but there's so many of us it would be hard it's hard to get us all together anyway but even just like a few of us at a time but most of them be in so they a lot of them see each other anyway
S0428	yeah do both your be your mum's family and your dad's family in or be it
S0432	yeah mostly apart from one of my mum's brother brother's be in new zealand and then my dad's sister be in in and like two of my mum's sisters live like two doors down from each other there's like one house in between
S0428	oh really oh that's so funny that person must be like
S0432	yeah and then one of them be just round the corner from them as well so they just see each other well they don't see each other as much as they should see as they live that close to each other
S0432	i be like i'd be round all the time if i live that close to them
S0428	yeah my two aunts like one of them they both live in which be an area of and maybe it take fifteen minutes to walk between the two
S0432	okay to walk
S0428	yeah
S0432	oh that's yeah that be
