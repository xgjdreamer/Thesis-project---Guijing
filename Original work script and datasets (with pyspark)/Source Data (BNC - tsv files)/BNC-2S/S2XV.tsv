S0131	that be his that's take off b and q be now sell them
S0018	fantastic
S0131	and have be work alongside him in it so 's actually be work two or three days a week on that and only a couple of days work on his own business but that's all sort of work now so he's now back work more on his own business for the next couple of months so ah he's get various things he's get some guy's come to them with this amaze sound erm what be it it's a speaker system that be sort of that thick you can put it in the back of picture and all sort and it will both give out sound and record they want finance so anybody that want sort of finance as a computer company he deal with but it's various things
S0018	ah so be he invest in
S0131	yeah
S0018	be he look for things to invest in
S0131	yeah
S0018	because i've get a friend who's look for an investor well eh she make this amaze natural products like moisturisers facial wash she teach at the college actually beauty therapy
S0131	okay
S0018	and everything she do be without erm preservatives so it have a very short shelf like compare to something you'd pick up in tesco's tesco's have actually invite her down to london
S0131	really
S0018	and lay on the the welcome and they want to buy her range off her and erm sell it in tesco's but they would have want to add lot of preservatives to it which be completely against her philosophy
S0131	that's somewhat of yeah rather negate the reason of do it doesn't it
S0018	exactly
S0131	well actually be work with the peter jones academy at erm the college and he's get a guy from there who's get some product it's a sort of a board a number board for dyslexic people who be dyslexic and he's dyslexic himself and he and it's it's it's a way of put number together so that it's magnetic and they will on fit together if you've get some right basically
S0018	oh wow
S0131	and he he put this he's one of the peter jones academy students and go along as a potential investor who be ask if he would go along basically to sort of assess the kid on their what on what they be do and how they put forward their product and what they need to do and actually 's quite keen to support this guy
S0018	brilliant
S0131	so i'm surprise it's somebody at the college that's push her into look at that because they've get various people
S0018	really well i'll get her to look into that
S0131	yeah have a look at peter jones academy
S0018	i think she's only just start teach there give erm talk and demonstrations of her products
S0131	oh okay
S0018	but eh she's already have a business erm she set up herself as a beauty therapist on high street and now she want to get into the niche market of sell her products at train to spas and hotels so that's cos she's have a baby in the interim she's a single mother which doesn't help
S0131	well that's hard work
S0018	but she's just get yeah a few talk and stuff teach at the tech
S0131	i just don't think i've get 's number
S0018	well i'll tell her to to ask what be it the
S0131	peter jones academy
S0018	peter jones academy
S0131	just tell her cos they've get it's base this academy at the college and it's peter be it peter jones it be peter jones who be the erm dragon's den guy
S0018	uh huh
S0131	he's he's sort of be involve with set it up so that's why it's get his name
S0018	oh right oh well i'll tell her that yeah because she's rip her hair out all she need be five thousand pound to set up cos she's go live online next week and she get order and interest but she hasn't get the money to buy the produce to make up the order and so she's
S0131	i'll mention it to
S0018	yeah
S0131	well if i give you i think you if you have her number i sort of think give me her number and i'll tell him to give her a call or i'll give you 's home number
S0018	okay oh super brilliant yeah even just if she could have a chat with him and see ask him if he know other source of investment because she's be to the bank and they say no we're not give any bank loan out to small businesses at the moment erm she go to the prince's trust who say no because
S0131	oh that's interest cos 's involve with the prince's trust
S0018	oh really but their reason be that it wasn't a new business she be she have already kind of start it up previously so
S0131	right that's a bite harsh
S0018	i think she actually start it up with a loan from them
S0131	oh
S0018	but eh yeah no so she be at a bite of a a
S0131	my grill's not on be it in the scheme of things five grand be nothing
S0018	in business yeah
S0131	erm yeah i've get i'll give 's mobile number
S0018	fantastic
S0131	cos he'd always have a chat with her cos eve if he can't do anything
S0018	yeah
S0131	he may well have erm ideas about where would be a good place to to look
S0018	super yeah her produce her products be great they're so lovely mm she do this body polish erm that isn't cos most exfoliators be like shower gel base aren't they
S0131	oh okay
S0018	and this one that she's get be slight jelly oil base that be a moisturiser so the eh the peach kernel
S0131	oh i like peach kernel
S0018	it exfoliate just fall off leave the oil that make it
S0131	oh wow in your skin
S0018	lubricate it into your skin and she make these candle that be make out of eco wax but once you've burn them you can rub that into your skin as well
S0131	oh blimey
S0018	eco wax with essential oil
S0131	where do you get where do you get the recipes for all this
S0018	she make them she's
S0131	how do you get into that in the first place
S0018	she she didn't she be always a bite of a tearaway at college erm at school and decide to do beauty therapy instead of go to sixth form and from that she erm start up as a beautician erm but she's get awful allergies so she touch for example metal metal cutlery and her hand will flare up and she get eczema and so she be find that as a beautician she couldn't use the products that a lot of beauty parlours
S0131	there must be a lot of people out there that can't we've get a niece who be now a year old no she's a year and a half and she be just it be just a nightmare she seem to be permanently grisly and sort of didn't want to eat and her skin she keep come out in rashes and she's now they do she's allergic to dairy wheat egg gluten soya and various things like tomatoes oranges it's just it's just mammoth
S0018	blimey
S0131	and the problem one of the worst problems be that the doctor's give them some when they discover that she's get some allergies they give them some bath oil to try and settle her skin down and it transpire this have get soya in it and she's allergic to soya so actually be make it ten time worse poor kid when when she go to bed she be just they couldn't understand why the bath wasn't make her more comfortable well it wouldn't cos it be actually irritate it even more so hopefully she will outgrow some of it certainly but poor little mite and they say would i make a birthday cake for her i do manage to make a birthday cake i mean it it didn't taste much like cake and she didn't but she wouldn't touch it and you can understand why she wouldn't touch it because she doesn't she hat food because it make her feel ill
S0018	shame
S0131	it's just she's so fussy but you can understand why
S0018	be have they manage to get it under control now
S0131	erm yeah i mean be amaze she's a teacher she work three days a week and she spend the two days a week she's not work prepare food and put it in the freezer that's stuff that can eat and her mum look after her the two days that she's the three days that she's work it's so time consume i don't know how she do it she's still breastfeed her she she she's a year and a half and she won't take any of the milk substitute because they taste horrible so i don't know how long you can go on so she's express milk to leave with mum but actually they've have to start give her vitamins and things cos the milk she's really she's just live on milk and eighteen months be not enough

S0018	no mm it's not a very precise science be it
S0131	a friend of mine have get depression at the moment and they've say it's a chemically it her particular depression be chemical imbalance she's have problems ever since she have the children and she's be on anti depressants for years on and off and it's absolutely knock her sideways and she have one day that's really good and the next day she can't get out of bed
S0018	oh dear
S0131	and it take a while to get the medication right so it's and they say you know it's it's a it's a medical condition it's not oh well you know it it it's sort of people have this thing about mental illness and well you should be able to get over it but actually you can't and certainly most mental illness be actually a it's a physical condition
S0018	yeah it's all about imbalance of as you say things in your brain
S0131	yeah so it's really tough so yeah 's boyfriend be come to live with her in staffordshire
S0018	ah ha oh 's not go to live here and commute to
S0131	no well initially she'll come back here but then erm they want to look to rent somewhere in staffordshire and he's finish his law erm train erm in june as well so he's go to be look in in the midlands and manchester so hopefully he'll get something but train placements be just so hard to come by
S0018	really
S0131	there's just nothing out there
S0018	oh dear
S0131	so he's tell her he's learn how to cook and he's learn how to clean
S0018	he can be a house hubbie
S0131	so he can look after her have he get a womb as well maybe they can start have a family
S0018	have a family
S0131	he can take off
S0018	yeah
S0131	no they'll want to get marry i think but mind you they haven't spend they've be together for five years but of that time there's three of those years one year he be in taiwan and then the last two years she's be in leeds and he's be in london so they haven't have a huge amount of time together but he's brilliant he's such a star he just a he's a hunt shoot fish type but he's not he's not sort of pompous or arrogant in any way he's just that's just what he's always do that's what his family have do they've get a massive pile down in hampshire with a river run through it and fish right on it i mean it's they've get not a penny to rub together but they've get this sort of inherit pile which be crumble round their ears they can't actually afford say she'd hate it because you can't afford to actually do it up in any way so erm but he's just a sort of rather different background he be at private school all his life and but he's actually but and he be a seriously nice guy
S0018	aw
S0131	he's such easy company
S0018	the the two boyfriend's actually resemble each other a little do you not think
S0131	no not at all
S0018	no i think maybe they they look quite similar
S0131	they probably they be quite different they get on well they do get on well but erm and get on well with them so
S0018	brilliant
S0131	no we're lucky he's single footloose and fancy free at the moment and thoroughly enjoy it
S0018	probably won't be for long
S0131	no he's decide he's he's have three long term relationships and he's decide that's it he doesn't want to rush into anything
S0018	how old be he
S0131	twenty two
S0018	oh yeah
S0131	he's only young but he's get so much on he's he's play hockey at alton at alton west warwick's this year cos he's back here and they ask him if he would go and coach and play for them as he be back over here
S0018	oh super
S0131	and he's absolutely love it he's get some good mat there so cos he be worry about live at home this year he want to stay in nottingham david say well i'm not pay for accommodation if you're not you know i don't see why i should pay for accommodation if you're not earn anything and you know you need to come home and live at home but actually it's turn out really well
S0018	so have he take a year out of be study
S0131	no it's a sandwich course
S0018	okay
S0131	so normally you'd have an internship with a big company
S0018	mm hm
S0131	but because have get his own business which the university have fund well they'd give him two thousand pound to help set him up he go to them and say look i've get this business and i'd like to work in it for the year off rather than so an internship in another company as part of the course and they say yes he could do so i mean he's he's get his own business but the reason he's work with be that erm that also give it a bite more credence because work with and 's business partner eh actually supervise so it's not his dad sort of tell him what to do but he report to erm he's do a good job by all account they give him a bonus last month so he be
S0018	ooh fantastic
S0131	say i think you've work hard and no that's good
S0018	excellent so what what's he in charge of do like be he market and sell
S0131	oh everything everything i mean his own business he's do everything he's just get erm just erm juniors they do train camp all over the country and they want mouth guard with their own logo on them it be his idea he sort of approach them and they say oh yes please so that could be massive
S0018	wow
S0131	what else have he get he just erm which be another design a a clothe sport clothe company want to use him for their mouth guard so he's he's get he's get school he's get king edward school's girls and boys have say yes they want him to supply not which be the normal supplier so he's get some big contract so he's do everything in his own business and actually pretty much he do the same with and he do i mean all the yeah market sales he he's be go round the store check on stock he's be make he's even make off to show what these loft stilts do and he's do trade fair he he he get the figure each month and he go through the figure yeah they have they have a bite of problem because the figure didn't tally with what be in the stall it transpire that the stall have sell out and the figure say there's still some in the store but there aren't any so he go out and be walk the shop floor and talk to the managers and things and ask them to move if they'd get sort of what he think be a poor location get them to move it and so yeah he sell a massive amount he enjoy it
S0018	super leave more than
S0131	oh well i mean he'd have be make the coffee and do the photocopy wouldn't he
S0018	yeah yeah
S0131	yeah there's no comparison i don't think so
S0018	what college be it
S0131	he's at nottingham trent
S0018	oh university
S0131	yeah no he love it and he's actually get a first in a lot of things say to him do you think you could come out with a first overall and he say well it be a possibility but he's he hasn't get firsts in everything so make his final year fairly tough but he's pretty keen to do it i think he'll probably come out with a two one but he know that he can't afford to come out with anything less so
S0018	that's the problem nowadays isn't it so competitive out there i mean in a way i kind of i'm think positively and think at least i'm try to get into the job market with experience behind me and eh a two one degree because kid come out of uni nowadays
S0131	we've get a nephew who's be try for erm since last july his wife's get a job she's american girl she's get a job with an em insurance company in london and he's get a thing about go into insurance cos they want they get marry in september and they want to go back to the state to atlanta where her family be but and there's big insurance business there erm so the sort of think be if they both get job in insurance over here they've then get some experience
S0018	mm but
S0131	insurance he's go to it bore the pant of him she's do she's get in and she's do alright but he have just have he's apply for hundreds and hundreds but he's only get a two two
S0018	mm
S0131	so he's always go to be the sort of dodgy candidate two two and no experience
S0018	oh what a shame
S0131	and he have he's do it he be actually manage to get some voluntary work with her company at the moment it's not ideal i i don't think it's what he should be in anyway so but he's quite pushy
S0018	ah yeah well i'm have this dilemma about cos if you say if you say it pay well you say it will bore him to death but at the end of the day it's about survival isn't it and this be my whole dilemma about the teach thing i really do not want to go into teach after what i've see
S0131	mm i don't miss it
S0018	i have have i i keep meet teachers who have just retire who've say wouldn't go into teach if i be you don't do it if i if i have to start my career at this particular moment in time i wouldn't touch it with a barge pole and erm
S0131	that's interest cos i wouldn't say that but i don't i i'm happy to be do other things and i've i i'm work four days a week pretty much for the college now and it's great because i'm teach people that want to learn to say
S0018	yeah
S0131	but i do enjoy the teach
S0018	but that's but that's what i come from my experience as a teacher have always be mostly teach people who be there because they want to be there or even if they're kid and they don't want to be there the group be small enough and there be the target aren't so stringent that i can use my effervescent teacher personality to kind of motivate them
S0131	well maybe maybe fe be the sort of better place for you to be
S0018	yeah maybe
S0131	cos i i didn't i didn't anticipate enjoy the work from the college the only problem be it's well i'm i'm lucky i don't need a sort of permanent contract and i roll over from one term the next and i don't know what i'm go to be do next term and well i generally i've get a pretty good idea but they have to get the number to justify the course i'm do erm and actually it just it just seem that i tend to get more work rather than less erm i have get two even a week which be quite we go ski a couple of weeks ago and on thursday night i'm teach till half past nine so we didn't leave till ten o'clock to go down to dover but you know there you go and at the moment i'm at college with the sort of the only day i don't work be friday and i'm at i do college all day for myself for that i'm actually can that this summer cos i just want the day when i'm not work at all
S0018	what what be you do on fridays then you're do college
S0131	i do sugar craft i do the sugar flower work
S0018	as a student or
S0131	as a student
S0018	oh okay
S0131	and they and i've also be in cake decorate not not really i don't really need it i do it initially because i'd never do any course and then the college say well they would pay my fee because the lady i'm work with be the only other cake decorate teacher in the college and it mean that it's professional really erm but she drive me a bite bite mad with the cake really she's she's terribly old it's terribly old fashion and and i and you know as a teacher when i start off at the begin of the term and i say to my students okay this be what i've get plan but be it's not appropriate to your need we can change it so whatever happen i want this to be appropriate to to you and erm she have this sort of thing that well no we'll do this and we'll do that and then when they don't bring the the resources in she she say well i'm not bring them in cos you know they've get to be independent and i'm think well if they don't want to do it if it's not they won't bring the stuff in i haven't have any of that i do have two class mondays and tuesdays where i provide all the ingredients but that's because they're special need so and i mean actually they they keep come and they enjoy come but even then i have particularly with them actually you have to make sure it's appropriate
S0018	yeah
S0131	whether it's appropriate to their skills or whatever and she just she say well when i do my qualifications and she's basically do the old i think it's call seven two seven two o or something it as call it be an it's a qualification that enable you to teach adults that be very basic
S0018	right mm hm
S0131	and when you've do what you it's a bite different morning johnny
S0018	hiya
S0018	hi how be you
S0131	yeah he'll be please with that cos i kick him out cos he be be a bite of a pain
S0018	get a wet muzzle and
S0131	yeah
S0018	imprint everywhere
S0131	so yeah
S0018	you be run
S0131	you shouldn't be
S0131	ah yes he'll probably be alright now if you're in here
S0018	hello big dog
S0131	oh no oh you haven't get cat where you be
S0018	yeah i've get a cat
S0131	you have cat oh that's maybe he can
S0018	maybe that's what he can smell maybe he just find my leg extremely
S0131	there's a shortbread you can try one if you want to check if they're alright
S0131	that one yeah try it i wasn't sure whether they be cook enough but i have a nasty habit of over cook them
S0018	be this he want me to tickle his tummy
S0131	yeah you're gonna have to be careful because he want you to tickly his tummy but then eventually he start think that you're a hump post
S0018	oh right okey doke
S0131	it's alright to start with he's alright at the moment but he's a he's just a he's just he do it when you've get your legs cross it's really odd
S0018	well it's just there at maybe at the right angle for him
S0131	right right yeah oh no go away that's a pain no no he's be feed
S0018	well as long as you enjoy the teach stuff that you're do
S0131	yeah i do i must admit it's a lot of preparation
S0018	yes always true
S0131	but erm even for what i'm do i need staff preparation cos it's make cake and make biscuits and i don't know but even actually things like put together list of equipment they need and perhaps suppliers and then you think well actually don't you know how much you need for a six inch cake if you ask them to bring in bring a six inch cake it have they get do they know what the recipe for a six inch cake look like so it be surprise that but no it's be fun i've learn a lot actually i must admit it's good
S0018	cool
S0131	it's very different to teach kid
S0018	and your mum say that you're teach
S0131	no
S0018	you're coach
S0131	oh no you
S0018	well kind of like teach isn't it
S0018	sport teach
S0131	actually you you you're good at it with the hockey aren't you well he do it he do it for a year a school didn't you when you leave school do it for a year
S0131	you be be a pain stop it
S0131	well he's be out and he be whine at us ooh what be that
S0018	what be that
S0131	no ah go away
S0018	yeah well so i'm at the moment look for job in like the publish world tefl publish
S0131	oh okay
S0018	yeah i've i've just hear that i haven't get an interview for he first on i go for but it be me i be expect it the guy in human resources say apply for all the job that come up whether you've get the require requirements or not which i think be a bite silly cos if they've get require requirements it's hardly a requirement if you don't have
S0131	no
S0018	erm and it be more of a sales and market type roles try to promote their primary course book and materials to to school erm so they they they say a requirement be sales and market experience which i have but very on a basic level erm do the advertise for the college that i use to teach at in barcelona
S0131	oh okay
S0018	but i didn't get an interview because i imagine that they've get sales and market professionals who go for that job but there's another one that's come up with them same company
S0131	right
S0018	that be eh manage their online placement test so which sound quite
S0131	be that base in
S0018	no in oxford
S0131	that'll be nice
S0018	yeah so finger cross i'm go to do my application for that this week and
S0131	that's different isn't it
S0018	yes
S0131	and you've get a lot of tefl experience haven't you
S0018	yeah well most of the requirements i actually have so
S0131	make a lot of sense
S0018	be good what it be about my leg
S0131	i don't know
S0018	the angle it must be
S0131	i can see that i think if you go into teach and you're sort of straight in university where you've sort of your that much you've get a bite more and a a bite more resilience almost
S0018	you're more malleable
S0131	and i think you're also a bite naïve
S0018	yeah
S0131	so you sort of whereas you've see a bite of the real world and you know what it can be like and you know it doesn't have to be like what you're say here
S0018	yeah i think i think that be one of the problems cos there's four of us that have drop out well with defer the pgce till next year
S0131	really that's a lot
S0018	and eh three of us be not straight out of uni
S0131	mature students as it be
S0018	and the other guy be french so we're wonder whether it be that that you know you don't it's not that you're not flexible cos i be as you know i'm very flexible in the work place erm it's more that as you say it's like why be they do it like this i mean it just doesn't work and if you're use to have high standards and make sure that you're very well prepare and make sure that what you're teach be the materials be reliable and attractive and will get them talk and that will motivate them i mean if you can't use materials like that because you have to make every single thing yourself
S0131	that's ridiculous
S0018	i mean
S0131	that's ridiculous
S0018	it just be ridiculous it's just not the right way to go about do it at all
S0131	you're reinvent the wheel all the time aren't you
S0018	exactly
S0131	it's completely pointless the best be to take the best of what's on offer and adapt it if you need to
S0018	exactly exactly which be what i've always do as an elt teacher i guess there's a a wealth of publish resources for english language teach cos it's such a big market
S0131	yeah there be for anything there be for anything i remember we have we have a problem cos when we move school we have all this wonderful computer system computer system and erm they provide us with some package which have get some on they be erm whiteboard eh sort of you resources you could use with the whiteboard and they say this be just wonderful all these other school in the birmingham area be use them and there's these lesson plan on here and there's all the resources be already make for you and i don't know who be hoodwink into get it for us cos if they'd ask us to have a look at it any one of us to have a look at it we'd have say well actually they be completely useless cos they be totally and utterly useless for our kid there be nothing that be appropriate because all the sort of stuff that be level read age five to six we need to use with perhaps sixteen fifteen sixteen year olds well the material wasn't appropriate the actual content
S0018	right
S0131	even if they could read it the content be totally inappropriate so that be completely useless but there be stuff out there if you it it take a bite of find but because there be other school in the position same position as we be there be other stuff out there actually which be appropriate and which do make life a lot easier
S0018	well what what i find for example with the white with the smartboards be that teachers have just latch on to them say oh aren't there smartboards wonderful let's use them but let's use them all the time
S0131	all the time
S0018	the kid get so use to them
S0131	yes they do
S0018	and the teachers like oh use smart board as if this be so you know cut edge and we'll motivate the kid
S0131	but ofsted have push that though cos we we have we be ofsted'ed just before we move school and they come in and they'd get a big push on use ict fine lesson i be interview in i be in a hut i have no computer in there that actually work even there wasn't even a computer that work and there be no white board so i think well okay the only way i can get any sort of ict and maybe i'll use an overhead projector so i use an overhead projector that be a close as i could get to anything
S0131	and my when i have my lesson review afterwards this woman say it's just i would have like to have see more use of ict and i say well tell me where i be go to find it because you know i didn't there be nothing in there that i could use
S0018	what do you want me to do buy a computer
S0131	what do you want me to do yeah i you know their their their if we don't have facilities how be we suppose to use them
S0018	well that's a stupid thing to say if you don't have the facilities
S0131	well it's just
S0018	it's like say i would like to have see that class teach in africa it's like well yeah but we're not africa
S0131	yeah it's exactly what it we're not there if it have be i think i get a it be like it be outstanding and then there be very good or whatever she say if you'd use more ict it would have be outstanding well you know it be either an outstanding lesson or it wasn't base on what i'd go there you know so but then we move school and we have all this equipment put in and as you say people just use it for the sake of use it and they weren't think there be some wonderful stuff you could do with it
S0018	yeah yeah i agree
S0131	we buy some erm overhead projector things which link to the whiteboard so that you could demonstrate stuff and the kid could see it up there and you could photograph it and then you could do things with it but nobody ever do the more complex photograph it and use that and they just put it up there so the kid didn't have a to sit round what they be sit round the table and well actually that's not actually you're not gain anything out of that
S0018	well the whole thing of you can arrange things on on the document the program that come with the smartboard
S0131	mm hm
S0018	so that the kid can actually come up to the back eh to the smartboard and with their finger like move it around as if it be a touchscreen which be great
S0131	yeah
S0018	for some things but i just saw it use all the time and it wasn't even erm attractive it be because you have to enter each sentence in as a different entity
S0131	yeah
S0018	and then format that the teacher's just didn't have time to do anything else with it so they'd just use exactly the same format every time which be just basically word sentence write on the board in french and then sentence write on the board in english
S0131	and match them up
S0018	and the kid one at a time have to come up
S0131	and that's
S0018	which be another problem
S0131	that be a problem
S0018	like everyone else switch off but they think because it be a smartboard it be fantastic and it i be like kid the kid be not look at this as cut edge oh wow i'm motivate i'm engage because it's a smartboard they're think i've have death by powerpoint now i'm have death by smartboard
S0131	yeah absolutely
S0018	and you know i i be give them lot of little conversation card and
S0131	that they've actually get here and they can
S0018	yeah
S0131	yeah
S0018	but they don't know how to behave
S0131	no they don't
S0018	in a one on one situation because all of their eh life in french class or spanish class or whatever have even sit star at the board watch as one person go up and match the sentence on the board together and they're not use to actually have to use it oh it's just horrendous
S0131	i have to teach spanish to we they decide in their wisdom that we should teach foreign languages to these kid that can't speak english and certainly can't read or write so we have a lady who do be she speak quite good spanish she's not a spanish teacher but she speak quite good spanish cos her parent be and but not only do she have to teach it all the other class teachers have to teach it they have no spanish knowledge whatsoever i be one step ahead cos i'd get other languages my only problem be i end up tell them stuff which i subsequently realise be italian so there you go they want to
S0018	that be a modern foreign language isn't it don't have to specify which one
S0131	and they do quite enjoy it in a funny sort of way they weren't learn a lot but use the she use a lot of the smartboard a lot and actually i discover that the class i have be just so unruly and i go back to old fashion art work and we make a spanish town out of cardboard and we paint it so we learn the colour and we people it and we work out what all the shop be and we talk about things happen in this thing
S0018	oh fantastic
S0131	which be a very traditional way of teach
S0018	work
S0131	actually i have them onside because the be occupy and they be they be part of it
S0018	how old be they
S0131	these guy be year seven
S0018	right yeah
S0131	so first year seniors yeah bear in mind they'd get mental age of i mean they're model skills weren't weren't brilliant i have to say cos they be not terribly good it be year seven eight i do the sevens and the eights but that be of far more benefit to them than game on the whiteboard
S0018	well i i prepare an activity to learn the colour in spanish whereby erm they have a presentation of noah's ark but all the different animals be different colour
S0131	oh magic
S0018	i'd make it look silly different colour and then what they have to do they each have a little eh print out in black and white and they have to colour their animals different colour and then do like an information gap activity what colour be your eh elephant my elephant be pink what colour be your elephant my elephant be pink too whoo we get one the same and every time they have one the same a bite like battleships
S0131	yeah
S0018	but she say no no no no you can't get your children colour in a french lesson i be like oh for god's sakes what do you want me to do just get them to stare at the smartboard all
S0131	but that's not
S0131	she's completely miss the point of education which be actually you utilise kid all learn differently so actually physically do something whatever it might be if it's colour so be it it will be a skill that will actually make something stick with some kid
S0018	but what i think she miss the point of be that the colour be not the end
S0131	no
S0018	product it be a vehicle to get to the actually speak the language
S0131	to get them to there absolutely
S0018	which you know would have work would have work fantastically erm if i could have manage classroom manage the pair work it would have work fantastically because that's the kind of thing that they
S0131	that's right
S0018	they do get into
S0131	yes
S0018	silly animals oh look that that pig be blue ha ha ha
S0131	yeah absolutely
S0018	but no i be tell not to not to bring oh that's the that's the thing that annoy me about the train as well be all the different people tell you to do things or don't do different things and it's it's completely arbitrary most of the time it's
S0131	that's just silly isn't it and when you get out there you do your own thing anyway
S0018	yeah true
S0131	unfortunately that's the difference and i don't think i don't think people in university who be teach be necessarily up with what's go on in school anyway i mean i that be a problem i have that i find that the tutor who be teach us actually hadn't be in school for so long
S0018	right
S0131	that they weren't necessarily teach us what be appropriate
S0018	erm you see i think if if they get course book and class book not just book but whole multi media suite of the class book students book the activity book the communicative activity book the smartboard presentations for when you're present vocabulary for example and little match activities when they're first learn the vocabulary video if they get it all together as a syllabus
S0131	yeah
S0018	like there exist for english language teach and i'm sure that must exist it it must exist in modern foreign language teach in school
S0131	yeah it do or most most secondary school use
S0018	but then
S0131	use textbooks
S0018	yeah but they're the most driest of the dry textbooks
S0131	but they and they have they will have a well certainly most secondary school that i've work with and they have a they have a syllabus they whether it's their own that they've write or it's somebody else's that they've bastardise they've get a plan and you will be teach this this week and that and actually that's cos david work when he be at ninestyles that be exactly what they have there they have it for everything include foreign language teach
S0018	from what they be teach from the textbook all the time
S0131	pretty much yeah and if they weren't they be teach from a set of resources that they have make themselves
S0018	right
S0131	as a as a erm department so it be very prescriptive more so at secondary than at primary primary there's a lot more leeway for do your own thing yeah
S0018	well i wouldn't mind do mostly someone else's thing because i don't think teachers have the time to plan as well as teach and mark ad assess and everything but only if it's good quality stuff
S0131	that's right
S0018	because i think one of the reason that they have stop use course book be that they be so dry and they be so bore but i think it give the kid also a focus that they should be colourful that they should be somewhat you know well design so that it attract the eye that they be clear that they have you know the vocabulary write down because these kid that weren't work from the textbook they never do any listen activities which be awful because before you can start use a language you need a lot of
S0131	yeah
S0018	practice listen to it erm they didn't have a course book so they have no write record or what they'd do they have these tatty exercise book that they would graffiti all over and rip page out of
S0131	do they
S0018	write you know change their handwrite every other page and flick ink of the page
S0131	this be secondary kid
S0018	yeah yeah
S0131	yeah
S0018	but you know if even if they come to well that's if they come to the lesson with a pen because it wasn't cool to have a pencil case so you'd start the first fifteen you'd waste the first fifteen minutes of a class sort out miss can i have a pen eh haven't you get your pen no i haven't no i haven't where be it oh i didn't bring it today oh have you get can you borrow it from someone else cos i'm not go to give you a pen every time you ask for it and
S0131	it's crazy
S0018	but they've just be you know they're spoon feed because all the teachers now just give them pen cos they know
S0131	cos it mean they can get on
S0018	it that they can get on with it but that just engender more less students take responsibility for their own learn and oh it be just crazy and so they've get no record of what they're do they've get no independence and no momentum to learn and it be just their behaviour be appal
S0131	really
S0018	the violence the level of violence be appal
S0131	where be this be it
S0018	in yeah and
S0131	i go into school recently by a mistake i be actually look for the primary healthcare trust build over there but it transpire my satnav take me there but i should've be over the road well it be a zoo
S0018	really
S0131	i i stand outside the front door say well i better ask cos it maybe cos i think the place i be go to teach might have be within the school school ground and school complex cos quite a lot of school have that have community outreach centre in them
S0018	mm hm
S0131	so i stand outside the door and there's a women in an abaya in the let me help you desk in the corner who just sit there look at me she just didn't bother and then there's a guy talk to the woman behind the who be actually the sort of office administrator lady here and he be talk to her and he just keep look at me now what do i have to do to get into this place
S0018	la la la la la
S0131	and they know they all know i be there and eventually the headmaster walk pass the door and saw my stand out there and open the door for me
S0018	the headmaster
S0131	the headmaster as he be go to his office
S0018	well at least the lead
S0131	at least he
S0018	by example
S0131	yeah nobody nothing be say to anybody and then rather than sort of say ooh it be she this woman have be chat and it be just chat to this guy for quite some time they be all asian i have to say and but it probably could have happen if they'd be white anyway but and eh instead of sort of say yeah hang on she she just just make me stand there and they be just talk about anything and everything no question of i be think i'm go to be late for this thing wherever it happen to be and then the bell go
S0131	it be like it be like something out of the lion king it be just there be just kid everywhere and it be complete anarchy
S0018	yeah yeah
S0131	and there's sign say walk on the right walk on the leave do this do that it be an absolute bun fight
S0018	well i go to a train session
S0131	i just think let me out of here
S0018	entitle how we can reclaim the corridors
S0131	what's well say be a just a nightmare when he be there he hat it
S0018	oh he be at be he oh
S0131	yeah he do that well and be affiliate and he be send fairly quickly out to and that be where he have a chap in the corridor take the scruff of the neck and he's this guy's go you can't do that to me and he say just watch and he come home and he say i don't think i can do this anymore cos i'm go to be in prison if i carry on so
S0018	well this be my this be my
S0131	and he hand his notice in the follow day
S0018	yeah this be my take on it it's just
S0131	it be just
S0018	it's an unrealistic situation and people like who would be very very very good teachers if you have a class of kid who be use to be teach and who know how you know the the behaviour for learn that they know how that work and they understand that they've get a responsibility to put their part in i mean would be a fantastic teacher
S0131	yeah i think teacher's give up i think you get in the situation like say that they have he he could understand where the problems be come from they be come from home eh the boys be treat like sort of princes at home get away with anything and the parent would come at parent even and say we can't do anything with him at home
S0018	right
S0131	so so what so can't you can't do anything in the school we can't do anything at home
S0018	yeah
S0131	and the girls saw school as a way out of home so they actually want to be there but then they be sort of prey on by the boys and it be just he say it be just an absolute nightmare and a lot of it be that but also there be a lot of the sunni pakistanis cos this be very un pc but his mate his business partner's pakistani and he say there be a lot of pakistanis lower down the food chain basically who apparently they come over here from erm i think he say the borderlands when erm they flood the eh land to make reservoirs for hydroelectric power and they displace thousands and thousands of basically peasant farmers and they have to because of the i don't know what what the politics be but they have to offer them basically asylum here there be no other option so they come over here and actually they have no history of education they have no history of work actually other than subsistence live and they've be pluck out of there and plonk into central
S0018	gosh how long ago be this
S0131	we're talk thirty years ago
S0018	right so they're now we're educate their children
S0131	so we're now second and third generation but they're not they don't they see no reason to to educate that's why we've now get the the certainly within that particular community they're not actually educate themselves out of it they're just there they don't see any any need for it and the youngsters don't see any need cos their parent didn't have it so
S0018	yeah
S0131	it's a bite like and the third fourth generation unemployed over there and my dad hasn't get a job and my mum hasn't get a job but we've get a house and why do i need to world
S0018	yeah and they've be teach that benefit be a career move and have a kid will get you a council house
S0131	get you a flat yeah
S0018	it's a tough situation
S0131	we have a sixteen year old girl she be barely sixteen actually and there be all sort of problems at home and and in the end she be in with her grandmother for several years in the end the grandmother say i can't cope with her she's get special need grandmother say can't cope with her so what do the council do they provide her with a flat just just sixteen she's go to be so and you think who in their infinite wisdom think that's appropriate how be that safeguard this child i mean she be a nightmare but there have to be a better way than that so she be actually alright in school because she know where the boundaries be but we have lot of kid come from mainstream where they have just completely fall by the wayside they're disruptive they can't they they they they just they don't find learn easy they can't learn so basically they've spend all of their time out if the classroom cos that's the easiest thing to do with them so they've never be in a learn environment and they come to us they come to us and it be like ooh blimey somebody be actually ask me to do something erm
S0018	you can kind of understand it can't you you can you can see the root of it the root cause of it but
S0131	he's be an absolute pain
S0018	ah it's cos he want my leg
S0131	he doesn't do it normally normally he'd have settle down by now
S0018	yeah the last few time i've be here he's always be really chill and oh maybe it's the spring time
S0131	we've walk him he's have about a five mile walk this morning then i play golf nine hole it's only nine hole
S0018	ooh
S0131	and then he need another walk this even so he's definitely go to need it cos he's otherwise he'll be drive us mad
S0018	you have to walk him for five miles well not have to
S0131	we tend to walk him for about an hour and a half in the morning if will unless we're at work in which case we do it the other way round and then we'll take him out for sort of forty five minutes and a hour in the even
S0018	that's nice though cos it get you out
S0131	it do well we've give up our gym memberships it's the first time in thirty years it's just and it's just nice to be outside
S0018	yeah especially when the weather's like this
S0131	well i be get all sort of repetitive strain injuries in my shoulder and things from swim and it be just overuse and so and actually i haven't get any of that it's be brilliant
S0018	ah ha
S0131	cos i walk eight miles i'm not a thin as i be but there you go
S0018	i don't notice a difference you still look very slim and glamorous
S0131	yeah yeah i'm alright i don't know about glamorous
S0131	in my ski sock and walk trousers
S0018	yeah you always have a way of look glamorous with your earrings and your have you paint your nail
S0131	no
S0018	oh you normally have your nail paint
S0131	no they're all shorten they'd be full of biscuit mix though
S0018	so yeah well i think yeah this be one of that reason that i'm just not into teach i want to get another career just cos i don't want to work with kid
S0131	no i can understand that
S0018	mm not just from those background just because i don't have that passion for children that i think you need to to
S0131	yeah you do
S0018	push you a long in that career
S0131	i know that say there's his academy in tamworth
S0018	be this 's ex
S0131	's ex i mean some of they have the one afternoon they have the police in to break up the fight and then
S0018	i have an to remove
S0131	and then they have an ambulance man in to because somebody get hit and so badly hurt they have to take them off it be like well no
S0018	yeah i have a policeman come into my class to remove a girl that be kick off but refuse to leave and then she be kick off against the headmistress so they get the police in to to remove her and then another guy who get cart off from one of my lessons in an ambulance because he'd do a runner on my class and the teacher in charge tell me to just go and find him and run away from me he jump over a wall fell flat on his arm break his arm i be like nur nu nur nu nur
S0131	that be just let me stamp on the other arm while you're down it's just shock
S0018	it be it be and as you say it come from home
S0131	it do come from home
S0018	lack of but also the lack of erm because there's so many target and senior management have get so many target that they have to achieve
S0131	it mean that it's not appropriate what you're teach be not appropriate to those kid and actually a lot of the kid need life skills they don't have life skills
S0018	these guy for example they're all fantastic about shout their mouth off and tell everybody what they're do and what they like and what they don't like but they they can't listen
S0131	listen to save their live
S0018	how can you learn a foreign language without have listen skills even in your own language and these kid be all bring up on a diet of shout and reality tv oh look at me look at me look at me and they don't know how to listen and
S0131	and actually reality things like the jeremy kyle show they they would aspire to be on that be sort of have their private live put under the spotlight cos they've get on to television you know actually it's irresponsible broadcast actually erm and i be in the i'd take a school trip away we'd have this girl with us and i'd i'd say i want to take her cos i think she need to get away from home actually it be a bite of a nightmare and mum be just i let the have their mobile phone in the coach on the way down but i say you know if there's any misuse any problem they we will i will collect them in and you will have them for an hour or so each day so that you can phone home let them know you're alright that would be it oh and this woman this girl's mum spend every five minutes she be call her the mum be actually the one that be sort of be the problem and in the end we have various problems with phone so i take them all in at the end of the day and say right okay that's it you will be able to phone home tomorrow afternoon at this time well this mother it transpire the girl do phone her but i think maybe she couldn't get hold of her so she obviously didn't leave a message or anything cos they've never get any credit on their phone so it's sort of that home they don't have home they don't have landlines because they don't pay the bill so the landlines disappear so anyway i say to the parent categorically before we leave that his i would do this if there's problems i'd also say we will call you if there be any problems so if you don't hear anything you know they're fine well i get back at the end of the few days it be a week actually
S0018	oh oh
S0131	and this woman be in the car park absolute gun blaze and the first thing i know she didn't shout at me she shout across the car park at this poor kid she be holler across the car park david have just get out of the car to come and meet me he be like what's go on and you could see why this kid think it be alright to shout at other people cos she always do shout she always raise she couldn't talk in normal voice cos this woman be just bawl at her
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0131	and i go over and i say you know i think you've you need you need to hear her side of the story you're you i know i'm right and i say no you need to let her you need to listen to what she's try to tell you cos the kid be try to say look mum you know i be alright and i do try and call but she wouldn't listen her mother be totally incapable of listen eventually we we sort it and settle down but she's never go on a school trip again this be precisely why this poor kid need to go away if you're bring up with that that's the norm
S0018	yeah yeah and you have to shout to be hear except no one's listen anyway
S0131	no it be it's really and then the riot in the summer i mean i could have put i could have name name i'm sure of the kid that i've teach who would have think that be a good idea to go and join in because and then there's some parent interview there be one woman she be a teacher admittedly at a college not at a school and she say well how be i suppose to know where my sixteen year old son be at night excuse me i know where my twenty two year old son be he's at home and then there's another woman who's get several kid she say well there's nothing else for them to do well if you've get children it's your it's not somebody else's responsibility to find things for them to do
S0018	no
S0131	you've have them it's your responsibility to make to sort of
S0018	totally
S0131	and they don't see it as their responsibility to actually perhaps read with the children or do things with the children even if it's take them to the park and oversee a game of football well somebody else should be do that not me so
S0018	be these the children maybe that have so the parent could get the council house or single parent benefit
S0131	probably you get very cynical don't you
S0018	it be such a shame
S0131	it be a shame
S0018	but it's everything i mean it's not just erm as you say reality tv and what they're feed with on television it's you know there's there be so many laws of what you have to do what you have to wear what trainer you have to wear what it's all prescribe for them so they don't have to develop their own moral compass
S0131	no no that's right
S0018	so they have no you know that this muscle that be develop over a thousand years of evolution about what decisions shall i make in the interest of society or in the interest of morality they don't
S0131	no there's only one person that
S0018	they never have to do that
S0131	it's what suit me
S0018	it's all prescribe yeah exactly
S0131	yeah no they don't and when they do get in a situation where they have to do something that they don't want to do then they just see it as something to fight against
S0018	yeah yeah
S0131	so yeah school uniform nightmare fight a lose battle i think but it's part of the whole problem
S0018	yeah
S0131	no it's it's a really a difficult one i'm so it's a shame that you have that i don't think you there be place where you wouldn't have have such a bad experience but there be a lot of place where you do get that
S0018	yeah mm yeah i wonder whether it would have be the same have i get a very nice all girls grammar school or something
S0131	you get different problems
S0018	exactly
S0131	you get different issue
S0018	exactly
S0131	you get pushy parent you get yeah you get different issue
S0018	i guess work with adults in a business environment you get problems there too don't you
S0131	you get politics don't you
S0018	yeah
S0131	yeah it's interest
S0018	but i think at the moment i'd like to spend this year at least try to find
S0131	try something different so you're not go to back i suppose you can't go back can you or can you go back out to spain to do anything else there's nothing in spain work wise be there
S0018	well it's not really worth it because
S0131	if you don't do the teach then
S0018	no the job track there
S0131	the job market out there be shock
S0018	yeah and even when you do get a job you don't get a proper contract you don't get you know any security in a way that you get over here i mean i be look at erm
S0131	despite despite the unionisation cos i know my brother in law say they're have a real problem with they're actually now shut office out there but it's take them years
S0018	really
S0131	to get to the point where they could actually shit it because the employment laws be so favourable to the staff
S0018	really
S0131	that despite the fact they've be in a rubbish job for so many years lose money hand over fist they couldn't actually shut the place down
S0018	well this be what the government change about six months ago that it before if you want to sack an employee you have to give them a particular amount of erm do you say
S0131	eh yes indemnification
S0018	indemnification which be base on they have to you have to pay them one month's salary for each year that they'd work
S0131	right
S0018	so they'd make it a lot easier for people to sack their employees recently
S0131	that must have be why they want to shut the office them
S0018	which yeah maybe
S0131	he say it be just prohibitively expensive to do so before
S0018	yeah yeah it would have be
S0131	be cheaper to actually keep them work
S0018	yeah
S0131	at at a loss
S0018	mm hm
S0131	isn't it
S0018	yeah i can see it come from both side but i don't know it's just for example i be look at a job job on the oxford university press website and they have a job advertise in on their spanish website which actually turn out to be a separate company from oxford university press and if you look at any of the job that be on oups british website you've get all the requirements all the job description all what what you would imagine yourself to be do all the different responsibilities the salary bracket
S0131	right
S0018	the any information please contact this person eh please full in your online application with a cover letter and a cv it's all there for you and it's all transparent
S0131	it's all there
S0018	okay you look at a job that be go on the oup espanya website and it be three line prod elt product specialist require no no job description no description of what the kind of person they're look for al the key requirements or even the salary bracket erm apply with cv so no application process no and that's typical over there
S0131	right
S0018	that you don't you know you never find out about
S0131	right literally it's the last minute and actually they'll get you for what they can rather than pay the go rate
S0018	yeah exactly
S0131	or whatever
S0018	yeah it's like a market over there in a different way
S0131	it's go down the tube big time isn't it
S0018	mm
S0131	be it go to be the next greece
S0018	who know
S0131	bite worry isn't it
S0018	yes
S0131	you're probably better off over here in in many respect i suppose from that point of view
S0018	well i think so in look for job wise i'm better off over here but i just finger finger cross that i find something that erm
S0131	so how do you get the what you're do at the moment how do you get hold of that
S0018	oh just eh look online cos i always check out eh the big publish company that have el eh english language teach job available erm and this be this be up i think back in january
S0131	right
S0018	and so just luck really that i'd see it and cos it's a freelance do as much as you want when you want
S0018	it's be perfect
S0131	yeah get you back on your feet again
S0018	yeah it's nice to have a little project as well cos there's quite a lot of paperwork involve and
S0131	be there
S0018	so yeah but it's nice
S0131	yeah but it's an experience isn't it which be quite useful for what you
S0018	yeah definitely and also it
S0131	job applications it's different to experience what you've do before so
S0018	yeah but it's also erm aside from that just have a little project for me to work on in my own time and i've get nobody tell me what to do or how to do it which be stifle i don't mind have managers and stuff but have the mentor at university say do things this way and have the tutor say no don't do it like that do it like this and then there's no rhyme or reason involve i be just like ah so now it's like oh yeah just do it however you like but we need this do and we need that do and we need that do
S0131	you can cope with that can't you i mean that's that's fair enough
S0018	yeah
S0131	you're an adult and
S0018	yeah
S0131	yeah you should be able to be trust but
S0018	but i do find that they they do infantilise teachers
S0131	i think though a lot of teacher i think particularly people who come out of university erm and and become teachers never actually be never anything other than a grow up school kid and they become sort of
S0018	do you know what i could see that in the staff room
S0131	oh
S0018	the cattiness
S0131	yeah they never grow up they never grow up it's a nightmare it use to drive me mad manage them sometimes well she's get this and i should have it
S0018	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0131	you know
S0018	well i don't know what i'm i'm use to work with teens and teachers who don't actually have to work together but do because they realise that team work be actually very beneficial for everybody
S0131	no they're david have a problem with that he say he felt that they be incredibly juvenile so actually that's probably the way you have to you have to treat them i suppose but yeah erm
S0018	i couldn't believe that i you know i expect in i have to say in the modern foreign languages department every single teacher without exception be lovely
S0131	oh that's good
S0018	so supportive so human very understand erm but i be in the the staff room of the faculty of humanities and education ah communication english modern language music drama and it be it be like be in a playground people not talk to each other that day like
S0131	oh yeah
S0018	completely unprofessional comment be sling across the staffroom i be like i can't believe that adults
S0131	that's that be that be standard and you be suppose to be
S0018	be talk to each other in this way
S0131	yeah set an example to the kid but actually go
S0018	yeah
S0131	i have that particularly over here it wasn't as apparent when i be abroad at all i don't remember see it over there but particularly over here
S0018	but that's the thing i never have that in the tefl teach the you know okay there be the few random people who didn't want to work as a team but everyone be always so much more professional
S0131	they have this thing that a lot of people have this thing that somebody owe me a live and and the teachers actually this this be about erm the pension be change i go in to school and someone say i've get to work until i'm sixty whatever and claim my pension it's appal and i be think well but actually if you be in business you'd probably have to work a damn site longer and you wouldn't be yes we all say you work very hard during term time yes we all do but let's face it you get bloody long holiday actually and i know i've be there and i've work in business and i've work in school and it's not it's not a bad deal actually erm but yeah the do have this real sort of i don't know there be a problem with them just they never grow up they're permanently school kid themselves it be a problem we have people who i'm talk to her and ah
S0018	petty
S0131	oh it's ridiculous
S0018	stupid but even from erm head of department and head of faculties as well it be
S0131	well 's girlfriend be one of those she have you you can see it because she's none she hasn't know anything else other than really yes she go to university but sort of education in one form or another where you're tell what to do she hasn't know any other way of do anything so erm she she she will she'll be one of those she already plan will she'll be one of those she'll manipulate she's manipulative so she's likely to side with people that try and work things at
S0018	she'll probably fit right in
S0131	she will
S0018	but do you find in general that in business people be more professional
S0131	oh you can't afford to be like that because if you start do that sort of thing your job's on the line
S0018	right
S0131	we it be very very difficult to get rid of poor teachers and ah the hoop we have to jump through be a nightmare and so everybody felt really pretty safe there be so they could say well i can do what i like to some extent because we have one woman who be on maternity and the young girl they get in to cover her be do a good job but she do struggle because this woman who be on maternity hadn't leave half the resources that she should have leave behind and half the file and the information and so i be have to chase her up try to get hold of it and it's you know she's put some absolutely awful comment on facebook about this young teacher
S0131	really really
S0018	it's worse than the students
S0131	on facebook and it be just before i be about to leave and i hear about it and i say i say to the head she this be appal you can't you cannot have her back from she will expect to come back from her maternity leave and just slot in as if nothing else have happen what be you go to do about it oh i'll have to have a we'll have to have a chat with her if you and and nothing actually happen i think there be maybe a chat but nothing ever happen if you be in business that would be reason for you to be discipline to the point where you could lose your job so
S0018	crikey
S0131	yeah well se this girl be just completely traumatise it be horrible the stiff she put on there it be out in the public domain nobody have any right to do that about anybody else but she think she could get away with it and she do
S0018	do this other the replacement teacher find out about it be she
S0131	oh she know all about it
S0018	really
S0131	yeah the only good thing that the head do subsequently be to find her a job at the school next door cos he make sure that once the maternity cover be up this young girl do have a teach job somewhere else it be the least she could so really really she should have be able to keep that job the other woman shouldn't have be allow back but she's back she's still stir the whatsit
S0018	oh dear make you sick doesn't it
S0131	its stagger absolutely stagger i use to have a woman she use to come into me on a daily basis moan about i do so much work here nobody nobody realise how much work i do if i be work at the school next door i'd get this much money for do this little work go and work at the school next door the you know don't keep lay it in my door this be i can't do anything to change that actually if you want to and i say to them well if you think life be so much better somewhere else go and try it and somebody say you didn't say that to her i say well what else and i suppose to say i know because i've work in different place i know actually that we be on quite a good number where we be yeah there be things that use to drive me mad but you know if you've be around and do other things then you know
S0018	yeah definitely but do you find you actually have your holiday your holiday time for you because a lot of teacher i've be speak to work through
S0131	no i always use to carry on and work through summer holiday i get i always work for at least a week at the begin of summer holiday and a week at the end of summer holiday
S0018	mm hm
S0131	but that still leave me with four weeks actually and at you know christmas time i'd always have the time over christmas off albeit i would you don't you only get a week or so off yeah i mean i'd be work on stuff and you'd spend a couple of days before term prepare and certainly over easter i'd probably do a week out of the two i'd be work but you'd get six weeks holiday a year which be easily which be you'd easily get that which be a good holiday for somebody in business
S0018	yeah yeah
S0131	so i do work weekend i do work in the even yeah i mean it be it be hard work
S0018	mm
S0131	but the kid be go by three o'clock in the afternoon four o'clock in the afternoon so i can understand why people find teachers difficult i don't people don't understand don't appreciate how difficult it be in the classroom how stressful it be and there isn't enough down to alleviate that and there be a problem when you can't exclude kid who be make life an absolute nightmare and it doesn't matter what you do you can't seem to get rid of them erm it be a problem and people don't appreciate how hard that it
S0018	do you think it's just a problem for this area of or do you think it's country wide
S0131	i should think it's countrywide in the cities
S0018	yeah
S0131	erm it's definitely easier work there be easier place that work where you be work in
S0018	have you work in non city place
S0131	erm i be out at henley and arden when i do my first placement i've only actual teach job no i've always be cos i when i come back from abroad well i work at and that there there be there be nothing like the sort of pressure in term of behavioural need but we have a head who be a nightmare so he be the one that be put the pressure on we have lot of pushy parent so yeah i mean i would say that be pretty they be an okay i work hard there be a lot of preparation i have thirty three in the class so it be a a big class and i have everything from kid through to kid who get level sixes in their sats so you've get the absolute gamut with no teacher's in there erm but then i always say when i come that when i come back i should where they need good teachers be the place where it's difficult to teach
S0018	yeah
S0131	and the problem be that place like maybe place like the school you be in don't attract good teachers because it's such a difficult environment to work it
S0018	mm
S0131	so you've get a no win situation really we actually end up with a very good staff over in the school i be in we we do get some good people in and that snowball and we progressively get more good people but we have some real doors initially and that we have kid climb on the roof jump out of tree well sit in tree and they couldn't get down
S0018	but i saw that that type of behaviour i think jade the staff to such an extent that even the good teacher's just end up not be good because for example the guy that i be i be attach to his form group he be a head of department lovely guy really really really nice really helpful you could tell he care about the kid but they'd come you know they'd be body slam each other into the room and he i think so that they cos obviously these be kid that come from break families and such a high rate of parental suicide and drug abuse i think he want to give them some kind of person that they could turn to so he didn't want to be that disciplinarian person but it be just they run amok and i think he could of or he didn't make the effort to be consistent and he say oh i really should be get them to walk in in a more orderly fashion i'll have to do it i will do it or
S0018	that's not go to
S0131	you're go to change you've lose it you're gotta do it from day one and keep it go haven't you
S0018	exactly exactly but they just have him round their little finger
S0131	it and it's it's get to come it's actually something which have get to sort of systematically come from the top down you can't do it on your own at the bottom erm
S0018	well that's another thing senior management wouldn't wouldn't support the staff
S0131	i can't bear it any longer
S0018	straight to the leg right i'll uncross my legs
S0131	come here come here
S0018	see what happen when i uncross my legs
S0131	yeah i know we do love you we just don't want you be a pain alright okay
S0018	who's a beautiful doggy
S0131	cor dear you've wear yourself out i should think
S0018	aw
S0131	ah it's a shame if you if you felt that traumatise by it though and stress by it your as well off try to get something else i'd say
S0018	mm i don't think it be just the course be so intense i think it be see what the job actually be really like and i mean i'll i'll finish the course if i don't find another job in the in interim but if i finish the course i'll be look for other job afterwards i think
S0131	yeah
S0018	i can't deal with that amount of hysteria and disorder and hostility
S0131	it's no it shouldn't be necessary should it it really shouldn't you do feel i always end up though i must admit feel sorry for the kid though because the you can the reason they're like that there be reason why they're like that
S0018	yeah
S0131	but you can't always take that into account
S0018	he's get be paw on my leg
S0131	tembo
