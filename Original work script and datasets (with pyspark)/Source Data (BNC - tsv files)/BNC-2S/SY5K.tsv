S0282	okay be that record now or be it do something
S0651	i wonder if i can do rp now and get rid of my accent
S0282	yes that would fox everybody
S0282	okay so right erm there be there be kind of two things really to out today i suppose which be number one these consultation meet
S0651	be you gonna do that thing first do you have to do that first
S0282	what thing what
S0651	the tap thing
S0282	no
S0651	oh
S0282	well no we just tape it
S0651	oh right
S0282	we just tape yeah just tape the conversation
S0651	oh okay don't oh right so this be the the business plan for this right okay go on go do
S0282	yes
S0651	i'm alright i can do it i can work that one out yeah
S0282	yeah
S0651	yeah
S0282	and then erm no cos er you just have an ordinary conversation that's what they want
S0651	yeah yeah that's fine
S0282	ordinary conversation erm so erm the sessions in january but also the bite that's trouble me as well be this thing about the location of the new hospice
S0651	yeah
S0282	and er you say something about a rationale for choose a particular area
S0651	i do so we'll talk about that
S0282	and then erm but then i say in my interview that we should do we could kind of talk to the other local health providers and
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	health commissioners to see erm so that it get position in a in a place where
S0651	yeah
S0282	it kind of fit in logically with the other service that be available there
S0651	yeah
S0282	so i want i need to understand from you what your think be about location cos you suggest a specific place
S0651	i do i think erm talk about the business plan then
S0282	mm
S0651	i think we'll always say for the cottage hospice business case
S0282	mm mm
S0651	because not enough people in the organisation understand the business plan despite try to consult on it endlessly
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and and the document itself the second time we've have a business plan three year business plan
S0282	mm mm
S0651	not enough staff know the business plan well enough really the managers be get better at it but to see what you know the the direction of travel for the next three years which really i think be for the next five in the business plan
S0282	mm
S0651	so if we say business case when we're talk about the cottage hospices
S0282	mm mm
S0651	i think that drop into there
S0282	oh right
S0651	yeah so
S0282	okay so
S0651	to avoid them talk about the business plan for the cottage hospices cos they'll get mix up
S0282	okay
S0651	business plan that right so in respect of the business case which be what we'd say in that thing about the business case for cottage hospices
S0282	mm mm
S0651	erm in fact my fixation on language cos i write a few time didn't i a full and fully cost kind of business case
S0282	yes that be scary
S0651	er it be quite so erm the business case yes and one of the big issue will be location without a doubt
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and also test it the first one cos the intention be to open one
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and see how it go and run it for a while
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and learn the lessons from it before we try to go for a second one but i think there will be a second one
S0282	okay
S0651	er but we won't know that until we've have the first one for a while and there may be a third one but we won't know about that until we've have the second one for a while
S0282	okay
S0651	so the business case erm a big part of it will be location i don't think there's any doubt about that and my
S0282	mm mm
S0651	rationale in suggest that it should be
S0282	mm
S0651	i think i say but i really mean
S0282	mm mm
S0651	because i've think since i get here that the change in the nhs and the statutory set up of the nhs erm put the patients' carers and family that live in the part of the patch that we cover it leave them vulnerable
S0282	mm mm
S0651	to a shift which mean that gps and others might not want to refer to hospice in
S0282	oh i see right
S0651	but eighty percent of our patients' carers and families come from sorry i should've
S0282	no that's fine
S0651	eighty percent of our patients' carers and families come from and twenty percent from and and so and that and the fund have always be the same way here traditionally
S0282	oh right
S0651	eighty percent of the statutory fund come for and actually as it happen when i first get here people we didn't know what percentage be but the more the more you cut it nearly always find out it's twenty percent of the patients twenty percent of the carers and families for for counsel twenty percent of the fund from the community about work out too because i worry that
S0282	right gosh
S0651	we be kind of cross subsidise if you see what i mean
S0282	yeah
S0651	we be raise our money in and spend it in but we get everything seem to work to twenty percent
S0282	yeah that's quite interest
S0651	and so erm i worry that the map you know map in my humble opinion be just line draw on a piece of paper
S0282	yeah
S0651	they're arbitrary
S0282	yeah
S0651	erm but people still see us cos we're base in and people see the organisation as be about and despite
S0282	yeah
S0651	the fact that the vast majority of people we see we see in their home they can see us around this build
S0282	yeah
S0651	and so that's why i've think since i get here that we should do something and put a bricks and mortar facility in because the truth of those map be that you know better than i all of this where people live be just where people live it's really about work er home to work rout home to shop home to facilities home to service and people in and surround area see themselves attach to and attach to kind of this part of
S0282	cos they come here
S0651	because they come here cos they go shop to
S0282	yeah and there's an easy road
S0651	erm
S0282	or an easy route
S0651	exactly and and also then the if you start fine grain that
S0282	yeah
S0651	and you start get into so this this be er an older erm erm map about and we're not on it if you see what i mean this be
S0282	no i've be look for you mm
S0651	yeah where where where where my little pencil we can we can find these again but if you see my little pencil mark be where we cover in the bite
S0282	yeah
S0651	and this just happen to be the commission group within nhs be a complicate area in the sense that as as you know county council be kind of easy and cover all of have two county councils
S0282	mm
S0651	west and east
S0282	yeah
S0651	and so i'm only interest i personally be only interest in in east and the introduction of the clinical commission group
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and the loss of a strategic health authority and therefore a strategic picture and the government push to localism whatever that mean mean that particularly and these clinical commission group within
S0282	mm
S0651	i i i i i know i go off at tangents actually that one of the things about the
S0282	mm
S0651	about the rout that where people live and where they see themselves belong to you know the committee development stuff that you know this village or this community end at that river or that scout hut if you're the other side of the scout hut then you're not part of blah you and so this part of hasn't get a big secondary healthcare acute trust hospital and so that's another reason that people from and and further down to come to cos there's this massive pfi hospital which be
S0282	right
S0651	use to be
S0282	mm
S0651	the and in the centre of that's be bulldoze and they're build house but the pfi hospital be so they see themselves belong to this as part of the health economy too
S0282	oh i see
S0651	and i just er and because there's no acute big hospital for the ccgs
S0282	mm
S0651	then some of their political small piece strategy be to run their health economy by limit the amount of people that be refer to an acute trust cos they've get three hospice hospitals sorry three cottage hospitals and the gps would like not to send people to hospital
S0282	right
S0651	because it cost them a lot of money so they're try to run their health economy base on the three cottage hospitals which which will have flaw and problems for the people that live there and so i want to make sure that we as the hospice have some presence there cos i
S0282	mm
S0651	worry that one that of the unintended consequences of all of these shift would mean that people that live there that traditionally have always come to this hospice to visit people or support us with money and feel they belong to and will be tell by their gp they can't be refer here so that's my logic
S0282	mm
S0651	about why in the main i think we should try the first cottage hospice in
S0282	yes and
S0651	it's interest that i can't really have that conversation meaningfully
S0651	with the trustees or or even my my fellow hospice leadership team erm members really because it it get it it some of be guess work on my part about strategy have see many time before these kind of restructure in statutory service
S0282	yeah
S0651	end up with unintended consequences
S0282	yes
S0651	sorry i stop you you be gonna say something
S0282	no no no no that's fine erm so sorry how many ccgs in one two three four
S0651	er in yes yeah there's a yeah
S0282	okay
S0651	so this be the whole of and by and large that's the ones for yeah
S0282	okay
S0651	and the one that we cover most be this and
S0282	yes
S0651	and here be the population of of the erm the the ccgs which with politics with a big p on i mean there be some argument erm bear in mind this only come out the ccgs have only come out in the last four years
S0282	yes
S0651	er the health and social care bill
S0282	yes
S0651	and there be an argument some people think that they're gonna end up merge cos they think some of these populations be no big enough to get the economies of scale that
S0282	mm
S0651	that the ccgs need
S0282	yes
S0651	and when i think this this one district so it's really these three actually that make up
S0282	yeah well look at 's huge
S0651	it be but it's a unitary as well so actually
S0282	yeah so it'll it'll yeah they'll declare it'll be a it'll be private company
S0651	well it's interest cos you you like these kind of things i'm not sure and and i think i probably do too i'm not sure that the hospice be kinda bite remove in a third sector sense that it float like an island hospices they're outside the you know they're in the sector but outside the sector
S0282	mm
S0651	these three ccgs for yeah so and a rather erm coast be that what it's call a coastal community healthcare that's helpful erm
S0282	mm
S0651	be do lot of things together so they have one joint newsletter
S0282	oh right
S0651	and erm and they they and the the economies of the economies of scale for ccgs one of the really main players that's invisible unless you're immerse in this stuff be the commission support units
S0282	right
S0651	and there's a big paper about commission support units that's come out of government commission support units be suppose to make the economies of scale so these ccgs aren't big enough to commission
S0282	no oh
S0651	and so the the commission support units be pull them together find the economies of scale
S0282	er
S0651	and so really that's another restructure by the back door which be put pcts and strategic authorities back in things but if you read the guidance out of government they be to build the market that's their job be to build the marketplace this be privatisation of the nhs through the back door erm but but also some of the biggest threats around that be the old the nhs structure themselves
S0282	right
S0651	so erm
S0282	so these the faceless bureaucrats will be back
S0651	they be still there and they've not really leave so the chief exec of the commission support unit for what be and
S0282	mm
S0651	which now cover all of this cos it's now and and
S0282	oh do it
S0651	and something else
S0282	promotion
S0651	be the same people that go through the revolve door and take their two hundred and fifty thousand pound redundancy and have pop up again as the chief exec of whatever and as they try separate off commission also the deliverers be the same in the sense that if we take the bite here which i haven't isn't in here but it's my pencil line pct
S0282	mm mm
S0651	the chief exec take her money for redundancy from be the pct chief exec and become the and community health trust chief exec which be a delivery nhs organisation and and they be look to deliver well beyond and so for example
S0282	mm mm
S0651	my choice of cottage hospice again this be all about my choice of cottage hospice be in the and erm ccg have break rank with the other two on the issue of community service
S0282	oh right
S0651	and have push out its thirteen million pound community contract to any bidder so virgin healthcare could bid and be deliver that in another my cottage hospice there but also and community health trust have bid be bid to do it
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and what be
S0282	oh
S0651	healthcare community health trust have also bid
S0282	oh really
S0651	so the internal market for the nhs as well as the external market make a really uncertain time
S0282	wow wow
S0651	hence me want my cottage hospice here for the future for the people that live there
S0282	yes yes yes and also be the one the one identifiable unit er delivery that you might actually might give us some money to
S0651	yes and and particularly because that contract out
S0282	yeah
S0651	and people be bid in and they won't let the contract till next october by which time i'm hop to have break grind and say to the new provider by the way chap we have this new cottage hospice just open
S0282	yeah and be it now do they not do they have to have their community involvement section in their business case in their business case for their bid
S0651	in the they will have to have their community we er now your next the next level of complexity then
S0282	mm
S0651	yeah
S0651	so if i be to erm i can draw on this you can have this map if it's interest that there be possibly if i take this patch here and i say
S0282	yeah
S0651	they they're put out they're put out the yellow be put out their community service thirteen million pound
S0282	mm
S0651	arguably there be six hospices which have a bite of service into that community thing
S0282	right
S0651	so we've try to talk as hospices
S0282	be you that scribble
S0651	yeah we're that scribble
S0282	okay
S0651	erm and here
S0282	mm mm
S0651	erm they all do a bite they think of
S0282	yeah
S0651	that kind of service
S0282	yeah
S0651	and get money six six hospices from that ccg and tiny bits of money relatively i think we get about seventy two thousand pound
S0282	mm
S0651	but they all get and so the hospices then in this brave new world have be talk about pull together a consortium to speak to the new bidders and providers and to be part of their community plan for their bid
S0282	oh right
S0651	but the truth be that this be brand new to us as hospices they don't i believe they don't understand what consortium mean actually this be back to srb or or or lottery or you know we as hospices don't know what consortium mean and they all think that we can be a become a consortium
S0282	mm
S0651	and we can all have a seat at that big table they don't realise that that consortium will mean subcontract effectively
S0282	mm
S0651	but they have find out that the money that's give to hospices three hundred and eighty five thousand pound be not part of the thirteen million pound so they think everything's okay now but the truth be we have to work with that provider because that be the provider that will refer into hospice service so
S0282	yeah
S0651	actually i have have some negotiations with and be bid in we be also on the face of it part of this consortium of six because they don't know what's gonna happen so they're all look to consult and see what happen but er
S0282	yeah
S0651	the current provider be call community health trust who have be appal for ever and so that's why this ccg be get rid of them
S0282	right
S0651	so all of this mean this be the place to go i have no doubt that if we're gonna open a cottage hospice this be the place to go
S0282	right
S0651	it have no acute trust hospital it be feed by cottage hospitals
S0282	ah
S0651	and actually it be the place this be the most dangerous for us strategically of lose if something happen
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and therefore the patients themselves would struggle and lose out
S0282	mm mm
S0651	er and cos it's just new map and new new line this the ccg map didn't exist before so they're new map and new line and therefore that's why i think that's where we should go first
S0282	okay
S0651	i have float that idea with the ccg at our meet who think it be very interest and would like to speak more
S0282	say that last bite again what you float
S0651	i have float the idea of our cottage hospice idea with this ccg
S0282	mm right
S0651	and they're very interest in it and would like to know more the thing be i need to get past the gatekeepers the decision makers
S0282	yeah
S0651	but it kind of make sense to them because it make sense to them cos they're try to run a health economy with just cottage hospitals
S0282	yeah
S0651	so the cottage hospice concept fit into their construct of what they see
S0282	yeah
S0651	as secondary care
S0282	right uhu
S0651	there's another level of there about why to have it there cos what i don't want to happen be the cottage hospitals to go for palliative care in a big way cos they would be a major threat to us because they would be potentially a provider if there's money come and they get another level of complexity nationally a couple of years ago there be a palliative care fund review which be lead by tom hughes hallett who's the chief exec of marie curie
S0282	mm
S0651	and they what they're try to do with the palliative care fund review be find a per patient tariff for the government
S0282	ah right
S0651	to say what should the state do for palliative care patients
S0282	right
S0651	and how do we fund that so for three or four years they've be try to pull together this palliative care fund review they have massive consultations they produce various document they have a final document government be commit to it at the time that's the coalition they do eleven pilot sit to try and work out how the tariff and the currency would work
S0282	mm mm
S0651	they've push out another report a few weeks ago which be their final version which to me look like fudge smell like fudge and taste like fudge there will be no i don't think the well the the final document be clear there will be there's another set of pilot to do but it's clear that there would be no more money and and it will not be a statutory requirement however if that tariff can be erm an agreement which be voluntary and this ccg decide to follow that agreement and the cottage hospices take that money then that will affect hospices and others and so the palliative care fund review be more of a danger to hospices than it be a benefit because if acute trust can get money out of it then they will take money and make money out of it because another level of complexity in get your head back into the nhs system be although there be no secondary healthcare acute trust in this ccg be cos it's at
S0282	mm
S0651	yeah what's happen in the change in the health economy be foundation status for hospitals
S0282	yeah
S0651	as they get foundation status it give
S0282	yeah
S0651	them far more freedom to behave like a private sector hospital
S0282	yeah
S0651	which be another reason that this ccg doesn't want them as part of their picture cos they're go to charge more money and do things
S0282	right
S0651	and they could also do by open palliative care ward if there's money in it they would take that money which'd be another threat to the million pound statutory fund that we do that
S0282	oh right so but because there isn't a hospital that would have foundation status here there's less of a risk of that in this
S0651	it's just over the boundary
S0282	mm
S0651	so there's still a risk to us
S0282	mm
S0651	erm about the foundation status thing but that's in kent and it's less of a risk i think than here but it be one of the reason that this ccg be go for a very community base approach
S0282	right
S0651	in what it want to do that's why it's gonna commission community service thirteen million pound and part of that contract make them use the cottage hospitals that be in that patch
S0282	mm
S0651	but what i wouldn't want to happen be if those cottage hospitals start effectively become mini hospices and and open a ward that's that's just for palliative care patients cos lot of cottage hospitals be under utilise and look for a role and i
S0282	yeah
S0651	don't want them to find the role of our palliative care and de facto hospices
S0282	yeah
S0651	they're also they're not very good at it usually
S0282	well well that's like try to get a lawyer to be a mediator they don't
S0651	yeah
S0282	they don't do it
S0651	yeah
S0282	don't er that's not the skills they have so erm
S0651	but that won't stop the ccg try to get them to do it if the palliative care fund review make a revenue income string for them
S0282	well they're go to chase the money aren't they
S0651	they're go to chase the money absolutely
S0282	like everybody do
S0651	and the foundation trust might also chase the money but they're less likely to change the money because they
S0282	yeah
S0651	chase the money cos they've get such a massive area to cover
S0282	yeah
S0651	and if you want to go further with some of this if we if i go back to the kent bite of it
S0282	yeah
S0651	so this hospital which be really the and trust
S0282	mm mm
S0651	cos it's both actually it's and trust
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and so they have two hospital sit one at and one at
S0282	mm mm
S0651	which be another reason that i'm okay within that patch really it's another reason i don't need to open the first one here i need the second one to be here i think because we're we get most of eighty percent of our patients eighty percent of our money and we understand this system this health economic system better but in the longer term if i wind on ten years it will change maybe five because in there's a brand new hospital call the institute the institute of something something brand new massive private hospital have be build speculatively for the change in in health and i know from the ccg chief exec that this institute it's call the and something institute you'll find it on the website be demand that when they push out the contract which be currently to hospital as it always have be they want the chance to bid into it so it's gonna get competitive about acute trust and secondary care here
S0282	oh god who's build it
S0651	it's be build and i don't know who's build it i think it might be er er er i don't know who the private hospital be but it's brand new purpose build and it can't possibly be big enough yet but it be a private sector hospital
S0282	mm so somebody's get billion pound to
S0651	yes throw the money at
S0282	speculate
S0651	yes yes erm base around interestingly you know and so this pfi will need foundation status but it be gonna have to compete with this stuff here so we will come to that later erm that's fine
S0282	mm
S0651	if there's those level of complexity and there's another level of complexity if i talk about the five to ten years thing and if i think beyond ten years i think that county councils will become the main stakeholder for hospices not the nhs
S0282	right
S0651	the merge of health and social care will have to happen
S0282	yes yeah
S0651	and actually it won't be the health economy and the acute trust and the cottage hospitals that will be our main worry partner whatever it will be county councils
S0282	mm
S0651	because the health and social care and the dilnot report and everything will have to be address by somebody at some time
S0282	yeah
S0651	so the demographic be more elderly frail people and so that mean they get more cancers and and so so there be a there's another moral imperative
S0282	mm
S0651	for elderly frail people and i think that the partner in that will be county councils
S0282	mm
S0651	not not the nhs as we know it and therefore health and well be board if they continue depend who get in when the government change in in in a in a time horizon of five ten years beyond ten it will be them not the nhs
S0282	yeah well no they've get to it's it do it's ludicrous
S0651	yeah so
S0282	okay so and erm
S0651	mm
S0282	as far as that's concern this picture you're paint here
S0651	yeah
S0282	you're you're confident enough enough enough about it to to put your shirt on this because your man here
S0651	yeah
S0282	he back a an idea that didn't work and
S0651	the the thing back in about care you mean
S0282	yeah so but so but you're confident enough that this be you know your hunch your hunch or your or your strategic think about all this be
S0651	hunch yeah yeah
S0282	be right
S0651	i've think since i get here that cos that be the cusp of the act the health and social care act that the people at the people in that we serve and it go further down cos you get you then get into these kind of you know these these it's about where the gps be in here
S0282	mm mm
S0651	it's this part of this patch
S0282	yeah
S0651	that this have always be a danger for us because it could relatively at the stroke of a pen the ccg could say to all their gps you don't refer to people over the over the border in
S0282	right
S0651	and and therefore they could do that at at any
S0282	yeah and actually some be already do that aren't they so that
S0651	yeah
S0282	where be it where they've already say no you can't have choice any more
S0651	yes
S0282	where you go
S0651	and so my worry be we'll lose patient choice
S0282	yes
S0651	and if you stop the referral rout by gps then we then people wouldn't get wouldn't get refer into this hospice despite the fact they've support the hospice for twenty years
S0282	i always think that people self referrals to hospices
S0651	we've we've only just introduce self referral
S0282	really
S0651	we we
S0282	i think i think you elect to
S0651	no
S0282	i think you sort you say oh well you know i'd like to go to the hospice please and they say yes fine
S0651	well that would
S0282	and off you trot
S0651	that would be good if that's the case
S0282	doctor
S0651	gps gps gps be the main referrer
S0282	uhu
S0651	we're try to break that cycle and we've be try for a while to break that cycle and we will take self referrals in fact in the last few months we've put a self referral button on the website and we'll take phone self referral but in some respect that's a con because they're not self referrals because we still then have to go back to the gp and negotiate and say
S0282	right
S0651	mrs smith would like to be refer here can we have a conversation about this please so we have our
S0282	so the gps have to consent
S0651	they have to have the consent and mainly main referrals come from gps cos that conversation should be have with gps
S0282	mm
S0651	there's part of the stuff that drive the strategy for us be that it's a great piece of research which be pretty conclusive and people have buy into that say cos you can't buck these number you see at any one time one percent of a gps patient population be in the last year of their life
S0282	mm
S0651	fact some of that be sudden deaths and heart attack and car accidents however there's some good research that say in western democracies you know develop countries that's between sixty four i think sixty four and eighty one percent of those people in the last year of life should be should have palliative care need address
S0282	mm
S0651	so we know that one percent of our population three hundred and sixty thousand be in last year of life so we could see three thousand six hundred people a year
S0282	mm
S0651	we know we don't need to see all of them but we do know that actually between sixty odd percent and eighty percent let's say yeah we should be see and we're not see that so our big quest of of our business plan be to have a forty five percent increase so at the currently we see about eleven hundred new referrals each and every year and we intend by the end of the business plan period be see sixteen hundred new referrals each and every year which be another reason to build some bed capacity in
S0282	mm
S0651	which be stepdown bed stuff so it do fit
S0282	yeah
S0651	together my and my shirt and my
S0282	yeah
S0651	my things so
S0282	yeah
S0651	i'm pretty confident that that would be the first place to go
S0282	okay and then so then
S0651	it's it's a complex picture and argument to make isn't it
S0282	it be
S0651	to the uninitiated
S0282	it be rather yes cos you could go if but er
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	oh yes mm so so the sort of area you're look at be sort of that sort of the top half of there
S0651	yes
S0282	the top half of that
S0651	yes we have a shop in where we've have for many many years we have a shop in which we've have for not that quite that long
S0282	oh right aha
S0651	er and we serve these gp practice up here by and large
S0282	yeah
S0651	and we will certainly need to get the figure from the gp practice cos it's gp practice which erm which govern it all but as you can see there be because they're rural communities there be not a lot of gp practice to for the population they cover and serve so they're very spread out
S0282	mm mm
S0651	cos erm it we'll get the same thing if this map show and things you know the gp surgery do a lot of referrals to us which be possibly a kind of thing
S0282	oh right like yes
S0651	and so when you get if you take if that be then if that be that and we're quite you know we get a lot of referrals and good
S0282	mm
S0651	relationship with some people that go to live there
S0282	yeah i know i be
S0651	so so this become you know you could write a business case base around the reality of
S0282	yeah
S0651	what happen for home to work rout home to shop rout home to gp rout home to hospice rout blah home to hospital rout blah blah blah
S0282	yeah
S0651	etcetera etcetera so i i'm pretty confident that that's the big strategic solution we need to solve
S0282	yeah
S0651	because of the worry of unintended consequences of change
S0282	yeah well it's already the case in london i think you know with if you go to a gp surgery but you're over the line
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	next door
S0651	yeah and
S0282	we you didn't didn't use to have
S0651	ultimately we think we should be about patient choice if they want to come to us and be under our care then that should be their prerogative really
S0282	yeah no absolutely
S0282	no well that's what people expect as well
S0651	mm
S0282	okay so and your name be know round there as well already so you've you've already get a presence of
S0651	yeah yeah i
S0282	shop and things like that
S0651	i think that erm the the further you get away from erm
S0282	yeah
S0651	the further down you get past although we've get a shop in have also get a shop in be probably here then
S0282	oh right
S0282	oh yeah
S0651	erm actually the have get a shop in and they're they're they're there
S0282	naughty thing get back over the boundary
S0651	and so this become a dispute area of er for
S0282	yes
S0651	where you go
S0282	okay
S0651	because arguably you know we're about the same distance
S0282	yes
S0282	yes er er
S0282	and then you say you will need figure from the gp practice figure of
S0651	well if we're yeah
S0282	how many of them how what percentage of them you think be go to be
S0651	you see we yeah cos cos i know that the that the that the the practice there and the practice refer to us but i suspect that if the gp practice for be here i wouldn't be surprise if they do refer to there
S0282	mm
S0651	because hospices have be have grow up around a build and the truth be that we're not about a build we've probably get far more of our nurse in hospice in the home active here
S0282	oh right yeah
S0651	than they've get anything so build be just build so you
S0282	yeah
S0651	you put another layer of complexity be that we've get for hospice in the home in a really big way
S0282	yes
S0651	compare to other hospices because the research suggest that that's what people want so that research we say about demo you know the number of people that want to die at home
S0282	yes yeah
S0651	then we've try to meet that by put hospice in the home so effectively our hospice in the home be like i've get a five hundred bed virtual ward
S0282	yes
S0651	all over the place and a significant bite of it be here
S0282	but also that it's that that feel like the easier argument to make to people that actually if a lot of your nurse and a lot of your patients be round here then there will be quite a big proportion of them who get to the point where they can't be look at
S0651	yeah
S0282	and we're therefore have somewhere
S0651	absolutely
S0282	number one where you can bring their relatives for train and support
S0651	absolutely
S0282	and counsel and whatever and number two that if things get too tough at home you can say well actually just pop up the road
S0651	yes
S0282	into this unit
S0651	i i i would have to look at the figure on this when you say about put my shirt on it i also pretty confident that if you take the population of nurse home
S0282	yeah
S0651	here
S0282	yeah
S0651	and take them here this be less so again
S0282	oh right okay
S0651	there aren't enough of them i i suspect
S0282	yeah yeah
S0651	er because it's about if you want to run a care home do it in a big urban area you know run it in birmingham
S0282	mm
S0651	you know and so
S0282	yeah
S0651	and so they become so it's a scarcity a supply and demand kinda model
S0282	yeah
S0651	and so although i'm not try to open a nurse home it be the cottage hospice idea be not the same as a satellite of here i do not want patients with complexity here we've get consultants here we've get very specialist doctor we've get very very that's not the people i'm think i'm put in a cottage hospice it's stepdown care really but but the make sense about the logic that they would rather go
S0282	but it but it make sense that the nurse who do go hospice in the home be more
S0651	yes
S0282	the staff that you want in this one in in a cottage hospice
S0651	i think when we come to the staff of it i think that it's exist staff that we can utilise who want to do it absolutely yeah
S0282	yeah yeah
S0651	but also the cottage hospice idea be they can call in they're still the same patients so if they if they're out and active and they're here you know the the the the clinical nurse specialists and the staff nurse and the healthcare assistants that serve this be if mrs smith and they visit her in her home here a lot and they know here anyway and she need to come in because actually she can't cope at home cos whatever her husband can't cope often a carer failure that mean they can't cope
S0282	yeah i know i know
S0651	it's not a patient failure it's a carer failure
S0282	no well cos they just can't they can't just can't do it
S0651	yeah
S0282	you can understand why they can't do it and actually the
S0651	yeah
S0282	the not just demo report but the other report do by that help the hospices thing you know one of the one of the chief barriers be because the carers just think oh shit
S0651	yes yeah
S0282	yeah
S0282	can't do it
S0651	can't do it don't want to do it
S0282	no
S0651	so
S0282	well not don't want to but just think i i i can't how can i how could i what can i i don't want to watch it i don't wanna be there i can't do this i can't do that
S0651	yeah yeah so erm what be i go to say and sometimes actually it be interest it's monday today on friday one of our crisises on friday be be we be on the run up to christmas that we need the nhs to put five hospital bed in various place be be suppose to have do it all week and their system have fall down as it often do nhs do not put in the the the things they should put in lift blah blah blah blah blah bed erm and so we need five bed in arjo bed and then the contract
S0282	arjo
S0651	er it's a big manufacturer of bed
S0282	oh right okay
S0651	r r a r j o er but the nhs hadn't get them and they subcontract to arjo direct and their engineer be off sick so they hadn't put in these five bed
S0282	gosh
S0651	one of the patients die on the thursday so it's four bed then cos they need to go in when they need to go in
S0282	mm
S0651	erm and at at six o'clock on friday we i still hadn't sort it out er by get them in erm and so if that kinda thing happen we gotta put them into there
S0282	mm
S0651	i could put them in er i could i could bring them so that there wouldn't be that crisis at home and sometimes the nhs be just so poor that it make people then they're in they're in chair or they go to john lewis and buy a bed it's not a hospital bed it doesn't help it doesn't drop down it's not get to put up etcetera etcetera
S0282	no
S0651	mattresses
S0282	so it would just be another way that we could even if it wasn't permanent they could be in and in for a while and back out again
S0282	yes
S0651	whereas come here we be
S0282	yeah and that weekend holiday thing
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	which of course be also the big
S0651	yeah
S0282	the big thing
S0651	mm
S0282	where erm they the hospitals want you go before the bank holiday monday
S0651	yes
S0282	and the relatives think please don't send them home
S0651	so i think it's the logical place to put it's where we're weakest and less know
S0282	okay
S0651	it's where the change be happen er in a big way that's change the model
S0282	yeah
S0651	er in the nhs kinda set up erm healthcare set up er there's a new provider come in to do the community stuff so it's a it's you know that we we'd be there by the time they kinda come in erm i i er in back to that consortium i really jump all over the place the six hospices that serve this area we're serve poorly i think with the six of us and it could be like an end of life care facilitator i could get i could facilitate for to the other hospices actually
S0282	mm mm
S0651	as part of that whole process
S0282	right
S0651	although they i suspect they won't like it that the the hospices will not like me put a cottage hospices and they'll probably see it as
S0282	no they probably won't
S0651	no they i'm pretty confident they won't
S0282	yeah i know that's a tank
S0651	they'll see it as competition
S0282	be put on their lawn yeah
S0651	actually but whenever i've have discussions with them and they want to talk about collaboration because help the hospices be say that there should be collaboration i think in reality there should be mergers and acquisitions actually
S0282	mm
S0651	and although they talk collaboration whenever they talk about it they go i don't know what you mean if we can have a share understand of this that would be great but if we can't have a share understand whenever you say collaboration i'm gonna say and competition because actually sometimes we're gonna have to compete
S0282	mm yeah no nobody want but no yeah nobody want to be the one take over do they
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	but but and how much of this go in the business case be this all implicit then this stuff we we take
S0651	i don't mind
S0282	we take it as read that that that that decision be kinda make that it's kinda round here
S0651	i haven't i we've just be speak for what twenty minutes
S0282	something like that i think
S0651	i have articulate this
S0282	no thirty eight
S0651	thirty eight there you go cos i've talk too much and go off at tangents there
S0282	no no no no no no no this isn't
S0651	i i no i do i do no no no i have articulate this i think at board meet over the last four years i've certainly have quite a lot of discussions which may now look to be one of the problems with the chairman to explain some of the complexities of this
S0282	yeah
S0651	and although he's interest because he's the chairman and he see parallel cos he's a businessman first and foremost so
S0282	yeah
S0651	i think he understand what some of this logic be
S0282	yeah
S0651	not sure that i've tell enough of it to the trustees to paint the picture
S0282	yeah
S0651	but you also need to have some strategic understand of the statutory things
S0282	yes
S0651	and and how the third sector work to appreciate it so i i think we can put anything and everything in that business case and i think if we can articulate this in print for people then that would be great
S0282	yeah
S0651	erm
S0282	so it's kind of well there's a sort of future proof
S0651	yeah
S0282	section
S0651	and i maybe i need to have those conversations more with the hospice leadership team
S0282	unless you wanna blame me
S0651	no in what way
S0282	well you often ah well you know this be often the case when you buy when you bring people in to do a business case for you a business plan it's often so there be a lot of case where people be punt an idea and they don't know if it's gonna work or not
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	so you get your consultant shoot down
S0651	sure well i'll be alright then i'm pretty confident
S0651	that this be where we should go but strategy get complex doesn't it i mean you know
S0282	well no i mean the thing be that these things may or they may not come to pass i mean if there's a revolution and we don't have the same government next time
S0651	exactly yeah yeah
S0282	but then but then that's if there's other reason why it it it might go there like there be lot of patients there or there be lot of nurse there there be a lack of a great big hospital there you know the the other reason which be practicalities then come into play as well so
S0651	yeah yeah see the all the ones that i think that i've just articulate to you be if be you to have map them and use some business tool to map what kind of the reality of them be they're all pretty much a reality i could go another step about things that quite possibly as you say if the revolution come i don't think ever erm i and isn't big enough to be a decent county council i don't i don't think it ever have be
S0282	mm mm
S0651	and so be always a problem for them because
S0282	mm
S0651	actually some government ought to come in and make sure there's only one county council have say that that ought to be catch up in the fact of two tier authorities do not work
S0282	no
S0651	so if i say to you that i think in ten years it will be the county councils that be our main stakeholder relationship person not the nhs
S0282	yeah yeah
S0651	then they have to be big enough and so some government's get to come in and actually make them big enough and in do that they've get to address two tier authorities which nobody ever have so far
S0282	no no and then and that's a political hot potato isn't it
S0651	it's a political hot potato but if they be to merge at some point and which be what they ought to do in reality be would struggle even more with some of these things so if wind on ten years and think it's the county councils then that's another reason to be down here and make sure that you be there actually
S0282	that's huge though isn't it
S0651	it be it it be huge but you need economies of scale don't you
S0282	oh that's massive i mean how can you well yeah but you know that's geographically enormous isn't it be that that would be bigger than any other local authority i mean i suppose it's when you say they're too small it's cos of the population
S0651	it's the rural population that's diverse and
S0282	yeah
S0651	and and and scatter as well
S0282	yeah
S0651	but make it worse but actually in that revolution kinda thing the more likely the more blue sky think kinda stuff be the county councils have also get to get out of delivery cos too many of them have be deliver about social care
S0282	mm
S0651	and they don't do it cost effectively and they don't do it efficiently and they so they've gotta get out of that which mean be bigger and change completely because actually they're the commissioners they're contract managers of stuff
S0282	yes yeah
S0651	and but that more blue sky and it's more further on it's not something
S0282	yeah although that no plenty more opportunity for the private sector there
S0651	yeah which i think be what's gonna happen the truth be like the health be really i wouldn't be surprise to see virgin healthcare look bid for that bid
S0282	yeah
S0651	they do it in
S0282	with a thousand a thousand carers over the whole of of
S0651	yeah yeah yeah so that but that's probably not it's not easy to write that one in cos then people go but but but but the stuff we've speak about so far be easy enough to write into the bid to go this be why we're go down into into this ccg as our first cottage hospice
S0282	mm
S0651	with the intention of do something again on the edge of our patch later there's also just you know a a a a brain dump now really we've already make the move away from be a build cos i constantly say yeah hospices aren't about a build they're about a philosophy of care
S0282	right
S0651	and we all do that as hospices then we show picture of build to to reaffirm that we're about build erm but we're not and also the hospice in the home have move us away from be about build but in public perception we're still about build
S0282	mm
S0651	and my fellow chief execs of hospices
S0282	ah well then perhaps this be where macmillan have get the the rush on the hospices because it's they're about lovely ladies
S0651	they be indeed and don't don't have to have a build i agree
S0282	no
S0651	so i think you need both though
S0282	so yeah
S0651	cos you do need to be able to bring people in that's why i say in
S0282	mm
S0651	virgin healthcare deliver everything that we deliver except the inpatient unit and the reason they don't want to do that be cos it's expensive you can't make money out of it it's not cost effective so you do always need a build i believe
S0282	and who be gonna give money to virgin actually
S0651	well yes
S0282	i mean
S0651	so i think you need a build but it's
S0282	yes
S0651	it's build but have say that my fellow it's interest there be two s there's the there where's on here then that
S0282	it's a little funny lump
S0651	oh it's here sorry that's that's here right down here
S0282	mm mm
S0651	it's interest that 's get a as well so at there's a at
S0282	be they different different
S0651	yes totally different they're all independent
S0282	but the same originally probably
S0651	yes
S0282	but
S0651	but they yeah i'm sure they be this be interest that they have just outgrow their build which be quite a nice build but they've decide then they're gonna close and sell off that build and build and build a brand new build so they're all stick to build and we're not do build despite come to cottage hospice we're come to cottage hospice because we've grow hospice in the home to such an extent that it's an increase in bed in a stepdown way i think it i'm confident it fit into a bigger model jigsaw model really er but that's not what most people be do they're stick to build this
S0282	mm
S0651	move out of a perfectly serviceable but old build to a brand new offsite architect design win kind of thing they're still stick to build
S0282	mm
S0651	they're they're not go in to hospice in the home kind of territory and
S0282	but that's a fund strategy isn't it you can always you know in a way
S0651	get raise the money for it
S0282	you're do build work you can always get money for build work
S0651	yeah yeah yeah
S0282	as long as you don't go bust do it but yeah
S0651	and our nearest neighbour here that cover and would see itself as cover most of this this ccg
S0282	yeah
S0651	have i don't think any hospice in the home any community care at all
S0282	and what
S0651	and
S0282	mm
S0651	and it's call actually and hospice and
S0282	mm
S0651	so it's not even put itself as a hospice and if you go actually you could go and visit there and should go and visit there actually be it's here and continue care's interest so if you go to visit them
S0282	mm
S0651	they've just put a lot of money into a build too they've get like half of it be a hospice and the other side of it be continue care so we need to
S0282	what do they mean what sorry what be continue care
S0651	yes well i there's a separate paper if i haven't send you that paper i need to send you that paper about nhs continue care
S0282	right
S0651	because one of the income stream to support the revenue on our cottage hospice will be nhs continue care
S0282	oh right be this where you have your own budget
S0651	erm
S0282	no
S0651	it's kind of where you have your own budget so it get
S0651	it get far too complex actually
S0282	mm okay
S0651	but some hospices have go for nhs continue care money in a big way so if you get a when you get that diagnosis about a terminal illness then you can apply for all your social care fund stuff
S0282	yeah
S0651	with your and a personal budget if they give a personal budget
S0282	right
S0651	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0651	of course it's mean test so lot of people in well in don't get very much around social care
S0282	yeah
S0651	er but it's run totally separate to the nhs which run nhs continue care of with the criteria seem to me to be very complicate and i can't understand erm i can't understand the complexity of it so people don't know why they get it and why they don't get it etcetera etcetera but often people with a terminal illness can get fast track and get nhs continue care money which can then provide a huge care package for them for at home now often they use the same care care and nurse agencies as the social care budget do
S0282	right
S0651	but it's a pot of money which you can get on a weekly basis
S0282	yeah
S0651	as a patient particularly with a terminal illness in your last year of life
S0282	right
S0651	and we as a hospice have never really try to get into nhs continue care
S0282	oh right
S0651	but with the cottage hospice i want to and i'm
S0282	yeah
S0651	go to have the new nurse director when he start in january already get to look at nhs continue care because we should claim nhs continue care for our hospice in the home
S0282	but the but and
S0651	they already have go for it in a big way really
S0282	right oh they're they're gonna be really cross with you then
S0651	they're gonna be very cross yeah i think but it be part of the income stream i think it's about a hundred and thirty seven pound a week i don't know that for sure cos it
S0282	right
S0651	differ different place
S0282	hundred and whole hundred and thirty seven pound a week
S0651	yeah hundred whole thirty seven pound
S0282	crikey that must buy you such a lot
S0651	but but i could be wrong about that so i'm kind of erm it might be a day for all i know but we need to look at it
S0282	yeah
S0651	in fact it'd probably make more sense if it be a day wouldn't it cos actually if you're go into a
S0282	well
S0651	cos it's suppose to pay for you to go in that care home and cut through it sorry the nurse home you'll have to get into that one as well yeah care home be really about social care and be far less medical intervention a nurse home have nurse have to be register and and take that money so it's probably hundred and thirty seven pound a day
S0282	yeah
S0651	erm but we don't claim it well enough as a hospice and that knock onto another issue about hospice in the home so often we're go to look after people as hospice in the home and they've get nhs continue care so the agency go in then look after them and do various things for them and claim the money and we just go in and add value without claim any money against that and i want to break that cycle
S0282	mm
S0651	and i particularly want to break the cycle when they're come into a cottage hospice most people come out of a cottage hospice should be in receipt of nhs continue care we do sometimes claim it here in the inpatient unit but very rarely
S0282	right
S0651	because we're not long term it's not like they're gonna be in the nurse home for six weeks they're not suppose to be here for six weeks so we very rarely claim it but sometimes we claim it
S0282	oh right but so the reason you don't be because it's a long wind
S0651	you have to claim it you have to claim it
S0282	and somebody might be here for five days so you think well by the time we've claim it
S0651	yes yes you have to absolutely but the funny thing be i don't think it stop the clock tick so the agency that's not care for them at home get a hundred and thirty seven pound a day for nothing cos they're not send their people in to look after them
S0282	oh crikey right
S0651	so it's a bite of a mess that and i will have that unpick before you start so that we have the position clear about it
S0282	mm yeah
S0651	but i do want i don't want to pull people into a cottage hospice and not claim the money that's available from the statutory service as nhs continue care
S0282	mm mm mm right
S0651	that enough it's more than enough for your
S0282	erm well if i ever make any sense of this again it would be a miracle
S0651	oh of course yeah
S0282	but no i can listen to it again though this be the mind you they still
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	use to do this for interview
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	in the past okay that's right okay but erm okay no let's leave it there for the minute
S0651	that be just about a rationale to go there wasn't it that location
S0651	but it wasn't
S0282	well no no no no but it's it's all the
S0651	it be more
S0282	the background and i can now sound intelligent when i talk to other people about it
S0651	yeah
S0282	so erm but you say that you didn't think it be a new build be that because build
S0651	i think i've change my mind about that
S0282	okay
S0651	yeah yeah i think it's probably a new build
S0282	i think it's a new build
S0651	i didn't think it be originally that's my view's change
S0282	why do you think it wasn't a new build
S0651	i don't know actually i be wonder where you get your decisions from isn't it about your think process
S0282	well no when what's his face what be his name say to me
S0651	who
S0282	be it no it be no no not who be the other trustee that i meet
S0651	you meet
S0651	and
S0282	when say so you've get a picture in your head then
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	to me
S0651	yeah
S0282	i think oh good erm so what be the picture in your head
S0651	originally you mean or now
S0282	mm no originally
S0651	i think i think we could convert a build
S0282	right
S0651	and then and that's just i think my previous experience of utilise build so if i think back to and that build i kind of convert that build to make it what we want if i think about that centre which be a shell of the factory from we convert it be i didn't knock it down and build it again and i think it's my construct of build and what
S0282	mm
S0651	we've do with build
S0282	mm mm
S0651	or even see bid advisor trust be about conversion so newbuilds be not part of my consciousness and i think it really be as simple as that that you pull your experience from where your experience be really
S0282	mm mm
S0651	erm
S0282	well i think it's possible if there's the right build
S0651	yes
S0282	so say if there be a disused school
S0651	yes
S0282	or an old or a not an old hotel but a hotel
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	or erm or an or a an old indeed a cottage hospital that be disused
S0651	yeah yeah
S0282	an old nhs build that's disused
S0651	if you go
S0282	something like that possibly
S0651	if you go here they're not they're not that disused but er i agree we could look and we
S0282	yeah
S0651	can also envisage that we at the moment we have a kind of erm agreement with to find us shop that's we don't pay them for that we only pay them when they find something
S0282	mm mm mm mm
S0651	but they be erm and 's get a lot of experience of that kind of find things and know things and contact cos we're
S0282	right
S0651	build furniture warehouse and furniture shop and so when he talk about three hundred square feet he have a great construct about what three hundred square feet look like and i don't actually
S0282	right
S0651	i really struggle conceptually with it erm and so we can we can cast our once we know where we're go and it this might happen quite soon if you be accept some of my logic around that and we get hlt to accept the logic then we could be tell people at twenty ninth and thirtieth this be where we're go guy
S0282	mm
S0651	for the first one
S0282	mm
S0651	for the first one
S0282	mm
S0651	erm then we could start look and i agree that if we find the right thing we could convert but i also need to look about the cost cos the vat implications newbuild
S0282	yes
S0651	mean it's probably better to have a newbuild i suspect which be another part of that erm set up really
S0282	well yeah twenty percent
S0651	yeah and also we haven't yet decide what's in it cos when you come with your blank piece of paper there's lot of things like do it need a mortuary i don't think it do cos i think we need a relationship with a funeral director but that's interest cos it depend how big it be
S0282	mm
S0651	so there's so so the the you know so the conversion versus newbuild we haven't yet decide what's in it
S0282	no
S0651	i in my construct in my head you know i kind of see that there's six room or whatever or five or six room around it be all open off the centre of a of a you know a a nurse station with a kind of kitchen thing so i've get this thing in my head
S0282	mm
S0651	with where i always could see it so that also probably mean newbuild not conversion really but i think if we keep our options open
S0282	yeah let's find a very large oast house
S0651	an oast house that'd be good yeah
S0282	but then also you've get the you've also get the communal areas
S0651	oh i agree yeah i we need i mean we don't know what they look like yet so that's another part of it
