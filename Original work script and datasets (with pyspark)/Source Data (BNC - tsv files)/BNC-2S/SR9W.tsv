S0671	yeah
S0670	okay right so be this a good distance to throw from then
S0671	yeah i think so
S0670	so you
S0671	but i well i
S0670	further
S0671	we could go further we could go like let's try this yeah
S0670	so i mean how be you gonna do this
S0671	as in before i have it like there and we be both spread out so
S0670	okay so
S0671	so when we be talk just now it be like that whole
S0670	yeah
S0670	okay so do you wanna be a little closer
S0671	no this be fine
S0670	okay cool perfect we'll get equidistant
S0670	and it can pick up everything
S0671	it's i think i should do a study on erm when people well obviously there have be study do before on
S0670	yeah
S0671	the whole like the fact that you're be record in some way make you change your erm the way you speak and what you talk about
S0670	so like the uncertainty principle like on quantum mechanics where if you observe a erm a particle then you change what it's do you cannot know for sure where a particle be and how fast it's go you can know how fast one's go and or you can know where it be but if you know both then in observe it you're go to change its course
S0671	really
S0670	yeah
S0671	oh so that's er
S0670	and that be like the scientific equivalent of this wherein
S0671	okay
S0670	when you know you're when you're be observe it change what you're say
S0671	erm okay what about could you translate it into attribute of character so
S0670	okay
S0671	it's like
S0670	can you elaborate on that
S0671	so erm you don't a part of you doesn't erm i mean things be change all the time but er perhaps i'm talk about oh no it's a slightly different thing isn't it cos obviously things be change without you think about it
S0670	yeah but i mean like what so you're be you talk about erm characteristics in relation to be record or characteristics in the whole idea of uncertainty
S0671	of self
S0670	principle of self
S0671	yeah so how much do the self change when you think about it
S0670	oh that's good you lose me there for a minute but in that
S0671	yeah sorry cos i
S0670	last sentence you you bring it all back you whip it round erm
S0670	it be it be like an eclipse i i lose sight of the conversation for a second there
S0671	erm when i do the record with
S0670	yeah
S0671	erm and it's happen er to an extent now
S0670	yeah
S0671	but
S0671	it be like a it be like it be almost as if like we weren't chat to each other it be like a radio show it be brilliant
S0670	i mean it be a little bite like
S0671	and it's happen now cos like i'm not i'm we're kind of like there's another party in the room so
S0670	i'm not gonna lie there have be point in this conversation where like
S0670	i'm talk to you but my eye be kind of just flick towards the phone like
S0670	like we have some kind of mediator between us
S0671	i know we need to talk about something like
S0670	yes
S0671	that be
S0670	abstract solid
S0671	that be what we'd normally be talk about
S0670	right so let's okay two topics of conversation do you want to talk about your trip in the summer or do you want to talk about the abstract concept of the self and how it change upon think
S0671	erm neither i'll tell you er well
S0670	great thank for that
S0670	destroy
S0671	what be the other options
S0670	all of my ideas there
S0671	when i be when i be out get the shop i erm i want i like want to do two things when i get home one be watch an international rugby match
S0670	uhu okay
S0671	cos i be feel quite patriotic for some reason
S0670	right
S0671	and i be whistle erm
S0670	jerusalem
S0671	jerusalem
S0671	and do those feet
S0670	of course you be
S0671	erm
S0670	the only national anthem you subscribe to
S0671	erm and i incidentally go to sainsbury's
S0670	you
S0671	buy
S0670	incidentally
S0671	erm
S0670	go to sainsbury's
S0671	i go to sainsbury's buy my er
S0670	i be walk along quite merrily
S0671	buy my items
S0670	and i find myself in aisle three of sainsbury's local
S0671	and er buy buy my items and then realise nice pass i need some oats so i go to tesco's for my oats
S0670	oh
S0671	no the other way round
S0670	what you go to tesco
S0671	tesco's for my items and sainsbury's for my oats cos they be
S0670	be they better oats in sainsbury's
S0671	better oats
S0670	apologies by the way your er current oat bag have a hole in it
S0671	a hole
S0670	a hole
S0671	which which oats bag
S0670	there be a bag of oats on the table on tuesday
S0671	oh yeah that's history now mate
S0670	when
S0671	wouldn't worry about that
S0670	come round and we be chat about the knife he give us and i be say look how sharp it be so i demonstrate on your bag of oats
S0670	which it slice through quite cleanly
S0671	don't worry that's like a bag or two ago so i think so
S0670	a bag or two in one day
S0671	ah that's a bag ago yeah so it's fine i use that up this morning
S0670	you use a bag of oats per day
S0671	not er not a bag
S0670	i'm sorry
S0671	that particular bag
S0670	your face suggest that
S0671	it wasn't
S0670	you be really self conscious about that like yeah
S0671	it wasn't new unless be it new
S0670	so so what
S0671	yesterday
S0670	no it be use
S0671	oh then yeah i didn't use a whole bag then do i
S0670	well you might've do
S0670	it be most of a bag surely okay i feel we're get off topic
S0670	tangents
S0671	see this be good this be less like a radio show it's more like
S0671	normal conversation
S0671	could you imagine if radio show be like this
S0670	mate we would have the absolute worst
S0671	we would have no listeners
S0670	radio show no one would listen
S0671	or they would and then turn it off
S0671	immediately
S0670	straight chat with and
S0671	and chat
S0671	for half an hour
S0670	with guest star
S0671	when the conversation get dry we just stick on
S0671	for a few minutes
S0670	mate with you could stick him on for a couple of hours
S0671	man
S0670	i've say it before i'll say it again the man can chat for days
S0671	our conversations do turn towards occasionally don't they
S0670	they do i think the friends be a er
S0671	they're an ever present force in our
S0670	they they they really be
S0671	in our rhetoric
S0671	magnetic field
S0670	sorry what
S0671	like
S0670	a magnetic field
S0671	they they men there they have a magnetic field
S0670	oh you mean magnetism
S0670	that's something that's applicable to humans rather than i mean i guess we have magnetic field but not
S0671	not particularly big
S0670	not on a functional scale
S0671	how big would we have to get in relation to another object
S0670	oh erm
S0671	do you know or not
S0670	it's not size erm
S0671	be it
S0670	really
S0671	relative be it relative to no it can't be relative or else like leave would be
S0670	no no there be two okay two things firstly we don't really have a magnetic force like
S0671	oh
S0670	we have we have iron within our blood which i guess could technically be magnetise erm you know how you can make like iron file magnetise by
S0671	yeah
S0670	roll them on a magnet i guess if you like rub a human enough against a magnet
S0670	they might grow slightly magnetise
S0670	but interestingly by the laws of gravity we have a gravitational attraction to each other so
S0671	minimal
S0670	you can i mean like it be nought point
S0670	nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought one of a newton roughly er a pascal or a a pascal i think so really
S0671	sound so
S0670	the most ridiculously tiny force but you can't ever truly say i'm not attractive because
S0670	you be if you're in a room with someone they be technically attract to you and you be attract to them
S0671	what happen if you're stand the other way be you repulse them
S0670	story of my life again you're think of magnets
S0670	gravity kind of doesn't have er a polar opposite
S0670	gravity isn't one day gonna be
S0670	like nope inverse to the sky
S0671	oh
S0670	oh
S0671	oh
S0670	oh
S0671	oh i'm so glad those bricks be there
S0670	destroy our garden bricks i think you be about to trip up and fall backwards onto that pile
S0671	i wouldn't do something like that
S0670	yeah thank for that
S0670	cheer
S0671	cor mate that be a good fifa sesh today as well
S0670	it be a oh i mean it be an alright session it end poorly
S0671	dismally
S0670	no don't don't no you don't say it end abysmally it end very well for you
S0671	yeah well it end well for me for once
S0670	yeah it be a happy end for and er throw erm the controller into my own knee for me
S0670	i'm not gonna lie that actually hurt but i be like oh come on smash oh
S0671	oh come on come on
S0671	in other news the musketeers be back on bbc iplayer
S0670	really
S0671	yeah
S0670	oh
S0671	do you remember the musketeers
S0670	yeah i love that show
S0671	there's a preview so like maybe in a few months' time be on
S0670	oh goodness be we still gonna have live live tv then cos you know tv licence and everything oh yeah by the way
S0671	
S0670	they be think of erm the bbc be consider erm because there's be a fair bite of privatisation go on around that kind of sector you know
S0671	they're gonna privatise the bbc
S0670	they're not go to they're try to like the government the conservatives be try to
S0670	like bite by bite it's a very long plan like there's a four or five year plan for it erm which obviously could get stop at any point but it's very subtle because it's such a long
S0671	yeah
S0670	plan but basically the upshot of this be doesn't matter cos that's if it do happen it's not gonna happen for a while what could happen soon
S0671	bbc iplayer you have to pay for it
S0670	bbc iplayer might have to be a pay service pretty soon
S0671	well in which case tv licence might not be a bad idea it's only thirty quid
S0670	what
S0671	what
S0670	tv licence be a hundred and fifty quid
S0671	oh be it really ah
S0670	per household and also you know we already have one
S0671	yes
S0670	for a bite
S0670	yeah i'm not gonna lie we have not use that like cos
S0671	mm i've watch
S0670	live tv like physical live tv forget iplayer live just live tv i watch probably about two episodes
S0671	but
S0670	two half an hour episodes of something on e four when we first get the aerial set up
S0671	the actual live tv
S0670	yeah
S0671	so i watch a few things live on the iplayer
S0670	oh no that that's a separate category we'll get to that in a minute slow down
S0671	yeah
S0670	so live tv like with the aerial plug into the tv and everything have you watch anything
S0671	no
S0670	no have
S0671	well oh
S0670	hasn't either i know because
S0670	i don't think she'd know where to plug it in properly erm cos to be fair it's a mess of wire up there like who know what's the difference
S0671	yeah
S0670	between an aerial and an xbox wire up there
S0670	erm i i as er as i say i've watch two half an hour episodes of something on e four erm so that's it so of live tv with the aerial which we get subsidise twenty five pound for because i'd pester er we've use for an hour in the past year how how much have you watch live on iplayer cos i know that i've do none
S0671	i've watch a fair amount live on the iplayer
S0670	really
S0671	i've watch sport i've watch rugby game
S0670	you've watch sport i i be watch some sport on iplayer
S0671	erm i watch rugby game
S0671	i watch erm one or two so one or two program that be live that weren't sport but the majority be sport i'd say maybe three rugby match and one other programme
S0670	oh excite
S0671	and that sort of thing you can't substitute that cos you can't watch rugby match the next day in term of like everyone else know the score and you don't so
S0670	well then don't ask em
S0671	i've try that
S0671	it's not as fun
S0670	i mean no it's not as fun but be it worth fifty pound a year
S0671	mm when you could also just go to the pub i suppose
S0670	yeah i suppose yeah but oh to be fair we haven't be have you be to our local have you be to the
S0671	yeah i go there to watch a rugby game actually
S0670	ah well that's where that come in how be it
S0671	erm local
S0670	local
S0671	it wasn't like it wasn't like the or anywhere like erm yeah
S0670	
S0671	er
S0670	
S0671	more
S0670	
S0671	more like a cross between
S0671	a a village hall and the er
S0671	so 's quite cosy isn't it
S0670	yeah
S0671	well this be this be less than cosy but it's like not
S0670	i'm just imagine the village hall back in which have a bar which stock probably about three beers
S0670	you can have draught you can have lager or you can get out
S0671	or lemonade
S0670	oh goodness
S0671	the other thing i be
S0670	exotic
S0671	the other thing i be erm quite fancy watch be university challenge
S0670	oh university challenge
S0671	i be in that sort of i don't know what the sort of mood that be when you wanna watch international rugby game and university challenge i think it's a street mood
S0670	i'd agree you get the sport the intellect
S0671	and er 's
S0670	's period drama what do you think that just culture
S0671	oh culture so
S0670	yeah athletic academic culture that's the three of us
S0671	what a house what a house
S0670	great house great mix obviously we all have part of those three within us
S0671	yeah
S0670	but i'd say that we
S0670	yes we're emblematic of
S0671	yes erm yeah i'm go to be please next year when
S0670	yeah
S0671	we don't have a small group here
S0670	oh okay yeah
S0671	if we don't have a small group
S0670	we won't
S0671	just well i mean feel free to like if you're lead one and
S0670	yeah
S0671	when you're lead one
S0670	mm i'd still very much say if i'm still consider whether i'd say yes at this stage
S0671	good
S0670	because although it'd be a great thing to do like and i'm i'm not gonna get into it because we both know exactly why it would be great to do it it be third year it's my final year of uni i really need to knuckle down
S0671	yeah
S0670	get work do if i get through with two ones this year i'll be happy
S0671	yeah
S0670	but i'm gonna be honest my aim next year be to push as hard as i can and if i can scrape a first that'd be incredible
S0671	okay
S0670	erm so but yeah no i mean cos you're you're not do next year
S0671	i'm not i'm gonna switch off a little bite there and er like you focus a little bite more on
S0670	yeah i think that's what i'm gonna do
S0671	and
S0670	erm be again but not here
S0671	erm
S0670	oh
S0671	yeah i think she be
S0670	yeah
S0671	erm good on her
S0670	yeah definitely she'll lead well with
S0670	i mean it's can you believe can you just imagine how
S0671	do you think do you think they're similar to each other in term of their like personalities cos seem to think that yes
S0670	well they're both tall vaguely blondie brownish hair both private school
S0671	be private school
S0670	i'm pretty sure he's a non board private school
S0671	okay
S0670	up in he's a little bite
S0671	land
S0670	obviously he's and 's so
S0670	slightly different kind of private school vibes go on there
S0670	but er i guess they be a little similar they they both have that kind of extroverted nature don't they
S0671	yeah both extroverted but like i wouldn't yeah
S0670	they have two different humour and
S0671	yes
S0670	manners of just you know be but
S0671	yeah
S0670	they're not hugely dissimilar
S0671	yeah
S0670	yeah in fact who would you liken to the most get you stump there haven't i
S0671	you have
S0670	be he a unique one
S0671	he's a unique one isn't he
S0670	yeah
S0671	i've meet people like him before though i just can't remember where
S0670	i've meet men of your calibre before
S0671	your
S0670	oh oh gosh
S0671	you tempt the that's a good move you tempt the kick there
S0670	that's what you've gotta do
S0671	oh
S0671	there you get it
S0670	yeah
S0671	you get it it's like it's almost like a
S0671	non er
S0670	oh yes
S0671	oh
S0671	right i'm not gonna
S0670	i be it over to that side to try and get you to swing round
S0670	yeah wait where be we before we be talk about how dissimilar and similar and be
S0671	university challenge
S0670	yes yeah university challenge that's great great show oh
S0671	oh
S0670	thursdays
S0671	wednesday
S0670	oh dear wednesday be it oh
S0671	so
S0670	oh
S0671	er before we leave here i'm gonna try and er talk to that girl er in er the white house
S0670	what about
S0671	next to the brown
S0670	uhu about get
S0671	about how attractive she be er what
S0670	oh great that's er that's classic you
S0671	classic me mate
S0670	yeah women love him
S0671	the shark
S0671	the shark
S0670	i mean yeah
S0670	yeah i'm oh be like that's just let's not talk about cos
S0671	do he really post his erm
S0670	he do
S0671	do he really post
S0670	he say that on twitter he say that he erm
S0671	that's gonna be
S0670	yeah i mean like
S0671	do you reckon they'll get onto that or not
S0670	to be fair if a future employer see that and it's possible erm it's not hugely likely but it be possible then you know that's not gonna go down too well for him as to whether like the exam board will find out i have high doubt they will
S0671	yeah
S0670	there's not a chance that a university cos er it's it's internally mark isn't it
S0671	yeah
S0670	so i have i'd have doubt that a university of several thousand students
S0671	sorry
S0670	would bother to check even just all of the facebook account let alone twitter
S0671	yeah
S0670	i mean twitter's big but it's a little slightly more niche than facebook
S0671	but do you think there's any way of check like the hashtags like or something like a similar hashtag kind of thing where they have the word so if they have like a sentence that say something like i don't know why they'd bother check a lot of time
S0670	yeah yeah and even if they do to be fair the exam board can't actually do anything about it because
S0671	he might be lie for all we know
S0670	because there be no way first of all tell that he's tell the truth and second of all that it's him
S0671	yeah yeah
S0670	it could like it could plausibly be a friend mess about with a parody account
S0671	a bitter jape yeah
S0670	a jape yes a well mean
S0671	bitter jape
S0670	banterous jape bitter jape
S0670	there's nothing wrong with a bite of bitter japery yeah so do you have a nickname when you be a when you be a hockey boy
S0671	no
S0670	do you have nickname in college
S0671	no
S0670	do you have a nickname in
S0671	no
S0670	and bear in mind i mm there be keep it clean
S0670	we're before
S0671	i didn't
S0670	watershed so i mean
S0671	i didn't actually
S0670	you didn't
S0671	no i be just
S0670	to your face
S0671	to my face
S0671	i be erm actually in hockey
S0670	oh
S0671	like no one no one
S0671	else be
S0670	thrill
S0671	outside
S0671	outside
S0670	that's an excite hockey story behind the nickname
S0671	no one call no one call me anything
S0670	so how do you get that one well that's my surname oh goodness gracious
S0671	yeah
S0670	oh
S0671	but that's only that's only a nickname because
S0670	there be
S0671	no one else
S0670	more than one
S0671	you don't get yourself call by your first and your second name apart from in hockey
S0670	oh
S0671	well obviously you do in you know what i mean
S0670	yeah
S0671	it doesn't happen at lecture people don't say oh hi
S0670	well i mean not in lecture but it do sometimes happen
S0671	why do you
S0670	erm not really and erm take to call me
S0671	the lads that they be
S0670	take to call me and for a little while
S0671	why's that
S0670	erm i think to be honest it be just try to detract from the fact that they just both have really bad nickname through their own fault
S0671	which be
S0670	well didn't really have a nickname but we just make constant joke about because he look like he have grey hair when he be young
S0670	erm and he like he like the show wallander still do erm and he think that a a beige volvo be a an estate be a sensible choice for a car
S0670	and like i agree with him on that front but when you're in like year eight or nine you don't be like oh when i learn to drive get a er volvo s forty
S0670	so we just immediately like he's an old man and old man turn into like just absolutely ancient
S0670	one of my favourite joke about be when we'd play football with him someone would slide tackle him
S0670	like steady on his bone be a bite brittle
S0670	it's what happen when bone get fossilise
S0670	erm so it be just any kind of i think for a while we call him father time and stuff like that
S0670	erm but
S0670	but to be fair have a much worse nickname and that be that be entirely his fault erm in the sense that his name be so in year seven
S0670	people be like oh hey who be you he'd be like i'm
S0670	but call me because as an innocent young year seven he have no idea what those two letter mean
S0671	do you at that point or not
S0670	he didn't he know like
S0671	do you at that point know though
S0670	yeah
S0671	as in okay great
S0670	yeah like everyone know it be just him that have no idea
S0671	oh that's that's tragic
S0670	so every now and then we'd just call him and he be just like stop it i didn't know
S0670	and then for some reason start call him and that stick so his nickname be
S0670	i think that's his gamertag as well on xbox cos you know
S0671	nickname be so bad
S0670	it's it's just so weird like i have no idea why the only thing the only thing i can remember about its origin be that a little while after he'd start call him erm he he'd just go
S0670	that be also a good one
S0670	yeah
S0671	like there be some great nickname in the hockey club cos of course like in the first couple of socials
S0670	yeah
S0671	you just like if you wanna get a nickname you do something weird and wonderful and then
S0671	you get a nickname for the rest of your life
S0670	nice

S0670	so back story i have a friend call in secondary school erm and we have a geography teacher call mrs miss miss
S0671	miss yeah
S0670	i think it's miss
S0671	oh
S0670	so oh la la so we're erm
S0671	oh really
S0670	we're do
S0670	we're we're we're we're
S0671	a man's life hang in the balance in secondary school
S0671	just to put that in context
S0670	it really do he he wasn't have an amaze time of
S0671	really
S0670	time of it either and so we're in geography erm and we're play the resources game do you know the kind of rough so like where everyone be a country for the lesson and you have a task to do and you have a set number of resources the more economically er stable the country and erm er more you know what i'm on about where what's what's the name for it
S0671	a
S0670	ledc and medc
S0671	yeah yeah okay
S0670	more economically develop country so if you're a more economically develop country you get more resources if you're less you get less resources
S0671	classic
S0670	in this case resources be i it's cos you have to cut out erm piece of paper into shape
S0671	oh nice so you actually have the scissor or the
S0670	so it's production yeah yeah yeah
S0671	so some people but some people would be rich in natural resources so like
S0670	yeah so for example i be the i be either the uk or the usa i be a big country big dog
S0670	erm so i have lot of scissor and lot of piece of paper whereas some countries like india have one piece of paper and some countries just have like no paper or no scissor so they have to try and barter for it so basically
S0670	the way that i manage to win this erm be slightly cheat i decide to outsource so i be like
S0671	oh nice
S0670	you're india
S0670	if you come over and do half the work with me i will give you a third of my winnings and skittle with the money so you be produce with scissor and paper
S0671	yeah
S0670	but the money be technically skittle the more you produce the more skittle you get
S0671	okay
S0670	so i be like well come over here i'm outsource to your country now we're work together you do the work i do a little bite we're gonna win because obviously i have way more resources than anyone else so i win that way
S0671	nice
S0670	in the modern way of win
S0670	forget old fashion work i use bribery erm and then then er basically at the end everyone go off to break
