S0473	so what be you do this weekend
S0058	er this weekend i'm do nothing much and it's really nice cos i've have
S0473	oh
S0058	for the last sort of five or six weeks i've have something every single weekend
S0473	oh right
S0058	so i'm really look forward to not do sort of anything
S0473	just chill out
S0058	just chill out
S0473	right
S0058	erm i i go to a few weeks ago and buy like fourteen book
S0473	to where to where
S0473	oh right
S0058	i go to see the book town in
S0473	no i'm go there
S0058	oh it's really good
S0473	in er next month
S0058	it's really really good
S0473	oh right
S0058	erm so the first couple of days be really sunny so we be walk
S0473	yeah
S0058	but we do some canoe and i think we've get two days leave when we and we spend two days just in the bookshops
S0473	er but it's it's not during the festival
S0058	i didn't go to the festival it's it's
S0473	no
S0058	really good anyway
S0473	even even any time
S0058	yeah
S0473	oh that's great okay
S0058	really really good and i get seven book
S0473	yeah it's just full of bookshops
S0058	full of bookshops and some of them be kind of special interest ones so there's more of the like crime and fiction and i think there's children's fiction ones and some of them be just massive massive build with a load of secondhand book
S0473	wow
S0058	it be really good
S0473	how fantastic er well i'm really look forward to it and and we're we're go to we've get a ticket to the rugby world cup
S0058	oh okay
S0473	in
S0058	nice
S0473	and er the idea be to go first of all to and so we pick on and think maybe it's still okay even though it's not festival time it'll still be interest but
S0058	yeah i wonder if it be actually nicer because apparently during the festival the normal population be about ten thousand and it go to something like a hundred thousand during the festival
S0473	right
S0058	so i think it's difficult to actually get
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	whereas when we go it you know it be still summer holiday
S0473	yeah
S0058	wasn't
S0473	yeah and easier to get accommodation and things like that
S0058	yeah we have a lovely cottage and
S0473	yeah
S0058	we go camp in a field and it just
S0473	oh right
S0058	it be all
S0473	yeah yeah yeah
S0058	very pleasant and a really nice
S0473	oh excellent
S0058	way to spend a few days
S0473	and i i think i've once be near the kind of
S0058	right
S0473	but i don't really know it at all
S0058	yeah i'd never be before erm i think i must have drive past it at various point erm
S0473	yeah yeah oh well that's great
S0058	yeah yeah
S0473	that's good to hear
S0058	really
S0473	so you're read through all the book now then
S0058	well yeah i'm try to read through the book and i'm i be make really good headway and then yesterday i buy three more
S0473	yeah
S0058	er where the author be sign some book so
S0473	okay
S0058	i've i've get to get
S0473	and you and you always read print book you don't read er ebooks
S0058	i've get a kindle
S0473	yeah
S0058	i really like it and i i'm not like a sort of massive opponent of ebooks but
S0473	yeah
S0058	i still like print book
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	erm i think you know about go on holiday i'll take a book and i think oh but what if i finish this
S0473	yeah yeah yeah
S0058	oh but what if i i don't want to really leave it
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	so i think if i take like a book and a kindle that
S0473	yes
S0058	sort of cover
S0473	yeah yeah that's true
S0473	that's true
S0058	that seem to work quite well for me
S0473	i've find the only problem be well i don't read off a kindle i read off an ipad and i can i get easily distract so if there's something in the book and i'm think i wonder if that's true or if that really
S0058	yeah
S0473	happen and then i then i find myself
S0058	that's why i think a kindle work quite well
S0473	yeah
S0058	that you can't really use it for anything other than
S0473	yeah
S0058	read book
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	it's like it's kind of easy to get distract on to another book
S0473	yeah
S0058	but there's no yeah you can't
S0473	you can't start
S0473	yeah yeah yeah and it's lighter isn't it
S0058	yeah yeah it be
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	and it's sort of the screen be really nice
S0473	yeah
S0058	like i wasn't sure about read on on a kindle
S0473	no
S0058	it's a quite a small screen but it it's really nice and i think an ipad even if they manage to sort of dim it it's still shiny when you
S0473	it be yeah yeah yeah
S0058	a kindle actually feel sort of a bite like a book and it's
S0473	yeah yeah well i be read it on a beach a couple of weeks ago and i think this be crazy cos it's
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	yeah
S0473	it be very difficult
S0058	mm
S0473	but the nice thing you know i be read erm shogun
S0058	oh right
S0473	recently you know i don't know if you know and this be full of complicate character plot twist and things
S0058	right
S0473	and so to be able it's get some feature where you can just highlight a word and then it bring up every or a name it bring up every previous mention
S0058	ah
S0473	of that name
S0058	oh that's good
S0473	and so you can just kind of click through and work out what they what they have do already and who they be
S0058	that's really useful yeah
S0473	so i've get brilliant brilliant
S0058	i've just read erm a hundred years of solitude
S0473	oh right
S0058	and that be a similar thing
S0473	yeah
S0058	and it's really complicate and you've get all the character have the same name as well because every generation the they rename them the same name
S0473	oh right yeah
S0058	so it's an absolute nightmare try to work out
S0473	yeah
S0058	and there's like a family tree in the front so i be kind of flick
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	back to that and i'm glad i read it in print just to
S0473	yes
S0058	to be able to turn back so easily but
S0473	yeah
S0058	yeah you find yourself have to write you know the one with the cow
S0473	yes
S0058	or the one with the so just to try and grasp at what it be
S0473	well well that's what i when i first start read erm on my ipad that's what i think the problem be go to be be that normally i find myself write things on the inside cover
S0058	oh okay
S0473	who the different people be and what their relationship be and so it's it's difficult to do but
S0058	yeah
S0473	when i discover this feature i think that oh well it's it's better in some ways
S0058	yeah that be really cool
S0473	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0473	so well my weekend my son's come back from
S0058	oh that's good
S0473	erm on sunday yeah so i'm look forward to that that'll be er sort of we're busy cook lot of food and cake and things like that
S0058	he wouldn't in
S0473	no no no no that's right they don't apparently well well they don't have they don't have the same kind of cake i don't think
S0058	yeah that's true yeah
S0473	so same tradition of cake so
S0058	mm lot of cake
S0473	yeah
S0058	so be he back kind of
S0473	back permanently yeah yeah it be a six month erm
S0058	yeah
S0473	secondment and er he's back and gonna move back to so that's good six
S0058	brilliant have he enjoy it
S0473	he's love it and and he's really extract every minute of er er every possible thing he could have and every weekend he be travel do things so erm you know he he doesn't feel like he's miss opportunities
S0058	that's brilliant
S0473	yeah yeah
S0473	it be good so have we do our ten minutes
S0058	er we've do six minutes
S0473	oh six
S0058	i think we start off fairly well
S0473	yeah yeah yeah
S0058	so what what be your son do then i'm try to remember
S0473	he's he's a he will be a lawyer
S0058	that's it yeah
S0473	he will have qualify by er by in a couple of weeks
S0058	oh that's
S0473	yeah they they do it's a bite similar to the to the graduate train programme here where you you have six month
S0058	yeah
S0473	in different er placements
S0058	yeah
S0473	in different er part of er of the organisation so that you kind of know everything er and then you qualify
S0058	i see
S0473	yeah well that's and i think it work really well the graduate trainee
S0058	yeah
S0473	thing here which be do erm
S0058	yeah just get to see all the different part of it
S0473	yeah that's right so
S0058	i don't know why they've change it
S0473	they've change it but apparently they're they're think of go back er to it again what's her name erm i think
S0058	oh yes yeah
S0473	do do you know our our intern
S0058	yeah she be say she want
S0473	she want to do that and she speak to er about it
S0058	oh right really
S0473	and she say they be plan to go back to erm or they're think of go back to it and i think it take more work it's more erm
S0058	right
S0473	kind of er time consume to set up
S0058	mm i can imagine
S0473	yeah but erm
S0058	and it be for us it work out really well because obviously do a little bite with us and do some really useful stuff anyway for those few weeks
S0473	yeah
S0058	and then have go on to do something really interest
S0473	yeah
S0058	relate to this anyway so i think
S0473	yeah
S0058	it be kind of worth the time
S0473	well she's see every you know she's see sales she's see editorial she's see the research side
S0058	yeah so really
S0473	she's really do everything yeah
S0058	yeah i think that would have be kind of cos it's really hard when you're just start off to think well i kind of like book publish
S0058	but you'd still want to know what the options be editorial which be probably why editorial be swamp with
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	people because
S0473	yeah
S0058	it's sort of hard to know
S0473	and yet editorial be quite in some ways in elt it's quite difficult to get into directly cos
S0058	mm yeah
S0473	they kind of expect five years of
S0058	yeah
S0473	teach experience and
S0473	and all those things
S0058	yeah
S0473	erm you know in some ways go from market or or sales or something it's probably an easier way in
S0058	definitely yeah
S0473	yeah
S0058	if you're not sure elt be for you it's a really good way of
S0473	yeah
S0058	see it and
S0473	yeah
S0058	find out what it's about without need to go off and do a for five years for teach and
S0473	that's true
S0058	or actually
S0473	yeah and to go into i always think something like market be quite good because you it's very transferable
S0058	yeah
S0473	you know if you
S0058	yeah
S0473	go off to er some completely different business unrelated but
S0058	yeah market yeah
S0473	but they still kind of recognise her work here as be useful
S0058	yeah yeah
S0473	whereas the elt editorial it's kind of hard to see where you would go from that except
S0058	yeah it's kind of niche yeah
S0473	yes it's
S0058	mm that's true
S0473	so so the plan be just to chill out all weekend then
S0058	yeah yeah i've get sort of a few fairly busy few kind of weeks
S0473	yeah
S0058	so again just have a
S0473	well i always feel like when when weekend people say what do you do and i say well i didn't do anything
S0058	mm
S0473	and it make it sound as though i literally sit down and do nothing
S0058	yeah
S0473	but but i be do things the whole time
S0058	yeah
S0473	you know i think i can't remember rest
S0058	yeah
S0473	but er i didn't do anything worth say
S0058	exactly i'm sure i'll do things
S0473	right
S0058	i'll probably go for a run
S0473	yeah
S0058	erm
S0473	be you go be you try the marathon train again or
S0058	i'm i'm do a ten k in october and probably a half marathon in november
S0473	mm
S0058	and then maybe a marathon next year but
S0473	oh that's serious
S0058	yeah well apparently i read cos i be think be this realistic and apparently it only take like sixteen weeks to actually properly train for that and you could do it in sixteen weeks so long as you're
S0473	every day run
S0058	i i don't even think
S0473	no
S0058	i think every day kind of something
S0473	yeah yeah
S0058	like rest and some days you're not actually run but you're do something
S0473	oh right yeah
S0058	but that's not like
S0473	no no okay
S0058	it doesn't it doesn't sound very long
S0473	no
S0058	erm so i'm think about pick a smallish flatish marathon and
S0473	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0473	yeah
S0058	well there isn't a a
S0473	there be half marathons
S0058	yeah exactly it's a half marathon which be really good erm
S0473	london i suppose be the obvious one isn't it
S0058	yeah it's quite hard to get into
S0473	it's a lottery or something isn't it
S0058	yeah i'm think about start to enter the ballot from
S0473	right
S0058	this year and just
S0473	yeah
S0058	leave my name in there and one year it'll come up
S0473	i'm sure erm the lake district marathon
S0058	i can't think of anything worse i just can't see the appeal it's like cycle as well i can't see why you would cycle up a hill just with live in because it doesn't make any sense
S0473	well there be it's it make you realise the kind of sense of erm ski holiday cos there you get the benefit of be
S0058	yeah
S0473	at the top of a hill
S0058	yeah
S0473	and a mountain without actually have to
S0058	yeah exactly
S0473	kind of do the effort
S0058	and you get
S0473	the efforts all go down
S0058	the joy of come down and then something take you up to the top
S0473	yeah
S0058	i can kind of get that
S0473	well that's when er i realise the the fantastic thing of go to the alps what other place which be build for ski
S0058	yeah
S0473	in the summer because they have those ski lift still work or some of their lift still work
S0058	oh right
S0473	so you can get to the top and just walk down
S0058	that sound perfect walk down
S0473	it be it's no well you can do it
S0058	i've never think about that before but
S0473	yeah i go i go to and do it and it be erm it be absolutely perfect you you cos you can walk around so little bits of slightly yes but it be generally walk down a hill
S0058	that sound really good
S0473	which of course be tire
S0058	yeah
S0473	because you use muscle you're not use to use go downhill
S0058	yeah
S0473	yeah
S0058	psychologically it's easier
S0473	yeah oh yeah well no it's definitely easier but i think it's it's not just imagine definitely easier
S0058	have it nearly
S0473	okay no it's fantastic
S0058	yeah
