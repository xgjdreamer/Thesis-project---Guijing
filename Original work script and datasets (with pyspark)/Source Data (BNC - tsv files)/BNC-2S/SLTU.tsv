S0179	always make it better
S0058	it be hard work erm you know be er
S0179	it's go
S0058	no no i mean it be erm harder than normal i think and as you say it be at the hardest year and not a lot of people say yeah erm
S0179	and not a lot of people say yeah
S0058	no they do a lot of people do erm
S0179	you actually do say not you say a lot of people
S0058	yeah oh yeah erm so it work quite well i love his er slightly terse response oh
S0179	oh i didn't and it make me feel very bad
S0058	don't feel bad he'll have laugh and then be like i can't see like i say i think he's just very kind of conscious that he want to be a complete professional
S0179	talk about make me feel
S0058	oh i'm really sorry chuck erm yeah
S0179	i'm look forward to that
S0058	well to a certain extent it's generally
S0179	a circuit
S0058	yeah it should be good and er yeah we'll have a chat to when she get here on sunday night and we'll sort of plan the week on sunday night
S0179	so
S0058	no that's the one i couldn't they can't book an induction until she's on the system so and she so she need to go down on the monday night erm he say just call in oh yeah we can go straight from work call in and fill the form in then they can book her in for an induction
S0179	right
S0058	and she can use the gym straightaway kind of thing
S0179	okay well we'll do that well i think if we do the same default then when we'll
S0058	go down later monday
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah so i mean
S0179	kind of first time go down
S0058	yeah so yeah we could either call in straight from work or just come back and just she can just sign up when we go kind of thing but erm yeah it should be good we could try and book in to body pump on tuesday
S0179	on on monday
S0058	okay well i mean
S0058	even if just go though
S0179	yeah yeah or even meet me afterwards
S0058	yeah exactly it work out quite well
S0179	okay erm what else
S0058	i think the think be move out and stay out the way of the
S0179	yeah
S0058	lane
S0179	but but fundamentally
S0058	but then if i could yeah
S0179	it could mean i be go to cause an accident and you don't do it people don't
S0058	well you didn't yeah you didn't really though you kind of stay in the middle so you know obviously just not work it out properly
S0179	well to be fair if i have think a bite more ahead i would have give him more room to do it but on the other hand
S0058	yeah yeah he be definitely in the wrong
S0179	yeah
S0058	a bite of a
S0179	and it's er what be it a peugeot thingamabob
S0058	thing
S0179	a tall thing
S0058	yeah wind catcher i don't know if i tell you erm my grandpa say he's go to get rid of the car he's not go to drive anymore so he's plan what he's go to do with his garage
S0179	do he want to give you the car
S0058	i doubt it i'm not sure i want it as in it's a fairly old automatic ford yeah i should think so
S0179	well bear in mind i be half contemplate that an automatic might be good for you for some drivers
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	just get use to the experience on the road without have to bother to bother you about gear
S0058	yeah and then put them in at the end yeah
S0179	because you you've be trouble with the clutch and it's just your ability to select gear at the appropriate junction be problematic
S0058	yeah
S0179	with an automatic you wouldn't have to worry about that
S0058	yeah and just concentrate on erm what i be do yeah
S0179	you know it's not hold it like that and you're
S0058	sorry
S0179	you've just hurt my eye and it's really distract
S0058	sorry yeah
S0179	point out but it's your job to talk to me
S0058	yeah yeah sorry
S0058	erm i imagine he'll just sell it to one of the er but i don't think it's erm but it a sort of mobility one actually i don't know if he can sell it he's get it through a scheme thing erm because of a grant so he might have to just give it back
S0179	fair enough
S0058	i don't really know how i don't know if he get it free or just very reduce or i don't really know what the deal be but it might just have to go back to them erm because it's not adapt in any way it's just i think it's just a sort of payment scheme thing
S0179	so but he doesn't want at sixty
S0058	er no well i think it's still more than one erm i think he's decide it's maybe er he's past his time drive
S0179	possibly wise
S0058	yeah oh yeah i think it's a sensible er decision but yes i say you know when my mum and dad be talk about it and they say well that's a good thing he's think about the future he's plan he's work out what his life be go to be like which be good you know
S0179	yes
S0058	and it's maybe a and they'll maybe get a bite more help in because i think my dad really have be do quite a lot
S0179	yes
S0058	and i think maybe you know just a little bite of extra help if my grandpa really can't care for my gran and just accept somebody come in and do a bite more for them
S0179	well it's not yeah it's not entirely unreasonable to expect families to do
S0058	no i mean i think my dad's be do it willingly and hasn't mind do it and it's not exactly like it's a problem get there
S0179	try
S0058	it's cool isn't it and those be massive handlebars
S0179	yeah
S0058	erm yeah i don't think my dad have mind do it at all i think it's more just that if he's not particularly well himself erm yeah then we might be able to get somebody in to er
S0179	yes
S0058	help him out
S0179	it's the one member of that family family be still work
S0058	i think my mam really can't er can't do it
S0179	when be she plan on retire
S0058	well she be plan on retire the minute she hit sixty and but there's be no talk of it so presumably she's keep go while things be still kind of
S0179	interest well it probably make it as one member of the household work while they've still get a daughter at uni
S0058	yeah i think that's maybe the think erm
S0179	oh and work and support herself pull her weight i'm just think at leeds you could probably get away with part time job
S0058	yeah you probably could
S0179	again but that would interfere with you know choir and tea drink as in not like a full part time job
S0058	well exactly
S0179	but but you could you could certainly you know fit in i don't know
S0058	a six hour shift on a saturday probably
S0179	yeah or three hours saturday three hours sunday
S0179	yeah exactly it wouldn't kill you
S0058	fit it in
S0179	exactly it wouldn't kill you
S0058	not a lot of money
S0179	but
S0058	depend on what you're do but it would be better than
S0179	well no i mean you can probably get something like about eight if you're lucky ten quid an hour
S0058	yeah
S0179	around ten
S0058	yeah so be it eight quid now probably
S0179	if you be creative so what like it's eight time six and that's er forty eight fifty quid a week you know that's
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0179	that would be that would be below tax you'd actually get all of it but actually it would pay for a lot of that it would pay for all of your
S0058	food
S0179	the vast majority of your your live expense food
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm
S0179	but
S0058	i guess you you know it's that or you can put the kind of the extra hours in to work and sort of go over and above what you need to do
S0179	but she won't be do that
S0058	well
S0179	as in you know i'm perfectly sure that erm if you go over and above without that
S0058	hmm probably
S0179	as in yeah
S0058	er i don't know i don't think it's the worst i think
S0179	no but it's nothing it would not be comparable to oxbridge
S0058	no no
S0179	as herself have tell you
S0058	as in you couldn't yeah well no as in you couldn't even contemplate do six hours week work
S0179	well no any subject could english could objectively
S0058	yeah yeah true as in put more than six hours a week into
S0179	yeah but you'd need to try and fair enough but on the other hand if you could do that much work at cambridge and still be a member of a couple of different societies and still have a social life and you could damn well do all of that and have a job at leeds
S0058	yeah
S0179	if you want to er but it's just the fact that er i don't know it's one fact that there's just never be sort of any inclination but actually she should be support herself
S0058	i mean i don't know i don't know what conversation that they have on
S0058	i don't know whether she say this and my dad say
S0058	there's no way you're get a job
S0179	no but it's the household this be your household there will not have be any conversation
S0058	hmm
S0179	you know that
S0058	in all fairness though be the one who bring the and be the one who bring up the conversations
S0179	not all good conversations
S0058	she usually do she's be pretty
S0179	i wouldn't call them conversations
S0058	well the fact be she be very kind of open about how she be feel all the time
S0179	well no that wasn't bring stuff like that up it be be inappropriate with just inappropriate level of discussion about me that's attention seek not really stuff like that
S0058	but i can imagine her bring that up though
S0179	you know that's something that that's not what i think she like to think about
S0058	no but i can imagine there would be i can imagine her think about that and then talk about it
S0179	i can't i don't think it's ever really occur to her
S0058	well i i disagree i think she it it could well have be bring up and it's just that i'm not involve in the discussion erm
S0179	well no i mean you be fairly involve in the discussion about what to do at uni it be
S0058	well no but i don't there's no reason for me to be involve in the discussion of if if
S0179	i know but
S0058	it have be bring up
S0179	but actually maybe because to some extent it it do affect you because it's a disparity between the support that two daughters have receive and you be one of them and i think that it be appropriate for you to be involve in but what i be actually get at specifically be you know when she be think about move to leeds one of her considerations wasn't well actually if i do this then i'm go to take you know another year to get a worthy degree
S0058	mm
S0179	and actually financially it make more sense to stay at oxford if i can i don't think that occur to her
S0058	what because she'd have start the degree
S0179	yeah exactly erm and likewise it didn't occur to her to get a job in the eight months that she wasn't do anything else which i still can't quite believe i don't understand
S0058	well
S0179	what you could do with that time
S0058	i mean i do tell her to sort of make sure she do something
S0179	but she wasn't even on job seeker's allowance for fuck's sake
S0058	i do tell her to make sure she do something with it and she didn't really and which be such a shame because it be a really good opportunity to get some really good solid even unpaid work just work for that for six months would have be incredible for her cv
S0179	learn a foreign language
S0058	yeah
S0179	learn to drive
S0058	yeah
S0179	you know any number of useful skills you could do in that time
S0058	go travel
S0179	yes that well no because that would cost money
S0058	true yeah
S0179	anything that
S0058	you could probably go and work in another country be what a lot of people would do erm so they get the travel experience but they pay for it entirely with the wag they earn
S0179	yeah
S0058	erm
S0179	but anything just sit on your arse and apart from everything else from a cv perspective that's just chronic
S0058	no i know that's the thing i do say at the begin of it you've get to do something and that's a great opportunity that most people don't have and you really need to use it for something good and excite because of the cv say i spend i take you know i have to take time off uni but i spend it do this great thing and look how much better it's make me rather than i have to take time off uni and i've get a big gap i didn't do anything you know it's not yeah it's such a shame
S0179	yeah
S0058	i mean i didn't particularly do an awful lot after leave uni between get a job but i be
S0179	no you be job hunt fairly intensively
S0058	so i be very intensively yeah i be i be really i really be spend all day do job applications and also i do teach myself proof read which in retrospect be a very good idea
S0179	yeah i mean retrospectively you know possibly could have learn to drive
S0058	i could have no exactly yeah i don't think i make completely good use of it but i wasn't sit around
S0179	well no the thing be you be make use of it and to some extent you'd finish your degree and you'd earn a break
S0058	yeah yeah i i do have really golden summer i wasn't intensively
S0179	right yeah erm that's again you just oh that's quite dangerous
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean i couldn't slow down after i let him in but i mean
S0058	no
S0179	i couldn't move out so he have to stop and he didn't quite twig as in he didn't stop
S0058	no no
S0179	because he come in unexpectedly come in too fast
S0058	yeah not enough time yeah no
S0179	now that be why dual carriageways be so much more dangerous than motorways
S0058	yes
S0179	oh yes good now not have learn that speed be dangerous
S0058	oh there's a sign the guy with a sign for the george inn
S0179	oh
S0058	oh
S0179	maybe it's the same guy
S0058	at least it's a nice day today i suppose
S0179	maybe you know so you know instead of employee of the month they have like a sin bin
S0058	yeah
S0179	worst employee of the last month get
S0058	yeah get the shift
S0179	so you're come off there so we're literally on the four one junction who be you
S0058	yeah that make sense
S0058	four lads england shirt hang in the back
S0058	i don't know i mean it's actually quite weird sort of think think back to all the interview and stuff i do and how just how much better qualify i be now to do things do that make sense so just compare yeah
S0179	one of the you've always do very not fortunate but you do very well as in it'll take you further on you know
S0058	no
S0179	you know liam spend you know over a year
S0058	yeah no entirely
S0179	lot of erm graduate improvement days which i can still think be the worst thing on the face of the planet
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	yeah but how can you work cooperatively in a team of people you be compete against it's a situation it's a skill which be not acquire in
S0058	yes
S0179	because you're work as a team of people who you be work with and you want to the same goal
S0058	yes it's a ridiculous
S0179	this be barmy
S0058	balance to ask you to strike
S0179	in this situation you need to show that you be better than everyone else
S0058	yeah
S0179	and but you be decisive also but you're want to work with people
S0058	yeah it's it's
S0179	you can't achieve that that's almost impossible
S0058	yeah that's er
S0179	a mental dichotomy
S0058	i'm very glad that the things i be go for didn't require that because it's a very odd thing to have to do erm and you find it very hard i think as well
S0179	anyway
S0058	yeah but erm it's kind of good because i'm erm think about be it you know because we're recruit somebody well i'm not but we be the team be recruit somebody for erm for this other job the one year contract erm and i'm go to sit in on erm they've ask the final three to prepare a five minute presentation as like as if they be give a because the the job be about go in to universities and school colleges and persuade people to submit their work
S0179	right
S0058	for the academic and they they basically have to prepare a presentation as if they as if we be a group of science undergraduates erm
S0179	but if you be anything like qualify to do that
S0058	no no it just doesn't matter that's just the the name we've be give as a group we're not go to ask science question but they're go to they have to give us a presentation to explain what the project be and why you know well what we'd have to do erm so i'm go to sit on those on friday but it's i mean that's quite a difficult that's quite involve for the two people who don't get it
S0179	yes
S0058	erm
S0179	i mean that's a year year's contract
S0058	exactly and you know it's get quite a lot of erm recruit time and effort on their part and you sort of feel a bite sorry for the two who just definitely won't get it
S0179	i would just pick one of them if i be you
S0058	what from the first interview to and then pick one of them to give a presentation
S0179	yeah and then if they don't
S0058	if they don't do it then
S0179	like it another one
S0058	yeah i think it might make more sense because i do feel a bite sorry for the people and and you know you could have put a lot of time into prepare that and these people be mostly all work in one capacity or another erm so you've get to give up a lot of your free time but i guess people really want job and it be a prestigious organisation and i feel really bad i get load of people because i'm look at a lot of freelancers and so many people go i'll do anything for you for free because i need to have work for you know they they just want they're throw themselves at me and volunteer to do things and it's just it's insane
S0179	yeah that's a bite weird
S0058	i have somebody ring me up yesterday and she be very sweet but she ring me up a lot and ask me things that she know and then doesn't like she's oh i'll submit the file today and then just hasn't submit them like for the last three days erm but still ring me quite a lot erm and basically say be there go to be any work after the deadline and say well erm i say there be the possibility of further work and i will be contact people who have be involve in this project if and when that that happen you know very diplomatically erm
S0179	but not you
S0058	well that's the thing she hasn't actually submit anything so i don't know what she's go to produce she's erm she send me the this thing that
S0179	what be she do sorry she's transcribe
S0058	she's a recorder
S0179	oh
S0058	so she's just do this but erm
S0179	oh right
S0058	so yeah but she's like take it quite seriously and she's do she's at the and
S0179	
S0058	yeah and
S0179	where be
S0058	near i think
S0179	i didn't even know that be a place let alone a university
S0058	so there's a university there apparently erm and i think it must be quite small
S0179	be it just her
S0058	and she send an advert out in the newsletter ask for people to help with her research which be a little bite dodgy erm i mean
S0179	how do you mean
S0058	cos it's not her research she's be pay to provide record she's not it's not er help out someone with their phd project
S0179	yeah
S0058	you tell somebody you earn money which i'm i'm a little bite gutted with but it do explain under the headline the headline be a bite dodgy but the rest of it be just our advert she explain very clearly what be what be happen so i i mean i don't know exactly what we're go to get and if it's dreadfully kind of pre prepare still i'm go to have to say this isn't good and i don't know how long she's spend sort of do this erm so i really do i've say to her can you you know i really need this stuff
S0179	versus our approach of just
S0058	just converse
S0179	yeah
S0058	but i'm go to feel a bite bad if it's not er you know if it's not very good stuff because she's clearly and you know she say if you know any work i'd be very interest because it's good for my cv to have work with and i think yeah i know but we can't just pay people
S0179	but what we actually produce be actually want as far as i understand just actual conversations
S0058	yeah i mean it's sometimes we we ask for specific things because obviously okay we'd really like some record of teenagers talk about it so we get that but yeah there's normally it's just erm yeah people talk in two thousand and twelve
S0179	erm what be i think of do think about erm
S0058	sorry
S0179	silver directions
S0058	oh right i think you say i think you say and i couldn't work out the connection
S0179	erm so she sort of ideas what she's go to do close to uni yes
S0058	well i don't know i don't know if erm if she's have anymore thoughts or whether she's still because i think that's part of the idea of the work experience that
S0179	yeah yeah
S0058	that she doesn't really know very much about work and so i think
S0179	never have do any obviously
S0058	well i think she's still half think about the teach which will be good
S0179	it's strange she's never be in pay employment in any capacity actually think about it
S0058	mm
S0179	as in sort of even when i be at school and this be me i have a part time job as in i do it like three or four time and i still actually have that experience
S0058	yeah
S0179	and this be sort of me
S0058	i mean i have
S0179	and i be do nothing but work
S0058	i have a little bite of lifeguarding be the only pay employment i'd have
S0179	exactly but you still
S0058	but i i sort it out and make the effort and i'm not sure i actually come out in pocket at all because of the mplq but i make the effort and i really do try to get more it just wasn't you know wasn't to be but i work very hard for those two weeks of however long it i think it be two weeks but yeah i be do you know i do a couple of ten hour shift and the rest they be still pretty much full days you know
S0179	yeah but my point be again that she's literally never earn any money in her life which i find quite actually no she do that
S0058	she
S0179	she do that festival thing
S0058	yeah she do the festival and she do erm she get pay for and she's do open days and stuff that she get pay for
S0179	yeah but that's not really
S0058	no it's certainly different
S0179	that's actually volunteer and you happen to be pay she's never actually be employ by an organisation
S0058	no
S0179	erm
S0058	but
S0179	which be sort of again just a little bite interest
S0058	mm
S0179	but it's possible to have be virtually so she's go to so you start uni and do three years another three years out of that if she's lucky she's go to graduate
S0058	er yes
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	quite weird
S0058	yeah but i mean i be a year ahead and i i be just
S0179	yeah i know but
S0058	which be just natural but yeah then i know what you mean erm
S0179	but the fact that the timescale wasn't essentially deal with
S0058	yeah oh
S0179	er right ring from here now as soon as it's clear
S0058	okay erm can i borrow your i don't have his number
S0179	er i do use to know it by heart and then put it in the phone and didn't erm
S0058	oh right right of course erm

S0179	for lunch
S0058	erm
S0179	bring lunch

S0179	good if we turn up
S0058	and i didn't quite catch it but i think i say you know we'll be there in about half an hour i think he say oh for lunch
S0179	yeah
S0058	but you be talk at the same time so i didn't quite catch but i think he say oh for lunch erm which be good so
S0179	yes
S0058	i'll put that down there in case they text back
S0179	because it's easier than get it back into my pocket
S0058	yeah
S0179	so yes
S0058	yeah erm yeah your mam say again it's best to get there erm you have to get back by half past four if they go out but i think we be go to anyway
S0179	yeah but
S0058	yeah but i mean i don't think we need to be back any you know very much earlier than that but apparently erm yeah it's just if erm and it might not be at half four it might be five because they haven't get a timetable but
S0179	well i have one
S0058	if it's yeah if we if we get back by four that should be fine that should be doable
S0179	yes
S0058	yeah erm but i just think it's interest think about employment and interview and
S0179	yes
S0058	experience and stuff
S0179	like i say we'll see how erm we'll see how she's er cop this week
S0058	yeah i mean i think she'll probably really enjoy it and i mean there's always a question after that of whether you want to do it for your job but i think she'll really enjoy
S0058	no i be think more just yeah have things to do and be in an office and it be quite excite and i really enjoy my work experience there be bore bits but but and i mean the the one thing that i didn't particularly like about be the team weren't particularly nice
S0179	right
S0058	they weren't particularly friendly or welcome or i mean there be one person who be kind of look after me and she be perfectly pleasant but she wasn't very chatty or open
S0179	yeah have essentially a permanent member of staff who
S0058	yeah yeah that's kind of weird erm
S0179	but it be quite a good way to do it because you're not at the somewhere for long enough to feel bad about not pay them someone permanently there
S0058	yeah exactly it do make sense erm
S0179	random quality element to it
S0058	but have say that though i mean i wasn't do anything very critical i be mainly read erm slush which be a difficult there's so much of it even in an idiot would know it be bad
S0179	yes but the point be you could have miss something that be actually good
S0058	yes entirely yeah
S0179	constantly quite a lot
S0058	yes i could have do if they'd take it to a publisher yeah
S0179	so it be actually quite important
S0058	yes i think but i think it i be basically flag up anything that wasn't dreadful erm and i be be you know very careful because everything all of my comment go to somebody else and i wasn't completely reject it out of hand and it be never check i have to write a report on everything i read and sometimes there really wasn't anything to say it be just this be dreadful don't publish it erm this be surely this be a joke i think you know erm but yeah i mean i give quite balance review and say this be quite decent and there be one which really be very good and i think it have be publish else you know in with the country erm
S0179	okay
S0058	yeah so that's why i think it be you know quite a good take a look erm
S0179	be he in another country read another language
S0058	no no i think it's australia
S0179	okay
S0058	or new zealand erm and he'd send it in which like i say i mean it be good you know it be erm it be quite informative so
S0179	oh you're not seriously try to do that be you or be you please don't try to do oh
S0058	oh my god
S0179	you fucktard
S0058	wow
S0179	so what have that gain you
S0058	just incredible there should be a law against drive without a brain
S0179	all that often it's just that people like that they get away with it
S0058	mm
S0179	and they consider themselves good drivers
S0058	yes because they haven't actually kill anyone dear y me mm but yeah erm i think erm the the folk at be a lot more welcome than work at er or whatever so that'll make it better i think
S0179	yes well that's actually because they're not cycle through
S0058	yes exactly
S0058	yeah how be though i think even if i think it be partly that that they be you know obviously which be the thing and also i think they just weren't naturally very warm open kind of people erm because i think if every week i'd still make an effort to to sort of talk to them nobody talk to me
S0179	ah okay
S0058	you know and it really it wasn't a case of you know they they didn't ask me for it wasn't that they didn't ask me for lunch it be like they didn't ask me for lunch because they never speak to me the person who speak to me be the person who i be with but i have to go and ask her a lot of the stuff a lot of the time and she wasn't very forthcoming
S0179	okay
S0058	everyone else i speak to when i be introduce to them or when i have to go and get work from them it be no interaction other than that you know erm it be just very different to how i think it would be even if we have someone someone permanent
S0179	okay
S0058	so you know erm so that would make it better i think and erm yeah it'll be good and everyone's try to think of task that they've get that they cos clare sort of say that she sort of keep you know doesn't just give me bad you know all the dreadful task to do because we've both get a lot to to get on with erm
S0179	and decline to be
S0058	no no she she erm she i don't get copy to do or anything like that people generally do their own erm so but while be there it'll be like here be some file here be some sort that need do
S0058	i think the only thing be we have er like an office pa erm who be very nice call erm and i suppose in theory we could ask her to do admin task erm but she's not kind of officially ours and the point be that we have enough so that we'd be a self contain unit which be sort of not really work at the minute
S0179	well no because you'd be one member of staff might be down and you have twenty five per cent of the
S0058	exactly yeah yeah the idea be that it would be enough people to get all the admin stuff do but also work at yeah full full capacity erm which isn't really the case anymore so i don't know if we could include maybe ask the pas to do something
S0179	anyway talk about
S0058	erm job erm people
S0058	rugby rugby erm i be watch some cookery show and there be like you know sort of get them to the public to share recipes and this woman have one soup but she just dodgy
S0179	yes short answer
S0058	yeah no i don't know this part of the world not even this week
S0179	so what if you
S0058	it be more you know the sort of estate market
S0179	seventies half the cars be volvos ninety per cent of those would be seventies
S0058	wow
S0179	very popular mix of be out there cars
S0058	yeah
S0179	incredible
S0058	but then if you be live in sweden though would you feel the need to buy i don't know like a golf just to be different
S0179	no
S0058	would you be happy with that performance
S0179	well it's not performance it's
S0058	buy the best car
S0179	because they're good
S0058	i guess so yeah
S0179	like the swedes have clearly realise
S0058	the swedes be right
S0058	oh sorry
S0179	but yes they be it's just sort of factual i mean have produce saab but no one have really seem to buy saabs
S0058	that's interest yeah
S0179	which be kind of funny
S0058	saab be shut though aren't they
S0058	saab be shut or they have shut
S0179	month ago yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	well do for the
S0058	i don't follow the car market avidly
S0179	current affairs it would have be in the news fairly prominently
S0058	no i read it in
S0179	only a few dozen of carmakers
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	when one of them shut it's still fairly big news
S0058	well definitely i mean i suppose the problem be if i don't look at the bbc website for a few days because i'm busy at lunchtime i end up miss load of news
S0179	yes
S0058	and as it's fairly large news i love how be mention in our book
S0179	that wasn't me
S0058	the
S0179	oh yeah
S0058	okay i'm wonder how you'll find out what film be on
S0179	paper
S0058	yeah true actually yeah because the whole
S0179	you won't know what what time they're on
S0058	no but it'll give us a better idea and i don't know if there's nothing on anywhere in the country that we fancy see be there
S0179	i mean i have the ipad but the 3g contract and of course you can't get data without it's a bite short sight and they should give you
S0058	it's very short sight
S0179	a full capacity to do that
S0058	yeah the capacity to get on and say you want it because otherwise it's yeah it's limit in its usefulness i think
S0179	yes you might be able to
S0058	mm because who would kind of be that the ipad that's sort of at fault there so i'm not really sure how
S0179	no it's not worth the mobile
S0058	yeah
S0179	because the hardware would connect you to the signal and it's just a question of
S0058	yeah whether they'll let you connect to it no i mean they should and it would be make more sense because you're go to get more business if they let you get on to connect that you connect in order to connect
S0179	i'd assume
S0058	well it's not if you're a trade you can connect to the wi fi in order to log on
S0179	well exactly
S0058	and to pay your money like it seem daft to not have the not be able to do that because it's very keenly
S0179	i think it encourage you to take them out even if you may not need it
S0058	yeah and maybe that's the think yeah sort of erm just think
S0179	up for the day actually just sort of i mean it's also now because it doesn't the credit card detail so you have to re enter them every time
S0058	do it always say
S0179	no
S0058	no
S0058	god i i don't really i don't know how he be talk about all this fancy gadgetry wi fi and i be like can you imagine to put the ipod on the dock oh
S0179	no you can't and that's the thing
S0058	yeah and the answer be no and i be like oh you can't just buy a cheap dock that you can put the ipod on
S0058	speakers
S0179	a service station
S0058	popular
S0179	oh yeah they're very popular there's a there's a wait list
S0058	oh right wow
S0179	they're not actually that expensive either
S0058	oh you're so in love with
S0179	no i'm not objectively i don't want one myself
S0058	well who would want a massive that's quite creepy
S0179	what's creepy be it's fall over
S0058	yeah oh that's really scary
S0179	i mean that's a bite of an issue
S0058	i don't like that that's weird
S0179	you don't like your
S0058	that remind me of the massive marshmallow man in erm ghostbusters
S0179	i've never see that
S0058	i haven't see it either but i've see it's kind of an iconic scene where trample through new york anyway erm yeah i don't you you don't even need a dock and you can get some speakers that'll plug into the top of your ipod like the solutions
S0179	well the ipod have get a speaker in it
S0058	have an ipod
S0179	yeah the touch they've get speakers
S0058	have they so in fact
S0179	yes
S0058	i just can't help think that the options of spend seventy pound spend two hundred pound and i'm like well yes
S0179	or just
S0058	or
S0179	use your exist one and just learn to use it
S0058	yeah just learn to use it if you want to slash buy some speakers
S0179	but no if there's an option to by spend money on it
S0058	yeah yeah yeah
S0179	or just try harder for about five minutes
S0058	yeah i i didn't want to be too obvious you know but i'll just be like why why can i not just why do it need to be wireless surely never mind i don't know if i be miss something critical but yeah
S0179	no just dad
S0058	you really should stop suggest that he buy a laptop your mum be go to get so piss off if he buy a laptop
S0179	i'm i'm kind of tease him
S0058	i know but the thing be he'll get the idea in his head and he'll buy a laptop and your mum will be so annoy
S0179	i've have the idea in my head for age but i do i have actually be in touch with him and we do this when we be at the final stage of when we be just buy a kettle i think
S0058	right
S0179	and you know to buy that specific one which be quite an effort a bite specific one but i'm very please we do because that be by far the nicest one there
S0058	it's very nice
S0179	but you know the issue be that so we be in this erm as i say he be look at laptops in dixons or or whatever comet sorry comet and it be erm dad you don't need a laptop but mum want it to use windows on no she's happy with windows on the imac no but she say no she didn't you be imagine that you just want it so but no one else be use the imac
S0058	no exactly
S0179	stop it
S0058	i don't think he like the idea of her use it sort of wrongly and boot it in windows and i don't think he's massively keen on she do say she doesn't like sit in the chair because it's too low for her varifocals in order to see the screen properly or something like that in that weird chair
S0179	yeah the chair but
S0058	exactly yeah erm yeah all of that your mum want one but she really doesn't she she's not that keen do you think you'd buy a macbook
S0179	i think i'm too old to but it be well they're just nice piece of hardware
S0058	oh that's the thing they're lovely
S0179	and there's no reason that
S0058	yeah that's a permanent thing then
S0179	oh okay
S0058	it's be there the last couple of time we've be down and i think it must just be park there as an advert
S0179	but occasionally move it just so as to
S0058	yeah exactly like erm they occasionally just move it up er cranmer road a bite so bad
S0179	even if one of the colleges be try to get it remove and the ulterior for that be
S0058	oh i'm sure they have
S0179	just be virtually never open
S0058	no well that's the weird thing it's just part of it it have you know both buy things from there but you know it do open but
S0179	no i once buy something for my first year
S0058	yeah i buy a kind of fanta from there and then look at it and it be erm it have a write on it i didn't recognise the alphabet and i and it be a brighter colour orange than i'd see fanta before and i think i'm not sure i should be really very sure what to drink this so i just throw it out ridiculous it just look wrong you know what i mean
S0179	yes
S0058	because like it erm it look a bite like fanta in swaziland which language have chemicals in it which be ban in england erm
S0179	but you drink it there
S0058	i drink it there yeah
S0179	and look what it do to you
S0058	exactly but erm yeah erm what be i go to say
S0179	i don't know
S0058	yeah no i imagine the college have try to get something do about it but presumably they can't so long as it's just park and move up and down
S0179	but i be er oh think of college i be read the financial policy and you know thank to rigorous cost control measure we're actually not do that badly include pay and bonus freeze for staff
S0058	shit
S0179	and i say hah alright that's why the porter must be piss off
S0058	oh dear y me oh
S0179	it's like because we don't think of the college as an employer but of course it be
S0058	it be yeah
S0179	it's kind of a big employer
S0058	yeah exactly
S0179	it must employ fifty people and
S0058	and yeah you've get i mean i guess it's a very odd thing to be on the other side of it and see all these students run around and then know that you're not your pay isn't go to go up this year
S0179	also now that the students be now pay through the nose so
S0058	yes yeah yeah i guess that make it easier
S0179	yeah it be interest and it work out that the full cost of us educate an average cambridge student be about eighteen thousand pound so in reality it's sort of heavens
S0058	yeah exactly you're not pay through the nose but er
S0179	well you be but
S0058	well you be but it's it depend how you look at it really
S0179	well university university be hugely wealthy
S0058	yes
S0179	in itself
S0058	yes i think yeah i mean i think the idea be that the they need to kind of gather large large amount of fund just so that they can afford to teach people which be what they want to do you know people complain about massively wealthy universities but actually you know it's
S0179	well it's just generation that need to
S0058	yeah it need to examine
S0179	essentially the entire thing be give a wage out
S0058	yeah but erm
S0179	but there should be a sort of i mean because there be currently a as it be robin hood tax amongst the colleges but it should be much greater
S0058	yeah i agree i agree
S0179	so it's not because it do this do essentially effect the level of tuition the students get but it's not there be to go in to different colleges to have massive swing and roundabouts space at all
S0058	no no they're not and it's very much apply to the college you like the look of and it doesn't make a difference but it no really do and yeah it's not
S0179	so for example if you're an art student and you don't want a long walk you should apply to
S0058	yes
S0179	if you want to er if you're go to do astronomy at if you're a lesbian apply to you know under no circumstances apply to erm
S0058	well i i think yeah
S0179	apply to
S0058	if you hate social contact apply yeah erm
S0179	if you you know if you want to go to a big ball every year apply to and
S0058	yeah if you want to play rugby with idiots go to
S0179	yeah
S0058	and like it should be make clearer that there's differences and
S0179	some colleges
S0058	in term of financial support in gyms exactly facilities in fact you know book grant and there's no
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	what
S0058	yeah you can get book grant at the colleges
S0179	wow
S0058	which colleges can give their students however much a year towards book you know it's unheard of at
S0179	but we should also make it very clear that if you go into a central college you will spend most of your time live off site
S0058	yes exactly
S0179	and
S0058	there's so many differences
S0179	and you won't get accommodation in the fourth year if you're on a four year course
S0058	yeah
S0179	in which so it's you know massive swing and roundabouts and and but it be you should be tell about this
S0058	i entirely agree yeah it's
S0179	and access doesn't do that because it would actually then it would seem to apply and the college's decision be important
S0058	yeah it be evidently it be but then you need to emphasise you know if it doesn't matter where you apply because if you're good enough you'll get in because of the close system so that's why they they kind of shy away from that and they just pick the one that you think be prettiest
S0179	reduce stress
S0058	and exactly reduce the stress and the amount of and then of course yeah you can't you obviously can't publish if you're a rugby idiot go to they can't say that
S0179	but you you know if you're savvy you'll look at the public school ratios
S0058	yeah erm and you also get to talk to students i think be what you know the the last point like people who be in the know can do that but if you're just from some random state school and you really don't know how to go about it the visual access policy
S0179	it's useless
S0058	it's yeah if it's not helpful in term of get that inside look erm
S0179	but the thing on 's website be useless i mean
S0058	it's ridiculous
S0179	there's a couple of like a couple of like so which college have a decent gym but that useful information
S0058	yeah that's quite a privilege
S0179	but but that's not actually help people none of it have be what it's target at which be help
S0058	no
S0179	disadvantage students get even a more even foot it'd just be
S0058	none of it have be erm i'm apply for english i have no english teacher at my school can you tell me a little bite about what the interview be go to be like so i can compare it's all
S0058	it it's not about that it's be like
S0179	it's just trivia
S0058	yes it's trivia it's a lot of it isn't from people in this country
S0179	yeah which isn't what it's design for
S0058	it's not what it's exactly it's i mean
S0179	when it's badly write and
S0058	and some of it's just for people who think well you don't need to know that
S0179	well i think one be what's the best motorway route from to
S0058	yeah
S0179	and i think i'm access work be so literal
S0058	yeah nice yeah that's just ridiculous that's not
S0179	who give a shit
S0058	it's stupid
S0179	you know look on google apps
S0058	yeah well exactly it's it's not taz's job to field question like that she should be field question like
S0179	more to the point
S0058	erm what can i do about
S0179	she should be make sure she's get question like that and she's not
S0058	no
S0179	she's get question yeah but not the right sort of question
S0058	well with the whole service be be kind of advertise and sort of make available how who know about it you know it's a good service and in principle it's a really good idea
S0179	but if you google i'm sure you would find it
S0058	yeah
S0179	but how many people know to google
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	you know i'm sure she's do lot of initiatives but how many of those be actually do
S0058	they're target the right people i guess because yeah this be just it's stupid it's not if these be serious concern that be affect access
S0179	access be nothing to do with university it be to do with school
S0058	school
S0179	and the education a child receive
S0058	and and the general attitude of the school be critical and some school have a very bad approach and you know they should be go to school and teach headmasters and headmistresses and head teachers sorry and teachers and coordinators and they should be teach the head
S0179	but that's not what we're do and that's
S0058	no
S0179	but but not even that it's be do with school should just be but it's not just but so much of it isn't about that it's about so what gcse choices be you make and what a level choices be you take
S0058	yes yeah don't take these a level that you will not get into with these a level they're no good to you
S0179	that's really weird because that sign
S0058	mm
S0179	the round circle with a red outline mean no vehicular access
S0058	which be wrong
S0179	which be very very bizarre and they really should get that fix
S0058	yeah so it be it's a mistake be it or either one with the fade
S0179	no it it be in the thirties but wear off
S0058	yeah
S0179	but that current technically if you obey that road sign as read you'd stop
S0058	yes you'd stop yeah that's quite bad
S0179	yeah that's what i think
S0058	but no i agree i think erm the the the access be kind of it's so small scale and talk to individual students and i'm not sure
S0179	that's just a piss take
S0058	of you need to change
S0179	yeah it look good but it's do fuck all
S0058	i mean i think yes it might make a difference in if one pupil from a disadvantage school be involve in some kind of access or target scheme and goals and then they go back to their old school and say apply it's for the like of us
S0179	yes but that's different that that's give them but if they're on a scheme like that that that's the job do
S0058	yeah
S0179	they've already think about it
S0058	i guess so yeah
S0179	a bite but that's not the people it should be target
S0058	it's for people who the school have see oh you don't want to go to
S0179	yeah exactly but that again be a very small portion of the problem because fundamentally there isn't a problem and that's why you comment and i think
S0058	well yeah i mean that's the thing
S0179	but actually have
S0058	and i mean the media be really up in arm and it's like well actually
S0179	you know have to be the best est in in the world
S0058	it really do it's incredibly
S0179	it's far better than the american system and the fact that really annoy me be the time be write it so it boost the article about how sort of an applicant at be say that you know the system be much better there and they're much more interest in you as an all round individual rather than just what you can bring to a subject
S0058	mm
S0179	and like that's why i've get two problems with that the first one be you're seriously joke as in you be go to be elite best academic institution in the world and yeah what relevance do that have you can be a sociopath that's fine
S0058	yeah it's an academic institution i agree
S0179	you have the ability to interact with your classmates and your supervisors
S0058	and and your academic context if you can interact in an academic set
S0179	yeah but it doesn't matter
S0058	and that's all that matter surely obviously if you can't interact in an academic set that's different
S0179	yes
S0058	if you be a genius but you can't express it that's no good
S0179	so but you know
S0179	that be that be almost relevant
S0058	yeah
S0179	you know you shouldn't get be a you know if that's just be to relax you
S0058	yes
S0179	there's no other relevance to that the second problem be yeah but it be the question and it be literally ask erm of what's his name erm oceans the guy
S0058	oh
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	be ask on an interview so erm so when i be there actually he be tell someone erm
S0058	i like
S0179	yeah but he be ask at the end of his talk that we have open day
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm er er a guy out of of say erm if i be to donate a million pound to a department would it help my daughter's chance of get an offer he be literally
S0058	wow
S0179	ask that question and the answer be no sir erm
S0058	well yeah my response would have be if you would like to donate a million pound the department we would be extremely grateful it will not have any relevance at all to your daughter's application but please a million pound be great thank very much
S0179	but the thing that be that at harvard that would make a difference
S0058	it would yes that's yes
S0179	that would make a huge difference
S0058	i think that's the problem if you can take
S0179	and the fact that there's a slide scale so if you can pay the interest actually pretty low
S0058	yeah if you can pay you're in and if you can't pay you've get to be quite good
S0179	yeah and it wouldn't
S0058	and that doesn't seem right
S0179	and it's actually say and the bbc be actually say yeah this be a good system what
S0058	yeah
S0179	how possibly and you're judge
S0179	of be elitist
S0058	yeah i'm sorry
S0179	fuck off
S0058	you you know yes there's still a kind of a yeah i mean like we're say there's no point
S0179	there'll always be a higher ratio of people from public school because oddly enough two reason firstly public school be selective secondly intelligent be to some extent inherit
S0058	well i be just go to say that if you've be teach well and properly for your entire school career in small class
S0179	of course you're go
S0058	you're probably more confident and more and and talk better whereas if you really haven't ever be teach properly
S0179	well no just leave that aside assume the standard of teach be the same which it be obviously because people pay on average better they select who they take and that mean people who won't get five gcses don't go that's half the population out of a job already
S0058	yeah exactly whereas state school they have you know they take everyone so people who really yeah aren't go to do very well go to state school
S0179	so if you want to you know the only meaningful comparison would be between as a percentage between grammar school and private school
S0058	yeah
S0179	that would be a meaningful thing and anywhere with selective entry
S0058	because yeah
S0179	rather than you know if this be
S0058	i think selective entry free and selective entry appeal be an interest
S0179	a lot of state school you know be get what two million and in some case as low as twenty per cent of people get five as and a star and cs
S0058	well yeah be about twenty per cent
S0179	yeah so that's an eighty per cent of people who just you know unless
S0058	they can't do it
S0179	see ninety per cent of people who won't do a level
S0058	yeah
S0179	because just to get you get them to a level so if ninety per cent of school be do a level versus at a school where there's no way you would get in unless you be go to get good a level what the fuck do you think be go to happen
S0058	exactly
S0179	and you just you'd just be an incredible ignorance of people and the media play up to people
S0058	well i know but most people think that select people for academic students on the basis of academic ability be elitist
S0179	yes
S0058	an elitism in a negative sense not in a sense of any as in so yeah it's easier if you're pick the england football team right and in order to make it not elitist you decide to pick people who aren't very good at football for the england football team
S0179	yeah
S0058	people don't think about it like this like
S0179	but that's because most people be very stupid
S0058	i think it's because university hasn't be be stop to be synonymous with academia do that make sense
S0179	yes
S0058	there's a there's a yeah there's a disconnection exactly it's a it's a progression so like rather than a an academic i think we very much think of it as an academic
S0179	sorry can i just finish off what i be say back then
S0058	yes
S0179	because the other half of that problem be that people leave aside the genetic intelligence which be an issue as in you know you cannot deny that intelligence be to some extent genetic it's a combination of both upbringing and what you've inherit
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's just
S0058	i agree with that yeah your ability
S0179	as be every other personality character
S0058	yeah i be go to say all everything be genetic like your ability in sport
S0179	exactly and that's fine
S0058	be partially determine by their genes
S0179	but it's unacceptable to say that you know
S0058	yeah but you can't say
S0179	both parent have get an iq of point six you're not go to produce a child who be but it's just not go to happen erm
S0058	but mind you with genetics
S0179	no it won't it's almost i'd say that's pretty much an impossibility er and right he have open the gate however
S0058	excellent oh i'm go to have to pause this rant
S0179	that's fine but yeah the issue of course be that be that erm quite apart from the genetic issue people middle class parent who have achieve as a result of their own education value education and they want their child to go to school school be a beneficial exercise
S0058	if your parent don't want you to go to school you're probably not go to go to cambridge be you
S0179	well no if you if you don't value education you won't accept it and that's another problem with the whole system be that you can't force an education on someone you can give them the opportunity but if they don't achieve not in term of well a significant proportion of the time it will be down to them not accept it and you can't do anything about that well i've see some fairly non academic people achieve a lot for them and on the other hand i've see people who probably be reasonably intelligent not give a shit and so part be the government's fault no i'm sorry you do just people won't you know if you grow up in a council estate and neither your parent will work you will not achieve in life and that's not the government's fault that's you should have
S0058	well i think you can i think the problem be i think you can achieve in life if you're in that situation
S0179	i'll tell you why
S0058	if if you then refuse to take part in anything that's a different matter but i don't think it's a case of say you won't so i'm not go to bother to teach
S0179	yeah but you can't you no no exactly and they don't
S0058	i think it's it's you say okay both parent be from a council estate and it's pointless spend money on your own education because you're not go to achieve anything and that's obviously
S0179	well no but that's not what's do
S0058	no
S0179	by anyone
