S0475	that's alright it's not too hot mm wonderful yum yums erm the er but the er you see you just know that that's a little clever boy who's just go about things differently
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm you know but it doesn't mean to say that you won't actually get to do things normally but in a different way if you see what i mean
S0417	yeah
S0475	but erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	mm erm i mean he know his number for instance so when he go to school he'll just
S0417	yeah
S0475	he'll he'll just know his number
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and er and the er he might be sort of bore at that sort of stage but er not really cos he love number
S0417	yeah he's actually still
S0475	mm
S0417	not bore with
S0475	mm
S0417	go through any
S0475	yeah
S0417	number of the
S0475	mm
S0417	he'll still go through the alphabet in a way that i think surely now like a year on he's be go
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	through the alphabet for at least a year and he's do it for a year but he still like it
S0475	yes yes he love it he absolutely love it yes
S0417	and he'll go
S0475	mm
S0417	go through and say there's one thing that do my head in a little bite so i don't watch it but it's a er and then it go ant but er and it's get this annoy music
S0475	mm
S0417	but he'll still he'll be rivet to that in a way that
S0417	he won't if there's a danger mouse or something
S0475	mm right yeah
S0417	or or like a story on the tv that he doesn't know before where he just just won't be interest
S0475	that's right that's right
S0417	like and go through it again
S0475	yeah yeah yeah
S0417	the alphabet again
S0475	mm yeah
S0417	there's er the other group this well mostly american
S0475	mm
S0417	er that i've see as well and they call do i tell you they call it they've get a name for it but it's not actually an official name for things similar to
S0475	and what do
S0417	they call it hyper hyperlexia
S0475	oh
S0417	er it's like or say the einstein syndrome or whatever
S0475	right right
S0417	kid who er speak
S0417	quite late but read and be be really obsess
S0475	mm
S0417	by number and letter
S0475	mm
S0417	like him
S0475	mm
S0475	er i think er and there be that little bite in him you can i mean people actually sort of think oh little genius or
S0417	yeah but they're not
S0475	er
S0417	it's not that there's a couple of things in there that be a little bite helpful but they're
S0475	mm
S0417	there's er bits in there about how people be cop with school or later on
S0475	right yeah
S0417	because that's what i find most interest that how some of them be say that they be have real problems with the school because they be erm label them as erm like lazy or all sort of other things because they be do stuff that
S0475	yeah
S0417	they already know or
S0475	mm mm mm
S0417	they would gaze out the window or they're one of them have their kid chuck out because they didn't or but then
S0475	mm
S0417	other kid have say their school other people have say they've say nothing to the school and that they've pick up on it and they've be fine and other people have say
S0475	mm mm
S0417	that they've say something and they think they be a precocious parent who be like pick up their so there's interest but there's not
S0475	mm
S0417	like a really
S0475	normal school deal with normality
S0417	yeah
S0475	mm and if you get as there be quite a few of them around erm teachers who actually go with the kid you know
S0417	mm
S0475	who can actually especially in the infant bite
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm who can go with how how how they be learn how they be do it erm what they can't really cope with be children who be too destructive in class
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but erm they because you can't really you can't stop everything erm there's get to be a certain conformity erm like
S0417	yeah be probably more destructive
S0475	mm
S0417	but we haven't talk about school yet but i don't well one day cos even the preschool would start probably bring in if it be if it be the irish speak school he's the other school aren't very aren't that great
S0475	right
S0417	so everybody send their kid to the irish and they and they do it from the word go
S0475	right right
S0417	speak irish i think he might only just be okay about talk and talk isn't his strong point
S0475	mm
S0417	and if he have to learn that all again
S0475	so would be go to an irish speak school
S0417	yeah
S0475	right right erm er how how do you sort of feel about
S0417	well i think
S0475	for for you know
S0417	yeah for
S0475	mm
S0417	i'm not sure that that would be that great for but i don't think the english speak school would be
S0475	mm
S0417	as good because they're not they will everyone send their kid all the bright kid end up go to the irish speak school all the
S0475	right
S0417	best teachers go there all the best
S0475	yeah
S0417	kind of
S0475	yeah
S0417	but they erm i also think it's not great for the kid who be good at erm sciences or not like in you know for kid more the language side and i think he's more the maths and science side anyway
S0475	yes mm
S0417	he will will be i think
S0475	mm
S0417	possibly and then all the textbooks be erm be in irish and they're not not as good i don't think as the other ones
S0475	right
S0417	erm especially the science ones erm but the the other the only other options be there aren't any other options around really that so i don't know i really don't know
S0475	it be a hard one that
S0417	it be a it's a hard one
S0475	it be a hard one because erm certainly at the infant stage erm erm he wouldn't be learn to read in english you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	he'd be learn to read in irish
S0417	yeah
S0475	so it's it's it's because mm and if he be er in anywhere in britain
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm the erm say oh well at infant stage as long as it's a kindly school and it's not too
S0417	yeah
S0475	bad erm you can go to it because erm the child will pick up stuff
S0417	mm
S0475	erm the er but when they're actually learn to read in irish that's a bite more difficult
S0417	yeah
S0475	because erm later on they'll get english lessons but i mean
S0417	yeah
S0475	do do erm for instance 's girls can they read in english
S0417	yeah but you see er i don't think it do many favour
S0475	right
S0417	i think have difficulties and she wasn't actually read until she be seven or eight
S0475	right
S0417	and she get refer to a specialist erm
S0475	be that read in irish or it's just read
S0417	just read generally
S0475	mm right yeah
S0417	and when she read at home she read in english book and that kind of thing so i think
S0475	uhu
S0417	if you've get some if you've get something that's erm mm not as easy for you er communicate or whatever in different ways
S0475	yes yeah
S0417	then erm have to learn another language on top of it be i dunno it's pretty difficult
S0475	so would the non irish school in which be not maybe very good at the infant level be okay
S0417	but then he would wouldn't be able to you can't
S0475	you can't transfer
S0417	transfer because erm they they would all be
S0475	mm
S0417	speak fluent gaelic in and everything be
S0475	mm
S0417	once you go in there they say hello in in irish everything you have to do in irish
S0475	right right
S0417	and once you're behind that's it you can't join again
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	and the the other stream just aren't aren't as great even with even though i be definitely consider him to go to the school here
S0475	yeah
S0417	but it be the english side but because you've get no other kid who be erm or very few other kid who er er who be academic really it's it's erm it's nobody really talk about this but it's all anyone who's
S0475	mm
S0417	get parent who be in any way bright or academic
S0475	mm
S0417	they they'll if they've get a good gaelic school they they all send them there so they the other lessons though they've get to cater for the majority of the class haven't you so
S0475	yeah of course of course and er
S0417	so then he'll be relegate to class where
S0475	yeah
S0417	if he's a bright boy that'll be they would just won't be
S0475	mm
S0417	push him at all
S0475	mm
S0417	for a long time i mean that that will be quite hard for him too and also just your mat and that kind of thing your mat be more the ones they love the you know they have the muck around or the
S0475	you know to talk to them
S0417	sporty things
S0475	but do they
S0417	yeah
S0475	talk in the playground in english
S0417	erm
S0475	i mean erm or don't you know er
S0417	they the the side don't meet anyway they they don't hang around with each other
S0475	no but but i mean all all
S0417	yeah they talk they talk they often talk in irish in the
S0475	oh right right
S0417	playgrounds not all the time they don't have to but oh
S0475	cos
S0417	i'm not sure actually
S0475	cos when they go
S0417	maybe they would do
S0475	when they go to school most of them won't speak irish will they
S0417	when they first go to school yeah so they'll i mean when they first go they're that first year or so
S0475	mm that's right you be prim for a a sort of reception class that er
S0417	yeah
S0475	er
S0417	i think there's a year or so with er erm they get if you where they're there's some kind of i i i don't know exactly how they do it whether there's some some
S0475	mm
S0417	more in english like some
S0475	mm mm
S0417	instructions in english but they really quickly sort of just go into the irish
S0475	mm and
S0417	yeah
S0475	i mean you
S0417	i don't know
S0475	you didn't come you didn't meet who's the youngest one until she be what ten
S0417	no she be nine in
S0475	eleven right nine
S0417	yeah
S0475	so but when she and her friends talk together
S0417	mm
S0475	do you ever see her friends talk do they talk in english do her and her sister speak english to each other
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm the
S0417	when they're home but erm in school they usually talk irish i think
S0475	erm
S0417	but i'm not sure about lunchtimes
S0475	erm cos erm er i'm just try to get get a feel of what the kind of social setup be in irish school do they
S0417	they'll often the think they're encourage to speak irish as much as possible everywhere
S0475	right right right
S0417	and that's why they you know partly keep like the side separate they have separate lunch areas the irish speak side
S0475	okay
S0417	and the english
S0475	right
S0417	areas
S0475	right right
S0417	yeah yeah so it won't be if he if he be if he be just a sort of general child then
S0475	mm
S0417	the i'd definitely want to send him to the irish speak school i actually i wouldn't really be happy with him go to the the english speak school
S0475	right right right
S0417	really i'd rather i'd rather him go into town and go to 's old school
S0475	right which be an english speak school
S0417	yeah
S0475	yeah yeah mm
S0417	yeah i mean the teachers be generally kind of okay that kind of thing but
S0475	yeah
S0417	it's not not as good as i'd hope
S0475	i mean i just know nothing about
S0417	yeah
S0475	the setup so erm i've get no nothing to sort of hang anything er say usefully
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know on but er
S0417	it's a shame as well because they don't teach science very erm they don't teach science in primary school hardly at all
S0475	no no
S0417	either which be a real shame but kid like him i think that's what he'd that's what he'd revel in
S0475	right right
S0417	i suppose they do maths and things but
S0475	be at an irish speak school
S0417	no he didn't he erm at that time it be different here and they didn't have the irish speak school er and i don't think
S0475	erm cos i think
S0417	it's new thing
S0475	erm the it's like welsh school it's you know the erm there be certain countries who think oh wait a minute
S0417	mm
S0475	we want our language to survive we want our
S0417	yeah
S0475	language to become more live
S0417	yeah
S0475	and it be a fairly in the last say twenty fifteen twenty years i don't i i'm just guess
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm so people before that erm er cos from when my granny be erm erm at school i mean she talk gaelic at home
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but as soon as they go to school they have to learn english
S0417	yeah
S0475	and er cos all the school be teach in english
S0417	yeah
S0475	and erm so that be that
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm erm
S0417	yeah yeah hat the way he be teach irish actually he really didn't like it
S0475	right right
S0417	i think he sort of resent quite a lot of time he be
S0475	yeah
S0417	he be teach irish erm but you know he er i know he like be the fact that his girls have go to the irish speak school not not really because it be it's irish speak but because it's the best school
S0475	right
S0417	and there's er
S0475	mm
S0417	that's what i've notice more than anything in ireland since i've move here be that everyone i work within research they all send all their kid to irish speak school because they be academics and
S0475	right
S0417	everyone do and people note that i think as well if you go on erm the university and things
S0475	yes like like erm like in scotland you could tell whether it be a catholic school of a protestant school
S0417	yeah
S0475	in erm so erm but just by because you know the school so that you
S0417	yeah
S0475	know if it's an irish speak school or a non irish speak school
S0417	yeah
S0475	and because arrive speak english at erm kind of junior level
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm they you have to send him to a an english speak school you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	but erm erm and there again you probably will be you fairly near it
S0417	i be
S0475	erm
S0417	i be
S0475	when you be
S0417	at the time
S0475	when you first come over
S0417	yeah i be
S0475	erm
S0417	at the time
S0475	erm
S0417	to his school yeah
S0417	yeah erm
S0475	yeah no very near that school
S0475	erm
S0417	cos we both live there and it be it be know to be a good school as well
S0475	yeah
S0417	so i know before i move here cos i'd phone up and they say they'd accept him and i know that there be a good school
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	and i know that erm the and then when i move here i didn't change in part because of that cos it be a good school
S0475	mm yeah
S0417	and cos it be
S0475	mm
S0417	erm he'd've have to go to the english school here
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	mm
S0475	mm
S0417	i just
S0475	but er it it i mean er i think nowadays erm it's very hard for for parent that erm cos you don't just go to this next door school you know er
S0417	yeah
S0475	and and in england you can't do it er you in a way you can't do it either erm
S0417	it's get more competitive here actually as well
S0475	mm
S0417	erm that the to the gaelic speak school there's a wait list now i mean i should've
S0475	mm
S0417	have his name down when he be one or something and i haven't get his name down yet
S0417	erm there's
S0475	yeah
S0417	a really long wait list for it it's no so it's get to that point where i think that everybody's try to get into the best school and
S0475	right right
S0417	i think though some a couple of people not many but a couple of people have go to like all boys' school after their primary that have be english speak
S0475	right
S0417	that be the erm the remnants of sort of the older days of of er the best catholic school
S0475	yes mm
S0417	and one of them be the one that i that you pay for even though it's not
S0475	yeah
S0417	actually not very much money really
S0475	yeah
S0417	compare to ours i think it's one or two thousand euros a year which be
S0475	right mm
S0417	like about eight hundred quid a year
S0475	right right
S0417	and everything else subsidise actually
S0475	mm
S0417	that much
S0475	how do how do feel or doesn't he just he hasn't sort of get his
S0417	yeah we haven't talk about it yet
S0475	head round it
S0417	i think er i think he'd like him to go to the the irish speak school
S0475	mm
S0417	but erm that's one of the reason why i get this assessment do it'd be quite good to
S0475	mm
S0417	talk to other people and see what they think actually
S0475	yeah
S0417	about somebody
S0475	mm
S0417	like him and how he'd be erm you know i'd probably need to keep an eye on him if he do i've get no problems with him learn irish i just think it's a i just think it's a shame the the way that they do it especially if they're science mind
S0475	yeah
S0417	kid
S0475	yeah
S0417	i think i think it's when they i think the universities offer really good science course with erm the up to them
S0475	yeah
S0417	the school aren't always that
S0475	but not many i might be wrong but i don't think many erm primary school do a lot of science they do quite a lot of
S0417	mm
S0475	erm like
S0475	they do do some science in the uk
S0475	right
S0417	erm but erm i know it's not load but they do
S0475	mm right
S0417	they they introduce them all like for a few years
S0475	yeah
S0417	and they give there's opportunities i think more opportunities more for people to do they they're bring that in more and more actually in the uk and i think they're just realise that they need
S0475	they need scientists
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but erm and where a country decide they want need so many then suddenly everything's sort of like rush through almost you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	and erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but certainly in the erm the secondary school i mean it's erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	like er because erm i mean it's just my gut feel be that the nearer a school be to where you live especially in the early years like he's gotta learn a whole new language
S0417	the trouble be as well
S0475	mm
S0417	there be an irish school use to be round the corner when cos when
S0475	mm
S0417	's kid go there like
S0475	mm
S0417	part of the reason probably here
S0475	mm
S0417	it's part of the reason
S0475	mm
S0417	there's quite a nice here but then
S0475	mm
S0417	the school move
S0475	oh no
S0417	and the school be actually it's quite a long way so it be really
S0475	really
S0417	like sort of too long to walk actually
S0475	right right right
S0417	which be really annoy
S0475	but er but er
S0417	even though it say in
S0475	mm
S0417	it's right over the other side and it's actually the way i'd have to go
S0475	but would it be easier to get to school in then would it be easier to get to a school in
S0417	possibly but then erm er then i think for at least a couple of years they only go half days
S0475	that's right that's right
S0417	it's quite you know it's
S0475	mm
S0417	a bite of a bind really
S0475	it's er it's it's a it's a very it's it it get terribly complicate doesn't it
S0417	yeah
S0475	mm
S0417	yeah it be get a bite tricky yeah cos the actually where they put the school be right on the back road which you have to go right the way in i'd have to go right the way into town and then out again cos the back road's just
S0475	mm
S0417	down there
S0475	mm
S0417	i could but the path stop so i wouldn't actually even be able to walk cos it's country lanes for
S0475	right yeah
S0417	cos that be that would make it
S0475	mm
S0417	it's a still a long walk but walk but i can't do
S0475	and you you you can't you can't actually sort of keep push him to school when he's seven
S0417	no
S0475	er do do you know what i mean that erm i mean he have to er you either get a bus a car or you
S0417	mm mm
S0475	walk you know
S0417	also 's move
S0475	mm
S0417	she's move into town i'm sure that's part of it because she can just
S0475	mm
S0417	take the kid to it's probably even with
S0475	mm
S0417	even though she's nearer
S0475	right mm
S0417	cos so it's like she's about twenty minutes nearer than i be but erm
S0475	mm
S0417	yeah possibly for her now 's start pre school she's maybe feel it cos even if she's get a car who want to be in and out of a car like twice a day i don't know it's just a bite much isn't it
S0475	that's right that's right mm yeah
S0417	erm
S0475	erm
S0417	yeah i'll have to have to think about those things
S0475	er but be but but i mean that's why as i say would it be easier for you to go to a school in cos yes you've get a bite of a walk to
S0417	yeah
S0475	the the bus
S0417	mm
S0475	but then it take you into which be
S0417	yeah
S0475	quite a bite place but er
S0417	yeah
S0475	mm
S0417	possibly but then i suppose that's it's do feel like a big decision because erm
S0475	mm
S0417	he would the future that the go through would then be cut off cos once he doesn't go to an irish speak school
S0475	yeah yeah yeah erm
S0417	i mean they might be able to squeeze him in after a year or two but that
S0475	mm
S0417	that that would be it the cut off
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	that's not really fair on the kid
S0475	yeah
S0417	after that
S0475	but how would you get him to the irish school for instance
S0417	i've no idea actually
S0417	i don't know
S0417	i mean cos
S0475	mm
S0417	even when would just be hasn't even get enough room in the car it's
S0475	yes
S0417	erm cos definitely be
S0475	but you'd have to bring him back only half a day
S0417	yeah
S0475	can't actually use his lunch hour to come back here
S0417	i know
S0475	and take him back you know
S0417	and there's
S0475	erm
S0417	like you know
S0475	erm i mean this be very it's terribly complicate
S0417	yeah i i don't wanna know
S0475	and there aren't any easy answer
S0417	no
S0475	mm
S0417	i mean even if i like get on like with a house on fire with i don't even think she would
S0417	probably do it it's not the kind of er
S0417	but you know even that option
S0475	mm
S0417	so i don't i don't know
S0475	but she's not live here anyway she's
S0417	well she'd be live in town the village
S0475	oh she's
S0417	oh she's not live here so
S0475	oh oh she's not go and live in
S0417	no
S0475	i mean if she move to
S0417	oh yes
S0475	be she go to be
S0417	yeah she's still live in it's just she's right er next to the school
S0475	oh right right right
S0417	she's gonna move into the school
S0475	mm mm
S0417	the the irish speak one in
S0475	mm mm right
S0417	but just into the village
S0475	right erm
S0417	which make it a lot easier for the school
S0475	yeah erm
S0417	cos then it's the it'll it will be walkable then for her
S0475	right yeah
S0417	but at the minute it's not really walkable even for her
S0475	right right
S0417	because even though well we're just on the other side of the
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	the village be quite long isn't it
S0475	mm
S0417	it's a couple of miles
S0475	it be it's erm terribly complicate
S0417	i be just kind of er
S0417	i suppose it rely on most mums have a car and a home and they i dunno even though
S0475	how do they and it's not a a the best of things
S0417	yeah
S0475	er but how how how do they erm go for homeschooling here
S0417	erm i don't know actually probably like erm in the uk they might they but then i'd also have to think about well will he end up really
S0475	whether you
S0417	antisocial
S0475	you actually want to spend the next
S0417	yeah
S0475	five to eighteen okay however many years be that thirteen years
S0417	mm
S0475	be a teacher
S0417	yeah
S0475	to one and it's not so good for the child because it mean that you're not with your peer group
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and erm
S0417	yeah it's a shame though shame this school's not round the corner and it's not
S0475	mm
S0417	the good english speak school and then there would be no
S0417	problem if it be in the last you know
S0475	yeah yeah that's right
S0417	and actually it would be really nice and kind of
S0475	erm
S0417	take him
S0475	mm
S0417	for that
S0475	yeah
S0417	walk
S0475	yeah
S0417	and everything
S0475	yeah
S0417	erm
S0475	erm erm
S0417	yeah but i i have read in the uk that there's there's be an increase in home school in
S0475	yeah
S0417	but it's probably the same here i wouldn't mind in a way but i'd then i'd i'd need to take him to other things and do the social part of him it be weird sometimes when i think they it's so few hours every day in the irish system you think
S0475	mm
S0417	be it worth it he's go in have to learn another language probably have to go through number and things that he's
S0475	mm
S0417	already do
S0475	mm mm well he'll have to learn the irish for the number he won't be do one two three
S0417	yeah that's right yeah
S0475	yeah it's all different
S0417	that's true isn't it and everything will be read
S0475	and he'll only be two years older than he be now
S0417	yeah i know
S0475	yeah erm
S0417	that's what that after the assessment actually
S0475	mm
S0417	one of the women look at me and say oh cos we
S0475	mm
S0417	talk about do do the test
S0475	mm
S0417	and 's like oh yeah you know it be who'd er kind of ask for the test
S0417	erm and look at me and say oh yes you'll you'll be think of school won't you i go yeah
S0417	oh yeah and that's what i've be do now just
S0475	mm yeah but it's
S0417	not that god know what it might come back with nothing but
S0475	but it be it's it's you know you're you're in a a difficult situation here really
S0417	yeah i know
S0475	erm
S0417	it's funny cos this house be really lovely and and would not
S0475	mm
S0417	dunno if he'd be able to move he probably wouldn't want to er
S0475	mm
S0417	sort of and it's i love the quietness and there's erm you know he still want his girls to come round so in some ways it's lovely that it's big to kind of cope with that and he like his space but erm er everything else be quite awkward
S0475	well it's
S0417	the day to my day to day things be quite awkward
S0475	the only other thing er would be erm be two taxis
S0417	mm but even when he's so young cos like would take
S0475	no no you would have to go
S0417	oh me in
S0475	in the taxi with him
S0417	oh yeah
S0475	hang around at whichever neck of the woods at or walk the way back or
S0417	see you could probably drop him off
S0475	mm
S0417	in the morning at some somewhere or other but erm
S0475	but not if he's get to be at the other end at nine o'clock school time
S0417	yeah
S0475	or be they all
S0417	see
S0475	near each other
S0417	yeah they've see need to be in quite early
S0475	yeah
S0417	so he probably wouldn't be start that early
S0475	mm
S0417	yeah so i'd need to go with him and hang around probably
S0475	that's right
S0417	and then there'd be no room for mind you they're nearer everything nearer a bus stop or old enough so
S0475	that's right
S0417	that we would have to take priority really
S0475	i mean er would would no no would have to take priority
S0417	yeah sorry yeah yeah
S0475	do do you know what i mean that that
S0417	yeah
S0475	cos he be 's child
S0417	yeah
S0475	right it's not as if
S0417	yeah
S0475	it's just your child
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	so to get to get say say to the irish school right
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm he'd have to sort of say sorry i can't university
S0417	oh yeah i mean would be the first one to go i would have think
S0475	yeah yeah and in two years' time
S0417	and her mum you know her mum's get a car and she actually go in the same way
S0417	at least some of the days at some point
S0475	right yeah
S0417	and she's
S0417	old enough to have a please don't do that no cos you make too loud a noise erm you know but the other the other girls might have to go
S0475	but it be i mean i know it's difficult for you
S0475	you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	it it be difficult
S0417	yeah
S0475	it be difficult because the only other solution as i say be if or erm shell out for a taxi twice a day and i don't know what you do in the middle but you'd have to
S0417	yeah
S0475	do something else in the middle
S0417	yeah
S0417	yeah
S0475	mm but er erm
S0417	mm
S0475	especially if they be only half a day
S0417	yeah that's the thing they're only half a day
S0475	erm
S0417	yeah preschool's a bite like that as well preschool's only a year away
S0475	yeah
S0417	and it like he might need more adjust time to adjust than other kid so probably need to think about these things i don't know i think that's probably why we're both just not talk about it
S0475	yes er
S0417	we've get so many other things and
S0475	yeah yeah yeah
S0417	but that's part of the thing er you know just say the other people with their their own that
S0475	yeah and do you i mean this be not mean to be a a load question
S0417	yeah it's okay
S0475	although it be fairly load
S0417	yeah
S0475	but erm but how be you how do you feel about live live here
S0417	mm
S0475	be you erm be it okay just now or be it do you see yourself here right through 's school er be there anything in
S0417	as in this
S0475	in your that sort of
S0417	this area or in in general or
S0475	well with for
S0417	with
S0475	really yes
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm well you don't have to answer that question
S0417	yeah no i don't i'm not i'm not comfortable enough though to say er it's it's all
S0475	mm
S0417	it's all fine i can you know i can see it all work out fine in the future
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	there's
S0475	yeah
S0417	there be question mark about whether erm whether it would be right for me in ten years' still to be here around the corner from his
S0417	ex wife and kind of erm er in the place that's more tricky for me to find work and
S0475	that's right
S0417	not quite so erm easy for other things and you know also be always gonna be work hard as well so he'll be out during the day
S0475	yeah
S0417	and there will be and then i don't know what kind of other choices might make in the future but yeah it's not erm you know i i it's not clear really
S0475	right right so
S0417	even though erm 's very erm you know 's a very good partner in all sort of ways too but there be there be definitely a lot of erm adjustments it's be quite tough
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	as well and that's that's that have get er things have get better and easier all the time but i still have to oh yeah sometimes i do daydream and think oh it would be so nice just to be in a city in the uk
S0417	where
S0475	mm
S0417	erm i mean if ideally i suppose i'd love us all to be me and to be in a city in the uk which be easy that i could just see it have everything for us in the future i don't think he's quite immovable really and that's understandable
S0475	yeah
S0417	you know
S0475	but i be
S0417	erm
S0475	erm
S0417	i don't know
S0475	then the other thing to put in your head be how do you think it would be erm if for instance
S0417	yeah
S0475	you bring both and back to
S0417	mm
S0475	at school time right
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm or thereabouts and every holiday and half term you go home
S0417	mm yeah
S0475	i mean would that be could you see that be workable for you and
S0417	yeah
S0475	or not erm
S0417	yeah i don't know i think i think would find that really hard cos i think he's
S0475	mm
S0417	he's not he's not flexible like that
S0475	yeah
S0417	and he's erm
S0475	and he'd be on his own for a good few weeks at a time
S0417	yeah he's not very good
S0475	mm
S0417	on his own erm
S0475	mm
S0417	but i don't know i think there's erm sometimes i do think er er it's i don't know
S0475	mm erm
S0417	i suppose it's hard because it's er the difficulties with the way erm some things you can't just ignore you've get to try and adjust them somehow
S0475	yeah
S0417	and if i'm
S0475	mm
S0417	i think in a way me and erm fit fit ourselves into his
S0475	yeah
S0417	life
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	and lot of things don't work for us because they're not how we'd set things up
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	and some of that erm but then we've gain other things as well
S0475	yes of course of course
S0417	which be which be really
S0475	and you've get to
S0417	and one of them be
S0475	weigh up the pluses and the minuses
S0417	yeah
S0475	it be like when i go it be
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm with his it wasn't all pluses
S0417	yeah
S0475	but the pluses outweigh the minuses
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and erm er so on the whole that be better than have stay in
S0417	yeah
S0475	on my own
S0417	yeah
S0475	which would have be much much worse because i wasn't i wouldn't really really erm
S0417	yeah and have a
S0475	mm
S0417	kind of have a a partner be you know really
S0475	oh
S0417	that's a really big one
S0475	oh and it stabilise you
S0417	but it's yeah but also
S0475	erm mm
S0417	be able to live happily with a father of kid as well with and
S0475	mm mm
S0475	that's right
S0417	those be also two big things
S0475	yeah mm
S0417	but then to completely if i just stay here and do nothing and without think about things without consciously
S0475	erm mm
S0417	decide okay i'll
S0475	mm
S0417	you know i will
S0475	mm
S0417	just try and do this and that
S0475	mm
S0417	then then it be me just erm erm fit in everything because 's work be easy enough for him like down the road
S0475	that's right he
S0417	and come back
S0475	yeah that's right
S0417	and he's quite happy with it
S0475	mm
S0417	and his mum be round the corner
S0475	mm
S0417	and his other kid be there so
S0475	that's right mm
S0417	it's okay for him
S0475	yeah
S0417	erm but it's not it it might you know the i mean i know with for example and erm er what's his name
S0475	yeah
S0417	i think she say a couple of time that she think it could have work more if she be there with her people and her support even though
S0475	yeah
S0417	she's loathe to move now from cos she
S0475	yeah she that's right that's right that's right
S0417	like it so much she love the sea and everything
S0475	she's and obviously mum not move back to with when her two kid two of her kid be in but er
S0417	yeah even though
S0475	but er
S0417	i think if stay and have kid i think she might be tempt but
S0475	yeah
S0417	even then she might not it might be too hard for her cos
S0475	mm mm
S0417	er er past a certain stage i think that sometimes it's hard
S0475	you can't do it you can't do it you're too
S0417	yeah
S0475	i mean i dream of go back to scotland at one point
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but now
S0417	yeah
S0475	i mean now yes not now but i mean i just know i couldn't
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm
S0417	and sometimes you can just adjust i mean
S0475	mm
S0417	sometimes i felt a bite like cos still have to do this big long journey there and back and it's quite
S0475	that's right
S0417	tricky as well
S0475	mm
S0417	erm but this year because he's have this er a couple of friends and one of them live down the road from here
S0475	yeah mm
S0417	sometimes
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	we we do go in for his rugby so it's all the way there
S0475	mm
S0417	but then
S0475	mm
S0417	the
S0475	mm mm
S0417	gymnastics be here so erm he's get more and more out of it but sometimes i think you know maybe for him it might be nice just to have things a bite
S0475	mm
S0417	easier for him during the day and be this er be this be this okay for him be this a compromise too far for him and
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	or even with the girls i think you now we put a lot a lot of effort in there over
S0475	mm
S0417	the years and even though we've have some nice time all together
S0475	yeah mm
S0417	i also think oh i invest quite a lot in people who don't actually really the i don't think there's any future there there's no there's there will be nothing come back or or
S0475	mm
S0417	maybe i'm wrong maybe maybe one of the girls will grow into an adult and get be erm start to bond with us or something
S0475	mm
S0417	but i think it's probably doubtful it will probably they'll be so so there's all of that as well which be
S0475	yeah
S0417	things i mean i respect erm as well as but as far as me and be concern even when i watch play with him i think yeah but they they're not
S0475	yeah
S0417	necessarily go to be the people who will care about him
S0475	yeah
S0417	throughout his life
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	so be erm be us you know us be here near them be not necessarily something that's great for us ultimately
S0475	yeah yeah yeah
S0417	you know i know that that we've get to think about the whole family
S0475	yeah
S0417	too so i don't know i mean sometimes i feel or i've even contemplate erm move back for a year or something and just erm just er cos even for it might he'd get probably as much out i mean it would be disruptive for him
S0475	mm
S0417	but it's er i think it be worth it's worth think about erm he'd be able to reconnect with other people and that kind of and see how it go even though
S0475	yeah
S0417	a year be actually quite a short time as well so i'd see how it go and to
S0475	and er it er in a sense and this be where because it all start with sort of of school
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know erm so in that sense that's why i kind of bring it up because
S0417	yeah
S0475	if it's go to be i mean there there be other ways of go round it be actually to sell up here
S0417	yeah
S0475	if you can and move to
S0417	yeah
S0475	which be a town
S0417	yeah
S0475	but would be happy there do do you know what i mean cos this house to him mean something really big
S0417	yeah it i think it do mean
S0475	mm mm
S0417	but then sometimes he can he can he can then just change it's really er i don't always predict
S0417	i can't always predict
S0475	right right right
S0417	he can be very very very kind of like
S0475	mm
S0417	hang on hang on and then he'll just oh you know that's okay this something different work and then just go with that
S0475	right right yes
S0417	but that doesn't happen very often
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	erm it's i mean it's like didn't want to move out of for age but now
S0475	that's right
S0417	as soon as he move to
S0475	now now now he won't
S0417	he'll never go back
S0475	he won't leave but er
S0417	i've even sometimes think i wonder
S0417	erm because their mum's get a an english boyfriend
S0475	yeah
S0417	who's there i'm not sure
S0475	yeah
S0417	he'll be able to move for a long time because
S0475	mm
S0417	he's he's i dunno maybe he's he's get quite a few property investments they might end up in england you never know
S0475	yeah
S0417	in croydon that's where he live 's at the stage where he's his job be be i mean he's be there for twenty years
S0475	yeah
S0417	security erm but he's he's he's feed up of it but he's kind of sick of it but in ten years it'll be too late for him to really
S0475	alter it yes
S0417	very
S0475	yeah that's right
S0417	to move or anything but
S0475	mm
S0417	erm but he's sick of it enough to erm consider go back on consultancy again he say that in the last couple of weeks
S0475	yeah mm
S0417	which erm cos if he's weigh up have his but he's only just start his pension again but the more the amount more money he'll earn do consultancy might
S0475	mm
S0417	might well outweigh that erm so i dunno i mean i i don't think he's he would he would ever make a decision to move but if it be but if i say go away to maybe for a year then it would be we sometimes you can come back together in a way that's more more i dunno i i really don't know
S0475	mm yeah
S0417	i think it's
S0475	you know it be just
S0417	er i think it's worth talk about
S0475	er erm yeah i'm not look for
S0475	oh yes erm i would definitely do this
S0417	yeah
S0475	it's just how be how be you feel you know how erm because erm er i personally and this might be wrong
S0417	mm
S0475	i can't see you live in forever
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and that's just just i mean although this house be lovely
S0417	this be house be lovely
S0475	it would
S0417	isn't it this house really really nice
S0475	it's absolutely lovely
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and erm the er i mean i now wish i still live in road
S0417	yeah
S0475	but but it be it be er and at the particular point when we sell it you know
S0417	mm
S0475	and we could have let out every room we have we still manage it but
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm cos of 's business we i mean erm by the time we buy road and bits of the company
S0417	yeah
S0475	there wasn't much leave you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but that be all within a small area
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know of a city
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know er erm that erm and i just vaguely sometimes think oh now wouldn't it be nice cos then i'd have a really big house where
S0417	yeah
S0475	but erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm
S0417	that be nice isn't it
S0475	erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	but then i think no yeah actually this be a this be a better house for you
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm because erm er and it be
S0417	yeah
S0475	cos even when there's no one else there
S0417	yeah
S0475	it doesn't feel too big for us cos it's not too big all the room be quite small
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm they're not erm and it's not it's not a massively big place
S0417	yeah
S0475	but it do it it can cope with x y and z
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and erm er i have vaguely and it's only very vaguely
S0417	yeah
S0475	cos i really don't think that 's go to pop his clog
S0417	yeah
S0475	but erm but er sort of erm have bring up the subject yet again and i think to myself what would i do cos i wouldn't i wouldn't have enough money to
S0417	yeah
S0475	to live in road in to live in that
S0417	road no
S0417	not now no it's really er
S0475	in road
S0417	yeah
S0475	i couldn't afford the bill
S0417	oh really
S0475	no
S0417	oh really
S0475	er i would get about four and a half thousand a year
S0417	okay
S0475	erm which would just about cover the bill i think you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm so and i think what would i do
S0417	yeah
S0475	cos i don't actually want to sell up
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm i don't want to rent the whole thing out and rent a smaller place
S0417	yeah
S0475	and have a bite of money there erm it would er really i then i come up with sort of idea i think mm one of my children could live
S0417	yeah
S0475	and pay the bill and i could go and live with another child and i would have two two room one in in
S0475	one possibly in and one
S0475	and one
S0417	yeah
S0475	in road and then the erm like whoever be live in my house
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm would have to put up with other people visit
S0475	you now but er do you know what i mean but er
S0417	yeah
S0475	er
S0417	yeah
S0475	i think it make me quite happy i think yes i will be able to manage
S0417	yeah
S0475	by not let out to strangers
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm
S0417	yeah you don't wanna let out to strangers do you really
S0475	i don't actually i really don't want to let out
S0417	no
S0475	to that would just do my head in
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm erm but i think erm er this be not because i think 's go to pop his clog
S0417	no
S0475	don't don't get my wrong
S0417	oh no
S0475	you know
S0417	oh yeah i think 's
S0475	erm
S0417	gonna be
S0475	mm
S0417	hang on there for a while yet
S0475	oh absolutely
S0475	but
S0417	but it's worthwhile think through some of these things like take your time rather than have it suddenly like oh my god
S0475	mm
S0417	what do i do
S0475	erm and also we'll have plenty of time for me to get my head round all the things i just like erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm in the house you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	er cos i remind myself that actually there be place many many years ago
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm
S0417	cos he want to turn it into the a b and b again when pop his clog and like this idea
S0417	it's it's
S0475	and i don't want to
S0417	it's hilarious isn't it
S0417	it er it doesn't suit you it would sit him possibly but
S0475	oh yes yes yes er but you see
S0417	but even then it would like drive him potty really i think
S0475	but he wouldn't he wouldn't need the money
S0417	yeah
S0475	you see cos
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm if i die first
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm er he'd be just as well off as we be now
S0417	oh okay
S0475	because at a certain point when we could have take erm an income
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm from money invest like a you know a pension erm on my name
S0417	yeah
S0475	er but we'd have get much less
S0417	yeah
S0475	than if it be in 's name
S0417	yeah
S0475	and that's most of our income now
S0417	yeah
S0475	because all his other pension like for the church from i think he get one from the church you know
S0417	oh right
S0475	erm
S0475	and his old age pension be much bigger
S0417	yeah
S0475	and mine be much smaller erm the erm but he he would be fine
S0417	yeah
S0475	he wouldn't have to let it out at all he would do it because maybe he be he want somebody in the house
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but erm no i i couldn't live in in road erm i couldn't afford i couldn't afford to live by myself in road on money but er erm and er it doesn't really bother me that
S0417	yeah
S0475	but then i think how would you do it
S0417	yeah
S0475	and i think that's the perfect solution i've always want er i've always er want er rent you know
S0417	yeah yeah that's true
S0475	so you know doesn't matter which child it be
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm er but i wouldn't want to live permanently with
S0417	yeah
S0475	people like that you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	er but then i would try and get away erm in somebody else's house
S0417	yeah
S0475	family house and just away between them
S0417	yeah
S0475	er and i think that would be really quite good
S0417	well you're always welcome to you could come and live here there's load of room
S0475	yeah but but but
S0475	and and and yes come come come for a few months to yours or
S0417	yeah
S0475	whatevers but erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but erm er but i would i would erm but again if i be live here
S0417	yeah
S0475	i would not want to be like live i wouldn't be a guest
S0417	yeah
S0475	so i would be i would want my room my television
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know erm that kind of thing
S0417	yeah
S0475	and just be able to sort of potter around myself you know
S0417	oh yeah
S0475	erm and
S0417	well if you have to
S0475	then do do do the
S0417	no you can't be a guest in somebody's house it's a horrible way to live
S0475	you know it's er it's it's
S0417	yeah
S0475	actually
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm but it i i really felt we be happy then
S0417	oh that's good that you kind of feel
S0475	cos i think
S0417	like there be
S0475	mm
S0417	there be options that would suit you
S0475	not happy that 's go but
S0475	i would i would
S0417	yeah
S0475	but you know there would be no fear that er and he wouldn't die suddenly
S0417	mm
S0475	so we i could get my head round all the money business and the bill i could probably
S0417	yeah
S0475	stay here
S0417	yeah
S0475	actually without do anything
S0417	yeah
S0475	but then after that year i would have to do something
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm er but i mean that wouldn't be bad
S0417	yeah
S0475	er and then i wouldn't be too much of a burden on anybody
S0417	yeah
S0475	on any one person erm
S0417	yeah that's
S0475	but erm
S0417	yeah that's true
S0475	er it i would still feel i be independent
S0417	yeah
S0475	but it would just be that
S0417	yeah
S0475	you don't want to kind of that's granny's room you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	that's granny's telly that can record
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know kind of style erm
S0417	no you're right be
S0475	mm
S0417	actually i've be er feel like i should think about my pension but as well recently i be think this be the kind of time that i could do something about it but erm
S0475	yeah
S0417	cos i don't have i i don't really
S0475	you won't have a lot actually
S0417	i won't have a lot
S0475	erm
S0417	and er the way that things stand at the minute erm i don't
S0475	erm
S0417	i have like a small very small like nhs one because i
S0475	right
S0417	i leave i mean i be only there
S0475	mm
S0417	eight years
S0475	mm
S0417	even though it be a good one at the time and then since then i've only work part time
S0475	mm
S0417	and i've i've always
S0475	mm
S0417	put into a pension pot but how something like that and then erm so that's what i have and if if i'm here live with erm i mean possibly things might change but erm his wife still have er be still she's still his wife even though they've get a separation agreement in place
S0475	mm right
S0417	erm that's sort out a lot of the finance she have get claim to all of his pension
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	erm and erm she's er i mean i do say to him a while ago as well you know if you're you really do need to start think about divorce
S0475	mm mm mm
S0417	cos you say you couldn't afford it and it hasn't actually get the money i think his solicitor say you'd need to pay her twenty thousand to for her to sign away your pension
S0475	really
S0417	cos he's already do all the finance because
S0475	right
S0417	and he hasn't get twenty thousand
S0475	mm mm
S0417	yeah but if you leave if you
S0475	yeah
S0417	leave it another five ten years she might not wanna do that cos she might be think more about her future
S0475	absolutely absolutely
S0417	and erm might be want those and so
S0475	mm
S0417	so i'm quite precarious but and also this house have nothing to do with me
S0475	okay
S0417	it's not in my name
S0475	no no
S0417	it's all be leave to the girls
S0475	no right
S0417	erm so erm if he die i've get no pension and no home and i've er i've say this before
S0475	yes yeah yeah
S0417	and i think he he's he's get so many financial responsibilities that he just hasn't even be able to think or talk about it
S0475	no no
S0417	he he kind of try a bite but he really
S0475	no mm
S0417	he get angry at first and then just erm
S0475	mm
S0417	erm say oh you know i'm happy to share my pension with you and that er it and but he still hasn't divorce
S0475	yeah
S0417	so there be some things not just the school i think that if i don't sort out no matter now like be very kind on a day to day basis
S0475	mm mm mm
S0417	but there be too many other people erm who be at the minute still have a stake and claim to him that he's he's allow himself to be even in like a day to day sense of pick people up
S0475	yeah yeah yeah
S0417	and that kind of thing and so er i'm vulnerable in that way if if
S0475	yeah
S0417	if
S0475	yeah
S0417	if the ex or any of the kid want
S0475	mm
S0417	more money and i mean i'm not sure
S0475	yeah
S0417	how much he's pay i mean that i think he's
S0475	yeah
S0417	i think he's not have to pay so much for erm the university for
S0475	right
S0417	because she's live at her mum's so he's try to some way or
S0475	yeah
S0417	well not wangle but just er
S0475	mm yeah
S0417	apparently they only go in that the parent they're they're live with income
S0475	right
S0417	for some of it
S0475	yeah
S0417	but she'll still need live expense and i can imagine that would have probably refuse
S0475	mm
S0417	so there there be things
S0475	mm
S0417	go on cos i don't have access to the main bank account that's his
S0475	yeah right yeah
S0417	so i'm quite i'm i feel i be quite
S0475	mm
S0417	in a vulnerable position
S0475	you be in quite a vulnerable position that's right
S0417	and if erm erm
S0475	mm
S0417	there be there's also i'm also think about what what do i need to do about my future and he say he say oh you know you'll have your house and that income i say well our house be not necessarily my pension because then where i might not i i've get no other stable home
S0475	yeah yeah that's right
S0417	so that be that be really my home
S0475	that's right
S0417	erm that's not an additional part of money for me
S0475	mm mm
S0417	and also i want to leave something to my kid which include
S0475	that's it mm
S0417	and erm i don't you know i you you want to you know continue
S0417	your house and your
S0475	mm
S0417	your girls will be get possibly two home
S0475	yeah
S0417	from their mother
S0475	yeah
S0417	and their father two
S0475	yeah
S0417	like five bedroomed
S0475	yeah
S0417	home erm and erm i want to leave something to that that
S0475	mm
S0417	i've build up over the years
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	and because i'm i'm here and i be i be a contributor because i'm bring up
S0475	mm
S0417	our son
S0475	yeah
S0417	with when i be work i pay money
S0475	yeah yeah yeah
S0417	into the house and that kind of thing so there be there be things we really haven't resolve and that be that need to be need to be tackle and it's a another thing again if i just just kind of add on
S0475	yeah
S0417	and i
S0475	mm
S0417	and i understand all sort of reason why er er 's be he's be put upon a lot
S0475	yeah
S0417	in the past but
S0475	yeah
S0417	i'm just gonna kind of get the crumb if i'm not careful of everything
S0475	yeah
S0417	of where we be wherever
S0475	yeah yeah right
S0417	if they move to where all the where the kid be go to school you know when he
S0475	mm
S0417	he and get together they they do what i kind of need they marry
S0475	yeah
S0417	she her name be on the bank account her name be on the mortgage
S0475	mm
S0417	the school be down the road
S0475	mm that's right
S0417	the family be around
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	all those kinds of things and i suddenly have get i'm not near the school with er i'm not near where i'd like you know
S0475	mm
S0417	i because i don't drive in england
S0475	you're near your family
S0417	not near my family i'm not you know i'm i'm in the the house that i've only just start to claw back some
S0475	uhu
S0417	sense of belong to anyway
S0475	yeah yeah
S0417	because you know when the girls be here at first it be
S0475	yes
S0417	er they didn't really
S0417	make me feel at yeah they didn't make me feel at home
S0475	mm mm
S0417	so there's lot of erm battle and also erm even with you know my house if i i dunno if i want to do i just keep it on all the time in bristol or
S0475	mm
S0417	erm if i need to do anything with it then i'm or i want to sell it even to like get another house say like if i
S0475	mm
S0417	say get one in i mean i probably couldn't even afford one but
S0475	no
S0417	somewhere where i could erm that be more of a more so i could keep and eye on it really or even i just erm want to reinvest some money somewhere else
S0475	or even if you put that into a pension fund
S0417	or if i put it into a pension fund or a leave it as that but it's the i but there be all those
S0475	there's there's all sort of
S0417	yeah
S0475	ins and out that er
S0417	but i've get to think of that kind of thing
S0475	mm
S0417	but but if erm er and also if i if i leave it there i'm also liable for capital gain tax and if i'm if i sell it and i if i'm live in ireland now i'm possibly
S0475	mm
S0417	liable in both countries for that as well
S0475	right right
S0417	and ireland's quite harsh on that in
S0475	right yeah
S0417	harsher than the uk
S0475	right
S0417	erm so i'm i'm not sort out my investments so i like so there's a lot
S0475	but it's but it's i mean and again because you have and
S0417	mm
S0475	er first of all i just it er so many mums i'd just the first two years of a child's life
S0417	yeah
S0475	for them think properly right
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm that er cos you don't have a brain
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm your brain's not in in in right work order
S0417	yeah
S0475	i mean erm never mind all the other problems that you have as well
S0417	yeah
S0475	and now that he's now on his birthday his third birthday
S0417	yeah
S0475	be this school bite that's sort of crop up
S0417	mm
S0475	which be go to add another pressure to your life
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and make it actually much more difficult to say right i'll go out to work when he's at school because
S0417	yeah
S0475	you can't do you know you
S0417	i know
S0475	it's not that kind of erm the the the hours the erm erm you don't have someone near who would actually be will to sort of erm help with like
S0417	yeah
S0475	the childcare or anything like this
S0417	yeah
S0475	that er erm er so in a sense him go to school will be
S0417	yeah
S0475	and this i'm i can be quite sort of sure of this will be another transition bite
S0417	mm
S0475	of both and to think about
S0417	mm
S0475	you know erm the i've get no solutions
S0417	yeah
S0475	you know
S0417	but it's worthwhile i think think of
S0475	mm
S0417	things long term i think if you think
S0475	oh yes yes
S0417	think for example
S0475	think of things in the long term
S0417	like you go like i suppose the options in one way be clear like i stay with i don't stay with i stay with
S0475	mm
S0417	and that's erm that's the next like
S0475	mm
S0417	hopefully forty years whatever
S0475	that's right
S0417	do feel like a long time don't stay with him and there's there's other connotations but there erm er
S0475	or you move you stay with but not here but in
S0417	so if i stay with but there's erm there er
S0475	which be near enough his kid be near enough to his kid
S0417	oh god yeah
S0475	and be a city
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm erm the the you know it's
S0417	yeah
S0475	near his work it's do you know what i mean
S0417	but also lot of things be
S0475	yeah
S0417	be also in transition too there be
S0475	but for him to come over to england
S0417	because kid be in transition
S0475	be erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	i can't imagine i cannot imagine settle down in england i just can't
S0417	no
S0475	i don't know why but i just can't you know erm
S0417	yeah i think a lot of i think oh i don't know it's like i think a lot of people find it from ireland still carry that kind of erm they hang on to the old country anyway and that's just a general irish thing
S0475	yes yeah yeah
S0417	also we it's it be tricky though erm with him because i think he's get frustrations wherever he be and i think he's get frustrations
S0475	mm
S0417	here because he hasn't do huge things with his life and
S0475	right
S0417	i mean he's he's have kid and work i mean
S0475	yes yes yes
S0417	they be huge things i'm not say
S0475	and they be
S0417	you know
S0475	erm but erm
S0417	but he's get a kind of there be a bite of a yearn in him but there to flourish i think
S0475	right
S0417	but but
S0475	mm
S0417	erm i don't know if he's able to do what it need to flourish cos er to flourish you've get to take risk and and
S0475	yeah
S0417	you have to change and you have to be
S0475	yeah
S0417	out there and you have to i think when he leave his wife that be a huge thing for him
S0475	yeah
S0417	and
S0475	mm
S0417	he do flourish for a while erm but i think he also he be he i mean he only go away for like twice i think for a couple of weekend
S0475	right
S0417	and whether er at work somebody erm say to him a couple of months ago he say oh yeah he have great potential but you're you're too late now you've stay here too long in
S0475	mm mm
S0417	and he and he say that to me he say i know he i think he know there's he erm like he if he'd give himself more opportunities by i mean he do move to for a little bite
S0475	oh really
S0417	when he meet he do yeah to work
S0475	oh right
S0417	and he quite like it
S0475	right
S0417	i think he quite like
S0475	mm
S0417	and he move in with a friend
S0475	yeah
S0417	erm and then he then he move back he move back with and basically they have no friends and he just work for for fifteen years that's all he do
S0475	mm
S0417	no no other
S0475	mm
S0417	friends just the family nothing they didn't do anything
S0475	mm
S0417	they go for their
S0475	mm
S0417	own holiday they work in
S0475	mm
S0417	the same job and
S0475	yeah
S0417	but so i don't it's it's tricky as well but yeah i i i think i think if he ever end up in england he'd be moan the whole time but then when he's here there's also a bite of him that's keep keep sort of say i feel like i've miss things i feel like i'm miss out
S0475	yeah
S0417	erm so who know
S0475	i mean
S0417	erm
S0475	be he of the ilk potentially
S0417	mm
S0475	to just say right okay once erm i mean he's get a time to you've both get a long time to wait until 's off your hand you know
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm get a caravan and just go
S0417	no see if i i think
S0475	mm
S0417	the thing be he doesn't really erm
S0475	he's not that kind of person
S0417	i think he's frustrate but he's he doesn't really know what he's frustrate about
S0475	right right
S0417	but it's more than he's get now
S0475	right
S0417	and i think sometimes when he's really felt like he doesn't always where he's get out there and when he's
S0475	mm
S0417	out there somewhere else
S0475	yeah
S0417	so it's to do with i think be out somewhere else do stuff but he can't like i've i've even i even say to him now you know you've you've get one life you've get to start do stuff
S0475	mm
S0417	for yourself
S0475	yeah
S0417	or you've get to start do things that
S0475	yeah
S0417	make you feel cos he'll say oh no just kind of on the treadmill and when i'm here i'm do the housework
S0475	mm
S0417	but i think cos part of him hang on to it's i think he's a bite a bite autistic in that way or a bite
S0475	yeah
S0417	kind of you now oh i don't know what the world word be i don't mean
S0475	mm
S0417	i don't mean to denigrate him but that
S0475	mm
S0417	kind of
S0475	we'll have to see the autistic er don't don't find that word denigrate
S0417	no it's not no
S0417	it's not i don't think it's a denigrate word
S0475	but but he'd be the one with the by the way
S0417	yeah
S0475	i i think of of him as be the
S0417	yeah
S0475	sort of erm erm the one who's

S0475	no it's
S0417	other other yeah i don't
S0475	mm
S0417	i definitely don't think he'll make any decision future decisions to do something that will make erm in his life or look in that er ahead enough in the future to think right
S0417	mm
S0475	if that happen then i'll go off and then i'll
S0475	mm
