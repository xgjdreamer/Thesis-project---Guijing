S0115	oh what's that your uh
S0037	this be a
S0115	be that the one that you just start or
S0037	it's another chicken
S0115	that one of your one of your collection of chickens
S0037	what i think i might do be like at work um think i might like give them to some people with a little with a little cadbury's crème egg in as like a easter present
S0115	well that be quite a good idea uh well creative anyway
S0037	yeah well like
S0115	just like as as a present so
S0037	well just cos like why not
S0115	uh and then afterwards you might be able to use it as a as an egg warmer
S0037	egg warmer yeah of course
S0115	um
S0037	i'm sure people would like them
S0115	what do an egg warmer like when do you when would you use that
S0037	like when you've make a boil egg in between eat the boil egg and dish put it on the plate like
S0037	that's when i suppose i dunno it's a bite stupid isn't it really
S0115	what the idea of have a a coat for an egg or the idea of make a little chick and give it to people with uh with a crème egg inside it
S0037	i think i think you know the answer to that and i think you know that the answer's both of those
S0115	well it's the unstoppable force of creativity
S0037	well i can't just help i can't help myself can i
S0115	no uh it seem that you you um you know you you have to make chickens um yeah
S0037	well not just chickens the planters be come along and my other unspecified unmentionable uh knit antic
S0115	uh yeah yeah
S0037	guerrilla knit
S0115	yeah um that's uh you've certainly improve a lot i think since
S0037	well just get my
S0115	you pretty much start from from nothing didn't you about a a year or so ago
S0037	yeah i mean i've knit before then but only like like square things you know and only really like just knit and purl i didn't know how to like increase and decrease and didn't know how to crochet which i can do now although very tentatively
S0115	what's increase and decrease what's that
S0037	like so you know if you be knit a jumper or something you might wanna make it narrower towards the top or you know sleeves you make them smaller um at the bottom
S0115	oh yeah yeah so that's the sort of width yeah um thickness isn't it
S0037	it's like add more stitch add more stitch so that you so you know if you if you if you decrease it go like towards the triangle shape and opposite a thing
S0115	yeah also like different different type of stitch in different place and stuff
S0037	yeah i mean i've just do more experiment i think um still sort of a beginner really well you know semi beginner
S0115	oh right well i reckon you've uh you've graduate from like the first year
S0115	of um of uh knit
S0037	you should see some of me nana's knit then you'll know how much of a beginner i be like
S0115	what kinda stuff do she do then
S0037	well some of them be baby things like she knit on very small needle so it's very intricate and take a lot of time
S0115	oh i see
S0037	it's probably why old old ladies can't bloody see a bat cos they've spend hours like pore
S0115	can't see a they can't see a bat
S0037	can't see can't even see a bat
S0037	they they've spend age like pore over knit pattern so anyway so she knit she knit in very small like very small needle and she knit with very fine wool and she knit very fancy pattern with like you know loop and hole with like frilly bits and twiddly bits and stuff
S0115	right yeah very good loop hole frilly twiddly bits uh
S0037	exactly
S0115	what and they're also diddly
S0037	twiddly and diddly bits yeah
S0115	uh yeah yeah well yeah i would have to see some of it to um to judge that
S0037	apparently she's make a lot for
S0115	the the new yeah yeah yeah
S0037	baby so
S0115	yeah um so what be we what we watch after uh after this then
S0037	i wonder about maybe watch that silent witness thing but have a look and see
S0115	it be uh why oh yeah of course uh
S0037	dominion of death or whatever it be
S0115	yeah yeah and uh actually yeah um
S0037	i can make a little i think slowly but surely unless i find another hobby i'll just like coat the house knit like knit warmers for like everything like chair warmer warmer
S0115	d'you knit the whole house with uh so there's no way back from this uh from this knit this be a cul de sac it's a dead end of uh knit
S0037	i'll just knit you a whole like um like a jump like a jump suit in maybe in that colour what d'you think or maybe those two together
S0115	um
S0037	i could knit you a stripy jump suit
S0115	maybe could take up engineer and make like a
S0037	it's more expensive though knitting's quite cheap like that be one fifty
S0115	well yeah yeah i suppose you you need the part and you know if you want to like build something out of uh well you know like uh woodwork or whatever
S0037	yeah i mean i think
S0115	try to like sculpt something like
S0037	well i be think like i've be keep me eye peel for a um a palette you know like i be say
S0115	yeah
S0037	cos i want to build one of those palette garden
S0115	uh oh right yeah of course yeah remember you say yeah yeah you say uh you rest it on the wall and then yeah
S0037	you sort of cover the the back and the side
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then and then you um yeah so you then you fill it with plant so it's like a movable garden so like one day you can have it here one day you can have it here but essentially it's it's vertical so like for people like us who've get no real back yard space
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	then it's useful
S0115	oh henson's sack
S0037	i know he chuck ice he get piss on a plane and chuck ice cub at someone
S0115	which one be he
S0037	gavin henson he's a welsh rugby player he use to go out with charlotte church i mean charlotte church not tcharlotte church
S0115	oh no the wales team but the that's the uh world championship team isn't it
S0037	he hasn't be play in the in the wales national team recently
S0115	oh why be he not really in it and
S0037	he be in it um a while ago but
S0115	not not in the five nations then
S0037	he wasn't in the six nations no
S0115	sorry the six nations
S0037	wasn't good enough
S0115	he's obviously a talented rugby player and it's unfortunate that well i've miss it
S0037	what
S0115	that be a statement that they've issue about like i think they've go round ask uh welsh people whether they you know think he deserve to be
S0037	he's just a bite of an idiot like cos he's be on
S0115	well he get drink which be what rugby players be suppose to do
S0037	it be in the morning though he be obviously like still drink
S0115	on a plane in the morning
S0037	it be a plane from glasgow
S0115	to
S0037	cardiff
S0115	still drink in the morning he throw ice cub
S0037	at a passenger or something
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then he get you know they be angry at him he get ban from fly with that airline uh for six months and he's he get sack from his thing
S0115	oh there he be on strictly come dance
S0037	yeah
S0115	twenty ten
S0037	he's be on another thing like something about bachelor like
S0115	there he be with charlotte church
S0037	something about a bachelor like um where girls be like win the chance to like go on a date with him or something rubbish
S0037	and he's a bite weird
S0115	yeah maybe a bite a bite like yeah
S0037	i think he's a bite mad yeah well anway
S0115	be that why charlotte church be go out with him then
S0037	well i don't know they've get two baby i think or two or three baby
S0115	really
S0037	yeah
S0115	still go out with him
S0037	no she divorce him
S0115	oh right
S0037	or at least she they're not together any more
S0115	i didn't know they have load of baby i didn't even notice that when do she get all those baby
S0037	uh i dunno i don't follow her that closely
S0115	no well probably for the best
S0037	so yeah
S0115	that's just a silly sketch
S0037	so um
S0115	uh yes so uh it doesn't seem there isn't any sport on uh today
S0037	there's not there be so much on for a while wasn't there like every single night
S0115	yeah there be load of football wasn't there
S0037	but i think it's because like we've be watch like um cup and stuff so it's get towards the end so there's only like a few match leave
S0115	competitions really yeah yeah actually it be come towards the end of the end of the uh season isn't it
S0037	season yeah may isn't it something i don't exactly know
S0115	uh yeah sort of yeah and then um
S0037	so yeah i mean
S0115	uh the
S0037	so that's there's less less and less match aren't there obviously obviously
S0115	i think it's isn't middlesbrough and birmingham sort of go for uh and some others go for promotion meanwhile uh
S0037	well i think
S0115	meanwhile em wolves be look like they're definitely uh definitely down
S0037	aww poor old wolves i feel sorry for them
S0115	they be poor
S0037	they shouldn't have sack mick mccarthy though you know that's not gonna do them any favour be it
S0115	uh be it it's the it's it's their owners man the scouse mafia
S0037	yeah
S0115	they're talk about
S0037	sorry
S0115	about andy warhol um things there
S0037	on the yeah
S0115	some of those some sort of dunno how he make those um
S0037	pop art
S0115	yeah that those things
S0037	they're screen print i think
S0115	so it's a photo that's be print on
S0037	well i think
S0115	it's it's just it just look like a black and white photo of um marilyn monroe and he's he's simply colour in sort of on top of it
S0037	yeah screen screen print you can do it i do it at college and you can do it where you um have like shape cut out for example so you make like a template and you basically like sweep the the the colour through different part of it so you might put black on that bite and orange on that bite and
S0115	so what's the colour make out of
S0037	it's like a ink
S0115	oh right i see
S0037	so you have like a like a template
S0115	not uh like a not a colour um sheet of paper
S0037	well you could do i mean you can do all different ways i mean he's not that good be he really
S0115	that's an older older one be it
S0037	i dunno
S0115	uh no i think look at those andy warhol um madonna ones i think that's it's it seem to be quite unspectacular in mm technique
S0037	well i suppose it be pretty different at the time though i mean though like
S0115	i don't know the techniques seem to be quite quite basic
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh then there be also um what else do he do he sort of do like campbell's campbell's soup didn't he
S0037	yeah pop art yeah
S0115	that wasn't uh why's it call pop art actually
S0037	don't know popular yeah
S0115	easy to do
S0037	yeah
S0115	um
S0037	like throwaway i suppose like
S0115	and uh yeah that doesn't sound very you know
S0037	very what
S0115	complementary you know it doesn't sound
S0037	do it not don't know you'll have to
S0115	it sound like a yeah like a disposable
S0037	i don't know that much about art i mean despite my uh
S0115	disposable like like a tin of like a tin of soup eh
S0037	i say i don't know that much about art
S0115	you have you your qualifications um in
S0037	despite my qualifications you'll just tease me about that forever won't you
S0115	well that's no you've you've get some really interest no i wasn't even tease i mean you you've get some really interest um a level you know like you've get uh
S0037	interest you shouldn't do a level because
S0115	really unusual you know combination
S0037	yeah that's not that's not the best plan i wouldn't recommend it
S0115	you know cos you have uh
S0037	some niche career's advice
S0115	uh english um biology uh art
S0037	yeah
S0115	and um um maths and like physics so that be like well bout as well spread out a collection as you can get
S0037	i obviously wasn't very decisive as an eighteen year old sixteen year old
S0115	so it be ones to do but it's
S0037	mm that be a mistake as well pointless should've just do three and absolutely like blast them but never mind
S0115	and therefore
S0037	never mind can't i don't regret it
S0115	but uh no i mean like that's silly no i be i be say that that they be a good a good uh good selection
S0037	yeah for someone else to do not to do yourself you just laugh at somebody who'd just do that
S0115	if you have those qualifications then like you say you the thing that you'd be perfect for would be like an optical uh engineer or something an optical uh like a fence maker or something
S0037	i know optician yeah fence maker
S0115	uh be that what the the what they you you could've be a fence maker
S0037	na that be at i mean do you ever do that at school like one of those i can't remember what it be call you have to answer like load of question
S0115	uh oh um survey
S0037	it have a funny name
S0115	no i um i don't think that i mine would just be
S0037	you have to answer load like hundreds of question about yourself
S0115	they they would just be insult like
S0037	and then at the end it be like your career should be dee duh duh duh duh dee dee and then mine be like picture framer and like fence erector so that be a bite of a letdown
S0115	yeah that be probably still in its in its like beta stage that be where it be
S0037	on balance yeah well i don't think i should write back to them and be like dear and then whatever the company name i spend my life try to be a fence erector only to find actually i be more suit to something else never mind
S0115	uh fantastic job solutions yeah you have to have detail psychometric test
S0037	i've leave that a bite baggy haven't i
S0115	can't guess we'll have to go to scotland some time actually look at that map over there oh this be the snow isn't it that's it's minus two up in uh scotland um but here it's five
S0037	mm yeah but look it's sweep down
S0115	um yeah it's that northeasterly northeasterly chill come down there
S0037	look that's not too far it's only it's tuesday look that's tomorrow four pm that's come home from work time
S0115	that's the rain sort of
S0037	that's not gonna be nice
S0115	it's gonna get uh actually it's gonna be a little bite warmer but uh foggy
S0037	look two degrees
S0115	so quite but
S0037	people be in their bloomin bikini on the beach
S0115	middlesbrough be sort of six and still still reasonably warm though um tomorrow afternoon like if you look at the map and we're like eleven degrees down the bottom
S0037	yeah but that's yeah but it be twenty odd the other day
S0115	and a chilly three for uh scotland north scotland
S0037	ah that's not gonna be very nice at the bank holiday weekend
S0115	yeah look like uh
S0037	that's rubbish
S0115	could be easter uh easter's cancel or something easter indoors
S0037	that's no good be it
S0115	what do we do last easter
S0037	can't even remember
S0115	perhaps not as much as we
S0037	probably eat loadsa egg and just carry on probably
S0115	i don't think we do we do as much as maybe we shoulda do
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but it would've be when be it like the middle of april or something uh end of march
S0037	yeah
S0115	maybe we just like what be it oh it's there's a guy on a cross
S0037	be it jesus
S0115	um
S0037	ah it's look who it be it's von trier excellent ah i'll definitely watch that
S0115	it's uh it's a special crucifixion episode of uh i can imagine what he's gonna do he's gonna take his body it's not lars von trier his name's uh
S0037	ah what's he call
S0115	von trier be be the controversial film director from denmark
S0037	oh what's he call willem no van van he's get a von or a van hasn't he
S0115	have he
S0037	yeah he's oh no that's ah it'll come to us in the middle of the night or something
S0115	uh why uh it's not uh kurt huygens be it
S0037	na
S0115	van hagens
S0037	gunther von hagens
S0115	ah right yeah
S0037	well remember
S0115	i dunno where that come from like
S0037	depths of um
S0115	uh he he's gonna get all these dead pickle body like out that he's get which he pickle in in the special way his special technique that he pickle them use um
S0037	yeah crucify one but plasticin plastidation plastinatiousing
S0037	plasticination or something
S0115	i wouldn't have remember that word actually but
S0037	something about plasticine anyway goodness i'm terrible
S0115	and um he's gonna get his body and he's only gonna go and stick them up on you know take all the skin off and everything and stick them up on a load of cross so we can all see how unpleasant crucifixion actually be
S0037	ugh no but actually i do i saw one once that he do in conjunction with like an actual doctor so it wasn't just his like grizzly you know behaviour he do it with like an actual
S0115	oh yeah no no no the i never object to to any of it really i mean i think it be great science and uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	great great or whatever uh opportunism or whatever the word be um he's creatively come up with a way to make money make himself famous show some science be educate
S0037	but i think yeah i don't find it that disgust what he do it's just like the human body isn't it like you say
S0115	no i don't mind it at all
S0037	it's just like what it really look like underneath while it be a little bite weird i suppose it's just real
S0115	um uh yeah no i think it's it's it's great and obviously the people have sign up to it um we saw another one where it be a guy who uh yeah he like have himself mummify didn't he that be uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	like interest thing to do but um yeah so he put so he's he's gonna sort of take people and like perhaps hang them on cross and like so you can see how crucifixion work from the inside perhaps be it it's like he's uh be that be that what you think he'd do or or be i just way off the off the mark there
S0037	i dunno he's probably gonna do something horrible isn't he be he gonna look at like the force on
S0115	yeah that's what i be think he's just gonna like
S0037	like whether it be possible and
S0115	possible oh you mean how if he be really yeah
S0037	i i saw a thing that say that they wouldn't have put the hole through your hand cos it just rip out rip through your hand
S0115	oh yeah cos uh it rip through yeah well like someone tell me that um
S0037	but they would put it through your wrists and through your ankle bone
S0115	through the in the wrist yeah
S0037	yeah
S0115	um yeah a lot of these old techniques you can't tell if it be like the um you know uh the uh people who writers exaggerate at the time
S0037	yeah
S0115	so
S0037	but definitely in the book he show him his hand doesn't he the stigmata in the book the book be the bible whoop
S0115	yeah i mean but then in in the book the the bible this that's the problem be that be that they're they they're not that reliable um like the bible might say or some picture might say
S0037	yeah
S0115	that it go um
S0037	wonder what damian hurst's gallery things be
S0115	or when you know
S0037	that's in a grizzly vein as well
S0115	well ramsey's kitchen nightmares embarrass body or damian hurst
S0037	yeah damian hurst's on now with his uh sheep and all
S0115	another one of these uh these modern artist type that uh may be a tad on the overrate side controversial statement
S0037	yeah well sorry i be just count stitch
S0115	modern art load of rubbish discuss
S0037	hey look it's noel field he look almost like a girl i do like him like
S0115	think he he be half girl
S0037	i'm sure he wouldn't be offend by that
S0115	and one quarter woman and the final quarter be um
S0037	spaceman
S0115	yeah
S0037	yeah bite weird
S0115	he's a very effeminate guy he's it's uh

S0037	yeah
S0115	in in in berlin uh
S0037	he must have so much money
S0115	a lot of time
S0037	maybe we should watch this i think i'd be quite interest
S0115	okay be it not on um conflict with something we be gonna watch like
S0037	well it's nine o'clock i mean that thing's probably on silent witness
S0115	silent witness
S0037	if you'd rather watch that but we'd have to do that now
