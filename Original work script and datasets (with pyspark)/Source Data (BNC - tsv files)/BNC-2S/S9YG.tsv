S0618	there we be hello
S0619	i be sit hello hello
S0618	there we be
S0619	erm no i be sit on the balcony on tuesday for hours read and drink tea
S0618	very good
S0619	i just need the sun
S0618	yeah
S0619	and it be so nice and i think i can't believe it feel like spring
S0618	mm
S0619	and then today it's like no
S0618	i know
S0619	and i check the weather again and it's like up and down up and down and then snow schedule next friday as well
S0618	yeah but it's funny though cos it'll say snow and then the day will roll round and it'll be rain
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but last night's snow be forecast but i just couldn't believe it when it actually appear
S0619	no i know
S0618	it's just so weird go from fourteen degrees to i think there be probably three or four inch last night
S0619	yeah and it's not it wasn't even that cold i don't think i didn't think it be below zero
S0618	no no i agree and this morning the melt be on erm two degrees today apparently so mm yeah
S0619	yeah mm random i'm just really i just need some sun now
S0618	yeah sun and rest i should think
S0619	just for mm mm
S0618	mm so
S0619	so
S0618	when be you off at you've get today off be you take
S0619	no i'm in for three hours from four to seven just do mock speak exams
S0618	yeah have you get speak for that
S0619	cancel my one to one's yeah it's just like ask question
S0618	okay
S0619	it's really not a lot erm cos i just feel so no i know like erm in no way should i feel guilty
S0618	no god no you're sick
S0619	but you kind of do anyway
S0618	mm
S0619	and i be think about it i be like i've never take time off work apart from once when i be nineteen and i fell down some stairs in a nightclub and break my nose
S0619	cos i'd drink like a bottle of gin straight
S0618	oh that'll do it oh
S0619	er and then have to my i couldn't even speak my friend have to phone it be when i work at a clothe shop at uni my friend have to go she just can't come in today cos she's just break her nose and she's get two black eye and her face be full of cut
S0619	so she'll be off for about a week
S0619	and i think i've never take time off apart from that er and you know i just feel a bite of a wuss like it's er it's only a cold
S0618	i'd say it speak more of a lack of self love
S0619	do you think
S0618	not wish to pass on any judgement
S0619	no go on
S0618	but yeah cos i feel if you love yourself and respect yourself sufficiently then you really want to take good care of the physical human organism your consciousness occupy for a short period of time
S0619	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
S0618	and you take care of it and you nurture it and if it's not function right you give it what it need until it do which be usually rest
S0619	yeah yeah true i'm not a very resty person
S0618	and i think that's why the no i know
S0619	i think that's the problem
S0618	or even just rest sound like be horizontal and not do anything
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but it could be just watch netflix send email
S0619	yeah
S0618	fiddle about on facebook whatever sit on the balcony read a book when it's not full of snow
S0619	mm mm mm mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah i know but i think it's just tricky i find it really hard
S0618	so i suppose we come from a culture where there's a lot of guilt associate with time off
S0619	yeah
S0618	and there's this perception that you need to martyr yourself to every role and
S0619	and here i think it's completely different
S0618	yeah
S0619	if you're sick you don't go to work and in england i you know i be sort of talk about this on twitter the other day like if you're in an office people you know say stuff if you you're off work because you've get a cold or whatever
S0618	mm
S0619	but then if you're in work and you've get a cold people be like oh god this person's sniff the whole time
S0618	yeah
S0619	so you can't win
S0618	you can't win so you might as well do what give you your greatest joy
S0619	whatever you want yeah yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i i i feel guilty in the sense that other people be go to have to cover my lessons or they're all be cancel and all of this stuff so it's just a bite shit
S0618	mm yeah i suppose i can understand that if other people need to do more
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but then people get sick so the organisation really expect that that's gonna happen
S0619	yeah yeah and i've cover lessons for load of people so
S0618	yeah
S0619	er
S0618	and i imagine there be a lot of people who want the extra money
S0619	mm mm yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	so
S0618	so you might even be do somebody a favour
S0618	let's face it the christmas card credit card bill have just come in
S0619	true
S0618	there be probably polish people go fuck how be i go to pay this
S0619	yeah and it be winter break and they have be underpay so
S0618	and then ta da yeah so now some extra hours
S0619	yeah true
S0618	they'd probably be full of gratitude hooray 's sick hooray
S0619	hooray oh thank you thank you

S0618	yeah
S0619	you know and it'll take some time to get back to that point
S0618	but i i think i say to you in a whatsapp message i i do wonder be this like the final purge of all of that shit that you've be through in december
S0619	mm

S0619	mm mm
S0618	i think fuck it actually i really enjoy retail work in a small community environment

S0619	mm mm yeah

S0619	mm mm big windows
S0618	as much light and air as possible just let it in love it and it be weird see my home all dark
S0619	yeah kind of erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	what's the word i find it's it depend where you live of course but people who's home be really erm not introvert or insular but you know they face inwards the house be about sort of be everything sort of face inside the house and no one's look out
S0618	mm yeah that's interest yeah i wonder if they've move where the sofa go cos i always use to have the sofa position so i can stare out the window and wave and anybody who walk past yeah not in a nosy neighbour kind of way but just in i'm sit on my sofa read a book do my own thing oh there you be neighbour hello kind of a way yeah
S0619	mm mm mm mm mm mm we use to my grandad be such a sort of neighbourhood watch

S0619	oh oh who's there well it must be three o'clock cos it's 's
S0618	that's brilliant
S0619	yeah it's funny
S0618	yeah so we have indian takeaway
S0619	nice
S0618	which be lovely oh my god indian oh it's so good we must try the indian place in again i don't necessarily hold out much hope that it'll be any better than
S0619	no i know we've not be for chinese either
S0618	no
S0619	but i'm not really in to chinese as much as indian
S0618	no i miss indian though so that be nice it be and my neighbour and erm and from number eight pop over and then from number five who happen to be 's brother pop in and say oh my god how be you and have a big hug with him and he go home and tell his wife that i be over so she come in and have a big hug
S0619	oh nice
S0618	erm and yeah people be just sort of wander in bring alcohol with them it be kind of nice really and then from number five i think she wander in oh oh you're back and i just felt while i be in northern ireland so love so appreciate so part of the community i felt like i have good friends who be genuinely please to see me and have miss me and sort of value and appreciate me
S0619	mm mm mm mm
S0618	so i think it's do my soul good to be back in that that love
S0619	mm mm do it not tempt you
S0618	wind and rain oh my god no
S0618	yeah if it be a little mediterranean climate
S0619	yes
S0618	then i could be tempt but jeez be so cold and i think it's the wind that do my head in
S0619	mm
S0618	so i can imagine spend time there again for a few years it really be so beautiful and i say to actually if i do move back which i might at some point there be so many opportunities i didn't take part in like for example the local sail club in erm meet in the sail club every wednesday and you can put your name down to be crew so even if you have no idea about boat there be people who need crew to take their boat out so they'll take you on their boat and teach you what to do and you just go up and down the lock every wednesday night
S0619	oh that's nice
S0618	isn't that lovely so
S0619	yeah new hobby
S0618	yeah and meet people and things like that so i think no that'd be i'd i'd definitely do that definitely and there be other sort of charitable organisations that people volunteer at there's erm gateway club which be erm people with learn disabilities i know quite a lot of people from the town who volunteer with that and love it
S0619	mm mm mm mm
S0618	and it be their play this weekend so everyone be get quite excite about the play they be put on
S0619	on nice
S0618	it be good yeah really good and then i have some time up in belfast oh and i have another date
S0619	oh
S0618	from diva date
S0619	uhu
S0618	erm very nice woman forty eight years old a gardener an artist a sculptor
S0619	oh
S0618	erm it be very interest but no spark unfortunately
S0619	sad
S0618	yeah
S0619	sad sad
S0618	yeah yeah she be very lovely and it's funny i wonder if i could matchmake her with a friend of mine in cos i think they'd get on but yeah maybe that's a conversation between them for another day
S0619	ah ha ha
S0618	but yeah
S0619	mm it's funny what you say about you know go back and feel sort of love and appreciate and i think whenever i go home you know apart from sort of my immediate family it doesn't feel like that because
S0618	mm
S0619	and i think it's because we're all in our like early mid twenties and everyone's come go leave
S0618	mm
S0619	away and come back
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so it's not like there's any sort of feel of loss i suppose when you go
S0618	mm
S0619	and any particular feel of return because everyone's always
S0618	yeah everyone's do it there's not a core of people who be always there
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	in the same house in the same job
S0619	so you really sort of yeah so at christmas when you see absolutely everybody it's really really nice but it's not sort of individual to you everyone feel the same way about everybody i suppose
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	er which be you know it's not a bad thing but sort of i'm sort say it in a sort of selfish way but it's just a sort of different situation i suppose
S0618	mm yeah it's interest i wonder if that's a stage of life thing because those folks be all age forty to seventy five
S0619	yeah so they're settle
S0618	yeah
S0619	they're in the same place and when someone leave that community it's much more obvious
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	whereas with your age group
S0619	what i mean there's sort of
S0618	there's the leave for uni thing and then there's leave for various job thing
S0619	yeah and there's no nobody's really settle yet
S0618	yeah
S0619	i suppose
S0618	yeah and i guess over the next decade for you and your friends there's gonna be the get marry and have baby thing
S0619	yeah so i anticipate really in the next ten years a lot of people will come back home
S0618	mm
S0619	they've be to london or they've be abroad or whatever but when they find somebody they'll probably go back home i guess
S0618	mm interest
S0619	i think so
S0618	do you equate a relationship with put down root in a particular geographical location
S0619	i don't associate relationship with anything to do with me so
S0619	so so can i
S0618	completely independent no idea
S0619	so i don't know er but in general do i associate relationships with put root down in a particular place yeah i think so
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	but maybe that's just because that's what society seem to suggest you should do
S0618	mm i guess yeah i guess historically and traditionally you get marry you buy a house you breed and then once you've be breed your offspring need school
S0619	yes
S0618	and that i guess be where move about can cause disruption
S0619	mm mm yeah especially for kid in school yeah for sure
S0618	the small people yeah
S0619	yeah interest don't know
S0618	mm
S0619	anyway we've get valentine's day to look forward to so that's something
S0618	oh haven't we just
S0619	er i haven't once again if i don't find it i will tell you or i will call you and go to buy it for you
S0618	what
S0619	er 's nebuliser
S0618	ah
S0619	let me just show you this er i don't know whether you'll find it funny but i find it really funny this phone's very slow
S0618	yeah no wi fi last night what be that all about
S0619	oh you poor thing
S0618	i know i be panic for a bite think
S0618	cos i've get a flat roof i think i me and my neighbour have the only flat roof in the whole of poland everybody else have these real steep angle roof so the snow can fall off
S0619	yeah yeah yeah so you're the snow be erm
S0618	yeah and actually i dunno why i'm think that i'm just presume there's something on the roof that have my email signal if girls be boys
S0618	so true
S0619	ah there's a few things on here that i just think you'd like this owl
S0618	ah aren't owls beautiful
S0619	i love owls
S0618	yeah i use to see barn owls a lot at my uncle's house and at my brother's house and they've both get erm well they both live in the country where you've get a big long straight road with field either side and my theory be that at dusk or after dark the owl ah little fox oh that's so cute
S0619	he think the bed be snow

S0618	cool what be you read at the moment
S0619	er i've be read a lot of young adult stuff at the moment
S0618	mm
S0619	er which i really like i think more people should read young adult fiction for sure
S0618	mm
S0619	erm so at the moment i'm read a book call be i normal yet about a girl a teenager who's get er mental health problems
S0618	mm mm
S0619	and she's on the road to recovery but she keep relapse and she doesn't want to tell anybody cos she doesn't want to disappoint her parent er mm she hasn't tell my of her friends because she doesn't want them to think that she's weird that she's go to a therapist every week
S0618	mm
S0619	er so yeah it's it's nice
S0618	i wonder if everybody have thoughts and feel like that at that young age i certainly do and i have a therapist for years when i be a teenager i mean particularly sort of age i don't know thirteen plus
S0619	mm mm
S0618	cos my mum leave when i be six and i think that you know upset my relationships and how i be generally erm and i think it be bloody brilliant and i sort of come out of that experience think my god everybody should have counsel
S0619	i really think that everybody should have counsel
S0618	yeah and i think it's almost the same people that that do because you're confront these things
S0619	uhu
S0618	and then i saw somebody again when i be about sixteen no seventeen eighteen
S0619	yeah
S0618	i have a relationship that end and i felt like shit for a while yeah
S0619	i've be want a therapist for a few years but when i be at home i couldn't afford it and now i'm here and i can't have a polish therapist i don't know if you can like skype therapist skype counsellors i don't know
S0618	i'm sure you can i bet you can
S0619	but i really need to do something about it
S0618	yeah i bet you can get a skype counsellor
S0619	yeah
S0618	i bet you can yeah no i think it's really good i think any sort of talk therapy be wonderful
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm yeah these days i tend to talk to myself it seem to do the trick
S0619	well i've try sort of ask a question and then kind of mind map it on a piece of paper with arrows and why why why why why why
S0618	mm
S0619	to try and sort of find a conclusion and i just sort of write all of this stuff and don't find a conclusion
S0618	yeah
S0618	maybe there be no conclusion maybe the process be the heal
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	don't know don't know
S0618	and you can ask for help at the risk of sound a little crazy you can ask for help from your guide and from you know those who be the other side of the veil who be here to guide and look after you and from your higher self cos they've get a rule of free will a rule of non interference so they're not allow to interfere in your life you have to say
S0619	even if you ask
S0618	come on guy could do with a little help here please and then they can help but you have to ask
S0619	mm
S0618	so that's the law
S0619	the law what be you read
S0618	i'm read the law of one which be all about er the law of one be basically the law of it's kind of unity consciousness that we be all drop in the ocean of god or the creator or whatever you want to call it and it's kind of interest it go off on some ufo tangents which i find a little bite bore cos i suppose i've be there do that when i be younger i be all into paranormal oh ufos and oh alien and now i just my understand be that we have sort of star brothers and sisters and cousins
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i think it's quite arrogant of humanity to think otherwise to imagine we're the only intelligent ho ho erm kind of conscious be
S0619	mm mm
S0618	in this infinite multiverse erm so yeah i think we have these sort of other intelligences that be around us that you don't necessarily perceive on a physical level but can perceive on other level and now i suppose i've have so many years and take them for grant and just think oh yeah you know extraterrestrial be
S0619	uhu
S0618	consciousness whatever i kind of see them all of part of this oneness as well i see all of physicality sort of third dimensional reality as part of physicality and i see this kind of as a stage on which we come to meet challenge and to learn life lessons for the evolution of self which be the evolution of all actually evolution's maybe the wrong word cos that imply time and i don't believe in time necessarily other than its practical everyday applications but
S0619	i'm a huge advocate of time
S0618	yeah i know
S0619	er funny

S0619	well any other news
S0618	news no erm oh i've be try to book this apartment in barcelona and i've pay the deposit international bank transfer it wasn't a huge amount that be okay and then i only just now read the contract and it say i need to provide the owner with a certificate of insurance against theft fire and water damage
S0619	what so you've get to get home insurance for somewhere that's not your home
S0618	i know what the very fuck so i've email her to say er and in the meantime i've google stuff and tripadvisored stuff and it seem cos she's french and she's in france
S0619	uhu
S0618	and she use a french let thing
S0619	oh so it's run through like an agency
S0618	kind of but i think she's her own agency and there's standard contract and things
S0619	uhu
S0618	erm and trip advisor suggest that this be very common in france
S0619	right
S0618	and very common in french let and when french people hire holiday home from another french person in france
S0619	uhu
S0618	they get this special waiver form thing
S0619	right
S0618	from their insurer that just say yes you're cover for this place
S0619	uhu
S0618	as well and trip advisor also suggest that anybody who have go back to their potential owner and say er the owner's say oh don't worry about it
S0619	right
S0618	so i've email to go er and i'm hop she'll get back and say don't worry about it
S0619	uhu
S0618	if she doesn't i could potentially lose my deposit because it's not gonna be cost effective to
S0619	mm mm
S0618	insure a place like that
S0619	somewhere else that's so weird
S0618	nut so i'm kick myself for it's so unlike me
S0619	yeah to be kind of premature i guess
S0618	yeah i usually read the small print
S0619	mm mm
S0618	before i do things like that and for some reason i didn't i think it be the disruption the funeral kind of get in the way cos i be
S0619	yeah and sort of rush it through i guess
S0618	yeah which again be unlike me as well but anyway it'll work out
S0619	yeah for sure
S0618	so we shall see
S0619	mm mm
S0618	yeah and then what else have i get on the agenda i don't er it's be disturb me for a little while but i've be think about the hippies at and think i might end up not stay with them you know and i love the place and i love that they've get thirteen cat but there be place that i've see on the home away website that i love more
S0619	in
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	mm mm
S0618	all over the place and i have some voice message and some photos from

S0619	uhu
S0618	portugal spain somewhere warm for winter and he say right here's what you do head on down to italy get the boat to sardinia and drive your van around sardinia and mm well there be worse place to go but i don't know
S0619	come to
S0618	yeah i don't know
S0619	or in the sort of mountain regions near
S0618	year cos i think of and i think bright red drunken english lobsters
S0619	no
S0618	who be there on all inclusive package deal
S0619	no no they don't get a lot of british tourists in no
S0618	no good
S0619	no
S0618	i think well you know i know i be a british tourist but there's just
S0619	yeah
S0618	that package holiday and i i know people who do it who just go and stay drink on the beach for a fortnight
S0619	yeah
S0618	and that's fine if that float their boat but i don't want to be hang out in that environment so
S0619	mm mm well me me and my mum be go for a recce in june
S0618	oh good i'm glad you're go good
S0619	yeah she's yeah she's book book flight and stuff so i don't know how long we'll go for i don't think it's very long but we'll have you know chance to see if i can sort of not only like that place specifically but like the spanish culture
S0618	yeah
S0619	i mean like eat your even meal after ten pm i just think i'll be bed though
S0618	i know i know i know what you mean i find that really weird last time i be in barcelona have erm it be a nice apartment actually it be kind of in a one of those square
S0619	uhu
S0618	and face inwards to the square with like a little bite of grass or whatever it be in between and so i could see into everybody else's home from sit on my little balcony just like they could see into mine and it be fine and it be weird i be go to bed and they be just kind of watch telly eat the meal laugh shout sometimes drink like fuck's sake go to bed
S0619	uhu
S0618	you know even mid week when it's like you're gonna be up for work soon go to bed so yeah i dunno
S0619	i think it'll take a lot of get use to to be in that sort of environment but
S0618	mm
S0619	i think i'm sort of really suit to the polish timetable or this like polish schedule of early mornings early nights
S0618	mm mm
S0619	so
S0618	but you don't have your supper at eight o'clock and then go to bed on a full stomach
S0619	no
S0618	that i find weird and then they're all so skinny but then i think that's because they work too much and run round like headless chickens a lot
S0619	i don't know how everyone be so thin here i think it's really genetics
S0618	mm it's get to be a lot of it and then they don't eat between breakfast and three o'clock
S0619	kid in school do they have like a sandwich at eleven
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	yeah but and then this main meal at three
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know i don't i don't get it
S0618	yeah oh well i suppose different culture different way of do things yeah we'll see
S0619	mm
S0618	do you need a new duvet
S0619	yeah if you don't mind
S0618	it's not that thick no of course
S0619	no this one isn't either but i spill load of alcohol on it
S0619	oh so it's get like a massive kind of yellow patch on it look really suspicious
S0618	oh dodgy yeah
S0619	erm so i might double them up for now but to be honest it's not be that cold
S0618	no
S0619	er one
S0618	and again i think you know house be build so well
S0619	mm mm
S0618	the heat systems be so efficient
S0619	yeah if i have the heat on it's just so hot
S0618	yeah
S0619	but er have to turn everything off so i can't believe how fast it's go i can't believe you're nearly leave what's the date you're leave
S0618	i know two and a half weeks
S0619	how do you feel
S0618	good ready
S0619	mm mm
S0618	yeah i think before i go over for the funeral i get bore sometimes in the week
S0619	yeah
S0618	erm and be in ireland it's so funny i use to always have this belief that i don't really like people
S0619	yeah you've say this before and then you realise that you need
S0618	yeah yeah and i actually do like people
S0619	something
S0618	not all people all of the time i use to think i could just do without people and surround myself with cat and live happily ever after and i do love animals cat
S0619	mm
