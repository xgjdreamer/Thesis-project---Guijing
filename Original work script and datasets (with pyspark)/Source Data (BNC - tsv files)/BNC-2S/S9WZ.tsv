S0517	so i want to know what's happen next door do it not get sell at the auction
S0558	no
S0517	cos i see there's a big auction sign back up
S0558	yeah so it didn't go the best the guide price be one sixty seven
S0517	yes which you say be way too much didn't you
S0558	ridiculous
S0517	bite of land that size
S0558	so somebody have obviously make an offer that be the last bid price which
S0517	oh oh
S0558	they didn't accept erm
S0517	oh well you er can they not just put a reserve price on where it have to be
S0558	i think it be guide price one six seven
S0517	oh right
S0558	so er so but that be i suppose it's a guide price isn't it but they've put it up haven't they for two hundred thousand
S0517	oh god
S0558	which be ridiculous i mean for christ's sake
S0517	do anybody bid do you know do you go cos you be talk about go
S0558	well there there be a price of one seven on the on the information if you go online
S0517	yeah
S0558	and look i think there's a price of one seventy seven
S0517	right
S0558	so erm obviously they didn't accept that so it's at that be over at auction's i mean why would you go all the way
S0517	well yeah
S0558	to auction do you think
S0517	it be december wasn't it
S0558	don't know
S0517	cos i remember you say you be think of
S0558	yeah yeah we be think of
S0517	go along yeah
S0558	this one as at derby
S0517	oh when's the next one then
S0558	twenty third of february i think
S0517	i wonder how long they'll like hang on before they accept a
S0558	well i don't know i don't know
S0517	gosh
S0558	because they've only get twelve months leave of the plan permission
S0517	right so somebody's get to
S0558	because it expire
S0517	buy it and build it and get sort and
S0558	and er yeah within that twelve months otherwise they've get to start again i mean if you if you be buy it for the plot and the location and all the rest of it to be honest i don't think the fact that plan be about to expire would
S0517	no
S0558	overly concern me because it's highly unlikely they're gonna say no next time round when permission have be give
S0517	mm mm
S0558	so that wouldn't concern me too much erm but it be obviously something that you know it's gotta be in your think process hasn't it really
S0517	you wouldn't just buy that
S0558	just
S0517	you wouldn't just buy that without intend to buy would er build you'd just
S0558	oh no no you'd only buy it with the intent to build but it wouldn't be too much if
S0517	no
S0558	the exist plan
S0517	no no no
S0558	have expire
S0517	but it's still a lot isn't it cos even when you've build your house on that
S0558	i know
S0517	i mean it's such a small plot you're not gonna get a massive amount of money you're not gonna get the return i wouldn't have think
S0558	no
S0517	and i don't know how much it cost
S0558	no
S0517	to build a house but
S0558	i think you're talk fifty fifty sixty thousand pound to build a house
S0517	to build it but then you've get to kit it out
S0558	yeah
S0517	i mean that you'll
S0558	well yeah
S0517	you'll double that again won't you by the time
S0558	yeah
S0517	you've put in your kitchen and your bathroom or your furniture so i just don't see how
S0558	and there's a lot of
S0517	they're gonna get the
S0558	no
S0517	return on it
S0558	there's a lot of work involve because they've get to lower the land haven't they
S0517	lower it yes yeah all those condition well get to
S0558	lower the land
S0517	oh so the next one's february
S0558	yeah

S0558	a year older maybe i dunno one or two erm so he's request voluntary redundancy and they've say no you know they oh
S0517	oh
S0558	he's too important to lose type of thing but erm whilst he'd put in for this request he's be put the feelers out and he's be offer a job work at the company in
S0517	mm
S0558	it's a family business the guy who one of the family members work there but the guy who be kind of like manager of the of the depot branch wherever it be company use to work with i think at
S0517	right
S0558	so this guy approach and say look i wanna sort of like take a sort of you know a bite of a a step out and
S0517	mm
S0558	go just a couple of days a week and be like the chief exec so i'm kind of oversee it all but i'm only come in one or two days a week so i need someone to run the company and you're my man i want you so he's like oh oh all this and that so anyway he's accept it
S0517	yeah
S0558	erm they're happy to wait you know however long it take if it's six eight twelve months they'll assist him with the move although they haven't actually say financially
S0517	oh okay
S0558	it may just be impatience you know
S0517	yes yeah yeah
S0558	well however long it take blah i don't know
S0517	yeah
S0558	erm so the only thing be be and don't want to come which you can understand cos they're establish in aren't they
S0517	be at erm university still no she's finish
S0558	no she's finish uni erm she hasn't get herself a proper job yet but she's do a sport massage course now
S0517	oh okay
S0558	and
S0517	and have she get a boyfriend
S0558	no she hasn't have a boyfriend
S0517	right but 's get a girlfriend
S0558	but 's get a girlfriend
S0517	yeah i can understand why they wouldn't want to
S0558	yeah they use to go they use to go to school together and i think it be when be in his second year at uni through social media and everything
S0517	yeah
S0558	they you know they manage to meet up
S0517	get back in touch yeah
S0558	get in touch all that sort of thing and they've be together ever since so and practically live there you know shame for her poor mum say
S0517	the
S0558	i keep invite her mum to tea cos i feel awful
S0517	do she say
S0558	cos she's here all the time and since they've finish university cos she use to just on the holiday she'd spend all her time with at their house
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	and hardly see her mum and like you know
S0517	ah
S0558	now that they've actually finish she's she's do the same again she's i say so have she as good as move in she go well yeah
S0517	oh
S0558	and i mean oh god how much her mum feel she must
S0517	be her mum on her own
S0558	still i still keep invite her for tea erm no get she's get a son who live at home
S0517	oh okay
S0558	but she's divorce
S0517	right oh gosh
S0558	's mum and dad split up so erm so yeah i mean they're close
S0517	mm
S0558	they're close you know and they meet for coffee and that sort of thing
S0517	yeah yeah but
S0558	but she's kind of live
S0517	not the same so oh so they they're gonna stay
S0558	so
S0517	so where will they live
S0558	and don't wanna come so what they're go to do they're really really hop get redundancy
S0517	mm
S0558	because with the money they can pay off the uni debts and not the kids' uni debts the uni debts and have incur
S0517	have they still get those
S0558	through support them
S0517	oh
S0558	i mean they've be run 's car for her haven't they
S0517	mm
S0558	put petrol in it all the time three hundred and fifty pound a month no three hundred pound a month to three hundred and fifty pound a month to
S0517	yeah it's a lot
S0558	extra year for so they have incur over the time
S0517	mm
S0558	like you know debt so they wanna pay that off and they want to give a deposit for and officially in name to have a house
S0517	mm
S0558	but will live there as well
S0517	right
S0558	now i don't know but i just think 's make a mistake
S0517	i'd give them separate amount to use as a
S0558	yeah
S0517	deposit towards their own house
S0558	yeah
S0517	cos otherwise that's just gonna get messy down the line isn't it
S0558	it's gonna get messy isn't it cos she say if they decide to go their separate ways then they can sort it then cos i say so what's gonna happen be be it like that you'll give them the deposit but then it's up to and then to to fund the mortgage and she say yeah i say and the the bill et cetera be cut three ways and she say yeah she say and then if they wanna go their own ways then they sort it
S0517	mm
S0558	but i'm think to myself gonna be awfully young to potentially have to be buy out like
S0517	the other one and
S0558	seventy thousand pound or whatever
S0517	absolutely and then there's all that
S0558	and there's
S0517	so they'd have to choose together which house they're go to buy
S0558	yeah
S0517	decide how they want to decorate it i mean that's a marry couple thing that's not a brother and sister thing
S0558	exactly
S0517	and and the brother's girlfriend
S0558	no
S0517	i mean that's just not
S0558	i say to i say what if sort of cos of be 's girlfriend and all the rest of it start sort like just be as she would in any house but like do things for her and
S0517	things yeah
S0558	and all the rest of it 's go to be kind of a a
S0517	the spare part
S0558	the spare part
S0517	mm
S0558	i say it's not gonna work
S0517	no and the next thing you know
S0558	it's not gonna work
S0517	she'll fall pregnant and it'll be a disaster
S0558	mm
S0517	no i wouldn't
S0558	no no no
S0517	do it that way either but erm
S0558	no no i need to speak to about this i need to say look i'd give this some think it's not gonna work
S0517	no i mean absolutely give them both money that they can put towards a deposit
S0558	they would be better off they would be better off i'm gonna say to her you would be better off put whatever money you're gonna give them to one side yeah but split it in half
S0517	mm
S0558	if you're gonna give them ten grand or a deposit for a house that's five grand each short term they rent something until they be
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	in a position
S0517	to buy
S0558	to buy
S0517	to say
S0558	and then they've get five grand towards their deposit then
S0517	mm
S0558	but
S0517	cos you need a huge deposit these days don't you
S0558	yes be it like fifteen grand
S0517	oh i know
S0558	but then she say which i think be oh she say i think what we're gonna do to start with for the first couple of years so that at the end of each month they don't feel like depress cos they've get no money we're gonna go on an interest only mortgage
S0517	oh no
S0558	i know
S0517	can you still get those
S0558	well say she'll be
S0517	i didn't think you
S0558	they'll be lucky if they get one now
S0517	i didn't think they be still i didn't think they be still an option because they cause so many problems didn't they people couldn't
S0558	mm
S0517	get to the end and couldn't afford the
S0558	see and
S0517	i don't know i've not look into them but
S0558	when when they move to the house they're in in wales
S0517	mm
S0558	they go on an interest only because it be a bite more than they could afford but erm her sister live in a huge house in and erm
S0517	oh that's why cos her sister's there
S0558	well yeah and i'm down the road
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	she's not be very well of late she's suffer quite with depression quite
S0517	oh have she
S0558	of late cos i say well why if 's work in there's some beautiful villages i say i wouldn't live in itself
S0517	oh no
S0558	it's vile i say but closer to there be some nice villages
S0517	mm
S0558	about and that i say but then i suppose you're kind of gonna be on your own
S0517	i suppose to cos it's that much further north than us
S0558	oh yeah
S0517	it's only gonna be half an hour isn't it
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	forty minutes something like
S0558	yeah it's not hard
S0517	so it's not
S0558	no
S0517	that's not a bad journey
S0558	yeah
S0517	and if her sister's there like you're say and you're only
S0558	sister's there
S0517	ten minutes this way
S0558	at least she's get a little bite of
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	support not that she'll need support cos she get no kid any but in the way they're relations
S0517	well i know but then she won't know anyone will she so it's quite a bite thing still to move area and
S0558	it's still quite a big thing
S0517	cos without the kid there you don't there's your
S0558	you don't get to meet people
S0517	your link to to make to make friends isn't it
S0558	and she can't be reliant on me and
S0517	no no
S0558	cos we've still get kid and be run here there and everywhere
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	and
S0517	yeah
S0558	we're at a different stage
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	of live aren't we so she can't think oh i'll move there because
S0517	mm
S0558	i can see twice a week and
S0517	no no
S0558	twice a week and that'll fill my week cos that's not gonna happen
S0517	will she get a job
S0558	probably she'll
S0517	so that that'll help
S0558	look for a job
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	yeah she'll look for a job
S0517	oh okay
S0558	cos she's look in wales and she's just not have much luck just want a job
S0517	i imagine the job market's not great there though be it
S0558	no ideally she want something erm because of the operation on her hips on her hip
S0517	mm
S0558	erm she can't the the job she's come from be you know when you go into like debenhams and stock up the jewellery or you know wherever and do
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	do the jewellery top up and that be an awful lot of work on her knees
S0517	oh
S0558	cod and you know
S0517	mm
S0558	rehanging
S0517	oh that's no good
S0558	different things you know so that's absolutely no good for her she can't do that and it involve a lot of drive which if she sit for any major length of time she have terrible problems with her hip
S0517	mm
S0558	so erm she get a little bite of restriction really she can't sort of sit for too long she's better off
S0517	oh okay
S0558	be a little bite mobile
S0517	yes well
S0558	she's just look for something part time
S0517	part time
S0558	really
S0517	they're the hard ones cos everyone want that don't they
S0558	yeah
S0517	have you hear how 's get on with her job

S0558	lower sixth
S0517	yeah

S0517	okay
S0558	or issue
S0517	mm
S0558	and i suppose you be of an age there aren't you where oh well i don't know be drug as
S0517	mm yeah
S0558	big
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know where the i don't know erm for whatever reason but i always remember she be a lovely lovely lady she be but she be permanently onsite and
S0517	mm
S0558	and she have this little office
S0517	have a little
S0558	at the end of the corridor
S0517	yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	mm
S0558	she be lovely
S0517	but anyway i don't actually think be a girl trap in a boy's body
S0558	no not
S0517	i've never see more of a boy
S0558	no no if he be bring a lot of male friends home then you know you'd have reason to be concern but no i don't think you're gonna have any worry there
S0517	i dunno i don't know
S0558	oh bless them bless them it make you wonder doesn't it
S0517	yeah
S0558	how they're gonna turn out what job they're gonna be do you know
S0517	oh goodness know have you do i ask you about 's work experience have i ask you that
S0558	no
S0517	because you know they have to do it don't they in in this year
S0558	yes cos 's be talk about sort of possibilities
S0517	what do he what doesn't really know
S0558	see the problem be doesn't like don't really know what they wanna do for a live
S0517	what he want to know so it's hard to know isn't it
S0558	so i think we've just get to look upon this work experience of just put them in a work day
S0517	cos i do work experience and i have a bore week well because you're sixteen and they don't give you anything to do do they
S0558	no no
S0517	you just sit there
S0558	yeah but i think just expose them to er strange people people they don't know
S0517	yeah i suppose so
S0558	all that
S0517	and be able to get on with it yeah
S0558	even yeah
S0517	i suppose so
S0558	be part of it
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	i think have if he want to he could go and work on one of his sit
S0558	yeah
S0517	for a week
S0558	that's a good idea
S0517	and he have
S0558	could go as well
S0517	yeah he have ask the manager of if he could would he mind have not shadow him for a week cos he wouldn't he'd put him in with different
S0558	put him in yeah
S0517	people each day
S0558	that's very
S0517	so he could do that
S0558	good idea i've say to about potentially obviously the hospice i don't know what he'd do
S0517	mm
S0558	erm he couldn't go with because of the nature of the work
S0517	no
S0558	and he would just end up end sit there all day
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	do nothing erm
S0517	it be hard to know isn't it
S0558	you know when you think who who do you know who's in business that he could ask
S0517	well we be try to think of we be we be go along all those line
S0558	yeah
S0517	all of our friends and their occupations and some be do you fancy this do you fancy that but no no well what do that involve
S0558	yeah
S0517	doesn't really know what the involve so
S0558	no i say you could go and stop at auntie 's for a week and do some work with uncle but that's not go to develop him as a person be it
S0517	no no
S0558	and that's what he need
S0517	it's what say can i not follow you mum you just sit at home all day
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	no you can't
S0558	cos i say to you wouldn't be able to come out with me again because you're not you wouldn't be able to i don't know
S0517	no i don't know
S0558	he's actually he's older than sixteen so he's old enough to play
S0517	yeah so yeah yeah
S0558	so whether he's find it really bore
S0517	no this be it you want them to have a little go at do something they might possibly
S0558	yeah
S0517	enjoy don't you
S0558	i say you could always go over to school as a last resort
S0517	to school
S0558	yeah over there
S0517	oh really oh
S0558	as a last resort
S0517	yeah yeah wouldn't fancy that
S0558	erm
S0517	well we'll see maybe he will go to one of 's holiday park for a week i don't know
S0558	god he'd love that
S0517	he probably would could run the erm what's the thing in tree the high rope
S0558	probably wouldn't let him

S0517	yes
S0558	you could barely hear do you know what i mean but i want to say well well actually no if you're not happy with it you don't have to put up with it
S0517	no but she do i mean in fairness i think go to 's quite a lot too
S0558	do she
S0517	yeah
S0558	where do live
S0558	so how do they meet be it work or
S0517	it wasn't work i can't remember now do you know i can't remember be it through a friend of a through a friend of i don't know
S0558	oh
S0517	i don't know
S0558	they're quite keen on each other
S0517	seem to be i mean it's be go on a while hasn't it now
S0558	a while hasn't it be they they be together before how long be they together before and 's wed
S0517	well
S0558	cos he's be travel hadn't and he
S0517	they'd only just get together when she go off to australia do you remember
S0558	that's right
S0517	they hadn't really spend any time together because they'd sort of get together but then he'd go off travel so they spend all that time skyping or on facetime
S0558	mm
S0517	and then she go off to to australia then that didn't work out
S0558	that's right
S0517	so she end up
S0558	go
S0517	visit him in china didn't she
S0558	that's right she do yeah
S0517	so that be i think that be just the year before wed
S0558	that's right
S0517	so when be the wed
S0558	and then she come back
S0517	she come back and then he surprise her for the wed
S0558	and then he come back for the wed didn't he
S0517	yeah and it they'll they'll they'll have be marry two years this this may
S0558	gosh
S0517	so
S0558	hasn't time go
S0517	i know so i suppose about three three years they've be together haven't they three and a half years
S0558	mm
S0517	yes cos they'd get together in the summer before the wed so
S0558	so i wonder if they'll sort of look at perhaps get somewhere to live together or
S0517	well i don't know i think that be maybe the hope
S0558	have get a good job be he settle in work and that
S0517	he's self employ he's erm
S0558	be it with his leggings or something
S0517	he's import these leggings but he's do very well at it cos apparently he's give up his job at now he have a job at the phone shop
S0558	mm
S0517	just i think that be only part time but just as a like a regular thing but his his leggings business be do very well he's vat register now so he's get a high whatever you have to have as turnover
S0558	what's so special about these leggings
S0517	i don't know i think it's just quantity rather that quality to be honest
S0558	have you have any
S0517	no i'm not a leggings wearer
S0558	who's he sell to
S0517	he sell them on ebay
S0558	oh just on ebay
S0517	apparently if you put them up in put put it up it come up
S0558	he's the top one
S0517	yeah i think so
S0558	what just put leggings
S0517	do you know i don't know i've never do but say he you know he's get a good rank on the internet he just he just er sell them on the internet so basically import them in cheap from china and just sell them off on ebay and his his turnover's huge
S0558	really
S0517	and he's vat register now but he look at do some some other business but he he hasn't tell us what it be yet but anyway so
S0558	so he's a bite of an entrepreneur
S0517	he be a bite of an entrepreneur i know he's be in touch with 's about patent something but again don't know what
S0558	don't know
S0517	he's keep it all a bite close to the chest at the moment erm
S0558	what's his family what's their background
S0517	erm he's get a sister his mum and dad be be divorce but they're er fairly recently i think do they split up while he be travel so i think last christmas cos obviously two christmases ago he be away for christmas but then last christmas not the one just go but the one before he come to us on christmas day in the afternoon to see and he be a little bite subdue i think and say afterwards i think he's just feel it cos this'll be the first christmas his mum and dad have be separate
S0558	separate
S0517	that he's be there for and she say i think he be a bite conscious that he'd come out to see and his sister have go to her boyfriend's leave the mum by herself so he didn't say long he be only there
S0558	no
S0517	an hour and then he go i don't can't even remember may have go back with him but er yeah so so i don't i don't know whether she's get another boyfriend or anything yet i haven't hear but so he just live with his mum
S0558	how old's his mum do you know
S0517	i think she's about our age
S0558	yeah be she mm

S0517	she's get she's get this huge cupboard in the hall and there's a oh i don't know some sort of funny pipe thing in there i'm not even sure where from and she'd it have have a little drip so she'd leave it with some newspaper down so one of my job be to check that
S0558	yeah
S0517	it wasn't drip or if it be she say it be really really tiny so it be nothing bad's gonna happen but obviously if that paper get damp
S0558	mm
S0517	change it this be one of my job anyway at the front of that cupboard she's get a tupperware with her birdseed in cos you know what she's like
S0558	oh
S0517	for feed the bird and the lady in the flat behind be come in to fill up all mother's birdfeeders
S0558	right
S0517	so
S0558	bless
S0517	so she have the seed in a tupperware but then she'd buy in a big bag in bulk because it be
S0558	mm
S0517	on offer and that's just in like a like
S0558	like the hessian type plastic
S0517	like plastic like not even yeah just plastic bag really
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	and there be a bite of there there be that be inside a carrier bag and the carrier be a bite erm shred and inside the bag of seed be the bits of carrier bag and i put my hand at the back to check that the paper wasn't damp and the paper the newspaper be a bite shred and i think
S0558	oh
S0517	oh no
S0558	it's gonna live in the bag of seed
S0517	there's gonna be a mouse so i wasn't sure there be no droppings anywhere and she have a stack of newspaper should i have need it that wasn't touch
S0558	right
S0517	and she also have some toilet roll in there that be in a in a like a pack of nine or whatever unopened but that hadn't be touch either so i just wasn't sure anyway i come away but a couple of days later i go back with a tin to put the the the seed
S0558	the bag yeah
S0517	that be just in a carrier bag inside the tin
S0558	yeah
S0517	and i think okay i'll i'll put that in there the other big of seed in a in a tupperware so you know no there's no other food no other food anywhere and i do go back and and it be just that it be as i have leave it so part of me think maybe a mouse come think mm seed isn't for me and hasn't bother come back
S0558	and go
S0517	cos i don't know do mice eat seed i mean it's birdseed
S0558	oh yeah
S0517	do they but it be alright i clean it up
S0517	i clean it all up and i've put into the tin and and that be saturday and i haven't be back since but i send her a a just an email say no you haven't get a mouse mum don't worry about it it's fine
S0558	well i i
S0517	so
S0558	i get some bird food once can't remember what container it be in now but i take the lid off and there be two little mice go
S0558	in the shed we use to get them regular in the shed
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know cos these
S0517	well

S0517	when we have our playhouse and first start put seed out there be a
S0558	yeah
S0517	there be a mouse under the so i be oh i i don't want that just

S0517	oh i know they be
S0558	i know they're vermin and spread disease but they're they're get you know they've get to live
S0517	but anyway so i'm just keep an eye on that
S0558	mm
S0517	i'm just keep an eye on that
S0558	yeah cos it what where why would you need toilet roll or paper if you've get seed to sleep amongst and just
S0517	well it's probably in the tin now then yeah who know anyway it didn't appear to be i didn't see it
S0558	do you empty the bag into the tin

S0558	oh and there be no visible hole
S0517	well it be open the bag be open
S0558	oh
S0517	at the top so and there be a bite of shred carrier bag inside it be obviously it she'd obviously have buy the bag
S0558	see but he might have get in

S0558	and he can't get out so he might have die anyway might have get in
S0517	yeah
