S0018	where be i huh
S0049	um so he's just invest in somebody
S0018	oh yeah okay so he's just invest in this guy who make those magnetic board for dyslexic students
S0049	how long how long ago be that
S0018	quite recent i don't know noisy aeroplane um tut and so you know i imagine that he's get stockpile of cash that he's will to invest in people um and i tell about your candle and the wax and the organic
S0049	ah
S0018	you can put it on your skin afterwards and
S0049	and what do she say
S0018	and i tell her what else do i say oh i tell her about the exfoliator that you can um
S0049	dry it off
S0018	yeah that
S0049	yeah
S0018	yeah that's oil base not well gel base not shower cream base and she sound really oo that's what a novel product
S0049	oh do she
S0018	and i explain all about your skin problems and that be you know the one of the impetuses behind
S0049	oh
S0018	you set up your business and yeah so she say give him a call or send him a text message to see if at least you know you can get er meet up and
S0049	that'd be great
S0018	if
S0049	where do they live
S0018	they live in
S0049	oh okay so close
S0018	not far from me yeah
S0049	okay brilliant
S0018	mm and so i don't know he i know he's quite busy but maybe one of the days when you haven't get
S0049	yeah
S0018	we could go round together and
S0049	mm that'd be great hon cos i've um today i've i've just send off to
S0018	mhm
S0049	all the label she send send me them all through so she send all the label but there be load of um tut change for instance there be she'd put and sign instead of the cross sign and things like that and um oh well i'll show you so i've just send those and then i've just e mail somebody about a stamp because i don't know the best way to do it because honest logo it's get honest then the facial range have get the brown line the body's get the green line the body's um tut candle have get the orange line but i don't want to buy three separate stamp with three different colour cos it's gonna cost a fortune
S0018	mm
S0049	so i've just e mail this stamp company to say could i have a stamp pad with three line in and then just honest logo on its own because obviously i can't sell a candle in a bag stamp with the with the green line or the brown line do you see what i mean
S0018	yeah so how would that work would you the three colour bar be separate to the logo
S0049	the logo be the line be be the colour so for instance when someone buy a candle it come in the cotton bag it'll be stamp with the honest logo but in between the honest and the website there's a line and that will be orange because the candle the home range be orange um
S0018	but how do you stamp if you're gonna get a stamp with the logo and three different colour line ah okay so you'd
S0049	so you'd choose your colour and then
S0018	yeah yeah yeah okay
S0049	so i've gotta see how much that come back as at and then
S0018	have you get a provider for that have you get a supplier
S0049	um yeah well i've just e mail them now
S0018	okay
S0049	so um i think it'll be about fifteen pound i think which isn't bad and it's gonna be better than print bag it's gonna be more expensive to print
S0018	yeah
S0049	the only problem i've get be be the ink go to run into the cotton bag cos they're fine on the box
S0018	yeah be there none
S0049	so
S0018	that you can get that you can iron them and that fix the ink
S0049	oh i don't know i'll see what she i do i do put in the e mail that um
S0018	uh huh
S0049	tut um that i need it for cotton bag and box so i'll see what she say anyway and then on another good note at jigsaw who's my friend have ask me to go in on a saturday
S0018	mhm

S0018	yeah
S0049	so i can be out on the road sell
S0018	yeah yeah
S0049	than make everything up when he's already get everything and it might work out a little bite cheaper

S0049	in harrogate yeah
S0018	yorkshire
S0049	yeah so uh
S0018	and you'd make all the stuff up
S0049	er oh sorry hon he would um i'd give him my jar and bottle my formulations and then he would er make it all and send it back to me
S0018	brilliant
S0049	so that might be
S0018	and what do he want in return for that
S0049	i'll obviously pay him but normally what he do be he he er he's in product development he'll so for instance if i say right say imagine i didn't have enough time to develop my men's range i could say right this be what i want this be what i want in it can you develop it for me and then he would make it all up and so he's get a factory and his website be nice

S0049	i know so i'll see what i'm gonna e mail him er him in a bite with um maybe a face cream a cleanser um and a body lotion
S0018	mhm
S0049	and then get a price for a hundred so then i kinda know er you know cos it's gonna huh you know if if someone do invest and say it give me four five grand to buy all my ingredients it might only cost me two grand to get them make up with him

S0018	mhm
S0049	i think babe with um a mattress because i'm not sure how much they be but um i don't really know where else to get them from because they're so expensive aren't they
S0018	mm haven't your parent get a spare bed or anything

S0018	that cheap one you could probably paint it where be it that one
S0049	oh that one
S0018	you could probably paint it um cos it's more about important the mattress isn't it and if you've get a duvet or something that hang over it you
S0049	mm

S0018	uh huh
S0049	and the the side of the the thingies pull up and down but they don't come off
S0018	oh right if you could take them off would that be possible
S0049	er yeah i think well yeah er probably not big enough actually to be honest now
S0018	oh really
S0049	she's come up to two now cos this will last her now till she's five

S0049	i think i need to because and the other thing be she's get so many toy that she doesn't really play with most of them because she's get so many
S0018	mm
S0049	so um i think it's time to make it into a pretty girly room
S0018	how be you gonna do that
S0049	i dunno i think i've get a lovely chest of drawers at my mum's in the container which be mine it's white you know like the and er i love they're white and they've get the pattern on
S0018	mhm
S0049	so i think i'll get that to come over here then get her a white bed and we'll have lot of floral things go on i'll get some flag for around the room pink
S0018	lovely
S0049	yeah
S0018	be you gonna keep that lampshade though it's

S0018	lovely really nice
S0049	yeah i'd like to put load of flower on that you know like um
S0018	mm
S0049	you know like the flower i've put in the garden on the tree
S0018	yeah
S0049	so yeah and now she's get a little table bless her it's a chalk table so she can write on it in chalk
S0018	oh fantastic
S0049	i know
S0049	bless her
S0018	what a novel idea
S0018	can i have a go
S0049	yeah oh let me just get that paperwork so you can see it
S0018	yeah
S0049	what i've do be i've i've put huh for instance here's all the oil
S0018	oh be this for the cost
S0049	yeah so
S0018	so these be these be break down by product
S0049	well what i've do so i've put all the ingredients so these be all the oil
S0018	uh huh
S0049	the size i buy it in
S0018	uh huh
S0049	and the cost
S0018	uh huh
S0049	that's without vat my peel grain then i've get like my these be the fat and preservative then i've get my vitamins um more moisturizers but i don't know if he's gonna understand because and then i've get essential oil organic and non organic
S0018	but be those the things that go into i mean be that the ingredients for one particular product
S0049	no because what i've do then so i've get all my ingredients emulsifiers clays floral water then i've get every single product
S0018	ah okay
S0049	so i've get body polish what go into it
S0018	uh huh
S0049	lips what go er and the amount
S0018	uh huh
S0049	that go into it body lotion what go into it and the amount
S0018	mhm
S0049	and i've do that for all my products
S0018	wow you've be busy
S0049	but i don't know if he's if that's i don't really know how else because what we need to do we need to take say body lotion
S0018	mhm
S0049	and we go thistle oil
S0018	ah okay i see
S0049	you get your thistle oil five hundred mil for five pound sixty so you need to work out how much one mil be
S0018	yeah
S0049	so we need to divide so get the price for that and then we need to time it er one mil by four
S0018	yeah
S0049	which give us the price for the thistle oil
S0018	yeah
S0049	do you see what i mean
S0018	yeah
S0049	it's gonna it's such a hard long job it's i think it it definitely i remember when i do it before i i just it's so confuse but i don't know if that's gonna be enough for him to
S0018	i'm sure it will be yeah
S0049	um
S0018	be these in millilitres
S0049	yeah and for instance everything's in mil
S0018	mhm
S0049	except for essential oil so obviously everything's get essential oil in so on tea tree lavender lemon essential oil i've get three drop two drop two drop because this these be all make a hundred mil
S0018	right and how many er
S0049	so they all add up to a hundred
S0018	so where you've get your for example when you buy your bottle of lemon essential oil how many drop be in each bottle do you know
S0049	um okay so say let's think about this then if i buy lemon essential oil thirty mil be seven pound ninety so thirty mil one mil of essential oil be twenty four drop
S0018	okay
S0049	so
S0018	so it's twenty four time thirty which be mm seven hundred and twenty so you get seven hundred and twenty drop out of a thirty mil bottle
S0049	i'm sure it's twenty four drop because nought point six mil be twelve drop
S0018	wait there sorry you say a thirty mil bottle how many drop in one mil
S0049	one mil be twenty four drop
S0018	so it'd be twenty four time three two four six seventy two add a add a zero on seven hundred and twenty no
S0049	oh i dunno babe
S0049	god it's just do my head in
S0018	no but
S0049	um
S0018	i think you've get all the raw data there that he'll need to be able to do the
S0049	but this isn't include vat i just haven't have time to and the only other thing the only things i need to do be my three cleansers now
S0018	mhm
S0049	cos the formulation's change so i've get to do those but um you know like preservative there i've get nought point six mil of preservative which be yeah twelve drop
S0018	mhm
S0049	um you know eighteen drop of grapefruit three gram it's like it's just er it's just it confuse me
S0018	well as long as you've get on the original sheet how the quantities in which you buy it
S0049	mm
S0018	and the price of that i mean he can
S0049	so um er the next thing i need to do for him now er be find the price of my bottle
S0018	mhm
S0049	and i don't know the the price of my label yet until um
S0018	mm of course
S0049	it all go through and i'm i reckon they'll all be about between nine and eleven p a label
S0018	okay
S0049	but i'm not a hundred percent yet but we can always add that on
S0018	so it's you've put the cost and then with vat vat be vat just that the cost plus
S0049	vat
S0018	what be it seventeen point point five percent
S0049	yeah yeah so um and the thing be on some of them they're class as food so you don't get charge you don't get charge vat
S0018	oh okay
S0049	um so i've get oil vitamins these be like um moisturizers essential oil organic and non organic emulsifiers and clays floral water and for instance i haven't really i should put on the on water as well from like how much be that water that just cost you
S0018	sixty eight p
S0049	for for one litre of water so i need to put that on as well but obviously this doesn't include when lara do some cost for me this doesn't include anything electrical
S0018	mm
S0049	anything you know heat my time or anything do it so
S0018	but it's a good idea to get an idea of what the cost be for each particular bottle for example
S0049	yeah
S0018	like if you say okay i've get a bottle of cleanse lotion i'm sell it at this price and
S0049	yeah
S0018	what it take to make it cost this much
S0049	cos my old cleanser cost me one pound seventy nine to make but it only have three ingredients in cos in this new cleanser's get say ten ingredients in er so and also all these add up to a hundred cos i work in a hundred percent but i sell body polish in two hundred and fifty mil
S0018	mhm
S0049	i sell my lip balm in fifteen mil body lotion sell in two fifty mil do you see what i mean so it's so if it's body lotion
S0018	mm
S0049	it's that time that again time half isn't it
S0018	yeah well maybe what would be a good idea be that when we organize to meet you know er to chat about the investment
S0049	yeah
S0018	that we maybe go and see my dad at the same time cos he
S0049	yeah
S0018	just live round the corner
S0049	okay hon
S0018	and you can explain all this to him and he can ask you the question
S0049	yeah
S0018	that he need to ask
S0049	okay
S0018	to be able to manipulate it all into some kind of
S0049	when do you think er
S0018	coherent
S0049	yeah when do you think we could do that i'm try to think
S0018	well it'll depend on when 's free cos i know he's he's busier than
S0049	mm
S0018	my dad
S0049	yeah i've get to i've get to give all these cost to that woman in a week and a half
S0018	really
S0049	because i don't want her really go through it because
S0018	uh huh
S0049	i don't know i just don't i'm not comfortable
S0018	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0049	um see i can always give it to him next door because he's say he would do it
S0018	uh huh
S0049	i mean i could give it him and see what i could photocopy this couldn't i and just see he might if he's free he might be able to do this in a day
S0018	well or if you want i'll
S0049	if he understand
S0018	i'll see my dad tomorrow i could give him what you've get
S0049	do you think he's gonna understand though if i'm not with if i haven't speak to him
S0018	well if you phone him
S0049	i'm try to think if he can um i just hope i've make it clear enough
S0018	what else have you get to do tomorrow
S0049	tomorrow i'm just i'm just work here really tomorrow um i'm just home
S0018	cos if you wanna come over to with me at about midday
S0049	okay
S0018	i'm pretty sure he's free tomorrow
S0049	be he
S0018	you could sit down and er
S0049	go through stuff with him
S0018	yep then at least you're on you know you're you can er probably communicate better face to face than over the phone and with some paper
S0049	yeah it would be better to see him
S0018	mm
S0049	see i could i could i be think about put um tut jane off anyway but er
S0018	be this the dragon's den lady
S0049	yeah
S0049	but she meet my mum last week and she say she's get some really good um she's be speak to some people and she's er apparently mum say wait till you hear what she's do

S0018	uh huh
S0049	er she it be really hard to get hold of but she's manage to get it and stuff that so she's really try to help me
S0049	so
S0018	but this stuff's nearly do don't worry about show it to her cos then you know
S0049	yeah
S0018	probably by next week you can have it all do and dust and send it off to her before she actually need it which will be impressive
S0049	it will won't it babe
S0018	hyper organize and then that give you time to find out you know to price your bottle and
S0049	yeah
S0018	the pipettes and
S0049	that's it yeah
S0018	with the label
S0049	i've cos i've have a row with who i get my um um bottle and jar off

S0049	then if i know they're come then i'll make sure that the driver's get the code to the gate to get into the house and i could've leave the box outside or make sure mum be there or something and then they say so eventually i get this really snotty um phonecall off um one of the women there um basically blame me and i say hang on this isn't my fault you've send me the wrong products you've ask to pick the box up but you've just send a driver you've not even speak to me about it i say you know i'm not there twenty four seven and then and now you're tell me that you want me to pay for the postage to send all this back i say it's gonna cost me about thirty forty pound i say no um you know this be your fault she go it be not our fault er anyway
S0049	she be horrible and er i felt so horrible the way she be speak to me and then um you know when you get all anxious and i couldn't believe

S0018	superior
S0049	god well i know the guy that own the company and he's just as bad i ask him a year ago over a year ago for a machine right because i when my label come to me now i need something that i can put my bottle in and my label stick on because

S0049	and that be him the owner you know so argh
S0018	what a way to run a business
S0049	yep
S0018	so what do you need do with this now you just basically need er someone to calculate all the different price cost of each
S0049	yeah
S0018	product
S0049	so i guess your dad will say i mean let's just do one for example
S0018	yeah yeah yeah

S0018	it's just a formula though isn't it as soon as you
S0049	mm
S0018	get the formula make logical sense
S0049	just er it's just head do it's just really um
S0018	hm i find it easier to write it down as well
S0049	right let me get um
S0018	if you get some paper we can actually just like er we can probably work it out with a calculator and a pen and a paper

S0018	and then we can put a star by the ones that er be exempt from vat
S0049	okay i'm really cold i need to put um i try not to put the heat on
S0018	no it's a good idea get a blanket wear it like a sari oh be that the scarf you're sell
S0049	yeah
S0018	don't sell it it's lovely
S0049	mm i know
S0018	aw
S0049	okay so um let's just take um
S0018	what's
S0049	so these be the ingredients
S0018	mhm
S0049	okay so you hold the ingredients right so say we start on um calm face mask
S0018	okay so you've get be that camomile water
S0049	yeah so camomile water floral water oh i haven't get the price for that one
S0018	it's not on here
S0049	no because that's a new let's see how much that be
S0018	do you get all your ingredients from the same supplier
S0049	no tut um
S0018	so
S0049	i'll just get the um
S0018	do you want me to write it down here
S0049	one litre
S0018	wait there where's the water water
S0049	one litre
S0018	how much be one litre
S0049	be eight pound
S0018	so here you've get six millilitres
S0049	six mil right
S0018	so how many mil in one litre a hundred
S0049	a thousand
S0018	oh a thousand i have no idea
S0049	a a thousand yeah
S0018	yeah
S0049	a thousand yeah
S0018	okay
S0049	confuse me then so
S0018	so if you've get a thousand so it's how much be it
S0049	um er um eight pound so a thousand
S0018	if you do eight pound divide by a thousand
S0049	er i need a different er er okay so eight pound
S0018	divide by
S0049	divide by
S0018	a thousand and then time it by wait there what's er six millilitres go into it do it where's the
S0049	um
S0018	oh here sorry
S0049	oh no
S0018	oh no er oh yeah here it be six millilitres so time that by six so it cost you nought point nought five p
S0049	um camomile nought point nought four eight
S0018	round it up just do two digital er two decimal place
S0049	so just two so just
S0018	nought point nought point nought five
S0049	just do five o
S0018	nought point nought five yeah
S0049	nought five
S0018	yeah because cos that's higher than five just
S0049	oh okay
S0018	put the next number up in fact we're lower than five
S0049	oh right yeah
S0018	you'd just keep it to
S0049	okay
S0018	nought point nought four
S0049	so nought point nought five okay
S0018	okay the next one be water
S0049	okay so um
S0049	you just buy that water
S0018	er you can get it cheaper though if you buy it in bulk i reckon
S0049	okay
S0018	if you get like er a pack of six you could probably even get organic water from somewhere if they do
S0049	let's just see on here
S0018	if they do organic sparkle water i'm sure they must do organic spring water check out on asda
S0049	oh let's just
S0018	maybe they be just um out of
S0049	i just i've never really er
S0018	out of stock oh highland spring
S0049	if you buy organic water you're a fuck idiot
S0018	excuse your french look on highland spring cos they're they be the ones that do the organic sparkle water so maybe they they do still as well have they get a page for the organic range what be that there mm
S0049	highland spring still
S0018	yeah it doesn't say if it's organic though cos they definitely do have a a range of organic water check out highland spring organic maybe
S0049	oh tesco hm
S0018	oh yeah look
S0049	oh here yeah
S0018	cos if you buy that in bulk i'm sure it'll cost a lot less than it would if you're buy it bottle by bottle in the supermarket
S0049	okay so for five hundred mil sixty five p
S0018	wait there let me write that down
S0049	um
S0018	five hundred mil sixty five p
S0049	so just say for a litre it's gonna be one pound twenty and i reckon we'll get it cheaper than that
S0018	litre one pound
S0049	one pound twenty
S0018	twenty
S0049	just to be safe
S0018	okay so here you've get forty mils of water so if one litre be one pound twenty so divide one one pound twenty by a thousand and then time it by forty so that's gonna cost you four point eight p for the water then the preservative um nought point six mils
S0049	see what i should be do now because preservative be use in all products instead of keep on do this
S0018	yeah
S0049	i've what we should do be um tut we should maybe find out the price for each ingredient just the price for for one mil
S0018	yeah
S0049	do you think
S0018	yeah yeah cos then you can
S0049	and then i can add it up
S0049	that's how i do it before because otherwise we're gonna keep go back on ourselves aren't we
S0018	mm
S0049	because we're gonna have to do preservative twenty eight time
S0018	you see that's where my dad can probably do something nifty with an excel wordsheet
S0049	mm yeah
S0018	er spreadsheet and um be able to just put in a formula
S0049	yeah
S0018	whereby it'll calculate it all
S0049	well we'll keep we'll do this one first babe and see what this one come out as anyway
S0018	okay
S0049	so um water be four point eight so preservative twelve
S0018	where have it get
S0049	um
S0018	wait there have you get the price there or have i get them here
S0049	um hm
S0018	where be they
S0049	oh i'm all confuse right okay so price price
S0018	there you go
S0049	price
S0018	so those be the price of the
S0049	what's that one then
S0018	ingredients
S0049	and that's that's um so preservative twelve
S0018	oh well let's just write that still still um organic water
S0049	okay so for for um a hundred mil it's seven pound ninety
S0018	a hundred mil
S0049	so what do i do i go seven pound ninety
S0018	yeah cos if you
S0049	divide by a hundred
S0018	if a hundred mil be seven pound ninety you wanna find out what one mil be so you're um divide seven ninety by a hundred
S0049	yeah
S0018	yeah and then time it by the amount of millilitres you need in the product
S0049	so it's one so it's that isn't it
S0018	preservative twelve that be no you need nought point six
S0049	oh nought point six
S0049	oh for one mil isn't it yeah nought point six be one mil
S0018	nought point six what though
S0049	but then
S0018	millilitres
S0049	mil yeah so see this be i'm a bite confuse now cos by aromantic law you're suppose to use er this be nought point six mil but 's change my um tox report so i have to use a mil but i'm not use a mil because i don't want to
S0018	why do he say
S0049	just to cover with like eu regulations but
S0018	well er surely that mean you have to use the amount that they specify
S0049	but aromantic be say that you don't have to you see so and there's be a big thing er aromantic have speak to about this and they've
S0018	mhm
S0049	have i dunno what's go on but er so
S0018	's the guy that do your tox report
S0049	yeah
S0018	uh huh
S0049	so um i can really use up to one percent if i want so in a hundred percent i'd use up to one percent which would be one mil so if i say because my mask have get water in it there's more chance of contamination so i think i should do my price all base on one mil of preservative
S0018	okay
S0049	just in case
S0018	okay
S0049	that's i think that's what i'll do
S0018	yeah that's a good idea
S0049	do you think
S0018	yeah
S0049	because and then if i use less i use less
S0018	yeah
S0049	but i know that i'm not gonna use any more than one mil don't i
S0018	mhm
S0049	do you think that make sense
S0018	yeah definitely so that's be that nought point nought
S0049	okay so what i'll do then so if i've write here
S0018	so it be one millilitre and
S0049	um i'm confuse babe
S0018	be it seven seven pound ninety for one litre
S0049	for a hundred mil
S0018	for a hundred mil
S0049	yeah
S0018	okay
S0049	so seven pound
S0049	ninety
S0018	divide by a hundred
S0049	divide by a hundred
S0018	time one which be nought
S0049	yeah so so nought point seven nine
S0018	nought point zero eight
S0049	nought point zero eight okay nought point zero eight okay tut
S0049	huh
S0018	next ingredient be white clay
S0049	okay
S0018	er where be the clays here so white clay be twenty five what's that
S0049	two hundred and fifty
S0018	oh
S0049	grams one eighty five that's just
S0018	two fifty grams one eighty five
S0049	so two hundred and fifty
S0018	two fifty
S0049	divide by one pound eighty five
S0018	yeah and then time the amount you need in the
S0049	that's go like that though
S0018	product oh do you
S0049	um
S0018	do you oh no divide by
S0049	one pound eighty five divide by
S0018	divide by
S0049	two hundred and fifty
S0018	and then time it by fifty nought point three seven and the last one be apricot kernel oil six millilitres
S0049	okay tut um
S0018	which be apricot kernel oil
S0049	so
S0018	a hundred mil for six twenty five six twenty five divide by a hundred time six that's nought point three eight
S0049	okay that's it isn't it that go into that
S0018	yep that's all
S0049	so when we add that up that's hardly anything to be honest let's have a look so
S0018	do you wanna tell me er
S0049	nought point
S0018	or shall i
S0049	nought five
S0018	plus four point eight plus nought point nought eight plus nought point three seven plus nought point three eight equal five pound sixty eight be that how much it cost wait there no we've do it wrong
S0049	what
S0018	cos that er the water wasn't it can't ah this be pence
S0049	yeah
S0018	so
S0049	but no that's not right four that's not right be it
S0018	four point eight pence you've get a dot between you've get a point
S0049	four four point eight yeah
S0018	yeah
S0049	so i've get nought point
S0018	nought five
S0049	nought five
S0018	plus
S0049	plus
S0018	four point eight
S0049	that seem a lot four point eight doesn't it for water
S0018	but you need wait there
S0049	no it can't be right
S0018	you need forty millilitres and one litre one litre be one pound twenty be it no one litre be wait there i write it down one litre be one pound twenty
S0049	yeah and if the camomile's only nought point nought five
S0018	be you sure there's only be you sure there's a thousand
S0049	yeah a thousand mil
S0018	millilitres in a litre
S0049	thousand mil in a litre
S0018	that would make sense
S0049	cos five hundred mil be a bottle like this
S0018	yeah no that would make sense
S0018	cos it's millilitre isn't it mil mean thousand
S0049	yeah
S0018	so what's
S0049	so um
S0018	so
S0049	so if um the water let's just tut
S0018	the water be one pound twenty for a litre so one twenty time by
S0049	one pound twenty
S0018	er divide by a thousand time by
S0049	forty
S0018	yep forty equal nought point nought
S0049	oh yeah i think
S0018	five okay
S0049	okay
S0018	so put nought point nought five
S0049	nought point again you see that's er the same as that isn't it
S0018	yeah
S0049	oh okay babe so
S0049	nought point nought five
S0018	plus
S0049	plus nought point nought five
S0018	plus nought point nought eight
S0049	nought point nought eight
S0018	plus nought point three seven plus nought point three eight equal
S0049	ninety three p that's more like it
S0018	oh okay phew
S0049	so that's for ingredients then i've get bottle
S0018	mhm
S0049	i mean tut um jar lid label yeah okay so that's how we'd work it then
S0018	yeah yeah so what you really need be each ingredient divide by the number of millilitres that it come in
S0049	yeah see um
S0018	but again you can do that on excel really easily just
S0049	cos i've get my laptop work now
S0018	yeah
S0049	so i could get the um that would be easier for your dad in fact we could work this out i could do this today
S0018	yeah but i mean he do you know how to er make formulas for different columns of er of data
S0049	no
S0018	you see my dad's brilliant at stuff like that
S0049	be he
S0018	or what what we could do
S0049	well i could shall i um
S0018	what we could do be do it with him so he can
S0049	yeah
S0018	teach us how to do it and then you know if you have to change anything you'd be
S0049	cos what i might just
S0018	in the know
S0049	quickly be we still record
S0018	huh yeah
S0049	mm hello
S0049	um
S0018	but it be a monumental task that's why i think it's much better if if dad find a way
S0049	cos especially with his um especially um with the with the um tut label and stuff
S0018	mhm
S0049	cos i'm just think that almond oil i could do some of these it give me it help me as well you see if i can
S0018	yeah
S0049	so a hundred mil three pound ten so i'd er just put three pound ten divide by a hundred
S0018	mhm
S0049	so it cost me nought point do i have to have the nought
S0018	er
S0049	or just put nought point nought would i put that to thirty
S0018	what do you mean sorry
S0049	would i have nought point nought three o if we be round it off
S0018	if you er you you have to round it you can't round it up because that last digit be not higher than five
S0049	okay
S0018	so what you just do be get rid of that last digit
S0049	oh okay babe
S0018	so it's nought point nought three
S0049	so you'd have nought point nought three okay so i'm gonna do this nought point nought three for one mil
S0018	so what's that nought point nought three pence
S0049	yeah
S0018	so put
S0049	for one mil
S0018	put p next to it just so that you
S0049	okay
S0018	you get it clear what it be
S0049	okay if i can just do some of these and then i'll shall we have a drink
S0018	yeah do you want do you wanna cuppa tea
S0049	a cuppa tea
S0018	shall i put the kettle on or would you prefer coffee
S0049	i dunno i might have a coffee actually do you wanna make it or do you want me to make it
S0018	no no no i'll make it
S0049	what about this
S0018	no it's fine
S0018	it's fine
S0049	it'll be funny though listen back to um
S0018	yeah
S0049	like do you listen back to 's conversation
S0018	no i didn't i just um listen to it quickly to just to work out what um the topics be cos i have to write a list of what topics
S0049	what be he talk about
S0018	gosh we be talk about load of things
S0018	lot of different things tv program er
S0049	he's quite interest isn't it
S0018	yeah no he's a good good talker
S0049	so on this one would i take away the five or have it nought point six three
S0018	um well basically how many decimal place do you want after the dot two no cos it's easier to work your head cos we're talk about pence
S0049	i i so don't understand babe okay yeah
S0018	so you just have two decimal place after the point yeah so if you want to round it up to three you'd round it up to nought point nought six three cos that's five or above
S0049	yeah
S0018	and so if you get nought point nought six three you wouldn't round the six up to seven because the three
S0049	right okay
S0018	be below five so it would be nought point nought six
S0049	okay nought point nought six
S0018	yeah
S0049	okay so i need to just really take off these two
S0018	yeah
S0049	off er off all the ones that i do
S0018	yeah but be careful because if you you can take them off but make sure you change that figure up one if the one next to it be be more than five
S0049	more than five okay i see
S0018	but it's not gonna make a huge difference cos you're you know even if you just make a mistake with a couple of them it's not gonna make a huge difference to your cost
S0049	okay
S0018	but it's good to be precise
S0049	yes so six pound ninety divide by a hundred see the other thing be if i be to buy a litre of almond oil i'd save pound
S0018	really
S0049	but because um these be like smaller
S0018	yeah
S0049	like the clay because i'm buy two hundred and fifty grams it's er a lot cheaper
S0018	so how much if a hundred millilitres of almond oil be three pound ten how much would like
S0049	a litre be
S0018	a litre be
S0049	i dunno you but you would save cos on the on the on your price you've get thirty mil a hundred mil um two fifty mil five hundred mil a thousand for all different price and then each one so imagine if i be buy that in litres
S0018	yeah
S0049	you'd save so much money wouldn't you
S0018	you'd probably be buy it at a quarter of the price wouldn't you per millilitre but you'll get there you'll get bigger you'll start make more profit and it'll start cost you less to make them
S0049	so that's gonna be nought point nought seven
S0049	isn't it
S0018	yep
S0049	you can tell i didn't pass maths at school
S0018	i don't know why you're learn quickly
S0018	then again i can't believe i'm teach maths cos
S0049	you're a teacher
S0018	yeah i know but english not maths
S0018	i'm awful i'm awful with number
S0049	oh no er you're clever you be
S0018	my dad'll probably turn around and say you've do this all wrong you tell her to divide it by a hundred and you need
S0049	no
S0018	to time it by a hundred
S0049	no you do it right
S0018	no what it be be i use to get pay by the hour
S0049	okay
S0018	so i'd always be work out how much i'd get pay and i'd do different type of class which be charge at different rat
S0018	and then i'd have to work out the um the tax that i'd have to pay and
S0018	so it be all about
S0049	what's that one babe i be listen to you
S0018	um you tell me
S0049	one nought point one seven
S0018	no you only round it up you wouldn't er
S0049	nought point two
S0018	you wouldn't round you wouldn't round it down start with like the the third figure be it above five
S0049	yeah
S0018	so what do you do to the second figure
S0049	so it'd be nought point one seven
S0018	yeah
S0049	okay i've gotta get the gist of this
S0018	but why why would you why would you make that six
S0049	because that's
S0018	into seven
S0049	because the eight be higher than five
S0018	yep yep
S0049	okay
S0018	that's the only logic you need to apply
S0049	how be i gonna teach ava when she go to school
S0018	hopefully they'll have teachers
S0018	that be pretty competent
S0049	god babe i can really smell garlic
S0018	huh huh
S0049	what do you eat
S0018	um um what be it chicken
S0049	be it nice
S0018	something oh it be gorgeous yeah it have ginger garlic
S0049	mm
S0018	as you can smell tomato er
S0049	have you see um tut ruchi
S0018	yeah she be out last night mhm
S0049	be she aw
S0018	she's better her hand be awful they're
S0049	be they
S0018	now they're a lot better now they've they're not as swell but they're all crack and dry and
S0049	see mine have come up
S0018	oo yeah
S0049	but
S0018	painful
S0049	they're not um this be good really
S0018	mhm
S0049	but they're but i've notice my hand be drier i don't know if it's the change in weather
S0018	mm
S0049	because your your skin do change and when you've get dermatitis your skin change and hormones but i wonder why hers be so bad cos they be quite bad last time i saw her
S0018	well it be cos she have er i think she have a bite of eczema under her wed ring
S0049	she's er allergic to her wed ring isn't she
S0018	i don't know whether it be that or whether it be just because the eczema be under a ring it start to fester i don't know
S0049	cos the the um people with dermatitis shouldn't wear any jewellery
S0018	right
S0049	even earrings
S0018	ah
S0049	because of the metal or like my engagement ring be platinum and i i didn't er react to it but that's why i don't wear any jewellery i haven't even get my ears pierce
S0018	mm
S0049	so she shouldn't wear any jewellery that's gonna affect it definitely
S0018	yeah well she have to wrap her hand in cling film every night
S0049	mm
S0049	aw that's what i have to do
S0018	tut aw
S0049	oh bless her
S0018	but she's get steroids and antibiotics
S0049	tut
S0018	and it's take away the infection um but
S0049	it's the worst thing you know
S0018	now her hand you know be
S0049	it's the worst thing to have
S0018	after you've have like swell tut infections
S0049	be they weep as well with water
S0018	not anymore i think they be but
S0049	oh god i feel so sorry for her er there's nothing she can do either
S0018	mm
S0049	but she definitely shouldn't you should tell her not to wear a wed ring honestly hon
S0018	mm
S0049	um and do you know like the past two months my hand haven't flare up and i think be she a be she a worrier do she worry be she anxious
S0018	mm not any more than er
S0049	than normal
S0018	mm
S0049	then that say because they er they reckon hand dermatitis be er and foot dermatitis be down to stress
S0018	really
S0049	the main thing and then if you're stress and then you use something like you could even use lavender
S0018	mhm
S0049	and you'd still react
S0018	mm
S0049	oh i feel so sorry for her and really when i use to wrap my hand up at night in cling film and cream and when i'd wake up in the morning the my hand be soak wet with water because my hand couldn't breathe
S0018	uh huh
S0049	so in a way i er maybe i should speak to her she should put bandage on
S0018	gauze
S0049	mm
S0018	or something like that
S0049	but i've get these lovely gloves from the doctor they're fifty pound a pair
S0018	be they silk
S0049	they're beautiful babe
S0049	so if she go to the doctor and i go and say you know i've hear about these gloves and she check the book she go god and they be fifty pound so she give me two pair but i've i don't know er otherwise i could i could give her a pair i've only get one pair at the moment cos i don't know where the other pair be i'll have a look in a minute and they're lovely you put them on and you just put your cream on and you can do lot of things round the house they're not like the cotton gloves because the cotton ones fall off they go baggy
S0049	but these ones be really nice
S0018	oh i'll tell her
S0049	i'll try and find them in a minute
S0018	what be they make out of
S0049	um i dunno they be a bite silky i don't know where they be they might be in the kitchen i'll have a look
S0018	yeah i can't imagine cling film would be the the best thing
S0049	cos cos it's hot make you hot
S0018	yeah yeah it sweat it all
S0049	and with dermatitis you you and er what happen be you itch it the blister come up then it swell so the skin look swell
S0018	mm
S0049	and then for er for it to get better you have to pop the blister
S0018	urgh
S0049	for the skin to come off to reheal so it's like um a vicious circle so they say to put steroid cream on and put the cling film on because it's gonna burst the blister but it doesn't it didn't work for me at all but the dermatologist they have to tell her that because the next step if it get worse be she'll go to the skin hospital and then that's their that's what they do you have to go through the process
S0018	mm
S0049	and then what they do at the skin hospital be you take in every single product that you use whether it be wash up skincare shower gel whatever and you go in this room and they put a tiny blob on your back
S0018	uh huh mm
S0049	and they cover it with tape and you're wrap up in tape and you leave it on for a week
S0018	mhm
S0049	so you can't shower for a week and then cos you can't get this these things wet and then they write on your back what what they be
S0018	god
S0049	and then you go back in a week's time and they take it all off and like with me i take all the dr hauschka products cos that's what i be use
S0018	mhm
S0049	and i react to er nearly every single one my skin have rise
S0018	huh
S0049	it be all red and my back be bad for months
S0018	oh no
S0049	after it have all come off cos i just wouldn't heal and then they show you then and then the so the one she'll react to they'll know which product it be then they'll take that product they'll get
S0018	mm
S0049	the ingredients from that product so even like lavender people think oh you won't react to lavender but i react to lavender
S0018	really
S0049	because lavender's get geranial in it which be a perfume
S0018	ah
S0049	and geranial be an irritant for people with eczema and dermatitis so it doesn't necessarily say
S0018	but isn't lavender oil just pure lavender oil
S0049	no it's get it's obviously get things in it so
S0018	oh
S0049	and that's like on my products i've get lavender but on my tox report my incy on my label there's geranial you know and geranial's one of the things i react to
S0018	mm
S0049	do you see what i mean so
S0018	tut yeah yeah
S0049	cos it's the components there's probably a thousand components in lavender oil
S0018	blimey
S0049	probably more than that
S0018	really
S0049	and they take out the strongest ones so like on my tox report and on my label there's for lavender i've get a list of things
S0018	mhm
S0049	and the percentages and i've get those on my label for my for my label cos er
S0018	you would've think that lavender essential oil would just in just
S0049	hm no
S0018	contain lavender oil press from the flower no
S0049	yeah but then it's still get lavender's still get things in like i can
S0018	oh the
S0049	it's still get you know
S0018	yeah okay the er
S0049	and um
S0018	the components of the oil
S0049	i'm try to think yeah and also like i'm try to think like on um but it be only in essential oil even camomile have get geranial in it
S0018	really so what be gernial be it a
S0049	it's a it's a perfume it's a it's a part
S0018	a
S0049	it's a component of camomile
S0018	so it's a natural perfume
S0049	yeah but again it's an irritant so on my in my calm scrub and in fact my calm facial oil on my tox report and on my label it say geranial
S0018	mm
S0049	you know so and it by law it have to go on there
S0018	oh well at least people can
S0049	so
S0018	people who be
S0049	mm
S0018	allergic to it can see what's in it
S0049	but i be shock because i couldn't understand with all this hauschka business and i be like right so my main er ingredient er the hospital have say be geranial okay then i get all my tox report back and i've get geranial in my products
S0018	but the
S0049	so er so i'm like hang on so i'm like what the hell this be what i've react to geranial from dr hauschka so and this be how i've learn in the whole process be because i learn that you know about all these components in all these essential oil
S0018	right
S0049	so that's why my in my calm cleanse cream i've get no essential oil
S0018	ah okay
S0049	so i've get nothing in there that would harm
S0018	mm
S0049	so if i go if that's why i use my calm cream because i know i will not react to er to it
S0018	but do you react to your products
S0049	i could do yeah
S0018	that have get geranial in
S0049	i could do not at the moment but i could if say my hormones change
S0018	mhm
S0049	and say i'm not very well and my skin's a bite sensitive like my skin's sensitive at the moment but i haven't react to anything
S0018	mhm
S0049	but if my hormones change and i use something then maybe yeah probably would
S0018	mm
S0049	but my calm range i wouldn't my balance range and my nourish range i would yeah cos of the essential oil but in a way there's lot of products out there which say they're calm
S0018	mm
S0049	but i can't use them
S0018	yeah that's just probably market purpose though isn't it
S0049	yeah
S0018	that they name it in a certain way
S0049	so it just just make me angry because er the stuff that be in and then you've get all that with paraben sulphates alcohol can you imagine
S0018	mm
S0049	the um what people be put on their skin
S0018	hm well
S0049	that's a bite noisy do you hear that babe

S0018	uh huh
S0049	before you get to but i dunno if i wanna be bother to go out
S0018	oh it's it's always difficult isn't it
S0049	it's cos it's so light normally it'd be dark now wouldn't it
S0018	yeah season be change we could do a bite of stretch here
S0049	yeah
S0049	could couldn't we babe
S0049	just go to the loo and i'll just take
S0018	okay i'll put the kettle on
S0049	alright hon
S0049	just see if um
S0018	so how much be the bag
S0049	apparently he ring me back well the bag
S0018	which ones be these be they the the brown paper ones or the jute ones
S0049	um both they're um
S0018	be they from the same supplier
S0049	yeah so
S0018	oh they're lovely
S0049	have you see the cotton bag in there
S0018	yeah the the kind of
S0049	so
S0018	mm
S0049	well these be the ones i really like but they're too much really cos er ten for five ten um hang on they're the jute cotton here we go cotton bag
S0018	be it the raw cotton ones the the kind of stiff ones
S0049	these be them
S0018	they're lovely
S0049	um so for a pack of ten i think they're six seventy for the size i want um but really i don't know what to do what do you think because i'll show you these paper bag so imagine those and then you'd put your products in and then you fold it over and put a sticker on and then you just stamp the bag with the stamp
S0018	mhm
S0049	and i think that look it's nice isn't it but then that's fine if someone buy er one cleanser or one moisturizer but if someone buy a cleanser a toner and a moisturizer they need a proper bag
S0018	hm
S0049	because that's just not gonna they need to carry it
S0018	can you not have bag like that er just with the little loop on the top
S0049	they're not strong enough
S0018	ah
S0049	for instance my body scrub be big glass
S0018	okay
S0049	um five hundred mil jar
S0018	yeah
S0049	and they're really heavy so those would have to go in a see the other bag i don't everyone else do these bag and i don't
S0018	which ones be they paper or material
S0049	ah they be these
S0018	mhm
S0049	but i just think they're a bite er
S0018	but why would those be strong enough if the brown paper bag wouldn't be
S0049	um the brain brown paper bag er isn't strong enough cos they're like paper
S0018	uh huh
S0049	but these bag be really expensive
S0018	ah they're glossy so they're really
S0049	and they're a bite er they're not what mm what i like so that's why i'm think these cotton bag
S0018	mhm
S0049	if i get two size
S0049	tut
S0018	be it the same ones as the one that you've
S0049	mm
S0018	get in the the other room
S0049	yeah see that you know the hessian y one
S0018	yeah
S0049	that's really nice it's just but i want people to reuse it otherwise i go for a you know a one of these
S0018	yeah
S0049	but they're expensive thirteen ninety five for ten look
S0018	phew
S0049	well it'd be that one
S0018	oh those be the jute ones and how much be the cotton ones
S0049	tut so hang on so they're oh
S0018	ah they're
S0049	twenty five for eight ten
S0018	no huh that can't be right if it's ten for eight forty five
S0049	that doesn't make sense do it
S0018	it doesn't uh then again if you buy them now at that price cos they've get that price advertise it's a legal requirement that they sell it
S0049	let's just put in there twenty five see what it say yeah
S0018	huh oh no er look total
S0049	oh god
S0018	two hundred and two oh no just put oh er no it's say a pack of ten ah okay so if you buy twenty five packets of
S0049	oh god
S0018	ten the price be reduce that's probably what it mean just put one in see how much they charge you for one
S0049	mm god what be i do i just wanna see i wish i could show you let me see if i can get it
S0018	you see these ones be really i mean i i think i prefer the cotton ones
S0049	yeah i think i do babe i'll just show you
S0018	be the cotton ones cheaper than the jute ones or the hessian ones
S0018	i don't know i just think they look a bite more classy
S0049	the cotton
S0018	yeah they're more er more organic more in the line of your range
S0049	see and the other thing be right so
S0018	and they can reuse those as well the the jute ones be
S0049	problem be i would've like them white but it doesn't matter but this isn't the box but i need to find a box this size in white
S0018	mhm
S0049	and they open it and this be to send out sample so i'm gonna have the cleanser the toner the facial oil a mask and a moisturizer
S0018	mhm
S0049	and then that will go be stamp
S0018	yeah
S0049	with honest with my business card
S0018	lovely
S0049	and that's why i want white cos that and then i'd like it to go into a bag not that one obviously but the next size up and then i'll post and this'll be stamp with honest on
S0018	yeah
S0049	and then i'll post that because i think it's first impressions that if someone's gonna open that aren't they go nice bag
S0018	yeah
S0049	nice box
S0049	nice products
S0049	it's simple so i like that size box i mean
S0018	have you buy box before
S0049	no i've gotta find some um but again this box be flimsy i want something that say
S0018	mm yep
S0049	you know cos it's er this it's first impression so i've get to
S0018	have you try alibaba dot com
S0049	yeah it's a it's a nightmare babe you need to buy five ten twenty thousand of things
S0018	oh mm okay
S0049	it's an absolute nightmare but um they have they have things on there that you'd i'd really like
S0018	yeah
S0049	but i just can't afford to buy in pack like that um
S0018	what what be the price for like a thousand
S0049	um well it's just i dunno but it's um hang on er i'll just bring them in
S0018	cos if it wasn't more i don't know how much more economical it be to buy something from a um a wholesaler i mean even if you've get more than you need i don't know whether er that would would that work out cheaper than buy from cos these aren't wholesalers be they or be they
S0049	um yeah i've they're e cos i've speak to them on the phone
S0018	mhm
S0049	um see really i could do with a box probably that size couldn't i really
S0018	yeah
S0049	cos i don't wanna send out too many products do i
S0018	hm no cos especially if they're just sample you don't wanna be waste too much of your products
S0049	mm
S0018	give them out free
S0049	that's what i mean
S0018	have you not get sample size like little small can or isn't there some kind of machine that make foil package of
S0049	oh god yeah it's so babe it's so this be honestly the cheapest way i've be down that route it's just ridiculously expensive and then to get all your your label your brand on there
S0018	yeah
S0049	like for instance to send a cleanser in that size that's thirty mil obviously with a white lid mm and the other thing you see my the printers i'm not do um label for these because it's gonna cost me a lot of money again so on my dymo in there
S0018	mhm
S0049	on my printer really i've get to make my own label that look really professional
S0018	mhm
S0049	just to send out sample
S0018	i'm sure that there's some kind of er thing in word
S0049	really
S0018	with which you can do label cos the where i be teach there be um the language department have a secretary
S0049	okay
S0018	and she do all the the admin work and she make out label to stick in the pupils' book like if you're mark their homework
S0049	oh really
S0018	and very good work or your target be to lay out your work
S0049	so you can put your logo on there
S0018	yeah you can put anything on there she use to put like little er little picture of the eiffel tower and
S0049	oh really aw that's
S0018	actually i think i've still get some i should i'll hunt them out and show you how
S0049	yeah
S0018	professional they can look cos they they really do look
S0049	like good yeah
S0018	yeah and i'm sure you can do that in label in word
S0049	okay well that would be brilliant
S0018	if it be just on the it's er just on normal white sticky label isn't it
S0049	yeah
S0018	just um rectangular
S0049	okay
S0018	and you can do them as small or as large as you need them
S0049	that's what i need to do then cos really on here i just want a label with honest my logo and then the name of the product then it just say sample
S0018	yeah
S0049	so i don't really need a box i could do if i have another little one there i could send just that out couldn't i
S0018	yeah definitely
S0049	cos the mask isn't gonna cost me much to send obviously my moisturizers be a lot more
S0018	what's the cheapest products that you have to make
S0049	um i think it's probably my toners
S0018	so you could maybe stock up on the toners in the sample and leave the or make the
S0049	the thing be when er i need to send out really um
S0018	that kind of work doesn't it
S0049	yeah
S0018	be the lid on that top one properly
S0049	on that one yeah um
S0018	no that's not gonna close
S0049	or if i have tissue paper print with honest on
S0018	yeah
S0049	then that would take up space and then i could have it fold and then with a little sticker i can do on my dymo say honest
S0018	yeah
S0049	could undo the sticker unwrap it
S0018	how about a little candle you know the tea light
S0049	mm
S0018	size that would fill
S0049	yeah
S0018	the space
S0049	yeah
S0018	then again those be more expensive aren't they
S0049	yeah and everyone do those as well cos i i wanna i don't wanna come across as um what be these as like everybody else
S0018	yeah well the tissue paper idea'd be good
S0049	yeah cos that'd be easy i mean i can get print ribbon for you know a pound a metre or something that's not a problem um
S0018	well why not just get um in that case tissue don't worry about the box tissue paper with the logo on
S0049	yeah
S0018	a bite of ribbon with the logo on and just tie it around
S0049	yeah i do think about that
S0018	pop it in a bag
S0049	or i don't even have to have a box
S0018	yeah yeah
S0049	do i
S0018	no you could just put them all in the bag er maybe you know that um tut like the cardboard colour er very thin strip of paper
S0049	yeah
S0018	which you could probably do in a
S0049	look
S0018	yeah no that'd be fine
S0049	could just have that in the post couldn't you
S0018	yeah yeah if you want to pack it out with the tut the shred bits of paper or something or tissue paper
S0049	mm yeah
S0018	what do you do for for the paris fashion week or be it london fashion week how do you present
S0049	oh i just have lot er just give her load of these post her these and she put them in her own bag
S0018	oh okay do you have any
S0049	no
S0018	feedback from them
S0049	oh er no she er she send me an e mail say she be gonna let me know what people think but she she didn't um i need to contact her really but i haven't have any
S0018	who do she give them to
S0049	just people that be look at her show that but she do say that um she be gonna give them to the best people but you i don't think she be just say that but to be honest hon they be i wasn't ready you know i do the label myself with just honest on
S0018	yeah
S0049	you know they be just do you know i don't i think i'm just best send that in the post with my logo on
S0018	yeah i think that's a good idea cos box be it's just another hassle to to find them and it's another cost and you gotta find one that's
S0049	would've be nice
S0018	fit perfectly and now you can get the smaller size bag as well
S0049	would've be nice to have um that with honest ribbon there's this guy he sell er
S0018	can you not rethread them
S0049	mm
S0018	you could do
S0049	i could do yeah could have honest ribbon couldn't i through there
S0018	yeah how many be you think of send out
S0049	tut well my list of salons be endless
S0049	there's huh so far my list of salons i have over three hundred

S0018	ethos as well doesn't it
S0049	so in which case hon that's gonna be my sample bag and my candle bag
S0018	mhm
S0049	i'm try to think if i can use it for anything else and i don't even know what size that be
S0018	the bag
S0049	yeah i'll have to measure it so that will be my sample bag candle bag let's just you don't mind me do this do you while you're here
S0018	no not at all
S0049	let me just try this candle
S0018	have you get a tape measure
S0049	yeah i'll get it hang on
S0018	do you know where it be er be it in the kitchen
S0049	tut um yeah i'll just put the
S0018	have you check the candle fit okay yeah
S0049	perfect
S0018	perfectly
S0049	so my candle bag
S0018	lovely it look er it look really professional as well
S0049	do you think babe
S0018	yep
S0049	i'm try to think if i can use that for anything else so
S0018	oh these candle smell so good
S0049	i know they're gorgeous aren't they
S0018	be they two tone
S0049	no
S0018	the colour
S0049	it's just from the wax when it's um
S0018	uh huh oh cos it's against the glass
S0018	oh it smell so good
S0049	be it centimetres that's centimetres there isn't it
S0018	yeah so that's eight
S0049	so it's nine
S0018	nineteen
S0049	nine centimetres by huh
S0049	sorry
S0018	that's alright
S0049	um
S0018	it's nineteen
S0049	it's nineteen by
S0018	fourteen
S0049	nineteen by fourteen
S0018	ah it smell so good what's it get in it lemongrass lavender and geranium mm
S0049	it's nice isn't it um sample bag and candle bag then i would have so now i've just gotta decide what bag to have so imagine you go to caroline mcgrath's shop
S0018	mhm
S0049	and you buy one moisturizer
S0018	mhm
S0049	you you'd have it in this or you'd have it in that paper bag
S0018	mhm
S0049	the paper bag's gonna work out cheaper
S0018	if i be you i'd keep the cotton bag for the the sample you send out to people that you want to be make order with you
S0049	and the candle
S0018	and then when people actually buy retail
S0049	yeah
S0018	keep them in the paper bag
S0049	okay so then the paper bag will be for so i'll have one size so if a customer only buy one or two products but then if a customer's buy cleanser toner and a moisturizer which at a spa she would tut or for instance when i use to work at hotel du vin well we have to sell our retail so people would go away with four or five products and they come in bag then you'd have to have a proper bag
S0018	mhm
S0049	or if someone's go into a shop and buy a candle a scrub and a moisturizer i'm gonna need a stronger bag aren't i
S0018	yeah
S0049	so i either sell it in
S0018	mm
S0049	well in which case er they would have tissue to wrap up the products and then one of those jute bag
S0018	yeah
S0049	kinda thing in cotton
S0018	yep and maybe just like um actually if you if you get the print ribbon with the logo you wouldn't need to print the tissue paper you could just get some cheap tissue well not cheap but you know
S0049	tut um
S0018	not not stuff that look cheap the stuff that cost
S0049	tissue paper
S0018	that cost less
S0049	mm
S0018	or some that's get like fleck in
S0049	no i just want plain white really with probably just plain white tissue
S0018	yeah yeah
S0049	and then on my dymo i've get label that big i print off with honest on
S0018	uh huh
S0049	they're like that big
S0018	yeah
S0049	so the the they will have a sheet of label and then cos when you're in a shop they can then just wrap the product up
S0018	yeah um yeah
S0049	put a sticker on and put it in the bag
S0018	yeah
S0049	cos especially cos some of them be glass and some be plastic
S0018	good idea
S0049	so in which case cotton bag er
S0018	be you sure you can't find them cheaper on er other sit
S0049	tut yeah oh babe honestly i've do so much research with these guy but they i don't have them for they give me i'll find the e mail in a minute they give me they're not at this price they're only a little bite cheaper
S0018	uh huh
S0049	but you can get er cotton bag like this but they're not as um they're not as nice cos i've have so many sample send to me
S0018	mm
S0049	and some of them be like really cheap
S0018	yeah
S0049	like look
S0018	oh you don't want cheap look
S0049	see they do backpack as well look
S0018	aw how much be they
S0049	i dunno five hundred by seven oh god they've do it in in um in millimetres so
S0018	uh
S0049	oh gosh what would what would that one be then would that be a hundred and forty by two hundred
S0018	how many millimetres do it say
S0049	oh yeah that's it
S0018	it's forty five by thirty
S0049	five pound twenty for ten but i'll check my e mail so they're five pound twenty but bear in mind the shop pay for their bag
S0018	oh okay
S0049	so salons will buy a pack of bag
S0018	uh huh
S0049	if they want them
S0018	right
S0049	do you know what i mean
S0018	yeah
S0049	otherwise if not then i'll just give them tissue paper
S0018	mhm
S0049	and they'll the clients will put it in the bag or whatever but most spas will buy their own will buy their bag five twenty for ten so fifty two p each so it just have to go into my cost doesn't it for the candle
S0018	yep
S0049	and then my stamp's not gonna cost much be it cos of the ink and well the stamp's gonna be i reckon it'll be about fifteen pound but it's gonna last me isn't it so the and then um tut so really a bag two hundred and fifty one so that's twenty five centimetres by three hundred
S0018	by thirty yeah yep
S0049	that's enough for like a couple of products isn't it
S0018	yeah yeah that's probably the biggest you're gonna need
S0049	cos the next size up then be three hundred by
S0018	unless you buy the backpack
S0049	four fifty
S0018	they're cool
S0049	which be like that big
S0018	yeah
S0049	which be way too big
S0018	no that's too big unless somebody buy a lot of products
S0049	well no people everyone walk round with honest
S0049	backpack
S0018	that's the aim if everyone can buy ten products each they can have a backsack free
S0049	well this be perfect
S0018	oh yeah
S0049	in fact i really like this bag
S0018	but it'll be difficult to stamp it won't it
S0049	it's like i
S0018	then again
S0049	but you know like potato bag
S0018	yeah yeah
S0049	you buy your potatoes in mm
S0018	well you could huh
S0049	i don't know which ones i prefer
S0018	do you definitely wanna stamp the bag with the logo
S0049	yeah it's gotta be cos i can't afford to get them print print i get a quote
S0018	but you definitely want the logo on the bag
S0049	oh yeah cos it's um
S0018	but will you be able to get er a logo on that bag cos it's quite rough material isn't it
S0049	tut it's it's gonna cos i want people to reuse i want people to be proud of their bag as well
S0018	aw
S0049	do you know what i mean like if i have a bag like that i'd reuse it for in my bathroom or something
S0018	yeah well maybe
S0049	i don't know i don't know
S0018	uh
S0049	which one do you prefer
S0018	come here yeah no it's lovely isn't it and actually it's it's heavier duty so it would be better as you say if someone's buy the glass tut containers i like both of them but er i think it will be easier to stamp the logo on the cotton
S0049	yeah definitely
S0018	but
S0049	mm
S0018	i mean there's
S0049	mm
S0018	no reason why you couldn't maybe get some of this material stamp the material and then just like er sew it on
S0049	oh god babe you're joke
S0049	um
S0018	can give your nan something to do
S0018	nan i need you
S0049	i think they're the same price
S0018	they be lovely though but i like tut
S0049	yeah they're the same price
S0018	they both say the same thing they're both very organic materials and
S0049	yeah
S0018	nice and pure
S0049	see i i could mm i don't know if i wanna keep change though and have three different bag but i could have candle and sample in there and then these bag heavier ones for when people buy
S0018	mhm
S0049	you know a scrub or in actual fact if someone buy a scrub and they're in these these be gonna be load better aren't they
S0018	yeah cos they'll protect the glass better as well well maybe in that case don't stamp the those bag with the logos put the ribbon through the
S0049	cos that's a scrub in there obviously a lot heavier cos it's gonna be full of products see
S0018	yeah no it do need something more heavy duty doesn't it huh hm and the scrub's gonna be heavier isn't it cos this be empty
S0049	it's gonna be yeah really heavy because it's full of salt and and it's in a box they come in a box as well
S0018	well in that case you're definitely gonna want a bag that's more heavy duty so that especially well if it's in a if it's in a box that'll probably protect it
S0049	in fact
S0018	quite well but
S0049	i know this isn't full and it's not get salt in but this be just oil
S0018	uh huh yeah it's really heavy
S0049	so with salt in as well or sugar it's gonna be even heavier
S0018	yeah it will be
S0049	um put that in the bag
S0018	let's see how it feel why don't you put a candle in as well just in case
S0049	mm yeah
S0018	people buy two glass things
S0049	yeah it's gonna have to be this bag see
S0018	lovely it's a nice little shop bag it look like the um the you know the baguette bag that the french carry around
S0049	yeah do you know what that's the bag i'm have
S0018	okay
S0049	so that's a decision make and really er to do my brand it doesn't matter that i've get different ones
S0018	yeah
S0049	i think it's quite nice
S0018	they do complement each other as well they could be use together
S0049	so the size of that one be thirty five so three hundred and fifty by a hundred and fifty
S0018	so how much be those
S0049	they be oh no four hundred by five hundred be it that one three fifty by four hundred
S0018	yeah that's what it be
S0049	well that's mm no so that's not it either
S0018	how big be it thirty what be it
S0049	er this one's thirty five so three fifty
S0018	uh huh
S0049	that way and then two
S0018	three fifty by
S0049	twenty
S0018	twenty two
S0049	two hundred and sixty
S0018	isn't it two twenty six cos it's twenty
S0049	yeah
S0018	six
S0049	but two hundred and sixty millimetres that be isn't it
S0018	isn't it two hundred and twenty six how many centimetres be it
S0049	it's um tut twenty six
S0018	okay so it would
S0049	so it's two hundred and sixty
S0018	two hundred and sixty millimetres yeah do they not have that size on the webpage
S0049	no which be weird isn't it
S0018	very bizarre they send you that as a sample
S0049	mm
S0018	let's see
S0049	ah two hundred and thirty by three hundred
S0018	that's definitely not
S0049	uh bizarre
S0018	how very weird so how much be those anyway
S0049	um they be five ten for ten no four eighty five for ten
S0018	that's okay it's
S0049	which be cheaper than the smaller ones
S0018	yeah
S0049	large jute bag which i've get in there be seven ten for ten so the large ones let me just measure that large one i know it's too big but just to see if the measurements
S0018	well maybe they're in the medium size one maybe they're talk about the one that you be call large
S0049	yeah maybe
S0018	cos other er
S0049	this be the large
S0018	oh that be very large isn't it that'd be just yeah too big how long be it
S0049	well that would be nearly five hundred by
S0018	five hundred wait there i'll just
S0049	five hundred mil by three hundred mil
S0018	mil
S0049	mil m m
S0018	five hundred by three hundred where's the size of that one
S0049	four hundred by five hundred
S0018	how bizarre
S0049	really bizarre
S0018	maybe they've just send you a different cos that actually look a bite darker than these ones
S0049	no it's the same
S0018	very strange
S0049	let me see what their small one be
S0018	have you get a small one here

S0049	well he say because i want all of them he say he send me a bite of both because they be all the same
S0018	oh okay
S0049	um so that would be a hundred and five so oh i know what he's do
S0018	what's he do
S0049	so there's a smaller one this be smaller mm oh well well when i speak to him i can ask him
S0018	hm
S0049	but i think that's the way to go
S0018	well it's just a rough idea of the price anyway even if the centimetres be out
S0049	well what i'll do be i'll wait till my stamp arrive and then i'll stamp them and see which be best
S0018	do you order the stamp already
S0049	no she hasn't e mail me back i say can you let me know by today
