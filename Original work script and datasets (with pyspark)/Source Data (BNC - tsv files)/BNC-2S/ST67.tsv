S0421	so electric cars don't have petrol so you just plug them in
S0423	yeah
S0421	do you have to pay for the use of that
S0423	eh
S0421	do you have to pay for the use of that plug in
S0423	i don't know i've never really look at them i think there's some in there's one in the erm in ikea in
S0421	really
S0423	car park yeah
S0421	that's weird
S0423	i wonder how long they take
S0421	i know yeah
S0421	like charge your phone or something i know that must be such a pain if you've get an electric car like how many place be there to charge them up
S0423	well the thing be if you have an electric car you you really have to plan for your journey don't you
S0421	oh do they not last that long
S0423	no they're not really they don't have a wide radius so they're probably more suit if you're just go to use your car for round the city you know if you're go to have to do much
S0421	yeah
S0423	motorway travel you need to know there's somewhere to charge it up and whether it's practical to do it if you're travel any distance cos the charge will only last so long and so many miles i don't know it's a hundred miles or something
S0421	ah
S0423	which'd probably be quite difficult do a journey like this i suppose that's why hybrid cars be more popular aren't they it's kind of a mixture of
S0421	mm
S0423	different fuel you could use well i don't know what how they work really but i'm guess it's petrol and electric a hybrid be it you can kinda switch from one to the other so it give you that bite more of a range but you're use fuel less petrol less
S0421	yeah it must be
S0423	it's four o'clock
S0421	i know
S0423	probably about half way there i think i wanna try and get there before seven if not we'll have to call them
S0421	why
S0423	it say it on the website ring us if you're arrive say check in at four o'clock
S0421	oh
S0423	subject to delay if you're gonna be later than seven i think they need a car to make sure there's somebody there for the
S0421	yeah
S0423	to give you the key and if you arrive after eleven at night then it say i don't think there'll be anyone there to accept you
S0423	and they may give out your room to someone else
S0421	huh
S0423	seem a bite odd so you can if you pay for it for four days
S0421	i know
S0423	how could they give it out to anyone else
S0421	like would they just give it to someone for a night or
S0423	i think it's unlikely you'd think they'd ring you first or if we be gonna be that late we'd ring them wouldn't we
S0421	yeah
S0423	let's hope traffic's not too bad cos it consider the traffic we've be in it's not too bad
S0421	yeah
S0423	and we've stop have a break so if we don't have much traffic we might be okay
S0421	they have sun cream two for eight pound or something in asda
S0423	really i'm that's where i get mine in asda
S0421	do you
S0421	the little the little asda near my house
S0423	no the big asda in
S0421	no well the little asda near my house
S0423	yeah but they have to be the same what kinda sun cream be it
S0421	nivea
S0423	oh right
S0423	i get nivea i buy a kids' one
S0421	oh why
S0423	cos it be cheap
S0423	it be on offer it be half price
S0421	that's like factor fifty or something isn't it
S0423	yeah yeah it's alright i'm not come out with a suntan
S0421	yeah i suppose though yeah
S0423	it should've be ten pound get it for five so i think well
S0421	oh that's alright
S0423	why would i pay more for a different
S0421	yeah and it's less as well it'll be a lower uv
S0423	yeah i think this one have they have star on that's why i go for this this have get like four star the others have three
S0421	oh
S0423	so i think right i'm go for the i don't know why i'm get all conscientious about sun cream i never use to wear it
S0421	it's not the colour one be it
S0423	what's colour
S0421	cos you can get kids' colour fifty so it's like for water and it's like green on your skin
S0423	didn't say that
S0423	otherwise i'll be walk round with a green face
S0421	yeah it make you like a pale green
S0423	why do they do that just cos kid like it
S0421	no i think it's what
S0423	protection
S0421	i think it also show you if it's still on if you're go to walk
S0423	yeah cos you see some of these australians they put all these colour ones on their nose or something don't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	and on their lips they have like a colour thing
S0421	but the one the colour one it it would say colour it's like get a a green splodge on it and it say colour
S0423	ah right
S0421	and i think it's either water so it either doesn't wash off as easily
S0423	or it show you when it's wear off
S0421	yeah or it show like you know for kid like top it up
S0423	yeah i think they're really like a bite obsess in er
S0421	australia
S0423	in australia
S0421	quite rightly so though
S0423	well yeah i can understand why you know cos there's so much sun but i think me mam when she go over she be outside in it outside in like midday in
S0421	yeah
S0423	with
S0421	well midday
S0423	well yeah i think somebody know her or something say be that outside at midday they couldn't believe it
S0421	yeah i know well it be a bite like even in erm like sometimes when grandma and granddad say on the radio and stuff they'll say they'll advise you not to go out at midday
S0423	yeah well then i mean it's forty degrees up there it's ridiculous isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	it be very hot
S0421	but yeah like there's a lot more awareness regard like sun cream and things now even some people say you're suppose to wear it every day
S0423	yeah supposedly even when it's not sunny
S0421	even when it's overcast
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	i mean i never put it on
S0421	no
S0423	i've only the only reason i i think of it i buy it last year because think
S0421	yeah
S0423	first day we'll put the tent up and i start to get really sunburnt and then i some cos i think i can't not have any during the race cos we're outside for twenty four hours so i buy that container last year it be that on that day and then i bring that to italy with me
S0421	yeah
S0423	and then i've never use it since
S0421	but yeah like a
S0423	then
S0421	a lot of people recommend
S0423	now i'm go on holiday i think i better buy some cos we're gonna be out a lot
S0421	yeah
S0423	a lot what
S0421	a lot of people recommend wear it every day
S0423	yeah if you ever speak to somebody who know about this they
S0421	yeah
S0423	they say you should wear it
S0421	it take forever to put it on and it's like
S0423	well just maybe just do your face and arm maybe
S0421	yeah it be a bite of a pain though
S0423	if you're on a beach and you're half naked then it take age put it everywhere doesn't it
S0421	i know but you know like face and arm it's just it's a pain to like rub it all in and then you feel a bite sticky and
S0423	yeah i if you know you're gonna be out all day it's probably a good idea isn't it you even if it's overcast and
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm but most people generally unless you're go off for a day trip or you're you're you know you don't work outdoors then you tend not to need a great deal outdoors do you i mean i don't think you have to worry too much in the winter
S0421	no well the sun's so weak in england that you don't even get vitamin d from it in the winter
S0423	yeah
S0421	there's only a few months a year that you can get vitamin d in england
S0423	really
S0421	yeah like the summer probably like june july august
S0423	mm and be that enough for the rest of the year
S0421	yeah
S0423	really
S0421	well you have to get it from food as well so you get it from your store from the summer and also food
S0423	i think it's the only vitamin that you can't get from food
S0421	no yeah there's a few foods that you can get it from i do look it up because some people be allergic to sunlight
S0423	that's a quite rare thing though isn't it
S0421	yeah but they have to get their vitamin d from somewhere
S0423	mm
S0421	grandma's like oh you don't wanna be a vegetarian
S0423	be she
S0421	yeah cos she's like the even doctor say that it's better to eat meat and i'm like no it doesn't matter
S0423	there's load of them isn't there they don't seem to have health problems
S0421	no well i'm er the nhs say it's good well not like good not as in better but it's like
S0421	fine yeah they just have advice for you
S0423	what do it say
S0421	yeah cos you get more health problems and stuff
S0423	such as
S0421	don't know
S0423	well if you're if you're in control of it how you do it
S0421	yeah
S0423	make sure that you're not lose out and stuff you get in meat
S0421	yeah
S0423	i think a lot of people when they do it they they just don't give enough think to it and they
S0421	yeah
S0423	just say right i'm not gonna eat meat and then they just eat randomly whatever
S0421	yeah
S0423	and it's it's not the way to do it really you have to be
S0421	it's not bad vegetarian though because you do get you probably will get enough protein if you're still eat like egg and things well it's like vegan that they're like you've get to know what you're do because you can like die
S0423	mm so be she disappoint she's not persuade you
S0421	well i don't know she probably think that i probably won't bother cos she's like what be you gonna eat and i be like and i be like cos cos she make some kind of salad thing and i'm like oh i'm not really a a big fan of leave cos it be just like load of leave and she's like what you gonna eat when you're a vegetarian and i'm like i don't have to eat leave you know i can eat vegetables
S0423	i i mean if you erm you're say you're kind of do it cos cos erm you don't like to cook meat
S0421	no it's cos i don't want the animals to die
S0423	well yeah but the thing be if you're do it for erm conscientious reason you would've do it
S0421	ethical reason
S0423	yeah you wouldn't do it
S0421	why
S0423	well because if you be bother about the the the fact that animals be be kill why be still eat meat now
S0421	because i don't know what i'm do i'll probably just out out of like no protein
S0423	yeah yeah but you've have load of time
S0421	and i can't do it at i can't do it at home because i can't i don't i don't have
S0423	you can
S0421	i don't i don't have enough money to go out and buy myself
S0421	the food that i need
S0423	well you'd have to say to your mami'm not eat meat and it's up to your mam to
S0421	well then i'll just die from the
S0421	the the i cos i won't be eat the right stuff because
S0423	why tell your mammy what you need
S0421	no she won't she can't afford it she can't afford to buy me food
S0423	why
S0421	separately to the food that she's gonna buy we just buy all the same food and it just it's cheaper
S0423	just leave the meat out
S0421	well then you see cos if i'd do then i'm gonna die because i'm not
S0421	cos i literally eat like i probably don't get enough vitamins as it be at the moment like i don't eat enough of
S0423	but you don't if you're eat all these
S0421	yeah i just eat rubbish at the moment so if i then didn't eat
S0423	how much what what do it cost to buy a bag of vegetables
S0421	it it well it we sometimes eat veg with our meals
S0423	yeah
S0421	but we don't just eat vegetables like it do get more expensive if you base your whole meal on vegetables
S0423	i don't think it's gotta be cheaper
S0423	meat be the dear thing
S0421	no because we don't buy meat it's like god know what's in it
S0423	you're you're well exactly
S0421	cos it's cheap
S0423	so you're not get much
S0421	yeah
S0423	goodness from the the process stuff you're eat anyway
S0421	but it's cheap cos we can afford it
S0423	you're not no you're not buy fresh meat you're not get that much
S0421	yeah
S0423	from the food you're buy so you may as well eat the vegetarian you get the goodness out of fresh food
S0421	i know but then it's still it's more expensive
S0423	i can't see how it gonna be dearer for vegetables
S0421	it be though it be
S0423	i could make a meal for a pound for two people with vegetables and probably have a bite of rice or pasta bag of packet of pasta's about a pound one thirty
S0421	yeah
S0423	get four portion out of that
S0421	yeah and there well there's four of us at the moment
S0423	oh right so that's you know whatever you do you have to make four don't you so
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know it's it's gonna cost you a bite for four people to even
S0421	yeah
S0423	eat process food you know it's
S0421	so we literally
S0423	you're not really gonna get one meal for a pound each
S0421	no
S0423	it's gonna be hard to get that
S0421	yeah
S0423	otherwise it's not gonna be particularly good if you buy a bag of risotto for a pound yeah that's for four
S0421	yeah
S0423	one bag er couple of say twelve tomatoes you don't even need tomatoes yeah and then an onion so you you're talk er less than probably two fifty three pound so say three pound you'll get a nutritious but
S0421	yeah and then that's like one meal for a day
S0423	yeah i know but there there's other meals that you can do a similar thing with
S0421	yeah
S0423	and and incorporate vegetables
S0421	but still that add up over a week
S0423	yeah but that three pound you're not gonna get cheaper than that for process food for four people
S0421	no but it's not
S0423	it's less than a pound a meal it's hard to eat cheaper than that even if you're buy the cheapest you know what would you get that's cheaper than a pound a meal
S0421	i don't know whatever we're do at the moment
S0423	well i i don't think it would you know erm that's as cheap as that cos you have to still have to you still have to incorporate stuff don't you different elements to make a meal unless you're buy a whole ready meal but they're they
S0421	no we don't buy a ready meal
S0423	they cost a pound anyway
S0421	we just buy like really cheap chip
S0421	and then like cheap freeze stuff and it fill you up
S0423	yeah yeah you you're probably
S0421	and you feel full
S0423	still probably dearer than that per person but then er pasta you can have a really nice vegetable pasta dish a stir fry vegetable stir fry
S0421	but the thing be the thing be grandma and granddad won't eat they they want meat and they want like their proper meals and stuff
S0423	no i'm just say you though
S0421	yes but the thing be you can't buy
S0423	you can you can say ten pound a week can be enough for you and them
S0421	yeah but we we like spend ten pound a week for the everyone or twenty pound a week for everyone
S0423	well twenty pound be different to ten pound
S0421	well well okay twenty pound for everyone and then like i can't have another ten pound just for me like i can't you you just can't expect me to just say right i'm not eat that i i want you to buy me like whatever then i just wouldn't be eat anything
S0423	yeah but you they have to buy you're gonna be buy pasta and vegetable with rice anyway isn't she so that you know it shouldn't be an addition because most households have those things most house you know i'm sure your mammy get pasta
S0421	yeah and then we have like i dunno all we have like twenty p sauce or something
S0423	twenty p sauce
S0421	yeah you can get a jar of sauce for twenty p to put on pasta
S0423	ugh that must be absolutely horrible
S0421	cheap it's cheap and it's actually alright it's not bad
S0423	you sound like you're live in poverty
S0421	pretty much yeah it's it's alright it's not that it's it's it's it's basically tomatoes and it's i dunno
S0423	but i don't understand why you have to have your food eat like that when your mammy's on a teacher's wage
S0421	because we've have all these expense
S0423	yeah so then now will die down won't it
S0421	what at some point but erm
S0423	yeah yeah that's all be pay off now the house be sell
S0421	yeah but she's not she's not gonna be get pay that much and she's gonna have to give that money back as well
S0423	well she doesn't need to worry about that till the time but do anything
S0421	what
S0423	you know they they don't ask her for it all back in one go will they
S0421	well they're gonna ask for it back and also she's only gonna get pay half wage for a third amount of time and then she's gonna be on like nothing until she go back to work
S0423	well half wage be still you know when you don't have your mortgage or rent to pay it's not too bad really all you've gotta pay be your food and electricity and gas bill don't you
S0421	but do you know how much our water be because we don't have a water meter they've just say the standard rate for this area be fifty pound a month
S0421	that's a lot isn't it
S0423	yeah
S0421	and we i don't i don't know like that's just load and we we we didn't even pay that much when we have a meter like me and mummy the two of us
S0423	maybe you should get a meter then you haven't get the or whatever it be
S0421	yeah but we're just think because if grandma and granddad be still there
S0423	sorry go on
S0421	erm while grandma and granddad be still over we might
S0423	yeah
S0421	keep it because we don't know how much water we're gonna be use
S0423	yeah
S0421	but that's that's a lot so
S0423	then again maybe it's not a good idea have the meter you'll be have a shower once a week if you're on a meter or something
S0421	erm
S0423	so oh can't afford to have a shower
S0421	well our you know our shower at the moment
S0421	our shower be like thirty second
S0423	you don't have to have a meter you you pay for
S0421	i know well no but our shower's like a dribble and it's like cold and it's
S0423	oh
S0421	thirty second in and out
S0423	mammy say she's get a new shower
S0421	i don't know i know it's well she wasn't go to but i think she might it depend how much money
S0423	what's your water pressure like
S0421	well it's an electric shower it's like
S0423	no i don't i mean er
S0421	i don't know
S0423	say you're run the you're run the bath water
S0421	oh it's not very good no it's not very good it's quite weak it's quite weak
S0423	cos you could have a shower like in mine where it's attach to the tap
S0421	yeah
S0423	my water pressure's good though so it come out really strong
S0421	well the plumber be like yeah your shower's like an antique it's like it's so weird it's like get these string that you have to pull to adjust the er the temperature it's weird
S0423	and that
S0421	it's three hundred pound
S0423	be it how do you know
S0421	look it up cos we saw that shower and we be like oh we want a new one and we be like oh maybe we can't afford that
S0423	cheaper
S0421	no but like the cos it would be with installation as well like we'd get that one take out and then put in and then
S0423	yeah
S0421	like the price of the shower might not be that much but
S0423	you can probably get a shower for around a hundred
S0421	yeah
S0423	you can always shop around get
S0421	but we don't but like if we're change this one we might if the if the cheap one that we're gonna buy
S0423	yeah
S0421	be like no better we might as well just keep this one
S0423	remember that lovely big shower have
S0421	i know that be so nice wow i use to spend age in there well not age but
S0423	you didn't sit down and read a book like
S0421	it be good no
S0421	yeah it be good that shower
S0423	well you might you're gonna be move soon bet you'll have a good shower in university
S0421	i bet i won't
S0423	like a en suite
S0421	i bet the shower won't be good bet it'll just be like i well it might be probably better than this one but i don't
S0423	you can complain say i'm pay this much money
S0421	i know i be pay a ridiculous amount of money
S0423	i don't even have a good shower
S0421	there'll be like don't stay in halls then go and rent but like wow it's a lot of money though for that accommodation
S0423	round here
S0421	like it's only a room you'd think it's cheaper
S0423	yeah it's not any kind of accommodation be dear it's not very good this country i think for accommodation price quite expensive
S0421	although it'd probably be more expensive to rent outside of the university
S0423	probably yeah either way it's not cheap
S0421	yeah so it's probably not bad really do you want one
S0423	no i'm full
S0421	i don't really want one but i'm just eat them
S0421	my ears have pop
S0423	really
S0421	mm
S0423	high we're at almost at sea level
S0421	i know where
S0423	not far from it's go warm bring your swim costume
S0421	no
S0423	in the sea
S0421	no cold sea would you go in the cold sea
S0423	yeah
S0421	would you
S0423	i'd go in
S0421	be you go to
S0423	i don't know
S0423	it's not gonna be warm be it this country
S0421	no
S0421	i don't know why people go in the cold sea
S0423	to have fun
S0421	but it's not fun though it's cold
S0423	you get use to it quickly don't you once you're in you use to go in it when you be younger
S0421	i know i wasn't bother then
S0423	yeah
S0421	it's just like yeah water wow and i have a wet suit
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	but it's still cold even with my wet suit
S0423	no i don't think it be too bad with a wet suit be it
S0421	yeah
S0423	be it
S0421	it be still quite cold
S0423	that's the river
S0421	oh
S0423	there's the sea the other side the estuary round there
S0421	all those cars park why be they park there
S0423	do you think be it a factory a car factory that manufacture them or something
S0421	oh maybe
S0423	it could be a big factory and they're the workers' cars
S0421	a lot of workers
S0423	yeah
S0421	mm
S0423	that's some kind of dockyard up there be it not warm now or be it just me
S0421	it be warm now isn't it
S0423	cloud in the sky
S0421	but the cloud trap the heat don't they
S0423	i don't know
S0421	because that's kind of how global warm be like all the the the pollution gas
S0421	rebound the uv and warm us up cos it doesn't escape
S0423	oh right
S0421	so i don't know maybe cloud don't work like that but that do kind of make sense because you know like when it rain and it's warm and it's like humid
S0423	yeah
S0421	so
S0423	yeah but most of the time when it's cloudy it tend to be cooler
S0421	yeah
S0423	that's generally cos the sun's not get through isn't it
S0421	what
S0423	if you've open something there have you
S0421	there's no dirt
S0423	no but you're gonna stamp it on something it's not a foot rest you know
S0421	you need to get a foot rest
S0423	you think you limousine you not a car
S0421	yeah
S0423	so you can lie down and have a sleep
S0423	journey
S0421	camper van
S0423	mm
S0421	oh look at all those tree
S0423	yeah first time i've drive down here
S0421	what animals do you think there be in there
S0423	that's a buzzard
S0421	oh
S0423	probably some lions and tigers hide away in
S0421	if you think about it like go into the forest in england isn't really that dangerous because what's gonna get you
S0423	well i know who say it be dangerous
S0421	no but you know what i mean like in other countries it would be dangerous to go into the forest but in england it's not really
S0423	it would've be in the past
S0421	yeah
S0423	we've kill all the er wolves
S0421	and the bear
S0423	yeah and the the lynx they be say they want to reintroduce lynx
S0421	oh yes let's have some lynx
S0423	and er they want to reintroduce wolves
S0421	oh what about bear
S0423	er they be say er they have wild boar
S0421	probably
S0421	oh yeah boar
S0423	introduce
S0421	mm
S0423	well obviously there'll there'll there'll be forest where they just no one go there i suppose and there'll be control you know people'll be overlook them
S0421	i like lynx mean i've see them in the wild
S0423	quite small aren't they for wild cat apparently
S0421	yeah well they big compare to a domestic
S0423	yeah
S0421	they be big if you saw a lynx
S0423	well yeah you'd be startle wouldn't you
S0421	you'd be like oh
S0423	well i would even if they reintroduce them i would imagine the sight would be very rare
S0421	yeah they'd just be hide wouldn't they in the
S0423	cos they're say deer they want something to control the population of deer
S0421	really we get too many i've never see deer in the wild
S0423	yeah well i guess we have load of those place where it be but they say they're they're destroy the forest you know cos they eat bark and tree and
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	the tree die when they eat them
S0421	oh i like deers ah
S0423	and occasionally they they have to do a cull they just go out and shoot them
S0421	yeah
S0423	so they're say well let's have a natural predator a lynx hunt the deer and they use to be the predator but
S0421	yeah
S0423	be kill off
S0421	i remember we be look for like bush for our garden to have as like a fence and they be like really expensive so we never get one
S0423	they're expensive
S0421	yeah
S0423	why can't you just grow them
S0421	well yeah we could but it would take years
S0421	erm we don't want them here as well at our other house
S0421	and er some of them it would say like deer proof and i be like i wish i have deers come into my garden like the i need a deer proof fence to keep them out who have deers that invade in their garden
S0423	if you have a nice garden and deers come in and trample it all
S0421	yeah
S0423	wouldn't be happy would they
S0421	i don't think erm the lynx would really attack people would it
S0423	no they wouldn't they'd be too scar of us
S0421	cos like the wolves would wouldn't they
S0423	you know they say wolves don't but it's only in wolves if you're do something that like threaten them
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know in their territory and you're they feel under threat but otherwise they'd they'd probably not they wouldn't attack us for food if they're starve then well they say wolves never really attack humans much
S0421	oh right
S0423	but i think why they be kill out and stuff be cos they would've attack the livestock like sheep and cattle
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	but humans i think they try to steer clear of
S0421	oh we still have fox don't we yeah
S0423	yeah
S0421	but they eat take livestock but i suppose they're not as like big as wolves be they
S0423	no i guess they could get lamb and chickens they
S0421	chickens
S0423	probably wouldn't get a i wouldn't imagine they'd get well they might get a sheep i don't know but the sheep would be a bite big for them i guess fox population will increase now they've stop fox hunt
S0421	yeah haven't they oh they have stop it haven't they
S0423	yeah
S0421	they want to bring it back in though didn't they
S0423	who do
S0421	conservatives
S0423	well the conservatives be against it
S0421	oh be they
S0421	so they want to bring it in then
S0423	well i don't know whether they be think about it you know when they be they get back in government but they must've think it's gonna be a bite of a controversial issue
S0421	yeah
S0423	a lot of people be against it a lot of conservatives their they the people who like fox hunt will be conservatives
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i guess they weigh up should we do it because the people who want it be our voters but they probably realise the amount of people who be against it
S0421	yeah
S0423	probably would good thing for the election really
S0421	didn't we use to have moose here
S0423	no
S0421	no be they in like cold place
S0423	well like the only area i know about them really be like in canada
S0421	yeah
S0423	they exist anywhere else i don't know cos in scandinavia be it elk
S0421	oh
S0423	rather than moose isn't it
S0421	although those people on that programme be eat moose
S0423	what programme
S0421	that one where they be live in the arctic circle
S0423	yeah oh be that moose
S0421	yeah that be moose
S0423	oh right so that would be it must be in the north where they inhabit
S0421	yeah
S0423	it be like scandinavia wasn't it yeah
S0421	with the reindeer
S0423	i be think it be a different animal elk or
S0421	there be elks be they in canada maybe
S0423	yeah although if you go far back enough er there be all kinds of wild animals here if you go back before the ice age i guess it use to be like a tropical area here didn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	so there be tigers and that kind of thing
S0421	oh
S0423	lions
S0421	wouldn't that be good
S0423	well not really
S0421	see some wild tigers and lions
S0423	you get people be eat by tigers in india still
S0421	yeah but they would they like actively seek you out or be it just if you get in their path
S0423	well i guess generally maybe sometimes if but there be where they tend to go hunt for a tiger and kill it be if they've kill you know obviously if they
S0421	yeah
S0423	kill a human then they might see it as prey then in the future and start actively seek it out no i don't think they do they probably try really try hard to avoid humans tigers don't they
S0421	yeah cos they're mainly in like the the jungle aren't they
S0423	yeah i would imagine yeah
S0421	hide
S0423	and they're they're probably quite a rare thing though aren't they
S0421	and they yeah they're and they're like
S0423	not many of them leave
S0421	they're yeah and they're like quite solitary like you know they don't live in a thing like like lions so tigers they just like hunt on their own and stuff don't they
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think although you know like cos cat like the the cat kind of animals they do tend to kind of like not live in a a group but i think they do live in a group sometimes but they like kind of go off on their own
S0423	yeah they're much more independent mind
S0421	cos i know that cat have erm cos i be quite interest they have like erm a they they live in a matriarchal society so it's the female ones that be like in charge rather than the male ones
S0423	yeah
S0421	so they must have like some form of like society thing go on but i don't think they kind of interact
S0423	some hierarchy probably not quite like a dog cos it's very specific about pack isn't it
S0421	yeah cos they all live in a pack
S0423	yeah
S0421	but lions all live in like a a what's it call a pride
S0423	yeah
S0421	they all like live together don't they but i think
S0423	yeah
S0421	maybe with with other cat it's like a kind of general territory and they might come across each other but not like and they're kind of like kay they're with me they're not an intruder
S0423	yeah well like the male i guess they just don't they're not that bother be they they just don't think much of anything
S0421	yeah
S0423	so the the female have to do the hunt but the male i don't know see the first one that come along get the first
S0421	yeah take the
S0423	choice yeah so he doesn't bother hunt whereas the female
S0421	yeah
S0423	he just kinda laze around
S0421	i think but erm it's the male ones that fight each other
S0423	but he be in charge of it yeah cos he's kind of in charge of the territory
S0421	i know that that's in lions i'm not sure
S0423	yeah the lion he'll say
S0421	yeah
S0423	this be my area
S0421	yeah and all the females one will hunt but if another male lion come along they'll fight it'll fight off
S0423	yeah yeah i guess animals they're territorial aren't they
S0421	their man look really soft i'd like to like to stroke one
S0423	
S0421	yeah do you think they're like soft like their fur like generally do you think it's like soft or do you think it's a bite like more of like a hair
S0423	well it's probably fairly soft
S0421	yeah no it's probably like soft isn't it ah
S0423	well it's like a cat isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	they're still soft aren't they whereas hooved animals like horse and
S0421	yeah cos i stroke erm
S0421	a zebra and a reindeer and they like feel like a bite like a carpet or like a what you wipe your feet on one of them welcome mat
S0421	yeah but on er reindeers they've get erm like on their horn they've get like they're like soft
S0423	what be that when they're first grow or something
S0421	oh maybe
S0421	the ones that i saw be soft
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think that's deers that when they first grow and then they get harder but i don't know about reindeers i think reindeers be a bite different aren't they
S0423	i don't know cos don't they fight with their antlers as well
S0421	yeah but i imagine reindeers might have that soft thing on it cos it's cold
S0423	oh right you mean on outside
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah maybe but you wouldn't've think the the erm the antlers would be the cold would affect them would they
S0421	oh yeah antlers i be call them horn
S0423	the cold there's no there's no nerve and things in them
S0421	yeah
S0423	right where's this what's the name of that service there's one up there
S0421	be it like or something
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah do you remember when i go up to them deer in that park i remember which one it be
S0423	oh in the otter sanctuary
S0421	oh be it that one yeah i think it be and i be go up to it and it be look at me and i think i be gonna get up to it to stroke it
S0423	yeah
S0421	and then that that one with the antlers the male one start like didn't it start like
S0421	grind its hoof against the grind or something and i be like it look like it be gonna charge at me
S0423	i if he start do that he kinda show a bite of interest in
S0421	yeah he just kind of like look at me and be like
S0421	oh i be like oh it's i wouldn't've mind go up to that friendly look deer
S0423	it wouldn't've get close though it wouldn't
S0421	do you think i don't know i be get quite close to it and it be like oh hello
S0423	i guess they're fairly use to
S0421	and then that other one and i be like i don't wanna get charge so i think it start like walk closer to me and i be like mm
S0423	i don't think i'd have the nerve to go up to a lion or anything like that
S0421	not in the wild but i might do at a zoo
S0423	at well a zoo they still they're not tame or anything
S0421	i know but some of them be more use to people aren't they
S0423	yeah but the the keepers don't necessarily go in with them
S0421	some of them do it depend
S0423	i think i think i would just have a natural fear and once they realise you're scar
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	do you hear that lion roar at the lake district
S0421	yeah
S0423	i mean it be quite scary that when you hear the way they roar
S0421	do you know lynxes roar
S0423	be it not more of a
S0423	like a
S0421	a miaow i don't know
S0423	a miaow but you know like er
S0421	it's it's class as a roar
S0423	like a leopard or they go miaow
S0421	i think yeah probably it's class as a roar though because i think the only big cat that doesn't roar be a cheetah
S0423	what do they do
S0421	i don't know they must just kind of
S0423	miaow
S0421	yeah well not miaow i don't know they must make a different like a noise class as something else
S0423	what's a tiger oh tiger yeah they don't roar like a lion but it's like ra
S0421	yeah
S0423	quite deep and
S0421	like a er
S0423	growl yeah
S0421	and it's like a it's almost like a purr underneath but it's a bite more
S0423	yeah it's not it's not like a lion lion
S0421	it's like a roll noise isn't it
S0423	yeah a lion be really really loud
S0421	yeah you can hear it for miles can't you in the in the
S0423	yeah i guess it's part of the territory thing
S0421	yeah but there's like those erm those like animal trainers and things and they just like have wild animal friends don't they
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they're just like walk round with them and like play with them
S0421	i know like i wish i could do that but it's like a natural thing they must have with animals
S0423	yeah do you see that documentary those men who have a pet tiger and they be like a lion
S0421	yeah yeah yeah i erm a lion and then
S0423	that be a lion
S0421	yeah and then at the reunion thing where he come and it recognise them and it come and hug them and it
S0423	yeah i wouldn't be scar at that you'd be think i wonder
S0421	if it recognise them
S0421	but i think those two men go like yeah it's gonna recognise us like he must've and then he bring his erm his like wife the the female lion
S0423	yeah
S0421	he she and then they get to stroke her as well
S0423	yeah and that be a wild lion
S0421	yeah
S0421	and then there be these er i saw it on the internet though these people have a bear and erm they have it from like literally this small i can't remember how they get it but it's grow up with them in their house and it be like sit at the table like they put some food out for it and it be sit round the table with them at thanksgiving
S0423	yeah
S0421	and i be like
S0423	what kind of bear
S0421	what
S0423	what kind of bear be that
S0421	i think it be a grizzly
S0423	it's a bite big to be sit at a din table
S0421	yeah it be massive and that maybe it be a different type of brown bear but it be brown and it have a plate of food and i saw a different article and this man in china have buy two dog but then it turn out as they grow up they be actually bear
S0423	eh
S0421	i know
S0421	i know yeah erm and he be like he think he be a bite suspicious because they do look a bite like bear cub but he er and then as they start erm kill his chickens he think oh this be a bite weird think they these might not be dog but then they grow quite big and he be like yeah they're bear so he be
S0423	do he not realise with the noise that they be make
S0421	he's give them into a a sanctuary now
S0423	what country's that in
S0421	china he buy them off someone and he and he be tell they be dog
S0423	oh right
S0421	but if someone say to me they ah do you want some er this be a these two dog and it be clearly a bear i'd be like i think that's a bear
S0423	yeah must be a
S0421	and it be like some like endanger bear so that's why they're run like a sanctuary now
S0423	mm
S0421	oh i really like panda bear
S0423	go to china and see them in the sanctuary
S0421	be panda bear like they're not vicious be they
S0423	i think they're quite docile aren't they
S0421	yeah they don't i mean i i imagine they've get some like form of attack but they don't really seem it
S0423	never hear about that do you
S0421	yeah i know they look so like so good that the erm people in china in the sanctuaries like the way they like look after them and stuff it look really nice
S0423	yeah i think they're more interest in conserve energy cos they go around eat all day don't they
S0421	yeah because they've get to each so much of the bamboo cos it's get like no nutrients in it like hardly any so they've get to eat all day to actually get something from it
S0423	make you wonder how they get so big though cos they're only small when they baby aren't they
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	there must be something good in the the bamboo to get them that big
S0421	well there be but they have to eat like for i don't know how many hours a day they have to eat kilograms of it i think to actually get
S0423	can't the chinese try and get them use to a different kind of food
S0421	i know i think it's it's just how they've evolve because i think that's what all there be for them to eat and now that's what they eat and then like people cut down the forest and they can't eat anything else
S0423	can't they say here have a peace of or
S0421	probably wouldn't eat it they'd probably eat too much of it then cos they'd think they have to eat it all the time they'd probably be obese
S0423	they look obese
S0421	yes then and then when they erm yeah so i've like watch videos and they erm with like the little ones they build them slide and all the little pandas be slide down the slide and they're like they're really cute they're like furry and they're like run and like play game and stuff and the keepers in one place they dress up as pandas to make the young pandas feel safer when they be like look after them
S0421	they wear they wear big panda suit
S0421	but even the big ones seem so friendly like you could like you could like cuddle them and they look soft
S0421	i don't know i would if i be a keeper well they go in with them like it's fine to go in with them and they like pick up the little ones and stuff
S0423	yeah
S0421	i saw them in with the red pandas as well
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they're so cute and they be like climb on the erm on the keeper like cos they fee them like apples and things and they like try and make it difficult for them to get and they like do puzzle and things but they all they all like they see the keeper come in and then they like run and they're all like latch onto the keeper and they look they be they look so nice and like soft they're really cute
S0423	yeah be they endanger as well the red panda i think they be
S0421	i think so yeah be they in china as well
S0423	yeah
S0421	but the local people at the erm where there's like pandas there be like all this there be like a storm i think or something and it block off like the pandas' route in the forest and all the local people go with some er wildlife volunteer to help and like move away this like blockage and like help the pandas and everything
S0423	yeah
S0421	it's nice and like people keep build like roads as well in the middle of like their areas
S0423	they can't just a build road without permission
S0421	not but like in in the past
S0423	yeah
S0421	do you know what i mean
S0423	i think they realise now that they've get to be protect don't they
S0421	yeah because i think what be it i think be it pandas that they like eat all the bamboo in one place and then they like have to move on
S0423	maybe
S0421	i don't know
S0423	i think the problem be it be a dwindle food source the panda in the forest be
S0421	yeah
S0423	i mean some of that have be because of humans as well so
S0421	yeah
S0423	maybe they're probably gonna start replant them or something i don't know
S0421	because like people can like eat so many different things but then there's like other animals that just like live on this one diet and then they can't change it
S0423	i think we've kind of we've not always be like that we've probably just develop that haven't we
S0421	i wonder what we would eat in the wild we'd probably like forage wouldn't we
S0423	well we be probably originally foragers weren't we
S0421	we wouldn't be able to do much else
S0423	yeah i mean really just berry and
S0421	plant
S0423	vegetables and leave
S0421	yeah
S0423	that kind of thing have eat that before probably a bite like er ape
S0421	yeah fruit
S0423	berry nut that kinda thing i guess at some point we all realise we could eat meat
S0421	it's weird that that's what bear eat isn't it like berry and
S0423	yeah
S0421	but i mean some bird eat fish don't they
S0423	yeah they'll eat fish
S0421	but they just eat like cos you'd think a big bear like that with its claw and everything you'd think it'd be kill animals to eat
S0423	yeah yeah they've get big teeth or something
S0421	yeah
S0421	cos they're really dangerous
S0423	yeah whereas we we don't really have the teeth
S0421	we don't have anything
S0421	and our skin
S0421	it'd cut right through it
S0423	yeah it's funny it well the only thing we have be a brain isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	kind of make us stand out
S0421	yeah if if we didn't like if we couldn't make tool or anything we'd literally be so susceptible to anything like get us
S0423	yeah
S0421	like we don't have claw we don't have teeth
S0423	well
S0421	we probably can't run that fast really
S0423	maybe originally we be furry weren't we
S0421	erm yeah
S0423	well we have a lot more hair didn't we
S0421	yeah
S0423	probably not that much to kind of keep warm i don't know
S0421	maybe kind of like monkey i dunno
S0423	yeah but why would you start lose that fur
S0421	er it might've just be a random like you know like some cos like what i be say be like how strange be it that we still keep the hair on our head
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it's like it cos it maybe it be people with the genes like certain genes and like it could've be even more beneficial at one point like wherever people live for them you know to survive without all this fur or it could've be random like all the people with fur might've die out cos of the famine or something
S0423	mm
S0421	you know like a random thing
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos that do happen sometimes so like the people with those genes die out and then the the people who didn't have fur just live on cos they live in a different area or something
S0423	where be these people with fur why do they develop
S0421	i don't know how we be originally maybe we do originally have fur and then it's like a mutation that someone didn't have fur and then these people survive cos the fur people die in a famine i don't know
S0423	they could be cross breed as well with other
S0421	yeah
S0423	human type species couldn't they
S0421	yeah they do you know they might've be different like versions of people you know because like you get different cat
S0423	yeah
S0421	do you think there be ever like different people like that
S0423	well they know there be there be erm there's a there's one example what what's the erm cos we're homo sapiens there's another type
S0421	oh be there
S0423	i'm sure there be i don't know the name and they think we we all he's er he's get a smaller brain erm i think they might be more physically
S0421	yeah
S0423	stronger than us but er and they say they they must've be interbreed i think everybody have er
S0421	yeah
S0423	a a small percent one of these this kind of species in them
S0421	oh
S0423	their dna
S0421	see there might've be more though we don't know about
S0423	well there might be yeah just cos they've
S0421	they might've yeah
S0423	cos they've get evidence of this
S0421	yeah because i've always find that funny that like it's just like humans and then like in other animals it's like oh this be the big cat family oh this be like the canine family like and then it's like humans it's like everyone's human like one human
S0423	yeah
S0421	there's not not like human blah blah blah and like other human blah blah blah
S0423	well i guess at some point there's variations in kind of thing yeah
S0421	yeah i mean there's that race but
S0423	but i don't
S0421	it's not like you wouldn't you wouldn't really call it like a different species would you
S0423	well no
S0421	you wouldn't be like oh there's other humans like oh what be they they're like
S0423	would you class er er the different kind of cat a lion and tiger they're class as different species aren't they
S0421	i don't know be they like variations or something
S0423	the species be kind of the cat family isn't there
S0421	yeah
S0423	but then again it they with the human thing they'd be part of humanoids wouldn't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	would they be variations on it like cat i suppose or
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	they'd have different characteristics erm
S0421	cos there's so many different type of cat like and dog and and like within
S0423	well dog be they all come from a wolf don't they
S0421	yeah but like within like even like
S0423	well that's through breed human interference that
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos you say riginally
S0421	no but aren't like fox be they like part of the
S0423	oh i don't know
S0421	or maybe they're not
S0423	i don't know if they're class as the same kind of family be they
S0421	maybe there be something else but you kind of think about their like they way they're
S0423	no you never see them be mention do you you know when like you mention canines
S0421	yeah maybe they're not
S0423	but they be they look like em
S0421	they will yeah and they kind of have a bite of a bark don't they well not a bark but the kind of noise they make
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos i think they're they're more of a dog than a cat
S0423	well they're not a cat you know it's it's
S0421	no
S0423	very similar characteristics to a dog isn't it the snout
S0421	yeah
S0423	the claw
S0421	i mean cat have oh i really like cat paw they're like really soft i always like to grab my cat's feet but they don't like it so they pull them away
S0423	no they're different a dog's be quite rough aren't they
S0421	yeah and didn't we use to have tail possibly
S0423	yeah they say we do
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos there's there's the er of your the end of your spine the coccyx bone or something or
S0421	yeah
S0423	so yeah i suppose if you go back far enough then
S0421	i think tail would be quite useful
S0423	well yeah they i don't know i guess i again why would how come they've we've adapt to
S0421	cos you think they'd they'd be useful wouldn't you
S0423	they would yeah they'd be useful for get rid of insects
S0421	but like balance
S0423	well when you're up in the tree yeah but at some point i think maybe we be up the tree and we come down and
S0421	must've never need them any more yeah
S0423	maybe they get in the way of
S0421	yeah maybe predators like grab them or something
S0423	yeah
S0421	who know because there be like you know like when they have like erm like freak show for like people with like extra limbs and things
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think there be someone in there once with like a tail
S0423	yeah
S0421	so it's still possible to be bear with a tail
S0423	no wasn't it something else though and it look like a tail
S0421	maybe
S0423	kind of like a bone er
S0421	yeah but that's what a tail would be
S0423	well part of it would be and rest of it
S0421	yeah yeah
S0421	well there's like be people bear with extra legs and things
S0423	yeah maybe that's like you be say that's where variations come in evolution where
S0421	yeah
S0423	you get separate slightly different and then you know if that gene get pass on and
S0421	cos that's what we learn in gcse biology but there must be a lot more to it but that's what they teach us basically at gcse biology
S0423	yes probably quite a complicate subject isn't it a good sunset
S0421	oh
S0423	it's not as picturesque as the drive to be it well when we be in
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's a lot well flatter
S0421	yeah i like mountains not climb them i like the way they look
S0423	an amaze site when you go up last year wasn't it go up to the
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	just show you how massive a mountain range they be
S0421	i think it'd be nice to live in the mountains
S0423	yeah
S0421	although where would you get your food from
S0423	shop they have shop there
S0421	yeah i know but you they it wouldn't it be expensive cos it'd have to be like import wouldn't it from other areas cos you wouldn't really grow anything on the mountains
S0423	you get some
S0421	yeah
S0423	but any rural areas a bite dearer isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos everything have to come in by road whereas if you're in cities
S0421	no but if you be like in the countryside all the produce would be grow there although i suppose it's still expensive cos it'd be like local farmers wouldn't it
S0423	yeah and if you don't have the local farm then it's it go out of the country to be process
S0421	why do they send it out of the country
S0423	cos
S0421	oh oh i think you
S0423	yeah
S0421	mean like france or something
S0423	no
S0421	i be like why's it go
S0423	but you know even if you're get carrots and things from tesco
S0421	yeah
S0423	they put em in a big truck and then they bring it to a central warehouse
S0421	yeah
S0423	do whatever they want in the
S0421	like the people who like live really far up on the mountains have different lungs
S0423	oh when you live in great altitude
S0421	yeah so they can breathe the air
S0423	yeah you're adapt yeah cos if you're if you're go to stay you're go up climb up in the hill yeah
S0421	to do it gradually
S0423	yeah cos you can get altitude sickness it's very dangerous
S0421	be that like similar to what divers get when they come up too fast
S0423	no i think it's probably different symptoms like they've get
S0421	or be that something
S0423	they've get like the bend
S0421	be that oh isn't that when you get like
S0423	it do something to your blood
S0421	oxygen or like bubble in your blood or something
S0423	yeah yeah it's a different thing so i'm not quite sure not sure i don't know too much about it really but
S0421	cos you always see on the film like people swim up from the depths like erm pursue by a shark like quick quick but if they do that really
S0423	yeah well you have to be really deep though i think to get it
S0421	oh right
S0423	to have that as a consideration
S0421	oh like when the pressure like you but you can hardly really feel it when you go down there can't you
S0423	yeah cos yeah i mean you be you have gotta be far down in the sea for that it's like proper deep sea divers erm they have to go into a decompression thing in the bottom of the ship and they have
S0421	oh
S0423	like a bell or something that that the the air be
S0421	but the the people who
S0423	it's under pressure
S0421	the people who dive for pearl they go down quite far
S0423	i think it's cos they're not down there for long
S0421	and they oh cos they don't even take a tank yeah
S0423	cos they're hold their breath well they're they can probably hold their breath like four five minutes
S0421	seven minutes
S0423	yeah erm i think if you're up and if you're down and up so quick i mean divers the deep sea divers they're down there for you know could be for a long time so that's yeah
S0421	oh right yeah with the tank
S0423	cos so then it's affect your
S0421	oh so when you go in a submarine
S0423	your blood
S0421	do you think you'd have to
S0423	no er yeah well er well you have to be pressurise
S0421	oh like in a plane like in a plane
S0423	don't you yeah so that's when the divers be go if they've be down for hours they have to go into a decompression unit
S0421	oh
S0423	which then the pressure's control in that area they they spend it so they have to kind of pretty much they may live in there if they're do dive over a couple of weeks
S0421	yeah
S0423	then when they come up they stay there and sleep there and when they're okay they go back down for another dive so it's kind of think it'd be it's quite highly pay do that job
S0421	yeah well it'd be dangerous wouldn't it
S0423	well yeah it must be we're in now
S0421	oh i don't know if i'd go in a submarine
S0423	yeah but i mean it'd be very cramp
S0423	suffocate wouldn't it
S0421	yeah like you'd think that you would be in a plane but in a plane it's not bad but in like a submarine you you're like surround by water it's like press in
S0423	well if if you let your imagination get carry away i suppose the thing be in a submarine they in a plane you just go off for a couple of hours but they spend months
S0421	oh
S0423	on a submarine don't they
S0421	i know then it's all that horrible and metal isn't it and like it can't be very comfortable
S0423	they must have things in there to do
S0421	what do they do in submarine
S0423	what do you mean
S0421	what be they do why be they down there
S0423	well the reason we have submarine now
S0421	yeah
S0423	er well for the
S0421	spy
S0423	well no it's er they have submarine with cruise missiles in them
S0421	oh
S0423	which be with a an atomic warhead
S0421	yeah
S0423	so instead of have from a land base where your enemies would know where they be
S0421	yeah
S0423	you can go down so deep in a submarine and sail anywhere in the world
S0421	yeah
S0423	and they won't know you're there so
S0421	oh can they not trace that with like
S0423	well there be ways of that
S0421	sonar
S0423	well there's there be plan that go up have equipment to try to find you
S0421	yeah
S0423	obviously it's like a cat and mouse game isn't it
S0423	they try not to be find so er and they have other submarine out there erm try to make sure there's none of yours so you sonar and you can trace each other can't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm
S0421	so you're like oh there they be and thing's like oh there they be
S0423	well yeah they do they go off on exercise to i guess to to test themselves
S0421	yeah in the submarine that
S0423	but recently the erm there's be russian submarine spot in swedish water
S0421	oh
S0423	you know since there's a bite of unease now between like russia and the west
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos of ukraine and since then russia have be you know they they russian submarine be spot in areas where they didn't use to be and er and they they fly plan close to our country bombers and things
S0421	really
S0423	and we have to send up our jet fighters just to kind of stay close to them say
S0421	yeah
S0423	we know you're here don't come into our airspace and it's just a bite of a
S0421	a cold war brew
S0423	well you saw that's what you saw be happen in the cold war and it's like them say to us you know we're still around and
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know we have all of this stuff we can do so don't mess with us
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	see what see what it say on the thing there so
S0421	junction twenty seven what do you want me to read
S0423	yeah so the next one what do it say on the next one then
S0421	service
S0423	keep go down through each section see what it tell me if i need to turn off or anything
S0421	service area service area
S0423	you don't have to read it all just tell me like when i'm
S0423	where be i leave the
S0421	leave
S0423	so
S0421	the at junction thirty one
S0423	right
S0421	then merge onto the signpost
S0423	alright that'll do till we get a bite closer then you can read it out again
S0421	i feel like
S0423	still get about a hundred miles to go so
S0421	feel like i read that quite professionally
S0423	yeah very loud and clear
S0423	you could get a job as satnav
S0421	i know i could yeah or like someone who read stuff
S0423	what like a storyteller
S0421	nooo i don't know like they i where else where do you hear like like erm tannoys in shop or like you know like instruction things or
S0423	well you're too good for british rail you never understand them
S0423	feel like they're hold their nose
S0421	maybe maybe they need me
S0423	you could be a broadcaster
S0421	yeah
S0423	this be the news
S0423	from bong
S0423	bong yeah i could imagine you do that or do the weather
S0421	yeah you know what to be a a weather person you need to be a meteorologist
S0423	yeah
S0421	like the people who do the weather actually the people who work out the weather
S0423	i know they're very qualify
S0421	yeah
S0423	you could do the tube mind the gap
S0421	yeah
S0423	speak clock
S0421	what speak clock
S0423	if you dial it use to be if you dial on the phone one two three
S0421	oh right
S0423	somebody say it will be er one twenty two and thirteen second and you know so it will be i don't know what it say exactly so it will be
S0421	yeah
S0423	the time be now and then it'll say the time you know keep repeat it
S0421	yeah
S0423	like for all the different time i don't know if it still exist
S0421	really
S0423	yeah
S0421	but you know the erm when you're on the train and they say we be now arrive and it tell you like the platform or whatever erm that's
S0423	yeah
S0421	the conductor who say it
S0423	be it
S0421	yeah they go into their little cabin and then they speak it
S0423	how do you know
S0421	i've notice i've be on so many train cos it it like and that's why it's like muffle
S0423	have you
S0421	you know like it's not that clear usually it's a bite it's cos it's not prerecord it's like them they go in and they say it
S0423	well tube i don't think it be very smooth
S0421	no
S0423	the next platform but
S0421	no yeah on the tube cos it's quite professional on the tube but on northern rail
S0423	oh you mean you're on the train to
S0421	yeah i think most of like the the normal train be like that
S0423	yeah most of the ones yeah
S0421	but it's so funny on that laurel and hardy where they're like listen for like this the this train will stop at and it's like ru ru ru ru ru ru ru and then it's like and then it say the the one they're go to really clearly do you remember that one
S0423	be that when they're on the sleep thing
S0421	yeah it's the and they're like listen and they're like and it's just like gibberish
S0423	i can't remember that bite
S0421	and then it's so funny cos you know on like when you struggle to hear what they're say on the on the tannoy and you're like what what be they say
S0423	yeah
S0421	it be always good on mine though like when it say erm it when it where it stop at and then it say them all really clearly and by the end of the year i know all the stop that my train take because every morning i'd hear it
S0423	i'm surprise they announce it you're not gonna need it to be announce you can look out the window see where it's stop can't you
S0421	no but when you're on the platform yeah i know they announce it but like but in case you can't see it i suppose depend where you're sit
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they announce it just before you arrive you know in case you don't know where you're go you need to like prepare yourself but yeah on on the platform cos like i obviously didn't go to all the place like cos i get off at and it go all the way to
S0423	oh right
S0421	and it would announce all the place and i be like as it go on the in the morning i be like go through it in my head with the with the woman who speak it out
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah never even be to those place in my life
S0423	would you like to go
S0421	no i don't know what's in probably not much it sound like an industrial town
S0423	yeah it's basically you go you follow in a straight line from
S0421	yeah it go through
S0423	go through to and
S0421	yeah
S0423	er
S0421	yeah
S0423	they're all the towns go across the top of
S0421	and
S0423	yeah it's near er it's not far from that witches' place
S0421	
S0423	it go through that yeah that's out there
S0421	ah
S0423	towards there so i guess the surround countryside either side of the town must be quite you know it's like and
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	like
S0421	it be always
S0423	like that be
S0421	the next train to arrive at platform one be the o seven twenty seven northern service to
S0423	you sound very professional
S0421	and then it would go through all the station it's quite a lot
S0423	so that wouldn't be difficult and that's record
S0421	yeah that one's record but when like on the way and it's like next platform will be and it's like
S0423	yeah
S0421	that that's the one that's the conductor
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it's quite muffle because it's them say it but like when it's like erm so yeah they be record now but when it's like the tannoy i i always find it hard to hear because some when it's like platform alteration and some guy it's just a random person say it because whatever the platform be gonna be so they're like the platform one train and like you're try to hear and i'm like be that my train hope it's not my train like where do i have to go
S0423	oh no i hate how they
S0421	and then they'll like repeat it and i'll be listen extra hard and i'll be like i i don't know what you're say where we once and they be like we need to hear it for something and we just we just could not understand what they be say
S0423	in
S0421	probably probably at the train station in
S0423	might've be but it be very confuse the station there i suppose it's quite simple really
S0421	yeah
S0423	like different languages
S0421	yeah over here probably wouldn't get get much
S0423	at the airport i think it's probably different languages but station be the the big main station wasn't it er where they have those
S0421	yeah well at they have a machine with different languages
S0423	yeah
S0421	and the erm the dispenser things
S0423	but it's it's so you know be english be just so helpful
S0421	cos cos even at the tiny station
S0423	cos everybody know
S0421	they can they can at least help you
S0423	yeah
S0421	but over here if you be a i dunno like there's like a man sit in the booth who probably only speak english
S0421	you know and like if you weren't from a foreign country that'd be so difficult
S0423	yeah
S0421	like you'd have to know
S0423	you always manage somehow you you either show them a map or
S0421	yeah
S0423	say the place name they figure out what you're try to do you know if you're in europe or they're europeans we can always somehow figure it out i think it become more difficult when there's a big cultural difference
S0421	yeah
S0423	like in asia or somewhere like that
S0421	yeah and like as well like when their alphabet's different
S0423	so well yeah cos in erm
S0421	cos you'd be like
S0423	in europe you can see and say have an idea of some place name
S0421	you'd yeah so like cos imagine like like japan
S0423	yeah
S0421	like i need to get to tokyo and like you would you'd be look on the machine and you'd be like erm
S0423	well yeah if it wasn't in english i would be
S0421	you'd be like well oh i mean in japan like they would like in the main like tokyo they would have the english probably
S0423	yeah if you're in some of the other you know like southeast asian countries
S0421	yeah
S0423	that where they're not use to tourists and you'd just have their language wouldn't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	you'd be like well i haven't get a clue where i'm go i suppose it's easier nowadays you could have stuff like your phone satnav or something to
S0421	yeah but even even like japan's hard to navigate because although there be like english options it be quite difficult
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think cos they're not gonna have it everywhere even on the or on the machine they probably do but then a lot of sign and map and things'll probably be in japanese and you'll just be like
S0423	yeah and it'll only be like in big cities where they'll have something for the tourists
S0421	yeah
S0423	once you go out it'll all be er probably just in japanese won't it i'm sweat it's get really hot in here
S0421	i know i don't know we're go further south
S0423	yeah it's funny in this country there's not massive difference in
S0421	there be a little bite
S0423	when you go from one end to i mean in in just what you see as well say you go from to
S0421	oh right yeah
S0423	the architecture the the the erm terrain around you and the the er erm you know the plant and the tree they're different completely because there's such a big difference in climate
S0421	yeah
S0423	when you're go er cos you go quite far down south the same in as well
S0421	yeah
S0423	you're really
S0421	yeah
S0423	because you're travel down you know it's the difference whereas
S0421	here it's just like
S0423	here cos it's green everywhere isn't it it's all green this country whereas when you head further south in and you tend to go more the less green isn't it
S0421	yeah you know right cos i mean like in the heatwave that we've have it's be like i dunno like what five degrees warmer like maybe down south
S0423	yeah
S0421	than up north right i know it's about five degree and they get a bite less rain i'd imagine er
S0423	yeah so there be erm
