S0261	erm this guy who have kind of discover this thing about how you sleep and how your body be and how it relate to earth and erm he be an electrician and erm so when you have get electricity you have to make it go back to the earth you make it grind you go to go you have to connect it to the grind
S0262	mm
S0261	and so he be kind of old and he be in pain and he notice how much kind of electricity there just be around you and stuff
S0262	right
S0261	and he start think about it and he be think about how humans aren't really connect to the earth they're not connect to the grind
S0262	mm
S0261	like they use to be yeah because you walk around with shoe that be insulate erm and that you drive place that you be in build yeah
S0262	mm mm
S0261	so your body your feet don't really touch the grind yeah they're insulate from the grind so what he erm because there be all this electricity around he find it out in his bedroom there be a lot of electricity come from his wall and the appliances and all this kind of stuff
S0262	oh
S0261	so what he do be he erm create this thing that help insulate him from erm from from the electricity so he be in a kind of an electricity neutral zone yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	which he call a ground mat yeah so this thing help his body avoid the electricity i think be what they be kind of suggest and erm after years of be on medication he have to take medication to be able to go to sleep he erm he find out that on the first night that he use this thing he sleep without his medication for the first time in years yeah and erm so people do a few more study into this kind of stuff and the effectiveness of grind mat and stuff erm the same people who be physically not that well and their body have get a lot of inflammation in them and you can measure how much inflammation or where the inflammation be by use heat sensors
S0262	mm
S0261	because your body be inflame it be give off heat around these sit yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	so they simply have one of those colour
S0262	like infrared or something
S0261	those colour vision type
S0262	mm
S0261	match
S0262	mm mm
S0261	of erm how people look after have you know the the comparison between before and afters yeah of be ground and not ground
S0262	mm
S0261	and that inflammation go away so it show quite a big impact right so i be kind of think that since we have be back from our trip and my body's more stiff than it use to be even though we use to move around a lot and do a lot of physical stuff
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and it make me think when we be travel we be connect to the grind quite a lot
S0262	mm
S0261	and we sleep on the grind
S0262	yeah
S0261	like you know swag and stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	and we be a lot closer to that and i always kind of think most of the time we have a really good sleep at night
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah even though it be not in a bed
S0262	mm
S0261	not in a house all of that kind of stuff right
S0262	mm yeah
S0261	so it make me wonder whether there be kind of a connection in that you know
S0262	mm
S0261	the idea of just simply be more on the land
S0262	mm yeah i mean we use to do a lot of beach walk
S0261	mm
S0262	didn't we so
S0261	take your shoe off
S0262	yeah erm yeah and sort of be in the sea and be connect with nature and be away from a lot of electricity
S0261	mm
S0262	because we really weren't really very near electricity quite a lot of the time you know
S0261	yeah
S0262	because we be well away from house and build so yeah
S0261	it's an interest think innit
S0262	mm it be yeah it be and especially what i notice be in a place like this house where things be leave on standby
S0261	mm
S0262	there be like some kind of low level hum
S0261	mm mm
S0262	of these erm you know machine
S0261	appliances
S0262	well appliances yeah leave on particularly televisions
S0261	mm mm
S0262	and those sky box
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm and i think it would be interest if you just turn everything off and get into a habit of not really have anything on standby
S0261	you don't need it on at night time
S0262	no
S0261	erm you just turn it off at the wall
S0262	well dad use to have this thing when you know when mum be alive that she have so many different appliances in the live room stack on top of each other
S0261	mm
S0262	that he'd actually have you know program for it for everything to switch off at night
S0261	mm
S0262	no no standby i don't know what happen to that idea erm i will have to ask him but yeah i mean i think it really help not have anything electrical in your bedroom while you're sleep
S0261	yeah
S0262	but i still think yeah i think there be in a way too many appliances in this house that be sort of conduct electricity
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm yeah i think that's it that's i mean that's probably why go camp be so relax too you know it's erm it be it's get away from electricity
S0261	yeah it be interest that i hadn't think of it
S0262	mm
S0261	but even i wonder if you just kind of get into the habit of not erm walk around with your shoe on when you be inside yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	and when you be outside when it be like warm enough and that just down on the grass you don't really need your shoe on
S0262	mm
S0261	if you be at home and that
S0262	mm
S0261	and so you just kind of get that feel of the earth
S0262	mm yeah
S0261	i wonder what that be
S0262	a plane
S0261	don't you think it sound like an old plane
S0262	mm it's quite hot again
S0261	yeah it be nice you can see the shadow's kind of come over quite a bite now isn't it in our autumn
S0262	mm
S0261	it be only like a couple of weeks ago the shadow be back close to the house so there be a lot more lawn to lie around on
S0262	mm
S0261	and now it be just like well half of it
S0262	i know the clock go whatever backwards forward twenty sixth october i think
S0261	oh there's another whole month
S0262	mm
S0261	wow
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay yeah well it be not i suppose it be still what when its get dark seven o'clock at the moment
S0262	mm well even just after
S0261	mm yeah okay so it be not too much to worry about time wise at the moment
S0262	excuse me
S0261	that be charm appreciation of your food mm
S0262	it could have be a lot worse
S0261	a frenchman would be proud of you
S0262	yeah the japanese or chinese or something like that
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm i get quite lose actually go into and come out of yesterday it be quite strange get lose really not kind of know where i be go to end up i kind of have a vague idea of the orientation but really didn't know how these roads be mean to be work together so what i do be i want to go up to i think i come off on the wrong turn i come off the first turn after you get onto the
S0261	mm
S0262	then there's this roundabout it look like it be the or something that take you into then i realise just as i be go into the town at exactly the time when people be pick up their children so i be sort of around i think oh i will cut through to try to get up to you know where live
S0261	mm
S0262	so i take some kind of road call or something
S0261	uh huh
S0262	that's sort of around the back of the back
S0261	yeah
S0262	and that's actually where all the school be so i get completely and utterly clog through with all these mums and dads pick up their kid
S0261	oh
S0262	and then i come up to this other road and it be quite a good road because it be the road where start and there be erm erm park spot on the side of the road up until five you have to pay and then after that you don't have to pay
S0261	okay
S0262	so what i do be i arrive at half past four pay my fifty p for thirty minutes and that be it for the whole night i only pay fifty p for park and all i have to do be then walk past you know where we go to the solicitor and the hall
S0261	yeah
S0262	i just walk down that hillish thing
S0261	and then it be straight down
S0262	and straight down into town
S0261	mm
S0262	okay you know it's about a ten minute walk
S0261	mm mm
S0262	it be quite straightforward though
S0261	it be not too far down to the be it
S0262	not at all
S0261	on
S0262	so that's kind of quite a good little spot so anyway i be come home at night and i just think oh i will just drive right up that road erm think that i be gonna be on and then i be about to join the
S0261	oh
S0262	oh my god and then i saw this erm sign for the
S0261	yes
S0262	oh okay that's something i do know
S0261	mm mm
S0262	i'll go off there thankfully i kind of manage to figure out that i need to move towards because i know where that be
S0261	mm right
S0262	and then from i get to and i get out to and out
S0261	so you come round that way
S0262	so i come really on the back roads
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	but it be a little kind of strange not really feel like
S0261	you know where you be go
S0262	be this gonna work out
S0261	so you could have also erm head back into town if you come past the and then turn onto the
S0262	yeah that's where i think i be go to be but i actually look at the map
S0261	it's a biplane
S0262	ah
S0261	i hope he be not go to erm kind of conk out like the other one do the other day
S0262	that would be fun wouldn't it we should make some friends with some pilot at i be just go to go for a little pootle on saturday afternoon would you like to come with me yes please erm yeah so anyway the roads up that way i mean what i figure out be if you do approach it from that direction it be actually really good because there those roads be not as i don't think they be not as well use as the one up our way like the one that take you through you know that's such a massive thing cos you come off the you've get a massive roundabout you're gonna go into then you have get to get into well it's the most direct route but i think it can take forever when it's really busy in so what i think be i'll go through go up the and try and get in get in loop in that way
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	and i think on a on a on a not not at the school you know picky uppy time it's actually fine
S0261	go in on the
S0262	yeah i think it be it be just you have get to pick your time
S0261	mm mm mm
S0262	but it be quite good to know that erm you can park up there from five o'clock there's quite a lot of space off the side of the road you're not go to get do and you don't have to pay
S0261	mm
S0262	and i think that's great because otherwise i've be park in the car park and you have to still pay up until seven o'clock on a monday to saturday and that's four pound for two hours which be no good
S0261	and you've still get it sound like they're out play today that's like the third plane isn't it be it the same guy that's do a funny loop
S0262	no i think he's a different
S0261	mm
S0262	have fun over there
S0261	he's kind of a noisier one
S0262	mm
S0262	its funny how they do that isn't it
S0261	wow he's kind of go down straight into the grind
S0262	i know
S0261	i hope he's gonna pull up
S0262	oh look he be look oh look he's do an acrobat look there you go yeah
S0261	be he do a circle loop the loop
