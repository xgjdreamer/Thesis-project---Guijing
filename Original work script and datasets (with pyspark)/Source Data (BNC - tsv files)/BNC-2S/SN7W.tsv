S0262	yeah
S0354	unless you'd always come and you know the routine erm people be go then on holiday to the south

S0262	mm
S0354	erm we well he notice erm an advertisement in the telegraph
S0262	mm
S0354	erm erm a holiday company be offer erm package holiday over here

S0262	right
S0354	what it be now it be a erm i mean i haven't be i have to say i haven't be in the itself so i'm sure the itself hasn't change that much cos it be a delightful
S0262	right
S0354	delightful place a a lovely family that erm be run it and i think still do and they have a house here as well in erm but i mean this be the other end of the earth then from the
S0262	right okay yeah sure
S0354	er and none of the house round there be build it
S0262	right
S0354	be just from the it be all wild field
S0262	oh
S0354	and you could wander down erm across the road
S0262	gosh how lovely
S0354	and onto the sea there be nothing there no supermarkets and
S0262	gosh
S0354	you know it be wild
S0262	wow
S0354	erm
S0262	sound divine
S0354	yeah well it well it it's because of things like that that some of the locals resent the development here cos they say it spoil the island
S0262	mm mm
S0354	i mean a lot of good things have come
S0262	true
S0354	erm but it isn't the same as it be
S0262	mm
S0354	and that's what the islanders resent some of them
S0262	i see yeah
S0354	erm but it be beautiful i mean it be it be just lovely and we love it and we do what erm so many brits in er our position do we be so take with it and property price be so low at the time
S0262	mm
S0354	and we be come up to retirement
S0262	mm
S0354	and we be think wouldn't it be nice to
S0262	mm
S0354	have a house in the sun

S0354	and we immediately buy a bungalow
S0262	right okay while you be on holiday
S0354	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0354	yeah three days in three days into the holiday
S0262	fantastic
S0354	erm we saw we we saw some we be look at estate agents and that look good er and then about two days before we leave we we erm choose the plot and er
S0262	gosh
S0354	put down the deposit and leave
S0262	that must've be very excite
S0354	it be very it it be very excite it be the advent of a very excite time actually because
S0262	mm
S0354	we'd always plan to retie in canada
S0262	right oh okay
S0354	yeah we'd always have contact in canada we'd even get a holiday cottage or part of a holiday cottage in canada erm and plan to retire then of course as we get older we state to think about old bone and cold weather in the winter
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	so this place be then to balance
S0262	mm
S0354	the you know the canada this be to be for
S0262	the cold yeah
S0354	winter months and
S0262	oh i see yeah
S0354	canada summer months but if we be go to spend long months in canada then we didn't want to stay where we already have our holiday home
S0262	right
S0354	because it be way up in the wilds of
S0262	right
S0354	er miles from anywhere er and it be me really i think would've be quite happy to have
S0262	yeah
S0354	spend all day with his twenty six acres of tree
S0262	the right one yeah oh right twenty six acres
S0354	and and his and his kayak on the lake
S0262	oh the kayak yeah
S0354	where you where you can er see yeah

S0354	we get erm sea kayak it be a sea lake it be a huge
S0354	huge sea lake we be on before

S0262	a bite more than that yeah yeah yeah
S0354	a a little bite of culture
S0262	right
S0354	so we decide if we be go to do that then we be go to have to look nearer the capital
S0262	mm
S0354	which we the same year that we buy the first bungalow here within a month of buy the bungalow here we'd go to canada for a week and buy a house in canada
S0262	have you gosh you're snap them up
S0354	well it get it get to a point i mean they we come we come back to england and put the house in on the market
S0262	right okay
S0354	sell that
S0262	mm
S0354	very quickly
S0262	okay
S0354	and realise that it we be go to take possession of the canada house in the july but if you know we do that we would come back to england in the september
S0262	mm
S0354	and we'd have nowhere to live
S0262	mm
S0354	so i promptly go out and buy a house in that be small
S0354	a small house tiny house in which mean we buy and sell we buy three house and sell one house all in the space of two and a half months
S0262	wow gosh that's a lot to be say because it's not an easy process
S0354	it be unbelievable
S0262	oh it would've be stressful i would imagine too

S0262	yeah
S0354	it be unbelievable but we do it and it be fun

S0262	oh be you ski what's it like there
S0354	fabulous
S0262	be it
S0354	we've ski before and i ski before there erm he won't go now because he know that if he go he would have to ski he couldn't tell himself he
S0262	right
S0354	couldn't ski and he's he's frighten of fall i think erm he's
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	nearly eighty you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	and it it you know
S0262	yeah you've gotta that's right
S0354	erm yeah
S0262	you've gotta think about these things
S0354	terrify of break anything
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	but erm i i don't know how i shalln't do much ski
S0262	yeah
S0354	but erm it's really for to go there i mean he's just six he's
S0262	oh i see
S0354	ski twice before
S0262	yeah
S0354	but not as a ski holiday
S0262	yeah
S0354	so he's very excite
S0262	wonderful
S0262	so where d'you fly into
S0354	erm we fly to istanbul
S0262	right
S0354	and then we take the bus erm from erm the otogar in istanbul to bursa
S0262	mm mm
S0354	erm and then the last time we go and i think we shall probably do the same erm you can take taxis up the mountain top
S0262	right
S0354	there be there be
S0262	yeah
S0354	erm and there's even a cable car
S0262	be there
S0354	but
S0262	and how long do it take say from when you arrive at the airport to get up to the resort be it a couple of hours or
S0354	er a bite longer than than bite i mean from the arrival at the airport you've get to get across istanbul to the otogar
S0262	oh i see
S0354	so that's er i mean that's we go by taxi i mean there be all sort of ways of go but when you've get luggage it's the quick easy way
S0262	mm
S0354	to go by taxi
S0262	mm
S0354	erm the the bus run to bursa i think pretty well every half hour
S0262	right
S0354	because erm some go just to bursa and some go through to izmir so
S0262	right
S0354	they go that way along the the sea of marmara and and you know erm to izmir so there's plenty of opportunity to
S0262	right
S0354	hop on a bus and it's very cheap
S0262	yeah
S0354	and i think it i can't remember how long it take actually cos it be late at night when we go the last time we're go sort of mid afternoon
S0262	mm
S0354	this time so
S0262	mm
S0354	it should be different but it's quite nice because the bus go on the ferry across the end of the sea of marmara so it's quite a nice
S0262	oh wonderful yeah
S0354	ferry ride it
S0262	yeah
S0354	be nice this time because it's daytime you know it be night before
S0262	yeah you get to see something yeah
S0354	and then i suppose it's about erm an hour erm and a just over
S0262	yeah
S0354	an hour's drive then down to erm bursa
S0262	and what's the altitude like of the mountains there
S0354	it's six thousand feet
S0262	okay
S0354	so it's
S0262	yeah
S0354	they've get load of snow at the moment absolutely load
S0262	oh right
S0354	the biggest problem be because it's not that high there can be load of snow and it can be a bite heavy
S0262	oh right okay
S0354	you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	but erm but they've get all bits of ski gear and everything
S0262	yeah
S0354	up there you know it be erm
S0262	yeah so you rent your ski and yeah yeah
S0354	yeah oh yeah and i mean it's the centre er which be the ski centre there proper ski village all the hotels be on the slop they've all get their own
S0262	mm
S0354	erm ski school they've all get their own
S0262	wonderful
S0354	they actually even have their own ski lift it's not like if you go to france or italy where you buy a pass for the
S0262	mm mm
S0354	entire area
S0262	mm mm mm mm
S0354	it's very parochial here and they all have their own little
S0262	yeah
S0354	plot you know
S0262	yeah yeah that sort of make sense though because if you
S0354	yeah
S0262	like ski near to your accommodation quite a lot of people do that's that's fabulous yeah
S0354	oh it's very good it's i mean actually it it erm you know it's fabulous because you go out in the morning in your you go out of one door and straight into another and and once you've hire your boot they've get them there wait for they recognise you
S0262	yeah
S0354	they're hold them out for you

S0354	it it's great you know there's
S0262	yeah well you don't get that in france in the french alps you know not at all everyone's scour about for their
S0354	no nor the dolomites where we normally ski

S0262	yeah it's funny how we've never really be able to pull that off in the uk i mean i suppose there's
S0354	mm
S0262	not be much need for it but
S0354	no
S0262	in term of you know families who be bilingual can you think of many i can't
S0354	i can't think of any any school i mean
S0262	that teach
S0354	not that there be none in our area there be no school in our area that weren't
S0262	yeah
S0354	english school teach english and teach any other language as a second
S0262	no i can't
S0354	er second language
S0354	i mean in my school we teach
S0262	no
S0354	french first german as a second option and you know and er it we also teach russian
S0262	really
S0354	we do teach russian but and we we be one of two school in at the time that be teach russian but it's very much erm the circumstances it's down to starve if you happen to have employ a french teacher who's second language be russian then you offer russian
S0262	i see okay
S0354	it be very much like that
S0262	that's how right yeah
S0354	and we do happen to have er a teacher that have that have work for the erm originally erm for the er foreign office in russia
S0262	right
S0354	and
S0262	so they would take an exam in russian then or would it just be a
S0354	oh yeah so take they like we use to learn french in school
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	erm they learn russian in school and they take gcse russian you know
S0262	okay right yeah
S0354	as another
S0262	and be that an elective then for some for some of these for the with the school that you be you know so would many people really go for it
S0354	no
S0262	and
S0354	it be quite elitist
S0262	mm
S0354	they only the best linguists would've take russian and
S0262	do russian yeah
S0354	you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	but we use to take the children to russia we we use to have exchange
S0262	oh right well of course yeah i mean actually russia be kinda an educational destination isn't it for school a bite people do like go there
S0354	well absolutely we we i mean you we always do the traditional german exchange and french exchange
S0262	yeah
S0354	we have our exchange school germany in er germany in kassel erm with the gymnasium in kassel and with erm erm a secondary school in dijon erm but in the early days pre glasnost we use to just take the children for a week's holiday
S0262	mm
S0354	in russia we use to fly to erm leningrad
S0262	mm mm yeah
S0354	saint petersburg but it be leningrad then
S0262	yeah
S0354	and erm and do the leningrad bite and you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	peter the great and er we'd have perhaps three days in leningrad and then on the train down to moscow four days in moscow
S0262	wonderful
S0354	the the ballet and the circus and the things you do in and it and round the kremlin and it well it be very interest
S0262	yeah
S0354	but we but then after glasnost we be actually the first state comprehensive school that do a russian exchange an actual exchange
S0262	oh wonderful
S0354	family exchange mm
S0262	that's very interest
S0354	mm
S0262	and so the kid obviously respond well i mean the british kid really like be in russia and enjoy the exchange
S0354	yes they find it very different
S0262	yeah
S0354	and i have to say i mean the exchange when the exchange take place it be right at the end of my career i mean i've be retire now for eighteen years
S0262	mm mm
S0354	erm but erm we as far as i remember there be no real problems with it except that the children find the home very different
S0262	mm
S0354	whereas in cos germany and france they be similar to
S0262	to yeah really yeah yeah
S0354	and i mean you could you if you do the placements carefully you could place children in home that be very similar to their own
S0262	right okay
S0354	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0354	whereas that be not the case necessarily in russia
S0262	no
S0354	erm and i always one amuse time when i i go with the party when it be visit rather than exchange and we have to in those days stay at the international hotels so there be only the few hotels that you be allow to stay in
S0262	oh right okay
S0354	erm er but we always visit the erm english speak school
S0262	right
S0354	in er moscow and we'd always communicate with them so we always have a an organise visit to the english school and everyone of course be in perfect uniform and very quiet all go about their task
S0262	mm
S0354	all very organise
S0262	yeah
S0354	er and be pastoral deputy and very conscious of discipline erm i say to the head er how do you keep discipline you know what happen if somebody misbehave and she pull herself up to her full five foot four
S0354	look me as closely as she could in the eye and say discipline we have no problem with discipline
S0354	so i think yeah you're probably like the school in england that say they don't have a drug problem you know
S0262	yes yeah that's it yeah
S0354	erm dream on er
S0262	yeah
S0354	so i say
S0262	yeah
S0354	you must have children that occasionally you know
S0262	of course yeah
S0354	step out of line and
S0262	yeah the children
S0354	test the system and she say well yes we do she say but only once she say we er if that happen we inform the parent and if it happen twice we take the parents' party card
S0262	the parents' party card
S0354	which mean of course
S0262	gosh
S0354	father would lose his job if he hadn't get a party card so my goodness me no child step out of line
S0262	no way oh my gosh to be responsible for your dad lose his job
S0354	that
S0262	or mum yeah
S0354	yeah it be very interest
S0262	what a interest set up yeah
S0354	mm yeah it be we have some very very interest time with the russians
S0262	yeah
S0354	i i take a a russian party of course the the kid that come be the children of er party members the elite
S0262	mm mm
S0354	erm the children that go to the english school in moscow
S0262	mm
S0354	be you know princes of the regime
S0262	right okay yeah
S0354	you know and princesses and
S0262	goodness me
S0354	i i take the party one day coach party of them down to brighton for the day lovely day take them onto the beach the the russian teachers come with us all the russian teachers want to do be get among the shop
S0262	mm
S0354	they go home lade with even televisions they be lade to their eye
S0354	and it be a case that they you know they they could get anything they like onto aeroflot flight you know
S0262	yes right yeah
S0354	and erm they be just stagger meanwhile i be leave to erm watch the kid on the beach and see that nobody drown or anything well honestly i can say i have never witness such an array of designer beachwear in my life
S0262	really
S0354	and at the time i have never see such array an array of expensive cameras video cameras those kid have everything
S0262	my gosh
S0354	mm and unless you'd be involve in this you would have no idea
S0262	yeah
S0354	no idea because you think oh you know the poor russians
S0262	yeah
S0354	yes the vast majority be
S0262	but not these cos yeah
S0354	in the communist system there be very much an elite
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	mm
S0262	and how do they behave i mean do they behave as kid would
S0354	the russians actually behave quite well we never have erm a problem
S0262	right
S0354	with the behaviour of the russians i have to say i think they be so condition
S0262	mm not to step out line yeah yeah
S0354	not to step out of line they be spoil and they you know and truculent
S0262	yeah
S0354	but but they didn't step out of line i have to say if i'm honest we never have a problem with the germans either erm because they come from a very middle class area and it be the grammar school
S0262	mm
S0354	and
S0262	mm
S0354	and they be all work hard for abitur and they
S0262	mm
S0354	it be very important to them and you know
S0262	oh yeah yeah
S0354	they take everything very seriously the germans
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	but the french be
S0262	nightmare
S0354	on more than one occasion we have the police round
S0354	they'd be er er they'd they'd be round erm woolworths nick stuff from woolworths and
S0262	oh no
S0354	honestly it be and their back be full of trinkets and
S0262	d'you remember when woolworths have the pick n' mix
S0354	yes yes
S0262	and many people would be shoplift on their front you know
S0354	it be just it be just grist to the mill to these erm
S0262	oh
S0354	french kid
S0262	oh dear
S0354	so we we have we i mean terrible awful cos we'd on exchange we never send anybody home the only time i've ever know a kid send home be on a ski trip
S0262	yeah actually that's funny you should say that because i think that's the only time i know of anyone who get send home
S0354	yeah
S0262	be on a ski trip
S0354	yeah
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	and he he get i mean he should never we tell i mean the city management tell the teacher that be take the party and there be several quite senior members of staff on the party and we say do not take do not take oh he's alright with me he's just he just play everybody else up he's fine with me you know the type
S0262	oh yeah oh dear
S0354	and
S0262	take his life into his own hand
S0354	by the time we go by coach and i think they'd go to switzerland so they it be quite a journey by coach but by the time they get there he have stow booze and all sort on the coach he be high as a kite he be throw his weight around
S0262	oh okay
S0354	so they take him to the airport put him on the first flight
S0262	do they
S0354	bear mind that we're in they put him on the the first flight out which be to birmingham
S0262	oh no oh no
S0354	so i i get a phone call i get a phone call
S0262	he's a bad lad he's gonna have to go to birmingham
S0354	i know i know i know i i i get a phone call early on the sunday morning the sunday morning they couldn't get hold of the head because the head have go to church but they there be a fair chance they'd get hold of me on a sunday morning would i get hold of the s they and they be because the you can imagine the type of family it be if the kid be like that the family be be fairly elusive i'd get to get hold of the s and get one of the s up to birmingham to collect their
S0262	oh gosh
S0354	child from the airport
S0262	oh no
S0354	well i mean
S0262	awful
S0354	i my ears be still ring from the abuse that i have
S0262	oh no oh no
S0354	but we get him back sadly he he be oh he be a terror
S0262	oh but it be quite a nifty move to send him back though on a first plane i mean
S0354	yeah i think they have no choice really they just put him on the plane and
S0262	right okay yeah
S0354	off he go and i think he be so shock i don't think there be any problem on the flight because i think he be just so horrify
S0262	mm what have happen yeah
S0354	that he'd push the boat out too far
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0354	you know erm that he be fairly docile for a week or two after that
S0262	yeah sort of bite stun specially he's lose out on a really nice holiday yeah a ski holiday yeah
S0354	yeah exactly
S0262	yeah
S0354	yeah it's interest well i mean the you remember so many tales once you start talk about the tales
S0262	yes yeah
S0354	there's so many
S0262	yeah
S0354	so many tales to tell really it be
S0262	so have any of the kid who come through your school end up do something quite amaze or you know do anything maybe not perhaps not amaze
S0354	well er not no only one or two i mean one or two do i mean one or two do absolutely remarkably well i can't i can't think of anybody that erm actually make a name for themselves you know in any particular sphere we have we have one boy that that be do physics that erm get a cambridge scholarship and

S0262	what a compliment
S0354	which be quite yeah quite a feather in our cap you know
S0262	yeah i'd say
S0354	because it be a comprehensive school it be not a grammar school it never have be a grammar school it have be a secondary school that become
S0262	mm
S0354	comprehensive school erm and actually have the er it sound awful to say the add burden of because it be erm church of england school associate with abbey it be always consider to be the care school

S0262	yeah
S0354	i move on
S0262	yeah well it's a very consume career isn't it to have
S0354	totally
S0262	yeah it really be
S0354	drain you don't realise
S0262	yeah
S0354	how much of yourself
S0262	you put into it mm mm
S0354	you actually give
S0262	mm mm mm i think it's interest as well how if at the university level students university students be allow to directly contact their course convenor
S0354	mm
S0262	by email
S0354	mm
S0262	and they're allow to complain if they're not learn at the rate that they think that they need to be learn at or if such and such or or you wouldn't believe some of the things that they think thay they have as valid claim to complain about
S0354	yeah
S0262	and all of these email have to be address within forty eight hours so you have research academics who be teach as well
S0354	yes yeah
S0262	but erm quite a lot of their time be spend just trawl through students' email
S0354	email i mean i don't know how they cope
S0262	neither do i
S0354	er and i would've find i actually would've find that very difficult because i think to be personally challenge on your email you know more or less say you know if a student be say in an email erm to er a personal tutor i be not learn as fast as i should it's er a complaint about the quality of your teach or it could be construe as that
S0262	it could be
S0354	and
S0262	yeah
S0354	it
S0354	for me
S0262	yeah
S0354	i would always read it as that i would always read it as a direct complaint
S0262	yeah
S0354	i would've be a nervous wreck because
S0262	yeah
S0354	to to feel that i be my professional expertise be constantly
S0262	mm
S0354	be challenge
S0262	mm mm
S0354	i mean i because it would always have be my fault for me
S0262	yes yes
S0354	you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	come come back to what we be say earlier about this this awful catholic scruple bite
S0262	yeah
S0354	mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa
S0262	yeah
S0354	you know and i'm
S0262	yeah
S0354	dreadful it be always my fault
S0262	yeah
S0354	even when it isn't my fault
S0262	i know that's the thing isn't it
S0354	you know and i would've
S0262	yeah it's just be drum into you
S0354	i would've find that really difficult
S0262	yeah
S0354	very difficult
S0262	i think also what the the students have the university students have cotton on to be they can use the technologies against their lecturers
S0354	yeah
S0262	so if a lecturer doesn't give an amaze powerpoint presentation
S0354	yes
S0262	or have youtube videos come out of his ears or something that's
S0354	mm
S0262	mean to be a bite of a jazzy up kind of lecture
S0354	sure
S0262	they erm they then compare and contrast obviously they have
S0354	mm
S0262	different lecturers and then they can start use the technologies to say oh you didn't give us enough of this or you didn't put this up on the learn management system quickly enough or i couldn't find it or you didn't make an announcement or so they be challenge then
S0354	yes
S0262	on nearly every single bite of their
S0354	yes
S0262	in term of teach power and i also think the university students have erm start to talk amongst themselves through use forums
S0354	mm mm
S0262	we always find out who the best lecture be i mean it's like you know i mean
S0354	oh of course
S0262	but they're able to within the start of semester the first week they're able to tell students don't bother go to that lecturer because a such and such and such just look at everything on the learn management system they have videoed the lecture so you just can skim through them you can fast forward them like a film
S0354	mm mm
S0262	erm and then they complain about come up to the exam time that they haven't learn anything
S0262	and then like the poor lecturers or er course convenors be get sixty seventy eighty email a day if they're teach a big company
S0354	yes
S0262	you know it's it's overwhelm and i i just
S0354	oh yes it's ridiculous
S0262	can't see how you're mean to be productive in that situation
S0354	yeah i mean i i can't i can't even visualise it
S0262	even as a researcher or as a teacher
S0354	no
S0262	i don't know how you're mean to do both
S0354	no
S0262	you know
S0354	i can't even visualise what that would be like i i there's no way i could or would work under those condition
S0262	no
S0354	because
S0262	but but people want to work in universities they wanna be on it
S0354	you see well i course i never do
S0262	yeah
S0354	i mean i and i be lucky i be i have to say from that point of view i be bear at the right time
S0262	mm
S0354	erm i start as a secondary modern school teacher er in a school in the heart of that have be cream off for the real cr√®me de la cr√®me grammar school cream off the local county high
S0262	mm
S0354	and we have what be leave they could go to the tech
S0262	mm mm
S0354	and we have a two stream entry school of kid that hadn't make it at eleven but my goodness some of these kid really make it later on they be slow developers and as long as you be there to make them want to learn and
S0262	mm
S0354	to say come on you can do it
S0262	mm
S0354	never mind about those that have go on to
S0262	yeah
S0354	grammar school
S0262	yeah
S0354	you know it doesn't matter you've get the opportunity and we be say as we say before about who really do well we have one girl that come into the school in the b stream of an a b class
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	erm but be just a slow developer
S0262	mm
S0354	probably have a bad day on scholarship day you know
S0262	mm uhu
S0354	and erm but it didn't put her off she work really hard and when i join the school she just reach the erm fourth year in the secondary school and they just bring in raise of the school leave age they could stay on to sixteen erm and do cse be
S0262	mm mm
S0354	before gcse
S0262	cse i i remember now yeah
S0354	cse
S0262	cse yeah
S0354	erm and that year i have five stay voluntarily stay on
S0262	wow
S0354	to school
S0262	yeah
S0354	and four boys er and i i be give five forty minute periods on the timetable
S0262	right
S0354	and i with these five kid two want to do physics two want to do chemistry and want to do biology
S0262	oh god
S0354	and there be a common paper
S0262	yeah
S0354	so i do i erm i do a double chemistry with the others work at the back on pre prepare sheet double physics the it have to be mainly practical
S0262	yeah of course
S0354	with the others work at the back on work sheet
S0262	yeah
S0354	have her lesson
S0262	right
S0354	in the lunchtime and the single lesson
S0262	oh oh oh wow
S0354	be the common core paper
S0262	right
S0354	for everybody
S0262	yeah
S0354	erm we have one year to do it and they all do really really well
S0262	wow
S0354	all the boys go on to do erm what be then g star and ultimately onc and hnd so they all end up with good qualifications
S0262	mm mm uhu
S0354	transfer to the tech do a level in two years go straight to leicester university and do a pharmacology degree in three years
S0262	wonderful fantastic yeah and she'd've never be able to do that without that biology exam
S0354	no no no
S0262	yeah cse
S0354	they be the and they i mean they could do
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0354	really well but that go back to what i start to say that be my sort of teach
S0262	mm
S0354	i
S0262	mm
S0354	love it
S0262	mm
S0354	i make kid want to learn
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	for me be more important than what i actually teach them
S0262	yes yeah
S0354	and and i be happy even when we go comprehensive always i give the sort of the top chemistry class cos i felt i have to because that be my degree
S0262	mm
S0354	but i always when i be timetabling timetabled myself to do the the lowest set general science always
S0262	right yeah yeah
S0354	erm and do all sort with them and love it you know
S0262	yeah that's very good i i should imagine that that win the respect of your team to er to actually do that too
S0354	i think so
S0262	yes
S0354	i think that's management i think
S0262	mm
S0354	that's that's part management skill to do that
S0262	mm mm
S0354	you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	give the people the the subject that they be best at and wherever possible remove the areas where they would most feel threaten
S0262	yeah
S0354	and felt they weren't do as good a job as they could
S0262	yeah
S0354	and this be why i be absolutely appal at the what you tell me about the way university teach be go cos i i just
S0262	mm mm mm
S0354	i mean in my university days we be so in awe of our tutor
S0262	yes well i know you wouldn't say boo to a goose would you
S0262	i wouldn't even know how to talk to them
S0354	so clever you know
S0262	i wouldn't even know how to talk to them i wouldn't know what to say
S0354	no
S0262	you know
S0354	and that
S0262	but but these lot you know they be awful i mean i've go and observe i've observe lecture this be when because er
S0354	mm
S0262	the academics ask me to
S0354	mm
S0262	this wasn't part of my job remit but they didn't have schedule observations
S0354	mm
S0262	they felt they weren't actually make any progress in their teach because they didn't
S0354	mm
S0262	have any direct observation so they ask me would you come in and see one of my seminars would you come see one of my lecture would you see me do this do that whatever
S0262	i say sure i'll do that and informally i'd give them you know my feedback but i mean more importantly i be look at what the kid be do and i be shock
S0354	mm
S0262	they're not there to learn seemingly cos of course always there will be some but they their idea of a lecture be to sit there with anything open you know an ipad a a laptop or anything but multitask
S0354	no
S0262	they they really believe that that sit there and and look at facebook and be on a forum and do this and do that and somehow what the lecturers say be gonna get in
S0262	and that they're go to know when to ask a question
S0354	yeah
S0262	i didn't see any question ask at all
S0262	and i know that lecture be some some lecturers do ask people to ask question some don't i always encourage it
S0354	mm mm mm
S0262	erm but even in the seminars or the tutorials kid wouldn't say boo to a goose not because they're too frighten i think it's mainly because they hadn't actually yet engage their brain
S0354	no no exactly
S0262	they didn't know what to ask they didn't know what they didn't know
S0354	no
S0354	and they be they be
S0262	you know
S0354	that's the problem they be not constantly challenge themselves be they
S0262	no no
S0354	they're not i think that
S0262	spoon feed spoon feed
S0354	oh
S0262	oh my gosh
S0354	thick i know
S0262	i work as a learn advisor and i be there erm at this university in erm just outside and erm they tell me oh look we do the social inclusion agenda so you're go to be see a lot more people come through
S0354	mm mm
S0262	who probably shouldn't be at university but we're let them in anyway
S0354	sure
S0262	i say okay so er well it's sort of true we do see domestic students come through who perhaps shouldn't've get in just yet
S0354	mm
S0262	but anyway erm that's where i come in handy because i would work with the lecturers and say you can see what's miss tell me what you see that's miss i'll try and plug some of the hole on my end of things
S0354	mm mm
S0262	and we'll see if we can come up with a programme that develop people's academic skills
S0354	mm
S0262	really quickly
S0354	yes
S0262	so they don't lose too much of their learn or the content
S0354	sure
S0262	or the time i should say
S0354	mm
S0262	and so we work together like in that way and er we start this idea of embed academic literacy into the course
S0354	mm
S0262	but that's when i realise that though the teachers want an an early an easy life they want to know how to teach they be too frighten to teach some of the bits that be quite tricky
S0354	yeah
S0262	like write academic write even though it's in their discipline
S0354	yes
S0262	they didn't want to convey it they didn't want to actually step in and say everyone okay this be discourse this be this this be that this be read this be right we're all novices together come on let's try and see if we can sort out what it be that we need to do so they leave it to people like myself but i wouldn't have all the discipline knowledge
S0354	no no
S0262	you know even the content but
S0354	yeah
S0262	i wouldn't know how this discourse be put together or
S0354	mm
S0262	i wouldn't have a clue so i'd have to learn their unit really quickly and then teach it on that's not as effective as the
S0354	no
S0262	actual lecturer
S0354	no
S0262	and and we saw the report come through because you know they always do those survey at the end of the
S0354	sure
S0262	that's another thing that they over survey these students nowadays but erm of course the head of department would see what your teach rank be and it be only out of five it be only a scale of five it's not lot
S0262	so if you be get sort of one point two two point five whatever your erm you know the head of department would want to know why but erm when we look at it together we saw that it it be the lecturers who would teach some of the write that be get consistently high score on their
S0354	yeah
S0262	teach
S0354	mm
S0262	who be engage
S0354	engage the yes
S0262	themself
S0354	yes
S0262	and i say even if you're the learner with
S0354	yes
S0262	me we'll work it out together we'll be co learners
S0354	yes
S0262	we'll work out some way to actually do it quickly in the lecture or seminar and then least you're go to give them something and your essay that be come through that you have to mark load of you'll be get something back
S0354	sure
S0262	you know and then and then they start to see it but i think a lot of academics say seem to be say it and i can understand why they say well when i get into university i have to pass every single exam and i have to pass it with fly colour
S0354	mm
S0262	why be it that it's not the same
S0354	mm
S0262	nowadays
S0354	sure
S0262	why do these
S0354	mm
S0262	kid come to university if they're not academically prepare or academically mind
S0354	mm and and sometimes they're not academically prepare
S0262	you know
S0354	and it's er it's because so many of the of the institute of higher education shall we say for you know because they're not a lot of these colleges be not universities in the sense that we understand university
S0262	mm mm
S0354	universities in my day be for highly motivate academic people
S0262	mm
S0354	that have show they have a a lust for learn
S0262	yes
S0354	and a lust for knowledge
S0262	a lust that's a lovely way to explain it yeah lust for learn that's a yeah
S0354	isn't it
S0262	yeah it be yeah yeah
S0354	and and they they it's a mean to an end now
S0262	mm
S0354	er that and i think that's there's be a whole sea change in how people view higher education
S0262	mm
S0354	a lot of people go into higher education now er be look at it more in the light that in our day would've be further education with a view to get a job
S0262	yes
S0354	and people that go into higher education be not necessarily motivate by the job at the end of the line
S0262	yes
S0354	they be motivate only by the learn
S0262	yes that's right yeah the scholarly learn
S0354	scholarly learn
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0354	that be enough that be enough in itself
S0262	mm
S0354	it but they it it isn't look at like that and partly i i i think partly maybe school be to blame there in a way although in principle i have always believe in comprehensive education i come ultimately to the conclusion work in the comprehensive state system that it be far more difficult to operate effectively than it be ever conceive to be when it be first
S0262	yeah
S0354	er you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	erm conceive i i think in principle it's right in principle every child should have a should have an equal opportunity
S0262	mm mm
S0354	to gain the education that they be capable of
S0262	mm
S0354	but they they we be not all you know capable of the same
S0262	they're true word true word that they be capable of yeah yes reach that potential at least but not push them into something that they're never
S0354	or even suggest
S0262	yeah
S0354	that they have the right
S0262	the right yes
S0354	automatically
S0262	that's the problem
S0354	to take an education that they be intellectually
S0262	it's about right these days yes yeah
S0354	not either capable of or suit for
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	and that's the problem we we don't all thrive on the same diet
S0262	no
S0354	and that's the same intellectually as well
S0262	that's true as well that's so true yeah
S0354	you know and i think that's the pity
S0262	yeah
S0354	everybody now be feed with the idea they have the right whatever
S0262	mm mm
S0354	but they don't have the right if they haven't work for it er and they shouldn't they they shouldn't feel they need the right if they're not intellectually capable of it
S0262	mm
S0354	they should be quite happy and satisfy that they have other options open and it's the state's responsibility to
S0262	yeah
S0354	provide those other options
S0262	yeah
S0354	which be viable options er and worthwhile options erm and financially satisfy options
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	it should not er our higher education should not be the be all and end all
S0262	no
S0354	and that's where we go wrong with grammar school and secondary school not in what they be provide intellectually but by suggest
S0262	mm
S0354	that one be better
S0262	mm
S0354	than the other
S0262	mm
S0354	and therefore more desirable than the other
S0262	mm mm mm
S0354	erm when actually the other option might've be far more suitable
S0262	exactly yeah exactly
S0354	you know
S0262	far more suitable yeah
S0354	and this be why
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	this be why it be not that easy in comprehensive school to when you you've get a set group of teachers be require to provide top academic stimulation to kid that be possibly intellectually superior to them
S0262	yeah
S0354	and we all have to face the fact
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	we could be teach kid with iqs much higher than our own
S0262	yeah yes yes that's true that's a scary prospect yes
S0354	and at the same time encourage and motivate
S0262	yeah yeah
S0354	children who maybe have english as a second language
S0262	that's right
S0354	and be dyslexic er have all sort of learn problems
S0262	all sort of learn difficulties yeah mm mm mm yeah the whole gambit
S0354	and have no parental background
S0262	mm
S0354	support er and be just plainly not interest
S0262	mm mm
S0354	how do erm and when comprehensive school be first start this be an enormous problem because you find that when you once put all the kid together and start to suggest that you should teach mix ability class
S0262	yeah
S0354	your grammar school teachers have nervous breakdowns
S0262	mm of course
S0354	your secondary modern school teachers
S0262	yes
S0354	be stress because they have to go back to their textbooks
S0262	mm mm
S0354	but
S0262	mm
S0354	they cop with the discipline
S0262	mm
S0354	a lot better
S0262	oh i bet the classroom management yeah yeah
S0354	because they if they have survive in a secondary modern school they may have survive on maybe a minimal amount of intellectual background and knowledge
S0262	mm mm
S0354	but they have survive on enthusiasm and charisma
S0262	mm mm and passion for their subject yeah
S0354	and passion for their subject and the kid
S0262	yes yes absolutely
S0354	whereas
S0262	yeah
S0354	the grammar school teacher be the academic who be the differences that i've always think if anybody say to me what do you teach i would say kid
S0262	yeah they're a thing yes
S0354	whereas any of my grammar school teachers would've say biology or chemistry
S0354	or english
S0262	that's a good one yeah
S0354	you know
S0262	yeah
S0354	but doesn't it give you difference
S0262	yeah it do it do
S0354	the different attitude
S0262	it do
S0354	and what an and really i think almost get to the crunch
S0262	mm
S0354	of the problems
S0262	mm
S0354	today that we're face in education
S0262	true that's very true
S0354	and it's tragic what you tell me about universities because i haven't step inside a university erm for yonks erm because who's teach year four say and it's towards the upper limit of her age range cos she be early years train
S0262	mm
S0354	say it's so demand i mean she's get a good a two one in politics and economics
S0262	mm mm mm mm
S0354	from essex with anthony king so
S0262	mm
S0354	it's not a second rate
S0262	no no it's a good university degree
S0354	yeah and a good degree erm and erm a pgce from
S0262	yeah
S0354	and still say gosh i have to work at the work these kid be push me to
S0262	mm
S0354	and she say and it's fabulous mum i she's work round the clock she say but it's fabulous because the feedback i get from them
S0262	mm
S0354	now
S0262	it's lovely
S0354	if eight year olds
S0262	yeah eight year olds what a lovely age to yeah
S0354	can give her that sort of feedback
S0262	yes yeah mm
S0354	what be happen where you know
S0262	i know the disconnect between that yeah yeah yes and then you get get them later down the track and they're you know email in the middle of the night complain
S0354	the disconnect yeah and i mean yeah yeah i mean take a class down there on have them all out on the field wonderful and at the end he get two class together and at the end he sit them all down and he say
S0262	yeah
S0354	any question he could've be there now
S0262	yes
S0354	there be
S0262	yeah
S0354	there be sixty kid there
S0262	yeah
S0354	and they'd do a project they both class have do a project on water they'd be down to the beach they you know
S0262	mm
S0354	they'd do all sort of tide and water cycle and
S0262	wonderful
S0354	and they be they be the same they be i think they be year eights er year er sorry year four so they'd be eight er and erm it the the question they ask be amaze
S0262	mm
S0354	absolutely amaze
S0262	mm mm
S0354	they have listen
S0262	wonderful
S0354	they'd take it on board enthusiastically they'd think about it and they'd get a question
S0262	mm yeah wonderful process yeah
S0354	and and
S0262	yeah
S0354	that's i mean it's tragic to think that they these kid might god forbid get to eighteen
S0262	yeah lose it
S0354	and the best they can do be operate an ipad or an xbox and and complain about their tutor
S0262	yes yeah yeah yeah i agree
S0354	it's tragic
S0262	i agree but they also the system shouldn't be allow that i don't know whoever say why don't we have all of these these students be able to email their lecturers or course convenors directly i mean
S0354	it's wrong
S0262	but it be actually a part of the fabric now of university life
S0354	yeah
S0262	because it really isn't just one it's not one institution or you know a pocket
S0354	mm
S0262	everywhere i go i say to students or to staff i say at you know lecture staff i say do you receive email or do be you allow to email oh yeah you know it's like put a light switch on at a lecture theatre it's just something that's there
S0354	i just find that unbelievable
S0262	they think it's something to do with customer satisfaction i think the the senior management
S0354	it's such a commercialise
S0262	it's the commercialise response isn't it
S0354	the commercialise education
S0262	yeah
S0354	which i of course i've always disapprove of i could never see how a former manager of tesco's would make a good head teacher
S0262	mm
S0354	you know
S0262	and at the top now these universities they always use to be accountants but they're now all marketeers
S0354	yeah absolutely
S0262	and they're social media marketeers at that
S0354	absolutely
S0262	so they're all advertise
S0354	you see i i don't get this i can understand how a university have to have a a market department because it be a commercial world and they have
S0262	mm mm
S0354	to be self support to a certain extent that
S0262	yeah
S0354	the the grant and everything be not what they be and and to provide a good education for the kid they have to have the money to do it
S0262	yeah
S0354	er you know erm and i always applaud warwick for that i be very impress with warwick university for that
S0262	mm that be my brother's university
S0354	really
S0262	yeah
S0354	and
S0262	yeah
S0354	they have well they have i mean when i visit them with sixth formers
S0262	mm mm
S0354	have a great system there i think
S0262	mm
S0354	i be very impress
S0262	mm mm mm mm
S0354	erm but that should be quite separate from the academic run of the academic institution
S0262	that's right that's right and the academics themselves be very wary because they don't when they look at the front page of the website for the university and then they they read all the market ploys that be come through and they see the students the customers you know they themselves feel alienate from the own
S0354	mm
S0262	their own institution a lot of them have strive very hard to work for this particular university
S0354	mm
S0262	believe that it academically
S0354	mm mm
S0262	you know and then the teach be wonderful but then somehow the market be kind of become a bite cancerous because
S0354	yes
S0262	people's expectations
S0354	i know
S0262	be very often erm mislead i suppose
S0354	yes
S0262	you know er particularly the international students
S0354	yes
S0262	they have lot of picture of people like from vietnam and africa and various other
S0354	yeah yeah
S0262	and then they say oh yes we'll have people small people a small erm classrooms and they'll
S0354	yes
S0262	help you with certain things
S0354	yes
S0262	never do
S0354	but it's not there
S0354	the support's not there
S0262	no no
S0354	and this be the i mean this be the problem they can have a language problem er
S0262	mm
S0354	and and they want the international students cos that's where the money be
S0262	yeah yeah load of money yeah
S0354	you you see big buck
S0262	yeah
S0354	but they be not prepare to spend those buck
S0262	no
S0354	on give kid the support they need
S0262	yes
S0354	and that will pull down the standards
S0262	yeah
S0354	and it undermine the the er the universities' status because people will say oh well they they take them from all over the world there and what what do they get in the end of it well it's it's not worth
S0262	mm
S0354	it's not worth the paper it's write on
S0262	mm mm mm
S0354	and people will be like that about it
S0262	mm
S0354	they they you know
S0262	well this be why they want some success stories both from the academics and from the graduate because
S0354	yeah
S0262	then that's the reputation game that they can play very successfully
S0354	yeah
S0262	because they can say we have graduate who erm from their you know first salaries will get er use to do this for their erm actuarial study
S0354	yeah yes
S0262	erm they have a statistic that would
S0354	yeah
S0262	be blazingly you know put up on the well front web page say eighty percent of our actuarial graduate but then they take out actuarial and just put graduate
S0354	ah yes
S0262	have a receive a start salary of eighty thousand dollars a year
S0354	yeah
S0262	which be pretty good for australia so
S0354	oh yes
S0262	so erm so that be that and then they have these other things that you know oh of course i mean that's fine academics obviously do have you know their own reputations to uphold erm but now they've get them do youtube videos and now they've get them you know do all sort of things that perhaps the academics themselves be not all that comfortable with
S0354	yes of course
S0262	you know not necessarily you want to sit in front of a camera
S0354	no
S0262	and talk about how great you be i mean some do
S0354	no yes
S0262	but some don't i mean
S0354	no i
S0262	but they also don't want their face
S0354	no
S0262	and it's it's quite interest because er no i'm not so sure but i read an article about this that they somehow some of the management people be at the universities be begin to sex up the academics so they're look for the people not necessarily who look sexy
S0354	yeah
S0262	but have some sort of charisma
S0354	mm
S0262	have some sort of appeal
S0354	yeah mm mm
S0262	not necessarily sex appeal i don't think we'd go very far but
S0354	no no no but but but it's part of it
S0262	but there's something about it and they're put them up on the front web page
S0354	yes yes oh yes
S0262	and they're say look everyone you know
S0354	yes
S0262	this be what you could have access to if you be to come here
S0354	i know i know and this
S0262	you know
S0354	be wrong i i i mean i think it's totally wrong but i'm afraid again it's the way the world be go
S0262	mm
S0354	er and it's a
S0262	mm sex up yeah
S0354	i mean we we've do it
S0262	yeah
S0354	in in a er a lesser to a lesser degree for years i mean perfect example of the this be a terrible thing to say really but the person that take my job
