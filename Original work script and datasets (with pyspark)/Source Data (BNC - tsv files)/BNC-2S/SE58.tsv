S0327	which be together with talent which be very important
S0326	yeah so when i write the essay i really just it take me sort of three and a half days of solid work
S0327	yes
S0326	and then i go come to for a few days
S0327	okay
S0326	for the weekend
S0327	and what be the subject now
S0326	erm now i'm mainly do er greek and latin literature and philosophy and art history
S0327	gosh so it's gonna be quite demand isn't it art history from what period
S0326	erm it's from from archaic greek to late antiquity so it's sort of eight hundred bc to six hundred ad
S0327	so er at some point you'll cross over with a little bite won't you
S0326	yeah she always say that she be do a lot of roman britain art
S0327	i mean i do she send me her essay to read sometimes to read through for you know typos and so on and i mean it's so academic what she's do
S0326	yeah
S0327	i do really admire her i mean i actually think your subject be more interest in a way
S0326	well she's do erm archaeology it's it's gonna be a bite like that
S0327	but she doesn't seem to mind i haven't mention that i find it find it a bite bore it's heavy
S0327	i mean so be yours so be your subject erm so it's of course it's ancient greek philosophy and everything
S0326	yeah i mean what i like about the erm work i've do this year i'm just i try basically hard to just have my own ideas i don't do too much secondary read i just look at the text
S0327	that's that's very demand that's er that's interest cos tell me that she er be tell that they're look for er you know originality and i think how do you do that with archaeology you know it's almost impossible to have an original view
S0326	yeah
S0327	on subject that have be beat to death
S0326	although although it's it's surprisingly people there's a famous example or famous in term of archaeology where they have these coin sort of persian coin and no one could understand what be show on the coin they come up with all these different ideas and then a student at university girl at university it's quite obvious that this be a map of persia and no one have notice
S0327	good lord be that right well of course one forget that even the cleverest people be mostly silly as well
S0326	yeah yeah

S0326	yeah he yeah he's nice i i don't know him that well but he seem nice
S0327	he's a painter
S0326	yeah he's an artist
S0327	what kind of
S0326	what kind of
S0327	mm
S0326	erm you'd have to you'd have to have a look erm come round and saw some of his paint on the wall he like them erm it's sort of abstract paint
S0327	and why do he not sort of show or anything
S0326	i don't know i don't know what he seem to i don't know what they erm he do with his time really if he's like if he's work towards a show or
S0327	anyhow your mum's happy
S0326	yeah
S0327	that's the main thing and he's a proper age not a child
S0327	oh well that's all excellent
S0326	child
S0327	well don't forget from where i stand er anybody under fifty's a child and as i have yet to meet meet a grow up man in my life erm
S0327	i'm certainly i have yet to meet a grow up artist
S0327	yeah there be a big meet at the yesterday which be a general assembly and i actually didn't sit it out cos i can't sit there for sort of six hours or you know but i know that you know erm be go to bring up the fact that he's very upset that the accept money from the tobacco company which be true we get apparently four four and a half million from them and i you know i i leave message to be read out at the meet after i leave whether or not they be but bite sarcastic i say first of all you know will you thank for draw our attention to the fact that smoking's not good for you erm
S0327	and secondly erm if we turn down the money from tobacco company then surely we should turn down all money because where be clean money what be it what be clean money and can he suggest some because if he can suggest some i'd like some myself
S0327	erm and that most money that any of us touch er certainly through the bank come through armaments one way or the other cos it's the biggest world trade we have isn't it
S0326	mm
S0327	i think so i haven't hear any he doesn't get up till late so i hope he's not too cross with me
S0327	just think it be a silly thing to do
S0326	should get try and get some free fag out of them
S0327	now that hadn't occur to me i don't know how you do that
S0326	be like
S0327	write to them and say look i've be defend you i mean i'm not defend i'm not defend smoke
S0326	you could be their you could be their erm sort of lobbyist in there
S0327	i'm not go that far i mean i you know you do have to be an idiot to smoke it's not a good thing on the other hand and you know you can get lung cancer but all drug have side effect and because smoking's so dangerous the side effect be good i hope you don't smoke
S0326	not properly
S0327	no try not to because you it's very easy to get addict like me quite apart from anything else the cost be horrendous
S0326	yeah i smoke roll up
S0327	but you know they're go they're go to erm give their four and a half million to somebody else if they don't give it to the
S0326	what be they give it for what do they get back
S0327	acknowledgement
S0326	so you put it in er
S0327	they put it in like you know erm advertise exhibitions and things like that i mean the 's a big establishment now i mean actually i'm organise an exhibition for them which might interest you a bite erm not until the new build be build which'll be maybe not for three or four years so who know maybe i won't be alive in three or four years or with a zimmer frame or whatever so i'm try to get it organise now but i'm pick out great work er that be to say great draw from the great artists from the past and connect them to contemporary stuff that's be now be do now
S0326	er just any sort of contemporary art or just draw
S0327	erm no anything erm but i'm also base it in erm ideas of geometry and proportion erm and measurement dimension so i'm try to make these connections between the past and the and the present so it connect a little bite to you know to to what you're do
S0326	yeah
S0327	cos all those initial ideas of proportion come from the greeks didn't they
S0326	yeah and plato have above his school mm don't come in unless you know the geometry
S0327	yeah but he must have be a very er disagreeable person to work with if you if you be an artist of any sort
S0327	he be so against art or have we misinterpret that
S0326	no he be more or less more or less against it he just er he think cos he can't free it from er it's always gonna be sort of er i mean the two problems he have with it be sort of the sort of unreliability of sort of phenomenal world or what you can see with your eye so that's anything you can see with your eye only have a limit amount of value anyway erm and then he think if he can't really separate it from it have a didactic purpose so if you have all these myths about gods castrate their father he be they shouldn't tell that to children but that's i don't i suppose he would he would be he if if he believe that erm through art you could get closer to understand other form then he could see a a purpose for it which be more or less what i think artists be try to do in some way point towards something that you can't express
S0327	well what i'm try to look at i mean i'm only really so that i can find out myself i'm not it's not academic in the sense that i know something i'm try to teach it's that i'm basically i'm try to understand what i've be do for the last fifty years erm but what i don't understand about the little bite i know about what he say be why he doesn't understand that that be a fundamental it be a creativity be a fundamental part of human nature whatever form it take i'm just read this book actually which i won't lend you because i keep refer to it's really really interest call the art instinct
S0326	mm
S0327	erm he you know he put up er put a very good argument up for the fact that it be more to do with the heart than the head
S0326	yeah
S0327	which be what i certainly believe and that it be inbuilt
S0326	it's very it's interest when erm when people look at the differences between homo sapien and neanderthal societies the only real difference be that neanderthals didn't erm have a sort of culture of figurative art or symbolic think they didn't do any like cave paint
S0327	do they not
S0326	no and so and people just can't can't work out why er that should make a difference but it seem to have make some sort of difference to survival
S0327	but but cave paint start i mean we we know of cave paint at least thirty thousand years ago so who be they
S0326	yeah but there there be erm that's they er they exist together at the same time
S0327	i think i read about that somewhere so these two kinds of human species
S0326	yeah er protohuman species
S0327	they don't really know do they i mean er
S0326	yeah
S0327	they don't know how we appear i mean from everything i've read it's just almost as though we appear ready make and i know quite how that fit in with darwinian
S0326	yeah well especially when you think about a hundred thousand years ago it's not that long
S0327	it's not that long it's amaze
S0326	yeah everything that's happen in the last two thousand five hundred years
S0327	yeah but you see if you look at some of those cave paint and i've be to lascaux the sophistication be so great the intuitive sophistication they have that one have to think that they weren't really all that different that the only thing that's change be technology and our learn but the actual way they be constitute as human be wasn't that different
S0326	and so he's and this book be about the sort of natural drive
S0327	it's about the natural drive
S0327	and erm i actually read it before but my memory now my memory be just unbelievably bad which be useful it mean i can read book again and erm you know it go into you know the mean of aesthetic value and aesthetic problems and erm forgery erm use of fiction i see i've mark a few things natural selection i mean basically what he's argue be a kind of natural selection in art as well erm i mean i can only read it rather slowly and carefully but you might you might just find it interest but i mean who who be those human be who first measure a pillar
S0326	yes i mean there's this there's a good erm do you know that woman camille paglia
S0327	yes yes i remember her
S0326	she like yeah she write a lot of like nonsense some of the time but there's a she have a book call sexual personae a sort of art history book go from ancient egypt to emily dickinson and the first chapter be it's really good about sort of think about where art come from and why people make art erm it's sort of like a reaction to a sort of primal anxiety about nature and what they can't know in the dark and so she have ideas about why people have pillars and pyramid and a straight line a straight line be erm sort of a symbol of man's try to er emancipate himself from from nature erm and yeah she look at like er she compare egyptian free stand statues to their do you know the venus of willendorf sculpture that sort of bulbous yeah
S0327	yes yes i know yeah
S0326	and sort of the this be erm sort of chthonic primal art and then the birth of the western eye be what you see when er in in egyptian culture
S0327	i do remember read some stuff of hers which be simply over the top
S0326	yeah she i mean she go on she's
S0326	she'll er she'll like go on and on say a lot of things that without stop to like
S0327	yes
S0326	about without an argument
S0327	adore her work when it first come out i actually couldn't cope with it erm it's too much like a rant to me
S0326	mm
S0327	erm i mean what i'm in fact i might
S0326	well the it's just the the first chapter be good er the first three chapters of that book be be be interest at least
S0327	yes er well what i'm try to do in this exhibition erm i might even let give you the draft of the mm the introduction would you be able to do that for me
S0326	mm
S0327	at some point it's not long it's a couple of thousand word er well it's partly i mean this none of this be original but you know be to be to talk about all the dimension come from the body that even even the most abstract artist it have to come from us because this be the only tool we have really
S0326	yeah
S0327	to measure things and you you see it very clearly in art
S0326	oh right
S0327	erm
S0326	i do actually write an essay last time about erm the naked male body in art and i spend most of it try to work out why people be er fixate by use the naked male body in greece and but people do say about columns sort of doric columns and er ionic columns and like the sort of vitruvian theory about male doric columns and and base on the male body er
S0327	those be all good theories i mean well i don't suppose we'll ever know erm but it seem to me perfectly obvious that that this be the way any creature relate the relate to the world you know if you're an ant presumably you have a very different understand of the world of the size and the scale erm assume they have brain and things like that which i dare say they don't erm you know and if we be if we be giants we would see it all scale be incredibly important i don't mean size
S0326	yeah
S0327	i actually mean scale which be the relationship of large and small erm jacquetta hawk i seem to remember in a book one of those first book that come out in the fifties or sixties don't eat too much cos i've get a big pudding for you
S0326	okay
S0327	erm
S0326	it's nice the salad though
S0327	it's delicious isn't it i eat this every day and i er i i think it's very very good to eat it's just pickle vegetables i just shove in whatever i erm whatever i can get hold of er image i seem to remember of sheaves of corn so when you've get the corn tie together and then it spring out at the top and the that be originally how the dwell be be erm construct and so it be just their theory i seem to remember i can't remember it's a very famous book that i remember give to my father for christmas erm fifties er in the fifties i would've think erm what be it call jacquetta hawk and
S0326	not a novel
S0327	no no no it's an a book on archaeology erm and so er you know they make the same things except in stone and so they gradually they gradually emerge but i suppose they will and of course the egyptians do come first didn't they
S0326	yeah what be very strange about only about the egyptian sort of visual culture that it doesn't change really once it's there it stay the same for three thousand years
S0327	that be interest isn't it
S0326	when you look at greek visual culture within two hundred years it's totally transform
S0327	yeah well it's the same er thing with islamic art actually you know that they won't allow that to change erm i notice when i be in morocco that you know it's well it's really be downhill all the way since about eleventh or twelfth century i remember in in marrakesh there's a a wonderful build i can't remember what it's call now erm all that's leave be just stone one portion and bite by bite you know the ottoman's come and that be lovely all that stuff
S0326	yeah
S0327	er and now they don't know er of course they haven't a clue what to do now now modernism have take over erm they're still not suppose to do anything figurative everything's hold back so those cultural comparisons be be terribly interest but i know that you know i think i'm not one that's always ask myself what be it one's try to do cos as an artist you never really honestly know because as i say
S0326	thank you
S0327	i don't believe the brain have much to do with it erm and so i think a lot of a lot quite a lot of art be always try to go back to to the origin where you know where it all come from it look a bite different because we're all creatures of circumstance and we can't escape our time now i've get but i too fussy
S0326	i haven't show this tattoo yet to my mum
S0327	oh what do you think she's go to say
S0326	she won't mind i just haven't haven't actually wear a t shirt that's why probably
S0327	have another look i need to find my glass where do you get it do
S0326	erm some place in
S0327	it's very pretty actually
S0326	it's cos erm
S0327	it's quite delicate
S0326	er we have erm and i be we have we make up in the summer play a lot of pool erm and we make a pool team call er autumn leaf i can't remember why so that's what it's
S0327	call what
S0326	autumn leaf

S0326	erm yeah i mean she email me the other week i write back
S0327	be she over over here
S0326	she's no she's in erm
S0327	she's in now
S0326	yeah at the at liberal sort of arts college
S0327	oh really
S0326	yeah
S0327	do what
S0326	liberal arts
S0327	what er what be liberal arts
S0326	liberal arts be an american humanities degree i tell her that she probably shouldn't go to that school erm in her email she say you you be right about my school it's kind of crap erm but i just write back say it doesn't matter what school you go to they're all kind of crap
S0327	they aren't you know be they all
S0326	well in to some er er some extent yeah they're not gonna
S0327	they weren't in my day
S0326	well i think they're all they're gonna be crap if you're er if
S0327	i'm mean you're not say be crap be you
S0326	no but it's not you know it's there's things about it that i'd rather that be er not perfect
S0327	like what
S0326	well like the the the the teach and er learn be not be not crap but the town be the the sort of the culture maybe of people there
S0327	the culture of what which people the teachers
S0326	for the the students
S0327	the students
S0326	yeah
S0327	oh well i mean there's nothing the the university can do about that
S0326	yeah i know yeah i know well er there be probably but you know there's
S0327	this be crème fraîche i think erm
S0326	but also i suppose er like if you we're and you've just spend a year be like a successful model then it'd be bore to go to school
S0327	but be a model be terribly bore
S0326	yeah but not she be quite like she wasn't it wasn't i don't think it be very bore for her cos she be work with all the best people and get to er you know they be photographers who be really artists and she didn't have to work that she be just do a few things for lot of money
S0327	lot of money but she have a brain it's a bite of a pity not to use it well maybe your standards be a little bite high or perhaps you're interest in a broader range of things than some of your peer group be do you think it's that
S0326	what be you talk about and i or
S0327	er no er
S0326	well maybe er i dunno i guess it's probably just like sort of the from the age of like fifteen er it be i like my life have be unusual compare to other people's my age
S0327	in what way because you've travel more
S0326	just because the because of grow up in in area in and have friends that be older
S0327	sorry it's a bite of ginger my god that's hot oh dear because of it be because of it be work class because of be racially mix
S0326	no because er no because erm cos of what that's go on there all sort of the interest thing's like er party that be erm the things to go to and the people to meet and then and then travel more
S0327	so do you do you think that most of them have more conventional background than you i suppose yes er you know your parent be not straightforward middle class work in a bank kind of parent erm be it partly class then
S0326	no
S0327	that you have a broader view of things
S0326	yeah probably i mean not like no one very few people go to school like i mean it's not most people who go to like sort of the people from they er tend to be from like
S0327	right and yet from what i understand about when you be there be that it be er er relatively old fashion value in term of discipline and so on
S0326	mm
S0327	cos i know when you know erm when i hear er complain about things well the discipline that he complain about be what be absolutely normal for my generation
S0326	yeah
S0327	you know and you walk down the corridor and you er in single file and there's no big deal and you just do that and
S0326	it's it's
S0327	and you weren't suppose to make a a noise in class and you weren't suppose to you didn't have mobiles to listen to in all those things
S0326	yeah no but
S0327	of course they can't teach now if if they're all if there's all that disruption
S0326	yeah but it be er it be a bite shit like if you forget your pencil and you have a teacher that didn't like you you'd get an you know you'd stay after school for an hour
S0327	right
S0326	that kind of thing that be a bite be what er annoy people i think
S0327	yeah so you well i mean as you know he's now a big deal he's a big cheese now
S0326	yeah
S0327	er and i've read people complain about him but i must say i rather admire him
S0326	yeah i think he be good
S0327	from you know from what i've hear he's er do he stand up for standards mm
S0326	he also put latin into
S0327	yep well i think you lot be incredibly lucky to go to at that period cos who be it be it either or or erm tell me that er you know it isn't so good anymore that now apparently there's some head teacher who's over the top disciplinarian
S0326	yeah that's erm er yeah i remember him he be here when i be there
S0327	be he
S0326	yeah i mean he be like he seem like a sort of sadist you know
S0327	oh really okay well you'll always get those you know wherever you be
S0326	i'm just gonna get some water would you like some
S0327	er no help yourself there's a glass a glass there
S0326	but whilst their their project er 's a bite more it's not not so coherent anymore because er because the school become a a famously a good school
S0327	yes
S0326	so people go er like wanna go there don't cause the same kind of problems as the kid that go there five years ago
S0327	oh really
S0326	well it's in the in the general gentrification like one of the reason why
S0327	yes of course
S0326	that whole area's be gentrified
S0327	yes
S0326	be cos there's good school there
S0327	that's right of course yep i know i mean i've hear this that in fact last time i saw your mum which be a very long time ago she be we go up for lunch up the road here and she say there be no restaurants like this anymore in she say that you have to sit down and have a menu now you know it be just a kebab place
S0326	mm
S0327	but a very nice one which be i find absolutely incredible it's happen so fast and all the house and
S0326	yeah all the erm turkish you have er sit down and have a menu and everything's like eleven pound
S0327	it's incredible
S0326	whereas er
S0327	you can get a perfectly good lunch for six pound
S0326	yeah i know i remember when we move there and we we eat in the turkish every night cos we didn't have a proper kitchen it be like you'd just sit down and er i think it be like four pound for
S0327	yes and all that's change gosh it happen fast i dunno where people live now i mean if they haven't get any money i think it's really really really difficult
S0326	they don't though they're i mean they're move more and more outside of
S0327	yes but
S0326	i don't particularly wanna live in after i like it seem too difficult and not worth it
S0327	i think it be difficult now for for
S0326	you can't live anywhere for er er that close for sort of less than six hundred pound a month
S0327	no i mean i'd miss
S0326	and like all all my friends who be thirty and er they none of them have their own place
S0327	oh
S0326	they all they're all live with their friends because they you you know no one can afford it
S0327	no the only way people can get somewhere to live be er be if their parent die and leave them somewhere to live and as your grandparents be still alive you can't really hold you breath for your parent to die just yet
S0326	yeah
S0327	how be your other granny by the way
S0326	as far as i know she's fine
S0327	er how old be she now
S0326	mm ninety five i think
S0327	that's pretty impressive well you may have a very long life ahead of you
S0326	yeah i wouldn't be i
S0327	even your dad be not that young anymore how old be your dad
S0326	sixty three
S0327	sixty three mm
S0326	yeah i wouldn't be surprise if live to be like a hundred and ten
S0327	er that's ask quite a lot
S0327	there be not very many people that make a hundred and ten
S0326	i know but it's just seem like she seem you know a machine
S0327	she be
S0327	although as my dear friend say the other day when i say something about die he say oh we'll have to shoot you
S0327	and your dad live still mostly in america

S0327	yes
S0326	but it's in it's like holiday season it's like good weather it's not the rainy season
S0327	and i don't know anything about actually be careful young men and young women in er you know it do sound as though it's an incredibly criminalise society don't take any risk

S0327	i would quite like to go somewhere like not anymore but i would have like somewhere like peru erm mexican art doesn't er pre columbian art i like
S0326	yeah most of two of my favourite things in book be set in erm the er there's that book under the volcano

S0327	be you i never manage it
S0326	er the fourth time so
S0327	really do you think i should try give it a try
S0326	i dunno it depend er it's like the slower you read it the better it be and like the more you read it cos you it's a it's like it's a complicate book and things you er won't won't notice even on like a third go erm there's a really good thing online a companion someone some sort of malcolm lowry fanatic have make it he's quite it's a really good document like basically every sort of line he have explain the reference or if they talk about a brand of cigarettes they're smoke in it'll have a picture
S0327	right
S0326	of the box of cigarettes
S0327	right
S0326	so it's nice er it's fun to read it with that go through with that to explain you can understand everything
S0327	yes i've get a in my book i've get a picture of cigarettes that my mother use to smoke erm i'll get you coffee mm page sixty one very proud of this actually because i
S0326	yeah it look nice
S0327	it's easy to read you know it's it's not it's quite it's about your various grandparents and things no great look i be
S0326	call pass cloud
S0327	yes they be call pass cloud and i be so that be the only one i could find the only packet i buy it for two pound fifty from ebay
S0327	and that be the only answer i have so i probably have the last
S0327	the last cover of pass cloud and then there's one that you i hope you'll find interest which be the

S0326	what's on at the at the moment
S0327	well there be a kiefer you might be interest in you know kiefer
S0326	i don't think so
S0327	kiefer be this wildly successful er german artist erm rather wagnerian do i have a here absolutely massive work wouldn't fit in anywhere in this house
S0327	erm i have a lot of reservations i mean one cannot but admire what he do erm you know i mean that be something like thirty feet wide and er thirty twenty feet high or whatever have a look in here
S0326	and what erm what years
S0327	he's er he's alive now
S0326	he's alive now
S0327	he's just he's probably a bite younger than me
S0326	yeah it's the kind of thing people go for
S0327	they do i mean the thing be his studio apparently be about ten acres he have er all this amaze amount of space and erm i mean it be big beyond the whole thing be big beyond belief and he's er as he's so go for it erm one have to admire that it doesn't touch the heart with me erm it's too big it's too it's such the ego be
S0327	be almost impossible to understand actually erm i think it'd be worth your go if you want to go and you could go on a friday morning at nine o'clock i can probably always get you in free
S0326	yeah
S0327	er as a i don't er tomorrow in fact i've get to go into the if you could go to want to go tomorrow i'll be there most of the morning and i can leave a ticket or something

S0327	let me know before i'm probably gonna be leave here at half past nine tomorrow morning cos i'm gonna work in the library there actually you might like to see their library
S0326	be it good be it
S0327	it be breathtaking it be and there's a wonderful librarian i mean a real scholar that i'm work with he's find all these marvellous book and print and work and i actually hold with my own hand the very last turner etch that he do it be fabulous erm i mean if you want tomorrow morning to meet we could arrange a time

S0327	er there be also except you can't see them together there be a wonderful exhibition in the gallery of er moroni who's a sort of er slightly forget erm sixteenth century artist mostly portraits but psychologically so incisive and amaze erm so both those i mean the best thing would be for me to find a way of introduce you to there's this bloke call who arrange these things and then he can get you in any time erm otherwise officially friends be be suppose to get in for nothing only on a friday at nine o'clock
S0326	mm
S0327	but you know i can always do it if i can get hold of alright let me know about tomorrow morning er

S0326	i haven't really i don't eat much of them because i don't like cake that much
S0327	oh don't you oh i see
S0326	she make nice er sausage roll that i eat
S0327	okay now er come and see if you can give me a hand in er with the computer
S0326	sure
S0327	if you wouldn't mind it's just one of those little things have actually more or less show me how to do this but i'm not there's certain things i can't do let me quickly show you the the exhibition that i'm this be the idea of the exhibition erm it's go to be call measure for measure the nice thing about that title be nobody can criticise it
S0327	so this er none of this be to scale erm but it's just an approximation of in fact i have that's what i have to do to rescale things so we've get
S0326	and you'll be able to round up originals
S0327	well at at first i think because there's a new erm exhibition erm head of exhibitions call have you hear of him
S0326	no
S0327	he's a very clever sharp probably not very profound journalist art journalist and erm i want to show i want to get something really really great like piero's flagellation do you know piero's flagellation
S0326	no
S0327	which be arguably i mean all of these things be arguably the greatest paint in the world i think i've get a picture here which be in urbino i mean it's a small it's on panel and i say i say well that's what i'd really like and he say oh we'll be able to get that and he say if we don't we can go up the road to the gallery to get the baptism or er piero's baptism or something and i just think oh absolutely wonderous this
S0327	well of course it's all crap you can't you know
S0326	yeah
S0327	er and nor should you those those really great work shouldn't travel so what we've agree be that i will stick to the to draw so that nearly all these be in this country erm that which be such a wonderful erm image be at the louvre and i don't know it's look isn't that wonderful
S0326	yeah
S0327	it's just such a great draw you know so i'm draw attention to the geometry that that's the basis or erm triangle and the stretch outness of the body and so on erm that's and that's so here we've get the classics turner again i don't know if i'll get those two piero might not get those but i would like to get them and of course the thing be it's it's not like me get them have an institution like that behind you
S0326	yeah
S0327	of course be you know that's a whole different thing
S0326	and when and it would be the sort of inauguration of this new space
S0327	i it probably won't be the inauguration i mean it it be very very far ahead erm but it really have to be er they they can't go out to borrow the stuff until there's a good picture of what the exhibition's go to be about erm so so this be this be how it's look at the moment so what i want to do i haven't be able to er i can't remember now i want to get this up and i think i couldn't change the title let's have a look some illustrator
S0326	very secure
S0327	well i'll tell you something i have er all this stuff up here and all my passwords somebody say you can't do that you know anybody can come in and get them so i i put them all in the computer or something and then i lose them
S0327	so i think you know it's if somebody come and steal this it the whole thing will be such a disaster erm i just have to make sure nobody do if i can er wait a minute no i want two page two well that's in preview so i want to put it into illustrator get all the instructions here mm oh okay now if i want to move this i click on it and i can move it
S0326	mm
S0327	if i want to click on that and move it i can't why not
S0326	erm you see i don't use this program but i can probably figure it out
S0327	i'm sure you can
S0326	how do you make the box
S0327	ah you just click and drag it across
S0326	er so these be the instructions
S0327	yes look i've drag it across oh wait a minute i've get to click on that okay and then it should
S0327	it should move well it be move there so maybe
S0326	but not up and down
S0327	but not like that and i've not grasp layer oh it's go back to oh no wait a minute
S0326	mm
S0327	it's gotta be on t for type
S0326	erm why you what do you wanna do what exactly er you do you wanna do to that text
S0327	i would like to put it on that level there
S0326	yeah
S0327	i'd like to be able to move it where i want
S0326	then you just have to make sure you're on that to move it
S0327	i just have to make sure i'm on that
S0326	and if you wanna change the text
S0327	oh yes
S0326	then you'll be able you
S0327	then i just well you er that's solve it and i want to make this smaller and how do i keep it in proportion
S0326	erm you should have go from the corner
S0327	ah
S0326	so if you do apple z maybe it'll undo that
S0327	yeah probably wasn't right to begin with go from the corner that's right no it didn't do it it didn't
S0326	oh no it didn't erm you could
S0327	no i think what i have to do be there
S0326	yeah you can do it up there too
S0327	do i click it like that so it's fix
S0326	yeah it's fix
S0327	like that so then maybe
S0326	no then you do it from here you click er new
S0327	oh do i
S0326	i think so
S0327	ah okay so
S0326	as long as they're fix they should stay erm
S0327	yes okay so
S0326	they should move together yeah see they're they're move together
S0327	they're move together okay it's a pity the original be not right but okay that's very that's helpful let me just see if i can er then i can get i think i've get it
S0327	i think i've get it now this one let me just er i'm not sure what that be then click on that and then i put t for type and then and do a question mark okay i've get that now if i want erm the two page be ask too much for me i think if i want two page together erm
S0326	sit them side by side
S0327	yes have that
S0326	you
S0327	it's gonna come up in preview so i've gotta do it in illustrator as well haven't i
S0326	yeah if you drag it into
S0327	you drag it into illustrator i have learn a bite but i cannot hold it in my head
S0327	i cannot it's terrible okay okay so i can get this er now what do get serious with me cos i
S0327	keep click what have i do here
S0326	i dunno erm
S0326	i dunno what this this erm black screen be
S0327	it's suddenly save unsave so put that again into illustrator okay
S0326	so this be part of your proposal
S0327	yes er er i want to get this er so now i want to make sure i want to move this to the the whole thing now
S0326	you er need to hold it at the top on that grey bar
S0327	okay
S0326	maybe you i don't understand this
S0327	oh god just put it
S0326	click here double click
S0327	well what er it honestly it drive me barmy oh
S0327	erm so i'm but if i want to move the whole thing
S0326	the whole thing
S0327	apple why isn't it
S0326	where do you wanna move it to
S0327	to the leave here so
