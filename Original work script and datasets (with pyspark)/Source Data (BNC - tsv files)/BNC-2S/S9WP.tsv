S0081	em i don't have a company i work for em i get on alright with most of the guard can be a bite try sometimes but that's with all people em the students can be a pain
S0090	true i didn't mention the students but they can be
S0081	that's cos you're be diplomatic
S0090	no but sometimes they're alright like they're more alright than not usually
S0081	yeah there be some nice ones yeah
S0090	em but still doesn't stop me hat the shift
S0081	shift i'm not too bad about nights not too bad wouldn't mind a few weekend off but it's just one of those
S0090	i get a week a weekend off every four weeks so it's not too bad but i always hate the fact that everybody else seem to be work when i'm off
S0081	always the way
S0090	yeah
S0081	i can't remember the last time i've be out
S0090	so what do you hate about the students then
S0081	em they're goby mouth em the lack of respect em their reluctance to just do a simple task like sign this visitors in em mainly be mouthy an unpleasant sometimes
S0090	be they the kind of things that annoy you about normal people as well like the general public
S0081	yeah but the students as well i don't like them lie to me
S0090	right
S0081	i find lie very disrespectful and i don't do it to them so don't be do it to me
S0090	yeah i hate liars as well like obvious liars as well that you're just like why be you say that when it's clearly not true
S0081	yeah and they don't seem to realise that you've be here like a couple of years and you've hear all these lie over and over and over again you're not the first so
S0090	yeah not clever not inventive at all sometimes if it's a bite of a more of an inventive lie i think that's quite funny really so what do you hate in general like what would be your most hat thing like out of work
S0081	out of work em mainly just stupid people
S0090	i hate stupid people too
S0081	i don't pay fool i don't suffer fool
S0090	i hate my neighbour every single one of them

S0090	yeah i would say there's no point in do anything to the pav only like maybe like a lick of paint for when the parent come
S0081	plus they're only students hardly any of them use it so
S0090	no it's only when we have the pav party isn't it and then

S0081	right and people be just sit there dozying like there's about five cars length from the car in front of them pull away and the they decide to pull away so i might squeeze through but there's like five other people who could have get through who didn't get through just cos they're dozy and can't pay attention
S0090	yeah i have an accident once because the person in front of me didn't set off as quick as i think he should of and i run into the back of him so i think technically i be in the right even though it go down as my fault cos i hit him well he should have be pay attention
S0081	i would have hit him in the face soon as he get out the car
S0090	it be it be a bsm one a school of motor thing but it wasn't like a learner so he still can't be forgive and it be rush hour so you've get to be in a rush
S0081	yeah what what's that about let's go ad take somebody em on their first drive lesson right in the middle of rush hour
S0090	i don't know i hate learner drivers they've just open like the new like drive test thing near my house like just round the corner so it's full of learners all the time just like swarm sometimes you can be behind about three or four of them
S0081	see i don't actually mind learner drivers i just don't like their instructors take them out at stupid o'clock in the or even when people be try to get home through rush hour traffic which they're already stress they've have a long day at work they don't want to
S0090	don't want to be
S0081	don't want to be sit in a car they certainly don't want to be sit behind somebody at a traffic light who stall their car like three or four time because some instructor decide oh let's go out on a rush hour and get you all stress
S0090	shouldn't really go out in rush hour until they're like almost ready for the test
S0081	yeah
S0090	when they're like almost like a normal driver
S0081	or if that's the only time they can do it take them down quiet roads don't take them down the busiest roads you can find
S0090	yeah i hat learn to drive as well that's another thing i hat cos i find it really difficult cos i'm not a natural driver i hate drive
S0081	never look forward to mine it be come up to like you know this day and it be like oh get twenty minutes more didn't like that but as soon as i get in the car i be happy as larry then again i have a really fit instructor
S0090	do you choose her because of that
S0081	no she's not choose me more than anything no just the luck of the draw
S0090	my drive instructor wasn't fit he be the dad of one of my friends from high school so be that what else i don't like i don't like sand i don't like beach i'm really miserable aren't i

S0090	no it's too busy and it's really dirty and people be rude it's really expensive and it just feel rubbish proper manky
S0081	i think it be quite manky
S0090	i'd much prefer be like countryside way em
S0090	see that's what i like about manchester you get a little bite of the city and then you've get the countryside right on the doorstep you don't have to go far or you can just look outside the actual city boundaries and pretty much any
S0081	yeah yeah that's what i like about where i live cos it's nearer to bolton but like really near the west pennine moor like there's all like farm field up next to my house estate and stuff so it's a lot nicer but i'm definite close to the motorway to get to like the seaside and stuff
S0090	see that's what i think you should do with have a big ocean and manchester's get a beach seaside just go go up like towards that busby way and you get to the top there and then like where all that would be just stop it all flood nice big sea we'd have a beach and everything would be great
S0081	who be it that say be it ian brown do he say that the only thing miss from manchester be a beach so like like bomb liverpool or something so the
S0090	liverpool be a bite too far away i think he be just be anti scouser there i say just flood a lot easier
S0081	i'm half from my dad's from
S0090	yeah but you're from over that way somewhere aren't you quay it wouldn't affect you flood the quays
