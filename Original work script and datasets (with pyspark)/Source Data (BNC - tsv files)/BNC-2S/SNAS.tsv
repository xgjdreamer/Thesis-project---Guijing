S0488	but like i use to go on it and like it's like basically forums for people like talk about drug and be like the my amphetamine complex and this
S0487	yeah like actually no one's ever die from drug
S0488	yeah no one's it's all the the thing be like with the stories about people die from ecstasy i always just think that's so stupid but now it's like that that be actually
S0487	i never use to
S0488	mm i just think like oh i bet they take like five or like
S0487	mm i don't think it's everyone like
S0487	no no it's just a trigger it's like you have a heart problem you don't know about and it happen to be mix with something that's like stronger on your heart and you've also drink before and it's really
S0488	quite a lot of the ecstasy deaths be like
S0487	rat poison
S0488	actually a bad a pill
S0487	really
S0488	erm
S0487	i literally can't see myself take drug ever again
S0488	like you know you take
S0487	coke yeah
S0488	i think that's just cos like it be peer pressure like be do it and she like keep mention it and then
S0487	what like have a line have a line
S0488	no
S0488	it be like
S0487	she make you do it didn't she
S0488	just keep mention it like oh i've get two grams of coke wow so like
S0487	really
S0488	and then er she be like oh do you want some and i take i didn't well the thing be i didn't say like no i'm not do it i be just like oh not now and then she ask like a couple of more time and i be like oh fuck it but i literally want to kill myself the next day
S0487	yeah you have the freak out didn't you
S0488	mm
S0487	i don't know how you drink though
S0488	what even cos it's bad for my psoriasis
S0487	no just in my head we have a really similar reaction to drug and like for me we erm alcohol be just as bad like it make me feel really depress
S0488	it it i feel i dunno it use to it really use to like awfully depress
S0487	mm
S0488	mm but then not be able to like interact with people when i go out start be really depress too
S0487	do you not find not go out be fine
S0488	yeah but like on my birthday
S0487	yeah
S0488	like if i didn't drink that day and it's like a picnic and everyone's just want to get drink
S0487	mm
S0488	it would have just be me like want to go home early
S0487	home early
S0488	no early like
S0487	early
S0488	no it would have be me like enjoy it for a bite and then everyone get drink and then
S0487	yeah but i always think that but then it's like i forget as soon as i drink i'm not happy so it's like i may as well be home
S0488	but i think i've like discover the secret which be like you can't stop drink once you drink
S0487	as in
S0488	the moment you stop you're doom like you have to like basically you have to keep yourself you have to either be get the same amount of drink or drunker the moment you er like stop you start be undrunk
S0487	mm
S0488	and then it's then you start cos yeah when i like come down from drink
S0487	mm
S0488	i start if i leave it for like an hour erm then i can't anymore like i can't go back into the phase cos i suddenly feel awful
S0487	mm
S0488	it's like you have to keep like poison yourself
S0487	and then until you fall asleep
S0488	yeah yeah so like
S0487	yeah but then
S0488	and i get this thing like if i stop drink for like an hour like on my birthday like three in the morning
S0487	yeah
S0488	i just stop for a bite too long and then suddenly i like can't put anything else in me like i'm just like
S0487	mm
S0488	oh that's awful but i know some people could like go to sleep for a bite and then like wake up and start drink
S0487	mm
S0488	or like do something else and then
S0487	even the word like drink fill me with disgust
S0488	but i think for me it's like like with we've be have like dinner and glass of wine
S0487	mm
S0488	it's like i'm not like oh i'm so like i'm do it for her but like her reaction when i be like oh i'm drink now it's like they actually want to have dinner with you whereas when you're not
S0487	no but
S0488	you like they they it's like a chore
S0487	mm i definitely feel it like even with sometimes he's like i'm sorry but i do really wish you drink cos like i'd love a glass of wine like right now and i know he feel like i'm like a bite of a drag
S0488	mm
S0487	cos like whenever we meet up in the even i just wanna like drink tea and he's like always want to take something
S0488	but that's what i mean it's like i think also because i know that i really don't wanna take drug
S0487	yeah
S0488	but the thing be like
S0487	well compromise
S0488	and and then my psoriasis be like bad anyway in australia and i wasn't drink and then it be like well this be just ridiculous
S0487	yeah but like i think if you enjoy it
S0488	also like apart from india like every culture do have a drink culture
S0487	mm er yeah like obviously if you enjoy it i think it's good erm
S0488	but you know er the other thing i think it be culturally be like if you i be think if like if you're like the whole work thing
S0487	yeah
S0488	if you don't get that much time with people say if i only have like two hours like to meet someone
S0487	yeah
S0488	if you have two hours and you have a drink you get like to a deeper level a lot quicker in term of like a friendlier level
S0487	but isn't that like a horrible thing it's like we're so overwork we have to like take this poison so we can like feel like we connect on a deep level when actually we're like dumbing ourselves down i just and like i don't know i just think there's no good in it cos like sometimes i'm like oh yeah drink like join in but then like as soon as you remember like look at white most white middle age people like their face their nose their skin their blood it's like from drink that's why they're so like bloat and like desensitise
S0488	i don't think it be from drink i think it's from
S0487	er
S0488	eat too much
S0487	every time you eat you every time you drink your brain cells die you get stupider that's what drink do
S0488	be that true
S0487	yeah every time you drink er it drink be like very mild brain damage every time you drink you your brain cells
S0488	even like a glass of wine
S0487	yeah like obviously like a glass of red wine like people say it's good for you for some there be some benefit for your blood and stuff but mentally drink the it slow your reaction because it's like very mild brain damage
S0488	the thing be i'm like the worst type of drinker cos i don't really drink but when i drink i like binge drink and they say that that's the worst type cos if you're someone who just like like a glass of wine it's actually fine because you're not do it to get drink but i don't really particularly want like one glass of wine
S0487	yeah
S0488	it's like either i'm drink or i'm not
S0487	i just feel horrible when i'm drink and like the only time i feel be when i'm drink make me feel really bloat and like big
S0488	it do make you feel like really like chubby and like it make my skin feel really like dry and awful
S0487	it make me feel awful in every way
S0488	you you know like if you're take drug your eye go like big and you feel like
S0487	yeah you're like
S0488	you go like pixie
S0487	yeah you feel like yeah
S0488	but when you're drink it's like the opposite you like become like piggy and you're like oh
S0487	yeah and you become like such a like big white human like bite fatty fat fat i hate it and also i just don't get the social thing like as soon as there's a bite of alcohol in me i'll be like laugh and stuff but my head will be as paranoid as when i smoke weed just like
S0488	mm see i i use to be like that but i'm not anymore the the one thing i find my hallucinate be so much worse when i drink and the next day like this weekend's be awful cos i drink on friday quite a lot
S0487	with
S0488	yeah
S0487	you shouldn't do it
S0488	mm
S0487	the it's such bullshit that we be in a society it's like oh but you're a drag if you don't it's like well then the society can fuck off and you'll
S0488	yeah but the thing be like
S0487	you develop yourself in a
S0488	i completely understand and i'm like i don't care that you don't drink obviously
S0487	yeah so thank you
S0488	i'm not gonna judge you no but when i didn't drink apart from certain friends like
S0487	how be she
S0488	i'd like meet up with a friend for a bite and we like sit and er you can tell like i could feel that they weren't have a good time a lot of the time
S0487	but that's why i don't
S0488	unless it's like in the day and it's obviously a time for a cup of tea but like you feel like a drag and you be a drag to everyone and it be just not fun for me cos i be like i always felt like i'd have to like leave
S0487	mm
S0488	i would have to be like make an excuse cos i just felt like i be like it be a shit atmosphere and if it be one to one
S0487	that's how i feel
S0488	then they wouldn't wanna have a beer and then it's like then they do and you're drink water
S0487	and then they like resent it
S0488	and they you can you can tell they're a bite like on edge
S0487	yeah and they feel judge but like at the end of the day like our society be fuck in those ways it's like such babylon and it's like yeah it mean like a life of sit inside and wait till you meet those people who actually don't care and probably don't drink either but i just think like like i get that feel so much with people
S0488	yeah and it's like
S0487	so like hence not go out much
S0488	and you get load of question like oh what do you wanna do now or like
S0487	yeah i know it's like
S0488	or like like on friday night
S0487	oh do you mind if i have that joint and you're like it's fine
S0488	yeah like on friday night
S0487	and they're like oh
S0488	if i meet up with if have friday even if have come round and we hadn't drink we probably would have like have a cup of tea and like some food
S0487	yeah but what and that's so
S0488	but instead we'd like start drink straight away and like just like blurt everything out whereas like they're just like blurt load of talk and then like cry and i think it's just like cos our society be quite emotionless like the train like everyone be star it's like you need that to like get out your emotions and like start again
S0487	but do you not think like it's all very well say all these like things like it's good for but it's like look at the physics the science it kill your brain cells it make you slow it slow reactions it make you less intelligent and desensitise and there be no way that can be a good thing
S0488	i think at the
S0487	yes in the moment you might feel good but how can you defend it how can you defend it i just don't get it we're so desensitise to it
S0488	but i think it depend because like be say his like great aunt she like drink a like cup of port every day a little cup if you're like someone who's like it's like you know just like it's like almost like a hot chocolate in the even that's different
S0487	yeah
S0488	to like a binge every week a binge every week be still worse
S0487	no i don't it's different if it's like a hot chocolate in the even drink
S0488	like a hot toddy
S0487	yeah but i think mum mum's like drink it habitually like with dinner but she's like mad like we go out it's like it be like five do you remember in chelsea we're have like hummus and she can't like not blurt out that she need a wine and then order one it's like
S0488	mm
S0487	i just think it's
S0488	but it's like a middle class and wine be really bad like i remember at school they just tell us all this stuff like oh like how much be too much and i remember like i swear dad and mum would have like a bottle of wine each a night
S0487	they do
S0488	sometimes like and they'd always have a lot of wine with dinner and always
S0487	and look at them now they're like fat
S0488	but you could be healthy and do that
S0487	i don't think you can for very long like you can't it's poison drink there's no two ways about it that's why if you drink too much you throw up just like if you eat too much you throw up
S0488	but if you eat too much pasta you throw up
S0487	yeah but it be a poison
S0488	animals get animals like eat like ferment fruit and get drink or like it's not completely crazy
S0487	no i think like if you live on a farm and make dandelion wine as like a ritual in the summer you can do it like very occasionally like i don't think that's wrong i just think the way it's normalise in like social it's so pressurise and it's like there's nothing weird about drink in our society at all like i dunno it's just i dunno it's just people just everyone ignore what it really be to the point that like if you say it you're see as mad
S0488	why you don't drink i know
S0487	but it's a poison you can't even deny that maybe one glass of wine with dinner like red wine for like your system but like it's not about the health benefit it's about intaking something because you think life's more fun with it that's kill your body
S0488	but the thing be for me it be kind of like whilst i'm in the system like if i live in india i
S0487	mm
S0488	or somewhere or even like here and i wasn't like be as social i i i'm not like someone who need a drink
S0487	mm
S0488	like i wouldn't go to the supermarket and buy a bottle of wine for myself for like my house but while it's a thing i wanna be able to like see my friends on their term which be
S0487	yeah but you're put at the end of the day you have to keep this body and this mind for the rest of your life like it's delusion it's just not truth food be different obviously you shouldn't be like a chocolate biscuit head yeah but and like i know tea be like not like extremely pure but
S0488	but the thing be i don't
S0487	it's delusion it's not reality
S0488	but do you to me like a process like burger or like load of process biscuits it's like kind of the same body abuse for like momentary pleasures like drink load of like beer
S0487	really
S0488	maybe worse like beer be like
S0487	i don't at all
S0488	oh well a lot more of like beer's a much more natural process or like wine that they've be make forever and like er like it's horrible like process fat and like palm oil which be all like biscuits and stuff that's in biscuits that's why it's even though i be think like oh alcohol be so bad for psoriasis now i'm like there be load of things that be inflammatory like oil erm vegetable oil which be really unnatural like palm oil and stuff which be in all process food and you know how when i start my psoriasis diet it like go away and then as soon as i start eat like gluten free biscuits
S0487	it come back
S0488	it come back like even though those be gluten free and dairy free
S0487	yeah but it's different like but it's not just body abuse it's not like it's mostly not about body abuse it's about also just run away from reality
S0488	but what about like it's okay that's like yeah maybe
S0487	i know like the feel of enhance reality it's like it's not enhance
S0488	okay but maybe that's binge drink which be different but i think like have like a cider or like a glass of wine with your mate at dinner be kind of different to like
S0487	yeah i just think it's like a collective thing in our society it's just like run away and like i just don't like the way it's normalise and it's like it's such a rite of passage it's like oh you're over eighteen you have to drink all the time why don't you drink a glass of wine with dinner oh people who don't drink be bore oh like
S0488	yeah like
S0487	it
S0488	dad be like oh you know aa gill the food writer i've hear he's really bore he like he doesn't even drink and and i be like and dad be like erm erm but other things too and i be like
S0487	yeah and it's like er also yeah it's just
S0488	but the thing be like i didn't use to like it at all like i use to hate it i use to hate that feel but like you know the feel when like your muscle go a bite relax and like you feel really relax after a drink
S0487	you just you feel stupid
S0488	i think some be worse though i find white wine's the most like head confusion to me like white wine's probably the worst
S0487	like obviously chocolate biscuits stuff that's not good either but i think drinking's like a serious evil and it have be like
S0488	but what do you think about like place like russia where like they drink cos it's cold it's like in the culture but it's not necessarily always bad
S0487	yeah i think that be different but then it's like russia like life expectancy be really low there be a lot of violence a lot of abuse it's very dangerous right because they have alcoholics everywhere
S0488	yeah but so be india and they don't drink
S0487	no yeah i'm not say okay place that don't drink don't have their own evils
S0488	that taste like
S0487	what
S0488	chemical
S0487	obviously i'm not say oh if people don't drink there's no evils i just think that it it's an evil that you can easily eradicate and that's normalise our society like yeah russians drink i don't like judge people for drink i just think like
S0488	but do you think the same with drug
S0487	yeah
S0488	and weed
S0487	yeah
S0488	i hate weed now i'm like i just think it's like the worst i think weed be also the worst thing like weed be like a really slow you're like it's not like you smoke and like with a pill i think it's like people who smoke weed they don't really notice it cos it's like a a slow descent
S0487	that's what alcohol be for me alcohol and weed be like the same i think like really natural really natural like erm like african i dunno if people grow like african weed or something like it's really natural and they just have that i think it's like i still don't think it's good practice but i like can understand that i do get that some people like
S0488	i'm just check the time it's it's our thing's at nine isn't it our show
S0487	yeah
S0488	it's not really eight be it
S0487	yeah it's like eight in the morning
S0488	erm i don't know like i just feel like for me the way i felt the way i just i really didn't like feel like a drag it be not fun and i know
S0487	i know but do you not think that's like give in to people's evils
S0488	yeah but the thing be it's like if i be if i be someone who could like like when she doesn't drink she's still like really smiley and chatty but literally that's just not in my nature like i can't
S0487	yeah you're like
S0488	i just can't keep up i i can't be be interest
S0487	i know but that's cos people be bore when they drink
S0488	then i just end up go to bed
S0487	do you not think people be just i don't know i don't like judge people for drink i don't it's i just like it know exactly what you mean i feel so like a drag even with like some of my best friends like be the only one who doesn't drink and er she feel the same way as me like a hundred percent erm
S0488	but it's like you feel like a drag because you be a drag because
S0487	yeah
S0488	to them you like i i know when i'm not drink and everyone's drink i be a drag cos i know like so many time i go out with 's mat and i'm like say to like oh can we go cos it's just so bore and now that i drink it's not like that it's like i can stay cos i'm have fun
S0487	yeah
S0488	and then i feel like you're just stand on the corner like watch everyone and wait for them to like to get tire and get bore and they're not cos they're drink
S0487	i know yeah but it's just
S0488	and then they come over and speak to you and like slur their word and expect you to like get on this deep conversation because you're not drink you have all your barriers so you're not gonna talk about like all this really deep stuff straight away
S0487	yeah but it's not deep it's just mindless that's the thing people who drink delude themselves into think like oh it give you like this deep thing it's like it's not deep it's you be an idiot you don't even remember what you say the the
S0488	not necessarily like say with like the other night we didn't we weren't like mindlessly drink we be just like a bite drink so like when come in and we all basically have a chat about load of stuff and then like we me and have a really deep chat about the funeral and stuff and it's like
S0487	like i obviously
S0488	me and could speak to speak about that but we'd take er age to open up but it wouldn't just be like an hour in
S0487	like i i understand like i just think it's really sad and i really i just think it's sad that it's literally it be every
S0488	be you make a card
S0487	no
S0488	be you make a card shall we make one for as well
S0487	yeah but i only have one pair of scissor
S0488	okay
S0487	erm i just find it like it's such a slippery slope and it's like yeah sometimes i guess but that's not how our society be with drink it's literally every social event with adults
S0488	yeah have you hear 's new song for for any old excuse
S0487	no
S0488	it's like erm jason's pass his gcses let's get fuck up erm joel's sister's erm have her sixteenth birthday let's get fuck up for any old excuse de dum de de and then it's all about like how in england you just any thing like my cousin's best friend's get a job let's get drink
S0487	yeah it be it's any old excuse it be any old excuse it's just bore
S0488	it be but that's the thing it's
S0487	it's bore that people make you
S0488	it's bore cos you don't and
S0487	yeah but people make out that you're bore because you don't drink it's not it's like i don't know
S0488	it's like society be bore
S0487	but society be bore
S0488	no i do believe you but
S0487	society be so bore you can't have a conversation with people the way that god make them just normal
S0488	but do you think it's also like
S0487	cos that's people have get too desensitise and too thick and
S0488	no and i think it be that but then also it's a it's like genuinely from your age to my age i like if i have a drink i would suddenly feel like awful and like literally like i want to kill myself like i'd start get really dark thoughts and i don't get it as bad now like i don't get dark thoughts from the drink i feel like chatty and happy
S0487	yeah but maybe it's like society's pressure's like get to you
S0488	no i think it's like also the whole thing be like drink like exaggerate emotions like i'm not say that you're only not drink because you're like in a phase i'm just say like
S0487	i don't think i be in a phase like i think i definitely think live in india have like affect the way i think about it and obviously i'm not say their society be perfect in any way
S0488	maybe you need
S0487	far from it
S0488	to get drink
S0487	no i don't that's like what drink people say i don't need to poison my body i don't need to act like an idiot i don't need to like spend money on a poison that taste like sugar because i'm too depress in my life that i can't live the way that god make me just normal with my normal mind
S0488	no that be true
S0487	that's like the thing of our society that's like how people think you know it's like twenty four seven i just find it so sad that you can't just meet up with your friends and like have water and like i don't know why it's like we're all try to run from this thing call reality we can't just
S0488	but the thing be i just find like you know like when i always like remember like the gigs i go to when with and stuff and it be so fun
S0487	yeah
S0488	and i always think like oh i be just young and then like so for a few years i've be oh my god life's really shit and disappoint and i feel felt like every event be actually just quite bore
S0487	do you remember that you be drink
S0488	yeah and then i remember like well yeah we use to get drink and like not really drink but like have like two
S0487	yeah
S0488	and then like since i start drink like i've go out and have fun whereas like all the time like like last year when i stay in like i be really adamant that i wasn't drink i'd like go out and go to 's gig and it would just be like it's just something you need it's like a social lubricant that you need if everyone's do it
S0487	in this yeah
S0488	and it's like basically
S0487	this society
S0488	the the think be other people like they won't open up as well to you because you're not drink
S0487	yeah
S0488	but even at erm 's cousin recently
S0487	yeah
S0488	's mum be like oh you don't want a drink do you and i be oh no i'm drink now and she be like oh my god that's amaze and like so nice to me and like bring over champagne and be like cheer and like keep top me up and like then like give me half a bottle just like to have for myself
S0487	yeah she's like
S0488	and everyone be like ply me with alcohol and like love me and i it be then you feel like everyone love you and as much as like of course it's their if i be there and i be like not i would probably just be sit down like not get into it and not get involve
S0487	yeah but then like
S0488	it's
S0487	yeah that's like the name of the game for our society
S0488	it's the name of the game and like
S0487	that's the name of the game with all societies like take part in the mass even if you deep down know it's wrong or like be a the outsider and deal with like a more difficult life
S0488	yeah and that's the same with like
S0487	what be you gonna choose
S0488	be a vegetarian it's like or even be a vegan it's like if you wanna have those value you will also have to realise you're gonna be er the one at the table
S0487	yeah it's yeah it's true
S0488	do you have another piece of paper like that
S0487	yeah
S0488	down there
S0487	no it's true i don't know i just think and like weed alcohol drug it's just such a trap of like the adult world and it's like so desensitise people be so in denial about it and i don't like it you know it's like i yeah even with who's like my best friend i feel like definitely he think i'm quite bore in some ways because i don't drink
S0488	yeah and then i always feel like it's like
S0487	but it's like
S0488	a chore for like for them to see you because you don't drink
S0487	yeah it's like they're it's like oh and a night of sacrifice and it's like
S0488	yeah i feel like they sacrifice
S0487	i'm gonna see okay that's one night that's not gonna be like fun or wild
S0488	that's the thing it's literally feel like a sacrifice to them and i just i be just really sick of that cos i felt like people be like drop in to see and like you're like
S0487	yeah like the baby
S0488	the child that they come and baby and it's just like i just didn't wanna be that person like i i'm not say that you shouldn't be that person i'm just
S0487	yeah but what be that person
S0488	no i'm not
S0487	they be those people
S0488	i i know i'm not say like it like i agree at all
S0487	i know
S0488	i'm just say like that's why i stop because i didn't enjoy that
S0487	yeah
S0488	and it's like i feel like now like people actually like will want me to come to a thing or like come to a dinner party whereas before it's like oh great the the bore non drinker
S0487	yeah
S0488	like it's awful it really be awful
S0487	i dunno i just think you're like the drinkers be the ones it's like we'll see who's laugh when they're all like red nose alcoholics with big
S0488	but i don't think
S0487	bulge belly
S0488	i'll be like that i'm not
S0488	i'm not that into it
S0487	yeah i no i know i can see like the different shade of grey but i can definitely see the different shade of grey i just think it's just
S0488	oh can i use that
S0487	i just really like be i dunno
S0488	what do like
S0487	like
S0488	what shall i cut out for a pumpkin
S0487	like funny things and like food but i don't know
S0488	but i think what
S0488	you what a good thing to do be like join i dunno say like a cycle club or something like there be social things that be like more daytime and be
S0487	but i'm not like look for social things now i'm quite i've get i dunno i'm use to like not do social things i don't care at the end of the day
S0488	but i just think social life be so important i wish i have like make more effort to do more social things like not that i haven't
S0487	yeah but i don't
S0488	but i'm just say like i think that's the thing that you most remember out of life be like things with other people
S0487	yeah but that doesn't have to be the way society spell it out that's the thing yeah obviously
S0488	that's why i really really hope that cos you know the like er a really high member of the police force say the other day it be on the radio that erm he'd much rather the high like the drink high street on a friday night be full of ecstasy users than drink people
S0487	yeah
S0488	i be like i really hope that like drug don't become like drink cos there's one thing for it to be like this with drink imagine if it be like this with drug as well it would be so awful
S0487	yeah but that's not that controversial so obviously he'd rather we're like hug and like feel depress than like fight and throw up
S0488	mm yeah but i personally think that drug have more risk like i think drink can turn you violent and stuff but i do genuinely think drug be more risky with mental health problems
S0487	yeah
S0488	like one time on acid can send you mad but i don't think one time drink like drink be like yeah for a long time you could turn violent or like turn mad or whatever or dependent but i don't think it's gonna happen after like one beer
S0487	no no unless you're like mega mad no it's not but you could say the same about weed
S0488	yeah weed could send you make after one
S0487	no
S0488	yeah weed can give you like psychosis
S0487	after one
