S0255	okay so what i want to do be i've get a spreadsheet and i've get first of all i've get the menu choices so that's
S0256	yeah
S0255	all do that's fine but i've do a to do list so i wanna if we can just go through the to do list open
S0255	just
S0256	you just minimise it
S0255	i do i didn't mean to yeah right
S0256	you need to click the thing the side
S0255	ah yeah okay hold on right i'll just so i can we can see it better what i want to do be just let's go through just go through the list of what we're think and then i just think be there anything i haven't think to do
S0256	yep
S0255	right so i've order serviettes for wrap the cake afterwards when it's chop up
S0256	okay
S0255	and they're come tomorrow
S0256	yep
S0255	table bling i've get eighties eighty confetti
S0256	eighties confetti
S0255	eighties confetti yeah
S0256	disco
S0255	like disco day glo stuff
S0256	mm
S0255	no no no i've get confetti of the number eighty a couple of bag of that
S0255	and some foil thingies to go on the table
S0256	yeah
S0255	with the eighty on as well
S0256	yeah
S0255	and i've ask the and they have say er we're fine to put stuff on the table
S0256	yeah
S0255	we can bring it up and they'll put it on so it'll all be ready and i say er there's like confetti as well yes yes absolutely fine erm so that's table bling which i've buy so and er and i've get it as well so i'll just put receive yeah cos i've get all of that now and then the table plan
S0256	but don't you wanna put erm buy by the serviettes
S0255	yes jolly good buy yep receive so that's order amazon it's come tomorrow i get an email
S0256	yeah
S0255	table bling's receive erm right so the table plan and card we're gonna do the card in a minute
S0256	mm hm
S0255	and then the table plan i think what i what i'm gonna do cos be just say particularly about group certain people together cos some people be share starters but she say she want to make sure she's with us
S0256	yeah
S0255	and erm obviously and then and and cos they know us
S0256	yeah
S0255	yeah and then she want to make sure that er et cetera
S0256	yeah
S0255	be together so i think what i'll just do be i'll send with the menu choice i think i'll just send a thing say please can these people be group together these ones these ones these ones and then they'll set them
S0256	yeah well if you just send like a a yeah exactly like a
S0255	so they don't know exactly what how the table's go to be
S0256	no
S0255	because for fifteen they might put us up in that room up a couple of step do you go
S0256	yes i've be up there
S0255	yeah cos sometimes they do a table round a corner like that or something
S0256	could could you not write like table plan start at this person finish at this person so then they'll work it round how they do the table cos if they do it square
S0255	yeah
S0256	it'll go round if they do it circle it'll go round
S0255	yeah that's a really good idea alright yeah we'll do that in a second then erm
S0256	well we'll get there earlier anyway so we we could check it can't we if it's not right we can move the name round
S0255	yeah yeah and that's well that's something else actually we need to do we need i need to book a taxi cos we're gonna get a taxi with and erm me you and
S0256	yeah
S0255	and will go and meet us there i would imagine erm
S0255	well i don't know
S0255	i'll actually i'll i'll need to find that out
S0256	you find out yes
S0255	okay
S0256	so speak to your son
S0255	speak to son come with us question mark yeah so book a taxi for me
S0256	yeah
S0255	and
S0256	mm hm
S0255	yeah so that's fine er that that be all isn't it there's nobody else we're come with us here
S0256	mm
S0255	that's right cos and be go to go with and and
S0256	yeah
S0255	's have a couple of really bad fit today
S0256	uhu
S0255	so hopefully she'll be okay but we'll have to see
S0256	mm
S0255	hop she'll be alright for saturday be be a shame cos if she's not then won't come and it's
S0256	mm yeah
S0255	you know but anyway we'll we'll see erm right eightieth balloon i ring the card factory up in because i try to buy the balloon online and then you take them there
S0256	yeah
S0255	and they just blow them up for free but they only have one in stock online so i ring and just say just check eightieth birthday i want to get a couple of eighties and a couple of other birthday balloon have you get them er if you have you get a few of them or can you put some by if you haven't get many
S0256	yeah
S0255	and er they say oh no we've get quite a lot of them and we don't tend to sell that many of them so i say that's fine so i'm gonna go on saturday and get them get them
S0256	that's good
S0255	blow up
S0256	yep
S0255	and then take them like that so i've get the erm the menu choices which i've get to email which
S0256	mm
S0255	i will do tomorrow that's to the
S0256	mm
S0255	the email address there i've get to email the menu choices i've confirm if it be fifteen now when i ring and speak to
S0256	yeah
S0255	oh you know who be there that the deputy manager
S0256	yeah
S0255	when i er ring and speak it be him that answer the phone and just to confirm i say oh it's fifteen now and and he say oh yeah yeah that's right the other young lady i remember speak to you and i think young lady
S0255	erm but he basically say he be leave the next day but he say will be look after you and he say have be here for a long time
S0256	yeah
S0255	so it's probably one might even have be that waitress one that really seem to know
S0256	yeah
S0255	what she be do she seem quite er organise others as well but anyway so er it's so i'm gonna send that tomorrow and confirm get them to confirm it firm it
S0256	yeah
S0255	so the cake i've order the cake erm and i've speak to this week who's
S0256	yeah
S0255	do it and she say yeah i'm gonna go and see it friday morning at about ten o'clock
S0256	uhu
S0255	and pay for it erm and then 's gonna take it to on saturday
S0256	yep
S0255	because i think if i try and bring it home and then you know she might see it or
S0256	yeah
S0255	and but say that's absolutely fine she'll drop it down there she's she's often deliver cake for people so
S0256	that's good
S0256	the other thing you could do about the table plan be ring them and ask them how they would er how they think they'd do the table we've get a table plan or the other option be we just get there a bite earlier and just put the table name place on
S0255	we could do actually couldn't we
S0256	and just do that ourselves
S0255	take take them
S0256	yeah
S0255	yeah we could we could take them
S0256	i think that would probably be easier
S0255	cos er that'd that's it cos
S0256	because if they end up do a horseshoe or whatever cos if you're think about put people together cos i be just think through with our little like group i be think like
S0255	yeah
S0256	us and but i be think well if you put say for example you put next to me and then you put the other side and then there's
S0255	mm
S0256	people he doesn't know
S0255	yeah
S0256	he's not gonna talk to anyone
S0255	yeah
S0256	wanna have it like a four
S0255	him and
S0256	like you know him and sit opposite each other or
S0255	yeah
S0256	whatever like that so then you can talk and and
S0255	yeah
S0256	rather than be cos then people can sit near
S0255	yeah yeah
S0256	rather than
S0255	we'll do that
S0256	it be along in a line
S0255	mm yeah no that's fine we'll do that
S0256	yeah
S0255	and then
S0256	ah
S0255	so when we're do the card the the menu card things er if we do the name so that the people that be share starters if we just on the back of one
S0256	yeah
S0255	er just put like a a
S0256	or in the
S0255	or b b
S0256	in the middle of it where you open it up
S0255	yeah
S0255	i'm gonna put all the name
S0256	yeah
S0255	but yeah if you just put a and a or b
S0256	yeah
S0255	and b
S0256	yeah
S0255	and then and we
S0256	yeah
S0255	when we're do it we can just look right that make sense this be why i want to talk through it with someone
S0255	because it i've be do bits and bob on and off and then keep come back to it cake deliver september
S0255	oh separately
S0255	maybe
S0256	yeah that'd be separately

S0255	no we take them all down the garage when we have a clear out in there because we didn't need them that often and be try to make space
S0256	the usual
S0255	the usual so he take everything out and then move some things
S0255	and put everything back in
S0256	no one can ever find anything because it's never where it live because he get bore and move stuff
S0255	yeah he do
S0256	this be why he you can't be at home too much because he end up just rearrange the house and then i don't know where anything be
