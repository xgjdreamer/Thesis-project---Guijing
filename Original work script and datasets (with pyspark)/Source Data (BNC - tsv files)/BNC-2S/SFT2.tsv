S0058	in a tiny bowl i'm like argh tuna all over the bench it's horrible i want to go to bed
S0120	half past eleven i be mm mooch around in my mess of a room in the dark watch the second half of cat
S0058	mhm why dark
S0120	i dunno just cos it make it a worse image
S0120	mm
S0058	oh right okay
S0058	nice that's er that's brilliant so you're sort of as you're do things you're think hm what'll make this image worse i'll turn all the light off
S0120	no
S0120	mm
S0058	cat be good though
S0120	it be mm
S0120	definitely a better choice than phantom
S0058	yeah i've only see the film of that once and i wasn't massively impress
S0120	er phantom
S0058	mm
S0120	er
S0058	er er i love the story i love the songs
S0120	i saw it in the cinema
S0058	mm
S0120	that be the first time i'd see it
S0058	mm
S0120	or even hear the story or whatever
S0058	oh okay right
S0120	mm
S0058	cos i'd hear
S0120	film
S0058	all the songs but i'd never see any version of it and i kinda like the film but i kind of felt like i really want to see it on stage i sort of er like some bits of it i just yeah
S0120	i do um see er record of some of the stage versions
S0058	mm
S0120	and um i dunno it's probably it's probably because um because the er the film version be you know studio enhance and everything and
S0058	right hm
S0120	i mean they're obviously redubbed
S0058	mm
S0058	yeah
S0120	so um
S0058	be all all the actors be redubbed for the songs aren't they
S0120	hm
S0058	be the all the actors redubbed for the songs i can't remember
S0120	i i
S0058	as in
S0120	i think they must be i mean i'm not
S0058	cos i don't know if it's them sing
S0120	it be
S0058	it be okay
S0120	it be them
S0058	okay apart from jennifer ellison
S0120	but it's
S0058	who it isn't her
S0120	it's just a studio then sorry
S0058	oh i see yeah
S0120	except
S0058	apart from jennifer ellison she play the opera singer blonde long hair
S0120	oh what the the the the arrogant one
S0058	mm mm
S0120	oh that isn't her
S0058	i don't think so because she's a actress off hollyoaks and while she can sing er she's quite a good singer i don't think she can sing like that
S0120	oh right
S0058	cos i remember read about it and think that's disgraceful why didn't she sing her own songs and then listen to it i be like oh well fair enough
S0120	and of course she have to be good enough at sing to sing badly
S0058	mhm
S0120	or
S0058	yeah
S0120	intentionally badly
S0058	yeah
S0120	hm
S0058	but
S0120	but yeah
S0058	yes i know what you mean so they're just they they be purely sing whereas on a stage i guess
S0120	mm
S0058	bite different
S0120	mm
S0058	but um it's the original you know um some mother do 'ave 'em
S0120	no
S0058	oh okay it's a seventies um sort of tv it's a sort of cheesy tv comedy with a character call um frank oh dear i can't remember his surname anyway um frank spencer that's it and er it's the catchphrase oh betty he's completely hapless and useless and he wear a beret he's always do things pathetically wrong he's like and his wife's call betty and he's always like oh betty and he's
S0120	okay
S0058	the most pathetic individual and he be the original phantom and it's just such a massive sort of shift in your brain
S0120	mm
S0058	but he's really good like i've hear um record of it and it be really good
S0120	mm mm wasn't it be it sarah brightman who be
S0058	mm
S0120	what's her name um
S0058	the woman
S0120	yep
S0058	yeah
S0120	er
S0058	i think it be her
S0120	on stage
S0058	christine
S0120	but er yeah
S0058	mm
S0120	um i prefer the voice of the one in the film
S0058	mm
S0120	partly because she be less vibrato
S0120	and er obviously
S0058	yeah
S0120	probably the reason she could do that be because it be studio record
S0058	mm yeah
S0120	but you know hm
S0058	but
S0120	yes i think cat be a better choice
S0120	cos otherwise i'd be mop
S0058	it be quite sad
S0120	yeah
S0058	cat be kind of sad but in a
S0120	you know they um like
S0058	weird way so
S0120	they record a a brand new um song for the end credit of the film
S0058	for cat
S0120	mm
S0058	oh right never see that presumably make up lyric as well cos
S0120	no not not cat no not cat sorry
S0058	oh phantom right
S0120	phantom mm
S0058	uh huh no i didn't know that
S0120	and indeed yes make up lyric
S0058	hm
S0120	but less so
S0058	mm
S0120	um entitle
S0058	hm
S0120	learn to be lonely
S0058	oh dear
S0120	i know
S0058	oh my god
S0120	exactly

S0120	yeah
S0058	depress
S0120	it's er it's a good song
S0120	it's nice and kind of you can see it in a kind of positive no
S0058	yeah maybe i haven't hear the word it might be chirpy and cheerful but
S0120	it's not chirpy and cheerful
S0120	it's at least kind
S0058	mm

S0120	the rumpleteazer
S0058	she's pretty cool
S0120	yeah
S0058	yeah a bite more prominent
S0120	mm
S0058	a bite more prominent as well as in in a song
S0120	oh yeah
S0120	i'm not base it purely on that
S0058	she's er she's a cool cat
S0120	mm
S0058	i sort of feel duty bind
S0058	to say rum tum tugger because i know the guy who play him
