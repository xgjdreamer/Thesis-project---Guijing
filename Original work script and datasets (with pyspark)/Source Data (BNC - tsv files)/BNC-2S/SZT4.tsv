S0486	you see that
S0528	no i haven't see that
S0486	erm well we ask someone to come with us and she say she didn't want to come because it would horrible and they torture them and all that sort of thing but actually it be a very good film and it be in the same vein
S0528	yes
S0486	it be an educational film
S0528	yeah yes
S0486	it be i reckon a drama documentary
S0528	yeah it do it record history which will be forget if someone do not record it
S0486	no
S0528	as such
S0486	and erm
S0528	yeah
S0486	that's great i mean they can keep do downton abbey until they're blue in the face by just make up plot it just turn
S0528	yeah
S0486	into coronation street really
S0528	yeah
S0486	but erm with these sort of spot erm interest i be i i'm relate to lloyd george the prime minister erm very distantly but i be relate to him i mean everybody laugh and say they're relate to lloyd george but i be and he be in the suffragette film or the actor play lloyd george
S0528	right
S0486	be in the suffragette film and that be very interest
S0528	yeah
S0486	so i recommend it to you it's not erm a bite like the turing film it it's not erm it you don't come out feel happy it's not a happy film
S0528	no
S0486	but at the same it's instructional and and you can
S0528	yeah
S0486	get the gist of the ideas at the time
S0528	well there be so much we don't know about for instance world war two
S0486	yeah
S0528	you know erm for example my father be a military policeman
S0486	oh be he
S0528	erm and he serve in north africa and italy tunisia and he end up in romania and people say we we didn't have force in romania but we do
S0486	right
S0528	we have a military police detachment there
S0486	right
S0528	be basically do what this country do in iraq i think when they send out police first of all and there be a sad loss of seven policemen who be
S0486	really
S0528	mob and kill
S0486	yes
S0528	by a gang er that's what my father do it be a small group of policemen
S0486	really
S0528	in romania erm he have collect a large number of photograph pose with russian officer
S0486	right
S0528	all sort local people local events er when he die i ask my children erm these photographic albums be quite an unusual record
S0486	uhu
S0528	erm if i give them to you will what will you do with them
S0486	mm
S0528	and they say well we'll take care of them dad you know
S0486	yeah
S0528	and i so i choose then i ask their consent and i donate them all the military police museum
S0486	oh right
S0528	and they be actually thrill to bits because apparently they get load of paperwork about servicemen
S0486	yeah
S0528	rarely get any photograph
S0486	right right
S0528	and there's my dad in his military police uniform
S0486	oh
S0528	with his jeep
S0486	yeah
S0528	pose with russian officer it incredible record they be thrill to bits so it they've get all his personal documentation his id card his medals he be mention in dispatch
S0486	yeah
S0528	they've get a complete record of one sergeant in
S0486	yeah
S0528	military police
S0486	a real family pride then on an er as of an ancestor really
S0528	yes and i didn't want it to get lose in the future
S0486	no no
S0528	i think that
S0486	speak up oh they've go by
S0528	if it go if it go into history like that
S0486	yeah
S0528	that's a good record of world war two
S0486	right yes
S0528	from an unusual aspect of it you know
S0486	yes exactly yeah it be
S0528	and he do survive the war
S0486	yes
S0528	er it do torment him later in life
S0486	yes yeah
S0528	but erm yeah
S0486	how do you if you can speak up a little more because we've get some people outside erm how do you see then when you see flog it and people be sell their medals and
S0528	i i don't really like it but i i don't think you can you you can't manage it can you they they become erm value items and people will sell them erm if the family don't take care of them and pass them on
S0486	yes
S0528	to different generations
S0486	yes
S0528	then they get lose anyway
S0486	yeah yeah
S0528	it's sad that they've become an item for make money on
S0486	oh it do it be yeah
S0528	but that's again why i decide that my father's record and his medals
S0486	yeah
S0528	should all go to the military police
S0486	yes exactly yeah and and you and and that's right and and it's assure now and you you can rest rest assure i mean i've get a collection of erm lloyd george memorabilia not that i've they're just things that
S0486	the family have that for some reason people give to me no one else want them
S0528	no
S0486	and erm i get a lot of book erm and my idea one day be to go through them and maybe write something of my own but i'm actually more of a novel writer and a poetry i'm i'm in the middle of a novel at the moment i'm on page er on chapter fourteen erm of my first novel and i've do a poetry book so far erm but erm that's what i'm do but anyway erm back to you so do you do any write at all
S0528	no i i i'm not a writer cum author of any sort i do enjoy put letter together
S0486	right
S0528	and there's plenty of opportunity with the problems that we have these days
S0486	yes that's right
S0528	and whether it be problems with power company or whatever
S0486	yeah
S0528	and i quite enjoy put letter together
S0486	yeah yeah
S0528	and make my point
S0486	yes
S0528	but without be too rude about it
S0486	no exactly well you you know who be a past master at that be charles dickens
S0528	oh right yeah
S0486	if you ever get a chance to look up charles dickens his letter to his clock maker or clock mender erm he write some very witty letter erm and i won't i i can't repeat it in the same way as charles dickens write it so it's best that you look it up because it's very entertain
S0528	okay
S0486	really very entertain indeed erm so yeah but erm it be nice to bring if you're complain about something it's nice to bring a bite of humour into it don't you find that
S0528	oh i think so er you need to make the point strongly that you be try to get home
S0486	yeah
S0528	on the other hand you don't demand
S0486	no
S0528	you may expect but not demand
S0486	yeah yeah
S0528	er and i always try to put a sensible letter together and i always try to keep it to one page
S0486	yes that's right
S0528	i think people don't like to go
S0486	no
S0528	onto a second page
S0486	no it's the same if you're apply for a job it's always best to keep it on one page
S0528	on one page
S0486	yeah
S0528	yeah
S0486	one page erm and also in to my mind i always make the typeface slightly larger because it's easier to read erm er you know if if type if the type be very small people even younger people have get challenge eye problems haven't they whoa it's get a bite noisy outside isn't it
S0486	anyway we've get another five minutes to do so
S0528	that's okay
S0486	we'll have to you'll have to shout you see erm so erm be you involve in this erm show that they're go to put on next year
S0528	i don't have any detail at the moment
S0486	you don't no
S0528	of the show and i don't know what's plan
S0486	no no
S0528	but i would like to be involve anyway
S0486	yeah yeah okay well i'm sure they i'm sure that we will be erm erm it'll be all hand on deck won't it
S0528	i would imagine so if there's some
S0486	yeah
S0528	big function
S0486	i be i mean always when they've do show before i i've always bring my art along when when they be in the school like they have one in the school erm several years erm and i bring my art along and erm exhibit it but i didn't make any sales because it's not that sort of show i do think though maybe you might like to press the point erm you didn't hear it here that there might be some things for women because if the men come if you do something for women as well then it'll mean you'll get more support all the way round and i think that'll be a good idea really
S0528	i think it's important that you do try and involve the ladies these days you know otherwise erm they can become treat as er tea makers and
S0486	yes
S0528	and that's that's not on
S0486	that's not on
S0528	you know it's
S0486	that's not on
S0528	it's better that they take a an interest
S0486	yeah
S0528	er role in the organisation even if it's only from time to time
S0486	yeah somebody ask me er or a few years ago now if i'd like to make the teas for something that an organisation that be part of and i i say to my husband well if i be hold an art group would he come and make the teas for me
S0486	he wouldn't so i say no i'm not do it erm
S0528	no
S0486	because erm you know women aren't just hangers on
S0528	no
S0486	they're people in their own right and to be treat like that it's it's go back victorian time
S0528	it be it be
S0486	erm and it's erm although i'm not terrifically women's lib i'm i believe in equality and that's not treat people equally at all
S0528	at at time in my last employment with the build society er i have a rather problematical manager to deal with
S0486	yeah
S0528	and his secretary start to follow his same attitude and she be quite rude to me one day
S0486	really
S0528	and i go to both him and the girl and i say i don't mind whether you call me or mr
S0486	right
S0528	i don you choose i say but i do expect you to respect my age and my experience in the way you speak to me
S0486	yeah yeah
S0528	and i say and i don't mind whether i work for a lady manager
S0486	yeah
S0528	or a male manager
S0486	yeah
S0528	i'm quite happy
S0486	yeah
S0528	as long as they know what they be do
S0486	yeah
S0528	as long as they know the job
S0486	yes exactly exactly
S0528	and i've always felt that way and there be
S0486	exactly
S0528	to that degree equality be most important that women should have the opportunity
S0486	yeah yes it be very important
S0528	yeah
S0486	i mean the erm use of the word lady be erm be great and i be bring up to use it because it be erm a term of respect
S0528	yes
S0486	but these days i mean you think if you go to the doctor you call you say well i'd like to see a male doctor you never say i would like to see a female doctor you say i'd like to see a lady doctor
S0528	doctor
S0486	that should go it should be male or female
S0528	yeah
S0486	to be equal to the male
S0528	yes
S0486	erm because it's a stigma really erm the use of the word lady erm or woman a woman doctor my mother always tell me to use the if you say oh that woman over there have get a bright red jacket on my mother would say to me it's very rude to use the word woman you've always get to say lady
S0528	yeah
S0486	well that's not that's not so anymore and it can't be so in in these days of equality
S0528	no no
S0486	because you'd say that man over there nobody would say well that's rude you can say gentleman
S0528	yeah
S0486	that man over there but it's very strange erm and these things be be erm be be weed out over the years aren't they
S0528	yeah i i've get involve with a number of other activities as well and and one be work in the hospice movement
S0486	right
S0528	and i've work in the hospice movement for more than sixteen years now
S0486	really yeah
S0528	and i have to change as i use to be a minibus driver and then the nhs get rid of most of the minibuses
S0486	right
S0528	and i have to either withdraw from the hospice or find something else to do
S0486	right
S0528	and i i choose to go to college at the age of sixty six i think
S0486	do you
S0528	and i do er swedish body massage
S0486	oh really oh right my goodness
S0528	erm that be the most extremely reward thing i have ever do with in particular terminally ill patients
S0486	really yeah yeah
S0528	and i think it's it's not so much the massage but it's the warmth of somebody's touch
S0486	yes exactly
S0528	but initially it be a little bite of a problem because i'm sure the hospice felt that oh we shouldn't have a man
S0486	yeah er
S0528	handle these ladies
S0486	yeah yeah yeah
S0528	but in the end it go complete reversal and the ladies
S0486	right
S0528	would ask for me
S0486	yeah yeah yeah
S0528	and it be a matter of build trust
S0486	yeah
S0528	and take someone into a therapy room
S0486	what a wonderful thing to do
S0528	it it be it be
S0486	what a you still do it do you
S0528	i still do it but because we've move into a different area
S0486	yeah
S0528	erm it's still in its infancy
S0486	right
S0528	with the health and wellbeing centre in
S0486	right gosh oh right
S0528	so i i'm due to be there this afternoon
S0486	oh be you gosh
S0528	and er
S0486	you be you do get around don't you that's wonderful
S0528	there may or may not be people who would like to try
S0486	no no exactly
S0528	they can have simple things
S0486	yeah
S0528	in fact the club could even do it if they have a thing with ladies here
S0486	yeah
S0528	they could have hand massage
S0486	yes exactly that would be lovely
S0528	or to hand or feet or
S0486	well that's a wonderful idea now you see i wonder how many of those people out there know that about you and i know in fifteen minutes today
S0528	most of the men wouldn't know er
S0486	they wouldn't
S0528	because you have to obey erm all the er the rule about er privacy
S0486	yeah
S0528	you don't
S0486	yeah
S0528	talk about people
S0486	no no
S0528	i would talk about an individual but
S0486	yeah
S0528	no name or
S0486	no of course not
S0528	where or when
S0486	no of course not
S0528	erm and it would only be a hint of
S0486	yeah
S0528	the sort of things
S0486	yeah
S0528	that people have to face
S0486	yeah
S0486	i mean so many
S0528	yeah
S0486	you're you're right thing about not be touch so many people be maybe live on their own or go into a hospice they they they're they're come to the end of their life and you know they've get no one no one ever touch them
S0528	that's right
S0486	they've go they've get completely no human contact
S0528	no and i felt that be important in the hospice environment because so often it's perhaps elderly ladies
S0486	mm mm
S0528	who have be live on their own as a widow for perhaps twenty
S0486	mm
S0528	thirty years
S0486	yeah yeah
S0528	and no one have touch them
S0486	no
S0528	but in that safe environment
S0486	yeah
S0528	in a ward
S0486	yeah
S0528	in the room er surround by nurse staff and other staff
S0486	yeah
S0528	i i have find it extremely reward the reactions
S0486	yes
S0528	it's just quite amaze
S0486	yes i'm sure
S0528	er
S0486	yeah the other thing too which i mean it's it's very different but it's the same sort of thing people who take their friendly dog into place
S0528	oh yes
S0486	and they're allow to stroke them
S0528	that's right
S0486	and the touch of that be so beneficial
S0528	it's such a highlight that be
S0486	it be yeah
S0528	yes yeah
S0486	and i mean there's something about a dog that always you know want you to smile you want to smile don't you there's something about a dog or a pet
S0528	and they have get a level of understand that far outreaches
S0486	oh yes
S0528	what we have they know
S0486	er
S0528	what's go on
S0486	yeah they do
S0528	yeah they do

S0486	and all sort of diseases and it's
S0528	yeah
S0486	not just cancers it
S0528	mm
