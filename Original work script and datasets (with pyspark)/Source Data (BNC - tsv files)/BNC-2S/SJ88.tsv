S0192	yeah i don't know anyone that's get through the the whole thing you know mate
S0228	have you watch the whole thing yet
S0192	it be pretty dark
S0228	yeah mate
S0192	it be hard i couldn't do it i don't know anyone that's manage to do it the first time i i couldn't do it the first time the first time we and i stop it the second time we watch it all the way through
S0228	no
S0192	i say that to people when they talk about some programme that's sweep them off onto off beef or something or some something random like supersize me or some bullshit now they don't like mcdonald's but i'm like fuck all that shit just watch this
S0228	mm
S0192	this one film and if you have any qualms about
S0228	no that's nothing that's get nothing to do with food though it's just
S0192	no it didn't put me off eat food at all
S0228	i think it's more of a
S0192	it just treatment of animals just
S0228	outlook on yeah just er nature around us
S0192	yeah it's speciesism isn't it that's what the whole thing's about it's random that you
S0228	yeah i i know i think it's just i don't know the way i see it
S0192	i mean we treat our own people terribly as well but we're not rob
S0228	mm
S0192	i mean we've do terrible things to our own people so i guess we have so it doesn't really compare but this be just focus on the er animal trade the problem be that when you do it to a person any of the things that happen to these animals it's an outrage and like you get try with full arm of the law but when it's to animals these things just go on for profit generally and just get overlook
S0228	well yeah
S0192	because things have to and under this paradigm things just have to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and easier more easily produce to make more profit the next year i just think at the detriment of animals that's the main problem like i would quite happily pay more for my meat if it be just treat better
S0228	mm
S0192	er it bother me that like organic food be specialty food you have to pay to not be poison
S0228	the guy who's in charge of the farm this guy he say he be talk about the farm we have like an induction on the farm
S0192	mm
S0228	a powerpoint thing he be like we're not organic if you think you're like if everyone want farmers to be organic a lot of people would die of starvation and it's true man like
S0192	wouldn't product enough
S0228	yeah i think like if you've gotta think where we've come from i understand whatever you're say i agree with it but if i think the reason why it's go on be cos we like our ancestors and people before us have go all through that
S0192	mm
S0228	do you know what i mean
S0192	mm
S0228	and make that transition from nomadic to farm then
S0192	but we can make a transition beyond it again
S0228	get better food and stuff yeah yeah i that's what i think
S0192	you've get to use technology to get beyond
S0228	but then
S0192	still there's
S0228	over thousands of years of that happen you then have things like religion in the mix and they say like in the bible that you have erm you have i can't remember what how they say it what they it be now but basically they say you have domain or something so over like erm er animals or domestic and pet and shit like that oh no pet the feral and fuck domestic so or something
S0192	what be we talk about again i've just forget
S0228	er er er why all like erm our treatment on animals and why things meat
S0192	yeah
S0228	you'd rather pay more
S0192	but you be say not everyone could have organic food but to a certain degree if everyone have a little plot of land that they could farm
S0228	do you know where they do that
S0192	and i mean you could product your own organic food and if you didn't do that and you still do mass produce it then just by the fact that we do it at the minute you've just get like organic food be two or three time more than normal food but
S0228	be that look up in the internet
S0192	because they're not use pesticides and it's cheaper to do it this way etcetera etcetera but i mean if you mass produce organic food
S0228	mm
S0192	it would bring the price down because you're do more of it
S0228	mm
S0192	er the but the problem be you can't be organic either because
S0228	well what you should do be have you go the internet
S0192	cos the the grind be already pollute
S0228	in cuba they in cuba i think when they have some issue over their fuck government or whatever they be go to be cut off from a major supplier so the government initiate this thing so it's like allotments but it's do on like you're fuck do it sort of scale
S0192	yeah
S0228	and it's it produce like load of food for everyone on the island so it's basically what you're say it's already do
S0192	yeah
S0228	it's just do on a it all depend though where it's really that's quite not free even though it be free it's not in of like how to put it in a communist sort of government if you know what i mean i don't know if this be go well far fetch like but their government produce that idea
S0192	mm
S0228	and propagate like erm yeah what's the word your propaganda and everything to influence everyone
S0192	propagate
S0228	into that that way of think
S0192	mm
S0228	so really
S0192	i'm not against that personally
S0228	mm i know but you say if someone be
S0192	mm
S0228	and they do it in a situation where they be gonna go to war and people be gonna die so we've go through that scenario before in the second world war and the first world war
S0192	oh no we have
S0228	we get but now as we've get so many people on this island that if we try that we wouldn't fee everyone
S0192	no no there be much too many people
S0228	more more of our cereals and grain come from russia
S0192	yeah but it but it bother me though that we
S0228	we don't product enough food this be why the guy say you can't go organic
S0192	yeah we obviously import
S0228	because you don't produce enough food
S0192	everything pretty much
S0228	most of our pork come from denmark
S0192	but doesn't it bother you that i mean i know that like you go and you buy potatoes and it's from israel or somewhere like that and you're just like
S0228	mm
S0192	well why english be perfect potato grow land and what i don't what i find strange when i fly in be that there be we live all so cramp together and feel like we're really really over populate and we be really over populate but there's still so many so much farmland when you fly in england be just green all over
S0228	mm but i think it's not just that though
S0192	it's not only the areas of live and it's like
S0228	now like now i mean like i work as a gardener there be load of factor what you can take into account first of all you've get the weather and the weather be change
S0192	yeah
S0228	and then also there be load of like pests hundreds of pests different diseases load of them different fungal
S0192	but you can control quite a bite of this they've get the technology now to to farm up
S0228	hang on hang on let me finish mate there's load of stuff
S0192	not just farm along to farm up hydroponic
S0228	yeah yeah yeah yeah so some people be do that yeah some people be do that but there's load of stuff what can affect plant mate load of okay
S0192	no of course i'm not say
S0228	and then they do make they do breed like cultivars which be resistant to certain diseases but you've get to think there's not just diseases above grind there's below grind load of things go to factor it
S0192	yeah
S0228	so they do develop and that's why people be push for genetically modify crop
S0192	mm
S0228	and some people be against it i agree with what you're say but we haven't refine it that yet
S0192	we don't have the technology yet to properly do it we don't have the mastery over the land
S0228	i think and if more emphasis be put on ray mears make a good point man like i remember see the video clip of him on youtube and he say like yeah we've get the farm like we farm now but he say he believe it's still at an experimental stage cos
S0192	mm
S0228	we lose more species to like to habitat loss and that's due to farm things like shooters so the basc foundation for like shoot the national one they it more most more money
S0192	basque as in like the country
S0228	yeah so you know all the shooters shoot
S0192	basque
S0228	fuck pigeons it's like the british association for shoot and
S0192	that's in northern spain basque
S0228	no no you're think of basque isn't it
S0192	basque yeah basque
S0228	i'm think of basc b a s c
S0192	oh okay sorry
S0228	anyway
S0192	yeah
S0228	most shooters and like game keepers who people think destroy like bird or whatever actually get more money than any other government thing
S0192	oh okay
S0228	but my this what he be say about farm that it just destroy more habitat think how many woods ever everything's lose just for farmland
S0192	mm
S0228	to grow one type of crop
S0192	obviously
S0228	so he be say people be happy think how the farmers and right but really we've only get it at an experimental stage there be still further to know really
S0192	but what i'm say about have a small organic garden per community or whatever
S0228	mm
S0192	if you take england when i be say when you're fly in and it we're all live very close together and under the illusion that you know we're have to import in all this stuff and we can't grow very much but yet i see field everywhere which make me think if you just spread out where we live so instead of us live
S0228	yeah but mate what you're see be not all edible
S0192	as not together but a lot more like the state more like america where they all have detach house and
S0228	oh what you're say be if everyone grow yeah but
S0192	and then if you grow
S0228	it's it's make the money as well it's make the money
S0192	if you have a plot of land between your small community or something
S0228	oh well grow enough food for you to survive the year i think that's a lot harder than what you think mate
S0192	no enough food to supplement so you could you could live off still off import but you didn't you weren't it wasn't a problem if
S0228	think you'd rather see
S0192	your tie get cut to countries because you'd have enough food to carry you through it
S0228	yes but the population's massive mate
S0192	yeah i know it be ridiculously big but
S0228	and what be you gonna fee them
S0192	but the country's big
S0228	what be you gonna fee them
S0192	when you look at the space when you fly in that's what i'm say there's there's so much space
S0228	but yeah but what be you gonna fee them well what crop do you think would be good wheat
S0192	erm i don't think you need to live off wheat i'm talk about smaller things like the community of like say twenty to thirty to fifty to a hundred people have a small farm that they all manage
S0228	mm
S0192	therefore that they don't need to put much time into it because they can still do their job because everyone's manage it
S0228	yeah
S0192	and you just have like corn and runner bean and spinach and
S0228	yeah
S0192	you know strawberries
S0228	do you know what that's call that's call intercropping
S0192	yeah
S0228	they do that a lot in er in europe and stuff
S0192	i'm just say it's possible here
S0228	yeah that be sort of like organic but it's a lot harder than what you think
S0192	yeah i'm not say it's easy you'd need to train people in it
S0228	it's like companion plant cos
S0192	mm and we need to equitably spread people out
S0228	you can't just
S0192	because at the minute we're all just like we can't farm around here where be we gonna walk to through the to field where the
S0228	mm yeah it's a dream man i don't think you could do that in this country
S0192	oh no of course by you're allow to dream aren't you
S0228	in some way but that's but that's what i'm say like
S0192	i just think
S0228	you have to have a very on board on board view everyone have to think that if you've get a weak in the chain it doesn't work do you know what i mean if everyone didn't think that you'd have waste and it you wouldn't really get the right result
S0192	no
S0228	it's quite communist
S0192	communism
S0228	or or it could be quite socialist be there any difference between socialism and communism
S0192	i'm not really sure i'm gonna bring this thing in so we can think talk
S0228	do you think there's any difference between socialism and communism er communism
S0192	i don't think communism have exist erm in the world outside of traveller societies since the invention of capitalism which happen a lot longer ago than they seem to think it do i think since the agro industrial revolution of like five thousand years ago we've effectively be capitalist and only in erm tribal societies connect from that and they're still able to they have a form of communism
S0228	but do you know what socialism be then
S0192	erm socialism i find hard to demarcate from communism i can define communism and capitalism
S0228	would you say labour's socialist
S0192	i don't care to comment cos i don't i don't know anything about british politics now
S0228	well no i think it's just how do you describe socialism so i'm say
S0192	i have an image of labour from about six to eight years ago
S0228	well how the nhs and like benefit you all help one another don't you
S0192	yeah i mean that's socialism
S0228	so yeah
S0192	have benefit
S0228	but that could be like but in america yeah they they cool so you know a barack obama want an nhs like to have something like the nhs yeah
S0192	yeah
S0228	cos they pay private healthcare don't they
S0192	obama care
S0228	but most er people who be live on the streets in america have lose their home or be bankrupt by try to pay healthcare
S0192	yeah
S0228	so that's why we want to bring it in it's a major thing
S0192	it's terrible trust me all my friends be like you know one single
S0228	they so but people be say he be a communist and and some people be say he be a socialist
S0192	mm
S0228	and they be say they're the same things
S0192	they're pretty similar
S0228	oh yeah i think it's just which way you see people make out communism to be evil
S0192	yeah but i don't think it be
S0228	just cos of the cold war
S0192	yeah
S0228	but i don't think it be i think it's
S0192	well they've be use it as a scapegoat to go to war with some countries for so long it's the it's the the universal threat
S0228	yeah but now they use now they use islam for extreme now extreme islam as an excuse

S0192	looser like
S0228	do you ever have a proper
S0192	yeah yeah you get to see it that way
S0228	just
S0192	oh don't smell it whatever you do
S0228	sound more like an elephant horn
S0192	sound like a rid horn
S0228	a horn
S0228	it's get enough to do it
S0228	you've gotta do circular breathe
S0192	i can't do circular breathe i use to be able to play better than i can now but
S0228	apparently it's you can practice with a glass of water
S0192	yeah or just with a straw
S0228	mm
S0192	there's a couple of other instrument in there
S0228	be there
S0192	yeah there's a rain maker somewhere
S0228	mm
S0192	i dunno if this be go to be alright actually i'm gonna
S0228	mate it's fine there's no pressure
S0192	well i wasn't try to cook anything amaze i be try to use up ingredients i wanna cook you a rendang
S0228	a what
S0192	a rendang it's an indonesian slash malaysian curry it's the best it's the best curry in the world i'm convince of it it's like beef chunk you high fry them to like sear them and then i use tamarind kaffir lime lemongrass erm a bite of brown sugar go quite well in it as well that's the only time i add sugar as well i cook sometime with curry but you like you add a lot of coconut cream to it and then cook it really really low for about four hours until right at the end there's like no sauce leave it's just like a really thick dark black paste on it or like a kind of dark brown almost reddy sometimes it's really sweet for curry it's really really good
S0228	yeah
S0192	and then like erm turn it up really high right at the end to like caramelise it in the beef fat erm or the lamb if you have it
S0228	yeah
S0192	it's really really good it's like the best curry in the world
S0228	sound nice
S0192	it's hard to find a restaurant that do it well but like i pick up a recipe and it's my favourite
S0228	be it spicy
S0192	no not really it's get quite a few red chillies in it
S0228	yeah
S0192	but maybe the ones that
S0228	so it's get coconut in it
S0192	yeah so that tone it down quite a bite
S0228	that'll be why it's nice then
S0192	it's like it's get a spice it's get a lot of cleave in it and a lot of cardamom in it and a lot of cinnamon so it give it a different like flavour
S0228	i wanna grow some er cardamom plant
S0192	yeah
S0228	i try them it's hard to germinate
S0192	i mean er cardamom and like norwegian cardamom and lemon cake they're quite good they're
S0228	i be just think man if anyone listen to this tape record there's go to be like proper talk about organic live
S0192	yeah
S0228	then like us blow on these instrument then you go on about curry
S0192	yeah
S0228	it's gonna be a weird weird
S0192	yeah
S0228	it'll be like godwin listen to that listen to the tape godwin
S0192	i'll show you some later that i've get of my family it's weird i've get like five hours already they pay me pretty well to do it
S0228	do they
S0192	yeah it's like eighteen pound an hour
S0228	no that's alright
S0192	to record
S0228	no yeah
S0192	on that like i have to do more work on top of it and like think about stuff and like it's possible this record won't be use if there's too much background noise
S0228	mm
S0192	and stuff i've i try to record in the car and i try to record outside and it's like too windy
S0228	yeah
S0192	the car's get like a constant hum sound in the back and i be cook with today and i be listen to it again any time that we turn on the tap
S0228	mm
S0192	kind of make it like it's unclear and i think that they can't really use it for the the corpus
S0228	yeah
S0192	so i have to like i've get some edit software to like cut out bits and like do whatever i think that's alright
S0228	i wonder how they make this like carve the the centre
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0228	it's one whole bite of wood
S0192	yeah it's a big crazy
S0228	like they must have drill up here they've just cut it into a block then drill all the way through then just actually i imagine it's quite easy if you've get the tool
S0192	yeah
S0228	but to do it by hand it would be well hard
S0192	thing be it's not authentic i didn't buy it from bolivia i don't know if it actually come from bolivia or if it's just from some shop
S0228	that's cool man
S0192	mm
S0228	it wouldn't be that hard to make that
S0192	no get some random shit i've get so many cds
S0228	it would be harder to get the right angle for that
S0192	so many cds
S0192	do the trill
S0228	i don't think i'm blow it right
S0192	yeah yeah you be
S0228	yes but when i touch this one it make no difference so if i hold down the blue
S0192	yeah it's not great
S0192	i think that's cos you have to add one after the other
S0228	oh right oh that one make sense
S0192	yeah cos otherwise there's too much air come out
S0192	you see
S0192	it's not very good
S0192	erm yeah as i say
S0192	i'm not sure if i'll have to cut this out though it might be like the record doesn't have enough talk
S0228	oh sorry mate
S0192	no no that's fine
S0228	see i get in i be get into my tribe mode mate
S0192	it be good
S0228	i be imagine be an apache just
S0228	out there
S0192	take it away
S0228	take it away mate
S0192	yeah
S0228	get my groove on oh er
S0192	yeah so i'm lucky to have get the job though because obviously i need a job when i be do my degree and i don't really you know to find a job where i don't actually need to do
S0228	much
S0192	not much
S0192	i don't you know no i don't need to go for interview i don't need to go out i don't need to be worry about i can do it on my own hours or whatever i've just get to meet people i can see it get difficult to continue do it and i come up with a good idea like go into old people's home cos like old people love talk so
S0228	it's mate as i talk to you now
S0192	old people's home yeah i could just go and see people
S0228	or a pub
S0192	yeah a pub a pub might be a bite noisy
S0228	yeah
S0192	or do
S0228	yeah
S0192	i need to get good on my edit software but yeah it's pretty useful mate i hope this taste alright so i hope it do
S0228	be that with a moustache
S0192	do he have a moustache
S0228	yeah there
S0192	yeah he do
S0228	yeah for movember cheer mate which one's mine mate there's load there
S0192	whichever
S0228	whichever
S0192	yeah
S0228	i'll sit over here
S0192	eat what you can and eat what you can't
S0228	there's load mate to keep you go
S0192	right i'm gonna do something
S0228	do what
S0192	hang on no talk might be good to keep it go actually
S0228	but erm cos naga chillies i think be mean to be the hottest aren't they
S0192	oh it be a bite spicy

S0192	yeah that's in india isn't it
S0228	yeah their chillies be really fuck hot

S0228	on gordon ramsay when they be sort of they put them in their eye
S0192	it's next to nagipoor and up near shimla and quite so it's not too far from like bengal bangladesh i think
S0228	yeah it's like the north isn't it stuff in the north yeah my parent still like it quite fiery
S0192	mm some bits of india be be have load of sausages since i've come back
S0228	yeah
S0192	don't get sausages in korea

S0192	no
S0228	i haven't even have a sausage actually for age
S0192	yeah
S0228	yeah
S0192	it's good
S0228	i normally squeeze the meat and turn it into something else
S0192	yeah you can make meatballs out of it hello there mate i've never stuff pepper with mash potato before
S0228	no it be a bite different why don't you have
S0192	okay yeah i just think why not and stuff it with like rice and shit
S0228	maybe you could have grate the in
S0192	yeah
S0228	with cheese in it
S0192	mm

S0192	my brother doesn't have dairy or something so i couldn't he eat his earlier
S0228	oh mate do your brother like proper stick to a workout sort of thing
S0192	no i don't think it's that i think he just have a bad stomach or something when he eat it
S0228	oh right you know what i mean

S0228	oh right
S0192	he think he's not sure
S0228	mm might have it slightly
S0192	he's just try to avoid it to see so i couldn't add cheese into it
S0228	apparently a lot of people have like problems with gluten but they just don't realise it it can just give you a bloat or upset stomach and
S0192	yeah for he have have a bad stomach
S0228	that's why people like go on or erm they rave on about it
S0192	yeah
S0228	you just don't get that bloat feel from eat fuck white bread or something or load of carbs like rice
S0192	yeah it's definitely a good idea to i think i have to put this here so it doesn't get all the like vibrations from the yeah this be for like er linguistics research
S0228	yeah yeah
S0192	i tell you what i'd really to do sean with travel man if i could get involve with some research into some pidgin or creole language in some random part of africa or you know some fuck papua new guinea or something it would be

S0228	a fusion of italian and indian
S0192	yeah be that be that a bad thing
S0228	you could just say middle eastern you know
S0192	yeah well turkish i think it's just celery carrot erm onions garlic
