S0037	that's an
S0115	if you if you cut off the bottom bite it look like a like a bass clef
S0037	yeah that's true with the dot yeah be it even play anything or be just the quiet bite of the thing
S0115	no this be radio three man radio three often just doesn't do anything
S0037	just silence
S0115	yeah because in music silence silence be more important than noise
S0037	i know listen hang on some background pip but
S0115	probably yeah probably don't wanna put it really high in case it sort of blast at you
S0037	no cos then next time it'll be
S0115	but we we could leave it on uh three for a bite yeah cos it's sort of
S0037	what do nightwaves mean
S0115	uh i have no idea
S0037	but the thing be i'll forget and i'll have turn this up really loud and then it'll be like duh duh duh like really blast
S0115	uh it's it's radio isn't it so yeah that would be that would be funny um so we decide not to listen to the german comedian
S0037	well
S0115	um because
S0037	he sound okay but i wasn't convince he be really german
S0115	no um
S0037	maybe he be maybe that's really insult
S0115	no i think he be german um
S0037	his accent be funny but then again i suppose like if he's be live in different place like your accent's funny
S0115	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah uh yours be as well but
S0037	no
S0115	uh for different um
S0037	different kind of read of the word funny
S0115	well no yeah um
S0037	but like nothing's happen this isn't even i if
S0115	oh it will it will you just have to you just have to have patience
S0037	like if you be try to tune into radio three like how would you even find it
S0115	how d'you because it's it's nothing like the the the the normal ones have noise don't they and and like if you be in between then it hiss doesn't it
S0037	oh you mean like crrrrr yeah
S0115	hiss but when you get three when you hear nothing then you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's a channel that spend a lot of time do nothing you know what i mean
S0037	i be think of get like
S0115	but three they they get massive you know bandwidths haven't they uh the bbc ones be be be really quite easy to receive cos they have like quite big bits
S0037	have they do i tell you i be look at like buy a um um a wind up solar power radio that's also a torch that's also a usb charger
S0115	oh yeah um that would i i'd like to
S0037	think it sound pretty fantastic although i don't know how good the sound'll be
S0115	um be it be it uh do you say digital or analog
S0037	you can get digital ones but they're quite expensive
S0115	no no i don't want digital radio that's uh
S0037	oh why
S0115	uh the um tuny ones be better than digital ones
S0037	be they
S0115	cos you get more precision
S0037	do you
S0115	yeah oh no i mean um sorry uh no i mean like digital as in like that you tap in you type in the uh
S0037	what
S0115	you type in the frequency
S0037	um
S0115	that's not the same as digital
S0037	no
S0115	transmission yeah sorry yeah yeah
S0037	no you what i it's get a twiddly it's get like a it's get
S0115	i didn't expect it to be uh i didn't expect it to be like that high tech that it that it'd be like it's wind up digital radio although i dunno maybe that's possible yeah
S0037	no you can get them i think you can yeah
S0115	yeah no i just mean um cos i have a short wave one and and i don't know if this one be short wave
S0037	i dunno there's all different ones i haven't buy anything yet i be just look
S0115	um yeah if you've get a short cos i have a short wave one but i get one where you type in the frequencies and um
S0037	ah right
S0115	uh yeah it be nowhere near as good cos it didn't have the the like the the precise um ability to change
S0037	yeah
S0037	oh we're go
S0115	yeah i mean three's sort of the most uh
S0037	the most what
S0115	i guess it's sort of be it like the most highbrow of the four
S0037	i dunno i mean it depend what you think of hig brow be like
S0115	whereas radio one be the be the most hip and then radio two be like yeah for sort of middle age people um
S0037	for like yeah
S0115	uh more radio two's more sort of just relax sort of cheerful happy uh music and then
S0037	terry wogan y but he's not it any more be he but it's kind of like dentist's music isn't it it's like what you would hear in the dentist's it's nothing radical
S0115	uh yeah yeah yeah it's easy go music and then the ones be more hard hit you know like more um
S0037	it's just sort of yeah and three obviously
S0115	yeah three's i think it's quite highbrow but it's it's music sort of highbrow music and then four's sort of yeah news and uh
S0037	it's more like discussions and stuff though isn't it like
S0115	yeah talk yeah and it's quite popular amongst posh people i think to listen to um
S0037	mm oh sorry i think i've get this on a bite loud
S0115	yeah so we we'll put it on then uh you know since we've be talk about it uh
S0037	four
S0115	yeah cos they do have a bite of comedy on uh four don't they
S0037	yeah i think so oh it's melvin what's he discuss
S0115	yeah in fact
S0037	the emergence of geology as a scientific discipline
S0115	um
S0037	aw that sound awful
S0115	no it's it's consider it's him like he annoy me most when he talk about
S0037	i don't like him i don't like him
S0115	he annoy me most when he talk about religion but now he's like
S0037	no no no he annoy me most when talk about class he do a whole thing write a whole book about it about how now class isn't
S0115	oh yeah there there aren't different there aren't different class any more he say
S0037	he be say about how class isn't define by like your socio economic situation it's define by what you like
S0115	well okay so like
S0037	like some people like opera it's just stupid
S0115	so like the queen and like a tramp
S0037	yeah
S0115	could be in the same class
S0037	if they both like horse race yeah
S0115	or something
S0115	or um
S0037	i don't know if it's i maybe oversimplify but that be his argument
S0115	well no i'm just say
S0037	so
S0115	if he's talk about the the old class but i mean work class uh but well they've have different type of class but no there be clearly different there be clearly different class and you know culture culture and class i mean they they it's about social network isn't it i mean
S0037	well
S0115	there be clearly set of people that be detach from others like you know they live in
S0037	yeah
S0115	like if you're in the sort of uh in the urban uh urban sort of inner city then then that's gonna be that's a certain kind of class isn't it and then if you're in sort of a a decline uh estate thing then that's another sort of like a but it's not urban so that's a that's a different sort of class and different
S0037	yeah i mean
S0115	but yeah it's it's culture yeah i mean but i don't he he's just he just specialize in sell book doesn't he i mean
S0037	well i dunno if i like him that much i think he's a bite smarmy
S0115	like you be say he say something it's just it's just a sensational thing to say that that if you're say that we now have the the urban poor but we also have the the more decay uh estate poor
S0037	decay
S0115	decay estate like
S0037	sorry i be think about like their teeth or something
S0115	no uh like if you have the poor from say like an estate in doncaster or something then if you have the poor from more urban um from from the inner city of london
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	or i mean the the the cities the urban city poor have things in common i suppose like
S0037	yeah
S0115	if you're from the inner city of birmingham or nottingham or leicester or london then you probably have things in common
S0037	yeah yeah yeah
S0115	but i guess what what he would what he's try to say be that people with the same amount of money have different culture and not part of a single class but then i don't know if there ever if it be ever that simple anyway
S0037	no i don't think it be i think he's
S0115	yeah cos he
S0037	i read a really interest um interview with him where like reviewer be like just pick hole at him like say hey but you say this d'you really think this and yeah it be just he'd sort of be quite spiky about it do i show it yeah
S0115	oh um i think you might have uh might have show me i think it be the or be it the guardian uh complain about his class thing
S0037	yeah it be quite funny
S0115	clearly there be rich people there's an elite there's there's obviously in britain in in britain we've get i dunno who that be
S0037	alright trenton you do it's the swim boat race swim guy
S0115	oh right uh
S0037	trenton
S0115	so he i mean now now we can't no offence to him you know it's like can't even you can't even mention the elite any more people will just accuse you of like spoil a boat race or whatever i mean what's the point
S0037	doesn't matter i be only tease
S0115	uh there's um there's a global elite there's there's aristocracy in in different countries um and i guess they they sort of blow into the global elite then there's you know then there's wealthy people
S0037	yeah
S0115	then there's then there's sort of medium and then there's you know then and then there be the poor aren't there and then there be the there be the tramp
S0037	well i don't know i don't suppose i'm that interest in
S0115	and you know it's not that easy to get from one you know from a tramp to the global super rich um because of the disconnectivity you know like
S0037	well i know people be bear into different
S0115	because you you you don't have that many great influence in your social network or whatever
S0037	no i know i know people be bear into different things
S0115	and you don't have the money uh at your disposal you know to to just to just afford to make mistake you know
S0037	but yeah
S0115	if you're rich you you make a few mistake and you get a maybe you get a
S0037	yeah
S0115	crash a car or something you know
S0037	yeah your your family bail you our or whatever
S0115	you get bail you get massively bail out you get
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh you you get the you get live you know you get like nine live and you get three three strike and you're out sort of thing but i mean and whereas like if you're younger then obviously
S0115	if you haven't get money obviously then you know i mean everybody uh have a life in which to make something of it but if you're in a different class that's gonna make it a lot harder or easier depend on what class you're in
S0037	yeah it be but i think you should you've gotta do your own thing though haven't you you've gotta do what you think's the right thing and i think you can't make too much of it either way like i i think that everyone should have the same opportunities and i don't think you should be proud or ashamed of what your you know what your situation be whether you what your what your race be whether you're a woman or a man whether you live from this whether you're in this place whether you be bear here or there or everywhere like it doesn't matter i think everyone should have the same
S0115	it doesn't matter where you're bear
S0037	i well i i don't think it should i don't think you should be
S0115	it shouldn't but it do though doesn't it
S0037	well yes perhaps but i don't think you should be like um embarrass about it or i think i think you should just sort of
S0115	shouldn't be embarrass no you shouldn't have to be embarrass
S0037	but i think
S0115	no or you shouldn't you shouldn't be embarrass but
S0037	no i'm not say i'm not say elitism doesn't exist
S0115	um
S0037	i'm i'm sure it certainly do but
S0115	i guess in in that strong sense it would mean choose between people base on their background or or connections um
S0037	but i think you know you've just gotta
S0115	so it's relate to nepotism i suppose isn't it a bite
S0037	but you've gotta do your best to to do to get what you you can to do what you can do i think there's no point in feel sorry for yourself just if you don't like it change it like
S0115	well no no obviously you know you can't achieve anything by by feel sorry for yourself that's an important uh lesson that we that you know
S0037	mm
S0115	we we saw the yeah we saw uh the the debate yesterday which wasn't a very on um
S0037	with billy bragg
S0115	on ten o'clock live wasn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	but it wasn't yeah you have the guy from uh make in chelsea who uh go to eton and you have uh some daily mail person who start from a comprehensive and go to oxford and then you have billy bragg who didn't get any good qualifications but become famous by just by be a singer uh and political activist but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	um yeah so you get the you get the get the feel though that billy bragg yeah be feel a bite extra sorry for himself or or at least uh uh put put put put put across a defeatist opinion maybe but
S0037	i do like a bite of billy bragg i think you can never say like
S0115	on the other hand you know then i mean the eton guy be nice because i mean that's what that's what you pay the you know eleven grand a term for or whatever
S0037	be that how much it be
S0115	uh no i don't know how much it be but uh i i just
S0037	it's a lot of money innit
S0115	but if you if you go to eton then you're come out be very sort of
S0037	i dunno though
S0115	you're you're gonna have a lot of skills at at at uh you know those they're make in eton they're make prime minister and ceos and uh army high rank army officer and people who and uh
S0037	yeah but i think i dunno i'm i'm not the sort of person that even give that a think really i just think oh that's good for them like i'm not bother
S0115	yeah yeah i think i think that's that be i think you maybe haven't give it quite as much as of a think that that could've you know that could've um
S0037	yeah cos i'm not i'm interest in my life and what i can do just think like ah if they wanna be the prime minister okay like i don't wanna be the prime minister so
S0115	yeah but this what it's all about so like i think it's about uh connections yeah i mean
S0037	what everybody else in the whole world's do like generally like they can you know obviously i be interest in world affairs and stuff but to a degree i'm not
S0115	but um
S0037	maybe i'm just not like a
S0115	yeah i mean i suppose you don't want like a massive amount do you you're not you don't want to be you know rich you don't wanna be rich and you don't wanna be powerful do you and you don't wanna be famous so you don't wanna be an influence of that sort
S0037	well my well no no i i suppose i don't
S0115	that's that's not mean to to be insult cos i don't i don't know if i wanna be any of those either
S0037	no i'm not insult i'm not insult i mean i suppose i just want like the things that i suppose i i suppose i'm just a normal person i just wanna have a nice time and do the things i like do and be with the people i that i want to be with like that's doesn't everyone wanna do that i mean
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	i've get no i've get no like i don't wanna be the head of the company that i work for or the the king of the world or anything like that no i mean
S0115	well but obviously some people have to do that um but i suppose it's sort of a feel of um
S0037	yeah of course they do but i suppose i just don't really don't really fancy that
S0115	i think about elitism um it it basically mean you you're but you're not you're you're some unfairness be go on
S0037	i know favour people from a certain yeah
S0115	that's that's what i'm talk about so
S0037	well i'm not i'm against unfairness
S0115	i mean yeah well i think everyone's against unfairness so i mean and uh and you know you can't really argue in favour of unfairness
S0037	well no
S0115	uh you'd have to change the you'd have to change the definition i mean and you'd have to sort of say it's not about unfairness it's about
S0037	alright smarty pant
S0115	it's you know you can't prevent a rich person from from live their life in its full glory of richness
S0037	well they should if they want to
S0115	you know cos that would be unfair but on the other hand you know their life i mean it's it's paradoxical isn't it but uh a lot of people have complain about elitism it it's frequently complain about from from a lot of different i i one person who complain about it be rupert murdoch
S0037	yeah
S0115	he so often complain about the snobbery he hat the snobbery
S0037	yeah that's what he say he open it for be that window open
S0115	no he uh he hat what he call and this be partly just you know it's purely
S0037	yeah
S0115	rhetoric from him he be bear into a very wealthy background but you know and he inherit a newspaper but he he he would often talk about the the elitism of uh british of british establishment cos he go to oxford
S0037	mhm yeah
S0115	and also of uh of um of the bbc as well he he's always hat the bbc
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh and he's claim to have hat the you know the sort of posh uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	english people who dominate the bbc in the olden days
S0037	fleet street and stuff
S0115	uh the old boys and everything he he come from australia or whatever so he hat so he he be often talk talk about that um that's similar to
S0037	be you stick up for rupert murdoch cos that's massively out of character move for for you
S0115	well no uh well uh obviously it's about whether or not there be elitism i mean presumably we're talk about in britain
S0037	yeah
S0115	um bear in mind what what murdoch's do i guess he's prove that he's actually become the elite himself so
S0037	mhm
S0115	uh uh be it be it one of those things the ironic thing of you know you you topple the bully but in so do you you have to be come you have to become the bully uh but animal farm be another thing about that uh
S0037	you have to be a bully yourself yeah but i read a interest thing about um about the you know the boat race thing and like someone be say you know alright he be try to topple elitism but like actually those people who row in the who row in the boat race aren't like necessarily these elite like not all rowers be from public school any more i mean there be only like two well there be only one in the cambridge boat british guy and there be only a couple in the oxford boat they're just like they're international athletes they're not really they're not really like
S0115	yeah
S0037	public schoolboy rowers be they i mean i mean i know it wasn't a target it wasn't target at those rowers it be target at oxford and cambridge but um not everyone who go to oxford and cambridge be posh be they just most of them i suppose
S0115	uh no no well it be say that uh that they only use to take from um from uh private school but they've expand now anyway i mean i'm sure they take a substantial percentage of uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but it be point out uh i think it be john prescott mention some some percentage about you know the the private school produce a a very high percentage of uh
S0037	mm
S0115	you know so it's more about it's more about the school than the university by the time you're at university you know you you've you've be you've sort of grow up and you've have your upbringing but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but at um yeah so private the private school produce the the the great majority of of top uh british job uh and that be um you know that could be interpret by some people to be
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh elitism because before you've go to private school you may well not have show that level of uh skill
S0037	but i think the problem be in the in the school system though isn't it like why people wanna send their kid to private school why the normal school aren't good enough or do you think that that people would always just send them to private school even if the school be really good
S0115	uh some people do would use a state school if it's a good one yeah
S0037	yeah
S0115	um the the problem be uh there's a fear of um the children mix mix with the wrong ones so they they wouldn't wanna send them
S0037	be ruffians
S0115	but also if you if you
S0037	end up down the park drink cider
S0115	if you're from a if you're from a successful family
S0037	yeah
S0115	then uh you you you want your child children to be um successful so um that that would mean you'd wanna go to a successful school where the majority of them you have to pay full but but um but but not all i mean that's i think that be one of the big uh issue but yeah cos on the debate they didn't really get
S0037	yeah
S0115	i don't think they really discuss the sort of like the the hardest the the sort of strongest arguments about it like i think the main the main point be if private school give that private school provide the most top job in the uk uh it's a shame that that you'd have to pay to get that quality because that exclude people who don't have access to that money from get into that thing
S0037	yeah well i dunno i dunno if you're really exclude from anything if you be the sort of person that want to do that i think you you you'll always find a way though
S0115	so they the the the answer be uh uh oh yeah but as a child you mean you mean to get into public
S0037	i dunno i just think i think part of it's in
S0115	no but the problem be that the public school be produce that high percentage and and therefore you could help it by get more uh talented children from in freely into public school
S0037	yeah
S0115	use scholarships
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	so you would want more scholarships there at that entry point at that age eleven entry point or whatever
S0037	yeah
S0115	but if you're say that that doesn't matter uh we'll we'll we'll just forget we'll forget the school bite we'll just go from the age sixteen or age eighteen entry point and then and then say so we could improve all the school as well yeah
S0037	i dunno because i just think like i dunno i just no i i i suppose that's not what i'm say what i'm say be like i think that sometimes it's just in you like if if you're the sort of person who want to do something then you'll do it like i don't know how much the school count surely not everyone who go to a public school come out with a good job surely not everyone who go to a public school end up do something good i'm sure load of them end up do normal things like i'm sure there's load of people who go to private school who be just do job that that like anyone's do you know i think you've gotta it's gotta be in you to to do to be you've gotta be drive and like you can't really teach that can you i mean
S0115	right
S0037	you've gotta want to do it haven't you
S0115	um
S0037	if you're a kid you're a naughty kid i you'll still be a naughty kid if you go to public school won't you
S0115	oh yeah but um you'll come out of it with you'll come out of it with like that that on your you you're gonna have a hell of a lot easy job get get a job than someone who's naughty who's go to a comprehensive um
S0037	if you're a hard work kid yeah maybe well maybe yeah well
S0115	but uh if if you if someone see the name eton then they're likely to think oh this be an eton kid
S0037	mm
S0115	they would just assume you well if his if his result aren't that great but
S0037	yeah
S0115	but his family must be rich and therefore you know it's good to have someone from a rich family you know work here i uh
S0037	d'you want anything from the fridge i don't know i don't know if i think that though maybe i'm just like
S0115	well i think you're partly just be the devil's advocate or
S0037	well partly yeah but i mean partly i just don't think that i just think sort of well i suppose if i'm totally honest partly i don't care
S0115	yeah i mean that's not a great argument uh it's you've not you've not win a debate with the i don't care argument
S0037	no it's not a great i'm not no i'm not say i've win
S0115	you you've really you've really have us think that you you be gonna be weak but you've you pull it out at the last minute
S0037	no i don't mean that i just mean like
S0115	you've settle the debate's close
S0037	i suppose i suppose what i'm say be i haven't give it enough think because i've never need to
S0115	i'm go home the the the i haven't give it enough think argument
S0037	well
S0115	second only to the i don't care argument as absolute
S0037	maybe i'm just not a deep thinker uh maybe i'm just like
S0115	well that's the these be the top ten top ten not top ten chat up line some of them be also chat up line the top ten like the top ten debate win line
S0037	hedge hedge no
S0115	uh i'm not much of a deep thinker
S0037	alright
S0115	no that's that's alright i mean
S0037	you're take the piss out of us i understand but all i'm try to say be that i suppose it's hard for me to have like
S0115	no you know what i mean no i'm just say
S0037	but all i'm try to say be that i suppose it's hard for me to have like you've obviously spend like git hours think about this and i really haven't
S0115	well i haven't
S0037	bet you have
S0115	like i'm not bitter
S0037	you do
S0115	about anything especially not elitism or whatever
S0037	no but you have obviously give it some extensive think and what i'm try to say be that like maybe i'm just maybe i'm just in me own little world like but all me family's like this as well me dad's like this he's get like a a sort of grasp on what's happen but not not necessarily like like if me dad see this thing that on the telly that's happen in like homs or something he'd think oh that's horrible anyway i'm gonna just go and shop now and i'm a bite more like that like i think oh that's really bad but then i don't think so i'm gonna read about it and research it and and start a protest or anything i'd i suppose i'm just not that
S0037	like yeah no i'm not say violence like i'm not
S0037	i'm sympathetic i'm sympathetic towards bad things that be happen to people but i i suppose i'm just not move to like to do anything or like do that make me sound really crap
S0115	yeah no no it's it's uh no i be just imagine what if if if you know david mitchell or or uh you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	sir robin day or whatever the dimbleby or whatever the you know one of those barrister y type debate holders be be there and uh
S0037	well i'm obviously
S0115	you know dimbleby do question time doesn't he
S0037	yeah
S0115	i think sir robin day use to do it you know who sir robin day's probably the classic sort of uh
S0037	i know you're grill us
S0115	kind of toff that that rupert murdoch be complain about but uh but yeah so if if if if david mitchell be here you know he he you know what kind of a what kind of a smartarse he be and
S0037	well if i be go on question time i'd have go through me argument i suppose well i know i mean you you haven't be too dissimilar really but uh
S0115	no i'm just like
S0037	i suppose what i mean be like i'm more concern with my immediate situation like my little life uh and just like
S0115	yeah uh uh okay uh no i just i suppose yeah yeah no to resolve uh well you can't you can't end these sort of debate can you but uh obviously to keep fight you have to keep dig out more information and it would it would get ridiculous you
S0037	yeah
S0115	i mean you could find yourself have spend many hours research research social network theory and research statistics of of urban you know all these demographics and like standard of live in cities and
S0037	i dunno i've never be much of a debater i just think sometimes it's like i don't know maybe i'm just i'm more practical i'd rather do something than like
S0115	be
S0037	i dunno i think ever since i finish me me thesis like i'm i'm just totally off any sort of like that research any about anything i'm just like and down tool and like i i'm just not motivate any more to do any of that
S0115	yeah sorry yeah oh yeah no no i be uh i mean i wasn't try to you know it be just we be just talk and you know we be just talk and i just think it be a it be a bite of a a cop out to say well actually i don't really i don't really care about it
S0037	oh no no i know don't worry i'm not gonna no it be funny actually i haven't really think about this very much
S0115	um
S0037	well
S0115	well i think uh if you yeah give it you know try one of the other ones cos we didn't what's radio four extra
S0037	um it's just more talk probably
S0115	cos that would be interest cos i i mean we've hear one extra which be which be exactly what you'd expect it to like it's one with a faster beat and louder uh music but uh
S0037	oh it's a play
S0115	but four extra's interest um
S0037	it's a play
S0115	uh
S0037	it's a play it's an episode of a play
S0115	oh i couldn't no alright it's uh but anyway like privilege uh go across the uh go across what yeah basically this debate be be be the uh uh it's it's part of the uh sort of capitalism marxism debate isn't it so
S0037	pardon me yeah i dunno i feel like i do feel a bite ignorant sometimes when you you you crack out all these like facts and i'm like um
S0115	um which be uh which isn't like a bite usually i dunno uh i think you you you can come out with some some well what facts do i
S0037	i don't think about it enough i don't think about the outside world
S0115	but i didn't really say facts though a lot of it be just like hearsay i could've just make that up like
S0037	no but i wouldn't know would i that's the point
S0115	no no you come out with a lot of things like about bucket thing uh
S0037	oh wow
S0115	that's practical anyway uh
S0037	uhuh
S0115	yeah no it be practical i mean that's why there be a lot of people like social entrepreneurs or whatever who be try to actually practically like do something to help people who be um the yeah the typical intelligent kid with parent or from a poor background like there be people who be tie to to actually to to do that uh i think uh
S0037	yeah no i know i mean i suppose i just um i've just i'm just like a little content little sort of budgie i just get on me bike and go to work and do me work and come home and hang about with you and then i don't really i don't really bother meself like if i've get some free time
S0115	well that's that's really yeah you you're not from the kind of the kind of background where you would be you know your your your cousin's in like your cousin's like the like a like a
S0037	not at all no in eton
S0115	i know
S0037	don't even lie about it you know it's true
S0115	uh yeah your your your your cousin's in like do an you know work in the pentagon or something and
S0037	no
S0115	you know you get another one who's like you know a beijing entrepreneur and you've get another one who's like uh an olympic swimmer or some another one be like
S0037	no that's not true although you never know they're all still baby aren't they they're all still they're all still little ones maybe they will be at the pentagon and at eton and uh olympic swimmers who know
S0115	um
S0037	but no i agree and like me parent aren't like that be they like that's when when your parent come over they're like so
S0115	that's i mean it it make it seem that class be a you know like
S0037	what do you how have you find what be your thoughts on the situation in syria and i'm like what
S0037	and then when i go to my parent they're like d'you want some pringles
S0115	well that's that's because no but i my parent just just like they they have the sort of
S0037	d'you wanna go to the pub your brother's have a baby
S0115	well that happen that that be generally class less isn't it have have baby um
S0037	yeah
S0115	boris johnson's get like four hasn't he so uh
S0037	well i be read a thing actually in the guardian also that
S0115	he's he's undoubtedly a member of the global elite if anyone ever be uh
S0037	i be read a thing about yeah about how like it's a sign of like
S0115	affluence if you have load of baby
S0037	um yeah if you have more children
S0115	or catholicism or uh
S0037	yeah or poverty
S0115	um british british um
S0037	it's it's at the both end it's like the either end isn't like
S0115	think but not not all not all poor people have load of children it's just think it's certain culture certain group maybe
S0037	i don't know yeah
S0115	um i think it i mean we associate it with i know you hear of like them sort of people on
S0037	your your dad's a four isn't he
S0115	well i know i just hear stories about like a family with uh seven kid that be make a massive amount of money on benefit
S0037	benefit yeah like thirteen baby
S0115	and i think that it's it's affluent to have a lot yeah because obviously you're spread uh you spread your your family and that that include not just your genes but obviously you're spread your uh culture as like your
S0037	yeah
S0115	if you have a family that's successful then obviously the more in it then then it's more likely that there'll be more successful people down the line
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but of
S0037	yeah i read about those two d'you remember like you know those conjoin twin chang and eng like the first one of the first ones
S0115	um
S0037	the first report conjoin twin
S0115	why
S0037	they be from well what siam but you know wherever it be now
S0115	um thailand
S0037	um muugh um and then they go to america
S0115	might not be
S0037	it be yeah and they marry two sisters and they have like one have ten kid and one have eleven kid
S0115	oh right
S0037	and every year like they have like annual reunions and there be like seven thousand people go cos they all have like they have ten kid who have ten kid who have ten kid
S0115	wow that's uh
S0037	they sleep in a bed for four i read read the page
S0115	like all ten of them
S0037	well one no them two and their wive
S0115	two what
S0037	they be conjoin the twin
S0115	oh oh right oh so oh yeah okay and they be never separate
S0037	yeah but then they start like the wive start get angry even though they be sisters and so they set up two separate households and they have to spend like three and a half days at one and three and a half days at the other
S0115	so strange no i you know here you come with like these these these be the facts now you're come out with these these crazy facts like about
S0037	i know but actually they be only no i read it from i read it um and i be read about easter cos i be read about biddenden cake do that be on the front page of wikipedia do you read it
S0115	yeah i do actually uh
S0037	there you go so i get to it from them conjoin twin
S0115	oh right
S0037	but they be say now like they be only kind of very cosmetically conjoin like they have they have two livers that be but they be fuse together but they could've be easily
S0115	like oh yeah
S0037	like now if they be bear now they would've just like part them straight away
S0115	yeah right
S0037	so
S0115	right i see
S0037	but anyway yeah they have millions of ancestors but i just wonder like wouldn't it be weird
S0115	do they really because some people say it wasn't
S0037	well i say they all have ten they have ten children each
S0115	oh yeah oh you mean the the siamese ones not the not the biddenden ones oh yeah
S0037	yeah no well they think that's make up don't they
S0115	that's a legend isn't it yeah
S0037	but um wouldn't it be good like if you could like if go back to your great great great grandfathers and like then like amass all your relatives like there'd be so many people that you didn't know
S0115	yeah well we we be i mean we be look at uh at our uh like bite of our family background um
S0037	yeah
S0115	we realize that uh that that if you the further back in time you
S0037	it's totally different now isn't it like everything can be record
S0115	that it at a certain point you know each generation the the number of relatives would increase
S0037	yeah
S0115	um by a certain amount and then there would be an exponential increase i suppose so um it as you go back the further back in time you go the the more relatives you you'd have
S0037	you'd have now yeah it's true
S0115	uh the higher proportion of the globe would be relate to you i think
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh although no wait a minute i be try to uh
S0037	no that's right like the further back the more people be relate
S0115	yeah i i think that make sense although but that's actually sound that sound like that sound contradictory because
S0037	how
S0115	cos if if they're if they're relate back then they'd they'd also be relate forward as well like it depend how direct you're talk about
S0037	there be more people now what d'you mean
S0115	like like um
S0037	well we be all relate aren't we i mean of course
S0115	no yeah i mean i mean like direct ancestors so like
S0037	you mean like grandparents grandparents grandparents grandparents or
S0115	um if you keep go on back in time yeah you you get to a point where like mass of the proportion of the population at at that point would be your ancestors so
S0037	yeah
S0115	your direct ancestors because of course uh it's basic i mean like obviously i've get two ancestors from the previous generation four from the one above that
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	so it's go up exponentially and sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	um two to the two to the power of two to the power of n isn't it so
S0037	so not count their descendants you mean i be gonna say x
S0115	uh um so twenty generations ago you have two to the power of twenty um ancestors
S0037	yeah
S0115	alive and they have to all be different of course they can't be like i suppose in certain situations maybe there might've be a bite of cross over but
S0037	you don't know no
S0115	uh so you go back no i think it's it's four generations in a hundred years you go back ten thousand years you've get
S0037	i doubt it well it it be then well dunno if it be now i mean
S0115	well i think well say say four four generations four hundred years then that's uh obviously four four thousand would be forty generations
S0037	four what four thousand years yeah
S0115	four forty generations in a thousand years four hundred generations in ten thousand years that's long enough cos that'll get us back to the ice age or whenever
S0037	yeah
S0115	so two to the power of forty how many do i say
S0037	alright this be ridiculous
S0115	don't wait four uh four in a hundred years forty then
S0037	right
S0115	four four in a hundred years forty in a thousand uh four hundred in ten thousand um
S0037	i dunno i've lose the i've the thread
S0115	so yeah four hundred two to the power of four hundred out of the population would've be your uh ancestors
S0037	that's a pretty big number
S0115	but that can't be right because surely there wasn't that many people on the earth
S0037	yeah relate to everyone
S0115	no i mean but there wasn't even that look i don't know how much two to the four hundred be but it sound like it's gonna be bigger than what the population would've be back in the back then
S0037	well
S0115	so it mean like you know what i mean like i dunno what two to the four hundred be but i but i guess it's like it's over like it's over six billion
S0037	mm
S0115	and and there would only have back in them days ten thousand years ago there would only have be like a handful you know like like a few a few million of us
S0037	well i don't know i've lose the thread on the maths
S0115	so technically so almost almost everyone back then would like would've be the ancestor of everybody now
S0037	yeah
S0115	that's but you know there you go so
S0037	well i i'm not sure that's a grind break uh statement
S0115	so yeah you're welcome uh sorry
S0037	everybody then's relate to everybody now
S0115	it's not uh
S0115	no just i'm just try to say it i think you be talk about how everyone's relate to everyone else or or be we not i don't know
S0115	no
S0037	i be talk about have load of ancestors
S0115	no it's just like you that i i suppose it's it's something that i hadn't think of before be be uh be how like how interrelate people actually
S0037	yeah
S0115	be you know um
S0037	yeah i mean well i suppose trace everyone back to a certain point
S0037	single celled organisms or what have you
S0115	what what's it on
S0037	um i think we've go on to smash smash hit non stop um how about mellow magic with sound nice it's what become of the break hearted robson and jerome do this song i think someone like that robson and jerome they be bad
S0115	yeah awful
S0037	although robson green's quite like that fish programme's quite good
S0115	what
S0037	that fish programme's quite good
S0115	oh it's brilliant yeah i think he's a good person but a bad bad pop bad pop artist
S0037	bad singer do you ever watch uh soldier
S0115	so the opposite of david bowie
S0037	yeah think david bowie's a bad person
S0115	no i dunno just make that up
S0037	um do you ever see soldier soldier
S0115	um no no i didn't
S0037	no me mam love it
S0115	it's terrible
S0037	me mam love that and uh london's burn
S0115	and perhaps also heartbeat
S0037	um more of me nana like heartbeat
S0115	right be they not on sort of in succession
S0037	u um well let's think
S0115	sunday night isn't it
S0037	yeah sunday nights
S0115	old sunday nights uh london's burn be on at be at nine till ten or something or eight till nine and then
S0037	yeah we use to watch it so
S0115	heartbeat be like heartbeat be like seven till eight or something on sunday
S0037	well i think heartbeat be on on different days but we have um so we have a live room actually not too dissimilar to this and like the sofa use to be against the wall like this but when like um london's burn and that come on we use to pull the sofa round like right next to the tv and all get on like watch it
S0115	uh what happen in it like
S0037	to what
S0115	what happen in london's burn then
S0037	london's burn be a programme about like uh fire fighters from from uh a particular station
S0115	yeah in the fifties or something
S0037	blackwall i think it be or something like that
S0115	oh be it be it
S0037	it's up to date well up to date then
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	uh i can still picture some of the guy who be in it and that but anyway and then heartbeat well you know heartbeat and then soldier soldier be like a well like a military episodic drama or whatever you would wanna call it i'm not sure there be some good like that be good though at the time i should try and get a dvd for me mam bet she'd like it
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	for christmas
S0115	i just uh i never watch any of them sunday ones
S0037	no
S0115	but
S0037	well we use to come back from me dad's on a sunday
S0115	apart from like well i do watch um because of what my parent and specifically my mum well my dad only really watch the news
S0037	yeah
S0115	and my mum didn't really watch those sort of soap things but she do watch uh murder you know any detective type thing
S0037	yeah well you can't can't beat a bite of murder she write
S0115	so any like frost or yeah i mean that's more that's more afternoon isn't it that
S0037	they're timeless those though i i still quite like them yeah it's more like you're off school on the sofa with a duvet
S0115	yeah yeah actually i think i have memories of specifically do that
S0037	me too and go for gold do you watch go for gold
S0115	yeah that with uh yeah with with you know the lunchtime yeah
S0037	with henry kelly sometimes i use to come home
S0115	if you come home from yeah if you come home from lunch and then he'll be on yeah i do that once actually with uh at my nan's uh where it be at
S0037	i use to go home for lunch sometimes
S0115	um it be weird cos it's a different world isn't it um at home and then it feel weird that you're in your house
S0037	i know yeah but only for a short time
S0115	and you've gotta get back to
S0037	i know i use to
S0115	but that's it's a bite like if if you're at work now and then you come back home although that's that's always quite that feel kind of better though
S0037	but it would be the same it be weird though like we only use to get an hour lunch break and it use to take me um on the bus it be like dunno fifteen or twenty minutes on the bus if you get if you get a bus straight away you could get home fifteen fifteen minutes probably but then you only have a half an hour at home and then you've gotta get the bus back but sometimes i use to do it but i remember walk home sometimes and that would take like twenty five minutes and then i'd get home for like ten minutes and walk back seem crazy
S0115	shall we uh
S0037	eh
S0115	move it on from uh but it's funny with music if if if anything turn up
S0037	oh i can't watch alex jam
S0115	you don't have to watch him and you don't really have to listen to him cos he doesn't
S0037	be it his choices or be it his music
S0115	it's his choices it's sort of nineties stuff isn't it i'm just say that cos he's from the nineties and this song's from the nineties so
S0037	he be from the nineties
S0115	he's a man of the nineties
S0037	well that's one way of put it yeah play close attention
S0115	this be undoubtedly undoubtedly rave isn't it
S0037	andrew ask to always use to get q magazine
S0115	oh that's so that's so him it's it's so him
S0037	and uh it's so him isn't it i know so he always use to get q magazine and i'd be like muugh it's rubbish it's rubbish muugh and i be always just go on
S0115	well no no no that's it's rubbish what do what do you get
S0037	i have a real thing about q magazine i hat it like
S0115	oh yeah well me i be sort of
S0037	ah cos he be always just bang on about it and i be like
S0037	no it's stupid like you know when i be really bad like when i look back at meself of how i be
S0115	no i i think a lot of people i know i i be very bad at that you know like take everything seriously
S0037	i use to just if someone like something i would just didn't wanna like it as well like and like if i like a band and i find them and then and then someone else someone else like them as well like you get annoy cos they're not
S0115	oh really oh yeah that's really annoy when people do that actually isn't it yeah yeah why why do yeah why do that but not so much when you're older when you're older it's sort of more
S0037	oh no when not when you're older like you're happy that someone's tell you something or you've find yeah
S0115	you're older it's it's like oh yeah yeah a fellow uh fellow fan of rancid or something
S0037	exactly exactly when you find someone who like the same music it's great when you're when you're a bite older but when you're that sort of school age you just think ah they're my band like i like them you're not allow to like them
S0115	be that something sort of about adolescence or be that just childishness or what
S0037	dunno what well i don't know well i think it's about want to have your own identity yeah be something different like
S0115	be it be it to do with adolescent uh want to be apart yeah
S0037	especially at school where you all have to wear the same thing you all have to do the same thing like maybe it's you know you wanna sort of have a bite of yourself um and i think yeah that's maybe that use to get on me nerve but oh i hat q magazine agh
S0115	no i i suppose i associate it i don't know much about it but i associate it with sort of softer music like um
S0037	yeah use to read all the review and be like oh i'm gonna buy this
S0115	well softer softer band like um like um i suppose well some of the you know some of the sort of britpop stuff but more but also like u2 and
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but or or i suppose maybe a bite of the older stuff i suppose it would have a lot of david bowie stuff
S0037	i didn't buy any i never buy any music magazines really never ever really
S0115	no i
S0037	um in fact i didn't really buy that many magazines
S0115	i sometimes read kerrangs that get give to me
S0037	i like i mean even though like even now i like i like the occasional like bird magazine you know like uh company or like um
S0115	cosmo
S0037	cosmo or glamour or uh well some of the trashier ones like more but i don't buy them every week and i wouldn't buy them every week i just buy them as like a novelty mainly if i'm go on the train somewhere or like do something never really be that into magazines like comics
S0115	no no i i i'm embarrass because the things i'm interest in i'm embarrass to be interest in them or to declare that
S0037	don't be stupid nothing to be embarrass about it's not like you're get like nudist weekly
S0115	can't go go into a get in a shop and buy well but but it's in the shop you know
S0037	you buy new scientist though
S0115	but it's in the shop you know people be people be buy that you know
S0037	i know it's in the shop i know they be but i what i'm say be there's worse things you could buy
S0115	like there's like i've see a lot of strange ones you know but uh also also like you know like like aeroplanes or something
S0037	yeah but buy a a magazine about technology or something that's nothing to be ashamed of yeah but you're not
S0115	cos i be look at some in uh at smith's at the airport and uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh i i though oh yeah i'll pass the time by look at a few title of magazines and yeah it be just like like aeroplane engines or or something like but and then like all you know like vehicle stuff like obviously car stuff and also uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but load of specific stuff that that i just wouldn't like wanna
S0037	lifestyles yeah all the fitness ones
S0115	i'd be interest in a lot of things but i wouldn't necessarily wanna um buy a a thing just about that
S0037	i dunno it'd be interest though sometimes i think sometimes it's good to just
S0115	yeah i saw a few things that be a bite expensive but it be like a like a android thing for for android phone it be like
S0037	yeah you should just buy them
S0115	i think there be two there but it be a book like twenty quid about like android app make or andoid developers' guide or something but
S0037	yeah should just buy them i think like if you see something you want
S0115	but no i think these days with with the internet you really don't need to i dunno
S0037	i dunno i still think there's there's something nice about have like like i'm toy with the idea of get an uh uh a kindle um but there be something nice like you know the book that i buy especially cos i i usually buy second hand book like
S0115	yeah
S0037	there's just something nice about it and i don't know like i like the idea of a kindle like like if you're travel somewhere like when i be travel for work like i would've really like to have take like load of book with us to read cos i have a lot of time on me own
S0115	yeah
S0037	it would've be really nice to have like load of book and different things to read and like but when you've get when you're go on ryanair and it's like you you can't take a a bag or anything bigger than like a bloom handkerchief on a stick then obviously you can't take like five book
S0115	yeah
S0037	so i do like the idea of have a kindle for that but i don't i think i like actual book quite a lot although i have get use to read things like on on the smartphone like use to read you know news and stuff on it
S0115	yeah something to yeah i like that um and that's really i i like read on the uh the computer
S0037	cos i be i be think about get a kindle i might borrow one you can borrow them from work so i might borrow one to have a look at and see if i like it
S0115	oh right no it's uh we need it's the sort of thing that that i think you'd like cos you like book but um
S0037	i do i i think i might get one for christmas
S0115	yeah
S0037	i might borrow one and then see if i like it and then
S0115	i'd like to get a new um laptop but that's just
S0037	yeah
S0115	but i wouldn't get a kindle because i don't um sort of
S0037	they're not that expensive any more though i mean they be they be really expensive when they first come out like two hundred pound but now the new the newest version be like a sort of smaller one um be like eighty nine pound so it's not that much really
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	so i'll have a think but um yeah i might get one
S0115	yeah um no that would could be uh i mean i don't know how i mean be it hopefully not too expensive to buy all the book and stuff shall we shall we move it on uh
S0037	it's rare that i have like you you get oh sorry
S0115	q's a bite sort of like
S0037	you get um you get a lot you can get quite a few free i think like ones that be be that an advert
S0115	um i'm go the next one
S0037	um oh johnny doom um yeah so you can get like quite a few i think that be like older ones
S0115	yeah
S0037	and and that be sort of free or different things and i think you can get like i think they're definitely cheaper than buy actual book from new but i wouldn't really buy an actual book from new well rarely now
S0115	yeah
S0037	so i don't know
S0115	well they they can be expensive can't they
S0037	yeah
S0115	but uh
S0037	but i don't know i mean i'll have to have a real look at it and see if i wouldn't buy one without see it i'd wanna have a go
S0115	yeah
S0037	see if i like it and also like see if how comfortable it be to hold it
S0115	uhuh
S0037	cos you know with a book you can just like you know you can sort of get yourself you can fold the page back and get sort of snuggle down in your bed or whatever with it can you can't you so
S0115	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0037	i think they're good for like you know if your eye be go funny like if you're old lady
S0115	yeah
S0037	like you know i think they would be good then because like big big print book be really heavy if you want to buy a novel but in large print it's gonna be like book like massive heavy book
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	but with a kindle you can like make the print bigger just make it bigger yourself so
S0115	mm i see yeah yeah yeah
S0037	i think it would be good if you like have some visual problems
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	and obviously you wouldn't have like hold a massive thing
S0115	i mean it's good with a smartphone but it be it can be quite bright and uh
S0037	i think you can change that though i think you can change the settings cos it be sometimes a bite bright
S0115	for me yeah cos i be i be talk to uh uh i be talk to uh uh uh
S0037	oh
S0115	about about um about kindle and he say uh that uh it be very um like i mean it really be nice on the eye like like a kindle
S0037	brightness yeah oh actually i've already get look i've already get it on really the lowest
S0115	yeah well i think it's pretty good um on the lowest thing yeah yeah cool
S0037	look how bright that be that would kill the battery
S0115	yeah i think the thing be when i be read it in uh in bed and you know it be dark so it's a bite glary it glare on your eye if you're read it in bed but
S0037	i know sometimes oh look you can calibrate the
S0115	what's it do
S0037	it's calibrate the gyrometer thing
S0115	you've put it on the you've put it on a
S0037	like a spirit level no i'm not do it
S0115	the gyrometer what what's that
S0037	you know cos it's get like a spirit level thing in
S0115	yeah
S0037	so if it's you can you can calibrate it i don't know why you would wanna do that
S0115	no i don't i don't see the um oh to just to tilt the screen be it or
S0037	yeah i think
S0115	it can't it can't do that can it or what be it do
S0037	no i think it's like you know when you use google map so it know that you
S0115	oh right uh
S0037	i don't know
S0115	oh yeah so uh so that uh that guy show me the the app where you could put in the number and it find it tell you exactly where it be like
S0037	i'll put that down i know yeah spooky
S0115	like how do i'd like to i'd like to get my hand on that app actually
S0037	i know you should ask him
S0115	he could tell you the it would tell you the address it would tell you the address that that actual house address uh where where it be so
S0037	the street that you're in yeah great for spy on people
S0115	yeah i mean um make you paranoid doesn't it
S0037	doesn't work if you're phone's off though you would just switch your phone off if i suppose you be do something you shouldn't be do
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	who's this by
S0115	i'm not sure
S0037	ah i bet he's get a sore i bet he need a strepsil at the end of the night
S0115	it sound like uh it sound a lot like um rammstein actually
S0037	no it's english
S0115	but he be speak english
S0037	yeah but i have er um i have a dream do i tell you about me dream last night
S0115	no
S0037	i have a dream last night that um i be in a kind of charlie's angle thing but my boss from work be like be charlie and um so i be one of the charlie's angels
S0037	and like we be walk down the street and she's like okay so now we're gonna get all of the like the people who be gonna come with us or something and like then i dunno what happen but then all these like girls start come out of these house and they be all have like bag and stuff and then we get on this coach and um and then um she then we be like oh we're go to new york and we're gonna stay in this really good place and then my boss be say like oh should we tell them now about the plan and i be say well i think we should i think we should tell them because i think i would wanna know what what's gonna happen and the next thing i be like get off the bus but like the wall be really high it be like a bus that have load of step to get off you know
S0115	yeah
S0037	and like you know that plastic bowl that i've get in that i sometimes drain the vegetable water into you know that plastic bowl that's in the in the sink in the you know
S0115	yeah
S0037	so then the next thing i know i'd like balance this the that plastic bowl fill with gravy on the top of the wall and then i get off the bus and then i be like ah me gravy's on the wall what be i gonna do and then i wake up
S0037	it be like the stupidest dream
S0115	tremendous
S0037	na i be part from me gravy then i wake up and i be like but what's gonna happen to the gravy then i be like oh i've get to go to work it be really weird so i dunno what that be about i dunno what that say about me mental state
S0115	i think well
S0037	there's obviously like work and gravy just swirl around in there
S0115	no i mean um it's it's
S0037	sorry
S0115	i hope that there wasn't the result of you know something uh something some worry that you have
S0037	i don't know must be some gravy base trauma go on there i think the gravy thing like the more i think about it like i remember on christmas when we have christmas when your mam and dad come
S0115	you be work you be work very hard for that but i think you should've make me do it
S0037	like your mam your mam like make comment about the fact that i serve the gravy in that bowl i didn't have a gravy boat she be like oh don't you have a gravy boat
S0037	and i be like oh sorry and i bring it out in like a i bring it out in a bowl with a big ladle in it
S0115	well i dunno i mean i don't i don't remember that really well i think she mean like like that she well she could've bring it or she would've give it like i mean
S0037	yeah but
S0115	cos they've get they must have like three or something
S0037	no i'm i'm i'm not say that her intentions be bad i mean
S0115	yeah i don't they be i don't think they be that that rude about it at all actually
S0037	no no no no i think you're right i think she mean like oh you don't have one i didn't realize i would could've bring you one
S0115	cos it be quite a it be it's quite an uh it's it's quite an impressive meal i think they be they be less rude about it maybe than like i think the last one they complain about have too much turkey but but this time we actually ask them in advance cos we want to have obviously lamb cos you want to have like your your uh passover lamb or whatever whatever it be and uh
S0037	yeah me lamb leg one one day one day i'll get it
S0115	the it's something so they be complain the other time about the turkey which i sort of want and then but this time i didn't mind but they insist on turkey with all the trimmings but but anyway uh that go really well and uh that last christmas be really really quite a big success i though the last christmas but it although it have some surprise in it but uh
S0037	i dunno i think that that next year i think it do have some surprise but yes
S0115	one big surprise
S0037	one one quite big surprise but i think this year like when they come this year to ours i think like i'll put more think into the vegetables like boil vegetables roast vegetables be lovely but i think like we could maybe go for less but more special
S0115	right
S0037	you know
S0115	i don't really
S0037	i don't know like um cauliflower cheese uh or
S0115	why less why less then we'd just you mean like healthier
S0037	no i mean like more sort of just different like
S0115	what what do you mean i don't understand what you mean cauliflower
S0037	like like um like okay so like um sprout but with like you know lardons like chorizo piece in or something
S0115	i think we already do that
S0037	do i
S0115	i don't know
S0037	maybe i do
S0115	but that doesn't you don't really need to cos you've get like
S0037	no i know but i think like
S0115	we've get we've get enough uh i mean you've gotta have bacon anyway but yeah oh you mean you wanna you wanna make it more special but less you say like less cos you have cos of all the fact you have like five vegetables or something
S0037	there be more than five vegetables
S0115	that's a lot of more than five a day well i think it go really well i think the fact there be a lot of vegetables be actually a really good aspect of it but yeah yeah you well you can take each vegetable and do like a little little party with each vegetable like could make like a like a soup yeah
S0037	yeah exactly that's what i think i though like maybe i don't mean like have less necessarily i just mean like put more into like
S0115	cauliflower yeah yeah broccoli and i think broccoli's pretty good on its own actually with salt broccoli's pretty good
S0037	well broccoli's pretty good on its own but like maybe i don't know sort of think more about like like roast some different things like butternut squash be really nice roast
S0115	yeah also you have your your sprout and roast parsnips parsnip
S0037	yeah i dunno
S0115	i mean you say you want you say you you say you think you should've serve that at uh
S0037	the roast butternut squash come out really nice
S0115	i remember don't didn't i remember you say you would've like to serve uh squash it's a sweet potato actually isn't it
S0037	no what i say be i say that the um i didn't i run out of time with the potatoes like all the rest of the dinner be cook and my potatoes could've do with an extra fifteen minutes but i didn't wanna like hold up the dinner it's about time isn't it like make a giant christmas dinner with like all them vegetables it's not about good cook really it's about it's about time
S0115	oh yeah yeah the time yeah i mean or the ability to keep things um to get things ready yeah uh
S0037	and i think like do more different stuff like make different stuff like like not just i mean like last year i make like a a sausage meat stuff all very nice but like why don't we make something you know what i mean
S0115	yeah
S0037	just do like more different things although your mam will just want a hundred million thousand vegetables to pour pour all on her plate a big mountain with like a massive turkey on the top but i dunno i think if i be i dunno i just think uh i think it would be good to do different things like i dunno what about like okay i don't like asparagus but
S0115	but uh yeah you say uh cauliflower cheese uh broccoli cheese uh carrots carrot roast what d'you say uh carrot uh what's a carrot dish i don't know any carrot dish to be honest uh apart from carrot cake
S0037	things wrap in yeah no but i bet you could get some really good you know roast things like roast ah i don't know
S0115	carrot stuff uh carrot
S0037	i've get a good recipe for a beetroot cake i'm gonna try not not at christmas just in general
S0115	carrot and um cos this be actually start to sound like sound like dubstep again
S0037	i dunno you could like like for example you could and it be yeah for example like you could get instead of normal carrots you could get like baby carrots and like glaze them in something
S0115	oh yeah yeah we'll have to do something whether that's actually yeah yeah
S0037	you know what i mean like kind of more i suppose i mean more like refine
S0115	yeah
S0037	i don't mean like michelin and like one carrot and one sprout or anything like that i just mean like because there's only four of us like although we have get a fairly small kitchen now that we've master the let's make a giant dinner thing i think we could maybe try and just do a few
S0115	yeah
S0037	it's just an idea we don't have to i mean i'm happy to make like a
S0115	yeah
S0037	the same thing again like i didn't make roast like yorkshire puddings for example which be obviously sorely miss in any dinner
S0115	oh didn't you i i uh
S0037	no i didn't i didn't i haven't get a pudding tin that's one thing i do need to buy
S0115	have you write down all your recipe for that for that meal that you make
S0037	the dinner
S0115	yeah
S0037	well no i mean it's just
S0115	cos i mean you keep recipes like you gotta write it down haven't you
S0037	i do keep recipes no i haven't i haven't write it down i should i should write it down the time and stuff i should
S0115	yeah cos there's some techniques some techniques yeah cos the you know when when we get old and forget everything we're gonna need to follow these things
S0037	it yeah but i've get a good like beetroot cake recipe that i just find that look really nice
S0115	a what cake
S0037	beetroot
S0115	a real cake
S0037	well you make carrot cake
S0115	yeah
S0037	beetroot cake
S0115	carrot's not like beetroot
S0037	it's suppose to be really nice
S0115	okay maybe it be what what sort of d'you put some good spice in like like all the brown spice yeah yeah
S0037	yeah cinnamon and like um seed and um
S0115	oh right yeah yeah if you get spice in i mean anything's tasty if you've get spice in innit
S0037	but that banana and walnut cake be really nice
S0115	uh uh with a few exceptions
S0037	yeah that banana walnut cake be really good i'd like that again like
S0115	well we be gonna do for for my parent we be gonna do um walnut sort of coffee walnut which uh which i think be gonna be particularly particularly tasty
S0037	coffee and walnut cake yeah
S0115	with the with the um a walnut cake with the with like this the coffee um
S0037	ice
S0115	ice um it's not an ice you know it's it's a spread it's uh like a buttery thing on the top i use to get those you know those little walnut things you use to get in a rectangular shape they be really delicious too
S0037	it's like a drizzle glaze thing oh yeah butter cream sorry butter cream yeah
S0115	uh and then
S0037	it's a nigella recipe so it'll be really nice i bet
S0115	on on uh in addition to that uh that's that's a good thing about elitism isn't it though
S0037	no i she just i she she's like she just love cake doesn't she
S0115	she's uh she's definitely a definitely a member of the elite
S0037	like seven pack of butter
S0115	uh that's a fly i be try to
S0037	no i think it's just a dribble
S0115	no it be a fly well it's go go on huh uh
S0037	well the plant can go in a little greenhouse thing can't believe it rain when i come home from work how rude
S0115	oh yeah no yeah yeah it rain a lot and it and it's harder cycle in the rain it's kind of annoy isn't it uh
S0037	i dunno it i it's worse like i don't mind cycle home in the rain cos if you're just go home then i don't really care cos just you know get change get in the shower whatever
S0115	yeah uh yeah
S0037	but like when you're cycle to work and it's rain that's miserable
S0115	yeah shall we have uh a quick break
S0037	yeah
S0115	think i've find out the where the pause button be
