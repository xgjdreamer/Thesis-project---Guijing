S0509	yeah yeah he be yeah
S0510	i mean what a lovely way to sort of learn your craft and you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	kind of develop and grow through such a series of film really
S0509	yeah there's not go to be that opportunity again for people
S0510	no no
S0509	yeah

S0510	support and you know yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	just a rare thing isn't it
S0509	yeah so yeah it's kind of sadness that
S0509	five years old or whatever
S0510	aw
S0509	but oh well yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	i be talk to the other day after we come out of the hunger game it be like
S0510	mm
S0509	we're go to get to like thirty and these actors be still go to be around like jennifer lawrence and things and we'll be go oh i remember her first film she be in the hunger game
S0509	it's like those be go to be our generation of actors and it be really weird
S0510	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0509	cos like yeah
S0510	i never ask you actually how be the film
S0509	it be okay it be middle
S0510	right
S0509	it it for some reason all the hunger game film get better the the further into it you get
S0510	oh okay yeah
S0509	so you know the first half maybe a bite meh but it heat up a bite towards the end
S0510	right mm
S0509	the end i didn't really like the end though that it be too cos the thing be the end flash forward
S0510	right
S0509	and they try to do the flash forward but it didn't it didn't sit right
S0510	right
S0509	cos obviously it's still the same actors
S0510	yeah
S0509	and and it go forward like five years or whatever and it it just didn't work for me
S0510	yeah it be a bite like last night on my mine and daddy's favourite programme which i've forget the name of
S0509	homeland
S0510	homeland thank you erm
S0509	they do a flashback ten years
S0510	oh
S0509	and that just didn't sit right because they're all the same
S0510	because they're all the same
S0509	and they didn't even really attempt to make them airbrush them a bite or whatever you know
S0510	oh no
S0509	it be just a wig and in fact one of them didn't even look really any different the other one at least have a wig on but it it just didn't sit right at all yeah
S0510	yeah no it actually to be fair erm i really like the last hunger game book but i didn't like the end cos there's kind of two love interest
S0509	oh right
S0510	and it's who's she go to choose and i think she should have choose the other one
S0509	right
S0510	although i don't think that in the film cos in the film he's sort of he's not as good as he be in the book
S0509	right right
S0509	you build him up a better part in the book do you
S0509	yeah in the in the in the film the guy like peeta she go with erm he's yeah he's kind of a bite less useless in the book
S0510	mm mm
S0509	i mean he's not he's not that bad but he's a bite soft
S0510	have you still get one more film to go
S0509	no that's it now
S0510	oh that be the last one be it
S0509	last one yeah yeah
S0510	oh okay
