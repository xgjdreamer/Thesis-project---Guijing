S0041	tread water that's fine i can do that
S0084	so you just have to tread water for twenty minutes
S0041	swim for twenty minutes and then tread water for three
S0084	oh right
S0041	that's easy so basically the issue here be the long distance run and the sit up
S0084	right
S0041	and the fact that i've get to knock another two minutes off my time
S0084	yeah so really when do you so by the time you go and do your fitness in five weeks you need to be run at thirteen minutes
S0041	um i need to be run at about fourteen but my fitness won't be in five weeks it'll be a minimum of six weeks very very minimum
S0084	okay
S0041	from now so i've get six weeks i've already be train for six weeks
S0084	yeah
S0041	so just six seven weeks
S0084	yeah it's definitely feasible
S0041	i could i i reckon i could lose a minute in six weeks
S0084	absolutely it's definitely feasible
S0041	imagine if i'd not start do this in january
S0084	oh man
S0041	can you imagine if right now oh it's get a bite closer i've pass my recruit test i should start train now
S0084	yeah yeah well i mean it's amaze how quickly your body cop with things like that you'd have to be train every day though wouldn't you
S0041	yeah
S0084	you'd have to go every single day
S0041	and your legs'd think your probably legs'd just fall off
S0084	yeah it's
S0041	you'd just wake up one morning and you'd be legless not the good way
S0084	legless and your heart might explode
S0041	yes that's also an option
S0084	mm that's a tough one well i mean it'll be worth it in the long run i suppose that's the idea about push yourself so much presumably that's why people do it i would
S0041	i've just send a message but it didn't save that's annoy i hope it go
S0084	be he misbehave
S0041	i hope so i dunno i just say um should be okay i think um
S0041	freeze yep fact um to be honest i train most days during the week manage to get my run down to five o five
S0084	mm
S0041	um let me know if you're free one daytime
S0084	mm
S0041	basically that's it i'm not i'm not be the person that he can easily see as an afterthought when he's get a a bite of spare time during the week he can fuck off
S0084	mm
S0041	love you
S0084	hm
S0041	yeah so sod that
S0084	mm
S0041	fuck that for a game of soldier and if he want to spend his weekend travel to then go for it cos by the sound of it
S0041	this girl's a massive limp lettuce
S0084	yep oh definitely
S0041	she's twenty six and she's still work at uni well fuck great and i tell you what if he have a a nice easy life with her then fantastic five years time he's gonna be bore to fuck
S0084	i be gonna say
S0041	and he won't have achieve anything
S0084	yeah it's not gonna be it doesn't sound like it's anything that's gonna be go anywhere like in the short term it's probably quite the appeal be that it's different to what he have with you
S0041	mm
S0084	but that's nothing that's gonna keep him there and interest long term
S0041	no definitely not
S0084	and if she be live here it might be a very different story
S0041	i bet if she be live here he'd get bore of her very quickly
S0084	i can definitely say that's true
S0041	like it's all lovely now cos she's they're he go there and he she take him to gigs
S0084	mm
S0041	cos she get to go at the student union
S0084	oh nice
S0041	yeah so they go to see and somebody else or something
S0084	mm
S0041	either way if she'd not get that privilege do you think she'd be buy him ticket to see stuff no i don't think so
S0084	mm
S0041	and do you think he he'd be so excite to go there no probably not
S0084	yeah
S0041	so
S0084	oh huh she's blackmail him
S0041	yep blackmail him and then he's gonna feel sorry for her cos she's so fat
S0084	yeah and and bore
S0041	and which make me do you know i hate i hate say that i hate say that cos that's one thing that i always think that if you're gonna insult someone don't go for the below the belt shoot
S0041	have the fat comment but it make me feel better right now so huh whilst she can't actually physically hear it then
S0084	well i mean and
S0041	and doesn't know it then
S0084	and the anger isn't direct at her like er your frustration be that he's interest in someone like her but your anger isn't at her it's at him
S0041	yeah
S0084	for be a douchebag because she be er by the by and totally inconsequential
S0041	yeah
S0084	and
S0041	and at least she's not hot
S0084	she's not it'd be much worse
S0041	can you imagine if he walk walk round with a stunner on his arm
S0084	well and i have this conversation all the time
S0041	oh
S0084	all the time because of my two serious ex boyfriends and the first um serious boyfriend he end up with someone who be a complete troll who i detest and who i know and i know he be after her when we be together and i break up with it end quite badly and he get together with this
S0041	oh
S0084	girl who be fat and horrible and i just hat her
S0041	huh
S0084	absolutely detest each other at college she be a complete cowbag and er just sleep her way through our group of friends like she be just know as the group bike basically everyone have shag her and um and she just really like a massive knob do you know what i mean like no one have any time for her he get together with her and then they move in together and they be together for about four years i think
S0041	huh
S0084	but they break up last year
S0041	good
S0084	and i say well at least she's a hound
S0041	yeah
S0084	and say no no no no because it's a reflection on you like you'd want
S0041	yeah
S0084	you'd want them to go for someone hot because then it mean that they find hot women what you perceive to be hot attractive
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	and therefore you know that you're hot cos then obviously bite of a dickhead at the time but get together with this girl who be i consider to be very attractive you know big boob um pretty face you know could cook be quite homely
S0041	yeah
S0084	all these type of things and i always use to compare myself to her but i but i know we be very different but she be hot she's what i would consider to be quite attractive and er typically his type you know brunette quite curvy and that have get boob and i and i know that he that'd be his type so it's quite hard like i think i don't wanna think of of anyone that i've be with to be with someone hotter than me cos you don't wanna think they're compare you but at the same time
S0041	yeah
S0084	like you don't wanna think that their taste be munters
S0041	well that's the thing do you know this'll
S0084	so
S0041	make me sound awful but i kind of think well apart from tom who's gonna be bias because it's his girlfriend's friend
S0084	mm
S0041	and he must still think it anyway be that i don't want him introduce this fatty to his friends who you know have you know similar length hair to me similar colour i'm not a small person you know i don't want them to think oh well er he obviously go for you know chubby blondes
S0084	you're completely different though you look completely different you've get you've get a completely different style haven't you like she she doesn't wear er high heel from what you be say like she's not feminine at all
S0041	no
S0084	whereas you very much be like if they meet her they would see that she's completely different to you
S0041	mm
S0084	i mean obviously all girls have a similar look in the sense that they've all get boob and a vajayjay
S0084	do you know what i mean like i don't think they would compare the two of you and i maybe that's as i say part of the appeal
S0041	freak hope not that's partially why i want to see and i know it sound awful and it make me sound really shallow but i just want to do a bite of parade
S0084	mm
S0041	cos last time he saw me how big be i be i be the same weight but a very different size i be like how i be when i move in here
S0084	yeah your body shape
S0041	so i want
S0084	your body shape have change a lot hasn't it you know i mean have you see that
S0041	i want to parade
S0084	yeah
S0041	no
S0084	no it have it really have you look completely different
S0041	i can see my waist more now my waist's longer
S0084	mm no you have change shape definitely
S0041	i want to parade
S0084	mm
S0041	so that there be no comparison between us
S0084	mm mm
S0041	at all do you know what i mean
S0084	mm
S0041	which make me sound shallow but i don't care i still want to do it
S0084	well at this point you know it's huh there's no rule book there's nothing to say you can or can't do this i mean
S0041	mm
S0084	you're sort of make it up as you go along because invariably people don't stay friends with their exes for this very reason cos it's very difficult very painful
S0041	and see as if you do say something you don't get a reply
S0084	yeah
S0041	i'm just send a message say have go road or rogue or do you actually get that message cos it's not go to my save er items send items

S0041	yeah i don't know where i've get that from you know i say awesome all the time and i have to stop myself from say it
S0084	awesome
S0041	but i don't know when the frig i pick it up but i've say it for about seven years
S0084	well i wonder if it's just just culture you know like we'll watch tv like american tv show and australian like awesome and sweet they say a lot in new zealand everything's sweet
S0041	do they
S0084	bro sweet bro oh that's sweet bro yeah um so i dunno i er my mum tell me that when i be five or six i use to watch neighbour a lot obviously didn't we all neighbour and home and away and um my accent change like my
S0041	really
S0084	yeah i would pick up an australian accent and so my intonation would change and you know how australians always go up at the end of every sentence so everything they say sound like a question
S0041	sound like a question
S0084	so i be do that all the time and my mum be like for fuck's sake
S0084	just shut up so um she do put a ban on neighbour for a while and i be devastate so it's quite funny like when you go to er america now they think that you sound australian like they think british
S0041	yeah
S0084	people sound australian
S0041	yeah
S0084	because they're retard
S0041	they think anybody with a southern accent sound australian
S0084	mm it's weird i guess maybe it's not any different to um like an english person and a scottish person but then if you think that you can tell the difference between a new york accent and a southern accent
S0041	mm
S0084	can't you
S0041	yeah
S0084	especially if it's like an italian american new york
S0041	yeah
S0084	accent
S0041	york
S0084	york
S0041	new york
S0084	yeah exactly
S0041	yeah i find it very frustrate that they can't they can't tell the difference between a newcastle accent and mine
S0084	mm
S0041	my accent and newcastle accent
S0084	yeah yeah i know
S0041	completely the same thing what
S0084	well i guess yeah i mean it
S0041	it's
S0084	you can obviously we can tell that there's a difference but it's it's not like a southern and a and a northern accent i mean i know your accent and and a geordie accent be completely different
S0041	mm
S0084	if you think that if you be someone who know that people from the south say last and people from the north say last
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i think they just lump you all in together no matter that you all sound completely different
S0041	so so be they friends again now then or what
S0084	who who even know i mean er it change well not even within the hour like less than an hour it's less than hour ago just before you get home
S0041	this be crazy shit man
S0084	well he's a glutton for punishment because she'll only say oh i don't know what we i want
S0041	mm
S0084	mm you've gotta give me time well why's she come over here then she can't keep say i've gotta have my space and then texting day and come over
S0041	i know this and you know this but it turn out that'd be too sensible
S0084	she's a fuck loon
S0041	actual looney tune
S0084	mm
S0041	i think i need a bite of spice in this
S0084	mm spicy
S0041	spicy
S0084	mm nommy mm i definitely need some sort of pudding in my life maybe maybe a hot chocolate
S0041	or chocolate horlicks it's not as chocolatey as hot chocolate
S0084	mm i actually avoid biscuits today though and i didn't have pudding cos we have obviously a pre dinner and i didn't have i be gonna have a hot chocolate cos they make do i tell you they make the hot chocolate with button chocolate button man alive it's the most amaze thing you've ever taste in your life button like giant chocolate button they melt them down that's why you can only get it it's like the like a really small window of time that you can get it because they don't melt very quickly cos they're just cos they're retard they don't do it
S0041	and then burn

S0084	condomy well at least he's be safe what be the skinny photos do in here
S0041	er what's his face crazy horse want to see what i look like when i be younger
S0084	crazy horse
S0041	he doesn't know i call him crazy horse but i quite wanna tell him
S0084	it's a very appropriate name because he's crazy mm keep get e mail from the people that i use to volunteer for jimmy's the night shelter and i just don't wanna go back i'm i'm a bite scar
S0041	how long be you volunteer there for
S0084	a few months
S0041	what make you do this
S0084	um dunno just think i be investigate volunteer possibilities in the city and there aren't really an awful lot like i think oh you could like go and read to kid in school and stuff like that but can't really do that um although our our company give you seven hours a year so like one day a year to go and spend a day volunteer do something like you can have
S0041	wow
S0084	you can basically choose what you wanna do um but it'd be quite nice if you could do it more often um but like my our operations boss whose birthday it be last week she's gonna do a project with the romsey mill
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	all the um teenage girls they're gonna um they're gonna take photos and make um a magazine front cover cos obviously er can
S0041	wow
S0084	take her mac and take along like all the software program that we use like indesign and put the photos in there and mock up a spread or a front cover for a magazine they can you know they can do whatever they like and then bring it into the into the office and print them out cos we've get a super duper whizzy lovely one printer um and they can actually keep copy so she say she's gonna volunteer and do that cos they're one of they're one of our register charities so
S0041	mm
S0084	it's quite a good idea but i think
S0041	that be a nice thing to do
S0084	the thing about be you have to like if you get the nightshift you have to sleep on the sofa there overnight with them
S0041	what
S0084	kind of a bite freaky like you either there's three shift either you do the breakfast shift so you go in at like half six and go and make breakfast for everybody there's if it's full there's twenty people like sleep there at any one time like
S0041	twenty people
S0084	like homeless people yeah they've get eighteen bed for blokes and two bed for women which at the time i be like why be that and they be say well predominantly it's you find there's more men on the streets than women
S0041	oh
S0084	and they they put it down to like the break up of the home um they're say like you know if a husband and wife break up and they've get kid like it'll always pretty much be expect that the man will move out
S0041	yeah
S0084	and if he have a bite of a break down of like events spiral out of control like he might get a bite depress he might not be able to go into work he might lose his job and then he hasn't get any money and all of a sudden he's too proud to ask for help
S0041	yeah
S0084	before you know it it's like a really slippery slope and then once you're on the streets you can't get another job cos you haven't get an address and you don't ask for help i think women be much more um able to do that so you do just and actually when she say that i think well yeah no you do mainly see men don't you
S0041	yeah
S0084	you don't see a lot of women so yeah but i dunno it's hard
S0041	yeah i i think it would freak me out too much
S0084	i think the idea of it's probably worse than it actually it actually be like
S0041	i'd just be scar of people that be on drug
S0084	yeah although i mean obviously they've get very strict rule if they find out that anybody bring it onto the the site they'd be out instantly
S0041	yeah
S0084	but um yeah i mean you just don't know and if you
S0041	yeah that's my only problem the drug thing
S0084	if you sleep there you've gotta sleep on the sofa which be out in the open like the er dormitory block on the side um but to get out and cross the room to the toilets they've gotta come into your space and there's always night people there like there's always cos you're a volunteer but there be extra pay staff and there's always someone sit in their little office but it's lock and it's get like bulletproof glass and they're they're behind the screen and i think god if anything
S0041	yeah so people behind the screen
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i've get to be in with them all
S0084	with the crazies
S0041	yeah and i'm sure they're not all crazy but the risk of sleep anywhere with a group of strangers
S0084	mm
S0041	never mind homeless people doesn't matter who they be
S0084	yeah
S0041	you know freak me out
S0084	yeah it be hard cos you do sort of you get to a point where you think well i wanna i wanna do something i wanna give something back but it's find the right thing
S0041	mm
S0084	you know you can't sort of volunteer in a shop because you work
S0041	yeah
S0084	and you don't have time to do that so it's sort of find other ways of do it and then i be gonna volunteer for the st john's ambulance but i realize too squeamish
S0041	yeah that would've be great but yeah be i'd be sick so
S0084	yeah i would literally just pass out and then they'd need another paramedic for me
S0041	bite of an issue
S0084	mm
S0041	i actually watch um a programme recently and basically a bite like brits abroad but
S0084	mm
S0041	brits go to festivals and get too drink
S0084	oh right
S0041	and how they get hurt you know smash their feet in into stuff and
S0084	oh god
S0041	just basically be general alcoholics
S0084	good yeah
S0041	and all the people from st john's ambulance that kind of volunteer do this every year
S0084	god
S0041	like they they spend their summer pick up drunkards
S0084	oh
S0041	literally pick up drunkards they be get vomit on
S0084	mm
S0041	like they be get people that be like shout cos they be drink i mean they be get people that be genuinely actually just get trample in the
S0084	oh god
S0041	in the herd
S0084	yeah
S0041	i just i be watch it and they be like well you know they'll get more out of this than come to the show itself
S0084	yeah i know what's what
S0041	generous thing to do
S0084	what people like that do be amaze isn't it really i think of all the time all the time
S0041	every time
S0084	the occasional time that i would get really smash at when i be at uni and you know they they be always there they be always there outside the student union every night just to make sure everyone be okay and and they'd come in and look after you if you be feel a bite dodgy and you know it be nice that they do that
S0041	do you wanna try the
S0084	um shall i
S0041	do you want to have a smell of it and see what
S0084	yeah just a little sniffedy doo dah

S0084	until one of us die
S0041	until one of us keel over oh achy legs
S0084	that's from a film actually isn't it be there a film where someone say that
S0041	until one of us die
S0084	oh it's in blackadder do you ever watch blackadder
S0041	mm mm
S0084	oh when i be grow up my mum have mum and dad be really into blackadder but they have the fourth series so you know like each series be a different period of time
S0041	mm
S0084	dunno if you've ever watch blackadder yeah so it's just
S0041	i saw the one with queen victoria in
S0084	er
S0041	i've see a couple of those be that it
S0084	elizabeth yeah queen elizabeth be yeah
S0041	oh sorry yeah
S0084	um so that's the second series queenie um and then the third series be the regency so it's like sort of turn of the century nineteen hundreds um and then oh no earlier than that later than that be regency before victoria no it must have be god my history's terrible
S0041	mm
S0084	anyway it's it's regency whenever that be i'm not quite sure um but they're wear they're wear tights so i'm gonna say it be pre victorian which mean it would've be like the eighteen
S0041	that's really annoy me now i really wanna know
S0084	eighteen forties or something let me go and get my phone and i'll be able to tell you madame
S0041	need some water be able to google that up
S0084	yeah
S0041	i mean i'd get but i google too much today on
S0041	oh huh
S0084	oh voicemail voicemail
S0041	mm
S0084	right so huh blackadder so the third the third season be regency we will determine when that actually be
S0041	yep
S0084	um and the fourth season be the first world war so in the trench and
S0041	oh right okay
S0084	they all play they all play the same title character so they're always there's always um rowan atkinson play blackadder there's always um
S0041	yeah and then they do
S0084	tony robinson who play baldrick
S0041	extras as well
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	and they do extras and it's usually the same sort of people and um in the huh in the fourth series blackadder play um er an officer um because he's educate er hugh laurie play george who's also an officer he's out just out of but he's only an officer because he he's from the middle class but he's thick as two um
S0084	short plank he's really really stupid it's really funny and he get on well with baldrick who's lower work class who's just like the the squaddie the cannon fodder
S0041	be that the one that be on time team
S0084	yeah
S0041	get it
S0084	tony robinson yeah so he's like er they play i spy and um he's go like i spy something begin with r and then it's baldrick the stupid one and blackadder and he's like motorbike
S0084	and and blackadder's like what he's like oh motorbike start with a
S0084	no no the letter it start with the letter breakfast
S0084	what my breakfast always start with a letter then i have a little boil egg and he's like right come here he say please get this before one of us die
S0084	it's so funny
S0041	that's really good
S0084	i really i really would recommend it i mean the thing be actually it's quite sad because the fourth series be the last series and obviously it's set in the trench and it's all very funny like darkly comic
S0041	mm
S0084	and the last episode in the every episode they're basically try to find a way of get out of be in the trench like that's the idea in every episode i think there's eight blackadder's try to find a way to get out he doesn't wanna die he really
S0041	right
S0084	want to live quite badly doesn't wanna go over the top certainly doesn't wanna go out into no man's land certainly doesn't wanna get shoot so in every episode he's try to find a way out until the last episode and he think he's do it he think he's find a way out by act mad but then he realize it's it's it's not gonna work he's gonna have to go over the top and er and they do and they blow all their whistle and they go over the top and then you just see like footage of the men like come over the top of the trench and it's all in slow motion i don't really like slow motion but it's really powerful it's really poignant and um
S0041	do you know i might have see somebody talk about this on the tv before
S0084	yeah
S0041	and then play that clip
S0084	yeah and it's it really bring tear to your eye but obviously because it all just make it so real because you know that they be do that boys be come out of the trench into the cannon and then you know millions die in these field and er they play like slow music over the they play the theme tune but really slowly
S0041	mm
S0084	and er then then it all just fade
S0041	i have hear it before
S0084	into the poppy field so which be what it be now and oh my god it kill you
S0041	mm
S0084	because er i think because up to that point you don't you don't see it come like the first time you watch it you think oh it's really funny it's really funny they're gonna get out of course they're gonna get out they're gonna get out
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm and they don't
S0041	i think it be a programme about black humour i watch
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos it have things about mighty boosh in it as well there be quite a few little things
S0084	mm
S0041	but that's something i never get into blackadder or monty python
S0084	yeah i mean it be very very strange very daft i suppose but um it's worth it's worth a watch because i just think it's so clever it's so well do um that i think anyone should watch it really
S0041	like make me watch the monthy python film once
S0084	yeah
S0041	um and i didn't really get it like i didn't find it funny at all whereas daft humour we're talk drop dead fred and bottom
S0041	with rik mayall i find hilarious
S0084	yeah
S0041	i don't understand where i miss the train
S0084	well i don't i mean it's just it's just people's um humour isn't it you know it's
S0041	yeah
S0084	you're not you're not gonna have it all not everyone's gonna have the same sense of humour
S0041	well it's it's the same type of comedy isn't it same type
S0084	um
S0041	of silly thirty year old boy toilet humour
S0084	you yeah well that's that's what you like i mean the black humour obviously be be quite different i think cos it's like i think the mighty boosh draw from that that sort of silly silly humour but it's also so off the wall so obscure so abstract like it's it's sort of push those boundaries i think and now that he's do that stupid like
S0041	oh
S0084	luxury comedy i think you know
S0041	what be that
S0084	you're just be a twat now no one no one give a fuck about you okay regency era be eighteen eleven to eighteen twenty so it be pre victoria
S0041	well do you
S0084	well so it be turn of the century just not the nineteenth no it be the nineteenth century not the twentieth century actually i might've say that but yeah basically my my history be sort of earlier and then later
S0041	mm mm i've none i have literally egypt tudors romans
S0084	mm
S0041	little bite of elizabeth victorians
S0084	mm
S0041	little bite of victorians
S0084	mm
S0041	and that's about it that's literally my entire history no world war no cold war no civil war no nothing
S0084	i think it's probably the stuff that you learn at school though isn't it do you know what i mean like you probably don't go into that much detail of the cold war till until you do your gcses and if you haven't choose to do history
S0041	no
S0084	then you wouldn't you probably wouldn't study it
S0041	and i move school as well so
S0084	there's probably gap there
S0041	i completely miss like they be study the aztecs in the secondary school whereas i be study like er dunno tudors or something and as i move
S0084	mm
S0041	they be study tudors again
S0084	oh
S0041	so i i get two lot of the same thing
S0084	mm
S0041	and miss like two years of history
S0084	mm
S0041	out of the four that i do so
S0084	mm
S0041	really bad
S0084	that's that's the danger with the curriculum that you know it be open to um an interpretation at each of the school that you're at so
S0041	mm
S0084	so yeah that be quite hard
S0041	like what happen after victorians
S0084	oh that
S0041	what be here after that cos as far as i'm concern that be the end of it
S0084	well no no well er
S0041	victorians there's us
S0084	well victoria die in nineteen o one didn't she and then you have edward but edward abdicate so you have you have george her son she have fourteen kid or something ridiculous obviously cos they have all all the children they have a lot of
S0041	all the children
S0084	a lot of children that die but they have um it be george you know the king's speech
S0041	mm
S0084	it be george the fifth after victoria
S0041	so that's him
S0084	well no he's the one who come after he's george the sixth he's the queen's dad so george the fifth be the be his dad in the film you know michael gambon the he be really mean to him
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	why can't you speak it be george the fifth who be victoria's son presumably um then it and er he die and it be edward edward although that wasn't his name his name be robert
S0084	his name be and he be suppose to be king he would've be edward the eighth and in fact he be and he be in love with wallace simpson the american who be divorce and everyone say she's an old soak and
S0041	mm
S0084	he didn't wanna give her up er but she could never be a queen
S0041	i hear a bite about that
S0084	cos she be divorce so he abdicate er and then there hadn't
S0041	for her
S0084	for her and there hadn't be an abdication in decades hundreds of years so he abdicate and george the sixth
S0041	so hang on
S0084	take the throne
S0041	so there be the queen victoria
S0084	yep
S0041	she have all the kid
S0084	she have all the kid
S0041	and one
S0084	george the fifth
S0041	one of those kid
S0084	mm second eldest cos i think the eldest son die and then but the thing be they're all call albert and george do you know what i mean like it's impossible
S0041	it's not helpful be it
S0084	and they're not even their real name they're their king name so like
S0041	great
S0084	edward be call
S0041	so actually all the kings have king name as well as their real name
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	oh great so that's helpful
S0084	so that's really good so yeah edward be it be and george the sixth be the queen's dad who be the king's speech speech issue
S0041	so you're go to victoria to her child second in line
S0084	mm
S0041	to he be queen's speech's dad
S0084	queen's speech's dad king's speech's dad yeah
S0041	yes
S0084	so basically
S0041	oh it's not a big gap then
S0084	no cos if you think that be er the the that be twentieth century cos victoria die nineteen o one i think edward be
S0041	yeah
S0084	um crown nineteen thirties no he be cos it be during the war wasn't it it happen during the war second world war so
S0041	i only know that one of them be fourteen
S0084	or just before
S0041	so the first one be fourteen wasn't it nineteen fourteen
S0084	mm
S0041	that's the only date i know
S0084	of the war
S0041	of all the war
S0084	of all the war

S0084	mm
S0041	all get mosh together from fallow field crap

S0041	which be no be not use nor ornament to anybody in the world ever
S0084	mm mm
S0041	to oliver cromwell and the person who invent the loom loom and work the cotton mill
S0084	that well all of that be er by the by like when we do the peasants' revolt it just

S0041	mm
S0084	they've get a torch

S0084	do you think cos he definitely have something in his hand
S0041	do he
S0084	yeah um i get it wrong after victoria it be her son edward the seventh who take over so that be nineteen o one then george the fifth edward the eighth george the sixth and now queenie our queenie which be windsor but annoyingly on this you gotta do it in two bits for some reason like i can't jump back a it's in section essentially jump back a section please fine so basically
S0041	mm should i grab
S0084	where's cromwell
S0041	so i don't even know what the hell he do or where he come into it don't know who the frig he be
S0084	well he sort of lead the revolution against the monarchy
S0041	for the peasants
S0084	er well for everyone really peasants' revolt be much earlier
S0041	um
S0084	back a section come on
S0041	when do the cake thing happen where the hell's
S0084	cake
S0041	er little bite
S0041	don't worry though
S0041	don't worry you'll be fine
S0041	you'll be fine
S0084	mm
S0041	so who's the person that meet let them eat cake be that be that elizabeth
S0084	no no that's um marie antoinette but she never say it
S0041	oh she never say it
S0084	she never say it
S0041	so it be a complete lie
S0084	it be a complete lie
S0041	good
S0084	i mean she be a massive ball bag er it's the french revolution as oppose to our revolution
S0041	oh
S0084	which i do when i be at college nothing to do with us
S0041	nothing to do with us
S0084	not
S0041	the the cake be french
S0084	it be a french thing basically her and louis the sixteenth he be mental properly mental and
S0041	have have syphilis and stuff
S0084	have syphilis yeah
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	and be a very young king and so didn't really understand he have a beautiful wife marie antoinette and want to keep her happy so he she want more and more ridiculous things like she want a wig that have a ship in it and a house in like a a dolls' house in the wig and he buy a he but he all he want to do be play on his train set love him
S0041	how old be he
S0084	oh like well for his whole life but he when he be
S0041	oh right okay
S0084	king he be like fourteen
S0041	oh right okay
S0084	and then he just
S0041	it just didn't get any older
S0084	he just
S0041	yep
S0084	yeah he just
S0041	yeah just get crazy with the syphilis
S0084	stay there
S0041	and
S0084	so as the as the people be starve he would do ridiculous things like throw a banquet just for the rich people because then they could say that that he be have a lovely time and he be and they be decadent cos obviously in those days they think they be ordain by god you know
S0041	mm mm mm
S0084	it be that their give right to be on the throne therefore everyone should adore them
S0041	yeah look at us
S0084	people be starve in the streets and they're have a banquet so you can imagine why the french have a revolution and er that's when they invent the guillotine and they chop everybody's head off louis the sixteenth be quite fat by this stage one chop of the guillotine wasn't enough
S0041	huh no
S0084	two chop of the guillotine like his head be hang off this be why i study the french revolution at college it be so gory it be amaze there be there's so much good stuff like every time you learn something new there be like a threat from here and some guy get stab to death in his bath by an old lover who storm in and and he and he have
S0041	oh
S0084	leprosy and bits of him keep fall off
S0084	it be so
S0041	oh i wish i'd have do this
S0084	it be so good and our our history teacher be so animate he be like a tiny little man he be like quite
S0084	a bite like a rat but quite quite like loveable rat and he use to he be be just really engage he make everything really interest and
S0041	we have the world's boringest history teachers know to man ever
S0084	well you see that will do it that'll kill it absolutely but
S0041	they're just
S0084	history itself be really interest i think it just you've gotta have a have someone who make it interest for you
S0041	mm
S0084	i think
S0041	mm that's why i remember the tudors cos we have a really animate teacher in year seven and i still don't remember the order of the wive or anything but i know more about it than anything else which consider how little my knowledge be in other areas clearly isn't that much but
S0084	well i think there's a lot of stuff that be just not relevant
S0084	like the peasants' revolt in like thirteen twenty
S0041	mm mm
S0084	who the hell give a fuck doesn't mean a thing
S0041	but when you're a kid you don't know which one's important

S0084	egbert
S0041	humperdinck
S0084	that's er
S0041	nearly
S0084	then alfred the great edward the elder yeah anyway anyway anyway so basically this have probably get cromwell on here yeah so after the tudors
S0041	yep
S0084	then you have the stuarts which be elizabeth the first
S0041	yeah completely miss that
S0084	yeah okay so elizabeth the first be the first stuart
S0041	yep
S0084	but i dunno why because she never get marry i dunno how she's class as the first stuart but it must be something to do with her line from the boleyn line cos obviously she's anna boleyn's daughter
S0041	mm
S0084	so it must be something to do with where she come from as oppose to cos obviously her dad be henry the eighth and he be a tudor
S0041	yep
S0084	so why she's a stuart i don't know but at that point after her jam the
S0041	anne boleyn's german
S0084	huh she's stuart
S0041	anne boleyn
S0084	anne boleyn
S0041	oh berlin that's where i be go with that
S0084	she's not german well i mean er she might be think i dunno i dunno if she's german
S0041	okay right i'm with it now i'm with it
S0084	yep so then you have all the jam so you have elizabeth the first then
S0041	yeah
S0084	jam the first who come after who be
S0041	yep
S0084	some descendant of mary cos obviously mary at that point have go mental
S0041	do he not last very long
S0084	he didn't last very long either and he he try to unite scotland as well
S0041	yeah oo yeah yeah
S0084	he be jam the sixth of scotland but jam the first of england
S0041	yep
S0084	it's all a bite confuse
S0041	be that robin hood
S0084	that's not robin hood
S0041	do you think that's
S0084	no
S0041	oh damn it
S0084	that's definitely not robin hood then there be his son which be charles the first now he be the one who be behead he be because he be a complete despot and then he dismiss parliament and he just want to run the country himself and so all of you lot can fuck off
S0041	right
S0084	i'm the king you will do what i say
S0041	yep
S0084	and people go
S0041	and everyone say no
S0084	that's very interest goodbye give us your head
S0041	god say this
S0084	yeah so then he go they chop his head off they have a trial that wasn't really a trial chop his head off and bury him oliver cromwell become oh i always want to say mother superior it's not mother superior
S0084	it's something it's something like that he be essentially he he essentially run the country and but he be a he be a puritan
S0041	right
S0084	like to the point where i think he use to flagellate self
S0041	puritan
S0084	um tut huh it's a type of anglican er christianity so it's not it's not from the pope it's not catholic it's far more right than than that like it's really you can't there's certain food that you can't eat you can't do certain things on the sabbath day like it's it's religion to the extreme
S0041	to the extreme
S0084	yeah so he so the people get really annoy with him cos they're like you're you're also maybe a bite mental as well so goodbye to you and then at the same time charles the first who have his head behead his son be have have to flee when he be a boy and he'd be hide out in scotland
S0041	right
S0084	his son come back claim the throne dig his dad up with his miss head
S0041	what
S0084	yeah yeah um have and then have a ceremony for him and then reburied him and he chop and he dig up do you know who he dig up he dig up oliver cromwell chop his head off when he be dead and put it on a spike um outside the palace as a fuck you because that's what they do
S0041	mm
S0084	to charles the first
S0041	mm mm
S0084	all pretty gruesome then you have um jam the second who be charles's son and then it become a bite weird and you get these people from um holland william and mary and anne and some other degenerate that's all about the seventeen hundreds
S0041	i don't know anything about those lot
S0084	i don't really know anything about that lot either how do i right so that take you up to seventeen hundreds now we need the second list timeline okay so at that point then you've get all the georges which be the hanover line which be this dutch line then then the germans come into it cos they all start have they they're all intermarry
S0041	right
S0084	this be all the bite that i don't really know so you've get all the georges another william and then it's victoria um and then yeah so she die nineteen o one then it's edward the seventh for quite a long time accord to this oh maybe about oh no no not a long time be that ten years then oh that's ten years so in nineteen thirty nine possibly edward the eighth er george so what do you think that mean then like when do george the fifth come in and when do edward the eighth cos george the fifth be obviously edward the eighth's dad
S0041	oh
S0084	it's weird isn't it george the fifth must've come in at the end of edward the eighth's reign er
S0041	mm
S0084	seventh's reign
S0041	mm
S0084	but not for very long
S0041	no at all how strange
S0084	he must've die straight away
S0041	shabs
S0084	and then george the sixth serve for a long time oh no he didn't where's george the sixth go
S0041	there
S0084	oh right so he be from
S0041	he's from nineteen fifty
S0084	oh no six years then cos the queen come in oh no two years nineteen fifty two cos it's her diamond jubilee isn't it seventy years this year sixty years this year
S0041	so why's it say
S0084	seventy years this year
S0041	this this be lie to us
S0084	cos i think he be um crown in the forties cos it be during the war and everyone be kick off
S0041	i have no frigging idea
S0084	i don't think it be the fifties i think it be the forties i think that's wrong
S0041	think they're lie to us
S0084	it might be the scale maybe that's why it look wrong or we're just read it wrong cos basic ah okay the name be at the end
S0041	name be at the end of the bar
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	so george the fifth be the bar above okay so
S0041	get it
S0084	we get it so that bottom bar be elizabeth that bar that bar there be george the sixth
S0041	george the sixth
S0084	so it be
S0041	that tiny little line
S0084	look like nine nineteen thirty eight maybe nineteen thirty nine to nineteen fifty two
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos it's isn't it queenie's be it seventy years
S0041	i have no idea
S0084	sixty years cos it be fifty two she be crown so it must be sixty years mustn't it
S0041	jeebus huh
S0084	so there you go
S0041	feel like i've learn
S0084	sort of in one ear and out the other isn't it cos you just forget cos they're all call george and william

S0041	but um i tell you about the the mess up with the the girl and the bedrooms and the wed didn't i
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	and how i think couldn't do anything and then chris do it
S0084	yeah
S0041	well today find the reservations in the system
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah
S0084	and what do he say do he kick off
S0041	he say what's this yeah proper kick off um cos apparently chris have get them and stuff base on sell things
S0084	yeah
S0041	he's put them under different rate cod and stuff and then get in trouble for the book be incorrect or i don't really get it but anyway he be like you know i'm really piss off about this you know it's like i say something and you both just no that's not acceptable as an answer and just go behind my back i felt like say yeah i do cos
S0084	mm
S0041	for the sake of your revenue that you're harp on at
S0084	mm
S0041	for a hundred quid
S0084	mm
S0041	you would've give you would've ruin the woman's best day of life
S0084	absolutely
S0041	get it into perspective
S0084	and from a business perspective lose four grand
S0041	yeah
S0084	do you know what i mean if she'd walk away if she'd absolute cos er she be on the edge
S0041	yeah
S0084	she be frazzle if she'd kick off surely robin would've just say right fine well
S0041	yep
S0084	you know as we can't keep this book
S0041	and also
S0084	bless you
S0084	bless you
S0041	oh didn't take into consideration that muggins here be gonna be there on her wed day
S0084	mm
S0041	and should one tiny little thing go wrong
S0084	mm
S0041	it's gonna be me that get it in the neck and there's gonna be tear and tantrums and stamp and
S0084	absolutely
S0041	god know what for the sake of what a hundred quid
S0084	yeah it's nothing and it's er i mean if you'd actually er if robin have er have to be bring into it he would've agree with you surely
S0041	he would yeah so basically i think get the gist of the story cos obviously she wasn't there but um you know he start kick off and i just say look that's not obviously that's not what i intend but i think
S0084	mm
S0041	the best thing in this situation for you to do be talk to
S0084	mm
S0041	he overhear me talk and basically save my bacon and you know if it's step on toe then i don't know what to say other than speak to him it will all they're all in wrong i say well to be honest i don't know how to correct them or if they be in wrong cos i haven't get a clue you know it's not something that's part of my job and if have put something in wrong that piss you off i suggest you talk to him
S0084	mm
S0041	and he be like but you know i come back from my lunch and you could've even tell me you couldn't have even say to me that oh by the way we've sort it and we've do this
S0084	mm
S0041	i think no i couldn't cos er you would've if if you want to do that
S0084	mm
S0041	or if you have any intention of it you could've do it before then when i ask you in the first place
S0084	mm mm bell end
S0041	so er i mean in the end eve actually have to say i think you should kind of bring extract yourself from this conversation now even in front of cos i think you're not gonna get anywhere you know it's best if just take it with and i just think oh my god for the sake of a hundred quid
S0084	oh it's just massive egos isn't it essentially that's all it be his ego's
S0041	yeah
S0084	be bruise
S0041	yep
S0084	he want to think that he's run the show
S0041	yeah
S0084	and at the end of the day and he probably he he know he's be catch out he know that you know that he could've give you a better deal
S0041	yeah
S0084	he could've actually be a bite more helpful other than can do
S0041	well see how extreme that situation be
S0084	yeah i mean
S0041	and he didn't do anything about it
S0084	in any business you've gotta make a call haven't you like a huh a a less extreme version a less extreme example when i work at waterstones for example it'd be our policy not to do any return outside of the twenty eight day um exchange period or someone come in and be really kick off just for the sake of what a few quid you'd just be like right fine yeah whatever do whatever you want of course we'll do you an exchange you think cos you wanna keep your customers happy you you know you particularly something like a wed and they're spend
S0041	yeah
S0084	so much money and he's just think what be the matter with you like why be you so tight about this
S0041	yeah and it's like he's it's come out of his own pocket
S0084	mm it's er it's just like he's he's read the rule book and he's take it literally
S0041	yep
S0084	like there's no sort of grey area with him
S0041	but he bend it for he bend it all the time just not on this occasion like there's be time when basically we take a group book it's contract they're liable for bedrooms even if they don't take them
S0084	mm
S0041	which with us on conference he's really strict with but i overhear him to sarah earlier today
S0084	mm
S0041	and she have a group book the twenty room and they take one
S0084	oh
S0041	and they didn't charge cos they're a corporate client that they didn't wanna piss off and i be like well er wed woman that i don't wanna piss off cos i don't fancy get that in the face next week thank
S0084	yeah absolutely so be it just that he's not be helpful towards you do you think be it personal
S0041	i don't know i dunno it wouldn't surprise me after all the other things that have go on
S0084	mm mm
S0041	but god know but basically have say as he do it know that be be a knob
S0084	mm
S0041	and simon and i both know be be a knob which be why we both kind of just keep it quiet and just say agree for to do it i know when he be do it it be wrong
S0084	mm
S0041	um but he say basically be very strict on what bedroom rat he offer however there's a new kind of scheme come into play next week which be be trialed which basically will take that power away from
S0084	mm
S0041	on conference book so they'll they'll give us a framework which basically say if the total book be worth say one grand two grand three grand four grand then the the minimum acceptable bedroom rate be like lower and lower as the price of the book get higher
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	which make sense
S0084	yeah absolutely deal
S0041	and obviously for a four grand book
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah the difference between a one six four rate and a one thirty rate be thirty four pound
S0084	mm
S0041	it's not gonna break the bank
S0084	mm
S0041	you know we charge them sixteen pound for breakfast and it doesn't cost us that so really twenty quid a book four grand
S0084	mm
S0041	three bedrooms it's it's a no brainer plus the f and b spend that they're gonna spend on foods and drink and everything else while they're here it's just it's ridiculous
S0084	you charge sixteen pound for breakfast
S0041	sixteen pound fifty
S0084	i would literally go in there with my handbag
S0041	yeah
S0084	just like that
S0084	i'd presume they be charge for the day
S0041	yeah
S0084	all my food this be for everything
S0041	yeah
S0084	stand there make sandwich for the day
S0041	yeah i'd do it
S0084	wow
S0041	yeah sixteen pound fifty
S0084	i bet it's nice though be it nice
S0041	yeah it's really good
S0084	mm
S0041	really good and you can even if you want to choose you can choose your own omelette and tell the chef er have this big hot plate and he'll put like smoke salmon or whatever in it
S0084	mm
S0041	whatever you want or he'll make you crepe or
S0084	yum
S0041	and then full english full continental fresh fruit yoghurts there's literally everything you could possibly want
S0084	yeah that sound lovely um tut when how do we leave things about the hotel in belfast do we leave it that you be gonna e mail somebody or do we book it
S0041	we can just book it
S0084	do we

S0041	and then i'll get up and i won't actually make it to the shower
S0084	yeah it's really difficult
S0041	i'm so so bad i'd rather have the extra twenty minutes in bed

S0041	didn't know that you know
S0084	i remember you say somewhere
S0041	i still don't really understand it if i'm honest
S0084	um
S0041	um
S0084	i dunno whether it's just naturally your body raise its temperature or or whether it's because you're wriggle around or or what it be cos when you're um
S0041	i'm freeze all night long if i if i
S0084	no i'm i'm a radiator
S0041	accidentally like turn over or hit my head or something or you know
S0084	mm
S0041	just stir in the night and wake up i'm freeze
S0084	no huh god no once i'm asleep i'm an absolute radiator
S0041	yeah
S0084	kick the cover off yeah yeah oh and i always wake up in a tangle of bed cos i'm a such a wriggler and i'm always in a completely different position unless i'm sleep in a hovel with
S0041	mm mm
S0084	take note
S0041	mm
S0084	um yeah but i always i always get really hot in the night yeah
S0041	just don't get it in fact i wake up about two weekend ago two or three weekend ago really hot but i'd be out the night before and the radiator be on full blast and it be
S0084	ah that'll do it yeah
S0041	about six about seven or eight o'clock get up
S0084	mm
S0041	wake up turn it down sleep again till one till one
S0084	cos have you have those days where you're you're really hungover and you start your period that be an absolute killer cos you feel like you wanna kill yourself cos er when you're you start your period your body be raise the temperature
S0041	yeah
S0084	by one degree and when you're hungover your body be raise temperature
S0041	still don't notice it that bad
S0084	oh it's so so so bad uh just a pain
S0041	yeah i still don't notice it that bad actually that's a lie when i be in the hotel which be er sod's law
S0084	mm
S0041	for some reason my period decide to want to be a week late
S0084	mm
S0041	thank
S0084	mm
S0041	um i be really hot in the hotel hotel room and jord wasn't so that's probably it but i still not i still wasn't hot enough to sweat
S0084	mm
S0041	mm that's a bite weird
S0084	mm
S0041	mm
S0084	when i be read the review of the place that i've book in brighton they be say oh the room be too hot we have to crack the window open i be like oh i would just love that
S0084	just like cook myself in the night
S0041	cook me cook me with fresh air blow
S0084	yeah i'd never complain about that
S0041	no i can't believe how cheap you find it
S0084	well yeah it's probably gonna be a like a total bedsit
S0041	no
S0084	but it's fine i'm literally gonna put
S0041	place to put your head for the night isn't it
S0084	just gonna put my head down yeah
S0041	definitely
S0084	not a problem mm i'll see some friends on the sunday morning and we check out about eleven i think
S0041	nice
S0084	it's fine they don't do breakfast but that's not a problem cos you eat so much and you drink so much at a wed don't you
S0041	mm
S0084	you know like full the next day
S0041	i er do i tell you i put my holiday in
S0084	for the wed
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm good no you didn't tell me that
S0041	and be like oh well you should put that in before you book the flight you know and i be like well yeah i know but to be honest i'd already check to see if no one have get the date so i already know and even if you'd have say no cos there be a reason that i couldn't take it for the amount the flight be we just book it round then
S0084	yeah absolutely yeah we do get quite a bargain
S0041	mm
S0084	i still haven't tut um speak to coleen about lay the groundwork for the fact that we're not stay at the hotel
S0041	mm mm mm
S0084	but i think she'll understand to be honest i think she'll be absolutely fine because we can't afford seventy pound hotel room when you can get a nine pound hotel room
S0041	yeah there's no comparison be there
S0084	not in a month where everyone's get marry
S0041	yep all the world all the marriages
S0084	all the marriages all the birthdays in march all the weddings in april
S0041	huh
S0084	and then just generally loathe life
S0041	yeah
S0084	in may and june
S0041	and june that's why i be think i'd rather wait a bite for my birthday actually
S0084	mm
S0041	and like do it when it's nice and hot in july or something daft but then i think the other problem be that it's a university town all the students'll go
S0084	students will go where
S0041	from
S0084	oh right so you think
S0041	go home
S0084	it'll be empty
S0041	yeah
S0084	i think it's quite um there's quite a few town townfolk who often go there as well
S0041	it's
S0084	depend where you wanna go i think my i be talk to my colleague today and er her fella's from and she be say like the nightlife there's really really good
S0041	mm
S0084	it's quite quite a lot of sort of trendy bar and alternatives
S0041	ring me yesterday actually and i miss it and i text her say can't believe i miss your call really wanna talk to you
S0084	yeah
S0041	um but so i'll ask her see what she think cos i'd prefer to leave it till yeah probably begin of july really
S0084	well yeah i mean we could obviously do something small
S0041	kind of break up time time away
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos if we're go in what mid mid may
S0084	to er
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	be nice to maybe wait till like mid end june maybe pay day in june
S0084	yeah
S0041	would be a nice time
S0084	spread it out yeah
S0041	cos it's a nice
S0084	mm
S0041	like a nice gap whereas if we go out the last week in april which be my birthday
S0084	mm
S0041	then it's only a couple of weekend till
S0084	mm
S0041	and it'll i'd rather something that i'm look forward to like be on its own and something i look forward to like birthday be on its own
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos you see the other thing then be it's 's birthday on the twentieth of june
S0084	oh perfect okay
S0041	so could go and see her for my birthday
S0084	mm
S0041	as well so do a joint thing i just need to talk to her i suppose
S0084	just pick up and call her
S0041	find out what the hap be
S0084	hip hop happen
S0041	yeah
S0084	oh that sound like a a pretty good idea cos may's gonna be a bite of a right off because of the weddings and
S0041	yeah
S0084	i've get this i've get a book course um train course in london twenty fourth and twenty fifth of may which be quite cool i'm quite look forward to that
S0041	mm
S0084	so that's the end of may and then you know it's the diamond jubilee isn't it on so they've you know normally have
S0041	oh
S0084	two bank holiday in may so the may second may bank holiday's now june
S0041	yeah
S0084	so i think it say the fourth and fifth bank holiday so i've take the rest of that week off
S0041	yeah
S0084	so you get
S0041	i think i do that
S0084	yeah
S0041	i can't remember i need to work it out but i think i do that
S0084	so i always we always joke in the office that you can get like three like eleven for the price of three so you get like eleven days off but only use three days holiday so i've get that week but i haven't book anything else after that until december cos i've book that week off before christmas
S0041	yeah
S0084	so that i can just chill out and then i finish my
S0041	do me a favour actually when you get to work have a look at those three date for the you know three days for the seven
S0084	mm
S0041	and text me up so i can make sure i've book the right ones
S0084	mm
S0041	i think i i think i do do it i'm so rubbish at remember so rubbish cos remember i do the same last year when they get marry
S0084	yeah
S0041	that be a cushy deal wasn't it
S0084	that be pretty sweet yeah but i didn't do it because everybody else get there first
S0041	uh
S0084	and somebody have to stay in the office but it be brilliant because everybody be out so even if you have to work there be no work
S0041	nice like it
S0084	like a lot of our suppliers already be say like oh that piece of work fall during the olympics mm well we can't really guarantee any date over the olympics and i be like er so what you're say be the office be gonna like this audio record studio be gonna close for two weeks at the olympics um i don't remember read that there be any bank holiday in that time i e you should be fuck work
S0041	yeah
S0084	and he say oh no there's no bank holiday but you know it happen once in a lifetime and i can't guarantee that i can get people to work and blah blah blah and i be like well if you want the work
S0041	then you'd better guarantee that people be work
