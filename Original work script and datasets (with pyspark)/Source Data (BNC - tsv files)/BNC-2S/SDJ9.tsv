S0015	pension
S0281	top up my pension and it's crazy er i i get er this number from this form er this letter they send me which be and then then they say no you need to phone the national number so i phone the national number and they say no you need to phone the local number
S0015	oh
S0281	so i get the local number and then they say you need to phone er the hmrc her majesty's er
S0015	yeah whatever
S0281	record and customs or something like that
S0015	yeah
S0281	and that's when i phone them and then they say no you've get to phone the advice centre which be the
S0015	where you'd be
S0281	where i'd be and they they send me say oh you've get to go and phone this i say i phone it already and i'm just go round in circle
S0015	mm so what be the outcome
S0281	well nothing i couldn't get any information so
S0015	your best bet
S0281	she she say try your local pension centre and that must be in i should think
S0015	probably mm your best bet be to send a letter to them all the same letter to them all with with you know a a reference on it
S0281	yeah well it's useless do this i mean it take so long
S0015	mm and what do you do you think you can do it then do you ask them that
S0281	well yeah yeah if i haven't contribute for the last six years
S0015	mm
S0281	which i haven't then you can
S0015	you can buy it
S0281	yeah
S0015	buy back in
S0281	yeah and say it's worth it because
S0015	definitely
S0281	yeah
S0015	well yeah because it's long term isn't it
S0281	yeah
S0015	definitely i do i tell you that when you be home that i buy in some for my teacher's pension i buy in four years that i'd miss pay to to erm and from from point of view my college have to pay as well so it be a really worthwhile
S0281	be there any pies leave
S0015	what
S0281	mince pies leave
S0015	mm over there they're in the thing at the back
S0281	so er yeah i've i'll i'll do that tomorrow but tomorrow i've get to go to the er citizens advice bureau
S0015	you didn't go there today
S0281	yeah i do they open at quarter past nine i get there at half past nine and they say erm oh i'm sorry we're full up today you'll have to come back tomorrow
S0015	that's when people queue outside
S0281	you you start queue at half past eight
S0015	yeah you do if you wanna be see you have to be in there in the queue at least by half past eight i think it's crazy
S0281	mm and i've get to get up about seven o'clock tomorrow
S0015	oh my god crazy
S0281	mm
S0015	yeah so be they open every day then
S0281	every week day yeah
S0015	yeah well i imagine at this time of year it's particularly busy be it oh they're queue because as you go in you get a number do you or something
S0281	i've get no idea
S0015	no
S0281	may be maybe they you have to come back and they give you an appointment for that day
S0015	well i i i think you get erm a consultation or something
S0281	mm
S0015	you queue up you go in and obviously they give you some sort of number system
S0281	mm
S0015	erm so you you get see in turn but it doesn't hold many in there erm and then you get a consultation and they'll find out what your problem be and then probably erm send you off for help you know that's more specialise help i imagine that's how it all work

S0015	yeah
S0281	the pension place
S0015	mm
S0015	well well look it up on the internet and find out exactly where it be but i imagine it be because that's er i think that's where the kind of job centre be isn't it in
S0281	unbelievable the way they just pass you oh so you have to phone so and so
S0015	mm i know i know these these erm government offices be always the same aren't they they have erm i don't know different areas i suppose that deal with different things

S0281	no
S0015	no in the do you remember
S0281	no
S0015	in the in the anyway it be on on there it be a really popular bar i mean she wasn't old enough to drink or anything but she use to go and sing there and she be really
S0281	mm
S0015	really popular people use to go oh come on please sing tonight play the guitar she be really a very talented girl very talented and her mother become very ill she have erm some form of dementia i'm not sure what quite sort not alzheimer's it wasn't straightforward some form of dementia and she look after her for give up everything and look after her for about eight or nine years devote her whole life to her she really sort of do everything for her and she always look immaculate this lady she have her hair do her nail do lovely clothe on you know no matter what be wrong she make her she say just cos she's not well why should she you know be neglect her just leave her
S0281	mm
S0015	she be really really good she look after her but when her dad who didn't wanna know i think he be just in denial of it all she give up her whole life really and and do everything everything for her mum and her dad he's eighty something now but her mum when she die it be about two years ago be younger than and she'd be ill for about eight or nine years i think prior to that so tragic really cos she's get well have no life and she's get so many talents so many and it seem very sad but she's lovely a lovely girl what she do now be because she she fight the social service and win
S0281	oh
S0015	which be almost unheard of erm because someone from the social service i think look to cut down on cost that be what it be about say that her mother should not come out of bed it wasn't safe for them to get her out of bed and erm lift her up
S0281	yeah
S0015	well the result of that be that eventually she would die from lack of you know move around and you know the with the organs i suppose go anyway say and and then the carers be forbid to take her out of bed so consequently say right if you erm if this happen and she go above anyway to her boss and say i'll sue if my mother die i will sue and you you know it will be really serious erm publicity for you
S0281	mm
S0015	you know you know i'll do it nationally it won't be just local anyway eventually they change their mind and give back the package for look after her and erm but when she you know she keep go and even after her mother die and they all think she'd give up then erm and she didn't she just fight them and she win and she get an apology and they say to her what do you want then she say i want it never to happen to anyone else
S0281	mm
S0015	and erm anyway she do win and and do very well out of it but she now erm be an advocate for people who you know have get problems with their elderly parent or family in hospital she she'll turn up and help them fight for what they want for that parent or or relative and she's such a worker so you know
S0281	's get a woman he go to visit who's in hospital she's ninety
S0015	really
S0281	yeah and she be a do you remember
S0015	i don't
S0281	
S0015	no not really
S0281	erm do you know up
S0015	mm
S0281	and next door erm there be a years ago there be a coffee shop a very small coffee shop
S0015	where
S0281	and erm it be run by this woman and her husband and it be their son who be a friend of
S0015	mm
S0281	and mine
S0015	i do remember the name
S0281	yeah not his daughter's famous she's in eastenders
S0015	really
S0281	yeah and erm anyway erm she er she have an operation just before christmas er have her pacemaker you know remove
S0015	really
S0281	or replace
S0015	remove
S0281	remove or replace
S0015	oh i be gonna say
S0281	because apparently the skin the skin be grow over it erm it be the the flesh be form around it or something so they
S0015	yeah
S0281	yeah and be convince she she wasn't gonna survive
S0015	mm
S0281	and he think he'd he go up to see her and he what he think for the be for the last time but she's she's still there
S0015	mm where be she in
S0281	i don't know i don't know where it be
S0015	get a pacemaker
S0281	yeah i know i know
S0015	and they i i'd from what i can gather they can't ever take them out
S0281	mm
S0015	because the heart or the muscle will grow around it
S0281	mm that's right
S0015	and so you know you'd rip hole into the heart wouldn't you so er
S0281	yeah but she's still there
S0015	oh bless her heart ninety
S0281	mm
S0015	that's go some isn't it
S0281	mm
S0015	really great yeah well what about then
S0281	he commit suicide
S0015	no
S0281	yeah
S0015	why
S0281	er well his personal situation wasn't great you know he be live in a council house somewhere and er i think you know it's just make end meet and he from what tell me he wasn't do anymore music but erm i think that the the thing that really get to him well there be two things er the first thing be that erm be his daughter's wed and they have it in i don't know a really posh hotel
S0015	oh right
S0281	erm the the or or something something like that and er she take him to buy some clothe and he want this suit and she say no that's er it's too much money you know you know get this
S0015	mm
S0281	and he want to try and you know look the part and she be scrimp try to scrimp and scrape and begrudge him this and that and but the greatest er insult be that erm he wasn't allow to walk her up the aisle
S0015	oh what
S0281	or or at the if it i don't know if it's a church or a civil reception anyway he wasn't allow to give his daughter away
S0015	mm
S0281	and er then another snub come at the reception there be basically er two er group there be the group where the the love be you know from the the sitcom
S0015	mm
S0281	and friends and family er from the other two families and er be er not ask to sit at the head table
S0015	oh that's stupid isn't it
S0281	yeah i know i know yeah yeah and it really get to him and he he apparently he write to the er complain about it and it be on the front page
S0015	really
S0281	yeah be say and he really
S0015	it's sad isn't it
S0281	make a stink about it well it be yeah so
S0015	well it be embarrass for him obviously
S0281	i mean er it be in direct contrast to you know the the daughter you say have sacrifice a life to look after her mother
S0015	well yeah
S0281	and you've get the the complete opposite of you know she how she
S0015	go to her head
S0281	treat her father
S0015	yeah lose to the group
S0281	and erm he really get uptight and about this and erm when i come over for my sixtieth
S0015	mm
S0281	erm the er i i saw him it be in the summer of course and er he we meet him and i meet him at and we go into the teahouse there
S0015	oh i vaguely remember you go off to yeah
S0281	and er i think that's the very last time we saw him and erm yeah and he at that time he be er say he'd get a young belgian girlfriend and be very happy with that but that fell through and i think that might have precipitate
S0015	mm
S0281	the last thing and he hang himself
S0015	oh god that's dreadful
S0281	and erm be very cut up about it he'd have have a very er love incredible love hate relationship with him i mean they'd have each other's women and wive and
S0015	what and
S0281	yeah
S0015	oh my god
S0281	you know he be with for years and years and years and years
S0015	i don't remember
S0281	er oh anyway he be and erm he split up from her and then come in and say he come into to live in the house and actually take 's place in the bed and then go to sleep in the on the couch or something
S0015	oh my god
S0281	and this be 's house ah oh it's
S0015	what
S0281	i know but he'd do the same to he'd have 's one of ex girlfriends or
S0015	oh dear
S0281	but it's a very complicate relationship
S0015	oh my god
S0281	and erm they've both er be good friends and good enemies as well sometimes
S0015	mm
S0281	but when he do do that he he felt very bad about it
S0015	oh my goodness me
S0281	i know
S0015	dodgy dodgy life that isn't it but i suppose the worse thing be you can't ever get over be reject by your daughter though can you really
S0281	no
S0015	it must have go to her head i mean
S0281	well i mean especially if you've get nobody else
S0015	mm absolutely yeah
S0281	and it's erm well i suppose he have his parent although his father be dead now
S0015	mm
S0281	but his his mother's still there
S0015	mm but it's not it's you know that your child you want them to be you know
S0281	i know i know it's but it's not uncommon be it you often hear about family feud and you know somebody's not speak to somebody else for years
S0015	yeah you do i mean everybody have yeah everybody have family problems but usually in that situation if he wasn't gonna be accept as as he wouldn't have be invite to the wed you know i mean would he i mean it's like it's almost worse to go to the wed and not have your
S0281	mm

S0015	mm when i've be here now we've be to a few church haven't we
S0015	we've be to a few church
S0015	and cathedrals
S0015	we always have this plan be to spend time on our retirement go off for the day to place like that but we never never find the time grandchildren or other things or distractions work well i plus i didn't really retire so it's only now that i and i have to say i wake up this morning and i be think i haven't get it hang over me worry about you know the next lesson that i've get to prepare or the next group i've get to deal with or the next observation i'm gonna be and it's the first time ever i haven't have it hang over me i should be do my lesson preparation or
S0281	mm
S0015	you know think about the next test or the track of something of students be a really strange feel do it feel like that to you though when you'd finish
S0281	er well yes erm it wasn't
S0015	do you have a lot of track or
S0281	no no i didn't do that erm but er it be er very strange and you know when i finish leave leave the campus for the last time
S0015	yeah
S0281	but i still go back to see a few people but it be er i'd be there seven years you know a bite of a wrench
S0015	well you imagine how i felt when i have twenty five years i'd be there
S0281	oh wow
S0015	but actually i didn't feel anything as i walk away
S0281	yeah
S0015	no not at all i think it have run its course you know i'd be there long enough and things be change erm erm and i wasn't the last one of because there be four of us that work together for not for the full twenty five years but two of us that work for twenty five years there and one of them be one of my first group of students and then another one that i'd be at college with she didn't work there that long but there be four of us that know each other and have come through roughly the same sort of background train and and work experience and erm so we work together for twenty five years but one erm my friend that i work the longest with she erm go she take a year out and go to work in and come back and take early retirement so she be the first one out and another one that i'd be at college with she leave to go and live in erm and then that leave myself and that be my ex student and erm i have the opportunity if i didn't take early retirement then i'd have to have commit to another five years and i couldn't face five more more years so i think right i'll get out now to get my early retirement money
S0281	mm
S0015	and then i can do less hours and still take home the same and that's what i do and i erm i take the opportunity be literally just on they be just about to change it to say twenty five year you know to fifty five so i i manage to get it and my birthday be in the july and they be gonna start it in the september and i so i go yes i'll have it panic a bite but i didn't as i walk away i felt nothing it be really strange i mean i'd spend well if you think i be fifty i'd spend twenty five years more time at work than at home don't you when you're five days a week you're home two days so i i be i couldn't understand why i felt that when i go to erm and it be very much more a relax regime and erm and i didn't work many hours to begin with and i just get end up get drag in more and more but i felt more when i leave there erm because i leave for a year and go to work at and that be the weirdest experience work in it be a strange and bizarre year and they my head of department erm get to know that i wasn't very settle it be i find it yeah i i meet some of the staff at a competition and someone say to me how be it go how be you enjoy work at and i go don't ask and she say why isn't it good i say well it's weird it's not right it's you know different and she go back and tell my boss from and she send a message i want to poach you back come back
S0015	so i do i go back so i actually work for for seventeen years but i felt more leave there than i do at because the people that i work with be still there very strange i don't know why it should be like that yeah leave die so all four of us go within a space of eighteen months to two years from and that be a really weird thing and die soon after i be work at she live nearby near er near she live in so i use to go to work have a class in the morning and afternoon off and an even class and go and see her and er and i saw her just a a day or so before she die

S0281	be they really
S0015	so they could do their lessons yeah and flipcharts and things and they be buy their own stuff cos they couldn't guarantee they'd have it for their lessons
S0281	wow
S0015	but erm the college what happen be the college erm when the new principal take over she announce that they be erm i think she say four million in debt or two million in debt two million in debt and there would be redundancies some redundancies so she take over in the january and february and she announce this erm and then a few months later she she say erm actually we're not four million er two million in debt we're in four and it's much more serious than i initially think and she immediately erm have the finance officer march off the build and investigate
S0281	really
S0015	yeah and the principal be call in and the finance officer and they be interrogate and the finance officer get sack with no pension
S0281	woah

S0281	mm
S0015	equipment and the materials that you need to set it all up and i think that's and it turn out to be ten million ten million in debt which mean it trigger an immediate ofsted
