S0252	do you enjoy your recent trip to goddards the home of noel terry
S0251	yes i think it be a good trip er it's not a very big house i think they could have do with a bite more furniture in it and none of the furniture be actually original i don't think because a lot of the furniture be donate to fairfax house in york because they didn't have any furniture of the period and also because he be erm an avid furniture collector
S0252	yes
S0251	it be a shame there wasn't more in the house mm i would have like to have live in the house i think it be a very desirable location in york and er i like the arts and craft style of property have a lovely garden although you would have need quite a number of gardeners i think to maintain it to that standard
S0252	be nice if they could erm buy some furniture that be sympathetic to the period
S0251	yes that would give it a bite more character i think i felt it be just a little bite empty also i think there be go to be more about the chocolate make of terry's in the house they could have have more photograph and maybe some demonstrations to make it a bite more interest
S0252	yes perhaps some free sample even
S0251	absolutely yes i think it's good to have somewhere else to visit though because we've be to most of the national trust properties in the area several time before so it's nice to have somewhere a bite different to try for a change
S0252	it be i think erm have the er membership encourage you to er visit all the local properties that you would not necessarily visit if you be not a member
S0251	yes i think you're right i don't think we'd go as frequently if we didn't have the membership because it be quite pricey especially for a family but i think they're a good day out for a family er if you do have the membership ticket
S0252	yes
S0251	and when we go to nunnington hall which be one of my favourites in this area we be able to take a picnic so that help keep cost down a little bite
S0252	it do but if we didn't have the membership i think we'd be rather restrict in what we could do erm on our leisure trip at the weekend
S0251	yes yeah i think one of my favourites in this area be beningbrough hall i think the one of the best exhibit there be the laundry room cos i like to see all the victorian linens from the embroidery that appeal to me
S0252	well which one do you prefer you state that you erm your favourites be both beningbrough and nunnington
S0251	erm i think probably beningbrough be more interest because i like the er laundry room but nunnington be nearer and it's usually a bite quieter isn't it
S0252	it be but it be surprise erm that the number of visitors of nunnington hall be sixty thousand
S0251	i know
S0252	despite it be such a seclude location
S0251	i be amaze at that er so what be that it be in the top ten be it
S0252	no it be erm i think it be in the top a hundred
S0251	oh the top one hundred mm so which be the best national trust property that you've ever visit do you think
S0252	yeah so i have be to a number
S0251	yeah you've be to quite a lot
S0252	in a really good position to
S0251	yes have a good
S0252	say i think probably erm huston manor be one of my favourites the the home of er disraeli
S0251	yes
S0252	which we saw on our last holiday
S0251	yes
S0252	i think er i kind of have a a close association with disraeli and that period because it have form part of my study
S0251	mm
S0252	i think it's nice to see the environment of which er politicians that you have study erm live in
S0251	yes cos i have never hear of that before
S0252	no
S0251	no i didn't i didn't know that's where he live never really think about it so i be quite please to visit it be that a less well know property
S0252	i think it be i think in some ways it's understate
S0251	mm yes and that have a nice garden as well
S0252	it do
S0251	cos it have well the formal garden and the vegetable garden where
S0252	it do
S0251	they're actually grow produce so that be quite interest
S0252	i be quite surprise as how big the vegetable garden be and
S0251	mm yeah it be wasn't it
S0252	didn't it not have an excess of fifty varieties of apple within
S0251	do it
S0252	the same garden and also the fact that it be one a slope must also have
S0251	yes
S0252	provide technical difficulties
S0251	yes it would be more difficult to do wouldn't it well
S0252	do you enjoy your visit there
S0251	yes yes i think one of the things i like best about visit these old properties be when they have a really good kitchen i like to see the kitchen's lay out with all the copperware
S0252	yes
S0251	the pan which be that one be it
S0252	that be holcombe
S0251	be that holcombe what be the other one with flied house what be that where it be oh hardwick hardwick hall
S0252	hardwick yes
S0251	that have a really good kitchen didn't it
S0252	it do yes
S0251	it have all those mould for make desserts
S0252	it do
S0251	i think they be really nice
S0252	yes it be a bite of a shame that er whilst they do do demonstrations that due to food hygiene restrictions you're not able to actually taste the the erm products make
S0251	oh dear it go a bite mad sometimes health and safety doesn't it
S0252	i know they're probably worry about someone er be affect by that and would create a massive erm issue
S0251	and sue make a claim
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	be there any more national trust properties you be plan to visit in the er near or distant future
S0251	i don't think so we've be to quite a few haven't we
S0252	i think one thing that be rather disappoint be that gladstone's house erm hawarden castle
S0251	yes
S0252	that's not really open to the public that they're it's really just the garden be open a couple of afternoons a year and the actual property itself be not really accessible
S0251	be that because it's privately own
S0252	yes
S0251	yes so be that not such a big house or be it quite a good size
S0252	no it be relatively big yes
S0251	yes
S0252	it's surprise in one way
S0251	yeah i think york be very well know for its chocolate make
S0252	it be
S0251	with the terry family and the rowntree family and it's a shame that most of it have be take out of the city and go overseas now i think it's take the heart out of york a bite certainly the employment opportunities have be reduce
S0252	absolutely
S0251	and they be such philanthropists er quaker families who be do good work in victorian days provide employment and social house and facilities for the workers i don't think we'd really get nowadays do we well i don't know of any company that do that now erm i think bill gate make a lot of donations to charities doesn't he
S0252	yes but maybe erm their role in society be to in some ways er counteract the lack of state erm aid that be provide to people because obviously
S0251	yes
S0252	in time of terry
S0251	yes
S0252	erm
S0251	fry's and rowntree's
S0252	fry's rowntree's there wasn't really any sort of benefit or welfare system in place so therefore perhaps in certainly in western europe and er more economically develop countries there be less need now for
S0251	yes
S0251	yeah
S0252	compare to what there be in the past
S0251	yeah i think charity probably take a different form now in that there's lot of charity shop which when i be younger there be probably oxfam that's about the only one that i can remember certainly on the high street er there weren't the proliferation of charity shop that you see nowadays
S0252	no
S0251	also there's lot more erm fundraise events that go on all the time
S0252	absolutely
S0251	people do parachute jump and er that kind of thing cycle rid and er
S0252	mm er in some ways people er be a bite too extreme at time
S0251	or yes they can be yes
S0252	in their ways of raise money for charity
S0251	yeah i certainly wouldn't want to do a parachute jump i don't think you could get insure for that do you
S0252	no no i think it's a big risk if anything er happen
S0251	yes
S0252	to the person
S0251	and if something do happen how would you feel if you'd sponsor the person to do that and then they have an accident
S0252	that would be er a bite of an emotional drain
S0251	you yeah i mean it seem a bite of a shame really that somebody have to do something like that in order for somebody to give them the money why can't you just give them the money
S0252	mm
S0251	or why don't you say i'll pay you not to do it
S0252	yes i think some people see it as a thrill and adventure er
S0251	yes
S0252	rather than think about the potential consequences
S0251	yes so where do you want to go on holiday next year
S0252	well it's er a difficult decision that really er there's er a few place i have in mind
S0251	mm
S0252	er i would like to see the the swiss alps and erm explore the er rich railway heritage of switzerland
S0251	yes
S0252	which while it's not very old in the fact that they be relatively latecomers erm to railways but i think they be perhaps er much more adventurous than certain er other railways erm within europe because i think they've choose some really steep descents erm so steep that you have to go round in like a er a helter skelter erm circle
S0251	yes they certainly have some technical challenge to get over some of that terrain haven't they
S0252	yes er i think it will be surprise if we do go up to which be the highest
S0251	yes
S0252	railway station in europe
S0251	yes
S0252	also know as the top of europe
S0251	yes
S0252	erm how much an engineer triumph it be
S0251	yes
S0252	to be able to build there so of course erm not today but a few hundred years back
S0251	yes do you see the michael portillo programme feature that
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	i think that be a good series
S0251	yes have you see most of them
S0252	i have see most of them i think there be definitely a lot of and more program that he could do i think one thing that they have not cover yet be the trans siberian railway which i think be an absolute
S0251	oh yes
S0252	incredible journey which i think people really do cover but the thing be the fact that it take two weeks to get from erm sort of moscow st petersburg to vladivostok
S0251	yes
S0252	mean that it will be a maybe a ten programme series to everything on the way but on the other hand you've get to remember that erm russia be not as densely populate
S0251	no
S0252	and obviously the attractions to see may be more sparse
S0251	yes be that the orient express
S0252	that's not the orient express
S0251	it's not the orient express
S0252	the orient express be erm from venice to istanbul
S0251	oh have he do that one
S0252	he hasn't do that one yet no
S0251	oh be probably too expensive though would it
S0252	well i think it do cost quite a bite of money to go on that i think it's about er i can't remember yeah i think it's nearly two to three thousand pound a single journey
S0251	mm
S0252	it be very expensive but obviously if it's television they've get a lot of fund to do that sort of thing
S0251	yes yes do you think they're try to show things that you might be able to do whereas if they show that not many people would be able to avail themselves of that opportunity
S0252	it's very true but at least you'd be aware of it for example i don't think most people be erm aware of what it be like inside erm
S0251	yes
S0252	erm obviously the place be that er you can see on the way can be access by normal train rout
S0251	yes yes
S0252	perhaps not the same route but certainly
S0251	yes
S0252	erm there be a valid route to take
S0251	yes but then once you've see it on the television you might well i've see it on the television now so i don't need to bother to go and spend the two thousand pound to do it myself now so it could save you a lot of money
S0252	well i'm not sure about that i think see on the television be one thing
S0252	and go be quite another thing i don't think you get the thrill and the experience
S0251	no
S0252	of the erm
S0251	no i don't
S0252	rail travel
S0251	no
S0252	and the place that you see which presumably will be very idyllic
S0251	i'd still like to do it but i think watch it on the television might be the nearest i ever get
S0251	although if you want an economy compromise you could go on the north york railway couldn't you
S0251	north yorkshire moor railway on the erm they've get some nineteen thirties carriages haven't they
S0252	yes they have
S0251	where you can have a din experience
S0252	well erm they claim that that be erm in fact better than the orient express
S0251	in what way
S0252	because the orient express be diesel haul whereas erm
S0251	yes
S0252	the north york moor railway can be steam haul at time
S0251	true i think that would be more atmospheric don't you
S0252	it would but i think it's from a technical point of view one thing be that steam can actually damage the overhead wire
S0251	mm
S0252	if it get too close
S0251	yes
S0252	depend on what wire be make
S0251	mm would you be able to realise from inside whether it be diesel or steam or be it just from an enthusiast's point of view
S0252	i think it would probably be more from an enthusiast's point of view i know if i'm on a train i can tell
S0251	mm
S0252	that it's er diesel electric or steam
S0251	right
S0252	but if i couldn't see anything
S0251	no
S0252	you'll be give me a bite more of a challenge
S0251	yes most people wouldn't probably realise unless you look out of the window
S0252	yes
S0251	yes when you're on a curve then you can see the steam billow overhead
S0252	yes
S0251	i think that look very attractive doesn't it
S0252	but really the er tell tail sign for an electric be really before you get on you'll see it
S0251	right
S0252	on the on the roof of the train whereas
S0251	yes
S0252	on a diesel you be not go to see that
S0251	no some people have say that meals be not really very good value on that service haven't they
S0252	mm well it certainly be a a little bite of an investment
S0251	i think it's something that you're only go to do once really for a special occasion possibly
S0252	yes
S0251	so i think it might be worth it just to have the experience
S0252	absolutely
S0251	of say that you've do that and enjoy it and
S0252	that's one thing i think about the venice to something orient express
S0251	yes
S0252	i do at least hope to do it once in my lifetime
S0251	really
S0252	just so that i can say i've be on it and
S0251	yes
S0252	have the atmosphere of it
S0251	yes
S0252	i must admit i'm not a wholly convince of the way that cabin be form on the er kind of overnight sleeper train
S0251	no
S0252	i be personally expect that it would be like a more like a small hotel room
S0251	yes
S0252	but actually it's erm kind of like a couchette
S0251	mm
S0252	in the day and then you fold the couchette over and erm and some overhead er
S0251	bed come down
S0252	bed to form it like that so
S0251	yes
S0252	it's really more like a bunk bed arrangement
S0251	right but do you have to share with people that you don't know
S0252	well i think if you if you go by yourself then you would but if there i think there be cabin for two three and four
S0251	for a family
S0252	up to six people
S0251	yes yeah i think that'd be really good and do you be it a nineteen thirties style or
S0252	erm i think it be yes
S0251	be that steam or diesel
S0252	it's it's diesel yes
S0251	it's diesel mm
S0252	so obviously i they're both very er place with charisma
S0251	yes
S0252	venice and
S0251	yes
S0252	istanbul i think they're very distinct
S0251	yeah i really like venice a lot more than i think i would because i be actually surprise at how clear the water be
S0252	yes
S0251	i think it might be erm a bite er dirty or smelly but it be absolutely crystal clear and you could see all the plant sparkle through the water and the fish i think it be really good
S0252	the authorities have do well to keep it like that
S0251	yes
S0252	but i suppose the tourist influence must provide a lot of money for
S0251	definitely
S0252	the region
S0251	yes yeah i think it be really a thrill to go on that grand canal tour the first day that we be there
S0252	yes
S0251	we go the full length didn't we
S0252	we do up to
S0251	yeah that be really good
S0252	one thing that i do see be that erm the venice authorities be plan to charge people to come into venice if they do not stay in venice itself because they be complain that they be not get enough money from the tourists to maintain things because if you stay in venice you have to pay a city tax which be payable to the local authority
S0251	i don't think that's a very good idea i think that's a bite mean really that you've get to pay just to go into the city be there any other examples of that
S0252	erm i think that would set a precedent
S0251	i don't know of anywhere else you where you've get to pay to go in
S0252	no
S0251	i think that's a bite excessive
S0252	it be and also you've get to think of the erm other such as people spend money in cafes
S0251	yes
S0252	and erm
S0251	absolutely
S0252	gift shop that sort of thing
S0251	yes
S0252	which obviously they collect erm er
S0251	business rat
S0252	business rat
S0251	yes so
S0252	obviously if people didn't shop there
S0251	no
S0252	they wouldn't be able to that
S0251	well it would boost the local economy and price be expensive anyway weren't they
S0252	they be
S0251	in cafes and ice cream and so on
S0252	yes
