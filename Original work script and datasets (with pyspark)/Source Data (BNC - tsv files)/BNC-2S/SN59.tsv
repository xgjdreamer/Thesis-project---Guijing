S0289	to check out the potential source of money and how much they might provide
S0282	yeah
S0289	one of which obviously be your own money the lottery fund
S0282	mm
S0289	landfill community fund
S0282	mm
S0289	local government and kind of although that's fairly difficult at the moment they will come back again
S0282	yeah
S0289	and the diocese
S0282	yeah
S0289	and a lot of diocese have the mean one way or another if they really think you be a good cause to put some money up in one way or another
S0282	mm
S0289	so i think you have to test all of those out oh and the last one be i think you have to find out where other people have get their money from other church other similar project how much be they able to get from where and if that's also open to you
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm but there's an awful lot just again i mean it be the same thing people here that won't stay with the project in or have put up five million pound so why can't we
S0282	yeah
S0289	well because you can't
S0282	no
S0289	you be not at that church in that's a one off
S0282	yeah
S0289	it will happen once in a generation that some money be
S0282	yes
S0289	so they need to find out what be a realistic thing
S0282	yeah
S0289	and what they realistically think they could raise from those source
S0282	yeah
S0289	and that have to be there because otherwise you do what you have do they've do at which be start with the architect so the architect think what kind of dream can i build here
S0282	yes
S0289	what iconic build well iconic build cost ten time as much as non iconic build
S0282	mm
S0289	so you actually have to have enormous pragmatism because the people who be go to fund you if it be outside funders be go to do the sum and say why should we pay you a thousand pound a square metre to put in a community centre when these people down the road can do it for two hundred pound a square metre
S0282	yes
S0289	let's go with the ones down the road and then we can build five centre for the price of your one
S0282	yes unless you have get a grade one list build and everybody agree that no matter what it cost it have to be preserve because this be such an important national treasure which
S0289	well that's preserve it which come from a different cause than adapt it
S0282	yes
S0289	because now there be much better fund than when we start for preserve list place of worship
S0282	yes but as long as they be exceptional i mean even which be in the top six thousand or what have you it be not exceptional
S0289	no but it get
S0282	the world wouldn't end if it somebody knock it down
S0289	it could get grant if it wasn't a bite of a pig's ear in term of who be apply for the money if the parish would apply for the prepare money they'd get money straight away
S0282	mm
S0289	from the heritage lottery fund as a place as a list place of worship but the bricks get treat as an oddity when they do it and that's because and the parish be silly silly they don't understand that this be what keep them there some of those one or two who be on the pcc when i be work there but some of the others be just mad
S0282	i know some of the new ones just absolutely don't understand and you do a feel bite like or something when you sort of say well back in nineteen eighty and you see them sort of think to themselves well so what and then in way i think to myself i be try just because something go wrong like that in nineteen ninety it actually doesn't mean to say that it will go wrong like that again in two thousand and fourteen
S0289	no but what you be deal with be the fact that because it have go so badly wrong
S0282	yeah
S0289	and so much money be waste there wasn't a single grant maker of the trust and foundation who would ever give it money
S0282	no
S0289	because i approach them all i approach a hundred and none of them would give us any money not a penny
S0282	oh really
S0289	you didn't know that do you
S0282	no i didn't
S0289	i just realise you didn't
S0282	no
S0289	and that's because the track record there be rubbish
S0282	yes
S0289	they have have all the money and they have waste it
S0282	yeah
S0289	so why would you give them any more
S0282	yeah and also go back through the history now and read a lot of the archive materials there be from the the people who be around who be responsible for that particular phase of history their rhetoric they be go round you know you know you've get to get us money because we be this because we be that because we be do blah this be we're of the people and this be you know this be go to be a really successful project and they've get to give us the money and if they don't give us the money then you be a rapist or you be whatever
S0289	but that's fairly
S0282	and all that sort of stuff
S0289	it be the same kind of waffle
S0282	yeah
S0289	that we be get to which we say no
S0282	yeah but the letter i saw a whole series of letter to from this one particular individual which er how dare you be a traitor to our group i be not give you money and stuff like this i just think oh well that's a really good way to get money from people
S0289	wasn't that the past manager
S0282	yes
S0289	he be bend
S0282	yeah but then the vicar be one of the vicars be mad one of the vicars be now a hermit in the official hermit at a church in or at least he be five years ago i be try to track him down the other one be still a radical campaign vicar in
S0289	how weird
S0282	i know
S0289	one the one who be there when they get the money from central government to adapt the build be dead
S0282	oh right
S0289	so yeah there be obviously others
S0282	yeah
S0289	but yeah it be that same thing of all bluster
S0282	yeah
S0289	that doesn't work
S0282	no
S0289	i put it in i do a second article a second column because of be away on holiday about church whose income doesn't meet their project expense and i put in it emotive or passion of exhortation doesn't make people change their give because they use the passion of exhortation
S0282	mm
S0289	in advertise and they don't buy everything from everyone who give them the old the story so it be not go to work when you ask people to reconsider their church give
S0282	no
S0289	what you actually have to give them be the consider and careful
S0282	yeah
S0289	presentation about the real cost and their a recommend level of give for people to think over for themselves
S0282	yes
S0289	and i think that passion of exhortation be one of our worst enemies
S0282	yes well actually if you when you watch channel 5 be it channel 5 with those advert all the time for where and various other charitable ads that they put on they set out to make you feel absolutely dreadful that you don't give them money and they just they pull they have the music they have the voice over they have picture of children on their death bed and stuff like that and you just think god i must be a bastard that i be not actually give them two pound a month
S0282	and if you watch any amount of channel 5 you could see that four time a day
S0289	can you
S0282	with this piece of music and these picture of die children and stuff like that
S0289	it's rubbish
S0282	and you do feel god i must be hard
S0289	i don't know if they
S0282	hard for not
S0289	still stick with it but about fifteen years ago christian aid make the decision that erm they would not use die children in picture they would only use happy children
S0282	mm
S0289	and it go along with an ad that be around a long time ago for a donkey sanctuary
S0282	oh right yes
S0289	and basically there be a skittish donkey in a paddock kind of kick its heel up and their their brand their line be make sad donkeys happy and apparently they get more response than could ever be expect from that
S0282	oh
S0289	there be several style to advertise and like you never put a vicar on your fundraise leaflet because they be not see as heroes they be see as idiots
S0289	and stuff like that but i mean i've translate it to that because people give to the rnli
S0282	yeah
S0289	not because of the stupid sailors that get drown but because of the heroic seaman
S0282	yes
S0289	so if you put a seaman go out to rescue them in his sowester and the rain pour down in bucket on his head then people will give money because he be a hero
S0282	mm
S0289	but if you show the sailor drown they would say you stupid bugger why would i give you any money all that stuff so you actually have to know what you be do and the the the vicar on the cover be rubbish
S0282	mm
S0289	that might have work in the nineteen eighties
S0282	be that what about fat jolly smile black lady vicars do they
S0289	a fat jolly black lady might work
S0282	mm
S0289	but i do tend to use small group of friendly look people on my stuff
S0282	mm
S0289	i think that picture we do at the be pretty good do you remember that folder we have
S0282	yes
S0289	with the whole
S0282	with the wed on the work party on the back or if not wed party
S0289	well it be not a wed party i just move everyone out onto the step one sunday morning and take a picture of them all out there
S0282	mm
S0289	and make them wave at mast and i think that be good
S0282	mm
S0289	because that say a lot about our mix
S0282	oh yes now absolutely
S0282	just like a thousand word
S0289	exactly so er no i think the erm the vicar's rhetoric be a deficit
S0282	mm
S0289	not an advantage
S0282	mm
S0289	you do need champion but you need ones that have definitely definitely get it all feet on the grind stuff who have your entire business plan up their sleeve
S0282	yes
S0289	erm and i can ask for money and get it on a face to face basis
S0282	mm
S0289	as well as through bid but i will only do it for project where i think be good and good mean they have be think through and they be not go to fail them you be not go to put a million pound in and then find in two years that it have go
S0282	yeah what somebody else be reap the benefit of it the first organisation actually hit the deck as soon as they open the door
S0289	yes
S0282	because they haven't think about what be go to happen when they open the door
S0289	exactly exactly
S0282	and somebody else inherit a lovely build that you've spend all this money on well buy it for a
S0289	it happen
S0282	buy it for a song because erm yes
S0289	but anyway so that part so i think that's the second stage
S0282	mm
S0289	be find out how much money you might have available then you talk to the architect as if you be design a new build and you say these be the need we want to meet
S0282	mm
S0289	these be the actual need we want to meet they be not hypothetical
S0282	yeah
S0289	they be real we want this be the kind of timetable we be run this be the size of group that need to be in this be how long they will be in erm and etc
S0282	yeah
S0289	and this be the kind of money we could think we could possibly raise in order to do the work so can you start talk to us about how this might be design
S0282	yeah
S0289	and an architect can always do it for less money
S0282	yes
S0289	i can never get to realise that at that in fact he have probably have reach the point where he need to go to them and say look guy it have be wonderful dream about a four million pound project but we really need to be talk about a million pound project
S0282	mm
S0289	but that's what he need to have say
S0282	yes
S0289	and i say it to him directly and indirectly in enough ways that he should have get the message but it be always off put to set up a meet with him and and then it be only him there
S0282	oh right okay because be too busy with something else
S0289	yeah but i think be the visionary and doesn't know he know it be brilliant but he doesn't you can't adapt the vision if the vision be not there in the meet
S0282	no
S0289	you see what i mean
S0282	yes
S0289	it's erm he hasn't get the access for make a decision like that
S0282	no
S0289	and if he go off to see later and say we ought to do this he be not the visionary and it be not his job if you see what i mean
S0282	no okay
S0289	anyway that's another story so i think the last thing be to go to the architect and say this be what we need here's the kind of money you will have available to do it with
S0282	yeah
S0289	and even in a grade one church you could do that
S0282	yeah
S0289	you can have a modest servery that cost no more than it would in an unlisted build
S0282	yes
S0289	functionally it be exactly the same
S0282	yes
S0289	you might spend ten pound more or you spend a little more on the external panel so it look suit to the build and you wouldn't have formica you would have to have to have wood but no
S0282	mm
S0289	it's not significantly different
S0282	mm
S0289	but i think the word i use be modest
S0282	mm
S0289	you want a modest adaptation in other word one that be not be design not be do so that it can be iconic or aspirational or whatever else it be only a servery for heaven's sake or a toilet do you see what i mean
S0282	yes
S0289	so
S0282	so actually and also in that case that mean the architect be just part of the scenario it be not oh look at this thing we've get
S0289	mm
S0282	we actually don't want we don't want name on the front you want an architect who be a job architect who think what do you need rather than somebody who like look at iconic build think my name will be in light i will be
S0289	exactly
S0282	in the architectural journal i will be
S0289	you want someone who will actually look at what you need and provide it
S0282	yes
S0289	even if there nobody can tell they have do their work afterwards
S0282	no
S0289	because it's so ordinary
S0282	yeah they need to be invisible actually when it's do
S0289	yeah
S0282	so it's not it's if it's not their
S0289	and that be fine
S0282	not their bloody build actually
S0289	well no it's not their build they think it be
S0282	yeah
S0289	one of church
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm and so i do get erm drama queen among the architects divas who think it's theirs to decide
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm but it isn't
S0282	no
S0289	when you get the younger architects you get a much better response
S0282	mm
S0289	it's the older ones who be now think of erm heritage no what's the word tut
S0282	er their erm
S0289	yeah
S0282	their bequests their erm
S0289	gift to the world
S0282	yeah their yeah it's not their inheritance it's the other way isn't it their erm
S0289	yeah anyway you know the word i mean
S0282	yeah yeah
S0289	and i these word if i don't use them very often they do drift away these days
S0289	erm but once i've remember them i can hold onto them quite well
S0289	sometimes it take a day to remember them
S0282	yes they sort of come to you in the middle of the night
S0289	erm yeah middle of the night stuff erm so you really don't need that kind of architect who's get to the end of their architectural career and want to leave their imprint
S0282	yeah
S0289	you really
S0282	legacy
S0289	a legacy yes that's right their legacy and erm tut that's a nightmare when they do that
S0282	mm yeah
S0289	and of course in the church sector a lot of practice that work with church be that senior partner who want to work on the grade one build everybody want to work on a grade one build and leave something in it because they know it'll be there in four hundred years' time oh there's what so and so do
S0282	yeah that's true that's true
S0289	well no sorry that's
S0282	well there's a very interest
S0289	we need to know we're like the victorian architecture which be ours won't last as long as this
S0282	no but er there be an article in the guardian yesterday where people have spatchcock new bits onto old edifices so you know that little portico that's half way down there's the little doric
S0289	yeah
S0282	the little doric chapel entrance which use to be
S0289	yeah
S0282	the entrance to a school
S0289	yeah i know
S0282	the school's go and they've get a multistorey block of flats before but with this sort of white this white portico with doric
S0289	on the front yes that's right
S0282	yeah but and then there's another church where actually the their church be like erm a sort of shortbread box for the build
S0289	yeah
S0282	that they've put inside it
S0289	right
S0282	it's a bite like us i suppose but
S0289	there's one at like that
S0282	yeah there's one the same that's in so you've get this glass thing shoot up out of this sort of carapace of victorian brick and you think oh there's something it's like have a monster behind you like this but actually it's its own
S0289	yeah
S0282	and the article be all about do you know what keep these bits for prosperity can be the wrong the wrong way of go things
S0289	yeah there's one in er where they build totally self contain glass box
S0282	mm
S0289	a metre from the wall of the church
S0282	mm
S0289	on either side and it fit inside like a hand in glove
S0282	mm
S0289	and you can actually walk er entirely round the glass box
S0282	oh right
S0289	i don't know if they do that now i don't know how that architect work that
S0282	no
S0289	it tend to be the criteria if it be reversible
S0282	yes
S0289	in other word you could take it out
S0282	yes
S0289	and actually that be not difficult to achieve at all
S0282	no no i don't know whether ours would be actually
S0289	well the stuff we have do would be
S0282	yes
S0289	but it be the stuff that the previous people do all that pour concrete probably wouldn't be
S0282	well i don't know apparently it be not pin into the wall apparently it be just it be just sit inside the case
S0289	oh right that's alright
S0282	which be why you have get drop in the windows
S0289	oh right
S0282	where you can actually see down but obviously you would just end up with an empty box so i don't know whether whether you would want to have just a totally empty box in place
S0289	when that build be convert in the late seventies early eighties it didn't have a faculty
S0282	no but then
S0289	but it have permission to do it
S0282	no but then i've hear from three different source now about how the bishop be the bishop just have a i don't know some mental aberration of find a piece of paper and break all the rule
S0289	he do he do he do
S0282	and break all the procedures
S0289	he do
S0282	whatever and i mean i i be like the guy
S0289	i think it be that typical big thing that because of all the riot in he felt oblige to do something
S0282	mm
S0289	and this vicar be exhort and say this be what need to happen
S0282	mm
S0289	without any ground for say it
S0282	no but well i mean it be the other thing as well they have the build
S0289	i know who the bishop be and that you be absolutely right it be the bishop's letter that give permission they didn't go through any of the right process and that's how they get permission to do it and actually the same bishop comment some fifteen years later on it would have be around the time we be work basically in those days we do a lot of things which with hindsight we wouldn't have do
S0282	it would be allow today
S0289	it be totally the wrong way to deal with that build
S0282	but it be another build
S0289	lift in the minute in the middle
S0282	yes
S0289	why wasn't it in one of those corner staircases
S0282	yeah
S0289	and then the build would have be much more adaptable
S0282	yes absolutely and you wouldn't have that disorientation you get when you go round and round and round you can't work out which way you be face i still have people work for me it say north i go no south they have no idea in the build which way they be face and you can't see out
S0289	yes
S0282	you know it be a bizarre really in that sense
S0289	it be bizarre
S0282	but erm but er
S0289	well it be a pig's ear
S0282	yeah
S0289	and we have make it a useable pig's ear but it be still a pig's ear it be never go to be a silk purse
S0282	no
S0289	it never be before it be start actually
S0282	no well on the inside it be very it be go to be very plain but as you say much much erm earlier in this conversation build for two thousand people so all these people replicate there oh yes we need space for two thousand but actually no we probably never need a place for two thousand
S0289	no no
S0282	never ever ever need a space to two thousand
S0289	and if you go back to the number i know it be build for two thousand because the whole of be suppose to turn up to celebrate the battle win of because of the church it never happen
S0282	no
S0289	and even though all the church in even in that middle twentieth century would close and march from for remembrance sunday it still wasn't there weren't enough for even then to fill it
S0282	no
S0289	that be never ever full
S0282	no you actually you can you can see now go through all the old photograph as well that there's nobody ever sit upstairs
S0289	no and there be so many church i could find you around the country where the gallery be never use
S0282	yes and the galleries be just junk because there be nobody up there
S0289	oh absolutely always full of junk
S0282	and never ever be anybody up there and in fact actually when they convert the the church be still on the grind floor but their offices and all the
S0289	be all around the gallery
S0282	things that they've leave be the gallery block in
S0289	yeah
S0282	so the gallery be always disposable there as well not need
S0289	yeah i know be there when they not so long after they have do it it be an awful long time ago
S0282	i still haven't get in there
S0289	it be shoddy
S0282	oh really i still haven't manage to get in there i will have to go i be go to have to go to church there or something one sunday to get in there to have a look it seem to be the only way to get in there and have a look i mean today you can't even find out who ruddy run it let alone get in contact with them or
S0289	be there a vicar
S0282	probably but i think we have try i've try in the past to go round all of them and have a look in all of them and i manage and i manage but not ever
S0289	yeah
S0282	not that you can even park in there or anything
S0289	no it be a bite mad
S0282	mm
S0289	from what it have be through have be quite interest
S0282	mm
S0289	that be the church which actually lose the arch deacon his job he be encourage to retire where a bunch of clergy this be way off i mean it may have be something when i reach be a vicar no it be after i be a vicar i hear on the grapevine they have a shortlist of candidates for be vicar there
S0282	mm
S0289	and erm they say to the and they'd interview them all and one of the members of the interview group say to the arch deacon we don't think we be ready for a black vicar yet
S0282	right
S0289	and the arch deacon then challenge them
S0282	ah
S0289	and he lose his job which he should have do
S0282	oh do he not think that he be in some kind of leadership role
S0289	i don't know what he be think he be a very nice guy in some ways i mean he be quite helpful to me when be be so shitty and he be the one who say to me go and see the bishop and the bishop be brilliant when i do see him but he have work in over the years and have come out of it with that general view that the be simple black people if you know what i mean
S0282	mm
S0289	they haven't get the brain and whatever but of course they have
S0282	ah
S0289	anyway whatever it be he make the remark go through well accept it and may have even put it in write and he accept it and go with their candidate the white guy but you know it be like a church be able to say we don't think we be ready for a woman yet but
S0282	of well a lot of them
S0282	a lot of them feel they be able to say that now
S0289	well they aren't allow to say it unless they've already previously vote to go into the stream
S0282	oh i see
S0289	doesn't happen
S0282	right
S0289	you can only be in that category if you've make a prior decision
S0282	right
S0289	which i still think be a bite of an old fudge be it worth it this be go to be interest one of the most highly recommend people to be the first woman bishop in the church of england be black
S0282	i know
S0289	i know her quite well she would be quite good i mean she would as good as any other crappy male vicar i mean bishop i don't think she will be stun in lot of ways
S0282	and what about thingy though
S0289	oh she want it like the end of
S0282	yeah
S0289	they ask her in church the other day and she say i wouldn't even think about my own she say i be pray that they would choose the right person bloody hell do she want it
S0282	well i know her when she be start out i know her in the early eighties in
S0289	in the yeah
S0282	yes
S0289	she might be i mean but i know there be a lot of women
S0282	she be nice and she be capable there's no reason why she shouldn't
S0289	she be nice and she be capable my only reason for her not have it be that she think she should
S0289	she think she be the best i mean it be like the male clergy behave like erm but be the black woman
S0282	oh right yes i've hear her name
S0289	who really really well she be the queen's chaplain at somewhere and she's chaplain to the house of i mean all sort of stuff she have get into because she's really really well present now incredibly well and i just really think it would be lovely for the church of england for their first woman bishop
S0282	i know that would be yeah that would be superb wouldn't it oh my god what's the time my car be park how strict be they with car park now
S0289	if they turn up you will always get a ticket what time do you have yours till
