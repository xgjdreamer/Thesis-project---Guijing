S0058	yeah that bookshop be weird it be kind of seem to be mistake classic for just a really old book
S0179	right
S0058	so like they have lot of you you can tell when you touch the spine of a book if it's just a plastic cover or whether it's actually leather you know an old leather sort of
S0179	right
S0058	or cloth bind and some of these be just plastic and just they be just from plastic book from the sixties of kind of dickens
S0179	right
S0058	not worth anything but they be sort of in the classic section it's kind of the place where you'll either find nothing or you'll find an absolute gem
S0179	for nothing
S0058	for nothing exactly cos they won't recognize what it be so i have my eye open for a nice tristram shandy but they didn't have any
S0179	okay need some ice
S0058	mm
S0179	need some ice
S0058	yeah
S0179	oh just look at the fat fuck
S0058	so repulsive
S0179	and it's just who think that look good
S0058	to clarify for the sake of the record we're talk about a car not a person
S0058	we're not just sizeist
S0179	uh right also to clarify it's not the obesity that affect me just the sheer repulsiveness
S0058	yes if you wanna fat car have a fat car but at least make it an attractive fat car the xc90 isn't unattractive for example
S0179	no i don't think it's attractive
S0058	no it's not massively attractive but it's not quite so repellant
S0179	but if you need an suv
S0058	yeah
S0179	well no one need an suv
S0058	yeah but
S0179	if you
S0058	if you're go to buy one
S0179	if you're delude enough to get an suv
S0058	yeah
S0179	then that's a good option
S0058	they really be very pretty
S0179	this be true oy oy now we can fff
S0058	excellent
S0179	that be a question of you don't think too much about your
S0058	yeah
S0179	wing mirror just do it on instinct
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm i'll have to look what that build be i've no idea
S0058	uh
S0179	it look like council offices or something but
S0058	right yeah interest nice place for it it be the council offices
S0179	mm
S0058	you'll actually find it's like 's maximum security prison they've get some kind of invisible electric thing round it
S0179	to be fair i'd have think it would be quite effective purely cos there be no transport link to here
S0058	yeah
S0179	you see do at least have a railway station
S0058	be that the nearest one to here
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	that or
S0058	right yeah so you you'd you know you'd struggle to get very far easily
S0179	you'd struggle to get far quickly
S0058	yeah have to hitch a lift that's why you don't let people into your car in case they're escape criminals all the best stories have an escape convict in them famous five hound of the baskervilles dickens
S0179	mm
S0058	it's all about escape convict how do you pronounce double f again
S0179	double f
S0058	yeah
S0179	i've no idea
S0058	mm there be two guy in the bookshop i don't know if you hear them um i dunno if they be talk welsh or not
S0179	yeah they be
S0058	they be yeah so strange i know kind of obviously i know it wasn't english and it wasn't like spanish or french or italian or in er i know it wasn't what it wasn't but i wasn't sure if it be welsh or not but there be so many english word that be pronounce perfectly scatter in the middle of it i assume it be welsh
S0179	mm
S0058	be it more of a big thing round here do you think like sort of mid wales and sort of quieter
S0179	no north wales
S0058	north wales oh okay
S0179	south wales it's virtually non existent
S0058	right
S0179	mid wales to some extent north wales be really
S0058	right okay
S0179	mm
S0058	okay ah go karts and paintball
S0179	mm
S0058	be that the
S0179	no
S0058	no i be gonna say this look smaller it's er
S0179	yes it be cos like to be honest all the good paintball that's your main business
S0058	yes the thing be er i'm surprise that you can just do it as a kind of smaller things just because there's so much effort you have to put into and safety be such a massive deal and
S0179	mm
S0058	so why would you bother if it be just a fairly small thing
S0179	well i suppose if you've get the facilities and the staff it kind of make sense
S0058	mm
S0179	combine the two now there you've get a winner
S0058	yes now there's a game i just think well you know in term of like if someone take their mask off and get shoot in the eye and blind er you i guess you need to make sure you're really really try for that not to happen
S0179	to be fair if you do that you've pretty much get it come as in you
S0058	mm but i mean if you then go and sue the
S0179	you couldn't
S0058	you couldn't okay so long as they've give you a mask and tell you in no uncertain term
S0179	mhm
S0058	to wear it i guess
S0179	and make damn sure of it they continue to enforce that
S0058	yeah
S0179	that's bad
S0058	what be it i didn't see
S0179	someone's turn that sign round
S0058	oh fff interest
S0179	really harsh put a speed camera at the bottom here
S0058	yeah nice
S0179	what
S0058	cow legs
S0179	yes it be rather
S0058	that's the kind of one where there's you know if massive herd of cow in middle of road stop
S0179	yeah i think that's basically how i'd er interpret it
S0058	that's yeah it's kind of hard to hard to maybe some drivers just need the light
S0179	mm
S0058	tiny little random postbox there cute
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah i mean it's just it's nowhere near as remote as ullapool and sort of northwards but get a very different feel to it it's nice
S0179	mm it's nice weather
S0058	nice weather do you say
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah it's lovely
S0179	there be a lot to do
S0058	yeah i mean there's so much more round here there's no sense of the feel of be completely kind of out of it
S0179	but no that's get its own attraction
S0058	well no definitely i'm not say it's better or worse i just mean it's just completely different even though they're both kind of i dunno yeah there's something nice about be so far from anything i guess
S0179	mm
S0058	this be more touristy
S0179	it's just so much more densely populate
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's just
S0058	yeah there's just so many more people per bite of land but even when every single soul in ullapool come out for that festival thing when we be there it wasn't
S0179	it wasn't exactly busy
S0058	it wasn't exactly busy
S0179	no i know
S0058	yeah and that must've be everyone from miles around tourists locals the tall ship yeah i enjoy that um that gig we go to it be fun
S0179	mm
S0058	well see as it's come up nice we'll sort of i suggest while that um you sit down with some ice i'll unpack the food and sort of do stuff and then in the then once you've have a chance to recover we'll go down to the horse
S0179	yes
S0058	with our er treat
S0179	never will anyone have be so please to see an apple
S0058	yeah i might actually touch them this time
S0179	oh didn't you stroke them last time
S0058	no i er just yeah they're big and get huge mouth and that
S0179	now this be where we have to persuade dad to do a interest overtake once which er we can
S0058	excellent
S0179	to be fair it move
S0058	it really do
S0179	mm as in it's not slow
S0058	no
S0179	that's what i do like about this car
S0058	it's very good it's nippy
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah it's nice that you still kind of like it just what you be say the other day about you know your kind of first car that you get when you be younger and whatever and now all
S0179	mm
S0058	it's nice that it's actually a really good car
S0179	yes it be it's get things wrong with it but it's
S0058	mm
S0179	er doesn't suffer from and so
S0058	yeah in the scheme of things
S0179	for for the purpose of sort of small runabout it's perfect
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's brilliant around the city
S0058	yes or mental aberaeron as we find today
S0179	yes
S0058	so you're out to give yourself better visibility
S0179	yep
S0058	yep
S0179	i'm just try to straighten it out cos the road
S0058	mm
S0179	weave from side to side
S0058	yeah
S0179	doesn't mean you have to
S0058	yeah so you can go just plot a plot a course down the middle of all the bend i guess
S0179	yep
S0058	then it's shorter and you can make better progress i guess be the idea
S0179	yes except not get out too far close to that junction take the speed off now again not the smoothest road
S0058	no
S0179	ah
S0058	aw he have his little hat on
S0179	mm make of the hair of the people he's recently murder
S0058	he didn't seem particularly er
S0179	hm
S0058	he wasn't be completely communicative i think
S0179	mm
S0058	isn't it quite lovely and green the
S0179	well we could potentially go down
S0058	um but i be think obviously it's er it's up to you but i be think tomorrow we're not really gonna be able to do much sort of city town wise so we could go out
S0179	beach wise
S0058	yeah to a beach wise cos that'll be open it's up to you i mean i think you should maybe go in and get some ice on that first
S0179	yeah
S0058	and we can maybe go later tonight if you want to
S0179	i think it'll be a mistake to do it more than anything else
S0058	er yeah er er i mean we can always see how we feel later on but i suggest we maybe just hang around locally
S0179	mm
S0058	and then tomorrow firstly when your leg's a bite have a chance to rest properly and also because there won't be much to do shop wise we'll go down to the beach yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	cool
S0179	i'm just think as an outside suggestion
S0058	yeah
S0179	and i don't consider it to be a particularly good runner but i will just mention it
S0058	yeah
S0179	er er but i think i sell you to a er slave ring
S0058	yeah yeah sound good i'm with you so far
S0058	where's the catch
S0179	um
S0058	it's not a great build up to a story
S0058	whoa massive dog in road
S0179	okay thank you
S0058	freaky dog in the road
S0179	poodles
S0058	yeah
S0179	i be like i wouldn't say why do i actually say thank you get your bloody dog out the road
S0058	yeah thank you for eventually remove your massive poodles out of the road
S0179	from the dead centre of a national speed limit road
S0058	anyway you be tell me about the plan and what like or be that it
S0179	er no no you you'll like it more than
S0179	um
S0058	good good
S0179	no in fairness i think it's quite good as in it be force relaxation on this stay
S0058	what the leg yes er
S0179	yeah
S0058	indeed yeah it's force us not to go drive off to mental place
S0179	mm
S0058	which i think be exactly what we need just doss about
S0179	mm again what's the speed limit on
S0179	this road
S0058	sixty
S0179	yep
S0058	oh my god well it's one of those self enforce kind of um safety things
S0179	to be fair the word that come to mind with this road isn't safety
S0058	hm
S0179	ah
S0058	oh
S0179	ah i'll just go in next to that car at the top
S0058	oh yes indeed
S0179	i can't be bother to try and
S0058	no don't
S0179	get into that space again
S0058	yeah too much effort i assume you can just park wherever you want
S0179	yeah pretty much
S0058	mm it's actually quicker come this way oh nice oo what's that bird
S0179	what bird
S0058	that bird in the thing there's a big bird with a long tail like a peacock but brown grey oo it look like a peahen
S0179	oh look at those step
S0058	oh they're cool anyway shall we er
S0179	again they seem smaller than when i be a child
S0058	yes
S0179	that's one good
S0058	shall i er
