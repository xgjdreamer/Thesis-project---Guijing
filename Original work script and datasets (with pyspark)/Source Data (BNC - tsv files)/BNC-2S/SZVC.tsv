S0325	because i think even he can tell
S0324	yeah
S0325	that 's like lower so if he tell her to play with clarinet three but she can't play with clarinet three because she's like the same grade as we be when we join and when join we be like

S0325	four
S0324	no four mm yeah i be four when no i be grade no
S0325	no
S0324	i've only do grade two four and five so i be grade four when i start wind band
S0325	yeah i be grade three probably
S0324	no be still grade two
S0324	and i do my grade four in year seven
S0325	mm so do i
S0324	mm mm
S0325	when i do grade five in the
S0324	you do it in spring i do it in the summer
S0325	mm but then you didn't do one for age
S0324	yeah cos i don't like do grade
S0325	so you get behind i don't like do grade either except i get less nervous like with every grade i do actually no i don't really
S0324	mm mm
S0325	yeah that's just have a i'll put some water in with grade five
S0324	you can finish it
S0325	i be really nervous because i i be like really not ready i didn't know any of my scale
S0325	and and he be like
S0324	yeah that's right
S0325	the piece aren't very good and then it be just it be really horrible i be really scar so i fail and my dad get really annoy cos he have to pay for it he be like if you've make me pay for that and you've fail then i'm gonna be really angry cos for grade five you have to pay like eighty pound
S0324	mm i didn't want to do my grade five then
S0325	i think i be gonna fail
S0324	but you still do it
S0325	yeah you get the same as me
S0324	yeah
S0325	the lady that do it for me be like when i do the i'm just rubbish at aural
S0324	yeah same
S0325	and i'm i'm get better i be really depress because yesterday i use to be able to like really play my scale so i practise them all the time and i be so good at them and then yesterday he be like can you play a scale i be like i can't do it i couldn't do any of them and i be so upset i be like
S0324	i
S0325	i use to know them really well
S0324	oh i never use i never know my scale i haven't do them all summer so i won't be able to do any
S0325	well i dunno what it be but something just like like flick cos before i be so bad at scale i fail i never pass my scale apart from grade three all of my scale i fail them and get like then out of twenty twenty two
S0324	i've always get around thirteen no what's the pass
S0325	for scale
S0324	yeah
S0325	fourteen
S0324	oh so i always just pass
S0325	mm
S0324	so i get like fifteen or
S0325	i just never pass and he always use to slay me for it he use to be like you do not know how to do your scale and then i'd turn up to the lesson and he'd be like erm can you play this scale i'd be like i can't remember it it's because you haven't practise isn't it i be like no i have practise i just
S0325	can't do it without the sheet
S0324	oh
S0325	that's why i be say i can't do it without the sheet
S0324	yeah yeah but the problem be scale be like get you easy mark
S0325	mm
S0324	so you really should practise them i just never can be bother to practise them because scale be so always the bore
S0325	yeah
S0324	bite of play a clarinet
S0325	and aural i be
S0324	yeah
S0325	awful at aural
S0324	i always use to be really good at the aural cos then it be just the easy question like
S0325	mm
S0324	sing back and clap back
S0325	yeah no but i be always
S0324	like clap in time
S0325	yeah
S0324	and it's sight sing and
S0325	yeah but i i be always really nervous and so they'd be like sing and i would just be like oh
S0324	yeah
S0325	but then i be really annoy because in grade six i didn't even get the clap right and the clap
S0325	be the bite i could always rely on and i'd be like
S0324	yeah
S0325	if i don't get anything right in this aural the clap i've get the clap and then it be like clap be incorrect
S0325	it be so sad so oh
S0324	i always get the begin of the clap and the end of the clap right but never the middle
S0324	because well i always use to be fine in the earlier grade but like in my grade five the clap be longer
S0325	mm
S0324	and i always forget the middle so i just make it up
S0325	mm
S0324	and then end
S0325	i don't actually think i'm gonna be able to take grade eight because if you look at the like the piece be fine because you just learn to do the piece like you can practise them
S0324	yeah
S0325	until you can do them and like scale but when it come to the aural and stuff and the sight read it's so hard
S0324	yeah then in grade eight aural be
S0325	er even in grade seven it's
S0324	it's
S0325	impossible all the stuff that i need to know he be like you need to know you need to be able to tell like what cadence it be so if you say it's a perfect cadence you need to be able to say two to five or like whatever it be and then you need to be able to like right right there you just need to be like oh yeah perfect one to five and then you need to be able to say like erm what else be it you need to be able to need to know the progression so they play a piece and it progress and so it either progress like diminish or major or minor and you need to be able to tell like
S0325	how it's progress
S0324	this be why i wish i'd do my grade with trinity
S0325	yeah like it would be so much better
S0324	because you get
S0325	and you have to sing the bass part
S0324	the same ucas point
S0325	yeah you have to sing the bass part of a melody
S0324	it's so annoy
S0325	they play you a melody and you just have to sing the bass and like you can't even hear the bass but
S0324	yeah i wish grade be just play the instrument
S0325	mm
S0324	without the aural
S0325	even though that's not really like a
S0324	yeah
S0325	a but to be honest
S0324	if the grade be like to show good a musician you be
S0325	yeah but i'm not a good musician i i can play it fine because i practise it but i don't actually know what i'm do when it come to all the technical stuff
S0324	yeah but then you'd always be like you need to practise your scale more when i do my grade eight i fail my scale and i get a distinction
S0324	it's like
S0325	but then why do i need to know my scale
S0324	yeah how's because he must have get full mark in everything else
S0325	yeah
S0324	to be able to fail your scale and still get a distinction
S0325	mm like i don't understand how but he be like i didn't know any of it when i go to music college and like how how how and then i'm like how and then he's just tell us all this stuff he's like it's easy before he'd be like gcse music be easy it's really easy like it's theory be way harder and then he's teach all this stuff and i'm like i don't understand any of this
S0324	yeah but he go so fast he's because he think it's easy
S0325	mm
S0324	it doesn't mean that everyone else think it's easy
S0325	literally he's just
S0324	so he's like
S0325	and miss
S0324	oh we should be able to get over this theory in half an hour
S0325	yeah
S0324	let's just go through it now
S0325	yeah he's literally just like miss he think everyone else can understand and we're all
S0324	yeah
S0325	we'll just be like what be that
S0324	wait wait stop
S0324	wait oh right i'm gonna look through that book
S0324	i have no idea what i be write
S0325	you can text
S0324	yeah
S0325	alright
S0324	ask her
S0325	i really
S0324	hey can you advice
S0325	i kind of think it would be cool for like the you know the group one to have like a saxophone or something but i wouldn't
S0324	like the ensemble
S0325	yeah like two clarinets and a saxophone
S0324	yeah
S0325	but like and they're like what's like grade three
S0324	yeah
S0325	and 's like grade four
S0324	need to ask
S0325	yeah i be actually consider that i be like i wonder if would actually do it with us but he wouldn't
S0325	he would not do it with it
S0324	no he
S0325	but
S0324	imagine if he do would be so jealous
S0325	yeah but that would be
S0324	we'll be like oh sorry we we're not have lunch today we're practise with
S0325	with
S0325	she'd be like can i come and listen we'd be like no sorry yeah but how cool would that be like clarinet but actually saxophone be quite jazzy
S0324	yeah
S0325	i think clarinet because if you're with like do saxophone
S0324	yeah
S0325	because then you have to
S0324	but also
S0325	really
S0324	people like when they're lower on
S0325	yeah
S0324	an instrument like the saxophone they just play really loud
S0325	i know
S0324	and they don't know how to go quieter
S0324	so it would be us like do the whole
S0325	mm
S0324	quiet and then loud
S0325	mm
S0324	and then quiet and just well would just be like
S0324	so you wouldn't even be able to hear us
S0325	but what i wanna know be
S0324	well actually probably wouldn't be as bad but i don't
S0325	well wouldn't play would she cos
S0324	yeah
S0325	's so shy
S0324	's either
S0325	she's scar
S0324	really or really loud
S0325	yeah
S0324	like really quiet
S0325	she's
S0324	really quiet
S0325	she's scar or everything mr 's like what's your name and she go
S0325	and all the teachers be like there's no need to look so scar and she's like mm
S0325	but
S0324	yeah and then when you get to know her she's not actually that shy
S0325	yeah
S0324	so
S0325	but they're like and what's your name and then even when we're in that room and they be like can you play your g sharp or whatever and 's like
S0325	i can't i can't play it
S0325	it's like it's one note but i feel i wanna know how they actually mark that because
S0324	yeah i know
S0325	because what if say you be play like what if you be really good but they be really bad
S0324	yeah
S0325	would they give you both
S0324	but that
S0325	the really bad mark
S0324	if it's like a clarinet a duet
S0325	yeah
S0324	so like if er we do it
S0325	mm
S0324	you will be really good i would be terrible
S0324	i can just pretend i'm you
S0324	and then they'll give me a great mark and give you a terrible mark
S0325	yeah but do we have to do two or can we send them
S0324	yeah i dunno it would be so
S0325	it's so confuse
S0324	much easier if we could just do one duet
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then send it off for both of us
S0325	maybe we can
S0324	yeah
S0325	but i really wanna do it before mr go
S0324	yeah
S0325	because no i guarantee no other new teacher that come be gonna let us write a log give it back them they'll mark it and then give it back to us to rewrite it
S0324	i know
S0325	the
S0324	yeah i just oh yeah
S0325	why do he have to leave like this i mean i can understand why he's leave and he's get to leave like some year he can't
S0324	yeah i know
S0325	because of the new gcse
S0324	but like couldn't he just erm er leave but then just come back part time just to
S0325	mm
S0324	teach us in year eleven
S0325	well he's do part time this year as well
S0324	because then he wouldn't have to start yeah but be be he teach oh yeah

S0325	but he say they're really they have to pay they get twenty minute lessons and they have to pay like two hundred pound per term
S0324	oh my god
S0325	cos he be like it's like twenty percent more and they only get i be like oh er so be it longer lessons he be like no the lessons be twenty minutes long because even half an hour doesn't seem that long like
S0324	yeah in half an hour
S0325	it's over really quickly
S0324	like if i'm go a piece i'm struggle on or something i can just do one piece with
S0325	yeah
S0324	in half an hour

S0324	and then in music when she be like erm so how do you do it for minors then think that she be so cool and
S0325	yeah
S0324	that no one would know that but then everyone with grade five theory
S0325	yeah
S0324	which be like a quarter of us and
S0325	yeah
S0324	we already know how to do it
S0325	and then
S0324	and then he be like so be you do grade five theory and she be like mm i'm not sure do you think i should
S0325	mm and then 's like do you think i should go to jazz band or grade five theory
S0325	and i'm like what
S0324	it
S0325	a stupid question
S0324	yeah
S0325	like do you think he's gonna say like do you think you should get a do a proper exam or go and play hawaii five 0
S0325	in monday lunchtime
S0324	yes and then like

S0324	and like
S0325	yeah

S0324	three summer soirees
S0325	yeah and that
S0324	i mean it's good it's fun
S0325	funk time or whatever
S0324	yeah like the
S0325	do she like not change her piece cos she's too scar that they're gonna be rubbish
S0324	yeah
S0325	but i don't and then what be it that and then say something and he be like start talk to her and she be like oh oh oh
S0324	and then we be and i kind of go
S0324	and then she look at me
S0325	yeah no we be laugh in the background and she turn around and she be like
S0325	that's what she be like
S0324	that's the proper evils
S0325	and it be
S0324	and then we carry on laugh
S0324	every time and she just look at us and like
S0324	it's like what be you do
S0325	just because we're give this one hour misery lesson doesn't mean we can't have a bite of fun that be like the second music lesson i be like maybe i shouldn't have pick gcse
S0324	oh
S0325	music
S0324	yeah
S0325	cos i think it would be easy i think it would be like a bite of a
S0324	i know
S0325	relax
S0324	yeah because mr 's there
S0325	yeah
S0324	it would have be easy
S0325	but then also like i didn't realise there be so many like components to the exam he be like
S0324	i know
S0325	ao1 ao2
S0324	as soon as he start
S0325	ao3 ao4 i'm like what's what
S0324	as soon as he start explain it i think we only have to do one performance
S0325	i know so do i
S0324	and one composition
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then there's like a genre of composition a that creative task i'm
S0325	oh
S0324	dread that
S0325	yeah
S0324	i'm so scar
S0325	thing be
S0324	like
S0324	to get have just a melody and then have to come up with a composition in forty minutes
S0325	and then five minutes
S0324	and then perform it in five minutes
S0325	like why but and he's like but the thing be the er sixty percent be that stuff but if you get sixty percent you get a c but it's hard to get a a star because you have to do really well in the listen and the creative task
S0324	yeah
S0325	or you can't get an a star but he be like hopefully he be like you'll you'll get sixty percent in the er listen paper i reckon i'm like be really like it must be really hard if he say that
S0324	yeah but also be a hundred percent
S0325	yeah
S0324	for those two aos one and two like the perform and compose log i mean no way be you be gonna get a hundred percent
S0325	no
S0324	for those
S0325	and
S0324	oh
S0325	but he mark them and he's like i'm a really tough marker and i'm like well that's great isn't it
S0324	yeah he's like i'm gonna hold your hand
S0324	i'm gonna make sure you get a hundred percent but i'm a really tough marker
S0325	yeah
S0324	it's like oh mm
S0325	but surely he can just give us all those star cos he mark
S0324	yeah
S0325	sixty percent of
S0324	yeah exactly
S0325	the exam
S0324	he could just say oh a hundred percent and a hundred percent and a hundred percent
S0325	yeah and give like some people ninety nine some people a hundred
S0324	yeah
S0325	so it look more like less
S0324	whereas ninety nine
S0325	dodgy
S0324	ninety eight ninety seven
S0325	yeah
S0324	ninety nine
S0325	hundred
S0324	hundred
S0325	but i really be stress out but hopefully if we can get i wanna do basically i really hope we can do all of that erm stuff that he mark this year maybe if we do the compositions this year that's everything isn't it
S0324	yeah but i don't think we're gonna do both compositions this year
S0325	mm no but once you've do one maybe you know how to do it but then the genre composition sound really hard
S0324	i know
S0325	actually to be honest just composition sound really hard
S0324	yeah
S0325	like just come up with a piece just randomly
S0324	yeah how be you because then at least with the creative task you get like a begin
S0325	yeah
S0324	or something to work on with that
S0325	you get nothing
S0324	like the one where you have to just compose for your instrument
S0325	yeah
S0324	without not the genre one the other one
S0325	yeah
S0324	that one how be you suppose to do that there be so many possibilities i don't know what to do
S0325	but
S0324	i'll just end up like accidentally copy a piece that i always play
S0325	yeah
S0324	on my yeah
S0325	but surely you could just a do a piece
S0324	yeah
S0325	and nobody would notice actually they would notice as long as you don't do a famous piece or just get him to compose a piece for you and you can play it
S0324	yeah yeah
S0325	but then also the one person on that thing that we be listen to he be do like these really hard twiddly bits that he couldn't actually play i'm like why would you put in those bits if you can't play them like surely that just but then you have to you can't make it too easy
S0324	yeah that be wasn't it
S0325	yeah you can't make it too easy otherwise
S0324	i would make mine too easy
S0325	yeah i will make mine too easy it will just be like b g e b g
S0325	and then oh god and then that log as well he be like it's really simple you write about your composition i'm like what do you write about your composition
S0324	and then write what you've add and why you've add it
S0325	yeah but i don't actually know
S0324	you
S0325	what you're mean to write
S0324	i've add these twiddly bits
S0324	so it sound like it's much harder than it be
S0325	twiddly bits to replicate the song of bird
S0325	in the morning in the
S0324	yeah
S0325	samba district
S0324	and like film music when it's just but it's like show something that's happen er yeah i'm not do
S0325	yeah
S0324	film music as my genre
S0325	no i'm do
S0324	i'd love to like
S0325	a cappella
S0324	do how do you do a cappella though
S0325	yeah something like african er what be it african a cappella
S0325	yeah but how would you do that like compose it you have to write underneath
S0324	i dunno
S0325	the note
S0324	yeah but then how do you record it because be you allow to get other people to sing it
S0325	no you can do like a voiceover cos it
S0324	so like
S0325	do that
S0324	yeah
S0325	no but do you actually have to record that one yeah
S0324	yeah
S0325	no you don't
S0324	yeah i think so
S0325	because there's a composition
S0324	competition
S0325	erm the the group performance there's only two performances
S0324	yeah but i'm i'm sure you also have to record your compositions
S0325	oh yeah
S0324	cos like with the performance one you perform a piece
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then you compose a piece for your instrument and then you have to
S0325	oh perform that
S0324	perform that as well cos the ones we listen to be the compositions for their instrument
S0325	yeah but do you have to perform the genre piece
S0324	i think so i don't know
S0325	yeah but do hers where she erm
S0324	yeah i wasn't sure about those
S0325	she do like harmonies over the top yeah i'm not sure about their record
S0324	yeah
S0325	to be honest it just make everyone sound really bad like
S0324	yeah i know
S0325	the singers
S0324	cos it's
S0325	it's like echoey
S0324	yeah
S0325	and even who's like the most amaze singer in the world she didn't
S0324	she didn't yeah
S0325	sound that great at all
S0324	she's a little bite i don't know
S0325	like
S0324	it just make it all a bite too like
S0324	crisp
S0325	yeah
S0324	in a weird way
S0325	i didn't really like it but she still get an a so well cos he mark it
S0324	yeah
S0325	so
S0324	erm and that rock one with the person just play the bass guitar and just overlay it
S0325	mm and he give it
S0324	i wasn't sure about that
S0325	full mark
S0324	and he be like oh i love this i give this full mark
S0325	yeah
S0324	it's like mm not not quite the sure about that
S0324	so know me i'm gonna do one that i'm really proud and he's gonna be like mm
S0325	mm
S0324	yeah not sure about
S0325	the performance one be the one that's the best one be the easiest one just your performance cos you can just do any piece
S0324	mm
S0325	yeah you could do one of your like grade six piece
S0324	oh
S0325	cos you get mark up about how hard it be and how
S0324	yeah so i need to do like
S0324	a grade eight piece
S0325	or he say grade seven be
S0324	yeah
S0325	seven
S0324	so i need to do a grade seven piece
S0325	you can do a grade seven piece do the same piece as me
S0324	oh god
S0325	be you allow to do that do the same piece as someone else
S0324	dunno i could just get you to record it and pretend it's me
S0325	yeah but my piece that i'm do for grade seven be actually not that hard
S0324	we could
S0325	it's like seven page long
S0324	we could like both record it
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then when everyone's go home i can quickly change the title
S0324	and say that my one be yours and your one
S0324	be mine
S0325	no you have to dupe it so that we both have mine
S0324	no because then they'll know that it's the same so i'll just make yours mine
S0325	yeah but then
S0324	and mine yours
S0325	yeah but what if mm but what if yours isn't very good
S0324	yeah that's the point
S0325	yeah but yours will be good so that's fine i'll have yours
S0324	no
S0325	don't you want me to have yours or
S0324	no it'll be terrible
S0325	no it will be good
S0324	no it won't
S0325	yeah it will
S0324	no it won't
S0325	no because the guy that who write them they're not actually that hard or they're quite hard i can't play them but they're not actually that hard
S0324	they be
S0325	no they're no i mean er they're not that hard
S0324	yeah
S0325	but i can't play them
S0324	why not
S0325	because i find them hard
S0324	yes so they be hard
S0325	yeah but this be it but like
S0324	they're not hard but i find them hard
S0325	yeah but mr be like yeah these aren't hard but i find them harder i can't cos i can't play them
S0324	mm
S0325	i find everything hard
S0325	well frère jacques
S0324	yeah
S0325	do you remember when we do the composition and then you mess up the like time it be like
S0324	yeah cos i
S0324	i like erm
S0325	you try to quantise it
S0324	be it i quantise them all
S0324	and all of them quantise right apart from one who like
S0324	they make it half time slower
S0325	mm and then you try to do like the whole thing where you have to get it up and then try and like change everything and it mess it up and then you i be like can i listen to it and it be like really badly quantise and you be like it's not in time and i be like no no it be
S0324	you be so mean
S0324	you just laugh at me
S0325	yeah but it be really funny cos you be like no it's it's no it's really not that well in time and i be like no i'm sure of course it's in time and it be like
S0325	and and it be really
S0324	and it be just like frère jacques
S0324	it's not that hard
S0324	if i have just leave it how i record it would have be more in time
S0324	than after i'd quantise it
S0325	it wasn't as bad as 's
S0324	oh thank
S0324	that's a real compliment
S0325	no do you remember when
S0324	with the
S0325	we be listen to 's
S0325	and we be like
S0324	mm mm well that's really good
S0325	really good
S0325	and then when we go off and do our little
S0324	i'm surprise she's not take music
S0325	i know
S0324	i would have think
S0325	laugh at her
S0324	er do she do erm and then we ditch and to do song
S0325	and then we didn't even do that song and we didn't even sing
S0324	and we didn't even sing we
S0325	we didn't do anything
S0324	all of those things we didn't finish
S0325	we didn't do anything
S0324	like the other composition
S0325	we be basically like
S0324	one we have to do
S0325	we're too good for music
S0324	yeah yeah like that one the musical futures even though we be like really look forward to it
S0325	we be like we're not sing
S0324	and we didn't even do it
S0325	because we basically just think we be too good
S0324	cos we waste we waste half the time with
S0324	and just
S0325	yeah
S0324	discuss who's gonna sing what part
S0325	to be honest now i don't feel so bad cos for be like no we don't really want to be with actually you probably don't feel so bad
S0324	what do you mean
S0325	well you you be like we don't really want to be with you
S0325	don't feel so bad now cos i'm really glad we with her
S0324	yeah because they're imagine she'll think we're like best friends now
S0325	she think i be her best friend in french cos i talk to her and then i realise that talk to her be a really big mistake
S0324	oh just please don't laugh at me when i get them wrong oh my god
S0324	we'd never laugh at you how why what kind of monster
S0324	do you think i'm be
S0324	i would never laugh at you
S0325	and anyway you'll do so well because you're so clever okay i didn't realise miss take her vocab test so seriously
