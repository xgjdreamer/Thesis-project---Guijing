S0336	exactly never mind
S0362	that's just that's unfortunately that's the nature of the beast innit
S0336	exactly or we
S0362	i have the same we have the same trouble with a with like a big group of us if a few of them can't make it you like we have we all try and push it like oh you know we'll still do it we'll still do it like
S0336	yeah
S0362	there's only three of us in fact two of us really
S0336	yeah
S0362	and there be another lad that we know from uni that know more than i do but you know better
S0336	yeah
S0362	than i do but he be still my year but you know association a bite
S0336	yeah
S0362	erm but we're like now i'm still gonna do it cos if you don't you just don't see each other
S0336	exactly and that's like we go months and months and months without see each other so like we saw each other in december and that be the first time i'd see them since like april that year because erm i ask them all to come down like a few time like when i buy the house and stuff like that and they just didn't make an effort and then erm they all go to the weekend i be in bestival but they invite me like two weeks beforehand and i be like either you guy have like somehow just wing it so that you're all free or this have be a plan for age and you've only just invite me like it be really weird so i be like well i'm not free that weekend so like
S0362	sorry
S0336	sorry erm but like i just i dunno like i'm the first one of us to buy a house and i'm not not not in a braggy kind of way but in a like if it be any of them
S0362	you'd like try to see them
S0336	yeah and not a single one like it's an hour on the train they've get no excuse like they they act like i live miles away and i don't
S0362	an hour's really not that far be it
S0336	no and like i appreciate that everybody have their own thing go on but like to say that not a single one of them have give me a single weekend do you know what i mean or even like pop up for the day like
S0362	yeah
S0336	pathetic so
S0362	and they could do couldn't they
S0336	they could so easily like
S0362	just have some lunch and go home
S0336	exactly
S0362	it's really cheap as well on the train
S0336	that's what i've say to i be like oh i will literally come and meet you for lunch like i'll get the train down we'll spend a couple of hours have lunch walk round shop maybe and then i'll get the train home like it doesn't have to be a a huge thing every time cos like that's the other thing now be like i on the on the days that i do go up it's like it have to be this whole day thing so you're go for breakfast when we first get there and then we're walk round all afternoon and then we're go for dinner and i'm get like the last train home and i'm think like why like why be it this whole day thing where all of us end up have to spend a whole fortune
S0362	yeah
S0336	cos that's the other thing you know like if they come here they'd have the expense of the train but i'd fee them and i'd put them up whereas the other way round i have the expense of pay the train travel
S0362	and then they'd say let's go out for dinner
S0336	yeah and then i have to pay for dinner and everything as well so when i go in april last year i spend seventy pound in one day just to go and see them and i'm like that's so expensive like the least you could do be say oh if you're come here i'll host like afternoon tea or i'll make some lunch do you know what i mean like there's just nothing like none of them do it
S0362	it's the way isn't it
S0336	it's stupid it's so expensive and like
S0362	i think it's the i think that's the mentality of the of people that live there isn't it
S0336	i know and i just think like not one of them have ever offer to like buy me a drink or anything for like consider that i'd pay for like train travel and stuff like that
S0362	yeah
S0336	so
S0362	it's yeah
S0336	but never mind
S0362	that's like erm it's like i be up here have conversations with erm what i can't remember the root of it but like er right let me get it in my head cos i need to remember it's something happen
S0362	er cos er if i remember who it be erm it might have a relevance but it might be anyway talk about how people be pay for things and like erm one of the or some of the one of the lads now get marry in in america and he be like yeah boys come come over come over like it'll be class er for my wed
S0336	yeah
S0362	you're gonna be the usher yeah like sweet usher like rock over rock over make them pay for the suit hire suit hire and he make them pay for the hotel that they be stay in like the night before the night before the wed
S0336	even though they have flight to pay for as well
S0362	and for all the way to er new york for him and one of them's a lecturer so he have to like wing work off ridiculous innit and so i be oh i know what it be it be tell me about her and 's bridesmaid dress
S0336	oh right yeah
S0362	cos she they tell me that they make make her pay for the dress
S0336	er i don't really like i think that be a bite of the thing of the past like expect the bride to pay like if i could afford to buy the bridesmaid dress i would but i'd like to feel i'd like to think that whoever it be my bridesmaid would understand if i need them to pay for it do you know what i mean like i feel like that's a that's a conversation that you should be prepare to have as bridesmaid but they're be a bite awkward about the whole thing anyway it's just
S0362	be the er be the thing come up er oh yeah no i do hear actually about it
S0336	yeah hen do be
S0362	the hen do
S0336	in june erm it's all a bite annoy to be honest i
S0362	it be go to be it's sound say it be sound like it be gonna be an absolute dead dead er fish but that be clear but when her sister that be like now we need to do more things
S0336	yeah like it's a bite awkward cos like what's happen be that and have decide and like to be fair it sound like the kind of thing would like be that erm they've hire this cottage for the weekend which could be really really sweet but there's only fifteen of us which i don't think be a huge amount of people anyway erm and it's quite a big cottage from what i can gather and so and because they've pick this like top notch cottage with a hot tub and all this kind of stuff
S0362	expensive
S0336	it's quite expensive so people be pay like a hundred quid a hundred and something quid for three nights in this place right and obviously people be also have to book time off work and they're have to book the friday and the monday off work erm but what they haven't contemplate be if you be ask people to go to just like a house for the weekend you've get to put some serious plan into like keep those people entertain for the entire weekend and people be kind of sort of say like oh you know like i'm on a budget i can't do load i can't spend load of money so and have be try to come up with different ideas to like do things on the cheap erm but one of their activities that they be suggest for us to do during the day be to go quad bike which most of us like be like oh that sound quite cool but it be fifty pound per person which be quite a lot of money erm so a lot of people be like no i'm not gonna do it so before you know it they be like oh we're gonna have to we'll have to get rid of the quad bike so then people be like oh so what be we gonna do instead and people start suggest things and and be get really tetchy then cos people be kind of like take over or sort of say you know like one person will say something and if a few people like it you've suddenly get a whole group of people that be go oh yeah we should definitely do this
S0362	like oh shit that's that's my idea
S0336	exactly so it's just a bite awkward so erm i don't know i think and have kind of take the rein back a little bite now but i just don't know what it could be a really nice weekend but i think it's gonna be quite cliquey in that like people will stick to the people that they know
S0362	yeah
S0336	erm and i think it will i think it could be a bite bore at time so i think you will have people go off and like you know i can imagine 's mum and maybe go off for a walk if they want to go and explore a little bite and they might have a couple of stragglers with them but then other people might wanna stay in and play game or do you know what i mean i think it's gonna be a bite of a weird one but like
S0362	that could be nice though
S0336	i think so i mean what i don't really understand be like
S0362	or or they should allow what i would do in that situation like right you know there's er this morning or till three o'clock
S0336	do what you like
S0362	you can do what you like
S0336	yeah
S0362	you you can go away and and explore
S0336	and i think you need to do that for a whole weekend like you can't plan like forty eight fifty eight odd hours' worth of entertainment it's stupid you might as well say like oh so this morning like erm you can do whatever you like here's a couple of things you could do in the local area or you can just do whatever you want but like what they've do be they've pick the cottage because it's pretty and they've not really look at the location so what they've do be book the place and then look at the location and think oh
S0362	shit there's nothing there
S0336	there's nothing here and it's you just wouldn't would you like if you be gonna pick a nice cottage you'd probably make sure that a there's some either a nice walk or like there's some sort of activity that you could do but there's nothing
S0362	but
S0336	apart from this quad bike yeah nothing and it's awkward as well cos like they've pick somewhere that's three hours away from here but kind of in the arse end of nowhere so everybody's get to drive and you've get fifteen people that don't all know each other like try to coordinate lift so like some be go down early some be some be go down late like and then because they're stay in a cottage they want to do a massive food shop and take food with us so they're charge everybody x amount for food but obviously they're gonna effectively dictate what people be eat for the weekend i'm just like oh it's just awkward they've they've they've give themselves a really tough job
S0362	in that situation again what i would do be i'd take i'd go i'd make sure i've get erm a cook breakfast for every day che che che easy
S0336	yeah
S0362	everyone can have what they want of that lunch i would just get load of bread and
S0336	sandwich fill
S0362	just sandwich fill
S0336	yeah
S0362	and they can just make that and for and for tea you just do like buffet
S0336	yeah or you could even like cos there's fifteen of us you could just like divide people into group and sort of say right on night one these people be cook so between now and then like think about what you wanna cook and then send us a list and we'll add it to the shop or whatever so then every night you've get different people cook it's just hard yeah i'm leave them to me and be stay well and truly out of it like it get so cringe cos like
S0362	oh no
S0336	cos like
S0362	i can imagine them hat life
S0336	yeah and like be start to like demand strippers and shit like that and you're just like oh that's so
S0362	be
S0336	yeah and you just think like it's 's hen do i can't see find a stripper funny and also strippers be awkward at the best of time but more awkward when you have to like get them to come to your house like it's not as if you're like out in a club and it's a bite funny like they come into a cottage of fifteen girls like that's not enough of crowd for it to be the
S0362	not the most outgo group of girls
S0336	no and i'm just like we're not
S0362	with you lot with your girls
S0336	yeah
S0362	then i would
S0336	you could see it
S0362	cos it would just be bad like
S0336	exactly
S0362	they'd just they'd just like take the piss out of him
S0336	it's just not the right group of people at all and it's just
S0362	be it gonna happen
S0336	i don't know i think they've actually opt for a butler in the buff which i think be actually more awkward so some mate who's gonna serve us cocktails naked or with a like a little apron on yeah
S0336	it's so weird
S0362	so we're go to we're do a similar sort of thing for 's birthday with all friends we're go to
S0336	what a butler in the buff
S0362	yeah that's it
S0362	no we'll get a stripper
S0362	that's what be it or be i i just literally make that up it be must have be a strange day then
S0336	i be gonna say i hope not no i think he's in bed
S0362	erm we're go to for just for like a few days
S0336	oh that'll be nice yeah
S0362	so all all her friends in the couple be all go
S0336	that's quite cute
S0362	er so that'll be good so we're we're go that sort of over a weekend
S0336	yeah
S0362	i think we we're pay i think what be it like sixty or yeah sixty pound each for like a few days or something
S0336	for a few nights that's really good
S0362	so i think
S0336	so what be it at the end of next month be it
S0362	yeah in the march i feel a bite pressure though cos obviously like i know it's my girlfriend's birthday so like i'm gonna have to be a bite like
S0336	yeah
S0362	host ish
S0336	i know
S0362	it's a bite weird innit
S0336	how many of you be there
S0362	there's fifteen of us go
S0336	that's quite a lot so who's the odd one out
S0362	er i think there's a few
S0336	oh okay so it's not everybody who's in couple
S0362	no
S0336	okay
S0362	or the or well no one of the girl's fella be in the marines i think er and who use to go out with
S0336	yeah
S0362	it's not she's get a new fella i think he's in the marines and then there's oh who else be go actually but yeah anyway whatever the situation be it'll be fine because they do they're them lot be be fine like they
S0336	yeah
S0362	do things like all the time so so it'll be good so it'll be a good laugh
S0336	fair enough
S0362	so that's in march in bite of a so it mean that's like the start of my week off so that'll be nice
S0336	that'll be nice yeah

S0362	so he's like he's shout out like erm they they be like cos they're quite quiet that group so they're like there be three of them so they're like what key be we gonna play so and like and they be like yeah that work and they be like yeah you're gonna be yeah yeah yeah cool it be like and you could tell him like work it out in his head like and then oh shit i could somebody tell me like the first word of the song
S0336	yeah
S0362	and then somebody like yeah like no one could know
S0336	didn't know
S0362	no one know so someone get it up on google
S0336	yeah
S0362	and they like start like preach the lyric to him and he be like yeah i get it i get it i get it and then he just sing it quality like
S0336	that's so good
S0362	and he mix it with another song with a drake song
S0336	yeah
S0362	er so like the drake song be the erm like the the the chorus
S0336	yeah
S0362	but they're really quite they be they're like so folky so they're like
S0336	yeah
S0362	just these three lads but one play the banjo sometimes there's three and
S0336	that's quite cool
S0362	there's three and it's like three guitars
S0336	yeah
S0362	you should listen to them
S0336	yeah i'll have to
S0362	their i think their album's only like eight quid
S0336	really
S0362	on erm on on itunes
S0336	yeah
S0362	er and just proper we proper get into them er and it be class and we think we're gonna get we could get er another gig of theirs for cheap before they go over fifteen quid
S0336	big yeah
S0362	so we think we've get like enough in us to to do that cos i saw ed sheeran for for a tenner
S0336	yeah i'm glad you saw him when he be small
S0362	like he rock he rock it like and
S0336	yeah
S0362	but
S0336	i remember you go
S0362	like it wasn't er yeah cos i i pop in to see you before
S0336	yeah
S0362	didn't i but i saw him just as he be like be absolutely
S0336	break yeah
S0362	nail on the radio and it be unbelievable and then obviously now i've see them i hope that er erm greg jam have him on song song of the week
S0336	yeah
S0362	a couple of months back so hopefully like they'll make it but i'll probably get
S0336	yeah
S0362	get another gig in there but
S0336	yeah it's a weird one isn't it cos when you find a band that you like you're like you almost don't wanna share them like obviously you want them to be successful but like they do like ed sheeran now i would never bother go to watch him like why would you wanna go and watch him in an arena that's not really his that's not where i think he do his best work like
S0362	no where we obviously rock city
S0336	yeah
S0362	like obviously you can hear everyone sing
S0336	yeah
S0362	and like he can hear everyone shout at him he's just like
S0336	yeah
S0362	and you know you can imagine the atmosphere and
S0336	and watch him with his like the whole the his whole performance be like how he can play with the pedal and like all that kind of stuff like it's not really like to me
S0362	the stadium
S0336	it's not a stadium thing no
S0362	but it i don't think he like it either
S0336	no
S0362	but it it but he
S0336	he need
S0362	have to because
S0336	yeah
S0362	if it like the the amount for him be so big
S0336	yeah
S0362	and so great that he's almost like literally throw money away if he
S0336	yeah
S0362	can you imagine
S0336	doesn't do it
S0362	how much how much he'd have to give for everyone
S0336	exactly
S0362	to see him he'd be stupid go to rock city
S0336	yeah
S0362	like
S0336	exactly
S0362	he'd sell out five minutes you're think well i need to play somewhere bigger
S0336	yeah
S0362	and he's literally a stadium isn't he so
S0336	i know he's huge now but erm
S0362	so like i'm all about erm like as i say to before those sort of gigs you have to pay the initial
S0336	yeah
S0362	price to actually get cos you like support band be the ones
S0336	yeah
S0362	you that you like so you pay big to see someone big and like like right support band
S0336	yeah
S0362	like the first one on be they any good like sweetness like
S0336	yeah
S0362	crack on
S0336	that's where you need to yeah
S0362	like i saw scroobius pip erm support er mark ronson when i be like eighteen
S0336	yeah
S0362	and then he go on to have like a few track
S0336	yeah
S0362	little things like that oh i mean i didn't really like like him but
S0336	but it's yeah but it's worth keep your eye out with that kind of thing though but yeah we haven't we be so like unimpressed with bestival like i'm i'm really like not that fuss about do a festival this year when i saw those ticket i be like they're they're pretty spot on
S0362	it's the longest day though
S0336	yeah i imagine like when i book book them today i couldn't really decide whether i be gonna bother try to like find a hotel for us or whether we would just come straight back but i might just do it as a day cos i don't really wanna have to take more time off work like
S0362	but you be it be it a weekend
S0336	it's a sunday
S0362	oh be it
S0336	mm so like
S0362	you might wanna take like well you don't know yet do you you don't have flexible things in the week
S0336	no exactly but erm cos like part of me be a bite like oh you know if we stay on the sunday night we could just explore london the next day
S0362	we i it be quality but you know when you just
S0336	a long day
S0362	feel like
S0336	yeah
S0362	dirty
S0336	yeah
S0362	basically er if you go to that gig you'd go home and just crash
S0336	yeah
S0362	whereas like we go home like we get a we have like we be on the train back
S0336	yeah
S0362	get up the next day we be like oh we're home friday crack on
S0336	yeah
S0362	it be definitely the best thing to do come home but but i be knackered cos obviously we get the like one of the first train in the morning
S0336	yeah and like the last train back
S0362	and literally the last train back
S0336	yeah
S0362	and erm who be play somebody big be play in er hyde park that day so it be like the train be absolutely ram
S0336	ram yeah
S0362	who's erm fearne cotton's the fella's then
S0336	ronnie wood
S0362	yeah what's his band
S0336	er the stone no
S0362	yeah the roll stone
S0336	yeah
S0362	that's it they be play in hyde park so like
S0336	oh christ
S0362	you can imagine the state of the train
S0336	yeah
S0362	i think i be asleep right next to the door i be just knackered
S0336	but yeah erm we don't have like holiday plan per se i think we're umming and ahhing about whether to go to cornwall for like a few days at some point erm my mum buy us like erm one of those like activity for two voucher type things and really want to go and do the eden project
S0362	yeah
S0336	so we think about maybe head there over the summer but like it's probably like
S0362	that's pretty old school
S0336	if i know
S0362	forget about that
S0336	exactly but if you're go to like if you're go to the uk you kind of need to go like june like july or august september cos you want it you want to take a stab at it be warm don't you erm so like i
S0362	and you almost have to a little bite
S0336	exactly
S0362	things to do that but seem a bite daft cos you don't
S0336	no
S0362	but you're like it's nice to
S0336	and it's sort of but the thing be it's such a big journey down there for like we've ummed and ahhed about it but we can't really pinpoint like whether we'd go erm but we're not gonna go abroad this year i don't think
S0362	trouble be when you do all the like all do all the maths and blah blah blah you can literally get abroad
S0336	for the same price
S0362	for a week for the same price
S0336	yeah like we for five nights like when i first have a look for five nights like self cater in in cornwall it be come up at like five six hundred pound which er which be how much we pay to go abroad last year
S0362	it what five or six hundred pound for the couple
S0336	we yeah it's so yeah so we pay we pay five hundred and something pound each to go on that neilson holiday last june and this cornwall place be like five hundred pound for like self cater accommodation but then obviously you'd have food and all your activities on top of that whereas like we we be
S0362	all inclusive
S0336	all inclusive
S0362	so that's the thing like you add it up and i take away we go when when where do we go to marbella or just outside and i literally must have get we must have go for no more than four hundred quid
S0336	yeah
S0362	five hundred quid
S0336	you can
S0362	all in like
S0336	yeah
S0362	er we be at a self cater as well so like i find hotels
S0336	yeah
S0362	hire car
S0336	yeah
S0362	so then you're like well i might as well go abroad
S0336	yeah and that's the annoy thing like we we think we be gonna stay in the uk and to save money as in like there's load of other things we could do with that money like at some point we're gonna probably wanna do a big trip to america so like you know in the back of my head i'm think like over the next couple of years we're gonna have to start save some money somewhere erm but like you say like you end up spend just as much stay here in the uk as you do like go abroad somewhere
S0362	cos you'll have you'll have dinner you're like
S0336	we're go to erm we're go to copenhagen in a couple of at the end of april
S0362	yeah
S0336	with some of his mat and it's literally cost us like forty quid for the flight and like eighty quid each for the accommodation three nights three days copenhagen cos you can
S0362	and why wouldn't you
S0336	exactly
S0362	that'll be class
S0336	so i don't know i think
S0362	and like use to do that amsterdam
S0336	yeah
S0362	almost you you can do it even if you're
S0336	i think we're gonna do a few more trip like that hopefully this year like do like long weekend because they just seem to be like you can do it's a long enough time away to feel like you're do something but
S0362	yeah and and you only have to have two days off work
S0336	exactly
S0362	and
S0336	cos the thing be with the like it sound really depress but when you take like a whole week off to go abroad like you be knackered when you get back because like you've take five days off work but you've be away for seven
S0362	and you've probably just get back
S0336	yeah
S0362	so like you're knackered
S0336	yeah you've literally just get back and then you've get to go straight back to work
S0362	yeah
S0336	it's like oh okay
S0362	yeah i know you almost need a few more days to

S0336	no well he's i don't really get it like i don't i can't seem to he he's obviously worry about work and stuff but i honestly can't seem to stress to him enough that it's just not worth it like make sure you take a break like even during the day like he'll come home with like oh i literally haven't move all day and i'm like that's so bad for you like no wonder his back hurt

S0362	yeah
S0336	and then like they're plan to fly over to sydney and do other things or whatever
S0362	okay
S0336	erm so apparently and sort of suggest like oh well we could go to thailand for the week you're in perth for the wed and then we'll come and meet you in sydney and apparently like be all like yeah yeah that sound cool like that would be really cool and sort of have to say like you know it would be nice to do something like just us two cos i didn't realise that every holiday they've be on
S0362	with somebody else
S0336	yeah be with either his family or his friends and this year they're also go on a
S0336	family holiday with her family
S0362	i feel like she's a bite stick sometimes
S0336	yeah but she doesn't she doesn't seem to like stick up for herself in that respect
S0362	no
S0336	but like
S0362	but like she's never do that
S0336	no
S0362	we know she's not she you know she just do easy life
S0336	like i like but he hasn't make like to say that to say to look at her relationship with and for example like he hasn't get that relationship with any of us like i know he like us i know he get on with you and stuff but would you count him i wouldn't count him as a friend
S0362	no
S0336	necessarily he's still very much 's boyfriend
S0362	yeah
S0336	whereas like i think she like she's genuinely build up relationships with his family and his friends and stuff
S0362	so be genuinely her friend
S0336	yeah
S0362	and don't ever do anything well you'll probably have to but you'll you've get to do it once cos
S0336	yeah
S0362	she's a bite of a character
S0336	erm but yeah and i just think like i think it's a massive shame but she's she's like when we be talk about do something even for her birthday she be talk about want me and you there and and there and like she didn't mention any of the girls
S0362	she's
S0336	she's just not bother
S0362	she and she's give up cos she know how nasty they've be to her and that you know that they they can she she know they're talk behind behind her back
S0336	yeah she's just she's distance herself so much though like since she get with she just stop make an effort with anyone like
S0362	yeah she she do but then like it become a point where i think people be genuinely not nice to her and like when when she turn up they're like or like when she bring obviously to that our meal obviously and you know how how cheese off get at that meal
S0336	oh with
S0362	well just
S0336	oh with the oh with them like whisper

S0362	and erm and and be like like i i i genuinely can't be bother with it
S0336	mm
S0362	i i can't be bother with them be the way they be
S0336	i'm a little bite worry for her just in that though like i i appreciate that she think she's be like the bigger person sort of say like oh okay i i just can't be bother with it like
S0362	and i can understand why yeah
S0336	i i don't wanna mess around and stuff but my fear be that if anything go wrong she's completely and she's completely cut herself off from people like she's gonna be like pretty lonely like in term of friends like i know she get on well with her uni mat and stuff but she's literally get like
S0362	me and you and
S0336	me
S0362	and
S0336	yeah
S0362	but then then you think who else do you need
S0336	yeah i suppose
S0362	do you know know what i mean like think about
S0336	yeah
S0362	like me i i've only get you that i speak to here and 's not even here anymore and some cricket like the cricket boys that my you know my mat i suppose but we don't i don't suppose
S0336	cool
S0362	but that might be different but
S0336	i yeah i think i'm i'm a little bite taint cos i i love the girls like i know i know they're i know they can be really bitchy and i guess i'm it's easy for me because i've never really be a target of it i've
S0362	no not at all
S0336	never like i i've never
S0362	i remember the time i remember a time when erm when say to me like yeah people will bitch like at everyone but nobody's ever bitch to me about
S0336	no and i
S0362	and that just say it all
S0336	i i'm never the target of anything
S0362	no
S0336	like and like i know that sound stupid because talk behind people's back but i honestly like i just don't know what they'd say about me like
S0362	well er they clearly don't
S0336	and erm i love have them around and i i like the fact that they're sound really bad but they're there in the background so if i want them they're there
S0362	yeah
S0336	but if i don't have time for them then i don't have time for them but so i couldn't imagine just like cut myself off from them completely and i actually really enjoy spend time with them
S0362	well that's good yeah
S0336	but i'm just a bite i feel sorry for because like
S0362	she's their the or the target
S0336	yeah and also like i think she's almost it sound really stupid but like by sort of say like oh i can't be bother with it but then turn up every so often she make it almost worse for herself because like
S0362	yeah i agree
S0336	the time that she do turn up like she'll like she and maybe rightly so she kind of expect people to care that she's there but the people be just a bite like why should we care the one time you decide to turn up
S0362	yeah i can understand
S0336	like it's it's really awkward and i'm like stick in the middle of it because they always ask me about like even last night like she hadn't bother tell anybody else that she wasn't come so like i basically say on the girl's group like oh erm dinner at for my birthday let me know if you can make it and everybody else say yes and like just like rather than cos she doesn't wanna look bad she won't say like oh i can't make it so she just won't say anything but then it's even more noticeable so like erm today be just like question mark like ask like cos she say like oh what be you do for your birthday and then nobody reply and then she put question mark like to say like oh she's away and apparently have to like like text her to say like be you come tonight do i need to play like lay an extra place because she just doesn't say anything and then it just make yourself it i dunno that's what make her a target do you know what i mean it's really bad
S0362	yeah but like cos she's not be able to go to a few things she's probably think oh no i
S0336	it look bad
S0362	know i'm not go like
S0336	yeah i think that's what she say to as well
S0362	cos she she would cos she would just go yeah yeah i can't go and everyone will go oh shock
S0336	yeah
S0362	like oh my god you can't even go to actually i'm skint
S0336	yeah so i think she text back and be just like know i've already take her out for dinner like no i'm not come like to kind of i think she be try to stick up for herself a little bite which i don't really i don't blame her at all
S0362	yeah it's it be tough
S0336	it's awkward
S0362	it's it's not very nice but it's it well if you if that's what she want then you know
S0336	i'm happy for her i just hope i hope
S0362	i hope because she's get what you're er you're say be she's get in friendship circle with er big friendship circle with his
S0336	yeah and i still don't trust him like i know he's a nice guy but i have serious reservations like not even about him as a person i just don't i don't trust i don't trust his loyalty
S0362	mm maybe so
S0336	and he's get too many people too close to him that would lie for him like be talk about the other day and i don't know whether it's just me be really untrustworthy but obviously he go away on business a lot so it's him and stay in nice hotels in like the middle of i dunno i just don't buy it and like she like you know when the whole you know everything kick off with you know like we have a weird patch at the begin of last year because i tell her that he'd he'd see when she be away
S0362	yeah
S0336	i don't know how much you know erm so my friend tell me that her best friend erm 's ex have erm spend she basically have apparently be away for a weekend and have invite out on a night out with him and his mat so she apparently have go to and go out for drink with him and his mat but she wasn't drink erm so she give him a lift home and he try to get her to come in and stay the night and apparently they kiss so tell me this not in a bitchy way in a sort of like cos apparently i be go like oh you know i've spend a few time i've spend some time with now i'm start to really like him he seem really into blah blah blah and just sort of turn round and go like look i'm not say that it's true i don't know cos i've just hear 's side of the story but just to let you know this happen what you do with that information be up to you so i sit on it for age like i find out i find out before christmas last year and i think well i can't tell her before christmas that's a real dick move and then i find out she be spend new year with him and i be like well i can't really tell her before new year cos like that's a dick move so i end up tell her like in the middle of january and erm she be just like oh i guess i'll have to talk to him about it then and that be it and you know what 's like so she's not like she come back
S0362	bet she never speak to him
S0336	no so she never come to me and tell me tell me what happen or whatever erm so the next time i saw her she just say oh you know we talk and erm things just her story just doesn't add up like we couldn't work out what weekend she be refer to and you know he say he hasn't have any contact with her whatsoever and like like you know he sort of say like wouldn't his mat have tell me if he'd have be hang out with her and all this kind of stuff so i go and i say oh you know like i'm not say he's lie but if you want to believe that like not like that that's that's up to you erm she be just like yeah you know i do believe him and then like two weeks later she tell me she be move in with him so i be a bite like oh i'm just gonna have to like let leave you to it like you've have that conversation but she's also tell me like she's check his phone a few time which be always classy she check his phone a few time and there's be no message from whatsoever and like i i know from sort of say that they're they're in like semi regular contact even if it's just a hiya how be you what be you up to so to find absolutely zero message to me seem even more suspicious than to find like hi how be you do you know what i mean i just i just don't trust him there's something about him that i just don't don't trust and i feel bad for say that but i just
S0362	but you're right to have that as a as a friend
S0336	yeah
S0362	you're allow to have those reservations
S0336	and now she's talk about him propose and all this kind of stuff and it's
S0362	really
S0336	yeah erm i'll talk to you in a sec i'm just gonna plate up some food
S0362	i'll come i'll come really
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh

S0362	that's you're allow to be
S0336	mm
S0362	just to let you know i'm not cautious about so you're alright
S0336	ta
S0336	but
S0362	what do you eat at last night
S0336	erm have scampi and chip actually
S0362	do you
S0336	yeah erm i have actually weirdly like always struggle to find something i wanna eat on that menu like
S0362	it can be like that can't it
S0336	i mean it be a bite of a weird menu like
S0362	especially if you don't wanna spend it's too high
S0336	yeah erm it be either that or the cheeseburger
S0362	i always feel that's a disappoint size
S0336	mm i be really happy we erm they charge like cod and chip price and let us have like scampi and chip so i'm quite impress it be like ten i think actually they charge her like twelve pound and er like have load of drink and stuff as well so i didn't complain
S0362	you get a lot it's nice to know somebody be
S0336	exactly
S0362	and charge something like that
S0336	we erm
S0362	be single
S0336	yeah not much i think like she's take it in her stride to be fair but i think it be shit for her because obviously her closest friends be all in relationships now
S0362	do you know any more about the sack of
S0336	the what
S0362	that doesn't work for them anymore
S0336	no
S0362	do you know about that no
S0336	no
S0362	oh
S0336	i didn't hear anything about that
S0362	oh right
S0336	erm i actually think like i think and have actually be really annoy cos like i think i think 's try to get close with like other girls obviously because she still want to go out and she still want to meet people and stuff
S0362	yeah
S0336	you know how bitchy they be i think they're all like wind her up and like
S0362	exactly
S0336	tell her that she can't have other friends and all this kind of shit
S0362	cos they they don't wanna go out all the time
S0336	no
S0362	obviously on days and nights off she do
S0336	i know but
S0362	what as in like friends from work
S0336	yeah i think so and i think also like you know like 's love go out the only reason she's not go out be cos she's try to save some money so she probably doesn't like the fact that someone be like have a good time
S0362	do they go out regularly
S0336	erm
S0362	i've not go out in town for years well
S0336	they use to go out
S0362	about a year
S0336	fairly regularly they don't now anymore
S0362	they're not
S0336	no
S0362	so how's 's house have you have you see it
S0336	erm i have see it but only briefly erm i pick her up when we go to in october but
S0362	yeah
S0336	i haven't actually see it
S0362	have be live there
S0336	yeah i think so
S0362	be still with yeah
S0336	mm
S0362	how's that be for her i don't think it'll last personally but
S0336	i don't think she even want it to last like i think it's keep her occupy at the moment i think she like have someone to spend time with
S0362	yeah
S0336	but i don't think i don't think he i don't even think she see him as like long term
S0362	boyfriend material
S0336	no
S0336	like even last night she be like we be talk about her birthday in may apparently she's have like a great gatsby theme like garden party type thing
S0362	sound cool
S0336	yeah and she be like oh don't remind me i'm twenty five blah blah blah and i be like why do you care like twenty five be no worse than twenty four be it and then say oh it's because erm she'll be twenty five and will only be twenty i'm like well i don't really see why that's a huge problem but i don't know
S0362	only it's only a problem if everyone give you stick about it
S0336	mm
S0362	this be amaze by the way
S0336	yeah erm well i be just think like if it bother you now it's always gonna bother you like at what point do you think oh actually the age difference doesn't bother me anymore
S0362	probably will yeah
S0336	so and she's make comment to me before like oh you know he still want to go off and do things and i'm settle and all this kind of stuff and i'm like well you know his plan could change like
S0362	and he be twenty so you can
S0336	yeah
S0362	that's like if you think about what you be like
S0336	exactly
S0362	you be like your second year at uni at twenty
S0336	erm but yeah she's keep him i mean he's keep her occupy for now and i think she's get so much on at work i think she probably like have a really easy relationship like
S0362	cos he's get no like
S0336	yeah
S0362	experience to say look actually do something
S0336	exactly like she doesn't need someone who's gonna plan their future because she's just try to work out stuff
S0362	hers
S0336	herself yeah
S0362	yeah i live with god
S0336	that'd be i mean like she'd be a nightmare every time you have a bill like like i can just see her be so picky and stuff and like try to get out of any extra cost it's an awkward one though cos 's do a favour in that obviously whatever she pay be help pay off her mortgage
S0362	yeah
S0336	so i think the i think they both pay like three hundred pound a month or something and that's their that's their mortgage and their bill so it's cheap for even cheaper for cos she's laugh like she's get somebody else pay off her mortgage for her but
S0362	yeah how would do you like you do know that if you move in with me like i will be sort of like use your money to
S0336	yeah
S0362	pay off my mortgage you can do it the option's there but i don't ever want to think like oh my god i you've get so much money and i haven't
S0336	yeah it's awkward and i don't know you know like if it get to a point where think oh all of a sudden like actually i want my space like this be my house like can you get out like it's awkward
S0362	how much be her mortgage then
S0336	not a lot i don't think erm i know her her mum have like from what i can gather her mum have save that she be gonna put in a save account but that she know wasn't gonna make a lot of money
S0362	right
S0336	so instead she's put it into 's house but not into 's house in a like oh i've give you like forty grand for your house
S0362	mm
S0336	in a in a way of like when you move out you can give me that money back with whatever interest it's earn so but because of that obviously this mean that 's mortgage be a lot smaller
S0362	mm
S0336	so i think her mortgage be something like four hundred and fifty pound a month it's not a lot
S0362	so basically she's get everything for free
S0336	yeah
S0362	and she won't be pay pay badly
S0336	no i think 's on more money that
S0362	be she
S0336	cos i think she's obviously at a private school
S0336	erm cos seem a bite piss off about it
S0362	cos she's at private school that's what
S0336	she's also like obviously she doesn't do full time cos obviously like when you're in private school you're with the kid all day when you teach in sixth form or whatever you teach like
S0362	and
S0336	half the class yeah
S0336	yeah
S0362	can't resent it

S0362	what i want and but like but like it that's a stupid thing to think
S0336	yeah be you happier there than you'd be at home
S0362	well that's the other thing at home i i feel like i'm it's different
S0336	yeah
S0362	i feel like it's a quite stressful environment my mum's obviously not gonna work for so long
S0336	yeah
S0362	she go back this week so it's fine but like there's we've get a dog and three cat you know it it just get like for me it's just like i don't need it it just get
S0336	yeah
S0362	in the way and it stress me out a little bite and and i'm quite a clean like er really

S0336	yeah
S0362	er it's like oh cos we have animals it to be fair to her she struggle because there's a load of animals so it's like
S0336	yeah it's like almost not worth yeah
S0362	clean sometimes
S0336	stress yeah
S0362	yeah so you just have to it's like well the kitchen's always get stuff in it
S0336	yeah
S0362	and that's fine like i don't mind cos that's the way people live
S0336	yeah
S0362	sweet but like
S0336	it's stressful
S0362	it what it get me like
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh and and i just think that and they they ask er i like i don't like to be ask to do things
S0336	yeah
S0362	cos i'll do it but she like almost like expect and doesn't respect or appreciate the things i do do so i be very that's the reason why i be so quick to go to 's when i be like
S0336	yeah
S0362	no i can't be like and my dad be like yeah sweet just go like you we know
S0336	yeah
S0362	like i know that you know and obviously and hers like it's like but i go for mum's my parent for tea sometime you know what it's like go home for tea
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh man
S0336	it's lovely yeah
S0362	like we use to go like and i like and i like but it's lovely but then you're like right i've get to go
S0336	yeah
S0336	i i i get like think it's really weird but i i there's a moment like when we whenever we go back to either of our parents' house be i'll be really really happy and then there'll be a moment where i've just have enough and it will be such an instant moment and i'll be like right we'll go and i've literally just like it's just get to a point where i feel like no i've have enough now i've get i've have enough even but like
S0362	now it's time to go
S0336	i'm i'm ready to go now yeah and get really frustrate cos he get he get really cosy like no matter what house we're at he get really cosy and it's really hard to get him to leave but i'm the complete opposite like i really do get to a point where i'm like no i just wanna go so i do i do understand that
S0362	obviously there's a certain there's just a flipside to it yeah
S0336	just think like the the longer you and can stick it out like this the better off you will be
S0362	yeah it's fuck shit it's really tough i must admit
S0336	i'm sure
S0362	but what do you do
S0336	yeah exactly
S0362	split up go go and live at home
S0336	yeah
S0362	everyone's like why the fuck do you do that for i don't know why the fuck do i do that for i go home and get stress with no one to fee you
S0336	exactly
S0362	and think what the fuck be you do
S0336	it'll be it i think it will be better as summer come along as well because it's one of those things like during the winter everybody's in the house like everybody's kind of hibernate like you say they're in bed at before nine and all this kind of stuff like but as soon as it's nice weather you can you can do more things of an even like you know might be more incline to like go out and like even if it's
S0362	mm
S0336	just for a walk or whatever like
S0362	well we do we like we do a lot of things like that anyway
S0336	yeah
S0362	and yes i be busy
S0336	yeah
S0362	you know er at the weekend but she be very busy during the week like she gyms it er erm almost every night so there's you know if i visit you know my weekend i you know i'm not like i i would rather be do that than
S0336	yeah
S0362	you know it's not a problem that's the just the way i it work and we do lot together but you know when you just need to sit together of an even
S0336	and not do anything and not worry
S0362	well not not just that but if she go to the gym come back go and have a shower sit down we just sit down in the live room and it's quiet and we just watch tv or
S0336	yeah
S0362	we just sit and chat you just you come home from work and your conversation isn't the two of you it's four of you
S0336	yeah
S0362	so she doesn't tell me like what she's be up to she'll tell everybody so you're just like you just feel useless so generally i'll sometimes i'll sit eat my tea just like quietly and i feel like
S0336	oh bless you
S0362	so i'm just gonna be quiet no but just i might be in a mood i'm just
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh and like oh i have a shit day
S0336	yeah
S0362	it literally drive me up the wall but what do you do i'm try to save for a house
S0336	exactly
S0362	i'm run my business and i wouldn't be like imagine if i be like live at home
S0336	mm
S0362	but like still live i'd be there for if i be i'd be there for years i don't think like if if say if i be become single tomorrow i'd struggle to get out of my house
S0336	yeah
S0362	for like three or four years to save up for a house
S0336	save be hard at the best of time though like i er i don't have any money leave at the end of each month and every month i think where the fuck do all that go like i don't know like most of it go on a house one way or another but money's hard
S0362	yeah that's the thing with a house like i always feel like when you walk round the house cos yeah you like spend time and
S0336	you can always justify it
S0362	yeah
S0336	and you spend so much time here like it become your baby like i'd rather buy something for the house than buy something for me like it's really
S0362	yeah
S0336	fuck sad
S0362	but then eventually that thing will need replace
S0336	i know
S0362	so you've bring everything for your house oh oh yeah i like that
S0336	yeah i don't really like that like cos i can already see like
S0362	the little shitty things
S0336	yeah
S0362	like doormats
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh that's a really nice doormat
S0336	exactly
S0362	oh classy
S0336	it's just never end and
S0362	oh that's a really nice fork
S0336	i always find i always find like new job or or or i wonder if do you wanna do this or well or i be think about this and 's just like stop it and i'm think i've not like it like since we've move in i've not finish a room so i've like be kind of like do like little odd bits here and there and then i'll start something else and i look around and i think oh yeah i know what i want there but i can't buy that because i've start on this other room or i wanna do that in there
S0362	that's
S0336	but it take time and you spend and it cost money
S0362	just think you'd rather that than
S0336	it's a it's nice but it's just like
S0362	it's yours
S0336	like
S0362	this house be yours
S0336	yeah it be i forget that sometimes
S0362	this be you've pay out of your little pocket
S0336	yeah
S0362	somehow
S0336	but if feel like
S0362	somehow
S0336	yeah it feel like me as well
S0362	you've pay for it
S0336	i know i don't know how
S0362	it be yeah you get the feel as soon as you walk in it's yours
S0336	yeah it feel like mine and like like i i think i feel it when i go to 's cos i think like this be very different from my space do you know what mean like it's not just like cos i i don't think our house be dissimilar but when i walk in it feel very different
S0362	yeah
S0336	i'm like yeah my house look like me like well it's

S0362	things like that
S0336	they've get a erm what have they get there they've get like a little one of these
S0362	yeah i know i hear about that actually yeah
S0336	yeah
S0362	good good deal they get i know trouble with those wall be like that wall you could put something on it and you can
S0336	yeah
S0362	hang something on it couldn't you
S0336	yeah
S0362	but you or you could put if you wrap want to put a line in the middle of it or
S0336	yeah
S0362	or if you want to move that there for want that would look fine
S0336	yeah
S0362	in those ones when it's like almost a picture in itself
S0336	you can't really
S0362	you can't that's just a
S0336	yeah
S0362	dead wall there for me because there's so much go on it would just look
S0336	i know
S0362	a bite odd it wouldn't fit
S0336	it's funny isn't it like i i me and aren't really one for like we haven't get a lot of photos like not of not together
S0362	no
S0336	or like not like
S0362	they've get load
S0336	yeah and i walk round her house and there's just photos of them everywhere and i'm like oh my god this be quite intense and then i look at and i'm like be i sad that we haven't get photos i don't think i be i think it's a bite but for me it's not really to my taste to have like
S0362	yeah there you go
S0336	picture of myself plaster everywhere
S0362	there you go
S0336	but like that be like not in a mean way but
S0362	i like it
S0336	it's so
S0362	i i like it
S0336	do you like have photos everywhere
S0336	yeah yeah well not like i like the fact that they've get like in the bathroom
S0336	yeah
S0362	cos it's just er i it just cement er friends
S0336	see i have no problem with photos i think i don't like the fact that the photos be all of them i know that sound really weird but like i'd have photos of friends and family and i'd have like pretty photos but i don't think they'd necessarily all be of me and like but do a check the next time you go round like
S0362	there be a lot
S0336	they're all they're all of them all of them like they're in every single photo
S0362	yeah i
S0336	but
S0362	i don't think that's a problem that
S0336	it it's a personal thing though isn't it
S0362	er because they're not
S0336	i
S0362	they're they're not just photos of them at the house
S0336	yeah
S0362	they're actually do things aren't they but that's the person's taste isn't it
S0336	yeah
S0362	cos they look at it and go oh that be a good holiday
S0336	yeah
S0362	or whatever
S0336	i want
S0362	that be a good day
S0336	me and just aren't like that at all
S0362	no what i i dunno i think i'm probably in the mix in in the middle i'd have some but i wouldn't have as many as she's get
S0336	but she's always love photos like even
S0362	oh massively
S0336	like even when she be at uni and stuff she always have load of photos
S0362	yeah i
S0336	it's not it's not by no mean a bad thing
S0362	no this this be this be
S0336	but yeah
S0362	i see what you're say though i can appreciate it but i can also also appreciate hers as well
S0336	yeah
S0362	because you do go round and look at it and go oh shit that be good
S0336	yeah
S0362	do you remember that and you see oh our friends i dunno
S0336	i be think about this the other day though like i don't i don't remember the last time me and have a picture take together or like we haven't have like a lot of time together recently at all like cos she doesn't come out that often with the girls and stuff and then like she doesn't really invite us out or anything with her it's just so i haven't really do a lot with her recently i think she keep say to me that she want to change this year and like we're gonna spend more time together and all this kind of stuff so we'll see we'll see what happen
S0362	you can only see can't you
S0336	yeah
S0362	and if it doesn't that's not gonna affect your friendship
S0336	no
S0362	it's just like that's the friendship the way this friendship's gonna be then
S0336	exactly
S0362	well and you ain't gonna judge about it
S0336	no and the thing be
S0362	you're over judge
S0336	you know what it be you know what it's like with like i could i could not see her for months and then when i do see her like it doesn't feel like it's be months
S0362	no
S0336	so it's not a problem
S0362	no it's not and that that's what friendship
S0336	yeah
S0362	if that's what you both want out of it then you know great
S0336	yeah i suppose so
S0362	yeah crack me up it's strange she's the last person i ever think would be do what she's do
S0336	but then it also make sense in as much as like she's one of the homeliest people i know like she love she love be a housewife like she love clean she love cook and she love she love all of that sort of stuff like house make doesn't she like
S0362	yeah people walk into her house
S0336	yeah
S0362	do you know that do you know that erm one of 's friends be buy the house next door
S0336	oh i do hear that
S0336	that's my idea of a nightmare like i be say to her and i say i love you guy but like i wouldn't wanna live next door to you like i think i'd i'd start to really resent live next to you because it's that awkward moment of like you know if you're just sit there of a saturday even and you know they're er be you'd notice that they're in or whatever like isn't that awkward to not like knock on their door and be like oh
S0362	too much
S0336	too much do you want a drink or like i i dunno it's just awkward or like you know like imagine if i have friends over in the back garden in the summer and like she's just pop her head over alright oh yeah sorry i didn't invite you
S0362	what i say
S0336	it's awkward
S0362	i say like like so tonight right i've pop in to see you
S0336	yeah
S0362	imagine if you live next she'd be like well she would i know she
S0336	yeah
S0362	you she out of everybody
S0336	yeah
S0362	like we we i don't think we would
S0336	no
S0362	she'd be fume
S0336	yeah
S0362	so imagine like she saw my car park outside your house she'd be go oh so 's round 's
S0336	yeah
S0362	cheer for the invite
S0336	yeah
S0362	right well
S0362	yeah i haven't see because sometimes when we're get together as a three we don't actually get to like chat
S0336	no
S0362	we just end up like chat about group things
S0336	exactly and general chit chat
S0362	yeah do you but so sometimes it's nice she's like yeah i see what you're say
S0336	i also think
S0362	but they never it be like i mean like i'd think well that's a bite weird that 's next door and we should probably invite her
S0336	i know
S0336	you and it's it would be like that all the time and i think think this couple have a kid as well and i'm just think
S0362	yeah they do
S0336	i'm just think you guy be gonna be like
S0362	babysitting
S0336	on tap babysitters yeah if they know you're in they're gonna be like oh do you mind just like
S0362	sit in
S0336	like er yeah can you just sit in with her for an hour we just need to pop and do this it's like i dunno i just couldn't think of anything worse and also like sometimes you want to be really unsociable like a lot of the time i come from the work and all i wanna do
S0362	don't wanna talk
S0336	no all i wanna do be eat my food do whatever i want to do for that even and like it would i'd be almost piss off if someone be like knock on the door every so often go hi like completely uninvited cos you're not you're not gonna text someone and be like oh do you wanna hang out one night this week what night's good for you thursday when they're right next door to you like that's just a bite weird you're not gonna plan anything be you
S0362	no
S0336	cos then they're that's the opposite then like
S0336	you might end up not see each other at all because like it seem really weird to like have to like make plan
S0336	with someone who live next door to you
S0362	with your neighbour your best mate
S0336	yeah
S0362	it would be shit
S0336	i don't like it and like there'd be like constant competition could you imagine like if you live right next door to someone like you'd be constantly try to outdo each other you'd be look at their front garden go like mm they've let their weed grow through look at that and then like they'd be out in the garden and you're like oh their lawn look nicer than ours or like there would just be like stupid things oh they've get a new car mm you'd just get like über competitive
S0362	new car's like yours
S0336	yeah
S0362	i do know
S0336	you do know
S0362	i do know yeah i tell me that you'd get it
S0336	yeah well
S0362	how be it how be it treat you
S0336	it's really really nice it be obviously buy to help with the commute and then i commute with it for about two weeks before i hand my notice in but
S0362	but you need a new one
S0336	i need i need a new car erm
S0362	do you get much for yours
S0336	i get nine hundred pound don't know how
S0362	fuck hell
S0336	i don't know how i mean
S0362	when you buy a new car
S0336	i i basically con them into give me that much money and
S0362	and for yours you pay
S0336	erm it be five it be five five so i pay like four four six or
S0362	yeah
S0336	whatever the difference be
S0362	be it brand new
S0336	no it's erm two thousand and eleven
S0362	okay
S0336	so it's not ancient
S0362	be it the be it the model before 's
S0336	it's the model after 's mine's newer than 's
S0362	yours be the newest
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh it seem smaller
S0336	yeah erm mine's three door which be my why mine feel smaller
S0362	be 's five
S0336	yeah but mine's bigger at the front so i've get a bigger bonnet
S0362	oh yeah
S0336	a bigger body yeah
S0362	oh i should have look i dunno i just er yours look more like the older version than
S0336	yeah
S0362	than 's do
S0336	i i think i be think that the other day i saw one in the car park that be like an o six plate i think and i be like oh mine doesn't look like dissimilar to that yeah mine's i think mine's like the eco version
S0362	oh be it
S0336	so it's one point five she doesn't even know what hers be she think it's a one point four i don't know really erm but yeah they're not dissimilar but mine's mine's newer i think probably hers have a lot of mileage
S0362	yeah good though
S0336	yeah but yeah i get i get an absolute bargain like you know like obviously i have to get insurance on it and you know they ask you like the value of the car so like when you insure it and so you we tell him the make we tell the guy on the phone like the make and model of the car and age and mileage and all that kind of stuff he be like right well we've get this value as like five eight so what do you pay for it and i be like five five so i already know i'd get a bite of a good deal i'd look at all the other cars on the market there be nothing else on the market that be as
S0362	so you pay five five and then obviously take the
S0336	nine hundred quid off erm my car be not worth nine hundred they offer me six fifty to start with which be which be
S0362	alright
S0336	already generous
S0336	the car be actually worth about five hundred at a push erm so they offer me six fifty and i say look like card on the table like this be how much cash i've get so the closer you can get to that figure the better so we go away and oh we'll have to go and speak to my manager and he come back and be just like you have get yourself one hell of a deal here like i can give you nine hundred pound for your car and i'm like okay he's like be that a deal i'm like yeah
S0336	yeah that's a deal
S0336	i already know that the car be cheap and now you wanna give me a thousand pound for my car yes okay
S0362	deal
S0336	i'll sign
S0362	yeah pen
S0336	yeah so like know i'd want to look at the car and he come back and i he could see that i'd buy a car and he be like oh god she okay
S0336	how much be it and i be like well what would you like to know he be like how much how much do you pay if you pay five and your car i'll be happy right i pay four six and my car and he be like no you didn't i'm like yes i fuck do yes i do he couldn't believe it so i i felt really proud
S0362	where do you go to
S0336	er a place call in which
S0362	why didn't go with you or be he busy
S0336	erm i take the day off so it be when i go
S0362	that's risky go on your own as well
S0336	it be when i go for
S0362	good work
S0336	i know i go for my interview erm for my new job in and then i go drive straight on after that and i know it be a big like huge like car warehousy type thing so it wasn't gonna be like a dodgy like second hand place with like dodgy it be gonna be like a
S0362	mm
S0336	big jobby erm and er like i say i'd already do load of research so i know that their their price for like pretty much every model they be like the cheapest by like quite a long way like they be all really really cheap cars erm so i go and i like i say just i i actually test drive two cos i like i have my heart set on get a fiesta i really want a fiesta like a new shape fiesta
S0362	i know 's mother's get one really nice
S0336	they're really nice i really want one but they be just a little bite out of my price range like i would have have to go up nearer six which i just didn't have erm i didn't really have five me and manage to like cobble the money together erm er i end up have to like get extend my loan and all that kind of stuff but like i could not stretch to a fiesta so i saw i look at that one cos it be like similar kind of detail like the fiesta i look at be a one point six but it be diesel and a similar age similar mileage et cetera et cetera erm and that one just make more financial sense so i go with that one in the end but like
S0362	that's an unbelievable deal
S0336	if you be ever look for cars i couldn't recommend like more like aside from the fact that they they er all the cars be of a very good like price they're really good value like their people there be just so lovely like really really nice like one guy
S0362	you didn't feel like they be like push you into anything
S0336	not at all like the guy i obviously test drive both cars like the whole time we be chat and we weren't he wasn't he wasn't sell the car to me at all he be literally just like chat to me and just sort of say like like you know how do you feel like what do you like what do you not like blah blah blah erm and then as we walk in he be like do you have a preference and i'm like well i actually think the the clio's nicer inside like cos the other one be a five door as well i be like the three door actually feel like roomier in front and i'm not likely to have people in the back very often so like i almost feel like it's better to have more room for me and like my one passenger than i be likely to have
S0362	and by the way he's big
S0336	yeah
S0336	and like it be just like it be just nicer trim nicer interior cos the like the fiesta i be look be the lowest spec fiesta so it be like i could either get like a decent spec clio or like a low spec fiesta and it be more money so i be just like i actually prefer the look of that one so erm he sit me down and he be the one that kind of like negotiate the price but even then like he he be really nice about it like he come over and he say like you know like you say he offer me six fifty and i be like i know that's a really fair price cos you know i can't even unlock the back door or whatever he be like yeah and x y z and like list all the other problems that it have and i'm like yeah
S0362	you list it all
S0336	no he do cos they'd already do a check on that car erm i know there be problems like every time
S0336	i turn a corner like one of there's definitely like there be definitely like axel problems cos like every time i turn a corner it make noise so like i know it be dodgy as fuck anyway erm but yeah he manage to get he manage to get me like nine hundred pound for that car so i be dead happy with that and then he go off and then like they obviously have somebody else who actually like close it all close the deal and like sort all the payment and all that kind of
S0362	so you come back with a new car
S0336	erm i could have do they want me to drive it away there and then but i kind of like panic cos i be a bite like i can't i didn't really think it be very fair to to like do it all without speak to him so i kind of agree and then i sign whatever i need to sign and i take all the paperwork away and then i come home and speak to about it and also i need time to like sort out my insurance and all that kind of stuff so we go back the next day then to pick it up
S0362	yeah cos i bet you're think erm so you have to drive yours
S0336	yeah so i be like
S0362	drive yours go this be the last fuck time
S0336	yeah but i be also petrify that something be gonna go like horribly wrong
S0362	with your car
S0336	yeah in the meantime
S0336	and i be like please just please just
S0362	get there
S0336	get there yeah erm but yeah it be quite it be quite a nice experience in the end like i think go on my own actually end up serve me well because they be really like almost like too sweet to me because they know i be on my own like rather than like try to take the piss and try to take advantage of me be on my own
S0362	yeah
S0336	they almost saw it as like oh no good on you like like the guy who's
S0362	yeah
S0336	like the guy
S0362	it be i i'm think that right now
S0336	yeah and the guy that finish the deal and take my payment and stuff he be just like you really get yourself a good deal there and i'm like yeah and he be like how do you get to agree to that and i'm just like oh i just ask nicely
S0336	and he be like yeah i bet you do and i be like i do i just ask nicely no trick i just ask nicely erm so yeah it be quite nice
S0362	good effort
S0336	yeah so i'm quite happy and be obviously really chuff and the car's be brilliant so far so i can't complain
S0362	how many miles do it have then
S0336	it have thirty thirty eight thousand or something so not a lot at all
S0362	deal deal i'll tell you
S0336	i'm get like seven hundred miles with it to the tank so
S0362	really seven hundred fuck off
S0336	how can you get seven hundred miles like
S0362	fuck off
S0336	yeah
S0362	no way
S0336	yeah
S0362	be it cos it's an eco
S0336	yeah i'm get like
S0336	i'm get like sixty one miles to the to the gallon
S0362	i'm sorry i have to like put my head down like i be i be gonna say to you like there's no point talk about that like i be gonna say how much do it cost you to fill your tank up
S0336	yeah
S0362	like so what be it a one point six
S0336	it's a one point five diesel
S0362	it's a diesel
S0336	yes so
S0362	right okay that make it a bite more understandable then
S0336	yeah so my i pay i pay fifty pound to fill up my tank yesterday but i can get seven hundred miles to that
S0362	that be fuck er ridonculus
S0336	yeah so beforehand i be
S0362	so you're think as i do when you fill it up don't let it just then go and park it somewhere random
S0336	no
S0362	fill up at convenient moments when you're actually gonna like use some
S0336	exactly and the thing be as well like erm beforehand i be pay about forty five pound per tank
S0362	yeah
S0336	and i be get four hundred miles if i be lucky
S0362	that's fuck still good
S0336	so i be literally like
S0362	no way
S0336	i've literally like double my the amount i can do
S0362	forty five quid and you're get four hundred miles
S0336	i be get if i be lucky out of a an entire petrol tank yeah
S0362	what be it if you weren't lucky
S0336	erm more like three thirty
S0362	yeah okay that's more than some of them
S0336	yeah
S0362	yeah and yeah especially when you you don't drive quickly on the a14 do you
S0336	no and also like i don't do i don't do that much town drive so even in the petrol
S0362	yeah
S0336	it should be an economical journey
S0362	yeah
S0336	because i'm go
S0362	long distance
S0336	through yeah
S0362	yeah true i i i once get three hundred out of mine and i be absolutely overjoy
S0336	really
S0362	yeah i be
S0336	be it that bad
S0362	well forty er forty five quid and i get i've never get er three hundred in it before
S0336	no way
S0362	erm well i don't drive any further than twenty minutes do i
S0336	that's amaze i
S0362	and i think about it like when i
S0336	i i get i think my polo be like really uneconomic
S0362	no that's good think about it cos when i drive i drive from 's
S0336	yeah
S0362	to to work so i do that saturdays like when i'm coach and back and back and back and during the days and back er or or into town and back and before i'm just start the start the car
S0336	yeah
S0362	i i try to think how many time a week i start the car just to go to work cos i drive to like 's 's mum's nursery and back to hers and then i go to the leisure centre and back and then i'll go to i i yeah just think about it and like today i've go from mine to 's dad's work to pick some stuff up there to stop start to to the school to out of school to for an hour's break an hour's break in there back in the car to the the session to here and then i'm gonna go oh it's fuck ridiculous oh i go to the doctor's this morning
S0362	the doctor's and back that be literally five minute journey all the time and that's not
S0336	that's
S0362	good for your car be it
S0336	no it's not three hundred miles my gosh i honestly like i think four hundred and i be like
S0362	no that's really good generally really good i think i think mine eventually i work out that it would have get me like three twenty on a good day but that be when i be actually drive i i fill up because i be drive a long way like sometimes i can
S0336	yeah
S0362	only get to like two sixty with forty quid in like sometimes i don't i and i've only ever fill it once erm from like empty to full
S0336	yeah
S0362	and it be forty five quid sometimes er like if i just put forty quid in which i normally do er normally get around two sixty i know it's bad isn't it
S0336	i mean i know there's a
S0362	so now you've just say that
S0336	i know there's i know there's nothing you can do about that now but like as and when you can actually
S0362	get a diesel
S0336	get some sort of work work vehicle yeah you're gonna be laugh you're gonna get so much more like i say like i think four hundred
S0362	what do you mean like as in pay for my
S0336	like just as and when like you can
S0362	yeah
S0336	upgrade like you'll save a lot of money on your fuel
S0362	because i'll get a diesel
S0336	yeah
S0362	oh hundred percent
S0336	yeah
S0362	and it'll be a van
S0336	you'll just like that like as far as i can tell like get two hundred and sixty miles out of your tank be very
S0362	be fuck all
S0336	yeah it's a very uneconomical car
S0362	well that's i don't think it be cos i be do er it be exactly the same in my in my fiesta
S0336	really
S0362	and i can't have have two shit economic ones i get more out of this one than my fiesta
S0336	lousy
S0362	but then you sort of ask around and like you're ask like 's family and it's all the same but then again they don't particularly drive a long way
S0336	yeah i get erm
S0362	so you that's it it's i think that's crucial
S0336	yeah
S0362	you actually commute but then i dunno i
S0336	i'll tell you what happen when i start go just across town
S0362	yeah well no cos you you'll still be like laugh it up
S0362	seven hundred miles seven hundred
S0336	yeah
S0362	fuck that would last me like two weeks
S0336	yeah it would last you longer but
S0362	yeah it it would now cos i i have to get mine
S0362	it's cheaper how do how much do 's get
S0336	erm he doesn't get dissimilar to me mine's really
S0362	be his diesel
S0336	his be a diesel as well like
S0362	oh
S0336	and his be economical it's not quite as economical as mine i think erm we've have we've have six hundred out of his erm but that be drive fairly economical i think he get close to five hundred most of the time
S0362	of how much do he take
S0336	erm
S0362	more than yours i would imagine
S0336	yeah a little bite more about fifty five pound maybe to go to like i think his tank's smaller than mine actually so maybe it's not dissimilar
S0336	i dunno
S0362	i can't believe this
S0336	but he fill up
S0362	i'm in shock actually i've never see a i've never see a diesel for a diesel er clio
S0336	yeah
S0362	i must admit
S0336	yeah erm have have get a clio as well i know i
S0362	hers be definitely petrol
S0336	be it
S0362	yeah i'm sure it be
S0336	oh i'm sure i think she tell me it be diesel
S0362	do she
S0336	oh maybe not
S0362	no i i i've never hear of a a clio that's
S0336	oh
S0362	that's diesel
S0336	yeah well i i
S0362	do it sound like a diesel
S0336	no it's really quiet it's really weird
S0362	oh maybe it be then
S0336	like like that
S0362	maybe it be diesel
S0336	that's that's the one thing i notice when i test drive it cos erm even the guy cos he be clearly like not that clue up on it think it be a petrol because it be that quiet and it's really light as well you know like diesel cars can sometimes feel like quite
S0362	chug along yeah
S0336	yeah like it doesn't at all i i couldn't recommend diesels more highly cos do you know what my road tax be twenty pound a year twenty pound
S0362	beat my hundred and forty three
S0336	mate i be pay ninety five pound per six months for my polo
S0362	bugger
S0336	hundred and eighty pound a year it be for my polo
S0336	so yeah diesels be
S0362	i'm i
S0336	diesels be cheap
S0362	what be i do now cos i've get it on er
S0336	direct debit
S0362	yeah which be that's so much better
S0336	yeah
S0362	now you can do that i be buzz when i find out that cos like it's that or what
S0336	it's a big chunk isn't it
S0362	yeah like but every six months
S0336	yeah
S0362	it come in like fuck like three hundred quid
S0336	yeah
S0362	i don't need that in my life
S0336	no
S0362	as if you want i don't think mine be that much
S0336	a hundred and eighty pound yeah i could only ever afford to do six months at a time and it be still like ninety five quid
S0362	that's outrageous but obviously with direct debit you obviously do pay a little bite more
S0336	yeah
S0362	but twelve pound a month
S0336	it's a lot more affordable
S0362	twelve pound a month be erm i that's alright
S0336	yeah that would be about right that would be a hundred and forty four yeah
S0362	yeah that's right i dunno i i oh yeah i dunno hard decision obviously it can't be more than sixty quid a year obviously wasn't go twelve months be it
S0336	yeah
S0362	a long day
S0336	mm
S0362	yeah so obviously that's it's so much better do it that way than get chunk out cos you don't you don't see it you just do it
S0336	yeah
S0362	it go out and it go
S0336	so what gym do use at the moment
S0336	really do she like it
S0362	mm love it
S0336	cos i know like quite a lot of people be rave cos they've get good class and stuff on and everything now as well isn't there
S0362	yeah she's go to so many class and i i'm i'm really like appreciative of the way they they've run it and the way they've get it all set up it's they've clearly do their research
S0336	yeah
S0362	cos i know i know he have because i know er 's dad be a big businessman
S0336	yeah
S0362	but i'd say pay what do she pay like thirty thirty quid a month
S0336	it's not a lot
S0362	maybe er i'm that sound about right and so basically you you can either buy a erm a gym membership or a class membership so you what it's the same price right be this get really weird acoustics like i can hear myself like ring in the background
S0336	dunno
S0362	oh
S0362	yeah i can oh
S0362	yeah i can hear me come back to me erm so obviously that's really good so you pay either gym or class and then whatever you want to pay so for example if she want to go to the gym so she's get a class membership if she want to go to the gym it would cost her like three pound a time to do it or if it be the other way round it would just like cost you three pound a class whatever it would be so that's really good
S0336	yeah
S0362	and she go to class like er monday tuesday wednesday i don't think she do one on thursday and then sunday or maybe do a saturday morning one as well and so she
S0336	so she's get her money's worth
S0362	probably get and it's a fiver to go if you're for a class if you're if you're not a member
S0336	yeah
S0362	so she definitely get her money's worth and it's well nice in there
S0336	yeah
S0362	i think the equipment's top of the range it's all brand like they have empire and
S0336	yeah
S0362	the room be really good so you and the class there's so many i think there's they've just increase it there's something like forty spin class a week or something like that
S0336	that's crazy that's
S0362	it's cos it's so popular
S0336	yeah well
S0362	and obviously everyone's talk about it and
S0336	yeah well 's be call out for a decent gym for age whoop
S0362	we have that conversation didn't we
