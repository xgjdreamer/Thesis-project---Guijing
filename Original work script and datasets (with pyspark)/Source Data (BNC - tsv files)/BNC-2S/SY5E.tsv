S0198	so that race be suppose to have more horse they've just be
S0229	be pull out cos of the weather i do a bet the other day each way twenty er twenty five for one there be eleven runners so i think that'd come in come in third i think that's fine i've get that there be only six runners at the end well they've pull it out cos of the weather
S0198	ah so they
S0229	nothing
S0198	they'll pull horse out even if the race be still run
S0229	no it be before
S0198	yeah but i mean
S0229	an hour before they can say no it's too soft
S0198	like they don't like the they don't want their horse run when it's too soft
S0229	yeah yeah there's to run
S0198	ah
S0229	so instead of have eleven horse then i'd've get a good place
S0198	see i just think it if be like if the race get cancel cos of bad weather fair enough but if the
S0229	no
S0198	race be go i assume
S0229	no
S0198	that you could
S0229	no the trainer can pull them out with that in within an hour of the it go off so his horse run at three o'clock at two o'clock he can say no i want them two out
S0198	oh
S0229	there's seven runners i want them two out
S0198	and lose yeah
S0229	oh you've fuck have it
S0198	what if you're bet on a non runner you just don't make a bet
S0229	get oh you get your money
S0198	for that individual one

S0198	but you need a nice bite of land land land's too expensive yes
S0229	that garden ain't no good for grain
S0198	yes
S0229	it's get a shingle underneath there and brick and it's no good for vegetables otherwise i'd've have a veggie patch
S0198	no it's not very big anyway i suppose for you and mum it might be alright
S0229	yeah
S0198	land have go too expensive
S0229	i mean 's get an allotment i could take that over but
S0198	yeah that'd be nice yeah fresh right cos you can grow a little bite in england
S0229	yeah
S0198	some runner bean potatoes carrots all your root you can grow here i think can't grow any tropical fruit obviously that's not a big deal
S0229	the the only stuff that's fresh be if you can grow it yourself then there ain't no chemicals or pesticide spray on it
S0198	mm yeah that's another thing if you want something that's truly organic they charge you ten time more for the
S0229	yeah
S0198	you can't afford to buy it
S0229	it's like you go to france you can have a horse steak there's nothing wrong with that
S0198	yeah
S0229	the trouble be they've discover now two or two years ago they what's the horse be inject with on steroids and what
S0198	that you're now eat
S0229	and now you're eat it
S0198	it's not just horse cow too
S0229	oh yeah
S0198	chickens
S0229	yeah yeah
S0198	probably pig they're all they're all you can get chickens that be just massive ball of water and puss from there with just like
S0229	yeah
S0198	er that's the thing i think we're be poison every day from our food source
S0229	yeah
S0198	another thing i think like mum say you know i say that to mum about us all my generation particularly not be er maybe get more illnesses as we get older
S0229	and she say well nan never use to eat that many vegetables and that and i say yeah but nan never what she do eat would've locally produce when she be a child
S0198	yeah and she didn't eat that much but everything she eat be very basic and fine
S0229	i think the only process meat
S0198	it's not the same
S0229	when we be young be a tin of spam or corn beef
S0198	or corn beef exactly
S0229	that be it
S0198	now you get everything in your freezer everything
S0229	but i don't eat i've never eat it anyway
S0198	even when you buy like you say a steak from the shop you don't
S0229	yeah
S0198	know what that
S0229	no
S0198	cow's be treat with
S0229	no i don't know what none of that
S0198	now you don't eat any freeze stuff there's barely anything in your freezer that's good
S0229	i don't eat i don't eat ham or anything like that
S0198	no
S0198	it's not really meat that's why pork's not good that good for you anyway
S0229	no the only meat i really eat be a bite of beef when mum do it or chicken
S0198	oh
S0229	and the other six days a week it's fish
S0198	fish
S0229	and whatever we have like today that's it
S0198	oh that's certainly healthier i think although again fish our seas be get pollute our oceans
S0229	yeah

S0198	because of china so at certain time of the year you go in a supermarket and most of the fruit be oranges or most
S0229	yeah
S0198	of the fruit's watermelon or strawberries cos it's seasonal and it taste so much better then than it do three months later when they've import it in from somewhere else
S0229	oh yeah yeah i mean you go and get a nice bite of fish like and cook
S0198	mm

S0229	it ain't
S0198	yes
S0229	you bugger
S0198	why it's natural conversation
S0229	i didn't realise that
S0198	yeah i know well take a once it get to an hour you i can it's eighteen pound so at the moment you've get about five quid come i think i'll keep that
S0229	and and how much you get come
S0198	about seven
S0198	get my extra ten percent
S0229	who get the rest then don't you get
S0198	no no no i get it all
S0229	oh
S0198	i'm just tell you that it's not even be an hour yet so i ain't even make eighteen quid yet so
S0229	oh well
S0198	's on about last time i speak to him he say he be on about i think he's do about eighteen hours since er last week since he's be at home
S0229	have he
S0198	eighteen hours time eighteen pound
S0229	be that what he's get
S0198	that'll be well it depend on the it depend if some of it might be not accept because of the quality or interruptions noise that kind of thing this sort of thing that do will do go over the voice that cut out the time but if even if he get what fifteen hours of that fifteen time eighteen pound that's alright innit
S0229	how much that be work out
S0198	don't know need a calculator hundred and eighty would be ten five twos be another er i dunno three hundred pound maybe
S0229	yeah i be gonna say it's gotta be close to
S0198	close to three
S0229	to three hundred quid
S0198	but i mean we need it it's our job so
S0229	yeah
S0198	we need to be clear in between us really we want wanna be do well it'd be nice to make make a erm
S0229	what about tax
S0198	well this be the thing cos it's do pro rata we it's all go through and he have to he basically register as self employ at that point so when it come round to what when be it march or april
S0229	yeah
S0198	then you have to fill out the tax form yourself and declare your earn
S0229	oh well
S0198	but i mean it won't be that much and it we won't do it so we won't be able to do it so much so that we even exceed our cos you're allow to earn a certain amount of money every year before you pay tax i think it's like eight grand or something now
S0229	yeah yeah yeah
S0198	we won't earn that much
S0229	well mum be but mum's allow to earn ten thousand pound
S0198	yeah i think it's ten yeah before your tax
S0229	before before your tax on it
S0198	what would be nice if we could do if we could earn an extra hundred a week so four hundred a month do this record that's what we need because that give us money every week to buy and buy and go out with cos at the moment we've get enough money for our rent and enough we've pay our tuition and a little bite leave but not enough for bill and food and not enough to then if we wanna go see our friends or come up to come up here or whatever we we we need the extra money
S0229	i a shop trip come on when i come down
S0198	so i know food shop
S0229	another
S0198	so if we if we can earn an extra er yeah few hours of record every week or whatever
S0229	yeah
S0198	then that's sort us out for the month now
S0229	when we come to
S0198	no
S0229	we use to get you bits didn't we
S0198	yeah take me food shop and then when mum be have her back turn you'd slip fifty quid in my back pocket
S0229	the bits and piece cor you owe me
S0198	on the side you've give me some haven't you dad
S0229	jesus christ
S0198	you haven't let me go poor
S0229	no
S0198	when i've be in england
S0198	would've cost you a lot more if i'd live here for the last six years
S0229	well i don't
S0229	you know you should've be home
S0198	at least i've be home
S0229	well i mean what do you do
S0198	ah it's all work well do my travel
S0229	yeah
S0198	gonna go back to uni
S0229	yeah
S0198	not just gonna stay around here do some crappy job i didn't like
S0229	like mum's do at the moment
S0198	yeah i mean the thing mum like her job she
S0229	yeah
S0198	doesn't like the m the way they be understaffed
S0229	yeah that's what put her off
S0198	she like the actual care part though
S0229	yeah
S0198	it's a real shame cos if they just employ two more people every day
S0229	when you go into yeah
S0198	her job would be significantly improve
S0229	then you you go in there's suppose to four people there there's only two
S0198	between all those patients
S0229	so you're double up
S0198	residents
S0229	yeah it's ridiculous
S0198	absurd
S0229	you're double up and and you've gotta work and you don't get no tea break then
S0198	no
S0229	no it's bad there's sometimes
S0198	no tea break no dinner break and that's maybe that's fine in a four hour shift but when you do a twelve hour shift
S0229	yeah
S0198	and that's the way they bloody do it it's bloody terrible that place want shut down
S0229	but it go on all the time
S0198	oh i bet it do too
S0229	not only there everywhere
S0198	i know every every job employ the bare minimum of people
S0229	yeah
S0198	and make everyone work more than they should
S0229	and if you complain they sack you
S0198	yeah
S0229	or they make it awkward for you
S0198	make you feel bad when you go in
S0229	it's like when i i phone that woman up and i have that interview with my badge and i haven't i say do you know in all my work career i say i never claim any sick pay i say and oh that disability allowance
S0198	mm
S0229	er tenant's allowance it's call now and i say and then when you come to need a bite of help in later years i say you can't bloody get it
S0198	no
S0229	and er it er this be when he phone me up and i
S0198	yeah well
S0229	and the next thing i know erm i say mum we're only go to get the minimum i know what's gonna happen if we get it
S0198	oh can they give you different amount
S0229	yeah
S0198	accord to how much they think you need
S0229	and then when he and they they send through we've decide to pay you the maximum mr
S0198	oh really good i mean some people would've get refuse and
S0229	yeah
S0198	yeah it's worthwhile
S0229	so i'll get three hundred and twenty six pound a month
S0198	okay i mean it help out doesn't it
S0229	yeah
S0198	with the bill and everything
S0229	yeah oh yeah
S0198	still if you be on your own that wouldn't be enough to take care of you would it
S0229	no
S0198	it's
S0229	no
S0198	not really that much money
S0229	no
S0198	but
S0229	but then i wanna give it another year and i'm gonna hit them again
S0198	yeah and see what else
S0229	have get worse let's see what else i can get
S0198	yeah
S0229	because the i be talk to the bloke when i be fish
S0198	oh i mean really they should you should get that amount of money just in your pension
S0229	he erm
S0198	if they weren't so tight
S0229	he's get a car out of them they pay for the road tax
S0198	mm
S0229	pay for the car but if the car's ten say eight thousand or ten grand they pay that but if you want one for fifteen you could pay your five and
S0198	get a
S0229	get a really
S0198	oh they help you out with things like buy a car and stuff
S0229	yeah yeah they pay the main bulk
S0198	mm
S0229	but if you want a better model then you'd pay
S0198	why do they do that then why do they not with your car so you've get a better car to
S0229	do that again
S0198	why
S0229	yeah
S0198	do they help out with cars just so you
S0229	well disability
S0198	yeah
S0229	that's what you're entitle to
S0198	to spend disable car proper
S0229	yeah and er
S0229	and they're all at it i mean like one of these erm disable vehicles they drive
S0198	mobile
S0229	yeah what they drive round
S0198	what oh you mean the scooter type things
S0229	yeah
S0229	yeah get one of them
S0198	no don't need one of them
S0229	no i'm just say you know
S0198	you can do
S0229	they all they all push their luck and they even the the the indians do it and you've get a fair amount rid around on them scooter things
S0198	oh
S0229	they're all they're all jump on the bandwagon
S0198	i wouldn't i wouldn't wanna ride around in one of those it rain too much
S0229	no i wouldn't
S0198	for a start need a rain cover for it
S0229	yeah well i mean it's
S0198	it's just not
S0229	they're alright in the summer time ain't they
S0198	not really necessarily they well i mean if you're
S0229	some people need them
S0198	but if you be disable it easy
S0229	yeah yeah
S0198	because if you can't afford a car and you can't walk everywhere any
S0229	no
S0198	more cos you've get old and your legs
S0229	yeah
S0198	have get arthritis then it's fair enough i suppose
S0229	well i mean i just say
S0198	as you say if you've work your entire life never have any sick pay
S0229	i've never claim a sick pay in in my life
S0198	i know and i know you've always work you've pay all that
S0229	yeah
S0198	money and tax your entire life
S0229	yeah and when i ask for that they refuse me to start with
S0198	mm disgraceful
S0229	and then when i send the physio therapist's report in which we find never find the first time
S0198	do you have or do you
S0229	yeah
S0198	have to ask for one
S0229	yeah we have it
S0229	oh yeah we just couldn't find it
S0198	and we just couldn't find it
S0229	mum put it away somewhere fuck know where it go but we find it the second time send that off and that i think that swing it round
S0198	mm
S0229	otherwise we'd've just be on what i'm get now and what mum's get
S0198	mm
S0229	and you know that on my pension i mean no extra so i cut them taters small cos when you boil them they they boil quicker ready for
S0198	boil much much quicker yeah
S0229	ready to mash
S0198	much much quicker we do the same cos otherwise we just end up get impatient and we mash it and they're not boil enough yet
S0229	yeah there's nothing worse mash potatoes that be not boil properly
S0198	not boil i know yeah although apparently the quickest trick to do them tiny little bite more water and put them in the microwave for thirty second or something
S0229	yeah
S0198	everyone on the internet say if you haven't boil them enough do that and you'll have perfect mash potatoes
S0229	yeah
S0198	i've never try it but
S0229	i i always do them like this
S0198	i don't eat don't eat
S0229	well we don't but well only when i do shepherd's pie and that
S0198	shepherd's pie oh
S0229	and i think it it'd be different just to rather than chuck them in there like you know
S0198	yeah
S0229	just lay them on like that
S0198	i prefer
S0229	i'll try it i've never do it this way before but i'm gonna try
S0198	that sound like a good idea doesn't do think it's gonna be bad
S0229	that look a bite green that one that one's a bite bloody
S0198	it's just a bite raw not really ready or something yeah
S0229	yeah yeah i've do it
S0198	get another big bag here
S0229	yeah
S0198	be these actually british then
S0229	oh i
S0198	say it on there
S0229	well they're probably bag in bag bag up in this country
S0198	bag in here
S0229	and come from a foreign land
S0198	yeah it's aldi's isn't it see what they say it doesn't make sense cos i mean we can grow potatoes quite well in england so surely it's cheaper just to get them here
S0229	yeah well i mean
S0198	quality assure assure food standards blah blah blah aldi's aldi store
S0229	it doesn't say they've grow here do it
S0198	i mean it say british white potatoes and aldi's could've come from ireland
S0229	yeah
S0198	which be fine still britain still fairly local
S0229	oh yeah yeah
S0198	but it doesn't actually farm fresh
S0229	that's probably where they're bag
S0198	no that'd be where they're bag yeah no
S0229	that's the trouble
S0198	it's hard to know they mislead everyone with their package don't they
S0229	yeah
S0198	so i don't really know if that's true or not it doesn't doesn't doesn't clarify that one
S0229	the er see if that water's run darling
S0198	when's your first horse run then
S0229	it's first go down i don't know whether it's on the telly if it's on the telly i'll watch it if it ain't
S0198	oh right see if the horse be run at all
S0229	if it ain't on then it's on the internet
S0198	have you get be this your
S0229	what what's that say
S0198	downpatrick
S0229	no
S0198	downpatrick where's that in ireland
