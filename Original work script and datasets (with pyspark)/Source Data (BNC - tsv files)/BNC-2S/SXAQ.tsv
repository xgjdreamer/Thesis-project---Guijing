S0252	what be your view on the upcoming scottish referendum
S0251	well i'm surprise at the momentum that the whole argument have generate at the moment we're about a week or so away from the actual vote and the people that want to stay in the union be only win by a short head poll vary but it's pretty evenly match really there's maybe only a couple of percentage point in it i don't think it be a good idea for scotland to become a separate country and i think it's better for england if they stay with us as well so i think it's better for both place that we stay together because i think it would undermine both the countries both in europe and in the world if they be separate because they're too small
S0252	it's interest i read in the telegraph that apparently on average each scottish person receive one thousand eight hundred pound more in erm sort of state fund compare to an english person via free prescriptions and free tuition fee and that sort of thing so they do certainly have a privilege status within the unite kingdom
S0251	i think so i think we're on to a pretty good thing on those two score the debate seem to have deteriorate if you want to use that word into scotland versus westminster rather than scotland against england they seem to be just focus on this political aspect erm
S0252	and they'll think you could almost go further to say that it's more or less snp versus conservative to some extent
S0251	yes yes
S0252	i think the scots dislike or generally the conservatives it hasn't help
S0251	yes they haven't get any conservative mps in scotland it's just one now be it they're hardly represent at all
S0252	just one
S0251	but that's democracy i mean sometimes when you have the general election in this country one party doesn't have a very big majority so it still mean that nearly half the people have get a government that they haven't actually elect so that be how democracy work so you have to lump it until the next time you have a vote and then see if it change
S0252	yes but i think really that's just whether different people's view be represent to some extent
S0251	yes i think at the begin it seem that the cry for independence be just confine to a small fanatical and nationalistic minority yes
S0252	group mm
S0251	as time's go on it seem to have gather momentum so i think it's always more difficult to defend something than it be to attack it
S0252	it be
S0251	so
S0252	erm not sure that it have be thoroughly think through because there be a comparison of statistics between office of national statistics and what the researchers the snp and on every score it seem to be different to quite an extreme
S0251	mm
S0252	for example the snp reckon that there's a lot more royal in scotland than what the office of national statistics estimate
S0251	oh right yeah
S0252	and the cost of independence be office of national statistics have estimate it would cost ten time as much as what the erm snp have erm calculate so there do seem to be some discrepancy between statistics
S0251	see it's difficult to know what to believe really isn't it
S0252	it be one thing it certainly do be i i do think scotland be in a relatively strong position currently it's get a good welfare system it's more economically develop country erm they've get the back of erm about sixty million people within the scotland wales and england and northern ireland
S0251	mm yes
S0252	but i think the idea of independence it it just shut off all that security
S0251	yes
S0252	you know even talk about currency and border and it it just get very complicate in a way that's not really necessary it's not go to make any difference to the everyday live
S0251	no
S0252	well people still have to go to work they still have to pay tax
S0251	yes they will
S0252	it doesn't change really
S0251	no that's right one other thing be that if it do turn out that the vote for leave the union have a majority that they want to have a separate vote because they think they will have a majority of people want to stay and they've get the oil field nearest to them
S0252	uhu
S0251	so that's an interest development
S0252	but in some ways it would almost create like a new gibraltar but north of the
S0251	mm yeah it's painful isn't it on the one hand you've get people from other countries in europe travel into france and try to get into england because we've get from their point of view this fantastic system go with all the welfare care and all the national health et cetera risk their live on the underside of a lorry to try to get in and on the other hand we've get the scottish folk or half of the scottish folk want to eh call it a day
S0252	yes
S0251	yes i think once the vote have be count i don't think things be ever go to be quite the same again
S0252	no
S0251	even if they do stay i think a lot of people feel a bite different i don't really think it's add to the stability of the situation in either scotland or in england
S0252	no
S0251	especially see as the vote look like it's go to be pretty close i think i'm go to feel a little bite different about it now
S0252	in a more negative way perhaps
S0251	mm yes because i've really like go to scotland in the past when we've be on holiday and bur all the tartan shop and see the bagpipers and when we go to edinburgh edinburgh tattoo i really enjoy that but now it seem that there's so much antipathy towards the english it's not go to be the same
S0252	no
S0251	i don't think there's go to be quite the same welcome in the hillside
S0252	erm must admit when i've be in scotland i've not felt a particular nationalistic stance
S0251	no i haven't actually
S0252	i've just be sort of treat as more or less erm
S0251	yes
S0252	well not a local but someone within the same country
S0251	no yes yes no we really enjoy it haven't we think edinburgh be a very vibrant place to be it seem
S0252	yes it do
S0251	bustle and you know lot of tourists and we really enjoy see the castle hadn't we
S0252	yes i think the erm royal collection trust will be put in a a bite of a difficult position with i don't quite know how that would quite work out if they be separate
S0251	no i don't know a lot of it it seem to be up in the air doesn't it
S0252	it do
S0251	then from the point of view of the position of the queen the position of the currency side of things and erm whether they're go to be in europe or not some commentators think that people such as the spanish will say that they don't want them in because they think that it might aggravate the situation in spain with the catalonians want independence that it might yeah trigger them and give them more ideas
S0252	mm trigger but i think there be similar situations in other part of europe in particular though and the flemish in belgium and erm ah catalonians have be mention even somewhere in austria and erm part of italy just seem to be a sort of nationalistic
S0251	yes
S0252	i don't really know why it's suddenly surge or whether it's because of erm the latest economic crisis that's create a bite of unstability or erm why that be because i don't really think that it's a particularly fruitful task
S0251	mm yeah no i don't i think it's go to lead to greater vulnerability
S0252	and
S0251	there's already lot of military cut in so i don't know how that will pan out when countries get even smaller
S0252	mm but when scotland's if they do separate they're plan to have a a small military unit of themselves or
S0251	no
S0252	but from the english point of view it mean that we're go to have to move our nuclear erm submarine and stockpile units and it'll be very expensive
S0251	mm i think it's just too complicate i don't really think there's such a big problem that we need to do something so drastic
S0252	i know and which how would scottish soldier work out because the erm british taxpayer have pay for their train and their salaries and obviously the patriotic the swear oath and that sort of thing how be that go to work if that become independent they can't swear an oath to the or
S0251	i don't know no you can't i don't know how it's go to work out i don't think anybody know how it would all work out there's a lot of uncertainties about it really
S0252	yeah well i just think they've get it wrong really i just don't think it'll stand to improve or progress anything
S0251	no
S0252	i think they've get a certain amount of control at holyrood anyway and er to be honest they might've just be better off say that they would like some more power rather than kick off a
S0251	yeah well i think they have be promise them haven't they
S0252	yeah
S0251	it do turn out to be no in the end that they're go to get more power anyway so i think they would be in a very strong position from that point of view
S0252	mm it's not go to be far off
S0251	no
S0252	from just without all the
S0251	no
S0252	the aspects
S0251	mm i think so
S0252	mm i think the er tattoo be erm a nice part of the scottish heritage
S0251	it be there's lot of things that be very appeal about it all the tartan and i think when you go in the tartan shop everybody's want to find their tartan and their name and claim some kind of link to it it's that popular
S0252	it be in some ways erm i would like to erm visit er the macbeth's castle er be it castle or something like that
S0251	don't know
S0252	and erm i would like to visit balmoral as well
S0251	mm
S0252	yes er
S0251	i think that's quite far north though isn't it
S0252	it be it be but obviously that's not really er well that do shouldn't really stop you go if you would like to go
S0251	no no
S0252	yes
S0251	we find it much easier on the train didn't we the second time
S0252	yes
S0251	rather than the coach
S0252	indeed
S0251	that be far too long wasn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	quite gruelling really
S0252	i think train be really a very good form of travel i i don't think it get much better
S0251	mm no you can go a lot quicker can't you
S0252	it do yeah
S0251	mm
S0252	it er it's not sort of er super high speed line but it be you know you should be do at least a hundred miles per hour for most of the way
S0251	mm should be plenty
S0252	yes but that would be another complication you have to er er apply eurostar procedures to travel up to scotland separate
S0251	they say not but i don't know and what about the railway company
S0252	i know
S0251	would they have to have a separate one
S0252	don't know just add more complication doesn't it
S0251	mm
S0252	er obviously the currency they have will be a bite complicate and also the assets edinburgh technically part of the network be run by the uk so
S0251	mm mm
S0252	don't know how that would work out
S0251	because they already have a separate school system don't they with the scottish highers instead of the a level
S0252	yes
S0251	and they actually get their exam result two weeks
S0252	yes
S0251	before the a level come out so
S0252	they do
S0251	they have a bite of time to think about their options before the english a level result be publish
S0252	yes but another aspect of they're not in the eu and we be in the eu that do mean you will have to have some non eu check
S0251	don't know we might not be stay in yet i don't know
S0252	i know that's
S0251	david cameron be make a lot of promise isn't he
S0252	he be hope he can remember them all
S0251	mm
S0252	i think erm that the like the the sort of the castle and erm sort of sort of rather impose build and stuff i don't think there be a lot of impose build in scotland i think there be a lot
S0251	yes
S0252	of sort of group of sort of like erm erm almost like medieval feel to
S0251	yes it do have that kind of original kind of original macbeth feel to it
S0252	oh
S0251	yeah
S0252	when the romans come of course they put hadrian's wall up there didn't they and decide to call it a day and not to bother with scotland because they think it be a bite too much trouble and probably get a bite too cold up there for them as well
S0251	yes i think it would be erm really funny from salmond's point of view if erm scotland vote yes and then the come back to the uk
S0252	mm strange
S0251	have you see that there's be some mock up of what the flag would look like if erm we be separate and that and blue would be remove and it would be a black background with yellow next to the erm the white strip
S0252	oh really why black and yellow
S0251	because that's one of the welsh flag be black and yellow
S0252	oh right
S0252	sound a lot different lot different
S0251	yeah
S0252	i don't think that will catch on there's some people say that if they do decide to go separate that we wouldn't need to bother with change the clock
S0251	yes
S0252	back and then change them again in the spring because that's do for the benefit of scotland so that they get better daylight hours but if they weren't with us any more we probably wouldn't have to bother about it
S0251	yes
S0252	no they may not want to stick to greenwich mean time i don't know
S0251	no
S0252	oh yes
S0252	i think that's one thing that england have give to the world be the time isn't it
S0251	yes
S0252	everything seem to be calculate from that greenwich mean time doesn't it
S0251	yes do you like the falkirk wheel in scotland be you surprise at how that work sort of lift
S0252	it be it be an amaze structure wasn't it how they think that one out
S0251	yeah do you enjoy or be you a little bite sort of scar
S0252	yeah it be a bite of an experience wasn't it
S0251	yeah it be a bite like a ferris wheel in some respect
S0252	yes it be wasn't it
S0251	yes
S0252	yes i'm glad we do it though
S0251	yes
S0252	bite strange in some ways
S0251	then sort of ah a river can sort of have like two tiers or on different level
S0252	yeah
S0251	yeah
S0252	how do the
S0251	i don't know with difficulty probably
S0252	obviously it be just have a big splash if you just didn't eh come down the wheel itself
S0251	yes
S0252	apparently stirling be mean to be quite a nice ahm place
S0251	mm
S0252	be you aware of stirling
S0251	no i haven't be there
S0252	no
S0251	i don't know what it's like there's a castle isn't there
S0252	yes i think it's mean to be very medieval very sort of unchanged
S0251	oh right yeah
S0252	eh
S0251	mm
S0252	mm and so it's a university town as well
S0251	yes
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	i don't know whether it would be like york or
S0251	i don't know
S0251	anything about it
S0252	in some ways i suppose we only really explore the erm lower part of scotland lothian and the er border
S0251	yes edinburgh yes yes
S0252	yes i think there be possibly quite a large part north of that that be isn't really too much to see it's just
S0251	mm
S0252	like more or less nothing there really just countryside
S0251	just countryside yes
S0252	which be very nice
S0251	that's a good thing isn't it
S0252	some very sparse
S0251	mm
S0252	do you think the erm retailers threaten a an increase in price will will worry some sort of john lewis and asda say that they have to increase price due to additional cost associate with
S0251	yes i don't think that would help and also some company say that they would want to relocate i think royal bank of scotland say that they would want to relocate wouldn't they
S0252	yes
S0251	but then in some ways it wouldn't be the royal bank of scotland if it be in england would it
S0252	no would be a bite strange and also seem to be a bite of a question of the clydesdale bank which be apparently the national bank of australia be want to erm sell that part of its portfolio
S0251	really
S0252	really
S0251	in any event or just if they separate
S0252	well it's just look at in any event
S0251	oh right why
S0252	but it be say that it it might speed up the sale if there's independence
S0251	oh right be it not as profitable
S0252	i don't know i haven't i haven't see any analysis on the effect or
S0251	oh right i'm surprise mm but why would john lewis have more cost than then do now
S0252	well they're say that ahm the scottish john lewises be currently partially subsidise by the english john lewises
S0251	they don't have as much business as
S0252	from so don't have as much business and eh the increase in logistic cost
S0251	yes
S0252	because apparently part of the royal above edinburgh be on a single carriageway
S0251	right
S0252	so that mean lorries be only restrict to fifty miles per hour
S0251	yes
S0252	but also i imagine it's a long way from eh depots i imagine their depots will be in the midlands and south of england so obviously it's a long way to drive up
S0251	mm in some ways though i'm surprise they've get one because york have only get one this year hasn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	so they've go further north before york
S0252	yes yes they've i think they've they have six store in scotland
S0251	oh right
S0252	yes there's at least one in edinburgh
S0251	yes
S0252	there's one in glasgow and there's a few further north
S0251	because it's the john lewis partnership be only just start make a presence in the north yorkshire area hasn't it
S0252	mm particularly the waitrose side of things
S0251	yes
S0252	and the john lewis as well bite of a down
S0251	yes it be
S0252	ah surprise in some ways if you're take sort of them eighty odd years to get up here
S0251	yes
S0252	yes i wouldn't say that we're now really north
S0251	no
S0252	no
S0251	doesn't seem to have be a priority do it
S0252	no ah
S0251	get there in the end though
S0252	i think some part of the north have be perhaps erm not as affluent as part of the south of england
S0251	mm well there's pocket aren't there
S0252	yes they're just pocket i think in the south of england it might be a little bite more than pocket in some areas
S0251	mm mm you've probably hear about the erm pocket in yorkshire the
S0252	yes
S0251	have deep pocket and short arm
S0252	indeed
S0252	but
S0252	but asda as well they're say that it will increase cost as well which obviously would affect quite a number of people
S0251	for the same reason
S0252	in scotland
S0251	yeah mm
S0252	and eh people would not like that because obviously erm that would mean increase cost for not really too much
S0251	no i think it's strange though that for instance morrisons the price be not the same and sainsbury's would be price be not the same in all the shop throughout the country and that sometimes we see price advertise on the internet but when you go to your local store it's actually more than that isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	so we're actually pay the premium for live in the area that we do
S0252	yes but furthermore a certain express delivery company will not deliver to this at this postcode
S0251	no yes and that could affect the royal mail as well
S0252	yes
S0251	because the the erm price for delivery and to the orkneys and far fling corner be just the same as the rate isn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	so that must be subsidise as well so that might have to be sort out separately
S0252	there's no pun intend
S0251	think you'd miss that one
S0252	but ah it do certainly seem to erm potentially affect the men who sort of retail side of things a bite
S0251	mm yes and i wonder if some people who be say that they're go to vote yes when it actually come to it i think they might decide not to do it because i think it be go to adversely affect them and i think they might have get a little bite too erm embroil in it
S0252	mm yes
S0251	because they be well know for be quite canny aren't they
S0252	they be
S0251	and they won't want it to adversely affect their personal finance will they
S0252	definitely not
