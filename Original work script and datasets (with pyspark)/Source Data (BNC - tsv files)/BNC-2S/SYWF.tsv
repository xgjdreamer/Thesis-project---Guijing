S0024	what tonight
S0144	well
S0144	not go i be gonna go shop wasn't i
S0024	surprise to come back and find you here i think you be gonna leave just the same time as us
S0144	yeah well i
S0024	go on age
S0144	i've spend the whole day try to fuck sort out this logic thing
S0144	i figure out that well first of all i be i be play the guitar
S0024	woah ah ah
S0144	i be play guitar and i couldn't get any audio at all and then i so i think oh great now i can't even get any audio first of all it be the midi that i couldn't get now i can't get anything but i figure out i'd just change some settings so that's okay i've get that work again
S0144	and then i've try everything i've be troubleshoot i've be read all the guide for logic and
S0144	look at all these help page and i've write to people and
S0024	have you write to the help people there
S0144	no i download the
S0024	i'm sure they'd be good cos
S0144	yeah i've register with them
S0024	mm
S0144	erm and i download the drivers for my keyboard
S0024	mm
S0144	like the up to date ones
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's make no difference cos the power's definitely work the light be come on on the keyboard and occasionally i can get sound but then it just go off randomly
S0024	mm
S0144	so i mean it's an old keyboard if if you think i get it in in what two thousand and seven
S0024	yeah i know but it should still work fine
S0144	it's like seven years old it's quite a long
S0024	yeah but
S0144	quite old in technological term isn't it
S0024	but it's only a keyboard
S0144	but it work on my pc
S0024	it's only a keyboard what more what advance could it have make
S0144	erm
S0024	it's still
S0144	well i dunno but i download
S0024	it's
S0144	this other thing to that check basically check your midi input
S0024	mm
S0144	and i've get no signal come through so that's the problem
S0024	mm
S0144	so either i think the power's not sufficient in the cable or it's an old keyboard and it's it's just not recognise by logic
S0024	well that would be silly i think because
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's still usb and it's still a keyboard
S0144	yeah
S0024	all of the jazzy stuff you do on a computer so there's no need for it to be update in any way
S0144	well no
S0024	just a
S0144	well no no if you look at all the latest midi keyboards they all they've get a load of pad on them and
S0024	have you get
S0144	load of knobs
S0024	but you do all of that on the computer so there's no need for that
S0144	yeah yeah yeah but erm but i be just er texting and he's get a midi keyboard and i just ask him have he get a be it usb to usb or be it midi out to usb he's get a midi out to usb i've get usb to usb so if i can use his cable
S0024	maybe
S0144	from the midi out socket which i have
S0024	yeah
S0144	to usb maybe that will be the problem
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos i don't know if that have a different power
S0024	but then you can buy the cable
S0144	yeah but if that doesn't work then i think i need to buy a new midi keyboard
S0024	woo i choke
S0144	cos i can use the the keyboard that be on the computer
S0024	no no you don't wanna do that
S0144	but it's it's crap
S0024	there's no point in do that cos you won't learn how to play a keyboard
S0144	no
S0024	it's just pointless press a b c no no no you won't be able to pick that up
S0144	mm yeah i know no cos i want the different octaves as well i don't wanna
S0024	yeah
S0144	just play one octave
S0024	no that would be rubbish well i hope it work cos i don't really see the point of buy a new keyboard unless it's a
S0144	well it's annoy cos it work on the pc
S0144	it's just on the mac
S0024	maybe it's the mac that need the erm midi output
S0144	yeah
S0144	that's what i'm think i think that's seriously i think that's the last thing i can try
S0024	yeah
S0144	i've try everything else unless i'm just be a complete dumb ass and do the wrong settings on logic
S0024	ooh
S0144	i don't think i be because that test i have no signal come through
S0024	yeah
S0144	when i be press the key so that's that but that's what i've be do all day and all day yesterday
S0024	well you better stop do it
S0144	well yeah i be cos my head
S0144	you know when you've be star at a computer all day
S0024	yeah you
S0144	my head's fuck
S0024	yeah i'd give it a break for a few days give it a break
S0144	i just wanna get start with it
S0024	you could start by do guitar things and drum things and look and learn and make you know you don't have to start with a keyboard do you
S0144	well with the drum you need the keyboard
S0024	why
S0144	if you're make your own beat you're assign
S0024	you're gonna record your drum and then put it on there
S0144	oh erm i i don't know yet
S0024	i think that's what it be for
S0144	yeah but then if i record my own drum that's gonna be a loop
S0024	yeah well just make load of different loop
S0144	no but it's difficult to quantise it
S0024	but i think the whole idea be to have your unique style of drum
S0144	yeah
S0024	record and make in
S0144	no i be gonna get to that but i can't start with that because i need to learn how how it all work
S0024	oh okay yeah yeah oh
S0144	so i just need to start with a basic drum machine and
S0024	yeah
S0144	figure out
S0024	you should do the chord
S0144	what's go on yeah well i i'm still download the sound cos once i've download that
S0144	which have take six days so far connection here's shit erm once i've get that i can download the chord and start that
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah but seem pretty keen cos he's just start use
S0024	so he's only just start make music too oh
S0144	yeah
S0144	well he's a decent bassist
S0144	but he want to
S0144	i think he's get a couple of project with people make people
S0144	so what's that things you buy
S0024	it be a rice cooker stroke some sort of slow cooker but i don't know it's not like it's not a slow cooker actually you cook the meat and then you keep it warm for a while
S0144	mm
S0024	but it's not it's not a slow cooker that would yeah cook it all slowly i mean timer for it would just do the meat then beep then you'd have to put it on just keep warm so it be a slow cooker basically
S0144	mm
S0024	but it'll cook rice it'll cook meat fish er pulse which will be really good for me pulse erm i dunno i think she's gonna teach me how to cook a few things so that i know cos i've i've say to her i don't know how much water to put in she say well the same that you'd put in a saucepan i'm like well yeah but i you tell she tell me i cook rubbish rice
S0024	i don't believe that how blunt she be
S0024	she's really really outspoken we go round we go round erm 's house and she she say could have a look around so she be go you know you know how everybody's house be the furniture in
S0144	mm
S0024	all the same everybody's get the same furniture
S0144	mm
S0024	so she's get the same furniture basically but everybody's just get a different sofa haven't they all of that erm storage bite be all exactly the same and she's go ooh it's so good it's so good her landlady be very good your landlady be very bad
S0024	so she's
S0024	it's like well our house isn't that bad come on i know but she know the trouble we've have with the landlady so and she you know all the stupid things the landlady but still i say so i try to say well it's it's furniture nothing to do with the the landlady's just pay for
S0144	mm
S0024	to sort it out so they do but erm yeah
S0144	but we're pay less than everyone else as well aren't we
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	do she know that
S0024	well a little bite she's pay five thousand for hers for that er and it's not big like this when you when you come here and look at this the size it really be different when erm the kid be play in
S0024	one room they've get a bed which they need to take out so they haven't get a study they haven't get a study at all so no i like our i like our i like the view

S0144	so do she buy that thing or you
S0024	er well
S0024	i be go to buy a cheap rice cooker for her but then when she explain that you can cook that that would only be for rice and you can't put anything else in it like it would be about fifteen twenty pound then there be this one for thirty pound and you can cook all this other stuff
S0144	yes okay
S0024	and you can keep it warm so you could make soup any
S0144	mm
S0024	kind of soup vegetable soup just throw ins some vegetables throw in some water just switch it on

S0144	we're only gonna be away couple of hours each day
S0024	they don't have nurseries so
S0144	no
S0024	they don't have nurseries so what else can you do you have someone at your house look after them that's it
S0144	yeah just the way it be isn't it
S0024	yeah it's not just that we're bore it's that
S0144	it's just be when we be yeah when we're
S0024	if we be at home and you could afford it you'd do it
S0144	oh yeah but it'd cost you a bloody fortune at home
S0024	yeah
S0144	no we wouldn't be able to do it at home you wouldn't
S0024	you're a lucky girl
S0144	you wouldn't be able to work at all
S0024	do you know how lucky you be have a nanny huh have a nanny
S0024	an nanny yeah be you lucky have a nanny
S0144	when do language acquisition start when's she gonna start pick up chinese
S0024	but do you know i think because you know how she copy your intonation
S0144	mm
S0024	with the open close thing
S0024	open close i think her ear must be quite highly develop because of have chinese around her
S0024	the intonations just the the fact that there's
S0144	tone
S0024	yeah because she be copy
S0144	yeah but we have tone we just use them in a different way
S0024	yeah no that's what i
S0144	so what's the difference her be here and at home
S0144	wouldn't develop faster
S0024	ah mm really they do they be to hear hear aren't they
S0144	well only in term of the mean of the vocab
S0024	just the yeah
S0144	i mean our intonation's base on
S0024	er
S0144	be in question or statements or
S0024	okay in open wide you go open close
S0144	emotion erm
S0024	cos it's unfinished when you say open it's not finish close you're go down it's tone isn't it like
S0144	erm
S0024	close but that's just the game
S0144	yeah
S0024	that you're play
S0144	yeah
S0024	you wouldn't say i've close the door
S0024	i've close the door
S0144	yeah that's just individual iambs isn't it
S0024	yeah so it's only when you've finish your utterance or whatever that you would use intonation like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	so it's not every single word that you're that you've get a on it
S0144	yeah
S0024	or a
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah so that's why every single word in chinese have get
S0024	not every word but
S0144	i have a look on facebook earlier everyone's do this ice bucket thing
S0144	do i tell you someone nominate me
S0024	yeah what you gonna do
S0144	i'm not do it
S0024	why not well you'd never do it
S0144	firstly i hate
S0024	firstly you don't own a bucket
S0144	that's not the point i hate these trend
S0024	yeah
S0144	it scar me it just scar me how easily people will jump on bandwagons
S0024	they don't want to
S0144	it's
S0024	they don't want to be see as not do it that's why
S0144	i mean i give money to charity but not because everyone else be
S0024	yeah well what be you gonna do then because
S0144	i choose
S0024	people think you're a stingy old bastard if you don't do it
S0144	i don't care if that's what they think
S0024	but do you care what they think
S0144	no
S0024	who be it nominate you anyway
S0144	my cousin in
S0024	well
S0144	but erm
S0024	she's gonna think you're a stingy old bastard
S0144	it's not exactly altruistic be it i mean post yourself all over the internet say look at me
S0024	you don't have to post it you can just say i do it
S0144	you don't even have to say that you just do it and give the money why why why the need to shove it down everyone's throat
S0024	well how you gonna nominate the extra three people
S0144	that's what i don't like
S0024	mm well if you wanna do you wanna do it at all
S0144	no no it's just make me angry i mean it be good that they're give money to charity if if they be give the money to charity
S0024	yeah they be that's the whole point of it
