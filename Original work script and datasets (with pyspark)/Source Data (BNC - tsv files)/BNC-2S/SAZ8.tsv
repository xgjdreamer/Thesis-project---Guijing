S0175	what kind of things be you do in linguistics study
S0109	just general elt style stuff really sorry i don't know it's just a bank of build up a bank of um data that they can just use in the future
S0175	so be it search out see what kind of word people use or how they use word or
S0109	how they well yeah how how you use word or kind of grammatical constructions that actually still use rather than just teach in grammar lessons and
S0175	okay
S0109	that sort of thing
S0175	mm like split infinitives and stuff and
S0109	yep
S0175	not that i understand what they be but i use to get tell off by grandfather about split my infinitives
S0109	oh the oed allow them now so
S0175	mm i know
S0109	must be
S0175	mm
S0109	i have get more ideas than that but not many
S0175	i guess we need to think about whether we want to do it on a friend or foe whether we want to do it on the theme that the box pick out of more
S0109	mm
S0175	um which be kind of the two choices that we face and so we come up with sort of choices things where they pick up which be kind of where friend or foe come cos they're ultimately the two choices
S0109	mm
S0175	that there be um but when i be think about friend and foe as a theme and think of the game that go with that didn't really link very well into the box which isn't necessarily matter
S0109	yeah that's that's a good point cos i hadn't think about that i have just be think friend and foe help
S0175	mm
S0109	i don't know what to do i find um box six a bite of a er mm i don't know how to say it i don't think it's two ways to live
S0175	go on
S0109	i think it's one way to live one way to die
S0175	yeah
S0109	so i don't know
S0175	i guess it's two ways to live at the moment isn't it but then one way lead to eternal death one way lead to eternal life
S0109	mhm how long do we actually need to leave cos last week's seem to be quite a long question of the week plus
S0175	mm
S0109	talk time
S0175	it be shorter than my one i think my one be extra stupidly long
S0109	yeah well yours be recap
S0175	yeah that's true that's what i felt but i think if hadn't be there so he hadn't see that um yeah mine be a recap um you should probably leave a little bite of time i think we will have to i dunno actually whether who's do it becca becca's do it i look it up earlier
S0109	okay
S0175	um it's a good idea though let's start off in the middle of the session
S0109	it's just then though we've get the flower to do and the
S0175	mm mm
S0109	we're not actually gonna have that much time
S0175	so we've get snack question of the week and small group time and realistically we're gonna need at least ten minutes for question of the week and then fifteen minutes for small group time do you think that's twenty five minutes in total cos you've get to draw the box and talk about it with question
S0109	yes
S0175	and then go into small group and pray and share prayer and share
S0109	and can get over the whole discussion of what colour you like first
S0175	that's true i always miss that bite though because i'm produce yet another set of card
S0175	i should just do like come in on one friday and just make ten more set
S0109	um so er er oh brain do you say fifteen minutes
S0175	think that's too short i think if we have more than twenty five minutes that bit's get quite
S0109	yeah it's it's too long for the
S0175	yeah for those who aren't interest in it
S0109	yeah and the boys who don't like colour
S0175	mm
S0109	er
S0175	cos the boys be quite quick so ten min for question of the week fifteen min for prayer and share time with a game for those who finish earlier
S0109	mhm which will need to be quiet
S0175	yeah
S0109	that's a challenge
S0175	hello
S0109	hi er okay
S0175	it take quite a long time to make the flower
S0109	how many be they make er for the morning both morning service
S0175	i assume so i don't know how many we're make but it take a long time to make the flower you do it depend what they be do last time anyway take us a good half hour
S0109	i think we need to end on a good game
S0175	yeah
S0109	otherwise they'll think why do we bother
S0175	we could have do the flower and then do a very quick game cos if they come come at start a bite early
S0109	mm
S0175	if we don't finish pray till then but
S0109	mm
S0175	what we could do though be we could if we pray quite quickly and then set up the flower then as soon as they start arrive they can then join us join
S0109	yeah
S0175	in the flower cos if people come at twenty past we can get them start
S0109	yeah and you don't have that sort of mill around time
S0175	yeah
S0109	so in that case we don't need we don't need a intro game
S0175	no we don't need an intro game probably need one game before snack um so you could do some kind of variation of simon say er quite quickly um because that's um and you could then but you make it so with forfeit or something so that it can link in with the choices thing so either you do what the person either you follow your leader or you rebel against the leader
S0109	uh huh
S0175	um and you have a choice each time and if you and rebel against leader's end of the game for you
S0175	or something
S0109	oh you mean that even if they aren't gonna get a choice whether they rebel
S0175	well they could can't they you can decide not to i guess you can always decide how much you're concentrate it's it's a bite it's a bite weak cos actually you tend to not you tend to not deliberately rebel against simon say
S0109	i just just completely forget what i'm suppose to be do normally
S0175	yeah
S0109	but no i like it
S0175	but that's kind of on theme
S0109	mhm
S0175	and it's kinda short and long and you can make it and you can make it yes you can get them run around even you could say simon say touch both touch all four wall run around touch all four wall and get them run round or something um or it could be simon say go and have snack or no you know
S0109	mhm
S0175	um
S0109	cos you you know you can you can make that as elaborate as or as simple as you like
S0175	yeah and you can get them up to do it if they want to or
S0109	mm
S0175	um it isn't really friend or foey but it's kind of
S0109	live this way or live that way
S0175	yeah um
S0109	only cos my er main idea be more on the sort of friend or foe not choices cos it be things like
S0175	mm
S0109	um put around the room various um i don't know like superheroes
S0175	mhm
S0109	or whatever and their nemeses and their sidekicks and you have to decide
S0109	whether it's a pair or not and mix in some history or
S0175	but you could do that as the quiet game
S0109	mm
S0175	you could have picture and facts on bits of paper and they've get to match them up so they have like a picture of superheroes there's a picture of nemesis a picture of sidekicks there's a page of sidekicks a page of facts or something don't know what the facts be anything to do with but anyhow
S0109	mhm
S0175	and you can match them all up
S0109	that would that would be nice and quiet
S0175	would be nice and quiet and it'd be quite fun superheroes be quite fun
S0109	a bite woolly
S0175	a bite woolly indeed
S0109	er
S0175	yeah i like that idea cos that can that'd be a great quiet game superheroes great um so when they arrive we're do flower maybe simon say or something um it might be worth have another game up our sleeves just in case
S0109	decide to bring an army of friends
S0175	yeah or it it might also be well cos for some well for some years the flower haven't take that long because it's just be you know three things tie fine but last year we have take this take this take the do this put it in a cellophane like tie that with an elastic band put it in a
S0109	they be nice last year
S0175	cellophane thing then get a ribbon tie that and then use scissor to curl the ribbon the number of things i cut i be a wreck at that bite um and obviously each year we're do more and more as well
S0109	mm
S0175	i think we should allow half an hour say we start at seven twenty five say seven fifty five simon say you've get eight o five snack haven't you i think it's probably fine we won't play simon say for five minutes we might just get another game in there and then eight ten question of the week eight twenty small group er what you've get isn't it
S0109	er yeah but there's it's all movable
S0175	yeah
S0109	i just
S0175	it's just good start off with it um eight it's gonna have to be they're gonna have to give twenty minutes to small group time there's no way we're gonna do it in fifteen minutes there's no point be unrealistic just er eight forty big game
S0109	noisy big game um
S0175	so the other ideas i have er we could adapt giants wizards and dwarf
S0109	mhm
S0175	because that's kind of friend or foe like um we could do something call twin tag which be a bite like it or you could do a variation perhaps like stick in the mud where everyone run round with like arm link with somebody else at all time and so you physically
S0175	i haven't work out how exactly that would work but i'm sure we can work out something out
S0109	i'd love to see them burrow through people's legs
S0175	together
S0109	yeah
S0175	it could be a game or could run off backwards but er there's some you could probably do something like that um you could do um say talk about sort of foe um friend how many people can we get into an area or into a onto a table but not up here like low down so could we get everybody stand on a table this size well yes could we get everybody stand on the the shorter table possibly not could we get everyone stand in a very small area of mask tape so you can have in the
S0109	get very friendly
S0175	you can you can get people yeah exactly people on their shoulder or um and everyone's get to have everyone's get to have yeah they can have just one toe in the box but they can't have the other foot on the grind it have to be up in the air so they can kinda you can kinda like lean out and or balance or something and you get quite a lot of people that way
S0109	uh huh
S0175	all kinds of things
S0109	how you see that work what
S0175	well no i just it's just on this website i be look at this game website um so we could do something like that
S0109	mhm
S0175	again that's something we could do which doesn't take much prep um cos you can just have a couple of table and then some mask tape on the floor um i if we have mm i be gonna say if we have nine square out cos if we have nine square out none of the boys will do the flower
S0109	yeah hello
S0175	hello
S0175	yeah
S0109	very early
S0175	yeah
S0175	we've come to eat the mini roll and flapjacks actually
S0109	hm
S0175	i don't have a key for that one i'm afraid
S0175	sadly i'd like to have a key for that one
S0175	it would be very useful
S0175	but i don't
S0175	there's probably a key in the file cabinet where the spare key be keep
S0175	yeah
S0175	yeah
S0109	mm
S0175	um er i think we could be this if we have more time i don't i don't think we'll have the time for this we could get them to design an obstacle course for one another and you can either be friendly or you can be foe like
S0175	this be before i get to my choices thing so give them like material so so i'd say obviously they've get chair and table and stuff but you know how we often make obstacle course they could design one for the other team
S0175	all the team see you
S0109	see you
S0175	um memory verse game we haven't get memory verse game yet
S0109	what be our memory verse
S0175	it's um three thirty six which be i can't i haven't actually learn it yet um
S0175	it's about something like um tut anybody who confess no that's romans jesus be lord be save but anyone who do not will not will not have life but will have eternal separation or something um john three thirty six can't remember exactly john oh yeah they will not see life cos god's wrath remain on them or something whoever believe in the son have eternal life but whoever reject the son will not see life because god's wrath remain on him so it's our way or god's new way be the two ways to live
S0109	mhm um it's quite long
S0175	mm they're all quite yeah yeah though the idea i have with this to do with choices be like hangman somehow so they they'd do something and then they go up to a table and they say can i have the letter e and they go back somewhere else or perhaps go to a third place er where there's a leader with their with the blank and they say e and then the leader's there write down all the es um and then they go back to their basic like their home base again and then the next person do whatever they have to do and then go to the table and say r and then the then go to the wherever the leader with their piece of paper be and say r but you have to do it carefully because you don't want other team to see one another's answer otherwise they can just
S0109	mm
S0175	so they don't know which
S0109	so you could have them set up at the either side of the room but you'd only have be able to have about two team
S0175	yeah i hadn't really think it through completely
S0109	no just think out now
S0175	yeah
S0109	so would they huh would this have to come before
S0109	question of the week
S0175	um normally it do doesn't it
S0109	i be just think if they be do hangman oh no with that whole verse that's long no
S0175	yes but you see there's quite there's er you know it just mean that actually cos you here once you have e get all the es
S0109	ah and there's a lot of os
S0175	and there's a lot of os and there's a lot of i don't think i just don't think it's too bad it probably have most letter in it in fact
S0109	uh huh
S0175	it have js and vs and bs and like it have quite a good i haven't actually work out what letter it have in it but they could even have a bible so that they can even look it up and then they could just go back and say what letter they want if they be give the number but not the word
S0109	mhm
S0175	then even if they start with those those word they'd have a start you know the verse and chapter or three dot dot three they'd say it's probably we know we ought to write out the word but anyhow that be a an idea i have
S0109	i like it
S0175	but if we're do it before the question of the week that probably mean it doesn't simon say which be fine cos sometimes it's it's fairly
S0109	how yeah we need to make it so would they have something to do in their group in order before they could go and say a letter
S0175	yeah
S0109	and they in which case it would need to be quite snappy
S0175	yeah otherwise i mean everything they can just run and get a letter
S0109	they definitely need to run
S0175	they definitely need to run exactly
S0109	um
S0175	um so realistically how many might we have how many team might we need to have maximum four team possibly three team normally isn't it
S0109	it's normally three
S0175	i mean you could have one lot in the créche um with the doors open but so that the word kind of i can't remember where the pinboards be but anyhow somewhere in the créche um one lot use that blue thing um in that area there so the blue so they're use the side you can't see from if you're run backwards and forward and one lot behind one of the or behind the curtain or behind part of the curtain or even against that wall there behind the curtain
S0109	yeah
S0175	um with one curtain close and then they could all run to the spot in the middle here which be quite quite even for them to run to
S0109	mhm so
S0175	be that enough run
S0109	so they start from there and then they run out here and then they how how do that work in term of or or do they start there and the board be there and they run for the board because otherwise all the board would be here and they'll see what the team be do
S0175	but we could introduce a bite more run by them run to get the place where you get letter from and then go back again
S0109	oh
S0175	be what i be think so you get to run twice
S0109	uh huh
S0175	um but it's not very far for them to run but it's some distance for them to run i don't know how many letter there be and the thing be that they might come back with so i reckon the leader there at the or the or the leader be at the bank like and have three station would have the blank bits of paper and a pen and say when the person come and say i want an e they just write a capital e
S0109	mhm
S0175	just one and give that to them they run back give that to the leader who's in there and then that get pin up somewhere so they can all see they've they've have the letter e and then the leader can then have a bite of time to write down all the es from their like crib sheet
S0109	uh huh
S0175	um which somehow they've get to do without the others see
S0109	do you this be
S0109	just to introduce a bite of choice
S0175	yes
S0109	could they do something where if they they can either come and ask for for a letter
S0175	yes
S0109	or they can ask for a riddle or a challenge or something and if they get it right then they get a word
S0175	oo
S0109	so the they can take the time and speed things up perhaps depend on their ability or answer a question or something i dunno they still have to go back to their team presumably
S0175	or if they get the question right they get two letter cos get one one word do help but it doesn't help you with the other cos doesn't help you with any other word do there
S0109	no but they have to cotton onto that
S0109	no two letter would work i mean some of those be quite long word aren't they
S0175	yeah guess they're have to choose which letter they want
S0109	yeah that's true
S0175	um we just don't wanna take too long cos we haven't get much time i don't think
S0109	no and run twenty six time back and forth be not go to take too long anyway
S0175	no and hopefully they won't run more than that they might do if they keep on ask for es all the time okay
S0109	right should we
S0175	should we just scrap that instead of simon say and do simon say
S0109	and then memory verse
S0175	okay then we'll snack then question of the week then small group time and then we need a fun game
S0109	or two fun game
S0175	two fun game yeah eight forty and eight fifty
S0109	we haven't play dwarf giants thingies for a while
S0175	no although there be three set then and there be three ways to live
S0109	that's true
S0175	i just realize that
S0109	maybe we shouldn't do that
S0175	i just realize that maybe we could just do it with two and either you're a friend or a foe either you're the same but that doesn't really work either
S0109	but
S0175	maybe it's epistemologically too tight
S0109	mm you want to avoid stalemate one don't you that's the thing yeah
S0175	um
S0109	hm what other choices game or friend or foe game be there
S0175	maybe we should just do giants wizards and dwarf because it fit with like friend and foe and it's quite fun and if we do it the last game it doesn't really matter that it doesn't really tie in with the question of the week cos it's be a long time i mean we've get lot of things that do tie in with the question of the week
S0109	mhm and if it get swish out it get
S0175	yeah
S0109	um
S0175	and basically they're always foe unless they be the same be that right in which case they're friends there's always one way round where there's one beat the other but if they both team come together and they're the same then they're
S0109	yes
S0175	be that right
S0109	yes
S0175	cos they're friends
S0109	yep
S0175	what happen if you have three team do it work they could all end up chase one another or they could have two team one team chase after two team or two team chase after one team
S0109	or just a huge group hug
S0175	or a group hug
S0109	that could be qiute fun
S0175	okay
S0109	it could be chaos it could be fun
S0175	let's just think whether or not that will actually work logistically well i think it would be complete chaos i quite like chaotic cos it's just very funny especially as no one understand what they have to do anyway they have three team against argh be i run or not i don't know i can't run
S0109	the basic principle be just run
S0175	run no but it depend which direction when both of them run off in opposite directions you're go one of these obviously not right okay and then we've get the eight forty game
S0109	mm as much as i like the obstacle i think it would be too
S0175	i think it'll take too long won't it
S0109	long
S0175	hello
S0175	yeah i think you're right i think it'll take too long um
S0109	i be rubbish tonight
S0109	it's not really a run around game
S0175	mhm
S0109	but i just wonder about something where they have um they have to basically sort themselves out into team um by a sort of twenty question sort of scenario where they wander round and they've get i don't know their their name or of who they be or their team or whatever stick on their back and they have to sort themselves out and find out whether they're a friend or a foe to the people
S0175	hm
S0109	who they're with but it's more of an opener than a an eight forty game
S0175	mm quite like the idea though of have some kind of category then they've gotta get themselves into group that somehow
S0109	or for the choices thing something where where they mm it's a bite battleshipy sort of thing where there's a right or a wrong thing to be reveal um
S0175	i think about battleships cos i hear quite recently where if you go where you could have friendly fire somehow
S0175	enemy fire and friendly fire with mistake and things like that but i couldn't work out how to do that
S0109	or mafia
S0175	or mafia yeah where you've get somebody who um yeah you don't know if they're friend or foe and you've gotta work it out
S0109	oh let's play mafia i like mafia
S0175	okay i never really play mafia so you can run you can run mafia the boys love mafia don't they how long do it take to play
S0109	er how long be a piece of string
S0175	great perfect so we can judge see how they're do whether we want to go into giants wizards and dwarf or not
S0109	mhm mm
S0175	cos it's a sit down game isn't it
S0109	yeah
S0175	but it's fun
S0109	it'll also depend on their age like if we've get a particularly young group then we'll wanna cut it short cos they'll be a bite bore
S0175	okay well that's fine and we can always
S0109	yeah
S0175	if we need to or simon say if we need to
S0109	that's true
S0175	i'll put that back up simon say great okay i will liaise with whoever's do flower to work out what we need to do and where they're gonna be and all that kind of stuff because we're gonna get some instructions and i'm basically free not completely free on friday but i can be free on friday if i need to be teach how to do something
S0109	mm i will prepare the game for finishers early finishers
S0175	excellent and can you run mafia please
S0109	mhm
S0175	cos i don't know how to do that um shall i think about the logistics of the hangman game
S0109	cool
S0175	um um then it's just that's it isn't it giants wizards and dwarf we've just gotta decide who beat who um and then we'll probably want to do the open prayers before do i'll do the open prayer be you happy to do the close prayer
S0109	mhm
S0175	and i guess i think scott's still gonna get snack for us
S0109	excellent
S0175	great
S0109	and a final question would you like me to cook
S0175	oh i'd love you to cook
S0175	i think it's mean to be my turn but i would love that i'm cook for the bickerstaffes this weekend i
S0109	okay
S0175	or this or this week even
S0109	er how many people should i prepare for
S0175	mm if all the pathfinder leaders be there i think we've get eight now um but i'm not sure we be all there um plus probably nick and scott rick have a small amount if he come i'd normally cook for about ten in your mind cook for about ten people cos we can stretch it
S0109	mhm
S0175	and have smaller portion if need be
S0109	okay we can always
S0175	but it's like ten normal portion
S0109	cook more carbs
S0175	yeah exactly we can always cook more more rice
S0109	mm
S0175	be that alright
S0109	mhm that's perfect
S0109	i like have two weeks' notice
S0175	yeah exactly you've get it mean you've get a good amount of weekend to do it in
S0109	well i haven't but
S0175	okay you're away
S0109	i can do it next week
S0175	okay well at least you've get time to work out when you're gonna do it
S0109	yep
S0175	that's wonderful um yeah great
S0109	mm wonder why it's on hold
