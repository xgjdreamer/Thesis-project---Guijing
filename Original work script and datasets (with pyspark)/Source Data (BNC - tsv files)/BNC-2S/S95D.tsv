S0018	so how much be your bargain buy shoe
S0146	my bargain buy eh twenty five eh great british pound
S0146	em i don't know whether they'll be water resistant but you know what it doesn't matter they eh they do the job and they'll they'll be fine for work for as long as they last
S0018	they've lovely you look
S0146	i go i go to em
S0018	very smart in black
S0146	i go to these em i go to load of shop i just cos i'd be at work since like quarter to eight and then em my computer completely and utterly screw up and eh and i just think you know what i'm here i can't actually do anything and the team in birmingham actually be struggle so let me let me go up there and then it start rain and then my shoe actually start fall apart on my feet eh
S0146	and then i have a look around i go to the topshop flagship store and like you know the whole thing about like you know disposable fashion and you know it's really cool and buy it it's in and then you know buy something else doesn't seem to work because actually it's really expensive like the price be
S0018	totally and it's still a bad quality
S0146	yeah it's like bad quality and really expensive
S0018	mm
S0146	i just couldn't understand
S0018	go figure
S0146	so then i go to like you know cos they have the big department store isn't there like debenhams house of fraser and stuff so i walk through all those and i think if i can find a really nice solid pair of shoe like the brown ones i'd wear for the you know the ballet pump that i wear there you know to the point that doesn't really notice my fashion know know exactly what shoe i'm talk about whenever i mention oh your brown ones cos when i get them i wear them i think for a year and a half nonstop
S0146	and then i think if i can find something like that and then i do but they be like a hundred pound and i think you know what that's ridiculous
S0018	one hundred pound
S0146	for little ballet pump
S0018	and do they look like they be go to last
S0146	yeah i mean they be all like bertie pied de terre and all of that kind of stuff so they be they're pretty solid but if you wear them you would that's exactly what you would say i wouldn't pay a hundred pound for those

S0018	bon appétit
S0146	abso blink lutely
S0018	so what's in this there be em okay i boil the water

S0018	mm and now there's chickpeas in there
S0146	i be go to say and then yeah then do you add them afterwards
S0018	will that be okay with the for the sound
S0146	oh put it put it alright down how about that
S0018	and then blend it all up
S0146	yeah
S0018	and ta da
S0146	and then you add the chickpeas afterwards
S0018	yeah i just put chickpeas in now because i need some something heavy
S0146	yeah em
S0018	do you want to try some
S0146	yeah thank you mm
S0018	like it
S0146	mm what give it the sweetness
S0018	i guess it's the parsnip and the carrot cos there's nothing
S0146	yeah
S0018	there's nothing else in it at all
S0146	god that be so gorgeous
S0018	mm
S0146	try a bite of this this be em this be just curry tuna almost
S0018	how do you do this
S0146	with a god don't don't humour me
S0018	go on tell me
S0146	very very basic onion and garlic cumin sautéed this be so pathetic i mean i feel embarrass to tell you
S0018	it's not pathetic
S0146	i then everything be whack in pepper tomatoes em masala salt black pepper eh sweetcorn tuna
S0018	mm
S0146	mix and mix together
S0018	no it's really nice it's really flavoursome do you put tomatoes in it
S0146	mm
S0018	fresh tomatoes or chop
S0146	four
S0018	mm
S0146	yeah i do
S0018	be that what keep it a bite moist
S0146	yeah absolutely but then em i don't wait for it to dry out either so while they're all still a bite runny that's when i add the tuna and then just whack it together
S0018	mm hm and be that wholemeal pasta
S0146	mm hm
S0018	i don't think i've ever try wholemeal pasta before it's really nice
S0146	when you mix it up it doesn't taste bad at all and once you get use to it you prefer it almost
S0018	mm it's more eh more eh more eh i don't know
S0146	it's like brown bread white bread isn't it
S0018	i do like brown bread especially with seed in it like that
S0146	mm
S0018	warburton's stuff but sometimes white
S0146	mm
S0018	bread and load of butter be the best no but that's it's like wholemeal pasta it's like it's more meaty like it's more
S0146	absolutely yeah yeah
S0018	i'll have to get me some of that
S0018	then again whenever i do pasta it's so unhealthy i'm not think
S0146	why what do you do
S0018	just because i about every i usually do some kind of tuna pasta
S0146	mm
S0018	with red pepper onions umm a can of tomatoes a bite of garlic
S0146	so almost identical yeah
S0018	yeah just without all the spice and
S0146	yeah
S0018	without the sweetcorn
S0146	this be curry up isn't it
S0018	mm it's gorgeous and mine end up be more like a bolognaise sauce
S0146	mm
S0018	but the problem then be that i add so much parmesan cheese
S0018	i think i only eat it
S0146	really
S0018	so that i can put cheese on it
S0146	i find that if i eat it late and cos like when we have pasta fezel always want to put you know grate mozzarella or grate any cheese whatever cheese there be he want to pop it on the top and i find it make it quite heavy then
S0018	mm
S0146	especially late at night i mean parmesan's fine but you know but like full on grate mozzarella then blanket over melt
S0018	i know my parmesan be never light there's always at least an inch thick i get those little packets you can get from sainsbury's and they're already grate
S0146	exactly
S0018	and just stick it all over and then when it melt and go all stringy hmm
S0146	so what's go on with your work stuff now then what's cos you take a break didn't you
S0018	i'm wait to hear for a few job applications and and then i'll take it from there
S0146	mm
S0018	but
S0146	and so everything you will do just until september and then you'll start it again
S0018	oh the course no if i start the course again i'll start it in january because i've already do september to january
S0146	mm
S0018	so i don't have to do that bite again i would do
S0146	so you get a good big breathe space haven't you
S0018	mm hm definitely
S0146	do you think it would be okay to pick up from there then so you can just pick up and then
S0018	yeah it will be fine it will be easier to pick up from
S0146	yeah
S0018	that point
S0146	yeah
S0018	than it be complete exhaustion i've already do the first five months
S0146	mm
S0018	yeah and em at least i know how much work will be involve so
S0146	mm
S0018	i'll be able to try i'll try and do some before i'll do
S0146	yeah
S0018	i'll try and do a lot of it the academic work before
S0146	yeah
S0018	january so at least i have the
S0146	a bite of a head start
S0018	mm we'll see what happen
S0146	do you miss spain or be you get use to it a bite now
S0018	em i miss spring time
S0146	there's no spring here it's like bloody winter
S0018	i know yeah no i don't mind winter because there's winter in spain too it's just
S0146	yeah
S0018	my body tell me that now this be the time where you start wear sandals
S0146	relax a bite yeah it's slightly long next week be em british summer time
S0018	no
S0146	it be next sunday
S0018	yeah but the word british and summer time never go well in a sentence together do they have you get any holiday plan
S0146	no nothing at the moment
S0018	have you get any holiday time still to take
S0146	yeah i think i've get about five days and i'm gonna try and carry it over cos i've get no reason to take it actually cos i want to go to india cos you know my mum be and dad they both work for british airways
S0018	mm no i didn't know that
S0146	they do my dad be an engineer and my mum work for a british airways cater
S0018	mm
S0146	and they work for a a long time actually
S0018	mm
S0146	and em so we always have like up to the age of twenty four we'd have a really good staff discount
S0018	brilliant
S0146	and eh i mean the the flip side of it be the fact that you be always on a standby list
S0018	mm
S0146	but the good side of it be that as the years accrue and experience em pardon me and seniority like you know you get up the list a bite so you know it wasn't i mean i've have some disastrous occasion where like i remember one school summer holiday and me my mum and my brother go to india and we spend two weeks go to delhi like we be stay in delhi at my auntie's house spend two weeks go to the airport british airways flight no it's full that flight no it's full that flight no it's full stay there from like the afternoon to two in the morning
S0018	oh no
S0146	come back do the same thing again do the same thing again i remember do the same thing in toronto for a week i mean the the the delhi one be the worst my dad have to then fly because obviously with him fly we get a bite more seniority
S0018	mm
S0146	cos obviously there's a difference isn't there and em he then have to fly that weekend because obviously school be start again there i be think i be go to like my fifth fifth form or something and then he have to fly em and with his weight you know we get at least five hundred and two of us get a seat and the other two don't really matter that much and they just wait another few days and it be just because it be crunch time you know end of school holiday
S0018	yeah
S0146	em and the same thing happen in canada i remember and it's so soul destroy go there everyday and then like to run into happy passengers
S0018	aw
S0146	board and you're stand on the side cos you have to go and check in first as well
S0018	and you just wanna go home
S0146	yeah and then you watch everyone check in at the end of the holiday and then they wait and wait and in canada they be really bad they would take you right up to the gate and at the gate they would tell you so then you would have to ring someone to come and collect you at midnight and go home
S0018	oh no and where be you stay then wasn't that a problem with your accommodation
S0146	with em family and friends and whoever anyone it's be so random from like close family to absolute randomness and there be one time actually in delhi when i i do i do get stick and and because it be quite a sure safe seat and then what happen be there be fog and you know load of flight be delay and whatever what happen in this instance be that i'd come from the punjab i'd travel down for five hours and friends not even my family friends of the family these like they have say oh you know they take me out for like nice dinner and they say you know cos it look it be quite a clear flight and they say oh you know fine bye bye whatever and then drop me off at the airport and then about an hour later this like horrible mist start develop and then all the flight be ground they be ground for five hours and all i could ring be my dad up in the punjab and let him know what be go on and i keep i didn't i didn't you know really want to ring these people cos it's like you know come up to midnight and i think i don't want them to come all the way you know forty minutes in to come and collect me and stuff
S0018	yeah yeah
S0146	and i didn't know when i'd be sort of fly anyway i be there till like two three in the morning and then like my dad have to like properly coach me and he be like okay so em you know em what you have to do be you have to say you know on proper bbc voice you have to em you know act really official don't try and be nice be really you know and he be like really coach me and it absolutely work cos in the end they be like okay madam you know come and stay you know we've get a hotel for these occasion you know so they put me up and they really take good care all of a sudden
S0018	how go on give me an impression of how you do it
S0146	so i be just like em hi yes i'm eh yes so i'm a bbc journalist and i'm fly back to london you know my flight's be delay i don't have family nearby em you know can you put me up please
S0018	do it
S0146	yeah
S0018	that happen to me in sri lanka once we em we be fly from trivandrum to sri lanka from sri lanka to heathrow
S0146	mm
S0018	and we be get on the plane to come back to heathrow from sri lanka
S0146	mm
S0018	and they be all they be all these load of load of men in orange like guantanamo overalls crawl all over the plane on on the on the exterior of the plane
S0146	yeah
S0018	and everyone be like that's a bite strange what's go on here
S0146	mm
S0018	and then as soon as we have all sit down they be like sorry there's be a delay everybody off and they put us in this tiny wait room and the men the orange men we could see them they be still crawl all over the plane and this be like mm i'd have to say happen for about five hours and wouldn't let us out or to go to the toilet or to get water or anything and there be nothing in there and so there be this huge mutiny everyone be like you must let us out we have to go to the toilet you must provide us with water at least and em to be able to go and get some food and they be just weren't give us any information about how long the delay would be or when they would be able to let us out to go to the toilet and i think in the end they let us out and they give us some free food but then by then it be like we'd be wait for twenty hours they cancel the flight but it be only because we make a a huge stink about it
S0146	yeah
S0018	but they say okay alright we we'll book a hotel for everybody
S0146	yeah
S0018	but have we not say anything
S0146	they would've they would've have be fine
S0018	yeah
S0146	cos that be the other daunt prospect i mean leave the hotel at sorry leave the airport cos they say oh come back tomorrow you know just it's not safe to fly now and that be the other thing like leave where the hell would i go and i wouldn't trust a taxi driver with all my luggage and just me at two in the morning to take me to the right place
S0018	definitely
S0146	alive
S0018	so what be em what be you go to say that you be think of go to india but could you fly
S0146	yeah
S0018	with these special price seat then
S0146	yes so basically my mum and dad get like a couple of free ticket a year so like you know because they're both retire and stuff and that's sort of what happen and em and so like my dad can have one fellow passenger and my mum can have one fellow passenger and because you know politically because my sister be marry and there's three of them so then my dad pick my brother and then my mum pick me and my mum and dad be go to india so basically i would have fly with them and obviously because of the years of experience that we always get upgrade to at least business class
S0018	mm
S0146	it's just absolutely great you know fly with fly with them now be not have we get a seat it's be we in club
S0146	it's the it's like you know if you don't get that flight and then the disappointment no we're in world traveller plus aw
S0018	mm so can the if if they get free so if your parent can invite somebody to accompany them be that still like a standby seat
S0146	no well actually it's a standby seat but it's so high in the priority it's so so what happen be this be a whole big long thing right so basically like with anything they overbook so they you know seven hundred seat they will book for eight hundred and fifty know full well there'll be cancellations people won't get there in time people will lose their passports
S0018	mm
S0146	all that kind of stuff so there's always seat but as it get to your em like crunch holiday time so christmas holiday easter holiday and stuff sometimes and they're you know it some it use to happen quite a lot in the past but now there's like a big you know mushroom of budget airlines and stuff there's so many airlines but before when they be the standard carriers what would happen be you know where airlines would make a mistake where there's like an overbooking actually when people be desperate to get back and then they do say and then they get stick you know in the nineties they start these alliances
S0018	mm hm
S0146	so you just pass them on so you know british airways you know pass their passengers over to qantas and say you know i'm sorry would you mind fly with we'll upgrade you to first class or business class or something and
S0018	mm
S0146	you know circumvent it that way so there's a little bite of that go on but then normally they em they don't fill the seat so that's when you have you're you can have sometimes like fifty standby passengers actually i mean this be back in the day you know
S0018	mm
S0146	there be like they be the standard carriers now there's
S0018	yeah
S0146	you know air travel be cheap and all of that and so the everything's slightly different but most time you could have you know up to fifty passengers so actually then it come to priority and the more you know the more experience you be like my dad have like eighteen years of experience at british airways
S0018	mm
S0146	so he over the years accrue you know priority and we get push up the chain so actually you know retire people almost i think out of due obligation and certainly this be honour in the past would you know experience retire people would obviously be the first sort of you know you travel like normal passengers they wouldn't even really need to go into a standby list
S0018	no
S0146	and that's the same with us really so we now i mean the last time i fly i suppose with them be in two thousand and nine and that be em to calgary and it be peak time it be peak of the summer holiday and em it be you know in terminal five british airways we get there and literally what we do we check in i treat them to carluccios we have this really great lunch which i'll come back which be funny and then we go back and they say yes and then they give us four club class seat and we just walk straight through and go to the you know executive lounge chill out and then go straight through
S0018	brilliant i'm surprise they still do free flight nowadays cos british airways be cut load of
S0146	well they have a you know the year that my dad be make retire which be two and a half years ago that's when they introduce look either we're go to make further cut or for three months we want eight hundred staff to work without pay what do you prefer
S0018	what for three months it's crazy
S0146	i mean this be a a proposal
S0018	mm
S0146	i think i think it be reject by the unions
S0018	not surprise not surprise
S0146	it be almost a case of if you want your job if you want to keep your job you have to work you know for nothing or absolute minimum you know for a little while until we get over this em and i think it be reject and you know my dad poor thing you know he have a year to go to retire and you know he be first in the line wasn't he he take it quite badly cos he actually expect to stay for another year so it be quite hard actually
S0018	aw
S0146	still get over it
S0018	what so he have to retire a year earlier
S0146	mm
S0018	do that affect his pension
S0146	i'm not sure i i don't know much about his
S0018	but eh why do it affect him just because he wasn't ready to stop work
S0146	yeah emotionally it affect him completely and utterly because suddenly you know you have to mentally prepare for such a transition in your life
S0018	yeah true
S0146	and to like have spend your whole life do something and then all of a sudden tell you've get three months it's a bitter pill to swallow
S0018	yeah
S0146	and then what the hell do you do with the rest of your life you haven't like get yourself gear up for that
S0018	mm yeah well we'll probably be em we won't have any memories when we retire we'll be like eighty and shuffle around with walk stick
S0146	we hope
S0018	so what happen at carluccios
S0146	so we sit there on this little table a really small little table me my mum my dad and my brother and then em like there be quite a long table next to us and then there be like this guy look like a a guru like a priest you know almost like you know if he be bare you know bare chested he would have look like gandhi kind of thing you know like really really old and blah blah blah but he be in like mass like negotiations let's say he obviously have his business team all around him they be like oh you know and they be talk like high level market and they be talk about like high level economics to the point that i couldn't really understand you know but i know it be so
S0018	be you eavesdrop
S0146	so they be they sit as close as you be i suppose
S0018	oh okay
S0146	but on a a longer table and but they be like really and he be like especially like you know with his team they be like really hammer something but they they be all sort of lean forward they be like blah blah blah strategy structure something something like really go for it and then em and then all of a sudden i so we just carry on we're just like eat eat you know but keep look over like eat eat and think who the hell be this guy he must be someone quite famous right but none of us recognise him off the telly so we carry on eat and then all of a sudden like this one of his one of his cronies go and bring this little old lady over and so she walk over and then she come up and we just hear her she's like oh guruji i i'm so glad i've meet you i've come all this way and i want to catch you before you leave england and then all of a sudden the whole team be like completely like in this zen like aura and he be just like oh my god yes thank you i just have a simple glass of milk like he bloody eat a steak a minute ago
S0018	and what
S0146	and he be like and then she be like oh thank you i want to so obviously they're do that like class and where like you know this practice and that practice and whatever and he's like and he be like all of sudden he's like you know really really we be like you little phony
S0018	what kind of guru be he
S0146	god know little he be too busy talk about what money he be make rather than what he be bloody preach
S0146	the poor little granny god know how she get to terminal five
S0018	aw
S0018	it wouldn't surprise me if he be some kind of yoga guru
S0146	exactly go back to india
S0018	the one the ashtanga one em what's his name betabi joy he's be really slat by a lot of fellow yogis in india for push the market side and america and
S0146	well it be a money
S0018	make a profit
S0146	you know
S0018	mm
S0146	if you can't spin the money you know if you need to you can't get to be madonna's yoga teacher i mean that's it isn't it
S0018	it's not something personally i'd aspire to
S0146	no

S0146	she make it about three years ago and then she deny it be a comeback she just say look i have be in the industry but it be so funny so like this new presenter not new presenter but the presenter hadn't really do this sort of thing before and she have like a little sugar plum fairy more overdress than the poor little bollywood actress you know like really go for it and like there be one point when like the like my colleague hold up a white card to say you know we can't hear something be wrong with the earpiece thing
S0018	uh huh
S0146	so they have to take their earpieces out there be interference or something and so she keep hold the card like you know behind the actress to say take you know take you earpiece out something take your earpiece out and em and she and then so but she just keep go
S0146	and then in the end madhuri turn around and she say i think that white piece of paper there's an instruction should we just stop and see what what it's say
S0018	oh she hadn't realise it be
S0146	so then the girl run on the stage and she's say i'm really really sorry can you just take your earpiece out can you just take your earpiece out so they take their earpieces out and then the girl say to her who'd run on the stage oh if you want you know can you take your earring off please right so she say could you it's fine you can leave your other earring yeah but from that camera i'll have one earring on
S0018	darling
S0146	darling
S0018	can't be do i'm afraid i find it quite funny the way that all the women on tv like on the you know the national lottery show and the dance with the star and all that
S0146	yeah
S0018	they're all dress up beautifully but you can see that they've get this big they look like the hunch back in notre dame
S0146	yeah
S0018	because they've get the big
S0146	cable
S0018	big box underneath their dress
S0146	yeah
S0018	what be it be it for the mic yeah they've probably get one of those
S0146	it's kind of similar like a radio mic so the whole sort of em earpiece thing they've get a little bite in their ear as well but it with their big hear hair it's sort of kinda very discreetly come over and you can't see it cos their hair be down
S0018	ah okay
S0146	so you can't see it
S0018	ah i'll have to tell my dad he's to start wear a hear aid i'll have to tell him that he should grow out his hair
S0146	but you can get really discreet hear aid that just that don't get over the ear that go right in there right
S0018	yeah yeah he's get quite a discreet one actually he doesn't care at all what
S0146	yeah
S0018	what he look like
S0146	well i i be go to say i bet he doesn't really mind
S0018	he doesn't he doesn't particularly like wear it but it's not because it
S0146	yeah
S0018	it doesn't look aesthetic
S0146	yeah
S0018	when he be have em the radiotherapy for the skin cancer on his face the he have to have radiotherapy for like
S0146	when be that
S0018	eh last month
S0146	you didn't say anything
S0018	eh it's all preventative it's not it's nothing it's not it's not treatment for something that's still there cos they cut it out and the radiotherapy be just as a precaution to make sure that they get it all
S0146	and zap it up
S0018	yeah
S0146	when where be it though
S0018	right here on the cheek bone
S0146	okay so away from the eye
S0018	yeah just like but right under it but em so they make an incision and snip out what they could
S0146	yeah
S0018	what probably more than they think that they need to but just as a precaution they want to give him some treatments anyway when he be have the treatment he have to have it for consecutive days over a week's period and so the the surgeon draw on with em permanent ink like this big box on his face he be like it's permanent do you mind keep it on for the seven days so we don't have to keep draw it every day and dad be like no no problem and my mum be like you will not go out of the house with a big black box draw on your cheek bone so my dad doesn't care he's like yeah whatever
S0146	have it all be clear up
S0018	em he'll have to wait and see but you know because it be
S0146	you didn't mention anything
S0018	aw well he be quite chill about it it's it be a i can't remember what the name be basal cell carcinoma which be not at all very aggressive
S0146	what do that mean
S0018	it's a very it's one of the least aggressive form of skin cancer
S0146	okay so very benign
S0018	yeah yeah so and very treatable that's the thing nowadays cancer obviously it's still get that those feel of attach to the word cancer hasn't it but a lot of cancers be treatable nowadays i don't think it need to be so scary

S0146	no
S0018	the woman with her hand i didn't tell you well cos it's it they do it at the buddhist centre and you know they have they sell things like book and jewellery and incense and anyway i be in the change room and there be this woman stand in front of me have a conversation with someone stand in front of her and she have her back to me but her arm cross

S0018	so i think okay maybe it's a a like a plastic hand but they're use to display jewellery on or something anyway it give me such a complete start cos i think it be like actually her hand until she grab it off and start wave it over her head that i actually say oh my gosh what a shock i think that be your hand and then she turn around and i saw her stump arm and she say yeah it be my hand and i be so embarrass not aagh not because i put my foot in it but because i make her have to say so ah i just felt so but i felt so bad but i felt so shock that i couldn't actually say anything i be just like
S0146	i know what you mean i know what you mean i actually i actually
S0018	speechless
S0146	speech and then that person turn around like how have you just have this ladies conversation and you're a man
S0146	why do she take it off
S0018	because it be chafe underneath and have i listen to the conversation i probably would have understand the context of the situation but i be

S0146	if you be there at eight o'clock exactly gyms be bore though
S0018	they be
S0146	really mundane
S0018	well i just don't see the attraction of cos most of them be set up where the you know your tread mill and the spin things opposite a mirror and so it kind of just encourage all that all that all that testosterone stuff that you be talk about oh look at me
S0146	ooh ooh
S0018	aren't i rip
S0146	yeah yeah
S0018	ooh how many muscle have i get
S0146	yeah
S0018	i'm more muscley than you be
S0146	yeah
S0018	and i just don't like like what i like about yoga class be that everybody be in the same room yet they're all within themselves they're not compare each other to they're not go to push each other
S0146	actually i do find that sometimes yoga can be a little bite competitive
S0018	really
S0146	yeah like not competitive but like people look at the people you know like especially in like the hot yoga class like you could see like you could do the move and such such a big room there's a good fifty people in there so you can see the people that can you know and at my first class i be just i just look at them and i think you know great but then i realise that they be ballet dancers
S0018	yeah
S0146	so of course they're gonna be
S0018	yeah they're gonna be yeah totally supple and flexible and well the good thing be go to zumba class well that that wasn't good at all cos that be do in front of a mirror and i just
S0146	which one do you go to the dance workshop one
S0018	yeah be there as well
S0146	yeah
S0018	em but it be awful cos you have to do it in front of a mirror which make me look i be look at myself and i be think oh no you look so stupid but then i'd start look at everybody else like yeah they look stupid too
S0146	the only person that
S0018	even gorgeous blond girl look stupid do zumba
S0146	i be go to say the only person that probably doesn't look stupid be because she be a ballroom dancer like
S0018	oh no no no she look stupid too
S0018	but hey you can't be a you can't be eh can't be beautiful when you're sweaty and exercise
S0146	i don't think that teacher like that teacher be like i think zumba be brilliant i think the the whole thing's fun but that teacher like i think she enjoy the fact that everyone be out of sync all the time do you know what i mean she almost like sort of sadistic pleasure like
S0018	she like a little anarchy
S0146	yeah
S0018	in her ballroom
S0146	as soon as people like start to get it then she'd like change it completely
S0018	no i think you have to go a few time don't you to at least get the routines in your head i couldn't even get the step you know step that they repeat eight time
S0146	yeah
S0018	i couldn't even get those
S0146	yeah leave foot right foot
S0018	and it's all do in such a
S0146	da di da di da di da di da and then you're like da da de
