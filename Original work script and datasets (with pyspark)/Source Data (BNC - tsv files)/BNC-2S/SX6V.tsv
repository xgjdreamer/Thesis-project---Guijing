S0427	well i i didn't bring all of them just just a selection
S0426	how many have you get
S0427	mm well i i have something like seventy print out and not expensive i've get a few
S0426	select from how many photos four hundred
S0427	oh god well i i would say probably five hundred on two cameras yeah
S0426	before you show it be that the case last year that something happen to
S0427	yeah i yeah it start erm to leak it start to leak erm and i i lose a few but but my brother it turn out have take six hundred photograph on one camera so
S0426	shit it's not the same as your own photograph though of your holiday but
S0427	no i mean
S0426	at least least he get some
S0427	no i i i still have a fair number on one camera
S0426	right
S0427	erm but but not on the other one
S0426	right
S0427	so this be this be in the matobo hill which be a world heritage site largely it's a combination of the the this basalt gold granite rock i should say granite rock and the culture and the languages and all the rest of it but it's a world heritage site and in fact where we be stay be build around case like this
S0426	in fact probably build off that kind of rock
S0427	yeah and in fact sometimes that will be the wall the side wall the back wall and these be the kinds of place we stay in
S0427	so this lodge
S0426	wow
S0427	this lodge or chalet be on one of those
S0426	oh
S0427	but you're sit out point be across this bridge that's a bridge with the you know the wood and the rope and the
S0426	be it as wobbly as it look
S0427	it be yeah
S0426	ah
S0427	if you'd have a drop to drink the fall be just about enough to er
S0427	severely injure you
S0426	it's not impossible to fall between those
S0427	no
S0426	er strut be it
S0427	it it the thing be if the two of you go across the first one set up an oscillation and because my brother go across in front of me and that's what throw me but anyway that's a typical there's only eight place and this be one of them and of course a lot of them our washbasin for instance be make out of carve granite
S0426	oh
S0427	and that be quite and this be the matobo hill national park
S0426	be that the one where you approach very gingerly the white rhino
S0427	yeah yeah and this be er rhino one one four
S0426	oh right
S0427	erm apparently when we saw afterwards he identify it to the rangers and they say oh that will be one one four and so he's a bite white rhino er about fifty yards away
S0426	fifty yards away so you
S0427	about fifty yards
S0426	a little bite
S0427	yeah but erm all he do be keep twitch his ears and grunt and occasionally he'd turn away but he he he wasn't too bother he hang around for about eight minutes or so before he decide to go
S0426	what a beast
S0427	yeah and then we saw a little pride of lions they have cub but the cub be hide so we couldn't see them we do briefly see the the the the male lion i don't think i've get a photograph of him there be two females and something different then and you can see in the dry season how difficult it would be to spot these because their coat be almost exactly the same
S0426	just go back for a moment how far away be you from from that
S0427	we be in a vehicle but we be only about ten yards away
S0426	she wasn't perturb by that
S0427	well they do get out and wander off into thick bush after a while i think they get a bite miff with us try to manoeuvre the vehicle to get a better shoot and that's what i be think
S0426	yeah
S0427	and er they just think oh we've have enough of this and they wander off you know but they they not didn't run off
S0426	no no
S0427	they didn't growl or anything it be just a case of oh let's get some peace and quiet
S0427	just happen to catch him in the er at the long at the dust himself in the in the
S0426	that's a great shoot
S0427	in the stuff you know
S0426	wow wow
S0427	this be this be the secretary bird
S0426	i don't think we've see bird much in
S0427	no this be a secretary bird apparently name around about the early nineteen hundreds because a lot of secretaries in new york city use to dress in black stock black erm dress and white top
S0426	okay
S0427	and this be and when when they come to work they'd have a hat with feather in it
S0426	ah ha ha okay
S0427	bird be similar
S0426	good enough story but okay fine
S0427	yeah yeah and they they catch snake so all the locals love them
S0426	yeah
S0427	and that's the typical scene where i have a glass of white wine in my hand have finish a sunday drive
S0426	yes that's good
S0427	erm and these these be camel thorn tree here and that's the kind of sunsets you get you know it's a it's a tough old life i can assure you
S0426	it be a glass of wine rather than a g and t
S0427	oh they some people have g and ts but i i i stick to my er chill white wine
S0426	be it local wine i mean how local be it
S0427	it's south african
S0426	south african i don't suppose you've always get particular
S0427	it may have but we didn't come across it now these shots the next few be take from our hide which be underground so
S0426	oh this one's look up
S0427	this this
S0426	yeah that's
S0427	the photograph's be take from grind level
S0426	that's fantastic fantastic shoot
S0427	erm and the water be just by there and there be another water hole further down so you know that's the kind of impression
S0426	that's just amaze
S0427	and he know
S0426	just amaze
S0427	he know we're there but he's not bother you know because he can't see our silhouette we're not use flash we're not make noise
S0426	be their eye forward look or be they on the side of the head
S0427	they be mostly forward look yeah they have very poor eyesight but they would see you from that distance and and that's him again with the water come out and this be another little family that come up but it's because this be where the freshest water be it come out here and it bubble through a little gully down to a a water hole but there the water the water be all muddy and mush up because they they do everything in it
S0426	right yeah
S0427	but here it's absolutely in fact you and i could drink out of it it's come up through
S0426	through so much self filter
S0427	seventy seventy metres of kalahari sand apparently these be the night owl
S0426	oh aren't they sweet
S0427	at primary school which be in hwange national park and this be as we've arrive they're sing and dance for us and then they take us into the classrooms and show us their workbooks and erm charm
S0426	one thing they themselves have to buy their uniform
S0427	i think so and their for for this it's thirty dollars a term to pay so it's ninety dollars a year
S0426	and for what
S0427	and that that mean that there be some children who don't come to school
S0426	sure
S0427	and secondary school be a hundred dollars but but the participation rat be get a lot better this be us on an all day game drive where we've stop for lunch that's that's my brother there by the way erm and this be an american couple and this be the guide and his assistant have have take
S0426	take the photograph
S0427	and so this be lunch erm and they will see the table with help yourself food and this be what we're look at and we sit there for an hour and a half
S0426	put those together that's just a wonderful comparison isn't it
S0427	yeah yeah and we just have herd after herd of elephants
S0426	you just sit there and they parade in front of you
S0427	just watch yes and in fact we walk down to this area as well and he be say don't go any further because there's crocodiles and there's hippos
S0427	or if the if the elephants be come around this side he say we'll now come back now but when they be on the other side we could go down a bite and in fact one of the crocodiles do surprise the group of elephants erm and and make it make it startle and move away the reason be erm that the elephants have to be careful we actually saw an elephant that be perfectly healthy but it have lose the bottom eight nine ten inch of its trunk
S0426	trunk
S0427	and it have to adapt but it it be with the herd it be well feed and all the rest of it it be fine and that be a cheetah who the hell spot that i i don't know how the guy behind should say he spot that it look easy now but we be a fair distance away when he spot it and he must have eye attune to
S0426	just remind me of the difference between a cheetah and a leopard
S0427	yeah the cheetah be much lighter erm build for speed erm wouldn't harm or really wouldn't even think of harm a human be in normal circumstances
S0426	ah uhu uhu
S0427	a leopard will mostly run away from you but it could harm you if it want to and it's
S0426	again when there's er when there's young
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	at risk
S0427	and leopards be stealth erm hunters they get up close
S0426	yeah
S0427	these be obviously no but
S0426	ah yes
S0427	we have a sunday on our motorbike and then these be
S0426	look young that way
S0427	er not they're well they're they they look quite young in the sense that they be probably twenty twenty five year old but we can't see we can't see the matriarch but these be of childbearing age so to speak
S0426	okay okay right
S0427	they're quite small in in some ways but one of one of these have a little baby round here and this be us round the campfire i just want to point out the wine
S0426	ah
S0427	thing with with ice in it and er the bottle of chill white be be in there
S0426	how much of your own labour go into the appropriation of any of this none presumably
S0427	well i do i do pick up a a piece of wood
S0426	and throw it
S0427	and throw it in the fire
S0426	that's very good
S0427	and and and i do order the wine erm and like there be my glass and i i do pick it up and drink it
S0426	you do you hold it yourself
S0427	yes and i do take part in the conversations and there be the water hole from the water hole just down there so you know there be some now these be the elephants that drink out the
S0426	ah the one that's in the perimeter yes yes yes
S0427	so there be the water hole most of the elephants be down here but a few come up and i be stand on this deck on on the deck so i'm not far away
S0426	no no you couldn't be any closer
S0427	and you know
S0426	yeah
S0427	trick and some what
S0426	that's a great photograph
S0427	just a superb photograph and it's the delicacy and you know when the first one come up it put its trunk in and it go like that to knock the dust off the top of the water
S0426	oh
S0427	then it expel the water first of all and then it drink
S0426	right okay
S0427	so it's really quite delicate now this be how close you can get to an elephant this be in a vehicle that be my brother take a photograph of an elephant
S0426	uh huh that's a nice shoot i like it
S0427	you could you could almost touch it when that elephant be put its trunk out to smell us if you'd be stupid you could have touch the trunk
S0426	that would have be stupid yes
S0427	and they're drink from this
S0426	tiny
S0427	they make this this be where they've there's a pipe underneath here run along this track take water from a borehole to a a lodge somewhere and they can smell it even though it's underwater in a plastic pipe it's about a metre down they dig down puncture it and this be what they've get and this be fresh water to drink and they just weren't bother they weren't bother at all that we be there look you can see all the little ones their mother be not bother so they're not bother
S0426	yeah yeah by do to just the familiarity with the vehicle
S0427	this this particular one in fact say that he have i don't know whether it be this one or this one when we when we drive up i think how much closer be he go to get and he stop literally inch away from the nearest elephant and he say she probably won't do it because it's not cold enough but in the winter when i stop close to her she come up and put her trunk on the bonnet of my car to warm it up that's how relax this herd be but he know that and this be then move away from the waterhole
S0426	yes yes that give that give a much better sense of the the environment
S0427	yes it do be more this be more natural in a way than this kind of thing and the pool
S0426	yes yes that's right but okay
S0427	you know and there's a there's a grand they they they amble away they be like this when you see them go you know
S0426	what sort of temperature when you look at that what's it like what's it feel like to be in that environment
S0427	this er this this be very dry environment there be a not a lot humidity erm this be about thirty degrees erm
S0426	hot
S0427	centigrade
S0426	hot
S0427	yeah it be it be quite hot erm between twelve and three o'clock it's erm it's hard work go anywhere and and this be erm victoria fall erm and you can walk you start at this end this be the start and you walk along this gorge here the drop for about a kilometre and a half and there be the classic er
S0426	mm yeah the classic rainbow
S0427	rainbow thing
S0426	that be spectacular there's no doubt about it that's just spectacular
S0427	yeah and of course this be the low flow season so you don't get the huge noise and the huge spray though there be quite a lot of spray erm but you can take photograph because you're not get drench
S0426	otherwise you'd yes you'd be drench
S0427	and this guy be very close to the lip fish for a live
S0426	oh christ god
S0427	erm i mean that's that's brave that be and that be the thing go over the edge
S0426	ah that's good that's terrific
S0427	yeah and that side be zambia and you get the best view on this side from zimbabwe
S0426	oh that's even better that's a great photograph
S0427	that's erm
S0426	just just great
S0427	but they they tell me that in peak flow the water would be come over here as well
S0426	wow
S0427	and if the wind be come you wouldn't want to take your camera out
S0426	you'd get drench
S0427	because you'd probably probably get drench yeah
S0426	superb
S0427	yeah
S0426	just superb
S0427	i i i i enjoy print those off and well make the selections i should say
S0426	you send them away to be print
S0427	yes i use erm snapfish and erm i i have about seventy of these ten by eights do and they only cost me er thirty quid
S0426	definitely worth it
S0427	yeah it's erm it it's er
S0426	i mean when you see it on the screen it's it's more encompass you can't really riffle through them in the same way
S0427	no and in fact with some of the others erm you know 's mother be quite age now and she's not into computers and things like that and so i'll send a few photograph with a commentary up to her because she like that kind of stuff
S0426	yes yes that's nice yes that's right yes
S0427	erm so i won't keep i'll probably keep these but there be there be another thirty odd that weren't quite as good as i think they be go to be or they be duplicate this stuff
S0426	yes that's right
S0427	you know
S0426	i think you're right to be as selective as you possibly can
S0427	yeah
S0426	because that mean each one have get its own you know impact without it be dilute by see similar
S0427	yeah yeah i i mean i think that's right i mean i have another three or four of the rock but i think well they're interest to me but you've see one rock formation you don't want to see another three or four you know
S0426	and some of those if the resolution be good not probably the one that have like the rhino but could be mount in some way
S0427	yeah i mean in the past i've have real favourites put in a frame and i've keep
S0426	you've get a couple in your room
S0427	i have i've get a few in the room and i've get one or two in the house but but i have to stop myself though because you know i mean you could come to my house and then think 's start up a shop for africana you know
S0427	because i i mean i i didn't buy a great deal
S0426	no no
S0427	in zimbabwe
S0426	right right
S0427	but it be just as well because when i come back i think oh i've get another carve
S0427	it's a it's a teak bowl it's another one it's beautiful and it's teak it's fantastic hmm well i suppose if i take that one and put it upstairs out of the way i could put that you know i mean i be i be more or less full up
S0426	yeah yes yes up there well yes but these aren't like you see the nice object in a in john lewis and you think oh i like that's it's a very different kind of thing this be a genuine memento i suppose too
S0427	mm yeah yeah yeah
S0426	just a nice object which you find in a shop in britain it's a different kettle of fish entirely
S0427	i i i buy a a i bring a bowl back for
S0426	mm
S0427	and erm so i give her the bowl and she be really very please and then the next day i think oh i never tell her about it so i send an email say it be i'd buy it in the village where mr have take he's the head man he'd take us around and introduce us to his wife and then we do this that and the other and then we end up in this little market place and the woman there say it be make from redwood and they'd polish it
S0427	and they get the colour from boot polish
S0426	oh christ
S0427	which they rub in erm you know and and and that's what i bring and and she say oh what a back story this be wonderful
S0426	there's so much to exactly
S0427	you know so it's i think you know i suppose more than a bowl in some respect you know
S0426	i mean compare to the back story well it be on the third shelf up in john lewis you know when you walk past things
S0427	yeah yeah it be a bite different yeah
S0426	like those big giraffes you see on the floor and erm ceramic tigers
S0427	yeah and in and in yeah and in and in and in john lewis be probably nearer a hundred dollars or the equivalent rather than nearer what i pay for it
S0426	that's right and although the original
S0427	yeah
S0426	buyer wouldn't have pay as less as you pay for it so
S0427	yeah no
S0426	terrific really wonderful
S0427	but er yeah so erm do you see your er third year dissertation students and how many have you get
S0426	well there's lot of students staff so it have to be more this year than it would normally be so it's ten
S0427	oh i've get eleven this year but that's
S0426	again you're in the same position as we be
S0427	yeah yeah yeah that's right erm i saw most of them one or two couldn't turn up so i'll i'll see those on monday so you know it's not too bad erm
S0426	i think if you split them into two group it's doable six and five
S0427	yeah well i i'm go to see them individually after all this
S0426	be you
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	that's a lot of work
S0427	i i only see them well i'm i'm just use to it i stack them up like plan at heathrow if you see what i mean say say i've get eleven when things start warm up there'll be five or six who be all finish work in in one week and i'll have you know someone two o'clock someone two thirty someone three o'clock someone three thirty four o'clock four thirty and then i've do that group then you see and i'll have readied i'll have read their stuff the the the day before and er make comment on it and stuff like that
S0426	but i'm see them every week
S0427	i'll probably see them every other week
S0426	okay well that's more doable okay
S0427	yeah i in i could see them every week but i think it would only be if they come to me and say i'm i'm write this i want to ask your advice about it
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	because normally the deadlines that we agree together they need more than one week in order to produce
S0426	okay
S0427	a particular piece of work
S0426	right
S0427	they meet weekly with and the others do the dissertation module which be a different thing from the dissertation supervision
S0426	okay
S0427	but now i don't know whether your people do that erm but there be a dissertation module which and maybe have something to do with and it's
S0427	and it some of it be subject specific
S0426	right
S0427	and some of it be general so plagiarism would be general
S0426	okay yeah
S0427	now the first meet be today eleven till one
S0426	ah
S0427	so but the first meet today be meet your supervisors so i happen to see mine in the morning and then cos i have to go to sainsbury's at for elevenish so i couldn't see them then erm
S0426	well that clarify something which be a bite unclear in my mind because they my students be talk about this thing i think i better not interfere
S0427	yeah
S0426	so there be this thing with with put as a department with representatives from each group
S0427	well i i don't know the full ins and out of it erm if i if i remember when i go back i'll might forward you the email er which which which might give you some idea about the structure erm but i know various people be contribute there be stuff on plagiarism and erm might be people from the library come down to do stuff on
S0426	it's sort of be that right
S0427	yeah well i suppose it yes in a way it be er but it would be subject specific erm no sorry erm but it would be dissertation specific and i think when it come to say quant methods there be one bite of the timetable i saw where it say erm discourse soc sci students and discourse analysis and then it be what would it be erm content analysis cms you know and i'm talk very very roughly now
S0426	dissertation specific yeah yeah yeah
S0427	and i think oh yeah well i could see how they'd split up into that
S0426	right
S0427	you know so if i if i can find that i get so much as programme director i only keep stuff that i know
S0426	yeah
S0427	be go to be but if i find it i'll forward it to you so you get some idea of what be go on
S0426	it sound like a good idea in so far as
S0427	i think so yeah
S0426	there will be commonalities in the
S0427	yeah exactly
S0426	so all confront like plagiarism for example and use the library and so on although many of our our our students probably yours as well have come across well google search you know google scholar or
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	but they haven't all come across web science and psych info in ours
S0427	well no no that's true
S0426	and that can be something which they wouldn't otherwise know about unless somebody tell them
S0427	no i think for the you know the more keen or the better students that they'll get a lot more out of it my i may have get this wrong but my impression be there be a light touch to this because i know part of it be about drop stuff and and be say she'll be available
S0426	yes
S0427	but you're not mandate to come so i mean the ten weeks it's not a it's not a heavy duty tick the register kind of thing at least i i didn't get that impression but er it's there you know for for people
S0426	but you know our experience when we have these drop things be that a most students don't turn up and b
S0427	that's true
S0426	the students don't go the ones who do go
S0427	yeah
S0426	if you at least because they're they know what their problem be and they could probably solve it by themselves
S0427	it it
S0426	the take up be usually something like twenty percent
S0427	i think this might i mean some of it be mandate as in you should go to this and and some of it might be a drop in clinic or clinic about x y or z and i think that looser function might have be because last year it be all mandatory and the people weren't turn up and be there fiddle her finger kind of thing
S0426	right right so she might as well turn it into a non mandatory
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	and then okay
S0427	but i'm not absolutely sure i couldn't i mean it it in horror it come to me and i think this be the first i have hear what i'm not do this way and then i saw 's name and i think oh yeah it's who do this so er so she's
S0426	well it's good of her though cos she's get plenty on her plate without that kind of stuff as well
S0427	yeah but she seem you know quite keen to do it really to to to bring their skills on
S0426	right yeah that's what she's like she'll do oodles of work
S0427	yeah yeah that's right
S0426	anything happen about the chair advert
S0427	oh er yeah well i think it's erm i think the advert be out there now
S0426	that's good
S0427	and also the one to replace with the lectureship
S0426	excellent excellent
S0427	erm they've both be advertise so we know date for interview and we've get the process what's happen now be that er various of my colleagues be try to approach people individually
S0426	good i think that's
S0427	and say be you interest in apply and they be try to get an assessor i mean i i i get in touch with who would've be brilliant he's go to be external examiner for but he can't do it
S0426	okay
S0427	unfortunately but they'll or someone like that might well do it you know
S0426	what about your internal sorry your external examiner for for the programme
S0427	er well that would have be an obvious choice i don't know whether that's allow or not i don't know erm anyway that's pass that's pass out of my hand now to the like of and and who who know more about the field
S0426	right
S0427	than i do
S0426	right
S0427	you know erm and so
S0426	i think supplement the broadcast and with the odd email
S0427	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0426	and do you know this be work this be happen that kind of thing put it on twitter all these things help
S0427	yeah i agree
S0426	you want some a large er field as possible
S0427	yeah
S0426	both to get the best candidate and also politically because it be important to show
S0427	and that's right and be go to be on the interview panel for the professorship and i'm go to do the one for the lectureship which i'm you know happy
S0426	excellent it's crucial to have one of you on the panel
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	it would make no sense at all because who know what criteria they would use without somebody who be on the teach side say look this person wonderful though she be or he be just couldn't do the teach
S0427	yes or they could do the teach and they be wonderful but my god it's another horror name like we've have in the past and the alarm bell be go off in my head say no no no no no no no
S0426	would you insist on see a picture of these applicants just in case they've change their name
