S0536	i've get cramp
S0486	have you oh right
S0536	and i just think i'd er
S0486	alright yeah
S0536	yeah
S0486	let me move those around
S0536	yeah that's it yeah
S0486	do you get cramp often
S0536	erm er fairly frequently yeah
S0486	do you
S0486	well well for the tape we're sit in a very small erm ticket office here at the model engineer and be with me this morning and he's go to talk about well why be you a model engineer
S0536	i think it's an engineer background my father be
S0486	ah
S0536	a civil engineer
S0486	right
S0536	and erm i study er engineer at at college actually and then erm go into engineer initially as a as a post as a erm graduate apprentice for
S0486	right right
S0536	erm end up at their apply research laboratories at
S0486	right
S0536	and er work on just er to start with guide weapons and then on er satellite communications
S0486	very interest
S0536	then i erm form a company with a couple of friends and erm we sell print equipment all over the world
S0486	right print equipment
S0536	yeah we actually modify we actually produce modifications for exist equipment
S0486	right
S0536	erm we'd all work for one company who be at the time be a majorly a brand leader in the area and we produce electronics for the print industry
S0486	right right because erm in the in the i i work for newspapers for quite a long time for about sixteen years i work for the and do you do anything at all with with the the press
S0536	i i never really use to most of my time be spend in the laboratory i
S0486	right
S0536	i i run the r and b department
S0486	right right
S0536	and erm
S0486	erm right so you be research and development and erm really you're the boffin behind the the engineer not not the sales person or the
S0536	no occasionally we we'd go out to see customers when there be
S0486	right
S0536	a particular a particular problem the company be small enough so that you erm er everybody have a go at everything practically
S0486	right right and how many people be there in your company
S0536	er the maximum it be about thirty
S0486	right
S0536	but most of the time it be about twelve fifteen something like that
S0486	right right and erm you must have see a lot of change with print techniques over the years
S0536	erm yes erm the er i work for two company erm before go independent one be
S0486	yes
S0536	and so i saw the development of the scanner from the early analogue scanners to the later digital scanners and so on
S0486	right
S0536	and then it move to and produce one of their er or design one of their miniature scanners which er be the er sort of last generation before the desktop really take over and er
S0486	yes
S0536	people start use small flatbeds
S0486	yes i remember the erm in there be a sort of like a it be like a piece of cardboard er be it call er er er a system where it be impress on a piece of card and then that be impress onto a roll that be put on a roll and then it be roll out what
S0536	oh
S0486	be that method call that come somewhere in the middle
S0536	yes i've i i well i never work on the press side so i i
S0486	oh you didn't well they adopt
S0536	it be purely
S0486	that method at one stage and what the the card the residue cardboard that they leave behind i use to paint on i use to sort of try and
S0486	bend it back the other way and paint on the back
S0536	yes
S0486	but that be very interest
S0536	yeah
S0486	i wish i hadn't get rid of some of those though they be er they might be worth something today erm but er a lot of erm these process they're good for a while and then they just go don't they
S0536	they do yes i mean the the although some of the high quality work be still do on the kind of scanners
S0486	yeah
S0536	i work on
S0486	yes
S0536	most of it's now go to the flatbeds which you put on your desktop
S0486	yes yeah in the metallic print erm they've still get in university and a lot of the universities now and in the art departments they use old print block
S0536	yes
S0486	a lot of the time and they put
S0536	yeah
S0486	you see it integrate in art and erm i have erm two block that i use for my initial when i do a paint i frequently you ink them up and stick them on at the bottom if they're in a piece of abstract work i mean it's not relevant in something that's smaller but er yeah so erm and and now you've retire and erm have er what have you get on the go as far as engines concern er any engines at all
S0536	er yes i tend to build things in parallel because i like
S0486	right
S0536	to be able to swap between different scale and
S0486	yeah
S0536	different size
S0486	oh right
S0536	and so i'm build a two and a half inch gauge model of one of the american er wartime austerity locomotives
S0486	oh right
S0536	a five inch gauge man wardle
S0486	oh right
S0536	and a seven and a quarter inch gauge hunslet
S0486	not much then
S0536	no no just just enough to keep me happy
S0486	so how much time do you spend in the workshop every day do you think
S0536	erm it obviously vary but er erm i quite often spend the whole day in the workshop
S0486	do you
S0536	cos it's
S0486	yeah yeah and do you find that if you don't get your model engineer do it it impact on your erm er humour
S0536	not particularly no but i i do yes i i you do suffer from withdrawal symptoms
S0536	if you don't er get your fix occasionally
S0486	it yes erm i notice erm obviously cos i live with i i i notice that he he get he he he never get cross but he he do get slightly irritate i think if he can't get and do what he want to do he feel he he's in a middle of a project and he want to and be say the same you know he he he just get very disgruntle if he can't get on with it
S0536	i think probably we we all tend to feel that way yes
S0486	yeah yeah
S0536	but er
S0486	and i'm the same with my art if i've get to if i'm divert by do housework or things that i really don't want to do i i do get grumpy
S0536	yes
S0486	and i need to get erm i do i actually get very temperamental altogether so i've just get to get in there and do it you you see so you've be come on these work party now for how long
S0536	virtually since i join the club
S0486	really
S0536	about five years
S0486	five years yeah yeah
S0536	one one time there be only three of us who normally turn up
S0486	right

S0486	yeah
S0536	i quite enjoy it yes
S0486	you do yeah
S0536	yes i think it i think it's get to the point have do it for now about three or four years i that it's er time that i
S0486	oh
S0536	hand it over to somebody else
S0486	oh right
S0536	for them to er
S0486	oh so now you've be do it for three or four years and then be before you be he or
S0536	he he be yes
S0486	he be yes so i'm right out of date because
S0536	mm
S0486	isn't it funny how the years go on and you still think oh it's still think it's and in fact it's yourself so
S0536	mm
S0486	dreadful so you you how much time do that take up
S0536	erm it take up most of a week basically
S0486	do it
S0536	to put each er
S0486	yeah
S0536	each edition together
S0536	erm
S0486	that's a big contribution as a volunteer isn't it really
S0536	er yes it be er
S0486	but it's your hobby as well
S0536	it that's right it be
S0486	yeah yeah but erm have you ever think of have a woman's page in
S0536	erm i've never have a contributor who give me any any contribution but i'd welcome it yes anything new i mean it's
S0486	anything new
S0536	yeah
S0486	i be actually think about this erm show you're plan next year and erm think of have i mean i i'm a member of the model engineer because always pay for me to be a member i wonder how many other of the ladies be actual members and if they be erm whether we ought to have some sort of contribution in there because we be actually members and i sometimes think
S0536	yes
S0486	nothing big just just you know just some line every now and then would be nice
S0536	well we do have contributions from the various section
S0486	yeah yeah
S0536	of the at the library
S0486	yeah
S0536	erm occasionally from the and erm
S0486	yes
S0536	so yes it be no real reason why there shouldn't be a section
S0486	no i
S0536	even put something in from the nomads occasionally
S0486	do you
S0486	yeah so erm erm when you be do your job originally look back at the begin of your career after you leave university erm do you do you sort of fall into that erm way of work or do or be it something that you really want to do
S0536	oh no i i know i want to go into design and development
S0486	right
S0536	into r and d right from the start
S0486	yeah yeah
S0536	and erm say i although i've erm i er well we start the company i be a director of the company so i have responsibilities
S0486	right
S0536	as a director
S0486	right
S0536	but erm i be always involve the technical side yes
S0486	right what would you say over the years be the most satisfy project you work on
S0536	oh that's difficult erm
S0486	or one of them you know
S0536	erm well in some respect the the well when we be work when we be er become independent erm we erm produce an interface between the establish erm graphic art scanners
S0486	right
S0536	er and the desktop
S0486	right
S0536	and we be virtually the first people in the world to do this so we
S0486	right
S0536	erm one year
S0486	that be an achievement yes
S0536	yeah one year we export ninety two percent of our product
S0486	really
S0536	and we get a queen's award for industry for it
S0486	my goodness
S0536	erm so it be that be perhaps the most in some respect the most interest
S0486	yeah erm erm
S0536	and so
S0486	where be where do you export it
S0536	erm we a lot go er to the state
S0486	right
S0536	erm one of the directors be marry to a japanese lady
S0486	oh right
S0536	and we export quite a lot to japan
S0486	yes
S0536	erm and in and the rest of europe in general
S0486	right
S0536	we have quite an active agent in germany
S0486	right
S0536	and erm so virtually the whole of the world
S0486	the but it because you be more er you be obviously research and development do you you do get sometimes obviously a chance to go to these place do you or or travel at all
S0536	er yes in erm er my wife have a a horse and we have a horse box
S0486	oh right
S0536	so the my company car be a erm a discovery
S0486	right
S0536	and that be use to tow the company's trailer whenever we go to a show
S0486	right
S0536	and so i often end up drive the thing down the autobahns to dusseldorf or somewhere
S0486	oh right oh i see
S0536	load with er
S0486	oh right
S0536	all sort of bits and piece for the show
S0486	yeah yeah they're very fast those autobahns aren't they well erm we live in germany for a while and erm i think it be before we really have very many motorways er it be nineteen i'm talk nineteen fifty eight
S0536	yeah
S0486	and erm in those days i remember travel on the autobahn and think well be it in nineteen fifty or i go back to germany in erm nineteen sixty seven as well so it could have be nineteen sixty seven but they their roads seem to be far more far faster and bigger than than what we have in england but it may be just me mm
S0536	yes i no i just take them take them my stride yes
S0486	you just er yeah you do really just er
S0536	with three tonnes behind and a land rover
S0486	yeah
S0536	you're not gonna go very quickly anyway
S0486	no no and so when you be there and these exhibitions you be talk to people as well be you
S0536	yes
S0486	yeah yeah
S0536	in fact the idea for the interface really we we first put out at a a show just to sort of see what the kind of response would be
S0486	yeah
S0536	and erm we get people from all sort of part of of the er show
S0486	right
S0536	come from other company say
S0486	right
S0536	this would be interest so that be really what er push us into do it
S0486	absolutely i mean i've be to with to er where they do the huge erm industrial show for the railways and also i go to with him in fact try to find him the place the site be so big that try to find on the site be really difficult erm
S0536	yeah
S0486	and it take so long to get there and i use to find i'd get there and find he be deep in conversation with a potential customer and which i of course wouldn't wouldn't even wink at him you know
S0536	mm
S0486	erm and then i'd have to find all my way back
S0486	so erm it be a bite of a shame really and erm you know there you go but erm and that's over now and that twenty years of that erm yes it's it's over he be there a lot longer so erm do you meet your wife at work or
S0536	yes i do yes
