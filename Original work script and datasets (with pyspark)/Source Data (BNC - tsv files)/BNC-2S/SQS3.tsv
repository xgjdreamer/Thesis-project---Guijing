S0015	not very good surgery risk oh god don't like look at this the needle er the rate of complication be low around one percent several study have find complication rat to be higher for around five percent that's the the operation i suppose some possible complications split of the skin
S0015	with the needle during mm oh my damage to the nerve supply sensation to your fingertips the nerve can be repair but it's unlikely the finger would recover their full sensation
S0281	oh awful
S0015	joint stiffness er you can be help with
