S0144	yeah
S0024	oh beers
S0144	well from beers in the afternoon
S0144	seriously can't do it it's not good
S0024	i only have a few pints and i be i be feel really lazy in the in the even
S0144	oh dear look we're gonna have to
S0024	you have a nap
S0144	well yeah i have to and then i have a hangover in the even
S0024	yeah that's not good
S0144	we'll have to be very careful when the er for the party
S0024	yeah i know i be think about that
S0144	not gonna start drink til the sun go down
S0024	no i be think i need to stay away from the beer altogether
S0144	yeah
S0024	and drink something else
S0144	yeah
S0024	i need and not mix
S0144	i know
S0024	cos the last thing you want be to feel drain or i don't think you will cos it'll be too excite but
S0144	yeah
S0024	i be talk to yesterday about the food about what we're gonna do the food be the main problem now
S0144	yeah
S0024	but oh we
S0144	well it's not a problem be it
S0024	well it be cos it you've get to have enough food for everybody
S0144	yeah yeah but you shouldn't look at it like a problem it's a
S0024	it's yeah but cos we're do it all ourself
S0144	just something to do yeah well we need o plan it basically don't we
S0024	oh and well we be say maybe i should make some practice samosas i've never even make samosas before and i've write all this stuff that i want to make for the party
S0144	yeah
S0024	and i've never even try to make them
S0144	yeah
S0024	so say make some samosas and put them in the freezer and then see if they work quite well heat them up from the freezer
S0144	oh okay and yeah
S0024	and then
S0144	that's a good idea
S0024	then we can make batch now
S0144	yeah
S0024	and put them all in the freezer ready
S0144	save panic at the end
S0024	yeah so i might get a recipe and oh monday tomorrow tomorrow
S0144	yeah
S0024	i'm go after zumba i'm go a with mum to dereham i say we're gonna stop of in tescos and get all those illuminous balloon that we like
S0144	yep
S0024	so we need to work out how many we want
S0144	yeah
S0024	and er what colour cos there's the red ones and there's the white ones too
S0144	yeah
S0024	so mainly red but i think a couple of white ones might be quite nice somewhere i dunno
S0144	yeah
S0024	or do you want all red
S0144	i dunno the red ones be pretty cool cos they look like buddhist lanterns don't they in the dark
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	quite nice
S0024	so shall i go for all red
S0144	yeah because ewe're not use them to actually illuminate an area be we
S0024	no
S0144	cos they're not that powerful be they it's just for effect
S0024	yeah okay so we'll do that i'll get them and then um i still don't know obviously i don't know whether the cutlery and stuff i be write all those note and research so much about which ones be the best and i i have in my head which ones be the best and now i have no idea again so i've completely forget and we need to go to and take back those back those crappy glass that we buy
S0144	yeah
S0024	and um and work out which ones cos we need them now
S0144	yeah
S0024	we need them now cos otherwise we will panic
S0144	yeah okay
S0024	and they might go up in price over the summer cos everybody will be have barbeque and stuff
S0144	yeah and i be think we need to plan like the actual day what time things be gonna happen
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos i need to make the playlists for the music
S0024	yeah
S0144	for different periods like music to be play while people be arrive music play when we're gonna do our just before and after our speeches music play over dinner
S0024	yeah
S0144	music play before the band and in the er intermissions of the band
S0024	be you gonna put them all on
S0144	and then er after the band
S0024	if you put them all on separate cds like dinner music
S0144	yeah i'm go to yeah
S0024	and then
S0144	but we need to think what kind of atmosphere we wanna create
S0024	yeah
S0144	in those time
S0024	and then i need a salsa section
S0144	salsa
S0024	just like fifteen twenty minutes or something
S0144	yeah well that's the thing it's gonna be difficult mix the genres
S0024	well we could could announce it like
S0024	the salsa section put on the salsa cd
S0144	yeah yeah that's gonna take a hell of a lot of work cos i wanna mix the songs together
S0024	yeah oh
S0144	the programme i've get doesn't do it
S0024	that that um 's get a um a scratch oh what do you call it
S0144	mix
S0024	a scratch mixer i don't know 's call something it's something like that and you can play music from the computer
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then it's get these turntables
S0144	yeah
S0024	and you don't have to have a um er record on them or anything and you but it's get fake record on it and you use the record as a scratch for the mp3 file and you can wah wah wah i don't know you can slow it down and speed it up and blend in the next one
S0144	oh i've get i've get like a virtual dj
S0024	oh no it's a real one
S0144	huh oh he's get a real one
S0024	a real one
S0144	oh okay
S0024	and it's it's a fake yeah well it's like your virtual one but it'll be much easier to use and you'll be able to record it
S0144	oh you can record it yeah
S0024	i guess so
S0144	cos i don't want to be do it on the night
S0024	no no no
S0144	the trouble be though you need if it if it's get two sound card in it where you can mix it properly
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's the problem i've get cos we've only go the one sound card
S0024	yeah
S0144	when you try and mix it's just guess cos you d'you know what i mean you're you're record what you're actually listen to
S0024	yes you
S0144	you haven't get the the distinction between the two output
S0024	well i think he's i think that's what he do
S0144	okay
S0024	so we've get to speak to and try and try and
S0144	alright we can borrow that
S0024	oh we're go to their house on saturday
S0144	yeah
S0024	for the barbeque
S0144	okay we'll try and nick it then
S0024	maybe er if i call him up and say and check with him
S0144	yeah
S0024	or you could call him up check with him see if he's get the equipment there
S0144	yeah
S0024	so that we can have a play
S0144	okay
S0024	and then he can show you how it all work and
S0144	well i know how it work
S0024	i know i know you know how it work but ah you know what i mean
S0144	yeah
S0024	it he's be use it well he's be play with it for a while
S0144	well it's just yeah yeah yeah just as long as you can record it that's the only thing i need
S0024	well phone him up and find out
S0144	it's gonna it's gonna take age cos i'm not the world's greatest mixer i'm gonna have to like record two track and when i've get that right then i'm gonna have to take that file and put it in and then record another track
S0024	on top of it
S0144	on top of that
S0024	like yeah
S0144	and then use that file and keep go like that cos i won't be able to do the whole lot in one performance
S0024	no
S0144	so it's gonna take bloody age
S0024	yeah
S0144	plus we need to find a well i've make a list of songs
S0024	well you never know maybe he he might let us if we have play with it on saturday and if it work maybe he'll lend it to us for a week
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	it would be good well i don't know if it work but it's an idea
S0144	yeah yeah cos i've get i've be divide all the music i have save
S0024	yeah
S0144	into different kind of section now
S0024	so if if you have time this week before saturday to like put the songs in the order kind of that you want that you think you can
S0144	well i haven't get to that stage i'm still put them into different into kind of ambiences
S0024	yeah
S0144	like dinner music or
S0024	yeah
S0144	build create a party atmosphere kind of music or it's difficult because what dj normally do the benefit of have a live dj be
S0024	look at the audience
S0144	they can yeah monitor and gauge how the audience be feel and
S0024	yeah
S0144	put music to suit that but we won't be able to do that
S0024	no
S0144	so we're gonna have to try and create the atmosphere through the music which be gonna be we're gonna have to be very careful
S0024	yeah but then you've get the whole section i mean the band be go to be there for three hours
S0144	yeah
S0024	so they they're gonna do that part so that will be a nice change of
S0144	yeah
S0024	they'll be read the they'll be read the like everybody there and stuff and work out
S0144	well i dunno i think
S0024	what go best
S0144	yeah but before like the first and second set they're gonna be play just stuff from the ipod
S0024	yeah in between
S0144	yeah
S0024	but shouldn't you just let them do it do what they want
S0144	yeah but i mean they might have a load of shit on there i mean if they're just press play on their ipod
S0024	hm
S0144	i don't know if i'd rather have control of that as well
S0024	hm
S0144	and say look between your set could you just stick this cd on cos then it's at least it's stuff that we know we're gonna like
S0024	maybe that's when we could have a salsa section in between the in between
S0144	yeah yeah or after i don't know
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah their music be quite um i dunno a lot of the stuff that i like that they do be quite rocky
S0024	yeah
S0144	well not rocky rocky but you know things like the stroke and white strip and that kinda stuff
S0024	okay
S0144	um so whether you could divide the two set with salsa i dunno or whether that would be better go after cos i'd quite like some funk as well
S0024	yeah i mean i know it's our party and we're not gonna kind of what to like do too much on the day but maybe if if the cd be in a on a salsa you know just a few salsa songs if you separate it then maybe we could like oh now would be a good time to stick the salsa cd on
S0144	yeah
S0024	do you think or do you think we be too busy yap and socialise to do that
S0144	well that's it probably i mean
S0024	couldn't we just go wahay can you put the salsa cd on
S0144	yeah
S0024	maybe we could do that i mean there's gonna be plenty of people there
S0144	yeah
S0024	or
S0144	what just create a whole stack of cds and then
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't know if we would have time cos we will be busy yap
S0024	mm yap or dance
S0144	yeah i don't know if i want
S0144	that kind of thing to think about
S0024	mm this the like the main like one of the biggest problems be stuff we're gonna have to think about on the day
S0144	yeah
S0024	like the food and stuff it's like we've get to delegate some people like say like and like
S0144	which way d'you want to go
S0024	down here we could say um we could even ask properly and like could you do us a favour could you bring help bring out some of the food or something like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	and say to uncle brian could you do us a favour could you i mean i'm sure everybody's gonna be do their bite anyway cos that's what most people be like they just do their own thing but and they help out whenever they're bore or it's nice to have something to do i dunno if you happen to be stand there not talk to somebody you can go ah i'll just go and get the the stuff out the oven something like that like if we say to the people that we know that we know quite well and that know the house quite well and that mum and dad feel comfortable go into the house and say right can you sort this and give them all job to do
S0144	yeah
S0024	but that i mean we can't leave that till the last minute either
S0144	no
S0024	we're gonna have to think about it what about hasn't phone like since her last message i message her say yeah it's fine if you come down and camp the night before i don't mind some of the other girls might be like pop the night before or and they'll be here in the morning
S0144	yeah
S0024	you're welcome to come and i haven't hear back so she's obviously still think about what she's gonna do about that olympics
S0144	yeah yeah that's understandable i mean a lot most people probably won't make a decision until last minute like we do we never know what we're do
S0024	what and suddenly say oh i can't come
S0144	yeah
S0024	no
S0144	yeah well it happen though doesn't it
S0024	yeah yeah just as long as it doesn't happen with lot of people
S0144	yeah oh it's suddenly get hot now
S0024	yeah the sun's come out but look over there it's go to rain over there
S0144	mm
S0024	if it all ah i dunno if it work out it's gonna be brilliant be a really really good party if it doesn't work out it could
S0144	no it'll be fine it'll be good
S0024	yeah i know but i dunno all these people have say they'll come
S0144	ah the main problem be the weather that's what i'm most worry about but you can't do anything about it so
S0024	oh i have er i have to admit something
S0144	what
S0024	i order floor for the marquee
S0144	have you
S0024	and i didn't tell anybody
S0144	what
S0024	because it be like thirty quid or something and i just think well wouldn't that be better wouldn't it be better
S0144	well okay
S0024	you can cancel it if you like
S0144	no well we need a stage as well don't we
S0024	ah yeah
S0144	no the floor will well that will be good if it be rain
S0024	if we've get the floor the stage isn't that important be it cos they can stand just on the floor
S0144	yeah i suppose
S0024	i dunno be that alright
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	i didn't mean to it just kind of like when i be tick the box and i just think
S0144	what the hell be that
S0024	and i and i
S0144	what be it turkeys
S0024	no seriously be that alright cos we if you if you don't want it i'll cancel it
S0144	well how much be it
S0024	i think it be thirty pound i'll check
S0144	well that's okay then
S0024	but i just think i know cos mum mum and dad be go oh no you don't want floor you don't want floor but i just think
S0144	yeah well it would be better for my brother's wheelchair
S0024	maybe yeah exactly
S0144	and if it's rain then it'll just turn into
S0024	there's
S0144	like a glastonbury mud fest
S0024	yeah
S0144	so
S0024	well there's your brother in the wheelchair and there's people who have get stick and stuff
S0144	yeah and you need to do your break dance move
S0024	bu you know like everybody with stick they're gonna i mean it's fairly flat but with the floor they like cos it's get um foam or something
S0144	yeah
S0024	and it kind of mould to the shape of the earth and then you've get a practically a er flat floor
S0144	yeah
S0024	sorry
S0144	that's okay which way be we go
S0024	this way
S0144	be we go for the long one
S0024	well we can always cancel it i think we can cancel it any time
S0144	yeah but the toilets have definitely be order have they
S0024	yeah
S0144	and be they one's where you can wash your hand
S0024	yep they've get a mirror and basin
S0144	okay and what there's two toilets in the female and one in the male
S0024	yeah and one and one urinal in the male i think
S0144	oh okay
S0024	i'll have to check in the letter they send us they didn't really break it down do they
S0144	no no i'm just worry we'll end up with one of those couple of ones you get in a build site
S0024	i hope not hope not
S0144	i hope not as well cos
S0024	cos if everybody's camp
S0144	yeah they need
S0024	they need a sink
S0144	yeah maybe we should double check on that
S0024	i'm sure i email and say do it have a vanity section
S0144	yeah well he know the guy who do the marquee know it's for a wed
S0024	yeah
S0144	but i know it's not the same guy who's do the toilets be it he's just kind of act as a go between
S0024	yeah and i wonder if we can
S0144	so just as long as he relay the message to him
S0024	we might be able to that mirror that's in the bathroom maybe we could borrow that and just take it downstairs and put it next to the toilets as well
S0144	yeah
S0024	so that there's an extra mirror just for people walk past to like just check they haven't get black eye or something make up's run
S0144	yeah just for the ladies
S0024	and the men
S0144	yeah
S0024	right yeah i think i've get to that i've get to check exactly what i've order and i need to make a spreadsheet of um how much we gotta pay on the day
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	cos both the marquee and the band want their payments the rest
S0144	upfront
S0024	the rest of the payments once they arrive
S0144	yeah
S0024	so
S0144	well i'll
S0024	that's gonna be a lot of cash
S0144	i'll have another look at the um the invoice for the band
S0024	mm mm
S0144	cos i haven't look at it since we order
S0024	no
S0144	i don't know if it's get a er deadline on it
S0024	oh
S0024	no i think it say pay on the day
S0144	well i can't remember i only pay a hundred quid or something up front
S0144	so i need to look at that no i'd rather pay in monthly instalments
S0024	yeah
S0144	so it doesn't hit us all in one big whack
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos it's quite a lot of money
S0024	yeah
S0144	if you do it every month you won't notice so much will you
S0024	no but it still need to all be put on the spreadsheet so it'll all have the same number on it it'll still look the same we've spend this much
S0144	yeah but come out your bank account it's not gonna change it drastically overall
S0024	yeah okay
S0144	well cos then you can't
S0024	too many job to do really i've really get to get focus
S0144	i know cos once we start this
S0024	and what if we do go away
S0144	exactly once we star this job it's go to take a back seat isn't it

S0144	yeah thirty nineteen
S0024	yeah i chop load of it yesterday but it's funny how it's purple and then you cook it and it's green like normal broccoli
S0144	hm
S0024	and the water just stay purple
S0024	i don't really understand that it's not like a real colour it's just superficial colour i don't know
S0024	oh you know um have apply for a job in the maldives now
S0144	have she
S0024	yeah
S0024	i be like we be gonna go there once i say but make sure you don't get stick on a resort
S0144	yeah
S0024	cos you won't be able to get off
S0144	well she will do i mean
S0024	and she go it's in a resort that i apply for a job
S0144	oh yeah that's what she's dong clean be she
S0024	um a hotel um i don't know hotel service something like that
S0144	oh wow yeah you would be stick
S0024	i say that's beautiful you can go snorkelling
S0144	well that's beautiful
S0024	she say
S0144	but you be really really stick
S0024	yeah but she doesn't like snorkelling
S0144	well have she be snorkelling
S0024	no but she's be to the red sea and she never go snorkelling
S0144	yeah but i don't think you can say you don't like snorkelling unless you've be snorkelling
S0024	no she doesn't say she didn't like it i think she's a bite scar of it
S0144	yeah that's probably why no as soon as she go especially somewhere like the maldives that's crystal clear
S0024	and you can see all the little fishies
S0144	she'd love it
S0024	stick the snorkel on her head and stick her head under water
S0144	yeah but those islands you've get you've get the main place which be um what be it
S0024	right
S0144	um that's just a horrible town apparently and then you fly out by those like sea plan
S0024	yeah
S0144	and they just fly to all the different islands
S0024	yeah but then that's the thing you're stick
S0144	so you'd be stick on an island which be just a hotel basically
S0024	yeah
S0144	with i dunno i imagine it would get on your nerve after a while cos you're just gonna have a load of honeymoon couple
S0024	yep
S0144	or just extremely rich people
S0024	and how high be the maldives because
S0144	it's about one metre above sea level
S0024	they've get that big wall yeah
S0144	yeah they build this massive wall to protect it from the tsunamis
S0024	yeah but there's um there's another group of um islands
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know where they be er
S0144	there's only
S0024	islands
S0144	i don't know
S0024	they're not by the maldives i think but because they're only like one point two metres above sea level they've have to evacuate them all
S0144	yeah
S0024	cos the sea's just be come in make the islands smaller and smaller
S0144	yeah
S0024	so
S0144	yeah i think the wall only
S0024	that's gonna happen
S0144	protect the the main bite as well
S0024	well that's gonna happen to the maldives though if
S0144	yeah
S0024	i dunno it be a bite scary be on a little island when it's so low
S0144	yeah
S0024	in the sea one metre
S0024	one point two metres
S0144	yeah it be a bite scary isn't it
S0024	be you sure it be
S0144	yeah
S0024	it must be higher than this the other one
S0144	no it's
S0024	where be the islands
S0144	um well it sound the same kind of place
S0024	maybe it's some of the maldives then
S0144	yeah yeah it'd be nice to do but i wouldn't like to stay there for long i don't think
S0024	mm
S0144	because they're i don't know i don't imagine there's much culture unless you're on the main island ad then i mean they're gonna have to import everything
S0024	mm
S0144	so it's gonna be expensive
S0024	the main island would have lot of culture wouldn't it they're like the local people
S0144	i don't know
S0024	it's just the resort islands
S0144	i don't know cos i do look at it and i dunno i think i'd just get claustrophobic
S0024	ah you just can't escape
S0144	mm and you're thousands of miles from anywhere
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's what i wouldn't like don't mind be on an island if i if i know there's a mainland quite near
S0024	and yeah if any thing happen there's a lot of people to evacuate isn't there
S0144	yeah
S0024	so er i dunno how high up the list would you be
S0144	yeah as long as you've get some money you'd be alright
S0024	yes but the holiday makers they'd all be evacuate first compare to the employees yeah they would
S0144	well that's unlikely for that to happen
S0024	yeah
S0144	the main thing will just be feel cut off bore
S0024	yeah
S0144	i know it sound a bite funny be bore in somewhere like that but i think you would after a few months
S0024	oh i nearly walk down there oh but
S0144	how much be it
S0024	ah i don't know
S0144	have she get an interview or have she just apply to it
S0024	she's just apply that's all
S0144	so she want to get out then
S0024	i think so well now that her and phil have split up
S0144	now she's have a taste yeah
S0024	and she's have a taste of be abroad
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah and i think i think she want to i mean it sound really silly but it be it be easier than up and move in england cos of her house association and everything like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	she can't just up and move because they won't go and find her another house in a different area without some sort of reason
S0144	yeah
S0024	so to up and move to another country where they it i mean if her job provide accommodation for her
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's a lot easier
S0144	yeah
S0024	i think
S0144	no it's easier for us as well
S0024	yeah it feel easier
S0144	it's silly
S0024	even though we've still get to do the house hunt and all of that in a different language that we can't speak or read
S0144	yeah
S0024	it still seem i dunno i i think for us it would be quite easy here to find a house and stuff
S0144	well i dunno all the paperwork you've get to give like five years of reference
S0024	mm mm
S0024	crazy isn't it
S0144	yeah i be think about that the other day you know how like all these countries have get a brain drain
S0024	mm
S0144	that's go to start happen here
S0024	mm
S0144	where you know the most intelligent people be just gonna bugger off somewhere else
S0024	i dunno actually they might bugger off to germany or somewhere
S0144	yeah
S0024	but if the the most intelligent people have get a quite a well pay job
S0144	well no i mean intelligence as in kind of um i dunno people who be i dunno innovative
S0024	yeah
S0144	the cut edge of science develop new stuff
S0024	well a lot of the people who be come out of uni or do a master or something can't actually find work because of all the you should do a voluntary year and not get pay before you start and they haven't get any money
S0144	hm
S0024	how tempt be that to go and work abroad
S0144	yeah
S0024	and get the money first and that's your experience and your money so yeah maybe you're right
S0144	yeah but whether they'll need them cos i mean countries like india and china i'm sure they're you know produce enough of their own people
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	to do stuff like that anyway
S0024	but when when they have brain drain and people go over and stud abroad or work abroad then it's more likely that they're gonna get experience now in england and then move back to their home country
S0144	yeah
S0024	rather than stay here
S0144	yeah that's true
S0024	so those countries won't be lose
S0144	yeah
S0024	as many intelligent people cos they'll all come back
S0144	yeah
S0024	which be what they're suppose to do anyway if they're subsidise by the government
S0144	well they're suppose to but
S0024	yeah
S0144	i dunno especially with england it's quite easy to stay isn't it after a while so
S0024	yeah
S0144	although
S0024	well
