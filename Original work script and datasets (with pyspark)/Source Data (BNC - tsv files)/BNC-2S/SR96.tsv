S0167	cos when i be out there work as a language teacher
S0378	mm
S0167	yeah so i be out there work as a language assistant and i get a kind of weekend job as well cos i want a bite of extra money i be be pay quite well to be a language assistant but i just want more money erm and i get a job as a waitress in this hotel restaurant in town and his parent own the restaurant and he be a chef there and so one day one day cos i hadn't think of him in this way until then he be just like my manager
S0378	he be your manager
S0167	he kind of run it with his parent like his parent
S0378	do he own it
S0167	yeah erm and so yeah so anyway one day he take me by surprise and he ask me out and i be like erm oh okay so anyway we go on a couple of date and that be really fun erm now we decide to stay together even after i'd leave germany and erm so yeah we're still together now and we've be together since begin of may last year and he come out to visit me in peru
S0378	mm
S0167	and we climb the machu picchu together
S0378	oh yeah
S0167	to see the picture
S0378	yeah i do yeah so nice
S0167	and that be really cool and he be with me for ten days in peru and erm then i just go to visit him we talk on skype every day and like whatsapp and stuff it's quite easy now with like whatsapp and that
S0378	yeah
S0167	we can just talk for free
S0378	be you like plan to move or live together or to be in the same country
S0167	the problem be he want to stay in this town call which be a really lovely town but kind of in the middle of nowhere and there's not really much go on it's a lovely historical medieval town with cobble streets but it's like you know
S0378	sound pretty logical but it's not
S0167	yeah it's lovely to visit you know lovely for a local but not somewhere i'd want to go and live like i i couldn't go out there there's no opportunities for me unless i want to be a waitress or something to work in erm so the problem be he's just buy the brewery cos they brew their own beer
S0378	wow
S0167	he's just buy the brewery from his dad and he's expand it and he's get his own side business on their hotel and he's buy this build and he's go to extend it by three time the size and put all his big machine in there and brew all the beer and sell it like across the country at the moment they just sell it at the hotel
S0378	yeah
S0167	but he want to market it across the country so he's get his own little business he's set up
S0378	he want you to work in it
S0167	well no he hasn't say that but he's get no like plan to cos ideally i'd like him to come to london and live with me
S0378	so why can't he just own the business and get someone else to do all the graft
S0167	i don't know that hasn't cross his mind i don't know whether he want to be
S0378	and then he can be franchise involve or
S0167	yeah i mean that would be an idea
S0378	have one in london as well
S0167	problem be he still live with like he doesn't live with his parent but he kind of do it's a weird set up like he's live in all his life in that same house all his life his parent own
S0378	and you be like the
S0167	restaurant all his life
S0378	interest like quasi excite woman that walk into his
S0167	do go away for a few years to train in france as a chef and then he come back and work in the restaurant actually his last girlfriend be hungarian she still work in the restaurant
S0378	she still work in the restaurant oh my god
S0167	she's really nice actually
S0378	be that weird
S0167	mm well i kind of dish with her before i even start see so we already kind of know each other anyway and erm they'd only just break up like a month before
S0378	mm
S0167	but erm yeah so she's she's really nice but they their friendship group they're still friends cos they be still in the same friendship group so they still see each other all the time
S0378	how long be it like a long one or be it
S0167	two years
S0378	three years two years
S0167	mm
S0378	that's not too bad
S0167	they meet they meet at a party he say she live in hungary and he live in germany and they do to and fro a few time and she eventually come to visit and come to live with him and get a job in his restaurant and she's be work there ever since so and then he break up with her so she have to find a
S0378	not a life that's not what you want really and you're capable of just a lot more than waitress be there and do there as well and it's not something i would want to go back to that would make it a bite weird
S0167	so yeah i'm not really sure what we're go to do at the moment we just keep visit each other and talk on skype and
S0378	let things happen that's the best thing to do actually let things happen organically
S0167	yeah well we're go on we're go on holiday to paris with his friends
S0378	oh ah i've be think about paris so much lately
S0167	yeah
S0378	yeah to the extent where when i be visit mum we sit in bed one day we be look up all of these different parisian house and
S0167	oh yeah
S0378	french châteaus
S0167	want to live in paris
S0378	yeah i will do one day i think next year
S0167	next year
S0378	oh my god

S0167	start
S0378	and a new start and stuff um yeah my french be so rusty now and i never use it so if i go out there and i immerse myself i'll have more of a chance of learn it and it will be handy for medicine so i've go to the
