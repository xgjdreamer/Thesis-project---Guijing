S0320	oh we need some paper and a pencil i don't think i've get any
S0322	there's a pencil
S0320	really oh that look like a scrabble pencil
S0322	and some paper
S0320	just anything i i don't think i've get any with me just a scrap bite of paper oh look at this
S0322	oh no no there will be under there somewhere
S0320	oh this be a nice secret stash
S0322	yeah it's where you put things when you don't know where to put them
S0320	something in there
S0322	yeah
S0320	my mum and er brother's fianc√©e go shop for material for their wed they're do a festival wed and they get some material with the erm
S0322	camper vans
S0320	camper vans that look really like that
S0322	oh it's really sweet isn't it
S0320	yeah right
S0320	er yeah basically
S0322	so you have seven
S0320	er we have seven and you just put a you can
S0322	the first person's get to go through the star
S0320	and you get a you get double point for the first one
S0322	right right
S0320	erm and then you can see all of these little square so you can get double letter score triple letter score
S0322	yeah
S0320	triple word double word
S0322	yeah
S0320	erm yeah
S0322	and what about if somebody who go oh that's not a word
S0320	er then we have to decide between us i think do you really think either of us be go to have something that's not a word
S0322	no well i'm not go to put anything
S0320	i don't have my scrabble dictionary either so there's gonna be
S0322	okay
S0320	no cheat go on and no tactical blah blah
S0322	one two three four it's not like erm countdown be it cos we we don't get to choose whether you have consonant or vowels
S0320	no
S0320	but there's also no time limit
S0322	one two three four five
S0322	six seven
S0320	thank you
S0322	no that i think that banana thing's like kind of speed scrabble
S0320	oh okay well that sound like fun
S0322	but i don't i think you you can play it on your own i think you just you shake out all these letter and you've get to just use them as quick as you can to make any word you can i think
S0320	how you can play it on your own two four six doesn't sound much fun
S0320	play it on your own right do you wanna go first
S0322	oh wow i haven't play this for a long time
S0320	this be what save my brain after i have
S0320	when i wasn't ever sleep i would play i play scrabble load
S0322	how do you choose who go first though shall we
S0320	dunno you can toss a coin if you want
S0322	paper scissor
S0320	yeah okay what be it rock
S0322	you go three two one and then shoot

S0320	three six nine ten twenty
S0322	mm that's quite good
S0320	i yeah i suspect it's more train travel scrabble

S0320	boys mm yeah
S0322	but yeah she do like to have the students that she like in the class doesn't she

S0320	yeah
S0320	yeah i know
S0320	it's get quite hard
S0322	it's just lack of kind of inspiration i think when you've get high score letter you're like oh i want to use that in a certain place
S0320	it's also but it's
S0322	so you can kind of think of something to do
S0320	yeah but the more letter you put down the harder it be to find a place to put or the more word you've get kind of close up and there's not so many place to put your word
S0322	mm mm
S0320	do think we're complete losers
S0320	mm good good

S0322	i don't know would never believe me about the s er z thing with s in it and they go shouldn't that be z and i say yeah it could be but i'm not american so i'm put it with an s
S0320	don't believe you oh it's all the autocorrect isn't it
S0322	i think it's the way i say it it's like i write it with an s because i don't like z
S0320	possibly that's the reason why they don't believe you rather than this be the accept spell system it's personally oh that would be a good word
S0322	i can write it with an s british yeah yeah i like to write it with a z an s
S0320	mm
S0322	mm
