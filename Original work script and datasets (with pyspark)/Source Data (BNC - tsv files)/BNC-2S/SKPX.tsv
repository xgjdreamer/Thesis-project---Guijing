S0037	yeah
S0115	what's the score
S0037	i don't know eh i think it be i think cardiff be win but i just i be just channel hop and they em it be like they run they have a really good run like he run they all round the goalie like they think he be offside and so all the other team they put their hand up for offside but like he just run past the goalie and like literally run past the post by about two millimetres
S0115	oh so it be it be a pretty spectacular
S0037	i don't even know what the i don't even know what this game be though like be it the league cup or something i don't know even know what the league cup be
S0115	league cup semi final cardiff versus crystal palace
S0037	i didn't even but what like they've change it so many time like what be it call the coca cola cup be it the fa cup or something different
S0115	eh that be the league cup i think the coca cola be the league one then f a f a
S0037	so what be the difference
S0115	be always f a wasn't it
S0037	be it
S0115	well
S0037	be it not the something fa cup like they sort of
S0115	well maybe but you don't sort of need to say that do you
S0037	i don't know
S0115	for those that green or something
S0037	yeah like pot pies
S0115	eh what's a wind screen yeah the i mean but em
S0037	anyway
S0115	but also wind screen one or whatever it be i think that be like the
S0037	there's the the carling cup as well what be that
S0115	wasn't there a leyland daf cup or something
S0037	don't be silly there wasn't a leyland daf cup be there
S0115	i don't know
S0037	i'd like it if there be what would be the most inappropriate thing for there to be like an fa cup name after like fag or something
S0115	well they
S0037	and
S0115	they do that in you know in snooker don't have the embassy snooker
S0037	oh be that where that come from
S0115	eh
S0037	that just show my ignorance
S0115	eh and of course eh
S0037	oh there look the carling cup
S0115	and of course eh formula one be be famous for eh
S0037	there look middlesbrough's first and all the success
S0115	when when be that a hundred and twenty eight years ago
S0037	probably middlesbrough football wasn't even invent a hundred and twenty eight years ago
S0115	eh yeah just about
S0037	that steve mcclaren that's a
S0115	just about yeah i think they be actually oh oh yeah no eh this be eh birmingham win the eh birmingham win the the league cup eh against arsenal i think i watch that one actually last year
S0037	oh yeah you do yeah i remember watch that and you be like yes
S0115	top of the shock this but this be that be a section of the top of the that be number one on top of the shock birmingham
S0037	so
S0115	beat eh
S0037	arsenal yeah
S0115	arsenal in the in the league cup
S0037	but like
S0115	which rank after the fa cup but i think the there be an there be an even another cup that be that be a bite lower
S0037	more rubbish
S0115	but i think that be the one that i think birmingham win a while ago
S0037	i don't know
S0115	where you
S0037	i've not see i'm not up to date
S0115	where you you only enter it if you're like the em one of the lower like if you're in then the third division or below
S0037	i think i be put off of football like for life after that whole like work at the stadium of light thing
S0115	oh eh
S0037	i have the pies the pie aspect
S0115	yeah but that be
S0037	it be a bite of
S0115	enterprising you know i mean it be industrious like you be
S0037	i don't know if it be enterprising
S0115	you be work that age when do you start that
S0037	em well you be suppose to be sixteen but i wasn't sixteen i just say i be and like they weren't bother and they didn't check although i'm sure they have my national insurance number so they should probably of well who know it be all a bite dodgy they use to put the pies like
S0115	yeah best yeah best leave unsolved
S0037	like the pies
S0115	yeah
S0037	like if they didn't sell them they use to just put them in a box and then put them in a cupboard and then the next week just like crack the pies back out and the put them in the warmer
S0115	that's scandalous
S0037	and be like
S0115	yeah
S0037	because if somebody get like a em like a bad belly from eat a dodgy pie you would never know because like i suppose a lot of the blokes and that who go to football and eat those horrible pies like would have have twenty pints of beer anyway so they would never think do you know what
S0115	yeah
S0037	that be a bad pie like people would laugh wouldn't they if they say that
S0115	yeah i think there wasn't probably much in the pies apart from
S0037	no
S0115	sort of potatoes butter or
S0037	like sawdust and like
S0115	yeah i mean
S0037	and hooves in that
S0115	i never i never have a i i never go to a football match i've never have a football pie so em
S0037	oh we need to rectify that
S0115	what be they like
S0037	well there's the the they branch out
S0115	be it just like the ones you get in the chippie
S0037	em yeah more or less but they branch out like obviously this be like more than ten years ago but i remember like they introduce a new like a chicken tikka pie and eh
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	everyone be like chicken tikka pie why do i want one of them like cos people use to just be like give us a pie love and then you'd be like oh what flavour do you want and they'd be like meat so
S0115	yeah
S0037	it didn't those didn't really sell very well
S0115	well in the chippie you know it use to be steak and kidney or eh
S0037	yeah
S0115	eh chicken and mushroom and then in greggs obviously you get the
S0037	ah kidneys

S0037	yeah
S0115	the formula one be on
S0037	oh yeah formula one load
S0115	be heavily eh i think it's it's ban now isn't it but it use to be really heavily eh
S0037	do you think they'll ban like
S0115	heavily sponsor by eh
S0037	do you think they'll ever ban like mcdonald's sponsor things
S0115	em
S0037	you know because they've they've ban cigarettes or like you know alcohol
S0115	no because mcdonald's be sneaky you know the eh there's a there's a quote for you eh no but they eh well they don't just sell unhealthy food do they some of it some of the things they sell be actually like salads and that like mc salad or something
S0037	i suppose
S0115	although i haven't be to mcdonald's for a very long time so
S0037	i haven't i can't even remember actually i do remember it be the time do you remember when my brother have be round and we be really hang over and be like oh stop at mcdonald's and then the car get beach on like one of those like weird concrete things
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	and i couldn't get it off
S0115	oh that that be just a really bad moment wasn't it em
S0037	it be funny yeah
S0115	so just kick off the second half eh cardiff one
S0037	oh it be
S0115	crystal palace nil yeah oh
S0037	oh you're not go to commentate the whole match be you
S0115	ah no i'm not actually gonna i'm not actually gonna commentate the whole match
S0037	i don't think i'd like to be a sport commentator
S0115	well well i i don't know any of the players so eh currently
S0037	you could just make up name for them
S0115	em i could just say the team where cardiff have it's a list of
S0037	yeah but it's
S0115	yeah so it's either cardiff cardiff cardiff cardiff
S0037	i i like the which which kit do you prefer
S0115	oh cardiff but eh no it's cos honestly
S0037	which kit which kit do you prefer like i like that custardy sort of colour
S0115	that's a sorry
S0037	i like that sort of yellowy bananay canary colour
S0115	yeah well i think that some of the kit that they have em could be more could be more extravagant i suppose em
S0037	yeah
S0115	but they must think that it's eh that's it's off put or something to have
S0037	yeah like highler highlighter pen colour
S0115	really bright sort of or it's not you know it's not masculine enough to have em
S0037	i'm
S0115	pink kit so i don't i don't know any
S0037	i'm sure that someone's
S0115	team that have a pink kit
S0037	i'm sure someone's get like a purpley pink do arsenal not have like a sort of how would you call it like a magenta sort of colour one for a while
S0115	em i don't know
S0037	maybe it wasn't them
S0115	i think northampton town have purple
S0037	oh do they
S0115	but eh
S0037	oh that would be good
S0115	eh
S0037	also i think like
S0115	there should be more i suppose but
S0037	there's a lot of strip on the goal i i i'm fancy a few polka dot
S0115	yeah i don't know they don't really have spotty ones do they
S0037	you know like jockey have
S0115	but i think that would be like sort of distract with the with the ball wouldn't it
S0037	or like some chevrons
S0115	eh yeah that that's probably a bite distract as well isn't it
S0037	or like em
S0115	animal pattern or flame flame pattern like eh
S0037	animal pattern that would be good wouldn't it
S0037	like a leopard print
S0115	yeah i suppose you could but
S0037	like a zebra
S0115	oh yeah cos if they have name like the you know like the tigers or something then they could actually look like tigers then that would be
S0037	oh yeah that's a good idea
S0115	yeah so kind of like
S0037	like rugby league do that though don't they
S0115	like the cowboys and and the indians or something i wonder actually look like that that would be a
S0037	yeah well i saw like
S0115	like the the the vipers or something
S0037	well i saw like you know you know i've be knit stuff and that at the minute
S0115	yeah
S0037	for a the baby well i saw this pattern like i like sort of unusual pattern and i saw this one and it be like for a tuxedo but it wasn't it be just a knit jumper
S0115	yeah
S0037	but it look like a baby tuxedo like a dicky bow tie and like a white shirt with like button and like a cumberband and then like a jacket
S0115	blimey
S0037	but it be a jumper so i could do that could have be like dinner you know dinner suit
S0115	em you know people dress sort of baby in that sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	thing nowadays don't they
S0037	eh i'm not sure if they dress them in knit dinner jacket but eh
S0115	well
S0037	that's go to be a bite of a niche audience
S0115	eh
S0037	but they dress them as like big pumpkins and stuff don't they on halloween
S0115	i can see how eh you know you might want to you could make anything out of knit i suppose and
S0037	yeah
S0115	you for clothe like you could imitate things like couldn't you sort of imitate like like a football kit i suppose you could knit a football a football shirt
S0037	yeah you could that would be nice and warm
S0115	eh or
S0037	could do a military one
S0115	i don't know if i've see that i don't know if there be a market for knit eh sportswear but eh
S0037	maybe maybe there be
S0115	knit em
S0037	cos it they're all a horrible sort of nylon aren't they be it nylon
S0115	for for baby that have grow up support everton or something and they would have like the everton woolly jumper or something
S0037	well i can definitely knit a red and white stripy one that would be quite nice wouldn't it
S0115	for for eh southampton or
S0037	not southampton you know what for
S0115	i mean yeah the colour could be could be more extravagant
S0037	like you know like jockey have
S0115	eh
S0037	like where they have like
S0115	well they have yeah they have more crazy
S0037	like hoop and
S0115	eh colour it's like yeah
S0037	and like you know like even rugby do like even rugby have the the kind of
S0115	all harlequin and
S0037	the harlequin thing
S0115	i like i like there one it's get sort of
S0037	and like the em hoop and stuff don't they
S0115	yeah
S0037	although qpr have blue and white hoop doesn't it
S0115	yeah and celtic
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	em
S0037	that's probably about the
S0115	there be too much
S0037	limit of my footballing knowledge
S0115	too much just red white red white so
S0037	nothing wrong with red and white i think that's about the the limit of my football knowledge though i just i like watch it but i think that's because i like watch anything like i could happily get consume by the dart or the snooker
S0115	yeah well sport be good to watch eh especially in the pub em where
S0037	yeah
S0115	but also if you get into it you can get quite you know you become engross in it
S0037	i think so
S0115	and and sort of
S0037	like when that time when we get really into the curl
S0115	huh that be it be watchable you see you can it's it's addictive and if you watch eh you know the olympics or whatever then you sort of miss it when it finish or something or
S0037	yeah
S0115	when the
S0037	be you look forward to the olympics
S0115	em yeah i mean i don't normally watch load of of olympics but em because it be in london this time i suppose eh i suppose i should get more involve into it so
S0037	yeah
S0115	i suppose you can't just turn up and then just go in and watch it
S0037	well i think you can for like the one the marathon you can
S0115	yeah you can't to go to the swim or something
S0037	all the outdoor ones like the road race but no i try to get ticket but
S0115	no
S0037	i even apply for like the most rubbish things like the tiddlywinks or like the you know
S0115	eh they don't do tiddlywinks do they
S0037	no that's the joke
S0115	but em
S0037	no i didn't get any ticket but em
S0115	but they do do some strange things like like archery
S0037	beach volleyball in london
S0115	yeah
S0037	it's go to be an interest one
S0115	yeah em i i don't know what my favourite eh olympic thing to watch be
S0037	i quite like the swim ones last time cos we win a lot of stuff
S0115	cycle eh we win a lot of cycle
S0037	oh yeah the commentator be good wasn't he em so i've get a bite bore of the ones that everyone like like the hundred metre final and that
S0115	well it's very quick very quick
S0037	it's a bite sort of murgh sort of everyone like it but i don't know
S0115	do they
S0037	well that's like the most expensive ticket be for that the men's one hundred metre final
S0115	how much would it cost just to watch the men's hundred metre final
S0037	i don't know i think it depend on where you're sit i think all of the ones have like cheap seat
S0115	yeah
S0037	for some of them em but for a lot of them like
S0115	ooh there's chris martin
S0037	who's chris martin
S0115	he play for crystal palace
S0037	do do you know him before or have you just read him off the screen
S0115	no it's cos he he
S0037	oh chris martin chris martin
S0115	he's he's em
S0037	oh he's have a break
S0115	he eh he use to be use to be a singer didn't he
S0037	but yeah he have a better offer so now he play football for crystal palace
S0115	yeah em well i think he just want a change of scene
S0037	well a change of pace so like gwyneth's in the
S0115	yeah
S0037	stand with like apple and moses or whatever his kid be call
S0115	apple and moses
S0037	yeah
S0115	oh be he go through the bible then the next thing he's go to be like
S0037	oh you mean apple
S0115	den or something
S0037	den
S0115	yeah from em daniel and the lions' den
S0037	oh right
S0115	apple from adam and eve that apple
S0037	yeah moses from moses
S0115	moses from the moses
S0037	the story of moses
S0115	moses' adventure and em
S0037	the adventure of moses part one
S0115	no i don't know that be be that be that what's his he start with adam and eve the apple and he start
S0037	well he didn't have
S0115	he be plan to go all the way to i don't know
S0037	i don't know if apple be a very be a very standard choice
S0115	i think apple be i can see why
S0037	maybe he could have go for
S0115	i can see it's i can see it's better than some other fruit that you might wanna use but
S0037	like what like pawpaw
S0115	well it's better than many fruit i think
S0037	mango martin's get a nice ring to it
S0115	eh banana mango yeah i think it's like
S0037	mango martin
S0115	it's it's man and go isn't it so it's you know
S0037	yeah mango yeah
S0115	it mean it mean something yeah
S0037	mushroom mushroom martin that's quite nice
S0115	eh yeah his name would be would be magic wouldn't it
S0037	oh yeah like it
S0115	em
S0037	but so i think instead of like moses he should have just go for basket like moses basket you know apple and basket
S0115	em
S0037	what do you think
S0115	eh there's a lot of things around moses aren't there so you've get the ten commandments haven't you and eh
S0037	i don't know if commandment would be a nice name for a person
S0115	eh the plague em
S0037	buboes that's the wrong sort of plague
S0115	em i don't know if that would work
S0037	that's it the black death
S0115	the the the locusts
S0037	locust locust mm lovely
S0115	em and eh
