S0628	me too
S0624	to go and do but like fuck you like i don't wanna go to this
S0628	i
S0624	faraway place
S0628	i've have that this week i mean i don't want to
S0624	yeah
S0628	so i'm really tire i just wanna
S0624	yeah
S0628	get into bed
S0624	yeah
S0628	already weary er yeah so i have that article to do and then it be sort of er it just need quite a lot of work on it and i sort of get everything in the right place but i hadn't the write be really difficult like
S0624	yeah
S0628	so i do that and then
S0624	what be the article
S0628	er it's about the government domestic counter terrorism policy
S0624	okay
S0628	but so it's really interest it's just a bite it's quite it's quite well tread grind in a way i'm sort of look at like the situation now and how it's evolve since the policy be first introduce but er mainly like policy stuff into the thing
S0624	so be that the prevent
S0628	prevent yeah
S0624	yeah
S0628	and make of policies so harder then also like it's for an audience which be pretty the default position be like quite anti religion so just be like
S0624	yeah
S0628	this target muslims be not enough
S0624	yeah
S0628	for that be you have to make the case more for and i think it's probably more interest anyway to make
S0624	yeah
S0628	make the case around like universal value and stuff
S0624	yeah
S0628	about why it's bad
S0624	about around universal value
S0628	so like freedom of speech
S0624	er yeah
S0628	erm i mean like it have a effect for everyone
S0624	yeah
S0628	but also and like governments the sort of ethics of a government like get into
S0624	yeah
S0628	ideological
S0624	yeah
S0628	which be what they're do quite specific
S0624	as as oppose make sort of a culture argument about
S0628	well i
S0624	protect er
S0628	yeah
S0624	yeah
S0628	protect
S0624	yeah
S0628	or the er
S0624	that be interest it's interest
S0628	yeah
S0624	to have to like look on it from a different
S0628	yeah it be interest
S0624	different tack
S0628	i mean too much but it just sort of be in my head a bite
S0624	yeah
S0628	and also because it's be write about on like quite a lot so
S0624	yeah
S0628	i think it be a bite more interest sort of like should a government be fight ideas which be what they've say they want to
S0624	yeah
S0628	like what be that what be the implications of that
S0624	yeah
S0628	and be can be they any good at do it which they're not and erm
S0624	yeah
S0628	so that what
S0624	that's so interest
S0628	like yeah it be just it be really challenge to do and
S0624	yeah that's so that's like such a like that's such a like important question
S0628	yeah
S0624	like i think like because it's like it's so like that thing be like so historically specific
S0628	yeah
S0624	what the kind of like of like not be able to like think
S0628	yeah
S0624	and stuff like it's so and like you know like er like it's sort of like i guess and like
S0628	yeah exactly
S0624	in like
S0628	it's very similar
S0624	and it's just the same sort of like
S0628	it's exactly the same sort of thing and we've now get like a definition of extremism on
S0624	yeah
S0628	so it's not just that it's bad to be a terrorist or
S0624	yeah
S0628	it's just be an extremist be prohibit which be kind of edge towards
S0624	yeah
S0628	criminalise people for opinions
S0624	do you see that thing when they come out and they be talk about like the what they've advise school to keep track on
S0628	yeah kid
S0624	like possible yeah
S0628	yeah that's what i be
S0624	okay
S0628	i do i spend a lot i talk to lot of teachers
S0624	yeah
S0628	and stuff yeah
S0624	okay
S0628	yeah they've get to erm
S0624	really
S0628	like all public
S0624	it's so fuck up
S0628	all public yeah all public officials have to be like aware of sign of radicalisation
S0624	yeah
S0628	and obviously most of them be really bad at it cos they just
S0624	yeah
S0628	need to just erm
S0624	i mean i guess there be something quite like there be something quite specific cos it's like there be she be like like the i can't remember who it be erm but she's say that like it's er not just about sort of radicalisation for religion but like just any kind of extremism but i be like
S0628	yeah
S0624	what other extremism
S0628	yeah they say that
S0624	that happen it what be it
S0628	far right far right extremism
S0624	yeah
S0628	or animal right extremism
S0624	yeah
S0628	that's why but it's
S0624	but that that's just like it's so like
S0624	animal right extremism what the fuck like there's like there be no there be no kid in school who be like that like just like cos that
S0628	yeah
S0624	that's kind of like a like know
S0628	outdated
S0628	yeah
S0624	yeah
S0628	it's outdated
S0624	yeah and like the i guess far right but like but like that's just a kind of like balance out
S0628	yeah
S0624	so much better than any but like i
S0628	it's interest actually cos in other countries in europe they've you oh shit i didn't put that in my article so much research i just couldn't put everything in
S0624	yeah
S0628	just remind me but in other countries within
S0628	yeah in other countries
S0624	be those like the footnote
S0628	yeah
S0624	various footnote
S0628	in other countries in europe they have get really similar model but in they have more of a far right problem so it actually the public perception be better cos they're not see as
S0624	yeah
S0628	target people for the colour of their skin they're see as
S0624	yeah
S0628	like as genuinely sort of against
S0624	yeah
S0628	different type of extremism so it's still kind of regressive in a way cos it's like you can't have these view and it doesn't matter
S0624	yeah
S0628	if you're violent or not but it be see as be a bite more equal
S0624	yeah
S0628	like say in germany where there be quite a big far right movement
S0624	yeah
S0628	or which be quite interest whereas here
S0624	that be interest
S0628	it's not we don't have quite the same scale of far right movement
S0624	yeah
S0628	but also it's not it's just not on the political agenda
S0624	yeah that's interest
S0628	so it's kind of see so here it really be like a you know
S0624	yeah
S0628	mm yeah it be super interest but i just have lot of other like bitty bits of work i have a thing to do with
S0624	yeah
S0628	but i just forget they be such a nightmare to work for i just haven't do anything for them for like a year and a half but it's a new woman
S0624	yeah weren't they the ones who like be really vague and like
S0628	yeah
S0624	what be what be the thing
S0628	i can't remember exactly what it be
S0624	there be like something
S0628	but i i just like didn't do anything for them after that cos the guy be a complete idiot like
S0624	yeah
S0628	really vague and then i didn't run the piece and it's like
S0624	yeah
S0628	oh it's too late now
S0624	yeah and they be like
S0628	and the all of that
S0624	ask for they be really like ask you for photograph
S0628	yeah
S0624	photograph
S0628	yeah
S0624	like
S0624	ah thank so much
S0628	er can we have a bite
S0624	thank do you have any erm er like chilli sauce and soya sauce
S0628	yeah and and chilli
S0624	and chilli
S0624	thank you
S0628	er yeah they be a nightmare so this woman that get in touch with me a couple of months ago say do you wanna do some work for us and she's just cos she's work for the guardian and stuff
S0624	yeah
S0628	so i be but she be kind of but like the it be it be about english as a second language course esol erm cos and it be and it be cos cameron have make this announcement on monday and she be like it would be really good if you could go to a class and write about that and i be could you do it by the end of the day
S0624	yeah
S0628	tomorrow i be like it's very unlikely
S0624	yeah
S0628	be able to do that but then i do manage to which be great but it be very stressful cos it be such time pressure so i get the commission at like three or four on tuesday i manage to get into a class at like nine thirty the next morning and like oh which be great it be like there just happen to be these teachers who be just really really nice
S0624	mm
S0628	but erm there be just a few things that
S0624	that's it it's like a nice
S0628	yeah it be really interest as well
S0624	like a nice job to do
S0628	oh yeah it be great
S0624	but like
S0628	yeah it be great just that's what be a bite annoy about it be that the piece be really interest and like the it be really fun work on it but then all the stuff be just too stressful
S0624	yeah
S0628	cos like the woman who i interview have just say basically you should never give someone like say give them copy approval so like that they read
S0624	yeah
S0628	what you write and they can just it's bad and they're bias and
S0624	yeah
S0628	people always wanna change random stuff she'd say very she basically like she she'd sort of bend the rule to get me into the class she should have go through her market department and get permission but it would have take a few days then
S0624	through her market department
S0628	er the college have
S0624	oh right right right
S0628	a market department so like it would have take erm
S0624	crazy be it like an academy
S0628	no it's a further education college
S0624	oh okay oh sorry yeah
S0628	erm so it would have take so that she be able to but if they be under eighteen i wouldn't have be able to but it be adult education so erm she do it anyway without go through the proper channel at the school so it's fine like they know i be there but er she be really nice and she be like yeah we're all under thank you we're all under the threat of redundancy so can you cos so they've be really strict with that because before she go on strike where would you mind if you just chat if i can just see the quote that i've give and can i also just check for any safeguard issue with my students cos some of them have uncertain immigration status and i be like yeah fine like i you know i'm not i can't give like approval of the whole article but that's fine on those specific issue which i think i
S0624	yeah
S0628	i personally think fine like maybe it's not good practice to do that but if it's a case of someone like lose their job
S0624	yeah
S0628	not up for that erm anyway then i tell the woman at which i shouldn't have mention it to her i just tell her in the interest of be straightforward about it and she completely freak out and be like it be as sort of like no you really should have speak to me beforehand that erm you can't that i would never have give i would never have say that be okay it's never okay to give copy approval blah blah blah blah blah erm and
S0624	be they like they're like what be they
S0628	it's like fuck off
S0624	yeah it's so annoy i dunno who but they be like that they now so that suddenly they be like
S0628	yeah
S0624	have this moment where everyone be like
S0628	it's like if you know anything about journalist
S0624	the new media
S0628	yeah she be like er she make it sound as if i'd do some like horrible faux pas it wasn't like well do for achieve the ridiculously impossible task i set you just she be like i think it's a very weird implication that because she's do you a like she's do you a favour so deserve some special treatment er that either she know she be invite a journalist in or she didn't and i reply and explain and be like i didn't say
S0624	yeah
S0628	i wouldn't do that i say
S0624	yeah
S0628	very you know she be very reasonable she very specifically want to check about people's immigration statuses
S0624	yeah
S0628	about her sort of employment employment issue and like if if you're not happy with that and she be very reasonable i'll just go back and say that that's not okay and then she be like oh fine whatever but like make it clear you can't change anything and then so it's
S0624	that's er it's like really jump up
S0624	like it's like
S0628	yeah it be so
S0624	someone's bend erm the rule
S0624	and just be like
S0628	just like i've also probably be a journalist for longer than she have
S0624	yeah
S0628	so i know i'm i mean i think we're about the same age
S0624	yeah
S0628	but
S0624	yeah
S0628	also like she's not a reporter she's her background's in so i work on stuff on immigration issue all the time
S0624	yeah
S0628	and i always let people
S0624	do you yeah
S0628	like lawyers and teachers just check and you make it clear you say i'm not gonna make any
S0624	yeah
S0628	or change to make you sound better
S0624	but surely that should be in the code of ethics though like
S0628	yeah
S0624	that's also like that's like the only ethical
S0628	thank you thank can i get a fork please er
S0624	that be good
S0628	yeah it be good yeah i dunno it just be yeah she just yeah like jump up the like
S0624	yeah
S0628	it be really annoy though so unnecessary
S0624	that be really annoy
S0628	yeah cos just that i'd obviously i haven't be like oh yeah sure like why will you just check the article for me and tell me
S0624	yeah
S0628	if there's anything you don't like and i'll change it you know i do on stuff like that like i see why it's not good to let people approve it cos they always wanna change random stuff but but
S0624	mm so be that a general rule you never send it to
S0628	yeah you're not suppose to
S0624	that's crazy
S0628	you're really not suppose to at all cos people often just wanna stuff to make themselves sound better about
S0624	mm
S0628	i do though when it's erm i let i i always do if it's about like
S0624	and the stuff you're cover
S0628	yeah
S0624	and it's so important
S0628	if it's about a legal issue or immigration status
S0624	yeah
S0628	or a safety
S0624	a safety thing as well like i guess the thing be like surely that's the premise
S0628	yeah
S0624	where they have a lot of people be involve in it in the first place
S0628	yeah
S0624	like if you're talk about something which like you know like threaten like your life or
S0628	yeah
S0624	your family's live like
S0628	yeah
S0624	of course you wanna be able to
S0628	yeah definitely yeah if it's like safety or employment or like
S0624	yeah
S0628	legality then erm that you would but then you can just be very specific
S0624	yeah
S0628	and you can just be very clear
S0624	and you can say no if they kick off
S0628	yeah
S0624	like they're not change it themselves like
S0628	no
S0628	no i think most people be quite reasonable if you say i mean people will often be like oh can you just change this word of this to make themselves sound better but
S0624	and you're like mm nah sorry
S0628	you can just ignore that
S0624	you just ignore it
S0628	but it's just like often people will wanna change something to make it like longer and i dunno like sort of more intelligent word or whatever
S0624	yeah
S0628	but not how they originally say it
S0624	oh quotations
S0628	yeah erm
S0624	i see yeah that must be like
S0628	it's a bite so that's why it's not good to do it but i i mean i wouldn't do it in the normal circumstances but it be really annoy be like give load of shit for it when i be like i don't they didn't agree to anything unreasonable i don't think
S0624	yeah
S0628	but
S0624	that's really annoy
S0628	yeah it be
S0624	she sound annoy
S0628	also forty five minutes of really stuff go back and forth when i have like not very long to write the thing and then like i arrange for the the photographer to go into the college so i speak to the woman like sort that out for the next day and er the photographer just didn't turn up erm he be such a dick she have say she be see the same class who i have meet and interview the next morning she be like well i i just wanna ask the class if they're alright with the photographer
S0624	yeah
S0628	but at half nine when i go in it's like maybe if i just check to see then someone can come we're there till twelve it's like yeah it's all fine i explain that to the guy he be like great i live five minutes away from the college just let me know when and he didn't give me his mobile number and i email like as soon as i hear from her erm the different time
S0624	oh no
S0628	like if you know that be happen
S0624	yeah
S0628	surely you would check your email at like ten but she just didn't check an email i hear from the woman at like yeah like eleven and she be like oh the photographer hasn't arrive like i haven't hear from him so and i call the editor she get in touch with him and so he go just go to the wrong site i'd give him the full address so the wrong site
S0624	you're like you guy be incompetent
S0628	but like so
S0624	that sound that sound so that it's like
S0624	over
S0628	so it's just
S0624	compensation
S0628	which be ridiculous
S0624	it be like they're like can't like yeah
S0628	and then he go he do manage to go later in the day but he like have to go to like a different class like not the people i interview which be fine
S0624	mm
S0628	but just er yeah really incompetent and i have that experience every time i've do anything with them but i mean
S0624	i think it's so interest where look at like i like yeah it's probably like whoever like the editor be just be like okay we've be give this like new news thing

S0624	just like it's really by the book like this be how
S0628	yeah
S0624	to be like a proper journalist blah blah blah

S0628	be it sound really nice
S0624	it's very proper i realise though like
S0628	i'll go round for a visit
S0624	i just like i don't earn anywhere near enough money to own a proper house yet it's things like my next move i have to go back a bite cos like the only way you can stay in those kind of house which be very nicely finish and da da da but you have to have nice shit to go in them otherwise it look weird and like that's what i've be feel that at 's as well like
S0628	yeah
S0624	all my contributions like slowly work their way back into my bedroom
S0624	it's like
S0628	really
S0624	so these cushion be lovely what's wrong with these snazzy bangly cushion
S0624	they're slightly erm
S0628	bubble
S0628	that's funny
S0624	yeah it's funny but you have to have like
S0628	i guess you can build up
S0624	yeah
S0628	get nice stuff slowly though
S0624	yeah
S0628	that's what people do isn't it
S0624	yeah i guess like you kind of like slow build yeah i think it's like something about like new house which be like very unforgiving
S0628	yeah
S0624	i think it also make me like quite neurotic like i clean much more at 's than i've ever clean before
S0628	really
S0624	like and you like cos when it like i think if look a bite scruffy and there's shit everywhere
S0628	yeah
S0624	you like lose
S0628	the fact that that
S0624	yeah
S0628	yeah
S0624	yeah
S0628	i mean that type of things happen when you move in somewhere as well doesn't it even if it's not yours
S0624	yeah
S0628	like you just
S0624	yeah
S0628	yeah we just get a cleaner
S0624	mm
S0628	it's like the best thing ever
S0624	amaze
S0628	yeah
S0624	so relax
S0628	totally decadent but it's really great
S0624	yeah
S0628	come for her first time today and i be like everything's so clean it be so nice and i be really anti it and i think he just get bore with me be annoy with him cos like cos he just doesn't do any clean
S0624	yeah
S0628	then eventually be like okay let's just not argue about it
S0628	like what a stupid thing to argue about
S0624	yeah
S0624	yes cos in principle i'm quite like anti
S0628	so be i actually
S0624	cleaners i think like i i don't
S0628	the
S0624	like i don't like what
S0628	well
S0624	i don't like be that i don't like the idea of like a society
S0628	yeah
S0624	whereby some people like they would say it's almost like
S0628	yeah
S0624	capitalists
S0628	yeah i agree
S0624	sort of servant culture
S0628	yeah
S0624	and and that's why i find that's what i don't like about it but in an individual case by case basis
S0628	but but i actually don't even think
S0624	people need job and like
S0628	yeah but i totally agree like the argument like oh you're help the london economy it's well actually it would be better for like sort the structural system if
S0624	yeah
S0628	specifically you didn't do
S0624	yeah
S0628	do that but yeah
S0624	mm
S0628	i definitely agree and i actually don't really think it's necessary if you live in like a share house and everyone clean
S0624	yeah
S0628	i don't think it's necessary at all
S0624	i don't think like people's
S0628	but in our current situation like doesn't clean
S0624	yeah
S0628	who's live with us like really doesn't clean
S0624	yeah
S0628	and so so
S0624	no you've just gotta like further stress of it
S0628	yeah and so i'm also
S0624	like
S0628	quite stress and busy
S0624	yeah
S0628	i don't wanna spend my spare even
S0624	yeah
S0628	clean and then
S0624	yeah
S0628	get angry with my boyfriend about it
S0624	yeah
S0624	no it's miles better to i mean that's so true
S0628	and i also
S0624	erm
S0628	yeah and on principle er
S0624	i think it's just like people
S0624	live too but like it's that they end up like some people's live be too busy to clear up after like
S0628	yeah i
S0624	and that's what it be and like and that's and like
S0628	oh i don't think it yeah
S0624	and like but the world like that the world should not be like that
S0628	i don't think you're genuinely too busy to clean up after yourself though it's a choice isn't it
S0624	mm
S0628	so
S0624	yeah
S0628	but i don't think people should be under any illusions about that
S0624	mm no that's true
S0628	there's definitely a choice if i be like what i don't ever do be just like take the limescale off the shower or
S0624	yeah
S0628	like clean the kitchen sink and stuff like that
S0624	yeah yeah
S0628	yeah and that's
S0624	yeah
S0628	what's so nice there so the room be so clean like the room yeah but just like scrub the actual thing
S0624	yeah
S0628	it's really nice but yeah i think
S0624	i think yeah it be i think it's like if you like cos i guess the other argument be that if you know you see it in term of like a hierarchy of job
S0628	yeah
S0624	and there's just somebody pay for stuff and like in spain i think i have a big argument with about this actually cos in spain like a culture of like clean
S0628	yeah
S0624	like be a hotelier or like work in like
S0628	yeah
S0624	like what we it's like service industries it's much more like
S0628	or higher status
S0624	yeah so and so it's like it's not like that's just what you do when you're eighteen like you go
S0628	yeah
S0624	like and like and i guess cos their economy be so fuck but there's no like there's no kind of oh or the associations i guess that be attach to it over here
S0628	yeah that's interest
S0624	but i think but i just like i strongly believe that some job be better than other job
S0628	yeah
S0624	and like
S0628	but i think also like some
S0624	yeah
S0628	i dunno i don't think there's anything wrong with people take pride in the work they do or like
S0624	mm
S0628	but i also i i struggle with this that i think about it for a lot because of be in pakistan
S0624	yeah
S0628	where people have like
S0624	i've think about
S0628	load of servants
S0624	yeah i think about this when you say about your
S0628	yeah
S0624	like in your
S0628	yeah cos it's ridiculous
S0624	yeah
S0628	but then at the same time they're really good i mean
S0624	employment
S0628	but like the structure be fuck like the the fact that it's such a service economy be i think that's really bad but then at the same time those be really good desirable job for people to have
S0624	yeah
S0628	so like but i don't think it's good cos they don't have any downtime they you know they're there they're away from their families they're work yeah i mean it's really good all their food and board be pay for they get clothe they can send all their money back to their families they get their like week off every month or whatever and go back home erm
S0624	be that what be be like a
S0628	well they get like a day normally no it's not a whole week they get like a day off a week normally but most of them will save it up and go for a
S0624	mm
S0628	long trip to spend with their
S0624	yeah
S0628	wife and kid or be in the village or whatever mm like
S0624	and it be strange isn't it it's like
S0628	they're really desirable job and stuff
S0624	yeah
S0628	and for me it's odd cos i'm like well what they have a really different conception of what life be
S0624	yeah
S0628	and of what and like so
S0624	and like where you get your mean from i guess
S0628	yeah
S0624	yeah
S0628	erm but
S0624	mm
S0628	but erm there's also to not have servants if you have the money to would be a bad thing
S0624	yeah
S0628	because you could be provide job you're not provide
S0624	it's see as like
S0628	yeah from the sake of your own
S0624	mm
S0628	morality like you're not
S0624	it's really interest
S0628	yeah it's really interest
S0624	it's like that kind of like
S0628	yeah well yeah
S0624	until and until they're all like it's kind of like
S0628	oh it's really be i mean it's it's pretty fuck
S0624	cos if you yeah
S0628	but
S0624	but it's like the futility of like that i think that's what it like er just like well that stuff just highlight like
S0628	yeah
S0624	the futility of like individual action
S0628	yeah
S0624	and the bullshit of like erm sort of consumer
S0628	yeah
S0624	democracy
S0628	yeah
S0624	like it's just such a fuck ruse
S0628	yeah
S0624	like it be so annoy like
S0628	yeah
S0624	like vote with your purse like
S0628	yeah
S0624	and like all that kind of like whether it's like they're train staff or like but you can't change the world by
S0628	yeah
S0624	your individual decisions
S0628	yeah
S0624	and like it's like until yeah it just and it's kind of like be a vegetarian as well like it's just really pointless
S0628	yeah
S0624	like i'm not change anything like by like
S0628	yeah
S0624	you know exactly the same amount of meat be whether i eat
S0628	yeah
S0624	eat meat or erm
S0628	yeah
S0624	be yeah be whether i eat it or not
S0628	yeah it's isn't it cos the like where i always really struggle with that like where do the change start
S0624	yeah
S0624	yeah what for kind of
S0628	yeah cos you know that that it's er it's quite a circular argument isn't it the
S0624	yeah
S0628	cos it's true like
S0624	oh that's yeah
S0628	nothing change whether you do or don't but then if no one
S0624	yeah
S0628	if everyone think like that then nothing ever happen it's quite a difficult what do you think this be a completely different topic but kind of relate like about about so you know how the like there's such a terrible house crisis erm but i be talk to about this the other day that's why i think of it like policies like help to buy or something like that which be kind of like they're obviously a you know like share ownership properties and stuff which obviously like a little tiny stick plaster on a big gap wind
S0624	yeah
S0628	but it's just it's kind of how i see it but then on an individual basis like
S0624	it do help people get by
S0628	yeah what do you think what do you think about that in your interview cos i don't
S0624	i just
S0628	i don't know what i think about it
S0624	oh sorry can i keep the thank you
S0628	i don't know what i think about it
S0624	i think i i mean i think they'll like they they fee
S0628	cos be like
S0624	and i know
S0628	it's be that possibly harmful i be like
S0624	yeah
S0628	isn't it just inadequate he be like well it it
S0624	i think it's cos it feed the same kind of like house as commodity model
S0628	yeah
S0624	the money you just get really poor quality home
S0628	yeah
S0624	and the money go like the like the it's just like if the structural like all the money be still go back to the developer
S0628	yeah
S0624	it's like sure you're like but it's like government subsidise the developer be what it become
S0628	yeah
S0624	like cos they're the money that they buy into it allow those developers to sell their house at that price
S0628	yeah
S0624	like i just think it's like i yeah i'm not that into it
S0628	yeah that's interest that make sense
S0624	i just think it's like you know it's like
S0628	yeah i'm really struggle with it so much i think
S0624	yeah
S0628	obviously i think it's a completely useless i mean
S0624	yeah
S0628	like policy in structural term it's
S0624	yeah
S0628	obviously shit and doesn't it's like sort of look like they're do something without do anything to
S0624	yeah
S0628	tackle the actual problem it's like treat the symptom
S0624	yeah
S0628	and not the cause
S0624	like they just
S0628	but then i didn't know if it be like
S0624	the house crisis
S0628	i guess that like the money go to or like developers be give the money sort of
S0624	and the thing be until you until you increase the stock of house all that mean be that those home then just go straight back into the
S0628	the market
S0624	as soon as they're sell off like you're back to where you've start
S0628	yeah
S0624	they're just lose in the melee
S0628	yeah
S0624	and sell on at full price erm yeah i think like the starter home now as well that's like another one
S0628	what's that
S0624	so it's like you have to the starter so it's like cameron's new pledge so
S0628	yeah
S0624	so instead of affordable house target they're gonna be build starter home so in london the average price will be four hundred and fifty thousand pound
S0628	oh
S0624	for a starter home
S0628	and what be they
S0624	and that's get rid of the affordable home
S0628	oh
S0624	so affordable home like you could get a starter market rate
S0628	yeah
S0624	so it be like
S0628	still
S0628	yeah
S0624	but it be lower than that
S0628	yeah
S0624	and like he's just wipe that and it's all now starter home really but you also
S0628	and what they be the new build
S0624	they're new build so it's go to be part of like new build erm and the criteria for a new build new development it'll be you have to put in x number of starter home
S0628	okay and you buy them that way
S0624	mm
S0628	or you buy them in share
S0624	i don't think you buy them in share i think you there's like special starter home mortgage that you get but erm they with affordable home you have to they have to stay affordable i can't remember what the period be it something like twenty years or
S0628	yeah
S0624	like there be cos starter home be five years it's like like what the fuck what be the point and the only way they will ever solve the house crisis
S0628	be to build more house
S0624	be to build more house
S0628	yeah
S0624	and like the way to like there be set like the like yeah i tell you about like the green belt like so if like the one if you want to do it if you want to do
S0628	well just there's a lot of land be not be build on yeah yeah
S0624	you you've get
S0628	i've read about this before
S0624	build the green belt legislation tomorrow you would bottom out the house market by flood
S0628	yeah
S0624	the market with new home which would then be
S0628	yeah
S0624	affordable and the problem be that it's artificially scarce
S0628	so that's what really make me feel angry about it with house just like the clear vest interest in not like they don't want homeowners and home value to these wildly inflate home er value to go down
S0628	so that have to happen so no one else
S0624	yeah
S0628	can get any fuck house
S0624	yeah it's like it's so it's so intergenerational robbery it's really annoy
S0628	it's insane it's in london it's just obscene it's
S0628	something like the average house gain ten percent in value from like the begin of twenty fifteen to the end
S0624	yeah
S0628	it's like that be bonkers
S0624	and it would be a problem for someone like for example like
S0628	yeah
S0624	really compromise in the place that she buy
S0628	yeah
S0624	and just get this obscene mortgage for this thing and like
S0628	yeah
S0624	it's not like not in term of just compromise but like
S0628	yeah she's spend such a lot for a house
S0624	from social house and it be like
S0628	yeah
S0624	put money back into it
S0628	yeah
S0624	she would be absolutely fuck if the house market
S0628	yeah would actually
S0624	bottom out cos like that because like if you're build new build then a fifties flat in a ex council estate be gonna like no one's gonna want that compare to i still would cos i think it's
S0628	yeah
S0624	like much nicer the majority of people wouldn't so like it would just be like not only would it like decrease in value but the place that people afford would also
S0628	yeah that's true
S0624	not be desirable at all
S0628	yeah
S0624	erm
S0628	it's hard isn't it
S0624	but like you you you don't have to do it the thing be that you don't have to do it like like instantaneously you can do it gradually
S0628	yeah you do it slowly
S0624	but like that's what it should be work towards cos like the thing be that like the green belt be there like partly as like our stupid view like idealise view of the
S0628	yeah
S0624	english countryside and partly cos of this weird like well not weird but like a post war policy of need to keep our cultural land
S0628	yeah
S0624	the the security and it's so outdated
S0628	yeah
S0624	like like so much of that land be unproductive
S0628	there's a real paranoia about erm that once we start build on it then we're just gonna be like a horrible big urban sprawl
S0624	yeah
S0628	like i dunno like moscow or seoul or something it's go say well aren't haven't we build on like
S0624	we already be
S0628	thirty per thirty percent of the uk be build on or something
S0624	mm nothing
S0628	yeah
S0624	absolutely nothing erm lot of that land be not very it's not like great land like protect like the national park but everything else would be kind of fair game
S0628	yeah
S0624	you'd have to get plan permission so like
S0628	but surely you could just make restrictions on what you can build on
S0624	yeah
S0628	like you don't have to just be like okay we've lift it like do what you want
S0624	mm
S0628	you can replace it with legislation in the in different
S0624	well like plan applications like so you have to
S0628	yeah
S0624	have a a proper plan application if you wanna get approval
S0628	yeah
S0624	and guidelines and
S0628	yeah
S0624	but it's really
S0628	it's really bad isn't it
S0624	it's so bad like there be like in the erm like start of the nineteenth century no
S0628	yeah
S0624	start of yeah the nineteen early nineteen hundreds
S0628	yeah
S0624	there as erm like a big movement down from like the industrial towns and essex erm and people be just buy these plot of like ex industrial land
S0628	yes
S0624	erm call like the plotlands and they be build these kind of like ramshackle huts almost like
S0628	yeah
S0624	traveller communities
S0628	yeah
S0624	and like they're really incredible like but it's like
S0628	yeah
S0624	like jaywick be a legacy of it and like shoreham on sea be one of them
S0628	yeah
S0624	and that be pretty much what this that legislation be a response to
S0628	oh really
S0624	it be like people in the city be like all these poor people be move down and build these like
S0628	yeah
S0624	ramshackle huts but they be so beautiful and interest
S0628	really
S0624	they're almost a bite like allotments cos like everybody have like big garden cos you'd have like you know if if you be like just come down from like any really
S0628	yeah
S0624	you could buy a decent plot and like build whatever you want on it so just really
S0628	that sound great
S0624	incredible historical moment of like
S0628	yeah
S0624	self build
S0628	amaze
S0624	like self style communities it's like properly anarchist
S0628	yeah
S0624	erm
S0628	sound
S0624	but it be like it's only it's land like and that's the big thing and like people don't there's this really erm in the uk like no one that so there's like think of the land registry so if you
S0628	yeah
S0624	wanna find out who own something you can email the land email the land registry and they send you the deeds to that property but there be no map anywhere which show who own what
S0628	really
S0624	like no map
S0628	that's so interest
S0624	and there there's this guy call kevin cahill who write this book and he be like and so he like er the last time it be do it be like in eighteen fifty two or something
S0628	really
S0624	it be like the land registry map where they like
S0628	why not
S0624	aggregate all the information because it's political and there's it's like once you start to put it together and you actually i mean there's like percentages and stuff but until
S0628	yeah
S0624	you start to see like the mod own this this family of aristocrats own this like like ex mps
S0628	someone should do that
S0624	grandad own it there's there's this guy kevin cahill who write this amaze book call who own britain
S0628	oh yeah yeah i remember when that come out
S0624	and it's so brilliant
S0628	i remember
S0624	it's so and it's really radical and he's like
S0628	a lot a lot of the yeah we
S0624	yeah
S0628	a couple of years ago
S0624	yeah it be a few years ago
S0628	yeah
S0624	but it's like such a great book and this land registry still have no aggregate data
S0628	that's amaze it's so interest
S0624	yeah
S0628	yeah it's really it make me really depress it's so shit
S0624	yeah
S0628	like both on a sort of like wider principle level
S0624	yeah
S0628	but also really on a personal level like the idea of like i keep think about
S0624	yeah
S0628	buy a flat and how great it would be
S0624	yeah
S0628	to have a flat but then you're like where would i be able to have that
S0624	yeah
S0624	yeah it's so true
S0628	i keep talk to people who be like oh yeah i've i saw one of my old colleagues the other day and she be say another woman we use to work with who i use to work with who's quite senior and she and her husband be buy and they start off look in like and and now they're look at somewhere in like like south of with no proper transport link and stuff so they just need to buy something so but compromise that you make
S0624	yeah
S0628	and how long it take and how expensive it be you think
S0624	well 's like on the back of it
S0628	yeah
S0624	she's like i wouldn't do it again
S0628	really yeah that be full on wasn't it
S0624	yeah
S0628	that be well the thing be to me be like even if you could buy something just the principle of like how much above the odds you pay for this stuff
S0624	it's crazy so crazy like yeah
S0628	the way this
S0624	it's like i think it's really
S0628	it feel yeah
S0624	yeah go on
S0628	no i be just gonna say it's like london's never felt be it's home but it's never felt kind of precarious to me in the way that people talk about it
S0624	yeah
S0628	but it increasingly do like
S0624	that's so depress
S0628	and when my friend go up last year and that and he get into a rent house be say like i stay here for a long time cos
S0624	yeah
S0628	it's run er you know it's manage by a let agency
S0624	yeah
S0628	i have no personal relationships with the landlord so the rent
S0624	yeah
S0628	be so expensive once it have go up they've get no interest in like at least a a private landlord
S0624	yeah
S0628	who you know might have an interest in keep the same people for
S0624	yeah
S0628	you know it's less hassle for them or whatever like those agents they just get the key if you need them like these new people come in and they the rent up
S0624	yeah
S0628	cos they've get no interest in it and he go like every year it just seem to be like more and more up you know
S0624	up up up yeah
S0628	what will it be in a few years like what an average of a grand a month for rent or something
S0624	yeah it's crazy
S0628	it's completely ridiculous
S0624	it's totally crazy but that's really interest you say that to me
S0628	yeah
S0624	cos i often like you get catch up in the like like like abstraction of it as an issue
S0628	yeah
S0624	but like when you put it like that that be that be really that be
S0628	yeah
S0624	what it be it's like you know
S0628	yeah
S0624	you might and the you have to make i mean it's so two things
S0628	yeah
S0624	one if we can all just go and move to edinburgh
S0628	yeah
S0624	which be actually like
S0628	or anywhere
S0624	in the back of my mind like
S0628	yeah
S0624	a backup option like just fuck it like
S0628	move to edinburgh
S0624	like or move up
S0624	like mass move out
S0628	yeah
S0624	like i think there there would be probably quite up for that erm
S0628	or anywhere else
S0624	just anywhere else i would love to go to manchester or glasgow
S0628	yeah
S0624	er so no it's not and then
S0628	yeah er i know this friend who once move up to manchester they buy a house
S0624	oh yeah
S0628	and it's like erm it's like a family home it's like a three bed they're a couple and it's like a three bed house with garden like amaze just do the kitchen live room and din room it's like really really nice like beautiful house and it be like i can't remember how much or it be less than three hundred and fifty thousand
S0624	oh god
S0628	and it's in a really nice bite of manchester
S0624	that be crazy isn't it
S0628	yeah when you compare it to
S0628	to people buy like but like nice place like get
S0624	yeah
S0628	a council flats with two bedrooms
S0624	yeah yeah
S0628	for that
S0624	yeah it's crazy
S0624	it's really crazy but i do like the thing be like
S0628	well actually my brother's house he just buy in even be he use to live in like er it be just in it be a tiny little ex council flat erm
S0624	yeah er sorry can we get the bill please
S0628	yeah
S0624	thank you
S0628	so a two bed maisonette in but it quite right by station
S0624	yeah
S0628	so a really good location but like really tiny
S0624	yeah
S0628	and they buy a really nice three bed house in
S0624	really
S0628	and he say it have the same market value as the flat so there be no comparison
S0624	that be so crazy
S0628	isn't it and it's like a nice big
S0624	it's it's like yeah i dunno like even like with those distance i just think
S0628	but anyway it be crazy
S0624	yeah london be like i think london be london be an interest one because like you know there be not space for as many people who want to live here
S0628	no
S0624	but there might i just think you have to start think about it different like you have to think about like it's one of the things like it's like make you can invest in london be much more multimodal
S0628	yeah
S0624	so like at the moment in like say even if you live out like it's still there's so much
S0628	yeah
S0624	since i live there for work even if you live out in like
S0628	yeah
S0624	but like if you properly invest in like and i i think they be try to but like you say very haphazard
S0628	yeah
S0624	like stratford or the olympic park
S0628	yeah
S0624	be like a centre it be a shop centre
S0628	yeah
S0624	and now it's like this in shepherd's bush as well like it's just like
S0628	yeah
S0624	poor imagination for how to do it but the like if you can start like
S0628	do that
S0624	distribute it
S0628	yeah it make sense
S0624	and like create like and you don't want like
S0624	endless sprawl
S0628	yeah
S0624	but like there's like sprawl already like in south london there be so much low density semi detach house
S0628	yeah
S0624	like if you just if you can like yeah just
S0628	yeah yeah
S0624	like demolish a council estate it's already relatively high density there be swathe of south london which be cover in that so it's like
S0628	yeah
S0624	like if you be be imaginative about it or you'd relax plan permission so the developers could buy it and then
S0628	yeah
S0624	like you know you'd get these like
S0628	yeah
S0624	block within
S0628	yeah it could be better couldn't it
S0624	we could be so much more imaginative but like
S0628	yeah
S0624	it's just interest
S0628	yeah
S0624	it's just it's like it's massively about interest
S0628	yeah it's really
S0624	and more so than anything there be this guy peter reid who use to be like the director of plan for the gla and he he say and really start he be like cos he's like be right at the so at the heart of it
S0628	yeah thank you be that alright
S0624	and he be like yeah perfect he be like it use to be about property
S0628	yeah
S0624	and that it use to be about like financial assets and now it's about property it's like
S0628	yeah
S0624	that's the seat of power
S0628	yeah that's really interest it be isn't it yeah it's just so erm
