S0679	so be be you enjoy this series of the sew bee
S0680	erm yes in large part it's it's quite good entertainment but the some of the erm sew be a bite er strange cos there's no kind of emphasis on the under finish or anything like that cos it's just make it in the time
S0679	especially with the alteration challenge
S0680	yes which be you know fair enough they haven't get long but
S0679	mm
S0680	but some of them do seem a little on the rag side and they do seem to use pattern
S0679	yes
S0680	you they do seem to follow a pattern rather than some of them'll modify pattern but er
S0679	i think this time i think in i think previously they have a direct make or something as a on a particular week
S0680	what do you mean
S0679	well they have to fit it directly on the person or they have to make a paper pattern i can't quite remember
S0680	mm
S0679	but there be something but there be one part i mean generally there's one part where they have to they're give a pattern and they have to make it up
S0680	yes
S0679	which be reasonable isn't it cos that's sort of like a blind challenge
S0680	well it yes i mean they have be choose their own pattern but and they have pattern for jacket and things but er you know some of the more simple stuff i suppose the er what do you call it the revamp things
S0679	mm
S0680	be a bite more
S0679	alteration challenge
S0680	the alteration challenge be a bite erm a bite different on that but er
S0679	they're sort of make something out of a pattern then aren't they although some people make their own paper one
S0680	yeah
S0679	but they tend to be a bite a lot of those tend to be more loose garment don't they
S0680	yes
S0679	mm but and er
S0680	and they can be a bite throw together
S0679	yes
S0680	and sometimes they don't always seem to have the use the material that appropriately i don't think like
S0679	i think mum would have a few things to say about it cos they have a big piece of material
S0680	yes
S0679	and they just pin things all over the place on it
S0680	mm
S0679	and er mum be very good wasn't she about erm
S0680	oh yes well mum be a
S0679	er make sure it go together as in small er small as small a space as possible
S0680	yes
S0679	but then it do depend on the pattern a bite doesn't it
S0680	what the print the design
S0679	the your repeat like on
S0680	yes
S0679	wallpaper you have
S0680	yes
S0679	repeat then
S0680	well it do to some extent on the other hand what i haven't see them do particularly be open the material out erm and refolding it in a different way because mum use to refold her material so that you could get well you know one leg up one way and one leg up the other not put two legs follow or something
S0679	oh right
S0680	you know so you would use
S0679	mm
S0680	so instead of get a waste bite in the middle
S0679	mm
S0680	if you well you have to put it against well no if you have to put it against the the er fold er against if you fold it in half to do it double to get the symmetrical shape
S0679	mm mm
S0680	well mum wouldn't fold it like they sort of seem to fold it in half and cut it against the fold so
S0679	yes
S0680	you get a big scrap along the bottom
S0679	mm mm
S0680	of the the selvedge er there whereas mum would only fold it as far down as she need to cut the size so she'd then have an extra piece of material that be double the size of the scrap they're get
S0679	yes yes
S0680	and you could then put another piece in it so you could cut possibly one bite and then from the bite that be leave over that wasn't fold
S0679	yes
S0680	she could cut the other bite flat you know refold it down the middle and
S0679	mm
S0680	cut out the one the other way by erm move it up or move it down slightly cos i remember at school when we use to get erm tell well we use to have to follow a pattern like the pyjamas we make stripy pyjamas i think i do get the material from school in that case but for example with similar things like that
S0679	mm
S0680	the pattern a proper shop buy pattern would say you need two yards
S0679	yes
S0680	erm mum would say you don't need we we don't need to do it in two yards we can do it in
S0679	mm
S0680	a yard and a half or whatever it be and er we have to buy the pattern as well so mum use to pin the pattern on the material
S0679	yes
S0680	or show me where to pin it on the material
S0679	mm mm mm
S0680	erm and i'd take it to school like that and then at school i would put it on more carefully you know she wasn't do it all for me but she would show so i could show the teacher where the bits go
S0679	mm
S0680	but you didn't actually need that extra half a yard
S0679	yes
S0680	especially if you be buy some you know reasonably expensive material
S0679	and anyway it save the pennies and that be important
S0680	and that be important but you see mum i mean mum be a tailor really i know she do dressmaking but high standards cos she do make suit and well she make everything from the skin skin upwards
S0679	mm
S0680	outwards erm really cos in those in those days erm during during the war and after i mean they they make underwear and everything from
S0679	mm
S0680	if they could get a bite of parachute silk
S0679	mm
S0680	they'd use that for underwear and ladies would go and buy a full match set of something you know so they'd have the the slip and the knickers and everything and then they'd erm you know they would buy erm sort of an outfit
S0679	mm
S0680	so mum could do all that and she could do i mean she that's what i mean she do tailor in those days they have quite fit jacket and things she could do tailor and erm so on and be wartime those men's wise baggy trousers they use to have
S0679	mm
S0680	on suit if you get an old pair of trousers you could make a a decent skirt out of it cos you've get
S0679	yes
S0680	four legs
S0679	mm
S0680	to play about with so you could cut it in a would it be a you'd certainly make a panel a six panel skirt or
S0679	mm
S0680	erm any of those sort of ones that you need seam in so erm she be dab hand at do that from little bits of material and of course my friend be in her element when she be er come round because she love sew
S0679	mm
S0680	so mum and her would be pattern and look at this that and the other sort things out
S0679	do they make things together
S0680	er not really i don't think they actually make anything together but they talk about what they be do
S0679	mm
S0680	i don't think she actually help with anything and be pretty good at do things so make a suede coat cos her father have get these erm skin
S0679	mm
S0680	from somewhere or other and erm make a suede coat when they be fashionable in the sixties
S0679	mm
S0680	you know with the cover button and everything and it look perfectly decent which be quite a a lot for a sort of sixteen year old or so
S0679	yes
S0680	to take on
S0679	although one of those on the telly be
S0680	yes she's not old be she
S0679	i think her name might be jade
S0680	yes
S0679	i don't think she's particularly old
S0680	no
S0679	and she be say the best thing she'd make be her prom dress
S0680	yeah
S0679	which look particularly nicely make
S0680	well i think she's yes she's a later sort of
S0679	mm mm
S0680	teenager i think as well but you know be quite sort of confident about
S0679	mm
S0680	cut this erm expensive stuff up and well you know you she use to run up things to wear at the dance
S0679	mm
S0680	or same as mum do for me cos i use to draw it and she use to make it
S0679	mm
S0680	but er
S0679	do you see things in magazines or shop how do you get your ideas or do you just do them you do you kind of know what people have and make one up
S0680	well i kind of saw bits of things i like and make one up really
S0679	mm
S0680	erm cos i i well it's the same as now i never actually want to actually be wear what everybody else be wear
S0679	well you certainly don't do that
S0680	you know er i wouldn't just want to be look like everybody else but i like to take the kind of the the theme and erm plus mum have provisos cos be i be only er like i wasn't allow to down to the dance till i be seventeen i think it as yes and er mum have provisos as to what i could actually have so as to how low the front be and you know well not how how short the skirt be to some extent although they be shorter skirt so erm you know there be that to consider so i do have some quite a few dress that have quite er a low neckline at the back you know
S0679	mm
S0680	up to up to your bra strap which be quite erm dare
S0679	would you you cover up in those days
S0680	yes which you didn't go you definitely do didn't show your strap like they do now and if you've get a if you've get a sleeveless dress you would have little er little poppers and loop to put under your bra to keep it
S0679	mm
S0680	on your strap
S0679	mm mm i be look at one er out of my summer clothe and wonder if i'd sew that kind of arrangement in because it's always a bite awkward
S0680	mm
S0679	when i or whether it come and i couldn't couldn't decide
S0680	no or or you would use erm a very little tiny gold pin
S0679	mm
S0680	erm as well they be useful and if you have a halterneck dress then you'd you'd have a a suitably shape bra strap
S0679	yes you wouldn't wear over the shoulder strap
S0680	no no no
S0679	which people do now like that lady i be talk tell you about on the train
S0680	yes oh i know
S0679	who have this sort of quite it be a sort of the first hot it be the i should think it be the hottest day of the year
S0680	mm
S0679	so far and she have this sort of vesty top and this sort of pad erm foamy sort of big cup bra
S0680	like a wonderbra
S0679	well i don't know do they push up i'm not sure what a wonderbra do but
S0680	i i think it's suppose to enhance one's potential
S0679	but it there's some that really look as though they're make of bits of erm foamy material that be sort of
S0680	yes
S0679	bend over
S0680	oh right
S0679	that sort of really er anyway it there be quite a i could i could i could check it out quite carefully
S0680	yes
S0679	because of the way her her top go

S0679	oh
S0680	the material have get a slightly erm kind of emboss it wasn't it wasn't so shiny it do have a slight textured emboss tiny little

S0679	mm
S0680	i have which you probably like be the one with the swirly different colour it that be pinky purplely

S0679	mm
S0680	and then that be erm have erm dart and dart from the waist so the bodice be fit erm and it have a it be waisted and it have erm i think it it wasn't it have a slightly flare skirt because it that again be erm be it it wasn't it might have be tricel there be another word for er it be a man make fibre but it didn't screw up or anything it be and it be thin

S0679	not not the pink swirly one no erm
S0680	i can't think which one that be
S0679	oh
S0680	with a belt
S0679	but another one you have be like erm you have make nighties out of that erm slightly furry fabric
S0680	furry fabric
S0679	er you know like like the you've get that apricot long nightie
S0680	what be that
S0679	well it have little strip across
S0680	brush nylon
S0679	brush nylon be that what you call it
S0680	yes
S0679	it be like a big t shirt with those pearl button on it
S0680	oh i know what you mean yes yes
S0679	and they have lot of different colour
S0680	er yes that be a slightly velvety effect
S0679	be that brush nylon or be i rude about it
S0680	with a print erm well it's kind of like that but it be have a slightly erm velvety but it it be a kind of stretchy material and it be like a erm a big t shirt only not like they wear now that's flappy with the off the shoulder it be erm a properly fit your size erm er like the top of a t shirt erm but it have erm an oval sort of neck and it have a little placket with button i think at the front or
S0679	mm mm
S0680	and then erm it go carry on but it be quite narrow it wasn't a flappy t shirt it be quite fit on the hips narrow and short and it have get a sort of wavy a wavy pattern
S0679	mm
S0680	it wasn't a swirly one it be a wavy pattern
S0679	mm
S0680	and it be green and orange and yellow and but it be very thin
S0679	yes it be very pretty
S0680	line it be very pretty and it it be quite a a clingy
S0679	mm
S0680	type thing and then i of course the fashion come in cos those be kind of i'm talk sixty seven sixty eight kind of era and then erm also knit dress the well crochet
S0679	mm
S0680	dress erm but you could also have a knit dress with a holey pattern in a crochet pattern in and it wasn't too holey and erm it have scallop crochet round the end and it be just like a erm i suppose like a a shift you know it be just erm it be just like a a vesty top only with a higher boat neck slightly cut in erm armholes and erm straight and thin erm just and it have scallop round the edge and it be like erm not navy blue a a warmer colour than that sort of midnight blue and of course it be very holey you're suppose to have tassels round the bottom but i never get the tassels and i have scallop instead and there be a twist wool belt thing
S0679	mm
S0680	and you tie round but it be it be a bite holey so mum make a line for it
S0679	mm
S0680	so i have a line one cos she didn't
S0679	mm
S0680	think it be quite the thing
S0679	no
S0680	to go round show your hole through the skin through the hole so erm i have this line which be it be line material and it be very sort of erm er it be a what would you call it erm i can't think of the name it be like a satin it get a sheen on it it be the same colour
S0679	oh right mm
S0680	as the dress but get a bite of a sheen so
S0679	mm
S0680	when the light catch it it be quite
S0679	mm
S0680	pretty in the hole and it also keep the shape of the dress better cos some people's some people's crochet dress tend to sort of grow with them or
S0679	mm
S0680	get longer and things bite like possibly a bite like knit swim costume of the early fifties
S0679	i think you do well not to have the tassels i think they're much overrate
S0680	yes
S0679	i'm not sure tassels would have look very nice on it i think scallop be
S0680	mm
S0679	be probably better
S0680	i always fancy one of those dress that have that have erm possibly three or four inch er fringe that layer of fringe
S0679	mm oh yes
S0680	you now those
S0679	somebody make one on one of the sew be i think didn't they
S0680	yes layer of fringe
S0679	mm
S0680	so so it shake about and you don't have to move much although i use to move quite a lot but you know
S0679	mm mm
S0680	erm yes and and then what else do you remember do you remember my camel and green
S0679	oh yes
S0680	now
S0679	more a day dress wasn't it
S0680	yes camel and green be camel and green be erm one of mother's creations think of erm er challenge for alterations i think i think the camel start off be go to be a pair of camel trousers
S0679	mm
S0680	for me
S0679	yes
S0680	because they be the thing at the time
S0679	mm
S0680	er cos this would have be er when do i go to college this would have be late sixties erm and it be if of the era of the two tone
S0679	yes
S0680	er so i think i'd have this winter erm camel trousers but i don't know they didn't seem to be right so mum take them apart i mean she'd make them sort of very well but they just didn't seem to look right on me
S0679	no
S0680	erm she'd fit them you know when once they be
S0679	you do have your
S0680	fit
S0679	pantomime horse trousers didn't you later on
S0680	well this be it yes they be they be corduroy trousers that look like the back of a pantomime horse even though i wasn't quite that broad across the anyway er mum
S0679	i think that be part of the problem actually
S0680	yes
S0679	wasn't it
S0680	yes mum er we have this pair of trousers and they must have be reasonably straight trousers er and mum make this panel dress for me it be military style and it have bottle green long sleeves in fine wool erm er quite a fit sleeve and it have a a yoke that be erm that have two point down along the front
S0679	mm
S0680	so it look kind of a bite like a back of a military jacket front and back
S0679	mm
S0680	so that be a bottle green and then the rest of it be these trousers so where the point of the bodice come the yoke come there be a an over sew seam down each side and and at the back which also do the fit for the front
S0679	mm
S0680	because you only need narrow panel
S0679	mm
S0680	and because it be a shorter dress you could get it out of the trouser length
S0679	mm mm
S0680	erm so that be my camel and green and i wear it for my college interview
S0679	oh and very appropriate for a
S0680	yes
S0679	interview
S0680	and erm as i say erm i think not so long back mention the camel and green cos you know as a creation it have a long zip down the back
S0679	mm mm
S0680	that be one of mum's things and then i have erm there be that very nice it be a long dress be it i think it be a long dress originally the one in the little pattern that your work bag your er sew bag be line in
S0679	oh yes
S0680	that be a pretty one but
S0679	well we all have those long skirt didn't we
S0680	yes well this be a dress with a erm a square sort of piece and it have not lace round it
S0679	mm mm
S0680	a square erm bite on the front erm yoke sort of erm a square thing and slightly puff sleeves and long sleeves erm cuff long cuff long sleeves and it have grandma's lace round it
S0679	oh yes
S0680	that lace be nanny 's lace just a tiny bite let in cos it be the same colour as that be a laura ashley type fabric
S0679	mm
S0680	little showery things and then mum shorten that for me i think

S0679	yes
S0680	you know they didn't have identical they have erm a match pair i'd forget about that yes as well so they have those i remember that i can't remember i think they have them do in london i can't remember
S0679	gosh
S0680	but er
S0679	i expect it would cost a fortune to go up to london these days and have your hair cut
S0680	yeah
S0679	it's although i mean perhaps it's no more expensive than have it cut in the in the centre of which could be expensive enough
S0680	yeah mind you 's dad have an account at harrods for his suit
S0679	really
S0679	so perhaps they be quite use to spend quite a lot because
S0680	yeah
S0679	i mean i can't imagine mum or dad
S0680	no
S0679	do that
S0680	well if you remember 's have two older sisters so she be the young one so her parent be quite old
S0679	mm
S0680	comparatively you know
S0679	mm
S0680	for the time erm there be a bite of a gap between she be the last one cos i remember go on their end of year out as it be
S0679	mm
S0680	up to london in in 's erm little well it be a mini but it be customise with a slopey back erm
S0679	that sound quite tricky be in a
S0679	cut down mini
S0680	well it's an old mini you know it's not
S0679	mm
S0680	one of these great tank
S0679	no no no
S0680	it be a little mini
S0679	i have a little mini i know little minis
S0680	i know yes
S0679	there's not a lot of space but
S0680	no
S0679	on that occasion we do manage to get six or seven people in in it
S0680	mm
S0679	for reason that erm that must have be nineteen
S0680	mm
S0679	nineteen ninety because that be on the occasion of dad marry and be sixty so that
S0680	yeah must have be yeah anyway we go up to london
S0679	sorry i interrupt
S0680	in this in this thing i be gonna say we go up to london in this thing and we park in the underground car park i can't remember where that be it wasn't marble arch i don't think so we be go along and all of a sudden we'd zoom down this underground car park erm i can't think where it be now and erm we go and have lunch in harrods cos he be go to order a suit
S0679	mm
S0680	and have a look round harrods
S0679	mm i do exactly the same thing in london because i go down to london with 's parent
S0680	yes
S0679	and 's father work at cos have offices at so we be
S0680	yes
S0679	and that's just off oxford street or somewhere like that
S0680	yes
S0679	well presumably somewhere in the centre
S0680	well i could have be park lane this underground car park
S0679	mm
S0680	we be go along and all of a sudden
S0679	yeah
S0680	where be we go
S0679	and you're out busy in oxford street or regent street or something
S0680	yes
S0679	and then suddenly you end up in in at underground in a car park on a day when the car park be mostly empty because you know the workers weren't use it
S0680	oh it be his work car park
S0679	yeah yes he
S0680	yeah
S0679	it be a
S0680	yeah
S0679	where he work
S0680	ah
S0679	i guess he must have drive down every day to have access to it
S0680	yes
S0679	erm
S0680	i i know stay in a hotel very near there
S0679	mm
S0680	that have an underground car park cos he's he you know he think it be like journey to the centre of the earth this
S0679	mm mm mm
S0680	thing cos he say i wouldn't have be able to i wouldn't have erm be you'd have to blindfold me i wouldn't have be able to go down there it be awful
S0679	mm
S0680	but he he didn't go very he he decide it wasn't they it be too it cost too much for him to drive down there and pay park all week so they use to send him on the train but er yes i remember something like that so i suppose if land's at a premium you just have to park your car down
S0679	well yes yes
S0680	downstairs as it be yeah
S0679	and and well the s be and his father anyway on that occasion want to go off and see some presumably london football match
S0680	yeah
S0679	and 's mum go shop and i go shop
S0680	yes oh
S0679	i suppose 's brother be there somewhere too
S0680	mm
S0679	gosh that be a long time ago be it
S0680	yes i remember 's mum
S0679	i mean they probably don't do the same thing now with park because otherwise you'd have to go through the congestion charge every day probably wouldn't you
S0680	yeah i suppose so unless be he a government department have they get
S0679	no no no
S0680	some special
S0679	he work for
S0680	oh that's right yes
S0679	he work on patent
S0680	i don't know
S0679	it's er it's 's brother who's er work for the
S0680	right oh well well there we be
S0679	yeah shall we erm have a will if you've get time shall we have a look at the begin of the sew bee cos
S0680	we could do
S0679	we didn't see all of it yesterday
S0680	mm

S0680	we could do that yes i haven't actually hear back from my friend erm the great sewer who er if she's be watch that programme
S0679	mm
S0680	be interest to hear what she think about it
S0679	yes perhaps it doesn't appeal to sewers i don't know
S0680	i don't know
S0679	it's quite good spectator sport and i find on the early ones erm they seem a bite more informative i think it be have that person who be more of a teacher as the other judge
S0680	yes
S0679	cos i'm sure i sort of learn things or think about things
S0680	mm
S0679	whereas i don't really get the same i don't enjoy that new judge the
S0680	mm
S0679	female judge
S0680	no
S0679	as much as the other lady
S0680	no but the man's quite funny
S0679	he he be he be actually come out to be really quite a character on it
S0680	yes
S0679	he seem a bite erm standoffish in the first series
S0680	yeah mind you i mean it be to some extent it be erm depend how much you know about the subject because i i i use to get quite a little irk about the the pottery throw down
S0679	on yes
S0680	and what they be do
S0679	yes yes
S0680	i think what be they do you know technique wise like should er you know no if you do that it's it's bind to warp
S0679	mm
S0680	and things you know but
S0679	mm but all these things with the bake things they're not make it i mean the everybody who be on the bake off like the the the the erm not that crème de la crème one but the other one
S0680	mm ordinary
S0679	they can all make cake well
S0680	yes
S0679	it's just if they can make cake under time pressure
S0680	yes
S0679	when somebody be when there's those erm presenters be er poke the ingredients

S0679	yes they do they do
S0680	i think that be the only one
S0679	yeah
S0680	i saw
S0679	they probably try and make it a bite more difficult and more vary each time
S0680	yes
S0679	erm but oh she be quite funny because she would always have a joke with erm er the guy
S0680	yes
S0679	judge and she would say oh he make my heart beat you know he she use to do her
S0680	yeah
S0679	sign language
S0680	yeah
S0679	she she be a
S0679	teach assistant thing it's like oh he make and her her her her sign for him would be do her
S0680	oh right yeah
S0679	make her heart flutter
S0679	which be quite funny because you know that be quite erm
S0680	yes
S0679	er i mean that it you know that be quite dare with him because he be very standoffish in those days
S0680	yes yes yes
