S0392	yeah so it's a rainy day for them isn't it
S0480	it be indeed a rainy day for horse race limit
S0392	yeah yeah there must be some sort of horse event go on down here as well today
S0480	well there there always be around here
S0392	yeah yeah i be read this book about erm where money come from you know so like how there's more money in the circulate around and it say
S0480	oh yeah
S0392	if you go and get a mortgage from a bank or something or take a loan out what it's do be it's not get that money off someone else it just put the money in your account from nowhere and what it do be it make sure that for every pound someone put into their account it keep say five percent of that or even as low as one or two percent of that and then it can give off anything else as well so it quite strange
S0480	so the money isn't transfer
S0392	no
S0480	so be that almost create money
S0392	yeah it be that's how money be create by commercial bank and there's all these model and everything it's really complicate i couldn't really understand it but there's a pyramid where the base of the pyramid be money people have put into their account
S0480	yeah
S0392	and the top of the pyramid be money that the bank have create and supposedly the bank of england can control the amount of money that the bank create by either raise or make smaller the base amount but apparently that's realistically they can't do that
S0480	by alter the base rate
S0392	yeah by alter the percentage that's on the bottom of the pyramid
S0480	yeah yeah yeah
S0392	yeah but that sort of link in with what you're say about the the build societies even sell on this debt
S0480	yeah that that's flabbergast really i just
S0392	quite a lot go on yeah yeah
S0480	it it always seem to me that that whole the whole industry that whole financial service industry sort of feed off itself
S0392	yes yeah
S0480	it's like somebody who's eat as much as they possibly can
S0480	in order to eat their own flesh to stay alive
S0392	yeah
S0480	and get bigger
S0480	if they're eat their own flesh how come they're get bigger be they really get bigger or be they not get bigger
S0392	yeah yeah well when we be in erm the stockbroker belt as you say
S0480	oh yeah
S0392	we go to in which be this private square you'd like it be just normal street but it's own by mitsubishi corporation funnily enough and er
S0480	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0392	and it's where the stock exchange be base now and there's this man stand on the door this bouncer really check everybody before they go in to make sure there's no one unauthorised go in or anything
S0480	yeah
S0392	so if anyone me or you try to get in he'd have you out straight away so there must be something go on that they don't want us to see
S0392	if he's they're employ someone to stand there
S0480	so that's the actual stock exchange be it so
S0392	yeah so only it's not on thread needle street anymore they move to behind saint paul's cathedral
S0480	yeah i've hear of of be it that'll be an unusual word that's uh
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	that's not often use these days
S0392	paternoster
S0480	yeah
S0392	yeah and that's be that er headquarter
S0480	it be yeah it's enormous
S0392	yeah
S0480	you see their truck come down here all the time
S0392	yeah be they refrigerate
S0480	uh do you know i don't i think i think they do refrigerate it but i've an idea they do general truck as well though
S0392	yeah i presume that the polar bear logo be because everything be just freeze yeah
S0480	oh yeah that might be a giveaway but i don't
S0392	but not all of them might we must be near morrisons then here cos they always
S0480	well it's just up there just on your erm yeah just up on your leave
S0392	there's some people who work for morrisons who live eh well not work for morrisons sort of own morrisons or be relate to the people who own it live not far from us a couple of miles and there be security in because one of their birthday party they have some like adele or someone sing
S0480	oh
S0392	apparently it cost them two hundred and fifty thousand pound for half an hour i don't know how true that be
S0480	er it wouldn't surprise me
S0392	yeah
S0480	it wouldn't surprise me at all
S0392	when you compare that to what we're get for today
S0480	uh it's strange isn't it erm
S0392	yeah
S0480	who be i i know that there there be a few of the morrison clan scatter about
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm and er
S0392	that's it that's where it be yeah
S0480	yeah yeah we look at a job there once
S0392	oh yeah
S0480	erm one of the morrison family isn't it but we didn't get it
S0392	that's who it be
S0480	they erm they god they who be it someone say that another of our clients erm and they've get erm some of the money that come from erm the place in the big shop centre in
S0392	be it
S0392	yeah
S0480	and erm i think it be them they say they'd get erm your man from take that er what do they call him
S0392	gary gary
S0480	no
S0392	robbie williams be it
S0480	robbie williams they get robbie williams to play for a private gig erm
S0392	i think yeah that the the people do they own the land it be build on or something
S0480	i think so i i i don't know the ins and out of the whole
S0392	because there's all sort of rumour about people who live round here well not rumour i think they're they're probably quite true about people who've make their money from that oh i'm sure i've hear sell the land from the from somewhere before as well
S0480	might might well be there's erm around this area between you know from northwards go up towards i suppose i suppose up towards and up that way there's a scatter of people certainly erm all the morrison's money be up here
S0392	yeah
S0480	and all the money be up here or a lot of it be up here and erm it's just it's just mind boggle the the sheer the sheer volume of it and the difference
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know you're not talk about somebody who have make a million which isn't that unusual these days
S0392	especially around here
S0480	yeah erm or somebody who's inherit a million or win a million on the on the er lottery or the pool or whatever erm it's multiples of that
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know a million pound be just really almost out of pocket stuff for them
S0392	yeah
S0480	same as you or i might spend a tenner
S0392	yeah you're right i think someone say that there's more millionaires in than anyone else in the country any other region
S0480	really
S0392	yeah i don't i think it's one of those little factoids that you hear about i don't know how true it be but it's certainly believable isn't it
S0480	well know yeah yeah it it it could be i i mean i'd have think london be far more than
S0392	yeah so would i
S0480	cos there's you know people who live in london they erm the you know the people who live in kensington and stuff
S0392	yeah
S0480	pay two hundred million for a new house
S0392	yeah yeah i know
S0480	i'd have think they must be an order of magnitude again on from people around here
S0392	yeah yeah yeah
S0480	you know your
S0392	there be a few of them who live out in surrey hertfordshire buckinghamshire though as well
S0480	yeah
S0392	kent and essex
S0480	maybe that dilute it
S0392	yeah but no i that be what i would have think yorkshire's a big county though isn't it
S0480	yes yes it be
S0392	as we're i don't think we've ever leave do gigs no we haven't
S0480	want some
S0392	just leave north for the first time today
S0480	yeah be in
S0392	you definitely cross over the river into i don't know if you then go back on yourself or because we do the morning in in the registry office like two or whatever
S0480	yeah
S0392	which be in borough council which
S0480	so
S0392	strictly speak be its own thing now
S0480	that's an be be 's what be in
S0392	no no be erm it's traditionally part of
S0480	yeah
S0392	but erm nowadays a lot of those towns have their own individual borough councils their own sort of erm authorities unitary authorities
S0480	yeah
S0392	i mean i be when i be do the work experience at a lot of them be talk about devolution erm which be they be say what's go to happen to the future of the county whether it's go to be split up divide up cos especially be erm not know where to go cos it's include in the city region plan because
S0480	yeah
S0392	the and surround area which include some people have say that north yorkshire should be split up into and should go it alone or even just by itself it's all it's all to do with this northern powerhouse as well and they all want their own eh
S0480	yeah
S0392	what they want be which would normally return a labour mayor if they group it in with sufficient countryside and everything
S0480	yes
S0392	they'll then return a mayor that's favourable to whoever's in government in the day yeah
S0480	yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of that i a lot of politics involve in that
S0392	yeah
S0480	it's it's funny isn't it that you know as globalisation become more and more the case that you know you can even if you're just an ordinary person
S0392	yeah
S0480	get on a plane and go virtually anywhere
S0392	yeah
S0480	and you know you've you've you get this same stuff everywhere you go you know
S0392	yeah
S0480	you get an american airlines thing erm airplane find out you're drink spa water something like that
S0392	be that
S0480	all those sort of things
S0392	yeah
S0480	but at the same time there's also as as some things be move towards a one world philosophy there's more fragmentation come back in
S0392	yeah
S0480	so scotland want independence
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm
S0392	the devolution plan's everywhere yeah
S0480	yeah have always there's always be a bite of a joke about you know
S0392	yeah
S0480	udi for 's perfectly self sufficient we can just
S0392	yeah
S0480	get rid of the rest of them and get on with it
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm and there seem to be a sort of a trend that way doesn't there
S0392	there be yeah i know cornwall get give the status from the eu that mean its culture and its language need to be officially protect the same to the same extent as scotland and the other home nations
S0480	yeah yeah
S0392	yeah
S0480	same as wales i guess
S0392	yes yeah and then that spark fury from folks say we deserve it as well
S0480	yes far more important cos i mean cornwall lovely though it be
S0392	i yeah
S0480	have it just doesn't have anything
S0480	it have lot of scenery
S0392	yeah
S0480	and coast and and stuff like that but nothing much actually seem to go on there i i don't think there's any industry i presume there's agriculture in in cornwall
S0392	yeah well the the eden project be on that erm the old site isn't it of er be it chalk mine or something
S0480	be it
S0392	yeah it be erm originally some kind of industrial site and then it be renovate into the
S0480	into the eden project
S0392	the yeah
S0392	and erm i be surprise when i be at north cc the extent that they still go on about the tour de france all the time when it come to
S0480	do they
S0392	a a morning wouldn't go by and an afternoon wouldn't go by with something refer to it do you know what i mean when they be talk about devolution they say some people have suggest that we have one one authority for the whole of and if we could do it for a bike race we could do it for a government
S0480	ah i see yeah yeah
S0392	yeah and then they're say about do you remember when we do such and such for the tour de france and everything and do you remember this do you remember that tour de france tour de france clearly it be a big thing for the region
S0480	yeah oh it be it be huge
S0392	it be huge wasn't it yeah
S0480	absolutely huge
S0392	bristol street motor i saw there i've hear of them from somewhere
S0480	yeah they're all over the place it's a national
S0392	be it oh right okay
S0480	a national brand be bristol street motor
S0392	do they only ever go on a street call bristol street
S0480	no
S0392	cos that might be quite hard to come by here i be think
S0480	it would wouldn't it yeah i wonder if there be a bristol street in
S0392	i wonder where the nearest bristol street be
S0480	might be in yeah
S0392	yeah probably in bath or somewhere
S0480	have you be to bristol ever
S0392	funny you should say that yesterday i be think about go to bristol sometime
S0480	mm
S0392	someone raise the suggestion go to bristol cos i know with the cross country train from you can get there from without get out if you get an advance fare it's only about thirty quid there and back
S0480	can you
S0392	yeah
S0480	i've never i've always drive down to it and
S0392	yeah
S0480	my daughter use to live there and
S0392	i've always want to go
S0480	yeah it's nice 's son live there for a bite
S0392	yeah
S0480	and erm while he be there we walk it er a couple of time you know down the city centre and roundabout
S0392	yeah
S0480	and er yeah it's quite a groovy city be erm bristol a lot of erm
S0392	yeah
S0480	a lot of creative people
S0392	yeah
S0480	who don't want to live in london
S0392	i see yeah cos it's the second biggest city in the south for population
S0480	live in live in bristol yeah well there's a there's a lot of artists and musicians
S0392	yeah
S0480	that sort of culture
S0392	mm yeah
S0480	around erm around bristol you know people who've you know sort of find it more congenial than than london less expensive to live et cetera
S0392	i see yeah yeah bristol and it's very close to bath isn't it
S0480	and there's mr brunel's suspension bridge of course which be worth a
S0392	yes of course yeah that's all the photograph isn't it you see
S0480	yeah worth a a look at any day of the week be that
S0392	the yeah right
S0480	go along here we've pass near a place call
S0392	
S0480	yeah which i i just think it's a lovely name
S0392	be there a lot there
S0480	no
S0480	very little
S0392	be it like a little village or something
S0480	yeah yeah it be erm it's do you remember it it have a post office
S0392	post office well it's better than then if it's get a post office
S0480	yeah yeah
S0392	yeah i don't think no we don't even have a shop or anything
S0480	no it's a shame isn't it
S0392	be that strange as far as villages go
S0480	i'd have think a little cos it's it's about it's a similar size to where we have the bow
S0392	yeah
S0480	and that have a little village shop
S0392	yeah the people in be so different from anywhere else in the world do you know what i mean
S0480	why be that i wonder
S0392	they've all they've the mentality be definitely wouldn't want to be in in the village it would be drive out to that's not a problem for them and also it it's unlike anywhere else we've always think that there there's the character you get there the people there and everything
S0480	yeah
S0392	erm it's very much a village of two halve soon as you pass the pub it's in into the east end
S0480	i wonder why
S0392	definitely the people in the west end where we er you know other way round rather the people in the east end where we be would definitely say that you'd rather live there than in in the other side
S0480	so be the other side be the side nearer the
S0392	yes yeah
S0480	between the pub and the
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	right
S0392	i mean there's no difference at all really but they think they're a cut above where we be and with it be long and not sort of spread out as wide it's quite linear
S0480	yeah yeah
S0392	that create quite an introvert almost not want to
S0480	yeah it's funny isn't it yeah
S0392	go out which be why a shop maybe or a community thing wouldn't be the best thing only the a few of us from the village go to the domino drive whereas all the other three villages draw a a big local follow
S0480	do they
S0392	yeah especially and they all get plenty of locals whereas there's only me uncle and the person who run it
S0480	so it's a bite of a funny place then isn't it how this linear villages be really strange aren't they
S0392	yeah
S0480	's like that it's like two house wide
S0392	yeah
S0480	there's one or two streets off maybe yeah there's one or two i don't know i don't think they go i don't think they go very deep
S0392	yeah yeah cos and they're both not so linear they sort of spread outwards and i think it make people feel like they're more in it together if you know what i mean
S0480	if it's more compact
S0392	yeah there's never really be a lot go on in really
S0480	no good scarecrows at the minute
S0392	yes
S0480	that one of the bloke in his overalls in the bonnet of the car
S0392	yeah the mechanics yeah
S0480	yeah that's extremely cos it just look it's just get that lifelike look at it
S0392	yeah
S0480	look of it as you drive up the village
S0392	it's it's a it's a high standard that's for sure
S0480	yeah be it be it an actual competition
S0392	yeah they they have them quite frequently actually i think it's
S0480	yeah
S0392	it's an easy way for the village society to make a bite of cash
S0480	yeah
S0392	they have a family fun day in september as well i think it's next weekend actually or it might even be tomorrow yeah i think it's tomorrow
S0480	oh right
S0392	and even that's quite divisive there's definitely some people who say
S0392	definitely know do you know what i mean
S0392	we use to have gala day every year i think it run until i be about six or seven and that would be little race
S0480	yeah
S0392	a disco sometimes
S0480	yeah well load of erm
S0392	yeah
S0480	load of villages have a little do i mean there's one at

S0392	gosh
S0480	it's a very erm it's a strange place to build an airport
S0480	because there's a bloody great hill call at one end of it
S0480	and if you you know if you're talk about the thirties if you're stagger into the air in some er overladen old biplane the last thing you want be a bloody great hill right in front of you
S0392	yeah
S0480	and there's well the same apply now really
S0392	i can't i can't see any aircraft at all
S0480	erm you frequently can when erm when it's clear you know you see them take off
S0392	oh yeah
S0480	over there
S0392	we go to the wetland centre in which be directly in the heathrow flight path
S0480	oh yes you do didn't you
S0392	and there isn't a second where you can't look up and not see anything
S0480	yeah it's not as busy as that but yeah
S0392	yeah one go through and by the time you can still see it the next one's come through

S0480	i'll show you a build as we go through here on the leave hand side and industrial estates can you see the build on your leave hand side
S0392	be it the the greenish one yeah
S0480	the greenish build well
S0392	yeah
S0480	it extend i don't know if you can see it very well it extend all the way through no you can't see it
S0392	oh yeah be it
S0480	can you see just glimpse of it
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah well they use to make airplanes there during the war
S0392	do they
S0480	mm
S0392	gosh
S0480	and it be camouflage the camouflage scheme be design by some really famous ah artist
S0392	yeah
S0480	and there that that's the end of it
S0392	gosh still
S0480	and it even have artificial sheep graze on the roof it be make to look like the surround field
S0392	it didn't oh goodness me
S0480	yeah
S0392	that's like in the beijing olympics in two thousand and eight yeah there be these people sell this erm they call it what do they call it turfrights or something
S0480	oh turfrights be it
S0392	no it it wasn't that it be something along that yeah the
S0480	oh oh i saw it i'm with you yes yeah
S0392	something along the line of it and it claim to help your grass grow but it be in effect
S0480	airplane up there yeah
S0392	green spray paint
S0480	oh really
S0392	yeah that they spray on the grass to make it look green and that's i always think it's a bite tragic really when they're have to spray the grass green
S0480	oh definitely
S0392	i try to google the name of the company to see if they're still in operation but i couldn't find anything
S0480	probably ashamed of it
S0392	yeah oh here we be monarch oh so be this it then there
S0480	that's it that's the airport
S0392	oh gosh yeah there's erm a ryanair fly down the runway
S0480	yeah yeah in fact just take off isn't it
S0392	yeah crikey
S0480	yeah it be never discover never the germans never find out where that factory be
S0392	yeah
S0480	they know it be around here somewhere but they never succeed in locate it
S0392	yeah i be in a forest erm i be in a forest right and the something similar what they'd do be they've put load of light in the middle of the forest when the blackout be on load of light to make it look like a city or a town
S0480	oh yes
S0392	and then dark in a city so then there be these massive hole which be bomb craters that be now fill with water they be like ponds
S0480	ah where be that

S0392	with a little smiley face if you're do well
S0480	yeah very good very good those sign i think erm i think if we come down here
S0392	yeah my latest computer science task thirty percent of gcse be to make a program that take a car registration plate you tell it how long it take to get between two sensors and if it's speed it have to output it and if it's not it doesn't do anything
S0480	oh right yeah well like the erm
S0392	the yeah average speed check

S0392	no like one p for every megabyte two p for every text and three pence for a minute of conversation on the phone yeah which isn't bad at all cos last year i have a setup where when i go to italy it be cheaper to send a text back home than it would be within the country

S0392	only ten p eh i mean it be ten p
S0480	yeah
S0392	phone to phone in the uk and then eight p as soon as i be abroad but now now it's better yeah i'm just see they haven't release who's win the labour leadership election yet

S0392	estimate eleven thirty we'll have to announce it during the wed
S0480	right
S0392	oh that's nice there through the house and down
S0480	yeah some bits of be just
S0392	what be those hill call
S0480	eh i don't know
S0392	i'll have to look it up
S0480	it's some bits of be nice but it be somebody in the nineteen sixties build a sort of arndale type shop centre which be horrible
S0392	ah do they ah look down there you can see all the chimneys can't you from the erm
S0480	yeah yeah there use to be erm somewhere down there there be a branch off the and canal
S0392	yeah
S0480	might have be a bite further down then it go part way into
S0392	really
S0480	and there be a wharf in
S0392	oh
S0480	eh yeah we're in now
S0392	yeah yeah when we be in there be this this church that be jet black with soot still from the industrial revolution when there be a
S0392	factories and things
S0480	in where
S0392	yeah
S0480	which church be it
S0392	it be it be the big one in whatever it's call
S0480	yeah there be a
S0392	up the road from the cricket
S0480	be it
S0392	it could have be actually yeah
S0480	mm
S0392	up the road from the cricket and up the road from oxfam sort of come at it from a right angle near a fish and chip shop
S0480	yeah yeah it be i think
S0392	mm if you're ever there then you'll see what see what i mean i see what time i tell mum that we'd arrive cos er i can't remember whether it be i think i tell them half eleven what what time would you say from say it's five past eleven now what time
S0480	oh we should be just about right for half past
S0392	okay then
S0480	but it but it depend on the traffic really
S0392	yeah will be in the venue from eleven fifteen i think they say
S0480	oh right that's fine
S0392	yeah
S0480	that's fine probably find your mum and dad have go a simpler way on the m62 and they're already there
S0480	but when i look at the mileage i think crikey i think we'll go the short way cos it's
S0392	yeah
S0480	a lot less fuel
S0392	i saw there's a really short way where you sort of go through the through and everywhere be the way we've come or no
S0480	ah no well ish
S0392	yeah yeah right so we all try and get there for eleven thirty there's a comfy place for us to sit down and
S0480	i like the idea of that
S0392	yeah
S0480	i really like the idea of that that use to be a library look at it's all overgrow how sad be that
S0392	ah yeah
S0480	that lovely build there and it be erm oh it's when libraries i think it be before municipal libraries there's a real well know american philanthropist might be there might be a notice
S0392	yeah
S0480	over the door or something set in stone it's a shame because that'll be become unsafe
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	that stonework with the tree grow out of it and everything
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know bits of it be go to start fall off onto people
S0392	yeah it doesn't look a million miles from what this mill's gonna look like
S0480	yeah
S0392	yeah they're sell it aren't they say that they've get another mill somewhere else but i didn't know i didn't know that do you talk to them much when we meet them in
S0480	yeah a bite but but they it it be more about you know the erm it wasn't about the business so much it it be much more about erm them and what they want to do
S0392	yeah
S0480	and the the wed and music and general stuff so i didn't find out about the business but then
S0392	mm
S0480	erm presumably they're they're just go mail order which
S0392	yeah
S0480	they'll probably do it out of an industrial unit somewhere
S0392	and trade fair i think yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	i mean i don't know if they've get other job
S0480	i i think it's a family just you know wonder if there's a be a textile
S0392	mm yeah yeah
S0480	business there for a long long time
S0392	yeah she say her dad have it i don't know whether erm
S0480	yes that's interest you know there'd be there'd be there'd be dark satanic mill owners
S0392	yeah
S0480	from the time when people wear
S0392	yeah
S0480	top hat and weskets and oppress the workers
S0392	yeah yeah i don't know whether have a trade or anything or a job before he before he become sort of involve in the whole mill thing i notice on their facebook that they've they've get two pet cat i think who's look after them but they've definitely upload a photograph of a cat in a bathroom
S0480	oh do they alright
S0392	it look like a nice bathroom though
S0480	well i'd imagine well i mean just own that mill
S0392	yeah
S0480	if if they're sell it you know they'll be sell it to be redevelop into flats or something like that wouldn't they
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	so er yeah i think that down there be the line of the old canal that go into
S0392	yes yeah
S0480	into bradford
S0392	ah erm er there's a speed camera be it
S0480	mm
S0392	i notice on the north yorkshire website the north yorkshire police website
S0480	yeah
S0392	you only get a speed awareness course if you're something like four miles an hour over the limit i think well why don't they just put thirty four in the circle instead of thirty
S0392	if they're only go to pick you up if you're do you know what i mean
S0480	yeah here's a a mill
S0392	yes
S0480	on your leave hand side
S0392	yeah yeah and it's
S0480	typical mill although that their mill their textile mill look comparatively small
S0392	it do doesn't it yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	maybe we can only see the front on the picture
S0480	yeah i mean look at this this this hasn't change for
S0392	no
S0480	a hundred and well probably two hundred years now
S0392	yeah they say that they're really wear out from do load of decorate and everything
S0480	yeah so i wonder what they're do if they're shut the mill down and move it somewhere be they move house move
