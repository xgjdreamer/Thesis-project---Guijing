S0523	right
S0486	right you're go to talk about china today and your recent visit there
S0523	yes er yes indeed i er erm i go to erm to china at the end of september come back in october we be there for about three weeks or so three to four weeks and erm yeah i've get some photos that i can use to sort of discuss or or just tell you a little bite about the what happen and the first the first one i i'll show you the last photo i er we take it's a bite of a selfie
S0486	oh right
S0523	and it be it's me er look at a a a nice cup of coffee and this this be in airport and it be the last drink to use up the local currency and erm and you notice there be er there be two two erm when it when it when when it it's when the camera behave itself erm erm and you notice there's two straw and a stirrer and this turn out to be the most expensive cup of coffee er i've ever pay for it be er a ordinary cup of coffee i would say and it be six pound for a cup of coffee
S0486	gosh
S0523	and i don't think anywhere possibly in china be that much most cup of coffee in china be probably around erm the erm what they be in this country about two and a to two pound fifty three pound but this be we only have so much currency leave and we think we'd have two cup of coffee but in the end everyone erm on our on our in our group decide that this be just six pound be just too much so everyone ask for a straw two straw to to have our er to have the coffee anyway that it's just a it's a little bite of of fun there erm but if i go to the the the first first place we go to which be erm we arrive in beijing er at the end of september the weather be very very kind to us actually because beijing can be very erm er they have a lot of pollution and er but the two two to three days we be there it be erm as far as one could tell it be er well it's nice and sunny you could walk around it be lovely and warm and er and it be really right quite you know quite pleasant erm er place to to walk around but er the the pollution er we be tell can get down to very it can be very very bad er bad level of pollution so people be have to wear mask and that sort of thing but we didn't while we be there we didn't we didn't see that erm we do hear that when we get to shanghai at the end of our trip that in beijing that the the pollution have close in and er the index we be tell be over three hundred er however they rate the pollution index but it be over three hundred the erm er and apparently london in comparison so someone be say the pollution index in london which some consider to be quite bad be ten to fifteen
S0486	right
S0523	so so the the difference between beijing on a bad day and london be er be a be a different erm er you know different kind of er
S0486	category
S0523	category altogether really anyway we be we go round erm er we go round erm er er beijing erm on our couple of days and we go through to what's call a summer palace and erm and this be er the the the one of the things that i hadn't fully appreciate erm when when we go until we go there just how much history there be in china i mean you they their history go back erm thousands of years
S0486	mm mm
S0523	and it's just mind blow absolutely mind blow so
S0486	mm mm
S0523	it it it be a fascinate er and i don't think the chinese themselves actually have erm er have appreciate just how historical their erm er you know how much history they actually have and and and you probably know of erm it's be on the antique roadshow the other day that because erm they've over the years they've get rid of a lot of their antique
S0486	mm
S0523	and the antique be appear in the antique roadshow and various place all over the
S0486	mm
S0523	all over the world that the chinese now want to er repatriate as many antique as possible
S0486	mm
S0523	erm and er and i think a lot of their kind of old historical house they may have they may have er discard or or just throw away lot of really ancient erm er antique and now they they they need to kind of refurnish er they've realise now what a big draw
S0486	mm mm
S0523	er er it be for tourists i'm not sure if they still really think erm you know that they have er a i mean like ourselves and the royal family erm be be a be be probably a a much closer feel than a a normal an average chinese person to their emperors the emperors be you know a kinda long go
S0486	mm
S0523	erm type of thing whereas the the royal so so but anyway they be try to erm to erm er make a big thing of all their historical monuments now and of course they've get the terracotta er army as well terracotta warriors major major thing erm but erm er yes the er er er how how how can er one say their the mm
S0486	well well it's a bite like the national trust isn't it because the national trust erm get home donate to them to the country
S0523	yeah
S0486	and then they have to then furnish them again and look for antique and they buy a lot of antique for things to go in the national trust so it's exactly the same thing but the chinese be really need things now i mean if if you've get something tuck away in a cupboard or in the attic or
S0523	mm
S0486	aunt flo's old bowl or something that nobody think be any great value
S0523	yeah
S0486	but to the chinese it can be worth a huge amount of it be worth a huge amount of money to them to get it back
S0523	yeah it it it it it could be worth a
S0486	mm
S0523	an awful lot of money and erm erm and and it do depend on the erm the on the antique roadshow they be say it depend on what you know like all antique it depend what be erm popular at any one time so the erm the tang dynasty be the er the the emperor then he really encourage arts and culture and there be a period of er er prolong erm stability in the country and that give rise to lot of erm arts and craft which have erm we go into a couple of really really top notch er museums where the er and art galleries where they've get all these a lot of these artefacts go back to er six thousand years bc it's an absolutely
S0486	mm
S0523	absolutely phenomenal er the the art and the the skill er because they didn't have all the modern equipment that we have today so they er you could you could see what sort of skills they have
S0486	mm
S0523	oh you know six thousand years ago it be it be it be quite quite erm quite something
S0486	mm and of course chinese medicine be the oldest and most ancient form of medicine in the world
S0523	yes yes indeed
S0486	and when people rubbish acupuncture and that sort of erm thing
S0523	yeah
S0486	really erm they don't really know what they're talk about because that that's be practise for for many years and if it's practise properly it have a beneficial result
S0523	mm mm yeah yeah yeah
S0486	and a lot of erm chinese medicine all the herbs and that sort of thing they're the origins in a lot of proprietary medicine today
S0523	mm mm
S0486	and that's worth erm think about
S0523	yeah i i yeah i think there be an there we have a lot we be give a lot of information actually we be it be very very good tour
S0486	mm
S0523	but i i think erm what we didn't erm er what what could've be carry on a separate talk be the medicine side
S0486	yes
S0523	er that be er and er the other thing be erm i felt that the that the do and they do an awful lot of silk print so
S0486	oh yes
S0523	that that would've be er or silk erm er silk print so that would've be quite good if they'd be able to give us a a talk about how how they do all that and that would be quite good
S0486	yes it would
S0523	er we have a a talk on feng shui erm and we have lot of talk about the history but the history be so
S0486	right
S0523	so vast that erm erm but anyway go back to what we what er our our tour we we we be be we be we okay
S0486	carry on carry on
S0523	okay erm we have erm the we go round the summer palace and erm er the other thing the few things that i hadn't appreciate one be just how much history there be in this in china and it it's such a big place the other thing be i i i i er i should've realise just how many people there be so whereas you normally go to place in in europe and you there'll be a place people from america japan etcetera the the it seem to me the majority of tourists in china be the chinese so because it's one point three one point four billion the number of people
S0486	yes
S0523	there be huge number of people that erm they erm er gosh look at that over there you see he's fall into the water he's come right back up again gosh that's good
S0486	well just for the tape we're sit on the in and there's a party of five canoeists erm try to go over the erm while we're record this erm this talk today erm and the the interest thing be that you may hear and we're in a car erm but you may hear some erm water sound in the background and so while we're talk about china we're also look at canoeists try to get up the weir
S0523	and and they're go try to go up the weir and some of them be go up and then they're completely go under the water and then flip up again which be quite
S0486	yeah
S0523	quite remarkable
S0486	it be
S0523	how how they're quite skilful they're hold hold their obviously hold their breaths and and erm and themselves very quickly erm
S0486	yeah they're all erm they're actually sort of as you can see they're they're actually really cover in these little canoe aren't they
S0523	well not yeah
S0486	they've get these sort of like what do you what do you call them they're like canvas cover that they fit round their body so that they
S0523	mm
S0486	the actual canoe be attach to their waists
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	which be erm really interest
S0523	yeah they're they're very i don't think they'll i don't think they've get any hope of go up that weir
S0523	but maybe what they're try to do be to practise erm
S0486	turn on a wave
S0523	turn yes turn on a wave because erm you you yeah you've gotta be able to cope with erm i've do a little bite of white water raft and
S0486	oh
S0523	you you have to you have to cope with the erm the currents and the erm and also get wet and then recover sort of thing
S0486	anyway well shall we go back to china
S0523	mm yeah yeah indeed yeah so so er just so we we so first couple of days or so we've first day we go to erm fact we arrive erm i think it be about nine or ten o'clock in the morning so
S0486	right
S0523	so so we we couldn't go straight to our hotel so we we do erm erm we go to the summer palace the first day the first day we get there so we straight away we go erm from the airport on our tour it be quite remarkable really
S0486	yes do you
S0523	we have a we have a very good flight and
S0486	do you sleep at all on the flight
S0523	er yeah i have a a fair fair er fairly good yeah so it be erm yeah it's it's be it's er british airways flight and it be it wasn't bad it be erm yeah so it's and we er here be some photograph that you can see how crowd it be because most of these people here they're they're obviously people from all over the world but er there's an awful lot of er chinese people er go round and we our first kind of instruction be if you see two lions like this
S0486	yeah
S0523	you'll see er the male lion on one side and there you'll see it see and you'll see yeah a male lion on the on that side as on the leave hand side and and then the female one be on the right and you can tell the female one because she's get a a kind of baby lion er under her leave or i think it's her leave or right claw
S0486	right
S0523	and and and and the the way that be sort of er interpret be that erm that the woman be always right you see
S0486	oh
S0523	er that be our our tour manager say that's a a modern twist on the er on a very probably on a very old theme of something
S0486	yeah
S0523	er but the i mean this look better on the erm on a on a larger screen but the the the the er decoration and everything er on on some of these things
S0486	describe what we're look at here
S0523	it's a it's a erm well it's it's erm it's ancient i dunno erm
S0486	portico
S0523	yeah i i think when i say ancient it's a lot of what you see in china isn't it look old but it may not be it may be only in the last twenty thirty years it might or the last fifty years because they've do such a lot of work erm er because they know history be such a a big draw to people erm and there's a lot of interest so they've this might be very old but it might erm a er er er the british i think this be the place er or one of the place that when the british go to it er it might've be beijing but they burn a lot of er the the erm old build
S0486	oh dear
S0523	erm so the brits didn't have a a great erm erm
S0486	sympathy
S0523	sympathy erm there be a story that erm er erm er i think it's a colonel or captain mccartney do
S0486	right
S0523	er in the nineteenth century erm there's a story that he go to do business with the chinese and the chinese at that time be start so erm oh well they'd be quite a close country because of the big
S0486	mm
S0523	land er big range of mountains on the leave hand side of the country
S0486	mm
S0523	but and they've always be very kind of they've always be quite war kinda nation and they've get have warlords and and that sort of thing and and very and they haven't be really interest to go outside but at one stage the emperor be think about do more business with west to with europe and open up and that's in the nineteenth century and then he have someone like mccartney this captain mccartney or colonel mccartney or whatever he from britain go along and erm and he bring lot and lot of gift erm so we be tell for the emperor and erm and that's not that be good you know diplomatic thing to do
S0486	mm
S0523	but what he wouldn't do he say he would not bow to the emperor
S0486	uhu
S0523	he say he would only bow to his her majesty or his her majesty the queen
S0486	mm
S0523	he you know he will never bow to anyone else and because of that even though he bring load and load of present the emperor erm take erm take a complete erm
S0486	umbrage
S0523	yeah umbrage and erm wouldn't do any business with with the british and it it get very very difficult it lead to erm britain er it's er it's the it's the it's call the opium war
S0486	mm mm
S0523	where erm er as i believe the erm britons be er british be end up profiteer from er sell er opium to the chinese create a lot of erm drug erm drug dens in china
S0486	mm
S0523	er and and profiteer on on on that basis
S0486	mm mm
S0523	until erm and that sort of put put erm put the er chinese off erm europe for a number of years and it's always probably be a bite suspicious ever since
S0486	mm do do you remember that mum go to a jumble sale once and buy an ivory erm pipe
S0523	yeah
S0486	and it be it be always keep in the marble slab drawer in the hallway do you remember that be years and years it be there with the gloves and what not
S0523	oh i do yes i do
S0486	and she would never take it out and put it on show because she'd find out it be an opium pipe
S0523	oh
S0486	and it be for drug and she be erm and we get and we get rid of it i can't remember and you know that's one of the things that would be worth quite a lot of money now
S0523	i i think it would
S0486	i bet you that be you know we get rid of it i can't remember why
S0523	mm
S0486	erm she hang onto it for age and age
S0523	mm
S0486	erm and er yes erm that's one of the things you know if you take it to an antique roadshow
S0523	mm mm
S0486	it be very old then
S0523	yeah
S0486	so it it may have be worth a huge amount of money but we didn't erm
S0523	no don't know
S0486	yeah she she we just get rid of it i i can't remember my things you do get rid of things when erm
S0523	mm
S0486	well it it be erm no one be ever go to display it and it be definitely surplus to requirements so we didn't use it
S0523	mm
S0486	anyway so china again
S0523	so china so erm so anyway erm so lot of pagodas erm and sort of quite attractive sort of
S0486	tower
S0523	er tower erm erm and erm
S0523	room which the the the emperor erm and his er family er live and i i think they also have oh there's the female lion
S0486	right
S0523	with the cub under her leave claw
S0486	right
S0523	er we go into the last few days and and erm they have the lions round the wrong way
S0486	oh do they
S0523	yes yes so we we we should've point it out to them but erm very decorative and erm er actually it's quite hot in here shall i er can i take my coat off
S0486	yes you can
S0523	er
S0486	erm we'll keep i'll keep talk you take your coat off
S0523	yes yes yes yeah yeah i'll just
S0486	erm 's open the door of the car now and he's talk his coat off erm while i'm watch these canoeists who be really go mad over these rapids out here erm the sun's come out and the sky be erm the sky be a sort of grey colour we're just close the door of the car then and erm it be warm but we've get to keep the the doors and windows close because er of the because of the erm sound of the rapids out here
S0523	mm
S0486	and the erm now we we're go to to back to talk about china so i'll just pass this over to you pop that there alright
S0523	so erm we go round the summer palace which be very interest lot of erm but it it be so full of people but it be still very interest erm and er very artistic er sort of chinese erm bridge erm pagodas and erm
S0486	beautiful lantern there
S0523	yeah yeah lanterns and the special walkway that's it be a lot of these things be design for for erm the emperor and he er most of them have er a load of concubines and erm it be quite a we didn't see any concubines while we be there
S0486	i always think concubines it always make me think of porcupines
S0523	yes yes
S0523	so erm then what do we do then er let's have a look erm
S0486	what be your hotel like
S0523	hotel erm it be quite pleasant it be er a very central er hotel and erm there be er two or three weddings go on there at the same time it's quite quite it have a convention centre right next door and erm and they erm
S0486	and the people who be get marry be they all chinese
S0523	yeah yes all chinese very erm we we erm we didn't see very erm the chinese seem to be quite erm sort of er kind of quite affluent er chinese that we saw erm and er but but there be there's a big erm apparently a big dichotomy of er or split between the chinese who live in the cities who probably compose i dunno twenty to thirty percent of the population
S0486	yeah
S0523	and the the poor peasant farmer who erm comprise the most population so so the chinese government whatever you you know dispute about their erm their motives and everything and erm they have a a a major economic problem at the moment between the the people who've get erm er a more or more than you know be pretty erm affluent erm group of people who get well educate and all that sort of thing and then you've get the the sort of peasant farmers who who be just scrap a live it's it's a real erm they have get a real big problem so erm just as sort of an aside on that they obviously erm the communist party er who run china erm but you know you just think that nowhere else on earth be there a government er as far as i'm aware that have to control er as much as twenty percent of the the er population of the world
S0486	right
S0523	so er they have er so when it come to erm
S0486	yeah quite a think isn't it
S0523	it it be it be quite a think and it and when they when you think that erm they they're not very good on their human right record be be be not very good at all but then erm their the history of china er as it come over to me be that it's be pretty brutal erm er the you know er over the thousands of years that they've be erm in existence people er people've be execute and erm people there've be you know all kinds of war and everything like that
S0486	mm
S0523	which we in europe have never hear of er er er and and and it's be really really brutal and
S0486	no no
S0523	erm if you disagree with anyone in china er the emperor would you know literally er it seem to me have er his head would come off or something like that
S0486	right
S0523	so so it you know and i think erm it it might be in the erm er chinese er psyche er psyche that er that a erm the er the the that that's what if there's any unrest that that they'll they deal with people very very harshly erm so erm er we we erm i don't know if you saw on the news the other night er just when we get back on the bbc news erm there be a there be a a film on erm the bbc about president xi visit
S0486	mm
S0523	er
S0486	yes yes
S0523	and then they have a picture of this big church that have be erm where the people of this local i dunno town have group gather together and build a big church erm erm a christian church
S0486	right
S0523	erm and there be picture of the congregation erm all say their prayers and everything like that
S0486	mm
S0523	and and and on one side the chinese be be be very supportive of erm different religions and different group
S0486	yes mm mm
S0523	but erm there be one chap that attach to this church who be a bite outspoken and erm and so the next picture you see be that erm the erm this er the diggers move in
S0486	oh no
S0523	and they they completely erm they
S0486	raise it to the grind do they
S0523	well they didn't raise it to the grind but they break it so that the whole roof have collapse everything have collapse so it couldn't be use and and er so so the these chinese people be very erm they they they're very distrustful of any anything that sort of could challenge the erm the chinese government's policies
S0486	yeah
S0523	erm so yeah so it be quite quite quite something
S0486	i mean what what would happen in our country if we we've have a lot of trouble with erm with people from erm other religions erm some fanatical preachers who preach
S0523	mm
S0486	hate and
S0523	mm
S0486	what would happen if we go and pull down their their erm place of worship
S0523	i know and the the things they get away with in china erm be be be amaze er the things you wouldn't you wouldn't get away with it here erm their their plan laws i don't i think be non existent cos they if they er the er party the communist party say that's the way it should be then that's the way it should be erm
S0486	yeah we're very tolerant in this country i mean at the moment erm we go to at the weekend and we be absolutely amaze we get on the tube and there wasn't one person on the tube who i would say be of british origin
S0523	mm
S0486	ie everyone be talk in a foreign language
S0523	mm
S0486	erm you know it didn't matter what what what what colour they be they be all talk in a foreign language there be chinese there be romanians there be all sort of eastern europeans erm and then people who be obviously foreign because they're a slightly different colour
S0523	mm
S0486	erm but the whole of the the carriages in every tube that we we travel in they be none of them be what you could call originally typically english which make one feel like an ethnic minority in your own country
S0523	mm
S0486	but there you go that's how the world be now erm but you know a lot of place wouldn't tolerate that i mean hungary doesn't tolerate it erm and erm but we do
S0523	mm
S0486	and in in a way erm our country can't take much more of this saturation from other countries erm
S0523	mm
S0486	because we're go to use lose our our language as it stand now be go to be lose completely it's gonna go erm because all these other languages come in be go to completely change it
S0523	mm
S0486	erm so i just want to say that we do find it rather disconcert
S0523	mm on the other hand you see in china that that if if if any group you know get get look like it's get the upper hand it it's it's suppress erm vigorously and erm but that in you know history tell us that where group be suppress over long periods of time
S0486	oh yes
S0523	eventually erm it it it could lead to an overthrow erm situation which erm which erm one chap say one one guide say he say look we we might not we we we be most people a lot of people belong to the communist party but not everyone
S0486	yeah
S0523	but he say just look think of it this way if china ever er get out of control and they have you have to think about who's go to fee one point four billion people erm who's go to do that you know and we've get this immigrant crisis go on in europe but that's could be a tiny problem relative speak if if china ever get out of control so so it's in western europe's interest to if you like keep the state maintain the status quo in in china erm if they can can do all the things like fee the people erm provide erm growth erm and keep the erm er the er environmental issue under control then then you know you you you're you're you're get sort of like six seven or eight out of ten you might not be get you know ten out of ten but you're
S0486	right
S0523	so so erm
S0486	i can see what you're say i mean it would be an absolutely enormous problem and then
S0523	mm mm
S0486	what would we do erm but then you know we're only a small country england and we're not responsible for the erm problems of all these
S0523	no
S0486	enormous countries that have get plenty of space they may not have the resources there to maintain people but they have plenty of space there for people to grow food surely and to but and to make and to make a life
S0523	well
S0486	whereas we haven't get
S0523	mm
S0486	we're tiny if you look at the globe and you look at england in relation to all these other place
S0523	mm
S0486	we're just tiny
S0523	mm
S0486	absolutely tiny so the fact that erm more and people be come here and they're erm dilute our erm
S0523	mm
S0486	our customs they're dilute our food we've we're all our restaurants be now serve we very very rarely can you go out and have meat and two veg
S0523	mm
S0486	erm
S0523	mm yeah
S0486	it's always get to be something fancy it's gotta be something from india or it's gotta be from italy
S0523	mm mm
S0486	erm or something you know erm
S0523	mm
S0486	german food be be erm really quite plain verge on the erm almost like the british food in a way erm but you know and also and people say erm the italian diet's the best well actually you know in england if you'll if you eat english food properly you're eat you know vegetables and
S0523	mm
S0486	a lot of vegetables
S0523	mm mm
S0486	and in the old days nobody could afford very much meat
S0523	mm
S0486	so it be potatoes and and vegetables
S0523	mm mm
S0486	and that's what people have and that's very healthy
S0523	mm mm but but china i mean it's it's it's erm i i think i read that it's agricultural er because there's a huge mountain range and so it's get a lot of desert there there isn't lot of agricultural land so it's it's up to them to to develop their economy so they can buy in er food stuff so they buy in dry milk en masse apparently new zealand since i've be there er have change considerably and they now instead of have lot of sheep in new zealand which they probably still have they also have vast dairy herd and lot of the dairy milk be convert into dry milk powder which be then ship to china
S0486	right
S0523	and so erm er so that that's you know some of these so the knock on effect be if you can't make it yourself you've get to buy it in
S0486	buy it in
S0523	yeah
S0486	and by convert it into erm powder powder milk erm it keep much better and it's easier to export isn't it
S0523	yeah yeah yeah it be
S0486	erm
S0523	but just er on our
S0486	let's have a look at that describe that photograph to me
S0523	well one of the things that really hit me and erm i don't know hit hit other people but the the number of tall build er er that that have be build because people be flood into into the big cities erm you've get a city such as erm erm a small city be three million
S0486	right
S0523	erm beijing i think be around twenty five million and shanghai be about twenty eight million or something like that
S0486	right
S0523	something it's it's you know it's but so they haven't get place for people to live erm in a conventional way like we have round say so they've build these massive massive and large number of high rise er apartments so one guy say in er tell us on on er at one stage he he live with his wife and his erm erm er er one one daughter because of course they have the one baby rule
S0486	yeah
S0523	so they they they live three they live on the forty seventh floor of
S0486	good lord
S0523	of a build but you see in shanghai they anything if you say anything over eighteen floor be a high rise build
S0486	yeah
S0523	they've get six thousand of those
S0486	right
S0523	so you you if you just imagine and they're quite close to it actually if you look around and you have and er some of these place go up a hundred floor
S0486	yeah
S0523	er or more er yeah and they you you you just it's just erm amaze i mean this be just some of the construction go on in beijing at the moment sort of
S0486	oh yes i can see
S0523	you can just see er erm some of them erm erm no oh this be er sorry er this be on our first day and this be where the
S0486	yeah the student riot
S0523	er the the student riot be and erm and what you see be lot of it be actually quite it be a beautiful day and it be a a very pleasant day it's it's difficult to believe that there be riot here erm but these be erm all all construct on
S0486	where so we've be look at pillars of flower be that right
S0523	er yeah there's pillars of flower all the way round here erm that's our group there erm that's one of the famous monuments show er from the communist era
S0486	right
S0523	erm erm and erm and they have load of plant all the way round and when when this this be a common theme in in lot of place we go er where we see flower in in britain if you saw lot of flower you'd think of flower bed
S0486	yeah
S0523	but in china most of the flower be in flower pot
S0486	oh be they
S0523	so so you have this great big square where where the you know they have the the march past
S0486	mm
S0523	of the er er military
S0486	mm
S0523	and you also you know and and the there there there be some very ornate let me see if i can find oh yes that one see that one
S0486	oh it's beautiful isn't it
S0523	isn't it yeah and you've get that and then you've get all the flower all the way round and they're all pot so the idea of course be that you know one day you can have that and then if there happen to be a big erm a big
S0486	festival
S0523	a bigger festival a big event move all those to one side and rearrange them
S0486	yeah and so how what would they be make of cos we be look at flower in an absolutely enormous pot about as tall as
S0523	yeah
S0486	or half as tall as nelson's column so if you're look at that and the flower in there be enormous do you find out what they be make of
S0523	i i don't know no but the the the flower round the base be all you know erm
S0486	proper flower yeah
S0523	proper flower
S0486	yeah
S0523	the ones up there i suppose they could be silk er
S0486	yeah silk or paper couldn't they
S0523	or paper yeah yeah yeah er yeah it's it be very for how high very ornate
S0486	it's beautiful
S0523	yeah yeah and and then they have erm er some very sort of big statues and er as you can see the the length and breadth of the square there er there's another picture of it there it's it's quite amaze how how they do this it's a
S0486	yeah
S0523	it's it's quite quite something oh it's er er there we've get various statues erm see chairman mao just put it in perspective he rule for about twenty five years or erm and till about nineteen seventy five seventy six
S0486	mm
S0523	i think he die in seventy six and then the chap who succeed him and under his under everyone think of chairman mao as be er a father figure
S0486	yes
S0523	but that what what mao or his advisers do be to say erm they say all these teachers and all the er lecturers and everything like that should go to work on the field go back to fundamentals
S0486	oh right yeah
S0523	and so that's what he do and he he erm so what what the the the net effect of that be that erm he just put everyone to work in the field and on a kinda cooperative type basis but in the early sixties it have such a a detrimental impact that er three three million people die as a result of hunger and starvation
S0486	oh right
S0523	and er and normally in any government that would've be a er the government would've be topple erm but he erm he er he manage to continue erm but when he go the next his successors have all erm er put a lot more emphasis on education
S0486	mm mm
S0523	and make sure people be technically qualify and all that stuff
S0486	mm mm
S0523	and have have use that as as one of the
S0523	sorry
S0486	alright we just drop the tape recorder but that's alright pop it there
S0523	alright erm er but er the the erm the er er the the people who come after him realise of that of course that they the the the the economy need to be need to grow to sustain the number of people that be in china so ever since er mao's time er the there's be much more emphasis on the economy and education and erm and now they're say doctor and teachers have get erm guarantee or you know er will have guarantee pension at the end of their
S0486	mm
S0523	erm employment er when they retire whereas that be never the case before
S0486	no no
S0523	so this be the first time for that
S0486	mm mm
S0523	and there's a erm but the whole thing be to get the kind of everything move and er certainly you what you do see be all these factories churn out er load of products for
S0486	mm
S0523	erm er western europe and erm
S0486	i mean they're allow to have two children now as well aren't they just recently that that rule have be change
S0523	yes well it it yeah it need to change because erm er because they need a younger they need more people for the workforce but also traditionally what use to happen erm be that erm as you have a er an extend family the the youngsters use to look after their parent or grandparents
S0486	mm right
S0523	er but you might've see on the news the other night that because erm this be a real paradox because people be live longer erm you you you would see the other night on tv you saw er the the small baby her mother her the the grandmother but also the great grandparents
S0486	right
S0523	so people be live longer but you've get a big chain you've get one little girl
S0486	who's get to look after all of them
S0523	all of them yes
S0486	crikey
S0523	so so the the impact of that be be be be be quite be really it it's not just that they need a bigger workforce
S0486	no
S0523	but they need more people to look after the old people
S0486	mm mm
S0523	it's it's really it's really bizarre
S0486	i mean in the days of chairman chairman mao if he send everybody out to a cooperative to work i e college lecturers doctor dentists whatever
S0523	mm mm
S0486	he send them all off to a cooperative to work they must've have a terrific sort of brain drain
S0523	mm
S0486	within the central nucleus of cities and towns and who train the people
S0523	yeah absolutely
S0486	so they be well they be lack in in leadership and train in those areas
S0523	who be who it be a lose lose situation
S0486	yeah yeah
S0523	that's er that's another
S0486	that's another one of those huge
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	ceramic flower baskets
S0523	you see and you can see all the flower it's amaze really
S0486	oh right
S0523	yeah look at that see and they're all separate pot
S0486	yeah
S0523	so
S0486	well that must be a very economical way of do it
S0523	yeah
S0486	because erm in in around the place every season they pull out all the ones and throw them away
S0523	mm mm
S0486	but if they keep them in pot
S0523	mm
S0486	and water and fertilise they can bring them out next year can't they
S0523	mm mm mm this be a a famous build because if you've ever see picture of chairman mao he use to stand at the top there to to survey all the erm the troop and the march past the red army
S0486	what's the name of that place can you remember
S0523	er it's the forbid city
S0486	right
S0523	erm i think be the be the place there and this be we we're here we're go into the forbid city erm and it's full lot of full of tourists erm but but this be where erm why be it forbid er and erm it be where the emperor live until the last emperor live here until about nineteen twenty
S0486	right
S0523	where the last emperor be er what be the full story about that he be he be tell basically i think people have enough of the emperor of er
S0486	mm
S0523	of be be govern by an emperor
S0486	mm
S0523	who be so detach from the people erm that he be he be kinda give the boot and he go to work at er be erm a kind of emperor
S0486	mm
S0523	er for the deadly rival the biggest rival to china japan
S0486	mm right
S0523	japan be er japan to chinese be probably a bite like erm or certainly be in the past er like the nazis be to erm to to the british erm absolutely sort of kinda i i think they're still still er not very comfortable existence erm but erm er but anyway he the the emperor go to work for for for in about nineteen twenties go to work for japan which be not a good idea
S0486	right
S0523	and then he come back and erm and he be a gardener
S0486	right
S0523	he they make him into a gardener and he write a
S0486	good heavens
S0523	and he write a book and in fact there's a film
S0486	mm mm
S0523	erm i go i go to see it years well probably about twenty years ago it be call the last emperor and i think it be by a famous
S0486	oh yes
S0523	er director it can't remember it get a lot erm a lot of er things but it it it tell the story of the last days of the emperor
S0486	right
S0523	erm how he grow up in you know the magnificence of it
S0486	luxury yeah
S0523	but end his life as a gardener he write his book and he say he be never more happy than when he be a gardener
S0523	and or something like
S0486	well that say a lot doesn't it
S0523	yeah yeah that say a lot and i i think erm but er and and there's erm and i i ask someone who what's happen to the family erm and er it's it it er we you can't always you always don't know what the full truth be
S0486	mm
S0523	but what they say be that most of the yeah most of the family or all the family still exist in some shape or form but a lot of them have become artists
S0486	oh right
S0523	and erm on board our our our our cruise ship there be a erm a chap who erm purportedly be relate to er the the erm the emperor's family
S0486	mm
S0523	er and now he's a an artist sort of sell his
S0486	right
S0523	war etcetera but he he be quite a good artist actually erm but clearly that be much more acceptable than erm you know any kind of revolutionary
S0486	i be gonna say
S0523	activity erm anyway we go go round the the the forbid city you know it's forbid city it be only it be only allow reason it's forbid be that only the emperor and his immediate family could go in there basically erm and er you can see it it's it's it's in a way when you look at a national trust property
S0486	mm
S0523	a lot of them you see how people use to live and
S0486	mm
S0523	in in these in these place erm it's very decorative outside and and and a lot of this a lot of lot of money and expense have be
S0486	mm
S0523	er put to this but bear in mind erm it's because they've get so much er how many people
S0486	mm
S0523	they probably it probably doesn't cost them as much to do this as but still there's a lot of skill
S0486	mm
S0523	to to er refurbish and everything erm
S0486	so they're not so
S0523	but they but the inside
S0486	not so ornate
S0523	they they they they're very ornate inside but they haven't get
S0486	yeah
S0523	it it strike me as they they haven't get the sort of creature comfort as you have in a say national trust property but that might be because of the erm erm that's the way use to live perhaps
S0486	well
S0523	very minimalist
S0486	yes oh and also
S0523	mm
S0486	erm they would have lot and lot of lowly people bring in food and things to them wouldn't they
S0523	yeah yeah
S0486	rather than actually
S0523	yeah
S0486	you could see this stave and where they be cook and all that sort of thing
S0523	yeah
S0486	erm possibly not
S0523	yeah i mean that's that a the the emperor er er lot and lot of build and this be one of the the emperor's
S0486	throne
S0523	er throne there and you can see it's empty you see the throne there it's empty
S0486	oh yeah
S0523	and you you you you you you feel there must've be er table chair erm nice ornament
S0486	yeah
S0523	and those be the things that over the years since the red army
S0486	yeah
S0523	the red army for example do erm erm break up destroy
S0486	yeah
S0523	er because they they saw it as erm erm you know against the ethos of the red er of the cultural revolution
S0486	how many people be in your party
S0523	er thirty nine
S0486	oh it's a big crowd isn't it
S0523	yeah yeah so it's erm
S0486	they be all alright
S0523	yeah a very good group actually
S0486	yeah
S0523	very good group very very good group see you can see the sort of pagodas picture take some picture of er some er be that our oh yes we erm on on the second day we have a bite of free time so we wander down myself and wonder down to the local shop
S0486	mm

S0486	if you want to take home a little erm memento erm you wouldn't be pay two hundred pound for it would you
S0523	no no no no no we go to a on one night we go erm a a second night i think we be there we go to a show erm in er beijing which be er very interest they have erm it be erm a sort of local it it be a kung fu show
S0486	oh really
S0523	and it be about the history of how the erm the the there's a very tradition about kung fu and
S0486	yes
S0523	and and fight and how that

S0486	mm
S0523	what's that oh and then then we after that we go to there's there's they they they love their animals i think that's a some kind of snail or something
S0486	oh right

S0523	yeah and and above that be the er i think it's the one of the key emperor's kind of tombs and it
S0486	right
S0523	it's probably about fifteen hundred fifteen hundred i should think and we go down here it be a a a very nice walkway all the way through
S0486	look at an avenue of tree now
S0523	yeah it's like with with the with the various animals
S0486	oh i see
S0523	on on on either side
S0486	it's a sculpture park yes
S0523	there's elephant elephant
S0486	i see
S0523	and the the all the tombs of the emperors that be call i can't remember what they're call erm
S0486	mm
S0523	valley of the emperors or something but
S0486	yeah
S0523	it all the in this erm in in these er in this area all the emperors from of of of several dynasties
S0486	right
S0523	and there's there's this chap here be represent a high official erm and then you have the elephant represent something else
S0486	mm
S0523	all the animals represent different things
S0486	yes yeah
S0523	how we do for time be we
S0486	well we're alright we've erm if we could go on for another few minutes we'll reach an hour so
S0523	okay
S0486	won't be too bad today
S0523	so i'll i'll just quickly flash through these
S0486	so erm oh there's a new group of canoers back now
S0523	yeah
S0486	my goodness yeah they're all different i think
S0523	this be when we go to the great wall
S0486	right
S0523	and we go along the wall down and we go up over here as er there's there's me and we we obviously it's such a big wall we can't couldn't cover very much in it but it's very steep and
S0486	yes
S0523	very very steep in place but we we do a you know a nice bite for a
S0486	mm
S0523	morning and then we we come back er look at quite a few we've get to we we're gonna have to do a lot of edit on these yes that's a picture how steep it be
S0486	oh gosh it be steep
S0523	er yeah erm but er they have they have erm there's lot of wall that's not that's not repair very much
S0486	yes
S0523	er but but in where erm where the tourists go they've put erm er what you call it erm
S0486	rail
S0523	rail there because you need rail to but but a lot of it be alright but some a lot of it be oh yeah well that that actually be call i think it's call the bread basket and it's where the olympics or the erm be hold erm
S0486	oh right yes
S0523	er where they they have all the big athletics
S0486	yes
S0523	er events that's our that's our typical room there
S0486	right look very nice
S0523	er yeah yeah oh yes we the light be we we it this'll probably look better on a bigger screen but the light in er just probably er will erm this be quite amaze this be in a place call shan and this be a shop centre but you wouldn't guess this it's a imagine shop on either side
S0486	yeah
S0523	and this be the ceiling
S0486	right
S0523	and it and and it and this these be light change they they love their neon light
S0486	right
S0523	so they're the light be change all the time it's quite quite oh and also this be where they erm because they've get such high rise build
S0486	mm mm
S0523	and they haven't get space erm to do activities
S0486	yeah
S0523	a lot of the activities be do in the erm
S0486	park and public space yeah
S0523	in park so so these ladies get together every night or whenever erm in this space and erm
S0486	they're do tai chi
S0523	tai tai chi or just keep fit
S0486	yeah yeah
S0523	erm yeah it's quite something to watch and then these pillars here be erm again it's neon light and it they they they change colour it it it's difficult to can see it's it's a whole whole pillar go up i dunno twenty twenty five
S0486	yeah
S0523	and and they it it's just change colour all the time it'd be better in a
S0486	oh right
S0523	in a in a video but it's it be quite something so you can see all the different colour
S0486	yeah some beautiful colour
S0523	yeah they're it's all you know it's all electronic and all that sort of thing but the statues here that they've create be be very artistic and erm they're very erm then we go to erm a water a a water symphony
S0486	right
S0523	where basically you have lot of erm waterfalls
S0486	yes
S0523	water jet and change colour and then they have music to go with the
S0486	oh lovely
S0523	it's really quite quite impressive you know it's erm
S0486	be there even entertainments you have to buy ticket for or be that just there anyway
S0523	er that be there you just
S0486	mm
S0523	turn it we er the the the coach just take us there and
S0486	right
S0523	drop us off and then we just erm er yeah it's it's it's very good you can see all the it's erm some people they have security there because some people the some of the youngsters want to dash between the the the the jet
S0486	right
S0523	but the the security people just didn't want them to do that
S0486	no
S0523	cos i imagine it's health and safety as well actually but it's all the you know the light the the the light be quite
S0486	yeah
S0523	quite lot of neon and yes
S0486	oh you can stand in a terracotta army uniform and have your photograph take
S0486	that's amaze
S0523	yeah i didn't think i i perhaps er it be funny the but the what they be do here it be it be a bite of a sell but
S0486	mm
S0523	it be basically erm how er you could you could how the terracotta army people be make
S0486	yes
S0523	and and what you realise be just how much skill
S0486	yeah
S0523	go into just make one terracotta army
S0486	yeah
S0523	and then of course you've get the the terracotta army this be the ovens that they they use quite basic really and these be the the individual components that that go and then you could buy you know typically erm small terracotta army figure to to take back
S0486	yeah
S0523	the head er and all that and all and then you have these sort of work of art you can see that like that it's really
S0486	oh yes yeah
S0523	be these no actually these be look look at that knackered table
S0486	oh yes
S0523	and what what they find be be when they've dig dig open some of these tombs and things they've find lacquer erm the the technique of lacquer go back erm oh you know a lot longer than anyone
S0486	yes
S0523	think before and then and then there's the terracotta army people
S0486	it's incredible that every
S0523	mm
S0486	single face on the terracotta army be different isn't it
S0523	yes yes absolutely yeah it be
S0486	the
S0523	it
S0486	work that go into it
S0523	yeah erm the the the thing though that that that i couldn't quite quite grapple with be the the slightly macabre side so basically they they be arrange in the regiment so you have different regiment
S0486	yeah
S0523	and then you have the central control place
S0486	yeah
S0523	er so you the command and control where the general be it be it be a complete army underground er which you probably read about but erm he also erm for his er he didn't want to be without his erm his concubines in his his later life
S0486	yeah
S0523	so he he bury them alive underneath
S0486	oh dear
S0523	yeah yeah yeah so erm just didn't like didn't didn't couldn't the the think
S0486	that must've be terrify can you imagine the night before you know you be go to be bury alive
S0523	it it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i could only imagine that erm they be obviously they be bury with soldier who have erm real er real er er real erm er what do you call it real swords and real this and real that
S0486	yeah
S0523	so so erm it's either that or they they you know they take poison or whatever who who know but
S0486	right right
S0523	but but the they they just close the door and seal it up and that's what they do with all these and what's also interest be that they they they this be only just a small a relatively small proportion
S0486	right
S0523	of the whole thing
S0486	right
S0523	so what they're say be be erm they won't erm develop it further erm until they have the technology because once they open the tomb the air get in
S0486	yeah
S0523	and and and and some of these things collapse
S0486	yeah
S0523	so erm er you can see all these these be what they're work on at the moment erm you can see they're quite large figure er and but you can see things have collapse
S0486	oh right
S0523	because they have big wooden things strut go past
S0486	right
S0523	but as they've open things the oxygen's get in and the whole thing's collapse so
S0486	right
S0523	so the what they're do and and maybe it's maybe a cost
S0486	right
S0523	control thing be they're wait until erm the technology be there and then they'll open it up and these be erm these be highly these be take from the erm er the pit as they're call
