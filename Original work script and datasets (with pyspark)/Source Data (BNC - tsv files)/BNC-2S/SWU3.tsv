S0144	for an hour
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's alright innit
S0024	yeah i think it's alright
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	huh
S0024	apparently that hall be quite cheap to
S0144	be it
S0024	to rent out
S0144	yeah er cos go to the library to see how much it'd cost to hire out that for that little room for teach
S0024	yeah
S0144	how much can you remember
S0024	well it be stupid it be like
S0144	about forty pound an hour or something
S0024	yeah i know
S0024	how's she suppose to make any money
S0144	yeah
S0024	she'd have to have and there's not even enough room in there to have a class
S0144	it's a tiny little room
S0024	ridiculous
S0144	she didn't even have a board or anything
S0024	no
S0144	how can they ask forty quid
S0024	i don't know it's a library they should be for free
S0144	they should be it's a load of bollocks
S0024	they're gonna close down other libraries though they're gonna make as much noise as they can i suppose
S0144	yeah right you're blue i'll be yellow right okay so you've go there
S0024	they just have to make as much money mm as they can but it's
S0144	yeah
S0024	just ridiculous because if people can't rent out the room to um i don't know to do something with then silly ain't it
S0144	yeah huh
S0024	but it's like welbourne hall basically do you know how cheap that be
S0144	no
S0024	i didn't realize how cheap that be cos like mum and dad be say we could have our wed there but i wouldn't like that whole atmosphere but it's really cheap for the whole day especially if you're resident
S0144	how much be that then
S0024	i've forget now
S0144	yeah
S0024	it be ridiculously cheap
S0144	yeah
S0024	it be like i don't know twenty pound for the whole day and night or something it be
S0024	you've get all the chair and everything
S0144	wow
S0024	like you can that's why
S0144	twenty pound
S0024	well that's what they say when dad have his party but dad's part of the board
S0144	yeah
S0024	i reckon they just do
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	they wouldn't do it for that cheap for me
S0144	well you're family aren't you
S0024	mm win win
S0144	yeah my dad be say that as well
S0024	yeah if you're resident or like
S0144	well
S0024	your hall be cheap
S0144	no dad be say that um if you hire out just a normal hall if you get the bar as well then obviously cos you'll be spend an absolute fortune at the bar a lot of the place give you the hall for free
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	but
S0024	so that's why it would have be quite good i suppose to do that for our wed but
S0144	yeah well i'm glad we didn't really i don't really want that kind of atmosphere
S0024	no i don't want that atmosphere
S0144	anyway
S0024	it's
S0144	you know stick in a hall mm

S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah or er it's a shame ain't it i jump on that road yeah it's a real shame
S0144	i don't mind the drink but it's the huh it's the excess and it's the the pressure i don't it's it's riduculous
S0024	yeah it be you can't go out for like a nice
S0144	no but it's it's
S0024	well you can though with some people it's
S0144	you can
S0024	the people we've be hang out with that's why
S0144	well yeah but also it's like me as well like it's so ingrain in me like real deep down
S0024	you can't stop
S0144	that i you know thirty four and i still don't know when to stop drink
S0024	yeah
S0144	and that's like
S0024	you need to figure it out well er me as well
S0144	but i like
S0024	i'm get better i be get
S0144	yeah
S0024	i can feel myself get better cos i i stop and say no i i'll i'll just have a lime and soda this round
S0144	yeah yeah yeah but no other no other country's like this
S0024	no
S0144	it's it's i don't know what it be
S0024	no it's not er four no nowhere else i mean i use to love the bite in vietnam where we use to just where you drink and then between every drink you have to have a glass of water and it's like
S0144	yeah
S0024	part of the whole thing
S0144	mhm
S0024	and then and then you have all that fruit and you don't really go out and in in korea as well you have even though you drink lot of beer there they always have um the they always have like snack on the table and stuff
S0144	yeah
S0024	even though it be popcorn or something rubbish like that
S0144	well they do like drink though
S0024	yeah but they have the popcorn to kind of try and soak it up a bite i dunno
S0144	mm
S0024	it be a bite huh
S0144	well yeah and you and eat out be such a big part of the culture
S0024	yeah
S0144	that you wouldn't just go out
S0024	i'll jump upon that one
S0144	for a drink really would you you would go out for a meal as well it would kinda go together

S0144	mm
S0024	but hm i dunno it's it's still hm hard i don't know
S0144	mm
S0024	there's a long way to go yet i mean people at the only reason people have stop drink so much be cos it cost so much money that's the only reason really i mean the rest of it
S0144	well you know but that's why these all these ales have appear in the supermarkets now it's because people be drink at home they've take the pubs to the house now
S0024	yeah i know
S0144	haven't they
S0024	well that mean that's all the pubs that be gonna close
S0144	well that's why they've all turn into restaurants
