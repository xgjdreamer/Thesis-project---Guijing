S0618	no that's true it's like two quid
S0619	it's probably pay off an expensive blender or something
S0618	it's probably pay for the person that then have to spend three and a half hours carrots out of a juicer

S0618	mm i mean nice enough but
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah mm cheer
S0619	cheer
S0618	so that's a bite of a bore audio i'm just think so far
S0619	i know
S0618	look at a menu
S0619	we've just look at the menu
S0618	so let's be really entertain
S0619	and how do you propose we do that
S0618	mm erm right discussion topic so how do you
S0619	have too much to say the other day i think it's cos we drink so much coffee
S0618	i know well we're about to start another coffee so that should get a wibble on in the meantime let's have a little er do you know i think part of what the issue be be with me and you i think we're quite similar in many regard
S0619	mm
S0618	and we hold very similar view in many regard so there's not a lot of conflict there's just quite a lot of yeah i know
S0619	yes and er oh i know and also
S0618	yeah i know
S0619	i think we be very similar and hold similar view and we're both quite open to sort of
S0618	mm
S0619	not necessarily agree with but accept or listen to
S0618	yeah
S0619	other view erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	so there isn't a lot of sort of discussion to be have cos like
S0618	yeah
S0619	well we agree
S0618	i know yeah
S0619	good
S0618	i suppose i'm i'm think
S0618	about erm speak lessons and the discussion elements of
S0619	mm
S0618	you know give your opinion and then you know respond to that opinion and give your opinion respond to that opinion so you know from that viewpoint i guess in a classroom situation you're more likely to get students who hold different view and who disagree
S0619	yeah
S0618	erm if you can find a teenager that have an opinion that be of course erm
S0619	mm and sometimes you've get to give them an opinion
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	whether they agree with it or not and come up for with reason for
S0618	yeah
S0619	which i don't fundamentally agree with because i think you know you're learn english to express yourself
S0618	mm
S0619	not to express someone else's view
S0618	yeah
S0619	but through the medium of english
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know mm
S0618	yeah but it can be useful sometimes in a you know to have a role play and say okay you lot believe this and you lot believe this
S0619	mm
S0618	discuss in your group you know why you er think this way and then
S0619	yeah
S0618	people off to have a discussion a debate an argument a disagreement a whatever but yeah no
S0618	it be interest be out with erm
S0619	yes no yeah
S0618	er yeah but no but yeah but no but it be interest be out with erm and yesterday and be your typical anti refugee anti immigrant racist polish person just to put her in
S0619	mm
S0618	her little box erm and really isn't and it be so funny how both and neither of whom post on facebook a great deal have obviously post something several months ago
S0619	mm
S0618	that the other one notice
S0619	mm
S0618	and think oh that's counter to my political beliefs erm so these two guy it be kind of interest for me witness the conversation that go on between them erm with basically say i can't believe you've remember that small thing i like or comment on
S0619	mm
S0618	six months ago on facebook and you've retain that information to talk to me about it now and then there be something that have say or like and remember that so it obviously sort of prickle with both
S0619	mm
S0618	of them that they have very different political view and we end up sort of have the group conversation about how because we're grow up we can still maintain a friendship with people
S0619	mm
S0618	who feel differently to how we feel and you know almost not throw the baby out with the bathwater
S0619	mm
S0618	because there be other aspects of our friendship erm or aspects of that
S0619	mm
S0618	person's personality that we do like and do engage with
S0619	mm
S0618	so i be almost have to sit in between them
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	erm and steer the conversation away from immigration and 's very well aware of my feel because we have a
S0619	mm
S0618	bite of a debate erm before i stay with her on my way to poland in september
S0619	uhu
S0618	and she note that the other english native who'd be on the celta course have unfriended her on facebook erm
S0619	oh you know i be
S0618	because of her view
S0619	uhu so in term of like unfriending people because of their view on facebook
S0618	mm
S0619	it depend on my relationship with that person
S0618	yeah
S0619	if it be a very close person or close friend i would sort of not look past it but i wouldn't unfriend them
S0618	mm
S0619	whereas if it's someone that i work with three years ago or go to school with
S0618	yeah
S0619	i'm just like fuck off
S0618	fuck off fair enough
S0619	but that's how you know you get this impression that and we've talk about this before that impression where everyone have the same political view as you
S0618	mm
S0619	and you can't believe that there's like a conservative government
S0618	yeah i know who vote for them
S0619	because it's like i don't know anyone
S0618	oh my family
S0619	but i don't
S0618	yeah
S0619	a lot of these people be my friends
S0618	yeah
S0619	how can this've happen erm so yeah in that sense i just cast aside er anyone whose political er opinions i don't agree with
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know if that's right or wrong er but i read an
S0618	that's right for you the moment
S0619	interest quote that say how it be something like how can you class er a foetus as a person
S0618	mm
S0619	but not a refugee child
S0618	mm good question
S0619	yes how can you want one thing in your country but not another
S0618	mm
S0619	a thing that be already an actual human be
S0618	that's a very valid question in poland
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm exactly that's what i mean
S0619	and er it say something like you need to you you must stop pretend that this be about your religion
S0618	mm mm yeah
S0619	erm it be
S0618	i be reflect on when we saw the anti abortion campaign
S0619	and er when we sort of scream in her face
S0618	we both nearly rip their head off
S0618	so funny
S0619	ah get away from me
S0618	yeah
S0619	apart from sort of run at them and push them over
S0618	i know
S0619	i don't know how we could have make it more clear
S0618	no and er
S0619	other than sort of me stand up and
S0618	i know i do wonder as well you know about go back a bite later with my little you know pro choice
S0619	yeah
S0618	placard or something
S0618	just to i dunno offer people an alternative
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	it be interest the police be there though which would tend to suggest that they do have
S0619	they might have some
S0618	yeah
S0619	opposition
S0618	yeah which be great i bloody hope so
S0619	yeah er but from who
S0619	who be these people
S0618	mm i don't know erm actually be say she have a private student from erm er a woman who live in the country
S0619	mm
S0618	who she go out to on the tram erm and teach english to and this woman apparently be ultra ultra conservative
S0619	uhu
S0618	and also 's facebook friend and have put some pro gay marriage campaign thing or change
S0619	yeah the rainbow picture
S0618	oh that's what it be yeah she put the rainbow picture on in support of the american supreme court
S0619	mm
S0618	erm say yes gay marriage across the country or marriage for whoever want it across the country and her student pick her up on that and start quiz her on her own beliefs erm and say look i'm your teacher i'm here to talk with you about english but those personal issue be not up for conversation because she think if she carry it on she would lose a student
S0619	mm a student yeah
S0618	and lose that income erm which may not've be a huge deal for her but she would rather have the money
S0619	mm
S0618	and just talk about more banal things
S0619	yeah
S0618	and save her political discussions
S0619	yeah
S0618	for friends and people she have a different sort of relationship with
S0619	i sort of erm i don't like this school rule of you can't talk about politics gender sex religion
S0618	mm
S0619	but at the same time
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's er it's kind of safeguard me because i just go
S0618	yeah
S0619	oh sorry can't talk about that
S0618	yeah
S0619	sometimes i go er okay in order to to talk about this i have to explain that i have a contract er that say that i won't talk about it erm if you feel offend you must tell me to stop talk and i'll stop and i sort of
S0618	fair enough
S0619	i sort of bring it up like that
S0618	yeah
S0619	you be aware that i have sign this contract but we're have this conversation because you know
S0618	you be happy to
S0619	yeah because
S0618	yeah fair enough
S0619	i've say that it's okay
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i sort of rely on it sometimes and go right i'm not allow to talk about it so you're not allow to talk about it
S0618	so shut up you racist bastard
S0619	so shut up you
S0619	absolute arsehole
S0619	this be the person who i try to get throw out of the class and the school
S0618	yeah well i don't think you're gonna succeed there
S0619	er yeah
S0618	cos it seem the school be more about the money than about their teachers
S0619	the money than about sort of yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	me not want someone who against
S0618	although you'd think with their hugely high turnover of natives they might at least
S0619	yeah
S0618	do what they can to safeguard them
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	and try to keep them
S0619	so i think that's
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know it's a good and a bad thing
S0618	mm
S0619	and in the court i've say right there be this contract but because you know
S0618	mm
S0619	you know you're
S0618	i've find the court be fine
S0619	you're grow up and you're very intelligent people and
S0618	mm
S0619	in a class there be extremes there be people who be go i be pro this i be pro that and people go what how could you possibly say that
S0619	anyway what how can you possibly say that you're a lawyer
S0618	yep yep
S0619	i'm not say if you're a lawyer you're not entitle to your own opinions
S0618	yeah
S0619	but you're a lawyer you have to have an open mind
S0618	you have to be more balance yeah
S0619	yeah erm so i just
S0618	mm
S0619	it's an interest er it's an interest one and i i don't know do all workplaces have these kind of contract where you shouldn't talk about x y z er
S0618	in northern ireland yes
S0619	uhu
S0618	but you know they've only just stop kill each other
S0619	yeah
S0618	fairly recently well for the most part
S0619	so i don't know
S0618	so yeah
S0619	at first i sort of really resent this rule but
S0618	mm
S0619	it's useful depend on the er group that you're with
S0618	yeah that's true and i think you know if you're make it clear to your students that you're not allow to talk about it so if they want you to stop just say stop then
S0619	mm
S0618	you know i think that's fair enough i i have some great conversations with my judge erm and
S0619	yeah
S0618	and just like you i figure they're er grow up they're intelligent they've get their own view erm and it be helpful to me to be able to have speak class about issue that they felt passionate about so great
S0619	mm
S0618	so we do
S0619	yeah
S0618	god why do people breed
S0618	jesus shut up
S0619	it absolutely have to happen i'm afraid
S0618	that noise go through me a cry cat or a kitten i be no problem
S0619	uhu
S0618	a cry baby just oh
S0619	i know
S0618	go right through me
S0619	i know i know
S0618	mm
S0619	erm so yes i really sort of appreciate the court but at the same time
S0618	mm
S0619	i don't like to push it too far
S0618	mm
S0619	erm and if i can stay in a sort of safer zone
S0618	mm
S0619	the most interest conversation i have in the court actually be about give money to homeless people
S0618	ah
S0619	erm it's er something like give spare change to homeless people be a waste of money er what do you think and that be really interest and i find out so much about sort of polish society and
S0618	mm
S0619	attitudes towards er extreme poverty have i tell you this before
S0618	no you haven't how interest tell me more
S0619	and you know there be people in who if you sort of live not in the countryside but if you live in a house sort of in the suburbs or er towards the countryside in one of these villages
S0618	mm
S0619	erm there will be a homeless person who come and knock on your door
S0618	ah
S0619	erm and you know er ask for food not ask for money but ask for food
S0618	right
S0619	but actually ask for money er
S0618	mm
S0619	you know and there've be case where you've prepare a sandwich and give it to them and then when you've take the dog out for a walk the sandwich be you know in the bin erm
S0618	mm
S0619	but people who have give food to this person so at that time the next week they've come round because they think you'll be in so this you know one of my students say that it's be happen for like six months the same man come at the same time and sometimes if they're go out they'll just leave a package on the doorstep
S0618	oh wow
S0619	and now they're get to the stage where they're they just can't stop cos
S0618	mm
S0619	they don't know what the sort of repercussions will be be will there be repercussions if they stop erm
S0618	oh so they're give through fear rather than through love
S0619	yeah now yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm at the begin i think they you know they they be try to be good people and now it's sort of continue and continue
S0618	mm
S0619	and they feel like they can't stop cos they don't know what will happen if they do and i just think and they be like well er i be like that's so extraordinary for me that people would come and knock on the door
S0618	mm
S0619	and er they say what would happen in england and i think and i just say well i think people would probably phone the police if someone come and come and knock on the door
S0618	mm
S0619	and er would phone a charity and say can you come and you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	er er do something can you sort of collect this person i think people would it just would never ever happen it's sort of an invasion of your
S0618	happen regularly when i be little
S0619	invasion of privacy
S0618	mm
S0619	i suppose in some way
S0618	yeah i er i have traveller families
S0619	and i think people
S0618	come round
S0619	uhu
S0618	and it be usually in the summer erm ask for scrap metal
S0619	mm mm yeah
S0618	so my dad always keep a few bits in the shed erm
S0619	yeah
S0618	to give to them and
S0619	not like that but we have a man who use to come round and ask to sharpen the knives
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	but it be er you know if i be home alone in the summer holiday
S0618	mm
S0619	i'd be like no
S0618	mm
S0619	no no strange man
S0618	yeah
S0619	you shan't er sharpen the knives
S0618	yeah we have those guy too yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	scrap metal and knife sharpeners and in northern ireland even now erm in and not with any routine regularity frequency anything
S0619	uhu
S0618	erm but my mother in law will always keep a small bag of clothe by the door
S0619	right
S0618	so if she have traveller families knock on the door
S0619	mm
S0618	and say can you spare anything she always give clothe
S0619	uhu
S0618	erm
S0619	right
S0618	yeah and that might happen once or twice a year maybe
S0619	i've just never know it yeah and i think especially where i live grow up no one ever knock on the door apart from the man sharpen knives
S0618	mm
S0619	he be often
S0618	how often be he round
S0619	er probably once or twice a year but
S0618	yeah
S0619	it be in summer
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm but no we have like no trick or treaters no jehovah's witness no one ever come to the door
S0618	wow
S0619	live in the countryside so you just have to
S0618	yeah
S0619	you'd have to really be arsed
S0618	use to get all of that
S0619	erm and i don't know whether it'll be worse if you live in a city centre but i suppose in a city centre there's lot of people a don't have a lot of money or live in apartments
S0618	mm
S0619	erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	i be i'm just think about in central there's sort of areas of people with a lot of money who live in who live in flats
S0618	mm
S0619	and you wouldn't sort of erm you you know answer the door or ask someone up if they
S0618	yeah
S0619	ring the bell ask for food or money
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and other areas everyone's really poor
S0618	mm
S0619	erm so i don't know whether people would knock on the door anyway don't know
S0618	interest yeah
S0619	but that sort of strike me as that's for me really weird
S0618	really weird yeah i haven't have any of that you know i live in the
S0619	mm
S0618	the sort of rural place that you're talk about i haven't have
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	anybody knock on the door like that but we do have a lot of guy who i think i'm pretty sure be homeless
S0619	mm
S0618	who er live around uhu
S0619	oh
S0619	oh that look
S0618	that look great mm
S0619	er yeah
S0618	so oh very nice
S0619	mm oh
S0618	would you like some bread
S0618	i think maybe you
S0619	you do know how to treat me
S0618	i do i know how to treat a girl and you can have a
S0619	or can er you can dip it in your sauce
S0618	you can dip it in my pesto if you like
S0619	oh
S0618	so oh ladle thing you can have my stick as well that look more like a cheese straw
S0619	pass all your carbs onto me
S0618	i be er
S0619	eat this carby food say i have to eat less carbs
S0618	yeah
S0619	i be like why
S0618	yeah why
S0619	well he say i eat too many and i should replace them with vegetables but i be like well i be really strong and i'm really strong cos i eat so many carbs
S0618	mm
S0619	so if i eat less carbs i won't be as strong
S0618	mm
S0619	so
S0618	i dunno i think carbs erm turn to sugar
S0619	mm
S0618	and erm form glucose for energy
S0619	mm
S0618	so they're less about strength more about energy whereas protein amino acid's more about build muscle strength
S0619	mm no energy well i suppose the energy to do the lift
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm whereas my previous trainer be just like no you're not eat enough you need to eat at least another sort of packet of rice on top of that
S0618	mm
S0619	and i be like
S0619	explode so i don't know
S0618	well i suppose there's carbs and there's carbs
S0619	yeah but he's
S0618	potatoes be a bite shit but
S0619	potatoes be shit and and rice be good and potatoes be shit
S0618	oatcakes or oats be really good
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	so i think i'm gonna sort of cut back a little bite which be really depress
S0618	do you wanna stick thing
S0619	no
S0618	no neither do i do you want some bread and a dip you're very welcome
S0619	er yes
S0618	it look good
S0619	it do look good
S0618	i love homemade pesto it be the best
S0619	that look really erm
S0618	i bet it's full of i bet it's full of garlic as well
S0619	what so you can have salad huh
S0618	so you have to have some so you don't pass out every time i breathe on you
S0619	what's what be you do oh die
S0619	's monologue on the record
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so yeah that be an interest conversation that i have in the court
S0618	mm
S0619	and because i do it with every group that week everyone have their own stories
S0618	mm
S0619	about people knock on doors or things that they'd hear
S0618	wow yeah
S0619	and because it be come up to christmas and it's this tradition that for your christmas meal you have to leave a space at the table
S0618	mm
S0619	in in case someone knock on the door
S0618	oh my goodness
S0619	and i say well what happen if someone knock on the door and they go well no one ever knock on the door i be like yeah but hypothetically
S0618	they could
S0619	if a homeless person knock on the door and say i'm hungry can i eat something would you let them in and they be go
S0618	and
S0619	er and they and they
S0618	er
S0619	it make them really uncomfortable so i be like right
S0618	probably not
S0619	i'll take i'll take your silence as a no
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and they say a famous polish actress sort of disguise herself and go and knock on people's doors and say can i share your table
S0618	mm
S0619	and only one family say yes
S0618	wow
S0619	she have to like knock on a whole street to get someone to say yes
S0618	and that be a woman you can imagine people be a little bite more wary of a man
S0619	uhu a bite funny about a man
S0618	erm but yeah be a woman goodness
S0619	yeah and one of the students say you know erm he give sort of a little bite of food and a little bite of money if er if he sort of do a bite of garden for example
S0618	mm
S0619	erm so i dunno it's an awful it's a weird thing to talk about in a group as well because people you know have beliefs about it
S0618	yeah
S0619	but they don't wanna look like a dick
S0618	yeah
S0619	and other people you know if you if you do things that you think make you a good person you're more likely to talk about it
S0618	yeah
S0619	so it's a er er an it make an awkward dynamic in a way but it's an interest conversation to have
S0618	it really be an interest conversation facebook thing as well about a new i whether it's true or not i don't know a new priest at some new church
S0619	mm
S0618	who dress himself erm to look like he be homeless and lay down on the step of the church
S0619	uhu
S0618	to see if anybody stop or talk to him or say hi how be you or do you need anything do you wanna come in whatever and nobody do and so he then walk into the church they're all wait for their new guy to appear and give the sermon so he walk in as the homeless guy sort of take his homeless guy clothe off as he go
S0619	oh my goodness
S0618	erm go up to the pulpit and
S0619	bollocked them senseless yeah
S0618	yeah yeah yeah but you you know it's the the whole give thing theoretically it's recognise i mean for me personally recognise other as self
S0619	mm
S0618	and want to do what you can for that person like you would want somebody to do for you but
S0619	mm
S0618	at the same time there's so much in the media about fear et cetera or fear base stuff erm that you can really understand why people be reluctant to they're maybe afraid of be attack
S0619	mm
S0618	they're afraid of the person they've invite steal from them hurt them hurt their children
S0619	mm mm
S0618	whatever so you can understand that as well with all of the hype
S0619	mm
S0618	that go on in society and i'm think of another thing as well that be facebook again there be some video about a guy do an experiment just wander round restaurants stop at people's table as people be eat outside and say i'm really hungry can i have a slice of your pizza now i would tell anybody to fuck off
S0619	yeah
S0618	it's my pizza i'm eat leave me in peace and get out of my face and the whole purpose of the video be to try and make people feel guilty about say no
S0619	mm
S0618	and then it be reveal that they be on camera but i think you know no fuck off i'm eat
S0619	uhu yeah it's like someone er you know people who go round table in krakow for example and ask for money
S0618	mm
S0619	you know and if the person next to you say yes then you go oh do i have to say yes because they say yes or do i have to say no because they've already say yes so it's okay
S0618	no
S0619	you know and i think it's you know it's about do it for yourself and your own personal reason and not compare it to other
S0618	yeah
S0619	what the person on the next table be do er it's difficult erm i be on holiday once in bulgaria and we go to sofia and it be there be a lot of there be a lot of poverty and kid would if you be eat outside just come and touch the food on your plate with you know sort of dirty hand
S0618	yeah
S0619	and then because that happen then you go have the food
S0618	yeah
S0619	and that be how they make food
S0618	that's not nice
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm i mean in that situation it's unfortunate that hunger
S0619	mm
S0618	presumably have drive human be to
S0619	mm
S0618	perform an action they surely wouldn't perform
S0619	mm
S0618	if they have enough to eat
S0619	mm mm but at the same time
S0618	that's sad
S0619	yeah it be sad er
S0618	mm
S0619	well that's what these kid do all day every day so er you know who be they feed with all this this food
S0618	yeah
S0619	and they must be sort of get a lot i dunno
S0618	mm i look on money as energy i just touch that bite of white bread touch the brown now erm i look on money as energy and
S0619	mm
S0618	like everything in life i intend an abundance for myself and food money clothe everything i need to survive but i intend an abundance and also intend that i might share that abundance with other people
S0619	mm
S0618	and that doesn't necessarily mean give money to people who be live on the street or whatever erm that might mean you know buy a coffee for a friend once in a while
S0619	mm
S0618	or a meal or a whatever erm but i find i'm kind of conflict about people who live on the street or people who be homeless because in many respect i recognise they've create lack for themselves and have an experience that they're experience and grow from and learn from so if i look at that person as other self and look at us both as an aspect of the divine or an aspect of source or
S0619	mm
S0618	a fragment of all that be call it god if you want i don't like the word god because of its long elderly guy
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	beard sit on a cloud patriarchal overtones but whatever you wanna call it this energy of all that be i look on that self as another self that person as another self and think right okay they're experience lack they've choose that experience to learn erm in this lifetime or whatever and i kind of feel if i give money there's an energetic imbalance there because what do i get in return and it's not that sound really selfish and it be in a way but i like when you say about your student say do a bite of garden for me
S0619	mm
S0618	and i'll give you some food and some money i like that a lot more and i think if i give money without ask for anything in return like a bite of garden for example
S0619	mm
S0618	there's such an energetic imbalance there for me and for that person and i don't quite know how to go about that if i'm go to give money i would much rather give it to a project
S0619	mm
S0618	that work with people to help
S0619	mm mm
S0618	empower people and i'm think about i you know i work with erm in with er it be they're now fabulous project we have a guy come and volunteer and drive our van and he be live at homeless hostel at the time and i really like his style he'd've be a big issue seller erm and be want to give his time as a volunteer
S0619	mm
S0618	and in return of course he get volunteer expense he get his lunch he get tea coffee get friendship companionship he become a really good friend of mine for a number of years and we also have a homeless project have a rent deposit scheme erm and that's the sort of project i wouldn't mind give money to
S0619	mm
S0618	because it then help people to improve their life and live condition
S0619	yeah sort of improve the sort of circle i suppose
S0618	yeah
S0619	uhu
S0618	mm but equally i'd hate to see somebody hungry
S0619	my erm student be tell me another student another judge erm
S0618	she say with her mouth full
S0618	mm
S0619	er this other this judge be tell me a story once and er and a man have approach her in a supermarket car park and say oh can i come into the shop and can you buy some things for me and she be like right okay fine whatever er so he take a basket and sort of fill his basket with things and she get to the obviously
S0618	oh my god
S0619	they've get load of money cos they're judge
S0618	yeah
S0619	er so you know she be like it's not really a problem but it be sort of the way he go about it that i think be quite unusual
S0618	yeah
S0619	and you know erm it wasn't sort of take what you what he really need but it be just sort of
S0618	mm
S0619	really erm you know and she she say people be look at me in the queue as though this be like my dirty horrible husband
S0618	oh
S0619	who'd like follow me round the supermarket
S0619	so when she get to the cashier she be like oh i've just forget some milk can you go and get me the milk er er you know er just to sort of make it sort of less awkward for her i suppose erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	but yeah that be er it just that wouldn't i just can't imagine that ever happen
S0618	yeah i would find that quite passive aggressive well
S0619	mm
S0618	more more aggressive than passive actually and i think i would say fuck off to that as well
S0619	mm it have to be your own choice
S0618	mm and be
S0619	and i'm more than happy to sort of buy sandwich or whatever for people and i've do that in the past
S0618	yeah
S0619	here i've buy you a sandwich whatever erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	but if someone's say oh can i sort of come round the supermarket with you and you just sort of
S0618	no
S0619	buy me a basket of things i'd be like no
S0618	no and again
S0618	you know do it inspire love or do it inspire fear
S0619	uhu
S0618	and in that situation i might be afraid that if i say no they're go to hurt me in some way
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	and so that's really poor motivation for me to do anything yeah i dunno it's tricky i do feel erm you know again on an energetic level and this might come across as really condescend i don't mean it to at all but when i do see people who be beg for money i think erm well i do this ah strange tree hug hippie that i be there's a thing call word you know in the begin there be the word erm and i word through other people so i say in my mind i be word through this one before me which basically
S0619	mm
S0618	acknowledge it's a bite like a namaste it acknowledge the presence
S0619	mm
S0618	the existence of this human be that's in front of me and recognise and er and acknowledge the equality that exist between us
S0619	mm
S0618	erm so i will do that quite a lot erm when i see people in that situation generally won't give money and i always project erm kind of this pink light or energy of love and wish and intend the highest and best outcome for that person
S0619	mm
S0618	now it might be that in their string of incarnations they've choose this particular lifetime to experience lack experience
S0619	uhu
S0618	suffer to experience whatever it might be in this lifetime they've choose choose to triumph over adversity
S0619	mm
S0618	so whatever it be that they wish for themselves i wish the highest and best for them and i kind of feel that on some level you know from on a purely physical level you think oh you twat what do that do to help alleviate
S0619	mm
S0618	someone's hunger erm but you know i feel that on other level that do the power of good for a lot of people
S0619	mm
S0618	mm and i use to give a lot of money to homeless group when i have er a very good income and i be probably give them fifty quid a month or something to charitable group erm tenner to five different charities and then i realise that i'd forget that that money be leave my bank account at that point i stop because the intention of love behind the give wasn't there
S0619	mm
S0618	it be just happen
S0619	happen without your
S0618	yeah and that then i think well
S0618	it's it's worthless money be just number money be energy and if there's no love intention behind the energy then i need to stop do that and approach it in a different way
S0619	mm
S0618	but it's interest
S0619	interest question well there you go that's how you start a conversation
S0618	mm
S0619	er yeah
S0618	do you want some more help yourself if you like
S0619	no i'm fine thank
S0618	mm
S0619	i'm fine i don't i don't wanna this work
S0618	you what
S0619	i don't wanna do the work i'm panic about it and i haven't even sit at the desk yet
S0618	mm
S0619	it's my least favourite class on mondays the first one
S0618	yeah so prepare that one first
S0619	yeah
S0618	get it out the way
S0619	and like the lessons be easy to knock out at sort of ten a penny but the class just make me feel really uncomfortable
S0618	mm
S0619	mm don't like them
S0618	be this your down the stairs in the basement class
S0619	mm
S0618	i hat teach down there
S0619	yeah i've ask to move but there's no room big enough
S0618	bad vibes man
S0619	remember that time i just don't like them at all like some of them be really nice individually but as a group they're just awful
S0618	mm
S0619	er and there's a lot of strong character in a group of twelve and it's just really difficult erm and i you know they're younger than me and they're like seventeen eighteen but they're
S0618	yeah
S0619	er you know it's er it become less about age at some point or it you know i don't have the authority to sort of battle against twelve eighteen year olds i just don't have it
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	don't have the energy either
S0619	yeah
S0618	sometimes yeah yeah and it's difficult as well once a class dynamic have be establish like that
S0619	mm
S0618	and the stronger people have be you know cast in their roles as it be
S0619	mm and because the room be so shit you can't move them around
S0618	mm
S0619	as half as much as you'd like to and sometimes they're sit in like the worst combinations and to move them too much they'd start get really pissy
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm but the room it shouldn't be use for more than like
S0618	six
S0619	eight or
S0618	mm
S0619	yeah but a full class of sort of big people
S0618	yeah
S0619	be just awful
S0618	that be my least favourite class be in the room next door with the room shape like a horseshoe and every student have their back to the wall and a desk in front of them
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you can't move them about you can't split up well you know i do in the end but you know you can't really split up the troublemakers or move them about
S0619	mm
S0618	to any extent like that and it make a huge
S0619	you can't mingle
S0618	difference huge difference
S0619	and 's like erm well how often do you mingle it's like have you try to mingle twelve people in that room be you fuck kid me where be they suppose to stand
S0618	yeah
S0619	er it's just like well you only need to do one every lesson
S0618	what
S0619	one mingle exercise i'm like
S0618	in an hour and a half
S0619	i be like but where be i suppose to put them
S0618	yeah i use to get them to all come into the middle for erm group debate and what have you and it it take about five minutes to get everybody out and into the middle of the room and i be have to stand in the middle of the horseshoe and pull out desks so they could
S0619	yeah
S0618	come through and then push the desks back again be really cramp and it be sort of easier towards the end of my month
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos we all know each other a little bite better but it be a little bite like invade the personal space of
S0619	yeah
S0618	people you don't know that well
S0619	so my mingle which i've work out actually work okay it's not really mingle but it's sort of move which be make them all stand up and put tuck their chair in
S0618	mm
S0619	move their bag pair them up right and say with your new partner look at these picture on the wall around the room and go sort of clockwise around the room so then
S0618	okay
S0619	they're not mingle with each other but they've get a new partner and they're move around
S0618	and they're move yeah
S0619	and they just do you know like one lap of the classroom and then sit back down
S0618	i know but it shift the energy
S0619	yeah
S0618	so it's good
S0619	and it's that's the only way i can think of do it and when i start do this i do it with every class when they sort of go round erm and i be like ask them afterwards i be like okay so move around what be the what be the positives and negative of you walk around the classroom with your partner to do that activity be it better or worse than if you're just sit sit down and some of them be like oh it's stupid i why do we have to move and some be like actually
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know it liven you up a little bite i suppose
S0618	and they you know kid have probably be at school since seven or eight that morning
S0619	mm
S0618	and be drop off by the time they see you
S0619	mm
S0618	so no harm to get them move as well
S0619	yeah and they have the fuck heater on full blast
S0618	mm
S0619	the windows close so i've just get like the windows open and they're like oh can we close the window i'm like no
S0618	no
S0618	i have that in the room next door as well
S0619	yeah
S0618	i hat that room hat it mm
S0619	yeah
S0618	i get in to observe me for that lesson and the feedback be really shit but it's a shit lesson and you know i do take responsibility for it but i think that be my hardest class because of the physical environment
S0619	mm
S0618	and actually that be my upper intermediate and i teach that lesson four time a week and the other three time be a joy in comparison
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so it wasn't necessarily my prep erm but yeah it's delivery and deal with especially unresponsive students and i think the environment have a lot to do with that
S0619	mm yeah

S0619	yes
S0619	it's like if er you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	you can't er and sometimes i'm quite sort of cruel and i go you can't be like that in the exam this be an exam prep course
S0618	yep
S0619	sort it out sort it out bloody idiots
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't get pay enough to deal with all of this shit

S0619	doesn't have to be true just make it up
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	and then i sort of whack out right well you can say this this this this and this and they're like oh i didn't even think of that i'm like no cos you can't think

S0619	the holiday
S0619	oh god inspire no

S0619	i suppose like most sort of i think part of it be i just can't remember what i be like when i be fifteen sixteen
S0618	mm
S0619	seventeen would i have be able to have opinions on the things that i make them have opinions about what would i have say as a native it's not even about language but what would i have say
S0618	yeah
S0619	to these question at the time
S0618	mm
S0619	and i think be i ask too much of them and i'm go no i'm only ask sort of to the level of the exam
S0618	mm
S0619	and to the level of things they may need to be able to talk about
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm they've gotta grow up they've gotta mature
S0618	yeah
S0619	they've get to be able to do all of these skills
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm but i just you know cos i'm sort of really heavily critical of some of them but then i think could i have do any better
S0618	yeah well i dunno it i i think you know with question like for example tell me about the last film you saw
S0619	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0618	everybody have get to be able to answer that question er you don't necessarily have to give a view on whether you like it or didn't like it you could just state facts of who be in it
S0619	mm
S0618	what it be about how it begin what the middle be like how it end you know
S0619	mm
S0618	you can come up with something even if you don't want to have an opinion
S0619	mm mm
S0618	you can come up with facts about it erm
S0619	yeah this thirteen year old girl who's your favourite teacher i don't know

S0619	jesus lord
S0618	me now
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh well
S0619	but you know some of these with the advance class i really sort of push er really sort of push them in term of
S0618	good
S0619	things that they have to talk about i don't think they like it
S0618	good
S0619	but i sort of pitch it a little bite harder than the exam front erm some sometimes sometimes sometimes pitch it a bite harder than the exam so that er you know the speak bite should be a little bite easier i suppose
S0618	should be easier yeah not listen they tend to struggle with on the exam
S0619	no not really on
S0618	which one be it that consistently score lower than
S0619	er use of english and write
S0618	write mm
S0619	they score low on write because they get score they score so highly when you mark it i don't know i just try and match whatever the polish teacher
S0618	mm
S0619	put as the mark
S0618	fair enough mm
S0619	i don't know i don't wanna be see
S0618	yeah
S0619	like see as too critical
S0618	from my viewpoint which i can be completely honest about now i'm not employ by a school i set very few write task because i didn't get pay for mark them
S0619	mm i know and it's hours
S0618	yeah it's heavy
S0619	i've get however many exam students
S0618	mm
S0619	forty
S0618	jeez yeah
S0619	that's forty piece of write like a week
S0618	yeah just try to remember what i have
S0619	you should be about the same like four
S0618	i have yeah
S0619	four fce and a proficiency
S0618	i think i have sixty
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah yeah five lot of twelve sixty yeah
S0619	horrible
S0618	and there be one time i do all of my fces i set a write task and i think i think at that point never again
S0619	mm
S0618	or whatever i can get away with i think they be write
S0619	mm
S0618	an email to er apply for a job as a lifeguard or something like that yeah really because you know i want to do my best with helpful feedback for every student
S0619	mm
S0618	and that take time you know it take time first of all correct the errors and then work out the common pattern of mistake
S0619	mm
S0618	it's use of article or prepositions or whatever it be and then give some feedback you know work on this or work on that this area be strong yeah that take time to do properly
S0619	mm
S0618	i could do it quite quickly and do a piss poor job but
S0619	mm
S0618	i didn't want to do that yeah
S0619	i know sometimes i wonder how sort of useful my feedback be but then er at the same time i remember get piece of work back in school and just sort of shove it in my bag look at the mark shove it in my bag not really look at the feedback
S0618	mm
S0619	so i sort of think a lot of them be like that as well not all of them but some of them
S0618	mm
S0619	and i know the ones who aren't gonna give a shit what it say
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm but for some of them i write like a whole page of feedback you know
S0618	yeah cos you know they'll act on it
S0619	yeah sometimes i write more than they do
S0619	er
S0618	yeah
S0619	and one of them be like er you know it's not very helpful to see that much ink on my on my piece of work i be like well write better then
S0618	improve
S0618	do better next time
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm

S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah i wanna be more like that's my challenge this year
S0619	become
S0618	she's just model teacher isn't she
S0619	don't know how she do it
S0618	she's amaze
S0619	don't know how she do it
S0618	i think you meet people in life i use to be one of them who decide well if i'm go to do this i'm go to be exceptional at it
S0619	mm
S0618	and be the very best i possibly can erm and sacrifice all other else all everything else to this end
S0619	yep
S0618	and i use to be like that i'm not like that at all anymore mm but a lot of it be grow up and you know be a manager at the age of eighteen and be a long blonde haired female manager
S0619	mm
S0618	in a world that be still pretty sexist even in liberal
S0619	mm
S0618	erm yeah and have something to prove and really have to be twice as good as the next nearest bloke to get any sort of recognition
S0619	mm mm yeah with like she's very very good er and i would like to be like her but i have to remember she's get four or five years experience on me and she study teach english at university
S0618	mm yep
S0619	she didn't study sort of english she study how to teach english as a foreign language
S0618	yeah
S0619	and she's get a celta erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	so she's be sort of in the environment of teach english since she go to uni when she be nineteen
S0618	mm yeah huge experience
S0619	erm so that's a decade er cos it's in english but
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm it's not it doesn't be english doesn't give you the skills to be a teacher
S0618	yeah and she's completely passionate about it
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	she live it eat it breathe it
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	erm but she's you know it's the experience that make you better and she's get
S0618	mm
S0619	over double the years of experience so or well over four of five years if she start teach when
S0618	yeah
S0619	she'd graduate when she be twenty five and she's like what twenty nine then so by the time i'm twenty nine i probably won't be a teacher anymore
S0618	possibly not
S0619	but if i be i'll be as good as be
S0618	or better you will
S0619	or better

S0619	do you not feel like it's a lot of faff
S0618	no i don't mind the faff i don't mind prepare it at all but i just don't fancy all that cold when i'm at home

S0618	yeah
S0619	that you've get to sort of have a lot of salad
S0618	yeah and then
S0619	so the stuff doesn't go off it go off quite quickly so you have to eat a lot of salad in sort of two to three days
S0618	mm most stuff you can bung in a chilli though
