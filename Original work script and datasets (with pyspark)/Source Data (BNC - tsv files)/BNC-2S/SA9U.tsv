S0024	i think that would be quite oh oops sorry
S0024	be quite a chore
S0144	yeah
S0024	that would be very difficult
S0144	yeah probably not worth it
S0024	and you would end up completely mental
S0024	not like a little bite of talk to yourself that's go to be a lot of talk to yourself and make sure you get an answer from yourself
S0144	yeah
S0024	not just let yourself drift away
S0144	maybe you could buy like a er a script and go to the library and get like a like a play or something
S0144	not a very well know one you know and just do the different character then at least you wouldn't have to think of what you be go to say you could just read it
S0024	read be not the same though be it
