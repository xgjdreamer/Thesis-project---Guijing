S0426	that's right
S0427	or so before
S0426	that's right that's right that's right
S0427	mm mm
S0426	i mean some club you've you do feel charitable towards to sympathetic towards to
S0427	yes yeah
S0426	some you don't and you think you know if they for example if man city play against chelsea i want them both to lose and it's as simple
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	as that you know
S0427	it's
S0426	preferably with people be send off
S0426	and all the rest of it that's right
S0427	yes or well er without anyone get harm but
S0426	no not harm
S0427	the grind be destroy as well you know
S0426	no exactly yes that's right not seriously long last injuries obviously
S0427	no no no
S0426	that would be too much
S0427	when everybody's go you know and there's sort of a ray come down from above
S0426	yeah
S0427	sort of flatten the place
S0427	yes
S0426	that's right
S0427	mm yes i i my heart do not go out to er chelsea's or especially their manager i can't stand mourinho
S0426	he's a swine isn't he
S0427	mm no he's not my cup of tea
S0426	no there be some insufferable people aren't there he's just one of them i be actually i be think about that kind of insufferability in in people and kevin pietersen be another example of that
S0427	yes
S0426	er which well
S0427	yeah
S0426	people divide on this one which side be you on this one
S0427	i'm i'm glad he's not be pick i i i think there be a place for decency and team manship
S0426	right
S0427	or you know the collegiality
S0426	yes right
S0427	and and he's a destroyer of it erm
S0426	true
S0427	sometimes you have to put up with but erm i think in his case he's past his best
S0426	oh that's a different kettle
S0427	you know
S0426	kettle of fish but er against that which i fully agree with you be the rather genteel criteria apply to people like alastair cook and others
S0427	uhu
S0426	who
S0427	mm
S0426	what's the phrase they use about him well he come from the right kind of family
S0427	he's a good chap isn't he
S0426	and er a good chap that's right yeah
S0427	farm stock you know
S0426	farm stock yeah
S0427	or or at least his people be
S0426	his exactly his people be
S0427	and i think he marry into farm stock
S0426	that's right as well
S0427	he he like be down on the farm now
S0426	and he's a hunt and fish and shoot kind as well be he well
S0427	he's a decent chap you know he's well well educate
S0426	right
S0427	one of us
S0426	yeah go to the right school obviously
S0427	he must have do
S0426	must have do dear boy
S0427	you know
S0427	erm
S0426	you think if that's on the other side
S0426	i'm not sure which side i'm really on here
S0427	i know well it's not a perfect world be it
S0426	no no it isn't
S0427	you know
S0426	that's right no
S0427	it's not a perfect world
S0426	that's it's right
S0427	you know
S0426	i think
S0427	erm
S0426	my only point of you know sympathy for the england team be they've get moeen ali in it you know and you know that's
S0427	uhu
S0426	that's it seem to be a good thing whatever he's like as a player i don't know
S0427	yeah
S0426	he
S0427	oh he's he er he's a good show
S0426	okay
S0427	a lot of promise he's not the finish article yet but he's he's only
S0426	right
S0427	play a handful of test
S0426	right
S0427	but er
S0426	how he manage presumably with somewhat different value he's a practice muslim
S0427	yes
S0426	in that kind of environment in that sort of dress room with very secular bantery
S0427	and
S0426	entitle middle class
S0427	celebrate with alcohol and all this
S0426	with alcohol and that kind of stuff
S0427	yes yeah yeah well he go on record as say that erm i i want to be a good a good muslim and i want to be a good cricketer and i want to show that the two
S0426	you can do the can be
S0427	you know
S0426	combine yeah
S0427	can can be combine
S0426	that's right
S0427	and erm
S0426	that's right yeah yeah yeah
S0427	erm somebody say of muhammad ali once that he be a credit to his race the human race
S0426	very good
S0427	you know
S0426	yes absolutely
S0427	and i now you could say that about
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	he he seem a thoroughly erm professional
S0426	absolutely yeah
S0427	and likeable one man from what
S0426	that's right
S0427	one see
S0426	true true true true
S0427	of his public persona you know
S0426	and he's avoid or er yeah that's probably the right word be treat like monty panesar be
S0427	yeah
S0426	of be somewhat patronise
S0427	i i i don't think he's be patronise er panesar it now look as if well i think panesar be patronise but he be a different kind of character it look as if there be demons in panesar's background from what we
S0426	right
S0427	now know
S0426	oh be that right
S0427	but er
S0426	i didn't know
S0427	yeah he's he be catch erm he well he have trouble with his marriage and i think that fold and then he be catch urinate on a on a guy outside a nightclub you know and
S0426	monty that's amaze
S0427	yes yeah
S0426	but that's not the image that i think be be promote by the press of be a rather erratic cuddly
S0427	yeah well
S0426	er
S0427	there be something
S0426	devil may care
S0427	something happen in his life
S0426	eccentric
S0427	and there be i mean and there be obviously issue with drink
S0426	okay
S0427	cos er i think he be drink
S0426	oh
S0427	when he do the
S0426	okay okay okay
S0427	thing outside the nightclub of the bouncers i think it be
S0426	graduate of this university
S0427	who panesar
S0426	yeah
S0427	be he
S0426	yes he be
S0427	well i didn't teach him i teach nick knight briefly er and
S0426	now that's a name from the distant past
S0427	well yeah he he have a reasonable career as an opener for england but he
S0426	be that right
S0427	only play about i say only he only play twenty time and
S0426	when he come off the pitch do he say teach me everything i know
S0427	not about cricket he didn't no
S0427	he he might have
S0426	and how long do he last as a cricketer
S0427	he might he might have mutter something about the jury's still out
S0426	the criminal justice system
S0427	you know and have teach me the
S0426	oh the jury's still out
S0427	's teach me that
S0426	teach
S0427	i'm innocent till prove guilty
S0427	that kind of stuff yeah but he's a commentator now on sky but again he's not
S0426	okay
S0427	in the first rank of commentators he's sort of like in the
S0426	right right right
S0427	the reserve team
S0426	the when the others can't come in
S0427	yeah or you know the the top people who do the test match
S0426	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0427	and and then he's do the county game or the
S0426	yeah
S0427	or they they switch to the twenty
S0426	yes
S0427	twenty game
S0426	right okay
S0427	that would be nick knight and there be others not just him
S0426	for sure
S0427	you know there be others in that category and
S0426	and of course for all we know sit in our lecture there might well be that next generation they people wander around with waitrose
S0427	oh yeah
S0426	write on their on their bag don't they
S0427	yeah yeah yeah
S0426	you know it may well be
S0427	well especially in a place like this
S0427	mm
S0426	that's right yeah elite and all the rest of it yeah
S0427	yes well well i mean as long as they
S0427	as long as they can supply me with ticket to
S0427	yeah
S0426	oh yes that's right you've get a wimbledon connection
S0427	i've get er but er he wasn't an elite tennis player
S0426	mm
S0427	but erm
S0426	if he be a member of the queen's club be that what it's call
S0427	no erm there use to be a young chap i can't remember his name now who be in politics and i teach him and he become a kind of a press officer for the men's tour
S0426	right
S0427	and they play at and there be a couple of years when he ring me up and get me ticket for that but i don't think he do it any more i think he's
S0426	right
S0427	go off in a different career but be the name of the young chap er
S0426	mm
S0427	well he's not a young well he's a sort of
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	mid thirties now erm he be a student here and be an honorary official at wimbledon
S0426	right
S0427	and for about the last seven or eight years he's be kind enough to get me ticket for various things and this year he's get me two ticket for the men's final
S0426	fantastic
S0427	they're half price ticket
S0426	that's just fantastic
S0427	for the men's final cos he can buy them
S0426	yes yes
S0427	you know and share them out
S0426	that's just extraordinary isn't it
S0427	so they're not yet in my possession but
S0426	mm
S0427	the cheque have be cash so to speak so i've no
S0426	right
S0427	no reason to suppose that er
S0426	good
S0427	that it it won't work
S0426	good good good i mean it's the kind of thing whereas hence people pay over the odds for isn't it
S0427	well i mean er i er er i will be go but erm er you know the face value be a hundred and sixty pound well er i i i reckon i could sell that for
S0426	sure sure
S0427	over
S0426	yeah sure
S0427	five hundred pound
S0426	exactly
S0427	if i wish to
S0426	only certain people get the chance to buy it at face value presumably
S0427	yeah well i mean you
S0426	or do it go on open sale
S0427	no there be a there's ballot
S0426	uhu uhu
S0427	and so people put in for the ballot
S0426	uhu
S0427	but that's in the sort of november the year before
S0426	yeah
S0427	that kind of thing
S0426	right
S0427	and then there be small like obviously honorary officials who be allow
S0426	sure
S0427	to buy
S0426	sure
S0427	a small number of ticket
S0426	number that's right yes
S0427	er and then there be debenture ticket holders they they can buy a ticket or so many ticket per day they hire a load to sell them for anything that they can get
S0426	no that's a bite it's a bite er
S0427	well it's write
S0426	off isn't it
S0427	into the rule if so if you're get i think the last debenture call be you know you have to have something like sixty thousand pound but if you
S0426	sixty thousand
S0427	if you be a twenty year old and you have sixty thousand or your parent do it's worth buy because
S0426	because you could make that back
S0427	you would you would make money on it
S0426	yes that's right
S0427	you know
S0426	in the long term that's true
S0427	yeah
S0426	i mean it just seem very unfair that you should be able to sell them on for profit
S0427	well
S0426	give that you're well
S0427	well because to do so in any other class of ticket be illegal
S0426	well that make it doubly so doesn't it
S0427	i think it
S0426	it make it
S0427	i think it i think it's write on the ticket that i get from wimbledon you cannot
S0426	not for exchange
S0427	no not for resale
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	or something like that you know
S0426	it's very hard to know how you could ever police such a system
S0427	well i'd say it i mean unless it's go to come to the the to the i mean i think some rock concert have do this unless you have to turn up with a ticket and your passport
S0426	well
S0427	you know
S0426	in countries er we've have this discussion before like italy and spain where
S0427	yeah
S0426	you must carry your dni all the time your you know identity card
S0427	yeah
S0426	then it's plausible it's it's a feasible security system
S0427	yeah
S0426	to require people to bring their
S0427	yeah
S0426	identity well cos they have to have it anyway
S0427	and for all i know that may happen in er
S0426	well but not in britain because you're not
S0427	no
S0426	you not everybody's get a passport for a start
S0427	no
S0426	and the last thing you wanna do be take it to a rock concert for god's sake
S0427	well exactly
S0426	it's a ridiculous thing to do
S0427	and er and in any event there be there be so many ways around it because you hear i don't know i i happen to read a review of paul mccartney recently
S0426	mm
S0427	and and they be say he's still do it at the age of
S0426	yeah
S0427	seventy something
S0426	yeah
S0427	but i know for a fact as soon as that come online people would have snap up the ticket
S0426	yes
S0427	and then the follow day when you think all the ticket be go there's a ticket agency that's suddenly sell them
S0426	sure
S0427	but not at a hundred pound a shoot
S0426	no no okay
S0427	you know
S0426	right yeah
S0427	so you know that that might have be legitimate
S0426	sure
S0427	but ticket be be sell above their
S0426	sure
S0427	face value
S0426	sure
S0427	and some people say oh well that's just the market that's supply and demand get use to it
S0426	well
S0427	and others say and include some one or two actually
S0426	mm
S0427	rock star say
S0426	yes
S0427	no no i
S0426	right
S0427	want them sell to fan at this price i don't want them
S0426	okay
S0427	go anywhere else
S0426	sure if they can get that
S0427	you know
S0426	er you know agree er by the by the er administrators that's fair enough but the kind of thing the the agency have a mind there be be legit because it's i think it's call ticket stop or something like that
S0427	yeah
S0426	and i get into arsenal that way because what they do be somebody sell back their
S0427	yeah
S0426	er it actually it be spur sell back their ticket to
S0427	yeah
S0426	the agency at a price where they get three quarter of their money back
S0427	yeah
S0426	and the agency sell it at either face value or face value plus five percent
S0427	mm
S0426	so you get the chance to get a ticket nobody lose too much who's buy
S0427	yeah i understand
S0426	whatever and they get a bite of an administration fee and so on
S0427	i i think that may be an exception well well maybe it be an exception to the rule but
S0426	they do it for all kinds of things
S0427	what i be think of be slightly murkier
S0426	yes it be murkier
S0427	in the sense
S0426	sure
S0427	that they be get hold of so many ticket
S0426	okay no that's
S0427	you know
S0426	a different kettle of fish okay right
S0427	that you wonder how it how it's be do you know and and the other big bone of contention of course be that er even even when things be legitimately be sell through ticketmaster you have to pay a book fee
S0426	yes sure
S0427	and then you have to pay a percentage because you haven't get the right card
S0426	right right
S0427	and then there's postage
S0426	okay
S0427	on top of it
S0426	sure
S0427	and it's it's a rip off
S0426	sure
S0427	and i know that various this and com that and all the rest of it be look at
S0426	true
S0427	various charge they they really should start look at at that
S0426	well er
S0427	cos i know roam charge for phone have
S0426	yes have be
S0427	come down and come down in
S0426	right okay
S0427	in recent years
S0426	eventually people even people like ryanair realise that it's bad for their business and they have
S0427	yeah and in today's
S0426	exactly so
S0427	independent be a report on their profit have soar
S0426	soar after they've
S0427	and their seat occupancy
S0426	right
S0427	rate have
S0426	sure sure
S0427	increase
S0426	i just
S0427	you know
S0426	hold my nose and sign up for ryanair to go to er
S0427	yeah
S0426	abroad
S0427	yeah
S0426	and it's much better than it use to be
S0427	it be
S0426	there be still one thing which be it drive you crazy which be the insurance
S0427	yeah
S0426	if you don't want insurance you look for the i don't want insurance box to tick
S0427	mm
S0426	and it doesn't seem to be there
S0427	uhu
S0426	you've get to go through the list of the countries which the insurance apply to till you get beyond denmark and it's one of those don't want insurance
S0427	oh
S0426	and it that be it
S0427	that that be a bite naughty isn't it
S0426	it's a bite naughty that's right
S0427	yes you're right
S0426	and they could say well
S0427	it should simply well er
S0426	yeah
S0427	there be there there be a somebody or something look into that now whether it what power it have i don't know
S0426	that's it exactly that's true yes
S0427	but you're right it doesn't look cos so many people whiz through it and suddenly it
S0426	sure sure
S0427	doesn't come out as seventy pound
S0426	sure
S0427	it's eighty five and you wonder why
S0426	yeah why why be that
S0427	you know and you've suddenly pay
S0426	sure sure
S0427	for insurance that perhaps you don't need
S0426	they're not the only ones
S0427	or you've already get from somewhere else
S0426	i mean ryanair be er notorious but
S0427	yeah
S0426	i've recently have do other things where
S0427	mm
S0426	you discover it at the end that there's actually there's a
S0427	mm
S0426	extra administration charge
S0427	mm
S0426	as well which hasn't be er er advertise until right at the last moment and of course they know perfectly well that by the time you've get there
S0427	yes
S0426	and it's quote only ten pound or whatever
S0427	yeah
S0426	you think oh god you know what be i gonna do i might as well buy it so you just go ahead and do it
S0427	but it they they certainly have become more human in their policy towards the pay public whereas there be no doubt that previously they treat the pay public like cattle and i wouldn't use them er i have use them once since er to go krakow
S0426	right
S0427	but that be the only way i could get there i think erm
S0426	yes exactly so if there's any alternative
S0427	yeah
S0426	er very please to use any alternative
S0427	er go to pisa for instance er i decide i would drive to luton and take easyjet rather than
S0426	fine
S0427	go from birmingham i think it be with erm ryanair
S0426	yes if there's a choice of those two then they're both
S0427	yeah
S0426	they're both doable and yes i would avoid
S0427	yeah
S0426	mind you luton airport be so horrible er
S0427	well it be and there's roadworks there as well which didn't help
S0426	that's true
S0427	you know cos
S0426	that's true
S0427	i be go down by car but but have say i mean easyjet have get become a little bite more friendly as well
S0426	true
S0427	you know and you can
S0426	you can allocate seat and all the rest of it
S0427	you yes and you
S0426	that's right
S0427	and you can buy seat at quite i mean i think i buy seat at five pound each way i mean
S0426	yes
S0427	that's nothing
S0426	that
S0427	you know
S0426	that's right not compare to the price of the
S0427	erm and i and the thing be i didn't have to worry about fight my way on the plane and since i be right down the front i get off it very quickly and with hand luggage i be out through er
S0426	exactly
S0427	passport control
S0426	exactly
S0427	in no time at all
S0426	exactly
S0427	because i be first in the queue
S0426	exactly that's right yes er i i've people be quite will to pay the er five pound for that
S0427	yeah i don't mind it for that
S0426	that's right it's in their interest
S0427	well i think i tell you i have a whole bunch of three seat to my on to myself there and back just by luck
S0426	yes just by luck you can't
S0427	mm yeah
S0426	legislate
S0427	no
S0426	for that
S0427	no
S0426	but when it happen it's a great bonus
S0427	yeah i mean well especially on a flight like that
S0426	where the legroom be gonna be pretty crap so anything
S0427	yeah
