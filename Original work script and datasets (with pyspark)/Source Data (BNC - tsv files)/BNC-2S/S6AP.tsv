S0281	yes so erm give me er an idea er cos he he's er more or less decide to work for himself and start his own business and he say he go down to er erm hong kong and manage to er
S0281	to get erm a visa for start his own business
S0355	in china
S0281	yeah
S0355	right what do he fancy do there
S0281	well he's get an idea i'm not sure quite exactly what it entail but it's about er i think er start up some business online er he's very good with computers unlike me erm and i think he go down to hong kong and manage to convince them that what he'd get plan be feasible so i think i think he's get it
S0355	cos hong kong's chinese now isn't it of course yeah
S0281	yeah yeah but unfortunately they they well it be erm it be the system with hong kong be that it it's now chinese but they get er two erm two systems one country er they get sovereignty over it
S0355	right
S0281	it's like er erm territories you know like france have get monaco and and er andorra which they share with spain but erm but it's it be chinese the chinese government have get the er the ultimate say over everything and erm they put the kibosh on that er that democracy movement that that start last year when they have riot
S0355	yes right
S0281	er i be surprise to be honest that the that the chinese government let them go as far as they do
S0355	right
S0281	but now they they sort of ride out the they're very clever the chinese er government and er they rather than clamp down on it really harshly which a lot of people include myself be expect er they let it ride and now have buy in when er all the the hoo ha and the world attention's not on it they're er make sure restrictions make sure they you know they don't do it again so er but find work down there wouldn't be wouldn't be possible because they've get the same restrictions about be sixty five there as they have in
S0355	china
S0281	in erm
S0355	the mainland
S0281	in in mainland china yeah and er most of asia south east asia all the same malaysia indonesia thailand it's all the same
S0355	they probably think they're help people
S0281	sixty five that's it
S0355	ah dear dear dear but so how do he give you hope
S0281	well think you know if he's get it maybe i could get it if i i've gotta contact him erm again erm find out exactly how he do it erm so that's two things i can try mm yeah
S0355	yeah what and then if you then you'd move back into mainland china
S0281	well you can just go down there and try and get the visa
S0355	yeah
S0281	come back
S0355	do you think you'd run into that age thing again though
S0281	i don't think it apply if you're start a business er business i don't think so
S0355	doesn't it from what i be look at there what they want be quite a bite of er paperwork involve
S0281	well always be with bureaucracy and china be even worse than here as far as you know those type of bureatic things bureaucratic things yeah i don't know just have to try my best see what happen
S0355	yeah
S0281	it do worry me i dunno maybe i mean be always positive about this you know this er erm police check thing that erm shouldn't it shouldn't affect my application but we have to see
S0355	that would affect what
S0281	my application for a business permit
S0355	it shouldn't

S0281	what about since you're gonna be stick at home for a while explore the idea of maybe try to give your advice regard build problems in general and iron work in particular online try and would that work you you charge for advice online
S0355	not really
S0281	no
S0355	i have no you'd have to be insure for that

S0355	oh you're responsible for any information you give
S0281	oh right
S0355	if i give the wrong info

S0281	really
S0355	well i carry a million a million and a half
S0281	do you
S0355	but i've have to let that go cos that cost me two hundred odd quid a year

S0281	mm well at least it's the leave hand not the right
S0355	well that's true that's it isn't it it's true yeah
S0281	mm
S0355	i'll get it do get it do
S0281	it's a lovely even
S0355	isn't it beautiful
S0281	the wind's drop as well i think
S0355	it's what
S0281	the wind's drop
S0355	yes i listen to the weather forecast you know the the ship forecast the other night
S0281	mm
S0355	i don't know if it be the night before last i think it be it wasn't i don't think it be last night but it say er gales everywhere

S0355	yeah
S0281	later on but there's a high pressure system come in temperatures around mid twenties that should be nice might even be able to sunbathe on the beach yeah
S0355	yeah
S0281	i be surprise when we be down in nice you know er how erm how few topless women there be there be still the odd one but er explain it by say it be er the arabs' fault er the the hassle they get from even throw stone at them sometimes apparently
S0355	yeah i er save a girl from from serious sexual assault in a when i be in paris with my girlfriend and er we be at the arc de triomph on new year's eve
S0281	and you decide against it
S0355	yeah but no she she be drag to the grind by half a dozen at least probably more arabs drag this single woman to the grind
S0281	oh my god
S0355	be grope her put their hand up her skirt you know she she be just do nothing and i just wad into them
S0281	yeah mm well do
S0355	well i didn't hit anyone i just say get off her help her up and say you go and stand with us
S0281	mm well do
S0355	but you know a respectable woman she be you know shock she be really frighten
S0281	mm mm the thing be when often when people talk about er interracial problems like well there be here and but even more so france it's er it's to outsiders it might sound racist but when you live there and see on a daily basis what happen erm it's it's another thing
S0355	what what what things do you remember see when you be there that the arabs
S0281	well if you're go to score some dope it's go to be from an arab
S0355	right
S0281	which which be you know in itself be fine but erm if you're go to get er attack or rob or whatever chance be that it's gonna be an arab who do it and that that's not racist to say so it's just the way things be you know and er yeah you know the the young kid the they call them in france which be always sort of a strange nickname for them cos literally use to mean butter right but now the butter but
S0355	why do they call them that
S0281	i don't know i don't know but erm ah there be big problems in especially in paris er with all the er the arabs and the black er they live in ghettos and er the inner cities be terrible place
S0355	be they
S0281	oh yeah no go areas some of them
S0355	wow
S0281	yeah and er
S0355	wow it's that bad
S0281	yeah oh yeah yeah it really be well remember that that story i tell you about when we be walk along the prom in nice about i remember watch er the american bombers go ahead when the first iraqi war open you know and i tell you that er i saw a queue outside the arm shop you know people would
S0355	yeah yeah
S0281	cos of the the white be really scar that it be gonna kick off
S0355	well it's only the other side of the mediterranean isn't it
S0281	well yeah
S0355	it's not far away
S0281	but er but it didn't materialise erm
S0355	no
S0281	but er there be you know this fear in france be really a divide country when that erm charlie hebdo thing happen
S0355	yeah
S0281	that radicalised a lot of people
S0355	what
S0281	exodus from france so french citizens erm
S0355	where do they choose to go
S0281	well london's a favourite spot but also
S0355	really
S0281	yeah
S0355	what for parisians
S0281	yeah they're there be many more er french leave er france than ever before and er
S0355	good god
S0281	oh yeah
S0355	it's like the end of the roman empire isn't it
S0281	well
S0355	the fall of the roman empire
S0281	it and especially jewish families i know you you don't have much sympathy for them but er they
S0281	they they er they're really fear er well what they can see as inevitable that er there's tax on synagogues and and jewish school and things you know
S0355	oh i see yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0281	and there be there be arm soldier outside all these place now
S0355	oh my goodness
S0281	you don't remember we see those arm guy up above the station
S0355	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0281	they're everywhere so doesn't bode well do it when you've get paramilitary and military erm force er on more or less permanent guard outside jewish place
S0355	place
S0281	smack of you know pre war germany doesn't it
S0355	well
S0281	so they're they get record immigration to they're go to er israel i think yeah but erm but i be talk to those french girls you don't remember i go out have a one even a few a month or so ago
S0355	yes
S0281	and they you know they don't they don't know the answer either well it's gonna happen they say themselves you know they they they're always wary about go out be attack
S0355	by arabs
S0281	mm mainly
S0355	wow
S0281	yeah not only but i think that's a you know the main cause and er well we speak about this charlie hebdo thing and erm they just say well you know the the basic question wasn't it the the the moral philosophical question about er whether they be right or wrong to publish those things that that instigate the attack whether either in a democracy that er one of the oldest in the world i don't know if it's the oldest but
S0355	i thoughts the greeks
S0281	well it wasn't a true democracy as such it be only you have to be a citizen didn't you and they have slave and
S0355	oh i see yeah
S0281	so erm whether you should have the right to say something negative about somebody but be it on the other hand do you have the right to insult something or somebody be consider sacred like mohammed okay so that's the the thing that that start it wasn't it when they they and er and you saw the americans they they what happen there
S0355	i think you have to respect people have respect for people
S0281	yeah but the the the question be should on one hand in a democracy where you've get the right to say what you think about something should that be your er right to do so but on the other hand
S0355	by think
S0281	it it would you be could you be accuse of incitement to riot
S0355	you could be accuse of that quite probably but there again there be many good muslims who didn't
S0281	sure
S0355	riot about it who who erm who just say well that's you know i don't even want to know about it you know and i forgive them
S0281	well i think most muslims do take that
S0355	i think most muslims do take that line
S0281	yeah but
S0355	erm
S0281	we only hear about the minority don't we the extremists
S0355	i can i can show you i can show you websites on there of jews say things from i'm glad we murder your christ your jesus we i i promise you i can show you websites and they're not by as a matter of fact these be jews to things on television mock christianity mock people's belief in swear and all this on jewish television so i don't er you know i i er i felt it before as a christian and even though i'm not i don't go to church often but it offend me it do offend me very much you know
S0281	it's a very delicate line this because it it carry on over to erm er how what you you consider be necessary to be a good er devotee of a certain religion like for example head gear headwear not only include in the arab veil for women
S0355	catholic nuns
S0281	well yeah yeah and but the the french government the parliament they they they rule that erm they er they can't wear it er erm
S0355	the hijab
S0281	yeah
S0355	yeah
S0281	so when again sikhs you know should why why shouldn't sikhs have their turbans and
S0355	well quite it's what make enrich the world isn't it
S0281	yeah yeah
S0355	i think the dangerous thing be when you start put your stuff on other people as muslims would put their stuff christians put their stuff
S0281	mm i think the you you it make sense that countries like britain and france have to er change with the time and while on the one hand france be a secular state and have this rigid partition between er the clergy and the government
S0355	clergy and state
S0281	the state yeah erm well there's that er i think er that they they should er be more flexible er because most of these immigrants they're not gonna go away so france like britain be a multicultural country and you can't expect to live in the past
S0355	no well i i'm quite sure quite probably years ago people be multicultural you know and people all over different religions and different er ethnicities be live all over the world weren't there
S0281	well they be they be
S0355	you know here and
S0281	but it's so much more intensify isn't it these days with the just the number
S0355	well i saw something the other day it say oh in they be do a story on rome and it say in whenever it be twelve fifty or whenever er there be more people live in rome than there be today
S0281	really
S0355	so and i suspect the same be true i know certainly of edinburgh there be probably more people live in edinburgh for certainly and if you look at it at at everything you'll probably find there be more people live in london because people you know that little cottage i have in
S0355	yeah i mean there be four families live in there
S0281	good lord
S0355	four families
S0281	well i think the number be certainly they use to be around one or two million for a long time didn't they wasn't it and then i seem to remember when we be kid that from geography lessons the population of london be about six to eight million something like that i think it's maybe a lot more now
S0355	yeah but when you when you look where at that area the city of london that once be the people live in that area then say six million or whatever and now in that square mile there be probably less people live in that square square mile than there be then
S0281	mm
S0355	although the city's expand the you know people live in expect to live in in in a flat don't they in a small flat with with service but er you know but i be read a a book it be 's i think i've give it back to her but it be erm a it be a labour mp write it
S0281	mm
S0355	i i think it be i think it be a guy call alan clark or john clark and he describe how he live in the fifties with his mother and father in this erm build that's in this part of london that's probably now pull down but they in one room they have one room upstairs oh oh no they have two room and there be four of them and like two room upstairs in this house and the loo be a bucket and they have to take the bucket down to the road it be just appallingly
S0281	mm
S0355	erm it be poverty it be grind poverty
S0281	most of it just get throw out the window think didn't it
S0355	yeah well it use didn't it
S0281	yeah
S0355	god guard a loo
