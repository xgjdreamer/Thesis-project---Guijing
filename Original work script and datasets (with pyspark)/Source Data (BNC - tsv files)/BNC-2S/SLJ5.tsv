S0679	so how's your day go
S0681	well i i it be good that i leave early this morning because i erm it be a bite further than i anticipate and so i have to skate get my skate on erm when i arrive at the pub carpark everybody be there fortunately nobody else have get there desperately early so erm it wasn't a big deal in the end although i be panic towards the end of the journey
S0679	you weren't lead it
S0681	no no no i wasn't the leader erm i can't remember who be oh be the leader be the leader yeah
S0679	and be it or you seem to be a bite
S0681	it be
S0679	undecided
S0681	well we go to the village of cos we go to the pub in but we be walk around but we go round a different direction than we'd do before so i didn't recognise any of it
S0679	well there's quite a bite of it
S0681	mm
S0679	i mean we go up here years ago
S0681	mm
S0679	that may be the last time i go do you remember there be a snowy weekend
S0681	mm
S0679	one january
S0681	i don't the things the place we walk round i don't recall remember any of it from that trip though
S0679	well it be kind of a bite difficult to
S0679	i mean it's all kind of flat and look the same really
S0681	yeah we do we go past the centre
S0679	i don't think they have a centre
S0681	well they've get a cottage which be a centre it's only open at the weekend but the we go past that certainly but we didn't go past a er a a major sort of show build or anything like that at all
S0679	well do you go to the main entrance i'd have think there be only one
S0681	no we didn't no no no er somebody else say we think we're sneak in the back door
S0679	mm
S0681	we seem to go through lot of field and things the one that's really nice there be okay winter it be fairly low sun but because there wasn't much cloud there be the sun behind all the you have the flag that wave about so they really look quite spectacular oh and we saw some horse we saw some horse the funny horse in the
S0679	oh now that the funny horse we saw from a walk from the walk from didn't we
S0681	yeah be that with
S0679	yeah be that the same place
S0681	yeah yeah
S0679	i don't really know the geography but you say you might head for
S0681	yeah well yeah i get there via so it's quite a bite further out from yeah yes these be przewalski horse or something
S0679	mm
S0681	but that quite happy on the quite coarse graze there we saw some highland cattle as well both be quite a long way away the horse look very suspicious they be watch us go there be about twelve of them they be about well i dunno six seven hundred metres away but they be watch us very suspiciously
S0679	i wonder if you'd go into proper would you not have to show your national trust membership
S0681	i don't know i don't know i don't
S0679	well do you
S0681	no not at all there be no we didn't go through any barriers or gate or anything
S0679	and not even at the centre
S0681	no no that be at the side of the public road you know
S0679	mm be that part of or not
S0681	it it it may have be i'm not entirely sure
S0679	mm
S0681	it seem to be a well there be a sign on their fence that say national trust that way with an arrow
S0679	mm
S0681	you know but i don't know if that be actually a national trust build at all
S0679	mm and you have your lunch in
S0681	yeah the pub be very nice the i think it be yeah
S0679	do do they just have one do you think be it that sort of place
S0681	yes i think so it's not a big place but the the funny thing be just as we be about to set up another walk group arrive and they be have lunch at the pub as well so we check the time fortunately they weren't eat till one o'clock and we be we'd set to twelve thirty but when we leave after the meal the pub be actually stuff to the gunnels
S0679	mm
S0681	there wasn't a spare space anywhere for food so they obviously they the food be very good so they've obviously get quite a reputation
S0679	what do you have
S0681	oh i have stroganoff
S0679	uhu
S0681	which be superb somebody else have a sandwich which come a doorstep sandwich which come with a load of chip and green stuff and they be only expect a thin sandwich
S0679	mm
S0681	so they be a bite
S0679	so everyone be happy with that one
S0681	oh yeah oh yeah i think everybody do well you know so what have you be up to
S0679	well erm largely sort out my online account which i make sure i could access them properly i also just want to update my well i want to be sure i know what sort of interest i be get on account
S0681	bugger all i imagine
S0679	because when my pension come through i'll have the opportunity of put some more money in
S0681	mm
S0679	an interest
S0681	mm
S0679	er in a a save sort of account
S0679	erm and also set up an isa for the year
S0681	have you have you find anything worthwhile for
S0679	erm
S0681	interest wise
S0679	well i know where i'm go to put my money initially because it's always easier to open another account with a build society
S0681	oh yeah
S0679	you're already with
S0681	but we the national save pensioner bond be quite a good interest rate
S0679	mm
S0681	but they may have go down after the first year all of these things seem to go down
S0679	yeah
S0681	after a year
S0679	yeah
S0681	don't they
S0679	and erm oh there be yeah i saw something that have twelve months of interest on it interest interest
S0681	interest interest
S0679	i think it be a tesco account
S0681	yeah i have some money in that but they've they send me a letter say they're reduce the interest rate to the square root of bugger all you know
S0679	oh be that their current account
S0681	no no no i have erm i just have a a a save account
S0679	oh
S0681	of some description i think it be kind of at two percent
S0679	well have a look again
S0681	yeah
S0679	and cos i think you can get if you do an internet one you can one point seven five for the first year
S0681	mm
S0679	so i'm go to work on the current account cos you say you get some interest on that
S0681	from from which which
S0679	tesco
S0681	mm no i didn't say you get interest on the current account from tescos
S0679	oh i think you do cos you tell me you've get one
S0681	no i haven't get a current account with tescos
S0679	well anyway i have well i'm in the process of get one and then i've obviously i won't open the the one where you only get the high interest for a year until i've actually get the money to put in it
S0681	well
S0679	erm but i ought to i i mean you don't get very much at all but i've get to do something with it and depend on how much money i get you know that rate have go down to er the protection be seventy five thousand
S0681	mm yes yes you of course if you're gonna get a big lump sum you're gonna have to spread it around ain't you
S0679	well i've it's not gonna be so large i have to spread it very far
S0679	but because of the way i
S0681	well you're a moneyed woman aren't you
S0679	the way i've get erm account set up erm i do need to fiddle around with my nationwide one to make sure that's a legit
S0681	mm
S0679	erm and they will nationwide will let you take ten thousand pound out of any erm account if it help you get your you know without a penalty if it help you get your money down
S0681	oh get you under the er be it
S0679	mm
S0681	eighty five thousand now
S0679	well it be eighty five it's gonna go down to seventy five from january
S0681	oh right oh that's
S0679	and there's a on one of the sit it talk about and after april i think it be all erm interest account be gonna pay er without tax be deduct so
S0681	so be that
S0679	you have to
S0681	be that
S0679	declare your own tax presumably
S0681	oh that's
S0679	but
S0681	well that's bloody stupid isn't it because that mean
S0679	seem it's it's likely to cause more employment opportunities in the er the the tax department
S0681	in the tax well more or opportunities with accountants as well i suspect
S0679	well it make it a bite more complicate i i i can't see any good reason for it erm
S0681	no i'd have think it would have be easier for the inland revenue because it be all do corporately so they get a big wodge of money from each bank and they didn't have to pursue it
S0679	mm
S0681	now they're gonna get little dribble of money from or little dribble of sort of tax demand from that millions of people
S0679	unless they think it's a way of check if you give so much interest one year and give get a lot more interest the next year perhaps that's a way of sussing out who's get more who's you know who's get money they haven't declare but i mean don't
S0681	mm
S0679	unscrupulous people won't actually declare it will they i mean
S0681	well no quite yeah
S0679	you'd only er declare it at whatever you're allow to have every year
S0681	because
S0679	so it's a bite strange really
S0681	yeah cos when you fill in a tax return you still have to declare interest but they crosscheck that against what they've return cos i use to get that when i do the detail tax return they would mash their figure to mine
S0679	uhu
S0681	and often they weren't exactly the same but as long as they be fairly close they didn't seem to worry too much about it
S0679	and have you erm hear about the second home business
S0681	no what's gonna happen on that
S0679	if you buy a second home or potentially if you buy a new house before you've sell your old house or anything like this
S0681	mm
S0679	erm you have to pay higher rat of stamp duty
S0681	oh yeah i've hear about that i'm not i wasn't sure of the erm how it be hedge about with erm advantage and restrictions so cos you know sometimes you don't sell them by at the same time and so
S0679	well i don't know i mean apparently they're gonna have to have a month or two months to suss out what it might mean
S0681	mm
S0679	but i think it's an attempt to try and share the house round more people
S0681	well which be not that
S0679	but
S0681	i still like westminster council's idea that if you're not register to vote there you pay a lot more tax
S0679	mm
S0681	i think that's a brilliant idea
S0679	well
S0681	because it catch empty property as well
S0679	mm
S0681	that's the thing that so often escape the net
S0679	and they might be go to charge people from abroad more
S0681	mm
S0679	er well at least as much as everyone else have to pay
S0681	charge them what stamp
S0679	well the the even if they've only even when they buy their first one
S0681	mm yeah
S0679	but it might
S0679	it will make it a bite more expensive for erm
S0681	inward investment
S0679	landlords to buy
S0681	mm
S0679	multiple properties
S0681	yes i do recall
S0679	but i mean unless it's expensive it's not gonna make a huge difference
S0681	no it'll just push the price back up again wouldn't it which be not
S0679	well it may depress price for a while it may just put rent up
S0681	i think the only thing that'll depress price be build a hell of a sight more house
S0679	well
S0681	well i think the government
S0679	we don't really want that do we
S0681	well i don't know you know
S0679	well if we want it but it's not in our back garden
S0681	yes that's right yes
S0679	but probably live in the house in the part of the country where there aren't job would help
S0681	well that's right yeah and
S0679	and why build on any more of the countryside why make three time as big because there might be people live here and then
S0681	mm why why do move from to you know they say be to be near the university but i these days with communication and things like that good grief you don't really need to be physically near anywhere do you they're not physically near their manufacture plant which be all in the far east
S0679	mm mm
S0681	so there must be another reason
S0679	well i mean maybe it's easier to get the labour down here
S0681	mm the skilled labour
S0679	the skill
S0681	i wouldn't have think so we be maybe like yeah i don't know i know be erm could get i'm fairly certain she could get a job there but they're not a good company to work for apparently
S0679	well if she doesn't absolutely need a job but could have a job then that put her in a good position
S0681	oh yeah yeah she's very highly skilled
S0679	anyway she may be do enough with what she's get
S0681	yeah she's not earn big money but 's earn good enough so
S0679	mm
S0681	and they've pay off their mortgage so they're quite they're sit pretty really
S0679	anyway how how be we leave with this front door
S0681	erm we have to lock it from the inside to lock it the cos you can open it from the outside now if you've not lock it with a key from the inside you can just open it from the outside
S0679	mm
S0681	yeah because it hasn't get as there's a thing call a split barrel no it's not a barrel a split something or other which we've not get at the moment cos that's part of the problem the locksmith have order the part we need and when it come in he will phone me to let me know
S0679	i take it he didn't really like the lock you take in
S0681	no he be he be quite amenable he say it's a he say it's a bite unusual he say erm it's not a standard lock because when i look on the web on to find out it's all a great thing you can actually look on the web and look this all up
S0679	mm
S0681	the standard lock be seventeen millimetres wide and you can buy whole replacement lock for about a hundred pound you know have say that the barrel and handle be all separate again you know and the handle be twenty quid
S0679	mm you fit a very stylish erm door door handle on your door
S0681	it's it's the only one they have in the right size
S0679	oh
S0681	the and erm the
S0679	it doesn't no i haven't see it very closely
S0681	it's it's very carefully fit because it
S0679	mm
S0681	cos it's much narrower than the old one but when he get the part he'll phone me and i'll go in and collect it it's gonna be a lot of money could be up to a hundred quid for this part and then i have to ring back take the whole mechanism off again and replace the bite the lock behind the centre
S0679	mm
S0681	and he say it's a bite fiddly to do he say but but he seem to be quite confident i could do it so they be very busy when i be in there really busy cut key like men possess they be
S0679	oh what's mm it's not a particularly time of the year for students to be start
S0681	no no these be
S0679	would it be a good opportunity or would it be a not a good opportunity to take the key round when you go back
S0681	take the key round where
S0679	you know i need some key cut cos we decide one of the key we only have one of didn't we
S0681	oh which the front door or back door
S0679	i don't know perhaps you find some more for the patio door in the end one of the doors there be only one of them
S0681	no for the back doors we've certainly get a we've get two set complete set of key for everything
S0679	mm well i think we ought to no i think have we get more than one one each for the front door
S0681	well i don't know where be the key you give me be that your normal front door key
S0679	be we talk about here
S0681	yeah
S0679	i'm not
S0681	ah that
S0679	so okay
S0681	actually change the issue yes right carry on
S0679	that that key
S0681	reset
S0679	okay let's talk about key here then first the key that be in the front door be the one that live in my my belt so if i go out
S0681	be that your main key
S0679	my main key be slightly bend and belong with my
S0681	right so
S0679	with my car key
S0681	you've get two key and i've get one so we've get three key basically
S0679	okay so i've get a slightly bend key and i've get a key that isn't bend the reason i've get the other one be because i don't always take my car key out when i go out at the moment cos i quite often go in your car and but i have also get a spare key upstairs
S0681	so we've get four key one of which be bend okay and you're hold on to three of them
S0679	well it hang it's it's hang on the chest of drawers upstairs
S0681	alright okay
S0679	on a long loop of string and i put it there in case i have to throw it out the window for if i if i couldn't get down you know if i need her to come in
S0681	oh right
S0679	that's how we get up there
S0681	okay fine
S0679	but i'll bring that one down and
S0681	no no
S0679	use it in the front door because i'd rather have one in my
S0681	okay
S0679	in my belt
S0681	yeah we'll in while we're mess about for the next two days do that swap them round yeah erm now do you want to say there be something about the key that
S0679	yeah i'm sure
S0681	i'm not sure what set of key we have we have hundreds of key and most of them didn't fit anything you know
S0679	yeah but i'm sure there be one door we only have one key for be it actually a good time to actually go round be it good when you go back to collect it to have key cut or or be it better to keep that transaction simple
S0681	well i can do the same fine yeah i'm er i've half a mind to take take the whole thing off and take it with me and get them to do it
S0679	well if you do
S0681	he he seem er i say do you need me to take door oh no he say it's quite easy you can do it yourself he say yeah
S0679	well that's up to you
S0681	mm
S0679	if it when be you go to do it
S0681	actually well when he get the part in probably
S0679	and when when
S0681	friday he say day or two
S0679	friday okay well
S0681	oh what day be it
S0679	if you're go to take
S0681	do we have to put the bin out tonight
S0679	it's your black bin this week
S0681	oh i put it out it's get quite a lot in it
S0679	oh have you be throw things away
S0681	yeah i've be throw lot of things away i will not let you look cos you'll wanna keep everything
S0679	what be have you be throw away
S0681	no nothing of any weight or
S0679	oh
S0679	erm i have put a smelly fish thing in it
S0681	a smelly fish thing
S0679	you know that under
S0679	under sort of under thing you get in
S0681	ah right
S0679	fish
S0681	from where you buy it from er
S0679	yes
S0681	the yeah okay pack it's call i think
S0679	yes it's a sort of i think it's mean to absorb any nasties but it can certainly absorb a lot of fish smell
S0681	so we could have the cat in the bin tonight then
S0679	no it's not that strong i give it a wipe over
S0681	mm i haven't see any of next door's cat for a while
S0679	mm
S0681	cos they don't like the wind so
S0679	so erm now tomorrow you say you'd get you've get something in the morning
S0681	i'm go to the genome project in the morning
S0679	be you you've be say for weeks you're go there be this
S0681	yeah
S0679	the time you really go
S0681	they keep move it around yeah yeah
S0679	have you be there before
S0681	yeah i have i have i didn't realise well that's some the thing i remember from er somebody be try to get some concept of how much data be involve in have a complete genotype
S0679	mm
S0681	and somebody say well you need about a terabyte hard drive to hold it
S0679	mm
S0681	so that give you a pretty good idea how much information be involve rather a lot
S0679	yeah i mean it depend how they've get it store really i mean
S0681	they've get a lot of
S0679	do you just mean a terabyte as in my my my removable
S0681	drive yeah
S0679	yeah i mean i
S0681	per person
S0679	oh per person
S0681	per person so yeah you can imagine the amount of storage they've get to
S0679	well it's a lot of message to get you know
S0681	mm
S0679	you don't want your leave leg come out like your right leg do you
S0681	no
S0679	i mean you need them different
S0681	i might actually take my er my genotype my the little bite of information i've get with me
S0679	mm
S0681	and if there's time ask the question you know so they almost certainly the guide won't be able to tell give me anything tell me anything but but er i i
S0679	make your own up with
S0679	colour shape
S0681	yeah my i get the impression they do the four genotype because the research panel express an interest cos
S0679	mm
S0681	when the erm cardiac specialist saw it it wasn't room it be the other one her boss i think he say we'll have a bite of a job justify actually run the genotype cos they've get it's about seven thousand quid it reckon it cost although on my information now it's down to about two now
S0679	well isn't that the price
S0681	yeah and erm then i say oh i'm on the er on the the research oh he say then in that case there might be some quite a lot of advantage for for get you to do it if we do you
S0679	mm
S0681	then we can store it and use it for as part of the research panel as well so
S0679	so be you go to have your your erm your drive do in colour bricks to
S0679	follow you er
S0681	tca tcaff i think
S0679	yes
S0681	or whatever it be yeah
S0679	i be think of the path you know
S0681	oh right oh that would be fun wouldn't it yeah
S0679	imagine by get a longer path but it's quite long
S0681	the
S0679	isn't it
S0681	yeah it's never gonna be long enough though be it
S0679	no and you could do a little bite of it
S0681	mm mm
S0679	might not be up for it
S0681	mm
S0679	oh the
S0681	oh he'll be up for anything if you pay him enough money
S0679	yeah
S0681	yeah but i think we might end up with ashfelt actually
S0679	so
S0681	yes
S0679	so erm just think you're so you're do that in the morning
S0681	yeah
S0679	and then you're come back
S0681	yeah
S0679	and that's the afternoon you can take the my my reserve rollator
S0681	mm
S0679	to
S0681	yeah
S0679	and i i think really i should go first and sort my clothe out before collection
S0681	uhu
S0679	but i could a either make a start on do that just for a few minutes i see i don't
S0681	all your all your all your box of clothe be carefully label be they
S0679	well all the ones in the wardrobe be label
S0681	uhu
S0679	so they're they're fine it's the ones that erm be it's you know those big plasticy ones that be red yellow and blue with wheel
S0681	oh box not big plasticky clothe
S0679	no no you know the big ones
S0681	yeah yeah yeah ones the ones that look like treasure chests
S0679	yes
S0681	yeah
S0679	exactly erm and possibly could be yeah i don't know i suppose they plastic go a bite brittle cos i could probably
S0681	mm
S0679	sell them otherwise couldn't i
S0681	yeah
S0679	on gumtree and buy something probably a little more appropriate
S0681	yeah
S0679	or indeed possibly eliminate them now i've get the other ones erm i don't know how much they've get in and they're quite bulky
S0681	mm so what i need to do be before i go be to fold all the back of the car down
S0679	well you're gonna have the rollator in anyway don't worry about do it before you go
S0681	no it make more sense to do it before you go cos it mean i can take the cover off and it's a lot easier to do here
S0679	be it cos i think
S0681	oh yes
S0679	you could be do it at while i'm sort out
S0681	no it doesn't take very long but if i'm gonna take things out the car it's a lot easier to do it here cos i shove it all in the garage then
S0679	okay erm
S0681	i need a few minutes cos i've get when i go on the walk i i i put the big thick sweater on where you know it be glorious weather this morning
S0679	it be wasn't it
S0681	and i sort of rummage through my bag of bad weather clothe and just take the neck warmer with me
S0679	mm
S0681	so i've empty the bag out on the back seat so it all need to go back in the bag again
S0679	and you've get a few things in the corner i don't know what status they be
S0681	have i no i do not have things in the corner
S0679	well where have you get your coat from it be with those
S0681	yeah but i be cos you have it no because i have it
S0679	no they be all the things that be on the
S0681	ah be this the one where you tidy up by hide things under the settee

S0681	but i think this be the last one i'd better be fully equip
S0679	so you don't so do anything for christmas
S0681	mm what
S0679	in not do a special christmas
S0681	no we've get the christmas the christmas lunch
S0679	oh be they come to it

S0681	er indian lady whose name's i've completely forget
S0679	i know i've see i've meet i haven't really meet her though
S0681	the the little jolly one that's really very nice and and there's another person's er one of her friends be come
S0679	oh that's quite a nice group then
S0681	yeah and the erm there be an older couple that the end of our table today and we mention something about it and they say what's that about
S0679	mm
S0681	so i explain it and they're quite keen to come ask to he ask to buy erm one of my poetry anthologies
S0679	oh that's good
S0681	for it
S0679	have you get any leave
S0681	he actually give me the money well i'm run out now
S0679	oh well make sure you keep enough for yourself
S0681	yeah because erm er and ask for copy last time so i take them
S0679	mm
S0681	and they cough out the money and this guy be i don't know if this older couple be a bite on the periphery of the group cos they didn't seem to know a lot of what be go on i think they've not come for a few
S0679	mm
S0681	and erm he be look through it and he say i have you get i want one if you've get one i say oh
S0679	oh
S0681	i've get them all with me
S0679	well i mean maybe you could email around the others and see if they've get any that they don't want to sell
S0681	mm yeah if i get
S0679	i mean
S0681	number very low i will but they didn't have very many you know normally i print ten and give sell everybody ten
S0679	mm
S0681	but i've tell them to tell me their number this year
S0679	oh i see
S0681	but as much
S0679	i think they have to have the same number
S0681	no no it's much lower number this year so that's why the price go up a little bite because i need a print run of eighty
S0679	mm
S0681	instead of the usual hundred hundred and twenty
S0679	mm
S0681	so
S0679	and tell me now er you're you're you're you've say something about your family history you've make some progress

S0679	oh yes of course
S0681	i've get this it meet tomorrow and i can't remember if it's a lecture or a committee meet
S0679	i think it's at six
S0681	then it's a committee meet then it should be a committee meet then that's not so much of a problem it will be useful tomorrow afternoon if i do the roll display for the next erm lecture then i can
S0679	so you won't be free tomorrow afternoon
S0681	er no it's not that i can email it to to no no that doesn't matter
S0679	well i will have to go to tomorrow because i'm fairly sure let me just look cos the box be here i've find a few more pills because you know i make up those threes in a strip
S0681	mm
S0679	that i keep if i'm carry about oh i may actually i may i could possibly even go over on friday
S0681	uhu
S0679	to collect them so
S0681	i i've get i can go on thursday if you like
S0679	okay well be you you're come back here anyway be you
S0681	oh yeah yeah
S0679	you're not have lunch with these people
S0681	no we don't usually have lunch
S0679	well if you
S0681	not not as sociable as you
S0679	if you do have lunch with them you'd be over in roughly the right area wouldn't you
S0681	no no i we'd never have lunch
S0679	no no
S0681	never have lunch
S0679	okay so you'll come back and have some lunch here will you
S0681	yeah
S0679	and then we can
S0679	decide whether it's
S0681	what be that
S0679	best to erm i think it mean an email message have come on my computer
S0681	oh right
S0679	erm we can decide how we play it
S0681	right okay
S0679	because
S0681	that's fine
S0679	er my time for go over to be pharmacy dependent
S0681	yes okay and if i get spare time and the library's open i shoot across to the library oh i've gotta do erm try and do and 's fairy light as well
S0679	okay
S0681	i'm very very close to throw them in the bin now
S0679	i think that might be the most time time effective thing to do with them really
S0681	well i it's get personal now because i haven't be able to to suss the problem but i think it's either one of two things there's either an internal break in one of the wire in the control unit or it's a crack in the print circuit board controller so what i think i'm go to do i'm gonna replace all the wire in the control unit one by one and then cos what happen be i get it work then as i start close it up it stop work but if that happen i'll just say to them you know fine all the light work alright or i can make all the light work er but yes they're run off a four and a half volt battery you know or
S0679	mm
S0681	three triple a cells or something
S0679	be they put them outside
S0681	er i i don't know they might oh yeah i promise i've get i've get a little cheap set i pick up at the pound shop i say i'd let them use them at the erm christmas fair
S0679	which erm which er because i'm need to buy my secret santa present and i netto have a pound light for a pound
S0681	netto
S0679	netto the one that call the dog and basket
S0681	oh right i know what you mean
S0679	yellow and black
S0681	we haven't get one of them in have we
S0679	no we haven't but 's get one
S0681	oh right
S0679	cos it it it's own by sainsbury and it's actually on the same site as sainsbury
S0681	right
S0679	which seem a bite strange really
S0681	mm
S0679	erm anyway they have them for a pound but we didn't get round to go er well no er well i wasn't sure cos i've do light before
S0681	mm
S0679	but i do think they're a nice thing to normally you can
S0679	you can stick a few extra light up somewhere can't you anybody can
S0681	oh yeah yeah
S0679	i think erm
S0681	i still haven't make my giant christmas tree i be always gonna make mm
S0679	well let's not let's let's let's leave it for this year perhaps
S0679	christmas card
S0681	yes christmas card erm so we're we're talk about tomorrow and we've get basically please don't point at me i hate people point erm and it's obvious you're talk to me cos there's nobody else in the room erm tomorrow we've get tomorrow you're go out to your whatever it be and we're work out we're do something in the afternoon so that's alright
S0681	mm
S0679	erm friday i think you're free on friday so
S0681	mm
S0679	we could do it on friday if not
S0681	mm
S0679	erm or if it seem a i could go over to and then we could go over together and pick things up erm have you insulate the tap at erm
S0681	no isolate
S0679	insulate be the word the application of
S0681	wrap it with bubble wrap no i haven't
S0679	in in the old days it use to be the old sock
S0681	no i haven't
S0679	father be very keen on the old sock approach
S0681	yeah
S0679	but actually erm bubble wrap be what i use last year
S0681	no
S0679	okay ah er we need to take some with us although there's probably gonna be some there erm
S0681	really
S0679	and there might even be the thing i use last year if have to how how it get pull off erm okay erm you you mention christmas card do you see that i've get the first christmas card of the year arrive
S0681	oh be that yeah i guess it might be
S0679	the little square one
S0681	yeah
S0679	it's from who if he's in the country and he often go to erm vietnam or somewhere at christmas cos he have vietnamese in his in his blood
S0681	mm
S0679	erm i think with his sister they both sometimes go over erm but that that's arrive he always seem to like post them on the thirtieth of november which he may have do and he'd and i always think i'd really like to have my card out as early as his but i'm not compete this year because i know i can't erm what what thoughts have you have about christmas card
S0681	no just none i think i'd just panic for a bite
S0679	okay i maybe we'll put some think into that tomorrow morning
S0681	uhu
S0679	because alongside the christmas card be what we say in a letter and i need to be a little bite thoughtful about what i'm put in
S0681	oh i think i might leave that to you i'll i'll do some late night tonight i'll do some look around see if i can find find a picture
S0679	so you're think about make some in some way
S0681	well that's a possibility yeah but
S0679	uhu
S0681	it that depend on it depend on a lot of things it depend on the picture it depend on could i get some half decent paper which i probably can't anyway
S0679	you'll probably only get pack of ten or something
S0681	well it's either pack of ten or a ream you know but erm
S0679	if you can get anything what's a ream
S0681	five hundred sheet
S0679	one pack
S0681	five hundred sheet
S0679	five five pack
S0681	no five hundred individual sheet in a
S0679	yeah
S0681	ream
S0679	how many how many do you get in a photocopy pack
S0681	a ream
S0679	we normally buy possibly up to a hundred and fifty
S0681	mm
S0679	so if you could get good paper
S0681	yeah well it'll be worthwhile buy a ream to keep us go for a couple of years
S0679	if you think there might be two time your you want to do it again even if it's not next year it's worth think about if you could get something good
S0681	i haven't see it i i'll it's worth maybe on friday i'll have a stroll around cos there aren't that number of place there's staple rymans
S0679	i don't
S0681	and that's oh paperchase i suppose but their stuff tend to be very expensive
S0679	well it tend to be in in small packets
S0681	yeah
S0679	but i'd do web research rather than walk round
S0681	mm
S0679	then if anybody do have anything decent you can go and have a look at it
S0681	yeah i suppose so
S0679	erm
S0681	so do i look for ornamental paper or something
S0679	well just look up er everybody you know in paperchase the other ones you mention and just see what they sell
S0681	mm
S0679	erm or or i don't know if there's some more wholesale paper sort of place
S0681	i could actually i could go and see my mat at road couldn't i the printers i use
S0679	could ask the printers about it
S0681	yeah that's an idea cos they can get paper at ultra short notice as well
S0679	yeah
S0681	they literally phone up and have it deliver the next day
S0679	we may not need that much but i mean
S0681	well we have a minimum of a ream i'm sure
S0679	well yes but
S0681	yeah but they're quite friendly and quite helpful i've put a lot of work their way
S0679	it's worth think er it's worth think about i think even if
S0681	yes
S0679	you don't do it
S0681	that's a good idea actually
S0679	okay so it look as though you'll be i buy some card cos i always send some of
S0681	yeah yeah yeah
S0679	some individual card and the first individual card i might be write be one to
S0681	uhu
S0679	that we can take over if we go and see her sometime in the next few days with a poinsettia
S0681	uhu
S0679	can you think of any reason why it wouldn't be good to take her a poinsettia yet
S0681	well have we do it before
S0679	yes which sort of traditional
S0681	it sound sound fairly bore
S0679	it's sort of traditional
S0681	oh right okay
S0679	well er she's get a lovely home and
S0681	she do have a lovely
S0679	she she do tend to decorate it for christmas whether she will as much this year i want to get it early so she could enjoy it before christmas
S0681	oh
S0679	well they you know
S0681	okay
S0679	say well i buy one of those already but the one i buy die so it be quite nice you bring me another one
S0679	but she's get you know different room and
S0681	yeah
S0679	you know she's well not different room but
S0681	and a cat do the cat eat poinsettia
S0679	i don't know i imagine if if we take it round you would like to come
S0681	oh yes i'd like to
S0679	only and i it's nice it's a shame that wasn't able to visit when we be down last time cos we have it on a long list of things we might do because i do feel a little bite bad that we didn't talk to individually
S0679	about come to the funeral
S0681	uhu
S0679	cos she's not our friend more than 's friend but as things turn out erm it i i do feel i wish i'd check in with her
S0681	mm
S0679	but i didn't and
S0681	i i i wouldn't have think of do it so
S0679	mm cos you know i although you know it's it's difficult because er perhaps perhaps ought to take the lead on her friends
S0681	mm
S0679	but there be a bite of a slip up over some relatives
S0681	mm
S0679	which could have be a misunderstand on my part perhaps but i suspect it be on a list of things that be go to do but erm and she may not have do well it appear she didn't do erm but anyway er i don't know may not have want to come to the funeral i don't know
S0681	i don't think she know particularly well
S0679	no but just
S0681	she'd meet him or you think she might like to have come out in solidarity with sort of thing
S0679	well only that she have be involve in the family for fifty or more years
S0681	oh yes that's true isn't it indirectly via as well yeah
S0679	it's via
S0681	yeah yeah
S0679	so
S0681	yeah
S0679	i don't know when somebody in the family die
S0681	yeah
S0679	do you go i don't know if you're a longstanding family friend
S0681	i think typically you do yeah
S0679	but you would if it be in would you necessarily
S0681	if it be local local you certainly
S0679	yeah
S0681	you certainly would go but that much further away make it make it a bite more difficult i dunno
S0679	i don't know anyway we can't do anything about that but
S0681	no no water under the bridge
S0679	i feel i'd still like to maintain contact with
S0681	mm
S0679	and in that she send you a card
S0681	mm
S0679	admittedly it be you a card rather than me a card but it look as though she's keen to keep
S0681	mm
S0679	a card go obviously it be your birthday
S0681	it's be my birthday so she can hardly send you a card you prawn be she
S0679	no but you know
S0679	i mean send you a card but i wouldn't expect she'd send me one
S0681	mm
S0679	for example
S0681	mm
S0679	erm and just because you know she's do it to you it doesn't mean
S0681	well whatever
S0679	she want to do it for me but anyway i think one if we go early it will also set what we're do
S0681	right i need to put the bin out and do the wash up erm
S0679	okay well i'm i will assist i can do the wash up or i could probably
S0681	oh oh
S0679	i could do the dry up with the use
S0681	do you wanna put the bin out
S0679	no won't do the
S0681	no
S0679	put put the bin out
S0681	no right
S0679	i and we be go to do the service of the this afternoon
S0681	the service
S0679	you say you would service it
S0681	oh right okay
S0679	you say when i come back
S0681	i'll give a brush with the scrub brush
S0679	no not not a clean er it have the service instruction for
S0681	oh
S0679	check the brake and things
S0681	oh right oh i didn't know about that
S0679	well on that instruction leaflet it's very thorough
S0681	oh right okay
S0679	erm
S0681	do it need re grease like like six thousand kilometres
S0679	no it's the one that end with you need it if you want it disinfect it have to be do by a professional
S0681	oh you read that part out for me but you didn't read out the
S0681	service this
S0679	the the only thing be that erm it be a little bite stiff to
S0681	which where
S0679	when you unclip it and when you try and
S0681	to open it out you mean
S0679	you can open it out when you try and close it you have to almost yank the
S0681	right just
S0679	handle up
S0681	it just sound to me it's not be use for a long time
S0679	well i'd just like you to check it cos i don't want to be pull it inappropriately
S0681	yes you can
S0679	i do
S0681	tend to rip door handle off and things can't you or
S0679	i do check to make sure that i be erm i understand the mechanism
S0681	uhu
S0679	but i just wonder whether if it hadn't be use for a long time although i don't know quite i don't quite understand that er but it do look a bite dusty in place that it just might need lubricate a little or something
S0681	mm i won't do that this even but i will
S0679	no
S0681	i'll dust it over
S0679	no no no you shouldn't do any more cos you've do enough with that erm with that door
S0681	mm
S0679	but
S0681	bite of a pain that actually
S0679	yeah but it do need to go back on the list of things that to do because i would like it look at
S0681	uhu
S0679	i'd also like your opinion on when or you know i've get three small candle light they're not candle as in real flame you just put a battery and they light up
S0681	oh yeah i know yeah
S0679	one of them doesn't anymore but i think i i can't remember if it even come they may not the batteries may have be separate oh the batteries would have be in place probably one of those piece of plastic you pull out
S0681	that you pull out yeah
S0679	but there's a little screw and i think you might be able to get the battery out
S0681	oh well that's fairly simple
S0679	and i would like you to show me if that be the case
S0681	yeah
S0679	cos you i and we may er even have some batteries to fit on your big board
S0681	it might might be another one of this cr2032s which i the ones i get for my car key
S0679	oh right
S0681	cos i buy eight of those in one go from the pound shop
S0679	well if you've get a spare one of those then that would be
S0681	get a spare seven actually
S0679	yes erm well one of the others might need a go soon but
S0681	mm
S0679	if if if you've get a small screwdriver i'd like i think
S0681	i have many small screwdrivers
S0679	i think it's erm something i could do myself
S0681	oh
S0679	but i need instruction
S0681	oh
S0679	i didn't haven't get on very well with the watch battery thing yet but i think i should be able to do that
S0681	i've gotta do 's watch he's give me a watch to put back in unfortunately it's a it's a very peculiar strap cos normally i pin the bracelet off
S0679	mm
S0681	so you've get good access to the back but it's a funny one if you oh i don't really see it at aldi once they do a watch repair kit
S0679	mm
S0681	which be something silly like three pound fifty or something like that and i wish i'd buy one now because it have three or four it have an adjustable spanner a pin a push pin and for for just the odd funny little tool you need
S0679	mm
S0681	which might have be quite useful mm i might even look at the web see if there's one on the web
S0679	might be it's always possible
S0681	or i'll put it on my christmas card list you never know
S0679	yeah i don't know well not on your christmas card list cos you're not gonna send them a christmas card but you might put it on your
S0681	amazon wish list
S0679	christmas present list
S0681	yeah
S0679	erm
S0681	oh damn i must phone up i just remember
S0679	i be really at a loss as to what to put on my christmas card list er oh you've get me say it now my amazon wish list
S0681	i er book be yours a good thing i think
S0679	i well i don't i i mean i'm not get round to read
S0681	neither be i
S0679	book you know if i i'm not go to want to just get them and throw them away
S0681	no have you see any dvds you want film
S0679	well
S0681	cos there be a few you you you've acquire a few that you particularly want haven't you be there any more that you could put on
S0679	well if unless they're
S0681	cos dvds be easy to get you know
S0679	unless some really special one i'd rather borrow them to be honest
S0681	okay fine
S0679	because erm i don't really want to keep them
S0681	well the other issue be
S0679	you see
S0681	if you don't choose something something will be impose upon you
S0679	well i i do choose things last year and i still be give something
S0681	well i think they've buy that much earlier on with you in mind you know
S0679	well maybe
S0681	yeah yeah they have buy it
S0679	no they say no they say they'd buy it and they and they hadn't quite decide who to give it to
S0681	mm
S0679	and they
S0681	they buy it cos they like it
S0679	yeah
S0681	yeah
S0679	erm would it be if i mean the thing that i might like be a smartphone
S0681	mm
S0679	i mean in a way it would be nice
S0681	mm
S0679	it would suit my purpose more
S0681	mm
S0679	if they could give you a small contribution
S0681	mm
S0679	towards my smartphone
S0681	mm yeah think it would cost you about sixty quid for
S0679	cos i mean they
S0681	which be quite good
S0679	they give awfully generous present and if there be things that you want it's but i i mean i'd sort of be put things on a wish list at the moment unless i'm get great inspiration
S0681	mm
S0679	i mean i don't i mean i'm i my my life be quite you know i've get i would have need an mp3 player
S0681	well we sort that
S0679	but i need to get one and that's quite a big thing to put on even so isn't it
S0681	yeah
S0679	erm
S0681	yeah i can have a word with the two of them they're quite they're quite amenable to suggestion they'll much rather give you something you want
S0679	well it just seem like that would be something i'd i'd like
S0681	yeah
S0679	i mean i'd rather they didn't buy me a present anyway to be honest
S0681	well you can't avoid that i'm afraid they're like that mm
S0679	erm well i i i could i mean if they want to buy me something i could try and put some very small things on there
S0681	mm
S0679	do you think that would be helpful
S0681	yeah yeah we've get a present i think we've get a present from 's folks at their house
S0679	tea or jam
S0681	i don't see the point of that but she's very erm oh i think she's she feel i look after you know so i think cos i see quite a lot quite often
S0679	mm
S0681	i think she and i think the way i look after when she be very ill when she be
S0679	mm
S0681	she's get
S0679	so do you think we better make a start on this wash up
S0681	no i'll make a start on take the bin out
S0679	oh bin out and then wash up
S0681	yeah
