S0517	scanners we hadn't
S0558	yeah
S0517	have you use them
S0558	yeah once because be desperate to do it

S0558	yeah
S0517	but he do er but anyway we spend an absolute fortune but we do get oh well we do get six bottle of wine as well cos if you buy six it be twenty five percent off so
S0558	oh twenty five yeah

S0517	see if when the novelty wear off
S0558	yeah

S0517	i know he be
S0558	he hunt all the bargain
S0517	i know
S0558	where i just go in i'm on a mission i tend to pick the same things up week in week out

S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	oh what's in here
S0517	ah
S0558	or in tescos he doesn't
S0517	doesn't
S0558	in the home department
S0517	the bargain he just spot the expensive things
S0558	oh yeah no 's really good
S0517	tesco finest we always end up with when he's be shop
S0517	everything tesco finest
S0558	so yeah so 's gonna do the shop and at least then whilst he's do that you see i always use to on on a friday night i use to have my wash machine on the go and it all use to be wash and iron school uniform
S0517	mm
S0558	wash and iron and back in the wardrobe so of a weekend i didn't have to worry if i didn't wanna get the iron board out it wasn't a problem i'd do it on the monday
S0517	yeah
S0558	cos their at least their uniform be in the wardrobe but of course i don't get that luxury any more cos i'm sit at the blink all night
S0517	oh yeah
S0558	so i don't
S0517	yeah
S0558	and i'm very often come in from work myself at five half five so then by the time you do something to eat it's time to go trampolining
S0517	i know it's a pain it's a pain blink children
S0558	oh i know but i think to myself do you know it's not for long be it
S0517	no
S0558	they soon grow up and and i remember go from take to athletics three sometimes four time a week
S0517	to then have it not yeah to not do it at all
S0558	no just like that because pass her drive test and want to take herself
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	and felt
S0517	well that's what that'll be like with me with the tennis club once
S0558	yeah
S0517	well he's you know he's get another year yet but er
S0558	be he go to get a car then have he get plan to get a car
S0517	he have get plan to get a car because he's be he can't afford the insurance but he can he could afford the car cos he's have erm i suppose a a build society account
S0558	yeah
S0517	from when he be very little and er you know that's get i dunno probably about three thousand pound in it that be always specifically for a car
S0558	his car
S0517	really
S0558	oh right
S0517	and same as same as it be just the money that's go in there that be always specifically for to get a car
S0558	see and have but i think 's only and and this have just be you know if you get birthday money you don't really know what you want
S0517	yes put it in there
S0558	so you put some away and stuff like that
S0517	yeah and
S0558	i think they've only i think 's only get about eleven hundred
S0517	mm
S0558	but we've kind of never say that be for a car that's just kind of like a
S0517	it's just kind of there isn't it
S0558	yeah
S0517	it's there i know well i think we do sort of i mean we're we're not very good and probably won't go but we haven't save anything for university or anything like that but they're i mean they're they're very lucky my two cos my mum put them you know when my nan's house get sell
S0558	yes
S0517	the four sisters get a quarter each of the flat it be er yeah anyway mum have er she have about twenty five thousand pound from when nan sell her house
S0558	yeah
S0517	and she very kindly give all four grandchildren six thousand pound
S0558	oh
S0517	so there's six thousand pound that's already grow and i think we add i can't remember where it come from
S0558	didn't your dad leave some money for them
S0517	no we haven't have any money from dad yet because mum's still alive
S0558	oh
S0517	we haven't have anything
S0517	oh i know what it be we when they be bear you know we take out these baby bond
S0558	oh yes yeah
S0517	and they hadn't mature yet but the interest be so abysmal that when we'd see the financial our financial adviser he'd say do you know what
S0558	cash them in
S0517	cash em in and we'd be better off
S0558	that's what we do
S0517	do so er but because they we'd take one out for each of them we put that with their money from mum so the anyway in effect they've get about ten thousand pound each in junior isas i think they be or whatever they're in i don't know but the financial adviser be invest he say by the time that they're ready to use them that should be quite a nice sum so point of view we're think well that'll be a deposit on a house
S0558	yeah
S0517	or something like that
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	so they're very very lucky they've get those
S0558	yeah
S0517	haven't get anything towards further education but you know we'll worry about that if and when that happen and then they've get money in their build society account that they've have since they be bear
S0558	yeah
S0517	just like you say
S0558	that's grow
S0517	birthday money or you know
S0558	yeah
S0517	dad would put money in every year as pocket money like a lump sum just just grow that that we've always say we'll use that to buy a car with
S0558	mm
S0517	but obviously the insurance will be as much as the car
S0558	mm
S0517	so we'll end up do that
S0558	but there's these scheme you can get you know there's young driver scheme you can get
S0517	mm
S0558	people like erm motorhouse and people do them you know where like where i get my car from yeah
S0517	yeah
S0558	and they do like a young driver package
S0517	oh okay be that with the black box and things
S0558	i i don't know about a black box but er like you buy a car you buy a car and there's like a erm sort of an insurance scheme with it and all the rest of it
S0517	oh okay
S0558	so it's worth look into that sort of
S0517	oh okay right yes
S0558	the young drivers
S0517	well i mean obviously we're still twelve months away
S0558	yeah
S0517	because by the time he's turn seventeen and start learn how be 's lessons go
S0558	oh yes really enjoy them
S0517	good
S0558	but i tell you didn't i about the insurance
S0517	yes
S0558	yeah
S0517	it be about fifteen hundred just to add him to yours
S0558	yeah
S0517	mm it's a lot of money
S0558	that's just to add him to mine it would be same if he have his own car
S0517	yeah
S0558	erm so what we will probably end up do be things like lead up to the summer holiday we'll probably just insure him for a couple of months
S0517	right yes yeah when he need it yes
S0558	so he's get access to it when he need it
S0517	yeah
S0558	we've say to him if you if you be very definitely think of go to university there be no point
S0517	there's no point get a car
S0558	have a car
S0517	be there no cos they won't
S0558	no point at all
S0517	take it with em and then it's just
S0558	no
S0517	no
S0558	just sit on the drive then
S0517	and have he do he want to go to university
S0558	yeah
S0517	which one do he have he start look
S0558	erm his favourite at the moment be
S0517	to do what
S0517	what do he want to study
S0558	well initially he be think something more along the line of geographical
S0517	right
S0558	like geography research you know all that sort of thing
S0517	mm
S0558	geology type stuff
S0517	yeah
S0558	geographical that's the wrong word geology yeah but now he's think more whether to study history
S0517	oh be he do be he do history a level
S0558	he's do history geography biology and it
S0517	yes he didn't do business study do he
S0558	no he do it
S0517	mm
S0558	but he's think that's gonna be the one he's gonna drop
S0517	right
S0558	because we go to the school show
S0517	oh yes how be that
S0558	well it's the third time for the second time for the first time for me
S0517	oh okay
S0558	so they'd both see it before
S0517	yeah
S0558	and have not particularly be inspire on either visit
S0517	right
S0558	erm it's awful to say and wouldn't er oh i say to i wouldn't say it to and but if i er know what i know now
S0517	mm
S0558	if you know what i mean
S0517	yeah
S0558	if i be their age go to the nec school show
S0517	yes
S0558	i'd be come away think a little bite disillusion
S0517	mm
S0558	be that it kind of thing don't get me wrong there be some there be some good sort of workshops set up so if you want to go down the trade of plumb painter and decorator bricklayer that sort of thing there be an actual sort of situation set up you couldn't access it but you could see what sort of
S0517	oh okay
S0558	work environment you would be in
S0517	right
S0558	kitchens as well cater they've get you know
S0517	oh okay
S0558	er proper
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	kitchens
S0517	gosh i don't remember that cos i go last year i don't remember that be there
S0558	yeah it be up right up
S0517	mind you that's not something 's ever show an interest in so we but it be it's quite spread out the section
S0558	yes yeah
S0517	we've possibly avoid it
S0558	yeah
S0517	because oh okay
S0558	so i think that be good because for people look in that area
S0517	mm
S0558	they can get a real feel
S0517	yeah
S0558	for what it's all about but if you want to be a hairdresser or a beautician or a florist it be just a stand
S0517	yeah
S0558	but you know you you could go to any local hairdressers or florists and say
S0517	and get the same yes
S0558	can i come and stand in here for a day and
S0517	yeah i think there be quite a mix mishmash when i be there last year of some company that seem really gear up like people like er jp what's it er be they call jp morgan
S0558	jp morgan the bank
S0517	yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	you know really gear up to er talk to them as prospective apprentice and you know they have the current apprentice there and it be all you know and others it be just really wishy washy and nothing substantial
S0558	mm yeah
S0517	i don't know
S0558	that's how i felt a bite
S0517	mm and and i think as well it be very low budget
S0558	yeah
S0517	and i think when i've ever obviously i've only ever be to exhibitions on a from a business point of view where you've get company spend mega amount of money
S0558	yes yeah
S0517	on fantastic stand to woo customers
S0558	yeah
S0517	because it's all about business whereas this
S0558	yeah
S0517	there's no money involve this be just but that's for students and er it's certainly reflect in the overall look and layout
S0558	yeah
S0517	and even the
S0558	yeah
S0517	light be bad
S0558	i know that that's it you know
S0517	it just be it be drab as a show
S0558	mm
S0517	i find it very and i and as soon as i walk in i think oh this be dreadful but er you know i sort of have to stop myself and think okay you've only ever be to exhibitions that you've exhibit at
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	you've spend thousands on the space and the stand and it's all the latest you know you're try to get customers
S0558	yeah
S0517	this be not that at all
S0558	and you have you have to put yourself in the shoe
S0517	and you have to put that
S0558	of a sixteen year old
S0517	yeah yeah yeah
S0558	don't you yeah
S0517	but certainly there be you know
S0558	yeah
S0517	there be a huge difference i think in in the er what's the word i don't know just just how they pitch to the students
S0558	mm
S0517	and the quality of them
S0558	yeah it wasn't inspire i didn't think
S0517	no
S0558	i we we must've be in and out in an hour
S0517	well we
S0558	we spend longer have a cup of coffee afterwards
S0517	do you
S0558	and a hot chocolate
S0517	well the thing that take from it last year when we go be that if if you go down the route of want an apprenticeship you're much better off get your a level behind you
S0558	so
S0517	and get your and get a better level of apprenticeship
S0558	yes
S0517	just from talk to a few people they all say the same
S0558	yeah
S0517	that if you've get gcses mm yeah okay it's fine if you've get a level it's just be much much better
S0558	see you do more than us because i wasn't even interest in talk to anybody
S0517	oh
S0558	cos i say to them when we go in look if you see something that catch your eye
S0517	mm
S0558	just say and we'll stop and we'll go and talk to them
S0517	but you have to you have to
S0558	but i'm not gonna
S0517	yeah
S0558	keep say to you
S0517	mm
S0558	because when you ignore me or reject me or say no thank you
S0517	yeah
S0558	i i feel like it's all a waste of time
S0517	yes
S0558	so if you're inspire let me know and we'll we'll talk to them and he didn't
S0517	say anything no
S0558	nothing neither of them
S0517	well i don't think well it be only and i take so the three of us go i dunno where be erm and er would've be the same
S0558	mm
S0517	but we literally take him by the hand and make him talk to people
S0558	yes
S0517	and do you know what i be please we go because i don't know if you remember we have find out about it by accident and do you remember it be say that their school they be put on a busload and take them
S0558	that's right yeah
S0517	and erm and i say well that's that's madness why isn't our school do it and it turn out our school do do it but it be just by invitation only and i be really quite annoy cos i think well be and i at that point we weren't sure if he be even gonna do a level
S0517	and i remember be a little bite annoy think he would've be an ideal candidate to go on that school trip to the school show why why didn't he get invite
S0558	yeah
S0517	what you know what basis do they and i be bite annoy that he hadn't go however after we have be i say to i'm so glad we take him because if he be there with his mat they he wouldn't've speak to a soul
S0558	no
S0517	and it would've be a complete waste of a day
S0558	yeah
S0517	but we take him and you know 'd say well how about this we'll just go and talk to them cos they're available
S0558	yeah
S0517	and there be two or three that he come away and you could see he be a bite interest or he'd listen to what they'd say
S0558	mm
S0517	we do the erm i don't know whether you saw it in the business section there be one where you could go and pitch an idea to a couple of people it be a bite like dragon's den
S0517	so they have a table full of object and you have to just basically choose one of the object compose yourself for two or three minutes
S0517	and then basically do a sales pitch to these two they be lovely lovely girls actually and erm they be really enthusiastic and be go to do it and then he no no no you know i didn't want to he be all shy and everything and so they say er do it as a family come on so the three of us end up do a pitch for some
S0558	oh
S0517	ski hat have choose but once he get into it like we sort of start him off and once he get into it you know he be fine and he be
S0558	he be yeah
S0517	and they give him feedback and but it be the sort of thing that we come away and i say if if he'd've go with the school it would've be a waste
S0558	yeah
S0517	an absolute waste
S0558	i think perhaps they get more involve on the two previous
S0517	yeah
S0558	well the first time go with when they they be at a car show with and
S0517	oh i remember you say
S0558	do you remember
S0517	and they just sort of saw it and go in as a
S0558	yeah
S0558	the second time last year take them both whilst i be out with and this year obviously me
S0517	yeah
S0558	so i think they may've speak to people last time but they wasn't interest this time the only one thing do come away
S0517	do they say it be the same same company there each year
S0558	yeah they say it they say it be no different
S0517	no different
S0558	erm the one thing do come away with be that excuse me he say he think he definitely doesn't wanna go into it
S0517	oh really

S0517	yeah
S0558	we just don't know do we really what
S0517	no what
S0517	no
S0558	i mean where be i i be somewhere but this link onto what i'm about to say anyway it's like for example christmas birthdays at one time you could buy a dictionary you could buy a bedside alarm clock you could buy a torch
S0517	oh i know
S0558	you could buy a compass you could buy a calculator
S0558	you could buy they're all in one device now
S0517	your phone yeah yeah
S0558	and i think
S0517	soon that'll all be on your wrist
S0558	in the work world yeah in the work world it's the same the amount of stuff that be now do by computers and there be just people either just there press the button
S0517	oh yeah yeah
S0558	you know in the work world i think it's go to become limit so there's gonna have to we're gonna have to find other ways and mean of earn money in order to live
S0517	well
S0558	but i don't know
S0517	don't know what they might be yet no
S0558	because do you know this be fact
S0517	oh go on
S0558	i learn this
S0558	by two thousand and thirty five
S0517	right
S0558	so it's not that far away be it
S0517	yeah twenty odd years twenty years yeah
S0558	the average population of people one hundred age one hundred
S0517	oh
S0558	live in this country
S0517	go on
S0558	i don't know if it's the world or the country actually
S0517	probably the country
S0558	probably the country i think one hundred thousand
S0517	how many be there now
S0558	i don't know
S0517	i'll be one of them oh no i won't hundred erm
S0558	erm yeah one hundred thousand people
S0517	gosh
S0558	the age one hundred by two thousand and thirty five so the population be increase
S0517	yeah
S0558	the work demand be get smaller we need to find new ways of live
S0517	i know
S0558	because there's not gonna be the job out there keep tell us i say keep she's mention it a couple of time at school at the moment they must be learn about erm er sort of pattern in erm oh god what's it call when you generations yeah
S0517	oh okay yeah
S0558	yeah and at the moment we our generation there's a lot of us
S0517	mm
S0558	and their generation be very few
S0517	be it
S0558	apparently so so they be gonna be heavily load with tax and things
S0517	oh gosh
S0558	in order to look after us
S0517	mm
S0558	and then the generation that's come behind 's
S0517	mm
S0558	i know twofold they be gonna miss out they be gonna after we increase
S0517	oh increase yeah
S0558	their tax et cetera to pay for us and then i think when they get to that sort of age again the er the population be less so they'll suffer
S0517	right well i mean
S0558	i can't remember now
S0517	okay er maybe in age the population's not get less be it cos of all the immigration
S0558	no no no no
S0517	but
S0558	well yeah
S0517	maybe the age the sort of the baby
S0558	yes the yeah the yeah that yeah
S0517	yeah
S0558	the baby boom and everything
S0517	cos i know erm mum when she visit nan the other day she be talk to one of the staff in the home and she say she say well just to let you know i be off to new zealand for two and a half months erm i do think my mother might pass away when i be on holiday in new zealand last time but that be three years ago

S0517	i know
S0558	age a hundred that be go to have to be look after
S0517	yes
S0558	by the family or
S0517	and if if if nan wasn't well if nan wasn't look after she wouldn't've last this long but i mean she's literally she's feed she's wash she's dress they turn her so that she doesn't get bedsores but she doesn't get out of bed

S0517	neither of them can speak neither they both sleep
S0558	you do go full circle don't you

S0558	yeah
S0517	it's like the you know with the
S0517	the hundred year old and the and the week old and it be so similar and say yes but you feel so much more uplift when you come away from visit the baby don't you and i say yes you do

S0558	good
S0517	but er but no i do know what you mean but then on the other hand with the whole age thing er er you know you'd listen to the news another day and there's so many obese people that and it's put so much pressure on the nhs that everybody's just gonna die of all their obesity relate diseases
S0558	mm
S0517	so i don't i can't i can never work out how
S0558	predictions be there's an element
S0517	how it work out really
S0558	i know there's statistics you can do anything with figure
S0517	yeah
S0558	can't you facts and er figure and it's all about statistics and pattern and all the rest of it but who know nobody know
S0517	yeah
S0558	nobody can make all these predictions of this that and the other we could have a blink pandemic be that the word next week
S0517	oh yeah well
S0558	you don't know wipe load of people out and
S0517	it be funny when we last saw our
S0558	we just don't know
S0517	financial adviser who we don't see very often but occasionally and erm he be say that he'd be er he'd attend a conference fairly recently do i tell you and he he say the erm the speaker be really interest i think it be er a a doctor a medical doctor that er they have at the open speaker or something at their conference say that basically er you know medicine have really come on you know leap and bound and they can keep people alive now you know we're all live longer they can do marvellous things you know with all the transplant and everything else and they be then talk er he be talk about you know erm farmers and food and how we can genetically modify our food and we can change all of this and you know the whole thing he say so erm basically er we're all live longer we've all get the food to sustain us but frankly we can't afford to live longer so over to you lot cos it be the it be the er the conference of the financial advisers
S0558	right
S0517	how be you lot gonna now fund the fact that you know it's like
S0558	yeah
S0517	we've do our job the doctor the farmers be do theirs the duh duh duh scientists be do theirs how be you lot gonna fund it and er he say yeah we didn't really have an answer cos
S0558	no that's right isn't it
S0517	you know you stop work in your sixties or even seventy and then you've gotta last
S0558	sixty seven be it now official retirement
S0517	yeah
S0558	sixty seven
S0517	all that money's gotta last thirty years
S0558	i know
S0517	forty years if nan's gonna be a hundred and five i'll probably be a hundred and ten
S0558	god
S0558	oh dear me i dunno if i'd want to be live like your nan be
S0517	i wouldn't absolutely not
S0558	i'd rather go at
S0517	and so er yeah
S0558	oh i'm not even gonna say an age just in case
S0517	no
S0558	but you know
S0517	no she have a really really good life until she be ninety seven and that you know and what's wrong with that
S0558	ninety seven
S0517	ninety seven she be still live on her own but then you know it really go downhill so now it's just like a really long slow death it really be
S0558	it's awful isn't it
S0517	it be awful
S0558	this be where you should be allow to have an injection or make a decision
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	for somebody to have an injection
S0517	definitely definitely cos
S0558	mm
S0517	it's not you know no quality of life it be a shame but as i keep tell my mum there's nothing we can do they're not change it they just she keep say why do they keep feed her i say because they have to
S0558	they have to
S0517	it's a duty of care
S0558	yeah i know
S0517	but if she live on her own she wouldn't be here and then it'd be so much better for she say oh she'd hate it if she could see herself
S0558	yeah
S0517	you know she would hate it
S0558	she would yeah
S0517	cos she be always very you know careful with her appearance and
S0558	mm
S0517	you know like most people
S0558	mm
S0517	it's just a loss of dignity isn't it
S0558	it's awful
S0517	it be she just she
S0558	she's not communicate with anybody
S0517	no
S0558	she's not get any pleasures of entertainment
S0517	nothing she just she just sleep
S0558	it's awful isn't it
S0517	not you know she's not even watch the telly
S0558	no
S0517	just sleep lie in the bed day and night
S0558	awful
S0517	very depress
S0558	she's probably not even aware which thankfully cos she's sleep so much she's not aware of how long she's in bed hopefully
S0517	maybe well five years now
S0517	and i don't think she's be out of that room for
S0558	i mean the thing be now as well it's like she's in this silent world as well
S0517	yeah
S0558	really inspire i be at erm hospital last week and there be a lady who be obviously profoundly deaf who have get an appointment
S0517	mm
S0558	and er the gist of the conversation with the lady who be with her be erm basically like your when she's qualify erm i don't know whether it go through a central point of wherever but a call be request that you know er a lady have get an appointment she need an interpreter
S0517	okay yeah
S0558	so they meet at the hospital and she go into the appointment with her and do all the sign language
S0517	and do the sign language yeah
S0558	and all the rest of it and i think oh
S0517	oh see that's the sort of thing 'd like to do
S0558	yeah
S0517	when she's erm
S0558	yeah
S0517	i don't know how easy that be to do or how qualify you need to be
S0558	well i think
S0517	cos 's she's only do the first
S0517	i suppose the first level
S0558	right
S0517	there be a lot of level and if it's medical stuff i don't know but she would like to or go into school and
S0558	yeah
S0517	help but i don't know how she's go to go about it i don't think she yet
S0558	be she go to be do any childcare for eventually do you think cos that'll limit her won't it
S0517	quite possibly
S0558	do you think
S0517	i don't know whether any of that's be all sort of set in stone because i think i know have voice to me i don't think she's say it to yet but obviously she's more than happy to have but you know what she's like come may she want to go on holiday for three months
S0558	yeah
S0517	and so she doesn't want to be commit to
S0558	no i and i can fully understand that
S0517	two or three you know couple of days a week be fine when it suit her
S0558	when it suit her yeah
S0517	but not when she want to go to their place in bulgaria for three months in the summer
S0558	personally on a long term basis because 's not gonna be able to phone up a nursery and say can i book in for the next two weeks or the next month

S0517	he's just this be not for me i say this be not for me
S0517	i don't know about you i'm out here with my coat and my umbrella
S0517	and there be a girl you know she have her she'd obviously just run and she have her foot out and her ankle be swell up and st john's ambulance be tend to her we saw about three girls cry
S0517	like that have run whether they be cry cos
S0558	goodness me
S0517	they hadn't do as well as they want i don't know whatever so i say to him and we could see it get muddier and muddier and muddier and i say i say i'm not be funny you're not gonna win this race i say and you wanna play football tomorrow just get round the course don't just don't get round without injure yourself so he go for the start line and i could see him in the corner and i think oh i'll try and take a picture to show but i be not put my umbrella down
S0558	mm
S0517	so i be try to do it one hand it be a disaster they all start run and i think well where be he where be he where be he he be right at the very very back i think that's not like i know there be eighty people
S0517	that's not like he be right at the back well at the end it turn out i find out he'd fall over on the start line
S0517	he slip over in the mud on the start line
S0558	oh bless him
S0517	so i watch him go off cos you know he can he's get stamina and he can run but i watch him go off and he do overtake a handful of people and then i sort of position myself you could see most of the course it be up and down hill and then i position myself at the finish stretch and i could make him out and i think he be right at the back but you know that's okay so these two lads go past it be a sprint finish they be do then i mean i wasn't count but maybe tenth fifteenth place this lad run past puke up i mean he have his
S0558	oh
S0517	head turn to one side and be literally be sick i think i i have no one to speak to i be there on my own i just think why be you still run why you're not even gonna win
S0558	no it's it's something to do with lactic acid no no that no that's not it happen all the time at athletics right
S0517	do it
S0558	yeah they'll be run yeah and er basically they they just put so much pressure on their body
S0517	oh
S0558	i dunno i dunno if it's lactic acid it's anyway it's hilarious because you just see them i and i mean i tell you it's spine tingle some of the athletes down at
S0558	the speed they travel
S0517	mm
S0558	it's spine tingle and they'll just get to the end or whatever they'll go over to side puke up
S0517	well
S0558	give a sort of acknowledgement
S0558	so somebody know to go down
S0517	mm
S0558	with a bucket of bucket bucket of water
S0517	and then they're and they're fine
S0558	and then they carry on
S0517	well er he be puke as he run past me
S0517	i think that be vile
S0558	oh vile
S0517	so eventually come in right and bless him he be seventy fifth out of eighty
S0558	oh
S0517	so he'd say i'm not gonna come last i say no that's fine you're not gonna come last but he be seventy fifth so they he take his thing and the man from organise it just say to him that be fantastic he say that you get round that course he say i'm tell you he say you haven't get spike on your feet have you he say no he say i'm tell you the best runner wouldn't've come top fifty in these condition without spike on their feet the fact that you've get round in the time that you have be fantastic
S0558	be good
S0517	so he mum i don't wanna do that again i say no nor me so
S0558	doesn't do cross country
S0517	we go home we go home and we get back at about four o'clock and literally as we be pull onto the drive the rain stop and it clear up you know and then i think the next night er all the score come through and i think the winners have do it in thirteen minutes and have take sixteen minutes he say he'd fall over four time and one of the time be when he be go up one of the hill and he'd slide down
S0517	which you shouldn't laugh i mean you could see why there be girls cry at the end
S0558	oh
S0517	he wasn't cry and do you know he be barely even really out of breath but he say he couldn't get he couldn't run he couldn't get go but
S0558	well no because he'd just be slip with flat
S0517	i say to him i say four hours we be out of this house and sixteen minutes you be run
S0558	do you know
S0558	it's like when you go when you go to a competition right admittedly you do only have to be there an hour before
S0517	right
S0558	but the field events generally start off and you'll have hurdle go at the same time
S0558	so if be do javelin for example maybe if the competition open at ten
S0517	yeah
S0558	you need to be there for nine or ten thirty be there for nine thirty
S0517	mm
S0558	she might do javelin at eleven as an example and then she always end up be in the relay which be the last competition of the day
S0517	oh it's always i remember you say that in the past
S0558	so you're there all day
S0517	all day i know
S0558	and when the weather's nice don't get me wrong it's
S0517	it's nice
S0558	you take a picnic and like and and
S0517	but oh
S0558	you know we'll all sit there and we have a laugh and you know it there's some really nice people er that be part of athletics so the day be great
S0517	yeah
S0558	it's good fun
S0517	well yeah
S0558	but when
S0517	it's rain
S0558	it's rain and cold
S0517	oh
S0558	and
S0517	miserable
S0558	it's completely the opposite
S0517	but it be just so i'd send i send erm an email to mr the pe department and i just
S0558	don't ever send us there again
S0517	no i just because he'd wish him luck and he be the only one from
S0517	from the school that have be compete people have drive up from i mean be the inter county ones there be they'd come from all over but i think god why would you come all that way if all take be like thirteen minutes to run it
S0558	yeah
S0517	but anyway
S0558	but yeah
S0517	that's me i'm not a sport person i haven't get the mentality
S0558	yeah
S0517	but i send him a i just send him an email say look er erm we do take him it wasn't it wasn't our finest moment it and erm i say it turn out he wasn't properly kitted out so our apologies he didn't have the right things on his feet erm i say all he really want be a school tie a cos you know i tell you about
S0558	the county tie
S0517	the county tie

S0558	this be the government
S0517	i say that to
S0558	absolutely
S0517	i say i say do we do we think our children be erm you know if they get fingerprint now when they're at school when they do something naughty later in life they'll be able to find out
S0558	well it can also eliminate them remember but i do think this be the government encourage this system
S0517	mm
S0558	by ways of because eventually cos you know they be talk about id card and a lot of people be er oppose it
S0517	yeah
S0558	well this be the same casual way
S0517	it's the same thing isn't it i know
S0558	isn't it
S0517	i know
S0558	eventually everybody that go through school they'll have
S0517	oh yes yeah absolutely
S0558	i tell you my
S0517	er well 's have erm
S0558	things be work again
S0517	the cash the er the 's get some sort of fingerprint system for one of the holiday park i forget what it's for but they've have a few people complain
S0558	mm
S0517	about not er er
S0517	not even about the fingerprint just about stupid things like well not stupid but cross contamination you know if somebody's get a a cold and they put their finger on and then the next person put their finger on or somebody's allergic to
S0558	i can understand that
S0517	or if somebody well yes somebody's allergic to nut and the person that's just swipe through but i mean you touch everything all the time don't you
S0558	well you touch everything it's no different to touch a machine
S0517	yeah
S0558	in the gym or wherever be it or er
S0517	or the handrail as you're go up the stairs
S0558	anything yeah so
S0517	over the top but erm
S0558	it be a bite over the top but at easygym i have notice that when you register
S0517	mm
S0558	a picture of you come up and your detail i don't know whether i like that
S0517	well yes but it's the same when you go to virgin and when it be a as soon as you swipe your card through
S0558	but that's only for the
S0517	your picture's for them to see isn't it
S0558	for the staff to see
S0517	oh it come up
S0558	yeah this be like as you walk up the stairs you could look at the screen and i could see
S0517	oh
S0558	we've just book in if i'd get my glass on
S0517	oh what sort of detail
S0558	date of birth and everything
S0517	oh really oh no i wouldn't be happy with that
S0558	no so when they register i'm gonna i'm gonna take my glass next time i go and i'm gonna look and if there's information on there i don't like like address and date of birth i'm gonna ask for it to be remove for and and i don't want it because it's there
S0558	until the next person book in
S0517	oh really
S0558	i don't like that
S0517	that's not a very good system
S0558	er particularly when have stuff take out of his locker
S0517	yeah no
S0558	so there be
S0517	you should have a word with about that
S0558	yes i'm gonna have a word before he log me on
S0517	but all of the security and the implications aside it's a bite of a pain for us because if you remember 's mother give us bag and bag of cash for the dinner money for the boys she go to the bank and get pound coin
S0558	oh do she
S0517	ten get ten pound a week whatever year he's in and seven pound a week
S0558	for their lunch
S0517	for their lunch every week and she give it er to us in bag of cash now i just hand it over because she's adamant he's to get ten pound a week and then he's get some money for dinners if he need it she's adamant so i hand it but he doesn't always spend it on school dinner money
S0558	so he get like forty pound a month from his
S0517	from his granny for for his lunch
S0558	she's so lovely isn't she
S0517	she be she be when you've get eight grandchildren it's a lot
S0558	be she out of hospital now be everything alright
S0517	yes she come out on erm
S0558	oh good good
S0517	friday yes so but but from our point of view i'm not sure how that's gonna work unless we just give her their bank detail and say well keep give it to them and then they can have their card register cos they've get little current account
S0558	yeah
S0517	just you know that they put their paper round money into and stuff
S0558	yeah
S0517	and then because if i if it's come off my i don't know how it's gonna work because they get their dinner money from granny in pound coin but they don't always spend it on
S0558	dinner money
S0517	like take sandwich
S0558	well say to me he think he might no say to me she think she might start take sandwich again
S0517	well take sandwich but sometimes he'll have a sausage roll or a few potato wedge or or if he's stop for something after school and it's gonna be longer
S0558	yeah
S0517	he might buy himself something at break and have his sandwich and then he won't be so starve
S0558	like today
S0517	on a monday with his referee course but so it's a it's it's a pain for us the cashless system we'll just have to work out how to do it with erm the money she give them
S0558	yeah well if they want the form back by wednesday i'd better sit and read it properly i know 's glance at it
S0517	all the all the form be cos i send it back with and you can do one for both of them you basically just put their name on the form and and and sign it to say you agree
S0558	cos say to me cos i say oh i don't know if i like that idea she say well if you if you're against it if you write in and then if enough parent write in to say they're against it they won't be able to do it
S0517	oh okay
S0558	mm
S0517	mm
S0558	good point
S0517	well do have a and then we sort of we sign it and send it back
S0558	well i still haven't get round and i be go to do it this morning and i haven't i still think it be wrong that we should be pay for the boys to go to and from school
S0517	oh i know
S0558	because it's compulsory education
S0517	i know education i know but who be you gonna write to the council the the the
S0558	well initially i'd phone the lady up
S0517	the the in the transport department
S0558	our contact
S0558	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0517	yeah you can yeah
S0517	erm
S0558	erm and say i know we're a couple of months in and it's just you know what it's like you always think you're gonna do it the next day
S0517	yeah
S0558	but i just think it's wrong that they should have to pay
S0558	because it be compulsory i can understand if they choose to stop on
S0517	to stop on in the sixth form
S0558	then that's different
S0517	yeah
S0558	but it's compulsory education and down the road she get her money back she
S0517	who do
S0558	down the road
S0517	oh do she
S0558	claim get the money back for her boys go to college
S0517	how
S0558	well
S0517	be that just because they're a low income family
S0558	well i don't know be they he's on a fairly good pension i believe so i don't know if they be
S0517	do they use to get free dinners no
S0558	not that i'm aware of
S0517	that's usually the
S0558	yeah not that i'm aware of
S0517	have you not ask her how she claim it back
S0558	no i need to ask her
S0517	you do really
S0558	because i remember hear her her phone ring and sometimes i just work the walk the length of the church if we come out the same time
S0517	yeah
S0558	and erm i hear her say but yeah it's a lot of money isn't it transport there and back every day blah blah blah blah
S0517	where do they get the bus to where's the college
S0558	well i think they get the bus to
S0517	right
S0558	or drop em
S0517	yeah
S0558	and then they get pick up by the college bus from
S0517	oh okay okay
S0558	but to and from every day she's have to pay
S0517	well it's one pound twenty same as we pay cos it's the standard
S0558	yeah but i think she's claim it back she get it reimburse
S0517	well you do need to find out how then
S0558	i do
S0517	fifty quid a month isn't it
S0558	it's a lot of money
S0517	fifty quid a month
S0558	i know

S0558	yeah
S0517	actually have to do a secret santa last year but he hasn't mention it this year
S0558	oh he could get that from there
S0517	yeah well it depend if it's a man or a woman it's usually just
S0517	he he get tell who he be buy for last year
S0558	be this
S0517	and then i go out and buy obviously
S0558	be he enjoy his job
S0517	er yes he be he be erm
S0558	mm
S0517	it's just all the drive really
S0558	mm
S0517	that he doesn't like and he doesn't like stay away from home much but he his enjoy the job
S0558	mm
S0517	yeah i don't know how long he'll stay he be talk about in the spring look for something else just for those reason the drive and stop away from home but one of the other senior management team have leave recently and the chairman not the chairman the chief exec whoever 's boss be the chief exec
S0558	the man who be employ the same time as
S0517	yes
S0558	yeah
S0517	the scottish man yes er have be say you know as soon as the the hr director have leave he be sort of sound out cos er apparently they're put together some plan to float the business and and the chief exec's base his all of his thing on have a stable senior management team
S0558	oh right
S0517	so he doesn't want them to be leave so he be try to sound out be he go to get a job so say obviously i didn't say it i i be maybe think about it because that would just be madness at this stage but he be also tempt him with you know once we've have the once it's float you know there will be an opportunity for you to be give some equity in the business and you know how they dangle these carrots don't they
S0558	mm
S0517	to try and keep you there so
S0558	but do they want an investment in return
S0517	i don't think they do i think it be
S0558	no
S0517	just gonna be a you know an issue of share
S0558	right
S0517	for him
S0558	yeah
S0517	er i i don't really know i mean it's not happen yet but
S0558	so be the family think of sell then when you say float be the family think of sell
S0517	no i don't think they're sell i think it's just a way of of raise some extra money to do some more erm renovation work i think
S0558	mm
S0517	i don't really know i don't think they're they're ever gonna sell it as such just float it on the
S0558	right
S0517	stock exchange but they would still have the majority of the shareholdings i think i don't know so it be one of those whereby you could say he could see that he be just try to sound him out
S0558	mm
S0517	and also dangle a carrot because he's base all of his strategy on have a stable senior management team
S0558	yeah
S0517	and of course 's his right hand man really as the
S0558	yeah
S0517	operations manager so anyway we'll see
S0558	yeah
S0517	but it be it's just the drive he's do a lot do about a hundred thousand miles on that car and it's not three years old yet
S0558	mm
S0517	it's a very good car though
S0558	i be gonna say it's a good car though it'll

S0558	no
S0517	i mean it have its oil change and it it have new tyres and that's be about it
S0558	and if you think the majority majority be motorway anyway which be

S0517	yeah
S0558	isn't it
S0517	yeah that's true
S0558	you know like it might be clock the mileage up but
