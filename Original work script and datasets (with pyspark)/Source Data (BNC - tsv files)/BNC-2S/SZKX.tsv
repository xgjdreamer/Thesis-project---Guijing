S0456	mm
S0465	there be seventeen he have a little bite er not problem but he have to wait for the to get the visa
S0456	mm
S0465	because he i think he mention that he apply to they ask the the
S0456	mm
S0465	you know the kurdish authorities tell them for
S0456	yeah
S0465	for a visa use his iraqi passport
S0456	rather than his
S0465	he tell them that yeah his british one and er
S0456	yeah
S0465	he apply for the visa and the iraqi passport holders er those whose who don't have dual nationalities
S0456	mm yeah
S0465	not dual nationalities they get it very quick the visa
S0456	yeah
S0465	er back very quick but
S0456	yeah because he's er
S0465	and er too because he he have already bring a british passport as well so
S0456	yeah
S0465	they take a lot i think he he say that sixteen days fifteen days sixteen days something like this

S0465	and he only have like two days before
S0456	uh oh
S0465	yeah so send they email me to say that well the visa be ready now and he have to go to
S0456	mm
S0465	er
S0456	mm
S0465	to the american consulate there
S0456	mm
S0465	er so he he eventually he manage to get there because er when i
S0465	when i saw he be in in america you know
S0456	yeah it's still quicker than get a visa for the soviet er russia
S0465	yeah
S0456	it's still soviet style it's it's unbelievable
S0465	erm er russia again be one of the countries that like doesn't appeal to me
S0456	oh hit's
S0465	i don't i don't i don't i don't know why i mean for a visit it er it to me be a a little bite scary
S0456	mm
S0465	maybe it's not like this you know but
S0456	mm they probably think you're georgian
S0465	probably yeah
S0456	erm yeah despite be a multicultural state they they they they retain their prejudice and they keep again yeah it's the people from the southern state because you know they have like you sort of more olive type skin
S0465	yeah
S0456	and they be keep in sort of the more menial job
S0465	yeah
S0456	et cetera but erm no i mean the russians i i just like them and you know you wouldn't go there for the weather
S0465	yeah i wouldn't no
S0456	er yeah
S0465	and apparently moscow be very expensive as well
S0456	yeah avoid moscow erm
S0465	cos a friend of mine go there one of er his relatives be er live there and he mention that er apparently it's really expensive
S0456	it's it's it's in the firm grip of the oligarchs erm but yeah i mean even saint petersburg which be the second city and that's you know it's not expensive
S0465	saint petersburg be not very far from finland be it
S0456	no no we go by erm on the ferry
S0465	yeah
S0456	and in one visa trip which be great because for seventy six hours and it's specifically for those ferry trip
S0465	yeah
S0456	you can go so you spend two nights and the hotel be actually own by the by the finnish tour operators
S0465	yeah
S0456	so
S0465	do you still need visa to travel
S0456	not for seventy six hours
S0465	oh right okay
S0456	erm but yeah even the fin need visa er i think theirs be more easily process but i don't know but i think with with a schengen passport you're better off than with a british passport with a british passport you have to go to the to london because they want biometrics
S0465	oh right
S0456	they just think everybody's jam bond
S0465	mm oh right yeah
S0465	wasn't there do you know in the second world war i think the take a massive chunk of their land be take by russia wasn't it er finland er
S0456	well not a massive one but yeah it's er give that until the revolution all of finland be actually russian it's
S0465	yeah
S0456	yeah erm if you look because when we be in saint petersburg we go to a museum that be dedicate to the second world war and the siege of
S0465	mm
S0456	as it be leningrad
S0465	yeah
S0456	you just look at the map and you know why they've do it because the germans be in finland
S0465	yeah
S0456	and without that bite they would've have too easy access to get there but
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm so that it it be like a buffer zone
S0465	mm
S0456	and of course anything that the soviet union get in those days they didn't want to give back do they
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm and you know the the the way the war go back and forth and they have a civil war on top of everything else erm yeah it it be slightly traumatic but yeah like the like the dutch then
S0465	yeah
S0456	the fin keep go on about it's like well you know see what you've do
S0456	erm
S0456	they're they're still and you now they say ah well you know we've be occupy by by germany but unlike denmark yeah they be happily occupy by the germans
S0465	oh they be happily occupy yeah
S0465	right yeah
S0456	i i i know of no bite of resistance
S0465	oh oh right yeah no i've see the and
S0456	er they be they be still very very pro german and obviously german be the first foreign language outside swedish which be you know give that they have a large swedish minority
S0465	mm
S0456	it's not really er much of a foreign language it's a foreign language because it's very unlike finnish but so be everything apart from estonian
S0465	yeah you're right yeah norway be happy there
S0456	but but yeah so erm
S0465	i think norway's economy in this crisis never affect it no
S0456	well you know they they sit on a pile oil they if you think even up to the sixties norway be one of the poorest countries
S0465	yeah
S0456	because they have really just agriculture and fish and you know some industry but you know it would've be localise erm and the oil transform it
S0465	yeah
S0456	plus of course they be quite good in do it thatcher use all the oil revenues to have everybody unemployed they invest it leave right and centre and
S0465	mm
S0456	create their sovereign wealth fund and you know people say well oh you know easy for norway a smaller country et cetera it's like well yeah but it be it be hopelessly waste and it it's one of those things that never appear much in the newspapers but in the mid eighties erm there be a question i think it be today and the be ask and then he be ask afterwards to get it edit out
S0465	oh right
S0456	and it be only much later that they erm transmit it when he be longer the er erm and i actually record it then because he have this massive outburst and he be say look she's waste billions and this that and the other
S0465	yeah
S0456	he just absolutely lose his rag
S0456	which obviously yeah that's not what you want but he be spot on
S0465	yeah
S0456	and yeah nobody else say it and you know this be why he be so upset he say well you know why why don't you ask about those things why don't you ask them
S0465	actually er three of three cousins
S0456	mm
S0465	live in norway
S0456	mm
S0465	one of them live in tromsø
S0456	yeah
S0465	which be right in the north

S0465	er how how can you bear bear live there
S0465	and they just love it
S0465	it's nice there he's be live there since nineteen ninety two or nineteen ninety three i think
S0456	mm
S0465	er yeah so he just say i i i just love it yeah apparently it's too cold it's close to
S0456	the arctic circle
S0465	yeah
S0456	yeah
S0465	mm
S0456	yeah tromsø and very dark
S0465	very dark yeah it's he mention that
S0456	mm for a longer time well if he's happy
S0465	yeah well i think he's get marry that's why he's happy there you know
S0456	yeah
S0465	he's marry to erm
S0456	mm
S0465	i think er er his wife be erm half chinese
S0456	mm
S0465	and they have a restaurant a chinese restaurant there
S0456	it's just all good fee that make him happy
S0465	think so yeah yeah
S0456	yeah well i suppose it's it's similar to you for him it's a place of safety isn't it
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm and because that's what they say the the the people who be involve and survive it's not what you want to talk about
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm but as i say my libyan friend they they be now it be think
S0465	yeah
S0456	if there's a post gaddafi time because for a long time that be just not even something you can imagine
S0465	mm
S0456	you can go back and now he can't be go back he say you know my son grow up here do everything that all his peer would do and it he's get none of that hassle
S0465	yeah
S0456	he be british
S0465	yeah
S0456	and everything else be just doesn't count
S0465	no
S0456	erm you know the the whole history it's too painful
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm and yeah it's true i mean if you look at many of the soldier who come back they wouldn't talk about it would they
S0465	no they wouldn't no
S0456	just you know just like yeah all this thing about you know you talk and it it help you yeah i suppose
S0456	it help i suppose
S0465	yeah
S0456	if there be some kind of deep psychological problem with it
S0465	mm
S0456	but for many people no you want to bury it
S0465	no i don't know no
S0456	you do something else
S0465	yeah
S0456	you work or else
S0465	no i've have er
S0456	mm
S0465	in er er libyans i think it be quiet for a bite you know after the
S0456	mm
S0465	remove gaddafi
S0456	mm
S0465	but all of a sudden you know it's change
S0456	yeah well that's what they say now there's a lot of the mediterranean refugees erm be obviously they're the sudanese who come north
S0465	yeah
S0456	but a lot of them be actually libyans
S0465	yeah
S0456	because it
S0465	yeah
S0456	it's it's it's like iraq isn't it they they they be erm help to bring about regime change though unlike iraq obviously this be support but then they be not there
S0465	no
S0456	to do the nation build afterwards
S0465	no
S0456	because you have to be in look at northern ireland
S0465	yeah
S0456	it's still smeltering on you know you have to you have to have so many man hours
S0465	mm
S0456	you have to have diplomats and you have to put money in you have to give people
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm hope you have to have the infrastructure yeah rather than have militias who can do whatever they like try to support something that be a firm structure yeah libya libya to italy what be that
S0465	yeah i don't know
S0456	that they can cross the sea
S0465	yeah
S0456	it's
S0465	be it like
S0456	about two hundred miles
S0465	yeah i think it it's an hour or something like this
S0456	yeah
S0465	something like this you know
S0456	yeah
S0465	or more or less
S0456	so yeah it's it's on the doorstop
S0465	yeah well the the problem the problem with libya
S0456	mm
S0465	to be honest you know gaddafi be
S0456	mm
S0465	well he be mad
S0456	yeah
S0465	he be a madman you know but he wasn't that bad as well you know i've i've get some
S0456	mm
S0465	libyans er
S0456	mm
S0465	in you know
S0456	mm
S0465	they say that well yeah he be mad he be do some crazy things
S0456	mm
S0465	you know but if you look at the other side i think he be right for do
S0456	mm
S0465	so many
S0456	mm
S0465	take so many extreme measure for example ban all the islamic group and
S0456	mm
S0465	look what happen now because he didn't let them to have er
S0456	yeah
S0465	even saddam didn't allow er
S0456	mm
S0465	islamic or extremist organisations to do a parade you know
S0456	mm
S0465	that's why they be they
S0456	mm
S0465	yeah they be the move to iran or other
S0456	mm
S0465	place and er gaddafi do the same
S0456	yeah
S0465	cos you always believe that these
S0456	mm
S0465	these these they will cause problems in the future which they do you know like
S0456	yeah it's it's it's never straightforward you know
S0465	yeah i know it's just and then the other thing the the other thing be gaddafi he wasn't well he be er his his er his people be er very poor and starve to death he send so many of them abroad
S0456	mm
S0465	for study and
S0456	mm
S0465	spend all the money on them and the graduate there er i'm not try to make er
S0456	yeah
S0465	gaddafi have a saint you know he i'm not say that but he wasn't that bad
S0456	no yeah
S0465	because admit now they say that well some of them wish he be still in power
S0456	yeah
S0465	er in fact there be a couple
S0456	mm
