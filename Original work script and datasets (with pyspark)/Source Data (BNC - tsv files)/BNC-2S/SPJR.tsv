S0525	so your dad ring a couple of hours ago and erm
S0615	get there alright then
S0525	yes he texted me last night probably about half eleven to say they be there but what i didn't realise be they be not actually on the site they be at the dock where the pip be deliver and they've get to erm sort out six hundred pip clean them all out and put end cap on them because the customer won't pay
S0615	mm how long be that go to take himthen
S0525	well your dad say it's horrendous it's go to take forever he say they haven't get end cap for a start they've be nick or they've fall off or they didn't come with them which be a problem that we always use to have erm there's a big box of like rubber end cap but they can't make them fit so your dad have go out to get more calor gas from a local shop because they be use like a a canusa type torch to melt down the rubber to try and get it to stick onto the pipe so
S0615	oh mm mm mm
S0525	almost like weld it on and i don't know he say it's absolutely awful he say it be quite a nice day up there so i don't think they've have the rain that we have here luckily but he say erm the customer want to take eight pip next week he say but er of course we can't they can't leave the dock until the customer pay the vat i say well of course they can't and the vat be two hundred and thirty thousand on that first lot apparently there's six more deliveries come in next well in ten days' time and they won't be able to shift these so no wonder he's get like a a small posse of people up there on site
S0615	it be lovely up there yesterday mm mm so they'll probably never get onto site then in the next couple of days he's just take them up to do this
S0525	well yeah once they do get on to site that's when they need somebody else there to record the delivery note correctly i mean we never have to do this before this this be this be just stall tactics for not pay i can't
S0615	oh
S0525	you know a pipe be a pipe they've gotta they've gotta flush it through before they use it anyway you have to you know bung water through at high pressure which clean out all the rubbish test all the joint i mean that's standard procedure and i be assume it's a drink water pipe if it's sewerage well there's even less need to so i don't know why they be have to do all of this or why have agree to do it all i notice be be be well out of the way he's he's never up there i suppose he's i bet he's wash his hand of it he get the job and he's think do whatever
S0615	mm mm yeah yeah yeah yeah what a friend manual labour mm
S0525	well he's probably think it be not necessarily not necessary but it be just him and these days isn't it so
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	so be up there and
S0615	who's that

S0525	okay right then there we be you're out
S0615	i buy a christen outfit
S0525	you be out i'll see if want to go i don't think she will i don't think anybody will
S0615	oh no on your own
S0525	mm
S0615	won't be able to get the time off now
S0525	no i know be you give that rabbit a name
S0615	it's ratatat
S0525	oh why you say that be the rat
S0615	no i say ratatat be the rabbit in rhythm time
S0525	oh that what just like that
S0615	yeah
S0525	oh
S0615	but he's get rhythm time on his hat so he's about twenty pound more expensive
S0525	oh i see oh what you can buy him
S0615	yeah
S0525	rhythm time be a franchise business isn't it
S0615	yeah also baby sign be a er a franchise business
S0525	mm be it how
S0615	yeah i think i might take him to baby sign
S0525	excellent and nanny need to come as well
S0615	well if you just if take them and kind of submerge them in it
S0525	why do you want him to learn that
S0615	well then by the time there's apparently a lady be tell me today that er a woman take her daughter and she's she nine ten months and she can sign food
S0525	yeah yeah
S0615	yeah so rather than obviously she can't talk yet make noise and stuff but so she's sign milk and nappy and things like milk
S0525	yeah really really
S0615	yeah
S0525	how clever
S0615	mm mm
S0525	bsl or makaton
S0615	i don't know probably er be be it makaton that's what mr tumble do on the telly
S0525	he do makaton do he
S0615	yeah yes
S0525	i'd like to come if it be bsl where do you where do they do that
S0615	great erm where be she say that they do it opposite erm train station er in the church there on the roundabout
S0525	oh that church
S0615	yes i think they do it in there i don't know how much it be actually maybe i i will have a look now because i would quite like to go to that
S0525	oh okay you'd have to learn it as well otherwise you wouldn't know what he be sign to you
S0615	well obviously what i'm go to leave him be i
S0525	at four months to pick it up himself
S0615	yeah bye i'll come and pick you up in a bite
S0525	he doesn't need to sign he just scream
S0615	what do you mean just scream what to tell me what he want
S0525	mm he just cry
S0615	yeah but the cry be gonna get less and if he can communicate with me in another way in a few months' time surely that's beneficial to the way
S0525	and then and then they're gonna say oh my baby doesn't talk it just sign because he just decide he doesn't need to
S0615	he's obviously deaf
S0525	well no that just they don't need to
S0615	of course they need to
S0525	no no i'm think that will be what somebody will come up with next somebody will say that because because er 's baby well what's the younger one he be say he be ever so lazy in talk he would get to say things for him or would start answer for him and she say he just wouldn't bother and she just didn't know why she say he can but he just doesn't doesn't hardly talk at so if she say you know do you want a sandwich will go yes he do mummy don't you answer for him and he will go oh
S0615	yeah baby sign mm yeah will sign help or hinder my baby's ability to talk
S0525	there you go
S0615	you may worry that teach your baby to sign will slow down his normal speech development in fact research show the opposite be true sign may actually help your baby to learn to talk add word to his vocabulary sign be about enhance not replace language sign should be use along with normal speech so your baby can make the link between gesture and word yes so when you be at home you won't you won't just communicate with your baby because without say anything
S0525	yes why have what yes that's beer anyway
S0615	oh if for example he tell you he can hear an aeroplane you can respond you hear an aeroplane yes i can see it look it's over there it's in the this way you spend more time chat about what interest your little one which be a great way to help to him learn to talk there we go
S0525	right and be it be it it's just call baby sign it be not call bsl or
S0615	no mm
S0525	interest what what day be that on
S0615	more hold your hand open palm face towards your body with one in front of the other more the hand in front and forward distance make sure distance oh forward
S0525	what this that that's more
S0615	hold the hand in front for a short distance

S0525	okay yeah it's be rain all day here
S0615	yes it's be rain where we've be all day soak all the time
S0525	it's horrible you can't well your dad's comment be at least the weather be nice up there so it must be alright in glasgow i wonder if be have a better day she seem to have drive this morning then she tell me she be go to get the train she's get her pass now
S0615	well it look like she's drive

S0615	or drive to the station photos of what oh okay i see
S0525	while i be change her sheet wash her sheet the usual i do say she could strip one of the bed as she be sleep in the double bed last night i say oh you could just do that in the morning mum yeah
S0615	mm oh or do she say i'll do it in the morning and then she didn't
S0525	no no she didn't she just laugh at me and say oh you'll do it you'll do it
S0615	ah
S0525	then there be erm oh britain's horror home we be watch last night and there be this one infest with dust mites and horrible get bite and be like er i say well they be everywhere i say everybody have dust mites in the house i say that photo have just be magnify hundreds of time she be oh i don't believe it you know they show the fibres of things as great big so that's well i'm not go to be able to sleep be i so i say well go strip your bed then i say yeah why be i always wash your sheet you don't appreciate it and never once strip your bed i say if it be leave to you you're probably infest oh how be i go to sleep now now i know these things exist she's on about put a deposit down on this er b and b place as well for iceland
S0615	yeah nice mm mm oh i'm sure she know that oh crikey when
S0525	well no i say well we'll have to have a meet about it then
S0615	a meet how official
S0525	well everybody will have to have their input won't they
S0615	yes
S0525	because for a start it will need to be fairly central you don't want to be miles away from like the tour that we want to do and i don't know where it be situate so things like that we will need to look at surely
S0615	no yeah it's rather
S0525	well and it and what the car hire cost would be because erm 's trip include that so by the time you've pay the airfare and the fee
S0615	it be i know oh yeah no it's not far off what quote but just it what you know kind of accommodation obviously that you know that might be a better place because be like oh yeah we'll save money because we will like cook in the house and stuff and i'm like well yeah you could do that it it look like you be save money because that's the thing you know probably you know things i'd say well probably not because by the time you've pay for everything extra even when you do everything bite by bite rather than just all in one
S0525	yeah yes and that's right that's right well that's why i'm think we need to research what it would be to car hire and do the trip because if it's go to come out really expensive then you be better off stop at at a hotel
S0615	but that's like he say he get the price or
S0525	yeah you see yes that's what i mean 's price include that's what i'm say so if we go down the a b and b route then we need to price up try and get an idea of how much the trip would be if we do them ourselves just to sort of see if we be save money or not because we don't want to end up pay a lot more do we
S0615	yeah yeah mm yeah no
S0525	and you've probably get bed and breakfast in the hotel so that's your breakfast sort so that's why i mean we need to have a little meet and i i say to i say well me and your dad be easy on date i say erm you and probably can sort of will be i say it's really go to depend on erm wait to find out exactly what be do and so she's get an actual although do you know it's go to be monday tuesday wednesday
S0615	yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah mm yes
S0525	you do know that
S0615	yeah
S0525	but anyway i'm sure will be able to be flexible with his as well because she's only talk about four days plus a you know two days and a weekend or something so they just need to look at different time and see when the cheapest sort of er weekend would be because if we can be flexible we can go obviously not over 's birthday but we can go any time there's maybe three or four weekend we could choose from
S0615	yeah yeah any time yeah see the price
S0525	well exactly
S0615	what's the price the cheapest
S0525	yeah or even the january
S0615	say again
S0525	even leave it to january if it be cheaper
S0615	oh yeah yeah
S0525	that's where and have just be and they've put some great picture up so
S0615	yeah lovely well we er we'll have our meet soon
S0525	fine you and that stupid rabbit i will have to check with what they want to do
S0615	yes they will need to be part of the meet
S0525	well they will really she didn't want and include but then she can't leave them behind if be not drive that be her other condition
S0615	i know yes he need to hurry up then doesn't he
S0525	well he doesn't turn seventeen for er for a month so it just depend how quickly he will do it
S0615	well you can't really august september october

S0525	what subject
S0615	we be add and subtract two digit number use a hundred square
S0525	oh sound more complicate than it be i'm sure i don't quite know what that mean but i bet i could answer the question
S0615	isn't that excite well a hundred square yeah all the number from one to a hundred in row of ten
S0525	mm in a square in row of ten would would work yes
S0615	would work as a square so if you've get i don't know sixty three add twenty five you split your twenty five up you partition it into twenty and five start on sixty three on the hundred square you add twenty jump down to where it
S0525	mm yeah oh yeah oh i see
S0615	yeah so we're do that
S0525	yeah why do you learn like that well i suppose that's how you do it in your head then isn't it
S0615	yeah
S0525	then you just see you progress from leave the square behind
S0615	yeah mm mm
S0525	oh i see it's just
S0615	so once they see that sixty three add twenty be eighty three and then they can do that quickly in their head
S0525	right i see they just yeah then it's easy to get to eighty eight
S0615	yeah we be do that's what children find the most difficult when i ask the other day to add what be it oh yeah one of the girls she have twenty seven i say oh well add ten on she go twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven yeah so i'm go to ask them first of all they're just because they've get their hundred square they've get to fill in the miss gap as it be then erm
S0525	mm oh really mm
S0615	they've get to i'm go to ask them oh what's yeah what's thirty three add ten and then i'm just go to see straightaway
S0525	right
S0615	so we will see how we get on hopefully
S0525	okay be it round there
S0615	yeah
S0525	yeah and what school be they at
S0615	the kitchen be really small
S0525	mm be it
S0615	it's like a lounge and go back into a a din room probably the grind floor be not much bigger than this lounge
S0525	yeah oh really
S0615	because you go in and get straight into the no no the kitchen go a bite on because they've get a garage there so you go in and you go into the lounge and then you've get the just the din table at the back and then you've get the wall wall stairs go up and then you have get the kitchen in there but so the kitchen be just well it's quite it's like a a little box room really you go in and there's a
S0525	what and that there's a kitchen oh right mm yeah yeah have it get a window
S0615	yeah it's at the back
S0525	oh it have because that kitchen we look at in that that house when i be look at ones for you
S0615	which house
S0525	the one you send me to look at first of all for you and i think you do go and see it
S0615	oh yeah that one oh that be horrible wasn't it
S0525	be there be there no window in that kitchen be there nor be there one at the front and i don't think there be it just it be like a room you go into
S0615	what be behind it then
S0525	i'm just try to remember i don't think i don't think it have a window in it that be a really weird layout that be it be like a cupboard off the lounge they have turn into a kitchen
S0615	oh you let it get like that that be awful yeah yeah yeah yeah well they'd almost like stick another yeah it be yeah
S0525	there's be waste they have to do they have the the downstairs toilet there in a little hallway
S0615	yeah you go in and it be a little hall and you go to the garage or you have the you go through another door you have a lounge but you have the stairs there but it be like
S0525	that's right yeah yeah it be nice to have that that's right the stairs yeah
S0615	where would you put your sofa
S0525	that's right
S0615	where would you put your tv because there be no tv point there it be like over there your din space be quite nice because you have a big the big french doors but yeah then you have the tiny little kitchen
S0525	and your din table you couldn't could you yeah yes but if you add erm a table there you be struggle to get sofas and a well it's like yours be now really but probably even smaller than that it be just waste with that entrance hall
S0615	yeah yeah yeah mm yeah
S0525	it be nice to have that and then you felt you be go into something bigger but it be a bite pointless because there be nothing else there then be there
S0615	mm yeah she have already buy that knock that out and then have the erm maybe if they need a downstairs toilet have it under the erm stairs or something
S0525	mm
S0615	and then yeah she would have have a a big lounge din room at the back and then that kitchen i don't know why why it be so small they could have bring it out to the stairs and have a bigger room which be odd
S0525	no yours be better way it's erm proportion
S0615	we've all point to the garage
S0525	mm and they have three bedrooms upstairs as well didn't they
S0615	yeah
S0525	so you really lose the space because they they be small
S0615	yeah they be tiny yeah the bedrooms
S0525	mind you that your second bedroom be big bigger than you'd normally get in a and probably bigger than you'll get in your next house as a but if you make it into two you really lose the the room don't you
S0615	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah mm i mean you couldn't make ours into two at the moment
S0525	no no you be not not that particular one i'm think just to use the actual space you've get because our house before in have three bedrooms but you you would have struggle to get a bed in the one be you go to have to go now be you
