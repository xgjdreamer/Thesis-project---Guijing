S0450	uhu
S0439	oh the thing with like the the difference between and be that be much bigger but the
S0450	yeah
S0439	centre be really small so
S0450	uhu
S0439	more people live further out
S0450	yeah
S0439	and then you have to travel into the centre which take longer and it's further away whereas
S0450	uhu
S0439	have a really big city centre but as a place it's quite small
S0450	oh yes so it's kind of easier to isn't it
S0439	so it's easier to like there's more go on
S0450	uhu
S0439	and then it's it's easier to have it's yeah and the shop be better and
S0450	better social life and that kind of stuff
S0439	yeah exactly
S0450	that's good
S0439	which be really grey and just a bite er i didn't i didn't enjoy it very much at all
S0450	uhu i'm get bore of
S0439	i can imagine do you you have grow up there all your life
S0450	i know it's like you just you forget what's around and
S0439	yeah
S0450	all that that like get out and about and like it's just you know
S0439	yeah
S0450	i just get sick of the same thing cos i see like so it's just so busy it's just like a big city isn't it it's like
S0439	yeah
S0450	but you just sort of you know the bus go and then when i go out for the day and i just see some green and be like oh i've not see green in age
S0450	which be so sad
S0439	yeah it be actually
S0450	but okay
S0439	be you think of like move job or change job at all
S0450	i don't know so well so far i'm gonna stay at my job for the next maybe year cos i be think mm insects erm i be think like you know in like there be so many job in london for er cos i be think i could go
S0439	would you like to move to london
S0450	well i be think about it and then i think the amount of money i'm save
S0439	you'd blow it
S0450	i'd i would have
S0439	you'd be rinse in london wouldn't you
S0450	i would literally i would have no cos i cos i go to see and the girls in like
S0439	yeah
S0450	mayish time and then we be just talk and they be like spend like eight nine hundred pound just it be in travel and you know the usual so just like
S0439	yeah
S0450	and er er i can remember when i be live in london a few years ago you just have no money to go and do things and you literally have like
S0439	yeah
S0450	like one holiday or you just you're just always so tight in what you're
S0439	yeah
S0450	what you do
S0439	and also like just like go out for drink
S0450	yeah
S0439	be a good thirty forty pound like it's not
S0450	like a tenner a tenner a drink
S0439	yeah it's not like you can just socially go out for a few drink it's like it cost you a lot of money
S0450	yeah
S0439	to go out in london and even just work in the city centre you'll find like you get a cup of coffee every day
S0450	yeah
S0439	go out for lunch like it all add up
S0450	you do you
S0439	you end up spend a
S0450	yeah
S0439	like a lot of money
S0450	and you'll always go out for lunch you'll never make your own lunch and
S0439	no
S0450	it's like cos like why why if i can just go downstairs and
S0439	exactly
S0450	go to a nice place
S0439	exactly yeah
S0450	at at home i can just i er
S0439	mm
S0450	take my own lunch sometimes
S0439	yeah
S0450	and like i i think i've just learn how to live i cos i still don't use that money that i do earn like and i still live like in a good way so if i do
S0439	yeah
S0450	i know that i i i wouldn't have to like scrimp or anything cos i know
S0439	yeah
S0450	but i just feel like if i have that money just when it's just go
S0439	exactly that's what i don't like i don't like the idea that you go to london and you pay a hell of a lot more money
S0450	yeah
S0439	for something that you could buy at a reasonable price two hours up the road
S0450	it's true and i couldn't afford to buy anything in london so
S0439	the house you couldn't even buy a grotty house in london
S0450	no
S0439	for like
S0450	somewhere in the outskirts
S0439	a decent amount
S0450	kind of yeah it's like
S0439	yeah
S0450	what i just don't understand how how expensive it be but then i think at home at least i have some sort of like my job's you know the job's alright people be alright if i you know i'll always have to go back see like mum and dad at time
S0439	yeah
S0450	and friends and family cos i remember when i be live in i be home every three or four weeks just cos stuff's always go on
S0439	mm
S0450	social like oh it's just
S0439	yeah
S0450	the balance be just not there until i decide oh unless there's an amaze job that i can't turn down
S0439	and pay you something like
S0450	and pay me
S0439	forty grand
S0450	yeah and i'm not leave but
S0439	the burger's mine thank you

S0450	if the managers decide where we go like we know we weren't gonna they're not gonna let us go
S0439	they always
S0450	because
S0439	keep you cos what's the point of train you for two years to let you go unless you're like shock which obviously you're not
S0450	yeah cos it other thing if if i be so bad they would like they'd let me go like years like literally
S0439	yeah

S0439	when she do come back she's only come back part time
S0450	so then she's literally not gonna be there
S0439	no
S0450	if it's maternity
S0439	and then i'm like okay that's fine great
S0450	uhu
S0439	and then like the woman who's suppose to be our line manager at the moment be the head of our department
S0450	yeah
S0439	and she never have any time for us so i actually haven't have a one on one meet with my line with a line manager
S0450	uhu
S0439	since may and it's now what the begin of august
S0450	that's like the worst thing though isn't it it's like

S0450	uhu
S0439	i don't want an email i want you to have a meet with me
S0450	yeah and be there in person or whatever
S0439	mm
S0450	not the same be it when they're not there but oh okay be you still be you still gonna do your er the second degree do you
S0439	yeah
S0450	i remember you say that you be gonna do your degree
S0439	i wanna do it just
S0450	or another degree
S0439	fit it in like i start try to do the the online one but i just genuinely couldn't fit it in with all like my run train
S0450	uhu
S0439	and stuff so i have to just slightly revaluate but i still my aim be still just do it over the
S0450	uhu
S0439	next few years
S0450	yeah
S0439	i just gotta plan it out a bite more
S0450	it do they do it with like the open university or that kind of stuff or
S0439	mm
S0450	be it be it like you have to go to like in person and do it or do they it depend on what you
S0439	you can do it through like online course and stuff but
S0450	uhu
S0439	i don't know if i learn that way
S0450	uhu
S0439	i find it quite hard so
S0450	uhu oh it's
S0439	it
S0450	it's tough isn't it think if you
S0439	mm
S0450	yeah oh well i
S0439	it's just find time
S0450	uhu that's what's the hard thing cos you work all day and then it's like you wanna do stuff as well as study
S0439	yeah and like when you're at uni obviously you never stop think about work but i like the fact that when i leave work
S0450	you switch off
S0439	yeah i no longer like care about it
S0450	yeah i think i care less you know how like when i be at uni i really want to do well and
S0439	mm
S0450	and get to the top and now i'm like oh i like my social time and relax cos i just
S0439	same

S0439	mm
S0450	and like oh how's it go cos i've not you you know all that stuff but then then i think at time like yeah they haven't respond to me so
S0439	yeah
S0450	or i guess everyone's do their own thing at time and then that's the
S0439	mm
S0450	that's the strange thing but you get better i just need a new phone i should get a new phone mm
S0439	i'm erm i think it's cool but most other people don't i'm a member of the victoria and albert museum
S0439	like i love it
S0450	oh that's quite cool
S0439	and erm and one of my friends really like the exhibitions as well like they do a lot of
S0450	uhu
S0439	erm couture and you know fashion exhibitions and stuff so
S0450	i've be i've be to one of their dress ones years ago
S0439	yeah i go to them quite a lot
S0450	uhu
S0439	obviously cos i'm a member and so she come and that's kind of like the thing that we do together
S0450	yeah
S0439	to meet up and catch up

S0439	cos she still live in so i come from
S0450	uhu
S0439	and she come from and we meet up and we go to an exhibition
S0450	uhu
S0439	and have coffee and it's just a nice excuse to go to london
S0450	uhu
S0439	and to have a catch up with somebody
S0450	definitely true cos it's like it's something different isn't it
S0439	mm
S0450	at the same time cos it's always like and change isn't there
S0439	yeah and like there be so many nice exhibitions on there but there be always something we'd like to see so
S0450	uhu always the best bite
S0439	mm
S0450	cos up in london you know when you go down like and see these random museums and like on these like side streets and you're like oh that's quite cool
S0439	yeah
S0450	like not you know out of the hustle and bustle you're like oh that's well strange
S0439	yeah my dad take me to the benjamin franklin museum and few weeks ago and that be it be alright actually
S0450	uhu
S0439	it be quite interest and i guess it's probably not something i would have choose to go to see
S0450	uhu
S0439	but see it be quite interest
S0450	yeah they're always quite cool haven't be to one in age no when i be in ireland we randomly it's not really a museum but it be like a it be the leprechaun museum
S0450	so they have it's not really a museum it's just like a random
S0439	yeah
S0450	so well they have erm they have massive so there be like you can if you're and they have like massive furniture so you could climb on it like a little child and random bits and they have like different room about say the history about where the leprechauns and how you know and how they're
S0439	how do the leprechaun happen
S0450	he just i think it be just to do with people
S0439	like folklore
S0450	yeah it's all the yeah the the whole like folklore about in their little village the people have bedtime stories and they think them they live under the bed and all that kind of stuff and then it just kind of get and and i think it only become i think you know like how they say that you know at the end of the rainbow you've get the leprechaun and then they have green as the colour just cos ireland be green
S0439	yeah
S0450	that's how they kind of get so that kind of bite of it and then i think it be something they say something about there be i think there be a disney film like forty fifty years ago like or i don't know what i can't remember what it be call but they be in them like you know they you know but like
S0439	yeah
S0450	leprechauns in them and then they pretty much have that look since then but it be quite it's quite cool different
S0439	i like folklores and stuff like that though

S0450	uhu
S0439	i still look to somebody older than me for like advice and everything
S0450	uhu until i'm in my thirties i probably won't feel like an adult or like late or like twenties until we get like to get to twenty five and then i'll be like yeah

S0450	no
S0439	at the moment a lot of my friends be a lot older not a lot older than me but they're older than me

S0439	i don't think i'm gonna be the settle down type
S0450	mm

S0450	it still affect you in the same way doesn't it
S0439	yeah it still it's still calorie content and it's just oh it just annoy me
S0450	cos you can get goodness from like carbs as well like you know like i'm sure you can get some of the goodness out of potatoes
S0439	you do yeah of course you do
S0450	it's energy isn't it energy energy
S0439	yeah
S0450	that's one of them isn't it
S0439	people need carbohydrates to make your like brain function
S0450	uhu
S0439	like the carbs be essential to your bodily to body your body function
S0450	that that's true i guess yeah i don't really i just eat what i want which be probably the worst thing
S0439	no it obviously work for you dear so
S0450	yeah but i could be like have all the nasty fat in the inside and be like
S0439	nah
S0450	you just can't tell but i could be really unhealthy in the inside you never know
S0439	you could be but it doesn't really matter
S0439	who care
S0450	no i just eat what well yeah the worst thing but i hate like have salads you know when like a salad
S0439	i
S0450	at lunchtime i get i get
S0439	yeah
S0450	basically you know and it doesn't fill me up
S0439	you've get to enjoy what you eat
S0450	uhu
S0439	and like i do not enjoy just boil chicken
S0450	no
S0439	why would i just eat boil chicken
S0450	no
S0439	one of my friends do cos she's try to like
S0450	what like be she bore
S0439	build she's try to get stronger so she's like go to the gym and stuff
S0450	uhu
S0439	so she just eat chicken all the time and it's just like god
S0450	it it it be bore though cos it's the same type of food make in the same way all the time it's just not interest be it
S0439	and i refuse to go to a restaurant and buy a salad i'm sorry
S0450	uhu
S0439	it's like ten pound for a salad
S0450	yeah
S0439	it's like i could make this myself er technically i could make a burger myself but you know
S0450	it's the whole
S0439	the principle of it if i'm gonna go
S0450	uhu
S0439	okay
S0450	you get more for your money
S0439	exactly
S0450	i do that yesterday and i end up get erm i wasn't that hungry anyway cos i have a massive breakfast so i end up get like this this chicken caesar salad and i be like it be like it's eleven pound and i be like come on it's not even worth that much
S0439	no
S0450	it's like worth like four pound or something and there wasn't even a lot of chicken on it and like come on
S0439	that's the really annoy thing isn't it like when you order something and you actually have to like hunt out the protein
S0450	uhu
S0439	it's like this be suppose to be i have what do i have i have a goat's cheese in quinoa salad the other week
S0450	uhu
S0439	it be a really a really nice salad and i have it with something
S0450	yeah
S0439	and there be about five bits of goat's cheese in it and i think
S0450	well oh that's the worst bite
S0439	you be
S0450	isn't it
S0439	yeah i be like
S0450	just like this little slice that they've cut up and then like
S0439	yeah
S0450	drizzle it everywhere
S0439	it's like i love goat's cheese give me some goat's cheese
S0450	uhu
S0439	that's why i order the goat's cheese salad
S0450	uhu
S0439	i didn't order salad with a drop of goat's cheese do i
S0450	that's it it's like you get more salad than
S0439	yeah
S0450	you actually do the thing that's mean to be the main part of the salad
S0439	yeah
S0450	which be like the worst bite it's like it should be like equal portion and
S0439	exactly
S0450	like you probably won't eat it all if it be equal portion of salad and
S0439	yeah
S0450	like if it's too
S0439	but you still want a little bite more than
S0450	yeah
S0439	if you if you order a chicken salad you expect there to be a decent amount of chicken in there don't you
S0450	uhu
S0439	if there be like two piece i would not be happy
S0450	yeah at least like a like a chicken breast
S0439	yeah
S0450	like on the side like what
S0439	yeah
S0450	you'd put in a burger but you would have like half of that
S0439	yeah if you order a burger and you have to like you and you only get half a burger you'd be pretty piss off wouldn't you so
S0450	uhu it's like you don't how to ask for it either but it's can i have extra chicken or
S0439	yeah
S0450	have a normal portion of chicken
S0439	but also what really annoy me be you know when you order pate and they give you like a massive slab of pate
S0450	uhu
S0439	and then
S0450	no bread
S0439	two bits of bread and you're just like and not even like a slice and like you know two triangles of bread
S0450	oh yeah
S0439	and you're just like
S0450	you can't eat it all
S0439	where's the logic yeah
S0450	i know
S0439	you know
S0450	but i don't i don't yeah
S0439	that i'm gonna ask for more bread
S0450	yeah that's shit they'll always give it you but they don't give you more to start with so you don't feel like oh can i have more please
S0439	yeah
S0450	cos then it's like
S0439	cos you end up have like this tiny piece of bread with a massive load of
S0450	oh come on
S0439	pate on
S0450	i'm have a bad day
S0439	oh what have you do
S0450	i've drop my food

S0450	i'm think
S0439	unless you want to come to me and sit inside with me
S0450	uhu
S0439	which be okay if you drive i guess but
S0450	yeah
S0439	if you've get to get a train and stuff
S0450	effort
S0439	it's an effort isn't it
S0450	sometimes sometimes it's alright i don't mind it like
S0439	yeah
S0450	i've i've book my drive test for september
S0439	oh do you that's cool
S0450	so finger cross we'll see how it erm finally get into that
S0439	i dare say it have be drag on for quite a while now it must have be like you must have be learn to drive for five years
S0450	on and off i just
S0439	yeah
S0450	haven't be like finish it or but yeah so i think it's probably take me age this i i should have book months ago and then i didn't
S0439	yeah
S0450	it's cos i didn't do my theory until about three months ago which i i could have do age ago like years ago
S0439	yeah
S0450	but i never do and then yeah and then you have to wait three months for it to book the test so like
S0439	oh do you oh i do not know that
S0450	erm where i live it's a three month wait list for the test
S0439	oh i see
S0450	which be the most annoy
S0439	how's the drive go
S0450	it's fine
S0439	you
S0450	i i can i can drive
S0439	yeah
S0450	it's just the odd time on on the odd one roundabout but
S0439	yeah
S0450	that's about it
S0439	yeah the the the more you drive
S0450	especially where i live yeah
S0439	the more confident you become and you're fine
S0450	especially where i live load of people drive very dodgy that's what my instructor say like from everywhere he's like he's from like he live in like a village on the outskirts of
S0439	yeah
S0450	and he be like be the roughest place that i've drive like people will just pull out anywhere and it's like he reckon the hazard there
S0439	it's i think it's cities in general like cities in general be awful
S0450	it's so bad
S0439	birmingham be atrocious to drive round
S0450	uhu
S0439	i don't like that at all
S0450	mm it's get the massive ring road and it's you can get lose can't you in birmingham i remember be in erm be in my friend's car in when we go to leeds in february

S0450	and it be like the worst bite i have a good time in leeds but
S0439	it's it's always an effort though
S0450	a big effort
S0439	sometimes it's easier to get the train to place just because you don't want like you don't have to park
S0450	yeah cos i yeah that's true cos i know that if er if i do er ever pass i'll never get i'll never drive to london

S0439	it's really sad
S0450	you're still whatever you're do you still should like
S0439	make time
S0450	the people like you spend like a good three four years with you know like
S0439	yeah
S0450	most of like most of your like spare time and stuff it's like so
S0439	yeah like be like my best friend at uni so
S0450	and they be like there at the whole time weren't they
S0439	yeah exactly
S0450	just around the corner or whatever and then it's like yeah
S0439	and then he get a girlfriend and then in a moment you just disappear but
S0450	yeah
S0439	it's not too bad like i say that to like she get back with in january
S0450	uhu
S0439	and i say to her i be like you've just get to be careful because i keep invite you out to things and you're not and you don't come you just sit at home in your bedroom on the phone to
S0450	yeah
S0439	and it's dangerous because you will end up with no friends
S0450	that's true cos then the the the more that you say no do something the more someone won't er invite you to do it
S0439	yeah
S0450	which be the the worst thing and then then you'd be like
S0439	exactly
S0450	well why don't they invite me but if you're with say
S0439	yeah
S0450	cos i've see them when
S0439	i've see

S0439	yeah
S0450	you can't get back in unless you're like
S0439	exactly cos i think she's
S0450	which be the worst bite
S0439	it's kind of sad i know cos she's try to get back in cos i i say to her the other week i be just like you know like i'm try to invite you to things and you know you just don't wanna get stick in a rut again and not
S0450	uhu
S0439	you know and break up with and then end up alone
S0450	yeah
S0439	i couldn't say obviously say it that untactfully but
S0450	because like once you don't have that one person
S0439	yeah
S0450	if you spend all your time do it's like what do you do when they're not there
S0439	exactly like
S0450	you don't you

S0439	we've live in since january now so what about like seven months and i've make like quite a nice group of friends and she just hasn't really make friends with anybody and like

S0450	oh even if you live with someone it doesn't mean you're always gonna be free when they want
S0439	exactly
S0450	to do something
S0439	and it's kind of like she just expect me to be free and it's like i'm not become so use to you just be in your bedroom that i've go out and make plan you know like

S0450	i'm a clever person
S0439	he wasn't he wasn't really the one
S0450	yeah it's like you have to have kind of the same taste in something if not
S0439	yeah
S0450	doesn't really work do it
S0439	any any man in your life
S0450	not at the moment
S0439	no
S0450	i be see someone for a bite someone i work with
S0439	oh
S0450	like but we're kind of just like friends
S0439	oh
S0450	just a really get like anywhere but
S0439	yeah
S0450	how's your love life
S0439	er well i be see this guy call for about i dunno four months
S0450	uhu
S0439	and i didn't didn't like you know i didn't realise i kind of didn't really like him
S0450	yeah
S0439	and i just keep see him i'm not entirely sure why to be honest
S0439	well i do know why but
S0439	but erm yeah and then a few weeks
S0450	if he's there
S0439	exactly he's there yeah
S0439	girls girls have need
S0439	erm and then i just one day i be just like you know what i don't i really can't be bother with this
S0450	yeah
S0439	so i do the whole like
S0439	i think we need to have a bite of a chat and he be like okay
S0450	he know it be come
S0439	and he and he agree as well he be like it's not really go anywhere i be like no it's not be it
S0450	yeah there's no point
S0439	and so
S0450	carry on
S0439	yeah but
S0450	so
S0439	we're still friends and like we meet up last week and we have a coffee and stuff and it's fine
S0450	uhu
S0439	and it's quite nice just to be his friend and then
S0450	it's sometimes better with some people to just be friends cos i find
S0439	yeah
S0450	it's just kind of like you get to the sometimes a better relationship
S0439	well that's the thing
S0450	that's like kind of where it start sometimes
S0439	yeah
S0450	with for sort of big like
S0439	we just kind of like go straight into see each other instead of like actually get to know each other
S0450	oh
S0439	so we kind of miss the whole friend part
S0450	uhu
S0439	so it just there be nothing to build a relationship on
S0450	oh yeah
S0439	because there be no friend foundation so it be a bite pointless to be honest but it didn't go anywhere er and then i get with this other guy call a few weeks ago but he's a bite of a player so i
S0450	mm
S0439	it kind of turn me right straight off
S0450	oh yeah
S0439	and i be a bite like oh
S0450	so not it be yeah it's kind of like you don't
S0439	so at the moment no there's no man in my life
S0450	something it's summer summer love
S0439	exactly yeah no i just like be single i really like it
S0450	i do as well but
S0439	i really like have my
S0450	i like do my own thing
S0439	but yeah exactly i like have my own space
S0450	but i've always do my own like quite a lot of the time i do my own thing
S0439	same even when i be date people i would
S0450	but
S0439	still do my own thing
S0450	and then
S0439	i think that's the problem with date cos people
S0450	cos then it's that switch off and be like oh yeah
S0439	yeah
S0450	i need to make time to do stuff with you
S0439	exactly
S0450	and then if you're not free like it kind of if if if they're not free at the same time as you it doesn't work
S0439	yeah
S0450	cos then you go weeks and weeks and then like erm yeah it's mm just don't
S0439	and it's try to explain to them that you like do your own thing and then they're like oh so you don't wanna spend time with me it's like it's not that i just like do my own thing and go and
S0450	yeah
S0439	hang out with my friends and stuff and then it just feel a bite awkward
S0450	mm

S0450	stop i can stop my but just churn for the whole week and i just yeah this time i couldn't couldn't hack that i can't hack cold
S0439	yeah
S0450	basically i just
S0439	i'm not very good
S0450	get ill if i
S0439	that's why i don't really want to invest a lot of money on a ski holiday cos i just can't deal with the cold
S0450	uhu unless it be like a two day like
S0439	yeah
S0450	go for like two or three days but i guess i er think cos cos i have to i pay for lessons again cos i have to ski for like four hours a day
S0439	yeah
S0450	with an instructor and stuff and for three days or like i be feel really iffy in the morning but like by about midday once you've have that all like cold day you're you're fine but at the time i just i be feel so so
S0439	yeah
S0450	knackered and then i think there be a day where i didn't have a ski lesson i be like honestly i'm just stay in bed it be all misty and and you couldn't see a thing so
S0439	yeah
S0450	if even if i go out i'd literally be like er i don't wanna be
S0450	go up an edge but some of the view be just to die for though
S0439	er
S0450	the view be to die for and saw them
S0439	yeah i can imagine i can imagine they'd be
S0450	like
S0439	really incredible
S0450	they be incredible that be probably the best bite be just the view and
S0439	yeah that's the thing i quite like the view
S0450	and just and and actually the easy slop like when you can actually just go really fast like but you know the easy green so it's like you're not really in difficulty of go down just literally just go fast and go straight that be what i enjoy more
S0439	yeah
S0450	i do get lose on my last one do i ever tell you story
S0439	yeah
S0450	i get lose ski
S0439	how do you be you just alone be you not with anybody
S0439	be you
S0450	yeah i be alone
S0439	oh no
S0450	but basically it be on the last i think it be the last day of ski
S0439	yeah
S0450	and we be all meet for lunch so everyone be in their little group and they're like and we we be in like group of fours
S0439	yeah
S0450	around the place and we be meet up at midday and i think we get to the place early
S0439	yeah
S0450	and there be like four of us erm i literally i think the day before i have just i'd strain my knee
S0439	yeah
S0450	and i'd strain my leg so i didn't really wanna do anything hard like literally the effort
S0439	yeah
S0450	so some of the girls some of the girls go on the blue one and i go on the green down and the first route down fine
S0439	yeah
S0450	then we go back up again cos we be still like
S0439	bite early yeah
S0450	forty five minutes yeah so we go back up and they do the three do the blue one but a different blue
S0439	yeah
S0450	and i do a different green one
S0439	oh no
S0450	and then i go down and then i kind of cos there be like a massive like load of different so i go down the wrong one
S0450	and then literally i be follow the sign but the sign basically this be i think it be courchevel and there's courchevel like
S0439	oh
S0450	and the one signage
S0439	dear
S0450	so there be two for for the same place but one be for the village and one be for the other bite where we be mean to be
S0439	oh yeah
S0450	so i start follow that and then but i be like yeah i'm not where i want to be
S0439	oh
S0450	and like i know that and then luckily i'd pick up a map like i have happen to have the map the whole
S0439	yeah
S0450	week and i pick it i literally have one so i sit like for twenty minutes like i sit down and i be like try to work out where i be and then realise i be i'd go down an extra slope
S0439	oh
S0450	so so i be like actually have to get
S0439	back up
S0450	erm back up but erm er for some reason the signal on the mountains it's amaze so call me and she be like
S0439	where be you
S0450	where be you and i be like i'm about ten minutes away i'll be there don't worry
S0439	yeah
S0450	i'm not i'm i'm okay i'm i'm alive and then phone me back like
S0439	you be quite impressive that you can
S0450	it's
S0439	that you know that you know where you be because i can imagine a mountain it's very difficult to navigate where you be
S0450	and then there's a day cos on a saturday there's not really that many people on the mountains cos they stay you know people's transfer in and out
S0439	yeah
S0450	so there wasn't actually that many people and then she call me back again and she be like so where be you and i be like yeah i've work out where i be i'll be there soon i literally be an hour and a half
S0439	oh no
S0450	walk back but about an hour later i turn up and they be all wait for me and they be like you failure
S0450	and like i say like it be like it be funny at the time
S0439	yeah
S0450	but i don't at least i know where i be but then i because my knee be so knackered so i go instead of just in green they do like some really hard blue
S0439	yeah
S0450	and you just see like the drop and that be like and i i think at one point my ski fell off and then i just shimmy it
S0439	oh god
S0450	i shimmy it on my bottom because i couldn't be bother to put my ski back on and ski and i just like
S0439	yeah
S0450	and it's just easier just drag literally like literally go for like
S0439	yeah
S0450	take me a good twenty minutes on my bottom just to get down to the bottom so that's
S0439	shit
S0450	how far i be and then i have to get all the way back up and i be like hot and sweaty and like this the final day
S0439	yeah
S0450	but then i be it be quite funny
S0450	when i actually get to everyone
S0439	at least you didn't panic
S0450	no i i wasn't panic i be just like probably should have just go with the girls
S0439	yeah
S0450	and they wouldn't have waste all that time
S0439	oh well
S0450	but that be the most
S0450	entertain bite of my holiday just to kind of get get lose
S0450	but no it be good fun though

S0450	but yeah not in a while though
S0439	no

S0439	holiday in winter
S0450	that be probably my my first two
S0439	yeah
S0450	or like ireland be a bite cold well freeze as well but i'd rather a a warm holiday instead
S0439	yeah
S0450	then
S0439	i go to turkey at the begin of june and that be really nice
S0450	be it good be it good fun
S0439	it be really
S0450	chill out be it

S0439	yeah
S0450	that's quite nice and in you sometimes need that and something a bite different er out of the way but

S0450	yeah
S0439	two hundred and fifty quid three hundred pound
S0450	yeah
S0439	so it's like
S0450	and it's the thing be the longer you leave it the more expensive it get at the same time
S0439	yeah especially in august especially in august
S0450	and it's that bank holiday it's that last week of of summer holiday
S0439	yeah
S0450	technically so it's still a bite like

S0439	yeah
S0450	come back so
S0439	i can't yeah i can't spend a whole holiday on a beach but in turkey
S0450	mm

S0450	i've never do it
S0439	one day on a beach and then the other days we do some like touristy stuff and then other days
S0450	uhu
S0439	we do some walk round the town and
S0450	oh yeah it's just i like you know i can't i think i sit er if i sit on the beach for like an hour i'm
S0439	yeah
S0450	literally like i'd be like if it's too hot i'll be toss and turn like it's too hot
S0439	yeah
S0450	i can't i can't sit here or i'll be try to find a book and then i'll get bore of the book
S0439	see i can quite happily sunbathe for a long time
S0450	uhu
S0439	but not i couldn't do it for a whole week
S0450	no
S0439	i could do it for like a day
S0450	no it's a long
S0439	but not a whole week
S0450	it's a long day i just wanna go
S0439	yeah
S0450	and do things and like
S0439	yeah
S0450	explore and
S0439	well exactly cos there's really cos like me me and be go to barcelona
S0450	yeah
S0439	and me and be go on the thursday night
S0450	yeah
S0439	like really late we're arrive at like twelve o'clock at night
S0450	so pretty much bed
S0439	yeah
S0450	or a night and well it depend on what you're gonna do
S0439	but then we can have the whole friday the whole saturday
S0450	uhu
S0439	and come back on the sunday and be get there late on the friday night
S0450	yeah
S0439	have the whole of saturday and then come back on the sunday
S0450	wow
S0439	and it's kind of
S0450	just literally one day
S0439	literally like the one and a half days in barcelona
S0439	and it's just like why
S0450	that's
S0439	what's the point
S0450	yeah for what one day you really can't do anything like
S0439	yeah exactly
S0450	i'm kind of think where i've be for one day and literally do stuff
S0439	yeah it's really weird
S0450	well yeah it's i can't
S0439	they're just go for literally one day and we're me and be like
S0450	mm
S0439	but it's cheaper to fly out on the thursday night
S0450	yeah
S0439	stay for the extra day
S0450	and you can do more as well
S0439	and do more cos we're probably
S0450	yeah
S0439	gonna be tire but at least then we have like the half like most of friday the whole of saturday
S0450	yeah
S0439	and half of sunday
S0450	uhu
S0439	and they're like oh yeah we didn't really think about it and we're just like
S0450	it's yeah cos like
S0439	yeah
S0450	get you need at least either two or three days cos erm do we do dublin four days and that be too much
S0439	yeah
S0450	it's like three days would be perfect even two you know you can do all the
S0439	yeah
S0450	bits and bob have a good few nights out as well but
S0439	i think it's cos they just they're try to see so many place they're literally just try to go as cheap as possible
S0450	uhu
S0439	and fly go come back as quickly as possible cos they can't take obviously too much holiday so
S0450	no but then you miss er you miss the things that
S0439	yeah
S0450	you think oh it would have be good to see if i be there
S0439	but like apparently they're not really into like museums and like architecture and stuff so i think
S0450	they're erm yeah
S0439	it's kind of good that me and be go on the first day cos we'll go to see stuff at the gaudi and
S0450	yeah
S0439	like the more cultural things
S0450	uhu
S0439	and then and will come and we'll have like a night out and stuff like that so
S0450	yeah yeah it's the best bite i can remember yeah i just be er i think it be italy when we go to see like the lean tower
S0439	oh yeah the lean tower of pisa
S0450	and we be there for about four hours and then well cos there's nothing else there
S0439	yeah there's just the tower of the pisa yeah
S0450	once that and then we go and i think then we go to florence or we come by florence and then we do that and then we go
S0439	yeah
S0450	cos
S0439	i would like to go around italy i've be to rome and
S0450	yeah
S0439	didn't really like it that much and i think it be really erm
S0450	yeah
S0439	messy i think it be
S0450	yeah
S0439	really dirty
S0450	it be
S0439	but
S0450	yeah
S0439	it would be nice to see that it would be nice to like a tour because obviously the history in italy be really interest
S0450	yeah
S0439	of all like the different
S0450	uhu
S0439	part like naples at the bottom and then like florence
S0450	and yeah you've get sicily
S0439	and stuff at the top and
S0450	and all that kind of stuff it be i i do enjoy it but
S0439	yeah
S0450	i think as we didn't spend that much time in that many like that long and in that many place i think rome be probably the most we spend
S0439	yeah
S0450	i think we do that milan in a day as well which be quite
S0439	i'd like to see milan
S0450	it be like i love the i love cathedral
S0439	yeah
S0450	i love the i love the big cathedral and the stain glass
S0439	yeah
S0450	all that stuff i'm quite
S0439	yeah
S0450	i'm old school like that
S0439	no no i that's what i agree like when we're go to paris like
S0450	it's culture isn't it
S0439	so it's isn't come it's just me and and go to paris
S0450	uhu
S0439	erm and i think will be slightly more will to do things like go to like er sacre coeur which be
S0450	yeah
S0439	the big church on the yeah on the hill and
S0450	uhu
S0439	notre dame and stuff like obviously i've be
S0450	yeah
S0439	so many time i've see it all but it's still
S0450	i don't think i've ever do notre dame or like i've not do louvre or anything
S0439	the louvre
S0450	louvre
S0439	the louvre
S0450	the louvre
S0439	the louvre
S0450	i'm tire
S0439	the louvre
S0450	the louvre i be i i really wanna go and cos i've do like i go with my parent when i be about eleven twelve i think
S0439	yeah
S0450	and we do like three days in like you know the eifel tower and the the river the river seine you know on the boat the cruise kind of thing
S0439	yeah
S0450	but that be all kind of about it i need to go back and do like the other side of it the more cultural
S0439	yeah
S0450	side of it
S0439	paris there's just so many you can never do all the museums in paris there's so many
S0450	uhu
S0439	things but it's just nice i love it
S0450	yeah
S0439	as a city
S0450	it's a good
S0439	so
S0450	might go next year next like april may time
S0439	but it's so easy to get to on the eurostar now
S0450	uhu
S0439	it's so easy and cheap
S0450	yeah
S0439	well not cheap as such it depend you can get ticket like
S0450	mm
S0439	return ticket for something like seventy pound
S0450	yeah i've see like the odd deal so i'm like i oh shall we go and she's like er i have a think about it
S0439	i would just book it i'd just go like for seventy quid bargain
S0450	yeah i've like er cos i i'm i'm literally open for anything cos i can just spend what i want on holiday
S0439	mm
S0450	really which be really bad like er when other people can't but but that kind of get me in the mood and i'm like why can't i just spend it

S0439	oh yeah my mum's come with us to paris and i be like i love my mum but i don't she's just a pain to go on holiday with
S0450	uhu
S0439	so i'd prefer not to go on holiday with my parent anymore

S0439	yeah i've try to make more effort
S0450	probably should do
S0439	to go for like lunch with my mum or and stuff like that but i don't
