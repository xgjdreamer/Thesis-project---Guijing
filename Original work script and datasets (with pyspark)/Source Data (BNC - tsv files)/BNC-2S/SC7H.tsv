S0088	if they do food you wouldn't want to eat it basically and the people be so strange there be nobody else there walk in and they be em why it be so weird it be weird so obviously i just up yeah
S0136	yeah so but it's a much better place now isn't it the park
S0088	i haven't be there i haven't be there so i don't know but i should imagine they've do a lot yeah
S0136	me neither cos we be just think uh over the weekend cos it's mother sunday uh i be probably just think about like do a takeaway or something cos we don't really know any pubs in this area eh we've only be here for a year and my in laws have only just literally move to so you know
S0088	so you will you if you would you go out for something to eat then if it if you know a few place that be place you might like to go
S0136	if we know beforehand then yeah but the trouble be
S0088	yeah
S0136	it's all go to be absolutely book up because it's mother sunday
S0088	that's true that's true it be all book up isn't it really the only place i could think of that might not be be do you know do you know the um
S0136	yeah it's uh i've never be there but i know about the place
S0088	cos they're always i mean to me they seem they're hunt customers really
S0136	mm
S0088	so that might be somewhere to go i might pop along there so it's this sunday isn't it
S0136	i think so yeah
S0088	yeah
S0136	yeah my son make me a card at playgroup eh well i'm say he make it he just stick some kind of you know stickers and that cos it be already make you know but still it be quite sweet really you know
S0088	that be really sweet
S0136	yeah he make it yesterday with when he go to the mother and toddler group with my mother in law so it be quite cute
S0088	my daughter make you know she'd make she get she think it be last sunday
S0136	mm hm
S0088	so she think mother's day be last sunday so i wake up on sunday to find this card all make for me and she have inside the card she have make these like mock envelope and in the envelope be these tokens three three no five tokens three clean tokens and two she do nail varnish so she's go to do my nail
S0136	ah that's quite sweet really yeah
S0088	that's really sweet isn't it so she hasn't be to the shop or anything she just get these little tokens so i have to make use of that this weekend to do my work for me
S0136	oh i look forward to the time when my son can give me tokens for hoover and clean if it ever happen i don't think it will though
S0088	so how old be your kid
S0136	well his uh a twenty one month old so
S0088	oh yeah
S0136	he's quite small yeah he's gonna be two in june
S0088	so the hoover be probably still quite interest
S0136	oh yeah he's fascinate by it absolutely yeah
S0088	fascinate
S0136	just every time i hoover he just you know he just want to grab it and just do it all himself maybe i should buy him a toy one or something
S0088	i remember that i remember my son use to he be so interest in the hoover he also use to pull it out all the time pull it out of the plug and um and then it's kind of change you know the hoover go on it's like shut up i want to watch the tv i want to watch the tv
S0136	how do things change yeah it be quite concern actually cos we usually take him to early learn centre or something like that and just let him you know choose whatever toy he want
S0088	yeah
S0136	just to see what he would play with naturally
S0088	mm
S0136	and sadly so far it's always be clean equipment be there some sort of toy set for like cleaners there be i be sort of you know this clean trolley with like you know sort of you know brush and that sort of thing
S0088	mm
S0136	he seem to enjoy play with that
S0088	so you just take him somewhere and just let him just see what he would choose
S0136	just out of interest really we don't necessarily buy it for him but you know just just to see what he would be interest in you know
S0088	that's that's good cos my son be pretty similar he like clean things things that do something
S0136	yeah
S0088	like a hoover or a brush or a anything that be to do something
S0136	yeah it's copy adults as well isn't it
S0088	yeah
S0136	it's like if you if he watch adults do something he want to do the same thing you know
S0088	i seem to remember tool kit as well
S0136	oh yeah
S0088	he love tool kit
S0136	yeah we try to hide the one that's uh use
S0088	do he try and get in it do he try
S0136	yeah very much so
S0088	have you try buy him little plastic tool and things but they're just not the same be they they want the real thing
S0136	he know he know they're not real so he want to play with the actual grow up toy and obviously the the iphones and ipads and things like this you know he just love it yeah he keep play with ' iphone because there's you know this program with all the animal voice he love it um like just like just a little app thing you know
S0088	yeah
S0136	and the same on the ipad as well it's get different apps for like you know piano and you know drum that sort of thing
S0088	i bet he's just so he that age it's quite it's quite intense isn't it it's quite full on
S0136	yeah so yeah it's a shame really that i don't get to see it you know fully because you know he's like with a childminder some days and with my mother in law other days yeah
S0088	but it do give you that break as well doesn't it
S0136	uh if you call it a break it's work
S0088	mental difference isn't it it's just a it's a break in term of you're not do i always find do the same thing all the time be quite hard
S0136	i think so
S0088	even though it's something you enjoy i mean like spend time with your son be be enjoyable
S0136	yeah
S0088	but do that all the time can get a bite too intense
S0136	hmm
S0088	like when i be when the kid be little
S0136	well maybe
S0088	i be really keen to to just mix and match up my life a bite as well so that um i have that adult time as well as be with them and
S0136	yeah i don't know the way i feel now i just really want to go to you know uh play group with him and do activities and things and i've i never get to do it
S0088	hmm
S0136	you see
S0088	oh yeah see that's that's something that you it be a good good time aren't they the good time
S0136	yeah definitely but then you know i wish i could sort of you know maybe go part time or something like that but it's not the right job to go part time sadly
S0088	it isn't really be it
S0136	no well
S0088	no but it's because it's a day in day out job isn't it really it's not gonna that's what i like about mine i've get three days and i can i see my way through three days but by friday i feel like i've do you know i feel like i've do a full a week really
S0136	yeah
S0088	and also at the moment it's be very full on cos we've be look for new staff but luckily we've get two new staff start so yeah you should have an easier time
S0136	yeah brilliant yeah i didn't know that they be go to appoint like two people cos i think it be just one

S0088	hmm
