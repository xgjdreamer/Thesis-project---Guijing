S0678	it's so yeah it's like twelve pound a burger and you've gotta pay for the chip and a drink but i mean it's worth it
S0671	i always i i think it be like quite i think it be quite like small like erm as in like er there wasn't much to it
S0678	oh really
S0671	but maybe that be just a quiet
S0678	the one i have recently be call the mighty just like two two patties cheese bacon er
S0671	and egg
S0678	i don't think there be egg
S0671	hash brown
S0678	just everything it be just like that
S0671	bake bean

S0671	kind of classic underdog
S0678	yeah that be i just don't like man unite
S0671	yeah mm yeah i think the fact that they're call the red devil be

S0678	yeah
S0671	no way
S0678	he get sack the morning after
S0671	no i didn't realise that
S0678	yeah erm i think josé mourinho be gonna replace him
S0671	that'd be interest
S0678	yeah
S0671	oh i'm not sure i like that
S0678	i don't think he'll do a very good job
S0671	what will mourinho be like at what would mourinho be like at erm
S0678	i dunno
S0671	i don't think anyone will like him cos
S0678	they didn't like van gaal because he be too defensive
S0671	and they didn't like
S0678	and
S0671	david moyes because he be rubbish
S0678	yeah and mourinho be so i mean he's good but he always have like really good team to work with i don't think the unite team's that good personally
S0671	no i think it's be so much better in the past hasn't it
S0678	yeah
S0671	i just don't i don't i don't know if he erm appreciate unite enough cos obviously he's be chelsea for a while be just pay gonna be enough motivation for him to make them do well
S0678	i assume it would be not that he need the money
S0671	no who would you you would obviously manage liverpool wouldn't you do you want klopp to erm you want klopp to stay on don't you
S0678	yeah no i really like klopp oh

S0678	he's at city isn't he next year
S0671	he's at city next year i think city should have mourinho cos they've actually get a seriously good team
S0678	yeah yeah
S0671	i think mourinho would do well at city
S0678	erm
S0671	but then i i know nothing about it
S0678	i probably want erm city to have a qualifier for the champion league
S0671	do they qualify this year

S0678	yes just cos pep guardiola
S0671	yeah
S0678	have always have well he barcelona
S0671	yeah

S0678	with george clooney and
S0671	yeah oh mate that look good
S0678	it look so good doesn't it it's not out

S0678	some guy get stitch up lose all his money try to have like a terrorist situation on live tv or
S0671	yeah
S0678	it just seem like a really nice really good not nice but you know what i mean like
S0671	yeah like heartwarming
S0678	really heartwarming premise
S0671	a family film
S0678	such a family film no
S0678	er it just seem like a really interest premise to a story
S0671	mm but bad neighbour be basically just gonna be bad neighbour all over again isn't it
S0678	i assume so but they're sorority rather than er
S0671	oh okay yeah i'm erm think about i think yesterday about organise a er if i be ever to organise a stag do
S0678	yeah
S0671	erm i think it's get close to one of my friends like potentially could do it in in the next like six months or something
S0678	okay
S0671	could get marry so
S0678	yeah
S0671	if i be ever to organise one i be just think about it what oh what would erm oh what what would you do if you have to organise one
S0678	i have absolutely no idea what would you do
S0671	my idea at the moment be a er erm be a lord of the ring one
S0678	okay
S0671	erm oh get over there now erm so you er you dress up so like you dress him up a frodo
S0671	give him the not the ring but maybe a ring
S0678	yeah
S0671	erm and then he have to get from one place to another place with his trusty band of followers
S0678	okay
S0671	but he's the only one who's dress up obviously to like
S0678	just embarrass him
S0671	just embarrass him and he have to do like a sequence of challenge on his way
S0678	okay
S0671	like lord of the ring theme so i'm i like i just can't remember enough about lord of the ring to do it i be just think of it yesterday but what kind of things could i like include i be think maybe have a meal where he have to order something like you know the chip
S0678	yeah
S0671	he have cos there's a scene isn't there where they some chip so it's for eat we could have chip but he have to go and order it dress as frodo what else what other like challenge could i do i've get
S0678	erm
S0671	erm i think like go er across a lake on go across a lake on his own he have to choose someone as samwise gamgee
S0678	there's a song they sing as there's a song they sing isn't there merry and pip do on the table
S0671	oh yeah erm
S0678	you could make him do that i can't think of how it go but i haven't see it in age
S0678	the one thing that stand out in my mind be when they first go to the the pub to find erm when they first meet aragorn
S0671	yeah
S0678	and erm one of them come back with like a pint
S0671	oh yeah
S0678	what's that
S0678	that my friend be a pint they serve it in pints
S0678	i'm get one you've get a whole half already
S0678	just i dunno why
S0671	fantastic yeah
S0671	cos i think like we could we could end up at cos how er the film end like on a mountain doesn't it but it'd be kind of cool to end
S0678	on a mountain
S0671	on a mountain
S0678	where be you take him

S0671	oscar wilde would be hilarious
S0671	erm
S0678	dickens would be quite funny

S0671	oh yeah
S0671	an interest set of
S0678	i i can't remember i think it might be closer to the end actually than the middle can't remember
S0671	i think that be quite near the end yeah
S0678	that be really good oh
S0671	oh my goodness oh my goodness
S0678	my goodness
S0671	i don't like the sound of that erm erm yeah er what what do you think of the the book in general

S0671	do you
S0678	so i've i know load of people
S0671	you haven't
S0678	who've be like it's not as good as frankenstein but i'm sure that's plainly obvious see as i only ever think frankenstein mary shelley only write frankenstein

S0678	didn't even know she write the last man until this course
S0671	yeah
S0678	yeah
S0671	erm
S0678	i think i haven't read the end but i quite like the premise if people die quicker
S0671	yeah
S0678	and that the last half of the book would be just the one person i think that'd be quite like a
S0671	yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah
S0678	and then just go and feel like a mix of emotions and experience and just be but like
S0671	could speculate a lot more couldn't
S0678	yeah
S0671	cos it felt like he actually wasn't the last man for age it wasn't a book about the last man
S0678	no
S0671	it be just
S0671	like about him and his life
S0678	yeah
S0671	which be interest but it wasn't really
