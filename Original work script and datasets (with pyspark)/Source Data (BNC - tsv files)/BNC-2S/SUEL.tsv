S0180	oh do you see in the metro there's a full page advert advertise west ham's brighton game
S0070	oh be there
S0180	do you see it
S0070	no
S0180	advertise ticket
S0070	it's sell out though i think
S0180	really
S0070	well i mean mine mine er neck of the woods be
S0180	be you go to that cos you've get a ticket haven't you
S0070	yeah saturday
S0180	be that be it a crunch game or something cos west ham can't
S0070	well it would've be
S0180	get automatic
S0070	i i i think if they probably if they win every game and and read and southampton don't
S0180	ah
S0070	it they probably could but to be honest they don't deserve automatic promotion
S0180	you want them to suffer a bite more
S0070	i want them to suffer yeah
S0180	before they go in
S0070	yeah if
S0180	my cousin my cousin er friend's cousin play for read
S0070	oh yeah he do
S0180	yeah
S0070	doesn't he i remember that yeah yeah
S0180	um so i say to him oh it look like he's play premiership football next season
S0070	huh huh
S0180	cos they're gonna
S0070	yeah no for sure and i think you know southampton should because they've be up there pretty much the whole of the season and read have kind of creep up slowly and you know well do to them and it's odd because west ham be sing when um when they equalize on be it monday night
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	they be sing to the the who be they play who be they play birmingham fan three nil and you give it away three three one and you give it away three one and you give it away and i be think hang on a minute you be one nil and you give it away last week you be
S0070	two one up against read and you and actual fact you be on the top of the championship and you give that away it's west ham's history to give it away you know
S0180	it's pot call kettle black
S0070	yeah exactly they're just daft they really be daft and
S0180	cos you oh you go to that game as well
S0070	mm monday
S0180	oh yeah that's the one that i be gonna go
S0070	one nil up
S0180	mm
S0070	and then they go two one down in the space of two minutes
S0180	look how they've advertise it top of the table clash or something but it look like they're not gonna that be print recently that's today's metro
S0070	yeah yeah cos it's saturday so
S0180	push for a promotion
S0070	no i mean mm and and brighton be just out of the er at the
S0180	oh no
S0070	playoff place
S0180	the fourth position yeah
S0070	so they're so they're try to sort of
S0180	be we
S0070	they lose last night
S0180	i always think it's unfair when the team in the playoffs that's just the way it be isn't it but the the third place team like um where luton be play
S0070	mm
S0180	third place team be wrexham
S0070	uh huh
S0180	and they've get ninety point sorry the second team
S0070	oh okay
S0180	first team qualify automatically
S0070	mm
S0180	they've get a hundred and one point
S0070	right
S0180	wrexham be second
S0070	mhm
S0180	at ninety point during the play off the team below them be with eighty point
S0070	okay
S0180	and the two team below them have get seventy one
S0070	mm mm
S0180	so wrexham could go into the play off with a team that be twenty point behind them
S0070	and lose
S0180	ah
S0070	mm
S0180	it doesn't seem fair do it
S0070	not really
S0180	yeah
S0070	but then again you know with something someone like west ham it be fair
S0070	because they they've be arseholes and they deserve to you know where a team like brighton who come up from the division two last year didn't they
S0180	yeah i think so
S0070	yeah
S0180	and crawley have go play in the first division now
S0070	yeah
S0180	they come up with the gold they get some mysterious money behind them though
S0070	have they crawley
S0180	which they're not say who where it's come from
S0070	yeah exeter look like they're go down again don't they
S0180	yeah exeter yeah hopeless team aren't they and luton luton be not even in the playoffs now
S0070	be they not
S0180	no they lose to braintree
S0180	three one

S0180	really
S0070	yeah
S0180	i'm surprise at that because um come come back the other way into britain
S0070	so yeah what there be apparently cos cos i be watch countryfile about this a few weeks ago and now there's no longer a scare about rabies what there be a worry about be some like intestinal worm
S0180	mm
S0070	that can be pick up so what they do be they give a vaccination in on the continent
S0180	oh
S0070	and as long as you have a certificate you can bring it back
S0180	oh that's good
S0070	and bring them back
S0180	ah
S0070	cos there be talk about like pet passports but i think
S0180	mm
S0070	that's obviously a bite a bite bite silly isn't it i don't know whether that be just a bite of a you know bite of a joke really
S0180	imagine try to tell the difference between tabby cat
S0070	smile
S0180	wah
S0070	or get them to take a photograph i mean my little dog never stay still
S0070	more than two second
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah so that's quite handy really
S0180	mm
S0070	she's over there till i don't know when i think they start back next week
S0180	it's only a two week break isn't it
S0070	mm mm and then they'll be after another couple of weeks they'll be on summer break i suppose may isn't it
S0180	oh good yeah a lot of progress on the phd
S0070	ah well i be talk to someone this week i'm wait for to get back to me
S0180	cos there be some nice mornings
S0070	yeah
S0180	yet today and yesterday
S0070	yeah
S0180	it should've be rain but
S0070	no it's be
S0180	beautiful
S0070	it's hold out hasn't it
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah cos we have quite a lot of rain on sunday didn't we be it sunday it rain all day
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	monday
S0180	the garden need it though
S0070	yeah no that be nice
S0180	you didn't sit out in your in a tent
S0070	no
S0180	in the garden
S0070	no i manage to do some in the cos in the morning we get some nice sun come in
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	and doesn't normally get up until late so
S0180	aha you can type away
S0070	well yeah but it take you so long like be say about this as well you know that it's not something that you can just sit down
S0180	no
S0070	and sort of like oh i'll just have half an hour here and half an hour there it take you half an hour to kind of get back into the zone
S0180	but do you have like a stream of consciousness and then you go back and edit it or
S0070	i
S0180	do you ever
S0070	um i'm begin to start to do that
S0180	cut and paste and change it
S0070	well yeah and i think that's a cos i tend to to sort of sit down and try and do it in my head and then try to write it perfectly first time but it's of course it's impossible isn't it it's better just to get your ideas down and then play around with them cos cos you can't cos it it's funny isn't it like you know these i be gonna say to that that you you sometimes you can only explain things by write it
S0180	mm
S0070	cos it it
S0180	yeah
S0070	it's impossible to say it and and
S0180	you need to have more clauses
S0070	exactly
S0180	in your write
S0070	yeah which you couldn't do if you be if you be speak without someone lose train of think
S0180	yeah exactly
S0070	right
S0180	that's an interest um differentiation isn't it
S0070	it be it be yeah and i be i be think how you know by write be also be where you you also get ideas
S0180	mm
S0070	as well and
S0180	mm
S0070	that you'd never probably i don't know how it how it happen but um
S0180	and you can focus on your train of think and so can the reader
S0070	i i suppose so
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's different from a speak
S0070	yeah
S0180	lecture isn't it
S0070	mm
S0180	or or yeah
S0070	yeah which you do kind of lose track of what's go on especially if someone's read from write text
S0180	i mean who isn't interest in how and give their lecture obviously they've be
S0070	mm
S0180	do them a long time
S0070	mm
S0180	so they don't need note anymore they just
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	do it don't they
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	and
S0070	be just
S0180	cos you've see them quite a few years
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	haven't you
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and it's the same
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	same presentation
S0070	pretty much the same kind of quite well rehearse
S0180	just add some more up to date anecdotes maybe yeah
S0070	i suppose yeah yeah cos i suppose
S0180	that's good that's what it's about isn't it
S0070	yeah i suppose yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0180	cos that's your skill that's your performance if you have that body of knowledge
S0070	yeah
S0180	and you're ready
S0070	mm
S0180	once you can unless you unless something's radically change in that area you don't need to update it
S0070	which it's probably not
S0180	yeah
S0070	in the world of sociolinguistics
S0180	no no
S0070	be it
S0180	they earn their money in the mark probably don't they
S0070	yeah
S0180	in the
S0070	yeah
S0180	after a while
S0070	oh yes have you hear from
S0180	no so i assume she either a get bad mark and think i'm not use him again
S0070	right
S0180	or b doesn't need me anymore
S0070	mm
S0180	and be do well er
S0070	or c
S0070	they haven't get assignments until
S0180	that's true yeah
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	or d yeah or yeah a or go back to a i be completely wrong
S0180	and she get really poor mark and think what the hell do i pay that for no i think it be alright really i i help to give her shape ideas
S0070	mm
S0180	she be a bite all over the not all over the place she have some good ideas but she didn't know how to simply yeah simply structure it
S0070	and that's funny because she do two course at bls
S0180	yeah well obviously they didn't do much for her
S0070	but be she be she it's difficult to tell with japanese isn't it cos
S0180	yeah
S0070	bite kind of like say one thing and
S0180	yeah
S0070	think another
S0180	yeah
S0070	but but but be she
S0180	not want to offend and yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	like take advice but do something
S0070	yeah
S0180	cos i wonder if she
S0070	i think she do appreciate you though i think i
S0180	yeah she do cos she say at the end oh that be really useful thank
S0070	oh okay yeah
S0180	she say that be quite positive
S0070	okay yeah i mean i can imagine that they be a bite more clue in like that than some of the others that we have run ins with who want just what's the answer
S0180	yeah yeah and you could see they get really impatient didn't they some of them with the exploration part of the ma
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	the whole point of an ma be to explore your analyze
S0070	yeah yeah it's a research degree isn't it
S0180	yeah but they seem very impatient with that they each want an answer
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	and like that's not the spirit of an ma be it
S0070	not really they should do a teacher train course like a diploma
S0180	but why would it make you realize doesn't it i mean we're in education but we think there be only set answer that's quite scary actually
S0070	i suppose
S0180	we weren't prepare to think outside the box
S0070	no
S0180	be we
S0070	but then i suppose if they come from background er where education do provide the answer then
S0180	mm exactly
S0070	then that's what they
S0180	well yeah you have you have uzbekistan thailand greece even
S0070	mm
S0180	greece be quite it's not cut edge i think
S0070	i would imagine
S0180	which be bizarre because they've get you know rhetoric and all that ancient
S0070	mm
S0180	greek philosophy
S0070	yeah
S0180	you'd think it would be
S0070	mm
S0180	filter down through education
S0070	dunno
S0180	but know yeah so have you hear any more from yet
S0070	no she send a message a few weeks ago to say about meet up
S0180	cos i bump into her on the bus stop
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	she look she look really feed up she be say oh i want to i want to find me some research work
S0070	right wow
S0180	she say she can't she say everything be dodgy about the school she say and everything be dodgy in the industry and she be really quite you know how she get quite
S0070	yeah
S0180	dark moody difficult
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	maybe serbians be like that i've hear very very morose
S0070	yeah that's what i use to quite like about her actually you know
S0070	she she be very cynical about the language community and quite rightly so
S0180	mm
S0070	you know cos she's
S0180	yeah from what she's from what she's say it sound like she's of that
S0070	mm
S0180	er um mm type of school i be in when i first come back from china
S0070	oh okay can't help you
S0180	school that do every yeah yeah yeah that do everything
S0070	okay
S0180	and nothing
S0070	yeah well what do you want
S0180	we do secretarial
S0180	computer english
S0070	what do you want really
S0180	english and physics english and medicine
S0070	we can do it
S0180	oh no yes that be the attitude
S0070	yeah i bet it be
S0180	it be funny though cos the guy who run the place er i think his name be
S0070	uh huh
S0180	do have his autobiographies behind his desk and and he have margaret thatcher's autobiography behind his desk and all these book about business on the shelf he's obviously get a lot you know like a conservative um
S0070	yeah
S0180	business drive sort of guy but
S0070	they close down didn't they
S0180	well yeah
S0180	well no he actually he's now a school in er
S0070	ah
S0180	so to give him credit they have go on and make themselves quite a nice little school there
S0070	okay
S0180	but the the school they be share with be more dodgy i think it be run by iranians who be run this dodgy medical school
S0180	which close and
S0070	there's always a dodgy git behind it isn't there
S0180	oh yeah but if they've close a lot of they've close the twenty hours a week loophole now
S0070	have they
S0180	so you so the students can't work twenty hours a week now
S0070	at all
S0180	no unless they're at university if you're at a language school now you have to fund the entire thing yourself you can't work twenty hours a week that use to be the case last year
S0070	mm
S0180	up until last year now you're only allow to do that if you're in higher education
S0070	higher education
S0180	not in the language
S0070	yeah
S0180	see that's why i think a lot of place get less longer term people
S0070	yeah mm mm
S0180	cos in that school in london
S0070	mm
S0180	we have koreans who come for like a year
S0070	absolutely yeah
S0180	now they won't because they can't work
S0070	that be the thing wasn't it mm
S0180	you know have a year work and study
S0070	mm
S0180	and tour and which be nice actually if you think about it it's it's a great
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	thing to to do
S0070	yeah
S0180	but that's be close
S0070	but then again you know er so many students just come through it to do the work and not the study
S0180	oh yeah yeah
S0070	as a way of get your feet
S0180	that's true yeah
S0070	in the country and then disappear
S0180	yeah that's just it yeah
S0070	which be mm
S0180	well yeah
S0070	mm
S0180	people abuse the system didn't they
S0070	absolutely er er school owners and students
S0180	yeah
S0070	be
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	school owners particularly
S0180	mm mm mm mm
S0070	to be honest with you
S0180	mm mm mm
S0070	i wonder so um look for some research stuff i think she's
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	maybe we should go into a school and do some what be we talk you be gonna do some article thing the other day you mention
S0180	about um oo i've i've forget now i be all passionate about it wasn't i but
S0070	yeah
S0180	that didn't last long do it
S0180	no oh yeah the um extrovert character favour over
S0070	go
S0180	but i think i i can't remember if i read the article in the observer and it be a more general article or if it be in the teach magazine already and it be someone talk about tefl and
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	extrovert bias towards extroverts
S0070	oh right
S0180	i think it it might have be in that
S0070	cos
S0070	cos i cos
S0070	it it would be quite interest wouldn't it just to to observe you know how teachers respond to
S0180	mm
S0070	more vulnerable
S0180	be it definitely the downturn be it definitely extrovert lead bias
S0070	what extrovert in term of the teachers
S0180	extrovert in term teachers and the students
S0070	i i suppose in that i mean i remember when i do my
S0180	nothing on read for example
S0070	no no
S0180	the the the book review that we do exactly so that's more introvert
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	type activities
S0070	right
S0180	whereas the i dunno maybe sort of more about get them to communicate still it's not
S0070	well yeah yeah pretty much and there's and there's such a focus on student student interaction
S0180	mm
S0070	you know again that that students have to be do stuff
S0180	right yeah yeah
S0070	with other students
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know the
S0180	that would be class as extrovert
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	cos introvert would be like work alone do a project
S0070	right
S0180	book project or
S0070	yeah
S0180	um any sort of research but that doesn't figure in tefl activities so much
S0070	no they don't do they
S0180	it be it be bias towards communicative stroke extrovert
S0070	but then old what do old say about come into the classroom he say unless teacher unless students be talk in the classroom there's no point in them be there
S0180	really
S0070	they may as well yeah and er i think that's
S0180	ah
S0070	kind of like an attitude that you know when they come to the classroom they should be do speak activities
S0180	do they think that's what they pay for
S0070	cos that's what and and they can be do other things like write at home
S0180	but to be fair that a lot of students do
S0070	but have you
S0180	feel that don't they
S0070	yes but how many time have you say to students you know okay your homework be this piece of write and how many time
S0180	oh right

S0180	no it's true it's true cos yeah generally this be more yeah whimsical isn't it
S0070	mm
S0180	whimsical
S0070	mm
S0180	it be though well
S0070	it be it be it be i mean i yeah and and as far as like the teacher teacher go i think you do you're suppose to be an extrovert i remember on the
S0180	yeah

S0180	mm
S0070	of people and he say well why do you come into teach then
S0180	oh no really
S0070	well yeah just beacuse i'm shy and i don't like act the idiot and clown around
S0180	doesn't mean you're gonna be a bad teacher
S0070	doesn't doesn't mean yeah you know
S0180	but no that be definitely i remember quite a few character in my course
S0070	mm
S0180	and they be the sort who could sort of like um who want to teach their students bohemian rhapsody
S0070	yeah
S0180	and all that sort of stuff and you know
S0180	who care

S0070	no but yes yeah
S0180	imagine that try to teach your students bohemian rhapsody
S0180	i mean they must they must think it absolutely bonkers wouldn't they
S0070	and let's concept check galileo
S0180	oh god beelzebub and all that palaver
S0070	yeah
S0180	but yeah he get the box tick probably for extrovert
S0070	oh absolutely probably student
S0180	fun
S0070	student interaction they be have a great time they be on task
S0070	and at the end of it they be able to sing bohemian rhapsody
S0180	no they weren't
S0070	perhaps not no
S0180	it's funny you say er to mention bohemian rhapsody cos of the website the last school i be in they have a video of the students all sing it as well
S0070	do they
S0180	yeah
S0070	bohemian rhapsody
S0180	mm but you know each student do a different part but it be so bad it be it be embarrass
S0070	and these be mainly korean students
S0180	on the course yeah well yeah on the course
S0070	who must have really enjoy that
S0070	be make tell to make a complete tit out of themselves cos can you imagine you're in your your swahili class or whatever
S0070	your mandarin class and someone say right we're gonna we're gonna learn bohemian rhapsody in swahili and you and and you're all gonna sing a part and we're gonna film you
S0180	it would be
S0070	there be one girl
S0180	no i want to know how to buy stamp in the post office
S0070	yeah something useful
S0180	for example
S0070	no you're gonna sing bohemian rhapsody make a fool of yourself yeah there be one one chap um at at london meet
S0070	teacher there and he record some er he be do he be share the class with me and my students complain to me afterwards say
S0180	oh
S0070	cos he record them do presentations and put them on youtube without their permission and they be
S0180	oh dear yeah
S0070	they be really angry about it you know
S0180	he should've ask their permission yeah
S0070	he should have do really but i think he think he be do
S0180	it's so public
S0070	you know
S0180	but why do he put it on youtube it's not
S0070	i don't know i don't know i suppose he be english language teacher and he think that'd be great
S0180	probably think that be the fashionable thing to do and er
S0070	yeah we can put it on youtube and then you can watch it and you can look at what mistake you're make
S0180	of course for them that's a very public loss of face
S0070	oh yeah yeah absolutely i mean i wouldn't wanna
S0180	yeah
S0070	be anywhere near that kind of forum
S0180	how do you put videos on youtube anyway
S0070	i don't know you have to join i think yeah it be
S0180	yeah no no i would always ask permission er for that sort of thing yeah it's like facebook as well
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	i wouldn't put picture of other people's kid up there
S0070	mm
S0070	no
S0180	but it's funny isn't it yeah i think um i mean also you get the a lot of continental students come here with the idea that it's a fun summer school
S0070	yeah
S0180	and we're
S0070	yeah
S0180	but yeah the koreans or from the far east or middle east the they come it's different concept of what they're there for isn't it
S0070	absolutely yeah
S0180	some yeah it's for fun but
S0070	yeah
S0180	others it's like why be we do
S0070	where do they get that from and so those group you use to have the italian group why do they come
S0180	well i they just
S0070	think it's a
S0180	to to london it's it's a
S0070	right yeah
S0180	primarily to to london
S0070	so how be it sell to them how do they
S0180	i don't know
S0070	to london
S0180	sell to their parent
S0070	right
S0180	they're take a child to london for three weeks they're gonna learn english in the mornings and in the afternoons we do excursions
S0070	mm
S0180	the teenagers of course it's more fun to be
S0070	mm
S0180	you know on the excursions isn't it
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	but the parent it the parent be pay something towards it
S0070	yeah
S0180	then that that justify the expense i think
S0070	do you know how much they pay
S0180	or i've get no idea
S0070	but a lot or
S0180	probably a fair amount probably i would say must be about two hundred three hundred pound for a two week trip
S0070	right
S0180	plus accommodation
S0070	okay
S0180	and travel
S0070	accommodation in a hostel
S0180	host family
S0070	host family ah yeah yeah
S0180	and some of them be really bare minimum
S0070	that's another scam as well
S0180	i know yeah
S0070	a host family
S0180	it's more like a lodger lodge a bed in a room you know
S0070	one lad one lad he be in from er what's it call london meet he say um his host family use didn't use to allow him to eat downstairs he use to have to eat up in his room
S0180	yeah oh yeah some some be very welcome
S0070	mm
S0180	you be part of the family but others you i definitely get the impression from talk to the er students that it's more like a yeah see and not hear sort of
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	arrangement
S0070	get bed that's it
S0180	yeah breakfast er you know when you come down there's the cornflakes you know and er there's a bowl
S0180	nice introduction to english culture isn't it
S0070	yeah and then they arrive at school and some twit start make them jump up and down
S0070	and sing bohemian rhapsody put it on youtube my god what be wrong with these people
S0180	but it's ah yeah ridiculous but i mean the the group keep come back so obviously
S0070	yeah
S0180	er i don't the agents i don't
S0070	right
S0180	quite trust you know cos er whenever i try to communicate with through the agents
S0070	right
S0180	you never get a straight answer you know what do they want to learn you know to make their time useful
S0070	mm
S0180	and cor
S0070	mm
S0180	and the agents didn't know even um sometimes they even forget to ask
S0070	cos i i suppose again i mean they just they just advertise it as this theme
S0180	yeah
S0070	come to london
S0180	it's terrible
S0070	what do they want to learn
S0180	it's terrible
S0070	i don't know what they wanna learn they wanna come to london and learn english that's what they come to learn english isn't it and see some things
S0180	it be interest get an insight in that cos i guess all the school on the south coast they're like that as well
S0070	mm mm
S0180	it's like it's like travel basically
S0070	it be yeah and which er explain why it's probably aim towards the extrovert because
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	you know outgo people
S0180	activities yeah
S0070	activity people and
S0180	that word activity it's so strange isn't it
S0070	yeah
S0180	what do it mean read could be an activity
S0070	i suppose so sleep be an activity
S0180	yeah today we're gonna practice sleep mm
S0070	okay
S0070	yay
S0180	i felt like that oftentimes i have to say
S0070	yes yes
S0180	kid from the group but anyway enough of that
S0070	which be you record
S0180	yeah
S0070	ah
S0180	it doesn't matter
S0070	where be you go on holiday this year
S0180	mm devon
S0070	just there
S0180	er nowhere else just devon for a few days
S0070	oh okay
S0180	yeah um by train
S0070	by train oo expensive
S0180	um yeah it wasn't too bad actually but um cos i book on um southwest train
S0070	you book already
S0180	number yeah forty pound return for one person
S0070	oh that's quite good
S0180	no yes forty pound return first class
S0070	really oo how posh
S0070	from where
S0180	from um waterloo
S0070	waterloo
S0180	yeah
S0070	to exeter
S0180	exeter central yeah
S0070	mhm
S0180	cos if you book um quite a lot in advance it should be a lot cheaper i think
S0070	mm
S0180	cos how do you go down to devon usually
S0070	i haven't be for age but er what do i do last time no i book the train last time but i book in advance again
S0180	ah hm
S0070	yeah
S0180	you don't get the coach national express coach
S0070	no because my sister now live in
S0180	oh right
S0070	and it's a real troublesome journey because you have to go to and then change and the er there's like one straight through coach a a a day
S0180	mm mm
S0070	it take like six or seven hours so
S0180	that's the problem with isn't it not not er very frequent coach
S0070	no
S0180	or bus
S0070	no
S0180	mm and so where be you go apart from
S0070	i don't know it depend on how and when i finish this work dissertation and er
S0180	it's tough isn't it really
S0070	i wouldn't mind just somewhere quiet really have a break
S0180	get away from road
S0070	away from road yeah yeah and somewhere where they don't speak english
S0180	oh right
S0070	so i haven't get to think about anything
S0180	you go to turkey though didn't you last time
S0070	i do go to turkey yeah yeah yeah
S0180	how do you like it
S0070	i didn't really
S0070	like it
S0180	oh
S0070	yeah
S0180	why
S0070	well because one we go to avoid christmas that be one of the reason
S0180	mm
S0070	we go and we think go to a a country which have a different religion
S0180	mm
S0070	but because it be a tourist part of istanbul
S0180	istanbul wasn't it
S0070	yeah
S0180	mm
S0070	and because it be
S0180	very touristy
S0070	very touristy
S0180	mm
S0070	they be celebrate christmas more than we celebrate it here
S0180	really mm
S0070	so all the shop have happy christmas spray on it and
S0070	you go into a bar happy christmas
S0180	mm
S0070	so i don't like that
S0070	and then and so in the
S0180	too commercialize
S0070	too commercialize and then outside be also too commercialize
S0180	mm
S0070	because you walk down the street and they everybody want to sell you something
S0180	mm mm
S0070	oh buy a carpet come in have a look at this
S0070	give you a tour up the bosphorus i can cappadocia
S0180	do you go to the um well my last boss go to go to turkey a lot but he
S0070	mhm
S0180	he go to the coast
S0070	okay
S0180	where there be lot of roman ruin
S0070	ah
S0180	it's quite nice and quiet on the coast there
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah he avoid istanbul
S0070	yeah i think i i would advise anybody to
S0180	nice to visit there but probably off season not on season
S0070	off season and probably it's best if you do it as a coach i would say a coach tour would be ideal
S0180	mm
S0070	because er they would take you to the to the sort of the important landmarks
S0180	oh yeah yeah
S0070	and you would you know you go to the grand bazaar which be interest to have a look at but they whisk you through it
S0180	yeah you don't have your freedom to go i don't like tour like that
S0070	well i don't but but normally i don't but in a in a place where you get constant hassle from the people
S0180	yeah
S0070	it's probably best to go in a in a tour group because you know me and my wife would go out in the morning and in the even just for a walk and you can't look at anything in the shop
S0180	yeah
S0070	because someone as soon as you look at something they want to sell it to you
S0180	mm
S0070	they don't have that same kind of window shop
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	culture that we have here
S0180	and you're obviously tourists so
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	yeah and so to them anyone with tourists have have get money and want to spend it
S0180	i think that happen anywhere now er you have to go really off off the beat track you have to go somewhere where they haven't not many tourists really
S0070	mm
S0180	cos most place destinations in the world will be
S0070	true
S0180	quite commercial i think yeah
S0070	yeah so where be this in turkey where your boss go
S0180	i can't remember it it be on the south coast
S0070	mm
S0180	opposite cyprus
S0070	oh
S0180	that way if you know the geography
S0070	i've hear of antalya
S0180	yeah mhm
S0070	seem to be where a lot of people go
S0180	somewhere yeah i don't know i know big towns there but the sort of resort
S0070	right
S0180	hotels on the coast yeah
S0070	mm
S0180	but i've never be to the mediterranean actually apart from i've never be no
S0070	really
S0180	apart from nowhere i've never be to the mediterranean
S0070	i've never be to the mediterranean
S0180	any country italy spain france
S0070	yeah but
S0180	mediterranean
S0070	i've never really go to the sea
S0180	oh right okay
S0070	i'm not a sea sort of i don't know i don't lounge on the beach and that sort of thing anyway really
S0180	mm
S0070	get too restless
S0070	mm
S0180	should be enough
