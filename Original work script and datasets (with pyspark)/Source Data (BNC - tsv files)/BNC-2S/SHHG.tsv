S0439	okay
S0444	i don't think the thing be that if it be be it nottingham or some ridiculous
S0439	they have a nottingham tour yeah or nottingham space
S0444	i don't think like i'd get to like erm so so i be like well if i come up and see you and i be like how do i get to mine from here
S0439	mm
S0444	then that would be fair enough cos it would turn out well one of them be on a friday i think and that be the nottingham one and one of them be on a sunday and i be like be it gonna be tricky for both of us
S0439	yeah
S0444	to get back on a sunday night like do you know that kind of way i be a bite like if it start at half seven it won't finish until nine ten
S0439	mm
S0444	it's alright on the tube but you're still push it to get back the last one and i have no idea
S0439	yeah
S0444	what it's like to so i be just like mm that be my only thing where i be like that's why i be like
S0439	so we could do the nottingham the nottingham be fine for me
S0444	that's why i be like well in cardiff we could always do like a mini like a
S0439	yeah
S0444	mini little trip like out there like cos cardiff i really like cardiff as a place so i be like we could always just like go
S0439	i haven't be to cardiff
S0444	go on a saturday and then like
S0439	yeah
S0444	hang out there for the day go to the gig
S0439	yeah
S0444	have a few drink and then mooch around on the sunday like
S0439	yeah
S0444	if you want and i don't know what it's like get there from might be a bite of a pain but
S0439	to cardiff be hard but
S0444	come to
S0439	yeah come to first
S0444	if you come to on that friday right if you chill in on the friday
S0439	yeah
S0444	go to cardiff on the saturday
S0439	so when be that next march
S0444	yeah so it's
S0439	yeah
S0444	not for a while
S0439	yeah
S0444	so we we have time so i be just like be you gonna be in the country by that point or be it june i can't remember
S0439	i be gonna be in the country in march i think if i go to oz it'll be in june
S0444	cool
S0439	the decision be either to go to oz for a year
S0444	right
S0439	or to go for to oz for three months and then go to university
S0444	to do psychology
S0439	exactly to do psychology
S0444	how long will it take full time a year
S0439	a year to do the psychology conversion and then a year to do the next master
S0444	i like the idea of three months just not because it mean that you're here for longer but it's just that kind of thing where it give you enough of a break from work
S0439	exactly it mean i can
S0444	to then start
S0439	get yeah start again exactly
S0444	and then if you want to go back to australia afterwards you'd have a trade in which to go back
S0439	exactly
S0444	and get work visa
S0439	that's what i think
S0444	i'm really excite you're definitely gonna go though like
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0444	it's really excite
S0439	i'm gonna yeah and i have like june as like an end date in my head
S0444	yeah well so i'll move to and you'll have go for like where where be you think about for the uni from like your research last year that you do
S0439	erm probably still
S0444	maybe it will be your student discount
S0439	mm
S0444	instead of be me
S0439	it'll go into i think but be more expensive
S0444	oh be it by a lot be it
S0439	no not in the grand scheme of things it's erm it's about a grand more expensive
S0444	right
S0439	so not in the end in the grand scheme of things it's not a lot more but
S0444	but it
S0439	still a grand yeah
S0444	would you wanna move there and be
S0439	no i think if i go to or i'd commute on the days i have to
S0444	this be where my geography doesn't come into er
S0439	so where my parent live it's about by train it's about like an hour and a hour from and it's about an hour from drive
S0444	okay
S0439	so it's not actually that bad like i could commute it especially if i be only on campus two days a week
S0444	yeah
S0439	and the only issue be now my mother's be make redundant yeah from the school
S0444	just like
S0439	erm the school she work at get overtake by an academy and so therefore money be important and therefore they have literally make i think about twenty people redundant mostly admin staff erm er so i don't know where they're what they're gonna be do anymore like mum like dad still he have he have his
S0444	yeah
S0439	job and he his job and his salary be good enough to support them
S0444	okay of them yeah
S0439	but mum can't just sit at home all day like dad'll go crazy so
S0444	that's the thing like how be your mum feel like
S0439	erm she i think she's actually okay with it i mean she's not
S0444	yeah
S0439	do too badly
S0444	i suppose if it's like i know it sound awful but if it's a group of people if it's
S0439	mm
S0444	gonna be make redundant it doesn't make it any easier but it do make you feel like it wasn't just you know
S0439	you yeah
S0444	cos i think the weird thing you know at where it be like individual people
S0439	yeah
S0444	but
S0439	how be everything with though
S0444	mm
S0439	so like
S0444	i think it's better than it be but from my department but there's be a restructure where editor and aren't editors and anymore they be content and learn specialists so they have the same job title yeah it's all a bite weird i don't i don't know much about it cos it only just get announce but basically they're kind of align everything
S0439	god
S0444	gonna be manage everyone everyone and etls be gonna become scrum master matter but we're not quite sure what they're do
S0439	yeah i saw that have become a scrum master on linkedin
S0444	so yeah so i don't know much about it cos obviously there's an effect at primary or secondary i felt really sorry cos obviously she'd work so hard to be an editor and now a load of specialists and she's like where what do that what do that even mean i don't know
S0439	so maybe she's still do the same editorial role basically
S0444	oh yeah they just don't call it that
S0439	they just call it something different yeah
S0444	exactly so it's kind of like well it's like product management which have some weight in other industries content and learn specialist
S0439	yeah
S0444	that in any industry apparently they spend a year and half try to figure out that but yeah so i think everybody everybody in those camp be kind of like you know they've just take that on board erm i think some of the reactions have be positive i know that
S0439	who oh sorry yeah
S0444	cos it's just be real they've just get all the pressure on them at the moment over this erm and there's a lot of tension between editors and it's be like well some of you aren't pull your weight cos you're not do more than the nine to five kind of thing it's like er
S0439	god
S0444	you know yeah but erm i think be in a really difficult position cos they be like argue about the schedule and leeway but we couldn't have leeway and so yeah but i help make the she didn't say it but she be like i help make those schedule i know why they're that way from a positive perspective i can see where the publishers be come from and it's like
S0439	yeah
S0444	but erm like market be better now that the restructure have actually be announce it's a bite
S0439	well the thing be they start restructure when i be there
S0444	when we be
S0439	like
S0444	and er it be basically it be on my birthday my first year right so we'd not even be there a year it be my birthday it be july that they first announce the restructure and it's only just be
S0439	yeah it feel like they've be restructure for years
S0444	yeah and i mean yeah okay transformation take time but i think there be i think just it's better in market than it be but it's quite dependent they've get quite a lot of more senior roles go at the moment but like and etcetera be all gonna go so it depend whether they hire internal or externally that's gonna be like
S0439	so and be both gonna go for the same job or
S0444	oh yeah everyone's go for the same job
S0439	shit that's a bite dangerous isn't it
S0444	but they've be do that all the time like
S0439	oh okay
S0444	so so i think it's fine but i think there will be some backlash if internal people don't get it like
S0439	yeah can imagine if like especially like people like who's be in the company for a long time if he didn't get the job that'd be really bad
S0444	yeah well obviously i mean like everybody's kind of like yeah same old same old it's new initiative after new initiative but better than it be in term of people like fight over
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know that be just a bite sorry for me it's just i feel a lot better do the job that i'm do
S0439	yeah
S0444	i love the job that i be do before with science in term of the people that i be work with
S0439	yeah
S0444	that be awesome the kind of work that we be be ask to do be just like
S0439	no
S0444	not good erm and with history i know more about it which be good and i have a bite more control over what i'm do and you know and they seem to really like the stuff that i'm do so far like within the first few weeks for the first week i'd be give like a brochure and it be like oh yeah it it it just need update so i've already er get all the copy together you just need to put it this be from somebody who be kind of just look after me for a little while i look at it and go no that's shite that be a load of shite rewrite it within the first like the head of like project management go to the science team go gosh i know you tell me that she be good but i didn't know she be quite this good
S0439	ah
S0444	you know and the science team be just like we hate this come back please we miss you
S0439	ah
S0444	like
S0439	ah
S0444	but you know i think that's the thing if i'd have a job where i be work with people i think i'd be alright like
S0439	so be you not work with people be you just
S0444	yeah i'm work with people but it's more like i know that that's er job that involve that or good ones
S0439	yeah
S0444	i don't mind do the odd task and whatever but you know it's engage with people that
S0439	yeah
S0444	i really like but it's kind of like well yeah what job let you do cos it be that standard thing where they're not gonna like oh like i've probably say to you before they're kind of like well you've get a choice to make you either you know you're bright you either go for a job that use your talents but it will make you poorly or you go for a less intellectually demand job which won't be as intellectually stimulate but it mean that you can be healthier
S0439	yeah
S0444	and it's i'm still kind of weigh up but it's difficult cos it's like if i have i dunno if my family be closer or if i be live with or if i be live with a really close friend that like you know saw er day in day out and have to deal with it and other people be really impact by it
S0439	yeah
S0444	as in any of the choices that i make i would choose to do a less demand job
S0439	yeah
S0444	because i don't want there to be an effect you know i don't want to be impact but at the moment when it's just not just me but when it's pretty much confine to me and
S0439	yeah
S0444	my lovely friend that support me but it's pretty much me who's impact then i'm always gonna be like oh i'll do the intellectual job cos that's what i wanna do
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0444	and it's like i'm not ready to make those kind of choices yet
S0439	no no
S0444	so i just need to like see what i can do and see what's possible not on full hours yet at all i'm on seven
S0439	what hours be you do
S0444	seven
S0439	seven
S0444	so i'm nearly there
S0439	oh so you're nearly back up
S0444	but i be find it quite hard now like before i go to i be like i need i need to go and take a break like
S0439	yeah
S0444	it's all about get the balance isn't it
S0439	oh yeah definitely
S0444	balance
S0439	you need a work life balance
S0444	and it's not even work anymore it's just like it's like oh i'm tire but it's just like it sound ridiculous haven't be allow to go to the gym since june
S0439	you haven't be able to go to the gym god
S0444	i've not be allow to go cos well if you're do exercise like that's a massive thing out of your day
S0439	yeah cos they're counter intuitive
S0444	on top of do work yeah
S0439	yeah
S0444	i'm just like i just like but i end up do so much walk in dublin like
S0439	yeah so things do work out for you
S0444	it's like it's like berlin and like and it's like berlin and it's kind of like we just end up walk
S0439	yeah
S0444	we didn't deliberately go out to do mass of walk we just do
S0439	same with barcelona we do just too much walk
S0444	yeah
S0439	we do so much walk in barcelona
S0444	do you i be gonna ask about the big barcelona episode but i be like so photos do you have them at home so we can go through them
S0444	or be it just the ones that you have on facebook cos
S0439	it's most of them be just the ones i have on facebook actually
S0444	they be lovely
S0439	it be you've yeah you go to barcelona didn't you
S0444	awesome it's such a cool place
S0439	very beautiful place do like it a lot erm yeah sorry carry on with what you be say
S0444	no that much but erm yeah so like go to the gym i'm like right i'm i just i just you know it's that kind of it's like you know to make someone feel better and it's all about that payoff and it's like
S0439	yeah you get endorphins
S0444	it's like we be say too it's like i be say to you like earlier but it be that the mind set a bite weird but it's like a lot of the stuff that they've be at the hospital be kind of like stuff that sap you of energy but also give you energy at the same time so it's like see a friend
S0439	yeah see friends sap your
S0444	can drain energy
S0439	yeah yeah
S0444	but see them be normal and be like happy and have a great time
S0439	yeah
S0444	it's give you an energy boost
S0439	yeah yeah
S0444	so it's that kind of and it's that kind of thing where i be like you know like you and okay like how be you feel like you know i don't know you what be you think i'm like no i i can do this
