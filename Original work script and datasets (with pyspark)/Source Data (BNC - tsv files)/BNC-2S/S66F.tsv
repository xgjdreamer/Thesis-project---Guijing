S0251	i think we need to get this car insurance sort out soon and need to get another quote
S0252	we do ah one thing that we need to do from ah change it to be erm put me as the main driver and increase the mileage up to erm nine thousand miles a year give that i will be do a erm daily commute during most of the year
S0251	yes yes that's go to be significantly more than it's be do in the past
S0252	yes it will a little bite of a shock
S0251	it will the car won't know what's happen
S0252	yes
S0251	so we'll have to try and give them a ring tomorrow
S0252	yes
S0251	and let them know that circumstances be go to change so
S0251	i expect it's go to be quite a bite dearer this time
S0252	well technically it will be the same price as last year but erm because we start erm at erm without not the full twelve months
S0251	mm yes
S0252	but this time you full amount
S0251	for the full year yes yes and a few extra miles won't it
S0252	yes so technically you be get a bite more for your money this time
S0251	yes yes
S0252	but obviously it's not as good as a a decrease in the price
S0251	no it isn't how be you find drive the polo
S0252	it be a little bite different from what i be erm originally use to
S0251	yes
S0252	a learner car erm i think i've get use to it it do require a different style of drive
S0251	yes
S0252	i think you've get to remember you don't have as much power under your foot
S0251	no
S0252	and the steer be doesn't produce as much feedback and a little bite lighter
S0251	yes
S0252	the gear be approximately the same
S0251	yes
S0252	although the if you be drive the a three erm you'd probably find that the eh gear stick be a little stiffer
S0251	oh right be it yes
S0252	it's they think it's more feedback but
S0251	i see
S0252	i think some ways design cars for it to feel good to the driver as well as a a practical point of view
S0251	mm yes yes do you think that you're more likely to buy the car that you learn to drive in in the future
S0252	certainly that be similar
S0251	yes
S0252	ah i i be a a very good car really
S0251	mm
S0252	i think it be build to have very high standards
S0251	yes
S0252	and erm nice easy erm pleasurable to drive
S0251	yes
S0252	very sharp brake
S0251	mm
S0252	erm quite a lot feedback on the steer and the gearbox
S0251	yes
S0252	i like the automatic handbrake
S0251	yes
S0252	i like that you don't have to take it off when you start erm the car
S0251	mm i think i might find that a bite difficult to get use to actually
S0252	well you'd if once you get use to it
S0251	yes
S0252	you would certainly miss it
S0251	yes
S0252	because for things like hill start and when you're stop at the traffic light
S0251	yes
S0252	it definitely do make it a lot easier that you can just focus on put it in gear one rather than have to release the handbrake from that type of thing
S0251	yes the handbrake yes
S0252	and also you know it's on it's either on or off you can't have partially have it on and then it roll down a hill or something
S0251	yes no no no i think once you've get use to use a handbrake that it come pretty automatically when you're drive you just do it without too much think really
S0252	yes i think you find that i put the handbrake on a bite too stiff
S0251	yes i can't pull it can't release it when you put it on
S0251	do you think more cars will have automatic handbrakes in the future
S0252	yes it be definitely something that be come into you notice that with the erm golf hire car
S0251	be that the way it's go do that have it too
S0252	yes
S0251	yes be it something that audi have pioneer
S0252	i think vauxhall have it before audi but i think each car company design its own slightly different variation
S0251	do they really yes
S0252	for example whilst audi and vw be in the same group
S0251	mm
S0252	the vw erm automatic handbrake work differently to that of the audi
S0251	oh i see
S0252	and that can be say a bite about different car manufacturers
S0251	yes
S0252	so all work slightly differently
S0251	mm
S0252	which be not such a good thing because the handbrake in a normal car it be really universal
S0251	yes it be
S0252	but obviously if you're fit these automatic button handbrakes that slightly different
S0251	yes yes
S0252	it's not go to help it when people have to borrow a car or hire a car or change a car
S0251	yes yes that's right yeah that's true anyway we're go to have to have a little erm practice drive i think that the about the time that you would normally be leave
S0252	yes
S0251	so that we get an idea of how long it's go to take you to get there
S0252	yes
S0251	bear in mind that it could be very heavy traffic condition
S0252	yes
S0251	which will probably take more time than we imagine
S0252	i think if the traffic be generally bad
S0251	mm
S0252	i don't know how many trials we're go to do
S0251	no
S0252	it might be worth consider the back route
S0251	yes
S0252	definitely when the weather be reasonable
S0251	in good weather that'll probably be quicker
S0252	yes
S0251	if it's icy though you'll have to stick to the main road i think
S0252	yes
S0251	cos that will be sure to be grit i think
S0252	yes the that back road be unlikely to be
S0251	no
S0252	well grit
S0251	it would be too dicey wouldn't it in this weather
S0252	be alright if you've get a four by four but
S0251	mm but we haven't
S0252	mm
S0251	yeah and then there's the question of whether it's better to get the park permit or to park at the park and ride and get the shuttle bus for the last little bite
S0252	yes yes there's for and against with both really i think one good thing about the park and ride be there should be an abundance of space
S0251	mm yes
S0252	whereas i doubt that'll be guarantee in the site park
S0251	no that's it might get the park permit get there and then find that all the space have go and then you've get to go park it somewhere else anyway which might make you late
S0252	i know i know yes another thing about the er park and ride be there's usually so many space that it's really easy to get into them
S0251	mm yes yeah
S0252	whereas er if there's only one space leave at the university and the person's park slightly over or something that's go to be a bite hard to get in
S0251	yes i know sometimes it can be a bite tight that might be why it's leave because it's a slightly narrower one
S0252	yeah whilst i think the polo be capable of get in narrower space it do make it more challenge to reverse it in and that sort of thing
S0251	yeah we don't want to put it to the test it sure do yeah mm if you could buy any car which car do you think you would like to choose er which would you like the best
S0252	if it be any car
S0251	mm
S0252	erm i i think it would be a a high spec a three saloon
S0251	yes
S0252	yes i think the saloon do provide a bite more space than the the a three hatchback
S0251	yeah
S0252	but erm i think the saloons will be generally more expensive to buy
S0251	mm
S0252	which i'm not really look for any additional expenditure
S0251	mm be the headroom quite good because with you be quite tall you need quite a deep cabin to fit in comfortably don't you
S0252	it be reasonable
S0251	yeah
S0252	the a three saloon might be more a bite more generous than the hatchback
S0251	yeah
S0252	yes but also i think erm a car that be smaller you'd struggle to have a fourth person in because the person behind the driver wouldn't have much legroom if i be use it
S0251	yes that's right because you have your seat push as far back as it can
S0252	yes
S0251	to get yourself in don't you
S0252	because i can't reach the pedal with comfort if i'm not sit right
S0251	no that's right you've get long legs
S0252	my knees be hit the
S0251	steer wheel
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah
S0252	one disadvantage of that be that if you be to just conceal the it doesn't mean you have to really bend forward a bite
S0251	lean forward yes you can see any traffic come
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah
S0252	but it's amaze what opportunities we're get i mean some cars do erm side by side park space automatically
S0251	really
S0252	they take control of the steer wheel and do it themselves
S0251	that would be fantastic because that's one of the difficult manoeuvre isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	yes and erm some of them have get erm cameras at the back and the front to help you
S0251	yes that would be good as well
S0252	that come up on the erm it's off the entertainment system
S0251	oh i see yes
S0252	of course most medium to high spec cars now come equip with satnavs
S0251	yes already build in
S0252	yes
S0251	yes that's good isn't it
S0252	erm most have telephone integrate as well
S0251	do they
S0252	yes
S0251	like a mobile
S0252	yes
S0251	sort of
S0252	so you don't have to install the hand free equipment
S0251	no oh right amaze isn't it
S0252	yes what's erm do you think we should try and erm get a a further potentially a further discount by try to compete insurance company with one another or do you think that we're go to struggle to achieve that consider that there's not that much difference between our current insurer and the cheapest
S0251	erm no have you check on the comparison websites
S0252	yes the i think erm there's not go to be very much difference
S0251	no so you think we've more or less find the best deal that we can for the circumstances
S0252	yes but also i think it's with a good insurer as well it's it's get quite good erm which recommend provider status well it's just lose it but it be very close
S0251	yes review yes right yes
S0252	yes so it's sort of in the top four or five insurers
S0251	yes about yeah that's reassure isn't it
S0252	it be and also it's get the yougov survey most erm assure
S0251	yeah reliable yeah why be it that some of the insurance company be not on the comparison websites then and you've get to look up those separately
S0252	well they're try their best not to have to lower their premiums as a result of erm comparison websites or they'll claim they're the cheapest so people will just think oh there's no point look at comparison sit i'll just get a quote from there
S0251	oh i see the competition yeah mm i see
S0252	but generally some of them have be relatively competitive but not as good as the one
S0251	yes no
S0252	so have a union discount also help
S0251	mm yeah it also make it harder work for erm somebody who's look for insurance that you've get to go on several different comparison websites and then these two or three other providers that you have to look up separately as well
S0252	it do yes
S0251	so it make it a bite more long wind
S0252	well to be honest the ah don't seem to on comparison sit either
S0251	oh be they not on there
S0252	i think they be but i think i do suspect sometimes with comparison sit be one way that they make their money be to try and erm sort of do it by a rank of which insurer have pay them the most to try and sort of broker a bargain like that
S0251	yes really bite convolute isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0252	but i think with the best providers or the ones that be top on the which list i think if you get a quote from them it just give you a different idea of what it cost to get some reasonable cover because i don't think you would want to go for one that be quite far down the list with maybe only forty percent quality score and customer service i just want somewhere that's nearer seventy eightyish what the best ones be
S0251	mm yes no no satisfy yeah mm and it probably be best to pay it all in one lump be it rather than do these
S0252	yes well they treat it more like a mortgage agreement rather than a erm like a if you know what i mean
S0251	mm
S0252	i think from your point of view you're see as a pay as you go pay one month then pay the next month but they seem to think it's a way to make another twenty percent eh margin by sort of dress it up as a loan
S0251	yes yes oh right so you've get to pay for the of pay monthly yeah so we'll just do it all in one go and get it over with
S0252	yes mm yes some do offer it without additional charge but i don't think that be one of them
S0251	yes that be one of them no
S0252	eh i think that we should really just focus on get the best price within the year i don't think it's worth pay extra just for the privilege of pay each month
S0251	yeah yeah no yes mm and something that's go to be different this time i mean i think when i get the tax renewal which happen near christmas
S0252	yes
S0251	it's eh not go to have a tax disc any more be it
S0252	i know i know
S0251	i'm surprise that's happen
S0252	it be it be it's it sort of mark the end of an era really
S0251	it do yeah they'll be collector's piece now
S0252	yes
S0251	those tax discs
S0252	i've get some in my old toy post office
S0251	i know i use to give you them to play with in your post office so it be a good way though police for instance tell immediately whether or not your tax disc be in date
S0252	yes
S0251	but now presumably they'll have to look something up won't they on their database
S0252	mm well maybe with a like a scanner or something
S0251	yes
S0252	you know like just tap the registration plate and have say that i have notice that on some of the roads we've be on there have be dvla vans with cameras
S0251	right
S0252	erm obviously they must be check for whether people have pay their tax or not so if they're use a camera i imagine they be use a database rather than the disc
S0251	yes
S0252	but i think in term of something like an accident or erm what if erm a policeman's walk round on his duties it'll be easier to detect whether it's in date and whether it's be pay or not
S0251	mm well the last time i buy the tax disc at the post office i take my insurance and mot certificate but the girl didn't look at them because once she'd put in my car registration number she could already tell whether the insurance be pay and up to date and whether the mot be
S0252	yes
S0251	so that's already a step towards do that
S0252	it be yes but also you can buy it online as well
S0251	yes
S0252	so that would be erm use that same technology
S0251	yes
S0252	i don't know whether they expect people buy tax discs online new digital ones or whether you can still buy them at the post office or what the arrangement be exactly
S0251	yes yeah i don't know we'll have to see when we get the renewal won't we that's exactly what's go to happen
S0252	erm i don't know whether erm it will have its downsides i think it will possibly could be a little bite more bureaucratic in some ways because i don't think you know have these massive databases be perhaps not as simple as issue the discs
S0251	mm
S0252	what do you think
S0251	i have to say there's usually a downside isn't there
S0252	yes or do you think people might think that they can get away with pay because there isn't any physical evidence of whether they've get it or not
S0251	i think that would be a bite dangerous really
S0251	yes
S0252	do you how much more time do you think i will need before i get a car of my own do you think it will probably be at the next renewal or
S0251	i don't know it's just find the right car that you're interest in isn't it
S0252	yes and crucially at the right price
S0251	at the right price definitely yeah will have to be quite a good value model car won't it
S0252	yes i be personally hop to get a an a three hatchback
S0251	i know
S0252	erm but the new model only come out two years ago
S0251	yes
S0252	so sort of this time next year we should start to see some reasonable ones on the second hand market
S0251	yes that people have have for a couple of years and be then go to buy another new one
S0252	yes yes but ah i think i would prefer to get the new model because i think it will age less
S0251	yes
S0252	because obviously the new model should be on the go for another well the old model be on the go for in excess of ten years
S0251	oh right
S0252	hopefully the new model will be so therefore it make the car look newer which be they're still be produce
S0251	yeah yeah
S0252	but ah in some ways that be what you do with the polo because erm
S0251	mm
S0252	you be one of their first new generation polo owners
S0251	oh i be i be a real trailblazer
S0252	indeed
S0251	yeah i've like it i've enjoy drive it
S0252	yes still have make some use of it
S0252	and erm i'll be bump up the mileage significantly
S0251	not literally i hope
S0251	yeah i'm sure you'll be a very safe driver
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah
S0252	i personally find drive on a roads a bite easier than b roads
S0251	mm yes
S0252	there's a i think one thing about b roads be you do worry about enough space for a big lorry to come and pass
S0251	yeah so tractors and things
S0252	yes but obviously you don't need to worry about that quite as much on an a road because the dual carriageway
S0251	yes it's more spacious isn't it
S0252	yes obviously they be quite expensive to install and erm maintain if you a dual carriageway
S0251	yeah that's right
