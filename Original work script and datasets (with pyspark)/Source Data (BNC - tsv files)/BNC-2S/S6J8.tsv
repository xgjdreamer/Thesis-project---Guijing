S0508	it on okay well i be bear in england in a little country market town call in in nineteen thirty seven and i be very lucky because i be extremely love and care for for the first eighteen months of my life and i think that make a big difference to me because my sister be less lucky and be bear in february in nineteen thirty nine and our dad be in the ta and he be call up very very quickly in fact before the outbreak of war because it be clear that war be probably come and so we have to learn really to live without our dad do you want to check it
S0486	ah it's okay it's okay
S0508	no it's okay well erm i be look after brilliantly by mother for the first three years as far as i be concern it be lovely have mum all to myself but it wasn't of course so easy for her try to manage two very young children by herself my dad be in the yeomanry er the and yeomanry and incredibly in nineteen thirty nine he go to war with a horse isn't that extraordinary
S0486	really
S0508	yes it be a horse call be and
S0486	gosh
S0508	off they go with erm er to the middle east with horse and of course the poor horse be totally hopeless against tank and what very rapidly happen be that the horse it be recognise that the horse be not useful and a great many of them have to be put down and a lot of them erm actually never get there because horse apparently can't be sick and the weather be terrible and so the horse that get seasick die
S0486	oh
S0508	so they have really horrible experience but back in in mum make friends with the other mother of erm little children who be bank wive my father work in lloyds bank in peace time and er it just so happen that my aunt who wasn't really an aunt who live down the road erm be marry to a bank man also in lloyds and he turn out to be absolutely incapable of cop with military life he be actually in the air rorce but he couldn't hack it and have a nervous breakdown and erm it be terribly disgraceful and there be much whisper go on in corner between aunt and mother erm but it be recognise that eventually that he he wasn't skive he just couldn't cope and he go back to the bank so that be really lucky for me because i'd get a father substitute so there again he he select me i be a very fanciful imaginative child so i get a a surrogate dad but hadn't be younger and a different child and she be tremendously devote to mother and mother make it a lot of fun for us she wasn't actually feel a great sense of of fun erm but she know how to make life fun for us and of course there be ration but mother be very good at get rabbit she use to get rabbit from go rabbit with the marquess of bath on the estate and he be he would have all sort of rabbit under the counter of his fish shop and mother be one of his favourites mother have the most wonderful red hair she be absolutely gorgeous and she be very good at get the rabbit
S0508	and she use them for dual purpose because she be very keen on the red cross she'd join the red cross and aunt look after us aunt didn't have any children and she look after us on the days that mother go to the red cross and when mother have to practise dissection she practise on the rabbit because of course they come in their skin
S0486	mm mm
S0508	and so mother would skin them and investigate their innards and learn all about rabbit interiors even if she wasn't too sure about human interiors and she love the red cross and she use to take us for walk every day and she know where the periwinkles grow and she know er we would go to er the erm place call woodlands which be on the estate where there be marvellous bluebells and she know that if we climb up on to the railway embankment we could get white violets there be er mauve violets wood violets in the woods ah woodlands but for white violets we need to go up on to the railway embankment which be not allow but mother be very good at decide that we could disobey the rule if we be with her and she also take us to get snowdrops in at which be another big country estate i guess you could get access to these place more easily probably in wartime and she know about spindleberries and she know where there be a spindleberry tree so she be just a lot of fun really even though there weren't many toy about and from the post office she would buy a colour book and we have one i remember with bird in and we could choose a picture every day and colour it and choose be big business very special occasion but when we have nearly finish the book she would say well now you can do you can do all of them that's alright you can just you can do one and then you can do another if you want to and then there be a moment of very great excitement and then suddenly it wasn't excite at all it be very bore because it be we could we could have anyone so we didn't want any of them we be tire of colour and it be all spoil and she teach us how to make raffia mat and she teach us how to make woollen ball and she make our clothe and that be terribly tiresome we didn't have many clothe but erm i have an aunt who knit this be a real aunt my mother's younger sister and she knit fair isle sweaters and we have kilts to go with those and they be just beautiful so we be very impress with those but the make of the kilts be tiresome because you have to stand up on a little tuffy and have pin stick into you and that be very tiresome and she would make dress for us and again have a harder time than i do because we be dress alike but she use to say that do the first one be more fun and she always do the first one for me and then get the second one and by the time she do the second one she be bite less she be a bite tire of it so get the short straw again and dad send things dad send first of all ribbon er blue ribbon for me and a pink ribbon for and this come from i don't know where but the ribbon arrive and couldn't remember him i could remember him erm but i didn't know what you do with the ribbon and mother have an idea and she give us erm piece of bamboo and we tie the ribbon on well i suppose she tie the ribbon on cos i don't think we would've be able to do bow but she tie the ribbon in a bow and then they be wands so we could wave them we could do all sort of magic that be wonderful and then dad send little filigree silver brooch they be butterfly and a big butterfly ours be quite little and a big butterfly for mother and then most wonderful of all he send a beautiful blouse for mother which be erm a sort of erm natural colour with cream erm no it be green embroidery mother with her beautiful erm red hair and green eye look marvellous in green and she have a black suit and she would wear this lovely blouse erm with the green embroidery round the neck erm with her black suit and there be party dress for and for me and i felt very sorry for because 's be er red embroidery on er white silk and mine be on a sort of cheesecloth which be a natural colour and it be marvellous rainbow colour the embroidery i think mine be to die for i felt so beautiful but when i look back on it i think probably 's be a great deal more subtle and more attractive so we have our party dress and we would put our butterfly on our dress and we felt the bee's knees and we even even in wartime go very occasionally to birthday party but of course not very often and erm we we have a little trip to i suppose mum want to send photograph of us to dad and we have polyphotos take and polyphotos be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little square photograph and erm and then you select from all these mass and mass and mass and one be blow up and frame and be the special one the choose one so erm i don't know exactly what be send but we i remember go to have these polyphotos take in all our finery and er feel very very grand but then in nineteen forty three on about february the eighth when be just three there be a fire and of course you know all about that
S0486	yes
S0508	erm mother erm be it be the early morning we be in mother's bedroom and she have a gas fire against the wall and she put the fire on she get a dress gown on and erm it i don't know how it happen but the dress gown catch fire
S0486	ah
S0508	and er and i be in mother's bed and i i just have a blur memory of it i can't remember it clearly but there be flame and flame and and it be all horrible and mother wrap herself up in something which be it seem as it she be shut the flame on herself but it be just the right
S0486	mm
S0508	thing do actually and she know because of the red cross she'd learn erm first aid and basic er erm response to flood and water and and er fire and erm she know that that be what you have to do and she do it so i can't remember what happen next really erm i know mother always bang on the wall cos we didn't have a telephone but she could get help from erm mrs what be she call ah mrs mrs next door mrs be erm a queen bee of the wrvs or something she be a very important person anyway in the local hierarchy and mrs be a great friend to mother and she turn up and i'm sure sort out get the doctor and the ambulance and all the rest of it so mother go to hospital and er we have fall out of paradise and i can remember all this activity and stand at the bottom of the stairs say we haven't have our porridge and the grow up be very cross because i'd say that and i didn't understand why i have no idea really what have happen and i stay at home granny and grandpa arrive and granny have have they have have ten children and be completely incapable of cop with us they be just not up to it to small children and erm i have just start school erm or i be just about to start school i can't remember but that be very very fortunate oh yes mother remember that she be make my buttercup colour school blouses at i suppose ready for the next term erm when this accident happen and er first of all they think she'd die she have third degree burn and then they keep her alive somehow or other and that be really really really lucky because they have just discover erm really i think they be only be do for service men but they'd just discover how to do
S0486	mm
S0508	erm graft and erm my father couldn't get home
S0486	oh
S0508	because be rather a lot go on in the war and i don't think you could just erm come home because you felt it would be a good idea erm in in early nineteen forty three but he do get home before the end of the war and when he get home he do get mother to er to see erm
S0486	oh yes
S0508	so she be jolly lucky really and he have by this time train some other people to do what he be do and one of them be always know he be never ever i never discover what his christian name be he be mr and as far as mother be concern he be god
S0508	so god do when she eventually come to have her graft they be do by god
S0508	but erm they they be many and some be successful and some be not and redheads have very thin skin so she wasn't design for graft really anyway and erm it take a it be she have her last operation in the early nineteen fifties so it be a long long slow business but for and me it be pretty miserable have we do enough do you think
S0486	well let's have a look erm you you could i mean you you've do nineteen minutes at the moment do you want to go on for half an hour or not
S0508	erm
S0486	well i'll ask you some question shall i
S0508	okay
S0486	how about that because otherwise it's all a bite one erm so erm when she have her skin graft operations erm no what i want to ask you be be her face burn at all
S0508	no
S0486	oh thank goodness for that
S0508	no she

S0508	but it be probably something very flammable
S0486	right okay
S0508	i i just simply don't know
S0486	no no i know erm the erm er and also erm be they sort of really aware of erm hydration at that time you know because people suffer from hypovolemic shock because they lose so much fluid from their burn
S0508	mm
S0486	and that's the first thing that kill people off and they do she have do you do you remember see her with drip in her arm or drip hang off
S0508	i don't i don't think
S0486	or with clear fluid
S0508	she say people would come to her and
S0486	mm
S0508	say to her erm you must worry all the time about the children and she say er later i never think about the children
S0486	right
S0508	i be er i be in such horrendous pain
S0486	yeah pain yeah
S0508	i didn't think about
S0486	no
S0508	anything except
S0486	no
S0508	how long i could endure this and i just want to die
S0486	mm
S0508	and she say erm that there be er when she get first to erm the doctor who erm who do the graft that she be erm he be very shock and he say what on earth have be happen and she say they keep me alive she think the little cottage hospital
S0486	yes
S0508	in
S0486	right
S0508	be wonderful
S0486	right
S0508	because they have
S0486	yes
S0508	keep her go
S0486	yeah
S0508	and she also say that when she'd first come home she realise she couldn't cope with us
S0486	right
S0508	at all
S0486	yes
S0508	and that she have have come downstairs to put her head in the gas oven
S0486	oh
S0508	in the night and she have think about us
S0486	oh
S0508	she have see us asleep and she think i can't leave them so in a
S0486	right
S0508	way we do
S0486	keep her there
S0508	we do keep here there
S0486	yeah
S0508	but we get send to a ghastly board school i can't tell you how awful
S0486	yes i i be just go to ask you where do you go in all this
S0508	well erm we go to stay with an aunt who be not sympathetic to small children at all
S0486	oh dear
S0508	and er who get somebody in from the village to look after her but she while she be with the aunt erm she be just a little slip of a thing and the aunt have a fourteen year old son
S0486	oh dear
S0508	and he be mow the lawn one afternoon and be try to help him and he cut the index finger of her right hand off with the mow machine
S0486	oh
S0508	and of course in those days nobody ever think that it might be stitch back on again or anything like that it could possibly have be do but it certainly wasn't
S0486	no no
S0508	and so have no index finger on her right hand she's get a little stump
S0486	oh gosh and an index finger be so vital isn't it
S0508	i know yes
S0486	it's really vital
S0508	oh and and at the board school of course we both begin wet the bed immediately
S0486	yeah
S0508	it be run by a ghastly sadistic woman
S0486	oh no
S0508	who erm be would beat regularly for because she she be trouble as far as she be just desperately unhappy and
S0486	yes
S0508	and and she be such a little tiny tot erm i be there be there from six until eight but be there from four until six
S0486	oh
S0508	so that be
S0486	right yes yes
S0508	really really hard
S0486	it be hard
S0508	yes
S0486	goodness
S0508	and i think have have never entirely recover but i think i be very lucky because as far as i be concern life be so much better forever afterwards
S0486	yes yes
S0508	and i be just grateful
S0486	yeah
S0508	once we get once the war be over
S0486	yes
S0508	and we be together again
S0486	yeah exactly
S0508	my dad survive the war
S0486	yes
S0508	yes
S0486	good and erm and so you be away so you get back then your mother have recover sufficiently then to be
S0508	my mother be
S0486	with you
S0508	a goer my mother er be impossible really she be a marvellous mother and she have terrific look and flair and go
S0486	mm
S0508	and nothing stop her and she have three more children after the war
S0486	really
S0508	and er a miscarriage and then a legal abortion
S0486	right
S0508	because well a legal termination i suppose it would've be call
S0486	yes
S0508	erm but erm she she start another baby erm i should think it would be about nineteen fifty two and that would've be six of us and er the doctor say you can't do this erm and mother say well i'm go to and er she report later on that he say well i think it's better to have five children with a mother than six children without
S0486	yes
S0508	and
S0486	exactly
S0508	that persuade her
S0486	yes
S0508	so she do but she never quite get over it really she just she be a can do person
S0486	yes
S0508	to an absurd extent
S0486	exactly
S0508	yes
S0486	well the thing about have a near death experience be it make you for a while for a while must be five years it make you do things rather in a more erm erratic way than you would you're almost celebrate the fact that you're alive and i expect that's what she be do
S0508	yes
S0486	i think she might've do but she be always er i mean the other thing that i'd miss out
S0508	yes
S0486	be that she have a love affair in the war
S0508	oh do she
S0486	yes erm obviously it be before the burn
S0508	yes
S0486	erm and it be somebody who come back erm with on with the erm dunkirk
S0508	oh yes
S0486	mm
S0508	little boat and who be here until nineteen forty four
S0486	right
S0508	and er my father who be a very very sane sensible nice man erm she have marry really because she be a wild child and all her family think it would be that he be a very good man and
S0486	yes
S0508	he would calm her down and quieten her
S0486	oh yes mm mm
S0508	so she do it to keep everybody else quiet
S0486	mm
S0508	but it wasn't a great love affair and they certainly have trouble get together again after the war but i think because probably because of mother's big romance erm it she be able to to do it he be marry anyway the romance and have a child so they agree between them that they could not break up these all these situations and just out of selfishness so i think they would've decide that anyway but erm
S0486	the contrast between you have your er wonderful er early childhood and then everything change after your mother's accident erm be very stark isn't it
S0508	it be but i have i suppose i be hugely lucky because i have a bank of memories
S0486	yes
S0508	and 's bank wasn't nearly as full as mine
S0486	no
S0508	and i know that one of the ways i survive at board school be erm i would i would go off by myself and dig about in a little patch of pretend garden
S0486	mm
S0508	and i would remember my mother in particular attitudes and i would just i would have an idea of
S0486	mm
S0508	her and i could remember my dad
S0486	yes yes
S0508	but couldn't remember dad
S0486	no
S0508	and her er she felt this sort of huge need of mother but she didn't she wasn't old enough or sort of or the same sort of child so that she
S0486	no
S0508	couldn't do that
S0486	no no
S0508	and her again she oh dear it go on erm she have a gang that be her system she she she find a little gang and they be lead by a man what be his a boy what be his name oh i can't remember his name but erm he be a i can see his face he be a big boy that's right their surname be that's it and be i suppose about twelve he seem a very big boy to me
S0508	erm be the leader of the gang
S0486	right
S0508	and be the littlest person
S0486	right
S0508	and she be the and she adore him and he be kill on a bicycle
S0486	oh no
S0508	in the which fortunately be in the holiday not term time
S0486	right
S0508	erm i don't think we would've have bicycle at board school but erm she come back he's get a sister and be alright but be go and i think that matter a great deal to her
S0486	yes yes
S0508	i can remember that be very shock that somebody little could die
S0486	yes yes exactly
S0508	but i'm sure compare with what be go on in europe at the time it be all very small
S0486	yes well absolutely but
S0508	yes
S0486	she have she she didn't remember your father
S0508	no
S0486	your mother go suddenly be take away
S0508	well she be there and then she be not there
S0486	yeah and
S0508	mm
S0486	erm and then somebody who she attach herself
S0508	yes
S0486	onto really
S0508	yes
S0486	to feel like she be almost in the gang be
S0508	yes
S0486	part of a family group
S0508	yes
S0486	and then that be take away well she be so lucky to have you still
S0508	well she's she and i speak every day on the telephone
S0486	do you yeah
S0508	every morning and erm she certainly have be very important to me
S0486	yes
S0508	and she be er i would say a very interest individual rather eccentric but
S0486	yes
S0508	erm happy person
S0486	yes now
S0508	now but she's have a hard difficult life
S0486	yeah
S0508	a
S0486	yeah
S0508	really really difficult life
S0486	because a a difficult childhood can often result in pattern of behaviour
S0508	mm
S0486	and pattern of behaviour extend they're the learn pattern of behaviour whether they're as shakespeare would say some be bear great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them
S0508	mm
S0486	it's nobody's fault but these erm pattern of behaviour seem to permeate throughout life
S0508	oh they do
S0486	and
S0508	yes
S0486	erm you know and it all start with childhood always that's where it's learn
S0508	yes
S0486	well most of the learn be do in childhood isn't it

S0486	so erm so there you go erm right well we can end it there erm it's thirty two minutes ten second
S0508	well
S0486	be that alright
S0508	absolutely
S0486	yes
S0508	yes
S0486	okay
