S0426	talk of uruguay
S0427	yeah
S0426	you know i go the erm the gym
S0427	oh i use to be a member there i didn't know that you be a member no
S0426	yeah oh yes yes
S0427	oh right okay
S0426	and the other day i go in and i look at the pool you know you can see the pool in from the reception
S0427	yes yes
S0426	and you couldn't see the water
S0427	why not
S0426	cos huge guy in there i mean they be triangular these blokes
S0427	oh right
S0426	enormous blokes
S0427	right
S0426	and i come into the we be all take shower so i think what language be they speak
S0427	and
S0426	and i think this it's kind of latinish
S0427	mm mm mm
S0426	you know latin be they romanian but they come out and hear a bite more and they be speak er latin american spanish and i work out that they be two uruguayans and they be rugby people but the fact it turn out that they're not the main uruguayan rugby they're the under twenty ones
S0427	oh and they're over here tour as well be they
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	well well well
S0426	they must have a there must be a correspond
S0427	yes there could well be erm because uruguay's population be tiny it's like wales' you know it's only three million or something like that i mean the fact that they win the world cup at football twice
S0427	i mean i know it be before the war and everything but
S0426	yes but none the less
S0427	to win it twice and to have win it in brazil as well bet there're still elderly brazilians who remember that date
S0426	oh yes that's right the poor goalkeeper
S0427	mm
S0426	alright so the er the way group be and the way the point be award
S0427	mm still everything to play for
S0426	what would wales need to do to just need to beat australia
S0427	if we beat australia it doesn't matter what england do because we would've win every game but if australia beat england england can't qualify as as i remember rightly
S0426	be this
S0427	they only have one game leave they can't possibly get as many point then as wales
S0426	be it the case that wales have only get one game but england have get two game leave
S0427	yes england have get to play australia on saturday not not tomorrow no sorry it be tomorrow it be tomorrow and then they have to play another game i think that must be uruguay
S0426	uhu
S0427	i don't think they've play uruguay so it must be uruguay i think erm yeah
S0426	one two three four five
S0427	it's four game they have to play
S0426	so four game five
S0427	it's five in a group so who's in it wales australia england uruguay and fiji
S0426	fiji
S0427	okay well
S0426	i suppose there's no chance of get er ticket for either the australia game or the er semi final if they get through be it
S0427	quarter final
S0426	quarter final
S0427	would be after this erm no i don't even know where the erm wales wales australia be at twickenham that that'll be sell out i don't even know where the quarter final if if it if wales get to be be play
S0426	be it to be at the millennium do your debenture help you at all
S0427	no no this be run by an entirely different company erm if it be under the if wales be run the world cup and we be the host nation then i think
S0426	oh because we're not the host nation
S0427	then i think ticket would go to debenture ticket holders on a first on a first choice basis
S0426	right right right
S0427	but although perhaps unfairly wales have have two game in the millennium stadium when
S0426	even though they're not co host
S0427	no they're not co host er well
S0426	that be unfair then isn't it
S0427	well i totally i think i know what the answer be england want the world cup and they need to garner support
S0426	oh so okay so this'll both from
S0427	so i think this be do this this be do a deal well we'll vote for you to have the world cup
S0427	but obviously we'll want a few game play at the millennium
S0426	sure sure
S0427	now wales want to play australia at the millennium
S0426	right
S0427	but er the english organisers wouldn't have that
S0426	okay
S0427	in fact er gatland the welsh manager actually tease the english and say
S0426	ah right right
S0427	if you think you're so good why don't you come and play us at the millennium stadium
S0426	ah yeah right right
S0427	and they wouldn't it would have be naive to have go for that bait
S0426	yes quite yes that's
S0427	so no
S0426	it's a loss even though they play at twickenham
S0427	well yes but i wouldn't want to play that game again because i
S0426	it be pretty nip and tuck
S0427	yeah and erm i think there be a sense in which probably england lose it more so than wales win it
S0426	well certainly at the end when they do that but then you know
S0427	yeah i like i think it be a courageous thing to do and and he'd be a national hero if if it have come off
S0426	yeah yeah as well
S0427	i think i think the really big mistake be throw to the front of the line out which mean you're only five yards from the touchline the welsh forward just pile in and drive them over then and then it be a throw in to wales play out time game win you know but the this saturday tomorrow
S0426	mm mm
S0427	england can't afford to lose they're out i think if they lose tomorrow and i should be pray to a god
S0427	to a god i don't believe in
S0427	i shall be sing
S0426	well temporarily you might believe just for the sake of
S0427	sing sing in the praise of the australians yeah and erm i shall be you know get all the voodoo stuff all the
S0426	yes yes
S0427	anything anything that'll get
S0426	that's right
S0427	you know the er the right result
S0426	that's right
S0427	yes exactly
S0426	though watch it be of course er excite in in part but we've have this conversation before the stoppages and the impenetrability of the rule
S0427	ah i know i don't enjoy watch rugby as much as i do in the seventies mind you that that i be bias by that wonderful welsh team in the seventies
S0426	yes sure sure
S0427	but it it it's become a much more confrontational impact game
S0426	true
S0427	you find three quarter now a lot of the tactics be about how can you break attack
S0426	yes yes yes
S0427	and go through rather than how can you go around the man
S0426	yes that's right but
S0427	i can't remember the last time i saw a genuine sidestep
S0426	that's right yes well surely they happen but very occasionally
S0427	no yeah yeah but erm
S0426	i think but there be that issue about the lack of flow which be
S0427	yeah
S0426	game which flow be much more attractive the other thing i suppose be your my sense the activity look arbitrary
S0427	mm
S0426	it's only the scrum to somebody come fresh to a game they see people hunker down that way it look completely arbitrary
S0427	yeah
S0426	why that way of distribute the ball why seven men rather than two or eight or twelve
S0427	take eight men each in a scrum yeah yeah erm i don't know the history of that erm i mean in rugby league for instance it's not it's not eight men
S0426	sure
S0427	it's it's six and the scrum's just become a way of restart the game
S0426	it be it's a forward it's a forward
S0427	it's not even contest anymore the scrum in rugby league
S0426	that's right and that make the game flow
S0427	it do yeah
S0426	it doesn't look arbitrary it's a way of restart so
S0427	i mean uh and in some respect although i'm not a huge fan of rugby league whenever i watch it i i find the game more satisfy to watch in some respect
S0426	sure
S0427	i i don't have the emotional interest
S0426	no sure sure it's just a game but it
S0427	but as something to watch yes i quite enjoy i i think rugby have become far too technical
S0426	yes
S0427	there be far too many mistake sorry not mistake far too many technical infringements that be either a half penalty or full penalty
S0426	that's right
S0427	and game be be decide by referees' interpretations of the laws and goodness know what else you know
S0426	right that's right and interpretations which be divisible or intelligible to most people in the in in the audience
S0427	i mean there's one
S0426	not even visible there's
S0427	no
S0426	say something will happen in some very very close engagement which you can't see and only the people on the field can see so it's
S0427	i don't think referee don't understand half the time what be go on in the front row
S0427	and there's one rule there's one rule it's a full penalty i think if you don't bind properly right
S0426	yeah
S0427	if you don't bind properly so the the hooker be in the middle he have to bind properly on his prop and his prop have to bind properly on him and they can't do certain other things but then the more i think about it well if you're not bind properly then you can't be as effective push forward as a scrum unit so if you don't want to bind properly let them get on with it
S0426	that's true yeah
S0427	why why why issue a penalty for not bind properly
S0426	presumably a lot of other things in the scrum aren't just about technicalities but about safety
S0427	some of them be about safety which be why they don't allow them to clash anymore because often when they allow them to charge in they'd go down and you'd you'd you could get people with snap neck and things like
S0426	anyway
S0427	yeah they do but now they
S0426	frighten when you see them
S0427	i agree but now when they tend to go down that way but you know
S0426	well there be still a safety element to pivot
S0427	which be why you can't have contest scrums unless you've get specialist prop and hookers play they won't allow it if if for any reason you haven't get erm you've get an injury and you haven't get a specialist sub who's prop to come on to replace the injure prop the scrums must be uncontested
S0426	well who would decide that
S0427	well it's decide
S0426	if someone be qualify or unqualified
S0427	well it's it's know if someone be a prop yeah
S0426	okay yeah okay it's know
S0427	just like just like when you look at the bench in football you know that's the goalkeeper
S0426	oh right he or she's wear something
S0427	you know it it it it's clear who be a prop or not
S0426	well if it's a huge bloke
S0427	no no no no you must of play as a prop you know
S0426	okay
S0427	in your career you can't you can't suddenly be a big bloke who's press into service
S0426	okay right
S0427	not at not at the elite level rugby anyway
S0426	well again that's that's you know
S0427	but it's frustrate because you pay a lot of money to go and see it and the number of time a scrum be reset and then it's reset and then the referee'll say no that be an infringement that's people slip and then he'll move it five yards leave or right you know and you're think hang on that's two minutes of my play time that's go by there you know so i do find it immensely frustrate
S0426	true true
S0427	and and as yet they haven't find an answer to it
S0426	it might well be i don't know what it's like watch club rugby probably it's very unpopulated but if it wasn't for the nationalisms involve and the long history of glamour in some sense of the word
S0427	mm
S0426	then rugby wouldn't have the same prestige that it have now
S0427	no i think that's right i mean if you look at new zealand particularly new zealand and to an extent wales it be the national expression of their of their culture in some respect or part of their culture
S0426	yes sure sure sure
S0427	because particularly in new zealand it's the only game they really care about
S0426	that's right
S0427	in wales football be get stronger and stronger which you know which worry the rugby
S0426	true it's a secularise football
S0427	fraternity
S0426	it's a not a nationalistic even though they're happy when the national team do well cos it's very unusual
S0427	yeah
S0426	but it's it doesn't it's not so holy as the rugby be it's more
S0427	no but no it isn't it but the problem i think er be that young boys and girls they see the bale of this world
S0426	yes
S0427	they see swansea play against
S0426	sure sure
S0427	city and chelsea and all those and they grow up more likely to become good football players and not rugby players and
S0426	yes
S0427	we need we need youngsters come through into rugby and and the other thing too be that i don't know swansea perhaps get twenty five thousand watch a game down there on a saturday you you
S0426	yeah yeah yeah but against neath you
S0427	no no you'd get hundreds you know if you're lucky
S0426	of course in a sense something like rugby and wales be er immune to that and the idea of rugby in wales
S0427	mm
S0426	the nature the symbolic element of rugby in wales
S0427	yeah
S0426	it it would still survive as this symbolic thing whether anybody play it or not more or less just like hurl i suppose
S0427	yes it it would survive for quite some time but we might become you know distinctly second or third class at it erm and eventually then it would it would it would go under because you wouldn't be able to
S0426	yes
S0427	and we've only get four professional club as it be
S0426	that's true
S0427	and our best players would end up have to play abroad and even if abroad be in england you know erm
S0426	mm
S0427	there's a big difference between have your best players play in wales and have them as kind of a diaspora which be what the south sea islanders have find
S0426	well you know that's right that's right
S0427	they can't keep their very best players in
S0426	of course they can't
S0427	cos they're they're too poor you know
S0426	but some cultural icons don't it's help if there's quote success for them
S0427	yes yes
S0426	but it doesn't sum up well maybe rugby be not the same but say something like the gaelic language for example you don't need to have that many people speak it for it to be
S0427	no
S0426	still be culturally important
S0427	it can be culturally important but er you take gaelic for instance and it's virtually dead
S0426	it's dead
S0427	it's virtually dead
S0426	it's an academic language
S0427	whereas i think i think more preferable would be for it to be this symbolic cultural icon and be a live entity
S0426	yeah that's right that's right
S0427	if you see what i mean and wales can't rest on its
S0426	laurels
S0427	rugby laurels really
S0426	no no okay
S0427	erm it need to keep attract young people into the game as as with the case for any sport of course
S0426	but didn't it survive in the sense of popularity and prestige quite a long time in well the last ten years of pretty dismal international
S0427	well as soon as it go professional which be what the late in the nineties wasn't it i think we have a very torrid time you know we be lose more match in a season than we be win erm and we there be some pretty heavy defeat i mean there be a tour to south africa where i think south africa beat us ninety nine point to nil or something like that
S0426	what
S0427	and it take a while wales be slow to come to grip with professionalism and during that time it virtually destroy a very healthy club system
S0426	right right
S0427	and what come in place there use to be five regional team now and then there be four and there be all the squabble and there be the rename and all the rest of it and i don't think the welsh rugby union be particularly well lead and there's the usual tribal conflict in wales and place like france and england just march ahead if us scotland struggle enormously too
S0426	well france and england would've have more capital more investors will to capitalise
S0427	it's more sponsorship er and there's just more money so you can pay the better then you can pay well
S0426	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0427	yeah
S0426	but in spite of that dip
S0427	they come out i mean in in start in two thousand and five they do the grand slam they hadn't do it for a long time
S0426	mm mm
S0427	and they've they've win the championship and have more grand slam since then so the last ten years have in some respect be you know the best ten years they've have since the seventies you might not call it well i don't know they might become know as another golden period i mean
S0427	who know but it they have be very successful and of course erm four years ago they come within an ace of get in the final of the world cup
S0426	mm mm mm mm
S0427	you know erm and but
S0426	but those things matter for keep keep the flame burn as it be it would burn
S0427	yes yeah
S0426	anyway but it'll flare up if the the team be successful on the pitch
S0427	people be immensely proud of what wales do in the last world cup you know it be it be play in the southern hemisphere it's tough to go there anyway and we come within a whisker of get to the final i don't think we would've beat new zealand but you know we we come within a whisker of get there
S0426	mm
S0427	and people be enormously proud of that erm and they want they want wales to get out of this group you know
S0426	yeah that'll be that's right that's right
S0427	go out at the group side yeah yeah that's right and if if we win it
S0426	well the
S0427	if we no if we win the group
S0426	oh the group oh
S0427	no if we win the group
S0426	then you're guarantee a less bad opponent than otherwise
S0427	yeah more likely people that we can beat
S0426	right
S0427	you know the
S0426	right
S0427	the the scotlands or the not that they'll be easy but the scotlands or the france or the irelands and we don't have to play
S0426	yeah new zealand that's right
S0427	new zealand in the quarter finals someone like that you know
S0426	be it not already decide who
S0427	it be decide it's it's like er the winner of group a play the runner up in some other group but i i don't know i'd have to look it up in the paper yeah
S0426	yes so it's
S0427	but that be all because i do know that if england win the group i'd go so far as to say they're virtually guarantee a place in the final
S0426	give that they that the comparative property
S0427	they'll play at twickenham and you know they will they they'll look at a team like france or ireland or scotland whoever it be and think we can beat you you know
S0426	that's right that's right that's right that's right
S0427	yeah
S0426	although who know you know erm
S0427	well it would be wonderful for the non
S0427	for the non english among us so to speak who who who never fail to enjoy the hubris and the schadenfreude
S0426	this be a
S0427	of an english defeat
S0426	almost equally as important as pleasure in your own team win isn't it
S0427	almost i shall be a very very happy man tomorrow if if australia beat england i should be exceptionally happy
S0426	that's a good index of what these things mean isn't it that another team you take
S0427	yes
S0426	as much pleasure in almost
S0427	yeah and yet when it come to world cup football and england be play i don't know italy
S0426	mm
S0427	i i really don't care very much you know
S0426	exactly that's right yeah
S0427	if anything if anything my idea of heaven be brazil play like gods and win it
S0426	that's right
S0427	but that be shoot to piece in the last world cup
S0426	yes yes quite
S0427	i mean brazil can't even play the beautiful game any longer
S0426	yes
S0427	you know what what be the world come to
S0426	they can barely play the game by by all account
S0427	and today's paper say that wales be eighth in the world in football which i find stagger and brazil be seventh now brazil seventh and wales eight or eight or nine whatever it be
S0426	yes yes
S0427	no no no no there's something wrong there
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	that can't be right
S0426	yes on the basis on the coefficients they use
S0427	well yes but i think that's just you know lie statistics and all the rest of it
S0426	well alright okay and it be manage by fifa and you might want to say well okay that will tell you
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	what it all mean
S0427	yes indeed
S0426	well good a good bite of footy watch and rugby watch over the weekend
S0427	yeah there's more european qualify stuff come up isn't there for the football
S0426	oh that's pretty dire though isn't it
S0427	well i don't i don't know wales i know need one point to be sure of qualify and
S0426	oh right oh that's good
S0427	yeah that will be first tournament they've qualify for since nineteen fifty eight
S0426	fantastic
S0427	well it's fantastic for the football fan but from a rugby point of view
S0426	well alright okay
S0427	you know yeah
S0426	it have this negative possibility of take over
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	who have they beat in their group or who have they meet in their group
S0427	well i don't know they're play the like of montenegro aren't they
S0426	okay right
S0427	but but i think they beat belgium and something like that
S0426	wow
S0427	who or draw with them or beat them at home they've get some good result amongst it you know
S0426	right but this be one of the first or the first time that the european championships
S0427	yeah it's be expand hasn't it yeah
S0426	it's be expand to mm thirty six rather than thirty four or something like that
S0427	i've i've no idea but it's but that's why you get things like germany versus erm monaco or germany versus san marino or something like that i mean it's
S0426	i think there there's always be those things but there be more of them now
S0427	there be more of them now cos you get the faroe islands and gibraltar and all the rest of it as well
S0426	the the faroe islands
S0427	oh be they be they a world cup
S0426	they're surprisingly okay
S0427	oh yes they're eleventh in the world cup rank aren't they
S0427	yes
S0426	well you may laugh but they beat the netherlands can you believe it
S0427	i do find that difficult to believe
S0426	they do
S0427	er erm this be
S0426	i mean they're the new middle class comparatively
S0427	oh
S0426	but the the seriously not middle class be the uzbekistans of this world
S0427	ah
S0426	they're in there as well so i mean
S0427	oh goodness me i i
S0426	it's extraordinary
S0427	i can't keep pace with it really but there we be
S0426	that's right
S0427	have a good weekend
S0426	same to you
S0427	and erm
S0426	oh before we go
S0427	yeah
S0426	er well i'll turn this off because
S0427	right
S0426	i be go to say
S0427	we must have about get on for half a dozen record
