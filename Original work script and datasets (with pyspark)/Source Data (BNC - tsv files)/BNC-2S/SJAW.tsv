S0264	i can't i don't know what there's no spare i'm gonna sleep in in the study when they come be it thursday
S0265	you can have your own bed they they there be only two of them come they'll sleep in my bed
S0264	they don't want to share a bed surely
S0265	they're use to it
S0264	well i'm use to sleep on the floor i in fact i'd almost prefer it because my separate out of the way
S0265	you're not you don't need to do anything they can have my bed it's only one night and when they come back it's one night
S0264	yeah but what if they don't sleep the night before travel that wouldn't be a good idea would it how come there's only one piece of carrot
S0265	because there wasn't any carrot this be this be what be erm leave over from yesterday
S0264	oh what time's the flight
S0265	two forty five
S0264	mm have you get the rail ticket
S0265	not yet there're gonna they'll get their ticket to gatwick when they arrive here erm
S0264	why
S0265	cos they've get pass i suppose they could they could buy them from any railway station couldn't they
S0264	but what's the advantage of oh yeah the theoretical yes
S0265	oh erm when i come up on tuesday do i should i get a travel card how how many tube journey be we go to be make
S0264	three
S0265	oh it's worth get one then
S0264	cos he'll cos you won't want to walk to piccadilly you won't have time
S0265	no
S0264	and then there'll be piccadilly to south kensington and then back from south kensington to victoria
S0265	yeah i think so
S0264	well do you know where this restaurant be
S0265	yes i've look on erm the map
S0264	where
S0265	be it something like that it's just off erm piccadilly isn't it
S0264	yes it be but it's confuse and erm isn't it erm near
S0264	well i think it be anyway it's confuse because it's not a big street it's probably not clearly signpost and the restaurant be erm in the basement
S0265	erm
S0264	so you won't see a restaurant probably on at street level
S0265	there must be something outside which which say that the restaurant's there what's it call or something yeah
S0264	there probably be but you know what it's like in that area there's load of street furniture and street sign
S0265	mm
S0264	well erm i recommend that you have a look at the menu today or tomorrow cos it'll be up for the week
S0265	ah
S0264	and decide before you go and that'll save a lot of time
S0265	mm
S0264	cos if they go away cos they wouldn't cos they then they may not come back for a long time
S0265	yes we just one immediately sit down
S0264	no and that include erm drink because nobody ever seem prepare to order drink and that'll that could cause a long delay think about what about whether whether or not you want a drink or just have tap water
S0265	mm and the concert finish about ten o'clock i suppose
S0264	mm
S0265	so i should be able to get the quarter to eleven train out of victoria
S0264	well you might even be able to get the twenty two seventeen er it officially finish at erm nine fifty
S0265	oh right
S0264	and that's the erm estimate but
S0265	yeah depend how quickly you can get out
S0264	the yes exactly and i might have erm well you can go ahead if you want to erm cos i suppose i'll need to take erm small case
S0265	oh cos you're go up to erm cambridge aren't you
S0264	yeah i can't really i don't know how i can't i can't use that bag any more have you see the state of it
S0265	oh you mean that's like strap
S0264	rucksack
S0265	oh the rucksack no i haven't see the state of it why what's wrong with it
S0264	well it's fall to piece literally things have
S0265	be that the one you get in australia
S0264	yes it's things in that yeah in that arcade things be fall out of it erm loose stuff be fall out because it's all it's rip it's get hole in
S0265	no there's plenty of place where it can get you get a new one they're quite cheap
S0264	well i think i'd get i think i'd have a look in tesco that's where i get the one before and that that be quite that that be quite good quality it seem to last a long time
S0265	mm
S0264	that one that be with a mouse that we never use it be for it be for laptops or something
S0265	no mm the best rucksack i have i get from mark and spencer and it be only fifteen pound and it last age
S0264	yeah be it a sale or what
S0265	erm don't think well it might have be yeah it might have be in a sale
S0264	you can't erm you can't trust mark and spencer though they automatically you think of that that erm umbrella that i get
S0265	yes i know i i buy one
S0264	it's rubbish
S0265	i tell you didn't i i take it back
S0264	oh you take yours back
S0265	i take mine back and i say i'd only have it a couple of weeks and he say yes it look new and i show him what be wrong with it and he cos i he say you should take it up to customer service and they'll probably exchange it for you cos i be just gonna buy a new one
S0264	and do you have your receipt
S0265	no that's why i be just gonna buy a new one cos i hadn't get the receipt with me and i need a brolly urgently cos it be very it be rain very heavily it be my lunchtime the umbrella have break
S0264	which mark and spencer be this then
S0264	you mean
S0265	mm
S0264	well how come you be up there that's nowhere near your work
S0265	it be i be i be out in my lunchbreak i think
S0264	surely you don't walk that far in your lunchbreak
S0265	yeah it's not far
S0264	it's down one hill and up another hill
S0265	yeah so what i often do that
S0264	ah i suppose it's good in
S0265	yeah i like to you know get get a good walk in
S0264	mm
S0265	i don't do it every day but erm i do it maybe once er maybe twice a week
S0264	mm
S0265	just walk up to church where that that area and then back then sometimes i walk along the seafront and then up
S0264	mm
S0265	be it street and back through the town centre or vice versa
S0264	street anyway so i'm go i'll i'll probably take that case and no rucksack but it'll be a nuisance because i suppose i'll have to check it into the cloakroom
S0265	mm you would
S0264	and that mean
S0265	more time
S0264	at the end it could cause a delay in leave and then you don't know how long the applause will take and if they do an encore
S0265	mm
S0264	i think it's unlikely isn't it because erm encore would usually be for soloists that would be the first half wouldn't it
S0265	mm i can't remember the programme now what what be it the rachmaninov a symphony second
S0264	and a new composition
S0265	a new composition by some russian
S0264	chinese
S0265	ah yes be go to that one
S0264	he's not go to it any more
S0265	oh there's not many leave anyway
S0264	well yeah i think it finish next saturday doesn't it
S0265	mm no maybe it be the saturday after it's about the twelfth twelfth of september isn't it
S0264	i don't know
S0265	thirteenth i think's the last one
S0264	anyway i'll erm i'll probably take her i can take her circle line as far as victoria when you go afterwards
S0265	mm
S0264	if it's convenient and then i'll change but erm my train i'll expect i'll get the quarter to eleven train
S0265	right
S0264	cos i don't think i'd make the erm i doubt if i'd make the ten fifteen because it's a long walk to the tube
S0265	right
S0264	that's the problem with that place yeah it do it
S0265	what place the royal albert hall
S0264	well yes and and south kensington tube station where they it take a long time to walk there it doesn't look far but it be it take you know ten fifteen minutes doesn't it
S0265	and there'll be load of people do the same thing
S0264	well i wonder whether there's any point in do it
S0265	what rush it
S0264	no i mean go at all it's suppose to be to celebrate birthday but the whole thing be meaningless
S0265	what do you mean the whole thing be meaningless to celebrate birthdays with have a meal and enjoy the concert it just mean erm
S0264	it's no no where it's weeks it's weeks after the event and there's no relationship be there
S0265	it's alright you probably wouldn't have do it be it not for birthdays
S0264	do you want erm pineapple or erm plums or an orange
S0265	do those erm mandarins need use up
S0264	yeah
S0265	cos i saw one look a bite black a bite manky yes
S0264	well anyway you probably wouldn't want to eat it but anyway do you want a mandarin and something
S0265	yeah i'll have a mandarin yes
S0264	they're not gonna taste very nice be they if they haven't be
S0265	well if they're not very nice i won't eat it
S0264	no i mean because they've be in the fridge
S0265	oh they'll be cold yes
S0264	anyway this be this be from yesterday they bring a very strange selection of fruit i i wonder who decide these things because erm last a week a week yesterday there be one red apple green apples and erm mm don't know whether there be mandarins or not but anyway yesterday there be only green apples and oranges
S0265	mm
S0264	and everybody know that people don't like oranges cos they're messy
S0265	yeah
S0264	erm and erm and the sandwich be quite strange as well cos i i remember erm last last week there be erm i don't be they call shrimp or prawn
S0265	prawn probably
S0264	and yeah sandwich but erm i think they're quite expensive aren't they prawn anyway there be nothing like that
S0265	yeah
S0264	there be there be tin salmon and cucumber er yesterday that be quite nice because of the cucumber
S0265	mm
S0264	that be the nicest and then there be also some cheddar sort of erm what do you call it when the cheddar be put through a sieve grate
S0265	grate cheese
S0264	grate cheese sandwich and probably have bits mm anyway there's nothing to write home about
S0265	brown bread or white
S0264	oh i don't know there's nothing properly brown there be definitely white there and there be something that be off white and there be enough an average of probably there be enough for everybody to have three hearts which in a way be sufficient because i think they add olive oil or something to fill you up
S0265	yeah yeah
S0264	they use to do that at the the sandwich be actually indigestible
S0265	mm
S0264	they they they'd look alright and then you'd eat them and you'd suddenly feel queasy maybe it be salmonella
S0265	mm i'd have think if it be something like salmonella you'd have have pain and vomit
S0264	yeah well i remember take it up with them i think i might have find out i think i might have ask one of the people serve what be in them
S0265	so do you need to eat your own sandwich that you take as well
S0264	yesterday
S0265	yeah or do you have that at in the even or something
S0264	i have them on the train
S0265	oh
S0264	on the way home i didn't i tell you it be a we weren't move around we be tie we be just sit behind a desk for from nine o'clock till four or five o'clock
S0265	yes
S0264	it's horrible and and also in the afternoon for the first time cos of security erm they it be like an exam we have to move the desks from the horseshoe shape to exam style
S0265	oh yes
S0264	a metre a metre apart plus we get give different erm set of paper anyway and you know that bloke from who i tell you about
S0265	erm which one i can't remember
S0264	anyway erm once again do it rather like last saturday erm i hear a i hear a noise and it throw things into his bag and stuff and he walk out and he just like he just just zip through it and finish in an hour or something
S0265	oh
S0264	i think that be strange i mean you can you you could do that you could probably do that you could do that in an on an ordinary work saturday but that that be that be more you have to get it right if you didn't if you don't get it right you have to re do it so i think that be a bite of a risk take that attitude
S0265	mm maybe it's maybe it's it's all stuff he's do for years and years and years
S0264	yeah but i know he's a new person
S0265	oh really
S0264	he might have be do it before somewhere else but
S0265	mm strange
S0264	it's just his attitude anyway i be one of the last people there and make me think maybe my brain be slow down
S0265	it's probably just more conscientious
S0264	i dunno it's true that if there's a deadline then you speed up and there wasn't actually there wasn't a deadline particularly you could theoretically i think you could have carry on till seven o'clock
S0265	mm
S0264	if you'd want to
S0265	and be you the last person
S0264	no i be the last but one
S0265	mm
S0264	or the last but two cos when i finish somebody else finish as well
S0265	mm
