S0618	so hello again
S0618	more coffee okay oh now you know how when you're play music on your phone and you point it towards the wall to get the echo thing
S0619	oh echo mm hm
S0618	and i wonder would we get a better record if we put it towards the wall possibly not
S0619	i have no idea
S0618	me either so let's not chance it right
S0619	not chance it we're on
S0618	oh
S0619	a coffee tour of the city
S0618	i know
S0619	in which they've get like a whole booze selection up there i've never be in here before
S0618	mm no i haven't and it's really nice
S0619	but i know that they have a caf√© here and they have lot of bakeries in the area and it's name after this well the surname of the people who own the company
S0618	ah
S0619	so they specialise in cake obviously and bread but a huge alcohol selection
S0618	mm
S0619	lot of whisky look things and then cake
S0618	and i think the price be very reasonable so it's probably more where locals come than where tourists come
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i suppose we're a little bite off the beat track and by the windows and the general appearance of the place from outside you do really need to stick your head in the door to know what they do
S0619	mm hm yeah i think it's build on reputation as well because i've always as ever like what whose be this name i've see it everywhere
S0618	mm
S0619	erm
S0618	it's good coffee's good
S0619	look nice
S0618	mm i'm very impress with their price of their set menu
S0619	mm hm

S0618	they can get away with i know
S0619	can i use your spoon please see as i throw mine on the floor and then abandon it

S0619	yeah they need to get their money where they can for sure
S0618	yeah you know rent rat insurance all the rest be due three six five a year or three six six this year erm but yeah but they're not earn every day

S0618	well there's father christmas with a saxophone in the window and it's the end of january
S0619	mm
S0618	i love that about poland i love that all of the festive decorations stay up for forever well until february yeah i'm not quite sure why he's play a saxophone and i'm surprise the saxophone hasn't be nick but
S0619	yeah santa claus
S0618	yeah
S0619	not bad coffee but quite strong
S0618	mm yes i'm wonder about the wisdom of two coffees but i'm likely to talk a lot and then later be really knackered
S0619	i know i need to drink load of water if i drink coffee
S0618	yeah
S0619	because i just get the worst headaches
S0618	i get so civilise in in most place in berlin you get a glass of tap water come with your coffee
S0619	mm
S0618	and that's good i like that
S0619	but i think they don't believe in tap water here
S0618	yeah i've notice that it seem to be reasonable quality though
S0619	i think it's fine
S0618	yeah i mean mine go through a brita filter because it's just so bloody limescaley but in well actually i suppose in term of you know quality of drink water it's not like in northern ireland it be pretty much run off the mountains
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and the water you could taste the quality it be beautiful it didn't have fluoride or chlorine or load of chemical shit pump through it like you get in england erm cambridge because there be absolutely no hill erm
S0619	mm hm
S0618	every glass of water you drink have already be piss seven time
S0619	mm hm
S0618	so and it's full of chemicals it's full of fluoride it's really shit water
S0619	yeah it's the same where i live you can just taste metal you can taste
S0618	yeah but haven't you've get hill up your way
S0619	yeah we have
S0618	you've get load of rain
S0619	and we've get load of rain and load of you know
S0618	so why do it need to be treat with such nastiness
S0619	but it's not very nice yeah i sort of think er and so they be like blind test water from different part of the country
S0618	mm
S0618	er you know what could you taste and be it different which be your favourite and the best water in england be in the northeast around northumberland
S0618	ah near the hill again
S0619	yeah because it's quite hilly
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	but
S0618	northern ireland be just so nice so nice it have a slightly nutty taste to my taste bud but i could almost smell the goodness on it
S0619	mm hm mm hm
S0618	it be just incredibly good water incredibly good and cambridge i don't like drink it but then i refuse to buy plastic petrochemical
S0619	yeah i don't like buy bottle water
S0618	bottle stuff
S0619	erm but you know it's funny if you ask people here
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know what's your favourite brand of water
S0618	yeah
S0619	they've all get an opinion
S0618	everybody's get an opinion i know i notice that that you know very soon after arrive i ask for some tap water in a restaurant and they look at me like i be from another planet and say no we don't do that would you like a bottle well no why would i want
S0619	mm hm mm hm
S0618	a bottle it just seem completely nonsensical
S0619	yeah
S0618	and
S0619	i buy water for the bottle
S0618	no
S0619	but they need to probably get a better system
S0618	yeah part of my degree be on water and they talk about it be liquid gold and the new oil
S0619	mm hm
S0618	because i imagine free energy will be available and oil will be redundant in the come decade or perhaps two erm but water be gonna be the resource already war over water erm
S0619	mm hm
S0618	erm and still war over oil but those will be come to a close but yeah war over water that's erm hopefully gonna get knock on the head i mean again as technology have develop and free energy should allow for free desalination so everybody should be able to access free water
S0619	mm hm
S0618	but i suppose what's make a difference be you know pepsi coke nestle danone all of those that have make this massive industry by convince people that tap water be poor quality
S0619	mm hm
S0618	so they sell you water which be also tap water
S0619	mm hm
S0618	in a plastic bottle
S0619	yeah unbelievable
S0618	and pretend it's something health give it's interest the psychology behind it all of it and erm
S0619	if you look on some of the bottle in the supermarkets here
S0618	mm
S0619	erm i can't read what it say obviously but on some there's you know like a picture of erm a mum and a child or a pregnant woman as though this water be specially formulate
S0618	yeah yeah pregnant women
S0619	for pregnant women
S0619	what why or how
S0618	probably be better off with a bottle of guinness mm
S0619	just anyway an interest thing i be listen to on woman's hour this morning which be erm should parent swear in front of their children or deliberately try not to swear in front of their children and for that i've never really think about it
S0618	mm so again i prickle at all of the should or must word
S0619	aha aha
S0618	so even when you've just start that sentence with should i go oh no
S0619	no go on but you know i've not think about well yeah they didn't phrase it as should you but you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	what be the advantage and disadvantage then if you want it in a sort of celta form
S0618	yeah
S0619	what be the drawbacks and benefit
S0618	yeah discuss
S0619	of swear in front of your children
S0618	do you agree or disagree
S0619	er and
S0618	give reason
S0619	partly give reason for your answer in forty five minutes
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	yeah it's interest isn't it erm swear mm my dad never swear and he be my main influence grow up as my mother leave when i be six erm i remember my mum swear my dad never swear my brother who be nine and a half years older swear all the time
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and still do actually he's not he doesn't swear as much as he use to erm for me it depend on who i'm with i swear more around you
S0619	mm hm
S0618	erm i swear actually pretty much never around my dad i don't know i think swear it's interest it can be use for emphasis or to add colour to a
S0619	mm hm
S0618	or depth or texture to a conversation
S0619	i think it's incredibly er patronise
S0618	it have its place
S0619	when people say if you swear a lot it's because you don't have a very good vocabulary
S0618	bollocks
S0619	i think that's complete bollocks i have an excellent vocabulary erm but it er it be more emphasis and stress and it's lot of sort of really positive reason it's a
S0618	yeah
S0619	part of language as well as anything else
S0618	mm
S0619	er it show evolution in language it show where the same word have be use for hundreds of years erm which be really interest erm my dad hasn't start swear in front of me until i be sort of in my early twenties and even now i'm like oh whereas my mum have never swear at me but i think she just doesn't swear anyway
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's not like she deliberately didn't swear in front of me she just doesn't swear
S0618	my dad doesn't swear yeah my dad's the same
S0619	whereas my dad i think he swear a lot at work because he's around erm other sort of men who swear
S0618	mm hm
S0619	who swear a lot erm and i probably swear the most
S0618	yeah
S0619	more than both of them put together but you know how there's like a sort of hierarchy of swear word and i know
S0618	yeah
S0619	we get as far as bollocks but i won't say shit in front of them
S0618	yeah yeah and never a cunt shall be give
S0618	no no
S0619	but i'll go for
S0618	no
S0619	drop something
S0618	yeah
S0619	er
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah it's really interest
S0619	i remember be tell off for say knackered when i be about eleven
S0618	yeah i remember get tell off for that as well
S0619	and i be like that's a swear word
S0618	do you know what that mean go and look it up in the dictionary
S0619	what do it mean in the dictionary cos after that i think well it must be something to do with sex
S0618	yeah
S0619	because i know that sex be wrong
S0618	i think it's too much sex or sex so much sex that you're tire
S0619	ah so it's fatigue from sex
S0618	yeah
S0619	i think it be
S0618	yeah
S0619	just you know it mean you're
S0618	just tire generally no
S0619	wear out yeah
S0618	i think from sex specifically
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah which be nice erm
S0619	but no it say
S0618	that be really interest and i wonder you know think about me personally as well i do feel there's a bite of a gender issue there as well and my generation certainly older i would say it be predominantly men and predominantly work class men
S0619	mm hm
S0618	that swear
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and i so there's a class issue there and a gender issue there
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i think those boundaries have pretty much dissolve for this generation
S0619	mm hm yes i've get a couple of friends or i know a couple of people at school cos i would hang out with all of the boys
S0618	mm
S0619	erm and a couple of them would you know oh we can't talk about that because 's here and you're like what the fuck be you talk about
S0618	what
S0619	and the rest of them would just be like
S0618	it's have you hear of her potty mouth lately
S0619	yeah you know the sort of person go would you like a glass of wine
S0619	and go no thank you i'll have a pint like a normal person
S0618	like a normal person exactly yeah
S0619	er but it be only sort of a couple of them er and i think that say a lot about the sort of mm girls that they know or the girls
S0618	yeah
S0619	that they hang around with or you know their view and stuff rather than the sort of problems with me necessarily but i be always really offend by these people
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm what be i go to say
S0618	i can remember actually as well be around generally older men who
S0619	mm hm
S0618	would swear then notice i be there and say oh you know sorry
S0619	yeah and apologise
S0618	and apologise profusely and that be i don't know i mean be that a sexist thing or be that a respect thing as if to say
S0619	yeah i think the line be really blurry
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it be a combination of both of those things
S0618	very possibly
S0619	erm i think it's do with good intentions but it's come from a bad place
S0618	mm
S0619	erm but on this er programme there be two mums and one say i swear all the time in front of my kid we say sort of deliberately we won't stop
S0618	mm
S0619	we're not gonna swear at our children but we won't stop ourselves from swear where we would naturally and the other one say no never er ever at all we've cut it out completely and then they be talk about the impact on the kid and on how these kid with the mum who or the parent who never swear you know sort of gasp if they hear it on the tv
S0618	yeah
S0619	or you know it's funny if people talk about it in the playground
S0618	yeah
S0619	and the others they just don't bat an eyelid and they don't have they know that it's er offensive language and
S0618	yeah
S0619	that they shouldn't use it in x y z place
S0618	mm hm
S0619	erm but they're not sort of take aback or shock or
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	i wonder if that be the key thing because you know with with swear of course it be a part of language but there be situations where it's more or less appropriate
S0619	mm hm i think
S0618	a bite like any form of language so
S0619	i think a lot of people yeah
S0618	you need to yeah be educate a child as to you know appropriate use of it i guess
S0619	yeah i think a lot of people think kid be kind of er kid be stupid or they won't understand something and they level everything so low
S0618	mm
S0619	but if you say these be bad word erm don't say them in church
S0618	in front of your granny
S0619	in front of your grandma unless she swear
S0618	yeah
S0619	and then at the end of this programme today load of grandmas have email in and go i think this be offensive i be a gran
S0618	yeah yeah i'm a granny
S0619	stop say that they can't you can't swear in front of you know
S0618	oh that's funny
S0619	mouth's in the gutter and all this stuff erm you know and i think explain it
S0618	yeah
S0619	sort of teach it as well as any other sort thing rather than say this be taboo
S0618	yeah
S0619	it should never be speak about in our house
S0618	i think that's possibly the key to it
S0619	i mean it's really negative
S0618	yeah that's possibly the key to it
S0619	i be twenty four i've never have a sex ed or sex base conversation with either of my parent
S0618	oh my god i have just be grateful you haven't
S0619	no explanation nothing about periods nothing about sex
S0618	yeah
S0619	i think the furthest my mother get be don't come home pregnant
S0619	and i be only go to the cinema
S0619	with my boyfriend what do you expect to happen erm you know but that be it so i think there be and then you have to learn from your friends or learn from
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know magazines aim at teenage girls
S0618	yeah
S0619	which be all fine
S0618	and you do pick all the stuff up from you know your peer group
S0619	yeah from society
S0618	and from yeah
S0619	but you know
S0618	whatever you surround yourself with
S0619	mm if and something isn't mention or isn't talk about it i think it can make it not necessarily a taboo or worse but
S0618	it can spark fear in some regard
S0619	that you have a different relationship with that thing be it swear
S0618	yeah
S0619	be it sex be it periods
S0618	yeah
S0619	with someone whose parent be really liberal and open
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	well i think that's a fair summary er yeah er i think what you say about erm educate children in appropriate use or to understand that some people find this offensive some of the time
S0619	mm hm
S0618	erm yeah and i i think you're right you can relate it to talk about sex periods death
S0619	mm hm mm hm mm hm
S0618	that's the last great taboo and people don't talk about death and whenever you don't talk about things like sex or death or whatever it may be that i think be where you be in danger sometimes of people develop fear or develop insecurities or
S0619	mm hm
S0618	have a problem or an issue when there doesn't necessarily need to be one
S0619	mm hm
S0618	if it's introduce as normal everyday commonplace
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah but with the you know those sort of safeguard in place of
S0619	mm hm
S0618	explain
S0619	my my friend's get a son who's seven er and she's sort of no he's not he's older than that he's nine or ten now and she's sort of er give him some sort of on and off sex ed
S0618	mm
S0619	and he say something to her like er she's a single mum but she say you know do you ever he say do you ever do the hump with dad and she go well of course and he go be you thin then
S0618	whoop
S0619	so great
S0618	oh dear in northern ireland i have erm there be friends next door their son have autism and
S0619	mm hm
S0618	they get a lot of materials from they you know they have sort of support workers and what have you and they get a lot of stuff email to them and i work in a large organisation at the time so be able to print stuff out for them and you know double side leaflets or whatever
S0619	mm hm
S0618	so it be 's job to talk to to about sex and to go through these leaflets with him bite by bite and to you know help him to understand that he's reach an age where he's gonna have these urge and this be appropriate and this be less appropriate and look at the diagram and look at the draw and have you ever felt like this
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and if you feel like that well you know basically send him off to his room to go and have a wank and but that's perfectly acceptable but
S0619	mm hm
S0618	you know sort of almost set
S0619	don't do it at the kitchen table
S0618	some boundaries for that exactly but not in front of your sister that type of thing so be say that he be talk to about it or and erm he talk with an american accent and he just say gee dad i think this be more embarrass for you than it be for me and i be just like that be just fantastic and they'd kind of forget that he's probably see it all on tv
S0619	yeah i
S0618	and he
S0619	when people do it it's way too late you know
S0618	yeah yeah and i think he be
S0619	and that's when people get embarrass about it
S0618	yeah
S0619	because they already know and it's embarrass for their parent in tell them
S0618	that's it yeah
S0619	and they're embarrass because they already know

S0619	no well i don't know what's go on in there
S0618	but then and you know you need tampon you need towel you need whatever but then what about the practicalities you know

S0619	i just throw mine away and buy really cheap ones
S0618	yeah
S0619	i throw a pair of a pair away yesterday and i be like there be no hope for you
S0619	especially with my cold rinse wash machine
S0618	oh
S0619	i be like it's time to say goodbye
S0618	yeah but your cold rinse wash machine be probably perfect yeah
S0619	no i just don't trust i just don't trust it
S0618	no
S0619	erm so i just buy really cheap underwear make by some indian children and then have to sort of
S0618	yeah
S0619	dispose
S0618	slave labour
S0619	sort of disposable underwear
S0618	just pretend you're a rock star gigging every night they don't wash their pant do they
S0619	where be you go with this
S0618	have you never think about that you know if you're like on the road do a gig in a different town every night
S0619	i'm go to go to a launderette
S0618	no you don't go to a launderette so of course you'd throw your pant away
S0619	yeah
S0618	that's why i think everyone would have that assumption and that be just me
S0619	absolutely no idea what you're talk about
S0618	okay yeah
S0619	yeah so erm yeah so i have
S0618	i've get pant on i've have more than ten years you know
S0619	but because i only buy cheap underwear
S0618	mm
S0619	they've get an expiry date of sort of three months anyway before they start to fall apart when you're wear them or you know they fade or the stain have just sort of ingrain
S0618	yeah yeah that's why most of mine be black
S0619	yeah so i don't really mind because after three months they're probably knackered anyway
S0618	i should look in poland actually cos it's i'm start to realise now i'd forget about that my pant do i do generally tend to keep them until they fall apart erm i use to always buy them in mark and spark
S0619	mm hm
S0618	but i think mark and spark have that phase where they do great quality stuff and then primark and all the other cheap
S0619	mm hm
S0618	place that use child labour start open and nobody
S0619	yeah
S0618	go to mark and spark
S0619	and then m and s put their price down but
S0618	yeah
S0619	really cheap quality
S0618	shit quality
S0619	yeah
S0618	so where in the world do you buy good quality decade pant these days i don't know that you can
S0619	it doesn't exist decade clothe
S0618	yeah
S0619	unfortunately doesn't exist any more
S0618	oh it do in berlin i yeah when i be do proper work erm and teach et cetera i use to buy all of my blouses in berlin cos you could get
S0619	mm hm
S0618	a hundred percent cotton a good cut a good shape you didn't have to redo all of the sew on the button again because it be already fall apart erm yeah great quality the germans don't accept any shit so maybe i need to buy pant when i'm in berlin
