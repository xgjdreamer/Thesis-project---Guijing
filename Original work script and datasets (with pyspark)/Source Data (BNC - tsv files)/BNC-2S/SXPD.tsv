S0037	yeah
S0115	what's the score
S0037	i dunno uh i think it be i think cardiff be win but i just i be just channel hop and they um it be like they run they have a really good run like he run all round the goalie like they think he be offside so all the other team like put their hand up for offside but like he just run past the goalie and it like literally go past the post by about two millimetres
S0115	ah so it be it be uh very spectacular
S0037	i don't even know what the i don't even know what this game be though like be it the league cup or something i don't even know what the league cup be
S0115	um league cup semi final cardiff versus crystal palace
S0037	i didn't even but what like they've change it so many time like what be the coca cola cup be that the fa cup or something different
S0115	uh that be the league cup i think the coca cola be the league one and fa fa be always fa wasn't it
S0037	be it be it not the something fa cup like the sort of
S0115	well maybe but you don't sort of need to say that do you
S0037	i dunno
S0115	but there be the there be like the autoscreen one or something
S0037	yeah like pott's pies
S0115	auto windshield yeah and the i mean but um
S0037	anyway
S0115	the auto windscreens one or whatever it be i think that be like uh
S0037	there's the carling cup as well what be that
S0115	wasn't there a leyland daf cup or something
S0037	don't be silly there's be no leyland daf cup be there
S0115	i don't know
S0037	i'd like it if there be what would be the most inappropriate thing for there to be like an fa cup name after like fag or something
S0115	well they they do that in you know in snooker don't they have that embassy snooker uh
S0037	oh be that where that come from that just show my ignorance
S0115	uh and of course uh formula one be uh be famous for uh
S0037	there look middlesborough's first and only major trophy success
S0115	when be that the hundred and twenty eight years ago
S0037	middlesborough hasn't wasn't even invent a hundred and twenty eight years ago probablies
S0115	um uh yeah just about uh just about yeah i think they be actually
S0037	that's steve mcclaren that's who
S0115	oh oh yeah no um uh this be uh birmingham win the uh birmingham win the the league cup uh against arsenal i think i watch that one actually last year
S0037	ah yeah you do yeah i remember watch that and you be like yeah
S0115	top of the shock this this be the that be the section of top of the that be number one on top of the shock birmingham city beat uh arsenal in the in the league cup
S0037	but like
S0115	which rank after the fa cup but i think there's there be an there be an even another cup that i think be that be a bite lower
S0037	more rubbish
S0115	but i think that be the one that i think birmingham win a while ago where you where you you only enter it if you be in like the um one of the lower like if you be in then the third division or below
S0037	i don't know i'm obviously not that up to date i think i be football like for life after that whole like work at the thing
S0115	oh uh
S0037	like the pies the pie aspect
S0115	yeah well that be you know that be enterprising and you know i mean it be industrious like you uh you be work at age when do you start that
S0037	just be a bite i don't know if i be enterprising um well you be suppose to be sixteen but i wasn't sixteen i just say i be and like they weren't bother and they didn't check although i'm sure they have me national insurance number so they should probably have well who know it be all a bite dodgy
S0115	yeah best yeah best leave unsolved really yeah
S0037	they use to put the pies like the pies like if they didn't sell them they use to just put them in a box and then put them in a cupboard and then the next week just like crack the pies back out and then put them in the warmer and be like doo dee doo
S0115	scandalous yeah
S0037	because if somebody get like ur um like a bad belly from eat a dodgy pie you would never know cos like i suppose a lot of the blokes and that who go to football and eat those horrible pies like would've have twenty pints of beer anyway so they would never think d'you know what that be a bad pie
S0115	yeah
S0037	like people would laugh wouldn't they if they say that
