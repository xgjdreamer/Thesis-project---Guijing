S0078	okay so i start for my project i want to do something completely different from what i end up do but i get to like a week or two before it be due and i just hadn't learn the program language that i need to to write this game em that i that i want to do for my project but i have something else in mind at the same time and so i'd be sort of work on this sort of in the background and it be actually some build project base in a game call minecraft
S0045	i know minecraft
S0078	and em yeah and eh so i've i've join the game society and they have a they're a minecraft server and i do some project there em one of the project i want to do be a a big statue and base on what i'd hear from em well before i start the course
S0045	yeah
S0078	i do a google search for one of my lecturers and eh manage to find a video of him eh talk to someone sort of for an for an event
S0045	oh right
S0078	and he be talk about the concept that he be explore in his art work and it's a thing call cyber provincialism which be kind of the the it's explore the concept that online even though you're potentially connect to everyone in the world there's a tendency for people to be close off and create their own close knit communities and
S0045	yeah i see yeah
S0078	and and imitate work of art and bits of culture that that's quite local to them and so you'll get sort of small quaint villages
S0045	oh right so you sort of get so you sort of get things that kind of yeah i guess localise
S0078	yeah so you you get a potential for these vast metropolises fill with load of like diverse em culture and background and stuff but you end up get these close communities em so i want to explore that idea and and in the video at the end when ask how what what would be the role of an artist em to to explore this idea or to confront it and em he suggest that perhaps the artist could expand em sort of enlarge the the garden gnome to the size of the statue of liberty or something just just poke fun of out of it and em so so that that be part of the reason for this first art project that i be go to do em and enter into of course what i think i be go to be do which be creative education they ask us to get completely obsess with something just one particular theme
S0045	oh right
S0078	just to explore what it be to to get obsess and eh i'd recently buy minecraft so i decide i'd go for that and just learn absolutely everything about it and em eh something that come across when i be look at bits and bob be that a lot of people on minecraft servers be in their own little worlds they tend to make these monuments to mario it's a it's a very easy statue to make there's there's pixel art of mario and it happen all the time so i have sort of combine those ideas in my head and think it would be a bite of fun to make a sort of combination of a garden gnome the statue of liberty and super mario
S0045	oh wow
S0078	in eh on on the server and eh so when i announce it to people that sort of get excite about it and sort of make an island for it to sit on and eh some people be try think they might make a little sort of hide illuminati style base
S0045	wow
S0078	and i get a bite of help in in the build but it be quite a complex design because rather than just be a 2d pixel art i sort of get give it some depth and i look up some super mario three em pixel art and so i get the side and the front and sort of merge them together give him a pointy beard and a pointy hat and and give him a torch and the tabula em ansata or whatever it's call the declaration of independence thing that the statue of liberty hold
S0045	how long do it take to actually make em you know the the the actual statue itself
S0078	em well the first time i in in design it in mine craft you've get a thing call creative mode work that allow you to fly around and you have infinite resources so it's quite easy to make these things but em in build on the server eh i be in survival mode of i have to mine my own resources but eh one of the guy who have em em modulator
S0045	yeah mods
S0078	yeah he he be a mod so
S0045	yeah
S0078	so he he be basically in creative so he could give me all the resources that i need em so i've sort of get maybe about half way through it and em and someone ask me why be it a gnome why isn't it just mario and i be sort of like eh this be it's suppose to be a sort of artistic statement about cyber provincialism and he say why can't it just be fun i be like mm well it be still kind of fun but it kind of shove it down a bite for me so i leave it for age and then
S0045	yeah you know kind of morph them cos it's take bits of different culture as oppose to be what's the word like insular and isolate
S0078	yeah well it be just sort of combine those ideas i don't think it be particularly well justify in the end it be just a little bite of nonsense so that be em that be one idea and i do come back to it and finish it eventually em so the well the module the name of the module be art and social network so i one of the ideas that i have to eh build in minecraft be em cut me off when it's be fifteen minutes be eh eh if you make the grind out of a certain material
S0045	yeah
S0078	then it's not em it it light up when you tread on it but it doesn't produce enough light for the eh monsters to not spawn
S0045	oh i see no you're right okay
S0078	yeah so i i decide it would be a good idea to have this massive arena make out of red stone
S0045	mm
S0078	and close it off so that the sunlight didn't get on it so these monsters would spawn in this arena and you could just go and fight them and there'd be enough light that you'd see and the light the floor would light up as they be these monsters be walk around on it and em people really get behind that and it be a really simple design it be em it be just a dome so it be quite easy to figure out how to do it and the floor be just a circle of red stone so load of people be really keen to to help out and help me make this and it be fairly close to where everyone be do their business and build their things and it also from a distance it just look bloody huge eh i call it the desert dome because there's just this massive sandy desert and then in the middle there's this stone dome just stand there
S0045	big arena kind of thing
S0078	yeah it it's really quite strike and people you know not only do they help out but they really sort of put their own creativity into it there be em someone make a rail link from the the main city where everyone be
S0045	oh wow
S0078	out to this place em someone make eh someone want to make a mechanical doorway for it em unfortunately the creeper the em explode monsters keep on blow it up and they get quite upset about that
S0045	love it
S0078	and eh em the the creepers em don't burn in the sunlight so if you get chase out by a creeper it will carry on follow you so someone decide to make a eh sort of sanctuary tower that you could really escape from the creepers in and some one sort of decorate the inside of the dome with light and someone em eh place a bunch of eh sort of little light around where you could find a little space for respite and cave where you could repair your health and stuff and em yeah i'd sort of hear i didn't see every time someone use it but you could tell like by the time that server have finish that that map have finish there be sort of load of hole all over the place because people have be use it
S0045	excellent
S0078	so yeah yeah that be that be a much more em positive project that actually work out quite well
S0045	yeah it's quite nice when you see it sort of evolve as well
S0078	yeah
S0045	cos i guess it's something it's it's a bite like em it's a bite like the sort of mass effect game where you sort of you know you're give an idea and you've get you know the develop a crazy idea but then people kind of retake it themselves
S0078	yeah yeah so um the there be the third thing that i do em which i didn't even realise would take off as much as it do but the reason i come up with this last idea be em on the map with the desert down in the mario statue eh there be a little bite of em vandalism go on and i just and and quite a lot of steal as well and i just think it would it would lessen the blow on individuals and there'd be a lot more of a community spirit if we just share all of our resources apart from our most valuable resources which you'd have to hide nicely but em the the things like em dirt and wood and sand and and meat and stuff would be completely communal
S0045	yeah
S0078	and you'd have your eh your enchant table and your your forge and your brewery and stuff where everyone could just use these resources so erm
S0045	it's kind of like a virtual communist state
S0078	yeah yeah it really be so em i find the most obvious place on the map after the last one have be dilute because eh version one point o come out em so i go to the coordinate zero zero and start build this town and there's this eh there's this one guy on the server that be a bite too keen just spend hours and hours and hours play on it and i just sort of set up the basics and he make it look beautiful we have a communal mine as well which which be really nice and em to to keep the animals as well eh just want sort of little fence pen but this guy make a huge huge great barn
S0045	oh wow
S0078	and eh yeah it it everyone really enjoy it and they be still able to em sort of build their own little house around it well quite massive house but yeah they be able to em because all of the communal build be line up on this street it it be quite a go do focal point for everyone else to build this stuff em and eh one of the things that em get a lot of attention and a lot of er creative input from people be on december the first i make a huge great naked christmas tree and just post the picture of this naked christmas tree up onto facebook and instantly people be on there sort of decorate and put present around the bottom and stuff and em and that be great and there be this eh there be one guy who build a castle a little distance away from it and he be invite people to come and do a bite of player versus player with him and eh no one really go for it so yeah kind of kind of felt bad for him but then there be a little bite of vandalism and sort of steal go on em
S0045	yeah
S0078	and then eventually i think round about the christmas holiday the whole place just get completely burn to shit
S0045	oh no
S0078	there be lava this this guy have burn down the christmas tree who do that it's just mental
S0045	it's just mankind isn't it
S0078	yeah it be just really really weird and he and he send a sort of statement to the game society say you guy be all em hold hand and let's be best friends forever and stuff and game isn't about that it's about competition and it be like no it it's just have fun this guy be just psycho he be just really weird em so that's that's what happen to that and i stop play minecraft shortly after em yeah how be we do yeah okay em so yeah i speak to em i sort of i give a talk about all of this to em my class and em they yeah they be really interest in this guy who who have attack everyone else and sort of lash out because he couldn't cos he couldn't get his player versus player experience that he want he be hop to sort of prod people into turn on each other before but instead it just sort of have the opposite effect because on the next one instead of sort of think okay from now on it's go to be player versus player i'm go to keep all my resources i'm not go to let anyone near them and set up trash and everything instead eh because i actually do set up some trap on the first map like i have my storage bunker underneath my house and if you drop down you'd fall in to some lava and then the next time i go there he'd destroy the em barrier around the lava the lava have escape and just burn all of my resources
S0045	oh no
S0078	so i guess that's my own bloody fault but em
S0045	jesus
S0078	so in the next map i hope that i kill him before he'd figure out he could do that em but yeah in the next map i just go completely the opposite direction
S0045	yeah
S0078	and it cause him to just just go completely the other direction as well he just completely just lose it em so when i explain this to my class they be really sort of intrigue by this idea and em and then in the write up i explain that em my my original idea about em eh eh cyber provincialism which be the concept that sort of start the whole build in minecraft em project em at first it be like em when i first hear about it i be think maybe em the idea be that these people in their game worlds have sort of close off from the real world but that wasn't so much the case because there be things that enter into the minecraft universe that be factor in the real world like there be em occupy wall street and occupy london and stuff like that
S0045	oh they actually do versions of it
S0078	em well when minecraft one point zero be release there be minecon which be the em the sort of convention in eh las vegas
S0045	yeah
S0078	and the group who be televise it be record everything and stuff em be wear occupy minecraft t shirt and there be a lot of discussion apparently accord to one of these journalists who cover it em there be a lot of discussion about how they can bring the occupy movement into minecraft and sort of enthuse everyone because it's quite quite a connect community the minecraft community with the creative project that go on and em when steve job pass away the someone put em build a massive eh sign in the main eh the village on one of the map r i p steve job and sort of do a ipod thing and and draw make a ipod out of block and em so so news do have a way of get in so that that that's one part of cyber provincialism that em that one way of look at it that that i consider em another be eh bring various communities eh no the get a community to to look at different culture
S0045	mm
S0078	and there be an example that that really inspire me in the first place of em a youtube channel where they em eh this this guy who present the show eh get everyone on his minecraft server to to build over the course of a week or a month to em on a certain subject so like for once it's be a western theme so they've build a load of western towns and stuff and eh reference to back to the future three and stuff like that
S0045	oh excellent
S0078	and eh they do one em far east they do one of underwater worlds they do one of the future em and that's one way of sort of brine in other culture
S0045	oh wow
S0078	and make it sort of expand the world and and really make it a bite more international em and and then it's funny how it end up be eh a bite of an explanation of these these clash of culture in in that guy who think it be all about player versus player he he find himself lock in this this province that he didn't feel he belong to and and he just he couldn't cope with it
S0045	so he have to destroy it
S0078	yeah so eh sort of
S0045	read lord of the fly
S0078	all all come round like that em so yeah since then em i have a bite of a scare about worry that i be get addict to video game and not really pay attention to to really do artistic project out outside of minecraft or outside of video game em so i quit play minecraft for a bite but i've sort of be in there once or twice since and eh that that guy that build that build the em eh that build the massive barn
S0045	yeah
S0078	he have build these massive project and it they haven't be as collaborative as they be before so i i go back on recently and sort of join in for a little bite and i'm go to build this massive tower but em i really want to wait to involve a lot more people so i make a couple of sort of teeny little challenge because when i be try this this tower thing we get the guy who give me the resources for the mario statue em he help em dig a massive hole eh so that we'd have the tower from bedrock all the way up to the very top so it would be the biggest possible tower so he make load of channel with dynamite em and we build these wall up so that the water couldn't get through cos it be for some reason we decide to build it on the coast we wall up the eh water and then there's this guy make channel of dynamite and eh the guy who be em who i be help he say it's alright know what he's do he's he's an expert with tnt he know he know where the be and i trust him and i be sort of get further and further away go yeah you trust him and lo and behold he completely blow up the wall the whole thing be just completely flood and em so ask him nicely if we could have creative mode so we get the resources we be able to fly we build up the wall again and eh he it be only suppose to be for one day and em have have creative take away from him but for whatever reason and none of the other mods have take it away from me so i've build some sort of puzzle challenge and stick them up on facebook for for people to have a go at and em sort of build them in eh use creative modes and that's yeah it's just another way of try to bring people together use minecraft and creative project and yeah
