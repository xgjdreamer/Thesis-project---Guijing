S0192	do you think we'd need that
S0199	i don't know you'd need some kind of mirror in your place wouldn't you
S0192	i imagine there's a mirror in the bathroom okay i'm gonna write it down
S0199	i'll write it down on the list and then i'll put a question mark on it
S0192	yeah maybe
S0199	i mean if you decide these we can bring them down later on once you're in you'll know more of what you need or what you could use and
S0192	yeah
S0199	we've get a printer upstairs in the loft but erm the cartridges would probably cost you more than go to a library and print stuff off
S0192	erm quite a few of the printers nowadays don't the drivers aren't set up for the new windows 8
S0199	yeah these be old printers so i'm not sure
S0192	so yeah i need to get a new printer i've and i have find one online for like thirty forty pound and it do fairly cheap ink cartridges so
S0199	well maybe that's something and i can get you when when we get back from holiday for a kind of
S0192	yeah that sound good
S0199	congratulation get engage present
S0192	yeah sound awesome
S0199	yeah okay
S0192	if that's alright with you
S0199	yeah so if i put printer to get
S0192	but i mean you could just take me shop and i can get the printer cos i mean probably i'm go to have to buy the printer on amazon so i mean i'm go to have to pay for that anyway so unless you give me the money now
S0199	well i can transfer the money into your account
S0192	or you just take us shop it's up to you
S0199	okay
S0192	which would would you prefer to get us a printer then
S0199	i think i'd like to get you a gift i know it's stupid
S0192	well shopping's a gift isn't it
S0199	yeah it's true
S0192	set me up with all my spice and all that kind of stuff and everything
S0199	okay alright we'll do that then instead cos you'll need that earlier anyway won't you i should imagine
S0192	yeah i mean i'll need that although i may have already get that stuff by the time you come up and i probably have already get the printer by the time you come up as well
S0199	there's bind to be something though isn't there
S0192	oh yeah there'll be something leave over i'm sure
S0199	even if i just give you fifty quid for shop
S0192	er fifty quid's always good i'm not go to say no
S0192	say if we do actually get marry er i mean like april next year may erm maybe a bite of money towards a new suit or something would be good maybe instead because i'm go to need a new
S0199	well not instead we'd give you that anyway as part of the get marry
S0192	no erm instead's fine cos i'm go to need a new suit and i think basically if we do it as cheap as possible will still need a dress
S0199	of course
S0192	and i'll still need a suit so
S0199	you want to make it special as well
S0192	well
S0199	you can still do it on a budget
S0192	i mean er it's not go to be a wed dress it will just be a dress
S0199	yeah something that
S0192	she'll just get a new dress so she can have a dress and
S0199	yeah
S0192	i'm go to need a suit for my new job anyway so
S0199	mm so it's multi
S0192	yes that's how it work
S0199	multi purpose
S0192	we're still hum and harring over whether or not she's actually go to change her passport or not because it it change well it like triple the cost of the wed
S0199	really
S0192	well the if we
S0199	could she not double barrel it
S0192	if we go on a weekday that still cost cos if you change your name in any way then you have to get a new passport so
S0199	but it's illegal isn't it or can you
S0192	it's illegal
S0199	you can't you can't travel what so she would just keep her name
S0192	she'd just keep her name
S0199	can you do that
S0192	yeah you don't have to change your name at all she could keep her name in fact in the middle east where we're go they don't change their name the women keep their father's name rather than take their mother have take them
S0199	could you not just erm so if you get marry and it be be it
S0192	i think sound better than
S0199	yeah but if she do it that way then she would have to change it wouldn't she
S0192	either way well then we'd both have to change it i mean if she be just one
S0199	yeah that's true
S0192	if she be or and i be just that would be a bite weird wouldn't it we'd have to both become double barrel
S0199	if you have as the surname then you could get away with it but it still wouldn't be legal would it
S0192	and if she we can change our name when we get marry but the cost of the marriage at the the place on a weekday be like forty pound cost of a new passport be like a hundred and twenty pound it's literally like three time the
S0199	yeah but don't forget you're not go to be do this on your own we put towards 's wed we'll put towards yours and i'm sure your dad will and 's parent will
S0192	yeah but i mean you can help us get a suit can't you get me a suit
S0199	yeah yeah i know but the the things that you're think about which you say be a hundred pound or whatever that could be cover in all of you know if you want to have your name the same
S0192	yeah i mean that's true erm
S0199	but that's something when you
S0192	but then also she'd have a new passport and we like collect our stamp
S0199	yeah
S0192	and she might be a bite like i think maybe recently erm when we get the new apartment in brighton they send us a copy of the contract and they've write both of our name in as a mr and mrs er and i think she maybe would like to get her name change
S0199	i think that's quite nice
S0192	maybe but i have to tell them that there be a problem
S0199	have she wear a ring
S0192	yeah yeah she wear it she doesn't wear it all the time but she wear it
S0199	what finger do she wear it on
S0192	that one so she say actually that she doesn't like wear ring on these finger anyway so she wear them obviously on that one
S0199	so that feel comfortable or even on her thumb maybe
S0192	but i mean i've promise her that the ring itself you know it be wood so they do get damage and they will break and just don't worry about it
S0199	mm it be a token yeah
S0192	if she lose it or it break so i don't want her to be freak out about it if she lose it
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	like people do with their wed ring
S0199	yeah
S0192	i just say that i promise her that i will always replace that ring
S0199	yeah
S0192	and it doesn't have to be the same ring
S0199	she can choose the next one if she want to
S0192	it could be a different ring yeah so
S0199	yeah
S0192	she will always have a nice wooden ring that i've buy her
S0199	yeah
S0192	so when that one break or get old so the next one we can make it to fit here
S0199	yeah
S0192	if we do get physically marry she'll buy me a wooden one that will fit
S0199	yeah that's nice
S0192	it'll just be like that really erm so yeah that depend on how the job hunt go that might be happen like in april or may next year obviously we're just tell people that we're marry cos there's
S0199	mm it confuse a lot of people didn't it on facebook
S0192	i bet it do yeah you know i mean i'm not particularly traditional
S0199	no
S0192	mm but it think people do find it strange
S0199	god i'm tire today be you
S0192	yeah i'm i be knackered last night when we go to bed completely knackered
S0199	well you must have be
S0192	but erm as i say i felt really spacey it be a bite weird erm i didn't sleep very well either
S0199	no
S0192	but i feel i feel better today erm it's jetlag isn't it i'm bind to feel a bite make for the first night
S0199	yeah i didn't sleep very well last night i think i be aware of kind of come in and wake you up and the cat and everything so
S0192	do come down immediately
S0199	i do
S0192	or be that be that you yeah
S0199	yeah because i suddenly i don't know why it go through my head but i suddenly think oh my god i've leave the key in the back door
S0192	oh oh so can't get in yeah
S0199	so i i creep down yeah so i otherwise he'd have be knock and ring the doorbell cos i'd put the key under the mat and then put the other key and leave them in the door
S0192	so you do leave them in there
S0199	so i could have quite easily go to bed and not even think about it
S0192	yeah
S0199	but something it's weird isn't it
S0192	you'd have have to get up in the night
S0199	like something just trigger in your head when you go through the process of
S0192	so you do leave it in the door then
S0199	i do i come down and take it out
S0192	yeah it be weird that stuff you pick up in your periphery isn't it
S0199	yeah
S0192	like you don't realise that you have consciously note
S0199	no
S0192	but then like yeah i've do that yeah i need to go and sort that out
S0199	it really be
S0192	it's a bite strange i have that sometimes
S0199	but then there be other things i think right i've get to go upstairs and do blah blah blah get up there and i can't remember what i'm do
S0192	no yeah and your brain work the other way
S0199	and i stand there yesterday be one of this instance and i walk out of the kitchen into here and i stand there and i think i have no idea why i've just walk into this room
S0192	do that get worse as you get older
S0199	i don't know
S0199	whether it's tiredness as well and
S0192	yeah
S0199	a lot on my mind i don't know but er finally it come oh oh oh
S0192	oh god be that your foot
S0199	it be my it's so funny
S0192	oh god i'm sorry
S0199	erm
S0192	how long will that take to heal
S0199	it say about four to six weeks so
S0192	and you've never break anything
S0199	no
S0192	you haven't even break your rib or
S0199	no

S0192	and from what i look up people say it you know it be a break rib and then that happen again with again same guy punch me
S0199	oh
S0192	in the same rib and like that be about three months later and then it i have the same pain and couldn't breathe and it be like couldn't sleep on it so i think i break the same rib
S0199	so you wouldn't be surprise if you have an x ray and you find few fracture there

S0199	yeah and stick the the sting out and i be like it's get worse i'm get worse i say suck the venom out he go you've gotta be joke
S0192	sit here on the beach suck your buttock
S0199	i say i don't care about anybody else just get rid of this sting and then i just hobble up the beach and go straight to first aid because it be get worse and my leg be start to feel a bite numb so i think i have no idea what i've be sting with
S0192	yeah this say here people often say it's much worse than a wasp or a bee sting you can have severe pain itch swell redness numbness tingle nausea vomit headaches abdominal cramp do you get any of these things
S0199	no but afterwards
S0192	lightheadedness increase urination tremor
S0199	i felt extremely tire and i felt like i need to go to sleep
S0192	rare and severe symptoms include abnormal heart rhythms weakness shortness of breath seizures
S0199	oh my god
S0192	gangrene tissue degeneration and unconsciousness mm
S0199	luckily i get my bottom in some hot water straight away
S0192	that's a bite random isn't it although extremely unpleasant weever sting be not generally dangerous and the pain will ease considerably within a few hours even if untreated
S0199	mm
S0192	complete recovery may take a week or more so yeah you be lucky you get that do
S0199	well this erm the first aid guy they must've be in their mid well he be i think he be about twenty four and i just think i'm in so much pain here i don't care how embarrass this be
S0192	there've be two deaths
S0199	what from weever fish
S0192	someone die in nineteen twenty seven suffer multiple sting but there could have be
S0199	oh
S0192	multiple cause exacerbate it and then on the coast of majorca erm it be a possible weever sting although it could've be a sea snake so yeah
S0199	oh it's probably something else i should imagine
S0192	but there you go you get sting by something legitimate
S0192	it wasn't you know
S0199	exactly i wasn't make it up so i do that
S0192	have you be sting by a jellyfish
S0199	and then i felt no
S0192	yeah
S0199	but apparently jellyfishes be nothing
S0192	no yeah
S0199	in comparison to weeverfish
S0192	i've i've be sting by a jellyfish and it wasn't that bad
S0199	really
S0192	i mean it depend on the jellyfish you can die from certain jellyfish anyway
S0199	do you remember the jellyfishes in the erm pool
S0192	they might've just be they might've just be compare the jellyfish in around british seas to weeverfish
S0199	oh maybe yeah yeah
S0192	because portuguese man o' war or box jellyfish they can kill you so i think that's worse than a weeverfish
S0192	i don't know which one sting me but it sting me three time when it get me cos they it sting me the first time and it be like an electric shock and then it spin me i swear it spin me round in the water with like a jolt

S0199	mm
S0192	and they're not go to travel to meet me
S0199	mm mm

S0192	i mean if he's around whenever i'm around then i'll see him
S0199	mm mm

S0199	yeah
S0192	we're meet a different class of friend now
S0199	yeah
S0192	a different
S0199	i think you just have to look at the friends that you meet along your journey for a reason at that time they be great friends and you get on this way or that way and then you meet another friend and it's kind of like
S0192	mm no definitely
S0199	i mean when i think of
S0192	the whole idea that you keep friends for the rest of your life be just not
S0199	yeah
