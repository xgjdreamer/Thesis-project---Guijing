S0282	button start record okay that's start record and that one i think have start record if i yes it have okay so erm and i be go to talk about erm er er something that we've both be go through erm over the last few months and years which be our experience of have cancer and be treat for cancer specifically gynaecological cancers and we're do this record with two object erm number one be towards the cambridge university press erm research but secondly we're hop that the tape will be use as well by a charity which be call the eve appeal erm which erm be campaign on erm a greater awareness of i can't even say it gynaecological cancers amongst obviously amongst women er in erm in this country and erm be interest in the view of some of their members and supporters er in the awareness of cancer and the symptoms of cancer et cetera amongst young people er in particular so we're gonna talk about that and the other thing we're gonna talk about be about the cancers that we've have and our experience of of have cancer so we're gonna talk about body part and stuff like that as well because part of what the eve appeal have discover be that younger women be less likely to know the part of their body involve be able to locate them on a map of the body and actually be able to use the terminology so although there's an assumption in our society that younger people be freer and easier about sex and and er health et cetera this turn out from a recent piece of research to be not at all the case so i don't know what you felt when you read that press release that they put out
S0646	well i be so shock actually er and baffle because erm the point be that many people die because they feel too embarrass to go to their doctor and use word like vagina or vulva and er and obviously the earlier you can get get cancers the better and this thing to tie in with this project cos it's also a language issue so it just seem a rather nice tie up to do
S0282	yeah
S0646	erm so interestingly think about language erm you know er it's i suppose to use word the ones er where the synonyms for them be be kind of off put and rather horrible and and their clinical term sound clinical so er so just isn't a kind of nice word be there erm so vagina or vulva that's it you you might feel comfortable with erm the kind of the slang would be possibly derogatory
S0282	no and then when you go and see the doctor and they say i'm afraid i'm gonna have to stick my finger up your back passage
S0646	yeah
S0282	and you sort of think oh
S0282	that's a bite weird as well and the the doctor use kind of baby language or something
S0646	yeah yeah exactly i mean the language that doctor use i have actually interestingly find erm that the language they use to you be quite subtly different to the language that they write to your gp
S0282	mm
S0646	so sometimes erm i have the consultation with the oncologist and i think i i've get it what she say and then when i get the copy of the letter to the doctor i find that the language be slightly different and actually the mean be slightly different as well which be quite interest
S0282	yeah
S0646	and so perhaps they also recoil at use word like that
S0282	and a lot of them be young women as well
S0646	they be yes exactly i mean my oncologist be
S0282	mm
S0646	erm and er yeah that that's kind of odd isn't it and so how do one get people to realise that it's a lot less daunt to go to your doctor and say the word vagina or the word vulva than it be to get cancer
S0282	yeah
S0646	which
S0282	well perhaps actually if these young women don't know can't point to a picture of what be what when they're show a diagram then perhaps the doctor aren't use the proper language because they they think the hearer's not gonna
S0646	yeah true
S0282	understand it
S0646	yeah
S0282	and er but they i mean if i be a doctor i would probably assume that it be the ladies of sixty seventy eighty that that didn't use those word or didn't like those word or didn't understand what those word refer to and that it would actually conversely be the younger women who erm have do personal and social health education at school or biology o level or gcse more recently who would be able to say oh yes and pin the tail on the donkey easily
S0646	yeah
S0282	give a diagram
S0646	exactly
S0282	but actually it seem to be the younger women who be have the difficulty and be that because biology be optional at school these days i mean what what be that about
S0646	i really don't know it's it i i really really don't know why that be whether they be think of examine that at all or study it at all wonder if it's just
S0282	mm it's just a huge gap
S0646	that we're more squeamish or whether people of an older age be just more down to earth about their body or
S0282	i don't know but that cos at first i think okay they say women in erm a particular age group which be er what age group be it erm women age sixty six to seventy five and i think well okay erm perhaps it's because older women have have baby but then you and i haven't have baby
S0646	no
S0282	so erm but we think you know perhaps i think well perhaps they you pick up the language about the body part during obstetric consultations erm but it's not necessarily that
S0646	yeah and also i mean the the other surprise thing anyway be that you know it be mean to be like cancer be the sort of big unmentionable subject in
S0282	yeah
S0646	those days
S0282	yeah
S0646	and actually it's mention all the time now
S0282	yeah
S0646	and so it's not the big unmentionable subject but perhaps conversely because it be mention so much people be maybe more frighten of it than they be before i don't know because you you just read so much stuff about it
S0282	yeah
S0646	erm it's it's just a very strange
S0282	i mean the other thing that strike me in that that really depress me be that when you hear stories about young people and sex and pregnancy it still seem to be the case that girls aren't enjoy sex particularly they're do sex cos boys want it boys and girls be learn about sex through the internet and through watch pornography which give them a completely unrealistic picture of what it's all about and what it can be like and in particular girls that that sort of portrayal be not particularly helpful for girls and for girls have a healthy sex life and then you also then hear that girls be do it under duress and they're not really enjoy it they're do it cos boys want them to do it
S0646	yeah
S0282	and you just think after all these years of effort about sex education and liberation of women and you've still get a situation in which young women be miss out in this really really major way on something that's really important in life and perhaps those two things be go together then perhaps that sort of ignorance about have a healthy joyous sex life and not know about what your bits be call and what they do you know perhaps it's all of a piece so and that actually sex the whole sex education thing have just go to pot
S0646	i don't know but i mean i suppose align with that be all the other pressure on women to look perfect and
S0282	mm
S0646	look up the sort of airbrush model of perfection all the time and maybe there's something about body image in that erm that perhaps we didn't use to have you know
S0282	well people be have plastic surgery now in their
S0646	yeah well exactly so that sort of erm i mean it and it's sort of ironic isn't it that kind of the like of you who have be maul over by major surgery but we're glad to be here on the planet really never mind what we look like you know we're glad to exist erm
S0282	yeah
S0646	so it's a it's a strange er you know it's a very long journey you go on from er from be too worry to say the word to to i mean that you've get cancer you know you just can't be squeamish cos there's lot of stuff that's gonna happen to you and erm you know it's none of it's pleasant and er you know you've gotta deal with the fact that nurse be gonna have to clear up after you and you know embarrass and horrible but that's life
S0282	yeah well i mean
S0646	and that's
S0282	i be at the hospital yesterday for a check up and be with me erm erm and so er they sort of they feel all your glands and then they stick a speculum in your vagina and they look look to see what's there and then they feel and then they stick their finger up your bum as well and then erm so and my husband's just sit there on the other side of a curtain and the first time this happen he say but you you just lay there and they do that to you and like this be really extraordinary i say yeah i mean that's be do thousands of time hundreds of time you know and he find it really strange that you could meet somebody and the next minute they're poke you around like that
S0282	and he he couldn't believe it and he say be that what women have to put up with and i say yeah yeah yeah yeah you know have it from the age of whenever from teenage years upwards from the time when you have your first smear or erm you know you first have a er any kind of gynae problem erm you just get use to sort of hop on the couch and put your legs in stirrups and stuff like that and he be horrify erm and he will hardly go to the doctor about anything let alone the prospect of somebody stick their finger up his bum when he go
S0282	so that too bad so so i i well perhaps as women you do get use to stuff people kind of poke around in your nether regions and
S0646	well i mean i think i mean i think that an equivalent with men and prostate cancer and bowel cancer as well that you know
S0282	mm
S0646	they don't go for those things either and er
S0282	no
S0646	erm and those sort of all also embarrass things maybe there's a need for a kind of common cause across the cancers to erm to just get you know to say look don't be squeamish cos your life be on the line here and it's
S0282	yeah
S0646	better to go and talk to someone and these doctor and nurse they've see it all before that's what they do day in day out you know and our bits don't know any different to anybody else's bits and
S0282	no
S0646	you know that's what they're train to do and
S0282	er although actually i remember once have a cyst erm on my vulva erm which which get infect in the end and have to go to the doctor because it this sort of giant lump which be really quite painful and sore and everything and go to see a doctor but just book in to see the doctor the next nearest doctor who turn out to be a young asian woman and when i say i have a cyst erm and the look of absolute distaste that go across her face be really and then so she say oh i'd better have a look and i get on the couch and her face be just she be just really repulse and i'd and i be and i be mortify at the time and then afterwards i think you know what you know that would be enough to make you not go back quite
S0646	yeah
S0282	clearly
S0646	yeah
S0282	and it be only it be er only a second or two until she catch herself and sort of think right you know i'd better get on with this you know i've gotta do it and but but i saw the look go across her face very very plainly so i think that be exactly what people be scar of exactly what they're scar of there's somebody think oh that's disgust ah
S0646	yeah yeah
S0282	and i suppose if i have be bolshier i might have kind of pick her up on it and but i didn't i just go away and erm and then when i do have cancer erm it take me quite a while to feel that my symptoms be severe enough to justify bother the doctor because i go and i be go and i be say look i've get these symptoms and the doctor be say oh that's very i wonder what that be and and i keep sort of think to myself should i go back should i shall i say something shall i say that the you know that that what she's do so far hasn't sort this out and and so every few months i would go back and i'd say okay well i'm still i'm still bleed and and she would say oh that's a bite strange erm er to the point where i sort of though well perhaps it's not of interest at all
S0646	well i mean i do think one of the most important things be to educate women
S0282	mm
S0646	about what's normal and what isn't normal
S0282	yeah
S0646	and and what to ask for
S0282	yeah
S0646	and maybe it's quite a good thing on this tape to say something about what your symptoms be and if you be do it again and you be go to advise a young woman sort of in your position you know what what what would you have do differently do you think
S0282	oh well i well it's like and haven't even ask you what your cancer be
S0646	oh well mine be ovarian
S0282	it be ovarian okay alright so mine be endometrial cancer which be erm a cancer of the line of the womb and erm it be most prevalent in women post menopause so the way usually what happen be that i think or i gather be a women will have her menopause and her periods will stop and then after menopause she'll have an unexpected bleed which be either a one off thing erm which my mother actually have when she be in her seventies just all of a sudden a cascade of blood out of nowhere after years and years of have be you know post menopause or else persistent bleed so erm so i think that's the reason cos i be er gosh how old be i fifty three or something and i hadn't finish my periods i think that's the reason why the doctor didn't think that there be anything sinister about me just have this persistent bleed but in retrospect i hit fifty and when i hit fifty i didn't i i just wasn't well in this really weird kind of unaccountable kind of way and i couldn't work out what be wrong with me but i be just distinctly out of sort and then erm i start to get erm my periods have sort of tail off and get lighter and lighter and lighter start to get slightly heavier periods and a bite of pain and erm and then they sort of tail off again and then i start spot and then the spot become permanent erm so it be happen all the time erm and then later on it get more persistent so there be more blood and
S0646	how long a period be that i mean
S0282	well this be probably this be probably over eighteen months to two years
S0646	okay
S0282	during which time i i go to the doctor and i say look i've get this persistent spot and erm and she and she sort of say oh i think it's probably go to be your thyroid that's out of whack cos i also say well i've put on a lot of weight over the last year or two and erm i don't think i'm do anything particularly different but i just keep on seem to get fatter and fatter all the time so she say oh i think it's probably your thyroid because the bleed will be consistent with thyroid problem so she send me for test and indeed i do have underactive thyroid so she put me on levothyroxine and then erm and then i sort of on a hunch sort of say to her oh and i haven't have my blood pressure take for age and it turn out i have absolutely sky high blood pressure as well so they put me on drug for that and then as i go back to the doctor for checkups cos when they put you on levothyroxine they have to keep do blood test to work out if you're on the right level of of drug and to control your and bring your body up to the right level of kind of metabolism and then also erm with my blood pressure i be go cos i didn't get on with the drug so i be be test for different drug to try and control my blood pressure and every time i go back i say to her you know i'm still bleed and she would say oh that's really really strange that that should have be sort out by now so she be really definitely pin my bleed onto my thyroid problem and it be only after about eighteen months that she say i think you'd better see a gynaecologist and then i i get and send up to and they do er er a scrape so just erm stick a a oh a a a kind of swab i suppose through my cervix and into my womb and just take a swab of the line of my womb and then erm about a week later i get a call say you'd better come to the hospital this afternoon please so it be it be a very very simple test for endometriosis and actually it can't cost that much because it's just as long as they can get their little through your cervix
S0646	yeah
S0282	which they can't always
S0646	and and do we know why they don't do that when they be do cervical screen test why do they not do that at the same time
S0282	i don't know well it's just it's like breast cancer isn't it like if you say as a women and you've get cancer people go oh be it breast cancer because there's so much awareness of breast cancer and there's also a lot of awareness of cervical cancer i mean i know
S0646	yeah
S0282	you know
S0646	and they have all these check all the time
S0282	yeah and i but you know you've get anomalies like people like jade goody who manage to not ever have a well i don't know i think she be possibly too young to have smear but you know that you still get people who be not go for their smear test
S0646	no
S0282	but but the awareness
S0646	but i mean while you're do that here
S0282	be so much higher
S0646	you're not actually test for the endometrial
S0282	no because you
S0646	cancer be you you're
S0282	no
S0646	the so that and it wouldn't require a great deal more cos you be put the whatever they call that this thing up and take a swab
S0282	yeah
S0646	so actually why not take a swab of the endometrial i don't know
S0282	i don't know i mean i think it be a bite it er some people can't take it some people have get such a tight cervix that they can't get their little tube up there
S0646	yeah
S0282	erm and other people erm and it do actually hurt it feel like
S0646	yeah
S0282	you're be stab
S0646	yeah
S0282	in the cervix so erm and i er probably a lot of women would just say oh no you've get to stop it's just too painful so
S0646	oh well maybe they don't want to do it because they think that would put women off have the
S0282	yeah
S0646	cervical test
S0282	yeah
S0646	i mean
S0282	but then also
S0646	and
S0282	i i don't know what the prevalence of the different cancers be whether my i don't know this might be completely uninformed but my hunch be that there's more women around with cervical cancer
S0646	sure yeah i'm sure that's right
S0282	than there be with endometrial cancer
S0646	yeah
S0282	and and also my hunch and and also this gynaecological support group that i'm in the older women seem to have ovarian cancer and the younger women seem to have cervical cancer
S0646	yeah
S0282	so i don't know whether there's a kind of shift in the pattern of cancer or oh i don't know whether it's about awareness campaign and there just be more awareness of cervical cancer now which mean that it look like there be more people suffer but it's really that more people and
S0646	who be come forward
S0282	no er
S0646	i mean
S0282	come forward
S0646	and to follow your story right through but you know just to pause on the screen bite cos that's something i think be really important and i've work in screen so i have some understand of how it work but erm but screen program be decide on or not accord to whether as a population whether they do more good than harm
S0282	mm
S0646	and the harm can be get false erm read that look positive
S0282	yeah
S0646	or send people off for treatments they don't need
S0282	yeah
S0646	and so
S0282	as with prostate
S0646	there be a little risk thing so i do respect that er and i know there be a study er go on at the moment about look at erm more screen for gynae cancers erm but what i kind of feel be that if if ovarian cancer and and these other cancers gynae cancers don't meet that threshold you still do have an opportunity where women come regularly hopefully most of them to do the cervical smear test
S0282	mm
S0646	and at the very least it seem to me one could be provide those women with information about the other cancers and say to them
S0282	yes
S0646	this be what the symptoms would look like if
S0282	yeah
S0646	you have those symptoms do not be afraid to to go to your erm you know to ask your gp erm don't be put off by the language thing and ask for these particular test so
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know erm in the case of ovarian cancer erm the first test would be a blood test call ca125
S0282	mm
S0646	now that's not an expensive thing to do
S0282	oh isn't it
S0646	gps be do all gps do blood test all the time it's just
S0282	yeah
S0646	one more
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know parameter that you can ask for
S0282	and that's the and that's the test for
S0646	and so that
S0282	for endometrial as well
S0646	right so
S0282	yeah
S0646	i mean those test be not you know difficult
S0282	no
S0646	for gps to organise in any way and then obviously if that come back it's it's indicative but not diagnostic so that
S0282	yeah
S0646	we have to send people off for other test but you know what i'm try to say be i think that you know you have a captive audience
S0282	yeah
S0646	of people and you be talk about gynae cancers at that point and yet no conversation be have about these other test and er just because there isn't a full on national screen programme erm do that mean we can't even mention them or raise awareness or give people a leaflet or at least make them aware
S0282	mm
S0646	er and you know it seem to be that's an absolutely ideal opportunity to do that with
S0282	it would
S0646	along with other er ad hoc interventions that they might have with their gp which might be around hrt treatment erm in the case of ovarian cos it tend to be more older people but could be around family plan
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know just so it's people should know what the symptoms be
S0282	well no absolutely
S0646	and and we should follow your story and then i'll say a bite about kind of the normal symptoms of have ovarian cancer
S0282	well i mean i be gonna comment on that because erm when i be in my er when i be about thirty my next door neighbour die of ovarian cancer and she be a erm she be quite a challenge woman cos she be really highly string and really nervous and she she do panic she have a sort of quite a lot of ocd and and she be always on edge about stuff and really sort of erm a bite kind of i be to use a very non pc word really neurotic about stuff and she have have symptoms for years and years and years and it turn out to be ovarian cancer and she have be dismiss by her doctor as just be a hysterical woman
S0646	yeah
S0282	with these sort of er these symptoms which be be say by them or interpret by them to be a sign of her neuroticism and and her borderline sort of hysteria but when the fact that her get to stage four ovarian cancer without be diagnose so by the time she be diagnose she be she'd have it she be do for erm and you know so this be actually this be actually bloody scary stuff because everybody know with breast cancer you look for a lump and and everybody be sort of they ask you have you be look for lump you know when be the last time you examine your breast you you go and have a smear for cervical cancer i have no idea to until recently that there be such a thing as cancer of the vulva or cancer of the vagina and actually that make my blood run cold because i you know to this day i don't even know what the symptoms of those be erm you know although i do know what the symptoms of ovarian cancer be but come back to my previous theme about go to your doctor it's one of the kind of things that you go to a doctor about and they think oh well that could be anything and it's probably ibs it's probably
S0646	irritable bowel syndrome
S0282	yeah
S0646	yeah
S0282	erm or it's you know some some woman at her time of life just be you know like god know what they think but erm but the symptoms be not definitive enough that a doctor have alarm bell go oh my god must get a blood test must send them off to a doctor must send them for an ultrasound
S0646	yeah
S0282	et cetera so it i mean it seem to be the doctor be very be scientists and they're very practical people and so i think my the doctor i go to see that i go to see because she say i've get a
S0282	specialism in gynae stuff erm i think she look and think fifty two the odds be that it's x and y but you know the chance of it be cancer be you know one in twenty or something so therefore i'm not even gonna go down that avenue i'm gonna follow the most logical explanation of these symptoms
S0646	yeah
S0282	so
S0646	it's actually funnily enough mine actually to their credit do the absolute opposite
S0282	oh really
S0646	she say to me cos i go in and say with bleed persistent bleed and and she say well let's get the nasty scary things out of the picture first and then we'll
S0282	oh
S0646	see if it's something simple
S0282	yeah
S0646	so she do actually on my first visit erm
S0282	wow
S0646	send me off to the hospital
S0282	and how do
S0646	and get
S0282	and what what's the what's diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer
S0646	well i mean mine be not usual er the the normal erm symptoms of ovarian cancer be feel of be intolerably bloat
S0282	mm
S0646	because what happen be the the erm er the the body create a lot of fluids in the
S0282	oh really
S0646	abdominal area so people do get very very bloat sometimes they can have like litres and litres and litres of this fluid which have to be drain off and
S0282	right
S0646	cos that's the normal symptoms but my symptom actually be like yours be bleed which again be confuse for everybody cos i have erm i have just come off hrt treatment
S0282	mm
S0646	and so i think oh well maybe it's just erm you know residual normal menopausal
S0282	ah yeah
S0646	erm so you know i wasn't that concern about it and i i have a cervical cancer screen test speak to the nurse and say you know should i be worry about this she say oh well you know if it doesn't go away in a few weeks go back to the doctor
S0282	mm
S0646	and you know and it eventually you know you know i think well it hasn't go away so i will erm and to her credit she do yeah start with the kind of nuclear option first
S0282	right
S0646	but she might well not have do
S0282	yeah
S0646	and and and it and then come back to the thing about what oncologists say to your a gp it be only much later on kind of right almost at the end of the cancer treatment that she she put something in the letter to the gp which suggest that it have actually go into the fallopian tube and it be because it be in the fallopian tube that i get bleed
S0282	oh right
S0646	but that be sort of lucky for me that it be
S0282	oh my word
S0646	cos otherwise cos i hadn't get any of this bloat
S0282	no
S0646	and i felt perfectly well you know i be i be try to be very fit i go run every day swim you know i be one of these kind of not a fitness fanatic but i do do exercise every day and i felt
S0282	mm
S0646	perfectly fine so you know it these cancers can be the result of
S0282	yeah
S0646	but i think one other thing be you know if if a woman know that one of the key indicators be just this blood test i mean often the doctor will be do blood test for other stuff i mean you know when you first go there and they do your thyroid test
S0282	yeah
S0646	they could actually have just tick another box which
S0282	yeah
S0646	would have be
S0282	yeah
S0646	ca125
S0282	yeah
S0646	and you might as well find this out
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know eighteen months earlier
S0282	yeah
S0646	so if if women know that that be that test exist they could just say well look you know while we're about it why don't we just test that as well
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know and that could just be the thing that save their live because i know that that thing like seventy five percent of all women with ovarian cancer get diagnose at stage 3c
S0282	mm
S0646	now what that mean be that you know cancer be usually grade into four stag
S0282	yeah
S0646	one two three and four erm four be when it's really you know a a pretty tough call and it's go
S0282	yeah
S0646	everywhere in your body
S0282	yeah
S0646	three be when it's spread somewhere else
S0282	yeah
S0646	erm so 3c be not fantastic but
S0282	no
S0646	the one of the one of the reason why the cancer outcome statistics be not great for ovarian cancer be that everyone be find so late
S0282	i know
S0646	erm so you know it have spread by that by the time you get that bloat you know it it's spread
S0282	yeah
S0646	so there be no lump to feel so it's all so i think you know the message be you know rather that your doctor might be a bite irritate and you just ask for the ca125 blood test which after all be not that as expensive for the nhs but
S0282	well i don't know you but be
S0646	not that that's a totally diagnostic device
S0282	no
S0646	i should say that you know not every ovarian cancer will be show by that test and i think that's one of the reason why a lot of these screen decisions be complicate
S0282	yeah
S0646	erm like you know if you just do that test it wouldn't necessarily pick up everything so that you know i think it's a very complicate area all this where
S0282	mm
S0646	have to be very finely calibrate and
S0282	but i think they're not
S0646	indeed they be in breast i mean and breast cancer have be very controversial because you know an awful lot of women end up get er breast surgery for things that might never have turn into cancer but you can't know one way or the other so it's
S0282	yeah
S0646	it you know it's always that balance and so i do respect the sort of academic process that that they use but sometimes i think you also have to be pragmatic and say well look the more women understand what kinds of cancer there be and what kind of cancers do not have obviously lump that you can feel
S0282	yeah
S0646	and what kind of test it might be reasonable for them to ask for at least have the discussion with your doctor you know and you don't want to raise panic amongst people but at the same time you know there's a real issue of late diagnosis
S0282	yeah well absolutely i mean i i when i be twenty five i think i find a lump in my breast and it be quite a hard one and it wasn't it it wasn't a cyst it be erm turn out to be a fibroadenoma but i be in hospital have it remove within within the month and it be only recently that i think oh my god they think it be a cancer didn't they because otherwise i wouldn't have be whip into hospital and have this lump remove
S0646	yeah
S0282	you know then er then and there erm but erm so erm i er the i at the time i suppose i be a bite bemuse about why they'd want to take it why they'd want to take it out i don't think i ever stop to think about why do they want to take it out but i'm quite relieve they do
S0646	yeah
S0282	and and that i get that attention
S0646	do you think you be in denial at the time that
S0282	no it just never cross my mind no because actually what be really strange be that i think that there's probably a genetic component in my cancer because i think my grandmother have endometrial cancer
S0646	right
S0282	erm or possibly ovarian cancer erm years and years and years ago erm and but i have never it have never cross my mind that i might get cancer because my mother go around say there isn't cancer in our family nobody in our family have get cancer erm never hear of anybody have cancer erm and so therefore i er i have kind of on some real subliminal level think i'm not i'm not go to get cancer i'm not gonna be prone to cancer i don't know why i would have swallow that message whole it seem to me that i suppose that there be some logic in that that if nobody in the family have ever have cancer then obviously there isn't a a kind of genetic component in our family like the bra gene or what
S0646	brca yeah
S0282	gene the brca gene whatever so erm i suppose i just have this sort of whole sense of security about it but
S0646	but
S0282	actually an even falser because actually my grandmother almost certainly have erm a gynaecological cancer and i don't think she be ever even tell that she do because and and when i say to my mother and my my it's my father's mother and i say to my father and my mother oh well of course nan have a hysterectomy and they say no she didn't and i say she do and they say no she didn't and i say you know what i'm pretty sure she do and they say no no we can't remember that speak to my uncles who also say no i can't remember her have a a a hysterectomy and then and i say say not only do she have a hysterectomy but they treat her with with radium rods which be put into her vagina and she have to lie in bed for five days with radium rods in her vagina without move and they say you've make that up that's a load of old twaddle that never happen and i think to myself do you know what i'm so convince it happen but they be convince equally that it hadn't and the only way that it turn out that i be right in the end be because i've get a diary of hers just happen to have a diary of hers for that year which talk about the whole process
S0646	wow
S0282	and until they saw their diary somehow it have go right over their head
S0646	so have they have they not be tell or have they be tell but just be in denial
S0282	i don't
S0646	or
S0282	absolutely don't know but i i
S0646	how
S0282	really don't think they tell her because
S0282	i think she she be kind of quite a nervy high string person who be always a bite hypochondriac and she never sort of go round in her later life say oh well i wonder if it's cancer erm or i'm really scar of have cancer again or something like when through all the symptoms she have when she be a ninety she do live till ninety three so obviously they catch it in time and they put it right but erm so there be hope at least
S0646	yeah yeah
S0282	but erm erm but erm i don't i don't think that they could ever have tell her what what
S0646	what yeah
S0282	what it be
S0646	strange well i mean guess that's another whole issue isn't it about how people be tell and
S0282	yeah
S0646	how much they're tell and er you know how much one choose to ask erm and the first thing i realise be that they say here's your macmillan nurse and i think ah okay it's cancer then before they say the word cancer
S0282	yeah
S0646	erm that's how i know it be
S0282	oh gosh and then so what happen you go you have you go for a scan
S0646	i well i have so yes i have er first of all i have an ultrasound scan
S0282	mm
S0646	and then erm they do that co125 test to corroborate it and at that point it be pretty the two of them so a lump and this raise level of co125 so that be pretty certain that it be and erm i mean it be i think that it be at that point that they introduce the macmillan nurse i'm kind of try to remember now exactly but erm and this be all it be a bite of a horrendous thing because i be due to have go off with my choir on a tour which i have spend the year
S0282	oh no
S0646	organise so
S0282	yeah
S0646	i get this on a thursday and we be mean to be set off with my choir on saturday er to my house in in france for a tour that and i have organise er and we have all the kind of venues book and the ticket and you know everybody else it complicate holiday and book around it so i say ah you know i i i need to go away next week and they say well look okay go away but you know it be mean to be a three week holiday erm but you know do your choir tour then and you must come back erm and so so it be a very strange choir tour i be sort of do all this sing and think oh my goodness i'm go back to so what i go back to then be a erm they do a ct biopsy a ct
S0282	uhu
S0646	guide biopsy so they put you under a ct scanner
S0282	mm
S0646	and they extract a tiny bite erm yeah of the tumour erm sort of guide by the ct scan so they can see where they're
S0282	yeah
S0646	get it from erm and so that that come back erm and and another thing perhaps it's helpful to say be that when i get that er they say oh yes it's a very aggressive form of cancer and i think that can be a scary thing to hear but what
S0282	yeah
S0646	they say be that actually paradoxically erm aggressive cancers can be the ones that react best to chemotherapy because what a chemotherapy be do be address rapidly divide cells
S0282	yeah
S0646	so if you have a cancer that have rapidly divide cells ie it's aggressive erm chemotherapy sometimes work better with those ones
S0282	oh right
S0646	than the ones that be slower burners and and i would see if i would be able able to tell that to another friend of mine who be just tell it's an aggressive form of cancer without have that extra bite
S0282	yeah
S0646	so i mean to me that extra bite be really kind of the difference between it be awful news and it be
S0282	yeah
S0646	sort of here's the good news and here's the bad news sort of thing
S0282	yeah
S0646	so erm so that be kind of it's kind of a helpful thing for people to know i think
S0282	yeah
S0646	so erm yeah so that's how i get diagnose and i i be very lucky that you know although it be still stage 3c you know if because i wasn't have any pain or symptoms you know if i have wait until i have get that i might well have be stage four and
S0282	yeah
S0646	incurable and erm er so mine have go and rather unusually to my lymph nod and when they first say it to me before the choir and tell me that oh well it might be lymphoma or it might be ovarian cancer or it could be both
S0282	oh that's a
S0646	come back in a week
S0282	oh
S0646	so erm
S0282	scary
S0646	and so yeah erm but it it's nice to know that actually on the twenty ninth of november erm that that's the actual anniversary of me have the seven hours of surgery and be like in hospital for six weeks
S0282	oh what
S0646	with post you know post er complications on that day this year one year on i shall be sing bach and handel and purcell in so that's just be
S0282	that's brilliant
S0646	like the most brilliant
S0282	cos that be brilliant
S0646	kind of
S0282	that be brilliant
S0646	life affirm omen really
S0282	yeah no i guess i'm about yes er they operate on me in about mid november as well
S0646	so i mean go back to your your
S0282	but a couple of years further back
S0646	diagnosis and everything
S0282	mm
S0646	so be it you know do you wanna just say a little bite more about what endometrial cancer be and
S0282	well erm i i suppose it's erm it's cancer of the line of the womb so it's not necessarily in the wall of your womb it's in the line so the first time i talk to the consultant about it i say well you know perhaps it's like have woodworm
S0282	you know and you've get but you know you've just get woodworm in the floorboards it hasn't get into the joists yet and it hasn't get into the wall and it hasn't get into the roof and he sort of say yes i suppose that you know i suppose that's a definition of stage one but you know actually it's just still contain in that
S0646	yeah
S0282	in that area and hasn't get out and spread and in fact mine have erm and that be a function of the fact that it wasn't diagnose for eighteen months because erm in fact a friend of mine who have a hysterectomy because she'd have a bad childbirth experience they sort of say oh you've get stage one er you know or you've get precancerous cells inside your uterus erm so but they didn't give her any treatment because it be still really really
S0646	no
S0282	localise erm so erm but mine i think that i have probably or things have probably make my life slightly more complicate because erm we have be try for a baby and we be go to this clinic where we weren't have we weren't actually have ivf but we be have kind of assist conception and as part of that they inject some colour fluid into my womb to see if there be a free flow of this and then they have they do an ultrasound to see if the fluid kind of flow up through my uterus and into my fallopian tube and come out of the end of my fallopian tube
S0646	okay
S0282	to see if the reason i wasn't conceive be because i have a blockage
S0646	right
S0282	and the egg weren't travel down my fallopian tube now in retrospect i think the reason why they then find little drift of cancer cells up my fallopian tube in one of my ovaries and down around the outside of the exterior of my uterus be because that process have send cells
S0646	oh my god so they sort of flush them round
S0282	i think they i think that possibly they yeah sort of endometrial cells have be flush out of my or through my fallopian tube and outside into my abdominal cavity
S0646	oh how terribly ironic
S0282	and then either they be cancerous at the time and it be a very very slow cancer and they just sit there quietly without give me any symptoms for a couple of years or on the other hand they be ordinary cells and they be perfectly fine and then when something in my genes kind of click over and they decide that they be go to be cancerous they all start play you know
S0646	yeah
S0282	cancerous little game all at once in their various little locations i'm not sure which way round it be but erm but you know i suppose it be i have have an ultrasound erm when my periods start get bad and when i start have pain and the the radiologist have say say oh don't worry you've get fibroids but there's nothing more sinister there well erm endometrial cancer doesn't show up as a tumour or a lump and so you don't have a tell tale lump as you would in breast cancer
S0646	no
S0282	erm and
S0646	or even in ovarian cancer actually
S0282	right
S0646	with ovarian cancer
S0282	yes i suppose you could have a localise lump
S0646	you you probably if you think of it
S0282	yeah yeah yeah
S0646	if you see see the lump
S0282	oh right
S0646	in erm when you have
S0282	yeah
S0646	have an ultrasound and you do feel the lump yeah
S0282	so now i find it a bite weird when i go back for checkups and they're sort of look they sort of get down and look at assess my tummy to see if there's any sort of lump and bump on it and i think well there be never a lump in the first place i don't know would there be a lump now i'm not sure whether there would be a lump now to this day
S0646	yeah
S0282	but but anyway but so there's no lump to look at and there's no lump to feel and actually if they send you for an ultrasound that doesn't tell you whether you've get endometrial cancer because
S0646	yeah
S0282	actually if they can be just sit there look perfectly innocent when you scan them but you know
S0646	yeah
S0282	they're not innocent at all
S0646	no so just to cut through that again so if if somebody have persistent bleed
S0282	mm
S0646	er and they have some reason you know they might have some reason to check out endometrial i can almost say it cancer the only way they would actually know that would be to scrape
S0282	yeah
S0646	the wall
S0282	yeah which be a kind of basic erm it's kind of like a d and c or the start of it if you have a d and c they
S0646	yeah
S0282	kind of put a a hollow tube up your cervix well actually you probably have a they probably inject your cervix to dilate your cervix if you if you go for day surgery and if you and actually have a miscarriage and they're try to deal with the aftermath of a a miscarriage they'll put this tube up with a with a kind of implement into it into your womb and then just sort of go round and sort of scrape the line so
S0646	right
S0282	if they're do that to see if you've get cancer cells up there it's just it's the work of what thirty second or something
S0646	oh really right
S0282	to get a to get a scrape as long as as long as
S0646	mm
S0282	you can cope with the the i i wouldn't say it be pain i don't know it's i wouldn't say it be pain so much as a kind of i don't know i suppose there's somebody sort of stick their thumb in you really hard you know it's that kind of pain it's a kind of sort of pain
S0646	yeah
S0282	but not a sharp kind of cut of a knife sort of pain
S0646	okay
S0282	so but i think erm they er a lot of a lot of women find that too too uncomfortable
S0646	yeah
S0282	i mean actually if you
S0646	well it's a very difficult one to diagnose though
S0282	yeah
S0646	endometrial
S0282	well if you've have erm if you've have a coil
S0646	yeah
S0282	it's easier cos you've have that before so you'd know exactly what you're in for in term of discomfort cos
S0646	yeah
S0282	they have to in the same way that they put a they put a hollow tube through your cervix and then they pop the coil through the tube
S0646	yeah
S0282	and then it pop out and open up like an umbrella inside you so if you've have that you wouldn't you wouldn't have the problem with
S0646	yeah
S0282	have a scrape really
S0646	okay but it's it's a more tricky one to find then cos there's not even a lump if you're have an ultrasound
S0282	no
S0646	like you would still have this co125
S0282	yeah
S0646	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0646	which would indicate
S0282	yeah
S0646	but if you have raise co125 but no lump through an ultrasound then you should be say could it be this
S0282	yeah yeah
S0646	to your doctor
S0282	yeah
S0646	and ask for that scrape
S0282	yeah
S0646	okay
S0282	and you can have a local and you can have a and you can have a general i mean and
S0646	yeah
S0282	you know if they in fact actually
S0646	do you just have a local anaesthetic
S0282	no no just
S0646	just do it
S0282	do it then and there and go from there be the the registrar
S0646	you didn't have any at all
S0282	no no they just say
S0282	hop up here and this might hurt and and then you know within five minutes it be all do and dust and get send away and then you know a week later as i say they call me back to hospital i have to say the way he tell me be absolutely appal
S0646	oh really
S0282	there be this this consultant i'd never see before who get wheel into the room and there be a student who be obviously there to hear how to tell a patient they've get cancer there be a registrar who obviously be just they be just the gynae the gynae guy so mostly they be deal with pregnancies and miscarriages and stuff and not with cancer so they be all beside themselves and didn't know what to do about it and didn't know what to say so they just tell me and then we all just star at each other and then i have to go away for a month and wait for them to tell me how bad it be
S0646	a month why
S0282	er because it take a month for the result to come back
S0646	oh my goodness
S0282	cos the i have to go for a ct scan and then an mri scan and whatever before before they erm you know sort of decide they as i say they you know it could have be just the equivalent of woodworm in the floorboards
S0646	gosh that must must have be agonisingly worry have that long wait i mean i as for me i mean the first the the equivalent i have i suppose of er erm when i first saw the oncologist cos erm they kind of have a whole team of people say would i like to be involve in research but it be like there there seem to be a room full of people there must have be some be
S0646	shadow the oncologist and there be lot of people from the research project and there be the macmillan nurse and i can't even remember there be quite a lot of people and me and the oncologist who i've never meet before and she start off with
S0282	and be you on your own
S0646	i be that day actually i don't know
S0282	oh no
S0646	quite why
S0282	oh god
S0646	anyway erm erm she say well look erm one third of people die straightaway er one third of people erm die kind sort of in the treatment somehow and a third of people get well five years run and it it be like my god you know it be like really desperately awful
S0282	that be brutal
S0646	and it and she just come out with that in front of all these people that i didn't know at all
S0282	god that's brutal
S0646	and and and i think oh great you know thank you know erm so if one i think the the correct statistic be one third of people die straightaway
S0282	do that sort of that echo in your brain
S0646	oh god yeah you know one third of people erm die within five years and one third of people last beyond or something like that so it's it's er you know it's kind of two thirds of them die before the you know
S0282	oh
S0646	five years but it's you know awful statistics and and erm and of course you have to you know when you when you will have that you do have to do a bite of reality check that actually all this data doesn't relate to you know the past and how things be and it probably be improve all the time erm and you know the sort of there be other factor in that
S0282	yeah
S0646	like the age of the person
S0282	yeah
S0646	how fit they be and what but anyway
S0282	and my husband
S0646	so so be tell that
S0282	yeah
S0646	be the like in when i then have to keep it together because that be the meet in which they be gonna explain whether or not i should do this research and
S0646	and erm and
S0646	and i be try to take in all the detail of the research project and the treatment options and you know once i'd hear that i didn't really get much further than oh my god i'm gonna be dead
S0282	no well quite what else do you hear i mean
S0282	i can't er i can't understand what else you would hear even after that have be say to you i mean i just i i put my head very very firmly in the sand say to me the statistics be irrelevant actually cos you be not a statistic and the statistics no matter what the statistics say that doesn't necessarily affect you
S0646	yeah
S0282	so erm
S0646	but of course everyone will say that
S0282	yeah
S0646	and you you kind of
S0282	yeah
S0646	erm the i mean i think i think there's a kind of pragmatic middle way between
S0282	yeah
S0646	sort of erm of be aware of the statistics but at the same time you know not get completely bogged down in them cos you know
S0282	yeah
S0646	er every person be unique and everybody but every journey be unique and some people who have stage four go on to live and some people who be stage one go on to die and you know so you can't
S0282	yeah
S0646	but
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know once you've hear then you can't un hear
S0282	no no i mean it make a lot of difference that where if you know there be stag significant and the aggressiveness be be significant obviously i mean mine because mine have leave my erm womb and have get out it be stage three and i realise it be stage three when i saw the consultant the surgeon i saw him write stage three upside down on his note
S0646	right
S0282	so erm so and i just think oh i oh erm you know because i have be hop and hop that up to that point that they would say look you know it's just confine it's fine but it have get out and get round a bite but not into my lymph glands so
S0646	yeah
S0282	but you know er i didn't know what to do about my doctor afterwards because i just think you know what a few months more and it would have be in my lymph glands and it would have be you know proportionately hugely more serious erm and so it take me a long time to get over be angry with her i be just so livid with her for such a long period of time
S0646	yeah
S0282	erm and i just think you careless bloody woman
S0646	yeah yeah
S0282	erm and you know especially when she have keep you know i be just on the verge of just not talk about it anymore and also the other thing i think that's quite important be that my mother have really bad really bad periods before she have her menopause the process of her menopause be be appal i mean she have appal bleed she have terrible pain she have flood you know it be you know she have a terrible time and other women i know have have a really bad time through menopause so when i felt i be have a bad time i just think you know what that's what women go through and it's menopause and you read stuff about menopause and you hear erm you know stories about people you're not you know you can't go anywhere and you can't do anything cos you're just bleed all the time all over the place and and i just sort of think well i'm in the bind of a normality and you know other women have have have have just this sort of thing and it's just be kind of normal
S0646	yeah
S0282	for their age and and so erm and so i i keep think to myself you know do i complain about it perhaps i shouldn't complain about it perhaps you know the doctor's sort of thing oh yeah yeah you and a thousand others yeah yeah
S0646	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0282	get over it sort of thing erm so i i don't know whether you know you i i mean once when i have a miscarriage and i we go to erm a and e and i overhear one young doctor say to another young doctor well you know they always exaggerate how much they've be bleed and it's not you know ever as bad as they say it be you know and you'd sort of think oh well you know okay blood make a mess doesn't it so you know a a tablespoon of blood be actually quite a lot of blood
S0646	yeah
S0282	to clear up you know and it make quite a big splash as it be erm but you know so i keep think to myself perhaps i'm perhaps i'm overreact perhaps you know
S0646	yeah
S0282	this really be within the bound of normality and i shouldn't be whinging so much about it
S0646	yeah yeah i think i think a lot of people be put off
S0282	yeah
S0646	go to their gp for that especially as we know how busy gps be and
S0282	yes
S0646	you know you can see they're under great pressure and
S0282	yeah
S0646	and erm you know er and we're all er unsure and so on i mean i suppose i all i can say be i think that educate people about symptoms
S0282	yeah
S0646	and just be aware that you can just try to sort of you know get some reality check for yourself as to
S0282	yeah
S0646	whether things you know if things go on and on be be wrong
S0282	yes
S0646	erm and if they follow you know a pattern that you've read about you know then you shouldn't feel it's unreasonable to take their time i mean it's a perfectly reasonable thing to to say you know
S0282	yeah
S0646	it it it isn't a and to persist if you don't feel well like i say there's the like the thyroid thing which you know be a perfectly reasonable you know intervention because of the fact that you do have a thyroid problem
S0282	yeah
S0646	so it wasn't an unreasonable
S0282	no no no
S0646	intervention
S0282	no no that you get but you know to just have that confidence that that you know just cos you've get one thing that's be diagnose correctly doesn't mean you might not have another parallel set of
S0282	absolutely
S0646	that have be miss
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know so just to have that confidence to to pursue it with your with your gp
S0282	but to this day i couldn't tell you what the symptoms of vulvas of cancer of the vulva be or cancer of the vagina i have i have and i almost don't dare dare to look them up really i mean the
S0646	yeah
S0282	you know erm cervical cancer erm well we have smear so we don't have to worry so we have smear so that's fine breast cancer we know about erm you be suppose to examine your breast but the other ones they be just they really be hide aren't they they're
S0646	yeah
S0282	so hide
S0646	they be absolutely hide yeah
S0282	and actually i mean the other thing as well that erm there be another survey which be do by the ovarian cancer action about outcomes for women after have gynaecological cancers in term of the continuation of their sex live and erm there be something on woman's hour about it erm last year and erm and and actually when blokes have prostate cancer a lot of attention be pay to their continuance of their erectile function and whether they you know be incontinent and stuff like this erm but you know there's people talk about their libido and you know their sex live and and it's actively part of their treatment to talk about this and to counsel men about this but there isn't
S0646	no
S0282	in parallel er conversations with women about the more the general issue about how a do you be you be be you a real woman if you haven't get your bits anymore do you still feel attractive as a woman of a certain age and you're kind of you know you're not attract attention from men anymore perhaps your look be go off or whatever you've certainly get physical problems of various kinds erm and now actually you've have surgery so you feel kind of maim in
S0646	well you be maim
S0282	a way you be maim by the surgery
S0646	yeah
S0282	erm and so you be you know in one in one respect of be a woman redundant erm and then actually because you haven't get the hormones anymore there be all kinds of difficult consequences of not have oestrogen in your body erm and then what's more your sex life go up the spout because you know erm because of all those previous factor include the fact that you haven't get oestrogen and progesterone anymore erm and so you know just do people talk to us about this no they bloody don't actually
S0646	no they don't they don't erm
S0282	be that a boy come in for
S0646	it's isn't a boy
S0282	oh right
S0646	erm erm
S0282	oh we've
S0646	well how many
S0282	we've get six five minutes to go before we before we've do the hour so if we could just do
S0646	okay
S0282	five minutes more and then
S0646	okay erm yeah i mean i think that be a huge issue and i suppose i think a lot of people feel they've just get to be so grateful that they're here on the planet
S0282	yeah
S0646	at all
S0282	yeah
S0646	that all those other things just kind of you know they can't whine about those things because they're just quite glad that they're here at all
S0282	yeah
S0646	on the planet and so unless but i kind of do somewhat feel that erm
S0282	but then on the other hand you see
S0646	but but but
S0282	i my husband's younger than me he's only in his forties and even if for myself i think well you know well you know you know i can cope i mean i can't i can't say to my husband that's that's the end of the line for him and he's not even hit fifty yet
S0646	no no no but that i i think that i i i think the point of raise the point about it not be talk about be an important point and i think it's a
S0282	yeah
S0646	really hard point erm the er i mean there must be that kind of yeah it's something i totally struggle with i mean i've basically struggle with it because i also do ivf before unsuccessfully and so for myself from that point wasn't really a real woman
S0282	mm
S0646	before i even get this erm and now i've get this and i've get a fuck great scar right through my pubic area right up to my breast bone you know and it it's not attractive it just be not you know and erm and i think that be very hard yeah er er so i don't have any sort of easy thing to say about it other than to say yes i think it's probably be something we probably should give women the opportunity to talk about
S0282	perhaps we need but do you have when you be young cos i think we're kind of more or less the same age do you ever have a copy of our body ourselves
S0646	er no
S0282	didn't you it be the most amaze american publication i think by a an american feminist and in fact actually in a way it be really bad news to me because they have a real thing about women be give hysterectomies for no good reason and how it's men want to kind of cut of women's bits because they be jealous of them et cetera so they be like really hysterically against people have erm hysterectomies and so on the basis of this i turn down the opportunity of explore have a hysterectomy for quite for a while during all of this process but but the one thing it do do it have diagram of your body name for all the bits an analysis of the kind of the things that women get plus the symptoms plus kind of conversations with women about how they felt about these things plus you know kind of quite intimate things about sex and body and stuff like that and it be a great big tome and they do and it be sort of publish in the seventies and it be kind of quite a radical piece of pro really erm possibly read back on it not as medically inform or sensible as it as it might have be but on the other hand you know a real good medical handbook for women's problems
S0646	yeah
S0282	which i do get an update version of many years later but i wonder if there's you know might even be a role for kind of republish it or
S0646	yeah
S0282	reimagining it with with this kind of information in it for women so not just about
S0646	interest cos your age there must be all kinds of interest ways that you could do that actually
S0282	yeah and i mean i read when i be have when i start get well when my periods start get peculiar i buy a book call be it the perimenopause which be a book all about what symptoms you would get you know in the years lead up to menopause erm which be actually very useful but then describe as be normal symptoms of menopause some of some of the symptoms i be have they're cos i've get cancer you know so therefore
S0646	yeah
S0282	again you know erm i wasn't get the full picture and i probably wasn't as alarm as i should have be and i wasn't as aeriated as i should have be and i wasn't as insistent with my doctor as i should have be cos i think oh this be still par for the course
S0646	yeah yeah
S0282	it's what you get when you're fifty you know and you know what what again come back to your point what be normal what be abnormal if you've get a symptom how long should you leave it
S0646	yeah
S0282	before you go to and say to somebody this be not right
S0646	yeah yeah
S0282	so oh god it do make you right i mean it make me frighten in
S0646	you can probably
S0282	retrospect actually
S0646	end this conversation by
S0282	yeah
S0646	just say that kind of on a more upbeat note
S0282	yeah
S0646	at the moment both of us be in remission
S0282	yeah
S0646	and erm you know and i suppose the other kind of big message i have erm for the nhs be that or one of the most important things be radical surgery and have erm the opportunity to have that
S0282	yeah
S0646	and one of the most poignant stories that i have hear be that a person i know who who be give erm an operative an operative slot of two and a half hours and she be take down to surgery and they have they have only have two and a half hours and there be still cancer leave inside her and they be oblige to sew her back up again leave it there and
S0282	oh
S0646	er whereas as i and this you know er and i be just appal that that be do to her
S0282	yeah
S0646	er whereas i have seven hours of exploratory surgery and they just go at it just as long as it
S0282	yeah
S0646	take them to take everything out and
S0282	yeah
S0646	lymph nod and you know that that be the single most important bite of treatment
S0282	yeah
S0646	all the chemotherapy be be really precautionary to
S0282	yeah
S0646	wash up any other cells that might be hang around but
S0282	yeah
S0646	the treatment be the surgery
S0282	yeah
S0646	and and and you
S0282	if it offend me pluck it out
S0646	you yeah exactly and and i think that you know er how ridiculously short sight of the nhs to to to compromise on that because all that happen to that woman be she then obviously come back
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know cos it then recur and now she's you know have this i think this er the drug avastin which be consider
S0282	oh
S0646	and you know and if if they'd actually do the surgery properly in the first place
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know that would have be more effective it would have save her life and it would have save
S0282	yeah
S0646	them a great deal of time and energy and money and
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know so i mean i'm a very passionate believer that you know erm women have a you know a a right to have this and it more radical surgery
S0282	yeah
S0646	and one of the reason why these figure have actually improve somewhat on ovarian cancer be that they've you know they do now try this much more radical approach to
S0282	yeah
S0646	to the surgery to get everything out whereas before they do routinely leave little bits in and it only one cell
S0282	oh yeah no
S0646	it it will go back again and you think well why on earth
S0282	yeah absolutely
S0646	do they ever leave a little bite in there it be seem mad really
S0282	well perhaps yeah perhaps there's a part
S0646	perhaps they be very difficult to get hold of and maybe they just didn't have the surgical skills i'm not sure but i mean that's a really important message that you know
S0282	yeah
S0646	to to know that actually you you know you er it's really important that the nhs do give that investment
S0282	yeah
S0646	to women
S0282	and perhaps
S0646	in the surgery in the first round and then maybe you've clear it
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know if you're lucky maybe you have you know
S0282	and perhaps women need to face up to the fact that perhaps they will need a hysterectomy and that it might be the norm to have a hysterectomy in the end and actually in a lot of ways i'm really glad it's all go really be glad
S0646	yeah
S0282	i mean i never get on with it for the whole of my life anyway particularly
S0646	mm so be i
S0282	it be always on a different page to me so actually the fact that it's go and it's all be whip away be like wahey you know
S0646	yeah well i mean it's funny how
S0282	relief
S0646	your attitude change cos er erm my sister's be delightfully put that you in the pelvic area
S0646	and erm
S0646	and i've think you know i think kind of that er when i get the menopause it would be some awful rite of passage cos i'd have ivf unsuccessfully you know and blah blah blah but i actually when i do get to that point i think well you know i i've get beyond all that i'm not go to you know i do adopt a a baby so i be lucky and that have be hugely fulfil and so you know that's what i do instead and
S0282	yeah
S0646	there be other ways of get a child and erm erm so then you know i've build it up in my mind as be you know it would be this enormous like you know psychological thing but actually do you know it wasn't
S0282	no
S0646	and and similarly to you i think you know actually erm because i wasn't go to have a baby at this point anyhow
S0282	yeah
S0646	you know i i don't feel especially you sort of sentimental about all these bits i feel god if well if that's my ticket to life get on with it and take it out
S0282	yeah yeah
S0646	just get rid it
S0282	get it put it in the bin
S0646	you know and er put it in the bin
S0282	yeah
S0646	and so erm you know i think i didn't feel sentimental about these bits i think you know er when it come to life or death you know there's no you've just gotta go for life
S0282	oh yeah absolutely gosh that
