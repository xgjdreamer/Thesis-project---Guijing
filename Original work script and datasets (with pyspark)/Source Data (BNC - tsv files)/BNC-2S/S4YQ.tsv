S0253	i don't mind do that i don't know why but understand why you wouldn't enjoy do that not enjoy
S0254	why you dislike it
S0253	yeah why that's it why that would be like a job that you wouldn't do
S0254	yeah
S0253	cos to me it seem like really straightforward and it's not time consume
S0254	i don't like it it's always just a faff and the bag rip and whatever and it stink and take it outside
S0253	that's why you invest in decent bin bag and then
S0254	i know i think they be the same ones as we buy last time but they're obviously not cos they're crap
S0253	yeah
S0254	what they do really hate do
S0253	it's not there's no one job i don't like do for me it's more a case of like i hate i hate not feel like i've get the energy to do things cos i like do them i like get things do i like tidy and i like clean and i like everything be nice you know
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's crap but i hate when i feel like i've not get the energy or the time
S0254	yeah
S0253	to do stuff which i don't like that that's what really bother me i don't like that feel of there'd be like wash up to do but i just feel like i'm too drain to do it
S0254	mm
S0253	awful at the moment yeah what about you
S0254	erm
S0253	what's your least favourite job
S0254	yeah definitely the bin
S0253	that's not a job
S0254	wash up don't like wash up i don't mind wash up clean stuff but i hate
S0253	no one mind that
S0254	you know like if there's not much on it it's just like you know barely any you know like knives and fork or a plate that you've eat all the food off so it's pretty clean
S0253	yeah
S0254	or it's like scrap but i hate clean can and like dish that you've put in the oven that you've put stuff in
S0253	yeah but that's exactly the type of thing you always do and then you leave it cos you don't want to do it and then you make it and you'll be like make this squid carbonara in this dish it's pretty bake on
S0254	a hundred dish
S0253	you'll have to really get your fingernails in there if you wanna get that
S0254	that's what i hate
S0253	that squid off
S0254	that's why i'd rather've throw that pan away than pick the scuz in it and clean it
S0253	that be fine after like
S0254	be it
S0253	it take me about five minutes to do
S0254	really
S0253	you just have to get at it but yeah i know
S0254	those two that i've leave to soak but i've do your dad's trick of leave them upside down and i'll do them before work tomorrow
S0253	yeah you're think you've discover gravity dad be like
S0254	think like
S0253	but isn't it strange i know it sound stupid
S0254	never hear of it but it really do work
S0253	but when you think about i know it sound really stupid
S0254	but yeah make perfect sense
S0253	when you think about like the force of gravity act on anything
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's gotta go down eventually
S0254	yeah
S0253	i don't know what though cos when he tell me that i be like don't be daft and i think i'd eat a bowl of weetabix which go like concrete
S0254	yeah weld a house together with it
S0253	i think i'd like leave it in my room for like two days and then it be like you know proper rock rock solid to the bowl like it be like a big glass crockery bowl
S0254	i'd have about eight weetabix
S0253	i use to love do that erm
S0254	weetabix
S0253	and then i get enough to satisfy my
S0254	satisfy your crave all that milk's get to be eat eat drink
S0253	drink erm and yeah and he's like i think he be really annoy at me and he's like here you be soak the sink get a bite of soap around the inside of it soften it up next day it be like it'd be in the dishwasher it be amaze
S0254	that's good
S0253	yeah what be this bloody advert it's like golf ball
S0254	face look like a golf ball
S0253	be your face like a golf ball
S0254	use this make up and pout lot
S0253	this be crazy have i see what this this rachel riley advert do you know it's illegal to for celebrities to say things that be scientifically untrue i'm not sure whether it's just to do with health i think teeth might be okay cos she she's say like toothpaste as if it like it's become sentient like hello i've notice cavities in your mouth and when you see that advert
S0254	i haven't really take much notice of it to be honest
S0253	it's like toothpaste with smart technology and it adapt
S0254	that's ridiculous
S0253	it's insane isn't it it's like the most nonsensical thing you've hear from an advert well not ever but apparently
S0254	it's a skechers
S0253	they mean to like improve your
S0254	there just like the world's most comfy shoe apparently but they look hideous
S0253	yeah
S0254	mum and dads get a match pair they've get his and hers sketchers
S0253	yeah
S0254	totally sad
S0253	and she be like she's try to adapt she's try to do it as it adapt to your mouth and it's like the most ridiculous thing and then i read this thing that apparently there be a sport player who say that it be like there's a pill that like block the fat absorption by your body
S0254	oh yeah
S0253	and that go to court and things like that but apparently you're not allow to it's not true it's just not true
S0254	adi osals or something
S0253	there's these like fat pills this be years ago but he be like an amazingly bad baseball player and he be like come out with this he be on an advert and yeah you know he help me keep the weight of it just categorically untrue but apparently it's illegal or against advertise regulations for that to happen so there must be ways round it like
S0254	yeah there must be there must be like certain phrase
S0253	it's not to do with like cosmetics cos on cosmetics advert you see fake eyelashes and stuff
S0254	come out with all sort of rubbish on make up advert
S0253	yeah
S0254	the eu have ban certain hoover
S0253	cos their energy consumption
S0254	yeah you can't have a certain wattage of
S0253	yeah
S0254	hoover and now they're think of bring it in with hair dryers and stuff like that
S0253	be it your mum say that like she be say how you never think of it with hoover you just leave it run don't you like
S0254	yeah yeah those energy save things
S0253	equivalent to leave a tap on isn't it like even worse
S0254	money just go down the drain
S0253	yeah
S0254	literally
S0253	yeah but no i don't like like i think i think when you're live with someone should divide i think you have to divide labour normally it just work out but if one person be do everything and one person's do nothing i think that's quite bad
S0254	yeah and i don't mind and i think we kind of do it in quite a nice way when one of us be have a particularly crappy week the other one will step up and do a bite more and i sort of like that rather than this be your job you always do this it's like we both do everything and sometimes we do a little bite more or less depend on our feel
S0253	yeah
S0254	but i quite like that
S0253	yeah
S0254	i don't feel like cook be my job and i have to do it
S0253	i know occasionally make sandwich for me but i couldn't stand it if i be like make sandwich i just think that would be horrible i just don't know it's weird or like where's my tea
S0254	yeah i've get your dinner on the table for when you come in be awful wouldn't it what i don't know i like you like make tea and tidy up and stuff but i think i feel guilty
S0253	why
S0254	cos i feel like you always have lot more to do than me
S0253	i haven't really i've not
S0254	just feel like i should do it because i have my even and you don't
S0253	to be honest i mean maybe that be like true a few months ago but now like i really don't have much to do like tonight i just print some stuff off and that be it it be really
S0254	yeah
S0253	i can't think of the last time i spend a couple of weeks ago i spend a couple of hours do work like in an even i've just be i wouldn't say lazy but i've just start to rest on my laurels a bite
S0254	yeah i think you deserve to like that's the bonus of you know have work somewhere so long and put in the time in previously then you can reap the reward of that
S0253	yeah i don't know i feel but it's kind of bore me cos i'm use the same stuff again and again so i kind of need to kind of shake up my own lessons
S0254	yeah
S0253	think i'm go to watch a bite of thank you for smoke do like a lesson on advertise or something
S0254	that's a good idea
S0253	it's a bite more interest isn't it
S0254	yeah definitely
S0253	do we go to the cinema to see that
S0254	do we go to the fact
S0253	i think we do
S0254	i think we do yeah good film i haven't be to the picture for age not much on really summer's always be a bite of a
S0253	bite of a weird one isn't it cos
S0254	a down time
S0253	i think there be loadsa good film at the start of this year there be like load of brilliant film and then
S0254	do you watch this with me the other day
S0253	i think i think this be on tv last night be you the burger king advert with richard blackwood
S0254	richard blackwood who's he
S0253	do you remember who richard blackwood be
S0254	no
S0253	he be a presenter for mtv and he's i dunno he he's i
S0253	i really like him he be when i he be on like this show call trl which be call total request live do you remember that
S0254	no
S0253	and it be
S0254	i never use to have sky or mtv or anything like that
S0253	it be on mtv and it be basically like erm in the state it be quite famous and it be in it be i think it be in like madison square garden where the studio be or something and people would stand outside outside a glass window all day and then have celebrities on and then they'd play music videos and people would call in and request
S0253	just erm like that very sort of late nineties early
S0254	yeah
S0253	millennia and then erm and then we have
S0254	mm
S0253	it over here i think it be trl and he host it and i remember it be er be really funny but and he be kind of tip for big things and then he do like and then he have this single and it get to like number three in the chart and it be like you know he be establish himself
S0254	yeah
S0253	and his and then i dunno what happen i i i have to read up on him yesterday cos i i saw him on a burger king advert and i be a bite annoy
S0254	it's like what be you do there
S0253	but he literally disappear and he's not like a celebrity that have like a drug scandal or have like you know any kind of scandal really it be basically a series of like just poor decisions like by his management or something like that so
S0254	oh that's just that's sad
S0253	he he have his er his er so he have like his number three single and then it be like number twenty three
S0254	huh
S0253	then it be number forty five like his his third track off the album the album bomb
S0254	oh
S0253	and then he do and then he do some tv show and i think it i think it's what happen sometimes be like when you're in tv it's like say you're on huh say you say take like jon richardson for example who have probably gain a lot of popularity from this show
S0254	yeah
S0253	then he'll probably get offer to do like you know a like his own talk show or something like that eventually but
S0254	oh god
S0253	you've get to cos if they go badly then you're kind of in trouble
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's like alex zane you know like that guy who host rude tube
S0254	oh yeah
S0253	he be everywhere years ago like he be all like all over like
S0254	yeah
S0253	every channel 4 show every mtv show
S0254	yeah he be
S0253	and now he just host rude tube
S0254	yeah
S0253	which be quite bad
S0254	quite poorly mm
S0253	but erm and i think that's what happen really i think he just kind of accept what like you know there be a show and it be call like the richard blackwood show and it be on like maybe like friday or saturday night and it be mean to be light entertainment a bite like
S0254	mm
S0253	tfi friday or something like that
S0254	yeah
S0253	or like the saturday night project and it just be terrible apparently and er it er and then after that he just disappear
S0254	mm
S0253	like he couldn't get a job apparently his last job before the burger king advert be in erm shrek the musical as donkey
S0254	that's eddie oh shrek the musical
S0253	yeah
S0254	yeah that's not a bad job
S0253	it's not but it's not you know
S0254	it's not very it's not movies and tv
S0253	do you think he's

S0254	yeah yeah
S0253	no one would notice you take a puff of it it's not

S0253	they're like
S0254	they do don't they they're the weirdest thing
S0253	they they they er light up and bubble
S0254	but i suppose they be really aren't they in a way i know there's no tobacco but er it
S0253	it's kinda what it's kinda what it's kinda what they're it's kinda what they're do isn't it
S0254	it's kind of the same sort of
S0253	the same
S0254	yeah
S0253	yeah but i mean
S0254	have you see that shop on that's er er the e cigarette shop
S0253	there's loadsa them there's one in manchester it's like a bloody market it's like the
S0254	really
S0253	the i don't get i don't i dunno
S0254	there be someone at erm the car boot it be like a whole e cigarette stall i be like number one where do you get where do you get all those things from and secondly why would i buy an e cigarette from a guy in a football car park
S0253	where oh in
S0254	yeah
S0253	that's er del trotter
S0254	exactly like that
S0253	from a mush in shepherd bush
S0254	someone erm me and mum where do i know you when i have my erm only fool and horse erm
S0253	alarm clock
S0254	alarm clock
S0253	no i just no maybe you do i think i think when i first come round to your house i think i saw it
S0253	yeah
S0254	and it's like rodney rodney rodney wake up you dipstick
S0253	i never stay over at that point so
S0254	no er i'd probably stop use it as an actual alarm clock by that point
S0253	yeah it be cool though
S0254	but erm yeah we sell that at the car boot sale and there be sort of a
S0253	bite of bite of
S0254	weird kind of irony yeah
S0253	bite of bite of an irony there
S0254	me and mum be laugh
S0253	yeah
S0254	cos it be work as well we make sure it be work and then put it on the thing and some guy buy it and er and he be like oh do it work and i be like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah press the button and it didn't work and i be like oh no it do work honestly
S0253	how much do you sell it for
S0254	er one pound fifty i think
S0253	you're joke they be like thirty quid then i remember them be in the
S0254	yeah i know
S0253	i remember them be in the argos catalogue in nineteen ninety six
S0254	christmas of ninety six
S0253	god i could i could draw you everything in that catalogue i just
S0254	oh i love that that's the thing about car boot sales like it be quite heartbreaking cos it's all the stuff that you use to like love and the stuff that you save up load of money for or the stuff that you beg for at christmas and now obviously you have no use for it you don't want it but the think that then somebody haggle from haggle you from a pound to fifty p and you're like when i buy that that be like thirty quid like we sell my two erm china dolls do you remember them
S0253	yeah they're terrify
S0254	yeah yeah quite creepy yeah but i have two and have one and like i beg and beg and beg for those china dolls for
S0253	they remind me of something
S0254	for age
S0253	like out of a goosebumps
S0254	i know they be creepy but i really like them and then i think i finally get them for my birthday off my nan or something
S0253	do you mean do you mean the one that's like in the cupboard
S0254	i sell it it's come back
S0253	it's in the cupboard
S0254	oh
S0253	open the cupboard the other day and it's head rotate
S0254	but yeah like i sell it to these two like i think they're maybe eastern european definitely anyway and we're like i be like three pound for the two of them and they're like mm oh no no i say two pound each and they say we'll give you three pound for the two of them and i be like for goodness sake they be so expensive when i buy then or get give them
S0253	but don't sell them then
S0254	yeah i know but you don't want them anymore
S0253	don't back down
S0254	do you
S0253	yeah but that's the point that's if you if you if you be basically wear a sign and you're at a significant disadvantage at haggle cos you're british and you're just too polite
S0254	yeah the thing with those car boot be that no one actually want anything so they'll be like how much do you want for this and you'll say two pound then they'll be like with you give us will you take a quid and then you say no it's two pound and they'll just put it down and walk away so then you end up go home with everything
S0253	but it's just not i mean it's you know it's just not part of our culture the idea of like bargain it's like when we be in china
S0254	no people do in car boot sales
S0253	yeah i'm sure they do but it's like shepherd just text me before i text him about turkey and cos he go there a lot and he say erm i don't know but i'll read you the text in a bite and tell you what he say but he say just a word of advice try not to be too don't be cos you say you will get people try to sell everything to you
S0254	oh yeah that's what my auntie say don't touch anything unless you're buy it
S0253	erm and he just say try to be a bite less english about things don't think that you owe just by virtue of be in a shop you owe them a sale and things like that
S0254	oh i'm not like that anyway
S0253	i be bloody hugh grant i'm so terribly confuse erm but you know i think with car boot sales i think if people know if people know that you if people know that you course you're die to get rid of it no one want crap in the house
S0254	yeah
S0253	then you know i think we're such a wasteful culture as well that we sort of become burden by the things we buy like property and all our crap and people know you want to get rid of it so people low ball you don't you
S0254	that's why
S0253	i think you if you just hang on a bite longer
S0254	i just don't think you would some stuff you know that people would want but like china dolls really who want then
S0253	especially haunt ones
S0254	exactly but then she get them and she stuff them into her ruck sack i be like be careful you're go to like smash her face
S0253	need to watch this episode of the american office where dwight he start off with a paper clip and he's like and there's a telescope someone's someone's sell a telescope that's just snap one of your ball
S0254	loom band things
S0253	yeah erm and he start off with like a paper clip and the schrutes be excellent hagglers by the end of the day i'll walk away with the most expensive item here so what he do be it's like a series of trade it's like you know he obviously use a bite of connive in place so it just kind of go from a paper clip to a candle a candle to what else like some crappy jewellery and he sort of play on people's sentiments to sell them everything and it's just really good and that's what i always think when you say to me that people really really low ball you for piece of crap like haggle over ten pence
S0254	yeah it's really ridiculous
S0253	but it's because i don't know maybe and then you say you saw something on another table didn't you what be it
S0254	a clock but then you just dunno sometimes i think like i'd rather just take it all to a charity shop cos probably charity shop sell it for more money but the i don't know if they'd sell half the crap they we actually sell i don't know
S0253	you read about people who throw change away
S0254	yeah
S0253	they literally throw money in the bin
S0254	yeah
S0253	as oppose to metaphorically throw in the bin can you throw money in the bin metaphorically
S0254	like money go down the drain
S0253	that's the one but erm yeah like i think that's the thing we just
S0254	actually that's why i'd like to go to a car boot sale if we like buy a house or something or you be furnish somewhere i would like to go to a car boot sale to be on the other end cos sometimes people do get rid of half decent stuff and i suppose then when people know it's half decent they're like yeah i dunno maybe i'm just rubbish at it cos we're keen to get rid of stuff but
S0253	need to do some nlp something like that and get rid of negotiations
S0254	yeah laugh
S0253	find if you don't want it you don't want it be able to know
S0254	yeah
S0253	that's what nlp's for isn't it
S0254	i dunno
S0253	that's what they use it
S0254	linguistic program
S0253	linguistic program isn't it like to tune into people's body language on a really like terrify level i'm always confuse cos people always talk about nlp
S0254	i don't know what i think it be it's always groupon vouchers for it cos it's probably like some assertiveness train or something
S0253	i read a book in waterstones and it be i'm sure it be like nlp in business and it be it's basically about how to negotiate with people and how to form in a very strange way quite a robotic way how to form better business relationships with people basically if people seem a bite stand offish you're tune into this so you can make the right move and say the right things that would kind of warm them up yeah the day you need a book to tell you how to read people
S0254	stupid eh
S0253	yeah erm car boot sales be not not be not will never be my
S0254	your forte
S0253	not my interest at all
S0254	yeah that's
S0253	do you think he just retry off the profit from this
S0254	uh yeah well he's big in korea hasn't he
S0253	yeah i think so
S0254	so he's probably still do stuff oh my god
S0253	yeah
S0254	oh sexism casual sexism how hilarious i've ask about this website it's like i've hear of the woman the hairdresser mention it it's like you know how like pinterest have load of stuff on it that people have make doesn't necessarily tell you how to make it there's a website that tell you exactly how to make all the stuff that's on pinterest

S0254	do seem waste of money so what do you pay at the moment like sixteen pound
S0253	no i think i'm be it always work out about twenty one pound a month and i usually go over my data by a little bite so it might cost me like two pound in data but it's always the same
S0254	like twenty four
S0253	yeah say an average of twenty four pound a month
S0254	so be the twenty four pound one they offer be with a gig of
S0253	no it be a four s but that be with a five hundred meg and five hundred minutes
S0254	be that more than what you get now
S0253	no i get like something a gig of data and unlimited minutes and i'm just not use to worry about how many minutes you use but you just
S0254	i mean do you make that many phone call now
S0253	i do have other friends
S0254	no i know not that you use to ring
S0253	i don't like texted people so i always ring them
S0254	yeah that's air enough
S0253	i just don't hate texting people i can't stand it it take so long to explain something really simple
S0254	erm oh yeah iphone four sixteen gig in white gold hundred and twenty five pound
S0253	white gold oh they make some crappy
S0254	do they
S0253	alright you don't have to shop for me it's what my mum would do be you possibly look to buy something soon cos i can go on the internet and research it for you
S0254	i just think while i'm on here that liverpool
S0253	gumtree
S0254	no this be preloved com
S0253	i'm alright for now
S0254	hundred pound
S0253	i know i'm attach to it most of the time but i just don't care about mobile phone
S0254	yeah ninety pound phone charger this be as far as i can see be just haven for thieve
S0253	why
S0254	cos it's like if you nick a phone just put it on this website and you get like a hundred quid for it
S0253	ebay
S0254	well yeah i suppose the only deal it
S0253	you know and not only that like you sort of get rid of it you're get money it's not as
S0254	yeah
S0253	the person receive it have no i mean i guess they in a way cos not only receive steal steal goods be a crime
S0254	but yeah how would you know
S0253	the point be
S0254	the idea be you wouldn't have a charger would you
S0253	you could say it be misrepresent you know it be represent as a new it's a not like run into a pub and say do you want to buy a watch and like dance until you buy it it's you know its basic case of like here's a picture of a phone that look like a billion others that be produce with it you know and that's the thing there's no culpability then for people buy steal goods cos how be they to know they're steal oh well on the website they say it be fine
S0254	yeah
S0253	whereas when it happen face to face
S0254	you'd be suspicious if it didn't have a charger wouldn't you
S0253	happen to me remember
S0254	buy a phone without a charger
S0253	pay about i tell you this like
S0254	yeah
S0253	my old samsung i just receive it it do come in a box though which be good
S0254	oh yeah
S0253	but i think he must have have to source the box from somewhere but that be just well dodgy
S0254	yeah
S0253	i don't know and it take about three weeks to arrive so presumably they have to
S0254	steal it to order
S0253	i don't know what happen there but i pay well over the odds for it i think
S0254	say when you buy it i be like why on earth do you do that
S0253	cos i just want the same phone i didn't want like i like that phone
S0254	similarity here
S0253	what
S0254	i like my phone i don't wanna change my phone i think i might just buy it off a website
S0253	but i just i don't know like
S0254	just don't like change
S0253	for all the bell and whistle that all mine's get the only thing decent about my phone be spotify
S0254	yeah
S0253	that's the best thing
S0254	but you can get that on like a samsung or
S0253	but i don't want wait i just don't want a phone that's
S0254	the size of your head
S0253	yeah have like a big flat screen like little pocket life organiser that's like
S0254	an iphone be that
S0253	but they're all like that offer general advice day to day
S0254	yeah but he must set that up surely
S0253	hello have you
S0254	have you today it's like that film creepy
S0253	that's what i really want to see apparently it's really good
S0254	be it
S0253	poignant
S0254	scarlett johansson
S0253	certainly be
S0254	that's why you want to see it
S0253	it's not she's not in it
S0254	sexy voice
S0253	she's not actually in it at any point it's just joaquin phoenix but erm yeah it's dead weird what be it tell him to do the other day
S0254	have you eat your five a day
S0253	you can get apps to do stuff like that but honestly iphones be like be like in your league ahead of the competition cos they've get the sort of the components down really well i've have that phone three years
S0254	yeah
S0253	i mean okay i've drop it and smash the screen but other than that i mean that's a decent bite of kit really they're just quality products i guess
S0254	yeah
S0253	but i think the assumption be with other phone just it could be me but i've never know anyone to have like a software problem with an iphone or like an internal problem it's always like they're drop them
S0254	yeah
S0253	or get whereas like samsungs always seem to have like little
S0254	glitches
S0253	little glitches but you know 's be amaze it's like it just really beautiful the screen like you it's really really posh
S0254	hd and
S0253	yeah but i just think the more pretty and twiddly it be the more you're gonna be incline to whip it out every five second
S0254	yeah more likely it be for someone to nick it
S0253	yeah
S0254	mm
S0253	i don't know like i feel more like i dunno like i think lately they've be talk more about crime and i feel really like sort of nervous
S0254	what we have
S0253	yeah well like i be talk who be talk to the other day about like get bag snatch
S0254	oh me
S0253	you and then i be talk i can't remember i be talk to someone else about it and people keep tell me things you know and it be like oh yeah and saw get his bike rob
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's not that you become i'm not more afraid of crime or anything like that you're just aware of how casually how at ease you be when you be in surround your own and your comfort zone
S0254	yeah
S0253	like i kind of think of my little between here and work my little place
S0254	yeah familiarity
S0253	but it's not be it
S0254	nope
S0253	belong to a lot of people
S0254	yeah
S0253	but you just don't think that like you know you be say that one in asda
S0254	yeah
S0253	asda's not somewhere i think i'd get rob
S0254	yeah i mean you wander around in a world of your own in asda and you can see exactly what have happen like they'd probably leave their handbag on the side of the trolley and just nip off slightly away from their trolley to just grab something
S0253	yeah
S0254	and he's just stick his hand in and just pinch
S0253	yeah
S0254	pinch her purse
S0253	it's quite funny though cos i think i guess not be a thief you wouldn't if i saw someone do that i probably wouldn't think in asda i wouldn't think that stupid nor would i think i'm go to rob it cos it's just not in my mind
S0254	no course not i probably would think you should be careful with that
S0253	yeah
S0254	but i don't know yeah you could probably do that load of time and be okay couldn't you
S0253	yeah see if you walk around town with like or sit in a cafe with macbooks
S0254	yeah
S0253	you're essentially walk around with
S0254	a thousand pound
S0253	some of them be more some of the macbooks proper macbooks be fifteen hundred quid and you just that's everyone its not like it's something that nobody would notice and nobody would know the value of
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's so simple to just to like
S0254	everyone know a macbook be worth a lot
S0253	yeah but it's so easy again in a smaller city to feel at home and so oh i've only gotta walk to the cash machine yeah it just i never know where de montfort be
S0254	yeah i don't know if i do i know it be kind of round that way
S0253	kind of pointless this question like can you name two universities in leicester
S0253	can help slimming as part of calorie control diet
S0254	calorie control diet
S0253	basically mean like
S0254	cos like mum's friend she use to take those tablets and she use to eat like chocolate cake and stuff and she use to like completely mess her body up because you're not you're like those things stop your body from erm take in the fat don't they stop your body from digest the fat so you're not suppose to eat any fat high calorie stuff cos if you do it just give you the come straight out and it make you really ill
S0253	it's so weird
S0254	nasty
S0253	yeah i sort of really i don't know my metabolism will change in a few years but
S0254	yeah
S0253	i sort of feel really grateful i don't have to it's not like i don't have to worry about what i eat it will become more of an issue but it i'm just glad its never be there something that's always be in the back of my mind
S0254	battle with it
S0253	i've get lot of friends who just feel like not in a bad way i never really like i've question what i've eat cos it's disgust in a doner kebab but like a doner meat on a pizza i've question the health problems of it
S0254	yeah
S0253	but you know never be like kind of oh i'm scar i'll either put weight on or i'll have to balance it out with something else i feel really very grateful for that
S0254	yeah
S0253	my mums still go to that thing
S0254	oh be she good how's she find it
S0253	erm
S0254	do you say she be ache the other day
S0253	she be ache but that's only a good thing isn't it
S0254	yeah definitely i mean she's do it right
S0253	i'm really tough with give it up immediately never go back but i think she know how important it be
S0254	yeah do good
S0253	yeah
S0254	have she say much about it like there's many people in her class what they do or
S0253	no i need to properly speak to her about it really yeah i just think it's brilliant
S0254	yeah
S0253	what be you say before about those e cigarettes like that's what you be say the other day but for them i'm not sure my parent would've quit smoke
S0254	they've do so well
S0253	yeah well
S0254	feel like they've make load of lifestyle change since you've move out i sort of think
S0253	stress of live with me
S0254	no no no you can nag at people can't you and like tell them to do more of this don't eat that and stuff and it come from a really good place and you don't mean it to sound naggy but then when you're not there any it's almost like you're not go to do that cos they're tell me to do it all the time
S0253	yeah
S0254	and then when you're suddenly not there tell them everyday it's kinda sink in now and they've do something about it
S0253	i think that's like i think that's with a lot of things i feel like when someone tell you to do something come part of your routine you won't do it
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's only and then it's once that person leave you to your own devices you realise the benefit of them
S0254	yeah
S0253	whereas if someone's nag you you get annoy with that person all you think they're tell me to do this cos they're a pain in the arse
S0254	yeah
S0253	rather than like they you know this will benefit me
S0254	yeah
S0253	that's definitely my mindset i think i never listen to advice until like
S0254	your own advice
S0253	and then once i can kind of say under my own volition
S0254	yeah
S0253	but erm yeah they have they've do quite well so they so though i mean they talk about the shop the other day and the freezer they've get two freezers and they're both full
S0254	yeah
S0253	and then do like oh we've get to go to aldi and i didn't say anything i be like oh fair enough and then dad be like we have to though cos we've get two freezers full of food but what it be because they will cook they will eat the most quickest most convenient things first you know things that take like things that you actually move from one place to another
S0254	put the on a bake tray
S0253	but even like freeze food that take a bite longer they're not interest in and i be just sort say about you and how good you be at you know just make the best of what you've get
S0254	that's from my nan
S0253	yeah
S0254	she use to make something with everything she'd save like the tiniest bite of leave overs and make stuff
S0253	make a lobby i bet your lobby be like
S0254	lobby she use to like you know when you just have a few peas at the bottom of buy freeze peas or freeze veg
S0253	yeah
S0254	you know you don't wanna use you end up with a little bite at the end cos it's not enough for one person but it would have be too much to so you end up with a little bite she use to save all of those bits at the bottom of the bag and when she'd have enough she use to make a soup out of it
S0253	go away
S0254	it's just like
S0253	how'd you make a soup out of
S0254	i don't know out of freeze veg i don't know but she do but she'd like never ever waste anything
S0253	yeah
S0254	and it's just because you know she have eight people to fee and like she be bring up on ration and
S0253	bacon oh rashers
S0254	wartime ration you know and she have eight people
S0253	that's the term isn't it ration ration of bacon
S0254	and she have eight people to fee and they didn't have much money so everything you know she use to have to make stuff go far and go you know never ever any any waste ever
S0253	that's good
S0254	whereas like my other nan's like let it rot in the freezer it's fine oh
S0253	if the police would've raid your nan's i think they would think she's murder someone and put them in the freezer it's just like joint tail
S0254	i wonder if the next door cat go
S0253	yeah
S0254	oh no i speak to her before i be like dad get there safe she's like cool thank for let me know
S0253	she fret about him
S0254	erm she seem okay actually take her out in the wheelchair today
S0253	who's
S0254	my cousin
S0253	you have a cousin call
S0254	yeah you know auntie
S0253	yes
S0254	she's get three children and
S0253	how old be they
S0254	be thirty nine still live at home never have a girlfriend erm
S0253	bet he's amaze at like computer game though
S0254	yeah he love computer game
S0253	really i be just mess be he actually
S0254	yeah erm
S0253	all the clichés
S0254	and then be the youngest who have the baby at sixteen
S0253	yeah
S0254	and then be kind of like the normal one with a psychology degree be a social worker in bristol
S0253	it's mad how kid can go in so many different ways isn't it
S0254	yeah i mean i think get learn difficulties
S0253	right
S0254	erm
S0253	you have mention before have i meet him
S0254	might have do you will've do at christmas
S0253	that when i come round
S0254	when you come round to yeah but apart from that i don't see them i only see them at christmas but yeah he cos he doesn't get regular work he just do like garden like landscape erm
S0253	so what do you mean he's get learn difficulties
S0254	well it's never be diagnose but his like his writing's really bad he doesn't put capital letter on his name just stuff like that and like he's nearly forty and still live at home and
S0253	so he's get like dyspraxia or something
S0254	yeah i think that's what probably dyslexia there and i think i dunno i don't really know what it be i don't think there be anything major it just seem like kind of a mild learn difficulty but
S0253	do dyslexia like obviously it impair your linguistic abilities
S0254	er dyslexia
S0253	yeah
S0254	no it's just your erm write
S0253	okay
S0254	and your read
S0253	but do it effect you in any other way
S0254	no don't think so
S0253	okay
S0254	just your perception of letter isn't it
S0253	so it's like
S0254	it's a really like
S0253	so it doesn't effect like your social skills or anything
S0254	no no no it's really specific thing dyslexia
S0253	i notice it more and more in my students but then it's obviously like it's i've start to like i have a dyslexic i think have a dyslexic student a while ago but it's not my place you know
S0254	no
S0253	can you imagine someone say to you your arabic lessons be go terribly why can't you write in perfect arabic script and it's
S0254	but it's not
S0253	it's not
S0254	unless they be arabic i suppose then that would be understandable
S0253	no
S0254	but if you're spanish and you're struggle and you get your bs and ds mix up there's no reason for that in term of broad language
S0253	well
S0254	cos they have bs and ds in spanish so
S0253	yeah but
S0254	you shouldn't get that confuse
S0253	but our print the way we pronounce word be so different to spanish and italian the way word be write in spanish be how they sound
S0254	yeah
S0253	whereas we have through cough enough
S0254	yeah but if people be just mix up their bs and ds and ps
S0253	that's that's when you notice it
S0254	that's like the obvious that's kind of the typical sign isn't it i'm sure there's load of other things
S0253	yeah like that be the thing it be basically with write it be honestly sometimes it be ds backwards and things like that and erm but that's i mean that's really not my place to say to them
S0254	no
S0253	cos i can't it's like you be say teachers aren't train to
S0254	they be
S0253	but in school it's like
S0254	yeah they can have a guess but it's still need to refer someone if you do ever get someone though you could cos it's stuff like read they struggle to read cos all the letter get blurry
S0253	yeah
S0254	and mix up
S0253	yeah
S0254	but print on different colour paper
S0253	well
S0254	help sort of like pink or blue or green
S0253	what i start do cos it happen where i felt maybe when i have less experience i would've notice it and probably think it be something to do with whatever i you might see someone for two weeks three weeks and then they disappear again so you never really know how they develop but there's this one guy in i just he be with us for a while so what i start to do be erm a lot of text like set text you can like like sort of grade read you can you can actually download from most publisher's websites in
S0254	yeah
S0253	like dyslexics friendly
S0254	oh
S0253	so like different colour bigger print larger print erm so we download as many of them as we could and we just buy some colour paper and green be mean to be good
S0254	yeah
S0253	like green paper and yellow paper apparently what's the worst one white on black's not the worst there's another combination of colour that make it really bad
S0254	don't know
S0253	but erm yeah so like we do that for them and stuff
S0254	that's good cos a lot of people who be dyslexic have colour overlay so they'll have like a green piece of acetate
S0253	yeah acetate
S0254	that they just lay over and then
S0253	my friend at school he be i mean must have have it quite bad erm so teachers use to write it on the board in green erm for him and the he erm use to have these glass and they be like you know like green lenses
S0254	oh
S0253	and they make like so when he be i think he use to wear them quite a lot cos they look quite cool well the matrix have just come out at the time so wear sort of black sunglasses dark dark almost sunglasses be pretty cool but he have to wear them like i think when we be younger we didn't really understand why
S0254	yeah
S0253	i get why he be wear but how they help but i understand it bite more now but must be so hard it's like both and be dyslexic
S0254	be they
S0253	yeah just you know in case it's clear to see this be someone who be really intelligent hold back by
S0254	yeah but their ability to read to write
S0253	such an avid reader though he read
S0254	that's really good
S0253	doesn't let anything out him off just read and read and read
S0254	that's good
S0253	suppose shouldn't take it for grant should you
S0254	definitely not
S0253	must be quite hard
S0254	definitely so it amaze me how specific some difficulties can be like specific part of your brain that do really specific things
S0253	yeah
S0254	and then like weird little things we can have er deficit in name something but you know what it be you just can't name it you can't see move picture or
S0253	yeah
S0254	like oliver sack type stuff
S0253	yeah it's erm it's hard to comprehend really but i suppose that's the brain for you isn't it so much go on well not in mind i'm tell but it make you wonder doesn't it like how at what point like what's the normal at what point do you stop see do you then take into account everyone's kind of sort of
S0254	variation
S0253	like linguistics some people just seem to be better some be better
S0254	yeah
S0253	numerically
S0254	and you have like a there's like a bell curve which be two standard deviations either side of the norm which be okay and if you're outside of two standard deviations then you're then it's like impair or you know you're class as have a difficulty that's how they cut it off cos obviously there be massive variation between people but it's how much be too much variation and too standard deviation
S0253	you know people say like i'm a maths person or i'm better at like number than i be with word
S0254	yeah
S0253	do you ever think it's just a reluctance to develop the other skill
S0254	yeah sometimes but i'm not i'm say i'm better with number than i be with word that's probably not true any more cos i haven't do maths for a long time but i prefer maths to like write essay
S0253	but you're really good at write though
S0254	don't really enjoy it i can write like a scientific report cos it's scientific and it's fact i don't like if you ask me to sit down and write a story it would be the most amateurish thing you've see any kind of like creative write
S0253	that doesn't stop everyone
S0254	or like an article or something i couldn't write anything like that i've try it's just really bore try to write for bps and it be just like that's really lame but then i think a lack of confidence be relate cos you do read some stuff and think like that's utter rubbish people submit it and it get publish but then i just think
S0253	there's obviously
S0254	rubbish cos people see my name against it
S0254	and a lot of like publications it's that thing between quality and content and sometimes the content's great it doesn't really matter how it's write hence the tabloid press like they get obviously i mean it doesn't mean how it come out if there's a juicy bite of fact or juicy bite of controversial information then you know often it just get put out regardless of you know the write but then sometimes you just feel it now cos i read so much more than i use to and i read a lot of different stuff i can really i'm not like you know i'm not very critical of it but i know when i've read something that i don't think be put together very well or i think it's really weirdly write like that you do become better at it
S0254	yeah
S0253	but to go i always say to myself oh number and things like that i guess if i sit down and try to do some maths it would be okay
S0254	yeah your mental arithmetic be better than mine
S0253	no it's not i see number as a series of block
S0254	yeah
S0253	and those fit together
S0254	well it's kind of it really
S0253	i don't know do you see that thing who be like a six year old maths genius how do you why be it you enjoy maths and he's like cos it just make sense
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's like i just don't understand maths on that level
S0254	yeah long
S0253	i love peep show i'm so glad it's on so what do we need to do tomorrow night
S0254	get an early finish tomorrow i've get erm assistance meet in to i get to have a little nose around
S0253	be that where all the assistants meet
S0254	all the assistants
S0253	in every work in every area of work
S0254	yeah
S0253	all the assistants

S0253	what's that mean the brown neck
S0254	like they've get their head really far up someone's bum so brown neck
S0253	ah i've never hear that
S0254	haven't you
S0253	that phrase about a brown neck
S0254	i think its maybe a brown
S0253	i think there's definitely a brown nose
S0254	brown neck
S0253	analogism michael scott erm definitely a brown nose i don't know what a brown neck be
