S0037	it's not montenegro it's some like really far away
S0084	monaco
S0037	hot no further like tropical sort of place
S0084	samoa
S0037	hm somewhere more like that
S0084	mozambique
S0037	mm mozambique mozambique yeah
S0084	mm
S0037	i think it be mozambique do they speak french there
S0084	yeah
S0037	yeah that's where she's go
S0084	tut oh
S0037	so because her boyfriend um be butterfly man
S0084	er er obviously yeah
S0037	yeah obviously um he do something about butterfly
S0084	as in he's half butterfly
S0037	i think he might be no i think he he do something about butterfly
S0084	tut do something about butterfly okay collect
S0037	um
S0084	lick
S0037	probably both no i think he work at the university in like the butterfly department or something
S0084	tut amaze
S0037	yeah so then they're go on this trip him and a
S0084	mm
S0037	few of his like people he work with but none of them speak french
S0084	oh right
S0037	but do so she manage to volunteer herself and like get herself
S0084	nice
S0037	onto this trip
S0084	so er be she just gonna have to take holiday from work
S0037	yeah i think so part holiday part unpaid leave it's depress to take
S0084	so how be it gonna be
S0037	it's like a month i think
S0084	yeah that'd have to be all your holiday wouldn't it
S0037	exactly it would be depress
S0084	oh
S0037	imagine in fact i think
S0084	although you do get to go to mozambique
S0037	i think i know yeah so that sound pretty nice better than cambridge well for a while not sure for like a whole month that'd be a bite
S0084	i think it it'd be such a culture shock
S0037	yeah but she like all that like mud and like tramp about and tut
S0084	perfect then in that case
S0037	she's not gonna be like oh i can't plug my hair straighteners in
S0037	or anything
S0084	yeah yeah
S0037	she's not really that sort of er person
S0084	i don't think she i don't think she need to worry about that
S0037	maybe i should invite consider that i do just live there
S0084	yeah er invite him down
S0037	do you think
S0084	yeah get him out of the house he'll probably be out of the house by the time he's get a chance to er reply
S0037	i know i'll be like send
S0037	and he'll be like he might not though but then the problem be though if i invite him down then i'll have to stay for all of the rest of my life
S0084	that's gonna make tomorrow er very difficult
S0037	yes i have to keep remind myself that like i do have to go to work tomorrow
S0084	be there a chance that you could work from home tomorrow
S0037	no
S0084	from home i mean
S0037	no chance
S0084	pass out oh
S0037	unless i ring in sick but that's just not really not really er doable
S0084	not for a hangover
S0037	no
S0084	don't listen tape
S0037	yes off the record
S0084	there's a lot of stuff that i wonder
S0037	i know
S0084	what have be record
S0037	well cos you forget after a while don't you like
S0084	you do forget yeah
S0037	for er for the first like five minutes you remember but then after that you're just like anyway guess what
S0084	yeah
S0037	but yeah
S0084	it's good it's a good little money spinner really
S0037	well what be you gonna spend your money on then your record money
S0084	um what be i gonna do um buy a barge
S0037	right
S0084	a dutch barge
S0037	uh huh
S0084	and i'm gonna buy it in holland
S0037	right
S0084	i've think it all out i've be do research
S0037	so that's a bite of a bite of a commute
S0084	no no no i'm gonna sail it back across the channel
S0037	excellent
S0084	there's er as far as i understand it there's only two flaw to the project
S0037	uh huh
S0084	i can't swim
S0037	right
S0084	and i can't sail
S0037	and both
S0037	canal boat aren't really fit for the sea
S0084	um they no they be cos my
S0037	really
S0084	my uncle's the one who put the idea in my brain cos i'd already say
S0037	really you can
S0084	i be gonna buy a barge and he say well buy one in holland because they're much cheaper and i say yeah but the problem be it's in holland and he say his friends buy one and sail it back across the channel it's only like sixty miles
S0037	right
S0084	it's all very doable my friend um tut be a social worker type person but he work for himself
S0037	uh huh
S0084	run a company that take on kid that have be expel from school
S0037	so you're gonna get some chavs
S0084	and he sail
S0037	to sail your
S0084	no no no no no
S0084	the chavs be not come on the barge he's come on the barge
S0084	he run excursions he use to be in the army
S0037	uh huh
S0084	to scare them into behave
S0037	right
S0084	it er sound quite
S0037	barge across the channel sound like
S0037	it's gonna work
S0084	well he's get er he's get a boat himself that he take them out on
S0037	oh right
S0084	and there's no time to play the big i be
S0037	yeah
S0084	which i think be what a lot of the er
S0037	yeah yeah
S0084	you know teenage boys be all about and er you can't
S0037	yeah
S0084	you can't really do that and he find it quite a good way of get the kid to just you know take a bite of a
S0037	have you broach this barge across the channel idea with him
S0084	yep he's up for it so i'm gonna see him next week
S0037	be you be serious
S0084	yeah no i be
S0037	er
S0084	deadly serious cos you can buy one for two grand
S0037	right
S0084	and here they're twenty
S0037	okay
S0084	so i buy one for myself sail it back
S0037	uh huh
S0084	that's mine although i probably should sell that one in order to finance the next one
S0037	right
S0084	and then the next one can be mine and then the third one will be er for sale so cos er cos really you can undercut the price here you could sell it for ten thousand or fifteen thousand and still make an eight thousand pound profit
S0037	okay um some interest ideas there
S0084	i mean er the barge that i do see when i research
S0037	mm
S0084	this weren't two grand
S0037	right
S0084	they be twenty seven euro twenty seven thousand euro
S0037	right so that's
S0084	so what i need to find out er from my uncle be whether this be realistic because he say his friends have do it so for me
S0037	can you really sail a barge across the english channel
S0084	i think you have to find out stuff like ship lanes et cetera cos you don't wanna end up er in the same lane as a bloody
S0037	p and o
S0084	ferry
S0037	no
S0037	but i mean like be it not too wavy hm
S0084	no i don't think so
S0037	mm
S0084	be it wavy it's only the channel
S0037	it's quite wavy
S0084	well if you think like as we know my geography's really good
S0037	yeah
S0084	so if you
S0037	oh here we go
S0084	if you think that this be the bottom of the uk
S0037	right
S0084	this be dover
S0037	er be it
S0084	yeah because that's kent
S0037	oh okay then right
S0084	so that's dover
S0037	uh huh
S0084	here's europe
S0037	uh huh
S0084	and then holland be like here isn't it
S0037	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0037	not too bad
S0084	success so it's actually only a case of that to that
S0037	yeah but
S0084	so it's in the straight isn't it as oppose to like be open sea
S0037	i think it be all
S0084	be my theory
S0037	kind of open sea
S0084	yeah it do need more research
S0037	it's not just like er do not it's not just like you know a small lake you know the channel's quite so would you sail it like round the i don't even know if you can sail it on the coast i don't even know if you're suppose to
S0084	you have to sail it into the rivers
S0037	right
S0084	so you'd have to like maybe you'd come in on the norfolk broads like go up the
S0037	okay
S0084	in so up the channel into the north sea and then leave
S0037	right well good luck with that
S0037	do send us a postcard
S0084	from rotterdam um it's
S0037	from hospital
S0084	isn't there an only fool and horse episode where they try to sail to holland
S0037	i think it might but if there isn't one
S0037	i think you've just
S0037	write a new one
S0084	uh
S0037	well it's an interest idea i like the premise i'm not sure about the practicalities
S0084	tut um what i need to ask myself be er if it's a good use of my er finance
S0037	uh huh
S0084	because also there's the plan to run away
S0037	yeah
S0084	which be always a viable plan
S0037	so hang on would you live on this barge
S0084	yeah
S0037	right
S0084	because what i'd quite like to do be do that and then if i do move away i've get something stable
S0037	you can just take it with you
S0084	like a i could take it with
S0084	probably not internationally not across the er
S0037	yeah across the atlantic
S0084	atlantic
S0037	get the barge involve
S0084	how i mean how many miles do you think that be
S0037	don't know
S0084	it's not like the pacific i mean that's doable i mean er it might take six hours to fly across it but yeah actually if it take six hours to fly across it it's probably quite far
S0037	mm it be quite far
S0084	yeah okay we won't take the barge to the state
S0037	no
S0084	maybe around africa
S0037	somali pirate
S0084	oh yeah no no that's not an option but you can go to europe
S0037	yeah
S0084	that'd be quite nice
S0037	do you not have to er get them ship on a bigger ship do the barge not have to go inside a bigger ship
S0084	um i suppose if you import it which be another viable option i could just buy a cheap one and get it import cos presumaby that'd still be cheaper if it be only two grand
S0037	could you not just pay for someone else to get it over here as in not like undertake this crazy let's go leave at the
S0037	at the channel mission
S0037	get to dover take a leave
S0037	and then we'll be at the norfolk broads
S0084	see you in a couple of days
S0037	i'll keep an eye out
S0084	um
S0037	for you
S0084	i'm pretty confident
S0037	yeah well it's always good to be confident
S0084	tut it's good to have a plan
S0037	yeah
S0084	tut i don't know if this be if this be an immediate plan
S0037	yeah
S0084	i mean um i need to capitalize on 's availability he's available at the moment tut so
S0037	why don't you like delegate it to him
S0084	tut well er we would go together and he would do the sail and i would do the direct
S0037	right
S0084	and er
S0037	now don't take this personally
S0037	but um
S0084	hey
S0037	know what i do about your navigational directional skills
S0084	yeah but if i have er
S0037	obviously you mean project direct the project not
S0084	direct the project
S0037	oh right that's better
S0084	not actually navigate
S0037	no
S0084	us across the channel
S0037	i see
S0084	because he very much know that that'd be um
S0037	yeah
S0084	a death sentence
S0037	turn leave yeah
S0084	turn leave
S0084	on the norfolk broads
S0037	your leave or my leave
S0037	oh that's funny but no i like the idea of like buy something cheap and sell it on for more
S0084	yeah yeah and i i just really like the idea of be on a barge the thing be i probably need to have a barge holiday because i've never actually be on a barge
S0037	no so before you er engage this barge plan
S0084	well i well the first one have to be for profit so the first one have to be sell on
S0037	yeah
S0084	so what i'll i'll have have a lot of experience in
S0084	sail the boat i won't be sail it
S0037	uh huh
S0084	in be sail in the boat
S0037	yeah
S0084	by back to the uk so we'll have probably have to live in it for like a week or however long it take to sail
S0037	do you like him enough to live in a boat a small boat with him for a week
S0084	well i do like him yeah we use to
S0037	yeah
S0084	date
S0037	yeah
S0084	a long it be a long time ago tut now he's just well a crazy head
S0037	be this just an elaborate ploy to
S0037	rekindle a relationship
S0084	but
S0037	involve twenty thousand pound holland
S0037	sail across the channel
S0037	in barge
S0084	um
S0037	cos if it be it's
S0084	it's a bite extreme
S0037	it's the latest in a long line of crazy
S0084	even by my standards they're er pretty intense
S0037	even by your standards
S0084	um no cos i really wouldn't have to go to that far
S0037	no i be gonna say
S0084	far
S0037	i'm sure you could just be like do you wanna go out for something to eat
S0084	do you wanna go out for dinner well we be next tuesday so
S0037	well there you go maybe
S0084	the barge idea the barge idea it come about before i think about him
S0037	uh huh
S0084	er the reason i invite him be because i know that he can sail and he's the only person i know that can
S0037	i see
S0084	sail
S0037	yeah
S0084	so that's why he's involve in the project
S0037	yeah
S0084	well you know the
S0037	yeah
S0084	embryonic stag of
S0037	of the project
S0084	tut yes
S0037	oh
S0084	so tut it's a plan
S0037	but if that all fall in
S0084	if that all fall apart um i dunno what i'm gonna do with the money well it's just nice to have pay off my overdraft like i'm back in it
S0037	yeah
S0084	a little bite now cos we're at the end of the month
S0037	yeah
S0084	but it's only a hundred quid so that's fine by the time i get pay and pay for the record that'll be it
S0037	yeah
S0084	overdraft go i'll keep it just for emergencies but generally won't be use it
S0037	yeah
S0084	so that's a really nice feel consider in january i think i'm never gonna be able to clear it
S0037	yeah yeah exactly and you be think like you oh be i gonna be able to pay this much and will i be able to
S0084	exactly
S0037	so
S0084	so
S0037	that's pretty good
S0084	so this month so for april i'll keep it in my account and then the payment that'll come in for may for the
S0037	yeah
S0084	april record i'll put in my save account for new york
S0037	mm
S0084	new york
S0037	oh your your tut for your birthday
S0084	yeah cos that's still the very loose plan but it's still the plan
S0037	yeah
S0084	it's certainly the plan that i've be tell everybody and maz be on board with it so it er my concern with it be if i decide to move away in march
S0037	yeah
S0084	that will take up quite a lot of the
S0037	yes
S0084	save so it's er er it's be i stay and in which case let's go to new york or be i off and in which case let's have a a bon voyage
S0037	yeah
S0084	more low key
S0037	yeah
S0084	for our thirtieth it'll be a bite of a it would be a bite of a mood killer if we do
S0037	but you would have a party here anyway wouldn't you i mean
S0084	we'd have a party um i'd get her to come here and we'd have a party
S0037	well you'd go out for some drink at some point er with the people that you know in cambridge er i mean me actually
S0037	let's be fair
S0084	just you me
S0037	i'm not sure i can
S0084	beer
S0037	make it to new york but er i'll certainly
S0084	but er well even if i do go to new york there'll
S0037	mm
S0084	definitely be birthday drink here
S0037	mm
S0084	because her birthday's november so we be think
S0037	yeah
S0084	we'd go like some time er end of november so yeah
S0037	oh that'll be lovely
S0084	certainly do something here i'd really like to go
S0037	i'll have to tell you some place to go you should go and see if you have a chance there's um there's like a gay venue thing call the bowery ballroom in new york
S0084	tut oh yeah
S0037	go to a gig there that be really good like just go and see anyone if they're on cos it's like use to be an old sort of like um it's like sort of really what i always think of as like really new yorky like it use to be like it's in this like weird bite of town like there's not really very much there
S0084	mm
S0037	but like obviously the subways just go anywhere everywhere so um and then it's like it use to be like a ballroom like where they use to have dance and stuff and so it's
S0084	nice
S0037	a really nice build
S0084	mm
S0037	and it's like um it's a bite like imagine if like a sort of smallish theatre but with all the seat strip out
S0084	mm
S0037	and so there's like a stage and it's get a kind of like dome sort of shape
S0084	oh okay
S0037	um and they have like band on all the
S0084	mm
S0037	but it's just good like i really enjoy it because it be good to just see like all the sort of cool kid you know
S0084	mm
S0037	like hipsters like big glass and like you know just
S0084	mismatch clothe
S0037	see what's you know grandad jumpers and that and and it be good to just see sort of what be happen
S0084	tut sound awesome that's er that's
S0037	so
S0084	that's the thing isn't it fit everything in
S0037	yeah it's really hard
S0084	cos we're only go for a few days that'll be the hardest thing
S0037	i'll have to try and find out where i go cos i have some good food and that while i be there
S0084	yep i er speak to julie today and she be say that actually she's not really be out and explore that much i think because she's be
S0037	oh

S0084	she really like it they move her out
S0037	yeah

S0037	yeah
S0084	and now she's back and from manufacture she's out there
S0037	mm
S0084	she's basically just manage to swing a job because she's now
S0037	yeah
S0084	because they've i dunno if you've hear about it but they've split the responsibilities of our manufacture department
S0037	oh right
S0084	so that half of them be in charge of stock level make sure there's always enough stock in the warehouse and order and
S0037	right
S0084	all that sort of business and half of them be involve in procurement so
S0037	mm
S0084	source paper and price and that sort of thing tut so split it so that it's more clear what each person do
S0037	yeah
S0084	which be great but it mean that some people have end up with quite a lot of work on them and she's now line manage someone in the state who do stock she's in charge of stock level and peter peter peter peter
S0037	er er yeah
S0084	what be his name and peter
S0037	uh huh
S0084	be in charge of procurement

S0037	like sometimes would you not have to fly to australia
S0084	yeah
S0037	and then on

S0084	i think that's it and he so he's gonna fly back up to tokyo and then from tokyo straight
S0037	all the way round
S0084	to new york
S0037	oh my god
S0084	horrendous yeah
S0037	that's ridiculous
S0084	so it's gonna take yeah like twenty hours or something
S0037	cos when my friend
S0084	uh
S0037	live in new zealand she try all different rout like cos new zealand's like practically as far away as you can get so
S0084	yeah
S0037	she do like cape town to new zealand and er you know like dubai to australia to new zealand or
S0084	yeah
S0037	like er um tut somewhere on the west coast of america can't even remember where
S0084	la they go via la
S0037	yeah la
S0084	mm
S0037	that way it's just like
S0084	and then er they do hong kong cos when i go out i go with emirates so they stop in dubai
S0037	yeah
S0084	and then so you go to dubai australia and then new zealand
S0037	yeah
S0084	and that's er it's just such a bitch cos when you book the flight they say right you'll have a stop over in dubai but because it's for three hours they tell you but they don't tell you that they you're gonna stop in australia
S0037	yeah
S0084	so when i get on the flight from dubai they be like this be the whatever to melbourne i be like holy fuck i'm on the wrong flight
S0037	oh no
S0084	no no i'm go to new zealand and he be like er this be the new zealand flight rah rah rah it's the same plane and you just um
S0037	yeah
S0084	you're just have a little hour off
S0037	let you off
S0084	yeah
S0037	let some people off here
S0084	the dubai stop over be the worst though
S0037	yeah
S0084	have you fly to dubai
S0037	no
S0084	a you look like you're fly into the water so that's pretty terrify
S0037	yeah
S0084	cos obviously it's right on the edge
S0037	yeah
S0084	and maybe it's because there's so many tall build or because it's there's a desert there but there's air pocket so when they try and descend you drop out of the air
S0037	oh
S0084	and it do this three time on the descent and er everyone be like huh uh huh like really on edge and he obviously think no i'm not gonna attempt this so um
S0037	pull up wow
S0084	ascend yeah and then turn around so you're like like that
S0037	yeah
S0084	everyone's cry at this stage
S0037	oh huh
S0084	and then try again and the same thing happen
S0037	oh my god
S0084	like keep drop out of the air and some guy say to the air stewardess oh my friend's er really really scar of fly can you just get him a drink from the bar like just to steady his nerve no not even don't worry the pilot know what he's do we're not gonna die no so really sympathetic and really helpful
S0037	yeah
S0084	they be actually usually better than that though um third time same thing happen and he obviously think fuck it i'm gonna have to land you know it's gonna have to just happen and so he just keep keep land keep land and we hit with a bang and everyone get off and i assume want to kiss the tarmac which be what i want to do
S0037	oh god
S0084	and then they're like yeah two hours and then back on the plane
S0037	yeah whoo whoo
S0084	and everyone be like no that be bad and then i think it be twelve hours from there to er melbourne
S0037	oh my goodness
S0084	yeah but then you get to go to er amaze place i suppose
S0037	that's true
S0084	that's why you do it
S0037	yeah new york'd be so good though for your birthday you'd be like yay
S0084	tut it would be i mean er that's the thing it'll be full of
S0037	would you like save up and do things like buy yourself something from tiffany's and you know
S0084	i know that's the thing cos er the hotels be really expensive and i know i go to uni with a girl who live there and i
S0037	can you not stay in a hostel or something i mean unless er
S0084	yeah
S0037	it's your birthday though so
S0084	but if you can get um single
S0037	tut single
S0084	er single room it'd be okay
S0037	yeah
S0084	so yeah definitely i haven't even start look so yeah um there's no point in book anything just yet but
S0037	yeah
S0084	it'd be worth have a look to see what be available but obviously for that time of year they'll get book up really quickly
S0037	yeah
S0084	so i'll have to start look soon
S0037	but i think actually it's funny because the flight i mean it's the same sort of time of year that i go last year the year before actually
S0084	yeah
S0037	and like if you go over a weekend it's a lot cheaper
S0084	tut yeah
S0037	than if you go
S0084	you say yeah
S0037	like if you wanna go on the monday to come back on the friday it's there must be so many people er from who be do that from london
S0084	yeah for work yeah
S0037	you know so many like work flight that be do that monday friday thing that
S0084	so you're better off do like wednesday wednesday or something
S0037	yeah exactly i think i
S0084	mm
S0037	we go out on the the wednesday or the thursday and come back on the monday night or the tuesday night i can't remember so
S0084	yeah um it definitely need
S0037	but it's so good
S0084	a bite of
S0037	it's really i'd love to go back
S0084	oh well er you know
S0084	give that 's now go it would be you've get plan
S0037	i know yeah
S0084	get a master plan
S0037	iron in the fire
S0037	oh
S0084	i think the fact that 's be able to go definitely open up the possibility for everybody else to go cos usually it's just directors and
S0037	yeah
S0084	managers and stuff like that you know
S0037	yeah
S0084	who get to go for good reason you know they're usually instigate policies or whatever
S0037	yeah
S0084	but tut it would be good to be able to go
S0037	just they're close down on everything aren't they though er they keep say like
S0084	yeah i know
S0037	no travel and
S0084	yeah
S0037	oh no none of this
S0084	well they say that
S0037	i know
S0084	i think it's all for show because
S0037	i'd love to see like you know some of their expense i bet there's all sort of things on there i do stupid things like when i go to like bloom get the the bus back from the airport instead of get a taxi i just think i should just
S0084	really no you should definitely get a
S0037	but
S0084	car
S0037	well i just it's kind of better anyway in some respect like er
S0084	yeah i know
S0037	you know get to look around and potter round yourself but but i never like go crazy and um like splash out or anything
S0084	well do you know doesn't have to spend any money while she's there because she's there for business even though if she be here she would have to spend money on food
S0037	yeah yeah
S0084	get like travel
S0037	oh i know you don't spend any money on food no
S0084	you don't spend any money but if you think she's actually just work she's just do her job but just in another country
S0037	well yeah
S0084	so when she go out she take five hundred pound in cash
S0037	yeah
S0084	for the first week
