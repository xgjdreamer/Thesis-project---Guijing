S0444	that would be my point cos it's just a point of principle that i don't really wanna take the job search too far
S0439	yeah
S0444	while i'm not on full hours because i just don't think that's application
S0439	oh no of course not no
S0444	and i know a lot of people would apply and be like i'm ill but who care but er from both side apart i don't wanna apply to a company when i'm still poorly and achieve
S0439	and also you kind of don't wanna turn not turn your back on but you don't wanna be like oh you've support me through my illness and now
S0444	and now i'm fuck off
S0439	now i'm piss off yeah
S0444	or i've use that tack you'd never want it to be the case that they'd turn round and be like oh but you be on sick leave then but be you that sick
S0439	yeah exactly yeah
S0444	if you could search for job and that's not
S0439	you don't wanna damage your relationship with
S0444	and also don't want it to be the case where they think oh we move you from a certain subject to another one and you weren't happy so you've now leave and it's kind of like well yeah it it doesn't look great
S0439	yeah
S0444	but i'm just like you know what
S0439	but after six eight months i think that's probably fine
S0444	yeah i mean that's the thing like the hospital treatment be like the first batch of it be pretty much come to an end erm and then they're go to reassess and see what more
S0439	yeah
S0444	cos the problem be that everyone else in the that i've be go to have be receive lot of extra help from their doctor and their gps or other hospitals
S0439	yeah
S0444	so i haven't have anything like my doctor er you know nobody have be tell me how many hours to do
S0439	mm
S0444	and what be good and what be bad and what to look out for nobody
S0439	yeah
S0444	i've be try to dictate all of this myself and i could've get it completely wrong in some in fact in some ways i think i have erm which be why i'm struggle with
S0439	but if you've never you've never be through this before like you well obviously not in a work environment so
S0444	no not in a work context and that's the thing and when i go to the when i talk to the specialist they be like what you mean you've have no help and i be like no the gp just say that you guy would sort me out with this they be like oh right at the end of the like you know the three appointment programme well we'll have to sit down and review what you're do cos a lot of the people in the clinic it be really it's it be quite depress in a way but they be all off work or choose not to work or you know they they they can't walk more than ten minutes and but like you know and some of them be bed bind and some of them go to a doctor's appointment and that's it they're lay up for a week and er you know it be quite extreme
S0439	mm
S0444	i'm not i've not ever be that bad that one appointment be enough to set me off but also
S0439	but also i think the the difference between you be that you're drive and you don't you don't use this illness as an excuse
S0444	no and it just
S0439	for you to like get out of things cos i think i think some people would take this as like
S0444	no i think
S0439	take this opportunity to be like oh i need this much time off work because i've get chronic fatigue syndrome or like
S0444	i miss be at work i miss
S0439	yeah exactly i think you've
S0444	i miss be at work and i miss be able to and be spontaneous
S0439	you've get that drive
S0444	and that's what i've miss and that's what i'm start to get back now
S0439	yeah
S0444	be get that bite of drive so me look at stuff like you know i've have my inbox i've er get a separate inbox for it pile up of all the industry news and analysis and research
S0439	mm
S0444	and stuff that i find interest
S0439	yeah
S0444	and would use in er like in interview and things like that that's all be pile up and for the first time like in months this week i actually start to look through it
S0439	yeah
S0444	and start to make note and er and that's me start to get that drive back and i be like oh i'm gonna go you know and i'm go on a lot of train course over the next couple of weeks which should be quite good
S0439	yeah
S0444	cos you know i've still get that question of do i want to be in market
S0439	yeah
S0444	be it market but not in a publish industry or be it definitely publish that i wanna be in but maybe not market
S0439	yeah
S0444	or be it publish but just not like
S0439	yeah
S0444	i don't know whether you can really like isolate the different things but i sense like er i've notice some of the girls yesterday i just say you know cos they be ask about like the house and stuff and how that be go and i be kind of like well you know it's it it's kind of start to run its natural course like
S0439	mm
S0444	it's er i'm it's kind of mm kind of do
S0444	yeah not in any bad way but it's kind of yeah i wouldn't like like pretty much i wouldn't want to be there beyond like next december hopefully i won't be anyway if i move job but i be kind of say i be like so it's not essentially all or none
S0439	mm

S0439	i be
S0444	that's the thing with the people that you really care about like the postcards in the box you be really sentimental and er when you when you do feel things and allow yourself to feel them things will hit you hard like
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know you're human but you kind of just
S0439	in the small things
S0444	it it take it take it take quite a bite
S0439	yeah
S0444	to that way
S0439	take a while it take a while to get through my wall of pain and doom and
S0444	you er you and be actually scarily similar
S0444	do that sense it's like why do i not recognise that be like
S0439	be like
S0444	it be quite true
S0439	yeah
S0444	i mean i know you you might not really think the best of each other at the moment but it be quite true that like in term of like your attitude towards people in term of like when
S0439	i'm sure we'd get on
S0444	i think it be just not really the right context or whatever and it be
S0439	i think i be just yeah i think i be just angry at him that he kind of ruin your birthday

S0439	yeah
S0444	be there erm
S0439	like i'm definitely not somebody who celebrate their birthday though in march and i'm not someone who think that the world should revolve around me on my birthday and stuff but
S0444	mm
S0439	i just expect a bite more from him that be all
S0444	i don't know we we we we air it out
S0439	good
S0444	on on the even er when we well when we get to my house pretty much
S0439	yeah
S0444	i be not happy with this and he be like i be not happy either and like we both just kind of
S0439	yeah
S0444	rant for quite a while but you know it's i pretty much turn around i say look you know this go for any of my friends you can have your own feel about them i cannot convince you
S0439	mm
S0444	to think about a certain person in a certain way you know that that's not my job erm but all i expect you to do and all i ask you to do be respect that person
S0439	mm
S0444	and appreciate and understand how much that person mean to me as a friend and how much
S0439	yeah
S0444	they have be there to for me as a friend and it be like you know it be quite easy think of the box
S0444	you know and it be that kind of thing like i i be like you know but you know like yes that she be one the most important people you know
S0439	mm
S0444	okay you may not be best friends from day one but you know as long as you have that respect for her as one of my good friends
S0439	mm
S0444	respect the fact that she look after me she support me and i support her and i look after her when she need it and you know that she's important to me that's what i ask at the moment
S0439	yeah the thing be like
S0444	you know and that you know it's fine and whatever happen happen but i i'm just like you know and vice versa it go for you it's like you respect the fact that he's my boyfriend
S0439	yeah
S0444	i'm make my choices and you know
S0439	that's the thing like
S0444	and it's the kind of thing that as long as you if you think that i be make a completely wrong choice further down the line
S0439	i would
S0444	you would say something and i i
S0439	i would tell you yeah like that's why like i never pretend with you like like yeah like today in the car when i like when i say like that i wasn't impress with him i wasn't gonna lie to you like erm but i like on the day like even after everything after like all of last year when like he say he didn't have a spark with you like all of that
S0444	mm
S0439	i didn't dislike him
S0439	and i don't like i don't dislike him now i think it be just
S0444	no
S0439	but you know like mr darcy say like
S0444	yeah
S0439	you know the first like first impressions
S0444	but not
S0439	no like erm be it when a good reputation be lose it's lose forever
S0444	lose forever kind of thing
S0439	and like and i i do get over that now like sometimes i'm really just like i instantly don't like somebody i'm like i'm not make any effort with you but with him like i genuinely do want to make effort i think it be just on that day
S0444	yeah it be just that day no exactly i think that i think
S0439	it be just hard and i just
S0444	i think he be er kind of the same but the thing be that both of you react in the same way to each other
S0439	but i don't think i do anything wrong like i don't
S0444	as in like he he be like oh well you know she she didn't come and say hello or anything so i didn't you know it be that kind of thing i be like i wasn't there for the entirety of it
S0439	mm
S0444	so i okay
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know but i be kind of like
S0439	like hate the not just him but i hate the idea of anybody dislike me when they don't know me
S0444	oh no it be more but he have the kind of thing where he be like well she hasn't talk to me much so
S0439	yeah
S0444	i don't you know
S0439	that be my fault cos i didn't want to talk to him cos i think his behaviour be appal so i didn't so i didn't talk to him so that so that be my that be my bad
S0444	well i i figure that bite i figure that bite and i be just like
S0439	that be my bad i do
S0444	i'm not gonna say oh yeah i really
S0439	no i take no i take complete responsibility
S0444	actually i probably tell him that you know
S0444	she probably hasn't see the best of you either but
S0439	no no i take responsibility for probably not also say hello to him
S0444	oh i know but you know i don't but that's the thing
S0439	next time
S0444	i don't i don't i don't have to tell both of you to act in a certain way with each other
S0439	no no no
S0444	that's not my job my job be just to go er look i'm the person that
S0439	yeah
S0444	both of you love to piece and for that reason you will respect each other and hopefully find things to bond over when you actually realise how similar you be as people
S0439	yeah like i know next time like if i ever meet him it'll be fine
S0444	oh yeah
S0439	just as long as he doesn't do something stupid
S0444	well
S0439	i'm a very scathing woman i protect my girls to the end
S0444	i know but that's what that's what you need and you know that's what i say to i be like you know cos er you know i be in a position where i i think one of his friends be a complete twat
S0439	really
S0444	and tell him not as in his friend
S0439	mm
S0444	but tell and get really defensive and i be like well think of it like it wasn't once i get to realise that that be him
S0439	mm
S0444	and er you know cos it be the guy in i don't know you might not remember the story who kind of say oh yeah i sleep with my ex's best friend or whatever and it be like what like
S0439	what a dick
S0444	it's the lowest er pretty much and he'd say er i'd never meet him before
S0439	yeah
S0444	and then it be like oh you know i dunno it be just it be just a bite of a weird one to begin with and i kind of just say oh you're a right
S0439	mm
S0444	like erm and you know me i would never really say that about someone straight out
S0439	no no yeah
S0444	and i be like oh god right okay well of course er alright to their face and i'm like you know be a bite like i'm not happy about the fact that i even say that
S0439	yeah
S0444	then i i be like the difference be that when i realise that that be actually him be him not him try to impress a certain
S0439	mm
S0444	thing but him be him yeah okay in that aspect he be a dick and
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0444	but agree and his friends do that this guy have no particular like social tact
S0439	yeah
S0444	in a way so then when i realise that that be him but then i saw him later on and be plaster out of his face and i didn't know this then he be like be you and gonna get home okay
S0439	mm
S0444	be he gonna be alright be you gonna be alright
S0439	like he do care
S0444	yeah and it be when come out i be like you're not you're not a dick you're just
S0439	no
S0444	you know in that instance and i be like think of it like that with you take what she say a certain way in the sense of he take it as a criticism it's not a criticism although you
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know and i know you didn't mean it that way
S0439	mm
S0444	i know the mean that i know the way that you mean it and i be kind of i know the way that she mean it because she mean it in a nice way
S0439	yeah
S0444	try to put you at ease
S0439	i be try to be nice
S0444	but then it kind of didn't put you at ease it just make things worse
S0444	gosh right but anyway and i be kind of say you know think of it like that you kind of react to that but then you you haven't have the moment where he's like oh that's how she she's a person
S0439	mm
S0444	she see it from that way like
S0439	yeah
S0444	do you know what i mean so i be just like okay
S0439	yeah it's just not worth like argue about like and yeah like i have complete respect for you and i respect your relationship and i trust that you know what you're do
S0444	yeah
S0439	and like i like i be all for somebody that cos a lot of people not a lot of people but people didn't like hat erm er genuinely do not like him at all
S0444	mm
S0439	and when i be date him she do not like him
S0444	mm
S0439	but so i'm very use to someone tell me that they don't like my boyfriend
S0444	yeah
S0439	and i think but with her i be like okay you don't like him that's fine i can understand why you don't like him we'll leave it at that and then i think yeah you're not gonna get on well with everybody
S0444	no you're not
S0439	and like and never really get the time to bond anyway not that they would but
S0439	but like and like i do hope that if i meet in the future like it'll be fine and i'll explain to him i be like i be just try to be nice like i wasn't try to be a bite like
S0444	yeah i know and i i know that and i know that i know that you would do that and i know that he would do that and i'm quite you know i just i just put it plainly i say look you know
S0439	you're gonna have to grow to like her one day cos she's not go anywhere
S0444	but also it's that kind of thing where you know it it's that kind of thing you don't have to love each other
S0439	no no no at all
S0444	you just have to er respect each other
S0439	yeah
S0444	and hopefully you will like each other and i
S0444	i do think that when hopefully you kind of that you both be just like

S0444	that's that i'm not i'm not gonna be able to get a word in for the rest of the night like that's just how it will be
S0439	yeah
S0444	but
S0439	but i think also like i've grow to appreciate the fact that i'm quite i've be tell that i'm quite intimidate and like like
S0444	who tell you this
S0439	well basically whenever i go round 's house doesn't really talk to me like he's fine er we
S0444	well he he's quite bore because he's scar of you
S0439	well that's what she say she say i think he's intimidate by you because you're not a normal woman i be like
S0439	okay what do this mean she go well you're very
S0444	be this compliment or an insult
S0439	yeah i be like where be this go she well you're very strong
S0444	mm
S0439	and you're very like confident in what you say
S0444	it's not
S0439	it's and i'm like
S0444	it's not that
S0439	be that a good thing or i'm i'm like i don't want to
S0444	no it be a good thing i see what she mean it's more about how it's more about how assure you be
S0439	mm
S0444	and er it's more that people do just get that straight off i'm not take any shit kind of
S0439	yeah
S0444	that and that be not a bad thing it's just you know it might be different
S0444	to me or like let's be nice to everyone kind of thing
S0444	you know and it's not you know for a lot of people that kind of i'm not gonna take any shit from you come further down the line in a in a
S0439	yeah
S0444	in a certain friendship or relationship whereas you be just kind of hey what you see be what you get
S0439	yeah
S0444	that's it this be what i want if you don't like that we're do
S0439	yeah
S0444	and that's fine you go for it
S0439	yeah
S0444	if er if somebody's intimidate by that
S0439	it's it's just
S0444	let them be i mean i know that at certain point i be like wow
S0439	yeah
S0444	okay but it never stop me from be your friend or talk to you
S0439	that's what's the people who know me the closest i be like like what say after she say that she go like when i first meet you i could probably understand why he would be intimidate by you
S0444	mm
S0439	but now that i know you it make me laugh
S0444	yeah it's more like it's it's more about just get the chance like
S0439	yeah
S0444	with with er with a lot of people it's more about just get the chance to know them
S0439	just to get to them yeah
S0444	like you know oh that's really sweet
S0439	she's just like well i i think he's just like you're not cos very much view women as object

S0439	not not in a
S0444	not in a
S0439	not in a horrible way like he'll do anything for you
S0444	he date them he like that like
S0439	yeah
S0444	he like them he's very nice to like and yeah
S0439	he respect and he love but i don't think it's because he see her in that way erm
S0444	yeah
S0439	but he doesn't he doesn't think he doesn't really see women as women he see them as like object really
S0444	mm
S0439	and he isn't really interest in them unless they're there for that reason
S0444	yeah
