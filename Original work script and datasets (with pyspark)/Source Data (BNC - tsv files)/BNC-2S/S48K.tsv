S0084	that's this weekend

S0037	so be he still see that other girl
S0084	yeah but they've now have the conversation like not let's be boyfriend and girlfriend but let's make more time for each other so it's get a bite more serious
S0037	yeah then he's go to london with her
S0084	yeah so he be then like have an attack of the conscience she go mental because she say well i you know i'm never gonna get my money back and you should've say that you be worry about this blah blah blah and you never put me first and i be like

S0084	he didn't know a month ago that he be gonna care that much about her but at the same time like it's totally normal that she's gonna feel like this which
S0037	yeah imagine if it be her like if you know
S0084	she have put herself in this position and she say i can't not because it's the only way i'll get over him and i say

S0084	mm
S0037	so worry about it though
S0084	mm
S0037	i wouldn't let that happen if i like someone they wouldn't do that i would be like you do that and then then obviously i don't mean anything to you so off you

S0037	yeah
S0084	and sophie's like oh don't worry like i think you're probably set now and you probably know what you're do and in my head i'm like

S0084	mm
S0037	still be pick up her e mail she'll still be work it's not like she's go on holiday
S0037	like you know well not entirely on holiday
S0084	not entirely

S0084	i suppose i just think like if you have an emergency though that person be right there
S0037	yeah
S0084	and i know i could turn to anybody else in the department and i'm sure three months be gonna fly
S0037	well you've just all you need to do be just make a note of your problems and then the ones that you solve fine the ones that you can't solve just ring her like dunno
S0084	mm
S0037	the time difference isn't that bad you know ring her at two o'clock in the afternoon and then it's their morning for them

S0037	oh yeah yeah
S0084	cos like do i tell you i've say no to all the hen party yeah like um
S0037	wise move
S0084	i think i might that might be my plan now
S0037	just say no to
S0084	from here on
S0037	like anyone's hen hen party
S0084	yeah cos i've never be to one and i think if i start
S0037	don't don't go
S0084	it'll be a slippery slope
S0037	don't set any precedents
S0084	i know i think
S0037	just say i don't do hen nights sorry
S0084	i think that's fine i think
S0037	i think if it be something that you could if it be in london
S0084	mm
S0037	if it be here if it be somewhere like
S0084	yeah
S0037	you could just go to easily i think yeah fine go but if it's in like crete or something
S0084	yes
S0037	new york or whatever
S0084	you have to fly
S0037	yeah
S0084	i think if it cost any more i mean a hundred pound have gotta be the limit
S0037	yeah
S0084	hasn't it
S0037	yeah yeah
S0084	if it cost more than a hundred pound no
S0037	mm definitely
S0084	cos that's just ridiculous
S0037	mm
S0084	cos even sophie's hen party in brighton it be eighty five just for two things during the day
S0037	yeah
S0084	then you've get
S0037	it's ridiculous
S0084	what you're do in the even and then you've get accommodation and train
S0037	i never get that i just think like surely if you're have if you're go in for the hen night thing surely it's like let's go pub and like let's drink
S0084	yeah
S0037	and let's go party not let's have a manicure
S0084	yeah yeah
S0037	and let's have our hair do like
S0084	well in my head when i be younger i always use to think i'm not gonna cos i grow up in brighton i'm not gonna have a hen weekend like that
S0037	yeah mm
S0084	i'll go on holiday we can all go on holiday together in my head and now i'm an adult
S0037	yeah
S0084	i'm like that's a fuck ridiculous idea because it'll cost everyone three hundred and fifty pound
S0037	yeah unless it be agree and that be gonna be like you know
S0084	yeah
S0037	you've get like
S0084	or you're go with your best mate or something
S0037	yeah you can't just like press gang your friends into
S0084	twelve people into pay four hundred pound
S0037	into come because you've decide to get marry yeah
S0084	oh it's all about me this week girls
S0037	yeah exactly
S0084	everything
S0037	i i hate all that
S0084	yeah
S0037	that's why i never have a birthday party or anything cos i hate that like it's all about me sort of thing
S0084	it's hard isn't it yeah
S0037	i just really sort of i understand why and i know it's nice to celebrate and that but like i think i'm i would be like be you have fun be you have fun i'm have fun be everyone have fun like
S0084	mm
S0037	and i'd get too stress about it
S0084	yeah yeah
S0037	people you know it's people feel oblige to come and if they don't come you're er there's load of politics isn't there
S0084	it be difficult i mean i like the idea of be able to get all the yeah i do actually quite like the press gang aspect of your birthday party
S0037	yeah
S0084	because it sort of make your friends come to you because normally you're the one
S0037	yeah
S0084	or i find in my case you're the one
S0037	yeah yeah
S0084	go into all the different group of people like i lot of group of different people
S0037	yeah
S0084	it's quite nice to get everybody together in one place
S0037	yeah
S0084	and to guilt trip them into do so because it's your birthday but i know what you mean
S0037	you're evil
S0084	yeah a little bite just a little bite but like i wouldn't do it on a hen week like i
S0037	yeah
S0084	not to make people pay load of money that's really mean
S0037	yeah
S0084	or like the wed
S0037	i think if you want people to come
S0084	aspect
S0037	you've gotta make it something reasonable
S0084	yeah i mean er always know that load of people be gonna have to fly out for her wed anyway and that be gonna be expensive and if you're gonna get marry somewhere that's gonna cost people a hundred and thirty pound a night to stay
S0037	oh
S0084	like that's still gonna be sixty even if do come it's still gonna be sixty five pound
S0037	yeah
S0084	per night plus the flight which be probably gonna be seventy pound plus whatever i wear in fact i won't i might not buy a new dress i might just have to roll out some old have be
S0037	can you silk one's really nice could you not that up
S0084	which one
S0037	the one that you wear on your birthday
S0084	the green one
S0037	yeah
S0084	yeah it be nice
S0037	that's really nice

S0084	yeah maybe a little fascinator
S0037	some jewellery fascinator
S0084	fascinator yeah
S0037	i think so that's that's quite weddingy you know you could you could
S0084	yeah that's good okay
S0037	weddingy
S0084	and it's quite spring like
S0037	it be yeah
S0084	because green with white flower and it'll be and it's may so

S0084	because of the weather
S0037	cos i can't be anused
S0084	fair enough
S0037	just don't fancy it like you know sometimes i don't know it's sort of get on my nerve a bite like
S0084	oh
S0037	i do like i like knit obviously
S0084	yeah
S0037	um but i think sort of like cos arrange a lot of it like she sort of want different things from it she really want a like a new group of friends whereas i just like knit
S0084	yeah
S0037	and if she want to knit in a pub oh that's that's good cos i like pubs
S0084	yeah
S0037	um but like she's like really want some new people to come and all the time and i just find it a bite drain like
S0084	yeah
S0037	i'm not desperate to make like make new friends or anything and i think part of that's because i quite like hang out on my own with you with just do
S0084	mm
S0037	whatever
S0084	mm
S0037	like i'm not really desperate to have
S0084	you don't feel you're miss something
S0037	i don't like exactly
S0084	mm
S0037	i don't whereas i think cos cos her boyfriend go like to the pub with his work friends
S0084	mm
S0037	on a friday and like just like doesn't invite her and i think so
S0084	oh my god he's such a cock
S0037	yeah
S0084	be he still gonna take this job abroad
S0037	i don't know
S0084	oh
S0037	that's still sound up in the air but yeah so like
S0084	mm
S0037	i don't think he really invite her and he do a lot of things with his friends and she hasn't like get a group of her own friends or anything
S0084	mm
S0037	but so i think i'm sure that's what she want
S0084	mm
S0037	but i just find it a bite tire
S0084	mm
S0037	like
S0084	yeah it be drain i mean i think it be hard if you're not into like team sport or
S0037	yeah yeah it be hard to meet people
S0084	that sort of easy way of get a group of people like er it be quite hard
S0037	and i do
S0084	yep
S0037	i do feel sorry for her because i think sort of haven't be be like i think maybe she think we'd just move to cambridge like oh i'm here like
S0084	mm
S0037	it'll be great but i'm i'm not like hey let's do this like all the time
S0084	mm

S0084	just go and drink a beer
S0037	turn up glass of beer get my needle out
S0084	mm
S0037	i've be oh i haven't tell you i saw you know the wool that you buy us for my birthday
S0084	oh yeah
S0037	i've knit like this massive thick chunky scarf
S0084	oh nice
S0037	so i i start with your wool but
S0084	yeah
S0037	obviously that only get us like that far cos the
S0084	mm
S0037	it's quite small ball aren't they like the really nice thick one
S0084	mm
S0037	and when you're i knit it with really big needle so
S0084	oh
S0037	it doesn't
S0084	okay it doesn't go as far
S0037	so um i get some more um not exactly the same cos that be quite expensive
S0037	so i get some similar and um it's about this long now it's really nice
S0084	oh
S0037	like the pattern's really it look a bite like sort of rope
S0084	oh okay
S0037	i haven't finish it yet because like when it's get like a cabley bite in it but then when you finish it you drop the you drop the stitch in between the cable so it sort of have like a rim thing
S0084	mm
S0037	anyway
S0084	oh and be that a pattern
S0037	it's nearly finish
S0084	from the book
S0037	um
S0084	or be it one you find online
S0037	yeah it be a a bite of it be from the book but i sort of change a bite of it but yeah
S0084	wow
S0037	inspire by the book
S0084	well i'll have to come round to the house to see you wear it because a cream scarf be probably a bite dangerous
S0037	yes
S0084	so you might have to only wear it in the house
S0037	i think it'll look like my bestest one but i be think about make some bobble for it um but think like that i'm a mental person
S0037	for want to have a scarf with like i make some massive bobble cos i in the book as well
S0084	right
S0037	they have scarf that have like some really big bobble on the end
S0084	right okay
S0037	and i really like it
S0037	so i make some big bobble and i'm think about put them on but i'm not sure
S0084	i remember make bobble at school be that where you wrap it round the cardboard
S0037	yeah yeah
S0084	circle
S0037	circle yeah
S0084	yeah and then just cut it round the outside or something don't you
S0037	yeah and then you so you have two like two sort of um circle
S0084	mm
S0037	um like with a hole in the middle
S0084	mm
S0037	put them two together and then you wrap the wool round and round and round and round and round and round
S0084	mm
S0037	and then you cut them and then you you prise the two cardboard piece apart and then you tie a
S0084	and you can pull them off
S0037	tie a string through the middle
S0084	oh okay
S0037	and then you pull them off and you fluff your bobble
S0084	oh
S0037	so i've make these massive bobble
S0037	i've make three of them matt's like what be you do but i really like them
S0084	you're gonna put three of them on
S0037	i don't know i'm not sure
S0084	you could put two er one on each end and then like make a hat and have a bobble hat
S0037	i know that's what i think first i want to put five on each end and be like i think that's overkill
S0084	five bobble on each end
S0084	wow
S0037	well cos the scarf and the
S0084	how big be the scarf
S0037	it's quite big
S0084	right
S0037	it's quite big
S0084	okay
S0037	um cos the scarf in the book have like that be different though it sort of it have a big bobble and it sort of taper out from the bobble
S0084	okay
S0037	i think i'm gonna make that scarf anyway i'm not sure what i'll do with all these scarves
S0084	i be gonna say it's get quite warm now
S0037	i know but knitware's you know
S0084	it's always appropriate yeah
S0037	yeah always appropriate

S0037	yeah
S0084	like as soon as as soon as i run out of wool that be it with knit
S0037	yeah
S0084	i think right
S0037	needle down yeah
S0084	do i need to find somewhere to get reasonable wool not like rowan every time
S0037	yeah well that rowan wool be really nice and you can really see the difference like the bottom of my scarf's really nice and then the obviously cos i buy like three pound ones that i buy like similar but it's it's not the same
S0084	mm
S0037	like you can the bottom bit's really nice and the rest of it be nice
S0084	mm
S0037	but like it's not as nice
S0084	mm
S0037	but if i'd use like five ball of that it the scarf would be like thirty five pound
S0084	it's just obscene isn't it just for a scarf
S0037	i know
S0084	yeah i mean it's really difficult
S0037	so but this wool be like three pound that's more reasonable
S0084	wow where do you get that from
S0037	john lewis
S0084	oh really
S0037	yeah
S0084	wow
S0037	but it be just um it be like a chunky wool but it be sort of it wasn't as nice
S0084	i'll have to investigate
S0037	but still nice
S0084	yeah well the girl that i work with at waterstones have open this new sheep shop
S0037	oh no i i think i
S0084	on street

S0084	and so i didn't really know her but we'd always see each other at like work do cos
S0037	yeah
S0084	she'd always come and we'd never really have much to say to each other so it be always a bite like oh how's it go
S0037	oh yeah god

S0037	bet it'll be expensive though
S0084	it'll be expensive yeah it's an expensive business which you you wanna support
S0037	yeah
S0084	but you also would need to be able to afford to eat
S0037	yes
S0084	so
S0037	not just knit
S0084	not just knit so you'd look really good but
S0084	you'd be really skinny and
