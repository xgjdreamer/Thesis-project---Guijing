S0423	oh do you oh be look them up the other day
S0421	be you
S0423	yeah like just for a few minutes er cos i think oh it might be good to get one yeah i could only those probably ones you're look at i could only really find them for around ten pound
S0421	yeah
S0423	where's he go which the way out it's not very clear be it
S0421	yeah i think it'll be a good a good investment
S0423	so where have you buy it from
S0421	ebay
S0423	oh right how much
S0421	for twelve pound
S0423	and erm what one be it
S0421	it's grip and go
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it's the green one
S0423	what do it have like an outer thing on it
S0421	yeah just like a little one just like a little silicon thing
S0423	and be there no delivery charge for it
S0421	no they
S0423	when i i saw one most of them be just say it's glass and this that and the other
S0421	yeah
S0423	well one of them be like there's no bfp or whatever be that what it be
S0421	bpa
S0423	yeah i think be that not just on plastic
S0421	erm it mean no bpa on the silicon top although
S0423	oh right
S0421	although
S0423	so it's funny
S0421	yeah
S0423	none of the others have it
S0421	no they all they all say no bpa if you read the description properly
S0423	oh
S0421	it should do anyway all the ones i be look at have it anyway but erm yeah the one you might have look at if it say it you the one you might have look at be erm might have be a plastic one cos sometimes you put glass in and it come up with plastic ones as well
S0423	no you could see it be glass
S0421	oh be it be you sure
S0423	yeah yeah
S0421	which one be it
S0423	cos it be as well well i can't remember do any it look quite quite a posh site i go into so look at
S0421	oh right oh right it wasn't on amazon
S0423	no no i didn't look on amazon i just put the name in
S0421	oh right
S0423	for a
S0421	no well on amazon they all say bpa free
S0423	oh right
S0421	cos the top obviously can't be glass so it's either like metal or a bite of silicon or something and it's it's bpa free free
S0423	yeah i do see one
S0421	mm
S0423	that's like the bottle i have with the ceramic cork thing but
S0421	yeah
S0423	a smaller version
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i'm think i might you know of get that it's only about three pound
S0421	oh right
S0423	cos i'm not keep water i want it you know i use it erm mainly when i i'm in work
S0421	mm
S0423	at the desk and i can leave it in my locker and so i want to drink quite a lot of water especially when i'm cycle
S0421	uhu
S0423	erm it's about seven hundred mil or something
S0421	yeah oh that's quite big
S0423	be it
S0421	yeah think about an
S0423	well i i've get it didn't look big and i've get a similar bottle and it's one and a half litres and it just look like a normal
S0421	oh right
S0423	size so i think they're quite wide so i don't think they're long
S0421	oh right
S0423	it's just probably wide
S0421	yeah
S0423	with a narrow neck cos i know seven fifty be quite big but it might be similar to those water bottle like
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know you can get seven
S0421	mm
S0423	fifty
S0421	mm
S0423	and it's wide rather than long
S0421	yeah
S0423	and they're they're quite handy those ones be not bad i don't know i'm gonna look a bite more yeah i do erm i i do look er on amazon and i didn't look in detail though and i just click on ones and it say you be entitle to free delivery on this
S0421	oh
S0423	with that i go into it then and then i put two bottle and it it come up for like twenty pound or whatever and i be just less nineteen
S0421	yeah
S0423	ninety eight and it come up say oh if you spend two pence more you get free delivery so i don't know why it say on the original thing you could be entitle to free delivery for it
S0421	it's because
S0423	it's funny if you spend over twenty then
S0421	yeah well well you be entitle to amazon free delivery if you spend over twenty pound but that's how they write it you be entitle to free delivery
S0423	right
S0421	but then if you read it all it say if if it's over twenty pound
S0423	yeah cos with you say oh it we'd both get one and you might go for it so so i think i'll have a quick look at it
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i be think i might get one
S0421	yeah well i mean they've not dispatch this one yet they should have do but if it if it never get dispatch i'll be have to buy another one from somewhere else cos i have to cancel it
S0423	well why would they not dispatch it
S0421	i don't know they should do
S0423	when do you order it
S0421	it's er yesterday no saturday
S0423	normally you get a thing say it's be dispatch or at least an email say we've get you order
S0421	yeah they've get the order but erm just hasn't be dispatch yet and it should be here accord to their calculations it should have it should be arrive tomorrow but i don't think that's gonna happen since they've not dispatch it yet
S0423	but do they send you a message say dispatch
S0421	no that's what i'm on about they've not dispatch it yet
S0423	maybe they don't but maybe they don't send you a message say it's dispatch
S0421	no you have to on ebay you mark it
S0423	oh do you
S0421	they don't send it you just mark it as dispatch that's
S0423	oh right
S0421	how it work i've order from ebay before
S0423	oh right yeah i saw one and it say a sport water bottle
S0421	yeah
S0423	that cos i think it might be a bite more durable cos if they do one kind of put in your bag when i'm out cycle as well
S0421	yeah i think the one i'm get well i mean you can wait to see what mine look like
S0423	i'll have to see what
S0421	i think it's quite erm durable it's quite
S0423	mm
S0421	thick glass cos there's not really be any some people say they've like drop it and stuff and it's not break
S0423	oh
S0421	cos one of them i be look at amazon cos it it have quite a nice design erm but some people be say oh like you could get one with like a fault in the design and the bottom break off
S0423	mm
S0421	and i be like oh right maybe not then and it look nice but i might as well get one that's more
S0423	as well i'm think though i you know i like it fairly lightweight and i don't want one
S0421	no you're not gonna get a glass one lightweight
S0423	i'd like to see if if it's durable it's not gonna be lightweight if it's lightweight it's gonna be very fragile isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	for the lightweight it seem to
S0421	yeah
S0423	it would be thin glass
S0421	like so if you look for lightweight you wanna look at plastic or
S0423	mm
S0421	aluminium if you even if you look at stainless steel stainless steel's heavy
S0423	really
S0421	but yeah stainless steel's durable but they be heavy
S0423	mm
S0421	i wouldn't have think it's heavy stainless steel
S0423	yeah it be i wouldn't have think so either but all the review say they be quite
S0423	oh right
S0421	heavy but yeah stainless steel be the next best if you don't wanna get a glass one
S0423	mm
S0421	but like i say you've get to look erm on the inside to check it's the inside part the interior that's one hundred percent stainless steel
S0423	mm
S0421	and they're about the same price as the glass ones
S0423	yeah
S0421	get new shoe as well do you like my new shoe
S0423	oh yeah be they the same as the old ones
S0421	yeah exactly the same
S0423	you know i i be look at them last time you you have those shoe on
S0421	yeah
S0423	i be look and i think i think you do need some
S0423	well cos they be look a bite old so how much be they
S0421	fifty pound
S0423	really
S0421	from clarks well it's
S0423	it's a
S0421	average in clarks isn't it
S0423	yeah they they wouldn't have go in the sale a shoe like that
S0421	no
S0423	one anyway if they have the sale yeah the be that from
S0421	i don't know i'm try to get in erm she's ask do i like salad or do i prefer potato dish
S0423	right well it'll have to be you not me
S0421	what kind of what kind of potato
S0423	what she mean be er like erm to accompany your meal do you like more potato with your meal or do you prefer do you eat salad with your meal or like
S0421	i don't really like salad
S0423	well if you like potatoes then well
S0421	yeah i like potatoes
S0423	then say potato
S0421	so be that all you want me to say potatoes
S0423	no say whatever you'd say say
S0421	well what would you say this be you
S0423	well you could say it's i prefer potato
S0421	no
S0423	or you could if you're write on my
S0421	yeah what would you say
S0423	she prefer potatoes or potato or whatever or you could just ring her she's finish work now
S0421	i don't i don't want to talk on the phone
S0423	be you allergic
S0421	yeah be that all she prefer potatoes i don't want to be like fussy if she want to do salad
S0423	oh right well you should put that she doesn't mind either but she she have a preference for potatoes
S0421	okay like she prefer potatoes but she doesn't mind either
S0423	you're happy with either sort of
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah you're the expert in the english language so
S0421	yeah but i'm try to i don't know what you would say
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	cos it's from you
S0423	oh right yeah well a smiley face as well on it
S0421	that's so that feel so weird for me to write like that
S0423	i know the they must be popular mustn't there
S0421	i like i just yeah i always put a smiley face or something
S0423	what do it mean if you don't would would it just mean you're a miserable sod
S0421	no well it just depend on your texting style like people will get use to it people will know if you never use them but if you usually use them
S0423	well that's it and they can only think
S0421	and then
S0423	oh why didn't i get a
S0421	yeah
S0423	smiley face be she upset with me that's the problem isn't it
S0421	because like when i first when you first text people like erm you don't know how like you usually like some people put kiss and some people don't and some people like use text speak and some people don't and some people use emojis and some people don't and then it's like you kind of like have to see what how they erm write it's but
S0423	you have to just stick with what you do what you wanna do don't you really
S0421	i know but some people like if they don't use emojis i i might not use them too many back because like if there's so so some people i might go a bite crazy with the emojis but if someone doesn't use them at all they'll probably think i'm a bite weird if i use them so i'm just like
S0423	see i bet you get load of texts i mean you seem to be a bite of an expert on them
S0421	not really oh yeah it's it's like usually like if i'm discuss the homework with somebody or something and i've not message them before like on facebook or something most people put kiss
S0423	it's a bite odd isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	unless they're the kind of person where they're very kissy kissy anyway
S0421	i don't know i think to be honest it's just something that people put
S0423	slow down a bite
S0421	so yeah i'm happy they still stock the same shoe cos they're comfortable
S0423	mm they look a bite nicer than the last ones
S0421	a bite
S0423	but you could keep those anyway for when
S0421	yeah
S0423	if they're comfortable and you just use them for you know pop to the shop or whatever
S0421	yeah
S0423	so you don't you get more use out of those ones and you wear them when you're actually go somewhere or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	rather than use them every day well practically
S0421	cos i think i can't be bother go and try on different ones that be on in the sale because erm i might not like them and i have to find the ones i like and i know i like these so
S0423	yeah and if they're comfortable then you know you're not gonna have problems with them be you
S0421	yeah
S0423	that'll be ask what you want i don't know how she think i'm actually
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	reply to her
S0421	she well she might have think you could answer it like you you oh she just say okay erm she might have think you you you answer her when we stop for fuel
S0423	uhu
S0421	she probably think you're texting back rather quickly as well
S0423	mm
S0421	it's so funny like when i be chat to these vodafone people online you know cos you can chat to them online to get help instead of ring
S0423	mm
S0421	and er it be for set up grandad's erm phone like he want a different plan like just the really basic one where you just whatever you use like you top up and you use whatever you top up do you know what i mean
S0423	yeah
S0421	like just like what you would expect cos he have some weird one before and er so i be chat to them online and i be pretend to be him like you know cos obviously they ask for your name
S0423	oh
S0421	and stuff and i be do it for him and erm they be like oh do you want me to do it for you or whatever
S0423	mm
S0421	erm and like i get er like the obviously like give his date of birth and everything and er erm i be like oh just just please just set it up for me i i don't know what i'm do you know
S0423	mm
S0421	and then and they're like and then they're like erm how often do you like use your phone how many minutes and i'm like oh probably only call ten minutes a month to speak to my granddaughter
S0421	erm like cos i be i want to make sure they be gonna give him
S0423	yeah
S0421	you know like the thing and it they be like oh okay then and then they be like er do it and they be probably think for an old man who doesn't know anything about technology they're answer really quick cos i'm a really quick typist so i be like and they be probably think like oh you know he's good at type but
S0423	mm
S0421	no and they're like oh i hope you have a good weekend like
S0423	well do he not just get pay as you go one
S0421	well we want that but
S0423	yeah
S0421	when we get buy it for him they didn't give us that they give us like a thing where you like top up and you get so many minutes free er
S0423	mm
S0421	but then they take keep take his credit when he didn't use it or something like after a certain amount of time and we be like no we didn't want this because we set when we open it for him we be like we want the most basic like pay as you go thing and that's what they give us so we didn't they we could get a different one but i chat to them and they've just put him on a normal pay as you go thing
S0423	oh
S0421	cos it be ridiculous
S0423	what be it an english phone he's gonna use to speak to you or something
S0421	no he just for when he's over here he have a different sim card
S0423	oh
S0421	just so it's not expensive if he need to ask us something and he's like at the shop or something
S0423	yeah i think you should have er they get tesco they do one like that i think pay you get twenty you get like ten pound you get they'll they'll double it
S0421	yeah but you have to
S0423	but you
S0421	top it up every month
S0423	well yeah you don't know what the deal be it's probably something like that isn't it
S0421	yeah cos that's what it be with vodafone and it be
S0423	oh right
S0421	stupid like he only want he hardly
S0423	yeah
S0421	use any of it
S0423	be i go the way
S0421	i dunno
S0423	i be i'm go back to i'm stupid
S0421	you be
S0423	see it's listen to you and not think what i'm do and i just go into automatic pilot
