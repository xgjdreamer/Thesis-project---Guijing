S0192	she tell me she would message me as soon as she get there
S0227	right
S0192	and they take the midnight ferry
S0227	right
S0192	and then there be mean to drive to the spring
S0227	yes
S0192	i've haven't hear from her i've email her i've email his 's grandparents nobody's get back to me i haven't hear from anyone there's be no confirmation that they've actually arrive there and it's now thursday
S0227	be
S0192	no he's not bother he's just like i'm sure they're fine though mum tell me that she'd message me
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean they should have arrive how long do it take to drive do you think
S0227	well it's it's a bloody long drive
S0192	six hours through france six hours through spain
S0227	not a chance france be twice the size of the erm unite kingdom
S0192	yeah
S0227	and then spain be about the same erm you're look at about erm
S0192	well they might be able to get some pretty big roads
S0227	even with the tour roads um you're erm to the spanish border from here south be probably about eight to nine hundred miles in a straight line
S0192	yeah
S0227	then you've get to add the deviation to that
S0192	it's nearly a thousand miles through just through the length of france
S0227	yeah that's get there it's about seven hundred to get into the probably eight hundred by road to get to the south of france erm the erm
S0192	so what do you think then like a twenty hour journey
S0227	oh easy easy twenty hours
S0192	yeah
S0227	twenty hours i would say i don't know how far down erm we drive from we drive from erm kian to barcelona
S0192	barcelona
S0227	and that take us quite a long time to do that
S0192	yeah
S0227	and they're right right down near the spanish border and they're much they're further south than barcelona erm i imagine they're i don't know where
S0192	oh yeah they be
S0227	there's costa brava costa del sol costa
S0192	they near to alicante not too far from there
S0227	not too far from alicante so probably
S0192	erm alicante's east coast isn't it it's it's between alicante and melena
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's near to
S0227	right that sound like sound like it could be costa del sol
S0192	costa del sol
S0227	erm so it's it's quite a drive i mean personally i wouldn't drive i would fly and hire a car
S0192	no of course but they look into fly and it be they say it be a thousand pound for the three of them to fly and they say no we can't afford that
S0227	erm i do go with easy easy
S0192	they say they leave the ticket too late too book and then when they go to book they couldn't find it cheaper than a thousand pound for the three of them so they're drive
S0227	what's the price of i mean you could have get down to this you could have this be not massively close but it be it be pretty close i suppose it's also the the expense of the car and they're go in peak season they're go in they've go in the summer holiday
S0192	yeah
S0227	so things will be the price of a plane ticket to costa del sol which be south of france i think it be something like a hundred and twenty pound for both of us return flight
S0192	yeah
S0227	for both of us
S0192	that's abnormally cheap
S0227	erm yeah price do pump up i would have probably buy the ticket erm erm further back
S0192	i mean i tell her that i be come home six months before i come home and she be tell me then that they be go to spain so why didn't they book their flight then
S0227	well um that's why when i respond to your email that i find it a little bite strange that she couldn't have lock into a commitment because she couldn't have book a holiday at be because you have to book it you can't you can't book into the next year erm officially you have to wait until the new new financial year start before you can do that so she hadn't book a holiday erm so and then i do think well i don't think you've pay for your air flight because i be assume they be go to go down by air now so why be it you can't move it which she do in the end anyway
S0192	so should i not be worry then it be possible they wouldn't have get there until midnight on tuesday and then
S0227	she should yes
S0192	and then they could have be sleep all of wednesday
S0227	yeah i'd leave it until this afternoon if you haven't hear anything get your brother to ring and see if he get anything cos they should by this afternoon she should have get her act together erm they get a phone between the lot of them erm to make the call to say yes we're here erm a little drive especially with erm i don't know if your mum be go to take turn but a long drive especially when you consider that erm like in the car be a young child they can sleep for some of that you can't sleep for all of it and it's a question of how much how stimulate he's keep
S0192	they be silly as well they weren't leave after a full night's sleep they be leave after a full day's be awake
S0227	yes
S0192	they be leave at midnight
S0227	yes
S0192	which mean it seem ridiculous they have to drive another twenty four hours without sleep
S0227	yes yes unfortunately erm i think sometimes they act like um some place when mum be a teenager they kind of do those things that you can do that that thing when you're young when we go when i drive down to south of france with family erm we we leave at about one or two o'clock in the morning because they have go through the be able to get to sleep before that be i wasn't sure because i know they be come back
S0192	yeah
S0227	so i go on a drive down there without any sleep we get to because we weren't take the toll roads we be take the not toll roads to save money plus the car wasn't the best car in the world health wise and erm erm about seven o'clock that night it go down which be just the south of france but i be i be twenty twenty four at the time drive a fifty one
S0192	yeah
S0227	especially if i you know you're fifty one and you haven't have a night you've be asleep
S0192	yeah it's ridiculous
S0227	i would have go in the daytime
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	but i'm think they're look at stay a night in france so we'll just carry one in the night erm then sleep for most of the journey
S0192	i think that be the main reason they want to go to sleep
S0227	yeah
S0192	twenty hours
S0227	i don't know if he if he's a good sleeper or he might be one who have six or seven hours sleep yes so erm i can only imagine that your mum's gonna do some of the drive as well but erm i don't know how comfortable she would be with that it be a long it be a lot just to put on one's shoulder
S0192	selfish but i do wish they'd never have at all the whole family apparently have 's children don't have much contact with him now because they pretty much resent so
S0227	oh it's another uh they will probably especially if they're female they would look at it as though their family be a prototype erm and he's now get a new family now this be the to block out all the wrinkle to save the family
S0192	i think the main problem be with their uh now 's have three children and she's think well i want you to be a grandfather to my children and you've barely get any time to do anything
S0227	no because he's and it must have be erm it must have be a shock for her because the they be they be only about a month or so in it that when she tell him that she be he be go to be a grandmother erm father he counter with oh by the way i'm gonna become a father again that would have pull the rug from under her
S0227	yes it would have do and the think that my dad and his new erm wife have another child and then a boy erm she it would have also hurt by proxy his first wife because they have two children together which be daughters she probably want a son he probably want a son with her i mean it must have be debate on he would have like to have a boy that never happen he then have another marriage that didn't work and then he have a marriage again and have a child erm so for him for for them they they feel like feel like our family be be it doesn't it doesn't necessarily cement the families together
S0192	no it doesn't
S0227	the children can feel they will feel this be our family he's relate to us but he's part of that new family you know and we're old guard um
S0192	mum's hurt as well because erm refuse to let her children call mum grandmother so she's not a grandmother at all because they don't call her anything so they don't see her as a grandmother even though she say she put in as much attention as she can
S0227	i think she's i think she's right in that sense that yes because isn't your grandfather then
S0192	yeah
S0227	uh i agree with yes she should be the grandmother
S0192	she's grow up with them
S0227	be be it better to have ten grandmothers or no grandmothers
S0192	yeah i only grow up with one grandmother and one grandfather
S0227	yes exactly
S0192	i only have one granddad that i don't ever see
S0227	yes i do agree with her if she put the effort and she want to be as well
S0192	yeah
S0227	erm so it's yeah that but they shouldn't be surprise about the dismay that his daughters have because um
S0192	no i don't think they're surprise i think they're just wish it be
S0227	go to be but um
S0192	but they choose to have
S0227	well yes but i would imagine
S0192	it's their choice and they have to live with the consequences of their choice
S0227	indeed
S0192	you can't guarantee how people be go to react to it
S0227	no this this be clearly a they be both on separate agendas they have never actually be honest with each other i doubt if ask a question when she be pregnant together by someone erm what be you hop the baby will be because they be both operate under different agendas both of them would have come up with the standard stock answer we don't mind as long as it's healthy as long as the baby be healthy which be a true statement but it's not the the full truth he would have be secretly think and hop
S0192	boy
S0227	it's a boy and she be want a girl one of them be go to be disappoint unless it be twin and be go be one of each
S0227	yeah so erm so when it she give birth i don't know if she know beforehand it be go to be a boy or she be wait you know to be pleasantly or unpleasantly surprise
S0192	apparently it's a boy it's a hyperactive little boy like me and apparently he's very similar to if i be that annoy when i be a little boy i'm very sorry
S0227	i
S0192	i hear he's like two little boys
S0227	i haven't spend any time with them i've stuff like that but
S0192	from wake up to go to bed he have a lot a lot of energy
S0227	right
S0192	a lot of energy
S0227	yeah
S0192	and i guess i be like that too apparently wasn't so
S0227	right
S0192	that be a lot of work
S0227	i don't remember you be that bad to be fair
S0192	no
S0227	but i would imagine i'm just try to similarity with you so that you connect make connections erm obviously after have him i mean you have to because if she try to go at the gate like her sister do her sister be go to go at the gate as many time as it take her to get a boy even though she be tell oh she be on the pill she be not take them and he be stupid enough to fall to fall for that twice
S0227	it be a case that she know that she be to and be come up with the old with the excuse that i would come up with the real excuse be don't need to have another child i've get all the help i need i have one son two daughters i don't need any more i don't need to be more tire don't need you to be more tire and the money it's go to cost us to raise another yet another one
S0192	at that point it's his duty to have a vasectomy
S0227	yeah
S0192	have you ever consider that
S0227	no
S0192	it sound horrible
S0227	yes
S0227	yeah sound
S0192	it look like a really
S0227	sound painful
S0192	i don't really wanna get it do 's brother's get it do
S0227	yeah
S0192	he's get two kid and he's like no not have any more
S0227	yeah
S0192	get it do and
S0227	i in the end nature take care of itself for me erm
S0192	yeah
S0227	so erm if i be if if mum have go to the well again i would say look we can't er a we're too old that be the first excuse the second be we can't afford it what i wouldn't have say but which be the real reason as i say be don't need don't need it
S0192	no
S0227	i've get what i want she hasn't get what she want
S0192	what do you mean nature take care of itself
S0227	er well i won't be erm have any more children because er erm
S0192	because of her her health
S0227	yeah erm
S0192	yeah okay i didn't know if you be say you'd become infertile or something
S0227	we we just no no no no not to my knowledge erm erm we talk about you know years ago we talk about have a child but we just rule it out with too old
S0227	too much of an impact on on the er on the exist families
S0192	surely you don't wanna go through that all again when you've just
S0227	er the think the think do cross your mind but we er we didn't fantasize about it it didn't it you know erm we
S0192	you wanna enjoy your your older age
S0227	exactly so it be talk and then
S0192	er mum and be still say when i see them that oh you know we saw this lovely little bite of land on the south of for fifteen thousand or something you're dream
S0227	you
S0192	stop dream you can't do that you're you're you're give yourself false hope
S0192	your son have only just start school in england
S0227	yeah
S0192	none of you can speak french
S0227	french no the erm
S0192	don't have a job out there
S0227	no it it's it's a pipe dream it's nice to dream but it i don't i don't
S0192	dream a dream that's achievable
S0227	yeah
S0192	don't dream a dream that you can't manage
S0227	the
S0192	that dream that sink
S0227	yes
S0192	er when they have
S0227	yes
S0192	effectively
S0227	you you completely
S0192	they could've do that
S0227	yes it be completely torpedo
S0192	it be feasible
S0227	yeah the business that he be gonna get into erm er what what er i've be inform be that he be go to open up a er a bicycle shop
S0192	a bike shop or a sandwich shop or something else
S0227	it wouldn't it would've be a lot of hard work and they wouldn't have have survive
S0192	no
S0227	on that erm erm the well they didn't have much capital er you know in the in the house and
S0192	and if they if it if it be that easy everyone would be do it wouldn't they
S0227	yeah and the language you've gotta learn the language erm er i'm i i have to be pragmatic and i have to look forward erm and like i say i there be a time er er that i think that wouldn't get out of twenty fourteen
S0192	yeah
S0227	er i wasn't exaggerate cos when i say to the doctor when i saw him to get my repeat er consultation for my repeat which be just a formality er he's her doctor and he ring and cos he would go to the home where she work as well so he have quite a connection with her and he he raise her in in our consult erm and say er how's i say well yeah she's do quite well at the moment obviously he get all the medical copy from the hospital and that i say if someone have say to me last this time last year that this time last year we'd be in erm both at the mediterranean
S0192	yeah
S0227	erm i would have raise a cynical eyebrow and he go yes he start to say and then stop himself but his face continue say yes i didn't think that this would
S0227	cos i wasn't i wasn't exaggerate erm she be very she be very very ill she manage to she manage to turn the corner erm the sickness be the fact that the cancer have spread into her bone
S0192	can she do that again though be the question be it just gonna keep come back
S0227	yeah it's gonna come back so yes i have to be pragmatic and think well beyond and my plan erm if she if she my plan be to hit some of them i'm keep my options open of move to spain or move to france i will i will be live the the pipe dream that me and my mum cos i say i say i say i'm go to be unhappy so i might as well be unhappy in france or spain as oppose to be unhappy here
S0192	yeah do you have too much family around
S0227	no no and it's not that far away
S0192	no
S0227	and you've get skype
S0192	and i mean we'll definitely visit
S0227	yeah it's not that far away i'm not move to korea or something like that it's a quick
S0192	your two sons both like to travel now so that's not gonna be a trouble for us to come and visit
S0227	so
S0192	it will be actually nice i don't have to come back to england when i need a base
S0227	so it sound awful but i have to make some kind of plan
S0192	it doesn't sound awful it sound pragmatic
S0227	yeah
S0192	sound necessary
S0227	yeah
S0192	and both you and i aren't the type of people that think ahead like that
S0227	yeah
S0192	as horrible as it be
S0227	yeah
S0192	you have to think of these eventualities cos when they happen and they will happen you don't want to be catch off guard
S0227	no
S0192	and just spiral out you want to be ready
S0227	yeah
S0192	to be prepare for what you're gonna do i don't blame you for think about it
S0227	do
S0192	uh if you're just go to retire then just get something part time
S0227	hopefully i'll just do my own thing i'll have my pension and then my state pension will kick in
S0192	you can come out and visit me whenever i be
S0227	obviously i'll be more tiny little pension not's go to be brilliant
S0192	no
S0227	i also have half the proceed of the house this will buy me a house or some land
S0192	yeah
S0227	and uh some
S0227	talk about this but they're never go to do it because as you say completely torpedo any possibility um
S0192	they don't have the can at all
S0227	no it's actually
S0192	's suck it all day spend more than their mean i'm pretty sure
S0227	yeah i um
S0192	the conkers be really out
S0227	yes
S0192	it's definitely
S0227	yeah
S0192	i think august be
S0227	the house be the mortgage on the house which be due to be re mortgage be less than forty grand
S0192	so you will have pay off the house
S0227	yeah but i don't know what it's worth now but um and the the house be pay for so what would happen be i would sell the house give a half and erm erm i would readily have ask to use his french house as base
S0192	more than
S0227	no well that's um she have some save but she have get some save she's her parent
S0192	it's tie up in her parent
S0227	she's her parents' house be be i think
S0192	so i mean and aren't gonna be uh too do too poorly
S0227	no they won't they won't anyway erm
S0192	bother me i mean not that i expect an inheritance but i don't feel like i'm gonna get any anything
S0227	you'll get you'll probably get more from my side
S0192	yeah i'm more likely to get something for you i've get quite a few friends now that be pretty much set and not just set for a little bite set for hundreds of thousands
S0227	yeah
S0192	i know she's pretty much go to inherit like a million and these kind of people don't really think about it and that's because you've get it
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean like and i
S0227	yeah
S0192	none none either of us have come from well to do family at all and it be just like the chance of us ever get property or anything like that in this country
S0227	yes
S0192	be impossible therefore
S0227	the only downside to france i understand be that if your if your house make money and you sell it you have to pay some of that in tax to the french government
S0192	yeah
S0227	you don't do that here but that's the only down downside of that
S0192	i mean you live your life dad no i don't expect anything to come back through so
S0227	if there be something there at the end it will be more than my dad leave uh
S0192	sixty quid
S0227	uh that be a cheque for the state
S0192	yeah but i'd rather you live out the rest of your life in happy and try to enjoy it as much as possible than uh than try to leave me
S0227	uh have really get
S0192	i'd appreciate it if you manage to
S0227	that's for his fan
S0192	he didn't need to he have a trade anyway
S0227	no no i know you've get to have the trade he's have to learn that
S0192	yeah yeah yeah
S0227	but he get it from he know back here in school he'd always fancy her uh it wasn't reciprocate she be afraid it take a while he start work for family business uh it take a while before their relationship blossom um and his position erm he rise through the rank erm in the company there become three partner that's his father in law and and and him be partner come on further down the road erm they don't get along with because 's a bite of a maverick he do his own thing and he jeopardize big contract and rise up and he's very embed because um have three sons no daughter oh sorry three daughters no son so he they see as the son they never have plus he's in the business and he's also their son in law so erm we go for a meal last about two weeks ago erm he's become the director of the company he's gotta buy they want to buy their plan be to buy out what they've say to be we're make a director you have two choices you either like it or you leave and we pay you out so be take another loan to buy into the company so at twenty eight he's gonna be a director but i think he's do this because i think very much like his father he feel he's get to be the bread winner he feel while he hasn't say it intimate by she's an doctor and she be clever she get she's now a registrar she get good accommodations from work and she's progress up and he feel i'm just a lift engineer
S0192	yeah
S0227	and the ceiling of that will never be as high as the ceiling as an doctor so
S0192	you're always gonna be compete
S0227	so by come a
S0227	so by become a director of a company with a with about ten to fifteen million pound a year turnover erm he feel more up in status and who can blame him
S0227	well obviously he's get to pay he's gonna have he's he's get strap to a mortgage and he's gonna be strap to another loan for pay buy into the company
S0192	yeah
S0227	so he's gonna be pay his
S0192	but he's eventually save
S0227	in the long in the long run
S0192	through the floor be it
S0227	say i don't mind us do this if this doesn't have any bear on me have my children when i want which be soon
S0192	yeah
S0227	so
S0192	and wait a minute you say he be their son in law
S0227	yes
S0192	so when you marry someone say i marry she'll become your daughter in law
S0227	yes
S0192	that will make her my sister
S0227	no she's recognize as my daughter in law that's your wife
S0192	it's a bite confuse that she's call your daughter and i'm your son
