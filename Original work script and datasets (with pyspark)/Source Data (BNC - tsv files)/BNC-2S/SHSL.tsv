S0073	what be post codeism
S0018	post codeism be something that i read on a mate's website he do like anti youth violence and um we do a track once call you're bigger than your post code because it be all about
S0073	be that the b side to halal what be meat you're look for
S0018	no no no this be one before halal it be like um when we do all the anti war war and error stuff and post codeism be a word i read um a couple of weeks ago on this youth violence thing because it's basically i would imagine you know kind of relate specifically to your endz endz again

S0018	no it's
S0073	if you've get like a nice little middle class retirement
S0018	yeah
S0073	it's quite
S0018	yeah they no they've get a nice quite a large house that it's a it's a detach house so it's you know it's good for them and you know it's they've work all their live for it so
S0073	yeah
S0018	it's different for them for us for me it's different and i'm i'm middle class they're work class so it's uh well i'm work i'm work middle class i be work class now i be middle class and i'm aspire to be a well you know aspire to be marry you know someone in the royal family hopefully
S0073	princess
S0018	princess oh oh god exactly i mean i be already marry to kind of like some kind of weird solihillion mix she she like kind of south ah i shouldn't say this she's from south
S0073	she's from isn't it
S0018	ooh yeah
S0073	be that the eh london equivalent of
S0018	i think it's the asian equivalent of probably it's the only kind of no they're other no there be no i think it be actually yeah it's probably the largest conurbation of middle class asian people but have say you you've get wembley and london be weird isn't it you've get kind of bits of north london wembley um i don't know you know it would be interest to find out where the poshest asian place be i don't think there be many i think there's just like kind of like you know majority be ghettos
S0073	have you
S0018	i don't think there'll be eh
S0073	do you live in london
S0018	for on and off for about six months a year but that's cos my my girlfriend live there after college but uh i can't do london after three i i i've try convince myself that it would be nice to make a move i need to get it out of my system probably will do it for a year at some point just just for a a laugh but i i can't see myself do it for like uh for life
S0073	hmm
S0018	cos be the best place to be um
S0073	do you really think so
S0018	i think so i've i've think about it quite a lot i mean if i have the opportunity to live elsewhere i would take it but that's you know everyone say that but unfortunately that's down to economics
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	if you want to have a second home somewhere good luck cos you'll be work all your life do it if you're a very rich person or you enjoy shit load of money then you can uh you know i suppose you can afford to live anywhere and good luck to you but when you've get family responsibilities when you've get you know like me i've an age grandfather i've get an old get old mum and dad i have a family business and the thing be that i i say that those things be be important they're also very practical as well
S0073	hmm
S0018	i mean i gain a lot of privilege from have family business uh they're a pain in the ass as well but if yeah i mean potentially it would be nice just to do london for a bite 's great because it's get largest amount of um uh i suppose asian people black people within you know kind of the west midlands it's be home for my granddad my dad and me uh
S0073	be your dad bear in
S0018	no he come over when he be sixteen fifteen sixteen
S0073	oh wow
S0018	um so in that way it's kind of yeah and also brum's home i suppose but don't get me wrong i mean if i if i have the moneys i i'd you know i'd go to barcelona or valencia at the drop of a hat
S0073	hmm
S0018	easily easily as you would probably you know
S0073	definitely
S0018	uh or or south of france or you know anything mediterranean like i've get two friends now 's in valencia another friend be in porto
S0073	do you reckon be there to stay
S0018	the thing be you can't hold be a very strange boy he's not he's not all there really
S0073	you be so
S0018	he's not all there he doesn't give much away and he doesn't tell many people much stuff but you know i i i don't at the moment i don't really think i don't know his what want so i think he's just try to be happy and that's and he can afford it he's get a good enough job to be able to do that so yeah i don't think he'll stay there forever uh
S0073	how come he can do his job from valencia
S0018	cos i think a lot of the stuff that he do be correspondence and because he's learn how to um take certain kind of class or or teach certain excuse me certain class to do with uh um you know conflict resolution and and so on very kind of i think i think once you've once you've get kind of a model down for um you know what conflict resolution be or or what you know uh you know kind of uh poverty um uh global development or anti poverty stuff once you've get those kind of things down you can just apply to you know a specific geography and go well right this country's get these problems so a person from whoever beware of this beware of that conflict resolution be about x y and z thank you very much i'll take three thousand pound for that lesson
S0018	or or whatever
S0073	blimey be that
S0018	no no i don't know no no no i don't want to cast aspersions cos i don't really know but i would imagine it's not a fuck peanuts i would imagine it's like fuck proper can i say fuck
S0073	mind your ps and qs
S0018	sorry
S0073	no you can't
S0018	sorry person listen
S0073	well that kind of blimey no wonder you're go to live in valencia
S0018	i be go to swear then i won't but
S0073	there be me with my twenty euros an hour english teach
S0018	well the thing be you know what easy come easy go some people just you know some people be able to no matter what they do kind of wangle things
S0073	hmm
S0018	and it's normally people who be actually very very fuck cunning
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	who be able to do that uh i don't mind say that about any of my mate i have to be cunning now and again we all have to be cunning but i think it's always the ones who be slightly you know kind of a bite more uh you know a bite more cunning who end up warn the mullah
S0073	yeah
S0018	it's about train yourself i suppose to be able to to have that it's a bite of an unsay rule isn't it no one like talk about it but it's true for the wankers who kind of real like real fuck wankers who make shit load of fuck cash
S0018	oh shit
S0073	mind your language
S0018	language sorry again oi slang be part of
S0073	true true true true
S0018	language you know um
S0073	but it's not just slang it's uh expletive
S0018	expletives
S0073	slang
S0018	it be nonetheless
S0073	rude boy
S0018	that's very bad
S0073	you're a rude boy
S0018	that's very bad
S0073	so how's the family business go be be you pretty much
S0018	it's good touch wood yeah
S0073	be you pretty much take over
S0018	no no i'm step back
S0073	hmm
S0018	i've take that's why i take two days off now a week because it's just be exasperate just kind of try to get through like the last four five years it's just like i literally have to get away because psychologically it be just do me damage
S0073	yeah
S0018	because it's just too much it's like every fuck sorry every day come in you know same old you know kind of i didn't have a job description it's basically like you know you come in and you do what i say
S0073	hmm
S0018	and live like that work like that be not it's actually you know de educate me be that a word uneducated me through a period of time because i've learn all of these different kinds of structure and you know kind of how to work within management structure work within an environment
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	then you work walk into a family business and it's
S0073	chaos
S0018	perhaps with the chaos it's like you will do what i say when i say it
S0073	be it your dad
S0018	yeah
S0073	in control
S0018	that's your job and um and even though he i think he doesn't know about management he's never work in a management structure he's a you know he's a he's a self make man so i've kind of try to instil it but i've with the four years i've try to do it i've just give up i just think right when you're ready or when you're older and i can overpower you i'll wait until then until then i'm gonna bugger off air and just do my own thing so uh yeah i'm do two days a week and just do my own like you know just bits of music we're do a hopefully soon uh me and eh toff on inter generational eh relationships within the south asian diaspora of the west midlands
S0073	sound very serious
S0018	it be
S0073	i'm sure the project isn't go to be that i'm sure you're go to pepper it with uh expletives
S0018	oh no no
S0073	and silliness and funnyness
S0018	i'm sure that i'm sure there'll be plenty of expletives
S0073	so
S0018	but we
S0073	so what be you go to do be it music
S0018	we're gonna record um the oral histories of father grandfather father and sons
S0073	uh huh
S0018	compare them uh over pivotal point in their live
S0073	ah
S0018	pivotal religious social political point and try and make up a little map of i suppose uh what it be to be part of the south asian diaspora within and also where there be parallel and differences between those generations
S0073	oh wow
S0018	because there seem there seem to be a lot
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	uh people don't you know that closeness that our father have when they be uh you know kind of wherever they be from africa pakistan sri wherever there be a you know the the family unit be slightly different so we want to see how british society have affect that in a way
S0073	fantastic sound like phd material
S0018	i hope hope a lot of good stuff come out of it
S0018	i hope that it's positive not you know kind of negative really
S0073	be em 's girlfriend no
S0018	it's
S0073	okay ah of course
S0018	but he's he's involve a little bite he's gonna he's gonna help us kinda direct the project a little bite
S0073	hmm
S0018	cos he's
S0073	oh no yeah i bump into and his wife and his baby in the supermarket the other day
S0018	oh alright okay
S0073	i just get their name mix up
S0018	oh right okay do you call him
S0073	no i didn't thankfully
S0073	i didn't say anything i say hi
S0018	oh alright no he's he's cool he's um yeah he's get the little one so i um i don't know i think something just snap like in september october november actually last year cos me and have be talk about our relationships with our father just when we get together for a beer cos it be always something that be grind my gear uh and always something that kind of um he he lose his father awhile ago a few a few years ago and become like you know ultimately the head of the family or something and he have to take on a lot of responsibilities so we have a lot of stuff to talk about in term of you know father figure and so on and um and i just november last year it be dreary horrible outside i just say why the fuck be we why do we talk about interest things and not fuck do it there be so many cunts
S0073	fezel there be so many evil
S0018	there be so many evil people
S0073	people
S0018	out there who manipulate fund in the system to do things that be essentially very you know you know nonsensical why don't we put our head together and actually do something positive um and and and not just earn money ourselves but put something back and um he say well okay let's let's start something up and there's something call the community interest company that you'd now make rather than be uh an out and out imperial capitalistic whore you can actually do something where you incorporate a company and all of the assets and everything that the all the profit of that company
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	itself or or or or a or or the specific role that that company be
S0073	oh it's like a little ngo
S0018	similar to like an ngo yeah but it's it's it's it still allow you to be able to earn a wage and it also allow you to be able to do positive pivotal things for a community
S0073	hmm
S0018	or the community so we've just set one up well we've just set the paper off yesterday to company now so hopefully um hopefully that will that will come off we've call ourselves true form development
S0073	ooh
S0018	which be hmm yes which be which be which i think be be good we take 's name and my name and we just try to uh come up with word that uh
S0073	have the same letter in
S0018	have the same letter in yeah
S0073	ah cunning way to choose a name
S0018	initially we be go to call ourselves tfmd which be and make dollars after epmd but we think that that would be not not in uh not in keep but
S0073	the philosophy of the
S0018	yeah
S0073	philanthropy
S0018	yes yes
S0018	so um
S0073	so what would be the end objective to i mean cos i imagine you do the research and that you do it
S0018	yeah
S0073	but then what would you do with it when you've compile it all and
S0018	hmm well they'll be a couple of things they'll be a maybe a short doc film thing we'll have an exhibition or an event
S0073	hmm
S0018	um we'll be put all of our find online as a kind of online archive
S0073	hmm
S0018	we will then look to probably get our stuff put into archive at at uh library and then off the basis of those four five output we'll we'll see i mean potentially there's part two and part three to this project next year or the year after but we'll have to see if it if it's if it's if it create a buzz within the community if it's something worthwhile otherwise we'll go under and uh and uh and uh yeah but potentially yeah we we we're go to maybe do a few bits of music um take the kind of the bits of um music that an older generation the younger generation like and fuse it together
S0073	oh cool
S0018	uh we'll be do a number of video diaries you know just to kind of in term of um what it's like for um a normal day for a young person and a a normal day for a a person who's slightly older
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	from that community and what else there's just a load of material we're gonna have to trawl as long as people be up for us
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	go through the you know underwear drawers
S0073	and how be you go to source the the participants
S0018	well we're look to source we're go to do a big troll of about a hundred two hundred specific people um because it the community's just too huge we're go to have to poster campaign and so on
S0073	uh hmm
S0018	with a number and that people can contact but um i mean even if we can find between ten fifteen people essentially that should be enough for the project
S0073	hmm
S0018	to be able to i think show effective what the project be set out to do and i'm quite confident we'll get we'll get that but let's let's just hope that people be kind of open um to it so um
S0073	i'm sure they would be people love speak about themselves
S0018	yeah
S0073	don't they
S0018	yeah i'm hop so cos uh you know it's also it's also kind of nice because um in previous project it's just be like oh yeah we're do project blah blah but now because of the family aspect because he's get a little one uh and also because of the fact that um you know want to do a lot more of my own stuff away from the family business we've kind of come together at exactly the right it feel like the right time like hungry to do something so so yeah
S0073	hmm
S0018	hopefully it will be a good a good one
S0073	sound very interest
S0018	hopefully it will be a good one yeah i can i make you a cup of tea actually do you want a tea
S0073	yeah i'd love one thank you i'll just put this on uh pause
S0018	previously live in mosel it be just like what be you do nothing should we have pint yeah end up have four pints each fuck night whatever you every other night
S0073	but that's
S0018	and it's just ridiculous
S0073	i know it seem to be that that's all a lot of british people do for for their leisure time be let's go to the pub and i just get so bore of just go to the bloody pub we're go bell ring tomorrow
S0018	i i get bore of go to the pubs so i go bell ring life's death
S0073	ding dong ding dong
S0018	in
S0073	in you know how could you forget
S0018	yeah babe
S0073	yeah babe um her neighbour do bell ring at one of the church there and he's invite us along hmm hmm ring my bell
S0073	that will be fun fun fun yeah but i know what you mean about the pub thing and the drink thing
S0018	yeah
S0073	cos once you're in a pub it's it's not normal to drink something that's non alcoholic either be it
S0018	but i've also see the i've see the effect on me of booze i've see the effect on people around me i've see the effect of good friends of mine yeah good friends of mine mutual friends on booze um i've actually have to step in on a couple of occasion on like like not just not just people like who who be very close to me but even like even like friends of friends and i feel as though i have the fuck authority now to be able to go i think you've have too much
S0073	yeah
S0018	when it get to the even and you know like at some point in the even like i've have it here a couple of time where like a mate of a mate have come over and be just talk utter fuck drivel and because everyone be just a bite too civil they'll just go oh that's the end of the night the end of the night be gonna be me listen to this cock and i'm not gonna be able to do anything about it and i've just start go you know what you've have enough swing your hook or you've have enough shut up and listen to the people who be funny or who can still put two syllables together
S0073	i know drink people they feel that they have to monologue
S0018	well which be which be fine i mean i've do that but i just i just kind of i i i enjoy the fact that there be someone at least a little bite more compos mentis who's able to say you know something a little bite more interest but the worst thing be when you have you know two or three people who be completely piss which can be funny but when they be either argue against each other or talk utter nonsense it's a bite problematic uh for instance last week i be in london um go to kentish town to meet an old friend of mine
S0073	oh be that where use to live
S0018	yeah she say yeah yeah um so we go to this i be i always say this didn't i the whole race issue and uh he he be like kinda you know after after a meal and you've have a bite of few whiskeys and so on he try convince me that racism come from chimps
S0073	that's right
S0018	and i be
S0073	it's not right but i remember you say
S0018	and i be and i be just like uh we've know each other for age and and i just maybe i don't really know you you know and my my brother be his son's godfather which be very strange for a muslim man um
S0073	but be it actually that much of a contentious
S0018	well yeah it be cos
S0073	statement
S0018	yeah because it kinda well because of the fact that we be actually where it lead from be empire and we start
S0073	oh okay
S0018	then we start talk about racism and what he try and do be to try and shift the subject of the conversation to be you know kind of something that genealogical genealogy
S0073	genealogical

S0018	yeah
S0073	stretch out on the lawn wait to be chuck things off the barbeque
S0018	what i do want to do what i didn't do last summer be the film screen as soon as it get hot
S0073	oh brilliant
S0018	i i've be say it for like a year and a half two years now i've get i've get shiv's projector here he's leave it here
S0073	cool
S0018	so i'm go to hook it up and will do like a you know
S0073	excellent
S0018	we'll do i'll just email you know whoever and every other week it will be someone else's turn they can just choose the film and we'll just run it on and watch it
S0073	brilliant
S0018	and and you know
S0073	my friend have this beautiful country house in just outside of valencia and it be kind of a paint a duck egg blue but very pale pale pale blue em it be beautiful shape it be like shape like of the roof be shape like a wave and on the one of the patios in front there be uh like a perfect screen venue to put chair and table and chill out and uh he project film onto the side of the house in the summer it be brilliant
S0018	that's the vibe
S0073	i know
S0018	that's the well i mean it's not a big house but we can get you know ten people
S0073	where be you go to project onto
S0018	there's a white wall right at the back outside
S0073	ah
S0018	so what i'll do be i'll paint over uh and if i can i may i may like buy a a thingy screen uh a proper projection screen or or maybe just a sheet that be like tensioned
S0073	uh huh
S0018	you can get like i think you can get like it's not silk it's similar to silk
S0073	mm hm
S0018	but it's it's it's it's kind of like that material and you just basically i'll pin it up and we'll just you know put the projector on top of the toilet you know get a get a general extension wire wind me the end
S0073	oh it's that back wall you're talk about the back wall garden
S0018	yeah yeah yeah so we just sit in the back garden and we just watch the back wall
S0073	yay
S0018	and we'll hook up like uh you know like a bite of a sound system to it and get the full surround sound it will be great
S0073	fezel's drive
S0018	yeah yeah absolutely and people can bring their film or you know it's just a dvd player isn't it just wing it on
S0073	do they allow outside film projections in cos that's the one good thing about live in a country where people be use to good weather there's so much more things happen outside
S0018	yeah well i think this be why they stop because it's just the danger of
S0073	mm
S0018	the rain but also because of just red tape there's so much involve in try to get the process actually do then and kind of provisionally put in because they use to do it at em in fact that's a brilliant idea we should do that cos they they do like back in the day they do like a classical movie but i can't remember what it be they do like a really old black and white movie i'm not they should do that again they should start screen that shit
S0073	they do something in the uh what's it call the paul's church in birmingham just before christmas they uh project alfred hitchcock's the bird's onto the wall
S0018	oh yeah
S0073	inside
S0018	yeah
S0073	and that you get bat in the belfry and everything and all the bat be fly around with the bird
S0018	oh yeah

S0073	i guess it make you realise how much you swear
S0018	yeah
S0073	it's funny though that i've notice that you swear like before
S0018	i think it's because of the fact i know i'm be record and i'm kind of subconsciously make the effort to swear actually because i know someone else be gonna have to listen to me swear and it's a bite naughty
