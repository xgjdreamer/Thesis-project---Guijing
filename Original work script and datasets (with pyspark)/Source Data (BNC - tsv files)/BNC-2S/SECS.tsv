S0439	yeah
S0444	i'd go out at the weekend
S0439	mm
S0444	with and his friends

S0439	shit
S0444	and i couldn't see properly
S0439	yeah
S0444	like i be see things a bite i think oh you know the next day it's like ah i'm probably just hungover but okay
S0439	mm yeah
S0444	and be really good at look after me he be like we can get you know you can
S0439	go to the hospital
S0444	we can go to hospital if you want and i be like oh no it should be fine cos you know i'm a bite of a drama queen when it come to overanalysing things so it might just
S0444	it's just a headache you know it's just a hangover
S0439	yeah yeah
S0444	because you know everybody say they get worse as you get older kind of thing
S0444	erm you know so i'm just like maybe that's what it be
S0439	mm
S0444	and erm but it keep get worse and worse and paracetamol wasn't take it away at all
S0439	mm
S0444	and i'd be take it for a couple of i go to the at what point should i stop take the paracetamol who do i go to there's no walk in centre
S0439	really not in
S0444	in mm
S0439	that's shit
S0444	or in the only things that they've get be minor injury units which can't deal with head injuries or anything like that
S0439	yeah
S0444	so i go to the what do i do cos obviously i'm not gonna turn up to a and e because i'm not it's not like blood's spurt out of my ear or anything
S0439	mm
S0444	erm but it be like i keep see like you know when you've get like an ocular migraine
S0439	yeah you can yeah
S0444	like wavy line and dot and stuff but it be like everything's kind of fuzzy and my eye movements just felt a lot slower
S0439	oh
S0444	so it be just a bite like i'm not entirely comfortable with this
S0439	and even when you like you be like that even move your eye hurt yeah
S0444	it hurt like honestly like i get it to like here and it would just hurt
S0439	mm
S0444	cos then what i'd do be i'd hit my neck
S0444	and then i'd they say that even though it be like a small bruise they could tell from where it be on my neck that i'd fall really badly
S0439	yeah
S0444	erm which i have do i'd fall down like step i'd fall to the side of
S0444	it be just gross
S0439	oh
S0444	erm luckily
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0444	it cos i've have concussion before but that be when i be a lot younger i kind of black out i didn't black out but i swear i must've black out at some point
S0439	yeah but lot of rugby players get concussion from like play
S0444	like yeah
S0439	but they carry on and yeah
S0444	exactly and i think that's what that's kind of what it be but none of us could remember if i'd hit my head or not erm but obviously i do
S0439	mm
S0444	or at least part of my face or something so by the time that it get they say right if paracetamol and ibuprofen together don't work go to the doctor so i do and they're like yeah it's concussion you know it's it's you know it's still early days but if it's still there like
S0439	mm
S0444	you know i just i just keep get the and obviously star at the screen's not gonna help either
S0439	no not at all
S0444	but until that point nobody know that it be concussion or anything so i'd just be completely daze for like half the time
S0439	mm
S0444	people just i be like i'm really sorry i can't actually form word but the problem be that
S0439	yeah
S0444	a lot of the things that concussion relate be also chronic fatigue syndrome relate
S0439	oh okay
S0444	like the sensitivity to light the not be able to form word and i be like but this be different
S0439	yeah
S0444	but i can't like tell erm so when it get round to apply for the job
S0439	mm
S0444	i be like
S0439	you weren't really with it yeah
S0444	i'm concuss i can't erm so i didn't end up apply for them anyway
S0439	that's a shame
S0444	but they end up be stop anyway cos of the recruitment freeze so
S0439	ah there's still there's still a recruitment freeze
S0444	no they just start it again
S0439	ah

S0444	i go into that and i'm now at the crossroads where i either really dedicate to market and take the cim diploma and what have you or i start explore product management and see whether that's
S0439	and give it a go
S0444	the way to go and when i explain that i be at a crossroads they seem she seem a bite better about it cos she be like oh yeah well i'm at a crossroads too i can really empathise with that and then it's like mm but you've gotta do what's best for you and i be like well to be honest there aren't any opportunities for progression in market
S0439	mm
S0444	the opportunities they do have for people like and have be cut because of the recruitment freeze so
S0439	mm
S0444	and she be like yeah yeah but i don't want you to think that there aren't opportunities there aren't and she be like that's what we want to talk to you about we want to talk to you about
S0444	take it on and it be like yeah okay but now it's like double the work
S0439	mm
S0444	erm and erm yeah and then it be like well you know all this kind of stuff and it be just like you've gotta
S0439	you can say what i want to hear but
S0444	you've gotta do what's best for you and er and that's what that's what's gonna help you with your promotion next year and i be like yeah well we'll see but
S0439	empty promise isn't it
S0444	mm but because there be so many people take maternity leave in product management come up there be gonna be more roles so
S0439	yeah be anybody else leave
S0444	not at the moment
S0439	that's good
S0444	have get a new job in international

S0439	mm
S0444	of train not even go there
S0439	wow
S0444	erm but yeah hopefully that might force her to leave work at a reasonable hour
S0439	mm
S0444	rather than do two hours of overtime every day
S0439	why be she do that
S0444	just so much to do
S0439	god
S0444	yeah
S0439	i love my job
S0444	how about you so your new job
S0439	my new job er
S0444	when do that happen it hasn't start
S0439	start on the sixteenth
S0444	mm
S0439	yeah start on the sixteenth of november it's all happen so quickly we've have a massive
S0444	mm
S0439	restructure
S0444	mm
S0439	erm and it's literally be a three week turnaround like they announce the restructure we restructure
S0444	that's really good
S0439	i know really quick really good only for uk and
S0444	mm
S0439	which be international
S0444	mm
S0439	erm and basically what they're do be they're just merge the team
S0444	mm
S0439	which be fine but then who be head of global
S0444	mm
S0439	he need a project coordinator to work with him
S0444	mm
S0439	erm and so basically i kid you not two weeks ago we have a meet and we be like all the credit coordinators will will er carry on as usual but they're basically what happen at the moment be we have ieb which be the
S0444	mm
S0439	and then we have the uk school team
S0444	mm mm
S0439	they both kind of work independently of each other despite that we're all under the family of education
S0444	mm mm
S0439	erm they have their own editors project coordinators whatever you wanna call them and then we do our job we don't do any hand on edit but we organise the development editor the copy editor er which be like an review
S0444	mm
S0439	we organise all of that we do some hand on content when it come to the review side but we don't have to do any physical like lot of hand on content and stuff
S0444	yeah
S0439	all fun now they're merge them they've create two departments they've create the project coordinator department and then the content department so the content department be basically gonna be the original uk team but they the uk structure be they be a lot more invest in the content so
S0444	right
S0439	so now what they're gonna do be they're gonna have a project coordinator work with a content specialist
S0444	mm mm
S0439	and the de
S0444	mm
S0439	because we don't really have time to check proof as much as we should and so they're gonna do more things like that but and they be all there be all space for us there be no redundancies make it be really good
S0439	but who be he's really high up in the company he he's completely head of global which work with
S0444	mm
S0439	australia south africa india and he basically work together on e distribution and content to make it global
S0444	mm your train get you
S0439	erm so what i he and he need a project coordinator and he basically they what they say be one of us be gonna have to go and work for him anyway so this be the job who want to apply for it and they open it up and everybody else be really scar to do it
S0444	mm
S0439	they be just like well we don't know what it be cos doesn't really even know what it be at the moment cos his whole team be he kind of work separate
S0444	change yeah
S0439	but there's other like stream of it
S0444	mm
S0439	erm and like no one really know what they're gonna do and he's just like i want you to be really heavily involve in the content at the moment because we're still redo this restructure i'm not entirely sure what your job's gonna be and everybody be kind of a bite put off by it they be a bite scar and that and he be like well we want you to do project management we want you to work with the programme manager we want you to like maybe go to south africa we want you to work with e distribution we want you to
S0444	and
S0439	yeah
S0439	and like they we want you to do schedule and i be just like it just seem like it align to what i be
S0444	mm
S0439	good at originally like cos i have my project management qualification and everything
S0444	mm
S0439	and after the meet everyone's like oh i don't know if i should apply and then within five minutes i'd apply
S0439	and he saw my cv and apparently he be really excite by it he be like and i have a meet with him he's like why why do you do what you do i be like what do you mean he's like well your skillset be so much more advance than what you're do so why be you why be you a project coordinator i be like well because the job i kind of apply for wasn't the job i think i be gonna be do
S0444	yeah
S0439	and he be like so you fell into by accident i be like yes
S0444	yep
S0439	he be like standard
S0439	and so pretty much no one else actually apply for it because they actually realise that i be gonna get it anyway
S0444	ah
S0439	erm like all the managers want me to do it all of the like my like my current manager
S0444	yeah yeah
S0439	she want me she be like i'd put you forward for it anyway like everybody want me to do it and so literally last week he be like yeah 's get the role so i'm gonna be now work in e distribution and global work stream
S0444	mm
S0439	mm
S0444	sound very grand
S0439	it's quite excite
S0444	mm well it's good it's a new challenge it's something new
S0439	mm it's gonna be really different because it's work with things like product families on like like publish systems and stuff like that it's a lot more invest in where the products go after creation
S0444	mm
S0439	which be something i've never do before i've just create the products i've never actually look at where they go afterwards and how what i do as a project coordinator impact upon what happen after cos have things like erm even really simple things like say in the blurb of a book oh there's a cd rom well when it's digital there isn't a cd rom and yet you actually have customers ring in be like where's my cd
S0444	mm mm
S0439	and it's just like what the fuck
S0439	mm
S0444	erm
S0439	so i officially start on the sixteenth but i've kind of be work with him
S0444	mm
S0439	this last week and the girl who's who's originally be work for him be a complete idiot oh my god she's really weird
S0439	like her last day be today but she be somebody who like talk non stop i have about five maybe not even five conversations with her i know her entire life
S0439	she's be engage three time she be pregnant with her boyfriend she's four months pregnant with her boyfriend's baby they've be date for five months
S0444	oh
S0439	they spend every single weekend together
S0444	oh god
S0439	and four nights or and two nights during the week
S0444	oh jeez
S0439	they're inseparable but she's not a she's a complete commitment phobe
S0439	i be like yes okay
S0444	and they're have a kid
S0439	mm
S0444	mm
S0439	and be engage three time
S0444	mm
S0439	erm i kid you not she talk incessantly
S0439	just yabber yabber yabby and her boyfriend apparently work for the and it's all high security and she have to be vet and she can't talk about her job his job and yet she can pretty much spend the entire lunchtime talk about oh he's in the and he's a chemist but i can't tell you what he do but he's a chemist and he's in the erm it's like fuck off like
S0444	so what's she do go to a new job or just
S0439	she can't she can't go to a new job pregnant can she they won't give her maternity leave
S0444	that's what i mean
S0439	so she's move to to be with him cos they don't live together
S0444	mm
S0439	he live in
S0444	yeah
S0439	erm she's move to tomorrow erm
S0439	and she say er and she say yeah well we look at the finance and it seem like it would be it would be i'd get just as much money without work as i would would work i be like that doesn't make any sense you've get you've they've buy a house they've now get a mortgage a baby a mortgage and a relationship after five months
S0444	wow
S0439	and i be like how do that work how can you quit a job and go and buy a house
S0439	i be so confuse i be just like you know when you're just listen to someone and you're like i don't understand
S0444	how
S0439	like you don't even make logical sense
S0439	but she's officially go she leave today
S0444	let's hope it work out for them
S0439	mm her last day be today it be so funny be like can you get her a card and some flower cos i like i be like yeah that's fine erm and he come over he be like i be like who do you want me to sign the card he's like i don't know i don't i be like cos i don't know who know her he's like i don't know who know her
S0439	because she sit on her own she's really like and no one really she doesn't work with anybody cos
S0444	mm
S0439	it's literally just and her like there's no other team
S0444	mm
S0439	and he be like well we could just make up some i be like we can't make up name to put in her card like
S0439	we can't just randomly sign the card ten time so i have to go round my team and ask them to sign it they're like who's this for i'm like do i know no who be she she's that person over there i've never even see her before
S0439	just sign the fuck card look there's a space er fill it

S0444	exactly just seem to be every bloody thing go
S0439	yeah at the same time
S0439	job house
S0444	's move 's move in with the bro
S0439	mm
S0444	that's gonna change things completely it's a different
S0439	do you think
S0444	yeah cos er he's not with his parent anymore
S0439	mm
S0444	so that's gonna change the dynamic
S0439	do you think they'll go out and be more like laddy and stuff
S0444	i reckon so but that will be a good thing
S0439	okay
S0444	in the way that actually have a life because
S0439	mm
S0444	with a three hour round commute
S0439	mm
S0444	he's get no time for a life at the moment monday to friday
S0439	yeah

S0439	yeah
S0444	just the gym and then just chill and it's like okay
S0439	mm
S0444	do you know what i mean whereas and he's get a new job he's get a permanent job now
S0439	oh
S0444	with that's not hang over him anymore
S0439	that's good
S0444	so it's like all like it's kind of like it's not change for me
S0439	mm
S0444	but it'll change how we be cos it's the kind of thing where it's like it's a house it's not
S0439	mm
S0444	you know it's not like you know his parents' you know
S0439	mm
S0444	things have to be quiet or you you know it's the kind of thing where you're on your best behaviour we can just sit and lounge on the couch if we want to
S0439	yeah
S0444	like you know that kind of so that'll be different that'll be different for him but then it's kind of like well you know what like it be get to the point where when when he get this job he be like and i kind of bring up the question i be like so how much be it you'll be earn and it be ten grand more than me and i be like i don't have a problem with him earn
S0439	no
S0444	more than me cos he's in a different industry and that's just the way that it go but i be like i seriously need to get a job that's actually
S0439	what be you on at the moment twenty
S0444	like twenty four
S0439	mm
S0444	i'm not even that but
S0439	that's so bad isn't it
S0444	so
S0439	especially in
S0444	well that's what i mean cos i be like i'm not be funny but if i'm have to pay six hundred and fifty
S0439	that's half a salary isn't it
S0444	a month that's pretty much yeah
S0439	yeah
S0444	when you when you take out like
S0439	that's poor
S0444	other i'm just like i don't even wanna be here
S0439	cos get a nice better pay rise didn't she
S0444	she get about thirty and a half
S0439	yeah
S0444	when she go into product management so when they ask me about salary i say something in the region of that
S0439	mm
S0444	with scope to review it bear in mind the role that i would be do so
S0439	yeah
S0444	it's kind of like
S0439	and i don't know if they'd give you that cos you're an internal and i don't think they'd bump up your salary
S0444	well they they give that one
S0439	oh really
S0444	yeah
S0439	be she on twenty three
S0444	no she be on a little bite more but not mass more
S0439	mm oh okay that's pretty good then
S0444	but i but i basically cos the science team cos i can't say
S0439	mm
S0444	what be you talk about yourself
S0439	mm
S0444	i be like why do you sell yourself short like you i be like i don't know what wage to go for
S0439	yeah
S0444	i can't say thirty five cos that's er twelve grand
S0439	yeah though
S0444	yes the job might you know do that but they kind of like i be kind of you know as i haven't be in product management before i think a product management associate salary
S0439	mm thirty grand's good
S0444	of around that
S0439	i'd be happy with thirty grand
S0444	be you know where it should start
S0439	yeah
S0444	with scope to review it bear in mind the task
S0439	mm
S0444	that i will be execute you know
S0439	yeah
S0444	so you know i think i think that be fine but it be i'm really glad that i get you know i know that you definitely have be say you know change come on now change
S0439	mm
S0444	and then it's like prod prod
S0439	yeah but you like you can you
S0444	but it be a good thing but it be more the kind of thing where
S0439	you have to kind of wait it out a little bite cos obviously you er you couldn't just change job after be ill
S0444	no it's more like of it's i know that i need to do it but the opportunity or the it just didn't
S0439	yeah
S0444	feel like there be ways to do that whereas
S0439	mm
S0444	actually it all end up happen at once something may come of it something may not but
S0439	yeah you never know it's worth try
S0444	er something be well i think the the thing er the thing be now that i know that at least something be change
S0439	yeah
S0444	so my role be change
S0439	mm
S0444	that's you know that's already that's already do
S0439	yep new house
S0444	my house be definitely gonna change
S0439	and i think the privacy might if you say you do go to the annex or something like you do decide to pay a bite more
S0444	yeah the privacy so much better
S0439	the privacy'd be nice especially like if come to stay and stuff like
S0444	yeah
S0439	just that privacy
S0444	just have like i know it sound ridiculous but have a sofa or like
S0439	yeah
S0444	something
S0439	but also like there's not the constant not fear that someone will walk in but you
S0444	it's not like
S0439	cos there's someone always there just like wander around outside and you're just like oh
S0444	exactly so
S0439	mm
S0444	you know i be not i be a people person
S0439	yeah
S0444	so it'll be quite interest to see but it's not like i can't invite people round and be like
S0439	mm no
S0444	everybody round like you know
S0439	yeah
S0444	or if you come to stay it'd be like dude right flat sort do
S0439	yeah
S0444	i mean they've kind of say the kitchen facilities aren't brilliant enough for you to make full meals so you can use the kitchen but
S0439	yeah
S0444	i be kind of like
S0444	i be kind of like do you know what like i didn't say anything i didn't do any email or anything i be just like do you know what i'm just gonna wait until i come back from then i'll
S0439	decide yeah
S0444	decide cos it be just i'm i'm not kid my brain be about to explode
S0439	yeah
S0444	i've be kind of not argue with but we've kind of just be i think because i've be so stress and like that it be just like the the lack of communication or how things have be like be communicate like oh
S0439	do you have an argument or
S0444	yeah but it be a kind of not one that we'd have before but because you know things have be get better in term of communication cos he's not brilliant
S0439	men aren't
S0444	at say stuff
S0439	just they aren't
S0444	so you know he's get better but he's like it's actually through the things that i do that i show you that i care like
S0439	no but the thing be men don't like it's not enough it's not enough
S0444	yeah no and that's what i be say to him and he take it as a criticism and i be like well no it's not a criticism of you because it's you as a person
S0439	it's it's just men in general
S0444	it's just everyone in general and
S0439	yeah
S0444	i'm just say that especially at moments when i'm tire and stress
S0439	yeah
S0444	and i just need that a bite more cos it's like i'm like if you say i look nice or you know
S0439	mm
S0444	it it be the kind of thing where on the wednesday we go out to celebrate his job
S0439	mm
S0444	erm and that have mean that you know by come to his i be do the double the commute in the morning and things like that
S0439	yeah
S0444	and er he he appreciate it but it be another thing i be like you know when i cook for you like you know when you're tire or you're prepare for your interview
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know that's that's i'm more of an action person and i be like that's great but i need some word too
S0439	yeah
S0444	but but it be kind of like
S0439	like be say to me like this week he's be like flirt and stuff
S0439	and i be just like well no offence but you're you're literally should stop communicate like the reason like we didn't go anywhere be because
S0444	you didn't communicate
S0439	you didn't communicate with me like if you'd tell
S0444	mm
S0439	like the reason i pull back and i never really let him in be
S0444	and then you get i think you be gonna he be communicate too much
S0439	yeah but the reason like i kind of pull back and never really like him be because i didn't know that he like me
S0444	mm
S0439	like he never he be like yeah but i do like you like i buy you some lip gloss i be like what the fuck
S0439	like girls er girls need to be tell
S0444	a verbal affirmation it's
S0439	because like and i think er what's confuse for girls be that for most girls the act of sex itself
S0444	mm
S0439	be a representation of love
S0444	mm
S0439	but nowadays it's not
S0444	exactly
S0439	so if you need that verbal affirmation
S0439	you can't just have an action
S0444	yeah it's really weird cos it be like yeah well as friends we weren't ever not insecure but you you never wonder about how you be
S0439	mm yeah yeah
S0444	as friends whereas when you're in a relationship it's like oh well how be we do because you know everybody's automatic assumption about the job have be ah but you'll move in with i'm like hell no
S0439	no
S0444	no no no no no no no like cos i'm like you know what
S0439	no offence that didn't pop into my head at all
S0444	no not yours but i mean like other people who don't know me
S0439	yeah
S0444	as well and have just say oh yeah i'm with and er you know
S0439	mm
S0444	best friends and now we're we're go out and they don't know much more than that
S0439	mm
S0444	erm and they're like oh yeah great you don't have to be long distance anymore and it's like yeah no erm i'd still be live separately establish my own life
S0439	mm
S0444	obviously i get to see him more and blah blah blah but no no
S0439	no
S0444	not right now
S0439	mm
S0444	i i'd rather get myself sort
S0439	yeah
S0444	and
S0439	and just not obviously not that you're in a bad place at all but if like at the moment you've be quite stress and tire and stuff move in with each other at this moment would not it'd just be a recipe for disaster and you'd just end up snap and then you'd yeah
S0444	like er exactly and we both know that we both know that and i'm not be funny but if things go well we've get time to do that
S0439	yeah
S0444	and if they don't then it's a good thing you know we catch it when we do
S0439	yeah
S0444	but you know it's the kind of thing where
S0439	mm
S0444	we be ridiculously slow you know that as much as anybody else
S0439	well yeah
S0444	but it's not
S0439	eight months do it take you to have sex
S0444	nine
S0439	nine months
S0444	no not to have sex to er actually have from from him him think i like you
S0439	a while to have sex though
S0444	from him be like i like you to kind of actually be like you know i want to go out with you that that be a good nine months so that give you a pretty good indication and
S0439	oh yeah i be with you for the whole thing
S0444	you be there you be there
S0439	that be a rollercoaster that one
S0444	hell yeah so you know and
S0439	yeah
S0444	where do you know what with him have a new house a new job you know actually have more of a life
S0439	yeah
S0444	not because he didn't want one but because you weren't able to then that's gonna change the dynamic
S0439	yeah of course it will
S0444	and you know i'd rather get use to that dynamic change than get use to my own dynamic change
S0439	yeah
S0444	and er you know see how cos it could be that you know he move in start become a lad and become a completely different person don't think that would happen
S0444	but do you know what i mean
S0439	yeah
S0444	i become a product manager and that's it it's work work work
S0439	i rule the world yeah
S0444	and it's work work work
S0439	mm
S0444	you know you just don't you just don't know what's gonna happen but
S0439	yeah you just don't know what'll happen but i think that's really you've get a logical way of think about it like i'm glad that you don't just dive in and be like
S0439	we're gonna live together we're gonna be together forever and like that and just no
S0444	i mean you know we we know that i think that's also because he's very logical like he's even more logical than me and i'm not that logical
S0439	mm
S0444	but someone have to be erm but it's more like no it's like there be a lot of people at work like my entire department pretty much all the girls move in with their boyfriends after four months
S0439	really
S0444	yeah all because of different circumstances
S0439	that make me wanna cry yeah
S0444	like you know but i be and they're like oh so so when be you gonna move in i'm like well that's another like year and a half two years at least like
S0439	oh yeah i don't i rush it
S0444	i'm just like i don't wanna rush into it like
S0439	well it's like i like my space my space be nice
S0444	he yeah i like my space he adore his space sort of thing
S0439	yeah
S0444	he's an introvert i'm an extrovert we're opposites like
S0439	mm yeah but i'm an extrovert but i love my space
S0444	that's true that be true introvert extrovert
S0439	yeah just no
S0444	i've definitely become a little bite more introvert
S0439	that's good
S0444	because i've have to be
S0439	mm
S0444	i have to go home and rest
S0439	yeah
S0444	and
S0439	but also i think if you're go out with somebody who's an introvert you can't completely bombard them all the time
S0444	mm
S0439	because they'll just become even more introvert
S0444	yeah i know but
S0439	the more you try and push them the more they'll just retreat so
S0444	exactly but you know we'll just see but i think the good thing at the moment be that i feel there be possibilities
S0439	good
S0444	and that the world isn't close off to me and to be honest the fact that everybody's be like you're great at what you do and
S0439	mm
S0444	and they're like yeah but people think really highly of you and it's not gonna notice where people like
S0439	mm
S0444	the people higher up in the that's great erm and that's all happen while i've be ill and
S0439	yeah
S0444	like it be like on wednesday i meet up with some of the another person in the science team who'd also kind of give me a few quick pointers
S0439	mm
S0444	erm cos they'd have a product management interview recently
S0439	yeah
S0444	and she be like yeah but we want you back like
S0439	yeah
S0444	we want you back and we we we want you with us when you be ill and we didn't care that you be ill
S0439	we still want you yeah
S0444	we we just
S0439	risk be if you accept this job and it's not in
S0444	yeah
S0439	it's not stick in oxford
S0444	it's not in oxford it's london
S0439	oh that's good
S0444	definitely london
S0439	cos i think i think
S0444	cos it's
S0439	i think
S0444	no i couldn't do another job if it's in that be
S0439	yeah stick in oxford you'd be stick in oxford for another like a few like two years
S0444	like i say like i've pretty much say to myself obviously it depend what job come up
S0439	mm
S0444	but if there if there be a flurry of job that happen and they're in london i'm like
S0439	yeah
S0444	but everybody be like oh would but would you move to with your current job i'm like no not a chance
S0439	no
S0444	it doesn't
S0439	no commute it doesn't work
S0444	er not
S0439	you don't wanna spend two or three hours of your day live on a train
S0444	but also if i be in the londonoffice but my my entire department's in i've be do the work in
S0439	mm
S0444	this week and it's just not
S0439	yeah
S0444	effective because you haven't get load of conversations with people
S0439	yeah
S0444	there's nobody in there in
S0439	no
S0444	you know in who do market apart from but he work on a different thing so yeah it's kind of like i dunno
S0439	yeah
S0444	i i'm not gonna move to there isn't if it be the kind of thing that i be like i dunno marry with kid
S0439	mm
S0444	and a lot lot older
S0439	yeah
S0444	then yeah maybe i'd stick in london because i have to and
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know i'd just deal with the grip you know but i don't have to
S0439	no
S0444	so
S0439	there's no point do something like that if you yeah if it's not necessary
S0444	not necessary like there'd have to be a lot there there'd have to be a lot of reason for me to move to london
S0439	mm
S0444	and feel secure
S0439	yeah
S0444	outside of work to make it
S0439	cos the thing with work in london be that you have to make friends and it's a very big place
S0444	it's a hard place to make friends
S0439	that's the thing like it's so big and everyone's like oh you'll meet load of people but because it's so big i actually think a lot of people get lonely because they don't know how to make friends
S0444	it's so and that's one of the things i just the main thing with people in london loneliness
S0439	yeah
S0444	but erm yeah but we shall see
S0439	yeah you'll be fine
S0444	everything be change for everyone
S0439	mm

S0444	so will there be a round two and three of the after party
S0439	what mm
S0444	mm i'm try not to be like you're just like oh
S0439	she's upstairs she won't know she doesn't hear erm he want to us to meet up again and it doesn't bother me like it's kind of just like best friends who have sex
S0444	oh oh oh oh oh
S0439	no that's not a grey area
S0439	you be in a grey area cos you like him
S0444	yeah true
S0439	i'm not in that grey area
S0444	but be he in that grey area that's the thing in
S0439	i don't know i don't think so
S0444	er
S0439	i've tell him i don't want anything
S0444	yeah but that doesn't mean anything
S0439	but there's no pressure and i don't think
S0444	mm
S0439	that's what we both like there's no pressure
S0444	yeah and that's what and i be kind of say as well
S0439	i think there be so much pressure on your on you two to be together
S0444	er it's it's the kind of thing where both of us turn round today cos er it it wasn't the kind of thing where we be argue but it's just that kind of things be settle
S0439	mm
S0444	and i be just like oh okay but i be have a terrible time like basically be shout at
S0439	by him
S0444	by no no no
S0439	oh
S0444	not by him by work people
S0444	in the middle of train like over email and all this kind of
S0439	shit
S0444	like be like it's the market execs fault and this be be send to like the biggest people in the business
S0439	and they're blame you
S0444	yeah and it's not my fault
S0439	shit
S0444	and it's nothing to do with me well it be something to do with me but it's not my fault
S0439	that's appal
S0444	so basically luckily my manager step in
S0439	yeah so your line manager i be think that in my head literally that moment
S0444	step in and be like
S0439	fuck off
S0444	to be fair it's take everybody by surprise and there be reason for this this this this this
S0439	yeah
S0444	and then come up to me today and be like just to give you the context of that and i be like that's fair enough but after everything that be go on i be like i really do not appreciate that
S0439	and also via email be just so unfair
S0444	well i be at a train course but it be just that kind of oh god it be that kind of thing where like yeah i don't know but anyway so i be just have a really really
S0439	bad day
S0444	yeah and erm then erm but it be the kind of thing where like and i be say today to each other kind of you know i want us but without that you know i want it to be like it be when we be friends in the way that there wasn't any pressure or measure of the relationship obviously there's gonna be that
S0439	yeah
S0444	from time to time but there's just be a lot of kind of
S0439	but do you wanna know what the massive difference be
S0444	what
S0439	you've get something to lose
S0444	that's the thing
S0439	that's the pressure like at the moment
S0444	that's the thing and the pressure come from that and that's the reason for the verbal affirmation because otherwise i'm like
S0439	yeah
S0444	be we at risk of lose things
S0439	yeah
S0444	and i think that yeah
S0439	that's the big thing for me like that's the thing that
S0444	and that's exactly what it be and i be just like
S0439	and er the moment you put a label on it
S0439	it's you've get something to lose like at the moment it's fine like
S0444	mm
S0439	i know that i'm fine without it doesn't bother me at all you know like i know that without him i can function perfectly fine
S0444	mm
S0439	erm and it there's no pressure on it and we're happy and it's comfortable and we can do that and carry on as friends and there's no there's nothing confuse in it
S0444	mm
S0439	the moment you say well actually i wanna be with you again let's be together
S0444	mm
S0439	be the moment the pressure happen because there's that pressure to keep it go
S0444	mm
S0439	and it and it's that's that's where i think my downfall be it's just you've get something to lose
S0444	mm
S0439	and therefore there's the risk
S0444	mm so yeah we're screw aren't we
S0439	yeah
S0444	okay we're just gonna end up live together aren't we when we're old
S0439	yep
S0444	cool as long as you've get
S0439	woo

S0439	yep
S0444	that's okay then
S0439	yeah but you and 'll be alright
S0444	yeah it's just it's just one of those things where i
S0439	yeah you will have an argument every now and again
S0444	it take work it take time but in the end if all go well then mm that'll be what it will be and it's the kind of thing where it's like look you know we we do the brave you know we do the brave thing eventually
S0444	but you know cos i be like well why do we do the thing
S0439	mm
S0444	now er cos i ask him while we be on the coach cos before i be like i don't know why i just didn't ask you out

S0444	so
S0439	and like
S0444	i don't know it happen the way it happen you can't change it and i
S0439	yeah

S0444	it's not her fault
S0439	yeah and be like oh well you're get to thirty and like you really should be have children but no offence i don't actually think you'd be a very good mum anyway and like
S0444	fuck off
S0439	yeah and she say and like you really should come home you know you've only get a few months leave in england i don't understand why you don't bother come home now like why be you gonna wait until june why prolong it just come back now and she's like woah and she's like and also when you go and come back like don't move to i know you want to move to but you only wanna move to cos like your friend live there and you know you can't live your life through your friends but you know family's so much more important like we're important to you like you've get to prove that we're important and be like wow this be my birthday and you're just tell me that i'm gonna be a shit mum i'm nearly thirty and that my life be crap like wow and she just spend pretty much her whole birthday cry
S0444	mm
S0439	but no i be like what a bitch
S0444	total projection
S0439	mm yeah that's what i say to i be like you're she's so unhappy with what she what she what she's get but she's project it onto you
S0444	mm so when be you go
S0439	when be we go if
S0444	june
S0439	all go well june 's get to be out of the country on june the nineteenth
S0444	so what be you think be you think you're gonna see how this job go
S0439	yeah
S0444	and maybe do it for three months or
S0439	yeah exactly i'm gonna see how this job go and if i enjoy it and stuff like er my plan be still i'd like to go i don't really think i don't see why the job would stop me
S0444	no
S0439	unless it go really well erm but also this might be the opportunity that i can move to australia branch so it's like you know if i make connections there be that
S0444	yeah
S0439	erm even if it's just for like kind of like temporary contract
S0444	mm
S0439	erm but i still i think i'd still like to go like i think if i don't i'd regret it and i just keep go round and round
S0444	you'd rather do that other course
S0439	i still would like to do psychology it's just so confuse there's just so much i wanna do and not enough money to do it
S0444	well why don't you give yourself the time until it come to crunch point where you have to make a decision
S0439	well that's what i be think
S0444	when when be the crunch point in term of when be you in your head think
S0439	well
S0444	i need to book ticket by this point or be that
S0439	i don't really have one
S0444	that's not really a factor
S0439	just i can just book them whenever erm 's yeah 's get to be out the country by june like er june the nineteenth cos she i think she want to go travel around europe first
S0444	oh okay
S0439	cos she's get to basically she's get to be out of england but she doesn't have to be out of europe like she can go anywhere essentially
S0444	oh how long be that for
S0439	but she's get ninety days
S0444	ninety okay
S0439	ninety days per country but she obviously she's not gonna spend ninety days per country
S0439	that's how many that's how you've get to be out of the country by by the end of that that point maybe
S0439	so i think she's gonna try and make the most of that and go to just like round europe i've already do quite a lot of europe
S0444	mm yeah
S0439	so i don't really need to so i will see yeah when she be ready to go back to oz
S0444	cos it's not it's not like you have to follow her straightaway
S0439	no no that's no
S0444	you get you you can see how it go like
S0439	exactly and
S0444	even if it's like july or
S0439	yeah like that doesn't bother me
S0439	i'd still like to go i think
S0444	mm
S0439	erm i think it would i've be really want to do something like that for age and it just seem like a good time and i think this job'd be good in term of open up
S0444	close doors
S0439	close doors and meet load of people and
S0444	impress them
S0439	exactly so
S0444	you could always say i'm go to australia for two weeks do you want me to add on a week in australia to work
S0439	mm mm yeah so
S0444	cos if they like you enough they'll probably say yes
S0439	exactly if i make an impression then boom but cos this like erm this job the thing with my other job be that you couldn't go anywhere this job can actually go somewhere technically if i want to the only person above me be
S0439	and he's the director of global like i'm not i'm not say

S0439	i could if i want to go higher up if i want to go higher up in term of the board and stuff it's a good place to meet people and to do things and to get exposure so that's yeah that's something i didn't consider
