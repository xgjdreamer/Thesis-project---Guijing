S0238	right i'll just start that erm
S0239	okay
S0238	i believe you don't have coffee
S0239	erm i do actually i be gonna ask you erm but i've only get hotel coffee
S0238	what do that mean
S0239	well it's coffee i've steal from hotels
S0238	right okay so
S0239	erm
S0238	if in other word instant no i'll go with tea in that case
S0239	oh oh okay
S0238	erm cos that's one of the things that set my stomach off instant coffee
S0239	oh right mm
S0238	i mean to be honest
S0239	mm
S0238	any kind of coffee do but i love real coffee so i normally have one in a morning
S0239	okay
S0238	so i suppose i'm say when we go out can we go somewhere where i can get an espresso
S0239	yeah i'm sure we can find somewhere i'm er mm
S0238	i i seem to i i have that vague memory erm that you be a tea drinker and you i think the last time i come here
S0239	oh
S0238	i stop off for an espresso en route
S0239	oh okay
S0238	fairly soon
S0239	you're one of those be you
S0238	i'm one of those
S0239	oh okay
S0238	well i actually i've actually get an espresso machine i mean i make filter coffee as well but
S0239	mm
S0238	i reach a point where and i think this be be menopause as well where i couldn't taste the filter coffee and i be make it stronger and stronger and stronger and i still couldn't really taste it
S0239	oh right
S0238	so i think right i'm gonna buy an espresso machine and see if that help
S0239	oh yeah a lot of people have them haven't they
S0238	and actually it doesn't make it any stronger than i make filter coffee
S0239	oh right
S0238	but it use less coffee to do it
S0239	oh dear
S0238	so you save have to constantly replenish your coffee supply but but i make
S0239	but i er
S0238	a pot for of for four and just drink it
S0239	oh right
S0238	in a breakfast mug so that's how i like my coffee
S0239	oh so you're a serious coffee drinker
S0238	i be a serious coffee drinker
S0239	well look if nothing else we can stop off at a costa on the way home how about that
S0238	well yeah or
S0239	or whatever let's just get the milk in actually
S0238	right oh yes
S0239	it's the milkman
S0238	i be gonna say the excitement of have a milkman
S0239	so it's so nice to have milk leave on your doorstep hurray
S0238	yes yeah i mean my mum still have her well i'm not sure whether it's a milkman or a milkwoman but erm
S0239	it it take me age to erm get him because i didn't know how to contact him
S0238	yes
S0239	other than get up at half past five in the morning and intercept him
S0238	yeah
S0239	but in in the end they go online so
S0238	right
S0239	so it's milk and more
S0238	yes i i just think
S0239	mm
S0238	that we're i don't think there be one where i live i've never hear or see anything
S0239	well there may well be erm i i didn't know but there's this website milk and more dot co dot uk
S0238	right
S0239	that you go on and it'll tell you if they're in your area and then you can just organise it and if you're you're go on holiday you can tell them online and then
S0238	right
S0239	just pay by direct debit so
S0238	oh right i mean
S0239	i mean it's a bite more expensive but
S0238	i don't know that it's worth it because i don't think that i drink enough milk
S0239	ah you're not a rice krispies fiend then
S0238	erm well as i say
S0238	i do have cereal every morning but i'm not a rice krispies fiend no
S0238	erm
S0239	so you have cereal do you want cereal
S0238	er i've get this with me with be all bran
S0239	oh okay
S0238	erm because i didn't think you'd necessarily have a bran cereal
S0239	i've only get
S0238	erm
S0239	i've only get corn flake i'm afraid
S0238	erm
S0239	or weetabix
S0238	oh i'm quite happy to have this
S0239	okay
S0238	erm it would mix with it would possibly mix with a few corn flake but it wouldn't mix with weetabix that would be a very peculiar bowl
S0239	well do you want corn flake with it
S0238	erm i think it's probably that if you've get some bread as well i think i'm probably fine with just just what i've get here
S0239	oh yeah yeah yeah sure
S0238	er it's not a huge amount
S0239	i'll have some toast though
S0238	you don't need a huge amount of all bran but er i always carry it with me when i travel because in fact i think that's probably what i buy that little plastic thing for i take it into hotel din room and mix all bran with the hotel's muesli and things like that because they don't often have i mean sometimes they have bran flake in this country but abroad they don't usually have it at all
S0239	yeah they're not into be they when we go to italy they serve cake for breakfast
S0238	oh
S0239	love it
S0239	he love cake
S0239	that's what he have for his er
S0238	right
S0239	i don't know what it be
S0238	i mean that look fairly gritty but i'm you can't
S0239	mm
S0238	you can't tell without read the the thing on the packet that say i've get quite adept at at look at how many how much fibre per hundred grams to know to be able to compare one with another
S0239	oh okay oh right
S0238	erm and it's surprise how quite how muesli be actually quite low
S0239	in bran
S0238	mm
S0239	oh right
S0238	it's it's well in fibre
S0239	yeah it's it's probably one of these things that have get fashionable isn't it
S0238	if all bran be
S0239	people think it's good but it isn't
S0238	twenty four per hundred grams muesli be about six
S0239	oh right okay
S0238	on i mean obviously it vary depend on the muesli
S0239	yeah
S0238	but it's not something that
S0239	from a mark kind of er
S0238	you know yeah
S0239	thing
S0238	but a lot of the things like
S0239	can you plug the toaster in there
S0238	erm
S0239	shove it on there
S0238	yeah
S0239	and then i can just er have it close to you then
S0238	yeah a lot of the things like erm bran flake and i buy i keep a range of things in because it's more interest to have different ones every day a lot of them be actually a lot better than than muesli
S0239	mm erm oh right i haven't get any honey i'm afraid you mention you like honey last night
S0238	oh it's alright
S0239	well it's get a bite old so but next time you'll have your own when you have your bee thing so
S0238	right er well yes
S0239	well i've get some jam i i get this be a farmer's market actually where we go last night it be
S0238	raspberry and lime oh
S0239	yeah they take up all those roads once a month and anyway we go up just for just for you know just for a morning out really and er get that but er help yourself erm
S0238	right
S0239	i've get get some more milk here somewhere i do buy some extra in case you be a rice krispie fiend so
S0239	well help yourself
S0238	well actually i've give myself a huge that be a huge portion of all bran i'm not sure that i can actually eat all that
S0238	mm take a little bite of it out it's hard to judge when it's be in that but i should know by now that i don't quite eat the whole little container
S0239	you can yeah don't want an egg or anything like that
S0238	no i'm fine
S0239	here's a knife for you
S0238	i see we get through quite a few mug yesterday

S0239	but then this be like oh well i'm gonna try and make it and i think oh oh i think i'll try and make it as well and it be back in 2009 so we do go but it be very difficult because it be right in the middle of exam board you know
S0238	mm
S0239	so i have to bet my boss i have to move move one of my exam board really beg him then i have a welsh exam on the thursday no first of all tuesday we go to a take that concert

S0238	i don't really no i'm not
S0239	oh okay so they
S0238	i'm not big on wed customs er even in this country let alone in other countries
S0239	er well i only know through friends really that's that's the only reason i know what they be talk about but anyway you'd go and they have like a a get together the night before so maybe it's in a restaurant or it could be a barbecue or something you know so we go there and it be absolutely hammer it down in the fog luckily have a sit nav so i think we'd still be drive round now you know so we get there and then i think i come back on monday morning and go straight to another exam board when i
S0238	mm
S0239	when i get back like literally from the airport so erm but it be really good i'm glad i go
S0238	mm
S0239	and you know i get back in touch with and i've see a fair bite recently erm and we go over there to new york the follow year because
S0238	right
S0239	you know the
S0239	only have a weekend for the wed so we think well we'll go over for a longer stretch and catch up properly so
S0238	mm
S0239	mm i do go it's erm where we be
S0238	so
S0239	mm
S0238	do you like new york
S0239	mm i do i do and i'm not one for cities but i don't think i'd like to live there
S0238	mm
S0239	but there seem to be so much go on there
S0238	mm
S0239	i feel like there's load to explore you know and i think because er although i be a tourist i be stay a local so it's quite nice to hear
S0238	mm
S0239	what what they do
S0238	yes
S0239	in the city cos i mean be involve with the high line which i i'd never hear of but it's erm an old railway that they use to use to transport goods across new york
S0238	oh
S0239	and it's it's high up you know it's one it's the first storey
S0238	mm
S0239	i i guess it's one storey high
S0238	mm
S0239	and then this little train would go and of course it have be derelict since the early eighties so erm anyway she get involve with a group that be restore it and they do all sort of thing there be a bite of fundraise erm but mainly they be write to people and you know ask for permission to do things and and eventually google get involve and it all get fund and
S0238	mm
S0239	and now it's like a little garden er although it's so it's probably it's probably er hardly as wide as this kitchen really or
S0238	mm
S0239	about as wide as this kitchen but it go for miles you know so
S0238	yeah
S0239	so they they've do it up with er tree and
S0238	it's a long finger
S0239	it's a long finger yeah and people come out of offices and erm hang out on it you know at lunchtime or after work or whatever
S0238	mm
S0239	mm
S0238	well that's a nice yeah
S0239	so you know stuff like that you well i'm not say you'd never know about it but you know it's local knowledge really
S0238	mm yeah
S0239	mm and it's finish now so more people know about it
S0238	no i just i wonder cos cos as really enthusiastic about new york sort of go and he think it be one of the best cities in the world and then i remember my supervisor at university who okay wasn't
S0239	mm
S0238	wasn't american you know say every time he go to new york as he as as the plane approach the city he could feel his buttocks clench
S0239	oh
S0238	and i think that be about the security
S0239	mm
S0238	more than anything else that he just felt it be a dangerous city erm but
S0239	yeah well
S0238	still it be quite amuse
S0238	from a slightly different viewpoint
S0239	yeah i mean i can see why it it would be a bite overwhelm you know it it it's so big and there's so much go on
S0238	mm
S0239	and i kind of assume central park be you know a park you know
S0238	mm
S0239	which it be i i have no idea it be so incredibly massive
S0238	yeah
S0239	you know it go block up it's about sixty block
S0238	me
S0239	you know where live you could get into central park from where she live and and it she be out you know have to take the train from town up to her house
S0238	right
S0239	erm so it really be massive
S0238	mm
S0239	mm but erm i be gonna go back erm but she's move out to new jersey now
S0238	oh well you could go to new jersey
S0239	very inconsiderate but yeah yeah yeah i can go to new jersey
S0239	but it be really handy when she be in new york you know
S0238	yes yes
S0239	yeah but there there be no fabric shop in new well there there be some but there wasn't like a lot of the fabric for love quilt from walmart
S0238	oh
S0239	erm yeah fabric's really expensive here but in walmart they do it's not only inexpensive fabric they do fabrics you can't really get here like erm dizzy princesses and like kids' fabrics really which you can get
S0238	oh right
S0239	but sometimes they're ten pound a metre here
S0238	ouch yes
S0239	yeah and walmart they do them for i get some it be like seven dollars for two yards so
S0238	mm yeah
S0239	that's enough for a quilt
S0238	right
S0239	so i bring back as much as i can
S0238	mm yeah
S0239	and and i go to america erm earlier this year and i say to him right
S0238	right
S0239	when you come back i'm gonna put all this princess fabric in your case oh alright then so lucky they didn't stop him at customs he would have i mean it's not illegal but
S0238	but no it would have look a bite strange
S0239	do you want some toast then
S0238	yeah why not
S0239	yeah erm
S0238	yeah
S0239	yeah help yourself
S0238	right
S0239	i'll get you a plate yeah er mm
S0238	just put that to one side
S0239	be the bed the bed okay i can put
S0238	yeah i have i have yes absolutely fine
S0239	you sleep okay oh right i've never sleep in that bed so yeah
S0238	the other thing be my bed be against the wall but it's get a frame so the actual mattress be a bite away from the wall and i do end up
S0239	oh
S0238	this morning
S0239	a bite more
S0238	i turn over and kick the wall with my leg
S0239	oh
S0238	but that be my fault
S0239	well so long as you didn't headbutt it
S0238	no no
S0238	mm do it go in that way
S0239	yeah any way
S0238	right
S0239	mm
S0238	now you didn't ask me how i like my toast for all you know i like it either very
S0239	oh
S0238	very mild or very un or even burn you don't know
S0239	oh no that's true there we be you and pop it there
S0238	it's
S0238	well well since i don't know how your toaster work i have absolutely no idea whether that number be right
S0239	oh well i i don't know either to be honest i it seem to change very time i do toast
S0238	i find that as well
S0239	mm yeah
S0238	that i've i i well mind you sometimes i'm do bread straight from the freezer
S0239	mm
S0238	which of course do need longer erm but it's very unpredictable yeah
S0239	oh
S0238	no i we have this thing in our house my mother like her toast definitely with burn and i like mine what she call hot bread
S0239	oh well you'd better press a button when when you smell it
S0239	it's more than hot bread yeah i i toast one of those roll there
S0238	mm
S0239	it seem to catch you know so it's
S0238	yes
S0239	burn after a couple of minutes really
S0238	well again it's not that easy to find a toaster with slit wide enough to take some wider thing i like muffins and crumpets and my old toaster wouldn't take them
S0239	take them
S0238	so i have to do them on the grill which take forever with an electric grill
S0239	mm yeah yeah yeah mine take age to warm up actually
S0238	mm
S0239	yeah
S0238	well i be bring up with a gas grill which be hugely more efficient
S0239	mm and instant
S0238	exactly yes
S0239	mm
S0238	erm
S0239	oh i can hear my fish feeder go
S0239	really good actually it turn round and food come out and
S0238	yeah so how be that
S0238	program be it just some sort of timer
S0239	yeah you can put in the timer and you can tell it how big a portion you want
S0238	oh
S0239	and how many time a day
S0238	right
S0239	and what time of day
S0238	so be this something you'd buy from a pet food shop
S0239	so for a pet i guess so i i get it off ebay but
S0238	oh right
S0239	yeah but yeah
S0238	yeah i
S0239	yeah
S0238	buy everything off ebay
S0239	mm
S0238	you know erm er and it's just that's it's another world to me
S0239	oh you've not be on ebay
S0238	i join in order to buy when i be fly to buy a a navigation computer because i couldn't really afford to buy a new one erm and i and somebody say well i could have afford to buy a new one but someone say why don't you go online because it's the sort of thing where people either they're upgrade or they've they've try fly for a bite for a hobby and then decide they didn't want to continue so it's the kind of thing that do get sell you know
S0239	oh mm
S0238	erm i get that that
S0239	i mean to ask you about that last night i know there be something i be not ask you about the fly but i think you be just have lessons when you be here last
S0238	mm
S0239	yeah
S0238	yeah i've stop now erm i'm really glad i do it it be one of those things i you know i say i would have have aeroplanes on my quilt
S0239	oh yeah that's right
S0238	i i've be a biggles fan since i be ten erm
S0239	oh
S0238	and when i be at school my friends and i you know we all want to learn to fly and obviously you just think it's too expensive i can't possibly do it
S0239	mm
S0238	and be actually not that far from where i live you know
S0239	mm
S0238	and i be drive past one day and there's a there be a a fly club that use the airport's runway but it's on the other side of the runway from the the actual airport and i be drive past some day there be a sign outside say trial flight from whatever the price be and i think i'm gonna ring them up and find out a bite more about it
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm because you know this be it's probably about six years ago now i'm not really sure
S0239	mm
S0238	erm but you know i be quite sort of settle financially and i do have a bite of money and think i might be able to afford to do something and
S0239	mm
S0238	they have sort of open even once a month when you can go along and ask question so i go along to one and start have lessons and for quite a while i be get really really nervous before i go
S0239	mm
S0238	it be interest but erm and then i actually i change the instructors and i this really nice guy who be a part time instructor and part time farrier
S0239	farrier
S0238	as you as you be horse shoe
S0239	oh
S0239	oh okay
S0238	so there's quite a lot of race stable up in north yorkshire so he he sort of get up at the crack of dawn and and shoe a few horse and then come down and teach people how to fly in the afternoon
S0239	i didn't actually know there be still blacksmiths
S0238	no i didn't but well because
S0239	mm
S0238	race horse need race plat on when they're race so he's i think he's change the i don't know i don't know i didn't really ever ask him we be talk about plan rather than horseshoe but
S0239	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	but anyway erm and he be great because he understand that i be do it for fun and i didn't want to get my i couldn't get my licence cos i get air sick and you can't pass the medical if you be regularly fly with medication
S0239	oh okay
S0238	and i couldn't fly without
S0239	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	so i have a long chat with them and when i actually go for a medical and talk to the doctor and erm we look at options and and
S0239	and they say no
S0238	i decide well i'm not that bother about get a licence anyway i didn't really that wasn't really why i be do it i couldn't imagine ever feel confident enough to
S0239	fly on your own
S0238	fly on my own really
S0239	oh right
S0238	no
S0239	yeah
S0238	so i couldn't you need to pass a medical before you could go solo so i never go solo
S0239	mm
S0238	and i would have be just terrify but this guy be be great and we'd go up and he'd be sit in the plane go don't we live in a fantastic county as well look down to it spread below
S0239	ah
S0238	you know and it be just
S0239	he just let you
S0238	and
S0239	get on with it and
S0238	well
S0239	mm
S0238	i learn quite a lot i mean i learn navigation be really interest and i learn quite a lot about that and and you know we fly different rout each time and he let me work things everything work everything out and
S0239	mm
S0238	i never get very good at land which be a lot more difficult than take off and some quite a few time he end up have to take over at that point
S0239	mm
S0238	but i do sometimes do it myself
S0239	oh ah my toast be ready
S0238	yes
S0239	you
S0238	i deduce that
S0239	turn it off
S0238	er and oh
S0239	it'll go off now
S0238	and er then he get a proper job with jet2 i think it be and
S0239	oh eh okay
S0238	and
S0239	oh your low what a budget airline
S0238	well i mean something like that yeah but but you know to be a proper pilot and
S0239	let's use the door as a fan
S0238	yes and the guy who take over be a very good instructor but he never he be very serious and he never quite get the idea that i didn't want to be push and every time we go he be push me to do something more and i just felt under pressure and i wasn't really enjoy it any more
S0239	yeah
S0238	and it be when i be start to think about sell me house
S0239	mm
S0238	and of course i be spend quite a lot of money on this you pay it be you pay per five minutes rather than per hour so if you be and if you do an hour and five minutes you pay for an hour and five minutes not two hours if you see what i mean
S0239	oh
S0238	so it be a it it be a really good i think a lot of place be not like that you know
S0239	and they make for an hour you mean or
S0238	i think yeah er
S0239	right or two hours when you're gonna be
S0238	and then it's get yes exactly
S0239	right oh gosh mm
S0238	erm well one drawback of course be be really high so the weather be often not good enough and if you're fly like me it's visual flight rule you you've get to have the visibility so you've get to be able to
S0239	mm
S0238	you can't be fly low you can't you're not allow to fly in cloud
S0239	right
S0238	i mean well i don't mean in a cloud
S0239	oh so you've get to have a
S0238	i mean you've get to be under the cloud so there's get to be a reasonable a reasonably high cloud base
S0239	i see
S0238	erm and so every time you book a lesson you ring up an hour beforehand to say be the weather okay and even sometimes when you're look at the sky and you think it be they say well actually
S0239	there's cloud come in
S0238	or it's really really bumpy or you know which wasn't good for me and all sort so
S0239	mm
S0238	you i only end up fly about one time in four or five that i'd actually book
S0239	mm
S0238	which i find quite stressful i like timetables
S0239	yeah
S0238	and like know what's happen yeah
S0239	oh no it's it's much the same with astronomy you know you plan
S0238	mm
S0239	you plan all your kit and you're like right this be what we're do and then the night come and sometimes you're even on the field i mean it come over
S0238	yeah
S0239	cloud out you know i use to look at the satellite picture before go out
S0238	mm
S0239	i use to have a little email group and i'd send one email and they would bounce it to everyone in the group
S0238	mm
S0239	and erm i'd i'd more time than not i'd say erm sorry guy it's just cloudy or it's rain or or whatever you know
S0238	mm
S0239	like yeah it's just unpredictable isn't it mm
S0238	but as i say i'm really glad i do it
S0239	mm oh yeah oh definitely
S0238	i do it i do it for about
S0239	mm i think it's brilliant
S0238	three three and a half years
S0239	mm absolutely brilliant cor
S0238	and you need as i say you learn a lot
S0239	i dunno if i er i dunno if i'd do it oh maybe i would yeah mm
S0238	therefore fly and of course if you're fly from er a proper airport like that rather than a little sort of club you you're talk to the same control tower as all the real pilot
S0239	mm
S0238	so you can hear what everybody else be say it's that's really interest as well
S0239	i think they do it in swansea that's that's swansea airport have close it well well not close but it's private again what happen be it be erm basically a private airport then some guy some entrepreneur decide he be gonna make it into a a proper airport
S0238	mm
S0239	and it be really good actually but there be some quite small plan so he advertise
S0238	mm
S0239	for flight attendants that be five foot three and under
S0239	cos it be that that short he didn't want six foot women in you know bang their head
S0238	oh
S0239	so it be fun erm and then indeed they start flight they have one to jersey one to dublin one to newcastle and it be go alright you know
S0238	mm
S0239	but then i i think it it didn't quite work because it's quite far from the motorway it's the other side of swansea see
S0238	mm
S0239	it be and people tend to just stay on the motorway and go to cardiff
S0238	mm
S0239	why i don't know cos that's quite far from the motorway as well but i guess they have more flight
S0238	mm
S0239	erm so now they just do i guess they do private plane maybe they do lessons there but they do parachute there's always people er on a friday you see them float down
S0238	well
S0239	mm
S0238	if that's something you haven't do do it
S0239	parachute
S0238	mm well i do it when i i i do one jump when i be at university
S0239	oh
S0238	and it be
S0239	i do a tandem
S0238	a fantastic experience
S0239	i do a tandem one
S0238	i do
S0239	mm
S0238	a tandem paraglide off an alp erm but the problem with that be i get sick
S0239	oh right
S0238	and i didn't actually throw up but i be feel so ill they have to bring us down faster erm
S0239	right
S0238	because the alps be sort of swing backwards and forward across our vision erm
S0239	mm
S0238	and the day before i have drive round about three mountain pass so they'd be do i'd actually it that's one of the few time i've actually felt sick drive i mean i get sick when somebody else be drive me sometimes but
S0239	sure
S0238	actually when i'm drive
S0239	oh wow
S0238	not not normally but this go round all these bend and as i you know the opposite mountains be swing across your vision er all the time and and so although i'd have a night's sleep it wasn't that long since i'd be feel sick and i think it be just too soon to do it and
S0239	mm
S0238	it's er a real shame but er but interest
S0239	yeah
S0238	you just sort of run really so you mustn't slow down
S0239	what off the edge of a cliff
S0238	yeah you're er yeah
S0239	oh god
S0238	you go up in a ski lift get all this thing all this stuff on and you just run at the edge and you just
S0239	go for it
S0238	i mean it's not a cliff in the sense of there's a a ninety degree drop you're run down something that's get steeper and steeper and steeper so you've you want to stop and he's say you mustn't because that will bugger everything up you've just get to keep go and it will take off you know ah
S0239	go against every instinct you've get
S0238	and all this of course
S0239	run up a
S0238	cos it be in german cos he didn't speak english
S0239	oh
S0239	but you speak german right
S0238	oh yeah
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	what be i do
S0239	yeah yeah yeah i be see that's funny i i go ski in france erm actually oddly enough from the wed another er a fourth girl she be a friend of ours in france she get back in touch couldn't make it to the wed but anyway she get in touch and she say well why don't you come over at new year so i go and we go ski you know and i'd ski before but only once or twice you know
S0238	mm
S0239	and anyway so on the way back and what it be the erm experience skiers have sort of leave me and this other girl to our own devices you know and on the way back we get a bite lose
S0238	mm
S0239	erm but we be okay you know we be just go slowly and
S0238	you mean on the slope you get a bite lose
S0239	on the slope yeah
S0238	right on the route
S0239	but i think we find the route but problem be erm it be really steep and i'd fall and my ski have stay up the mountain and you know i be down in this snowdrift at the side of you know i'd almost drift onto a black run erm with one ski so well what do i do now and i couldn't get back up
S0239	i couldn't go down it be like that
S0238	mm
S0239	and so i be just sit there and this other girl who be a worse skier than me even
S0238	mm
S0239	she didn't even have any pole cos she say she didn't know how to use them or something erm so i be say look what what what shall i do and i say ah oh i say to her erm er a couple of the experience skiers turn up and they say well can you get onto this slope and i be like no i can't and for a joke i and this be all in french i say i say well look just just leave me i'll die here i say i'm fine but i think it must have come across perhaps less as a joke in in french
S0238	right
S0239	i be no leave me i'll i'll die here anyway next thing they'd er they call this guy and erm and he come he say be you alright and i go yeah i'm fine you know but i be so glad i could speak french because nobody speak english and eventually this woman come on her jam bond bike thing
S0239	i mean you know we be fine we we weren't really in trouble but it be get towards
S0238	mm
S0239	half past five so the sun be go down
S0238	mm yeah
S0239	and i think gosh i'm gonna see the new year in on the mountain
S0239	anyway she come on this amaze jam bond scooter and anyway the guy manage to get back up the hill and get my ski and we put it in and then this other girl be almost in tear get on the i wasn't in tear i be fine and then i get on the back and then off off down the black run on this bike you it be great
S0238	well i don't know if that's the same thing i i've ride a snowmobile
S0239	oh yeah that's what it be i think a snowmobile

S0238	er summer
S0239	okay
S0238	erm
S0239	yeah oh it would be dark in winter
S0238	june yes june so it be sort of light pretty much the whole time fantastic bird watch you know much there bird watch the way i think it would be when i take it up as a hobby here you sit in the drizzle with your binoculars train on a little brown thing three miles away and try and work out what it be there you sit on a hillside and golden plovers walk past you you know what i mean it be you know it be just
S0239	okay
S0238	much better you er
S0238	you almost didn't need your binoculars
S0238	and i'd buy a book specifically of icelandic bird er so i could actually identify things for myself whereas here
S0239	okay
S0238	i often need help so many other things look very similar and they're often hide in a tree anyway and you
S0239	that's
S0238	yeah
S0239	do you want a top up
S0238	no i'm fine thank
S0239	cool
S0238	erm and i'm quite interest in geology so you know see and and erm
S0239	yeah i go i go with actually erm you know and
S0238	mm
S0239	she go to iceland in november erm november two thousand and ten or eleven i think

S0238	mm
S0239	i don't think it will happen now but i go to my boss and i say look be there any chance
S0238	mm
S0239	and i'd build up quite a few brownie point as well so with other things and he say well as long as you rearrange your class and you know teach them the week before to the week after or
S0238	mm
S0239	you know sort it out he say i don't see why not you know erm i'd only be take four days off
S0238	oh right
S0239	so er he agree to it and i be like hey great so so we go
S0238	so whereabouts do you go
S0239	er well we just stay in reykjavik
S0238	right
S0239	and do the golden circle and the touristy stuff
S0238	right
S0239	you know but so erm so yeah it be pretty dark it be dark till
S0238	yeah
S0239	ten in the morning like so i take it you go further round the island do you
S0238	i drive all the way round yes
S0239	mm i would love to do that
S0238	cos there's basically one road that go all the way round and if you drive through the middle
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	you you're ford rivers and things and i didn't think that be a very good idea on my own
S0239	i'd love to do that
S0238	erm so my parent have do that and they have actually plan to drive down the middle they'd book they'd book a four wheel drive from akureyri and
S0239	oh yeah in work she be at the university in akureyri ri or whatever
S0238	it's but it's i mean
S0239	yeah
S0238	i mean reykjavik be tiny isn't it i mean for a capital city you can walk around it in a in an hour
S0239	yeah i know
S0238	but
S0239	well i didn't even know i think
S0238	akureyri be even smaller
S0239	i don't even know if they have another university but she be they have a school up there and
S0238	well i mean it's so
S0239	yeah
S0238	i think they probably it probably small because the population be small isn't it
S0239	well she she come back
S0238	but
S0239	she come back because the economy you know
S0238	yeah
S0239	it it all go to hell
S0238	but it's so the population
S0239	yeah
S0238	the population be so scatter i can see why they would have
S0239	yeah
S0238	one in each place but
S0239	oh it must be dark up there in winter though
S0238	well i
S0239	it's dark enough in reykjavik
S0238	i be in

S0238	and we miss of them
S0239	yeah
S0238	but er
S0239	no i can imagine that you know get up
S0238	no er anyway
S0239	how you do
S0238	i i go somewhere on the south coast the there's a a the well there's more than one huge sort of snow field but
S0239	mm
S0238	there be one particular one where you know you could go up to a hotel and and rent these snowmobile and there be a somebody be run a sort of thing
S0239	oh cool
S0238	where he meet you in a car park at the bottom of the hill and everybody pile into his like minibus kind of thing
S0239	mm
S0238	erm and drive so cos i wouldn't have want it be a sort of road that you wouldn't have want to drive up
S0239	mm mm
S0238	er and you couldn't have do it in a normal car i don't think and i i just rent a normal car

S0239	okay
S0238	so she didn't want everybody else go on in pair and and one of them drive out to you know and and then when we sort of get off and we stop for photos and things and then people swap over and so they both have a turn i end up do all the drive cos she didn't want to do it
S0239	oh right
S0238	god it do your arm in you've really get to hold on tightly to to make it work
S0239	oh okay
S0238	and maybe i be hold on more than i need to cos i be a bite nervous

S0239	you know it's it it could have be something
S0238	i would dial

S0239	he's a nice bloke
S0238	i have a and i'll mention my brilliant neighbour who live behind erm
S0239	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0238	whose surname i actually don't i've live behind live behind her for for fifteen years and i actually don't know what his surname be
S0239	just
S0238	er just well it be and but get parkinson's disease and he have now die a couple of years ago so that's one reason why i feel i need to go back and visit her from time to time because she doesn't drive she never drive you know she's not that sort of generation and she they hadn't they didn't have children they be marry for i think it be fifty seven years
S0239	oh
S0238	something ridiculous like that

S0238	fantastic er and she's get a nephew and niece who don't live and
S0239	okay
S0238	and a sister who don't live that far away you know but even so you know she must get lonely she do a lot of clean you know she clean this room on a monday kind of thing and this room on a tuesday
S0239	mm i can imagine that
S0238	yeah
S0238	no not me well when when she come round for coffee i have to say look please don't look at the detail
S0239	don't look at anything
S0238	i work i don't have time to do all like that
S0239	yeah
S0238	but actually it's not because i work it's because i can't be bother
S0239	well there's more interest things to do isn't there
S0238	well
S0239	yeah
S0238	i just i mean i don't want to live in a really dirty house
S0239	mm
S0238	fine i do but nine time out of ten when i vac the live room i don't move the furniture i just go round it because that's where most of the bits have fall
S0239	yeah
S0238	and just occasionally i think right okay i'd better do a proper clean here
S0239	yeah i mean i i have a very similar approach like i mean when people come to stay i mean not that i've be clean the house madly before you come but you know i think oh you know
S0238	it motivate you to do a bite more doesn't it
S0239	it do it do and be help me and he have the hoover and he be pull the settee up don't do that don't and he's ah no we're gonna clean behind i be like no

S0239	all these dead woodlice come oh no
S0238	when i be a a kid that be my dad's job he would vac the the house every saturday morning while my mother be do other things erm and so
S0239	yeah
S0238	he do do that he be you know be a man yes he be very sort of thorough with all the
S0239	well when first start come round i use to make an effort in that you know if he be come on wednesday night i'd have to get up early on wednesday morning and wipe the surface and what have you i mean er you know i've ease off a bite now but
S0238	well i
S0239	but i still don't want him clean my woodlice you know
S0238	i now i now do try and bleach my sink since comment how dirty it look not dirty but because i pour coffee down it and that stain it and it look
S0239	oh i get that
S0238	stain you know and it doesn't bother me but i think if a man's comment on how unclean your kitchen be you really ought to be do something about it
S0239	you're in trouble
S0238	yes
S0239	that's a good point
S0238	well i mean the my brother have make those sort of remark but my brother be not a normal human be so you know
S0239	ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0238	you know erm i i take that with a pinch of salt but when somebody else say it you start to think mm erm

S0238	i could do i also need at some point go to a supermarket i've bring things that i could bring with me but things like
S0239	oh
S0238	erm juice and some i couldn't
S0239	yeah i i can er oh i didn't offer you juice sorry
S0238	oh it's alright it's fine
S0239	do you want some juice
S0238	no i'm fine with the tea
S0239	oh
S0238	yeah
S0239	oh i didn't think
S0238	erm
S0239	i buy some specially
S0238	well
S0239	i've get orange and apple
S0238	erm
S0239	never mind well if you want some it's in there
S0238	but things like juice and butter obviously i didn't pack in the car yesterday so i do need to go to a supermarket be there one relatively near here that's not huge it's
S0239	yeah
S0238	easier to go into somewhere small
S0239	remember the erm
S0238	and if you don't want a lot of things
S0239	the one we go to last time to get your actimel stuff
S0238	we do didn't we
S0239	erm yeah we walk down there's that one
S0238	right
S0239	we could go in there yeah it's a tesco express but it's get load of
S0238	erm that yeah that's that's the sort of thing i be think
S0239	okay
S0238	erm i don't as i say i don't need a lot but
S0239	so if we call there
S0238	otherwise i've get to look somewhere in
S0239	oh right
S0238	and i don't know what there be i mean obviously there will be something but i'll be drive round look for it
S0239	so if we call there on the way back maybe
S0238	mm that would make sense
S0239	for your juices it's not get warm in the car sort of thing
S0238	yes
S0239	okay yeah cool
S0238	although it doesn't look as if it's go to be a terribly hot day
S0239	no oh i think i saw the sun then actually
S0238	er well
S0238	it's definitely brighter than it be yesterday
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	but er
S0239	well at least it's stop rain
S0238	i be think i'll probably still i've get my rain jacket in the car i be think i probably ought to wear that though if it it be forecast
S0239	yeah
S0238	rain at some point erm and in any case i i think i'm probably gonna get my hike book out of the car would you say that be good
S0239	for the
S0238	yeah
S0239	erm i'd probably just wear my trainers but not sure
S0238	i normally do put boot on if i go anywhere like that
S0239	i'm not sure where there's grass or
S0238	cos you never quite know and it be since it be quite wet yesterday it could be
S0239	yeah maybe i should stick mine in the car yeah
S0239	or not not sure if there's sort of walk through you know muddy bits or anything actually we go erm mean to tell you last night erm have you hear of geocaching no i hadn't hear of it either erm but i stumble across it somewhere online and what it be it's like a worldwide treasure hunt
S0238	oh
S0239	and you do it with gps
S0238	right
S0239	okay so what it be people erm put like small cup er tupperware containers or like magnetic erm small magnetic things and anyway and they put like bits and bob in them and like a logbook and then they hide them and the gps coordinate be on a website so you can look in your area where they be
S0238	mm
S0239	and then if you go for a walk or something erm it's almost like something to do on your walk you know
S0239	but the thing be even though you've get the coordinate some people be really really good at hide them so you're almost on top of them and can't see them you know and you're look in hole in tree and
S0238	mm
S0239	which sound a bite almost a bite sad really but it's quite fun you know erm so i've be do that a little bite and we'd do well it be the other day not quite up to our knees in mud but
S0238	mm
S0239	you forget don't you and you're sink in
S0238	well
S0239	and my friend 's get into it as well you know
S0238	i tend to wear my hike boot if i'm go
S0239	mm
S0238	anywhere where i might want to wear them you know what i mean
S0239	mm
S0238	because it's too late when you've get halfway down the path and you realise that actually there's quite a few puddle for instance
S0239	yeah sure
S0238	erm
S0239	yeah yeah if you want a erm
S0238	and if you're do the drive i can just put them on to go
S0239	yeah
S0238	i don't need to take them to change into
S0239	mm
S0238	they're quite comfortable
S0239	i get my friend into it as well the one who have the breast cancer
S0238	mm
S0239	cos she's always out with the dog and i think i texted her and i say erm oh i'm out look for geocache and she say oh what's that so i tell her and now she's find over three hundred and
S0238	oh you see
S0238	when you say geocache i be spell it c a s h but you're spell it c h e
S0239	c er
S0238	yeah
S0239	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0238	yeah
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	yeah
S0239	yeah yeah and it's fun and some people do erm like puzzle ones i find one and it be up a tree
S0238	mm
S0239	i be i be look for age think i'm sure these be the coordinate
S0238	mm
S0239	where be it you know and then eventually i look up and i could see this bag almost at at the top of the tree and think well i'll never get up there but then when i look there be a rope and they'd actually form like a pulley system
S0239	so i be quite remote in the wood you know
S0239	and this pulley system and they'd sort of tie it round erm what do you call it erm when it come out of a tree like little sticky bite that come out of a tree
S0238	branch
S0239	no not not branch you know like a break off branch but anyway whatever whatever that
S0238	stump
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	that's sort of a branch
S0239	yeah but yeah yeah and you tie it round there so it be you just untie it and then you lower it down
S0239	and then you open it and sign the log and put it back up again
S0239	it's really cool yeah
S0238	mm
S0239	i i know it sound a bite a bite weird but it be actually a lot of fun and if you look on erm on there be you can have an app for your phone if you've if you've get a smartphone
S0238	mm
S0239	or you can you can buy a little gps so
S0238	well i i mean it's not something that
S0239	yeah
S0238	i would want to do
S0239	yeah
S0238	but it's just from a sociological point of view
S0239	yeah
S0238	it's really interest the things that people be find to do with the well the internet as a sort of basis but obviously
S0239	absolutely
S0238	modern technology it's just
S0239	absolutely yeah
S0238	amaze
S0239	cos my my quilt thing couldn't exist without
S0238	yeah
S0239	i mean it it could on a limit scale but not in the same way it do you know
S0238	no
S0239	yeah yeah i think people underestimate how much the internet be change society really cos you interact with people overseas so
S0238	yes
S0239	so easily you know
S0238	yeah but just
S0239	erm
S0238	yes just
S0239	yeah
S0238	it's permeate so many areas of life and people be so creative
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	in how they're use it it's
S0239	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0239	but i've get friends who i like i be tell you about my internet before my i mean i'd never have meet them
S0238	mm
S0239	there be no way that we'd ever have meet
S0238	yes
S0239	and to find people with the same interest be very hard in the local area so
S0238	mm yeah
S0239	it's brilliant
S0238	you know and you look back to
S0239	yeah
S0238	how i mean okay i know that's er we're talk about something that's happen over the last ten years really a lot of this stuff but but
S0239	mm
S0238	if you look back to the way people live two or three hundred years ago stay in their own little village and basically know the same few hundred people at most
S0239	yeah
S0238	it's impossible to imagine what that must have be like
S0239	yeah it's bad isn't where people could live and never leave their village
S0238	yeah
S0239	and it be quite possible
S0238	yeah
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	just
S0239	it's always when i watch pride and prejudice or something you know i i have the bbc one on it be on one of these satellite channel you know
S0238	yes yes
S0239	well freeview channel yeah you look at it and think god they say oh fifty miles a fair long way
S0238	yes but i mean at least they have a certain amount of money and could
S0239	er yeah yeah sure yeah yeah
S0238	get out to visit people and so on erm
S0239	mm
S0238	and money for light and so and things like that you know i mean if you be poor you'd be
S0239	yeah
S0238	basically live by the sun wouldn't you
S0239	well yeah i mean my mother you know sometimes mention you know when they use to read by candlelight in the night and i that be
S0238	well can remember do that in
S0239	not that long ago you do
S0238	be it nineteen seventy one or when we have the
S0239	oh when the power be out yeah
S0238	yes
S0239	no this be before they have
S0238	actually my dad
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	rig up a erm a headlight on a battery car headlight
S0239	oh
S0238	in the live room so that we cos we be all readers
S0238	and you couldn't do anything else well you couldn't watch television obviously anyway i think it be before we have a television
S0239	yeah
S0238	so he rig this up so we could we could actually read
S0239	ah
S0238	a bite more comfortably than cos candlelight be not good for your eye
S0239	no i know no i i mean that be what in the nineteen forties i suppose
S0238	right
S0239	er or fifties even
S0238	well i remember read a biography of enid blyton and the cottage where she be live have a well for the water
S0239	oh right
S0238	well i mean not one of
S0239	yeah
S0238	one of the cottage obviously she didn't only live in one house all her life but
S0239	mm
S0238	one of the place where she live
S0239	mm
S0238	er and be quite surprise and then think well actually i don't really know enough
S0239	oh
S0238	about things like that
S0239	yeah i mean it's so
S0238	cos both my parent grow up to towns
S0239	it it's so amaze i mean when i go to the olympics i be camp for three weeks you know
S0238	mm
S0239	and it's not that i haven't camp before but i think cos it be a longer period
S0238	mm
S0239	and i be go for water and you know
S0238	mm
S0239	bring it back and then and we have to use quite a lot because we have to wash our uniform as well
S0238	right
S0239	so i have like a big bucket and then erm a plunger
S0238	mm
S0239	i i look this up on youtube erm what you do be get a plunger and then drill hole through the plunger
S0238	right
S0239	so i get the boys in work to do that and and then you do it and it create enough bubble and it it clean quite well in er
S0238	right
S0239	in your bucket so we're do that obviously load of water so when i come home to have water on tap
S0238	mm
S0239	oh cold water on tap be brilliant but to have hot water on tap
S0238	yes
S0239	you know even now sometimes oh hot water on tap it's amaze you know
S0238	well the
S0239	but
S0238	first
S0239	you know mm
S0238	i live for two years in japan with no hot water on tap
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	erm i be
S0239	yeah
S0238	fill the bath with cold water and heat up well you know turn like gas on and hit would heat up do you
S0239	oh no
S0238	know anybody who have one of those
S0239	oh that sound a bite dangerous
S0238	but when i first go out there that be quite normal it be
S0239	mm
S0238	typical the way of japanese use technology you know the they'll do things that sort of replicate the way they use to do things without technology if you see what i mean so instead of have bloody central heat with all like er tap
S0239	that's right yeah
S0238	you know ridiculous just heat the house and you don't need it
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm this be
S0239	it be weird isn't it yeah
S0238	they use to have a a bath with a wood fire underneath and i actually have a student when i first go out there who live in the countryside and they still do that so they'd go out and have to go out and out of outside the house you know so the access be outside
S0239	oh and light a fire underneath
S0238	yes
S0239	oh right
S0238	and light the fire and it would heat the water up
S0239	oh okay
S0238	erm and so a lot of the of people when i first go out a lot of of i and and quite a few of my colleagues have this sort of bath where you fill it with cold water and you you have a sort of plastic cover that you put over it
S0239	oh yeah
S0238	erm and
S0239	yeah to keep the heat in
S0238	to keep the heat in
S0239	mm
S0238	and you erm and in winter in my little house i would i'd leave the bath fill in at night and i'd get up first thing in the morning and go and turn the gas on and go back and huddle under my duvet until it be
S0239	yeah
S0238	hot and go and have a hot bath first thing just to get move in a morning cos it be so cold
S0239	yeah it be really cold
S0238	but
S0239	i mean i think it be amaze japan like you know obviously they have really high technology
S0238	yes
S0239	almost ahead of what we have here
S0238	yeah
S0239	erm in term of tvs and electronics and what have you and then but really sort of low technology like drop toilets and and it all seem cheek by jowl and i i know there's reason cos of earthquakes and stuff that
S0238	well it's they it's that it's it's also
S0239	they don't want to have pip but
S0238	that they they've
S0239	mm
S0238	it's not that's not just about earthquakes though it's about i mean if you just if you go out of the centre of hiroshima
S0239	mm
S0238	beyond a certain distance you be on bottle gas and gravity toilets
S0239	yeah
S0238	you know it be just they just hadn't extend the infrastructure far enough
S0239	yeah
S0238	so it be only in the big cities
S0239	mm
S0238	and i think that be it
S0239	so it be a i felt it be a big mix of
S0238	yeah
S0239	old and new together
S0238	yeah i mean
S0239	yeah
S0238	i can remember that our first year erm some japanese friends i know get a new toilet and they take us to show us this new toilet which have get a heat seat and erm
S0239	oh like in the yeah
S0238	you know two different squirt to wash yourself
S0239	squirt yes
S0238	and a and er and er er hot air to dry afterwards and everything and then you know i get this house which just have a hole in the floor
S0239	yeah yeah you yeah
S0238	and this funny wagon
S0239	yeah
S0238	come round every two months and
S0239	yeah
S0238	you're suppose to pour bucket of water down while they're clear it out to up the you know and this little disembody voice would shout
S0238	as you do it
S0239	yes
S0238	it's just really
S0239	yes
S0238	and it
S0239	ah
S0238	certainly smelt it in summer
S0239	oh yeah
S0238	whatever you do erm
S0239	i remember someone tell me that er he live in a in a block of four house you know
S0238	mm
S0239	and all their toilets be link and as he be foreign he be deem that he he be not good enough to help with the extractions sort of thing
S0239	so the other people have to come and help him you know to to throw bucket of water down and what have you but he be not able to do that
S0238	right yes
S0239	you know that's not you know a foreigner no no
S0238	yes
S0239	yeah er i have something like that in miyachi someone come to see me and they they be talk about sort rubbish you know and they say well er you're you're a foreigner so you pay us thousand yen and and we'll sort it for you i be like that seem like a good deal for a year you know it's here you be so yeah but we have a lot more bag in miyashi actually there be lot of in hiroshima it's just basically burnable and non burnable
S0238	yes
S0239	which we could cope with
S0238	yeah
S0239	well i could some of the others and didn't cope with that very well but er they be show the error of their ways by our our landlady
S0238	right
S0239	but in miyoshi they have they have about eight different bag
S0238	oh right
S0239	they have one massive bag for batteries it's like well i've only get two double as
S0238	mm
S0239	at the bottom of those bag yeah
S0238	well i suppose it
S0239	some type
S0238	because they don't have a the they must have be include things that here you'd take to a tip yourself
S0239	yeah
S0238	i mean batteries you cos as you say you don't have that many to throw away so you don't need them be to be collect from
S0239	yeah they don't have any more you know
S0238	oh really
S0239	yeah when i be there be erm so the king in the king you know i tell you about the king
S0238	mm
S0239	through er the guy in the chinese takeaway
S0238	yeah
S0239	the reason we meet him be on begomy night
S0238	right
S0239	where
S0238	that you be prowl round look for bargain
S0239	well we didn't have anything our flat be empty you know we'd just arrive and he be prowl round and anyway we meet him and er he say oh come on i'll show you all the best shots you know and he'd
S0238	right
S0239	he'd be to house so you know we have that in common
S0238	right
S0239	and he know a bite of english so he go round and he he get me a bike and all sort you know and that's how we meet him but so when i go back to see him he'd have his stroke but anyway and ah yeah i be tell you last night yeah
S0238	yeah
S0239	i manage to talk to talk to his wife and arrange a time and what have you and i go back and he say oh there isn't begomy any more he say they've
S0238	oh
S0239	they've stop it
S0238	so what will they do if they've get big big stuff
S0239	i don't know i guess they have to take it to the tip like we do i'm not sure i mean i i didn't have a big conversation cos you know
S0238	but i mean actually big stuff
S0239	mm
S0238	you don't have to here you can get it collect by the council if you organise it
S0239	yeah well maybe it's the same there maybe they're do
S0238	i mean it depend what you mean by big obviously things that you can that you can carry and fit in your car you can take to the tip
S0239	yeah
S0238	but if it's something that you you can't move yourself you can get it collect
S0239	maybe that's what they do and rather than have one night but it seem less efficient somehow but
S0238	yeah i dunno
S0239	maybe it's cheaper for
S0238	i mean when i when i be in germany which be twenty years ago
S0239	mm
S0238	you have to sort by law you have to sort absolutely everything er but you take you take it i mean they have a bin for they call it in other word everything that that wasn't that didn't go in any of the other things
S0239	oh okay
S0238	and anything that be not recyclable
S0239	land landfill like yeah
S0238	erm
S0239	mm
S0238	and everything else you be suppose to take to the tip yourself so they weren't come round and collect it you have to take it but there be one in the little town where i be live you know and and a little man there watch very carefully to make sure that you be put things in the right place because all the plastics you have to separate depend on what little you know there be pp and pe and pes and on the plastic
S0239	oh wow
S0238	on the plastic and you have to put them in separate
S0239	oh so you mean a different
S0238	yes
S0239	oh that's really good
S0238	erm
S0239	mm
S0238	and i separate them all at home and have them all and take them in different bag so on one occasion i be just empty a bag into one of the things and he come up and be very sort of and i think he be offer to help because he have such a broad bavarian accent i couldn't actually understand what he be say but it wasn't it be tell me off for put all my plastics in one thing and i be and i then have to say well actually they be all the same
S0239	ah
S0238	and and he's sort of search through to check that i'd actually
S0238	pick them pick them
S0239	yes yes
S0238	you know i've already sort them i've do understand
S0239	the rubbish police
S0238	i'm not an idiot but yes cos
S0239	oh
S0238	cardboard and newspapers be in two separate things and again you know he be stand there watch to make nobody put a cereal packet in the in with the newspapers and
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm
S0239	i mean erm i must say i dunno much i'm impress with with council but the recycle i think they've really get right
S0238	right
S0239	cos first of all there's no wheelie bin they they've go down the bag route
S0238	right
S0239	yeah so what we have be we have like a black bag for
S0238	mm
S0239	what's the word you use in german
S0238	yes
S0239	yeah yeah for landfill stuff
S0238	yeah
S0239	and then we have pink for plastic
S0238	mm
S0239	green for paper and card erm what else do we have we have erm i dunno if you're do these the er compostable waste
S0238	er no i've get a compost bin
S0239	right well
S0238	in my garden
S0239	they try it for a while but people didn't really use it cos then they be get like maggots in there and things but
S0238	mm yes well you do mm
S0239	yeah but they start them with these bag
S0238	oh
S0239	and they they decompose you know they don't decompose here they
S0238	no yeah yeah
S0239	decompose later and that's really good and we put that out and there's another bin outside you can put it into
S0238	mm
S0239	cos i use to have a wormery before it start
S0238	mm
S0239	i have out at the back and these worm in it and it would
S0238	mm
S0239	eat eat eggshells and thing erm so they do that that's really good
S0238	yeah
S0239	and then there's garden waste as well they give us rather nice white bag i buy some extra ones to keep fabric in but they're mean to be for garden waste you know and then it's fortnightly so it's black and pink one week
S0238	yeah
S0239	and green the next but the food waste be weekly
S0238	mm
S0239	so that's really good so you
S0238	yes
S0239	you know even if you miss it it's not hang round for
S0238	yeah
S0239	for a month actually i be gonna put the rubbish out actually have they be
S0238	no we've we've get wheelie bin for everything and they've actually now we have
S0239	oh
S0238	wheelie bin for everything except garden waste and we have green bag which be good because you can carry them round the garden
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm and they've just introduce wheelie bin for that as well so
S0239	yeah
S0238	i mean obviously i carry my bag round the garden and then take them to the bin and empty them into the big because i can't move the bin all round the garden but
S0239	i'm so glad we don't have wheelie bin
S0238	i can understand that it's it's easier for the er people but at my other house i be up fourteen step
S0239	oh
S0238	and so i never get a wheelie bin i i say look i don't i opt out which you could do but basically everyone in the street should have opt out they shouldn't ever have deliver them to my street somebody should have look at the street and say
S0239	no way
S0238	all these people be go to have to keep their wheelie bin in the street and there be a thing on the leaflet say don't keep it in the street but of course everybody do so the whole street have get a line of wheelie bin all the time
S0239	yeah
S0238	except for mine because i'd actually read the leaflet
S0239	people be go nut in bath because they say it's so unslightly
S0238	yeah
S0239	because people have to keep them on the on the road
S0238	yeah
S0239	and sometimes it's three or four you know
S0238	yes
S0239	yeah
S0238	yeah well i've get
S0239	mm
S0238	three and a half cos i share one with my next door neighbour
S0239	oh okay right
S0238	erm they the the glass metal and plastic
S0239	okay
S0238	erm some people have an inset in the paper bin that
S0239	ah so they can put their yeah
S0238	and and we have a whole bin
S0239	between you
S0238	between us
S0239	mm
S0238	erm
S0239	yeah
S0238	so to be honest i hardly ever do anything with that because he get up early and go to work so he he always put it out
S0239	sort yes
S0239	yeah no i'm really glad they haven't cos people in flats i just don't know what they'd do you know
S0238	yes
S0239	so
S0238	yeah
S0239	yeah so anyway we stick it out and yeah it seem a pretty good system so
S0238	mm
S0239	mm but i mean it's take years cos i've be recycle for donkey's years now
S0238	oh yes
S0239	before i remember take plastic you know when i use to go to the motorway i i wouldn't make a special trip but if i be go to the motorway there be a plastic bin
S0238	right cos yes a lot of place didn't have plastic for a long time
S0239	well didn't but do the next one along and i i'd just drop it in the bite
S0238	you see we've now
S0239	yeah
S0238	get a thing erm have introduce a thing where you've get to erm to prove that you're a resident
S0239	ah okay
S0238	so obviously i don't know whether their recycle facilities be better than other people and but other people must have be use it and so they they everybody who pay council tax be send be a form and you have to take it the next time you go to the tip
S0239	oh right
S0238	and they have you a a little sticker to keep i your car
S0239	oh okay
S0238	so and you have they do check it you have to show it
S0239	ah this wasn't like an organise tip the it wasn't man you know you could just go along and and shove it in you know
S0238	right
S0239	so we use to do that but but to be honest since i've have the milkman i've have so much less plastic
S0238	mm
S0239	cos i've just mainly bottle
S0238	well you see i've get an actimel thing every day
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm and the milk
S0239	mm
S0238	that's mostly it for plastic i mean you and you you get or wash up liquid bottle and things like that as well
S0239	yeah sure yeah mm
S0238	but it's not now i've notice that my neighbour be put i don't know whether to say anything or not cos it sound like you're be the rubbish police but they're put plastic cartons in and if you look at the thing that we be send it say
S0239	no cartons
S0238	bottle not cartons
S0239	now see it doesn't say for us cos it use to say no bottle but now it doesn't say it people put everything in but i don't think the council mind cos they're they're try to cut down on
S0238	well i mean they're obviously have to sort if you're put plastic and glass and metal all in one bin somebody's get to sort it anyway
S0239	mm
S0238	so it's
S0239	well if
S0238	i i kind of think it's up to the council to
S0239	be clearer
S0238	decide whether they're
S0239	mm
S0238	go to put a note through their door and say oi
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm
S0239	yeah i mean with the food food waste they use to say er no oh actually it do say on there no meat no fish no plastics but i don't think most people be aware of that really you know people put bone in it and all sort in there
S0238	well
S0239	which doesn't compost of course
S0238	i inherit a compost bin
S0239	mm
S0238	which i have be use but it's a bite unmanageable so i'm actually think of build myself a a compost heap as it be
S0239	mm
S0238	my dad have i mean obviously you can just have a heap of stuff but my dad actually do one with a a concrete floor and raise block wall and i've get load of spare bricks cos there be a a brick build barbecue on my patio that i dismantle cos i'm never go to use it you know
S0239	mm
S0238	so i've get lot of bricks
S0239	oh okay
S0238	and i think that's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do
S0239	and make yourself one
S0238	but i need this be one of the things on my list for for my friend to do he's a big bloke to to move the compost bin which i can't move so that i've get the space that i can actually start do this
S0239	right
S0238	erm because i've get plenty of place to put compost
S0239	so they don't do erm compost waste in
S0238	no i mean i could take
S0239	no they they don't do curb site for it
S0238	no no no
S0239	oh right oh
S0238	i mean some of it be garden waste
S0239	yeah yeah sure
S0238	that could go in the garden waste ting but obviously the food stuff from the from a kitchen no
S0239	oh right
S0238	there's nowhere to put that
S0239	i think we've be do it about four years er seem to be a bite of a guinea pig so i've have a bite longer than er other
S0238	well i mean the fact be i can use it myself
S0239	mm
S0238	so i don't need to put er
S0239	mm
S0238	even if they do collect i would probably still be do it myself
S0239	mm
S0238	because i've get enough of a garden that i need compost
S0239	yeah oh yeah sure you have to yeah for it's actual purpose
S0238	yes
S0239	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well yeah but i've not get that i just have a jungle
S0238	oh right yes
S0239	oh and one day i'll do it but er i i just don't really know what to do with it because the run off of water on the school be incredible and it's
S0238	mm
S0239	it's almost wash away the bottom of the garden so it's all that funny angle now
S0238	i be look out and see and i see what you mean
S0239	yeah
S0238	about that deck next door
S0239	oh yeah do you see it yeah
S0238	i mean it's not just that as you say that would actually have make a sensible addition to your garden and they would still have quite a bite garden
S0239	yeah
S0238	but if they actually sit on that deck and sort of laugh and chat
S0239	yeah
S0238	it's right over your fence
S0239	yeah but i don't go out there so i don't care
S0238	right
S0239	but erm yeah it it be close but
S0238	it's just a funny place for them to have put it but they've get they even have a
S0239	but again say there i er you know and as far as i know i've see them there maybe once this summer maybe i haven't be look but i can't remember see them sit on it
S0238	well i mean there have be plenty of occasion this summer
S0239	it's too far from the house
S0238	you could have well that's what i mean it's a funny place for them to put it cos you don't just walk out and oh i forget my coffee cup i'm go back into the house for it when it's that far away do you
S0239	yeah yeah i just yeah so whether the they might agree to sell you know they're not use it erm obviously be a bite more expensive now it's get deck and stuff on it
S0238	yeah
S0239	but maybe it depend what happen with the house really cos i don't know yet if if i be go to extend you know and if i do
S0238	well you need to think about that and look into
S0239	yeah
S0238	cost and all sort of things there don't you so you've get a a picture and then talk to them maybe and see cos i mean if they just give you a flat out no that's an answer but
S0239	yeah
S0238	there's no point in ask them if if you don't really want it
S0239	see i should have do it i should have do it before
S0238	mm
S0239	obviously i haven't get my own garden do so i be think well
S0238	yeah
S0239	why do i want an extra bite of garden but of course things have change now so
S0238	yes i mean i don't
S0239	yeah
S0238	i don't particularly enjoy garden i enjoy have a garden which mean you've get to do some garden and i sort of keep up with the the minimum amount of maintenance erm
S0239	oh i don't now
S0238	i mean a visit a friend who rent okay but she be say that they've get this fairly small square of lawn behind the house which okay will be a lot easier to mow than mine which be sort of uneven and on a slope and and need a long cable cos it go quite a long way away from any electricity supply but er
S0238	she be say that oh it doesn't quite do seven days i'm have to do it every six days and i'm think oh mine's lucky if it get do once every two weeks
S0238	quite often it's
S0239	yeah
S0238	three weeks
S0239	well what i tell myself be that my garden be great for hedgehogs and
S0238	well a lawn a lawn
S0239	the be and their population be in decline
S0238	yes
S0239	it's because there aren't garden like mine any more
S0238	right okay
S0239	and therefore it be a service to nature that's what i say
S0238	well the trouble be i've get quite a few bits around the edge of my garden that would be good for hedgehogs as well
S0239	oh
S0238	but the lawn's good for blackbirds and other thrushes
S0239	you see i would do it i would do it lovely but you know i'm think about the hedgehogs
S0238	yeah right i see
S0238	mm
S0239	oh that sound a bite welsh didn't it i would do it lovely but
S0238	yes
S0238	oh yes it's but my mum say have she get a welsh accent and i
S0239	have i
S0238	and i say a little bite of a lilt
S0239	it's probably stronger
S0238	well i
S0239	when i speak to my mum
S0238	haven't
S0239	mm
S0238	yeah well i'm mine i get more yorkshire
S0239	yeah
S0238	if i'm talk to someone from yorkshire
S0239	yeah
S0238	but i hadn't really notice it when you be in hiroshima at all
S0239	no
S0238	it be only when i visit you here that i
S0239	yeah
S0238	oh yes she do sound a bite welsh
S0239	i think i tend to adapt to the people around me
S0238	mm
S0239	er some people don't they stick
S0238	and still sound as if they'd just get off the boat from manchester so to speak when for years
S0239	yeah
S0238	in japan yes
S0239	yeah yeah yeah but if if i'm around people who be not welsh you know i tend to adapt i even find myself use different word when i'm around american sometimes
S0238	mm
S0239	i catch myself use american word sometime and i think what be i do you know but i maybe it's years of
S0238	well that's you've
S0239	listen to foreign languages and
S0238	yes i be go to say
S0239	you know and
S0238	that's also to do with english teach and you're in japan you learn that you have to use the american vocabulary cos they didn't they hadn't learn the british vocabulary i be quite amuse the other day when i be talk to and he talk about casualty in erm i and i didn't say we've change to a and e now we don't say casualty any more
S0239	ah
S0238	so obviously the
S0239	you do in
S0238	casualty as you call it and i'm think actually we don't now but of course
S0239	i dunno what i call it now er yeah i call it a and e i think
S0238	well that's what it be officially call that's the sign say
S0239	but the tv show of course be still
S0238	be still call casualty yes
S0239	yeah
S0238	so people would still understand that here
S0239	casualty
S0238	but obviously he work for a for british firm for quite a you know he work for and then for
S0239	yeah it's become an old word hasn't it it
S0238	well and 's sort of international but the
S0239	i do say a and e
S0238	cos i remember when he when he go for a job interview
S0239	mm
S0238	i think it must have be with with in the interview he tell them he be knackered i don't know whether he'd just get off of a i say why you use that word in a job interview not very and they look at him and say be you sure you're american
S0238	yes i've just be work with a lot of british people ie me well not not just me
S0239	yeah
S0238	cos when i first go out there they do in the house be really there be it be a really fairly equal number of americans and australians and brits and one canadian
S0239	right yeah yeah
S0238	it get more british
S0239	yeah when i be there it be fairly british but we do have and yeah from canada
S0238	but when he's he say when he come back
S0239	oh yeah
S0238	somebody at some point make one of those dismissive oh well you're american sort of remark and he be quite piss off
S0239	yeah
S0238	and i think and we say yeah that would not have happen my first year there
S0239	yeah
S0238	because it just wasn't like that it you know it be what can i say
S0239	yeah
S0238	much more equal
S0239	yes well er and be there weren't they erm
S0238	yes
S0239	yeah yeah yeah i know them cos and i work at the school together
S0238	right yeah
S0239	yeah
S0238	yeah
S0239	i saw them in perth actually cos i hadn't hear from them like since i leave japan
S0238	mm
S0239	i be like they don't like me any more
S0238	yeah
S0239	cos i literally never hear from them
S0238	well some people be good at communicate
S0239	i
S0238	and some people you don't exactly
S0239	no
S0238	keep
S0239	no i know i don't
S0238	the odd christmas yes
S0239	oh
S0238	you're very good at christmas card
S0239	yeah
S0238	but not in between time
S0239	yeah sure but i i have write them christmas card at least
S0238	mm
S0239	i i never hear anything so
S0238	right
S0239	er erm yeah i i should try and be better i just seem so busy all the time
S0238	well i yes i mean fair enough see i don't work full time and you do
S0239	mm
S0238	but i just think cos you be a techy that you'd probably email a lot
S0239	yeah i i
S0238	to people
S0239	i do but i think since have come along
S0238	yeah
S0239	that take my email energy
S0238	yes
S0239	and i don't tend to
S0238	yeah
S0239	i mean i email actually she email me erm probably email about once a month or something like that but
S0238	cos i
S0239	i know
S0238	i kind of use email as a substitute for letter i use to write letter
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm you know and i've still get letter that my my school friends and i use to write letter in the school holiday to each other
S0239	now see again perhaps it's because of facebook because i'm
S0238	mm
S0239	see a lot of people on facebook
S0238	yes yes
S0239	so i don't tend to email them now erm or i might send them a message a private message via facebook maybe maybe i'm not email any more i dunno
S0238	mm well i mean things
S0239	think about it really
S0238	you things move on don't they
S0239	yeah
S0238	you know cos i have kind of move on to email and and both oddly both the couple that i'm friends with in germany write letter i mean doesn't he and i email but his wife write letter still and and you know be really they don't have a television they're very sort of it similar to my colleague very intellectual they're archivists
S0239	yeah
S0238	and rather like you and she's she actually supervise his phd and that's how they get together in the first place
S0239	oh
S0238	and
S0239	okay
S0238	er they've be marry for i don't know i mean quite a few years not but they weren't marry when i when first meet them i teach them each of them separately on different course at the
S0239	oh
S0238	the british council and then they invite me out for a drink which you didn't didn't really i didn't really i be quite lonely in germany because in japan we do we have enough colleagues that we'd go out after work and in germany most of the people i be work with be women whose husband be german and they be go off home to their husband and children after work and that sort of thing so
S0239	yeah
S0238	you didn't socialise with colleagues much and the students it be a different sort of atmosphere somehow
S0239	mm
S0238	and these people ask me for a drink and we end up sort of keep in touch after i'd leave germany and i would go back and they have not just a spare room they have a spare flat
S0239	oh like you do
S0238	they their flat be on the fifth floor
S0239	yeah
S0238	erm a really nice location in the centre of munich if you're go to live in a city it be a great place to live i mean i'm not like you i'm not into cities but
S0239	mm
S0238	and they so often have people visit cos his family come from schleswig holstein way up in the north and his brother actually work in the czech republic so
S0239	okay
S0238	so they start rent the flat on the second floor which be a bite smaller
S0239	oh
S0238	but in the same build just for their residents
S0239	oh wow
S0238	so when i go
S0239	sociable
S0238	i could stay there for several days there and i'd go up and have meals with them
S0239	yeah
S0238	and and we'd go out and do things but when they be work it be obviously better for them to have a guest who wasn't there all the time
S0239	yeah yeah oh that's a really good idea
S0238	erm and yeah it be it be great
S0239	so you're totally self contain
S0238	yes
S0239	just do your own thing
S0238	yeah
S0239	oh right mm well that's very generous of them to er
S0238	yes
S0238	well i mean i think it be for their families rather than for me
S0239	yeah yeah yeah well sure but yeah well yeah well
S0239	maybe not
S0238	and they've now move to to nuremburg and and they're rent a house rather than a
S0239	yeah
S0238	a flat and it's a so it's a a different sort of set up but
S0239	they tend to rent do they
S0238	but
S0239	generally
S0238	that's what germans do
S0239	yeah
S0238	i mean they're both professionals on she she run the bavarian church archive
S0239	mm
S0238	she's
S0239	oh right
S0238	very very er so i don't know what her salary be but good
S0239	yeah
S0238	you know and they they don't have kid so they're very comfortably off but that's what you do and it's a very nice house
S0239	and the only person i write letter to be erm i don't quite know how it start
S0238	mm
S0239	cos i give a test twice a year erm to my first years
S0238	mm
S0239	and it's a two hour test and it's computer program so they're all sit there and it's very bore you know and really cos they're all on their own computers they can't really copy off each other
S0238	mm
S0239	so it need it's minimal invigilation need you know so erm sometimes i i i'll write a bite of a letter to and post it off and she hardly ever write back hardly ever but i try to do that erm at least once a year maybe twice a year but she's the only one i write to now
S0238	mm
S0239	longhand it's she have facebook now i guess erm
S0238	well i mean i'm not even when i
S0239	mm
S0238	when i write letter it's not long hand i do it on a computer
S0239	yeah with word or something yeah
S0238	word or something but
S0239	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	erm
S0239	yeah yeah
S0238	but
S0239	it's change a lot hasn't it mm
S0238	mm yes i think we probably ought to move if we're gonna actually do this
S0239	yeah yeah let's head off
