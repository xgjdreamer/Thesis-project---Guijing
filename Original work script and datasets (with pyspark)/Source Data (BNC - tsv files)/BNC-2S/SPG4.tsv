S0454	i i prefer that to cereal
S0579	a a bite of marmalade yeah
S0454	mm yes that's a nice breakfast have yogurt quite a lot too
S0579	i'm not well your mum use to your grandma use to like her yogurts yeah
S0454	yeah well it's very good for you actually
S0579	yeah yeah i don't
S0454	better than milk they say it's easier to digest that's probably why grandma like it
S0579	be it oh grandma be
S0454	i make my own
S0579	do you
S0454	yes
S0579	oh i don't i don't drink that very often well at least i can't remember do it
S0454	i just have a small cup every day i try to have a small
S0579	well a little tiny one
S0454	yeah yeah a little tiny one not a huge thing
S0579	oh no oh well cos your dad will eat anything doesn't he he's get he's
S0454	except sardines
S0579	oh except sardines you say
S0454	he won't he won't eat small fish
S0579	oh
S0454	and he hat see fish with their head on that really put him off
S0579	oh i i always find well i always tend to chop the head off when i'm in there yeah
S0579	definitely at the fish counter
S0454	but actually if you're grill them whole it's quite useful to have the head on
S0579	be it oh
S0454	yes cos then when you lift the tail bone out the whole thing come off
S0579	oh i see
S0454	but you want them to gut it really that's the fiddly job
S0579	well what the like er when i go to morrison's in town for those fish fresh fish
S0454	mm
S0579	they do that for me chop the head off and then clean it out
S0454	ah yes that's useful though
S0579	yeah
S0454	er descale and the
S0579	yeah they do that
S0454	and the gutting cos that's just messy
S0579	yeah
S0454	and you're not gonna use that for anything
S0579	no morrison's quite good for their fish
S0454	mm but i find leave the head on be quite useful if if you're grill them whole
S0579	better
S0454	cos they don't fall apart on you
S0579	no never fancy eat the head though do you
S0454	yeah oh i don't eat them no i just
S0579	gonna say
S0454	just when you when they're do the the whole just from the tail if you lift from the tail
S0579	yeah
S0454	bend it a bite then the whole thing come off with the spine so
S0579	oh
S0454	just lift the the meat off
S0579	oh you're well into cook i can see
S0454	mm fish be nice cos it's simple
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah you can't really go wrong with fish can you
S0579	no not really
S0454	i mean you can't it's difficult to undercook fish you'd have to try quite hard
S0579	try hard enough to go before you
S0454	yes
S0579	occasionally i've burn them under the grill
S0454	yes i think the the you're more likely to overcook it than undercook it
S0579	yeah
S0454	so you just need to stand there really
S0579	yeah
S0454	not go off cos you're really look only at six minutes for a lot of those smaller fish
S0579	no i know
S0454	and you can't really i mean there aren't that many things you could do with fish be there you either grill it
S0579	yeah i don't
S0454	or you can poach it which i never do
S0579	when i've get fish in there i know there's something wrong when i see smoke in the air
S0454	oh dear whereas meat it's harder cos you know it's different thickness and you you know you don't know when it's do
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah so i don't like cook meat very much
S0579	no meat yeah
S0454	mm i don't eat much meat
S0579	i don't i i don't i don't ever get meat actually i don't think chicken occasionally
S0454	mm i'll occasionally have chicken bacon i often keep in
S0579	i use to have beef i i haven't have beef for years now
S0454	yeah no i don't eat much of it at all
S0579	well i have duck occasionally yeah
S0454	oh that's nice mm i'll eat duck out quite a lot
S0579	oh oh oh do you yes
S0454	i've never cook it though i should do really
S0579	yes
S0454	use to be difficult to buy but it's not any more
S0579	no no you can you can buy the duck
S0454	mm
S0579	in in most of the supermarkets years years ago of course when we've down here of course it be the same use to be a firm call fish sell nothing else but fish
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	i think they must've go bust though cos they they suddenly vanish
S0454	mm that's a shame
S0579	yeah
S0454	i love shellfish i love them
S0579	yeah
S0454	do you like them
S0579	they're quite nice yeah yeah
S0454	mm i don't buy them but it be nice cockle and muscle and all of those i like them a lot
S0579	cockle
S0454	the only thing i don't like be whelk cos they look like snail
S0579	oh those oh they put you off
S0454	that's don't like anything that look like snail
S0579	oh no
S0454	they're a fiddle to eat as well that's no good
S0579	where do we eat where i saw fish like that just try to think where we get the fish from
S0454	shellfish be popular in northern spain and not very expensive there don't see it that much here do you
S0579	no i don't i don't like that
S0454	which i've never understand cos actually it's easy to farm and that's why it's cheap in spain so in spain they'll have these raft just wooden raft and from the raft they would hang rope down like proper
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know the old fashion rope you would see and on those rope you know they might have twenty rope on a raft say
S0579	yeah
S0454	six foot by six foot maybe ten foot by ten foot they would put i don't know what they're call like the egg of the muscle and they'd they'd impregnate it and then you leave it there and after six weeks it would be full of muscle
S0579	yeah
S0454	you scrape them off and you start again so it's incredibly cheap for them to farm you don't need to fee them they're just in the sea i've never understand why we didn't do that in the uk
S0579	i don't know talk of fish in spain i remember the smell use to be marvellous go in spain
S0454	mm yeah amaze
S0579	the fish you could smell it be cook cook outside they be cook it like yeah
S0454	mm yeah beautiful the nice thing about spanish cook be unlike the french the french dress things up a lot
S0579	yeah
S0454	the spanish don't bother they just start with very very good fresh local ingredients whatever's in season you can't buy things out of season and they just grill it and that's it salt
S0579	yeah
S0454	just with salt and a bite of maybe a bite of salad and that's it nothing else and it's just delicious
S0579	somewhere i think it be spain they use to have fire outside and they use to do it
S0454	mm that's nice
S0454	yeah and a glass of wine and you're do
S0579	well that's that's useful to have around
S0454	yes i'm not so into french cook cos it's too dress up for me i like things
S0579	yeah
S0454	just if you've get good ingredients you shouldn't need to do much more than grill it and boil it bite of salad and that's pretty much it perfect meal
S0579	yes i like french cook though basically quite nice
S0454	mm can be heavy though cos erm you know cream sauce can be quite heavy if you're not use to it suppose it depend on the sauce they do nice soup in france
S0579	right yeah mm
S0454	like seafood soup
S0579	seafood yeah yeah
S0454	mm yes they do that well
S0579	and we go go with somewhere not too far back some part of france
S0454	mm
S0579	i remember the people be very good when we go over there yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	and we meet up with somewhere
S0454	oh in rhone mm
S0579	yeah rhone i think yeah
S0454	yes do you like italian food
S0579	well if you ask me do i prefer italian food to english food no i prefer english food
S0454	these pears be nice very ripe
S0579	oh nice be they yeah yeah
S0454	mm delicious
S0579	yes pear be a nice fruit
S0454	mm
S0579	i do well we've get a pear tree here somewhere
S0454	mm
S0579	the trouble be i think the bird have usually get them before me
S0454	yeah and the bird peck at them don't they it's annoy with them cos the apples they don't like as much do they but the pears they love the pears cos they're softer
S0579	yeah but the pears on the floor you go and pick one up it's always on the floor and they've peck away at it yeah
S0454	mm yeah that's annoy i suppose the only thing you can do be net them isn't it but then that's a pain
S0579	oh yes we use to net them years ago
S0454	that be all you can do
S0579	i don't know if you remember here i use to have a fruit cage
S0454	mm i remember that for the berry yeah
S0579	yeah yeah all the strawberries and also the raspberries and er blackcurrants and redcurrants and whitecurrants
S0454	yeah i remember that
S0579	yeah i suppose er i suppose they go out of use i suppose i haven't bother with it
S0454	mm but i think the tree get too big as well didn't they so they shade it out
S0579	that's right yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	oh they use to have quite a lot of food there one time
S0454	mm
S0579	yeah yeah it be a nice sardine though do you you have sardines do you yeah well it's nice yeah
S0454	delicious i do yeah mm yeah i like them
S0579	be that largely a spanish food

S0579	spanish be it because those that type of fish
S0454	yes they have sardines a lot that's very popular
S0454	fresh sardines
S0579	yeah that's what you smell everywhere
S0454	yes that's what you smell yes that's very typical particularly northern spain or galicia
S0454	that's very very popular yeah and cheap
S0579	i don't when we go to spain don't think we ever to madrid at all when we be there
S0454	no madrid's different cos it's in land you don't get the fish
S0579	no
S0454	i didn't like the food in madrid that's totally different it's all meat cos of course they don't have fish
S0579	yes and we decide not to go to madrid i remember yeah
S0454	mm yeah i didn't like the food there so much but yeah northern spain be where you get the fish and the seafood and that's fantastic
S0579	yeah
S0454	southern spain's more sort of tapas which be different again

S0579	oh
S0454	and we both teach english

S0579	oh
S0454	i think she secretly like it
S0579	yeah
S0454	although she have to say otherwise
S0579	yeah i think they'd abolish all that haven't they
S0454	erm in barcelona it's ban now
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i think it's very political
S0579	oh
S0454	so they ban it because they hate madrid and they want to be independent
S0579	oh
S0454	and i think it didn't have much to do with the animals madrid it's still go strong
S0579	yeah
S0454	and as soon as barcelona ban it erm madrid do the opposite and make it a national treasure
S0579	oh
S0454	so they
S0579	cos there's part of spain where they're not spanish almost isn't there but some part of there
S0454	yeah but not all over spain it it's part of spain
S0579	almost yeah
S0454	i think some part of spain have never have it and other part it's extremely traditional
S0579	mm
S0454	yeah it be brutal though because they have erm bullfighting in south america but it's completely different they don't kill the bull
S0579	no oh don't they
S0454	no so it's sort of dance around the bull and jump on it and things but they never ever hurt the bull
S0579	oh i remember when mum and i saw it they they slaughter it there and then like yeah
S0454	yeah so spain they kill it and actually
S0579	look terrible there
S0454	bullfighting's big in oman believe it or not
S0579	be it yeah
S0454	but it's completely different it's one bull against another bull
S0579	oh
S0454	and they can kill each other but they don't usually that's interest
S0579	oh this one we have the matador there
S0454	yes yeah they be in trouble weren't they the other day cos he have a baby in his arm one of these matadors and he go you know he start provoke a bull and you think well that's very irresponsible that child could be gore
S0579	well they take a child do they yeah
S0454	yeah a baby in his arm that be ridiculous
S0579	that's just part of show off i suppose yeah
S0454	he be show off yes he get in trouble over it i think well you deserve it that's really irresponsible
S0454	it's one thing for a grow man to go in
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean that's his choice isn't it but
S0579	i think i think it be yeah
S0454	different with a bay
S0579	i think your grandma give up on it and come out i think
S0454	yes
S0579	didn't like it all this
S0454	then they have that run of the bull don't they in pamplona
S0579	oh no yes we've see that we've be there
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah all run chase out jump the doorways all the windows board up
S0454	hemingway write about that didn't he
S0579	oh do he yeah
S0454	he live there for a while and he write about it
S0579	yes i all the all the windows be bar up
S0454	i'm not surprise
S0579	all this wooden stuff everywhere
S0454	wouldn't want a bull through it would you
S0579	no no
S0454	yes interest
S0579	we've see a bull i've see we've see that bull rush though we've see them run yeah
S0454	yeah that's something and that's different to kill them i suppose that's not the aim they just run from one end of the city to the other don't they
S0579	yeah yeah yeah that's right yeah yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	have you see that too
S0454	no i haven't no it's very popular now people come from all over the world to go and see it
S0579	yeah it be crowd when when we saw it yeah
S0454	mm people get injure every year
S0579	oh there's always somebody hurt yeah
S0454	yes but it's difficult isn't it it's like the whale hunt
S0579	mm
S0454	i suppose whale hunt it's easier to make an argument to ban it because they're endanger species
S0579	oh right yeah
S0454	whereas bull aren't endanger
S0579	where do we see those things oh we go down to the falklands that's right
S0454	oh you saw whale
S0579	yeah the whale be down there when we go down there
S0454	mm yeah
S0579	a lot of whale do down that part
S0454	mm yes japan still have an annual whale hunt but it be very traditional you can't argue about that
S0579	yeah
S0454	and it be an important part of their diet it's not any more but yeah but i suppose if they're endanger they're endanger aren't they you can't just say well i've always kill them so i'm gonna carry on
S0579	i i just i think it be yes down the falklands somewhere where they have a statue of a big whale i think on you know lie around yeah
S0454	oh right mm
S0579	it be who like south america yeah
S0454	i'd like to go yes i will one day
S0579	i think he only go once on the school trip i think he say
S0454	ah right mum and dad want to go on a cruise
S0579	do she what's that for
S0454	they're not go this year this year they're go to austria
S0579	bet your dad's interest in cruise isn't he

S0579	i don't expect so
S0454	no oh might be oh not sure then not to egypt anyway

S0579	have you be to egypt have you
S0454	no you know it's i'd like to see the pyramid but i think yeah that's put me off go to morocco actually
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	i can imagine egypt's very similar with the kind of hassle
S0579	well when you've be so when you've be in one of those you've be to the lot anyhow
S0454	well i suppose so yeah
S0579	they all they all look a bite similar
S0454	yes just go to the british museum and see all the things we steal
S0579	no
S0454	half the mummies be there yeah i don't know i find morocco a real headache actually so
S0579	it's funny that er cos i think like morocco
S0454	i know yeah i'm sure why
S0579	no well no we didn't bother with it either
S0454	i wasn't impress at all there's a lovely roman ruin but then you could say the same about lot of place in europe couldn't you you could go to italy and see them
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	you don't need to go to morocco and see them
S0579	there be more of them in italy
S0454	there might be less people but i don't know just find the whole thing a headache yeah there's not a lot to see i didn't think apart from the roman ruin the cities weren't anything special
S0579	no no
S0454	you'd be better off go to to italy or greece or something if you want to see nice towns the food's nothing special
S0579	yeah but have you be to italy yet
S0454	no no i haven't i'd like to go
S0579	no

S0454	oh yes vesuvius
S0579	i be there too yeah

S0579	she be yeah
S0454	yeah pompeii that would be worth visit
S0579	yeah pompeii yeah that's an interest place
S0454	mm yes i always find er japan have quite a lot of volcanoes
S0579	in fact italy have quite a quite a lot of you know sort of erm interest things there yeah
S0454	yes a lot to see there yes lot of history and then you've get the volcanoes yeah it's interest
S0579	it isn't well not much i didn't care much for milan up in the north but
S0454	er yeah oh actually i have be to italy yes i've be to i've be to milan actually but only change plan but i have to change
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	airports so i do actually go into milan and have a look round
S0579	oh it's a big city up there though yeah
S0454	mm it's a nice city yes
S0579	yeah well it's quite different to the rest of italy though
S0454	but yeah i'd rather go to somewhere rural i think
S0579	yeah it's always nice
S0454	yes yeah
S0579	where do we go we've be several time course i go with your mum didn't we somewhere
S0454	mm
S0579	where do we go with
S0454	you go to rome i know you've be to rome with her but i expect you stop in a few place in italy
S0579	yeah we do yes we basically run to meet up with er
S0454	with yes
S0579	but we go to other place of course and we've be two or three time before
S0454	mm
S0579	what be they say oh it have change a lot actually what they be sell
S0454	yeah
S0579	there be chap go round in cart can't be ice cream but there be something they be sell
S0454	no
S0579	yeah
S0454	very patriotic the italians
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	more than other countries in europe actually
S0579	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0454	cos i teach italian teenagers this summer in they they be so patriotic you know they'd be really lethargic in the classroom until you say oh we're do a presentation about our countries and then oh my goodness they would work hard prepare this presentation cos they want the world to know and
S0579	oh
S0454	very patriotic they love their country that's nice though it's good
S0579	yeah i mean
S0454	healthy
S0579	well general franco didn't do em much good though do he
S0454	no well i suppose they're too young to know aren't they
S0579	they be yeah no no no no
S0454	they're probably something their parent don't mention
S0579	yeah no no there's well nobody do now cos it's a long time ago i suppose
S0454	yes
S0579	general franco
S0454	yeah
S0579	i think i think there's one part of spain where they still think a lot of him
S0454	yeah galicia actually
S0579	oh be it there
S0454	when i be there some people be still staunch supporters i be really surprise and they would openly say it and i'd think oh goodness
S0579	yeah that's i think it be
S0454	you know you're out of touch
S0579	no er
S0454	cos the rest of europe hasn't get anything positive to say about him
S0579	no that's right
S0454	but you see some people do well out of him
S0579	oh yes yes
S0454	that be the thing i mean never mind the fact that you butcher you know many millions elsewhere but
S0579	well you could always remember those who who support him in the when in the fight of course this what's it and they be
S0454	well yes he favour those who support him so people in galicia get give house you know like huge
S0579	do they yes
S0454	country house which he'd appropriate of course against
S0579	yeah
S0454	from his enemies and you know lock them up and put them in prison and kill them but never mind that you know they do very well they get a nice country estate out of it
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm so they support him they're like what's the problem
S0579	cos there when we be there there be a lot of big estates with rather wealthy people yes
S0454	yes well there still be and you wonder how those people get them to be honest
S0579	oh yeah yeah yes that's right yeah
S0454	and then they've get this law of forget haven't they where the the court aren't allow to investigate the disappearances which just seem incredible to me they be ban from erm investigate and then the one that do get kill about a year ago
S0579	oh
S0454	he be investigate and be tell he have to stop and so as far as i know he do or at least he do publicly but he probably carry on in private and then he have a mysterious accident or something
S0579	do they bump off i've forget now do they bump off a lot of people in spain during the war
S0454	yes and then they've never be investigate
S0454	there's all these mass grave
S0579	yeah all over the place
S0454	and they're they're not you know mark or anything and
S0579	just into heap
S0454	for those people who lose family members
S0579	yeah
S0454	they've never get over it because there's be no justice i mean there
S0579	yeah
S0454	i suppose at least if there be some kind of court case they might feel
S0579	yeah
S0454	someone be hold accountable but these people be politicians who do it
S0579	course it be france he be sort of anti communist wasn't he i mean
S0454	yes but not just anti communist he didn't like the people in what's that call in the north where they speak a different the basque country he hat them
S0579	oh the basque yeah basque yeah i know
S0454	and he bomb that erm guernica wasn't it
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	yes they dislike them cos
S0454	he didn't like the basques
S0579	it's still part of spain though isn't it but they consider themselves as separate
S0454	yes but he that's right and the really didn't like that cos he be very nationalist erm and they want to break away so didn't get on
S0579	course he be a good friend of hitler at the time
S0454	that's right well that's another thing
S0454	yes
S0579	well
S0454	yes but i don't think spain be a very fracture country and i think that's a lot of the reason why because they've just bury their past and unlike germany who've have you know a very public
S0579	yeah
S0454	out of people and they're still prosecute people from the war spain just bury it all they just say we don't want to know we're not go to prosecute
S0579	i remember your your grandma and myself sit on a wall look out from about a mile away we be up high and they they have one of these big processions go on
S0454	oh right
S0579	and it be go i mean it be literally go on for seem for miles it wasn't just like
S0454	cor right
S0579	a hundred or two or there there be a thousand on some pilgrimage somewhere
S0454	oh right
S0579	they seem to go in for pilgrimages in spain
S0454	oh yes they're big on that yes
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	i do it from
S0579	you do it do you
S0454	yeah i do the camina de santiago which be erm
S0579	that's the one i'm think of yeah
S0454	a pilgrimage there's like nine or ten different rout i didn't do the main one the main one be from france to
S0579	yeah
S0454	the pyrenees to santiago de compostela which take about two months believe it or not
S0579	
S0454	well i i didn't do that one i do the ten day route from portugal i just think it would be a nice thing to do
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	cheap holiday too because all along the way they have these hostels run by the local council they only cost five euros a night about three pound
S0579	oh that's cheap yeah
S0454	and you would take your own food but there be a kitchen
S0579	yeah
S0454	or i just use to eat out i use to have a loaf of bread and make sandwich for you know for the day and have i think toast for breakfast
S0579	mm
S0454	then i'd just have a meal out which aren't very expensive in spain it be all very simple food they do get a bite of wine half a bottle of wine very simple pork or something like that you know loin of pork grill
S0579	i don't know whether there still be but spain be very very catholic at one time when we use to go to it
S0454	yeah i don't think it be
S0579	all the church use to be full up completely
S0454	yes now it seem to be die but i don't think
S0579	it's die out be it yeah
S0454	the value have be lose the you know things like family value be very strong there
S0579	oh yes
S0454	more than the uk yeah that be a nice thing to do though the pilgrimage i really enjoy that
S0579	spain get a good football team they've get
S0454	well yeah they i suppose they do don't they
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	they love football there
S0579	yeah
S0454	no that's their religion now real madrid and barcelona
S0579	yeah i think they stop all the stuff er kill the bull and stuff there haven't they
S0454	no they still have it in some place madrid have it but barcelona stop it
S0579	oh i think they stop it all the whole of spain not the whole of spain
S0454	no madrid do the opposite as soon as barcelona ban it then they
S0454	they take over yeah yeah
S0579	yes your mum couldn't stand to look at it too long
S0454	no
S0579	your grandma i mean
S0454	well must be quite gory
S0579	didn't look very nice with i mean blood be spill all over the place
S0454	no it's difficult to ban things like that though i suppose
S0454	it's not like they're in any danger of die out as a species
S0579	do we do we watch of those things
S0454	no i wouldn't go actually i i wouldn't want to see that but i can understand why people do
S0579	well it look to be a very brave chap who's fight one of those things
S0454	yeah must be very brave but then it's the odds be always stack against the bull so
S0579	yeah well at the end of the day that's the bull get trouble
S0454	yeah
S0579	get its throat cut whatever
S0454	but i suppose it be kind of cultural imperialism for
S0454	other countries in europe to try and ban it i mean we have things here that be cruel
S0579	yeah
S0454	farm of pig be cruel in this country all you know cram into tiny cage but we didn't start ban that do we so i suppose as long as we have things like that
S0579	oh no yeah
S0454	then how can we complain about the bull the bull's have a nice life actually it's be wander around in field feed the best food in the world and it's get a bite of misery at the end okay well that's fine
S0579	i don't how they use to slaughter er those things though cattle
S0454	well they stun cattle don't they
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes i mean cattle's not so bad i be think more
S0454	you know the animals that be keep in cage all their life
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	and never get to go outside so things like pig and chickens
S0579	oh they're keep away yeah
S0454	that do seem cruel i mean that's crueller to me
S0579	yeah
S0454	than a bullfight cos at least the bull have a nice life
S0579	yeah
S0454	and those bull be probably five years old
S0579	yeah
S0454	so it's have five nice years and then okay it have an unpleasant half an hour at the end that's not very nice
S0579	okay well he then he doesn't remember the rest of his life
S0454	yes but it probably doesn't remember do it
S0579	no
S0454	but that seem crueller to keep an animal inside in a cage all its life to me so perhaps we haven't get the right
S0579	no
S0454	to tell spain what to do with its bull
S0579	perhaps some of the zoos still have animals keep in don't they some of them
S0454	yes that's not right either be it
S0579	no
S0454	i suppose zoos
S0579	they use to have one at bristol but i think they close that down didn't they
S0454	oh i don't know i don't know about that london zoo's popular you know what have disappear animals in circuses
S0579	you what
S0454	animals in circuses
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos when i be young that use to be really common didn't it go to the circus and see the tigers and things
S0454	but that's disappear
S0579	oh yes we'll all see all these big vehicles turn up with tigers in the back
S0454	that's right that's completely go yeah i mean circuses be still go but nothing like
S0579	oh no
S0454	before
S0579	no these it be use to be a very big day the circus
S0454	yeah it be lovely wasn't it
S0579	arrive as you have these chap on these big walk stick about fifteen feet in the air yeah
S0454	yes yeah that be a nice thing they use to come round smaller towns i suppose now you have to go to a big town to see a circus
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then it wouldn't be animals it would be people
S0579	i think we still have one in you know
S0454	oh do you that's nice mm
S0579	yeah
S0454	but that be cruel wasn't it i suppose keep tigers in tiny cage that wasn't right and elephants and things i wonder what happen to them all
S0579	no mm
S0454	i wonder what they do with all those
S0454	i remember go when i be younger i i don't remember where
S0579	we take you somewhere in outside of where we saw some animals didn't we
S0454	yes yes we go to some sort of not a zoo
S0579	yeah
S0454	not a safari park though something in between sort of in field and things yes that be nice i like those
S0579	you'd've only about eight or nine then i suppose be you
S0454	yes yeah i love animals though didn't i
S0454	i still like them
S0579	yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	your grandma use to like cat i didn't
S0454	oh right
S0579	i i always dislike cat i like dog but not cat
S0454	yeah yes cat i always felt if they be a bite bigger they would eat you whereas dog would be loyal
S0579	yeah
S0454	it wouldn't matter if the dog be bigger than you the dog would still look after you but a cat i just think it's because you're bigger than it that it doesn't attack you
S0579	oh
S0454	i don't think they've get any loyalty to people at all
S0579	i hadn't think of it that way round no
S0454	i think we're
S0579	i just dislike cat yeah
S0454	i think a lot of people be suspicious of cat cos cat can be quite cruel can't they with kill prey as well they'll play with their pray
S0579	yeah
S0454	they won't just kill it
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	like they love play with mice
S0579	oh
S0454	and then they'll play with it for age whereas a dog will just go in and kill it that's the end of it usually
S0579	mm mm i i dunno yes your grandma use to like cat that's right she always use to have them at home
S0454	oh right
S0579	so you could fee it
S0454	yes yes

S0454	yeah it might be the green woodpecker they like orchards they they might hang out in the orchard although you do see them on lawns too i suppose and have he you'll know if it's him cos he's get this very strange flight they go like this

S0454	inland it can be a bite greasy but if you on the coast very nice yeah
S0579	it's it's quite a bite country when you come to mileage wise isn't it yeah yeah
S0454	it be yes it be a big country
S0579	it look smallish on the map but but it it's quite big
S0454	yes yes i think it's deceptive on the map
S0454	portugal i like food's
S0579	yeah we we we like portugal yeah we take yeah we've be to portugal several time
S0454	different yeah the one thing spain can't do be bread it's awful bread in spain cos think about france france be know for its bread the french bread and then portugal do excellent bread but for some reason the spanish have never learn how to make it it's awful stuff
S0579	oh well no
S0454	all that white slice loaf not very nice flavourless
S0579	oh no no i agree
S0454	but other food they do really well it's funny
S0579	i think well you like portugal no
S0454	yes i like portugal the portuguese be nice nice people
S0579	i think me and we go to lisbon i think
S0454	oh right
S0579	so we call in and one or two other place but i think think we call in at lisbon yeah cos as far as far as i remember now see a big sign when you arrive be in big letter which say lisbon
S0454	oh lovely
S0579	you know to welcome you like
S0454	yes
S0579	mm
S0579	i think your mum's do quite a bite of travel haven't they
S0454	they've do a lot yeah it's good yeah it's good to have an interest
S0579	yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	she use to she leave at home poor man
S0454	i know she's off now isn't she
S0579	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0454	she's up in on her three day walk
S0579	oh of course of course yeah
S0454	but i mean he could've go if he want to
S0579	didn't want to yeah
S0454	but he didn't want to i don't i never quite understand that though cos they both like outdoor things
S0579	yeah
S0454	and they seem to end up do it separately a lot
S0579	i don't suppose would want to go the big
S0454	oh no she wouldn't want to do that
S0579	place yeah
S0454	but she's off to the orkney isles this summer to do a ten day cycle trip on her own
S0579	be she on her own oh
S0454	yeah it's good isn't it
S0579	that take a bite of do on your own
S0454	i think so yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	that's quite brave
S0579	it must seem a bite bore to be on your own wouldn't it
S0454	yeah it might be yeah i hope she's okay
S0579	yeah she might like it but yeah
S0454	yes might be a bite lonely
S0579	do about twenty five miles and don't speak to anybody
S0454	yes
S0454	yes that's true she's go to take a smartphone with her so that she can contact people easily which be a good idea
S0579	oh it's pretty sensible i suppose
S0454	yes yeah they find an iphone the other day on a walk
S0579	do they
S0454	yeah when they come to near me er we go on a walk and dad find an iphone just in a field
S0579	someone just drop it yeah
S0454	yes they say oh mum say oh that's nice i'll have that i say mum do you know how much those cost they're about three hundred pound
S0579	oh be that what they cost be it
S0454	or more they cost five hundred pound new a lot of them
S0579	oh
S0454	i say you can't just take it you've get to give it to the police and she look quite upset
S0579	do she
S0454	it's funny isn't it people's attitude to
S0579	yeah
S0454	to crime
S0579	crime
S0454	cos if that be a wallet or if she find a five pound note
S0454	she would always hand it in
S0454	she would definitely hand in money and she would be very angry if someone steal a wallet you know cos she would see that as steal but an iphone she couldn't see anything wrong with that she go oh they'll have insurance
S0579	oh
S0454	but they've probably get insurance for their wallet too but it's still we all know it's wrong to take someone's wallet
S0579	take a wallet yeah
S0454	and we no probably none of us would do that but i say mum that's get to go to the police she say oh and dad be like oh well and i say no you've get to hand it in
S0454	it's funny dad's very honest and he say no no i will hand it in but i'll hand it in in
S0579	oh yes
S0454	think that it'll be too much hassle for you know this person to go and get it
S0579	oh
S0454	which it probably
S0579	so what happen if they don't collect it
S0454	well that's what i ask dad cos i know the rule use to be with wallets if no one claim it i don't know how many weeks
S0579	certain time yeah
S0454	then you've get to keep the money
S0579	oh
S0454	but i don't know what the time limit be but there be erm
S0579	oh no
S0454	a finders' rule but nowadays i don't know maybe the police pocket all the money
S0579	no
S0454	who know
S0579	so no good pick up a five pound note then
S0454	no
S0579	gotta hand it over
S0454	well i suppose if you find loose money there'd be no point go to the police would there if it be five pound but if you find a wallet then you should definitely hand it in
S0579	i do that once come down the train from london
S0454	mm
S0579	down to and i put my coat up on the top shelf somewhere over above
S0454	yeah
S0579	and take my coat down and my wallet fell out apparently
S0454	oh
S0579	and and so when i get off the station of course or at least get out of the train couldn't find my wallet
S0454	oh no
S0579	so i guess it must be on there so i go into the rail office and they say we'll ring the driver
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	which they do and they find it
S0454	oh that's good
S0579	yeah so i
S0454	yeah
S0579	so what happen oh oh they leave it off at the next station they stop at
S0454	oh that's very kind
S0579	they tell me just to
S0454	yeah to drive down there
S0579	call in there
S0454	yes
S0579	you know
S0454	yeah i've lose phone before and get them back the same kind of thing it's fall out of my pocket and i've get that back the driver's go and check and i've have that back the next day yeah so it be good
S0579	well some of these people things buy these days cameras and stuff and sort i mean of course you've get five hundred pound some of those phone yeah
S0454	i know that iphone could well've be two or three hundred pound i reckon
S0579	pound yeah yeah
S0454	i mean it may be damage but even so
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah it's funny mum say oh i'll have that
S0579	i'm i must say i be very i be very surprise when they tell me he'd he'd stop off at the next station and drop it off there which of course they do yeah
S0454	yeah that's nice mm
S0579	i do be drive down yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	er oh another one i have oh yes i suppose when we use to live in somerset i suppose where would i've be i must've be doze off on the train it go past the station
S0454	yeah mm
S0579	and i be i look out think that's the wrong way i think it or something be about four miles out
S0579	so i just pull the cord
S0454	oh no
S0454	get in trouble nowadays do that
S0579	i know i just jump out and race across jump a couple of line and go
S0454	oh dear
S0579	i oh yeah i didn't get catch no
S0579	that be your grandma's favourite form of travel train
S0454	they be nice it's relax think grandma get the bus once erm to chester and she go the wrong way or something and she go past the stop and she be in a dreadful state
S0579	who be this
S0454	grandma
S0579	do she
S0454	yes
S0579	i've forget be i there then
S0454	no she would've come up on her own after one of the birth to look after the
S0579	oh be that what happen
S0454	yes
S0579	oh i see
S0454	she probably wasn't use to travel on her own
S0579	no what age be you then
S0454	oh i would can't've be more than six
S0579	oh very young then yeah yeah
S0454	yes cos be bear in
S0579	oh yes oh yes
S0454	mm
S0579	you you haven't mend your ways with him yet
S0454	
S0454	no no
S0579	no
S0454	i don't think that's ever go to be okay to be honest
S0579	well he's try he's try very hard to do the other thing hasn't he he yeah he be
S0454	well i don't know
S0579	oh i think he try to be
S0454	i think he's probably a a good father
S0579	yeah
S0454	he's probably a very good father
S0579	yes er his daughter adore him
S0454	yes no he's probably an excellent father
S0579	yeah
S0454	he would he would want to be but unfortunately not a very good brother
S0579	oh well no well perhaps he's perhaps he's change now
S0454	maybe
S0579	someone say he want to be friends i don't know
S0454	yeah well he's not make much effort
S0579	oh be he not oh yeah
S0454	no no he never say sorry never take any responsibility but and erm
S0579	do he not
S0454	yes just seem to want to blame other people so that's not very mature
S0579	no no no no
S0454	but anyway i suppose he's get that from somewhere yes
S0579	i think he'd get better when he after he'd be to er in the east and in the army and that
S0454	oh yeah i'm sure he's i'm sure he would be an excellent father he would
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos he like children he would be he would care about them and look after them yeah
S0579	and your grandma always like him come to
S0454	yes yeah that's nice
S0579	he use to come on his own sometimes i think
S0454	yes that's nice yes
S0579	yeah so yeah so yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	so she use to give him full mark occasionally
S0454	yes
S0579	i use to put him on the bus
S0454	yes that's right cos he come and do his work experience didn't he
S0579	yeah that's right yeah he's that's right that's oh that's right put him on the bus
S0454	mm
S0579	send him off
S0454	yeah
S0579	he didn't i think he go on the naval course somewhere didn't he be it naval
S0454	that's right he go er to dock didn't he and
S0579	that's right yeah
S0454	well he be only about fifteen probably but er
S0579	he'd've only be a youngster yeah that's right yeah
S0454	yes he spend a couple a least a week there didn't he
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	yes that be good good experience for him
S0579	yeah i think he like keep torment you didn't he think so
S0454	yes
S0454	no he wasn't very nice grow up
S0579	no no i suppose not no no
S0454	well it's different when you're a child but when you're an adult that's not really acceptable
S0579	oh he still remain the same as an adult do he
S0454	yes i mean as a child you can forgive someone and think
S0579	yeah
S0454	well they be young
S0579	yeah
S0454	however annoy they be
S0579	yeah
S0454	but when someone's an adult and they're well he's violent towards me to be honest
S0579	yeah when do you last see erm see him then
S0454	erm oh at grandma's funeral i saw him
S0579	oh yes
S0454	he be here then
S0579	oh yes that's a couple of years back so you've see him
S0454	no he's not very nice to me to be honest
S0579	well not now he isn't
S0454	no no he's not very nice
S0579	oh oh that's not very nice then
S0454	no
S0579	he should've get over that by now
S0454	yes yeah i suppose he's always have a problem with alcohol hasn't he he drink too much and that's when his bad behaviour come out
S0579	do he still drink too much do he
S0454	yes
S0579	that's army stuff i suppose
S0454	and then well no he's always do it so i don't think it's the army's fault
S0579	no
S0454	probably the army help him to be honest because you you can't turn up drink to work can you there
S0579	no no no that'll get in you trouble
S0454	i mean you can't turn up drink to work anywhere but
S0579	yeah
S0454	of course the the army would be quite strict
S0579	oh i remember him now you say that because he
S0454	yes he's always have a problem
S0579	he come to see us once with and i i
S0454	that's right and they both get drink didn't they behave very badly
S0579	oh yes they be yeah they have all those er there be some tin of beer inside er
S0454	yes
S0579	they find where they be they drink them between them
S0454	yes
S0579	no oh i think er find them that's right
S0454	yeah no it's not okay to do that
S0579	and and he he he tell them all off i think
S0454	yes
S0454	and again it's different if you're a child cos it's up to the child cos it's up to the parent to to control the alcohol in the house isn't it
S0579	yes
S0454	you can't expect a child to
S0579	no
S0454	to manage their drink
S0579	yes yes
S0454	but as an adult that's not acceptable
S0579	i think now though er i think er acknowledge it be all wrong what he be do with erm with er
S0454	yes
S0579	cos he be a bite older in any case
S0454	that's right be the older one so he should've be more responsible
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	yeah it's all very well blame but be probably just copy
S0579	well yes just copy i suppose yes yeah yeah
S0454	yes yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	oh well
S0579	it it it may heal in time
S0454	i don't think so i mean if someone's violent that's it as far as i'm concern you can't hold knives against people's throats and threaten to kill them
S0579	he he hasn't do that to you have he
S0454	yes he have mum know that
S0579	oh do he
S0454	but she think that's okay so
S0579	oh that's wrong no
S0454	threaten to kill me threaten to kill
S0579	do he
S0454	yeah i mean he's he be drink probably
S0579	oh yeah of course
S0454	but that's not acceptable
S0579	no
S0454	and once you cross that line and i don't care whether it's a man or a woman
S0579	no
S0454	that's not okay and this be his brother and sister
S0579	oh no when he do that you think you'd call in the police more than anything else
S0454	i'm sorry i didn't actually
S0579	yeah
S0454	i'm really sorry i didn't but he be my brother so i suppose you don't think of call the police
S0579	i know but someone put your throat you you you have to report it cos of er if he doesn't kill you this time he might do it to somebody else
S0454	well that's it that's what i've decide i'm not go to see him any more
S0579	oh no
S0454	because you can't be safe around people like that and unfortunately cos he's drink he'll just sort of brush it off the next day and say oh well i be drink
S0579	yeah
S0454	like well you can still kill someone when you're drink can't you
S0579	yeah
S0454	be sober do would probably be better
S0579	i think he like go to the pubs now doesn't he
S0454	yeah i mean have a drink that's fine we all have a drink don't we
S0579	yeah
S0454	but we don't all go around hold knives against people's throat and threaten to kill them
S0579	well no i no not a very nice thing to do no no
S0454	no so to be honest i don't feel safe around him
S0579	don't you not with no
S0454	well not if someone hold carve knives against your no and threaten to slit it
S0579	oh no no no frighten you for life
S0454	so that's that that's why i can't deal with him
S0579	no no no
S0454	it be a long time ago but it happen more than once and years apart i mean
S0454	i mean not that it's okay if you do it once but when someone have a pattern of behaviour when they get drink
S0579	yeah
S0454	and you can't feel safe around them
S0579	no cos er this that's very often the case when people get drink cos they do things they wouldn't otherwise do
S0454	well i'm sure he wouldn't
S0579	no
S0454	and i'm sure he'd never behave like that in front of his children either
S0579	no no no
S0454	drink or otherwise but he probably doesn't get drink around his children but
S0579	no no i don't think he drink too much now do he
S0454	mm i wouldn't've think well
S0579	although i i believe he use to drink a lot when when er be around do he
S0454	yes that's the trouble and that you see that's when i see him at party and things and that's when he's most likely to get drink isn't it
S0579	cos i remember that's right when he be stay here i suppose
S0454	yes
S0579	there be and i think and 's saw them they'd see where the beer can be and they'd take them out
S0454	yes
S0579	and and and saw them drink these things
S0454	yes
S0579	and 's in no time tell them off and put them down
S0454	well good that's good and he's do the same at 's house and i know she be very put out
S0579	oh so they've do the same at 's have they yeah yeah
S0454	yeah yeah
S0579	oh well
S0454	but i mean there's one thing get drink it's quite another thing to become violent towards someone
S0579	well that's that's horrendous
S0454	i mean that's a different i mean lot of people get drink it might be bad manners and
S0579	yes
S0454	rude but in itself
S0454	you know it's not the end of the world be it i mean it's rude
S0579	do he become aggressive with it do he or
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah he do yeah
S0454	and he's never say sorry or take any kind of responsibility in fact the opposite he'll say oh why be you still upset about it you think hang on a minute you know you have a knife against my throat and you say you'd kill me
S0579	what do he say to that then
S0454	he's just like oh well you know she shouldn't bear a grudge
S0579	oh no no
S0454	oh for goodness' sake it's not a grudge
S0454	i mean this be fear
S0579	and say you'd do that to i mean yes
S0454	i mean it be just crazy
S0579	yeah yeah that's a fair point
S0454	and this wasn't when he be in the army cos they do say you know when you see things in the war people
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	you know that this wasn't when he nothing to do with the army this be before
S0579	bite different yeah no no no
S0454	he be in the military so
S0579	yeah
S0454	he just have a something there
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean i to be to be honest i think someone who do that must be a bite mentally ill
S0454	because i don't think normal people go round and do that with or without alcohol
S0579	well he no no no cos i mean he be normally that would frighten people in any case wouldn't it
S0454	yeah so i don't
S0579	usually mean there's something wrong with them someone hold a knife to your throat
S0454	i think there might be something wrong with them
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean cos he have that do you remember when he be young he deliberately shoot himself in the foot
S0579	oh with my one of my rifle wasn't it
S0454	i mean that's not normal be it who
S0579	do that at do it here
S0454	yeah i mean who do that that's not right in the head
S0579	well i don't know whether he do whether he do it deliberately as he say it i can't remember now
S0454	well i don't think we ever know do we
S0579	no
S0454	but i mean it'd be quite difficult to do it by accident
S0579	well he have to pull the trigger to kick off this yeah yeah
S0454	well exactly so i think he probably do do it deliberately and then you just think well who would do that and there probably be something a bite wrong and he be quite young wasn't he
S0579	well i remember
S0454	probably about ten
S0579	yes er here we i get an air rifle here of course
S0454	yes i know it be only an air rifle it wasn't like a you know a cartridge
S0579	no but if it hit well if it hit you in the eye it'd blind you
S0454	well exactly yes i mean it's not to mess around with
S0579	well i know your i think your mum be look out of the window actually and saw him
S0454	yes
S0579	he have this gun point at me
S0454	well exactly and that make you worry
S0579	i i i i be walk away from him to er see whether he'd hit the target he have the gun up as if he be ready to shoot
S0454	yeah i know and that worry me
S0579	no and it worry mum and she come out at him too
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i again i just think
S0454	you know who do that i know he be young but still i think we all know
S0579	i don't well i don't think he be intend to i i i wouldn't've think he'd pull the trigger on me no
S0454	wasn't that young be he no
S0579	but he on that sort of thing you may just touch the trigger lightly and it go off yeah yeah yeah
S0454	well that's the thing isn't it yeah
S0579	doesn't take much to touch the trigger
S0454	well no it's quite easy to do isn't it with a trigger it's not yes
S0579	yeah i be i know some of my early train when i be in the royal air force the thing we have to do be to use er various things like rifle and submachine gun just to defend your aircraft if they be attack
S0454	yes
S0579	and they use to frighten the life out ot me
S0454	yes i'm not surprise yes
S0579	no no i didn't wanna know much about that no no
S0454	no
S0579	er yeah he's change a lot now of course
S0454	may've do but
S0579	yeah
S0454	i suppose you know i'll always be scar of him won't i
S0579	probably yes i suppose but
S0454	i mean it's a line you cross with a woman
S0579	yeah
S0454	and once you've cross it that's that
S0579	yes
S0454	there's no go back
S0579	yes i i i would imagine all all that's go by now he's too old isn't he
S0454	maybe or maybe he'll always be like it
S0579	and he's get young children who adore him hasn't he
S0454	yes and i'm sure he's a great father
S0579	yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	and what's what's his girl's name isn't it
S0454	be it yeah i think it's yeah
S0579	yeah she keep him in order quite a bite
S0454	yes i imagine she'd be good with him actually
S0579	yes i mean i've see her she
S0454	yeah and she's a good mum that's obvious cos her children be very well behave
S0579	yeah that's right and er the last time we ever when we last saw be er there she he be give she be give the instructions to like
S0454	yeah
S0579	get me that and he be run off
S0454	yes that's right no i'm sure she's very good
S0579	yeah keep him in line so she be obviously in command of him really
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah that's good yes
S0579	have she go into be she be go to go into nurse i don't know if she ever do or not
S0454	yes i don't know what happen with that she be do some care work for a while wasn't she
S0579	yeah i think she be yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	have you meet her then
S0454	yes once yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i suppose she get pregnant so she couldn't she have to stop that cos you can't really cos care you have to lift people and things don't you
S0579	no
S0454	and you can't do that when you're pregnant
S0579	no no yeah
S0454	so she have to stop that for a while
S0579	but they seem to get on quite well i think
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah i'm certain i'm certain that the the young girls they they seem to like him enormously yeah
S0454	yeah yes yes right she'd be a good nurse actually
S0579	yeah no no
S0454	cos she's obviously a care person
S0579	yeah
S0454	but it's probably a bite much with four quite young children
S0579	i suppose just want to show off a bite i expect
S0454	i expect that's what it be
S0579	yeah
S0454	but then he wasn't that young when that happen i mean it's one thing if you're five or even ten or fifteen but
S0579	mm yeah
S0454	he be probably twenty five last time that happen
S0579	oh be he oh that's very
S0454	so that's not really good enough
S0579	no not at twenty five no
S0454	no and of course he wasn't exactly small be he so he's very intimidate
S0579	well a big fellow he be now he look a big chap
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	and again maybe if someone say sorry afterwards that will never happen again
S0579	how old be he now then
S0454	must be thirty one
S0579	oh yes
S0454	yes
S0579	cos he seem to have change when i saw him last
S0454	yes
S0454	yes i'm i'm sure he's mature a bite i think the army probably do him good
S0579	yes and he and he's busy up get up at four o'clock in the morning go on these
S0454	so he's hard work isn't he
S0579	yeah hard work yeah he's
S0454	yes
S0579	he get extra money for all that i gather yes yes
S0454	yes yes it's good well it's not a bad job drive lorries be it there'll always there'll be work for a while to come
S0579	well and he well and he get people and they he tell me he have to stop off at various place have a chat with the with the other drivers
S0454	yes
S0579	then off they go again
S0454	yeah that's nice
S0579	yeah it be nice oh well perhaps they perhaps it will heal as time go by
S0454	i don't think so i don't think if someone's violent like that you really get over it to be honest
S0579	yeah well
S0454	i think i mean if that be your husband or something you'd tell someone well leave your husband wouldn't you you wouldn't say continue in a violent marriage
S0579	no no
S0454	i mean maybe in time go by people would put up with it
S0579	yeah
S0454	but nowadays you know people would say you need to call the police
S0579	yeah
S0454	this person be dangerous
S0579	what be he what do he attempt to do
S0454	he threaten to kill me and he hold a knife against my throat
S0579	oh oh do he really
S0454	not just once either
S0579	oh well no
S0454	and not when he be a child so
S0579	oh well that's a terrible thing to have do
S0454	it be and he's never say sorry and he know he do it
S0579	yeah
S0454	and be there both time actually and 's speak to him about it er you know say
S0454	oh yes you know i shouldn't've do that and that's not really good enough
S0579	no
S0454	no i'm sorry i didn't call the police on him actually but then it would've really upset mum
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i suppose and you don't think at the time
S0579	no cos your grandma use to like er yes
S0454	yeah well that's it that's why i didn't want to say to to someone like grandma cos it would've really upset her wouldn't it
S0579	oh yes she whoever complain against
S0454	yes
S0579	your your mum always defend him
S0454	well yes and my mum's the same
S0579	no my mum my
S0454	yeah well my mum's the same
S0579	be she the same be she
S0454	but that's the trouble you can't talk to her about it
S0579	oh no
S0454	doesn't matter what she know about it
S0579	yeah
S0454	and she just sort of say oh well that's be and you think well no that's a violent criminal
S0579	yeah mm
S0454	who's obviously get something i mean at best he's a bite unhinge or at worst he's completely sane
S0579	well if if near your throat you might just turn your head and and
S0454	i think he would've do it as well actually he say if you say another word i'll slit your throat and he hold a huge knife against my throat
S0579	yeah i mean that's a that's a thin to do that's almost a thing you should report to the police really
S0454	i wish i have
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh
S0454	although to be honest if i have i mean social service might be ask what's he do with children
S0579	yeah probably yeah
S0454	i mean i could've do him a lot of harm and he's i'm sure he's an excellent father
S0579	oh yes
S0454	who would never hurt his children so i
S0579	no
S0454	could've do him a lot of damage
S0579	no cos when we've be over there you see those daughters they they love they love him yeah yeah
S0454	yes yes
S0579	and all the children cos he er
S0454	yes he like children
S0579	yeah he do like children yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	and they seem to like him don't they
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah they do
S0579	perhaps he's change a lot now
S0454	i think he'll always be good with children won't he
S0579	yeah i think so yeah
S0454	yes yes
S0579	i think he's try to be friends with you hasn't he
S0454	yes but it's not good enough if he's not go to say sorry and even if he do to be honest i would always be afraid of him
S0579	oh
S0454	every time he's gonna have a drink in his hand i'm go to be think in the back of my mind be he go to get violent again
S0579	yes cos he he do he drink too
S0454	and the trouble be he's a big boy
S0579	do he drink too much now
S0454	he drink too much i mean i don't know about now but he seem to be get drink a lot
S0579	oh do he
S0454	and become violent
S0579	cos someone say he go off with oh i think er i think er say he go off with the boys like now
S0454	yes yes
S0579	and they have they have a little get together in the pubs
S0454	yes i mean it's okay if you're just gonna have a pint or two isn't it
S0579	yeah depend how far they go with it yeah
S0454	but that's the trouble and then you know if you say anything to him he get aggressive so you can't say anything
S0579	well no 's stop him er
S0454	yes well that's good
S0579	the can cos we have the can in the cupboard there
S0454	yes
S0579	for general use and they he find and him pick them out and drink them
S0454	yes well i expect they be quite young be they
S0579	oh yeah quite young i suppose so yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	cos they're still good friends those two and
S0454	yes they be yes yes that's right
S0579	they're still in touch with each other
S0454	yes yes
S0579	and though though oddly enough say erm i've try to put him on the right path well i think that be er
S0454	that's a bite ironic isn't it
S0579	yes i think that's er
S0454	pot yes
S0579	that's something different he be try to put on the right path
S0454	yes yes
S0579	yeah i i've forget what be do anyway be try to give him advice and er
S0454	don't expect like that
S0579	mm no probably not
S0454	well it's different if they're a child but 's probably not that young any more be he
S0579	well i suppose
S0454	late twenties i suppose
S0579	yeah i suppose yes er 's er will be much younger much older in in his mind really i suppose yes yes
S0454	there probably be a good few yes but i suppose wouldn't like that
S0579	yeah yes i suppose 's easily lead i suppose
S0454	yes yes yes that's true yes
S0579	i think that's right mm
S0454	and i suppose cos he grow up with two girls he be probably desperate for a peer wasn't he and be his peer
S0579	yeah yeah probably yeah i think so yeah yeah yeah
S0454	yes that's right
S0579	yeah probably yes
S0454	yes i mean he get on with his sisters didn't he but i suppose it's always different for a boy
S0579	oh yes yes i think
S0454	you're not gonna have that same close relationship that two girls might
S0579	no no no no
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes i suppose and be quite different in character as well 's quite intellectual isn't he
S0579	oh be yes yes yeah
S0454	yes and i get the feel 's not that way
S0579	no no no
S0454	yeah so they're probably
S0579	no you you'll find now er it's the er i think be more gentle approach towards than would be like
S0454	yes yeah yes
S0579	course oh yes it's er okay
S0454	yes yeah i suppose and be more similar
S0579	i think they're like yourself a bite more academic like
S0454	yes that's right yes and she's quite ambitious isn't she as well she want to get on in life and
S0579	oh yes i remember say something like all the rest of the children except be academic
S0454	she's do very well hasn't she yeah well it's true isn't it yeah
S0579	and then
S0454	well 's not that academic i don't think
S0579	beg your pardon
S0454	's not so academic
S0579	no i no
S0454	's always be good with his hand hasn't he he's you know electrical work he's and he's very good at it you can he's get the mind for it which
S0579	yeah yes he yes oh yes yes yeah
S0454	the rest of us be useless
S0579	yeah no no
S0454	we haven't get a clue i think between us
S0579	no
S0454	we could barely change a light bulb
S0579	no no er usually fix things here actually
S0454	's yeah 's very smart
S0579	mm yeah
S0454	but in more of the mechanical
S0579	well well yes
S0454	sort of engineer type mind
S0579	yeah no he's not an academic
S0454	no he's not academic and
S0579	cos he always say all the rest of the family people be academic except me he say yeah yeah
S0454	yes yes that's probably true
S0579	yeah
S0454	well i don't no don't think that's quite true and aren't academic
S0579	no
S0454	yes no i don't think mum's particularly academic my mum
S0579	wasn't she oh
S0454	i mean she's quite bright
S0579	yes
S0454	but she's not into that kind of study and book and
S0579	no probably not no no
S0454	she like read but not academically
S0579	do she like do she like music i suppose yeah
S0454	she doesn't like politics at all she doesn't
S0579	no
S0454	follow the news
S0579	do she not no
S0454	no
S0579	oh
S0454	but she she's get a lot of interest that sort of way incline i suppose yeah but yes 's very academic more than me she do her master's didn't she
S0579	oh of course she do her master's
S0454	and more than me he's do his master's
S0579	yeah yeah of course do yeah
S0454	and i like learn but i'm not really into academia i don't like write essay
S0579	no no
S0454	i don't enjoy that
S0579	no it's sound 's the odd one out
S0454	yes i think he be always a bite insecure about that and that's probably what cause a lot of the problems and dad's very academic isn't he
S0579	oh very much so yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	dad be yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	well i remember yes what be do once do he do he bash up a car somewhere
S0454	yeah he use to steal cars and go joyride and burn them out
S0579	yeah i have a feel yeah that's what i think
S0454	police catch him once
S0579	yeah that's what i remember
S0454	yes
S0579	knock at the door about two o'clock in the morning
S0454	that's right no they come the next day actually the police

S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	and they say no he's down at the station that go on for a couple of minutes and they say alright well why don't you show us madam and of course he wasn't there cos he be in the the police station
S0454	that be the only way she would believe them
S0579	believe them yeah yeah mm
S0454	so and they say would you like to come with us
S0579	yeah
S0454	and she go down and there he be he be quite young then he be probably only about fourteen
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yes bite wild
S0579	oddly enough your grandma be always very kind to
S0454	yes that's right
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yes yes that's right
S0579	cos i suppose he stay with us and he behave himself when he be with us
S0454	yes well yes i'm sure he do yes
S0579	no he didn't do anything outward
S0454	no
S0579	he er be always erm
S0454	no that's right
S0579	i suppose actually er grandma be able to control i think that be probably
S0454	yes
S0579	part of the answer
S0454	yes
S0579	when he be with us anyhow
S0454	yes that's good
S0579	and he really do behave himself when he be with us
S0454	oh yes i'm sure he would
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes i'm sure he like be here
S0579	yeah
S0454	so he wouldn't want to have jeopardise that
S0579	probably no no no
S0454	no
S0579	it's it's you you have you have have problems with him then
S0454	yes i don't know perhaps he be jealous or something but i mean that's no excuse
S0579	no no no no
S0454	especially when you're not a child i mean
S0579	when do you last see then
S0454	at grandma's funeral
S0579	oh you saw him there that's right
S0454	yes yeah
S0579	cos i remember sit right behind me i think somewhere at that funeral
S0454	oh right yeah
S0579	be you sit next to him be you
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah yeah yeah of course i'd forget he'd be yes of course he be there yes
S0454	mm
S0579	and of course er and mum always support him a hundred percent do
S0454	i know yeah
S0579	spoil him really
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	but that's a grandma's prerogative too isn't it
S0579	i suppose i suppose
S0454	yes that's
S0454	that's completely understandable
S0579	she be she be no she be aware a lot of people object to him like
S0454	yes
S0579	and so she support him for that i suppose
S0454	yes
S0579	even it up a bite
S0454	yes that's right
S0579	yeah yes okay
S0454	no that's natural
S0579	well yes and and i suppose she yeah and i suppose she find quite happy cos he didn't behave like that er necessarily elsewhere
S0454	no he wasn't very nice grow up
S0579	no no grow up no i can see yeah
S0454	no i expect be difficult too for and
S0579	well he be they have problems with always
S0454	they they yes
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	i think he's still difficult with them
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i mean you wouldn't know normally with cos we don't see that side do we he seem very he's always be very polite to me and
S0579	no i oh he's very polite to most people
S0454	yeah but then that's the problem
S0579	on the phone he's very nice hello grandad it's
S0454	exactly but then you don't know what's go on at home
S0579	no no but er i think he i mean
S0454	you only have to say and you can see tense up can't you
S0579	yeah he he he know 's er always be a bite anti
S0454	yeah
S0579	and of course he be always spoil by that be the other part
S0454	yes well i think that's what happen with too to be honest he be spoil by mum
S0579	be he yes yeah yeah
S0454	er dad didn't spoil him
S0579	no no
S0454	not at all but i suppose dad be often angry with as i suppose be be with
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then yes he sort of manipulate the situation
S0579	yes when i saw not i should say chat with his dad he seem to be get on well with him
S0454	much better now yes
S0579	yeah i mean that's in you know quite recent time i think
S0454	yes that's right that's quite recent isn't it just a few years
S0579	yeah that's right i be surprise to see them get on so well together
S0454	yes that's good
S0579	yes yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	so obviously 's change quite a bite
S0454	yes i think he's make an effort
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes that's good
S0579	so he still gotta make an effort towards your way
S0454	yes but to be honest i mean you can't
S0579	no not easy no no
S0454	you can't turn back the clock
S0579	no no and people remember
S0454	yes you do remember yes
S0579	but i suppose oh i i think acknowledge how bad he be towards you though i think he's tell me or tell us once when we be visit
S0454	mm yes probably didn't tell you he threaten the knife thing though do he
S0579	didn't tell me about gonna slice you up at all
S0454	he yes well that's it he's not tell you the worst things he might've tell you he be annoy
S0579	yeah
S0454	which he be but there's one thing be annoy
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's another actually threaten people
S0579	well of course the trouble with that thing of course people could've do something dangerous in any case hold knives
S0454	yes and er in that sense i'm sorry i didn't call the police because actually they probably need to know
S0579	no no that's right
S0454	and if he's do it once to a woman
S0579	yeah if he do
S0454	what's to stop him do it to another woman
S0579	yeah
S0454	or or a man for that matter i mean it's not any more acceptable but

S0454	i don't think so i don't think you get over that
S0579	it's very difficult to get back over time i know
S0454	you don't you won't trust someone like that again unfortunately once they've do it once that's it
S0579	yeah
S0454	he's do it twice
S0579	yeah
S0454	so then there's no chance of
S0579	no
S0454	i mean you you don't forget that what do you do the third time
S0579	you don't no no no no dangerous yes
S0454	and the trouble be it'll it's more likely to get worse than better
S0579	it yes except he's get someone tough live with him at the moment hasn't he with
S0454	mm well i'm not say he'd do it to her
S0579	no well i mean
S0454	i mean why would he that's the mother of his children that would be very unlikely
S0579	well i think yeah but er he she's tough with him in general term she be
S0454	oh yes yeah she be i think she's quite a tough woman
S0579	yeah she be she doesn't she she just doesn't
S0454	yes and she's do no she's not have an easy life bring up those two children alone
S0579	no
S0454	that's not easy
S0579	no she's she's very much in demand er you know in command i should say with
S0454	yes yes no i think she's quite a tough woman
S0579	she's good for him
S0454	and she's obviously a good mother
S0579	yeah
S0454	she
S0579	yeah
S0454	care about her children a lot
S0579	yes yes she do and er and they get very nice little girl

S0579	something special on so she come i wonder what she be do knock at the door and she be all dress up in her school clothe
S0454	yes
S0579	have to get to oh i think it be a big bus ride or something
S0454	oh right oh that's nice
S0579	take about an hour get there something like that yeah
S0454	yes yes very sweet little girl
S0579	oh well well no doubt time will gradually heal
S0454	maybe i don't think so
S0454	but erm
S0454	yes
S0579	i know one's get memories which which take a bite of eradicate i suppose yeah
S0454	yes well i don't think you really forget that sort of thing
S0579	no no do behave badly i suppose yeah
S0454	he do yes he behave very badly
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	and how what be the difference in age between you two then
S0454	it's probably five years i think
S0579	oh quite a big gap
S0454	about five yes he's probably thirty one now isn't he yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	it's a wonder you be not in command with five years over older than him
S0454	yeah well i suppose he's a big boy isn't he he's so if he want to be physically violent then he'll have the upper hand
S0579	well he's a big heavy lad yes do he try physical violence
S0454	yes
S0579	oh have he oh oh well
S0454	so he's always gonna have the upper hand there
S0579	oh yes can't
S0454	can't really fight back what be i gonna do pick up a knife and stab him in the heart
S0579	or er or your umbrella or something yes
S0454	yes but that's the trouble isn't it so you've get nowhere to go with that
S0579	yeah no no no no
S0454	apart from call the police
S0579	yeah
S0454	and you know if he do it again i would call the police
S0579	yeah i suppose
S0454	and mum will have to be upset but i mean unfortunately it would be at something like a wed it would be awful if the police come but that's the sort of thing you're look at
S0579	oh yes i suppose yeah
S0454	i mean imagine that in the middle of 's wed and the police have to come and arrest him
S0579	oh so
S0454	be awful it would ruin 's day wouldn't it
S0579	so you won't be go to 's wed then
S0454	i will go but i might not stay the night
S0579	oh you're gonna be
S0454	i think i'll just go for the wed itself
S0579	then move away yes
S0454	yes and i'll ask i think i'll speak to quietly when i see her
S0579	but they needn't you anywhere near need they
S0454	i think i'll ask her actually and tell her why
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm you know cos she be quite an understand person and ask you know to for the seat plan to be look at
S0579	yes well
S0454	cos i mean there's hundreds of people there it shouldn't
S0579	yes
S0454	be that difficult to be sit away from him
S0579	no there'd be about people there
S0454	yes i mean i i'm sure they can fix it so i don't have to yes
S0579	just come and then go like
S0454	yes yes i think that's probably best
S0579	perhaps we'll all do the same i come and go
S0454	i'm sure you're fine grandpa
S0579	no no yeah i'll take good care of you
S0454	yes
S0579	no no no
S0454	i mean this unfortunately i have erm you know my ex boyfriend
S0579	oh i remember yes
S0454	his father be very violent towards his mother and use to beat her up
S0579	oh be he oh
S0454	all the time really badly not bad enough to put her in hospital
S0579	no no
S0454	but the thing be you would never know
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm that's the whole point isn't it
S0454	i mean if they be like that to everyone they'd be in prison
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	but i mean he be a lovely apparently gentle man he didn't drink and he be very friendly with woman you know you'd feel completely safe
S0579	yeah
S0454	and when he tell me i honestly couldn't believe it oh that's that's impossible i say what do it happen once he say no it happen regularly
S0579	oh that's
S0454	all through my childhood and when my sister grow up it happen to her too father use to beat his sister
S0579	oh no
S0454	actually beat her up
S0579	oh golly
S0454	but you wouldn't know
S0579	no
S0454	and of course the you know their child i mean she's a grow woman now
S0579	yeah
S0454	she's traumatise the poor woman
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean she's never be able to work
S0579	no
S0454	she's sign off work permanently i mean she's not brain damage or anything she's she's all there
S0579	no no no
S0454	but you know she's
S0579	yeah
S0454	a break woman
S0579	do you get rid of or do you both just
S0454	we just go apart
S0579	equally
S0454	yes
S0579	oh yes yeah
S0454	yes but i mean that's the point isn't it they're not like it to everybody
S0579	no no
S0454	if they be like it to everybody they'd obviously be in prison i mean er
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	you couldn't get away with it could you
S0579	not really no no no no
S0454	and they must be nice superficially cos otherwise everyone would know about it
S0579	yeah
S0454	so
S0579	do he have nice parent then
S0454	yes well apart from the dad with the sort of
S0454	jekyll and hyde personality but
S0454	i mean superficially he be he be very nice
S0454	i mean to me he be lovely
S0579	yeah oh
S0454	very friendly very polite
S0579	well that you see that quite often actually someone who's difficult with their own wife who's pleasant to somebody else
S0454	yes well exactly
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah and his you know it wasn't like his mother be a horrible woman she be a lovely gentle but then i suppose that's the point isn't it
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	she probably didn't fight back
S0579	yes
S0454	she be never go to go to the police
S0579	no
S0454	cos she love her husband and she be never go to leave him but then that's what allow it to continue and sadly
S0579	yeah
S0454	he take it out on his daughter in the end
S0579	no no
S0454	which be awful and not when she be a child but when she reach adulthood
S0579	oh oh
S0454	yes and you know really you'd expect the daughter to say well i'm have nothing to do with you dad but you know doesn't
S0579	doesn't no no no no
S0454	no she's on antidepressants now the poor girl
S0579	yeah cos you be with for some time wasn't it
S0454	yeah a few years yeah
S0579	two years be it
S0454	yeah yes quite a while
S0579	oh oh yes oh well
S0454	yes yes
S0579	well good job you stop in time then
S0454	yes well i think we both have different plan in the uk we both want to come back to the uk he's
S0579	yeah
S0454	back in the uk but he's in london and i don't really want to be in i want to be down here
S0579	you're
S0454	yes
S0579	yes that's nice to be here
S0454	yeah so i suppose we have different plan there
S0579	yeah okay
S0454	that's okay yes
S0579	you you don't do you have communication at all now
S0454	no
S0579	no no
S0454	i think sometimes it's best just to let things
S0579	to call it a day yes probably yeah
S0454	yeah sometimes you can
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm but this time i didn't really feel like that
S0579	no no no
S0454	it be better to have a clean break
S0579	well it's it's much better that way start again yeah
S0454	yeah i think it's sometimes it's healthier to have a
S0579	yes
S0454	a proper break yes
S0579	well it enable you to get on with life again doesn't it
S0454	well exactly and he be a nice enough person
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know he be gentle and yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	he be kind very generous person
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	so what bring it to a halt then just
S0454	well he want to live in
S0579	oh i see yes mm
S0454	near his parent and i want to live down here
S0579	well yeah
S0454	so someone have to compromise really
S0579	well yeah
S0454	and if no one's go to compromise that's not go to work be it
S0579	well it should be well well he no he should compromise as a man shouldn't he
S0579	you always give way to your wive normally on most things yes
S0454	yes i suppose his work be in though so
S0579	oh well i suppose yeah
S0454	that's that it's difficult for them then
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's not i mean it be you know something like teach you could work anywhere
S0579	he he be he a qualify lawyer
S0454	yes
S0579	oh yes yeah
S0454	and he work in corporate law so you'd have to be where the headquarter be really which be
S0579	oh bore stuff bore
S0454	very bore
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah well he hat his job but the money be very good so that's why he do it
S0579	well in it would be anyhow i suppose yeah
S0454	yes and in the middle east
S0579	yeah
S0454	incredibly bore it's all contract isn't it
S0579	well we i mean my family have act for a number of solicitors
S0454	yes
S0579	but some of them really i mean they be they be hopeless as solicitors
S0454	really
S0579	some some of em be very good
S0454	yes
S0579	but one or two be just hopeless
S0454	dear
S0579	i i think one firm in there be a chap very good chap call and he be er a recorder as well
S0454	mm
S0579	so he be way up on the scale of it but some of his other partner disasters
S0454	dear
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's amaze they get away with it isn't it
S0579	well i actually one case i mean he only get the job as er as a partner there by he be very friendly with someone who know this young lad very well and she'd and ask if he could give him a job
S0454	mm right
S0579	but he be hopeless
S0454	yes
S0579	don't know what's happen to him now but he be just hopeless er er as a solicitor oh he have to retire i think
S0454	yes
S0579	cos everyone get feed up with him yeah
S0454	dear well i suppose that's good he take retirement but i mean he make a whole life out of it though didn't he
S0579	i think he i think i think he go into market garden after that
S0454	oh right oh right something different
S0579	something like that yeah i think so
S0454	yes
S0579	but he he couldn't you know the law wasn't for him i suppose that be the key
S0454	yes
S0579	he'd pass the exams but he
S0454	oh well he must've be quite bright then cos they're not easy exams be they
S0579	yeah he pass the exams but er he still wasn't good enough deal with people like
S0454	oh yes
S0454	well that's a funny thing isn't it
S0579	yeah
S0454	for a lot of professions you need to be good at deal with people
S0579	you've gotta be
S0454	but all our exams be about intellect and nothing to do with people
S0579	yes that's right mm
S0454	cos we've never come up with a good system for measure
S0579	no
S0454	your capability with people and a and a lot of job you need to be able to communicate don't you
S0579	no you you've gotta be er you you've gotta be you've gotta be if you're in charge of a firm of any description you've gotta be able to get on well with people otherwise you're in trouble
S0454	yes that's right yes it's interest and be hopeless at that and he's quit job after job
S0579	be he oh
S0454	because he can't get on with his boss
S0579	well that's ridiculous yeah yes
S0454	and he's quit i think three job in row he's incredibly good lawyer
S0579	yeah
S0454	very intellectual very smart but he can't stand people who be stupider than him and unfortunately he's that bright that's most people
S0579	oh
S0454	so that's no good he's gonna always be quit job isn't he
S0579	you can't argue with the boss too long otherwise he get rid of you
S0454	well that's it you can't can you
S0579	yeah no no
S0454	even if you think they're stupid
S0579	no you're
S0454	they're still more powerful than you and they hire you
S0579	than you be yeah yeah
S0454	so they may and they can't be that stupid they're lawyers so they're obviously reasonably bright
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	but i mean he be just i i suppose it be very difficult if you're that intelligent cos you would feel like you're deal with imbeciles a lot of the time
S0579	well just like anyone else in the firm i suppose some of em be very good and some of em be hopeless
S0454	yes
S0579	i use to deal with the firm with erm who i'd say be one who be a very good chap the other one be good deal with properties and two others be hopeless
S0454	mm
S0579	they only get the job because er they be ask to do it by a friend of er one of the solicitors and they take him on he be hopeless
S0454	yes
S0579	and er when a new firm take them over the first thing to do be to sack him
S0454	oh right
S0579	yeah
S0454	oh well good for them
S0579	it be amalgamation when the older partner die
S0454	yes
S0579	and so they have to be take over by someone else which they do
S0454	yes
S0579	and they say they wouldn't take it over with him
S0454	oh right well they know then yes
S0579	yes he never go back to the solicitor he go market garden or something yeah
S0454	no he's probably a lot happier i mean you can't be
S0579	no no
S0454	you wouldn't be very happy in your job if you be know you be rubbish would you
S0579	well that's right no
S0454	so he be probably miserable to be honest
S0454	and then i suppose the more miserable he get
S0579	yeah
S0454	the less effort he put in
S0579	oh i know yes i remember that actually now there be another firm take them over
S0454	mm
S0579	and i be ask to go to the meet with them and er i try to put in a good word for him you know with the
S0454	yes
S0579	er with this fellow but they wouldn't take him on
S0454	no
S0579	they say no there's nobody we've if we've gotta take him we won't we'll we'll withdraw
S0454	yes well they know he would be a liability wouldn't he i suppose
S0579	so the other the well that's right the other lawyers they want to stay so they would
S0454	yes well i can understand that cos
S0579	then he retire and i think he go market garden after that something completely different
S0454	yes well if someone's go to damage your business then you
S0579	well yeah that's right yes
S0454	can understand why they wouldn't want to take him on
S0579	no no
S0454	cos he might do a lot of harm lose them a lot of business
S0579	well that's right well you er you've only gotta make one big mistake somewhere and then
S0454	that's right
S0579	then the whole firm suffer yes
S0454	yeah so i i think they probably do the right thing
S0579	yeah
S0454	and to be honest he need to do something else didn't he with his life
S0579	yes well my old my my partner still go under my name actually the firm do still
S0454	mm
S0579	and what have they get they've get twenty five staff now i think so
S0454	yeah
S0579	increase beyond when i leave like say
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh of course chap who take over be er very good cos he become president of the all this er accountancy in southern england like
S0454	mm
S0579	he be make president
S0454	oh right oh that's good
S0579	so yeah that that's get him a good name i suppose yeah
S0454	yes yes
S0579	i they when they meet him i meet him with your mum actually one not very long back we meet yeah we meet up with them that's right and i call in at the office and he be down at

S0454	oh right yes
S0579	he have the house the other side of the road and the children

S0454	can understand want to be close by but not that close
S0579	and you no no
S0454	i mean you'd see her come and go wouldn't you and that'd be a bite strange
S0579	yeah that's right yeah yeah that's i don't think they have much contact between them but but the the daughters always have the contact
S0454	yes
S0579	because he be the one with the earn the money i suppose so they do rather well i suppose

S0579	well we use to know exactly it can't be below this price and it's gotta be some little bite above it
S0454	yes yes
S0579	and usually at the end we get something which be reasonable in those days

S0454	no
S0579	they work hard and all the rest of it could we keep it go

S0454	oh
S0579	he be in the local firm of solicitors in they they have a big branch in
S0454	mm
S0579	er yeah that's right and meet up with him and they chat about me something like that
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	yeah yeah yeah keep it go then we sell we do sell it off quite well to some some big company somewhere yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	you like mushroom
S0454	i love mushroom yes
S0579	oh well should've bring i use to bring mum er i always use to
S0454	yeah i bet you use to get load off them punnets
S0579	well i use to bring i use to bring baskets full er for mum didn't know what to do with them
S0454	no
S0579	there be so many
S0454	yes that's true you can only make soup i suppose can't you
S0579	but i always they they always give me a couple of put them in the back of the the my car always
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	erm and they use to come over and then he use to send the one of the wholesaler who put the mushroom in in the bag or baskets
S0454	mm yeah
S0579	put them in the back of the car at the back ready to drive home with all these mushroom
S0454	wow
S0579	mum didn't know what to do with them no no
S0454	no
S0579	no no
S0454	no
S0579	you like your mushroom
S0454	yeah i do yeah what i've never understand in this country though be we only ever have one sort of mushroom when you travel to other countries it's like apples there's like six or seven different varieties in the supermarket
S0579	oh yeah have different varieties of er er
S0454	i've never understand that here we only have the close ones the close button ones and then the open ones
S0579	yeah
S0454	but that's actually the same they're just a bite older
S0579	yeah
S0454	we don't have different sort
S0579	no she send me the button ones or the other
S0454	yeah
S0579	cos some of those other ones get to enormous size
S0454	yes that's right
S0579	then they're not want apparently
S0454	no they've go a bite woody yeah
S0579	yeah that's what they say
S0454	yes so the the close ones be more popular
S0454	but what i don't understand be why we only have one species in this country cos if you go to japan you go down to the supermarket there'll be like five or six in every supermarket and completely different sort there'll be these little spindly ones there'll be ones that look like brain which you can slice and fry like bacon delicious
S0454	i mean you you can find them probably in specialist store here
S0579	yeah
S0454	but generally speak we only have one sort maybe nowadays you might find oyster mushroom at a push
S0579	mm
S0454	that's quite unusual
S0579	yeah we use to have er we use to sell oyster mushroom
S0454	oh right yes those be you see those more and more now
S0579	yeah i remember we use to grow those
S0454	yeah
S0579	that must've be thirty years ago now yeah
S0454	yeah oh yeah it's funny though cos the uk actually if you go into the woods you know there's millions of mushroom aren't there
S0579	they grow
S0454	it's not a country where mushroom be
S0579	yeah no yeah
S0454	you know an unknown quantity
S0579	yeah
S0454	but maybe the british have always be a bite suspicious of mushroom and other countries have just have them in their diet much more
S0579	well yes i suppose yes it use to be what do we use to have now there use to be some one or two varieties be very specialise i know use to
S0454	oh right yes
S0579	forget which ones they use to call them now we have the great big mushroom big flat ones and people want the small ones yeah
S0454	yes yes the flavour's better usually
S0579	oh the small ones yeah
S0454	yes yes they're sort of nice texture
S0579	and i use to bring your every time i go up there i come back with two big these box of mushroom mum didn't know what to do with them
S0454	no
S0579	no no
S0454	i like mushroom soup that's nice
S0579	oh well 's into soup yeah
S0454	yeah oh yes 's good at soup isn't she
S0579	into soup mushroom soup
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah yes it well actually for a long time and then of course when er when they all die and problem cos we suddenly find that the be no longer there
S0454	mm
S0579	and of course after a bite of on my part with with this colleague of mine solicitor guy we find they'd they'd be pinch the money in some form
S0454	oh oh really oh dear
S0579	yeah so er so the company be go down
S0454	oh dear
S0579	so then we put it into liquidation and close it
S0454	oh right yeah
S0579	yes yeah well it it be we sell it on i i suppose we do that's right we sell it on
S0454	mm
S0454	it's bad isn't it though
S0579	yeah
S0454	that someone you you know who work for you could do that and undermine the whole firm
S0579	yeah yeah that's right the man in charge we just we sack him but er in fact
S0454	it's quite common though isn't it i i mean i've see that place i've work where it's the manager
S0579	yeah
S0454	undermine the business and you know they have to close it and they never ever get to prosecute cos it's difficult to prove isn't it
S0579	yeah no well
S0454	how do you prove it how can you prove it wasn't someone else in the till
S0579	yeah well i in this case we have to put it into liquidation cos i could see that be the i saw the bank about it at the time and explain the position to them so they say they'd hold be but wouldn't spend any more money on the
S0454	no
S0454	that's dreadful though
S0579	yeah but so but what happen be what do happen er
S0454	and everyone lose their job probably which be sad isn't it that's what's
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know terrible about that
S0579	oh oh we keep it go but then we sell it off to a another firm
S0454	mm
S0579	but they want er less people on on the farm so they have to get rid of quite a lot of people
S0454	yeah oh it's dreadful i bet it be the manager cos they're the people with access aren't they
S0579	well yes it be the manager
S0454	either that or the people who do the book
S0579	yeah oh oh well there be two on there be that's right no eventually
S0454	you've gotta watch the bookkeepers
S0579	oh yeah so one be the er sort of a secretary
S0454	oh yes i be gonna say
S0579	who get the book
S0454	exactly often be
S0579	and er er and and the other one who be the manager yeah
S0454	and the manager yeah cos i work for that pub
S0579	oh yes
S0454	and we use to take a thousand pound each on the till just on the bar
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	in a night and there about ten bar staff so that's ten thousand pound a night
S0579	oh golly yes
S0454	that's not to mention the restaurant restaurant food didn't go through our till it go through somewhere else and they're charge well you know fifteen pound a plate and it be full and it never make any money
S0579	oh there's something go wrong
S0454	that's not possible be it
S0579	not possible no
S0454	so they sack lot and lot of people cos they the manager claim it be the staff steal money and you know in the end head office find it be him
S0579	be him oh
S0454	but they couldn't prove it but by then they'd probably sack twenty people
S0579	yeah
S0454	for you know various infringement i'm not say they didn't steal anything but i mean they be steal a glass of wine
S0579	oh
S0454	they weren't put their hand in the till
S0579	no
S0454	i mean it's still wrong but a glass of wine be not ten thousand pound
S0454	a night and we're talk ten thousand pound a night and yeah they say to him either you go and we won't push press for charge or you stay and we'll prosecute but they know it'd be very difficult to prove it because he know where all the secret cameras be
S0579	oh
S0454	so they probably didn't have any video evidence of it
S0579	no
S0454	but i remember once go upstairs with him at the end of the shift and if the till be down he use to take it out our wag and he go oh that's for me and put twenty pound in his pocket and i think well that's a dishonest man isn't it
S0454	because when the till be down he's take it out our wag even though he doesn't know who it be but when the till be up
S0579	yeah
S0454	he's say well that's for me
S0579	yeah
S0454	and i think well he's up to no good
S0579	he well no i remember i think i i i be go down i i take a whole batch of erm the firm's book and paper home with me and i think oh i'll look at all these when i be at home
S0454	mm
S0579	and i suddenly find out they'd be fiddle yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	the secretaries
S0454	it's often the bookkeepers
S0579	and so i know when originally and we'd have them i take the manager there and i say what about this why have you do that
S0454	mm
S0579	and immediately he he
S0454	get defensive probably
S0579	yeah no yeah but he suddenly admit the whole lot
S0454	oh really isn't that interest
S0579	yeah he say well the secretary know all about it he say we be both wrong
S0454	wow
S0579	yeah
S0454	cor
S0579	cos i think well this be probably go to be a legal matter and with it be prosecutions and that sort of stuff
S0454	yeah
S0579	but when they put the liquidator they didn't want any of that
S0454	no well that's it you see they know don't they
S0579	yeah they just want to send it off the best they could
S0454	yes
S0579	to help the creditors like
S0454	that's right
S0454	they get away with it these people
S0579	yeah but
S0454	it's annoy
S0579	well they get most of the money those people who be do that
S0454	yeah
S0579	and but the creditors only get about twenty three p in the pound or something i seem to remember
S0454	yeah mm yes it's sad isn't it when that happen
S0579	it's sad when that happen yeah
S0454	do you remember in erm there be that woman there she get do in the doctor's that be the secretary
S0579	be it
S0454	so mum use to friends with the doctor at the local practice and they they be always busy there and they be always lose money lot of money i mean tens and tens of thousand
S0579	yeah
S0454	and this be a a government
S0579	doctor's yes
S0454	you know doctor this be fund by the state but they the book never add up and they couldn't understand it and in the end they find it be this sweet little secretary use to come for piano lessons with mum her daughters use to and i use to teach their daughters flute at one point and that's what i remember i be ask to go to their house to be a nanny for the summer holiday and so i go over there and it be very luxurious i mean the sort of you know like ok magazine where everything be just so
S0579	yeah luxurious yeah
S0454	and it be incredibly rich and her husband sell use cars and i suppose everyone in their back of the mind think well use cars that's always be a traditional way to fiddle the the book
S0579	yes
S0454	everybody know they swindle people
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	so everyone i suppose think that's where they'd make their money but we're talk millions
S0579	oh golly
S0454	and it wasn't it be her
S0579	yes
S0454	and he must've know i mean the husband must've know
S0579	do someone go to jail for that
S0454	she go to jail for that and she have two children
S0579	oh that's tough
S0454	and they put her in jail anyway but they never get all the money
S0579	yeah
S0454	once she be in prison they find out actually they'd underestimate how much she'd take they find even more account things
S0579	really yeah
S0454	but they say oh we won't bother press charge
S0579	oh
S0454	cos she be already in prison
S0579	i know when er er we find all these things happen i be want to go for prosecution of these people
S0454	mm
S0579	but the liquidators say they didn't want it
S0454	no i i that's what happen at this pub i work in
S0579	no no
S0454	they didn't want to to push it and i suppose it damage your business as well doesn't it once that sort of thing's in the press
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's very embarrass for the company and might
S0579	yeah
S0454	do untold damage so they just hush it up
S0579	well i suppose well they as liquidators i suppose yeah they they
S0454	they're not interest
S0579	no they must be no
S0454	no it's not about justice for
S0579	no no no
S0454	what's happen it's about justice for the creditors isn't it
S0579	that that sort of come back to
S0454	that's all they care about yes yes
S0579	i know and they ask me nothing to do with me but i remember the solicitors ask me if i would speak to the creditors before just before i leave
S0454	yes
S0579	just just say a few word say you be upset what have happen sort of thing
S0454	yes
S0579	but i don't think they be very impress when i say that either
S0454	no
S0579	yeah but er it be nothing to do with us but perhaps they think it be something to do with us i don't know
S0454	yes
S0579	but i know they use to cook the book of course but it be they do er have this chap er oddly enough this fellow they have as secretary i he he some years some years before he'd mention to me how the firm as be before have diddle things
S0454	oh right
S0579	and i never give it a think until this happen i think
S0454	yeah
S0579	he know what he be do this guy do cos he'd mention this it have happen before like some of it
S0454	oh dear
S0579	but it but they didn't want to send him to jail so they they think they'd hang on till it be all sell up and deal with properly
S0454	yes probably get away with it didn't he
S0579	he get away with it yeah big firm take over and i expect oh yes and that chap become manager they may've get rid of the secretary but the
S0454	dear that's awful
S0579	the the manager remain
S0454	that's awful isn't it
S0579	he er he er he
S0454	how ridiculous let him stay
S0579	yeah
S0454	should've sack him
S0579	yeah yeah yeah they should've sack him really
S0454	and then say if you wanna make a fuss that's fine we'll take you to the police station you can tell them
S0579	but he so he on the other he be the manager on the side of production you see
S0454	oh i see okay not with the book
S0579	no no he be the the production side so they have to keep him on to keep it go like
S0454	mm yes well
S0579	yeah though there be a deputy i think we we appoint he be quite a good man actually fairly honest be
S0454	yes it's probably
S0579	but they just let him soldier on anyway it be out of our hand at that time liquidators come in and and that be it
S0454	mm yes oh that's a shame
S0579	i know i go to the bank and tell them and they oh what what we be go to do and they be quite happy
S0454	yeah oh well that's good
S0579	cos they get their all their money back
S0454	that's all they care about
S0454	they couldn't care less about the law i'm sure
S0579	no no no they get their money back yeah that's right
S0454	yes oh i think they the the bank have be a little bite too lenient haven't they
S0579	yeah they yeah that's right that's yeah they usually cover their own step bank do yeah
S0454	yes that's right well they've also turn a blind eye in this country to a lot of money launder
S0579	must've do yeah
S0454	cos it be money come through the bank wasn't it they don't care where it's care from
S0579	no no that's right
S0454	i think they care now cos they've do all sort of damage to themself like hsbc's in do
S0579	oh hsbc yeah yeah to them yeah
S0454	irreparable damage to their reputation now but they're hardly go to go bust be they so the
S0579	oh yeah well i suppose now it's all forget about isn't it whereas yeah definitely
S0454	well it will be won't it yeah i mean they'll have to pay a fine but the fine they will pay will be nothing like the profit they've make over the past thirty years
S0579	that's it mm not really no no no no no no that yeah
S0454	from illegal money launder
S0579	yeah no there's a lot of that go on
S0454	yes
S0579	it's it's stop now though hasn't it
S0454	well it's stop in this country but they've just catch up in switzerland haven't they with hsbc
S0579	have they
S0454	that be only about six months ago
S0579	oh
S0454	it turn out the treasury here know about it for years and didn't prosecute
S0579	oh
S0454	and then it get pick up by other eu governments and they be press charge
S0579	oh
S0454	and the americans have be very good haven't they about insider trade and things
S0579	oh some of them
S0454	that they prosecute some big bank
S0579	i think i remember see the press recently yeah that's right
S0454	but i suppose the trouble be you need a big country like the usa to take on something like hsbc
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos they've
S0579	yeah
S0454	get their team of lawyers
S0579	yeah yes yes
S0454	and you've get your team of lawyers and it's just that's gonna drag on for years and cost billions in taxpayers' money and you never really get that money back i suppose do you
S0579	they only winners be the lawyers in those things
S0454	well it's true isn't it
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	even if the government win
S0579	yeah
S0454	the fine will be nothing like what they've spend on legal fee
S0579	no no
S0454	so it's more to set the precedent and i suppose most governments
S0579	cos we do that on this company i be talk about there be a question should we prosecute it be
S0454	and i suppose they're think legal fee
S0579	oh and they decide mm well the creditors er the erm creditor i think decide not to prosecute
S0454	yeah
S0579	which probably mean they get no money at all
S0454	well it's true
S0579	with all the people who'd be pay them
S0454	it's unfortunate
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i mean it's the system's wrong that that happen but you might lose money
S0579	yeah
S0454	by win
S0579	yeah probably yeah yeah yeah
S0454	yes you lose money either way whether you win or whether you lose
S0579	yeah perhaps you'll be
S0454	you've spend it all on
S0579	perhaps you'll be a good lawyer
S0454	legal fee no employment law's quite good though in spain cos if you have a grudge against your employer you pay your own legal fee but even if you lose you never pay their legal fee
S0579	oh
S0454	and you never pay a court fee
S0579	oh
S0454	and i think well that's quite good because the problem be
S0579	oh that's sensible
S0454	otherwise the employee will never take on a company
S0579	yes no impossible
S0454	because the it would be prohibitive
S0579	yeah
S0454	the court cost if you lose
S0579	yeah
S0454	so that's quite good
S0579	they can keep the court go for hour you know months after months after you'll keep pay you know
S0454	yeah that's right so that's no good
S0579	no no good that
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	this country's get it a bite wrong i think with court fee and
S0579	yeah
S0454	legal fee that actually if you're just you know the creditor like that
S0579	yeah
S0454	there's no point try to prosecute cos people get away with it
S0579	no no i know we we've do several liquidations and they're always very not very nice things to do
S0454	no i can imagine they're unpleasant especially as most people will be completely innocent
S0579	yeah
S0454	and have work hard and someone unfortunately have get away with it usually the manager
S0579	i know i be ask by two bank outside of erm they want an er independent liquidator
S0454	oh right
S0579	for some reason they get me
S0454	oh yes have a good name
S0579	so they they i they must've ask a local bank i suppose and they to recommend and
S0454	yes
S0579	and er oh it be lloyds and the midland i suppose hsbc now of course
S0454	oh right mm yes
S0579	of course it wasn't midland in your day be it
S0454	er it be when i be young i think
S0579	oh be it yeah
S0454	yeah it probably change
S0579	they be the bank who we use to that's right and so they
S0454	yeah
S0579	they ask me to be liquidator
S0454	coop bank's in trouble isn't it
S0579	and i i find it i find it very difficult
S0454	i don't think it's easy even though it's nothing to do with you i mean the decision's be make for you
S0579	no well there's always two side to a question always and they use to find
S0454	well yes but then you're not there to make that decision that decision's be make hasn't it but the time you're call in
S0579	no that's er yes yeah
S0454	it's already be liquidate that's already be decide
S0579	i i remember i remember this liquidation both of the chap involve have pretty reasonable case behind them so you then you end up you're the er liquidator now
S0454	yeah
S0579	what do you do about it
S0454	yes
S0579	i know we yeah i have to come to a conclusion anyhow
S0454	yeah it's not easy
S0579	no not easy no that sort of
S0454	no
S0579	but so no so don't get involve in those things
S0454	no i wouldn't like that
S0579	no no
S0454	no i wouldn't want to be involve in like those kind of decisions
S0579	mm no no no no no
S0454	yeah i feel sorry for you know this steel work i mean they're
S0579	yeah that's on a mammoth scale that be of course
S0454	yes that's right and in a place where there aren't really any other job
S0579	i the news be it still likely they might save it
S0454	the government's try to save it but they don't have a buyer so short of nationalise it which they won't do don't really see what they can do
S0579	well they could make a they could put some money into it couldn't they if the want to
S0454	they could
S0579	without take it all over i mean
S0454	yes they won't nationalise will they
S0579	just support it no no no
S0454	with i mean that's never very popular be it
S0579	no no
S0454	like when northern rock be save
S0579	oh yeah that be
S0454	people be furious
S0579	yeah
S0454	because you like i mean not that you want the poor investors to suffer but at the same the bank's be irresponsible
S0579	yeah
S0454	why should they get taxpayer money
S0579	mm that's right
S0454	and they don't have to pay that back which be incredible
S0579	yeah
S0454	i can understand make a loan but you can say and we save you therefore you pay us back and why be you pay your top executives still
S0579	their money
S0454	it's outrageous
S0579	i know
S0454	and i suppose the steelworks
S0579	no
S0454	haven't be very responsible but
S0579	mm
S0454	top brass have
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know this have be come for probably ten years with cheap steel from china
S0579	yeah
S0454	why be we now wait for the eleventh hour
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then say oh you're gonna lose your job
S0579	i know when this firm i be act for at least at the time when it be get into well liquidation i suppose
S0454	mm
S0579	and the i be i be take the paper home one night look at it and it suddenly dawn on me how it be make it look as if the profit be high up
S0454	oh right
S0579	and so i i think well and when i look i mean back paper after paper after paper i suddenly realise he he'd be shove up the valuation of the stock on
S0454	oh
S0579	so it wasn't show up
S0454	they're clever aren't they
S0579	yeah
S0454	but you wonder whether all you know a lot of financial trade be so complex
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	and so difficult to to track
S0579	now yeah
S0454	they they all seem like crook to be honest
S0579	oh they no they be many of them
S0454	and they may not be break the law in many case but
S0579	they be break the law on this one yeah yeah
S0454	on this one they be and insider trade and things like that that's break the law
S0579	no this no this be break the law
S0454	yes
S0579	they be just cheat the law
S0454	they're so difficult to catch and most people you know even someone look at the book it won't jump out at you straight away
S0579	no no they keep it what what keep it go here they keep inflate the stock
S0454	oh
S0579	year by year
S0454	that's interest
S0579	so that that be make and i be only up there like couple of time a year or something like that and have paper send down
S0454	yes
S0579	well i suddenly realise the stock be vastly i think well these have go up so much over the past twelve months i think well how on earth do it get that high
S0454	yes
S0579	cos i i in my mind i could see all these it be poultry stuff and egg and all that nonsense for sainsbury's
S0454	mm
S0579	and i suddenly realise there must've be something wrong and then then i bring it to an end of course and the company go into liquidation yeah yeah yeah
S0454	oh that's sad isn't it yeah
S0579	i think actually they have say that at the end most of them save their job
S0454	oh that's good
S0579	we be able to sell it off to somebody
S0454	oh that's really good yeah
S0579	yeah yeah so that be good
S0454	yes cos i always feel sorry for the people at the bottom who
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know they've get nothing to do no responsibility for those kind of decisions
S0579	no no responsible no
S0454	they're just there put in their time work you know as they're pay to work and then they lose their job
S0579	it it it normally take two people to do that
S0454	yes
S0579	it the secretary in the case and the other chap be the manager
S0454	yes
S0579	the two together make a good combination
S0454	that's right yes it'll be difficult to get away with it on your own
S0579	on your own be difficult yeah that's right
S0454	yes although that do happen
S0579	yeah
S0454	but yes that's pretty hard
S0579	i think i think i somewhere now they they put a couple of fictitious name in there or something something like that i think yeah
S0454	oh right make you suspicious
S0579	make me suspicious i think i don't recognise this thing you know yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	and now i take my solicitor over we i say i think there's something wrong
S0454	yes
S0579	and when when take him over and we we we take one at a time we just take the manager when i say well what about what do all this mean
S0454	yes
S0579	and immediately he know
S0454	he be catch
S0579	he he he be catch yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	and then he spill the bean like
S0454	yeah that's interest well
S0579	yeah
S0454	you remember my ex yeah
S0579	oh yeah yeah
S0454	and he use to work at the guardian he say what's interest about the uk be we'll punish when those people be prosecute the law come down incredibly hard on economic crime
S0579	yeah
S0454	and surprisingly light on things like murder
S0579	yeah
S0454	or rape particularly
S0579	yes
S0454	where there be almost no prosecutions with rape actually er
S0579	even those yeah
S0454	murder more so when you've get a dead body
S0579	yeah
S0454	at least you can prove it more easily but the law doesn't really see that you might get six years for murder that's pretty much the
S0579	yeah
S0454	norm nowadays you know six years it's not much be it for take someone's life
S0579	no no for life no
S0454	permanently with intent
S0579	yeah
S0454	i don't mean run someone over because you know that would normally be an accident but
S0579	no no yeah didn't yeah
S0454	deliberately kill someone
S0579	yeah
S0454	be pretty premeditate and irreversible
S0579	yeah
S0454	and they get six years but economic crime they'll often get ten twelve years enormous fin
S0579	enormous yeah twelve years yeah
S0454	and the government have always be really strict which say something about how we value what we value in the uk
S0579	yeah
S0454	which be a bite worry actually
S0579	yeah
S0454	they've get a bite better lately i've notice with murder but er the sentence seem to be longer
S0579	yeah sentence should be longer yeah
S0454	yes cos i mean six years for take someone's life
S0579	yeah
S0454	seem a bite of a joke whereas if you look at america
S0454	i mean life be life there isn't it i mean i
S0579	yeah they have executions use to be
S0454	it might be execution in some state but generally it's twenty years or thirty years
S0579	yeah it be yeah but they've stop execute in america haven't they now
S0454	mm most state have stop but i think it's temporary because they have a problem with the eu the eu refuse to sell the drug that be use for lethal injection
S0579	oh i see
S0454	cos i think they all do lethal injection
S0579	oh yeah yeah
S0454	so they refuse to do it and then they source their drug from elsewhere and there be a couple of awful botch executions where they didn't die
S0579	oh
S0454	and you know the heart stop and they take i think half an hour to die or one poor man
S0579	yeah that's terrible isn't it
S0454	incredibly inhumane cos they'd never test these drug on people before and
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	it's all very well say you test it on a rabbit but a rabbit's not a human be it so
S0579	no no
S0454	it might kill a rabbit that doesn't mean it's gonna kill a human in
S0579	no no
S0454	twenty
S0579	that's a terrible way to end somebody's life yeah
S0454	awful i mean no it's public there isn't it the execution the family and the lawyer or whatever can sit and watch and er
S0579	yeah that's right yeah yeah
S0454	dreadful you know the person wake up in the middle and be in agonise pain and all sort of things so they've have to call a a stop on most of them because they i mean what a mess
S0579	they don't have execution in the state now do they
S0454	well they've stay it in a lot of state because of this business with er lethal injections
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	cos the eu have just say we're not sell these drug to you any more
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm which be good
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean that's good but i mean they're gonna get them somewhere aren't they
S0579	well of course yeah but don't do they still execute people in the state then
S0454	some place do
S0579	do they
S0454	yes
S0579	yes yeah
S0454	yes yeah
S0579	cos on on the whole they don't
S0454	no most of them don't
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yes i think texas still do don't they and they've always be a bite more
S0579	oh wild be they
S0454	gung ho yes
S0454	that's right don't mess with the texans
S0579	have they bang bang bang
S0454	they didn't even want to be part of the state do they
S0579	no they no no
S0454	they be the lone star yes
S0579	no no no no oh well
S0454	yes yes so interest
S0579	yes well we haven't have executions here for years i think
S0454	well nineteen sixties i think wasn't it the last one jam hanratty he be the last one he be innocent poor man they exonerate him i think later on
S0579	oh be he
S0454	and he always proclaim his innocence
S0579	yeah
S0454	one of those i think be he be that one of those race motivate where the police have it in for black people and they they pin him to the crime
S0579	i just remember that now yeah yeah
S0454	even though there be no evidence i mean it be more difficult in those days cos they didn't have all that dna
S0579	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0454	test that they do nowadays but there be never any evidence that he be there
S0579	yeah
S0454	apart from
S0579	well they bump him off though didn't they yeah yeah
S0454	i think oh yes they er and he always say he be innocent
S0579	yeah
S0454	and his mother you know say he be she be with he he be with her although of course i suppose a mother might say that anyway just to protect her child
S0579	a mother would say that yeah yeah yeah
S0454	so they didn't believe her and then later they someone else confess that's right another man in prison
S0579	yeah yeah confess yes tell his yeah
S0454	be you know in prison for murder and much later on he say i do it and of course it be too late he be dead the other one
S0579	yeah
S0579	well he get for that
S0454	well he be dead
S0579	no no
S0579	so somebody somebody
S0454	he might've get it
S0579	somebody must've get some
S0454	i expect his mother die before she find out which be sad
S0579	oh yes a terrible thing yeah
S0454	yes but that be one of the arguments against it though wasn't it that
S0579	i do remember that now yeah that's right yeah
S0454	unfortunately innocent people
S0579	yeah do
S0454	i mean even if they be in the build it doesn't necessarily prove they kill them
S0579	they do it no no no no
S0454	so you know that's not really good enough to say well
S0579	yeah
S0454	's fingerprint's here so therefore she i might've just be visit the house
S0579	yeah and it might've be mine
S0454	yes
S0579	that's right no no
S0454	and then there's always the risk that the police be corrupt and be so desperate to get a conviction
S0579	yeah
S0454	that they will fabricate evidence
S0579	yeah
S0454	plant evidence er you don't know do you cos there's be a lot of miscarriages of justice
S0579	no
S0454	what be that that one with the bomb be it the birmingham what be they call the
S0579	oh yes it be yes
S0454	they be all innocent weren't they they get exonerate but it turn out the police have
S0579	yeah that's right yeah yeah
S0454	fabricate
S0579	that's right
S0454	evidence and well by
S0579	they convict too weren't they and spend in jail didn't they
S0454	they spend years in jail
S0579	yeah
S0454	one of them be just a boy who be about sixteen when it happen
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yeah it's cos they didn't like the irish do they
S0579	well that's right actually that's yeah
S0454	i mean and i suppose there's always a risk that that will happen
S0579	they're go to be wrong yeah
S0454	yes and they might not've be very nice people
S0454	but that didn't mean that they do that
S0579	oh yes there be no evidence you wonder how do they get so put down then don't you yes
S0454	yeah well i think they weren't i mean they be kinda drifters two of the boys
S0579	oh be they yeah
S0454	you know they sort of live in a doss house and i suppose seem a bite unsavoury they're probably petty you know petty criminals but
S0579	yeah criminals probably yeah
S0454	petty criminal to terrorist be quite a jump
S0579	that's right yeah that's right
S0454	and probably not in their best interest
S0579	no no no
S0454	to draw attention but anyway there as a kind of racial prejudice there i suppose
S0579	no no
S0454	and the police be under enormous pressure under those you know when those crimes happen
S0579	yes
S0454	the funny thing be with that be the ira step in and say they didn't do it we do it and they still jail them the police still jail them even though the ira have confess which be interest isn't it
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	so the police just decide to ignore
S0579	oh
S0454	what they'd be tell cos they be so desperate for a conviction and by that stage they have threaten and get false confessions out of the two boys er
S0579	they didn't bump them off though do they
S0454	no no they didn't but i mean that's an argument you know why we shouldn't have the death penalty
S0579	no why we shouldn't yeah yeah
S0454	because at least i mean they're probably
S0579	yeah
S0454	traumatise but and they do spend years in prison but they do get out in the end
S0579	cos we don't have a death penalty now do we
S0454	only for treason apparently we never get rid of it
S0579	only for treason
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh yeah that's right
S0454	which be quite interest cos treason could be use against terrorists presumably
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	i mean you could say it be a crime against the state
S0579	yeah okay yeah treason if er
S0454	yes yes but we've never use it well not since the sixties and that be for murder that one that jam hanratty one
S0579	treason yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	it's murder seem a worse case than treason doesn't it
S0454	well it do yes and then again you think
S0579	it doesn't they they don't match up do they
S0454	why why have we get it for treason and not for
S0579	no no mm bump somebody off
S0454	bump someone off yeah it do seem very odd
S0579	yeah yeah it's very strange
S0454	yes
S0579	use to be funny er it's odd how people behave here cos when we use to have these prison sentence when in the day when they have capital capital penalties people use to er hang out outside the prisons hadn't they
S0454	oh right
S0579	when they on the day of execution i mean
S0454	what to watch you mean
S0579	well not to well
S0454	or to protest
S0579	they they didn't actually see it but they they they put up a flag or pull one down when it have just take place like
S0454	what be people support it or people against it
S0579	yeah well both i think for and against yeah
S0454	oh right that's the trouble isn't it that there'll be
S0579	yeah
S0454	gory sort of
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	people who get kick out of that sort of thing
S0579	yeah it be yeah some do yeah
S0454	so you i mean it's another reason not to have it you don't really want to perpetuate that kind of
S0579	not really no no
S0454	no it's a bite like the old medieval days put head on spike wasn't it and leave them outside the city wall
S0579	chop off yeah spike
S0454	it's not that different put a flag up to put a head on a pole
S0579	no no yes yeah that's right
S0454	but i suppose people have always be a bite gory like that
S0579	yeah that's right in those days they just cut people's head off didn't they and swords
S0454	yeah that's right
S0579	rather than gun
S0454	yes
S0579	cos that bring a lot more deaths when we get the gun out
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah yes
S0454	well the americans say they won't do it again
S0579	no no probably not
S0454	hundred percent effective
S0579	probably i suppose that's so yes
S0454	you know the funny thing be
S0579	er
S0454	it's actually more expensive to execute prisoners than it be not to because of the legal proceed in the state because they get an automatic right of appeal
S0579	oh yes right yeah they go on for ever yeah yeah
S0454	which they don't have to pay for
S0579	go on for years doesn't it
S0454	that go on for years apparently the average stay on death row be ten to fifteen years
S0579	yes i read about that the other day i think that be terrible
S0454	it's horrific isn't it those poor men yes well it's not all men but
S0579	didn't they just recently bump somebody off not very long back
S0454	yes i think they do
S0579	well after about twenty years i mean that sound crazy to do that yeah yeah
S0454	poor man yes how awful to live your life with that hang over you
S0579	yeah that's right but have a conviction twenty years later that sound absurd
S0454	he seem to have serve his time already whatever he do
S0579	well that's right yeah yeah
S0454	in a way i mean you should just have a a statute of limitations which just say
S0579	yeah
S0454	if you spend more than fifteen years in prison
S0579	that's it yeah
S0454	that's it let him go
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	you know because it's just take too long and that's
S0579	yeah
S0454	in itself a death sentence isn't it just
S0579	you'd've think so yeah
S0454	wait like that
S0579	yes
S0454	i feel sorry for them
S0579	then bump somebody off twenty years down the line sound wrong doesn't it
S0454	yeah and the cost you see be it doesn't add up it's very very expensive to keep go back to court for the government
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	doesn't add up at all but then prison be very ineffective be say like they're
S0579	be the countries still with do they er do we have countries do we have death penalties
S0454	this country
S0579	no not ours
S0454	other countries
S0579	yeah
S0454	i suppose the middle east still do
S0579	do they
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yes they use it against drug erm
S0579	drug and
S0454	drug pushers a lot
S0579	yeah
S0454	mostly drug pushers also people suspect of terrorist activities
S0579	oh terrorists well you can bump those off i suppose
S0454	but how but they torture prisoners in most of the gulf countries so how many be actually rightfully convict i i don't know i mean if you be torture
S0579	oh yeah no no torture
S0454	you wonder how accurate these confessions really be you'd probably say anything after a while
S0579	no that's right you would yeah yeah
S0454	and those prisons over there i mean
S0579	mean prisons yeah
S0454	cos i have a friend out there and he work for the police as a ambulance driver
S0579	yeah
S0454	paramedic and they use to take him into prisons a lot because a lot of the prisoners
S0579	yeah
S0454	try and kill themselves
S0579	yeah
S0454	and he have to certify their death as a paramedic and he say you wouldn't believe the condition i mean disgust
S0579	yeah
S0454	like they treat them like animals and you would want to kill yourself and you probably would confess just to get better treatment in the end so
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes they convict a lot but how many be rightfully convict
S0579	yeah
S0454	i don't know
S0579	course your dad's always have an interest in prisoners hasn't he
S0454	he have hasn't he yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes it's interest isn't it
S0579	he do it well since he's be be eighteen now i think he's be prisoners
S0454	yeah yeah it's very interest yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	keep it go
S0454	yes think i've get another book for my airbnb just come through on my phone
S0579	oh do that you have someone act for you do you
S0454	well it's all online goodness i have someone
S0579	do you have to be at home to do that
S0454	yes although they're quite long april the seventeenth to june the first ah i think it's just an enquiry though that's quite a long time isn't it seven weeks april the seventeenth to june the first mm it's a nice bite of money
S0579	and what you get
S0454	well she want april the seventeenth to june the first that's a month and a half isn't it six weeks
S0579	oh a long time then
S0454	but she probably want a deal but
S0579	oh
S0454	i suppose for six weeks i probably could make her a deal couldn't i
S0579	i suppose there be a certainty what you get then isn't it
S0454	cos i just put my price up yesterday and she doesn't know
S0579	oh well that's doesn't know oh right
S0454	so i could put back down to the old price for her
S0579	yes oh yes oh
S0454	and then pretend that's a deal
S0579	that's a deal yes that's a good idea isn't it
S0454	or i could go in between
S0579	go in between that's right
S0454	cos i put it up to twenty a night
S0579	do she know that then
S0454	yeah she'll know that but she'll want a deal
S0579	oh oh
S0454	but i could say if you're stay six weeks then i could put it down to eighteen a night say
S0579	yeah she'd probably take that on i expect
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes that's right normally they the sight suggest if someone stay seven nights you give em a night free because it's less work for you
S0579	yeah
S0454	to change the sheet once than to change the sheet seven time
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos you've get seven different visitors and seven time let someone in so actually it's to my advantage
S0579	yeah but but you turn them down if it's easy to find find somebody else i suppose
S0454	oh yes yes i get enquiries all the time now
S0579	oh do you
S0454	yeah but i think they probably email six or seven different house and see who offer the best deal
S0579	oh right oh i see best deal
S0454	and then go with that one
S0579	course a lot depend on what what the er house you've get isn't it
S0454	yes yes that's right mine's new
S0579	if you've get some gonna say if you've get some tumbledown house
S0454	yes
S0579	you expect to be a lower price for it
S0454	that's right and the location be important this girl say she's work in
S0579	the location's important
S0454	so there's no point her stay in cos the traffic would be horrendous try to get out
S0579	oh oh yes
S0454	whereas i'm on the so it's probably only twenty minutes
S0579	what do i know about use to know that place
S0454	farm probably have big farm town isn't it well rural
S0579	i seem to remember see that chap who be er what be he now an mp for down that way who be have trouble
S0454	oh right
S0579	that
S0454	i don't know i i didn't really follow local politics here

S0579	course i i always find with well at least when someone's do that one of those things they always find out immediately just tap in the name and it come
S0454	yeah do you oh actually that's a good idea you know i don't think of do that enough actually
S0579	i think do put things in like like that
S0454	might put that in see what
S0579	course you've gotta you have a judge come up cos it's judge anyhow
S0454	oh be he a judge google
S0579	well he be a judge but this one er the other one i'm talk about
S0579	he he wasn't a judge no this wasn't a judge
S0454	mp
S0579	oh he might he be a member of parliament i suppose yeah
S0454	try that i i'll tell you now
S0579	sound like him
S0454	to
S0579	yeah that's it
S0454	that sound like him affair oh okay here we go turn out suspicion in the nineteen seventies
S0579	bump somebody off
S0454	it be a political sex scandal that end the career of
S0579	that's him yeah that's right yes
S0454	erm allege by that he'd be a in a homosexual relationship with in the nineteen sixties at a time when it be illegal
S0579	yeah
S0454	sad isn't it cos nowadays of course that wouldn't end his career would it

S0579	yeah
S0454	that erm turn him in and ruin his career
S0579	turn him in yeah
S0454	nasty person wasn't he
S0579	yeah i remember i remember the
S0454	and of a hire gunman goodness that's the stuff of a novel isn't it
S0579	yeah it be a bite like that yes
S0454	none of the witness impress the court in other word they be lie and it be find that one of them would gain financially if be find guilty
S0579	oh well that's
S0454	all four defendants be acquit nevertheless 's public reputation be irreparably damage by the case he do not testify and he retire and sadly he get parkinson's shortly afterwards and die in two thousand fourteen oh poor man isn't that awful they probably make it up you know
S0579	and we i saw him one night
S0454	it's very sad isn't it
S0579	i be over in and i saw him come into a local pub there
S0454	mm right
S0454	nineteen twenty nine he be bear
S0579	i think he'd have a something about him which wasn't quite right with er do things
S0454	yes
S0454	well
S0579	i have a feel he come to one of the meet
S0454	yes but i mean that that's not exactly well he wouldn't even if he be find to have be a homosexual you would be fine nowadays wouldn't you
S0579	be he be he homosexual be that it
S0454	well that's what it all be base on cos at that time it be illegal so that ruin his career but he be never find guilty
S0579	no no no yeah
S0454	and the defendants be find to have would've make money if he have be find guilty so they have a a reason to
S0579	yeah that be that be wasn't it
S0454	smear him yeah
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	nasty isn't it
S0579	yeah i know he's yeah there be a funny relationship there
S0454	oh my goodness in in bbc erm sorry a bbc documentary in twenty twenty fourteen find a fire arm collector claim he have be hire by oh sorry by a liberal to kill for thirteen thousand five hundred pound
S0579	really yeah so
S0454	but instead he pass the job on to his associate and provide him with a gun erm but ah right so that might've be hire someone to kill they think
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i mean you would if someone ruin your career base on lie wouldn't you
S0579	i i think i think yeah
S0454	think it'd be fairly understandable
S0579	be it wasn't he er wasn't he find guilty like though be he or not
S0454	no the it look like the police remove all reference to
S0579	oh yeah someone get him behind the scenes yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	friends of his
S0454	and it be a and then
S0579	yeah

S0579	do do he do he last year do do he like die though hasn't he

S0579	i see
S0454	and i can't someone can't double book
S0579	oh
S0454	so that's quite good cos if you have to do it all yourself
S0579	oh
S0454	it'd be quite a mathematical puzzle i think seventeenth of april so it look like yeah look like it's okay actually
S0579	yes your mum's good on that she work that one quite well doesn't she she do one of she's get one of those things
S0454	yes seventeenth of april yeah that look okay actually third to the fifth of august be the only thing i've get book in at the moment so that's very good let's see
S0579	you can't pick up information about people on there though can you
S0454	yes should i show you i'll show you with one
S0579	so you
S0454	okay so this girl have send me erm she have to accord to the site she have to introduce herself she have to tell me the purpose of her visit and she have to have have various piece of id identify by them before she can email me
S0579	oh
S0454	so they've do some kind of preliminary check and then i can click on her so let me try and do that
S0579	so you have to look at that every day do you more or less
S0454	well depend how often people email me but yes i'm try to get a good rat so i'm
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm try to respond to everything within at least within twelve hours
S0579	oh oh i see yeah
S0454	but it's good it send it to my phone and it send it to my email
S0579	oh so you've get very good probably
S0454	mm i block tonight off so no one can book tonight
S0579	no no
S0454	erm so you can block off days or weeks when you don't want to deal with people
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	so i block off next friday too so she can't that erm so let's try and have a look at her so how can i find that good question mm ah here she be okay she's from that's her
S0579	oh yes
S0454	we can see that she's marry from her photo erm she's be a member since last august she have sixty seven friends on facebook she study at college in school and university
S0579	oh
S0454	and that's all so she hasn't get much other information mm that would net four hundred and seventy pound a month
S0579	oh
S0454	which be seventy pound over the market rate the market rate in be four hundred pound a month
S0579	oh so you've get oh
S0454	so seventy pound extra which be nearly a week extra actually
S0579	well that's
S0454	so er i should accept that it's lucky i put the price up last night wasn't it
S0454	otherwise she'd be get a good deal
S0579	no that's right yes
S0454	i though oh i'll whack them up cos i'm get lot of book so i though oh i'll put them up and see what happen cos i'm book the next two weeks for five nights a week
S0579	that's marvellous thing to do though you you can get things settle in second can't you on the there yes
S0454	yeah so what i can do now be send her a message back say yes at the moment i have availability
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i be get book up very quickly
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then i can do pre approve her date and all she have to do then be click
S0579	but how do you make sure you get your money
S0454	they do it all for me so that's the beauty of the site i never touch the money
S0579	so that hasn't come all er have say yes it have to go through them do it
S0454	yes so what would happen then be they would take the money out her account automatically
S0579	oh i see
S0454	immediately they would take that out her account but i don't see that money
S0454	until the day after she check in
S0579	oh no
S0454	that way if she come to my house and find it didn't exist
S0579	yeah
S0454	she could then email the company and say doesn't exist
S0579	yeah
S0454	i want my money back and she would get it back
S0579	course in a genuine case she'd like yes
S0454	i suppose people do fiddle it don't they
S0579	oh probably yes
S0454	yeah so that way they hold onto the money and then on the second night of her stay they release the whole amount
S0579	oh
S0454	even though that's a month ahead
S0579	yeah
S0454	and they send that directly to my bank account and i get it about three days later and they pay me
S0579	yeah
S0454	every week so i don't have to wait till the end of the month they pay me on a weekly basis
S0579	oh that's nic
S0454	and they take commission of about a pound a night never more than a pound a night
S0579	oh that's not a lot then
S0454	not a lot consider they're insure me as well
S0579	yeah that's
S0454	so they're insure me against theft and damage
S0454	and they're handle the book for me and they handle the money for me so i mean a pound a night's a bargain
S0579	that's good well i'm go to say you don't normally get that sort of thing do you
S0454	i think it's really good i think it's an excellent service yeah
S0579	be it they don't all do that though do they
S0454	yeah they do it
S0579	at the same sort of level do they
S0454	well the other sit
S0579	it sound cheap like
S0454	this this be er yeah it's quite cheap isn't it i think a pound a night's a very good erm deal
S0579	yeah that sound deal like yeah yeah
S0454	for for the amount of things
S0579	yeah
S0454	but this be worldwide now so i suppose they've decide
S0579	oh i see
S0454	a pound a night
S0579	yeah
S0454	if you do that across the world
S0579	oh yeah that's
S0454	and you've get twenty thousand book
S0579	you'll make some money
S0454	and it's all online so it's not like someone's sit there
S0579	no no
S0454	do it you know they've probably get a staff of about twenty to manage the whole world
S0579	yeah
S0454	and erm
S0579	yeah well
S0454	yeah they're probably rake it in
S0579	that's it yes happen very quickly when you've get one of those things doesn't it
S0454	yes
S0579	do they take the money there and then on these things
S0454	from her yes they take it from her
S0579	yeah
S0454	but erm i wouldn't get it till after she check in hi erm yes just check the calendar
S0579	cos you're protect cos you've get a sort of a get the message and if it's someone you don't like you just don't do it
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	and they they do have a sort of check in place they say if the person check in and you don't like them then contact us and we'll tell you what to do so they do have a bite of a
S0579	yeah yeah i see yes yeah
S0454	a safety thing but i suppose that's always a risk isn't it with rent your house that they might turn out to be an alcoholic or a thief or something and
S0579	don't know yeah
S0454	don't know what you do
S0579	oh
S0454	hi i just check the calendar
S0579	this be there's another world with all these things
S0454	at the moment erm i be free on those date erm i be get quite a lot of enquiries about longer stay
S0579	i see well that's an enormous improvement have to write letter isn't it
S0454	yes
S0579	i remember years and years ago when you those things you use to you use to have disk and you play them on disk and give you some information i've forget how that use to work
S0454	oh right
S0579	i know we have some of the early machine in our office but that's yes
S0454	okay so i'll just save that at the moment mm
S0579	on that you you can get the cash in second can you on those things
S0454	well they won't give it to me until the that she's check in
S0579	have she
S0454	erm about forty eight hours after she's check in they'll send the money to me so they take the money off her
S0579	yeah oh i see yeah
S0454	and they hold it in their bank account
S0579	oh so it's be do like effectively
S0454	so they've get her money
S0579	so and it just make satisfaction the other end and that's it yeah
S0454	yeah so then they just hold it and check basically that she's check in although they don't ever email them to check
S0579	check in yeah
S0454	they just expect the customer to email them if there's a problem
S0579	to do it yeah
S0454	and then after that they'll send me the full amount goodness me so it say total eight hundred pound not bad be it but how many months be that i don't quite understand this actually it say the total be eight hundred pound but they're take a hundred pound commission which be quite a lot that's a bite annoy so i earn seven hundred pound so i earn seven hundred pound
S0579	you er do you have to say accept it or not
S0454	yes i'm just try to do the maths
S0579	yes
S0454	but okay she want to check in on the seventeenth of april let's try and do this together erm seventeenth of april to the
S0579	that's not far away
S0454	no
S0579	it's the first today yeah
S0454	and i'm book until then actually so she'll have trouble
S0579	oh
S0454	she can't come before that erm let's have a look
S0579	how quick everything be now they go to a firm i mean it'd take days to
S0454	yeah this be amaze isn't it really
S0579	yeah
S0454	so she want from the seventeenth of april so let's count the weeks that's one week two three four five six
S0579	do they do they enclose recommendations from somewhere to show it's okay
S0454	usually
S0579	yeah
S0454	seven i think it's seven weeks she want till the first of june that's not quite right okay so she want seventeenth of april one two right one
S0579	i suppose erm when when 's off to university somewhere she'll have spare space in her room
S0454	yes i ask her about that
S0579	yeah
S0454	have trouble work this out four five six look like six weeks seven days six week sorry six weeks and three days so six weeks and three days so that's six weeks six time seven forty two forty five nights isn't it let's work that out a night so
S0579	forty four nights it be be it
S0454	forty four nights be it
S0579	be it seven days and time six be forty two
S0454	forty two plus three
S0579	yeah plus three yeah
S0454	okay so if we go to calculator so what do we say forty two plus three forty five so i get six hundred and ninety five divide by forty five say so it work out as fifteen a night not brilliant
S0579	doesn't sound brilliant no no
S0454	no but that's because i think i've put in a discount if someone book a month
S0579	oh i see
S0454	maybe i need to check that actually
S0579	do they pay up front on these things
S0454	yeah so that's the advantage
S0579	oh yeah i see
S0454	even if she cancel
S0579	you can't you
S0454	i would get yeah she can still cancel up to a week ahead
S0579	your cancellation oh can they
S0454	and i think
S0579	even if they send the money to you
S0454	they hold the money
S0579	oh they hold the money oh well
S0454	but i think i get a percentage still like fifty percent
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	but i'm not sure but if she cancel with less than a week's notice she doesn't get a penny back
S0579	oh
S0454	i get nearly all of it
S0454	yeah fifteen a night's not great but then it be seven hundred pound up front which be quite
S0579	it be seven yes
S0454	it be yes it be quite a lot of money suppose the other thing i can do er just check first er so it's
S0579	and well if you if you say no do they come back with a fresh offer sometimes
S0454	well no it's my fault you see because i can put in discount but i can't really go the other way
S0579	oh i see yes
S0454	so i've put in a figure per night which be twenty pound a night at the moment
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i've also put in if someone stay for a week then i'll discount them this amount and if they stay for a month
S0579	you another one
S0454	then i'll discount them this amount because that way i know every single night's book
S0579	be cover yes
S0454	and also that i'm not do very much work
S0579	no
S0454	cos i'm do be change the sheet once a week and give them fresh towel whereas
S0579	yes
S0454	if someone come
S0579	oh you've gotta change all the time
S0454	a different person each night
S0579	yes
S0454	that's actually quite a lot of work and i've get to be there
S0579	mm
S0454	if she's in all the time
S0579	mm
S0454	i don't have to be there
S0579	no
S0454	but if someone's come every night then i've get to be there to give them a key i've get to show them round i've get to wash the sheet get to
S0579	oh that's a bite of a nuisance
S0454	yeah so really you don't want people change all the time cos it's a nuisance
S0579	not one night no no fifteen nights yeah
S0454	but this this perhaps i don't know what to do about this yes trouble be as well with someone stay that long be you might not like them
S0579	cos you don't don't you don't have to meet people before then yeah so
S0454	no but normally they just stay a night or two
S0579	oh i see
S0454	so then you don't really mind if someone's stay much longer then i suppose you might mind i think i'll have a look at my offer actually see what i've put it in at
S0579	cos they if they'd pay for longer do they pay upfront
S0454	erm yes they still pay but it's pay into their account airbnb's account not into my personal account
S0579	i see yeah so your money's always it's secure like that be it
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah do you employ estate agents on that do you
S0454	no they do it all for me
S0579	all by itself do they
S0454	they advertise it for me
S0579	oh pretty good isn't it
S0454	they send a photographer round for me professional one for free
S0579	gosh that's that's very good
S0454	he's come on monday
S0579	yeah so that's very good
S0454	and then they upload all the photos for me i don't own the photos then of course they own them
S0579	yeah course yeah
S0454	it's not bad be it
S0579	very good go yeah
S0454	i mean the other thing be it's a three bedroom house
S0579	oh yes yeah
S0454	so i could rent out the other room and sleep in the third one
S0579	oh or could camp outside
S0454	yes because that way actually
S0579	yeah
S0454	i could double my money couldn't i
S0579	double your money i can see that yeah
S0454	because what i'm do now be i'm rent the middle room not the biggest which i've get
S0579	mm
S0454	and not the smallest
S0579	oh
S0454	which no one's in but i could rent out the two big the middle one and the big one and i could charge twenty five pound a night for the big one
S0579	yes
S0454	and then whenever i get a book there i could move into the small room myself
S0579	do you have them for that length of time then do you sometimes
S0454	this be unusual but i'm get a lot of people who want to book longer term
S0579	oh yeah so
S0454	yes i'm not quite sure about this because it's i you see the trouble be because i've put in that discount that might've be a mistake
S0579	yeah
S0454	i probably shouldn't've put in such a big discount i want to check what i do actually right i'm gonna copy that text and check what i've do with the erm discount cos i can't remember but that do seem possible
S0579	do that mean it's be do all now though that whole
S0454	no i haven't i've just i just want to know i just do the maths
S0454	that's quite a lot less than i would be get otherwise but then i suppose i could rent out the third room
S0579	oh no you no you'd be a millionaire in no time
S0454	yes grandpa just think you could rent out these and make a fortune
S0579	yeah yeah i know that's yeah that's right yes buy another house
S0454	i know i do think that and you know this be all tax free the government's just change it in this budget that you can earn up to seven thousand something or other a year from rent a room out in the house that you live in
S0579	yeah
S0454	without pay tax
S0579	oh
S0454	which be huge i mean you'd be hard press to earn seven thousand pound by rent out a room
S0579	yes
S0454	have to have someone here every night
S0579	well well that sound rather good
S0454	yeah so that's very good and even if you go over the erm
S0579	seven thousand
S0454	seven thousand you would pay tax but then you could claim wear and tear so what i'm not allow to do be claim wear and tear with this because i'm not pay tax
S0579	i see yeah
S0454	but i don't have to put it on my tax return they say it's completely tax free and it's it's outside of the
S0579	oh so you don't have to worry then mm yeah
S0454	and it's all through a site so if i need to account for it i can show you know that's what i earn
S0579	yeah
S0454	here be the they give me receipt they give me vat receipt it's all good
S0579	oh pretty good go yeah
S0454	but that's a very nice thing i say to she should do it when go cos it's a nice source of income
S0579	oh
S0454	right let's have a look
S0579	some more property owners
S0454	calendar
S0579	yeah
S0454	and more yes sorry this be a bite bore but i could make eight hundred pound in five minutes
S0579	yeah it's good isn't it
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	okay so let's see price so i'm
S0579	do the money come through automatically now then
S0454	ah i see that's what i've do
S0579	yeah
S0454	it will come through when she check in so it say i've set it at twenty pound a night
S0579	yeah
S0454	the website think i should set it at twenty one pound a night cos what it do it it calculate the average price in the area
S0579	oh i see
S0454	and base on my rat so it it's tell me when i start off i should put it at fifteen and it tell me go to eighteen
S0579	yeah
S0454	and last week it tell me go to twenty one and i go to twenty last night
S0579	oh why how do they just all the other price
S0454	erm well i suppose the first one they just guess
S0579	oh i see yeah
S0454	and then they get the next one and then they
S0579	yeah
S0454	calculate how many book each place get and they calculate the you know automatically
S0579	they er
S0454	the maximum market rate
S0579	oh i see
S0454	which be sustainable so they've work out that for my type of property i i could charge twenty one now
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	a night because i've have lot of book so they know i'm popular
S0579	yeah popular yeah
S0454	yes but i say i'd give ten percent discount on a weekly and twenty percent i say on monthly so that's why they say i should do twenty seven percent
S0579	oh
S0454	i need to put that down don't i
S0579	yes i see yes
S0454	so i'm gonna go down to ten percent
S0579	yeah
S0454	do you think
S0579	sound about right yes
S0454	ten percent discount
S0579	yeah
S0454	so then i'd get five hundred it calculate it all for me then i would get five hundred and twenty pound a month
S0579	oh well that sound reasonable enough doesn't it
S0454	whereas if i do twenty percent
S0579	yeah
S0454	i would get four hundred and sixty two pound a month maybe i should do fifteen percent
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	if i do fifteen percent then i'd get four hundred and ninety one pound
S0579	i see it's under hundred yeah
S0454	so let's do sixteen percent if i do sixteen percent four hundred and eighty how do that work sixteen percent oh no sorry sixteen pound a month seventeen percent four hundred and eighty fifteen pound a month would be four hundred and ninety one
S0579	i suppose eventually all that become automatic in your mind doesn't it all these percentages
S0454	fourteen yes
S0454	thirteen percent discount would be five hundred and three pound a month
S0579	oh
S0454	that's what i want isn't it
S0579	beg your pardon
S0454	that's what i want really
S0579	oh that's what you want yes i see
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes okay so i'll just send her one back say just send her a quick message
S0579	and you send it here and now on that can you
S0454	oh yes and now it's change it to five hundred and eleven pound a month complicate but yes after a while i'm gonna get the rat right cos the thing be i they say start if off low because a lot of it go on your rat the
S0579	yeah
S0454	rat that the other customers the you know the review that they write
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	because that be what sell products
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	and this be a product isn't it
S0579	yeah
S0454	and once you've build up a few good review
S0579	you you
S0454	then stick your price up
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	and then hopefully you'll keep get the book and they're absolutely right
S0454	actually
S0579	oh
S0454	the first couple of book come in slowly and now i've get
S0579	now you're in
S0454	yeah because i've get straight five star review off everybody who stay so far
S0579	oh that's brilliant
S0454	so that sell because no one else in the area
S0579	yeah have get it yeah
S0454	have get that so i've get they're get the average be seventy four percent and i've get a hundred percent
S0579	how can well how do they arrive at that figure then
S0454	it's a bite arbitrary they give them some categories like cleanliness
S0579	oh yes
S0454	arrival value for money
S0579	yeah
S0454	so they give them those and then i suppose
S0579	yeah well i see
S0454	it just calculate it
S0579	yeah
S0454	five star be a hundred percent and so on so
S0579	you've get you've get one of those have you
S0454	i've get six at a hundred percent
S0579	oh well that's even better then
S0454	which mean in the rank
S0579	yeah
S0454	i'll go to the top
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then i deliberately undercharge a bite because then if you sort by price i would always come out on top so whether they sort by price or by rat i be gonna come out the highest
S0579	oh well
S0454	but now i've put my price up i can't do that any more
S0579	no well that's so you get a bite more out of it then
S0454	yes
S0579	yes
S0454	six hundred and ninety four
S0579	be you fully book on the new price
S0454	erm no the i be fully book on the old price
S0579	yeah
S0454	so this be the first one
S0579	i see yeah
S0454	yeah seven hundred and fifty five hi i'm available on those date

S0579	yeah
S0454	so i'm not go to accept or send a special offer where i can offer her a further discount
S0454	so what might happen now be i've send her a slightly higher price back so she might say oh i'd love to stay but that's far too expensive for me
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	could you make me an offer and then i might say well seven hundred and fifty five pound i'll take seven hundred
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i might send her back a further discount or she might just look at it and go well you know what i'm just gonna pay it
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes let's see that six hundred and ninety four
