S0324	cos then you're like colleagues and it's really weird
S0325	yeah it's like but you wouldn't say good boy well no you would say good boy but you wouldn't say good woman good woman you'd say good man
S0324	yeah because good man make just like woman sound really weird

S0324	maybe
S0325	you could
S0324	yeah actually yeah you could
S0325	like a very butch
S0324	a butch good man
S0325	good man yeah but you'd also be like

S0325	whatever you'd just be like great well do and i would be like
S0324	good
S0325	every time i think oh maybe i'll say good girl i'll think of that in my head and be like no
S0324	well do
S0325	i can't say that when i'm and miss she go yes if boys if you go into primary school teach or nurse you'll get load of money and i'm like but why
S0324	yeah
S0325	and it's like cos it's cos it's mainly female female base and i'm like yeah but
S0324	why do that mean that you'll get load of money
S0325	exactly and she's like girls that go into stem get more promotions i'm like how be that fair
S0324	no they don't that's not true
S0325	she's like you'll get load of money if you go into stem more cos like and i'm like what cos like you're the minority and she be like no cos you get load of promotions and i'm like well what about the boys don't they get promotions as well
S0324	yeah exactly yeah but obviously if they do get more promotions it's because they're a girl like in term of like what she's say
S0325	yeah
S0324	that girls get more promotions in stem
S0325	then actually it should be
S0324	well that's not even true
S0325	you get more promotions because of what you're do
S0324	yeah exactly not because because you're a girl
S0325	girls can do stem better than boys
S0324	that's so weird she's she's really confuse
S0325	yeah she's like guy if you go into the nurse sector like boys you then you'll get load of money i'm like why why can't a girl just get load of money from go into like the nurse i'm like well surely you can just like like anybody surely you should all get the same amount of money isn't that like what the equality be
