S0109	so small compare to the last one which be absolutely huge
S0052	why have you get a new one
S0109	because the old one belong to and he want it for his brother
S0052	fair enough
S0109	and it cost like two hundred and fifty pound and i be scar of it
S0052	how much do that one cost
S0109	eh thirty
S0052	oh
S0109	yeah
S0052	how be his little brother now
S0109	how be he
S0052	yes
S0109	i have absolutely no idea
S0052	okay
S0109	i'm assume that he's
S0052	go back to university
S0109	go back and he's yes yes yes he be he be cos em he's go to visit him in at university after pathfinders last night
S0052	oh okay
S0109	so that's a five hour walk five hour car journey to be undertake at half past nine at night
S0052	yeah that's odd
S0109	to come back on sunday even
S0052	for pathfinders or be that in the morning
S0109	no just just because he's get a work on eh
S0052	monday
S0109	monday he should have be at pathfinders on sunday morning but eh he swap off
S0052	oh i see
S0109	yeah
S0052	some people's job maybe something quite so
S0109	yeah and some people be very very busy well i don't know i i would never drive for a long time like that without a break cos i just don't think i'd
S0052	well actually if i drive two by the time i've drive for about two hours my back really hurt but if it wasn't for that i could probably drive for quite a long time
S0109	like attention span wise
S0052	yeah
S0109	and what about your feet don't you get a cramp cos you have to hold your feet in the same position the whole time
S0052	mm no i don't i mean i don't think my foot my foot mind feet rather it's just my back it become horribly painful do that look like one amount of food
S0109	eh eh yeah
S0052	yeah
S0109	cos you eat that but without vegetables with extra vegetable
S0052	oh yeah it's get load of vegetables in it's get courgettes and carrots and pepper and onions
S0109	mm
S0052	that's good so i've get ten to freeze i've give two away and i've get one to eat so i've make thirteen thirteen and one
S0109	yeah
S0052	oh
S0109	that's not many that didn't come out right how many be that mean to be that pot be it be it like ten
S0052	it be like a really large one well it depend what you're cook cos i i mean this be bolognaise so you know you do pasta with it separately so then you can cook more can't you
S0109	i suppose
S0052	do i'm down to like not very much food well i'm not now but i be
S0109	i have absolutely nothing in
S0052	oh but you never do
S0109	well i normally have something
S0052	i've get one curry one hot pot and ten bolognaise
S0109	mean that if i prepare food and freeze it and i don't it's not the food that i want on that particular day
S0052	ah but if you have a choice then it surely could be
S0109	yeah
S0052	i don't think i never i normally have much of an opinion i just want food oh i didn't mean to do that
S0109	what do you do
S0052	well i don't want to freeze it all i want to put some in the fridge cos then i can eat it even quicker
S0109	i mean surely it doesn't take
S0052	sorry
S0109	surely it doesn't take that much longer from
S0052	no but i'll eat two this week so i might as well not be freeze them
S0052	ha whoa something isn't go please may i borrow the tea towel
S0109	yes
S0052	oh dear
S0109	so when will you be when be this guy go to contact you
S0052	em well say next week sometime so probably one even next week i guess hopefully before ideally before thursday cos if the interview me that will be on friday so i would like to know before then when i'll know from actually i don't need to know but i need to know when i'll know so i can say to them i'm not gonna say yes to any job that you offer me until this date if that mean you're not offer me a job at all that's fine
S0109	do teach job tend to offer you on the day do they
S0052	yes
S0109	ah
S0052	they expect you to tell them on the day whether or not you'd accept it if you're offer it at the end of it the the last question of at interview be normally if i offer you this job would you accept it and if you say if you say yes and then don't that's really bad like that's not really do do you know what i mean
S0109	yeah but it's not legally bind you just wouldn't do it
S0052	no no it's not legally bind but they will want to have appoint someone by the end of the day em but will do be if i mean if they really like me then i can say i won't be able to accept until the end of next week
S0109	mm hm
S0052	and then they can either decide they can't wait or they can say okay we'll wait until then
S0109	and then you never go to second round then
S0052	yeah
S0109	that be so much better than all the interview i've ever be in
S0052	but you normally have to teach a lesson so it's like a whole day interview so you go for a day and you'll have a tour of the school probably meet members of staff and stuff you'll teach a lesson that lot of people will watch and then you'll have an interview with several people
S0109	mm
S0052	and they'll do that with maybe four or five candidates then they'll decide who they want and then they'll ring all the candidates up that even and tell them whether or not they've give the job that's generally what happen
S0109	things move quickly in the teach world
S0052	yeah which be why if you apply for a job where they decide not to bother do it in that way mix make it all a bite
S0109	and when do you have to let your school know that you don't want to to renew your job then
S0052	eh so if i've sign my new contract easter because i didn't not till the end of july cos my contract say i have to give one month's notice at the moment which be rather nice
S0109	no wonder they want to tighten up on you
S0052	well it's a pretty dumb dumb idea in the isn't it well i think they should have make it half a term cos that's what state school be so in state school you have to give you can only leave at the end of the term and you have to give your notice by half term
S0109	okay
S0052	in order to leave at the end so there be only three time you can leave but well i suppose
S0109	and be they change the the rule about things like that they can make you leave at at a shorter notice now
S0052	oh i don't know what in general or just in teach
S0109	just in teach cos i i don't know i just hear something on the news about it be too difficult to get rid of bad teachers so they've decide to make it i don't know whether they follow that through or whether that be just a think
S0052	no i don't know it be really hard to get rid of teachers could you possibly help me do this
S0109	sure
S0052	i want to get this into here but it's so heavy you see if i be to hold it would you be able to scrape it in
S0109	eh a spatula back okay
S0052	this when i realise it's way more food than i need
S0109	well you're hungry because you didn't have much lunch
S0052	yeah i can have two dinners i think i can have two dinners
S0109	one and a half maybe eh be it
S0052	thank you lovely
S0052	i feel like thirteen meals at a cost of i think it be under twenty pound be quite good
S0109	mm
S0052	i suppose that's without the pasta but that's quite cheap and the cheese what
S0109	and the tuna
S0052	have i tell you about my drink less
S0109	no drink less
S0052	yeah
S0109	no
S0052	i've decide to try and drink less
S0109	but that's a bad thing
S0052	mm it depend on how much you're drink to start with so i get paranoid that i'm go to get a headache if i don't drink and it turn out i be actually drink quite a lot each day
S0109	well you're quite tall
S0052	do that make any difference
S0109	well
S0052	so i'm now drink less and i'll probably i'm still drink so i didn't drink very much when i be like a child i think
S0109	so you're make up for it
S0052	and then i start drink load and now i just start cos i cos i so i be drink lot in a like paranoid i'm go to get a headache way but then still have headaches so it's clearly not through dehydration so i cut down on my ridiculous drink
S0109	how much do you drink a day then
S0052	about i don't know three litres maybe but i have a lot and now i'm have about two litres a day which i think be more normal
S0109	yeah you're mean to drink two litres a day but it's not all mean to necessarily come from
S0052	you're mean to drink two litres
S0109	two litres
S0052	yeah
S0109	but it doesn't all have to come from drink
S0052	yeah i think i'm now draw drink like the right amount rather than a ridiculously large amount like i be drink because i can't you know these big glass
S0109	yeah
S0052	i have like well i drink a litre i drink a litre at school and then i drink one of them in the morning and like maybe three in the even so i'm still drink one in the morning and a litre at school i'm just have less in the even
S0109	that's probably sensible
S0052	yeah cos also i go to the toilet every night and that's quite annoy
S0109	and then you complain that you can't sleep
S0052	yeah i know so just like part of my like you know improve my life in crazy ways
S0109	i really hope my chicken curry doesn't overflow onto my cake cos that would be
S0052	oh be it on top
S0109	yeah
S0052	mm that would be unfortunate
S0109	well cos i'm i know that if i don't put the curry on top i'll be paranoid that it hasn't cook properly
S0052	where be you mean to cook cake in the oven
S0109	on at the top
S0052	at the top
S0109	yeah
S0052	i think so
S0109	yeah
S0052	cos i have a cake in the oven the other day oh it be that weird crazy it wasn't really a cake it be like my eve's pudding so it be like cake on top of fruit eh and then it wasn't really cook properly basically just go weird but i think it's cos i just put too much in it be all just a big mess eh and then nadia be like oh cos it's at the top of the oven i be like what it's mean to be at the top of the oven well i mean it wasn't the top it be sort of in the in it be take up like the entire oven cos i cook it in that big deep dish which be probably the problem it be too big a dish for one thing but yeah that make me then go i think cake be mean to be cook at the top
S0109	i guess it depend on the type of oven if it's a fan assist oven then you don't need to put it at the top theoretically although it seem to be not the case for my mum's
S0052	oh i see
S0109	although i do have this sort of habit if one thing work well once i just try and repeat it rather than actually work out why it be that work
S0052	yeah well you might as well oh it's nearly six o'clock it's very acceptable to be eat dinner at six o'clock
S0109	yeah especially as you're not mean to eat carbs after five
S0052	really say who
S0109	eh dieticians
S0052	that that's silly
S0109	that's silly cos if you if you don't then you don't sleep very well
S0052	you don't eat carbs after five
S0109	yeah
S0052	cos you're hungry you mean
S0109	well yeah
S0052	mm
S0109	i guess
S0052	be you sure that every dietician say that
S0109	every single one
S0052	i mean like it's not just some weird ones
S0109	i think generally the the idea be that you have a huge breakfast and eh with lot of carbs and then a medium size lunch with lot of mm sort of that sort of stuff energy stuff and then by the even you're not do very much so
S0052	mm
S0109	unless you're go out to play badminton in which case you probably can get away with it
S0052	you don't have time at lunch to eat lot of food i don't
S0109	ah you do if you're french
S0052	i have a two hour lunch break
S0109	except all the teachers tend to have wine in their lunch break and then go back to lessons
S0052	do they actually
S0109	no yeah
S0052	okay
S0109	the school i be in it be free so there be free wine with the
S0052	that's good
S0109	the staff canteen so all the teachers would have a bite and apparently we only have one teacher who have a problem with it
S0052	mm so they would they have like one glass
S0109	yeah a small glass obviously they wouldn't have much
S0052	every day
S0109	well as the mood take them
S0052	that's quite a different attitude isn't it
S0109	yeah
S0052	do the kid go home at lunch in france
S0109	they can do yeah it's like if they want to quite a lot of the kid i teach have em they didn't actually get a lunch break cos they be do extra class or something crazy
S0052	oh what for two hours
S0109	yeah cos that be the only place they could sort of schedule it in timetabling maybe
S0052	oh what time do they finish in the even
S0109	so they start at eight and finish at six
S0052	six
S0109	yeah
S0052	and then have homework on top of that
S0109	but you wouldn't always have like some of the time you wouldn't have a a lesson as such you'd have like a homework class
S0052	like time to do your homework
S0109	yeah so you're supervise
S0052	mm what kind of school be it
S0109	it be a private school for em i don't really it run the whole way so from preschool through to
S0052	oh right
S0109	sort of university entrance exams
S0052	yeah
S0109	huge
S0052	do the preschool have a two hour lunch break
S0109	no the preschool i wasn't i don't know what their timetable be like at all
S0052	okay be that cos it be an independent school or private school
S0109	which bite
S0052	end at six
S0109	em i i think generally they tend to have quite long school days cos they don't in the state school as well cos they don't do wednesday afternoons and they don't do saturday they do saturday mornings but not
S0052	they all do saturday morning
S0109	so once you get to i think it's secondary school you start do saturday mornings but before all that you probably don't do wednesdays at all no
S0052	mm hm
S0109	it's quite good logic cos like it stop the kid get really tire but do em have a weekend
S0052	yeah so would they have to do saturday morning
S0109	yeah they wouldn't ever do saturday afternoon
S0052	and would they do wednesday morning
S0109	which age
S0052	the older
S0109	yeah they wednesday morning unless they have they want to have something like study time or sport in the afternoon
S0109	oh i've just
S0109	what vegetable go with curry
S0052	with curry
S0109	mm
S0052	em mm i don't know bean what kind of curry
S0109	korma actually it might help if i tell you what i've get cos
S0052	yeah okay it's quite a small selection be it
S0109	yeah
S0052	go on then
S0109	carrots peas broccoli eh
S0052	peas the most out of them
S0109	peas okay well that's nice and simple
S0109	mm
S0052	i'm full up now
S0109	that's the idea
S0109	i might do a
S0052	it probably doesn't matter that it's not something an indian would have have
S0109	sorry
S0052	probably doesn't matter if it's not something in indian would've have
S0109	yeah well you see i've when i've cook it for other people before they give me funny look cos like
S0052	no well it's only for you be it
S0109	it be only for me
S0109	what be that
S0052	isn't it the hoover
S0109	oh
S0052	which i would assume be be use by rather than
S0109	that would be good wouldn't it
S0052	it would be quite amuse
S0109	i don't know what be go on last night but there be there be a police car it be go round and round and round the block
S0052	i be asleep or be i out
S0109	eh i don't know

S0052	about what
S0109	this estate
S0052	oh it's eh mostly our two neighbour down you know and her family who partly live across the way
S0109	the they're the trouble causers

S0109	as you do yeah
S0052	yeah so i go to get it it be obviously it be someone i didn't know cos it be so far away em and she be tell me about we be talk about neighbourhood and she's live here for age so she be tell me about all of them that live two doors down and she say that she her ex husband use to live across the green and they'd have big arguments like on the street and now like she live there and her sons live across the green and sometimes her daughter who have a baby live with her and it sound like they seem to cause most of the trouble in you know between that large family
S0109	right
S0052	from what she be say
S0109	it sound a bite claustrophobic
S0052	like she be say oh you know the police often round there i be like oh i do know the police come here sometimes i didn't know it be all for the family
S0109	but i don't know it's wouldn't you want to move out what's so

S0109	i be just like
S0052	yeah
S0109	i wouldn't want to do that anywhere but in the library where everyone else be be quiet
S0052	and also it's just rude in the library isn't it
S0109	yeah although if a text rather than this library thing it's a little less disturb ooh what's that little
S0052	i think it be one and a half
S0109	yeah i hope so
S0052	how many children will tell me tomorrow that i wasn't there last week they have a habit of point out the obvious you weren't here last week oh really
S0109	wasn't i i think i be eh mm what do you do with him this week
