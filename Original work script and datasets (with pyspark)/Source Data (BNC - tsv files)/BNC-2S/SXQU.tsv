S0189	so when we cook be this from memory
S0192	yeah this be actually a recipe i just make up
S0189	oh
S0192	and i normally do it with lamb and but we have beef so and i don't normally do mash potatoes stuff pepper but there's potatoes and there's pepper so consider do it with rice but then i have to buy rice and we've already get potatoes
S0189	when i do potatoes with curry for like the customer i get lazy with peel them if they're small potatoes
S0192	yeah
S0189	cut them and boil them
S0192	it's a bite of a pain in the bum
S0189	be it that bad and then with the skin on them
S0192	erm depend on what you're eat if i just have mash potato i'd actually prefer it with skin on it but not all of the skin i'd probably cut off like half of the skin and then when i mash it it's get the skin in it it's good it's get more flavour and then the more nutrients be usually in the skin
S0189	yeah but surely it's like a darker colour
S0192	yeah well like what i'm make today i probably i don't want to leave any of the skin and the mash potato i'm go to make with erm ginger and red onions and erm maybe a bite of nutmeg
S0189	sound good ah
S0192	i like these bowl
S0189	ah
S0192	they're really nice
S0189	i don't actually like those ones that much this be my favourite
S0192	because they're difficult to clean
S0189	yeah i like these ones
S0192	which ones
S0189	these big ones
S0192	ah yeah they're cool nice how mum would always leave this terrible pan
S0189	yeah i know
S0192	i guess they cook last night we should've wash up oh you do wash up you leave it
S0189	huh
S0192	you wash up last night didn't you so i guess you leave it
S0189	ah yeah i leave that one in the sink soak
S0192	it doesn't soak
S0189	yeah
S0192	i never really wash up at home
S0189	do do the wash up
S0192	do it
S0189	oh do you dry or do you just leave it drain
S0192	we just leave it drain i'd rather cook or do something else
S0189	cooking's more interest
S0192	erm i do wash up though i mean quite often as well i'm cook when 's not around and then i if i have to wash up things as i go along so although she claim that i never do any wash up that's actually a lie i do a bite of wash up just not the same as she do
S0189	yeah
S0192	but then she never cook
S0189	do she never cook
S0192	no not really she's cook on occasion when she have like want to she's want to do something special for everyone but
S0189	so she know how to cook
S0192	yeah
S0189	she just choose not
S0192	and i mean say she never cook be a lie because she always cook with me she's like chef
S0189	yeah
S0192	i'm in charge of like well i just go along with the recipe i know what's go on but i just tell her what to do you know
S0189	oh
S0192	she's good at make she's good at bake and she like make the bread and stuff do you get on with her
S0189	with
S0192	yeah
S0189	yeah she's cool like whenever you weren't around and we be together we we'd chat
S0192	you get along
S0189	yeah
S0189	she's a nice girl
S0192	this be just a pain in the arse this
S0189	you should use the metal
S0192	yeah i be use it i think i'm just go to leave that for now and have another go another day
S0189	it's go to need do though eventually
S0192	oh this thing
S0189	yes so when you're in and you go in to the gym like what be your routine to build muscle
S0192	say i didn't really put on much muscle
S0189	no you you do because when you leave you be kind of skinny and then you come back and you be quite buff
S0192	yeah
S0189	and then you go travel erm to india or no it be to
S0192	it's the last time i come back i be kind of muscly
S0189	no the last time when you come back from erm america south america you be
S0192	but now i'm more muscular
S0189	well also yeah
S0192	i can't get much bigger it's kind of sad doesn't matter how much i work out this be just about as big as i get i don't eat protein shake or anything i don't i guess i just eat more probably this be just my natural build
S0189	yeah
S0192	but like when we're travel a lot i wasn't really eat that much and i be do a lot of exercise so that be probably not a natural
S0189	yeah so like how much exercise be you do
S0192	right the the last year or two
S0189	just like when you be in your peak
S0192	four to five hours a week
S0189	that's quite a lot
S0192	erm
S0189	be that ah every day or every other day
S0192	i try to do weekdays and i do an hour a day
S0189	yeah
S0192	erm but i mean at my peak it could have be more because and i would go in the last year not the most recent year but the year before we be go hike every other weekend and when you go hike you're do like six hours of exercise like in one go
S0189	yeah
S0192	it's not as strenuous as like you know weight or something but it's not it's not too easy so i don't know but on average i'd say four to five hours a week probably go run once or twice or hike and then go to the gym a couple of time
S0189	so you do ah free weight at the gym
S0192	yeah
S0189	that's what i need to do i've get to sign up to a gym at uni ah if i sign up before i go it's like ten percent cheaper
S0192	ah it's cheap anyway isn't it
S0189	it's not that cheap it's cheap compare to like a
S0192	the one in be cheap i know it be like a hundred and eighty pound for the whole year or something
S0189	yeah it's about the same
S0192	that's well cheap
S0189	it be cheap
S0192	i mean it's less than a pound a day
S0189	yeah consider
S0192	it's still a hundred and eighty quid but
S0189	yeah
S0192	i mean even if you go twice a week how much would that cost you to go twice a week it's like fifty pence a go or something isn't it
S0189	yeah
S0192	no no no sorry
S0189	no it would be more
S0192	fifty two weeks so fifty two go into a hundred and eighty about three and a half time
S0189	uhu it's still cheap if i ah go to the gym and i'm go to want to go quite often
S0192	but you're not go to be there all the weeks be you how close be the gym to where you're live
S0189	ah i don't know er i'd imagine it's near the area because that's where the all the sport be
S0192	yeah worth find out
S0189	yeah
S0192	for sure
S0189	erm
S0192	right so the first thing we need to do be get the bread
S0189	be we go to need a saucepan
S0192	we're go to need a whole bunch of things but not immediately do you want to help me with the bread
S0189	yeah sure
S0192	could've make breadcrumbs because we're go to make meatballs so do you ever make meatballs
S0189	nah i didn't
S0192	or burgers or anything have you ever make a burger
S0189	ah maybe once
S0192	it's the same kind of thing really so we want some crusty bread the bread i buy the cheapest stalest look bread so that's what you want and then i'm go to put some erm on top of the mash potato as well
S0189	okay
S0192	with the breadcrumbs that will probably be enough give me one more slice i don't like that wooden chop board
S0189	why
S0192	i feel like it the germs kind of stay on it
S0189	yeah i don't actually chop on this do you know
S0192	i mean i'll use it i haven't get a problem
S0189	say that i don't actually
S0192	oh its powerful they be too small aren't they i just think they need a better chop board i don't see the problem with chop on this surface how good be this blade this food processor
S0189	it's good enough
S0192	it's quite small though isn't it
S0189	yeah
S0192	sure we're go to have to do it in stag alright first things first do you want to help me de crust be there a bowl as well where's like a big bowl
S0189	i'll take all the breadcrumbs
S0192	may need to bigger than that
S0189	really
S0192	do you want to help me de crust
S0189	yeah sure
S0192	so just take the crust off of these
S0189	so we're only want the crust
S0192	no we don't want the crust
S0189	oh why do you buy crusty bread then
S0192	i mean can you buy a loaf of bread without the crust
S0189	you can
S0192	that
S0189	they sell it they just chop the crust off
S0192	ah never see it
S0189	ah
S0192	never hear of it
S0189	i'm pretty sure that hovis and all them do that
S0192	ah that this be like forty pence or something i've be quite impress since i've come home about how cheap the food be it's not cheap cheap but like you go in lilds it's pretty cheap compare to
S0189	where be we put have we get to break up this
S0192	yeah
S0189	i'm just joke with you well the thing be you're go top
S0192	this be some shitty bread
S0189	yeah
S0189	this one's really dry
S0192	it should be dry a loaf of bread you don't want it to be ah you don't want it to be like nice
S0189	yeah the problem with cheap bread be that they make it very very quickly so it hasn't actually it's not really bread
S0192	no
S0189	in a traditional sense
S0192	what's the traditional sense
S0189	well i think like they use enzymes to partially break down the bread so it's easier to digest
S0192	oh ok
S0189	but these be really manufacture and just not good
S0192	i try not to eat much bread
S0189	yeah me too
S0192	in general i never and i never buy a loaf of bread in really we'd eat tortillas a bite though a little bite
S0189	mm
S0192	i prefer corn tortillas though
S0192	what's so funny
S0192	they're tasty
S0189	when you're complain about that i know that wasn't oh yeah that be corn
S0192	what
S0189	the the crap we've get in the freezer
S0192	no that's quorn with a q q u o r n it's like some weird i'm not even sure what that be
S0189	ah ok
S0192	corn as in like corn you know maize they use it to there's something wrong here
S0192	erm okay so we get the breadcrumbs
S0189	yeah
S0192	now what i normally do with these be make a bunch like i've just do now it's just too much and then i freeze it so i put in in a bag
S0189	mm
S0192	so then i just take a handful and then i leave it
S0189	mm
S0192	do you know what i mean
S0189	that keep for a while
S0192	yeah i mean once you've freeze it it will keep for six months
S0189	you could use it quicker than that
S0192	right cool a lot of breadcrumbs should we quickly clean this side just wipe this shit off
S0189	what be you go to do if you submit your record and they're like ah actually this one have swear in it we can't take it
S0192	can't accept it
S0192	ah shit but it's just a word isn't it linguists aren't particular about the word that they use

S0192	it's a terrible life skill not to not to teach you
S0189	it's cos they couldn't cook
S0192	yeah
S0189	plain and simply
S0192	if you can't cook how be you gonna cook someone else teach someone else to cook
S0189	exactly
S0192	you can't
S0189	that's why we never learn ambition from them
S0192	no mum say the other day she be a bite upset you kind of have a talk with her in the car or something
S0189	yeah
S0192	what be that all about tell her she be a bad parent or something
S0189	no i wasn't say that i be just say like how do i go into it erm
S0192	well don't talk about it if you don't want to
S0189	we be have a discussion like about childhood and and things like that
S0192	yeah
S0189	and i be say to her how like she never teach me to cook or er because she be never ambitious like we didn't really get push to be ambitious either
S0192	no
S0189	and like i be like well you can't really teach kid things that you yourself do not possess and i suppose i be just have a bite of a moan about my childhood
S0192	yeah
S0189	or whatever cos er we have a lot of shit
S0192	we have a lot of good things as well though
S0189	we have some good things yeah
S0192	i mean we do up until the divorce like mum try hard she do she may have do some things wrong but she try hard every time
S0189	yeah
S0192	so no you can't say that she didn't try
S0189	i know she i'm pretty sure that she always do what she think be best
S0192	mm but like erm what you be talk about with be ambitious i'm actually glad personally that our parent didn't push us too much because i have friends now that they don't really have a very adult relationship with their parent because they still treat their parent like parent because their parent have always be in possession of them and they've always tell them what to do and all that kind of thing
S0189	mm
S0192	whereas like i dunno and i have never felt any pressure so whatever we do they're proud of us whatever we achieve we've do well
S0192	mm
S0189	so it can go both ways i don't know
S0192	just obviously obviously you can tell your mum how you feel obviously but just remember that she'll carry that
S0189	yeah
S0192	she'll remember it
S0189	but the thing be like through a lot of my childhood i be depress
S0192	yeah
S0189	like after they'd split up and i didn't really have a good time
S0192	i mean you say a lot of your childhood but they split up when you be thirteen or twelve
S0189	yeah
S0192	you be a man by the time you be eighteen so
S0189	yeah i know by the time i be eighteen i be okay but like through school after that
S0192	yeah
S0189	like things go bad and then they never really get better but i'm sure like a lot of that be through my own choices and decisions
S0192	yeah well it's a combination isn't it but i mean you definitely become more introvert once they split up
S0189	yeah
S0192	but now you're out the other side now and you just have to be please that you come out the other side
S0189	yeah
S0192	you're okay cos it could've erm could've be worse
S0189	it take me time like
S0192	yeah
S0189	for me to get my shit together
S0192	but that's alright everyone do things at slightly different age i be lucky i personally at the time it happen i could've go one of two ways i could've just spiral out be some fuck up in pretty much
S0189	yeah
S0192	erm but thankfully i didn't i go to uni and it help quite a bite right
S0189	it's just i didn't have any direction
S0192	yeah i know but that be your own fault to a certain degree
S0189	yeah
S0192	in the west it's up to us isn't it the parent can't tell you what to do and i'm sure if mum have tell you and the thing be mum do try and and encourage you plenty you forget of all the club that mum try to sign you up to and all the things that she try to do to get you out of your room you can't just blame her for that you didn't want to and you didn't want to come out
S0189	yeah
S0192	you be addict to the computers it's an addiction no one blame you for that because you use it as a crutch i to things as we all know
S0189	where's the erm where's the can opener
S0192	it should be in that drawer there i don't know can you use this this doesn't look like a normal can opener
S0189	you have to open it
S0192	what a retard do she get upset
S0189	a little bite
S0192	yeah i mean don't worry about it i've say some horrible things over the years so problem be one thing i've learn you can't really take that back and they do remember it but it's fair to say how you feel but just bear in mind that how you feel be also your perception and she have her perception
S0189	yeah
S0192	do bother me that she seem to be make some of the same mistake with he watch too much tv for my like and eat too many too much sugar
S0189	they try and control it like
S0192	yeah i know they do
S0189	like what they do there be a lot better nothing but sugar
S0192	no it's crap it's really bad actually i'm not the biggest fan of the way she kind of live her life you think she'll have any more children
S0189	probably i hope not but
S0192	hope they don't like divorce or anything that's just go to be another wreck family it's not on but what can you do
S0189	you can't do anything
S0192	it's people's life to live isn't it
S0189	people's mistake to make
S0192	yeah and they'll keep make them that's smell good it's healthy hearty have you decide if you're go to kickboxing or not
S0189	yeah i will do
S0192	what time be you be you go to eat then when you get back
S0189	might just have a snack first depend what time you want to eat

S0192	yeah if you're not
S0189	i can peel some mushroom and eh
S0192	ah shit you put mushroom in it
S0189	do you not like mushroom
S0192	no i'll pick around them
S0189	well i'll put them away then
S0192	i mean most no no put them in most of this be yours anyway i'll just have if you could spare maybe a quarter or a third
S0189	yeah sure
S0192	say that i do have a sausage sandwich but it be a while ago do you have anything for breakfast
S0189	i've have two bananas today that's it
S0189	yeah
S0192	so with this sauce now i'm just go to add in raw tomato and blend it in with the onion and raw garlic stuff like that i mean if you just give me another chop board i could clean or whatever onions ever make your eye water
S0189	oh yeah definitely
S0192	badly
S0189	never badly but it's unpleasant
S0192	isn't quite
S0189	you don't like mushroom at all do you
S0192	no but that's fine i mean if you can leave them bigger so i can quickly pick them out i mean i get around mushroom all the time but if if you like make them really small
S0192	i can eat them but i don't i just choose not to depend on the mushroom some be less pungent than others
S0192	you can do it quarter that's fine it's still fairly big but it's a quarter isn't it just don't like douse it
S0189	these need use or they're go to go off because i don't think you're go to use them
S0192	no never go to happen do you ever see those ones in they're like the long thin white ones come in a big bunch
S0189	i saw the mushroom that be kind of like jellyfish
S0192	oh yeah they've get so many different type there actually
S0189	mm
S0192	kind of ridiculous so do you reckon the summer's come to an end
S0189	we seem to be lucky with the weather today but i think summer's almost over

S0192	not terrible
S0189	no
S0192	oh this be one thing i don't miss unpeeled garlic it's always peel in doesn't come in a in a cleave like this quite a great idea but i mean be there a machine that do that seem a bite difficult to peel garlic

S0192	yeah
S0189	that's go to be so bore

S0189	that's not too bad
S0192	no see as i mean it's like a five hour drive to so actually they should be there soon shouldn't they
S0189	yeah i think it would take a lot longer than that
