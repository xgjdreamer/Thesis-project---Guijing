S0058	there we be that's er
S0179	you don't always pay for fuel i occasionally refuel by myself
S0058	true yes but
S0179	whereas you never refuel without me
S0058	true true
S0179	wow
S0058	what's very excite
S0179	they're rather impose have three story house at the end of this road you know
S0058	be it a little bite it would be far nicer if there have just be erm
S0179	two stories
S0058	two stories yeah
S0179	oh can you see the coach house and if you look back down that way it's almost finish
S0058	oh
S0179	i think we should go in and look
S0058	it's an interest design it's get the erm
S0179	it's get it's get this one have get windows at the back as well the others haven't this have get a window in the kitchen and window
S0058	ah that's interest
S0179	that one be actually might be quite steel
S0058	yeah that's much better
S0179	it's freehold
S0058	that be much better so you all you get a garage presumably and the top windows at the back
S0179	you get a garage a park space erm and you have five windows not three
S0058	oh that's better
S0179	so there's still no window into the hallway but you get a window into the main bathroom and the
S0058	what be the other
S0179	and the kitchen
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	be you tempt
S0058	no but if we be buy again then that sound er
S0179	we wouldn't want to move away from and
S0058	ah it wouldn't be exactly miles away from them ah dear it wouldn't be worth get out all the box and pack up again
S0179	no er yeah think so that be just a highlight that i be actually go to be on that corner of the road
S0058	yeah
S0179	i don't clip a corner please
S0058	yeah
S0179	ugh
S0058	hmm ah nice one
S0179	mm
S0058	do you think i should buy that ipod today
S0179	yes
S0058	yeah it'll be it be
S0179	that jacket please
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	erm i do that while i be out at bank erm yeah so a hundred pound net cost which you know in all fairness when i ring to say about that mark and spencer's just have this extend guarantee be there anything you can do she say well we do only have a one year guarantee but you know if anything happen after that we would of course you know give you customer service and try and help you and you know which be an a nice response
S0179	mm
S0058	erm and i think it's true i think if you go in and there be some kind of issue they would do their best but of course they just couldn't they can't give you unlimited
S0179	mm
S0058	warrantee cos it's not quite the same thing erm but yeah i mean er they probably have improve them a lot since my my first one so
S0179	well we know that
S0058	well er i mean i guess they've have to
S0179	yeah
S0058	they can't habitually break after a year any more
S0179	no
S0058	because you'd never
S0179	they never use to
S0058	i hear some bad stories maybe it be my particular one be a have a particularly bad erm cos it have like a disk like in sort of word cos there be a sort of rotate part
S0179	erm hang on two things firstly can you pick my water bottle up floor which be really annoy and secondly you mean it be a hard drive not a flash drive
S0058	yeah
S0179	yes
S0058	erm which i mean possibly be there be more bits to break and more bits to overheat and
S0179	yes much actually an interest question i'm not sure if it use hard or flash i assume flash
S0058	i assume so you mean the new classic
S0179	yeah
S0058	interest to ask it's not something i've ever particularly look at
S0179	i'm pretty sure it must be
S0058	it must be surely why would you have a hard disk like erm
S0179	because it store er much more mature technology would cooperate
S0058	huh mm well yeah i'm sure it'll be fine
S0179	well someone's keen
S0058	ha ha they look quite intrepid don't they
S0179	yeah
S0058	go for a walk around the area which we should do at some point
S0179	possibly i think there's just more interest place to walk
S0058	i know it's just if we're not particularly do anything it's just a very kind of it's a way of do a walk without much you know we wouldn't have to drive very far
S0179	but when be we not particularly do something
S0058	no true
S0179	if we ever become bore yes
S0058	ha yeah maybe unlikely
S0179	actually i'll give a ring when we're in town cos he might like a lift out if he's go to see his friend first
S0058	oh right oh be he ah
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah true actually if he's sort of leave anyway then er
S0179	yeah
S0058	be he gonna drive through though so he have his car all through the night
S0179	well he doesn't have a car so
S0058	i could have swear dan have a car okay good that's fine then huh why do i think dan have a car
S0179	cos his friend have a car
S0058	no no i just
S0179	well he might do i don't think he do
S0058	no no maybe not um i'm i'm not sure why i think that i just kind of assume maybe it's just erm associate with engineer cos and both have cars and you obviously ha
S0179	yes well
S0058	no car be he get erm the bus out do you think
S0179	i've no idea but
S0058	yes um he might choose to cycle but he's a long way from where he
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah well anyway either way yeah give him a ring on oh there's the other thing you be go to look for in john louis be gloves
S0179	actually i could look in another sport shop
S0058	yeah well sport direct be very close to john louis
S0179	yeah
S0058	which do you know i know you'll hate be in there but it do brand stuff at non brand price hurray
S0179	yes but they also buy the newcastle stadium oh yeah cos
S0058	yeah we like that we wanna support sport direct as far as possible it's really funny oh my god
S0179	it be quite funny
S0058	but they're just such an embarrassment to themselves it be like when they be do really badly and they release their new away strip which be yellow and orange strip and you're like you're not do yourself any favour you know a nice blood red or a a deep green or something yeah fair enough ha but no
S0179	right erm it might be worth hold it
S0058	okay
S0179	just cos it's they might say it's only only vibration from the seat
S0058	fair enough
S0179	okay
S0058	oh
S0179	i say hold not drop
S0058	ha oh no it it be the water that be drop
S0179	okay
S0058	ah ha ha you do like this song
S0179	yep
S0058	a bite too much ha ha
S0179	i look forward to tomorrow
S0058	yeah it should be fun
S0179	er it might be dry actually
S0058	erm yeah so ha so when we go to morrison's we'll erm
S0179	get stuff for lunch as well
S0058	get stuff for lunch yeah which i be think about just make erm a load of different roll so we'll get a load of ham and a load of tuna erm do that sound good
S0179	i like cheese and sweet apple
S0058	cheese be good yeah yeah i be think about just make a variety
S0179	mm
S0058	a few of each you know and and a few bar of chocolate
S0179	oh yeah nice
S0058	and some apples we could buy apples
S0179	yeah that's good and some crisp as well
S0058	we've get crisp so we don't need to buy those
S0179	oh yeah true
S0058	so we've get load of bag of crisp actually so that will be a really good way of use them up cos we don't eat them very quickly so yeah erm a few bag of crisp we might wanna buy a a a pack of bottle water cos we don't have enough for everyone
S0179	oh i've get a flask which be a canteen so
S0058	oh okay fair enough
S0179	which be what i'll be plan on use
S0058	cos then we don't yeah we don't have very many bottle at all so i don't know if that'll be enough for everyone but
S0179	well i've get two er more i've get two and each one be equal to four small bottle of water
S0058	okay fair enough yeah
S0179	which bring us to well over ten bottle
S0058	that should be fine yeah and we're not exactly in the wilderness
S0179	er well you say that but we're still go prepare as if we be so you've get all of your survival kit yeah
S0058	erm my survival kit i've get my blanket whistle and compass yeah
S0179	blanket whistle and compass yeah
S0058	next week one lunchtime i'm gonna go down and try and find something for heather erm my dad suggest
S0179	oh for a birthday present
S0058	my dad suggest something
S0179	when's her birthday
S0058	wednesday when she's here
S0179	wednesday circuit
S0058	circuit yeah i be think we could maybe cook some
S0179	and will a big shout out to the birthday girl
S0058	yep erm i mean at work
S0179	we need to get her induction sort
S0058	well i be wonder actually whether it would just make more sense to do it on monday we can do a session and she can have an induction because i'm not sure if she's gonna feel like do that after i mean i can talk to her about it
S0179	well she can the induction weren't take very long she can stay out it just seem to be better value for money if she's stay for an induction to get it as early then she can have it
S0058	well i mean i don't think she'll particularly do you know what i mean i don't think she'd really miss out on i dunno erm i'll i'll have a chat to her about it
S0179	okay
S0058	i don't think i mean you know if she just doesn't go on sunday it's pointless just book it for her whereas if she might wanna get it out of the way so
S0179	well we'll see when they can do it because
S0058	yeah true we can ask today about when they can fit it in and then
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah no i mention this erm someone ask how old she be and i say well she's actually twenty two on the wednesday that she's here and they all go oh bless and i say yeah i'm gonna have to work on her birthday you know erm so they they say you know great can we have some cake it's a great excuse and erm and they're gonna get a card and sign it as well which be very sweet
S0179	this be really give a bad impression of the world of work
S0058	it's pretty much what publish be like ha every department have
S0179	it's pretty much what your of publish be like
S0058	well no in all fairness bloomsberry be exactly the same there be cake for during the two weeks i be there and celebrations i think there be two different cake events i think it's a fairly standard thing
S0179	no
S0058	erm oh yeah so i meet somebody erm yesterday who use to work at cup as an admin assistant
S0179	yeah
S0058	and erm she actually get another job at cup
S0179	yeah
S0058	but she be she be apply for job everywhere and she apply for one at bloomsbury get the one at cup accept it but then get the one at bloomsbury
S0179	yeah
S0058	so that they they obviously prefer that one i say obviously she prefer that one it must have be a better job and erm
S0179	and that would be quite good hand in your notice before you start
S0058	yeah that's what she do yeah exactly she er never really start it and erm so now she's work in bloomsbury i say oh well you know i've be in bloomsbury for a couple of weeks um and they've move out of the old build the out the er that i do work experience in it be really nice
S0179	interestingly there erm that be an example of er safety override legality so i want to drop to a safety gear
S0058	yeah
S0179	but i in do so i go over the speed limit
S0058	right
S0179	erm cos i be break down in forth and i want to actively be in third so i don't want it clutch into third but the erm acceleration impart there in take me slightly over the limit
S0058	mm but it be safer to do that
S0179	yes
S0058	and not do that yep
S0179	so if people perpetually ask but how can it be safe to brake how would you well how would you ever justify break the law in the interest of safety you just really haven't think about it have you
S0058	well i'd just say it's a i be gonna say i'd er that's pretty straight forward i'd say to that
S0179	mm
S0058	um anyway yeah so um bloomsbury have erm move from their old premise
S0179	oh right
S0058	which i be quite sad about but she seem to like it and say everyone be really nice erm she's in digital base so it's completely different to what i be in ha
S0179	well if you want to work at bloomsbury like the easiest way for you to do it
S0058	come to work with you so
S0179	oh
S0058	sorry
S0179	yeah the problem be that there's no fast train
S0058	ah that be true
S0179	you'd go much quicker from
S0058	yeah
S0179	which i could detour by to
S0058	well no but it seem daft that you drop me off but i could can i bus to
S0179	well that's doable erm what i be actually gonna say be
S0058	mm
S0179	because go into you end that that'd be a nightmare
S0058	that's a nightmare that's not yeah
S0179	what you should do be er go and stay with my parent during the week
S0058	that'll be interest yeah it would be even yeah it'd be good er the alternative be bus to which be perfectly possible
S0179	er traffic morning really
S0058	well you'd have to leave so early that
S0179	well no it's just as bad as er get into i'm not sure where the bus go to in i'm not aware that there's a station particularly
S0058	mm i think actually i think they do go close to i remember there be a little rail sign on the erm on the timetable there might not be
S0179	well actually what you should do be learn to drive
S0058	well i don't know how much park at ' station would cost
S0179	get there earlier
S0058	i'm sure you could find somewhere to yeah of course i'm not work at bloomsbury's so haha i don't have any particular
S0179	well actually that would only get you to kings cross at which point you're gonna have to get across london
S0058	across london yeah it's not i i i i could she say it's just round the corner from where it's use to be which be a fair old step from
S0179	yep
S0058	from erm so it be a you know it be a bus ride away erm you could walk it but it be much easier to get the bus you could get the tube but i really wasn't keen on that
S0179	where be i drive to
S0058	the centre
S0179	good right it just occur to me i i just blank out where we be go
S0058	yeah haha
S0179	er i'll give my dad a call this afternoon
S0058	i be gonna give my dad a quick ring as well and just see how my grandpa be
S0179	oh yes
S0058	erm
S0179	have you tell him yet
S0058	about the er nose thing
S0179	yeah
S0058	i haven't no i be gonna sort of tell him you know sort of on the boat so i'll erm i'll tell him that as well
S0179	that be a cool look house
S0058	classic it's really cool isn't it i love all the ivy
S0179	they need to get some better cars
S0058	yeah
S0179	i can't believe those things be still road legal
S0058	ha ha yeah
S0179	they use to be cool flats
S0058	three belt i'm assume kind of weird look thing outside but i can bet they be pretty cool inside might be a bite old and tiny but it's hard to know could either be really nice or a little bite tatty
S0179	mm
S0058	busy isn't it
S0179	little bite yeah
S0058	i wonder if there's just some kind of hold up it's not normally like this
S0179	just a bite to
S0058	well if this be the queue to get into the centre then it just seem odd like it's never like this be it
S0179	yeah
S0058	be it oh
S0179	cos it take what ten minutes to walk from and i think that might be faster
S0058	if yeah if we're block up back to here then yeah if these be all basically go to the car park mm yeah it's a green light out don't know if it's be hold up at the light but
S0179	no er it's red actually
S0058	alright well this one's green but the one ahead be
S0179	yeah well that's just a pedestrian cross
S0058	okay what do you reckon think would be quicker
S0179	just for sheer density of traffic
S0058	yeah
S0179	cos even if they start road we should still be closer to them
S0058	yeah no definitely yeah if everyone's go they must be go into the centre and hence they must be go to the car park
S0179	just after lunch rainy day they're go into
S0058	yeah fair enough okay well then
S0179	okay right we're go to
S0058	yeah blimey i've never don't remember see it like this
S0179	that's what i'm think there's pedestrian rout down there but no road short cut
S0058	i yeah i don't think you can get through
S0179	no you can't
S0058	just the yeah and the back they're come down past church hill as well gosh
S0179	yeah we're not go to the centre
S0058	we're not you know we're not jesus oh there we go yeah um what be i gonna say yeah and so my dad send me a couple of article um one be um a sort of debate they often have debate in the art section um and this one be um about morrissey um
S0179	what about how much of a tit he be
S0058	yeah well basically yeah be he what be it be he still a national treasure or something or be he a national treasure
S0179	he be ever a national treasure
S0058	um which be interest well it depend who you talk to i guess or well you know so it be something like that
S0179	national embarrassment
S0058	well yeah um so that i'm quite look forward to read that and the other one be about um the british library be be do a project um a like an oral history project so collect it's on coordinate conversation which be quite interest um it's
S0179	i love that fast into the city centre
S0058	yeah not so much
S0179	what be you say sorry
S0058	um yeah so so it's an oral history project um for the british library and they're get people to submit conversations on the website
S0179	mm
S0058	which be pretty interest and i do look into this actually i think look at some of the things in the
S0179	do you get pay
S0058	no it's look at some of the things in the past and we can't have access to it because it's from well ours be for commercial gain purely and simply um and they're the whole point of theirs be it's not for commercial gain
S0179	ooh that's arguable
S0058	well yeah
S0179	it's promote the profile of the which be go to get more visitors it might not directly be for commercial
S0058	yeah it it's for just kind of preserve storage of the
S0179	this have take us we've literarily come ten yards
S0058	that's it isn't it unless we've get another option yes
S0179	but i'm concern about get to as in
S0058	it should clear up a little bite now but that pedestrian cross just
S0179	we'll go to the bank first cos that will close
S0058	right
S0179	the pedestrian cross be now on red do the park and ride bus go down
S0058	no um
S0179	yes it do
S0179	i've have it certainly use to
S0058	possibly i'm not sure i can't honestly can't remember
S0179	i remember come in one day me and my mum come to i think we come on the train and we spend er the day just before we have a list of colleges and we just go and have a wonder round
S0058	yeah
S0179	like four or five colleges
S0058	that's nice
S0179	that be a nice day
S0058	hmm yeah i mean we do that when we be on holiday round here just have a little wonder round i really like actually and mainly cos i have dream of be on university challenge and be announce as which do sound good or erm
S0179	it be just
S0058	yeah erm
S0179	it'll be actually no i'm not good at pronunciation
S0058	erm
S0179	this be ridiculous
S0058	it be ridiculous okay well mental note ha
S0179	i'm also a little bite annoy about how much of this traffic to the leave be be let in
S0058	yeah
S0179	cos it's
S0058	the yeah it's that's move far faster than er
S0179	well admittedly there be less of it but on the other hand they can all wait for it
S0058	yeah people be just let them go yeah maybe be largely taxi drivers
S0179	yes
S0058	they be a bite mental in ah
S0179	i think it's better however have it yeah there be the
S0058	so they yeah so they
S0179	so ten cars back and we would sort of hadn't clear at all
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	so mm yeah drop that in the mix
S0058	yeah
S0179	right normally i'd say let in one person everyone let's in one under these circumstances that's a bite er
S0058	mm
S0179	yep we're go down here a little bite of creative drive and we nearly get there
S0058	yeah hmm
S0179	damn it oh jeez i would have get that if i have be a bite quicker
S0058	yes so i mean that's still snarl up that's clear so centrefold
S0179	yeah i'm actually um we'd have to thread right the way round into the centre we're not just all
S0058	yeah no it's a long way
S0179	right for anyone consider drive into centre don't
S0058	yeah basically handily have a learner there haha
S0179	this be a twenty speed limit and you're not quite make it okay
S0058	okay so that be a little bite early for a signal there as in that pink car
S0179	that be a drive school car cos it's get l plat on the side as well
S0058	mm
S0179	i'm sorry i can't be bother pure efficiency dictate go at a little bite faster than the speed limit
S0058	don't fancy play football in this weather play
S0179	yeah think so
S0058	wow two bus there be no uni on the weekend
S0179	oh what a shock
S0058	so that's a very late bus
S0179	jesus nearly take out another bike then honestly dog eat dog
S0058	what really annoy me oh you've get no idea how much this annoy me cos i cycle relatively you know i'm in the i'm i'm sort of faster than maybe two thirds of cyclists
S0179	right
S0058	but i obey the laws so i stop at red light i and you know et cetera et cetera
S0179	yeah
S0058	i don't just just go through red light i just wait at the stop line that kind of thing and erm so i when i cycle into town from work i leap frog people
S0179	yeah
S0058	and it's just massively annoy you know you they i i overtake them a two minutes later i stop at a red light they go past me at the red light
S0179	yeah
S0058	two minutes time i overtake them again i'm like just go faster and stop at red light like ar it really annoy me just a waste of my time
S0179	okay well we'll take anne's car park if it's quiet enough
S0058	yeah sure full of taxis ha
S0179	they in all fairness
S0058	mm
S0179	well i mean if have only be if i have only be twenty that would have be fine
S0058	haha well
S0179	be anne's car park free or
S0058	ooh it look fairly busy actually erm
S0179	let's go to then
S0058	yeah might be your best bet er yeah it's full
S0179	yeah crazy time
S0058	it be crazy
S0179	there be a very interest thing about priority there
S0058	what do you say
S0179	i say there be a very interest thing about priority at those um
S0058	i be look at the erm thing i wasn't so what what happen so you be turn right
S0179	hang on oh god it's a big ah
S0058	oh it's leave weekend that's why it's so busy right
S0179	yes right
S0058	that make sense i be gonna say
S0179	okay so
S0058	okay so good erm
S0179	see if we can find a space to be fair we could probably get in in kind of one of those garage
S0058	mm
S0179	damn it
S0058	haha nice try okay erm
S0179	that's perfect time believe me as well
S0058	didn't think about that yeah
S0179	ah oh
S0058	ah
S0179	where
S0058	no you say ah
S0179	the road at the back of anne's might do it
S0058	interest
S0179	it's gonna be open
S0058	cos not many people know about it or live in anne's
S0179	yeah but we don't wanna get block in there
S0058	no true
S0058	no but they would let you out like there's never not gonna be porter there but maybe a little bite risky
S0179	yeah but it excuse me sir what be you do park in there
S0058	yeah maybe a little bite push it mm right okay so erm i mean a few options we can either just try one of the roads round here
S0179	no that's not gonna work can't risk it
S0058	well that explain the horrendous traffic anyway
S0179	what
S0058	well it mean in future we can predict it basically
S0179	well i do have one idea what we could just do be go in front of those garage
S0058	i don't know what they're use for
S0179	think open
S0058	i assume they're not use for anything
S0179	yeah open
S0058	there's there's no no park laws or anything ah it's erm what's his face
S0179	what
S0179	oh small
S0058	yeah small erm president
S0179	oh right
S0058	be there any along here
S0179	no there weren't be ooh no no so we'll just go into centre see see just one of these oh no it's the double yellow line down here
S0058	oh yeah mm
S0179	see the annoy thing be there use to be a good park space
S0058	yeah classically i be gonna say it will be be full today anyway
S0179	okay so where be we gonna go
S0058	so we can either erm
S0179	just keep cruise
S0058	we could try the one in newnham
S0179	i'm not confident
S0058	a trek yeah erm be probably full
S0179	oh damn our trump card
S0058	yeah
S0179	i can try down there but i don't i'm not er
S0058	yeah i don't know how far the you know but you you know there might be space a little further up but it's hard to know erm
S0179	well alternative be we go out we go down go out and come into a road on the other side of where er that footpath come out
S0058	i think yeah we can just park on one of the roads round here the they they can't all be full with parent
S0179	do you understand where i mean
S0058	so so down there
S0179	no you know where the footpath at the end of this road
S0058	yeah
S0179	that go through into a house estate
S0058	yeah
S0179	park in that house estate
S0058	ah and footpath it back through
S0179	yes
S0058	seem like a good idea yeah cos that one that's so far away but i'm just mean like a little bite further down there's the roads
S0179	i'm just gonna move forward now cos there's some someone come up behind us what i should probably just get out of the way i don't think we're gonna find a space here anyway
S0058	no i and these people aren't gonna move them quickly as well it's the same so
S0179	yep can do
S0058	erm so
S0179	ah
S0058	do you see what i mean we could turn leave and go just down one of those streets but it's hard
S0179	we might just have be able to get in there but that's probably push it what street oh right
S0058	do you know what i mean just a street erm a little bite further away from any of the colleges
S0179	i'm not sure that we'd find any round there
S0058	mm possibly not i i don't know how big they be with just residents
S0179	probably fairly what about
S0058	what that way you mean
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah that yeah it might work probably a bite quieter as in i think there's lot of flats and stuff round there which do you wanna try that
S0179	yeah
S0058	i mean it might be a little bite a little bite closer than drive round to that house estate it's a fair step to get back
S0179	christ this be crazy
S0058	it's insane isn't it huh
S0179	there's just one space in there
S0058	be there ah right
S0179	i think let's just see if we can get in
S0058	haha
S0179	i've get a nag feel there might be just the one yes
S0058	oh nicely do
S0179	alright
S0058	and they're not you know it's a good weekend to park here cos they're not gonna be question the fact that there's cars everywhere we could even walk through
S0179	i fully intend to it's gonna take some shuffle to get in there but we can do it with a bite of creativity right what would be very useful if you could just watch out for pedestrians for me
S0058	yeah there's never mind
S0179	ah sweet well do me
S0058	that's good yeah nicely spot cool well do
