S0262	okay erm you know fine yeah give that a go
S0261	mm
S0262	and see
S0261	and and and that might not be directly connect to what we're try to do but but the mechanism of the things you learn in do that be certainly of value
S0262	alright
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm okay now you you really really really can't get upset when i say what i'm about to say to you okay you've just you've gotta understand i'm say it for the benefit of both of us i think in the marketplace you're worth a lot of money as what you use to do as er as a as a what do they call it a contractor yeah jesus a hundred and twenty fuck thousand dollars a year and that be as a pay member of staff i don't fuck know how much you cost as a freelance contractor engineer type person right shitloads of money shitloads of money you'd get your capital do something that you go fuck it it's a mean to an end and then you go thank you i've get fuck what i want for my money fuck off i'm just gonna go off and spend my capital
S0261	er yeah yeah erm that's that that's an interest point of view and of course that's quite obvious but erm i will take that on board and think about it and i'll leave it at that in context of where we're at right now yeah you've that's that's fine to say that but i'm not do anything about it today until after i get back yeah
S0262	no i know you're not and i never ask you to
S0261	mm
S0262	but i think we have to set quite a strong objective now
S0261	yeah and and i mean timewise this be what my driver be be that timewise erm when when say well what's your what's your time frame yeah for certain things and i say six months six months i want to have a foundation for something that i can then work towards carry on with so he's kind of oh well you wanna you wanna move quick
S0262	yeah yeah yeah and and also the other thing be be that it's it's if you if you talk about money yeah you need you need money to to live but you also need money to seed as capital erm and you know you need to know in a way that's reverse back because you need to go if i wanna do those things that you've just tell me i need to know how much that's theoretically how much capital i'm gonna need
S0261	yes of course
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah
S0262	and how long that capital's gonna last be i gonna burn through it
S0261	mm
S0262	or be i gonna be able to chip away at the capital
S0261	yeah
S0262	and just use it right at the right time
S0261	that's right
S0262	so until you've get that answer erm you could just be earn money while you're think that bite through
S0261	work those things out yes yes of course yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah and erm and yes er and and of course you do you need to be earn money to carry on so that's what we're talk about but erm and put those that that research and those plan in place until you get this kind of coherent this be what we're do how much it's gonna cost and where we're gonna start with objective for six months one year and and then beyond yeah
S0262	see the way i'd do it be like if i didn't have this job and i be try to set up like you i'd go right how do i earn money real fast okay i would erm go and do summer school cos they pay you gross er you don't have to be there forever you just do an intensive month and because it's just on intensive months they'd pay you er top salary okay and i'd do a number of those throughout the summer so i'd block off my summer in the uk and i'd go right objective be basically if i can put three or four of those back to back i'd earn about twenty thousand pound
S0261	mm
S0262	okay that will be my seed money
S0261	mm mm
S0262	and then i go off and do what i wanna do
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	i'd go that's all i'm will to commit to do that's those summer school it's not about me know that i need twenty thousand pound i'm just guess that if i have twenty thousand pound that that's gonna take me some way yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	erm and er and and that's all i'm prepare to give of my time anyway to to earn money on on er in that particular job
S0261	yes
S0262	because it i don't like it so i'm only go to do enough of it to get me to where i need to be
S0261	mm
S0262	financially
S0261	mm
S0262	to seed my capital
S0261	yes
S0262	that's how i'd do it
S0261	yeah mm mm
S0262	and i think most people do
S0261	erm
S0262	and i just think most people who haven't get access to investment er you know er capitalists and
S0261	yeah yeah yeah exactly
S0262	bank managers
S0261	mm
S0262	and stuff like that most of them will go hate that fuck job but i stomach it
S0261	mm
S0262	because it's actually the thing that actually get me a lot of fuck money
S0261	mean to an end mean to an end
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	cos when you leave normally you leave at the time when you're actually earn quite a good peak of money cos what i've see what people be do be that they be leave not because er the money be good
S0261	mm
S0262	but still the money be the same it be good
S0261	yeah that's right
S0262	look at what do he fuck turn microsoft down and what do he do he go away and become a backpacker for a while and go back and work for them still work for them so you know i'm not say that you'll go back and work for for whoever but you can see that a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year be a good wicket in sydney
S0261	mm
S0262	and when you break that down into a contract of you know whatever that be do something or other that be a fuck fast way of earn some capital much faster than
S0261	you've make your point erm so so we talk about er outsource in term of go away and make something out of the time that i'm away the action that i can undertake be that i need to talk to a bunch of people before i go i need to make connections with people who be there so we've get erm we've get erm contact and get singapore i'll put down question mark do you think it's worth go to vietnam
S0262	i don't know i mean i think you need to sleep on all of that stuff yeah i think we've kind of go through that bite quite a bite let's just sleep it let's sleep on that stuff and come back to it fresh tomorrow
S0261	righty ho
S0262	don't think i can make any decisions now on those things but what i think we do need to do today erm be be very honest with each other in term of the actual reality of the time frame
S0261	the time frame for what
S0262	for for erm what's go on and er what's go on what's er what i've i've mark out some some pointers i'll actually get my little book so i can show you what i've be think of
S0262	do we need a gin and tonic
S0261	erm if you've get some tonic
S0261	no okay
S0262	huh do you wanna beer
S0261	erm well you're not gonna make er something else
S0262	well what normally go with ginger ale
S0261	have a look at what's there
S0262	it would be kind of interest to look at it from a erm sort of seem arbitrary but i guess it's about the
S0261	monthly basis
S0262	well it's the visa thing so i work backwards from
S0261	mm
S0262	twenty first of july
S0261	that's this year
S0262	er sorry next year
S0261	yeah
S0262	so
S0261	mm
S0262	two thousand and fourteen so when i look at it i think oh actually you know what that's fourteen months
S0261	yes
S0262	not very long and er it have occur to me as i explain to you that erm i be more than likely quite keen to if it fit in with
S0261	the big picture
S0262	where be it fit in with
S0261	what
S0262	that
S0261	yes
S0262	i would like to do a doctor's degree in that
S0261	if the if if if there be something research out of it that come together
S0262	mm
S0261	right so if you do that you could frame that information in the context of business at the same time couldn't you
S0262	get seed money
S0261	yes
S0262	cos it's research
S0261	yes mm
S0262	uk very forward think
S0261	right
S0262	uhu
S0261	okay so you're interest in that in context of the thing in you be talk about
S0262	with the singapore thing
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay right
S0262	so it give us travel to singapore and asia and australia
S0261	yeah
S0261	yeah okay erm right and that that be
S0262	that would start in october two thousand and fourteen
S0261	right okay so that's er what a semester base thing start of a year
S0262	erm yeah it's just say it just say it start in october
S0261	right
S0262	normal academic year
S0261	okay so so in that context what would one build before that in term of business
S0262	well i have to go about i i i'll have to go about erm be the researcher cos i'd have to put a thesis a thesis proposal together which be by the way a professional stroke research erm degree it's actually a sort of hotchpotch
S0261	mm
S0262	so you can you er er it's one of these weird ones that's some sort of hybrid where you're still get a doctorate degree but you be actually a professional work like a work
S0261	for an outfit
S0262	i i could do i could do freelance work i could do work for a company i could work for an ngo i could work for a i'm a worker an employer but also attach to my research a bite like what do she's quite clever
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0261	yeah okay so you get a doctorate out of have do work with certain people and do the research and presumably the company you work for get the benefit of your research
S0262	no the research'll be mine
S0261	no right
S0262	erm dunno how that all work out that's why i have to
S0261	oh so that you have time off like it's erm you know day off for uni kind of thing
S0262	yeah possibly possibly possibly i i don't know like if you can get individual grant so that you can get seed money to develop your research ideas i er look to be honest with you i actually don't know enough about it that's why i'm side up to people like down at the university of and go how do you she get to travel round the world
S0261	mm
S0262	how do you do that how you know
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	of course
S0262	someone pass on that information and
S0261	yeah
S0262	you basically try and put what you can together but essentially i would want to be earn money
S0261	mm yes yeah while you're try to do that
S0262	cos it's er professional development
S0261	yeah
S0262	so i need to be in a profession but i really want the doctorate degree out of it cos as everybody say you go up amazingly higher as soon as you've get doctorate you know
S0261	if you want to work in a university
S0262	no no no even if you wanna prove that you fuck know what you're talk about with this shit cos you get credibility
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	you know you go into industry and you're like i'm i'm a professional
S0261	mm
S0262	with a doctorate degree like oh
S0261	so i'm curious about the perception by some people that if you've get a doctorate degree the options that you have when you've get that be limit because you be so specialise
S0262	no no because there's different type of doctorate degrees
S0261	i know it's a very generic
S0262	no it's alright
S0262	phd er philosophy er er doctorate of philosophy
S0261	yes
S0262	mine's not a phd it would be an edd doctorate of education education be a profession
S0261	right
S0262	so if i work within the industry of education
S0261	oh er er okay oh i haven't see that before
S0262	mm phd's academia
S0261	right yes so it be the academic side
S0261	of it i be think well you'd just end up down a a deeper tunnel
S0262	no fuck that i'm not do that
S0261	no
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that's i'm glad you say that
S0262	yeah
S0261	alright so
S0262	i'm not interest in do a phd
S0261	right okay so that that that's fine erm that in itself that sound interest and if the professional basis of your work involve well you'd expect it'd involve be in or er would it involve be somewhere
S0262	well you could you you you've gotta be a bite of an architect you've gotta create something really quite interest and you've gotta get people on board and
S0261	mm
S0262	you've gotta do travel and you've gotta get fund and
S0261	yeah
S0262	you know you've get to pitch and pitch and pitch away at it for probably about three to four years
S0261	mm so can your business stuff be your research and you're get pay for it so you're you're you're consult or you're provide people service that be wrap around your your research be wrap around it
S0262	i think you can i think if you look at more like a community capability development or er er you know like a er if you can explain at the moment this be the trend it might change soon but everybody talk about build skills capability in others
S0261	mm
S0262	it's this idea at the at the moment that's all about share that kind of you know
S0261	share knowledge and teach people
S0262	yeah it's a big trend i guess in the world go on about that
S0261	and and so everybody's
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	so i think if you can prove that
S0261	yeah
S0262	i think if you can prove you can do that yeah
S0261	so er imagine if er for instance this thing we talk about in vietnam that that you get a connection with some outfit
S0262	british council
S0261	that be do that yeah
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0261	and erm
S0261	and that you're do the work
S0262	yeah
S0261	you're get pay to do the work and a part of your your your personal remit be to carry out research relate to what you're do
S0262	yep
S0261	so the output be yours
S0262	mm it have to be it's your original work
S0261	yeah but that have to be independent of your work because typically your employer will carry copyright for anything that you do
S0262	no not not no it doesn't work like that mm mm
S0262	right
S0261	what i have be do it be like that
S0262	yeah
S0261	any work you do be the copyright of the business
S0262	yeah no i can work i can do work for my employer
S0261	yes
S0262	i'm just not do the research for my employer
S0261	right yes exactly okay
S0262	i'm do research on my doctorate degree
S0261	but what if er and then what if there's crossover though
S0262	well you come to some sort of arrangement most of the time
S0262	people understand you're do a doctorate degree understand that you've get to produce original work it's get to be of your name
S0261	right okay so if we look at that
S0262	mm
S0261	in in context erm right so do you see there be things that would be do before that that you would do to benefit
S0261	business wise er and certainly the research side of it
S0262	well yeah i mean you know it it doesn't just happen overnight
S0261	no
S0262	you've gotta you've gotta
S0261	mm
S0262	you've gotta go to the uk you've gotta go to the you've gotta
S0261	you've gotta start somewhere
S0262	go and talk to them and find out exactly what the degree entail then you have to find a supervisor that won't happen in august you've gotta have a thesis proposal
S0261	to present to somebody for them to consider to er mm
S0262	to present for them to even think about whether they want it
S0261	mm yeah
S0262	the lead time be probably be about a year if you're really look for a quality supervisor
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	and if you give yourself that amount of time then you'll get that
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that's fine that's cool that doesn't fit together with asia well it doesn't have to have to it doesn't have to
S0262	well if we're take this we're move round the world kind of thing
S0261	yeah it doesn't have to this be the whole point
S0262	yeah it doesn't really matter
S0261	mm yeah
S0262	it's just like what you just go where who what
S0261	mm
S0262	whatever suit you
S0261	yeah
S0262	you know pick out fly to wherever it doesn't matter
S0261	exactly mm yeah erm
S0262	you do need a base to put your shit
S0261	yes physically
S0262	just put it either well it's it make sense to put it in europe put it in the uk
S0261	well and then you really wanna cut down on the cost of that
S0262	cos both of us can fly in and out of well i know but i mean look people be do it and location rebel they're fly to place they live in place
S0261	yeah yeah and most of their stuff just probably end up at their parents' house
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	but i mean if we're follow that dream
S0261	yeah yeah yeah of course
S0262	we have to fuck start think about it right do it right now
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm mm
S0262	cos otherwise it's never gonna happen you're never gonna internalise that process if actually
S0261	no you have to operate like that
S0262	yeah so that's why i'm i've already accept it as an assumption
S0261	and you have to accept that that's er it's a potential cost
S0262	yes of course it be
S0261	mm yeah
S0262	mm that's why you have to find a way to fund it
S0261	mm yeah erm and there be mechanisms that you can use that be quite a lot cheaper than rent a gaff from somebody or something
S0262	well yeah i mean clearly like when you get to england
S0261	that's just all detail anyway let's not worry about that
S0262	yeah that's what i mean you know the er the
S0261	yeah yeah yeah that's all just er who care
S0262	yeah you keep do detail stuff
S0261	erm yeah i don't no er erm erm don't step back so that that's fine
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah
S0262	cool
S0261	erm and and that kind of stuff be good in a way because erm it be good because erm it provide you a timeline through which certain things have to happen
S0262	mm
S0261	and you try to synthesise things together
S0262	mm
S0261	such that you get the maximum benefit at each stage out of it
S0262	mm
S0261	
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so you you really think hard and strategically about how do we make this work for ourselves
S0262	mm
S0261	in the best possible fashion
S0262	mm
S0261	and if you look at look it doesn't matter where you be in the world but if you look at relative cost et cetera it be obviously cheaper to live in asia or something like that
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you er start such a thing in singapore as an example erm
S0262	yeah i don't know the detail of how it work out
S0261	who who know who know who know but it's
S0262	but but yeah we certainly would be leave sydney and we're go to the uk so i can start in the uk in october
S0261	that kind of
S0262	yeah because until somebody tell me it's any different that's the assumption that i'm make
S0261	mm that's fine
S0262	okay but yeah singapore do feature
S0261	mm yes but what that mean be
S0262	just don't exactly know when where and how
S0261	er yeah
S0262	yeah just don't know
S0261	as er as another thing
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you would be hop in august to draw something out of your time there in relation to this
S0262	yeah i'd wanna satisfy that i'm pick the right course and i've get the right kind of idea about it and how much it's really gonna cost me and how can i really get fund you know i'm gonna be ask some really
S0261	some of those detail so
S0262	really detail question in
S0261	so be it er be it possible to ask that without you know have a lot do in advance
S0262	no i'm i make an appointment er and i'll i'll you know okay there might be a way so there's a lot i might have to do my email anyway
S0261	you can do it online wherever
S0262	yeah but no when i'm in i will go and check out the whole fuck place
S0261	oh yeah for sure
S0262	i'm not sign up for something that i don't fuck
S0261	mm that's not real mm
S0262	talk to students
S0261	mm
S0262	talk to other people i'm just so you know once bite twice shy with some of these things
S0261	yes yeah you need to know that for real you've gotta yeah
S0262	you've gotta have a on the grind feel about it
S0261	yeah yep
S0262	you really do
S0261	exactly and you want to understand that with your background that it's feasible that you're go to be accept to this stuff et cetera et cetera
S0262	yeah and i might even go to another university just to sort of compare and contrast
S0261	find the other side of the fence
S0262	mm
S0261	yes and that's not a bad idea either
S0262	mm
S0261	erm er
S0262	dad's university and ask them a few question i'm like dad and he's like well why not
S0261	mm mm well of course
S0262	i'm like yeah i suppose yeah
S0261	my uncle do that he he go straight into as an adult learner
S0262	yeah
S0261	so
S0262	he say you know why why not
S0261	mm
S0262	why why would you not place yourself you know somewhere
S0262	all they're gonna tell you be
S0261	mm
S0262	you know
S0261	mm
S0262	and i be like and he say you know you've get a first class degree so you're already in there from their perspective
S0261	mm
S0262	your first degree if you can get the equivalent of a first class degree on your master of education then
S0261	on your master yeah why not
S0262	why can't you
S0261	yeah uhu
S0262	so i go alright
S0261	mm
S0262	i'll see how it go
S0261	mm oh well it's worthwhile just have a chat with people there
S0262	mm
S0261	because it's an easy thing to do
S0262	mm dead easy and i make i didn't i make that mistake when i be do that whole you know bloody go around england
S0261	yeah why didn't you just go and er on your doorstep
S0262	i er could've just bowl up to and there be people already do the work that i be interest in do
S0261	oh er of course yeah yeah
S0262	i could've just do the whole fuck week with them
S0261	exactly
S0262	rather than waste all this time
S0261	and you would've save the effort and the time and the money and all of that flap around
S0262	so yeah dad's get a point
S0261	yes yeah have a look at what's on your in your own backyard first
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	especially if it's
S0261	yes well exactly of course
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm but that that's cool
S0262	so the penny's drop then
S0261	well there's no drop pennies
S0262	but
S0261	i'm think with an open mind
S0262	yeah
S0261	which be that you know the context be you know you could do that and one could live in france
S0262	yeah i love that idea
S0261	you know
S0262	go and live in dad's place
S0261	but that's what i mean be that when you've get the right tool at your fingertips you can think like that you don't have to think oh well work's over there therefore i've get to be there and i've get to turn up at eight be every morning
S0262	yeah er
S0261	you know what i mean
S0262	and by the way when you're er like she doesn't she's do she be do her phd at
S0261	you're er your own architect
S0262	but look she's in brisbane
S0261	yes
S0262	and she's you know be remote for some time and she's still she's
S0261	and she's travel to spain to do it
S0262	as long as you can get to your supervisor when you need to
S0261	yeah
S0262	and by the way sometimes supervisors can fly into where you be
S0261	yes
S0262	if it's an attractive place to be like paris for example
S0261	absolutely of course
S0262	and er the other thing be be that erm yeah you know they do want you to turn up in block sometimes
S0261	mm
S0262	like the other thing do where you have to go for two weeks and you have to be there and but that's your education that's your fee
S0261	that's fine that's fine
S0262	that's what you're pay fee for
S0261	yes of course
S0262	to get some sort of educational train thing
S0261	but you get the context that you
S0262	yeah and you should have a relationship with some of the people in your university because a bite weird otherwise
S0261	you can have whatever yes of course so erm that be all part of the bigger picture of the way that i i'm think
S0262	mm
S0261	which be you can be anywhere to do whatever you want for whatever reason
S0262	mm
S0261	whether it's need or a want all of that kind of stuff
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah and that you can er act and react on your toe as you need to
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah so that would be the best context that you can go overnight erm we're gonna go and do this next week and then you put plan in place and you go and do that
S0262	mm
S0261	
S0262	and if we've get a wee nipper in tow well so be it
S0261	yes exactly now
S0262	and do it
S0261	yeah and er 's say well don't forget you're older and all this kind of stuff
S0262	well
S0261	well you just put other other things in place to make it easier for you
S0262	the the truth of the matter be be that er when if you if you give er if you give birth you be probably a little bite fuck for about six months
S0261	yes
S0262	erm and you probably aren't right for the you know until really a year
S0261	for the bigger journey yeah
S0262	but that's why you need somebody you can rely on to take some of the pressure off the two of the couple
S0261	exactly and when that's somebody that
S0262	and dad's perfect for that
S0261	yes exactly and er and whether it's somebody that's as close as family or somebody else that you build into your life to allow that
S0262	well think about all that and and blah de blah and
S0261	yes of and they're all examples of exactly the same thing
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know you just share the wealth
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and you can make it possible feasible
S0262	yeah
S0261	so that's just open mind think as far as
S0262	yeah and i i i'd be quite happy to have the baby bear in britain
S0261	mm
S0262	cos fair do then it's really obvious what happen be they get a british passport
S0261	yes which in theory have its er
S0262	which be a european passport
S0261	yes of course
S0262	which be already access to how many countries
S0261	yes er of course yes
S0262	it's a win win for that child
S0261	mm mm and through connection erm simply they themselves presumably would have right to to kiwis
S0262	new zealand yeah for sure look at what happen with who's i mean he get you know new zealand passport
S0261	yeah mm and that's how it exist at the moment but hopefully it will still be the same
S0262	well you just apply straight away for one apparently that's what you can do
S0261	yes that's right on behalf of your child
S0262	cos be bear in england
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	he get a kiwi passport pretty
S0261	yeah no that's that's the way that you do it that's the way you do it mm
S0262	he get a kiwi passport in three weeks when they find out they have to come here
S0261	of course
S0261	so one would imagine it er work either way but aside that again be detail but
S0262	it's pretty important detail though
S0261	yes the big picture fit and the glove fit the big picture and all of that stuff so that's that's straightforward in my head yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah that's fine
S0262	and also i don't think british er immigration would have too much of a problem if i bowl up look quite pregnant and they're go like oh right so be you here to have a baby i'm like
S0261	no but you're a british resident it's get nothing to do with them
S0262	yeah exactly that's why i don't er think i'll have a problem with it
S0261	mm
S0262	it would be a bite different if i bowl up to new zealand
S0261	yes you would have to be in the door beforehand
S0262	don't think they'd like that very much
S0261	no
S0262	no
S0261	you have to be in the door beforehand
S0262	and here be just a fuck idea there's no point have a baby here
S0261	no yeah that's right mm exactly erm that in itself be fine and that fit the context of all of those discussions as well that that fourteen month picture that kind of thing so that's cool
S0262	can i also mention something else to you this be round about the time we can start
S0261	yes
S0262	even if it get to december until i actually get pregnant
S0261	yes and then you've get nine after that carry on er overlap that october no it's right on the nail of it
S0262	two three four five six seven eight nine
S0261	oh no it'd be on the same day no way
S0262	i can take six and a half months maternity leave from university
S0261	yeah that that's pre and post though isn't it
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes so the you've get three pre and three post let's say
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	
S0261	or do that be that how it work i dunno it could be shorter before and more after
S0262	it's it's look it's it's it's up to complications and stuff
S0261	mm
S0262	it's always you have to discuss it with your unit
S0261	right
S0262	but quite clearly it wouldn't be that difficult for me to stop work around about then
S0261	mm
S0262	i'll just fuck the money
S0261	tootle off tootle off
S0262	yeah just do what we wanna do together
S0261	mm
S0262	enjoy that time together work out what you know what's go on with you and stuff and business and proposals and
S0261	well that that in itself would be quite er quite advantageous wouldn't it
S0262	and that's only that's only if er you know if it have get a bite earlier so bite luckier
S0261	then bigger picture better off yes like your think
S0262	mm
S0261	mm not to be say to anybody
S0262	mm
S0261	but that's quite cool i might be it three minutes of footage go miss
S0262	well it'd be funny wouldn't it
S0261	well er it would be it would be no i i do and er i i like your think i can see some common sense there erm what you think we digest some of that and come back to it tomorrow
S0262	mm
S0261	or something but really what i'm try to drive at be i want some key action that we can both buy into have value that either feed into some of the elements of that big picture which be education
S0262	mm
S0261	or or otherwise it be simply relate to
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah
S0262	well i i would also say that you know the the the the i'll find out more about it on friday but erm it probably be just as well if you do as much of your travel which you be gonna be do erm you know
S0261	in june
S0262	er er in these in er you know the time when the time when you can be away without things be too problematic and anyway we're gonna be away together in england
S0261	mm
S0262	but after that you be gonna have to be around because otherwise i'm not gonna get pregnant
S0261	no that's absolutely right of course
S0262	yeah i need you there
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	but
S0261	no don't worry about that
S0262	so you know
S0261	look this be relate to my birthday that's relate to your birthday
S0262	yeah
S0261	they be the reason why that's there really yeah and the fact that i'm try to put this stuff together now be to make the most of what's be a bad situation
S0262	mm
S0261	the intention initially hadn't really cross my mind more that it be erm gain more experience about travel in those areas and just try to operate something
S0262	mm
S0261	you know erm and that's kind of the big picture
S0262	mm
S0261	erm when you start to refine it and say well i want to get something out of this who can i meet who how can i get the the most out of this
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and be right in the context of see whether you can find key people to meet with
S0262	mm
S0261	which you can simply do some standard market research with you know
S0262	mm
S0261	right there you know you're the ears and you want them to talk as much as much as they want
S0262	mm
S0261	about whatever they do and learn about what they need what they want
S0262	mm
S0261	where they think they're go what their future look like that kind of stuff and there be definitely value in any of those conversations
S0262	mm
S0261	with whoever and like you say you meet with somebody and if they show you something else i'm sure there's something you learn out of see that
S0262	mm
S0261	
S0262	absolutely
S0261	erm so
S0262	so
S0261	if i say there's three two weeks
S0262	yeah
S0261	two weeks let's say four occasion
S0262	mm
S0261	that be of a let's try and get the most value out of those four occasion and the rest of it become other things that may or may not happen but can provide some other benefit as well
S0262	yeah i think i understand what you're say
S0261	now there's no reason why i can't meet four different people
S0262	mm
S0261	in in four different countries
S0262	mm
S0261	really erm if if be around it could be somebody who's in malaysia she work for a university in singapore erm
S0262	write this down and i'll make another drink
S0261	okay
S0262	it's not bad actually be it
S0261	yeah it's cos the ginger's a little flat
S0262	mm
S0261	okay
S0261	okay so i'm back on record now i just pause it for a moment so what i've get in term of people be in malaysia work for a university and presumably she have connections to some people
S0262	mm
S0261	it's just up the road from singapore so easy to get to
S0262	mm
S0261	erm there's a guy from location rebel who have who i mention who live in singapore he's singaporean
S0262	mm
S0261	so he's a native you've get and who may know people if you ask the right question
S0262	yeah
S0261	er but i don't rely on that specifically
S0262	mm
S0261	location rebel wise mention that there's a particular guy who live in singapore that i could meet up with
S0262	okay
S0261	he's likely to be american
S0262	mm
S0261	but
S0262	mm
S0261	erm you've get and then you've get indonesia you've get and his understand of things
S0262	mm
S0261	so trawl the brain for that
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and also in indo there's potentially people that be people that erm live in in bali as well right and there be certainly others that erm like there's a a guy who's go back to america but he live in indonesia in a different part of bali and he's marry to an indonesian woman so he himself have a different cultural outlook he's get children as well
S0262	mm
S0261	he's a little older than us
S0262	mm
S0261	so mature
S0262	yeah
S0261	but erm very receptive and i i've have quite a few conversations with him
S0262	sound good
S0261	so erm er i've just forget his name off the top of my head but erm he's very approachable yeah erm
S0262	you get erm you get erm 's husband
S0261	yes we have erm and
S0262	erm who else do we know in sydney let's think this through
S0261	people who have asian business connections
S0262	mm
S0261	that could be erm for us
S0262	mm
S0261	well rather than halt there we'll come back to that
S0262	mm
S0261	erm what i know be we talk about this vietnam thing you know the guy who i listen to on the radio
S0262	yeah
S0261	they live in ho chi minh city
S0262	oh yeah
S0261	at the moment
S0262	well that's that's handy
S0261	right so you've get erm er his name's and when he first come out of work move to bali and work for
S0262	right
S0261	right so that connection's very strong and they're very good friends
S0262	yeah that's good
S0261	right so and that guy i think if he present him well himself truly have an open mind to talk to anybody about anything
S0262	yeah okay
S0261	and he's get a philosophy background as well so he he he's a thinker
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know he like his business stuff but he be a thinker
S0262	yeah
S0261	which be quite good
S0262	yeah
S0261	and he's very much he's live and work in different part of asia so he's be in bali he's be in the philippines he's now in ho chi minh he's probably travel to everywhere
S0262	so how long would it take to travel from singapore to ho chi minh
S0261	well i'd say it's probably an hour and bite on a plane
S0262	oh right
S0261	yeah not far
S0262	okay
S0261	because it's that's just
S0262	south isn't it
S0261	it it's quite a way south
S0262	yeah
S0261	relatively and er
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and it's erm probably way over the east coast
S0262	talk to you never know she might still have people in ho chi minh
S0261	well i do ask her
S0262	yeah
S0261	i do ask i say have you still get friends there you know and it might be you know and she's kind of say yeah so that's erm
S0262	okay we'll put that down too
S0261	so that's er that's erm vietnam and that's erm ho chi minh hcm erm and yeah erm now of course she's rather negative person but that doesn't matter in term of she doesn't really know what we're try to achieve erm i just wanna talk to people about the way they see the culture
S0262	yep
S0261	and and how they operate in those place and out of this fella there be a myriad of people who work all over southeast asia that could be of worthy connection and they're they're all crawl all over the place
S0261	you know you can go to chiang mai it's the head of where all the backpackers hang out and do business
S0262	backpackers do business fuck hell
S0261	well they're not they're not just back they're not just backpackers
S0262	fuck sit around drink piss and smoke pot
S0261	you know they're people who be actually try to run a business but they like to be base in asia cos it's cheap
S0262	fair enough
S0261	that's fair enough you know er hedge your bet and make the most out of the cash that they've get
S0262	yeah
S0261	but provide them a good benefit erm we talk about taiwan and that be in the context of
S0262	well yeah erm
S0262	certainly well yes erm
S0261	and
S0262	i wouldn't mind ask i i dunno maybe i'd ask but but certainly i'd ask
S0261	yes
S0262	definitely ask cos she's good and
S0261	yeah
S0262	she'd be delight
S0261	right okay
S0262	delight to have get something
S0261	to earn more yeah
S0262	oh yeah
S0261	well to tell the story yeah so we could skype
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah this be er a lot of this i'm think and and generically i be gonna say my message out to
S0262	didn't and and what's his name live in taiwan chinese
S0261	hong kong
S0262	think it be taiwan
S0261	you could ask her
S0262	mm
S0261	cos i could have a chat to him get get a get a a western person's point of view
S0262	actually no don't talk to him cos he
S0261	he's a bite wire
S0262	yeah he he'd probably put put he'd probably put you off
S0261	he can maybe yeah well he'd put you in the wrong direction too
S0262	yeah maybe and i think you've get enough people on your plate now so
S0261	negative yeah yeah yeah erm general er general question so erm really my point be it's best to meet up with some natives which you er you could get a connection through western
S0262	yeah
S0261	er western people so
S0262	yeah
S0261	that create that kind of feel of there's a business connection potential
S0262	yeah
S0261	
S0262	yeah it's very
S0261	and that they're kind of the go between
S0262	yeah
S0261	to start with
S0262	be gonna be in indonesia when
S0261	well he's talk about move kind of soonish isn't he so erm he mention so it's feasible
S0262	really keep in contact with him don't rely on me to
S0261	no i do i send him a message the other day
S0262	oh good
S0261	and i say gimme erm gimme the detail of your mate who's a graphic designer
S0262	mm
S0261	i wanna know that
S0262	mm
S0261	i wanna look at what he do
S0262	mm back
S0261	no he he he he get back to me and say i'll send you some detail over the email but he hasn't do it yet
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah cos you know if i ask him again i'm sure you know
S0262	mm
S0261	but he's easy to get in contact with and he's reliable to get back to you
S0262	mm
S0261	i just put it on twitter and he get back to me straight away
S0261	yeah erm so those kind of connections be what we're look for so be there anybody else that we that we've miss off the thing that that could be i know we've get a longish list
S0262	i'd say for now we'll probably do alright with just keep that for now for saturday even when we're have a few drink
S0261	yeah that's fine
S0262	yeah
S0261	and we might erm streamline that but i can bung out a bunch of message quite easy
S0262	and some people will just go no but i know somebody who have
S0261	yes and that's fine and that's what i'm look for
S0262	what about and do they know anybody that
S0261	oh yes of of of course and i want to get their erm i want to get their collective mind on operate you know relationships connections what's mean again
S0262	er connections connect
S0261	to to
S0262	to be connect to be well connect
S0261	right as network
S0262	yeah
S0261	context of network
S0262	to yeah yeah
S0261	it's not it's not gift
S0262	er
S0261	cos cos say to me you know what mean and then i think it mean to be connect but then it make me think it's not like kind of like you give somebody an offer when you meet them
S0262	could probably have a number of definitions
S0261	right i remember when i be try to get in contact with erm that university that adelaide lot i'd get in contact on linkedin with a lady who be a consultant who brief people about how to do business operation in china and she have a video online which talk about that kind of stuff
S0262	yeah whenever those opportunities arise you should just really try and clarify what that person's talk about
S0261	yeah i know i just kind of it be in er it be just er kind of we be in a flow in the flow so it be just kind of like
S0261	oh yeah okay
S0262	mm
S0261	and i think i'll just go back to that
S0262	mm
S0261	i i should've ask
S0262	mm you should
S0261	certainly his point of view
S0262	always ask your question that's what you're practise
S0261	yes that's right erm
S0262	okay so that's good now can i have a turn about what i want to talk about
S0261	yeah that's fine
S0262	okay good erm so
S0261	be this for the record
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	cos it's bigger picture stuff
S0261	fine
S0262	erm we be hopefully have in december
S0261	yes
S0262	so i think we've agree we're not go back to for christmas
S0261	no that's right
S0262	we'll stay here
S0261	mm
S0262	and it will be you know our last christmas here for some time
S0261	mm
S0262	so it's gonna be good
S0261	time
S0262	er we're gonna i'm gonna try and store up as much annual leave between august's annual leave which be three weeks but i won't take off any annual leave between september october november try and store it all up for december if i can
S0262	erm and then erm
S0261	maybe you'll wanna mention to that your plan aren't longer term to stay here
S0262	look if he want to come out here just
S0261	just as long as he know it would be disappoint for him to find out he be hop to be in some place to get to
S0262	need a swap
S0261	get to know his sister better
S0262	we go to
S0261	mm mm i know
S0262	but that's alright because we could come out and visit him
S0261	yeah but you know what i mean
S0262	erm
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	but what it what it do mean be i would like to work on my father erm
S0261	beg your pardon
S0262	to well work on my father i mean i wanna wanna find out when he's think of come out to see us again in australia and when suit us for him to come
S0261	right
S0262	which clearly wouldn't be er christmas because we well unless go and stay with her sister which i don't think's a good idea erm er you know we'd want here kind of thing
S0261	that's right
S0262	so which be slightly problematic because i'm not entirely sure when i'd get a good dose of annual leave unless it be about you know take annual leave while i'm pregnant i mean annual leave mean maternity leave when i'm at the later stage of things yeah in term of pregnancy erm and that would might be helpful
S0261	sorry i haven't understand that
S0262	oh okay so annual leave be only three weeks a year
S0261	be it nor four
S0262	three or four it's not very long
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	if i'm try to store it all up for december when come
S0261	yes
S0262	and my father can't come out at that time
S0261	right
S0262	but my father should come and see us again
S0261	yes in between yes
S0262	so i need to find a time to accommodate him because i don't want to be go to work every single day ignore him
S0261	that that that's right so if you're work from september october november december that's four months so that's a quarter of your annual leave entitlement
S0262	mm
S0261	for the year that you've earn
S0262	mm
S0261	so so that be about a week
S0262	mm
S0261	right and through that christmas period typically a week be about how much you need to to get you through that whole period
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah erm and then and then let's say come out four months after that post summer pre winter april
S0262	cos it's a bite cooler
S0261	when it's a wee bite cooler
S0262	mm
S0261	he would probably like that
S0262	mm
S0261	and it's a lot more calmer less windy rainy and all of that erm then er then
