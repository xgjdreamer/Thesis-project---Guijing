S0679	i have a look at your two orchid plant in the erm in i suppose what you'd call your pantry isn't it
S0680	my under stairs in the kitchen
S0679	yeah yeah erm neither look in the best of health erm do one of them get a bite cold in the winter
S0680	well they be over at 's house erm so they be in a a really a mainly sort of unheated kitchen and they be quite near the window
S0679	mm
S0680	but i do pull them back and put them down on the drain board so they weren't fully next to the window and erm i think they do get a bite cold cos as you can see one of the leave have go a bite funny in the middle erm
S0679	yeah i've get a problem like that with one of my leave and i know exactly how it happen it be in the bathroom and it put its leaf well its leaf go against the window and it be a bite condensated i think it didn't exactly freeze on the window but i think it get very cold in the end of the leaf
S0680	mm
S0679	and then i turn it round to try and help it and i think it may have inadvertently stick its other leaf don't know quite what happen to the other leaf but something happen to it i reckon because it's get a similar mark on it like it's in the in the middle of the leaf like on yours
S0680	yes well mine my leave wouldn't have be touch anything cold
S0679	no but it would be jolly chilly in there wouldn't it
S0680	yes but i mean it didn't touch against anything
S0679	no no
S0680	so it's not the end so
S0679	no
S0680	it must be mine must be the cold atmosphere because
S0679	mm
S0680	er it's in you couldn't possibly have it touch anything
S0679	the root look
S0680	for that
S0679	okay on that one though
S0680	yes
S0679	so if it probably could do with up the water a bite and give it a nice biggish drink and then see by tomorrow how much it actually want then you may have to
S0680	mm
S0679	if er then you you know could discard the water out
S0680	well i have be give it half a cup er well half of that little container while it's be rest erm because it be still in well it be sort of rest i i end up cut off the long flower stalk but the flower be on it for age and age
S0679	mm
S0680	in fact its flower be still on when it shouldn't have have flower erm so it may just be confuse
S0679	mm
S0680	i don't know but i put it in that under cupboard because there's a window in there and it's er although it's south face it get shade by that er a bite shade by that shrub outside and i don't really have any erm be a terrace house i either have north or south i don't have any east or west be it east the chap we saw
S0679	i don't know but at at erm
S0680	it be a side wasn't it that i don't have
S0679	in the bathroom where i keep mine that's
S0680	mm
S0679	west actually
S0680	oh it might be west but that man we erm have a er go to the talk from
S0679	mm mm mm
S0680	he be say he think preferably the type of windowsills i don't have available
S0679	mm mm
S0680	well at least you're not in a back to back that'd give
S0679	no that would give you fewer options
S0680	even fewer options but erm i wouldn't necessarily have buy one of those myself but as they be buy for me
S0679	mm
S0680	erm you know can't really say i oh i can't have one of those i don't have the right window for it
S0679	especially the one that erm er live in your neighbour's house for a while before he remember to give it to you
S0680	oh yes that's may not have help help its early progress
S0679	erm i think there's a problem with the two that erm well it be three and it's now two that er we be give at the botanic garden last year
S0680	yes
S0679	they look awfully sickly and they've get some really dodgy brown mark on the leave which i don't think be intend
S0680	no
S0679	excuse me
S0680	yes well well those er my two one of them seem to have a little leaf start to grow
S0679	that's a good sign
S0680	in the middle but it look a bite well it doesn't look like it's dry but it be a much darker colour but that that's maybe how they be but the other one be er only get a dry bite in the middle really it hasn't sort of bring up a new shoot
S0679	mm
S0680	so er it's get some new root cos i think the knobbly things might turn into something else but they they're root
S0679	mm
S0680	so i'm not quite sure about those we'll have to er see how they get on really
S0679	yeah
S0680	mm i have get some little cuttings in the bathroom of a well there's an aluminium plant erm in some water er
S0679	they seem far less common than they use to be
S0680	no you can't get that so i be try to keep that one on because it be i i ought to cut the top off and do them again because they're get very tall and thin but i'm worry about lose them completely cos i haven't really see any about
S0679	no
S0680	er so and they do seem to like be in water so that's why i've leave them like that erm and next to it in another little pot there's some philodendron i believe it be sweetheart vine plant which erm have heart shape leave for its name and that like be in water so i've leave those cuttings in water for quite a time and i notice the other day that it's very cheeky one of them erm have put out a a shoot which they do and they you can root from those shoot and it's stretch across and stick its new root in the other one's water
S0679	ah
S0680	so they're like in a chain which remind me of your orchid
S0679	yeah
S0680	that be in the next pot to another orchid in your bathroom and it and it put its root in its neighbour's pot
S0679	and that might be the same one that er put its root on your flannel
S0680	oh yes and that's right cos i'd forget that yes cos when i be there and the flannel be hang on the hook a little further down it it seem to be progress its root and its root be rest on my flannel
S0679	yes
S0680	so er
S0679	very
S0680	it's a different way of get your flannel dry have an orchid drink the water off it but er
S0679	you know the spiky plant at your house that no sorry not at your house at 's house
S0680	yes
S0679	that come from probably originally
S0680	yes yes
S0679	there's about half a dozen of them just sit in water
S0680	oh well er some be in water and some be in little tiny pot
S0679	oh well i think most of them be in water
S0680	but they may have get too cold as well
S0679	oh
S0680	although they normally live in my north face they seem to like it in my north face sticky out window
S0679	i think they look quite poorly sit in water i'm think about take them into productive protective custody
S0680	you think i should have them take from me
S0679	well i don't know until you can you know and and i can
S0680	until i'm
S0679	until your certify as er somebody who be
S0680	when i'm a a capable plant mother
S0679	well i don't know
S0680	yeah yes
S0679	i think they don't look very well at the moment
S0680	no but i think they belong to the one upstairs possibly
S0679	mm i'm have some problems with those myself actually although i have get a lovely tub
S0680	mm
S0679	and oh the thing i didn't tell you be that i just stick some in this pot from i have one oh i dunno last couldn't have be last year cos last year so little get do the year before last plant it up and it be quite poorly but it it it come on nicely and this year it's put up three of those you know those flower that shoot on long stem
S0680	oh right really nice substantial ones
S0679	mm mm
S0680	oh good
S0679	erm and it hasn't do anything silly like that pheasant's breast plant
S0680	no
S0679	which erm keep put flower out stalk out and they seem to go at funny angle
S0680	yes
S0679	these be i don't know i'm they may have happen by now but they be grow up quite slowly
S0680	yes
S0679	erm
S0680	well that one in the bathroom usually have flower
S0679	yes
S0680	but it hasn't have any
S0679	well i've have it years and years and it's never do anything but erm it look as though you know it it it's
S0680	mm
S0679	it's come on but then i take two baby off when i repot it and they they look quite sickly
S0680	oh
S0679	but so i replant them up again er and so i be just wonder whether i ought to take the other ones or at least i think you should give them some soil i think they've get they catch chlorosis
S0680	what's that
S0679	it's when they lose their their chlorofilm
S0680	oh yes they they do look a bite insipid on the other hand they can go red cos they get too cold
S0679	chlorophyll not chloroform yes
S0680	chlorofilm
S0680	chloroform
S0680	they might not be allow as erm houseplants if they have chloroform in them
S0679	no no don't sort of put them and
S0680	you don't go sniff them
S0679	no
S0680	no yes yes chlorophyll yes i be wonder if i should know what substances they have in them yes
S0679	mm
S0680	but the erm what do you call them i think mum use to call them a she call them a money plant the ones with the sort of the succulents with the round fleshy leave
S0679	yes
S0680	erm there's a bite of an old it may have be the original sort of one i have cos it's a very old woody root that be on its side and it have start to grow some little bits now that's in 's bathroom
S0679	mm
S0680	and that's look go lovely
S0679	mm
S0680	that's that's enjoy itself in there it's it look much better and i should make some little plant out of those
S0679	mm get you've get a few other things on at the moment
S0680	i know that's why things have get haven't get erm

S0679	well you know
S0680	small shop buy
S0679	i be say not not try to be cos
S0680	well
S0679	er sometimes when you're try to work out what birthday cake to have if you've get people who have particular like and dislike you try and go for a middle of the road cake
S0680	yes
S0679	although to try and get round 's difficulty just make him some span spane plain sponge cake

S0680	but that be alright actually it
S0679	ordinarily it would have carrots in
S0680	well it er carrots carrot cake without the carrots be quite nice actually wasn't it it be just a different experience

S0679	i don't remember er now you haven't tell me what birthday cake you would like
S0680	oh sorry i be
S0679	so
S0680	avoid the issue
S0679	you can make you can make the decision just now and you're not commit to stay with it but if you at this very moment a cup of a pot of earl grey tea be go to come in

S0680	well there's so

S0679	so it would be the gooseberry the sponge cake the or the
S0680	so the
S0679	the lighter the victoria sponge with cream in it and gooseberry cook with some elderflower
S0680	yes well it's like a
S0679	well it's

S0679	no it hasn't
S0680	hasn't it get bits of slightly it well it's it or it's puree it's sort of it's erm

S0680	real gooseberries but it wasn't all pippy and pippy and watery it be a bite sort of
S0679	mm
S0680	i think they might have puree a little bite to give it

S0680	some thickness
S0679	when i do it i jam it with elderflower
S0680	oh you jam it yes well i mean it's get to have

S0679	put elderflower syrup in
S0680	yes
S0679	and make a sort of jam out of it
S0680	oh that sound very nice yes
S0679	well i think there's no point put some
S0680	yes
S0679	elderflower and some sugar cos you get less elderflower then
S0680	yes
S0679	i'm not i may also when i it i may i i have some caster sugar i think
S0680	yes
S0679	and i stick elderflower
S0680	mm
S0679	flower in
S0680	yes
S0679	elderflowers i suppose you can call them can't you erm
S0680	yes
S0679	and erm i may have use that in the cake
S0680	mm but you've get to have make your fill sort of stay within the bound of your cake
S0679	well i make it quite thick yeah
S0680	yes it's get to be quite a thick
S0679	cos erm i mean
S0680	consistency
S0679	you know be able to make jam that you can't get out of the jam jar so
S0680	yes
S0679	oh i probably put a little bite of lemon juice actually in it too
S0680	gravity resistant jam yes
S0679	mm mm
S0680	do you find a commercial industrial use for it
S0679	no no no he manage to get it out
S0680	yes
S0679	you could if you be concert you could get it out and he he recooked it with more fruit
S0680	oh right
S0679	and make a very nice he make the best it be the best jam he ever have
S0680	and be he alright afterwards it didn't cos you wouldn't want it to sort of solidify in you tummy would you
S0679	oh no it be just the erm
S0679	it be the angle the knife the amount of leverage you could actually get in the top of the jam jar
S0680	oh right i see yes
S0679	erm but
S0680	that's why bonne maman jam jar be good cos
S0679	yes absolutely
S0680	they don't have any resistance
S0679	erm
S0680	at all
S0679	you be talk about school dinners
S0680	oh yes
S0679	and the only school dinner i remember as in school dinner pudding be
S0680	mm
S0679	really actually this isn't true but at the time it be true when i i i think of it the other day be gypsy tarts
S0680	gypsy tarts yes
S0679	now how would you make the gypsy
S0680	well
S0679	do you think it be politically correct to say gypsy tart now
S0680	it's probably it's probably erm
S0679	travellers' tart
S0680	travellers' tart now i don't know er gypsy tarts well it's er condense milk i believe it's condense milk and possibly brown sugar to give the
S0680	colour maybe
S0679	so it's like a
S0680	because it's instant straight through your enamel and make your teeth drop out sort of stuff
S0679	mm
S0680	and then it's kind of whisk whisk up a bite and so it's set i mean er whether they put egg or something in it to make it set
S0679	i mm
S0680	but it be like a it's it be like a sort of mousse isn't it
S0680	oh i don't know who that can be it be like a mousse
S0679	mm
S0680	kind of a set mousse isn't it it's not
S0680	as i recall it's a bite more it's not just like a blancmange it's not like a custard
S0679	mm
S0680	it's more of a erm well mousse be the nearest thing i can think of not too
S0679	it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't flow out of the pastry case
S0680	no no it sit
S0679	mm
S0680	but you know but it's not like make a chocolate blancmange and
S0679	mm
S0680	set it in a pastry
S0679	i be try to describe it this be at that party on
S0680	yes
S0679	's family party
S0680	mm
S0679	and i be talk to his sister in law
S0680	yes
S0680	yes
S0679	and erm she say how she like school dinners and i say i wasn't sure i really like school dinners very much i i quite like gypsy tart
S0680	yes
S0679	and i say but i think they only have it in
S0680	well i'm wonder that
S0679	i think it's i think it's a food i think i've see it write somewhere anyway it's
S0680	because erm know about gypsy tart he be sort of almost well he be at school in
S0679	mm
S0680	even though he live in i mean he be bear in but they live in when
S0679	mm
S0680	by the time he be at in school age
S0679	mm
S0680	so he er well admittedly he's only just in but he
S0679	mm mm
S0680	remember gypsy tart well but other people nobody round in yorkshire
S0679	mm
S0680	seem to know they'd have curd tart in yorkshire but they didn't know about gypsy tart
S0679	no
S0680	so i think it might be a
S0679	mm
S0680	a southern thing
S0679	mm cos i describe it it be somebody as like banoffee pie without banana in
S0680	and that's probably why
S0679	so
S0680	i like it
S0679	i wasn't i wasn't very far off then be i
S0680	yes
S0679	because that's condense milk and erm sugar i'm fairly sure
S0680	yes cos i think it's get should be condense milk for the er thickness of it
S0679	mm
S0680	as well rather and evaporate
S0679	mm
S0680	cos don't you make fudge or something with condense or can you make fudge with condense
S0679	with
S0680	i've never make it
S0679	cut out a recipe out of the waitrose magazine for tablet which be
S0680	oh yes that's scottish isn't it
S0679	scottish tablet
S0680	extremely sweet
S0679	which be a simple kind of fudge apparently
S0680	yes but it's well it's extremely sweet
S0680	i'm sorry about this
S0679	oh
S0680	i don't know be it's all these er it's all these they've get my email mix er my er they've get my phone mix up with the queen and her ninetieth i think
S0679	i don't want to go on about school dinners but erm what be your favourite then
S0680	i can't recall have a favourite i mean you just have them
S0679	mm
S0680	my view rather some bits be better than others they do pretty good roast potatoes be always the one for roast potatoes cos she be little and
S0679	mm
S0680	she be little and blonde
S0679	mm
S0680	and er you know sort of quite cute she be my friend she be always the one who get er pick early on in the when we be in the first year to give present bouquets and things to visit dignitaries and er she always manage to get second at least on roast potatoes
S0679	mm
S0680	don't know whether the dinner ladies think it might make her grow a bite more but er
S0679	mm
S0680	but she be quite small and thin but er she could eat like a horse
S0679	mm
S0679	we didn't have strap boys to give the meat the the potatoes to
S0680	no no this be true not at that time no it be just us and er yes but and then when when it be sixth form do you have table erm separate table
S0679	we be allow table
S0679	chair and table knives and fork and water cup
S0679	from the first year actually
S0680	so be we but when you be in the sixth form up to the sixth form you you queue up in your years and get your plate and go and sit down at a table
S0679	mm
S0680	once you've get your dinner
S0679	mm
S0680	past the servery hatch
S0679	mm
S0680	but when you be in the sixth form they have erm table of about six eight six or eight those longer sort of table and erm i think we have we sit at those somehow i have a feel that you we have heat containers that you have your dinner out of or else they they put these on the table for the eight to kind of help themselves i suppose it be encourage table manners
S0679	oh
S0680	i don't know cos be always er keen to finish off the the tray
S0679	mm mm
S0680	the allocate tray of potatoes if
S0679	mm
S0680	everybody didn't want them and
S0679	no we didn't have anything
S0680	yes
S0679	we we always just have an ordinary table

S0680	in my school
S0679	mm mm mm
S0680	with the blue with the mosaic pillar in the middle
S0679	mm do i tell you i go back to the last time i go down to
S0680	oh right
S0679	and erm i they have a they have the farmers' market they use to have them in one of the there's an academy somewhere around there
S0680	yes
S0679	erm but they don't
S0680	oh it's er yes i know i can't think which school it use to be
S0679	er it's on the road
S0680	erm oh there be a be it
S0679	no
S0680	no it's one of the other ones
S0679	be near just next door

S0679	anyway
S0679	it's something something academy
S0680	yes yes it use to be somebody else's
S0679	and so i'd be to the farmers' market there so i go to the farmers' market at cos i think well it's an excuse to have a look and see what
S0680	yes
S0679	they've do but it's erm it it's a completely cos they've knock down the boys' school
S0680	oh
S0679	and they've build it where the boys' school be cos you remember we go back to just before they start build
S0680	yes
S0679	cos they've keep some of the girls' school and the boys' school's go
S0680	yes
S0679	but they've put a sort of a sixth form i think it's the sixth form study build
S0680	yes oh
S0679	there
S0680	right so they be they be they still or be they an academy
S0679	no they're
S0680	oh
S0679	well i think they're haven't they all get to become academies now or do that get throw out
S0680	no i think it get i think it i think er there be a u turn on that
S0679	mm well they're er they be they're grammar school but they're in a a school group with
S0680	oh yes i know they be but they haven't add academy
S0679	i don't think so but they're a language they're a language
S0680	yeah
S0679	specialist school or something
S0680	yes yeah oh right
S0679	but go back go back and like
S0680	mm
S0679	you know this isn't my school
S0680	no
S0679	er i have no
S0680	well not
S0679	connections no interest
S0680	not
S0679	in go back
S0680	not not if it's be flatten but we go er a few years back we go and we we meet that very nice man who show us round
S0679	mm mm
S0680	didn't we
S0679	yes that be just before they take
S0680	yes
S0679	the build down
S0680	because erm it be interest walk round the girls' school because erm although they've change some of it there be odd bits of the girls' school sort of poke out here and there like
S0679	mm
S0680	the odd bite of staircase you remember
S0679	yeah yeah i remember that
S0680	with the original erm rail or or the odd erm well some of some of the view have change cos they'd build things here and and also erm when i be at school you weren't allow to go across the join erm sort of erm er what would you call it not exactly a bridge cos it be over a corridor but the bite the walkway that be on top of the corridor join erm the bite erm from the din hall where the passage go across to the rest of the classrooms with our music in erm you you weren't allow to go across that because one end be the staff room and the other end be near the chemistry lab or something
S0679	yes
S0680	but we we actually we actually walk quite near there or over there
S0679	oh yes
S0680	somehow
S0679	yes cos
S0680	erm
S0679	yes it be
S0680	you know the
S0679	biology that be where biology be
S0680	yes
S0679	er chemistry on one side biology on the other and it be like the tech room in the middle
S0680	yes
S0679	that be the tech room and then i don't know that i don't the staffroom wouldn't have be the other end in my day
S0680	no the staff you know the open well the initially open plan nineteen fifties sixties whatever it be erm you know fifties probably early sixties open plan stairs they have in the
S0679	mm mm
S0680	entrance hall
S0679	mm
S0680	which be a din hall
S0679	mm
S0680	erm or it when you go up there there be the open plan ones which i didn't like and then they go to normal stairs and as you go round the first classroom of that land be french and the room behind it be the staffroom
S0679	mm well the staffroom move into the old library when i be there
S0680	oh the library upstairs
S0679	mm
S0680	be that the like the library use to be a classroom cos we have i have the library as a classroom and then there be a little room you come from that staircase you go into the library and if you go out the library the other end there be a little room that if you walk through it it be a classroom but
S0679	mm
S0680	if you walk through it you end up on the top of the other staircase
S0679	mm
S0680	where needlework and geography i oh it's
S0679	yeah
S0680	on that floor geography
S0679	probably
S0680	be on the floor and then if you go down a floor it be needlework
S0679	mm
S0680	erm because you couldn't use it you weren't suppose to use that as a through route because it be a classroom
S0679	mm
S0680	erm it i think it be an english classroom
S0679	fairly sure you can go through it in my day
S0680	erm or be i or be that right or be it that little join place you weren't suppose to through be it off the commerce room be like that cos the commerce room be below the library i'm just try to think what happen to the commerce room
S0679	in my day you go to the boys' school
S0680	no
S0679	cos i'm i first saw erm row of people sit behind typewriters
S0680	ah
S0679	cos i think i my first year erm my form room be the on the floor above in the junior school in the first year i think that be the year where the school leave age increase from
S0680	oh yes
S0679	fifteen to sixteen
S0680	no i think i can remember that and i think perhaps you could go in the library both end but you couldn't go in the commerce room maybe that be it
S0679	it would be quite handy for the staffroom to be able to get into both end wouldn't it it would save somebody have to all the way down and all the way up
S0680	yes yes well that's it they could cut across that link from the
S0679	mm
S0680	the art and music down near the bicycle shed end of things of the girls' school
S0679	mm mm
S0680	to the main hall end because otherwise erm otherwise you've get to go erm you've get to go down and round through the hall and along that passage to get
S0679	mm
S0680	so it's quite a long way whereas you can just nip out the back door of the staffroom cos the teachers use to sunbathe up there on that thing
S0679	mm
S0680	cos nobody else be you know the lunchtime have their sandwich or you know whatever they be do erm up there yes well that's interest
S0679	mm
S0680	but it have all change rather a lot round there with that retail park not far away and things
S0679	yeah i mean obviously they've get a lot of shop down there now haven't they
S0680	mm
S0679	in that area because you know the bite i dunno it's
S0680	retail park or something
S0679	be that be that
S0680	be east yes be retail park
S0679	oh be it
S0680	something i think
S0679	mm
S0680	yeah so i think i've see that as a name or it it's that kind of area
S0679	well there's and then if you go on a bite you get to tesco which isn't quite join then there's asda isn't there
S0680	yes well i think the whole thing
S0679	we've get a heck of a lot of shop
S0680	yes
S0679	you can see why the er high street in 's die
S0680	be struggle yes
S0679	because
S0680	mm
S0679	unless there's a lot more people down and they need a lot more things cos afterwards when i leave when i go to the farmers' market i think i might pick up a little something for lunch
S0680	yes
S0679	and there wasn't really anything that look really tasty
S0680	yeah
S0679	so i think i'd pop into mark and spencer's cos remember there's that big mark and spencer's food
S0680	near the travelodge
S0679	yeah yeah on that and i think well i'll pick up erm what i'd have previously be these little box salads er
S0680	oh yes
S0679	not not leave erm but erm couscous and roast vegetables and
S0680	yes
S0679	you know those prepare salads
S0680	prepare yes yes
S0679	i suppose you'd call them so i think oh i'll get another one of those well in fact i get two and have half of two
S0680	yes
S0679	and erm and i think gosh you know there's every shop unlike it seem where you have to go to different bits if you be go to go in town for shop or
S0680	yes
S0679	you know you have to go right up road to get a range of shop all the shop they're they're all kind of around there they're all within not exactly walk distance because you're not mean to walk around there really
S0680	no
S0679	but there's a lot more choice of shop than when we be there
S0680	well they be different as well we when we there be when i when i be when i be there to start with the supermarkets have only start to arrive when i be little
S0679	yes yes but i'm not i'm but if you want to buy anything you sort of have to go to didn't you
S0680	well the very big shop be at i mean our mark and spencer's be a reasonable size
S0679	but you either go into
S0680	or or people go to oxford street you use to go on a shop trip to london people do
S0679	yes but all the sort of the shop you'd go to for say when i be there in eighty i suppose perhaps high street have start die in the eighties but in the eighties like have all the
S0680	mm
S0679	the name you know
S0680	yeah
S0679	i'm talk about and posh department store but you know the sort of shop
S0680	yeah
S0679	that you'd get in every high street you have to go to to find one but
S0680	well
S0679	they're all at
S0680	yes well i know there use to be erm a dolcis in and well there use to be a dolcis on high street be it a dolcis or be it a saxo
S0679	no
S0680	they have one almost both of them opposite each other didn't they
S0679	no well freeman hardy willis and dolcis
S0680	there be freeman hardy willis but i know have one
S0679	be it
S0680	erm i don't no i think it be dolcis er it's in maybe
S0679	oh
S0680	they didn't have a branch at at the time cos it's i didn't really remember it opposite anyway we if you want to see all those sort of shoe shop you you have to really go to if you want to see the full
S0679	mm
S0680	range although we get quite a few of them you know if you didn't want to go to erm the clarks or the er ones in so er and er well we have 's get in your have you be 's still there
S0679	mm
S0680	cos 's
S0679	use to have those little machine that shoot money round the roof didn't it
S0680	mm yes er 's be alright i mean that have materials and things but there be more fabric shop in because it be a a bigger place but you could you could get what you want more or less
S0679	mm
S0680	erm think about it and there be quite a few electrical shop and things but the trouble be if you haven't get a car you can go on the bus to but erm as you say if you're a pedestrian it's a lot of walk
S0679	mm
S0680	you know if you're an older person it's a
S0679	yes
S0680	you might they might have what you want but you've if you haven't get a car to go in or you haven't get a car to drive round all the different bits of it
S0679	mm
S0680	erm it's a lot of walk
S0679	mm
S0680	and the road scheme doesn't seem to be terribly sensible
S0679	but i be just amaze how much they have there
S0680	mm
S0679	erm and i think gosh i suppose
S0680	all this
S0679	it serve all the
S0680	mm
S0679	all the towns around
S0680	yes well there's erm the sort of not diy exactly what be i think of erm
S0679	well there's a whole lot load of those as well
S0680	diy and and erm furniture shop type place and things quite a few of those there be some diys but it's not all clothe and food there's other carpet and
S0679	mm
S0680	stuff aren't there quite a few different but er well i suppose because and also with your shop in have have to fit in with because they couldn't just knock a great hole in the middle of
S0679	oh no
S0680	and stick a shop centre in
S0679	well they do with the centre
S0680	they do with the
S0680	but i mean in
S0679	yeah
S0680	in the er in the main bite
S0679	mm
S0680	erm you know they have more more restriction on that and it's it's a wealthier place than cos you get more tourists sort of thing
S0679	mm
S0680	to come and look at everything i suppose the same with that would be the the main historic centre
S0679	mm but they've get a whole new shop centre on the side of
S0680	yes
S0679	or it seem to be
S0680	mm
S0679	as i'm not a big shopper it doesn't make too much difference to me really
S0680	mm
S0679	cos i rarely go into to buy anything
S0680	no
S0679	but i be just i be just amaze cos i i pop in and i think i'd buy a sandwich and i think gosh there be all these shop here
S0680	yeah
S0679	cos i i go and use erm a wilko
S0680	wilkinson's
S0679	yes yes
S0680	yeah
S0679	and there be something else there and i think well i'm not gonna spend i could usually pick something up there because these things need a bite of plan
S0680	yes
S0679	erm
S0680	mm
S0679	normally because don't have the the the shop around
S0680	mm
S0679	erm and i suppose it's live out a bite anyway cos it's a bite of a drive to get not a drive to get into but
S0680	mm
S0679	you know it's an effort to go into in a way
S0680	mm and also in erm a lot of the land be control by the universities
S0679	oh absolutely
S0680	so
S0679	yes
S0680	there's er unless the university want to sell off that land which they or use it themselves there's not they're a bite like a a version of tescos that use to wasn't it tescos use to go around buy up things well
S0679	mm
S0680	er don't exactly go around buy up things but they've get so much land from historic time and
S0679	mm
S0680	things they've be leave and stuff that there's a lot of you might not appreciate do actually belong to to various university group
S0679	oh absolutely i mean most of the centre belong to and it wasn't that long ago that they buy that erm the bite that's now dock
S0680	yeah
S0679	they they buy
S0680	oh yes i mean but i mean within but they
S0679	yes
S0680	they they've buy land in all sort of odd place
S0679	mm
S0680	yes
S0679	but they've you know it be
S0680	yeah
S0679	it's it's one of the dock
S0680	be it er
S0679	yes
S0680	yes
S0679	erm i think er one of the colleges buy it
S0680	yeah
S0679	erm because somebody the story go that the bursar find out about it when everyone else be on holiday
S0680	and he think it be a bargain
S0679	and he have he
S0679	no he have to make a decision before he could get in touch with the master or whoever
S0680	yes
S0679	you know or
S0680	yes
S0679	the other senior people so he take a punt on it
S0680	yes mm
S0679	and it work out very well and i don't there's two things he buy that and he buy something else at the same time
S0680	yes
S0679	and er he's make the college
S0680	and they bequeath with things
S0679	i can't think which college it be now be it one of the colleges
S0680	don't know
S0679	whichever yes yes cos erm 's 's daughter who's do some fundraise and erm they be try to raise something for their must be their four hundredth anniversary
S0680	oh yes mm
S0679	and they set two years or something
S0680	yes
S0679	to get all these millions and they set off to do these well
S0680	yes
S0679	i don't think they personally be but they they be do it's a worldwide sort of
S0680	yes
S0679	appeal
S0680	yes
S0679	and they get at least as much money in a very short time
S0680	yeah
S0679	so yes but people be you know successful and want to give money
S0680	mm
S0679	and then you get weird not weird people but there be the man er man who give the as in the centre at college
S0680	yes
S0679	you know as you drive out along the erm the road to
S0680	yes
S0679	there's a funny shape build
S0680	mm
S0679	college
S0680	yeah
S0679	and that be leave by somebody who be erm apparently have no connections with the college but just think it would be a good place to have his name remember i suppose
S0680	yes
S0679	or want to do a good deed or
S0680	yes
S0679	erm whatever
S0680	that's right mm
S0679	yeah
S0680	mm that's good
S0679	oh i be go to tell you something and i just can't think what it be now we be talk about er land oh oh it's go no it's go completely it will come back so what be you hop to get be there anything you you would really like to do this afternoon or you feel we ought to do this afternoon cos it's nearly it's nearly the eve of your birthday
S0680	it be
S0679	and i know that you might there might be things in relation to 's house that we need to sort out or you might want to go out now or
S0680	well
S0679	or you might want to do anything
S0680	it look a bite well it's not actually rain now but it doesn't look very bright out there
S0679	i'll take that as a kind of no then
S0680	although the tree be look extremely verdant but er i can't i mean it's it well i know it's i'm look out of the north window but look down there further it doesn't look that sunny on those house roof that
S0679	mm
S0680	might have get some sunshine
S0679	mm
S0680	and there's a bite of a breeze blow so perhaps we we could go for a little walk and go and nose at park see what they're do
S0679	yes oh i'm not suggest we trek as it be i just
S0680	no
S0679	you know as in er here or
S0680	well we could
S0680	well we'll we'll take a drive up to park and just go and nose about and see what they're do to set up for the triathlon
S0679	oh yes okay
S0680	oh in fact we could drive up there to find out how long it be and see if it's as far as you can walk
S0679	good plan mm
S0680	erm
S0679	you could make me walk and see where i stop
S0680	you can run along behind the car and i'll tell you how far you've be
S0679	because it make me go set off and then i'll tell you i've get there or you come and pick me up but
S0680	yeah
S0679	that might not be
S0680	no so we we could have a a a test of how far it be because we won't be able to to go anywhere tomorrow because
S0679	mm
S0680	i can't go anywhere because the road be close
S0679	i can actually always look it up on google map but we could that
S0680	oh yes i hadn't think about that
S0679	that be a possibility
S0680	yes right
S0679	do you want to go down to and look at that shop entrance
S0680	oh not especially
S0679	i can't remember exactly why i want to do it now but
S0680	oh
S0679	have we look at it enough on google map
S0680	you you've look at it i just want to establish where it be because
S0679	yeah
S0680	it's difficult with erm address that have get a hundred and something in them or five hundred and something as to which bite of a very long road it be erm and i think it be on that bite yes
S0679	now i haven't put those er
S0680	and you can't go and get your key
S0679	sorry
S0680	cut in 's yet so
S0679	cos i haven't get them
S0680	you haven't get them so
S0679	where be that
S0680	's be along it's up road almost to the school
S0679	oh right okay erm the thing i haven't do also be i haven't put the reflector spotlight on freecycle yet
S0680	no
S0679	because possibly
S0680	somebody need to be there
S0679	no no no
S0680	if anybody's interest
S0679	no no no they'll phone they'll get in touch in whatever way
S0680	oh right
S0679	we ask them to
S0680	yes
S0679	cos you need to know when otherwise you're gonna you know don't just wait and see if anyone come you arrange it with a particular individual
S0680	yeah
S0679	but possibly i should have should measure the erm the width of the front of the lamp you know the top of the non screwy end of the light
S0680	the glass bite
S0679	yes the width of it because look at how they're sell
S0680	yeah
S0679	they're sell in diameters
S0680	not in wattage
S0679	well i guess wattage as well
S0680	yes
S0679	but they tend to be quite close fit don't they they're not like a bulb which hang in a space they tend to go into something don't they
S0680	er they do but a lot of those they as they be originally on 's disco they weren't necessarily insert
S0679	okay
S0680	in
S0679	well i'll try and i'll put them but i just think it might be a question we'll get
S0680	right
S0679	but i can put them on
S0680	yes and and the fact that presume they work
S0679	well we can't
S0680	well if they rattle they don't work and if they all rattle then there's no point
S0679	we be sell them with we're we're not sell er we aren't give them away with the guarantee
S0680	no but i mean we could just
S0679	and some of them
S0680	shake a few
S0679	yeah well i mean i go through them as much as i could bear
S0680	yes
S0679	and if you shake them too much i think you'll break them anyway
S0679	so i mean it's a little self defeat
S0680	they've get to stand a little bite of movement because of the er fact they're go to travel about
S0679	be they
S0680	well somebody's gonna come and get them
S0679	well yes yes but they're go to be yes once they've get them home and test them they
S0680	yes
S0679	may not travel
S0680	yeah
S0679	so presumably if it's the same setup as you put your ad up say this be what i've get i want it collect by x so i'll say wednesday erm and
S0680	so be they all erm white you know plain normal
S0679	no no
S0680	normal light
S0679	about a third
S0680	reflectors yes be they colour reflectors
S0679	a few
S0680	or be they colour light bulbs
S0679	er
S0680	have you get some colour light bulbs
S0679	yeah yeah i've get four four sort of things but if we discount the
S0680	oh right
S0679	colour light bulbs ie things
S0680	because i've get rid of quite a few er because er when i go to the tip last with you
S0679	mm mm
S0680	they hadn't empty the light bulbs and there be
S0679	mm
S0680	erm an array of 's
S0679	mm
S0680	multicolour light bulbs
S0679	mm
S0680	erm in on the end of the
S0679	mm
S0680	collection look quite erm jolly
S0679	mm
S0680	yes
S0679	erm so discount about half a dozen light bulbs which be colour
S0680	right yes
S0679	which be in box that say reflectors largely
S0680	yeah
S0679	apart from the ones that claim to be pearl light bulbs
S0680	mm
S0679	which obviously weren't
S0680	you see the ones that
S0679	there's a there's three type there's colour reflectors
S0680	yeah
S0679	small white reflector small white reflector large
S0680	yes because those light box that erm be go to take away
S0679	mm
S0680	have light bulbs in them which be light bulbs that would work
S0679	mm
S0680	but there's not a lot of point in take them out unless somebody want to stand and unscrew them all
S0679	which be what be they light large reflectors small reflectors
S0680	i would imagine they're probably ordinary light bulbs
S0679	oh light bulbs okay well i think probably people i don't know how much they use ordinary light bulbs
S0680	although they may have be all those be those reflectors all screw or
S0679	i think they're all screw
S0680	bayonet
S0679	screw i think i don't think i find any bayonet
S0680	right that cos that's another thing you need to put whether they're bayonet or screw
S0679	yeah i think possibly they're always screw
S0680	but the it's not something i use very much
S0679	anyway if somebody's interest then we can have a more detail conversation with them if necessary
S0680	yes what i mean be it's it's good deal to have actually have the answer
S0679	mm
S0680	cos i hadn't think about that
S0679	mm if we haven't get the answer we can find out
S0680	and we haven't get
S0679	it all seem a bite more lay back than the erm where you put an advert up and by the time you've send it you've get three people
S0680	three phone call
S0679	phone and say
S0680	yes
S0679	i'll come now or can i come now
S0680	cos we might have to put some of those small speakers on on i be gonna say on freeview what be i talk about
S0679	freecycle
S0680	freecyle yes
S0679	yes
S0680	mm as well if nobody want them
S0679	mm
S0680	just to see if anybody want to take them
S0679	have you get a phone number for that guy who's mean to be email us
S0680	he's the branch
S0679	yeah have you get his phone number
S0680	i've get the branch number
S0679	well can you phone him up phone him up and ask if if he receive the email alright and that'll remind him who you be and then you'll know if he's there or not and if he's get the email
S0680	right
S0679	cos we you'll until you know somebody's get an email you might be wait for a response for something that hasn't get to them
S0680	yes well that's what he tell me to do to do er to get
S0679	yeah but you know just contact him at
S0680	mm
S0679	i can look the number up perhaps if you haven't get it
S0680	no i've get it on a piece of paper
S0679	yeah okay
S0680	on all of my list over there
S0679	mm
S0680	can't think of what else we might have be put on freecycle
S0679	well let's just let's just see how we go i don't know how dynamic it be here they seem to be go into quite a lot of detail with what's happen to things it's
S0680	what they report do they
S0679	well they they say when things be take in a
S0680	oh right
S0679	like in they just assume like just kind of assume i think
S0680	oh

S0680	no
S0679	but erm
S0680	well i don't
S0679	i might keep a couple of white ones because i have get actually get some i might you know i life's be a bite difficult over the last few years so you know i haven't it's like i hadn't go round to finish my bag of radishes because
S0680	yes
S0679	i hadn't get the like i be say i haven't eat any radishes and i haven't tend to bother with them because when i have get them i hadn't get them when i be at work i erm wasn't get through you know i be
S0680	yes

S0680	yeah
S0679	didn't think oh i fancy some radishes so there's things in life that i might quite like but have pass me by because either i be at work and hadn't get time to do it or be too poorly to be bother with them i suppose

S0679	but er i wouldn't mind some just white candle cos they can be quite nice
S0680	right well they're not white white cream
