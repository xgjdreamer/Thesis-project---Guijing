S0525	oh good how's this one be be they supply the current one cos he employ someone from the agency
S0517	yes
S0525	didn't he to be er
S0517	i don't know if he have
S0525	to
S0517	but they they it hasn't
S0525	i'm sure he tell me he have at christmas
S0517	arrive yet it's i think we're start to deliver it in march
S0525	oh right
S0517	but the haven't haven't get a contractor yet
S0525	oh
S0517	but the other one you know the one
S0525	mm yeah
S0517	well you don't but you know that be the one that be the contractor and then be give it to and so
S0525	oh
S0517	we've be deal with
S0525	uhu
S0517	cos they be gonna be actually put the pipe in the grind
S0525	right
S0517	well have a meet with last week and they tell him off the record that erm weren't go to get but er be their framework provider
S0525	right
S0517	but they've mess up and they they be actually gonna not gonna use them they're gonna sack them in effect
S0525	oh

S0525	oh
S0517	and be hop that they'd buy would buy the pipe direct

S0525	's give it to him
S0517	no
S0525	oh
S0517	well close though say oh well just gonna take it yeah yeah 's 's offer money for it so of course immediately go march down to and say oh you're buy the antara and and go no 's give it to me
S0525	yeah
S0517	and then go well say he doesn't actually want it so well why's he have it then
