S0202	from what from what i know from be with her and be friends with her she doesn't eat a lot but she hasn't she hasn't stop eat i wouldn't not say she be a full anorexic like but she be she's get an eat disorder she she's get some sort of eat disorder cos of everything that all the shit that her mum say to her and all that sort of stuff
S0208	yeah
S0202	but like when tell me i be like fuck hell i have no idea
S0208	that's so awful to come from your mum as well
S0202	mm like her mum's not skinny either like her mum's a middle age woman she's carry a bite of weight around her stomach but she doesn't she's not fat but she's not skinny
S0208	why would you say that to your child though especially like no matter how old you be
S0202	do you wanna grab
S0208	it's very you're very impressionable aren't you
S0202	yeah
S0208	and girls especially be a little bite more what do you want me to grab the
S0202	er yeah that
S0208	erm impressionable especially from your mum like
S0202	but like never open her mouth and talk about it like she'll never say
S0208	i bet she doesn't
S0202	but like the thing be like i just
S0208	thank
S0202	don't understand her like she have these emotional block up and she make it so difficult to get close to her and like
S0208	thing be she probably doesn't wanna talk about it because she's ashamed at the fact that she let it get to her but also at the fact that it's her mum you know what i mean
S0202	yeah her life would be easier if she just speak to people but she doesn't
S0208	well maybe we need to approach her more cos maybe she's too shy or ashamed or whatever to come forward but maybe if someone bring it up with her
S0202	yeah i'm not bring that up
S0208	or just say
S0202	i don't want i don't want to bring that up with her cos like i don't think be suppose to say anything
S0208	no no but what i mean be that someone could just mention it would be like oh you look a bite upset be everything alright or like if she's eat and we're eat at the same sort of like oh you haven't eat much be something on your mind
S0202	mm
S0208	it's like be you upset about something
S0202	yeah
S0208	so maybe if you coax it out of her she might be more incline to trust people and tell them
S0202	mm but she's so slim like under her she wear baggy clothe a lot so you can't really tell but like she's so slim like so skinny you can see her hip bone and everything
S0208	she's get worse then cos she wasn't that bad last time i saw her
S0202	no but erm
S0208	bless her though that be awful
S0202	mm she do not have a very good relationship with her parent though i don't think like she make out on the surface everything's all perfect and rosy and she have this perfect life but like her dad's get another girlfriend in spain
S0208	i be gonna say she doesn't see him very often do she
S0202	no cos he work away all the time and then obviously her mum's like that with her really judgemental and stuff
S0208	that's so sad that's really sad i can't imagine not be close to my parent
S0202	it would be weird wouldn't it
S0208	mm
S0202	i mean i'm not particularly close to my parent but i've get a good relationship with them
S0208	yeah
S0202	do you know what i mean like me and my dad don't see each other very often but that's how we both prefer it like
S0208	but you still get on when you see each other
S0202	yeah as long it's not that we prefer not to see each other it's just that like he live far away i'm at uni and we've get other stuff go on like
S0208	yeah it's the same with my parent i don't see them very often but when we do i know you know we we get on we have a laugh
S0202	yeah
S0208	and just know that they're there for you for support as well my mum would never dare say something like that to me
S0202	well your mum have her own problems with her weight doesn't she
S0208	mm yeah she do
S0202	so i always make a conscious to say to her when i see her like have you lose weight like i i genuinely believe that she look like she's lose weight i don't just say it but i always make a point of like say to her oh you look really nice today
S0208	yeah
S0202	like
S0208	when i saw her for the first time down at the hospital i could see it but i think that be also due to stress
S0202	mm
S0208	she look i'm not gonna lie and it's not to be nasty but she look awful when i saw her but that's obviously just the stressful period i could tell she hadn't be sleep she hadn't be eat properly like she just look a bite drain
S0202	yeah
S0208	she look much better now
S0202	mm
S0208	cos i'm not say this nasty but my mum do genuinely look better when she's a bite more
S0202	fill out
S0208	plump yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's it's her body type it's how she look healthy
S0202	yeah
S0208	just bring life into her i don't know what she's so worry about though because she's not fat she's never be fat
S0202	no she's not fat
S0208	i remember once when we start do wii fit together at first it be fun we be both do it like just to get in shape like we weren't do it to lose weight and when they do the test so it tell you our bmi it say that she be like practically clinically over like obese and i'm just like that's so wrong that's not even slightly accurate because
S0202	yeah
S0208	you look at her and she's not fat at all
S0202	she's get to be the size she be to carry her breast
S0202	fuck hell like most of her weight be her boob
S0208	yeah probably weigh about ten kilos each
S0202	but like she your mum i know it bother her like cos i've hear you tell me before and i've hear some some of the stuff she say and stuff like that and i'm just like it's and when i know people be like that i always make a conscious effort to tell them like you look really nice today like
S0208	yeah
S0202	or when i first see them have you have you lose weight like have lose so much weight since last time i saw her when i get back from america
S0208	mm
S0202	it be the first thing i notice but like she's the she's the same she's short so she she doesn't carry weight as well as someone who would be tall but she probably weigh and be the same size as i be
S0208	yeah
S0202	but just cos she's short she's more conscious of it
S0208	it look different
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos i feel i've get much better with mine i mean i haven't have any problems any incidents since i've be here i think it's as well be out of that stressful environment and i've be at home comfortable i've be absolutely fine
S0202	yeah
S0208	i haven't have a single problem
S0202	good i'm glad that you've tell me that
S0208	yeah it's like know kind of but that's only because like the first few weeks when i get back it be really bad like it be really bad and i'd notice it as well like i'd you could see my rib and my hips and stuff
S0202	mm
S0208	and i be wear my short and i be just get change and pull my top up and i hear her gasp she didn't say anything i just hear her gasp and i put my clothe back on it be only later on when we be a little bite drink we be out here have a cigarette and she ask me she be like what's happen
S0202	mm
S0208	so i have to tell her but i think since then like since i realise and then i actually saw myself i be like oh
S0202	mm
S0208	no no it's just not attractive
S0202	i'm not really want to bring it up with you cos obviously when you tell me you be drink so and you tell me not to say anything
S0208	that's the only time i tell i tell anyone
S0202	i know but that's why didn't wanna bring it up cos
S0208	yeah
S0202	i didn't want you to feel embarrass or
S0208	i didn't tell and he guess
S0202	well know your body probably just as well as you do
S0208	yeah and he's be really great through all of it he's always help me so that's like any time i've be drink and i've be sick it's not for that it's because i've literally be so ill
S0202	mm
S0208	and he always have come into the bathroom or shout at me and be like what the fuck be you do or something and i'm like it's cos i'm ill like calm down
S0202	mm
S0208	but he's be really really good about it
S0202	it's not healthy
S0208	it's not
S0202	and you've get nothing to worry about there's nothing wrong with your body but as many people as you want can say that to you but it doesn't change what you think
S0208	exactly
S0202	i know that myself
S0208	but it doesn't seem to be a problem now i'm hop that will stay
S0202	it'll just be the stressful environment you be in
S0208	yeah i think
S0202	at uni
S0208	i think it be that more than anything and
S0202	it'll be a million stuff and
S0208	yeah
S0202	i'm worry about my mum and her eat habit cos she didn't eat a lot anyway and now she's this have happen with like
S0208	it can either go two ways isn't it people will either stress eat or stress starve
S0202	mm but i hope it doesn't i hope she's not gonna make herself ill
S0208	well
S0202	she doesn't eat a lot anyway she
S0208	that's just where you have to come in i guess
S0202	like you have one she have one meal a day and she don't even finish her meal like
S0208	and without make it into a problem or sound nasty or anything i think you just have to keep an eye on her
S0202	yeah
S0208	and make sure that it doesn't become a problem
S0202	yeah
S0208	sorry
S0202	it's alright that rooster be so weird look at it run around chase them all
