S0428	yeah so you talk quite often on the local radio
S0486	yes well i seem to have a lot of opinions about things and erm they've get my name and quite often they ring me up when they haven't get anyone else to talk about anything basically so that's what i do erm and er i do start in my early life because i go to eight different school and erm
S0428	wow
S0486	my whole education be completely mess up erm i rely on my speak voice and i end up do drama and erm i be an actress for a little while and erm go to drama school and do all that thing erm because erm you often find that people who haven't get a lot of erm intellectual background they tend to erm get round it by talk so i end up with a career in advertise for sixteen years sell advertise to people erm and er out of the three three girls who go to drama school with me erm two of us end up work for thompson yellow page
S0428	oh wow
S0486	where you have to smile and dial and erm do the step of the sale attention interest desire and action
S0428	oh wow
S0486	and that's really quite important when you're erm try to sell advertise
S0428	mm
S0486	er as a result of be almost indoctrinate and brain wash my thomson's yellow page
S0428	so what be yellow page
S0486	well it it be erm you know the yellow page directory it's not so prevalent now
S0428	like yellow page
S0486	yellow page yes
S0428	oh okay
S0486	and erm in those days they do a lot of erm research into the best sell colour

S0428	it's really eye catch
S0486	exactly and i do art week sometimes in and we all our all our sign be yellow with black print erm which you put at the end of the road to attract people in to come and look at the studios so that's quite er an important thing
