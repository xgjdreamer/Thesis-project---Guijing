S0144	where's what
S0024	ah i just walk past one of those um bird table that we buy your dad
S0144	yeah
S0024	remember when we be sit in his garden he be talk about his other bird table and i be like i wonder where that that bird table we buy be
S0144	no it be in his garden
S0024	it wasn't there
S0144	it wasn't a table i buy it be just a little um house
S0024	it wasn't there be it
S0144	like a little bird house it didn't have a er a stand
S0024	oh i think
S0144	and they they'd hang it on their trellis
S0024	really i think they'd throw it away
S0144	but i ask him if he have um if any bird have go in it and he say no but i think that's because it's near the fence and cat can climb up it
S0024	oh
S0144	but i didn't say anything cos i have a look around and there be nowhere else to put it
S0024	oh i didn't i didn't see it i didn't see one that we buy
S0144	yeah it be there
S0024	i be look
S0144	look there's another hot air balloon up there
S0024	where
S0144	er it's by the other one
S0024	oh i've lose the other one now as well
S0144	there's one over there oh
S0024	i can't see it at all
S0144	huh
S0024	no i've lose them all
S0144	no hmm
S0024	yeah they're always around here
S0144	er nice day for golf
S0024	if yeah if they do crash in the field though what be you like i couldn't believe that man that i can't remember it really clear that clearly but i remember you know run cos the air the hot air balloon crash
S0144	yeah
S0024	and i saw run when all of the other neighbour run to go and see the hot air balloon it must have be
S0144	that must have crash quite badly then
S0024	yeah well it just fell down didn't it er i dunno
S0144	what it fell out of the sky
S0024	no it just kind of come down gradually at a steady speed
S0144	right
S0024	a steady speed but you know it wasn't suppose to be go that fast into the grind
S0144	yeah
S0024	and we be all round to see what it be like and i'm pretty sure they all tell me to go away
S0024	that's all i can remember they tell me to go away but if they're well it must have be embarrass for
S0144	well if they're still get well yeah but if they're still get drag across the grind
S0024	no no no it'd stop i think i be a bite late actually and he'd already get out of the basket and everything
S0144	right
S0024	he be just like what be you what be you all do around here go away but well what be you suppose to do you know you've get to go to somebody's i mean we be all go to see if there be anything we could do we weren't just go to go and gawk well maybe we be go to gawk a little bite but we be go to check
S0144	yeah
S0024	ultimately the reason that we go be to check that everybody be okay
S0144	be it
S0024	he just think we be all mind you i suppose if you get quite a few neighbour all run out together and then there's that gawk factor isn't there they're all just stand there ooh look what be they do
S0144	gawk
S0024	yeah we use to say that
S0144	i think it be gawp

S0144	huh see look at the size of these power line like these aren't just normal power line
S0024	no these be massive what
S0144	these be big like connect ones between big towns and that's why i think all of our ears ring at night because
S0024	they be pretty massive aren't they
S0144	yeah they're huge look at them
S0024	well aren't they all that size
S0144	i mean my my ears never ring it's only at this house that my ears ring
S0024	no that's not true cos in wales when we be up the top of the hill no other power cable about apart from go to that little cottage and my ears be ring
S0144	yeah
S0024	so i er mm erm i dunno
S0144	well
S0024	but i know it be it have be bad here this whoosh in my ears be get stupid
S0144	hmm
S0024	it's get really stupid
S0144	yeah well they finish do whatever they be do to them cos before we come they have all those net under them didn't they to stop the wire fall in the road cos they be do some kind of
S0024	oh what be they do i've forget
S0144	repair work with them weren't they but who be it that be say they be get pay how much
S0024	i do feel really dizzy when i'm here
S0144	yeah
S0024	like i don't feel
S0144	you feel dizzy because you're stand under one of these
S0024	oh
S0144	seriously they're really bad for you
S0024	well there's not a lot of place
S0144	as well they've do study to show that people who live under these things be so much more likely to get like brain cancer and
S0024	under it or near it
S0144	well near it i don't know what the
S0024	i mean really if it's like half a mile we must have walk about a half a mile by now
S0144	i don't know what the um
S0024	oh i do feel a bite dizzy
S0144	yeah
S0024	be that just cos i'm look up at it
S0144	maybe i don't know what the legal distance be now but
S0024	no i i do
S0144	i'm sure they have to make it bigger than it be
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean think about all the electromagnetic force
S0024	yeah so these be just electricity
S0144	yeah
S0024	just electricity
S0144	yeah
S0024	why can't they put them underground i just don't understand
S0144	underground
S0024	it look like it's fall down
S0144	you can't put them underground
S0024	those wire look like they're all fall down it's like a oh i don't like it
S0144	ha
S0024	i don't wanna i don't wanna walk underneath it
S0144	can you imagine how difficult it would be fix them if it be all underground how expensive it would be and grind and the grind move as well
S0024	yeah but like they put them in in the massive cable that they can put those massive cable case on it so it's very unlikely that there's gonna be a problem with the wire
S0144	er
S0024	er it make you dizzy doesn't it
S0144	it do yeah
S0024	that would make oh we didn't we forget the camera again
S0144	oh
S0024	oh why be we always forget the camera
S0144	dunno it's a good
S0024	cos that's quite a weird illusion it's make me dizzy
S0144	yeah

S0024	we could jog to yeah
S0144	shoot the pheasants again

S0024	well no you've get your car to protect you
S0144	quite daunt aren't they
S0024	yeah ah
S0144	what would we do without them though
S0024	well we wouldn't have any electric would we
S0144	yeah that would suck
S0024	now then here's another road look

S0144	mm that be one of those days that be just insane
S0024	and then we start laugh about it all and we be hurt so much weren't we

S0024	yeah they turn them off in the end didn't they oh god what arseholes though they but um well they think we be arseholes so there you go there you go
S0144	well
S0024	they think we be like we be the horrible people
S0144	we poach their land

S0144	yeah
S0024	attack by dog bag break get a lot really lose we end up walk for like thirteen hours didn't we
S0144	i think it be more than that
S0024	cos we start really early in the morning and we didn't get there till really late
S0144	yeah and that be walk with a lot of weight as well
S0024	yeah and a break bag
S0144	and a break bag
S0024	oh god oh well it's all good fun
S0144	yeah
S0024	we haven't be lose in a while it's about time we get lose again
S0144	i don't see how this hike lark be er it's not the most relax kind of holiday though be it it's suppose to be some peaceful retreat i always find it the most adventurous and dangerous
S0024	that's because you make it adventurous and dangerous by not take a map or not calculate distance or not worry about wild animals in the bush or something
S0144	when have i ever do that
S0024	you've gotta be prepare with your girl guide thing and your compass
S0144	yeah
S0024	i think it be ever since that trip actually ever since that trip i always take a compass with me
S0144	mm
S0024	and then even when i get lose in the towns i use to get my compass out they use to be like what be you do i be go well we're lose aren't we i'm gonna see which way i can't see the sun so i'm gonna see which way they be go wow that be very
S0144	very good that be very good
S0024	i remember well who be that that be there when i take my compass out in the middle of town cos that cos it be after that trip that i just keep it in my bag the whole all of the time because
S0144	yeah you should always have a compass on you
S0024	well i don't know you can usually tell
S0144	well it depend on what you do i suppose
S0024	you can usually tell where the sun be can't you at night i find it a bite harder because i know some star be like those planets and stuff some of them you know
S0144	yeah
S0024	but that depend on the time of year
S0144	yeah exactly it'd be alright if they didn't move
S0024	well at the moment you know they've get those er what be it venus in the east or something i think
S0144	they're all in the sky at the moment you've get jupiter
S0024	and then yeah jupiter's on the east
S0144	saturn you can even see
S0024	and it's saturn that's on the west no no no no no
S0144	mar venus mercury
S0024	yeah yeah it's saturn that's in the west but that's really late at night isn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	something like that but then they all change throughout the year
S0144	yeah
S0024	so how be you suppose to remember
S0144	i don't know
S0024	so compass be better i think a compass be easier
S0144	yeah well i think we need a compass more than most people cos we're always
S0024	get lose
S0144	er well that but we're always we're not we never stay in the same place for very long
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean we're always go off and do see different place and because we don't have a car we usually get drop off in the middle of nowhere
S0024	yeah
S0144	and have to walk twenty plus miles before we can have a drink
S0024	here you go look we're here we have to get to the village
S0144	be this
S0024	yeah but
S0144	well that wasn't very far
S0024	no it's not very far at all it's only one and a half miles
S0144	i think we'd be walk for hours
S0024	but we've get to cross the we've get to cross the bridge yet and then go
S0144	the bridge
S0024	go through the town
S0144	right
S0024	so see over there that's so it's a little bite further i'd say i don't know another
S0144	this isn't this be
S0024	yeah it's the same difference same thing
S0144	what the village have get two name
S0024	no it's just this little bite just before the other village
S0144	well we're not in the other village then be we
S0024	we're near enough it's near enough near enough

S0024	yeah i'd like that plot nice little piece of land
S0144	do you think it's for sale
S0024	yeah but we say
S0144	what would you do with woodland though i mean you couldn't do anything with it
S0024	no
S0144	it's a nice romantic idea
S0024	well i'd like um on my land one day in the future i'd like um
S0144	well i think we need a house first
S0024	yeah well i'd like a
S0144	well we need a job first
S0024	yeah well and then a piece of land a piece of land before house
S0144	yeah
S0024	you know you put the house on after but in in on my piece of land i'd like like a little bite of water whether it's a river or a lake or something this be this be my perfection
S0144	a river
S0024	a river or a lake
S0144	a river or a lake okay
S0024	yeah er not that fussy you see i can be flexible
S0144	yeah
S0024	a river or a lake a little bite of forest tree so that we can chop down the you know
S0144	tree
S0024	well so that we can chop down tree and rebuild tree
S0144	so you're gonna have a proper fireplace then
S0024	so that we can have a proper fireplace yeah
S0144	mm
S0024	so so that we can keep up to date with the fire and the log
S0144	yeah
S0024	you know cos if you want to live off the land as much as you can then you need that don't you you need a few tree
S0144	yeah mm well i'd like something like your dad's get set up as well where your your fire er heat all the water in the house as well
S0024	yeah yeah i'd love that
S0144	that's good that be
S0024	they've do that
S0144	er have that ever break
S0024	mm only that time the other week when cos they didn't put the
S0144	no that be the chimney that wasn't the system
S0024	well yeah the chimney flute well why would it break it's only heat the water pipe unless the water pipe burst and there's nothing to break i don't think
S0144	well i don't know i be just wonder if it's if it's something you have to regularly maintain or once you've get it set up it just run itself
S0024	i nearly crash here in the snow it be icy i nearly go into that ditch
S0144	yeah it's not a bad place to crash though mind be it
S0024	yeah i think it be this bend well it depend if you roll over
S0144	well it depend how fast you're go i suppose
S0024	oh oh
S0144	norfolk in general be not a very bad place to crash because there's no hill
S0024	yeah but still it depend if you roll over what else you hit and all sort of things there's not a good place to crash be it anyway yeah they're they're quite well set up especially with the coal and the wood and i'd like to do and they're do all the vegetables but they're still not live live off the land be they
S0144	yeah no
S0024	they're still reliant on so they're still reliant on so much from society
S0144	well yeah oh god it take a hell of a lot to cut yourself off
S0024	you can't can you you can't
S0144	it's virtually impossible
S0024	and and because you want to live this life of you know i'll do you a favour you do me a favour kind of thing
S0144	yeah
S0024	which be kind of what they've get around here but i don't know
S0144	yeah not a little bite
S0024	not too much but there be a little bite of it
S0144	only within their small circle of friends
S0024	they have here's my walnuts yeah
S0144	and well a couple of local farmers
S0024	yeah
S0144	but that's i don't know that all seem to be quite an older generation as well
S0024	yeah
S0144	i think because so many people have move in from er london and that i think that kind of thing be go to disappear
S0024	what they haven't get as many skills as the older people
S0144	no no that the the trade and the just the do favour for each other
S0024	yeah no i think that'll be come back that'll be alright
S0144	yeah well i hope so
S0024	mm
S0144	it should do
S0024	that's why you you
S0144	but i don't think it's gonna be promote though because that's not what the government want
S0024	no
S0144	they want people to buy shit
S0024	but i think the main thing for us be to find a nice when we when we try and look for somewhere to live if we ever do move back to england be to find a nice little community and we like i er that's gonna be like one of my major things be like go around the neighbour or something and find out what the community be like
S0144	yeah
S0024	because you don't want a house where you're neighbour be all nobody talk to each other or something like that that'd be awful wouldn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	nobody make each other the odd bite of jam at christmas or something or swap recipes or i don't know
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know i'll give you a bite a wood if you give me a chicken
S0024	yeah
S0144	oh i don't like this road
S0024	no it's a bite busy innit
S0144	cos they come fly around that corner don't they
S0024	yeah they do cos they like the bend hello
S0144	hiya
S0024	they like the bend i use to like the bend and this kind of cos there's not many not much traffic so you just go wee wee all the way
S0144	yeah it's okay until you get someone like us
S0024	walk along
S0144	walk in the middle of the road
S0024	yeah i'm not walk in the middle of the road and we get off the road if we hear them
S0144	right lane no that go to the
S0024	ah see that's the church that we haven't be to see we could go down there one day
S0144	yeah there's a bus stop there look
S0024	and there's no
S0144	be that a bus stop
S0024	no that's not a real bus stop no
S0144	i dunno what do it say
S0024	no it's not real
S0144	it's not real
S0024	no bus service currently operate in this area see tell you the nearest one's at the bell and then that's um there's one that go through there's only it's the number eight i think no no
S0144	oh
S0024	it go from to
S0144	you're really screw aren't you if you don't drive
S0024	yeah
S0144	and the you have to pay i don't know about six quid to go down the road
S0024	mm
S0144	go to any other country and that's the way poor people move about you've get all these little vans in between point and
S0024	yeah there'd be even though this be the middle of the country side there'd be
S0144	well in the countryside people who have pick up and they'd just stop where you'd be able to jump on the back
S0024	yeah well there'd be more people live in the countryside that's the thing there'd be people work on the farm and stuff like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	whereas here cos they've get all the machine they don't need people work on the farm do they so they haven't get anybody
S0144	yeah well and everyone's get enough money to get a car or get a car on credit at least
S0024	oh god do you know what have just go i can't believe this because she's so idealistic she's just like me i think she be just like me in my her opinions but obviously not she's just go and get a er ten grand loan from the bank she go oh it's really high interest but never mind
S0144	what
S0024	so well when be this land come up to auction cos the land that they want to buy that's come up to auction when be it come up to auction she say april it be like oh my god and when do this loan kick in now but we've get two weeks to think about it
S0144	what
S0024	i be like why be you get a loan now why don't you
S0144	why do they need a loan
S0024	well to buy this land that they wanna buy
S0144	oh god
S0024	ah i be like why do you wanna get a loan now why don't you get a loan in april
S0144	and they be allow to get a loan i think
S0024	no and because her credit rat be quite high because er you know they didn't er they borrow money before or they haven't have work in england for a while
S0144	yeah
S0024	their credit rat be quite low so she say that er the interest be quite high so i be think but why of all the solutions to like travel the world for ten years work work work to come back to england spend all your save then be look for land to buy and they've just come back and spend fifteen grand in two months
S0144	what
S0024	i mean that well that be their save wasn't it it's just whittle away by go out to dinner and stuff like that you know how it whittle away
S0144	well yeah
S0024	and a lot of it get take up when the cat be sick and they when they move all their stuff back on the boat that be a few thousand pound
S0144	mm mm
S0024	like to get all their stuff back on the boat and they've use up all their money but she's she's she work at the school this week actually
S0144	hmm
S0024	but er yeah they're do that but
S0144	ten grand what interest rate be it
S0024	ten grand i have no idea i be just i be speechless
S0144	that's gotta be pretty damn high
S0024	i though i mean i mean they've get loan before but that's irrelevant because now how they do it with the loan now be like all of the high interest rat they just get you
S0144	yeah
S0024	and it's just a payment every month
S0144	well it's just a
S0024	but she's tie herself down to british society
S0144	loan be for suckers aren't they i mean
S0024	yeah and i'd
S0144	i think people have wake up to that in general
S0024	yeah me too
S0144	i think them especially would stay it wouldn't even cross their mind
S0024	them especially especially i didn't think
S0144	take a grand loan
S0024	i didn't think it would
S0144	cos they'll be pay back like fifteen grand at least wouldn't they
S0024	yep and they get it all over the internet they didn't go and see a financial person or anything like that just get it all over the internet and claire be
S0144	well
S0024	even herself be like god i didn't think they'd give me a loan because of my credit rat but
S0144	huh oh they're so nice
S0024	yeah that's almost how it be i be i be
S0144	oh they give me all this money
S0024	cos if they beware of the bull where's the bull
S0144	oh great
S0024	can you see it but oh can you believe it what be we gonna say to them because i really disagree and i think they should get
S0144	well it's their choice
S0024	yeah but i don't want them to get in a muddle
S0144	well
S0024	can you imagine if we come back next time and they're all in a muddle
S0144	mm it do seem a bite foolish i have to say there's that um cos i be gonna lend money on that site
S0024	yeah
S0144	um that it's like a peer to peer lend site
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	where the the interest rat be a lot lower than the bank i've forget what it be call
S0024	ah you see we should have tell them about that
S0144	and then you can choose to pay it back over one two or three years or something
S0024	yeah
S0144	and it's literally the interest rat be half of that of the bank
S0024	be we still gonna do that
S0144	no cos i think with the economy about to crash then
S0024	it wouldn't be any good
S0144	you wouldn't get your er money back
S0024	ah
S0144	but i like the idea of cut out the bank and all of these loan shark
S0024	well they've get two weeks to go back on the loan
S0144	and do it person to person that's a nice idea
S0024	well i think i'll tell her about that i forget all about that
S0144	yeah but you should set that kind of thing up locally
S0024	yeah
S0144	like in your in your village if you've get a small like community
S0024	mm i hope they'll be alright
S0144	that'd be nice to do
S0024	it would be
S0144	cos that's that's what
S0024	but that's how a bank start isn't it and then they just get power hungry and just like isn't that how it start
S0144	yeah but that's what erm you know that's what a lot of these families do that's what chinese families do especially
S0024	yes yeah yeah yeah
S0144	they look after the family you know they lend each other money
S0024	yep yep
S0144	um i don't know if they charge interest on
S0024	not that much
S0024	up
S0144	you know but even if they do and they charge a lot less than the the best rat out there then you know that's how they they build their families up
S0024	mm yeah but they haven't get a family like that would
S0144	no i know mm
S0024	they've get some family that will help them
S0144	but ray's be work every day hasn't he for the last
S0024	yeah he's work really hard
S0144	i mean he's he'a get pretty decent money isn't he
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	so why do they need
S0024	well they say they be save some money now
S0144	i mean a deposit for this land they're look at be what thirty grand be it the guide price
S0024	that's the problem
S0144	whir er
S0024	that's a funny jeep they're all off to the club i reckon
S0144	yeah well thirty grand um that's the guide price it could go to like fifty
S0024	yeah it could go to fifty
S0144	and they still they still haven't be to the plan offices or or speak to anyone about what they can actually do with this land
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean if it's just a er a flood plane what be they gonna do with it if they buy it
S0024	well
S0144	i mean it it would be nice to own a little bite of land and it generally go up doesn't it
S0024	well i'm just hop it'll be alright for them cos they have be work you know 's work so he's work so hard
S0144	yeah i know he be
