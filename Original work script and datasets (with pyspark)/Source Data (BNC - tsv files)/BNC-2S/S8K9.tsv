S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean should we ask that before we go
S0144	well maybe we should send an email just
S0024	there's a few things you know
S0144	yeah i mean it's all be agree upon before
S0024	but i don't want to sound like a cow i don't want to sound like cos already there's be so many email especially from me say well what about this and what about that because because of
S0144	yeah well they haven't be very forthcoming with information
S0024	no no not at all and they it seem like they be quite offend by my question so it's like oh do you just take it on faith
S0144	yeah well it's quite a big thing just move half way across the world
S0024	yeah yeah they should understand that but if you look at erm who work in that department i mean there there's a lot of a lot of people from all over the world but from english speak countries you've get the indian lot and then erm you've get erm it look like somebody may be from eastern europe actually i think i don't know she look quite funky anyway er get all these colour and look really nice
S0144	mm huh
S0024	and er then i don't know there's there's the bloke at the top sound like he's get some sort of western name and then two women
S0144	okay
S0024	that's it
S0144	what in the department
S0024	well no and all the rest be from india or from oman or from the maybe a few other place
S0144	oh really so there's no other english people there
S0024	there's just it look like there might be three
S0144	okay
S0024	but they might who know where they're from i don't know
S0144	ah well it's time to get excite now though
S0024	there's probably well there probably be more there probably be more they've just get name that i don't recognize but like their recruitment thing it doesn't look like they're that experience with get people over it's not the colleges of technology and they're just like yeah get load and load of erm people from english speak countries to come
S0144	yeah mm
S0024	they seem this university seem more local we want to support the local i mean that's what they say on their thing
S0144	yeah
S0024	omanis get preference to anybody else apart from maybe the english language speak course
S0144	well that's good
S0024	yeah yeah yeah it should be interest the guy at the top i've forget his name now i be try to look at their name so that when we meet them i'll be able to remember at bite easier you know what it's like
S0144	yeah
S0024	you have like
S0144	well you get introduce by to a hundred people
S0024	forty yeah and then you're and then you have to try and remember everybody
S0144	and then you introduce yourself to someone and they say oh we've already meet
S0024	yeah
S0144	oh sorry
S0024	yeah so yeah i i might i might keep just have a look at the cos they've get the picture and the name and just every day have a look and read through you never know it might help when when it come to meet them in person
S0144	yeah
S0024	so yeah it's it's go to be excite
S0144	yeah
S0144	but you say that there's no direct flight
S0024	there's a direct well from what i can see there's a direct flight from gatwick
S0144	really that's strange i think heathrow would go
S0024	yeah there be the erm gulf air but gulf air have just be buy out by bahrain and they're not do the flight
S0144	gulf air's be buy out by
S0024	bahrain
S0144	bahrain
S0024	well it say something like that
S0144	really
S0024	well that might not be true it say something along those line i think that's what i read
S0144	oh so we're go to have to go to bahrain first
S0024	no there's plenty of airlines that go there but you know if you could take qatar air you stop in qatar and and then go to muscat if you take erm er i've forget the name the other big
S0144	emirates
S0024	emirates be that dubai
S0144	er
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah yeah it emirates stop in dubai and i'm really worry some of them be like four or five hours wait in the middle of the night
S0144	ouch
S0024	it's a longer flight than i think
S0144	mm
S0024	i think it be only six hours
S0144	be it longer than that
S0024	yeah it's at least eight
S0144	oh shit oh well the good thing i suppose be we're only gonna be work five miles from the airport
S0024	yeah i'm happy about that i'm glad we didn't take the salalah job like just the big
S0144	yeah that's quite nice just for go on holiday or come back here
S0024	yeah yeah or
S0144	don't have to piss about do we
S0024	and just have the big city so near
S0144	yeah and if
S0024	all the amenities that you can get in the bigger city than you can in a little place
S0144	if there's a direct flight to gatwick we can stay at your sisters'
S0024	yeah which be maybe what we should have tell them i don't know
S0144	yeah
S0024	we should have say whichever one's easiest
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know i think cos that omani air go from gatwick
S0144	mm
S0024	like the the price range be crazy it go from like er four hundred pound to british airways which be one thousand four hundred pound british airways be like three time the price of any of the others
S0144	yeah yeah british airways be expensive
S0024	yeah but none of the plane the i've never be on a really really good british airways plane
S0144	no i know they're rubbish
S0024	i think
S0144	the best ones be well the middle eastern ones
S0024	qatar
S0144	qatar emirates
S0024	yeah and i read about omani air and they seem alright too
S0144	they're nice yeah
S0024	but they do have like the second hand plan from the others but
S0144	do they serve alcohol on the on these ones
S0024	no doubt it
S0144	you need alcohol for an eight hour journey on a plane god i hate fly
S0024	but can you imagine like here's a possible scenario be that they pick us up from the airport and take us straight to the school that's a possible scenario
S0144	ah no surely not
S0024	and do you remember how wreck we be not wreck we be just really tire when we do that flight from thailand to korea
S0144	korea yeah
S0024	and we didn't know where we be we didn't know what we be talk about i i have no memory of it
S0144	no i think that's probably the most exhaust i've ever be in my life actually
S0024	yeah why
S0144	i don't know
S0024	why i don't know
S0144	i don't think the weather help either cos we go from about thirty degrees to to zero
S0024	ah it be cold yeah i remember that with that agent they lend us some money
S0144	we didn't have a coat do we
S0024	no we didn't even have any money
S0144	and then you get bird flu
S0024	or whatever it be yeah
S0144	it be a bite of a disaster that wasn't it
S0024	mm oh god yeah that be awful few weeks
S0144	yeah well well they're fly us on tuesday
S0024	yeah
S0144	so then we've only get wednesday before the weekend anyway
S0024	ah right so i i reckon they'll be alright actually
S0144	so wednesday they might just let us settle in
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	erm hopefully and
S0024	or pop into the school have a look around
S0144	yeah i hope they don't expect us to start teach on like the first day
S0024	erm i i don't think so i i think if they've get the class cover already then they're just go to say you know leave it this week
S0144	yeah i'd like some time just them kind of show us the rope at british council we get a week didn't we
S0024	mm mhm mhm yeah
S0144	i can't see them give us a week
S0024	more than that i think we get ten days induction didn't we
S0144	yeah i can't see that kind cos i don't they'd have an induction process in place cos like you say they're not use to fly people over
S0024	yeah but hopefully because the the act head of the department look like he's british or er or foreign anyway he should understand that the process you know of move abroad and stuff so hopefully he'll do something nice
S0144	mm yeah
S0024	oh god
S0144	well indian food
S0024	well you never know until you get there it could be a disaster or it could be wonderful
S0144	ah but proper food again though
S0024	food yeah yeah yeah i won't be cook for a while
S0144	and you've get all those hike as well and the turtle
S0024	yeah i think it will take us quite a while to go down
S0144	and frankincense
S0024	when when be the turtle season
S0144	it's all year i think
S0024	no it can't be
S0144	no
S0024	it must be one part of the year that they come up to the beach
S0144	no idea
S0024	yeah it should be explore again
S0144	yeah yeah it's go to be good isn't it
S0024	just worry about a house as well we have such a beautiful house in tunisia
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh such a beautiful house
S0144	well i'd be happy with an apartment like a modern apartment i think
S0024	i'd be happy with a modern apartment if we can get it furnish and if there's
S0144	yeah well it have we have to get it furnish
S0024	yeah yeah we will won't we
S0144	oh ah
S0024	if there's some sort of erm gym or hopefully a swim pool near by that would be nice because if you imagine how hot it be right it's go to be hard hard hard work for us to go you know explore in the market all day but you need some sort of refresh activity like swim
S0144	mm
S0024	and like all of their swim pool be go to have to be close off because you know and they'll they might even have women's hours and men's hours and we'll have to go separately
S0144	that's true
S0024	apart from in the big hotels
S0144	yeah
S0024	so
S0144	ah i hadn't think of that
S0024	yeah
S0144	and the same with the gym as well
S0024	yeah
S0144	might have men's hours and women's hours for that
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	they probably would actually wouldn't they
S0024	yeah unless they have erm or they might have two separate room
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah and i think we're gonna have a lot more of a divide lifestyle from what we're use to
S0144	yeah
S0024	we're use to do everything together
S0144	yeah well they've even get restaurants haven't they where you have to go in different room
S0024	yeah but we won't go in them they they haven't get that many in oman that's more of a a saudi thing
S0144	yes yeah well i think around muscat it will be fairly
S0024	yeah it's gonna be fairly open
S0144	fairly westernise
S0024	yeah i mean i've see i've see videos of tourists walk around there in their short and stuff
S0144	especially as we're near the airport
S0024	like typical tourists do
S0144	yeah
S0024	i wouldn't mind buy a few more outfit still look for a tunic can't find tunics anywhere here
S0144	mm
S0024	you know something that will go with all of my skirt or something cos that's important to feel comfortable isn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	at work straight away cos you know what you know people might not say anything but they judge they they don't mean to but you can't help judge people by how they look can do you
S0144	no you can't help it no
S0024	you if i'd like
S0144	it's quite important as a teacher to give the right image
S0024	if they didn't approve of something i be wear and i be only wear it because i didn't have anything else you know
S0144	yeah
S0024	say like our baggages didn't arrive or something i don't know and you turn up at school that's an immediate impression immediate
S0144	yeah
S0024	impression on you no matter what the circumstances so
S0144	what turn up in hot pant and smell of gin
S0024	well and drink on the plane
S0144	yeah and get duty free bottle clank
S0024	clank in the see through bag
S0144	hello
S0024	hello erm yeah yeah actually that's a good point on our erm hand luggage we should make sure we've get a a big bag
S0144	yeah we don't no i don't think we should buy any booze actually
S0024	really
S0144	well if we do it would have to go in the main luggage cos i'm not carry it
S0024	you can't put it in the main luggage
S0144	no when we get to the airport
S0024	you can't cos duty free be the other side so you've already check in your bag
S0144	no i mean when we arrive in muscat
S0024	oh there might be some just as you come out
S0144	or put the not so your not hold it in your hand
S0024	ah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah that's doable isn't it we can do that yeah yeah that will be alright they'll wonder what on earth they've get themselves into if we like totter off the plane with a couple bottle of gin each
S0144	mm
S0024	and we don't even drink that much we're just be prepare
S0144	it's get to last us all year
S0024	right so there's a couple of things we need to write to him about one be i'm really sorry but we don't want to stay in single accommodation at the school with the students
S0144	yeah no
S0024	share toilets with them
S0144	no
S0024	that's just sound like a a summer school
S0144	not when we first get there god no
S0024	that sound like a summer school to me and that sound like a nightmare
S0144	no i don't mind pay for a hotel until we find somewhere
S0024	well we're just go to have to forfeit the cost aren't we
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean they take they take some of the money off for that accommodation anyway it's not like they're give it to us for free
S0144	yeah yeah i saw that
S0024	yeah see we be treat so good before like er lot of people they don't understand that we're not get a free accommodation and stuff like that this time i mean it's not very friendly induction be it
S0144	no
S0024	it's not like you remember when we go to tunisia wow they're gonna help us out with a hotel for a week oh relax
S0144	yeah
S0024	it kind of calm you down a bite doesn't it let you
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh they're be so nice i mean and they they even say do you need any do you need to borrow any money we can get it for you right today and you can pay it off from your pay check i mean really really make it comfortable
S0144	yeah yeah here's salma she'll go through the newspapers and phone up all the all the landlords
S0024	yeah
S0144	and we've get a driver to take you around
S0024	yeah
S0144	we're not go to have any of that i don't think we be anyway
S0024	we'll be lucky if we if we do but er
S0144	yeah we just need to speak to as many people as we can cos that's the main thing for me be find a house as quickly as possible
S0024	well especially if we're pay for a hotel
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh my god
S0144	yeah the first three months be go to be pretty tough
S0024	i mean and if there's no hotels right near the college and we have to get a taxi every day or what you know i mean we won't know that until we arrive you know be there somebody in town who can pick us up and take us to work for a few like until we get settle
S0144	yeah yeah well that work itself out though doesn't it there's no point
S0024	yeah but taxis be hard to get in oman
S0144	mm
S0024	you don't wave them down it's not tunisia or it's not asia
S0144	can't you
S0024	it's they're not so many everybody have their own car so there's less taxis unless people drink you know in tunisia they still drink quite a lot didn't they and so they didn't want to drive or something and the women travel on there own quite a lot so you'd get a lot of the women get taxis and a lot of the students get taxis to school because like the whole family be work
S0144	well surely that's the same isn't it i mean how be the students go to get to school
S0024	they've probably all get their own cars they're they're university students cos you use to get the teenagers you know get taxis everywhere
S0144	mm oh i don't know but we'll see won't we
S0024	mm yeah there's no point speculate
S0144	no
S0024	find out when we get there but that be important that we can go home not home back to a place together and discuss our day and you know any woes that have come up or any good things we can talk about before the next day
S0144	yeah oh i agree i don't won't to be go into a dorm room
S0024	cos we're not yeah we won't even have a phone we won't even have a phone
S0144	yeah
S0024	right so be you gonna do that part
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	can you
S0144	yeah do what
S0024	email them
S0144	oh right yeah
S0024	yeah if you can email
S0144	oh what's that smell that's horrible
S0024	don't know all the drain have flood from the rain
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah should be fine it's just always go to be a bite worry isn't it
S0144	well of course it be
S0024	it's just this big break i think if we'd have go straight away then er it would be a different story wouldn't it
S0144	yeah yeah cos well i've slow right down just my think and everything
S0024	mm mm it's the whole pace of life
S0144	it's one because i haven't be do anything and two because i've be in the countryside where not much be go on
S0024	mm
S0144	and then we're go to be straight into a hundred miles an hour again
S0024	mm well we have to speed it up this week
S0144	how which way be you go
S0024	this way we'll have to speed it up a a little bite
S0144	have we get time to go this way it's get dark
S0024	yeah speed it up a little bite and i don't know keep busy cos our body be already already go to be in the shock of jet lag so yeah i don't want to feel it too much do you
S0144	what be you most look forward to about
S0024	i'm look forward to all the shop and the market market i just love souks even if it's a busy souk i don't care i just i just love the vibe
S0144	yeah
S0024	you know like the big big busy ones i can only do once a month or something but at least they're there if you want to
S0144	yeah what the big malls
S0024	no the massive souks
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	in the medina or something
S0144	i don't think they're go to be tourist market either so that's good
S0024	oman's become more popular as a tourist place
S0144	yeah but it's not go to be like tunisia where you just hassle
S0024	muscat will be no no i doubt it
S0144	i can't see that
S0024	yeah well i think they're quite chill out people aren't they
S0144	it's gonna be more authentic mm
S0024	well by the sound of it generalise yeah that's why i'm a bite worry about how my email have be take as well you know
S0144	yeah
S0024	they might be like what's she on about
S0144	i don't know dawn
S0024	you know she seem a bite highly string or something it's like i'm not really i'm usually fairly chill out yeah yeah the souk and i'm not look forward to the wide empty streets and i'm hop there's more tree on those streets than google show google doesn't show very many like remember in in carthage those er big streets but they have tree line them
S0144	yeah like boulevards yeah
S0024	they're beautiful really
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah that be a very residential area though
S0024	mm
S0144	i can't see this be so residential i think it's go to be lot of apartment block
S0024	apartments mm
S0144	intersect by fairly busy roads
S0024	yeah not well they've get the big villas but obviously we won't be able to afford a villa
S0144	i don't know it's funny isn't it what you you get the impression of somewhere before you've be there
S0024	mm
S0144	and then you get there a guess some of it get confirm but some it's just completely wrong isn't it
S0024	mm and then if you think tunisia still have a lot of apartment block and lot of people we know live in apartment block
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm i'm not sure at all there's just no information about i mean i've see some lovely little picture people play football on the beach and stuff like that but then the beach be empty apart from a few footballers it's like well
S0144	yeah i don't think they'll be many women on the beach
S0024	no i would love erm i would love that we we manage to find somewhere with a little private part that i can sit out in the sun with my short on or something
S0144	mm
S0024	i'm not too fuss about sunbathe with a bikini or that's okay i can deal with that and if we want we can go to a hotel to do that if we really want to
S0144	yeah
S0024	but i what i miss from tunisia be erm you know a little private garden space or or a big enough balcony sit and sit with your short on nobody can see you
S0144	mm
S0024	and you can sit and there's enough room for a table so you can sit and play card or you can sit and listen to music you can sit and eat your breakfast breakfast i'd love to have breakfast on on a balcony
S0144	yeah
S0024	it sound like i'm a right snob now well that's what i would like to aim for i don't know
S0144	so you're not look at an apartment then you're look at er like a little villa
S0024	well there's plenty of apartments where you know it might be overlook a big wide space so nobody can actually see you anyway
S0144	yeah
S0024	so that be possible i'm i'm not go to strip off i'm not gonna do what what somebody do in what one of our friends do and sunbathe neigh on naked on her roof think that nobody be watch them and then the builders wake up to four builders on the other build star at her i shan't be do that oh and erm
S0144	yeah
S0024	shall we email and say hello we're come you know
S0144	mm
S0024	i mean i know he doesn't like in seeb but it will be nice because there's the british council crowd
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then we've get who i'd like to meet and that's the muscat college
S0144	yeah
S0024	not muscat muscat college of technology crowd
S0144	yeah
S0024	so that's a few contact it's nice to have isn't it
S0144	yeah it's nice to have a couple people there
S0024	mm
S0144	i'm just look forward to the food
S0024	i know you be
S0144	and the location i mean you're only a short flight from india really
S0024	yeah
S0144	and dubai
S0024	see
S0144	dubai's just down the road
S0024	yeah and dubai yeah four hours drive that be isn't it
S0144	mind you that be just a big shop centre isn't it
S0024	what i'm hop be that they do some sort of girly activities like they're if they've get the whole indian culture there there should be a yoga class do you think
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	oh i hope
S0144	oh definitely
S0024	i just really hope there will be yeah i can't see why there wouldn't be
S0144	no they've yeah they've get a massive indian community there's go to be erm yoga
S0024	yeah but the only girls
S0144	probably all the different type
S0024	yeah
S0144	they'll probably be like ayurvidic stuff as well
S0024	yeah there be already i've already find my ayurvidic shop i have they do all sort of therapies and i reckon we're gonna live just round the corner
S0144	right
S0024	yeah i'm excite about that that part of it
S0144	yeah
S0024	that side of it we just didn't mind you we think we'd get belly dance and drum in tunisia and it wasn't really belly dance class or anything be there
S0144	belly dance it's not tunisian
S0024	no i know but they take a lot of the they they do have belly dance
S0144	yeah only in the tourist hotels
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	it's nothing to do with tunisia
S0024	no but

S0024	yeah but you want to take them home and practise oh that's another thing about the house
S0144	mm
S0024	you know something fairly soundproof so that we can play our music and and not have to if we're watch a movie ah turn it down ah turn it up ah turn it down do you remember
S0144	yeah that's important for me yeah
S0024	ah that use to be such a nightmare and creep not creep around but it's just
S0144	you're just aware of it all the time aren't you
S0024	yeah aware of somebody else hear you after after say do you like kung fu movies i be like no why she say oh it always sound like you're watch kung fu movies i be like what i don't know where that come from
S0144	no
S0024	i don't even like action film but there's always some sort of big loud clatter involve somewhere along the line
S0144	i suppose any movie no mm
S0024	kung fu i have to write to and tell her what we're up to
S0144	yeah yeah yeah i miss
S0024	and the kid we should send them
S0144	yeah
S0024	i'll wait until we get our well i'll write an email say we're go when if we finally get these ticket and then erm yeah i'm not count see i can't get excite yet
S0144	yeah there's just be so many up and down hasn't there
S0024	it feel like i it feel like it's time to get excite and i have be but
S0144	yeah but i've i've get so excite literally three or four time and then go again cos we get other news and it's just like what it's be up and down up and down hasn't it
S0024	there be that day yeah
S0144	so i don't want to allow myself to get too up before i'm on the plane really
S0024	no there's several things that i'm a little bite worry about to be honest like i i reread the email of the offer
S0144	right what the second offer
S0024	and you know the second offer and you know how they up it by a hundred omani rial
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah and but there's all this write underneath it say ah but this be subject to you be available to start in february term if not it may it it will be
S0144	really
S0024	i don't understand it all it's a load of babble underneath and can you imagine if we get there after all this time and they go sorry we're cut your wage it would just like you can't do that and if they point out the clause so this this if we're really really tire when we get there and they shove a contract under our nose and say sign it
S0144	well surely no i mean mm mm mm
S0024	we're go to have to say i'm go to take this back and read it over night
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	we've just to have that
S0144	oh definitely
S0024	you can't trust people these days it's sad to say but you just can't like we've get in trouble so many time
S0144	what do you mean these days
S0024	well not these days i don't know well we've just get we're too trust
S0144	no well it's an important thing isn't it
S0024	i like to be trust because i like to have faith in people but i think you you have to check everything
S0144	you can't jump in blindly that's foolish
S0024	no yeah i know yeah but you know what it's like where if you're really tire off the plane here's your contract it's exactly the same as before and then everybody stand around you wait for you to sign it so
S0144	yeah well it's happen before hasn't it yeah
S0024	like oh oh oh and you're read it yeah and if you're really tire you can't pick out all the detail yeah i'm a little bite worry something like that might go wrong but
S0144	well we'll cross that bridge when we get to it
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's not go to stop us go now be it
S0024	no no i mean i i don't want to even know about it at the moment because i don't want to change my mind about go
S0144	no well with big things like this you know there's always an element of fear involve and you've either get to say i'm not go to do it or you do it
S0024	mm
S0144	and we've always do it before and it's always work out
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	and we've get no alternatives cos we're not exactly stay here
S0024	no well we're not now cos we turn down that job so it's obvious we didn't want to stay
S0144	yeah exactly we don't in our hearts
S0024	deep down
S0144	yeah we don't want to
S0024	yeah
S0144	i've still get a couple of years of adventure leave in us yet
S0024	yeah
S0144	i think this might be the last one though
S0024	yeah could be well hopefully we're be able to save a bite of money at the same time so that we can come back or
S0144	well that's the thing isn't it we can't come back at the moment
S0024	well we could it's possible but i reckon we'd be break
S0144	well we could but yeah
S0024	even if we have a good job it would be tough start up that's the problem here it's tough start up
S0144	mm
S0024	but then it's tough go over there and find apartments and stuff
S0144	yeah but it's more excite isn't it
S0024	yeah it's more excite than like move to cambridge or move to oxford or
S0144	yeah i don't know i quite like be in a position where it's quite i don't know quite scary or quite full on
