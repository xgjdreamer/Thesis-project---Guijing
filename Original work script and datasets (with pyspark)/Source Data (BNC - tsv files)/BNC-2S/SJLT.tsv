S0041	and now it's mine
S0084	huh
S0041	yeah i mean it's quite it's quite tight like i can only just fasten it but hopefully by
S0084	that's fine though
S0041	wed time i'll be an inch smaller
S0084	that look really good you but you can button it do you know what i mean like
S0041	just
S0084	you don't need to worry about not button it
S0041	yeah i might worry about move
S0084	breathe in and out
S0041	after all the dinner
S0084	well well just generally yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	but um after all the dinner and all the dance
S0041	mm yeah
S0084	oh mate it look really nice i like the colour together
S0041	it's shoe time tomorrow huh
S0084	shoe yay
S0041	shoe time shoe time so how do the meet go
S0084	er actually it be really good yeah it be really good um tut one of those meet where everyone come away with point which be what i want really i didn't want to feel like we be gang up on him and say you didn't do this you didn't do that why do they do this why do er they do that as project manager i think it be really useful for him to be able to say well how about we do it this way cos it's sort of the end of two project but we've get four more to finish off and then two more come so we need to get it right
S0041	nip it in the bud now yeah
S0084	but be be a er a big learn curve for everybody
S0041	oh that's good
S0084	so it be really useful it be er good it go on longer than i think it would cos everyone have more to say than i think they would so i think generally it actually be quite a productive meet
S0041	sound like everyone want the meet everyone seem to have something to
S0084	everyone want the meet everyone bring stuff to the meet which i think be good you know it wasn't just that i'd compile all of the feedback and then people be just like yeah right well you do all the talk we're just gonna sit here like
S0041	mm
S0084	i think even though no one have actually respond to me so i didn't know if anyone actually would come with anything to say i think that's what i be most nervous about that no one have really respond so i'd send out the agenda and i'd send out the talk point and i guess just cos everyone's really busy but in their head they be like yep great gonna bring stuff to talk about tut um so yeah it be good yeah
S0041	ah
S0084	i'm just i'm just knackered really
S0041	i'm very knackered
S0084	really tire
S0041	very knackered in the world in the worm
S0084	in the worm
S0041	um and i find a really nice bra
S0084	in tesco's
S0041	er no in in jasper conran today
S0084	yeah
S0041	tut and then it turn out that they only go up to a double d
S0084	oh
S0041	then i go all the way to mark and spencers after find a this colour orange one online
S0084	mm
S0041	turn out they only go up to a double d
S0084	tut in where m and s
S0041	yep huh
S0084	what's with that shit
S0041	i've no idea
S0084	have that always be the case
S0041	well the only bra that i have from mark and spencers be the one i've get on
S0084	yeah
S0041	but it's too it's too big round the back cos it's a thirty eight
S0084	right yeah that would be too big yeah
S0041	but i mean it look very nice it's fine for work it's it's really comfortable cos obviously it's too big
S0084	yeah
S0041	which be fine under my work dress cos it doesn't really matter
S0084	yeah
S0041	um tut but in the ordinary
S0041	i mean you can't see it too bad but er i just i can just see like you see the bump
S0084	yeah
S0041	i just don't want the bump
S0084	well you're gonna have to get a t shirt bra then and t shirt bras aren't attractive
S0041	no they're not
S0084	so if you're gonna go for pretty that's what's gonna happen cos it's gonna be
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's gonna have detail in it which i think be fine i don't think it's a problem
S0041	huh
S0084	so these be
S0041	so
S0084	but those be your choices i think
S0041	it's either this as it be now
S0084	mm
S0041	or if i find another one which be gonna have to be bravissimo tomorrow
S0084	or or you don't have the strap so you have like a sort of basque thing push it up and hold it in
S0041	tut
S0084	you know like your zip up
S0041	try this er try the basques
S0084	mm
S0041	but then because they go on your hips and kind of stick forward a bite don't they
S0084	mm
S0041	then you can see a line around the bottom of the dress
S0084	tut right
S0041	cos they're not none of them be you know like my that one's
S0084	mm
S0084	yeah
S0041	the they've all get bone in
S0084	right
S0041	which you can see
S0084	what about the zip up one be that not an option
S0041	no cos the zip ripple
S0084	mm
S0041	like doesn't hold cos that's too big now too
S0084	mm
S0041	doesn't stay down
S0084	tut right
S0041	so as i move it wriggle up
S0084	tut not what you want this be a very difficult dress to buy for
S0041	tut i know but i now have this and i think although i know you do have hatred for the snakeskin
S0041	um i could get a black snakeskin this and black bag
S0084	mm
S0041	or there be a nice black and cream one at jasper conran but it be thirty pound
S0084	yes
S0041	and huh this be all kind of start to rack up now
S0084	yes what with the shoesies
S0041	yeah
S0084	and bargainous dress and jacket let's be honest like both of those for less than fifty quid or whatever it be
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's pretty nice
S0041	yeah that's pretty awesome
S0084	bang on fifty quid
S0041	yeah
S0084	like it's pretty nice
S0041	so
S0041	and shoe
S0084	and shoe
S0041	will be sixty four cos i think i have er a gift voucher for topshop that's about four quid or something
S0084	nice nice
S0041	but then i've still get jewel to buy and bag to buy
S0084	yeah so it's gonna be like probably look at a hundred and fifty quid aren't you for a birthday outfit which be fine because normally a dress would cost that
S0041	in the grand scheme of things
S0084	so
S0041	pretty awesome
S0084	yeah compare to
S0041	but
S0084	what's go before
S0041	yeah i can't think of where to else to get a bag from though i could i could actually get one from debut in debenhams for about fifteen i reckon
S0084	mm
S0041	just a plain clutch
S0084	mm
S0041	plain black clutch which be fine at least i'd use a plain black clutch again cos i don't have one
S0084	yeah well i mean they're you know completely versatile aren't they whereas if you get a mock croc one then you're gonna have to
S0041	for the wed for the wed for the wed can i get one of those hat things with the net that come over
S0084	the fascinator yeah
S0041	yes
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	i want one of those a black one black shoe black bag black fascinator
S0084	well that's what i be
S0041	can i have one
S0084	that's what i be gonna go for because
S0041	yes
S0084	um tut my dress er whichever one i wear will need black accessories
S0041	yes okay
S0084	so
S0041	oh i've think of the big hat with the floppy rim
S0084	er yeah well that'd be quite good for the wed because probably it's gonna rain
S0041	huh flopper
S0084	the flopper cos the ones that we saw in h and m that be floppy have like a black ribbon round them didn't they
S0041	tut i've have the
S0084	so that would be fine
S0041	yeah flop flop flop
S0084	floppy
S0041	i think actually they might've do one this colour the black
S0084	yeah that's what i mean
S0041	mm
S0084	like that sort of um so that would actually match
S0041	the flop flop

S0041	after you can see on my bank account i've put a hundred in then i put two hundred in and they've just keep charge and charge
S0084	but charge for what though cos you
S0041	for over your overdraft
S0084	but you're in your
S0041	limit

S0041	which be where i be and then this thirty two go out for i think be my
S0084	mhm
S0041	car hire forty for the car tax i don't know what this be but
S0084	yeah
S0041	basically the interest go on at eight pound and that's
S0084	mm
S0041	how i go over my overdraft limit
S0084	tut
S0041	with an eight pound
S0084	but they should've
S0041	thing
S0084	they should've flag that really if they're any kind of responsible bank they should've flag that your interest charge be gonna send you into your over er
S0041	yeah
S0084	over your overdraft
S0041	and then because i be over my overdraft it must be something have happen before there's a sixty pound charge
S0084	shit
S0041	to which i be like holy fuck sixty pound be you take the piss and he be like no i say fine i'll pay the sixty pound in
S0084	yeah
S0041	and he say actually you've get another one due come um so
S0084	shit
S0041	for a for a hundred and thirty two so you might as well put more in than that to cover it so i put in the two hundred and twenty three
S0084	right
S0041	um then
S0084	then they take a hundred and fifty pound
S0041	no no no that's me move a hundred and fifty pound
S0084	oh right
S0041	um which mean that i be short because i didn't expect any bank charge ever of be a hundred and thirty quid so i put
S0084	shit
S0041	i put this in
S0084	yeah
S0041	think right i'm back up to scratch now
S0084	yeah
S0041	i can spend some money no i can't spend money because on the twenty first a hundred and thirty two quid one one charge i be like what the fuck i don't know what that return bounce be i don't know what that be either way and then another one of sixty pound and then the latest one of a hundred and eighty
S0084	fuck me
S0041	yeah
S0084	so this isn't where your salary go
S0041	no
S0084	jesus
S0041	thank fuck
S0084	or well i mean if your salary be go in at least it would be pay it so this be like save and old account be it or something
S0041	old current account
S0084	that you just need to clear at some point
S0041	yeah
S0084	shit the bed
S0041	i mean i've i
S0084	that be disgust
S0041	transfer money in and out of it all the time every month all the time
S0084	just to keep you within
S0041	all these pay out all these paids out account account account account be all go to my other natwest account
S0084	mm
S0041	that's the thing the worst part of this be they have my salary pay into another account they know exactly how much i earn exactly how much my rent be
S0084	mm
S0041	exactly how much i spend
S0084	mm
S0041	every month
S0084	mm
S0041	and they think that's okay
S0084	what what be
S0041	a hundred and eighty quid a hundred and thirty two quid
S0084	where what be that base on like what kind of agreement be that
S0041	i don't know that's not my agreement that's something they've do
S0084	cos with hsbc if i go over my overdraft it's thirty five pound
S0041	yeah well i think
S0084	which i think be extortionate but sixty a hundred and eighty
S0041	it use to be twenty eight pound and so when he say sixty i just think oh two lot of twenty eight pound fine
S0084	yeah fuck me a hundred and eighty quid
S0041	for one charge
S0084	be you gonna you're just gonna have to speak to them and say what the hell do you think you're do i mean really it doesn't seem like this account be do you any favour
S0041	no
S0084	if you've already get another account that your salary's go in and out of if you're have to put money in and move money out you don't wanna be move any money out you wanna pay this off
S0041	well yeah course i do
S0084	particularly
S0041	but when you're earn what i'm earn there's no way i'm pay off five hundred pound be there
S0084	yeah right
S0041	there's no way i'm pay off the extra four hundred full stop
S0084	well absolutely the bank charge be disgust but really what they what your bank if they be responsible would be say to you be you've get an account where you've get a basic salary come in use that as your current account and very slowly over the months decrease it so you're
S0041	yeah
S0084	pay of your interest pay off more than that pay off like fifty quid every month whatever you can afford
S0041	well if you look at the account
S0041	not now but if you look at this
S0084	yeah
S0041	account before i start
S0084	that's what you're do
S0041	the last job my salary use to get pay in here
S0084	oh i see okay
S0041	cos the other one be interest free overdraft and the reason
S0084	right
S0041	i stop it get pay in here be because they fuck me over do the exact same thing about six months ago
S0084	right
S0041	so when i move the new job i stop it cos they'd fuck me over you know when i be bank card
S0084	mm
S0041	and the bank fraud and
S0084	mm
S0041	all that shit
S0084	mm
S0041	so i stop money go in here cos before that's what i be do cos the other one's interest free
S0084	tut the bank fraud yeah
S0041	so i've never have to worry about this
S0084	god i'd forget about all that
S0041	yeah
S0084	when you couldn't access any money for like two months
S0041	i didn't have a bank card before that
S0084	yeah
S0041	for eight months because they fuck me over again
S0084	jesus you need to get rid of natwest i mean i really do think i dunno what what happen when you move bank cos i've never do it i've always be with hsbc who be money grab bastards but i think you should shop around go to someone like santander or halifax
S0041	well i can't move can i cos i i owe i owe them two grand
S0084	yeah but you'll just move the debt
S0041	can't move two grand
S0084	i don't know
S0041	there's nobody gonna give me an overdraft now
S0084	i mean you've not really get any credit rat but i think what you need to do
S0041	what what do you just say
S0084	you haven't get any credit rat have you cos you owe you've get load of debts you can't get like mortgage or anything
S0041	oh yes i have horrendous credit rat
S0084	yep like as in
S0041	horrendous
S0084	you have no good credit
S0041	yes correct
S0084	um tut um
S0041	my dad get my dad get a debt collector letter apparently that's nice
S0084	yeah i've get
S0041	wait for him to forward that
S0084	i've get one of those
S0041	mm
S0084	um huh it's fine six years it'll be fine
S0041	that's what i reckon it's come up soon
S0084	yeah mine be for a new look account card when i be silly but my i think mine's finally be write off now
S0041	mine's an hsbc credit card
S0084	brilliant
S0041	mm
S0084	i suppose er what you need to do be go into the branch and just say what the fuck do you think you're cos you really wanna be speak to a human
S0041	yeah
S0084	and just say do you think that
S0041	well i've speak to this guy before every single time i've have a complaint
S0084	mm
S0041	it's be the past three years with one bank manager
S0084	mm
S0041	and his name's i know him he's shit at life
S0084	clearly or be and he's the
S0041	and he's the escalator to his boss to the regional boss and to
S0084	yeah
S0041	their head office in
S0084	jesus so they're
S0041	for this account
S0084	so they're very aware of this and yet they think that this be acceptable
S0041	yeah it's get to the point where i'm think like in actual fact i should just report you to the ombudsman and let them get on with it because this be out of control
S0084	yeah
S0041	i can't every three months be deal with some type of shite
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0041	and the best one the kicker be i can't even get to see this guy cos he doesn't work weekend he only work monday to friday nine to five
S0084	awesome so
S0041	yeah
S0084	the shift that you work then yeah
S0041	yeah pretty much yeah
S0084	good huh
S0041	mm
S0084	that's really helpful um oh i'd have think they
S0041	so
S0084	because that can't be legal i mean have you keep any of your bank arrangements
S0084	anything that say what your interest arrangement be
S0041	god no
S0084	be there er have you get internet bank
S0041	check it out liz i've have this since i be sixteen
S0084	be there um yeah er i'm you know i'm mental i keep all that shit mainly for this reason
S0041	yeah mm
S0084	but er have you get internet bank
S0041	mm
S0084	yeah maybe there's maybe i've never look but maybe in there because i've go paperless so i never get er paper
S0041	yeah i have
S0084	bank statements so maybe in that case they keep all of that electronically on your
S0041	account
S0084	account so maybe you can
S0041	maybe
S0084	access what your interest arrangement be on there
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i would try and find that out before you go in tomorrow cos then at least you can
S0041	oh no i'm not go in i'm put it all in write
S0084	okay
S0041	cos there's no way i'm deal with somebody now for them to say you've not do it cos they've shoot me in the foot so many time
S0084	whatever it be that you do i would make sure that you know what your arrangement be so that you can put it in in the letter or
S0041	mm
S0084	say it to their face
S0041	well they should have it as well shouldn't they when i sign it
S0084	oh they'll have it on record
S0041	initially they'll have it somewhere
S0084	but it just seem that when you're write the letter you can say this be illegal
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i will be take it up to my ombudsman i'm copy them in i'm send a letter to this person i'm you know
S0041	mm
S0084	i'm escalate this to this person because
S0041	a hundred and eighty pound for do you even know that exist
S0084	i can't no i tell you mine's thirty five pound
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's it
S0041	mine be mine be twenty eight
S0084	if you're in by two pound if you're over if you're over by five hundred pound it's thirty five pound
S0041	the worst one i've ever hear be halifax will charge you a pound a day that's thirty quid it's certainly not a hundred and eighty that that that be something like five pound a day ain't it
S0084	yeah the but the thing be the bank will charge you an instant fee for for break term of your
S0041	the term yeah
S0084	in of your overdraft and then they will charge you an interest rate so that but how can that be different how can that be a hundred and eighty pound but it be a hundred and thirty two pound but it be sixty pound
S0041	because the amount i'm over my overdraft limit be increase so every time they're put a charge on they're take
S0084	yeah so that's not but that's not the interest that's not interest be it a hundred and eighty pound
S0041	no but the percentage
S0084	yeah but that can er that can never be the percentage
S0041	i think they're work this out
S0084	though can it
S0041	yeah course it can cos if my limit's
S0084	unless er unless it's er
S0041	five hundred and then at this point where they charge me a hundred and thirty two
S0084	yeah
S0041	i'm over my overdraft limit by a hundred and thirty eight pound so perhaps i mean i don't know cos i'm not very good at maths but perhaps a hundred and thirty two be the initial charge plus
S0084	the interest
S0041	a percentage of how much you're over because i'm only over a hundred and thirty eight pound it's a percentage of that against the five hundred because obviously once they put another charge on and i'm four hundred pound over
S0084	well that would be the explanation but that interest rate be fuck huge
S0041	isn't it
S0084	that's like fifty percent
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's not three percent or six percent
S0041	no
S0084	or whatever be the standard
S0041	that's like nutty on the tv loan
S0084	yeah
S0041	payday thing
S0084	yeah yeah yeah apr that's like twelve you know two thousand percent
S0041	and my interest on there
S0084	you need to work that out
S0041	on the account usually be like really low that's why i've always keep it and always pay it off
S0084	we need to work it out
S0041	and the kicker be that if they if they look back on my account
S0084	yeah huh
S0041	be if they take out every single error that's be theirs i've always be really good with it always keep on top of it always
S0084	it's weird
S0041	always pay it back over the month as you're suppose to cos i want to my credit rat up
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	and any time it's ever go over or there's be a problem it's be their error
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean this isn't their error this be them just be unbelievable
S0084	i think it be their error because i just can't see how that can be a charge even if it's the initial charge for break your overdraft agreement and then the interest there's no way that it can be a hundred and eighty pound in the space of not even four months cos that's only one charge or maybe it's two charge that's the conversation that you remember have
S0041	mm
S0084	the guy say you've get another charge due but accord to this you've only go over your overdraft that one time so unless it's something historical
S0041	i have no idea
S0084	i mean what you need to go and do be go back and trace you know the last sort of six months nine months a year and total how many time you've break your overdraft and total what they've take from you
S0041	mm
S0084	and tot it up and try
S0084	as much as possible to find what your um what your term be
S0041	i'm gonna take this dress off yes that's gonna be a fun game
S0084	that's gonna be a shit game
S0041	isn't it
S0084	print it all off at work or if you want me to print stuff send it to me tomorrow
S0041	that's a i print it er i print that for that's as far as i can get online without go into historic transactions and i didn't
S0084	and er
S0041	try that i just do it quickly
S0084	oh okay well you can on er
S0041	so
S0084	on my one you can go back a certain amount and then you have to ask them and then they charge you
S0041	that's what i've gotta do i've get four months if i want any more i've get to ask and they'll charge me
S0084	oh huh
S0041	cack
S0084	that's really cack
S0041	completely forget where it be despite the fact i live just off it
S0084	yeah yeah yeah that one
S0041	and make and drive to

S0084	oh okay
S0041	mm
S0084	fine
S0041	but insider info be that if they be gonna do it they would've do it by now which um which remind me jane tell me two days ago that they might be strike again i think how do she know that and now i realize they must've call in her
S0084	mm
S0041	son in law
S0084	mm
S0041	cos he's army
S0084	okay
S0041	so i would gather that he's probably be call in to do the same train
S0084	mm
S0041	but i don't know cos i haven't hear from him so that's the end of that story
S0084	ah i wanna drive a tank
S0041	me too i think i will get to
S0084	mm
S0041	i think i get all the licence
S0084	huh that's awesome then you could be a trucker
S0041	uh huh a mother trucker
S0084	mm mother trucker that's what i need to be
S0041	mhm
S0084	cos the marine that i be sort of see when i be in plymouth mark he get all his hgv licence when he be in the marines
S0041	mhm
S0084	and he then he now do every winter um the thing the salt spread
S0041	mm
S0084	on the ice and they pay you some ridiculous amount of money so he he go out he be kick out of the marines
S0084	bite of a shady character it turn out um
S0041	it turn out expect no less
S0084	er indeed fuck animal
S0084	so he's now take sunbeds round to people's house so that they can cook themselves in the comfort of their own home
S0084	and get the cancer
S0084	and then he collect
S0041	huh this will be a perfect little sunbed
S0084	there you go winner so and then in the even he go and grit the roads and he can earn like fifteen grand in a winter just from go out at night i'm like but you work all day he's like yeah so when do you sleep oh you know sort of catch fifty wink here and there so you pull up on the side of the road have a bite of a nap and then carry on it's basically just
S0041	fine
S0084	as much as you wanna do they just pay you for the work that you do
S0041	oh wow that's fine
S0084	mm yeah basically um speak to my dad about navy seal to find out you know if they're marines they're not marines they're our special force they're like more scary than the marines and i be watch gi jane
S0041	er yeah
S0084	so the navy seal be like the elite elite elite and apparently they train them how to break people's neck like they're the most scary violent er area
S0041	er
S0084	like they're the they're the elite like above so the navy seal
S0041	above marines
S0084	above marines so marine commandos
S0041	huh
S0084	be the ones that you have here and they're above them
S0041	oh i do not think that
S0084	they're the secret special ones and apparently you know er the ones that go in and kill er osama bin lade they're navy seal and you don't get girls don't get girls
S0084	so yeah they're um apparently in the after the second world war they set up special sas like special force um and then special boat force like the like the navy version but it's like er a wing of the marine commandos but like the elite version of them like the like one percent of them and they rise up the rank and they train them basically
S0041	oh shit
S0084	in kill people that's essentially what you be you're like a train assassin
S0041	like assassin
S0084	tut yeah so it's a bite serious so i don't really think you should be sign yourself up for that and i don't know whether the film really depict what it be that they do and apparently they're the most loyal like they're the most er head brainwash like they will follow
S0041	mm
S0084	an order to the letter like they will not question it and basically the officer who be there they don't do the dogsbody work they're not the ones that actually go round kill people they're the ones who sort of put the plan in motion
S0041	brainwash
S0084	yeah and they yeah they do all the brainwash so the people who do it carry out order without question so um and i don't think there's much come back from that like
S0041	no
S0084	how could you then live in society again after have do those sort of things
S0041	no i think
S0084	you'd be completely
S0041	you probably that's the end of the road there
S0084	that's game over
S0041	that's pretty serious
S0084	yeah

S0084	where you make jam but like a cool trendy one but i don't
S0041	i like the idea
S0084	i haven't really get to the bottom of what she expect people to do i think mainly just drink wine which be fortunate because i quite like that
S0041	yes and but they're the whole point of the the wi be that you have to be very active in the community don't you
S0084	do you
S0041	like it's quite a
S0084	have to make a calendar for when you're
S0041	philanthropic thing i think

S0041	fine
S0084	and just bitch about everybody in the community

S0084	i think it's be actually what we do already apart from the jam

S0084	we know that we're we don't need to do those class we just need to drink the wine which this be the one who's think she's a trendy shoreditch person so i think she might be quite annoy
S0041	oh no
S0084	mm yeah she's a bite of a trendy londoner type that you wanna
S0041	huh
S0084	punch in the face she's the one that be knit the cover for the antlers

S0084	oh they're not go with him they're go to see him
S0041	yes
S0041	yes that's exactly what i say you know ish um
S0084	so just clarify that's fine that's all they seem to do isn't it go to gigs so all er all she be er be a glorify gig attendee
S0041	gig ticket getter and
S0084	mm
S0041	then something else drop that they're go to see cos 's put his cv forward for one of the agencies in that he work for so have him and have sit together and rejigged his cv about and write his portfolio
S0084	mm

S0084	mm okay well no not not that desirable then in that case
S0041	no huh um cos he live there er during the week and cos he work in
S0084	mm
S0041	during the week something blah and i think oh well this be come er this be come good now so basically this be all very convenient cos she get you ticket to gigs
S0084	mm
S0041	and she's her dad's get a place in and she already know your best friend and
S0084	yeah
S0041	i think oh lovely

S0041	um
S0084	your bed's look really good
S0041	that bowl right next to my pillow's my favourite part
S0084	i'd be interest to know how long you've be there
S0041	since i come home
S0084	oh right not
S0041	not that bad not my usual um so er hospital jamas live in the bottom drawer
S0084	right
S0041	for when it's hospital time
S0084	alright i'll bear that in mind
S0041	just so you know um yeah cos i i say to him
S0084	mm
S0041	actually if you want dental work the cheapest place to do it be turkey and their standards of dentistry be much higher than ours poland and turkey be the best place in europe for dentists
S0084	oh okay
S0041	the cost be in england two grand for an implant it cost five hundred pound there
S0084	sweet
S0041	yeah
S0084	so even with the flight you're laugh
S0041	yeah and they basically know you're come and they'll book they'll book time um
S0084	mm
S0041	for you go
S0084	mm
S0041	and have it do there and then so there's no have a consultation and go away and then find out that you do need some work do blah blah blah
S0084	yeah
S0041	they just book like five hours off in the morning and just do it all
S0084	amaze
S0041	so huh it's
S0084	yeah my uncle do that his his ex wife be kosovan and he go and have all of his teeth do in kosovo cos they've get a national health service there so you just pay a little bite
S0041	mm
S0084	of money towards it probably i think he pay a few hundred quid but he have a completely new set of teeth put in like you know when they file them all down they just give you like
S0041	yeah
S0084	veneer um yeah he basically have that so er what would cost him like thousands of pound here cost him hundreds of pound there instead so
S0041	i be gonna get veneer for my twenty first huh
S0084	mm
S0041	and then we find out that they don't last
S0084	no
S0041	they only last like ten years max don't they
S0084	i dunno if it's veneer er veneer be the one that go on the top of your teeth these be the ones be they file them right down and they give you brand new teeth
S0041	yeah
S0084	so veneer be probably the wrong word i can't remember what the word like
S0041	yeah
S0084	implant i suppose cos veneer just sit on the top they're just like cap on your old teeth i think whereas these be like they file them down to peg
S0041	that that's a cap
S0084	this this be like new teeth whatever it be where you get new teeth
S0041	if you file it down
S0084	mm
S0041	to a point
S0084	mm
S0041	and then they put porcelain tooth on
S0084	mm
S0041	that's a cap
S0084	what's a veneer then
S0041	a veneer be when they they file it they file most most of your teeth be still there and they put a cover on it i think
S0084	oh right no
S0041	a cap be the bottom half of your tooth
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos the point's still there but an implant be i don't know if they take the tooth out or they get rid of most of it
S0084	mm
S0041	but it's drill into your jaw
S0084	yeah drill in yeah that's what they do
S0041	implant
S0084	they drill into his jaw
S0041	so they would've he would've have to have all his teeth remove
S0084	uh because that's what they be do
S0041	not file down all out
S0084	mm i dunno if it be a combination then because he say
S0041	maybe
S0084	that they drill it down to peg
S0041	oh they
S0084	but there there be drill into his into his skull
S0041	yeah maybe they cap
S0084	mm
S0041	cap some and
S0084	mm
S0041	some strong ones
S0084	cos clare's step mum have that recently and it cost like ten thousand pound
S0041	yeah
S0084	and it be horrendously painful cos they're drill into your gum
S0041	yeah i'm gonna go to sleep and that's gonna happen and i'm gonna look great
S0084	that's gonna happen
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean er i will i'll book it first but yeah cos i've get no i've get really crap enamel my baby teeth didn't have any enamel at all
S0084	mm
S0041	tut they they look like normal teeth but there be just no coat on them
S0084	lordy
S0041	hence my shit teeth now that decide to break very easily
S0084	tut well at least you're not in that position
S0041	well then he say he say oh so it's gonna cost me a load of money i be like oh right and i say well what for and he say oh well you know to get like these sort and cos basically fuck so like dentures and that
S0084	mm
S0041	i say er dentures
S0041	he be like yeah
S0084	like old people have
S0041	so he's actually consider
S0084	have er something that you take in and out
S0041	have a plate yeah
S0084	mm

S0084	well as a child i want to have dentures
S0084	cos i'd see my nan's dentures and in my head i'm like but that's okay cos then you could eat all the sweets cos obviously your parent tell you if you eat sweets your teeth fall out
