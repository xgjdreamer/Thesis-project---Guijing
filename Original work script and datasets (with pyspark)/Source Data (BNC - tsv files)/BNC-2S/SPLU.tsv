S0525	well yes i be but then erm
S0614	but then if we don't
S0525	well we yeah we think we'd go through because he can get a week for ninety nine pound
S0614	yeah well can't beat that
S0525	i doubt whether i know and they're nice ones aren't they so
S0614	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	i think erm say you can only book four weeks in advance
S0614	right
S0525	but as long as we go outside school holiday which we will do
S0614	can yeah
S0525	then it won't be a problem to get us erm to get us in somewhere so i think they're talk about cos and have be to the one in cornwall
S0614	yeah
S0525	not so bother about go to wales but
S0614	no okay
S0525	they'd to go
S0614	yeah yeah
S0525	and then i suppose your sister will er
S0614	visit
S0525	pay us a visit
S0614	hoorah
S0525	down in her neck neck of the woods
S0614	unless we don't tell her
S0525	yeah i can see that happen
S0614	no be nice to go and see her or she'd come and see us we're down her her up here
S0525	well she she to before didn't she cos she visit when take down so she's erm
S0614	yes yeah yeah yeah true true true do that so she know where it be
S0525	yeah that's fair enough oh
S0614	remember they're talk do that
S0525	what's the matter
S0614	dunno get a crease or lump or something not lump crease
S0614	what it be bite of skin
S0614	anyway
S0525	erm well we be gonna say the last week of june but we can't go now cos we've book flight to bulgaria so and start work well she she say to her head teacher today that she'll go back at the start of july and she's gonna go full time because the summer holidays'll count towards full time pay so
S0614	oh right oh that's good
S0525	so and then i
S0525	well i suggest that in september she she'd just start her part time because it's easier for him to plan a term at i suppose if he know what teachers be full time what teachers be part time
S0614	yeah yeah
S0525	so we'll have to go before the end of june
S0614	alright
S0525	but we're not back until the eighth of june
S0614	and we're off again on the
S0525	and then we're off again on the twenty first
S0614	twenty
S0525	and i imagine you'll have to fit work in between then so
S0614	i'll fit a bite in anyway
S0525	unless we go may we could oh yeah i think i think may be another option go before the half term
S0614	oh okay yeah yeah
S0525	erm
S0525	i'll just have to see again with sign but
S0614	oh yeah yeah
S0525	but i don't think it'll be too bad i think that'll be i think we've get an our next exam be either the week before easter holiday or the week after so we'll've do it by may may'll just be mid term again so i don't think it'll hurt to miss one
S0614	fair enough
S0525	shouldn't do
S0614	idea
S0525	mm
S0614	be nice when i've do paint
S0525	well i know you can't and i think you can take the dog in some of them as well cos they'll wanna take the dog
S0614	yes

S0525	you've book the day off haven't you we'll do that on saturday because i don't want to assemble any more i want to take them out the box and lose the plan of which be a bs and cs cos otherwise i just get confuse
S0614	they're all to presumably be they
S0525	yes
S0614	okay
S0525	but no i'm not gonna take any more out the box till i know what i'm do with them have we get some bulbs it's those candle bulbs again low wattage i want four
S0614	it have to be low watt erm what's the erm
S0614	only get four of them wouldn't've think four would let's have a go i've get some in the there yeah yeah

S0614	mm
S0525	oh right i oh well
S0614	mm
S0525	yes but your wattage thing isn't work out with
S0614	properly
S0525	what so how how much how much be the ones that you've get what wattage
S0614	er forty watts i think
S0525	forty
S0614	yeah
S0525	so that'll be a hundred and sixty plus your extra twenty five percent or whatever it say allow for mm so it should still only be half the capacity of the switch okay then we'll put those in
S0614	try it
S0525	mm i i just think it might be the switch that's i mean that switch have always be a bite dodgy
S0614	yeah well
S0525	i i'd rather get erm the one like you put upstairs in my room because they're easy just to push in and turn that one's you've always get your finger on and off it and
S0614	mm
S0525	i don't like it
S0614	it's the same as the one we use to have isn't it no
S0525	no it isn't no we have
S0614	use to push little
S0525	use to be able to turn it up and down you didn't have to leave your finger off it to go up and then take it and come down again
S0614	oh that's the one before the last one that that's the that's the same as the cos they replace it
S0525	oh well i'm not on about replace it
S0525	i'm talk about i didn't like it
S0614	okay well
S0525	the other one's better
S0614	mm i don't know still er on the case i don't know how it'll end up i'm sure
S0525	well i do we'll end up get a new switch
