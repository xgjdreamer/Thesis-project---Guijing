S0281	mm
S0355	saw you erm i think i have a coffee and a and a bun
S0355	and er then erm
S0281	what what about that canvass you know you it didn't work out because somebody didn't turn up and you've get to do it tomorrow
S0355	yes i go to canvass i canvas on behalf of the green party and er i turn up to er canvas on behalf of who's the leader of the green party and erm but er i don't think i get the time and the place wrong but no one turn up erm
S0281	do he he er give you any explanation
S0355	well i can't i haven't yet contact the person who er who erm who ask me who contact me in the first place i've just get an email or not an email erm a text through from another councillor to tell me
S0281	mm
S0355	erm the telephone number of the person that they believe who co ordinate 's
S0281	mm
S0355	campaign so i shall text them to say be it you i'm suppose to be speak to erm and er if so
S0281	why why be they do why be they do this so early cos the election's in may isn't it
S0355	well
S0281	isn't it in may
S0355	probably but i mean why not now it's a continuous thing it start off if you
S0281	so what
S0355	you have a look
S0281	what's the point of canvass you try and basically persuade people to vote for you i mean be that what you do
S0355	well yes yes it's to
S0281	and you're decide how you're gonna vote
S0355	er you meet different type of people you meet the person who say i don't wanna know about it f off and you get really agitate and annoy then you meet people who erm go oh yes wonderful i vote i will always vote green fantastic then you meet people who er who ask you load of question they drive you mad question after question and er you can get trap by these people erm just talk and talk and talk so i generally
S0281	what do you mean trap
S0281	you mean just spend too
S0355	well they'll go on and on
S0281	too much time
S0355	they're try to be clever and prove a point
S0281	be they
S0355	and they're probably very very lonely people who who never get people walk up to them and say hello with a smile face and say how be you
S0355	and what's your opinion and er you know so they they want a friend and that's nice but if you're go to try and reach a lot of people you can't like a doctor you can't devote that much time to to them er but you can er but that's all part of learn how to canvas well i think er know how to let them go how to let them go feel good about themselves erm i normally say well look er er and and i'm er look er you're obviously very interest in this which be fantastic er i would go and look on the website and i will give them the website detail and they'll hopefully we we've get another supporter and i say to to as well would you be prepare to give an hour of your time a week to something if you care about the planet and the people on it an hour of your time just lick envelop or or put out some flyers er but you know you could do something because you meet people and broaden your horizons learn a bite about ecological er issue peace issue erm
S0281	mm
S0355	so er yeah there's that type and there's
S0281	well what's the percentage of people who vote like in the last election
S0355	erm i wouldn't know
S0281	no
S0355	i wouldn't know i think it's in the last general election
S0281	yeah
S0355	i would think it's pretty small i i would think probably i i don't know i would hazard a guess and say possibly sixty percent possibly i don't know but that's only a guess and that those statistics be easily find out nowadays with computers
S0281	mm it would be easy to find out yeah
S0355	yes what about the background noise of the er where we're record will that affect the quality of the record
S0281	well it's not that loud
S0355	right okay
S0281	mm we've get this little er thing here
S0355	yeah
S0281	who you can see er i don't know i i don't think so
S0355	okay
S0281	but erm i mean they be able to hear you see every time the the voice speak it spike
S0355	yes
S0281	so i don't think so yeah it should be alright
S0355	yeah so erm yeah well er i go out canvass that be er this even and i meet an old girlfriend of mine and erm it be very nice to see her she's a rock climber and run a women's group for rock climb women
S0355	she's win award for that er through her service to the community and erm er and i be very please for her she be very very proud it be an achievement for her to win that award er it be not only great for her to win it but it be great of er people in our society to to er help people attain those sort of achievements and feel good about themselves and i and i think that's a wonderful thing erm yeah i think she be the argus award she be er erm nominate for those and er win one of those so that be good erm

S0281	i wonder why they situate it out here outside of rather than inside do you think it's a bite cheaper for the rent and
S0355	they look for a pub that suit the the the concept i think because the position's good where it be it's get a catchment area it's er

S0355	near the beach
S0281	yeah but
S0355	it's
S0281	you you've get to you've get to really have a car unless you're really local

S0281	mm
S0355	er up the road here so it's in the middle of two and then a next carvery from that be at
S0281	mm
S0355	so they're they're sort of run on the same line as this erm yeah so
S0281	i have a bite of a disappointment with that er job interview it be erm at first i think it be gonna be okay but then er i get a an email today say that erm they haven't get as many students come over as er as they think so
S0355	i'm very sorry to hear that
S0281	yeah still you never know something might come of it

S0355	no swear and rudeness
S0281	turd's not a swear word be it
S0355	erm probably not no it's not be it

S0281	do you need do you need him to be there
S0355	not really but if i go and do some work and he's not there then you know i'll feel that i've do more than he have
S0281	well i mean do you can't you since you're you've get a well it seem to me a sort of loose work relationship you can just say
S0355	yes
S0281	well look i'm i'm do all this work i don't think it's fair that i you you know we split the money fifty fifty can't you say that
S0355	well he he would argue that that erm it it's it's just better if i don't get into the position of that argument if i just go yeah i'm not feel too good either it's just simpler to do that because
S0281	well can't you talk honestly
S0355	well the truth be i hate work and er i loathe work by myself anyway
S0281	really
S0355	work on my own i find quite lonely sometimes
S0281	yeah
S0355	unless there be a a financial erm drive if there's a financial er impetus er yeah if there's if i know i can go and oh well actually i be go in to work tomorrow
S0281	be that a woman who's
S0355	a customer an old customer of mine phone me up and ask me if i could do a small job for her which i can and i can for that it won't be much
S0281	yeah
S0355	be a or something for that be a so then
S0281	and then
S0355	that'll be nice
S0281	you can do the work afterwards
S0355	i might do
S0355	i might do but i've get to go and buy some materials
S0281	mm
S0355	which i'm not too sure about do
S0281	you've still get those bits and piece those er that you've be buy lately to get to sell and resell haven't you
S0355	i have i have but er it's where do i erm yeah
S0281	well where do you sell them
S0355	where do i sell them exactly
S0281	oh i oh i think you have people in mind when you buy them where you could
S0355	well i do i do i do but one of the people who buy er bits and bob off me she have as she's redecorate her shop and she say she's not buy anymore stock until she have redecorate
S0281	yeah well that's
S0355	so it's fair enough erm
S0281	yeah
S0355	she's get to clear all the stuff out of the shop that she's get in there to redecorate and it would be nice for her to set everything out erm
S0281	mm
S0355	with erm
S0281	have you ever think about get a shop and buy and sell stuff
S0355	well i have but the it's er it's a big commitment erm you've get to sit unless you've get a shop in a very busy place where you've get lot of people come in and out and and like a gift shop something like that on seafront sell objet d'art would be good down there you know but it's er place in a seaside town that you're aim for for turnover from the general public ie holiday makers really depend on the weather and some years you can actually take virtually nothing the whole year because er the weather's so appal certainly if it's in a place where the that only really cater for the sun seekers or tourists it's erm sometimes in the winter it can be completely dead
S0281	mm
S0355	so it's quite difficult look for a market if you deal in really really upmarket piece you've get to get get you've get to find the the market and and erm and and go for market i mean if you have really top dollar stuff in a shop erm you can't put any rubbish in there you can't put anything for a fiver in there people people you lose credibility it's all get to be magnificent quality

S0355	they'll be yawn about what people do won't they
S0281	yeah
S0355	although i suppose what they do isn't much difference be it
S0281	i i dunno i dunno really how how these conversations be gonna be use get no idea
S0355	well you know i mean if they're go with cambridge it's very doubtful they'd come to a place like er
S0281	why not
S0355	the carvery well because er they i think they'd consider it beneath them
S0281	well it's not actually cambridge university it's cambridge university press
S0355	oh right well i still well they're probably reasonably well pay though aren't they
S0281	well i should imagine so
S0355	i mean they wouldn't come to place where you get a a roast meal and erm for four pound thirty six and
S0281	why not
S0355	well i think it's the type of people they'd be sit amongst
S0355	i mean they really don't you think so
S0281	no
S0355	no so you don't think they're elitist
S0281	i should think they're
S0355	or snobs
S0281	they're normal people as er as anybody who can be call normal be normal
S0355	right there you go then there you go
S0281	i mean people could call us normal but there again how wrong would they be
S0355	well they're
S0281	how wrong could i could they be
S0355	i mean the most interest fact be that i think about these interview that get record and send to to these people at cambridge press be that people really don't tell them what they're think i mean people all play the game don't they
S0281	well it's not really it's you've get it in your head it's like an interview you know i'm not interview you
S0355	no no no
S0281	that's right so do do you want erm erm stop this and er
S0355	i'm easy yeah we'll get some ice cream yeah i can
S0281	i'll go and get some ice cream
S0355	yeah okay
