S0083	oh that wasn't her then i think it be
S0084	no it be an e mail
S0083	oh
S0084	huh et oh he's so cute the thing be that's really annoy about spielberg and lucas be that they keep release new editions where they touch up you know the
S0083	do they
S0084	the effect from the first edition you know obviously with star war they bring out the the the remastered
S0083	yeah i know
S0084	versions and they have you know the cgi for jabba the hut and
S0083	mm
S0084	all that sort of carry on but with et he do it and he make et cgi rather than a puppet and it's really it really take away from the film i think i think it really
S0083	well i would've think so yeah
S0084	there's er something quite charm about that and er it's a it's weird it's like with yoda now you know yoda be obviously a cgi and before he be a puppet but now if you watch the er old ones
S0083	oh okay you er
S0084	it's it's a puppet again
S0083	oh okay
S0084	it's really you know that sort of
S0083	oh
S0084	creepy i don't know i don't know whether it's just because you've you're use to the puppet and
S0083	mm
S0084	now it's not think i like the limit facial expressions that they have
S0083	yeah
S0084	and now they're a bite too i dunno it's a bite weird what plat have you give me then ones that you don't use or
S0083	mm yeah i've just give you a couple more it's
S0084	oh well i've get quite a few now if you need them
S0083	no it's fine you have them i've get load so it's fine
S0084	well if you're sure
S0083	of course
S0084	oh thank no cake though
S0083	no sorry you're the one who have to make the cake
S0084	oh
S0083	cos you're so good at it now and i'm never gonna make another cake no i've decide that's it
S0084	you're never gonna make another cake
S0083	no
S0084	um rachel's
S0083	that's it
S0084	housemate's birthday be last week helen and um she's a bite of a cake snob
S0084	er she's quite into her bake she actually make her brother's wed cake last week er that's how good she be she quite
S0083	oh
S0084	quite a pro and um tut rachel have buy her a caterpillar cake
S0083	uh
S0084	and apparently she just turn her down
S0083	oh no
S0084	she just eat a bite like half a slice and be like yeah thank that's alright
S0083	tut
S0084	so she bring it in for us to eat
S0083	huh
S0084	so have caterpillar cake in the office on friday oh look at her isn't she cute
S0083	mm
S0084	she's just so cute du du du du du i be look at horse rid lessons the other day fifty two pound for a two hour lesson
S0083	huh good god
S0084	it's ridiculous isn't it i'd probably only be able to afford it once a month and you'd just forget um you know you need to go every week really
S0083	that's just ridiculous
S0084	it's like learn to drive essentially it's the same price
S0083	that's just unbelievable
S0084	i mean i'm sure you know fee and hay be expensive but it can't be that expensive
S0083	that's just that's just crazy
S0084	thing be buy a horse be be not very expensive it's keep it you know from if i buy
S0083	mm
S0084	a horse it would be
S0083	well i dunno it be
S0084	keep it at the stable i mean obviously you've get
S0083	yeah
S0084	vet's bill and saddle and
S0083	yeah
S0084	all the rest
S0083	absolutely
S0084	and shoe and what have you but actually it's it's more the stable cost but you be i think in the long run if you be serious about rid you're better off get your own pony
S0083	mm
S0084	she's just not attractive at all be she
S0083	no
S0084	just cos she's er she's
S0083	er
S0084	jerry's daughter isn't she
S0083	yeah that's just that's the only reason otherwise i don't think they'd ever look at her
S0084	no well she's not attractive
S0083	no
S0084	mm i do dread to think how much she get pay for each one of those advert
S0083	mm
S0084	never ah so that's why they put the petrol cap on a lead on the petrol cap be on a string when you take it off
S0083	tut so you don't lose it
S0084	so you don't lose it
S0083	yeah mm
S0084	and that's quite good consider 's basic and what i didn't realize be that if you leave the car unlock for a minute it she lock herself because i when
S0083	i didn't know that
S0084	when um tut when um tut and i be leave for tesco's the other night
S0083	mm
S0084	we come out of the out of the house and the next door neighbour have park across our drive
S0083	mm
S0084	even though they go mental if we even
S0083	yeah
S0084	park
S0083	yeah
S0084	on their side they go absolutely mental
S0083	mm
S0084	um so i have to ask them to move but i'd unlock the car and i walk round into their you know
S0083	mm
S0084	up their path and the car lock itself
S0083	tut oh
S0084	so that's good because i often think well on 's um tut lock it's one button whereas on 's key at least it's two
S0083	yeah
S0084	it's it's unlock and lock
S0083	mhm
S0084	but er i'm so use to press unlock when i'm i often press unlock when i mean to press lock when i'm walk away
S0083	right yeah
S0084	so it's reassure to know that if i be to do that and not double check
S0083	yeah
S0084	it will just lock itself
S0083	exactly
S0084	which be really good i think for a basic model car to have those feature as standard and not something that you have to pay extra for
S0083	absolutely no it be good
S0084	good old uh hum num num num what be you do
S0083	i'm play boggle
S0084	be play boggle
S0083	mm and not do very well
S0084	oh i love zumba can't believe zumba's just take over the world
S0083	it look more fun than some things
S0084	it be really fun the music's great it just make you smile as soon as you hear it
S0083	well i would've think so
S0084	it's such a good work out
S0083	yeah it's much better than go to the gym i would've think
S0084	yeah yeah absolutely and the woman that take it at the office she's um gonna start do another fitness class as well
S0083	mhm
S0084	so that's quite good cos obviously if i'm not pay for gym membership then i don't mind pay for fitness class
S0083	mm
S0084	really and it's cheaper than do them at the gym so
S0083	mm
S0084	and it's good it's just obviously if you go to the gym usually you won't know anybody there like the other day i be at the gym
S0083	mm
S0084	last week and you know you're all sweaty and my colleague tim come in and er you're just really embarrass
S0084	because you've gotta stand there do the weight and you just basically try and avoid eye contact
S0083	aw
S0084	yeah it's embarrass can you believe ant and dec be still on the tv
S0083	no i can't er understand how they ever be on the tv
S0084	fifteen it's like er they've be on the tv for like fifteen years now because biker er they're when they be in biker grove it be when i be at school
S0083	mm
S0084	so that well no it in fact actually it would've be earlier it be when i first start watch it so i think when they release their first single it be nineteen ninety four
