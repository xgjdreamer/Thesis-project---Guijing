S0441	yeah i know stop right i'm a bite worry about these egg now
S0439	i think they'll be fine hun i don't think you can go too wrong with an egg
S0441	no but i suppose if if they're not do then that's a complete waste of an egg
S0439	dad normally no dad just normally leave them like in the pan for a while
S0441	oh do he what to continue cook for a bite
S0439	just yeah like turn it off the boil and then just leave them in there for like a few minutes and then drain the water and you can just leave them in the pan they will continue to cook cos it's an egg so it's not like it will go hard
S0441	yeah yeah it's still hot isn't it yeah okay
S0439	so don't worry it's all good i love peel hard boil egg that's one of the most like satisfy things to do as sad as that sound god i'm a loser
S0441	oh it say this say partially fill a bowl with ice cub in water leave the enough room blah blah blah
S0439	blah blah blah
S0441	use a slot slot spoon to transfer the hot egg immediately into cold water and then leave them to cool for ten minutes and then they'll be really easy to peel apparently
S0439	yeah it's the opposite of tomatoes isn't it cos tomatoes you're suppose to put in boil water then the skin come off really easily
S0441	yeah yes well you learn something new every day
S0439	life be a learn curve
S0441	it's a life skill hard boil egg
S0439	i love that you get to the grand old age of twenty four and you've never boil a hard boil an egg before
S0441	i've never really need if i if i want an egg salad i'd probably buy it
S0439	yeah true
S0441	but
S0439	and i've never want an egg sandwich so
S0441	yeah so i guess
S0439	there's load of weird with things like that like 's go home for the weekend to france and her dad be talk to her and she be varnish something and then she dip the brush and he be like no now you need to clean the brush and she's like okay so she go to the sink and be like wash it he be like no no no you've get to use white spirit do you not have any common sense like why do you not know this and she be like
S0441	no idea
S0439	why would i know that i have to use white spirit to clean a brush i've never do paint before in my life like why would i know that he's like well it's common sense really and she's like how be it common sense if i if i've never
S0441	it's only common sense if you know it
S0439	yeah he be like hand me the spanner cos they be build a bookcase or something she's like here she hand him like a spanner but he's like not that spanner and she's like
S0441	what spanner
S0439	what spanner be you on about he go that one blah blah you know whatever special name she's like i don't know what you're talk about go away
S0441	oh dear joy of diy
S0439	i know she erm she go home this weekend obviously and then she come back today and she be a bite sad and she's like her parent be argue really badly
S0441	yeah
S0439	and she's just like she she say i think my parent be gonna like maybe get a divorce or something
S0441	yeah
S0439	and i be just like god i couldn't imagine my parent get i know the like they argue and stuff and they've be like like they've be like close over the years to maybe split up but i never i can't imagine my parent get a divorce i'd be really upset i think if they do it now
S0441	mm i suppose but it doesn't really change anything really well it change that they live apart
S0439	yeah no no yeah i get that but i don't know i just feel like without them be it's not the same
S0441	yeah
S0439	i don't know
S0441	yeah i suppose but then
S0439	i'd rather them be happy apart than like be miserable together definitely
S0441	yeah
S0439	but no if my parent would divorce i'd be well upset
S0441	yeah it's weird
S0439	i guess it's like easier when you're not like young as in like your age but if you be like if your parent separate when you be like two or something cos then you would never know your parent together
S0441	i think it would be easier if you be older if you're younger
S0439	do you think
S0441	you always wonder why do you know what i mean and you never grow up with a normal family so
S0439	but then i guess that's what your definition of normal would be wouldn't it like your parent live apart
S0441	not if all your friends have all like their friends like their families together i suppose
S0439	true but it's weird how nowadays most people not most people that's a complete generalisation but a lot of people actually their parent aren't together it's like become weirder have not weirder but it's become less common to have your parent still together be some place
S0441	yeah yeah
S0439	it's really peculiar
S0441	it be weird
S0439	mm but then my the girl in her parent be get divorce and they've be marry something like fifty years

S0441	probably bless her try to just the situation
S0439	yeah exactly try to like and you know sometimes you know you don't have time to do it because you don't want to have you don't have time to put yourself in that awkward situation
S0441	yeah
S0439	that's it it's not that she doesn't physically have time to message me because she do

S0441	good
S0439	and right on saturday morning her boyfriend be come up and i'd never meet him before and i turn round and she be on the phone to him so i speak to him and i be like hiya i hear cos she say he's a little shy a bite nervous he's meet my parent he's meet you so he be on the phone i be like hi hear you're a bite shy today come up so i just think i'd talk to you on the phone before i meet you so you know you know what i sound like and stuff so when we meet next when we meet in like a hour or so it'll all be fine and blah blah blah he bollocked her he turn round and say like how dare you tell your friends that i'm shy you know like how dare you like talk about me behind my back he get really angry with her he be like i don't know why i'm bother to come all this stuff like why do you talk about it i bet you're laugh about me i be like
S0441	to be fair not that i would be angry about that but i'd be a bite like oh cos you wouldn't want anyone to know that you be nervous would you really
S0439	well you would be i would be nervous meet like my friends like my boyfriend's friends and stuff and it be only me it wasn't like anybody
S0441	i know but if say if if turn round and just be like and say ooh i've tell everyone that you're really nervous i'd be like oh great
S0439	she didn't tell everybody she just like tell one person
S0441	but but the people that that he be meet though
S0439	yeah but she no she didn't know she didn't tell them she just tell me we be discuss it and she be like he's really like nervous about meet people but that's just what i would say to you like even if it be just like say well i have a boyfriend come i be it's just general stuff you'd say to someone i think
S0441	i suppose but
S0439	well yeah
S0441	obviously he have little bite of
S0439	well he properly bollocked her on her birthday
S0441	not not bollocking not bollocking her no not at not at all but
S0439	like why be i come why should i bother come and stuff
S0441	that's that's not need but i mean
S0439	and i be like how
S0441	he's probably a bite defensive i'd imagine defensive about it
S0439	yeah i i meet him and he didn't say anything to me and then come across as really special
S0441	that's probably because he be a bite embarrass i imagine as well
S0439	because he behave like a complete knob
S0441	yeah
S0439	and he's like and it be really ironic i be like erm you know i can't believe you've give people this bad perception of me and it's no dude the person who be give yourself a bad you know perception
S0441	yeah
S0439	be you
S0441	yeah
S0439	because you're get at your girlfriend on her birthday
S0441	yeah
S0439	he come across as a right knob i be just like er
S0441	oh dear
S0439	i know you shouldn't judge someone else who they date but it's just like you can do better
S0441	yeah but he could have he he's probably a bite insecure as well
S0439	i think he be yeah apparently like he get really angry with her because they she go on a hen night and one of her like she have to do like a task or something and one of her task be to like grind on this old man and he get really angry at her about it
S0441	he's probably really insecure
S0439	i think he be like he must be yeah he do look at but he look a bite retard but i don't know it's just really weird and you know when you're just like why be you with him
S0441	yeah not good
S0439	and like she say like he do it quite often i be like why would you be with somebody who have no sense of humour and clearly get at you for really stupid things
S0441	they're probably not very suit be they
S0439	i don't think they be they're the couple that haven't have sex since they start go out
S0441	how how long have they be go out for
S0439	since christmas six months
S0441	really why not
S0439	no they start off as like best friends
S0441	oh i think you tell me
S0439	last year
S0441	yeah
S0439	and they kind of like a grey zone where they be get with each other and she be kind of like oh i think i like you and he's like oh there's no spark between us
S0441	oh yeah
S0439	yeah and then at christmas he decide there might be a spark so go out
S0441	yeah
S0439	and then basically he can't get it up
S0441	okay so like they're definitely not a
S0439	apparently she say it's because he's nervous
S0441	no it's not
S0439	i'm like no no no if i fancy yeah if i fancy somebody
S0441	it'd be pretty easy
S0439	it's be pretty easy to nail them wouldn't it
S0441	no they're not right fit at all
S0439	no but when i go to see her in in like april when we go to the victoria and albert museum to see the exhibition
S0441	mm
S0439	they have an argument oh no the alexander mcqueen exhibition they have an argument that day because she tell him that she love him and he say my feel for you haven't really develop since christmas
S0441	okay
S0439	and you're just like no like i do say to her on friday i felt really bad but i be like it just sound like do you do you think you be a couple or do you think you're still just best friends and she's like no no no we're definitely closer than best friends i be like but do that mean you're a couple like
S0441	you know when someone doesn't like you when they can't get it up like
S0439	yeah apparently they've have sex once but it be kind of like half hearted apparently he can get up for other things just not sex it's actually i've get no idea but six months
S0441	he's get some kind of psychological thing go on there
S0439	yeah i just don't think he like her enough
S0441	no
S0439	i know that sound horrible and i know you don't want to say that to your friends
S0441	probably not though probably true
S0439	but i have a feel he just doesn't like her enough
S0441	yeah oh dear oh well that's probably not a bad thing she can obviously do better and that's cool
S0439	but i don't think she want to do better
S0441	oh
S0439	like she doesn't want to do better
S0441	she want him
S0439	i think she's a yeah it's take her so long to get a boyfriend that she think she's kind of get to like settle for what she's get
S0441	oh no
S0439	i know
S0441	that's sad i don't want like anyone to end up with that life
S0439	exactly settle the thing be you feel bad for the person who have to settle but you also feel bad for the person who be the one who be be settle with
S0441	yeah that they're settle for
S0439	great thank you're settle for me cos you don't think you know you think you can do better
S0441	everyone's yeah but but there's no point
S0439	i think i'd die if that be the case i'm not go to bother with be with you at all thank you very much
S0441	yeah awful
S0439	i know it's horrible yeah so it's kind of like the thing be i'm i'm quite open with her like i will say to her like like i say do you think you're just best friends like i'm not i don't tiptoe around the subject
S0441	yeah
S0439	and when like they be like in their grey zone and stuff i be like do you really think it's work like
S0441	be there any point in this
S0439	yeah i i think if he like you he'd tell you you know like he'd be there and
S0441	boys be pretty like simple aren't they they're not like difficult to work out
S0439	if they like you they're there if they're not if they don't like you they're not there simple as that
S0441	be there a reason why he's stick around
S0439	i think he just a he doesn't want to hurt her feel
S0441	doesn't want to hurt her feel
S0439	and b probably they just you know like they're friends and they probably do get on really really well
S0441	yeah that's not all of it but yeah
S0439	there's just not that attraction maybe they're try to force it
S0441	maybe he's just kid himself maybe that's why he can't get it up cos he's just kid himself
S0439	he's erm yeah cos it's just yeah it's just a very very weird i don't know i know that if i wasn't have if i wasn't even have sex with my boyfriend after like three weeks i'd be worry you know like
S0441	yeah
S0439	six months you haven't have sex in six months
S0441	especially like i'd definitely definitely be worry if it be him that couldn't get it up either
S0439	yeah exactly
S0441	i'd sort of think mm there's probably an issue there like
S0439	if i if i be date somebody and he couldn't get an erection i'd be like oh fuck my life i be he find me repulsive
S0441	he he
S0439	yeah exactly it's stupid that we validate ourselves like that but it's true i'd feel it's my fault if he be have problems
S0441	tragic
S0439	ah men
S0441	who need them
S0439	talk of men how's
S0441	good thank very good

S0439	yeah
S0441	it'll be fine
S0439	what time do you have to be at work for
S0441	have to be in for nine but it's like not a drop in session but not like a you have to start at nine so if i'm late then i'm late but it doesn't really matter that much
S0439	yeah okay
S0441	he's gonna i think trial go from here sleep cos he can he's they're do they're start to do flexi time at work now so they can do eight till four or nine till five or ten till six so

S0441	so he's go to get he's go to trial go to work from here i think the weekend the weekend after that see how that go

S0441	yeah exactly so
S0439	oh okay that's cool
S0441	yeah it'll be interest
S0439	the thing be the train be really quite efficient the only problem be they're expensive
S0441	yeah
S0439	but if he have a railcard and stuff you know it's not too bad
S0441	no and i guess if he book it sort of a little bite in advance
S0439	yeah if he know and stuff so
S0441	yeah
S0439	that's good
S0441	yeah see how that work out
S0439	how erm i guess to get into for nine you'd have to leave like a an hour and a half before hand an hour and a bite no
S0441	well i'm not actually in so i'd probably i'll probably meet the traffic when i get up there but i'm not i'm only go to which be like south
S0439	oh okay
S0441	before you get at the before you actually reach
S0439	yeah and also because it's the school holiday the roads be amaze
S0441	i know
S0439	i it's so fuck annoy that the the reason there be traffic be because of the school
S0441	i know it's really annoy it's really really annoy
S0439	it's just like i'm sorry private school mums piss off take your your one child to school in your land rover
S0441	can't you get them on a bus

S0441	it's easier to peel an egg that have be crack all over
S0439	ah no sometimes i roll it a little bite just to get the crack start and then you start pick it i wouldn't say crack all over though
S0441	mm lean it on its side and apply light pressure with your hand as you roll it against the counter this will crack the shell around the egg begin peel at the large end of the egg there's an air pocket at the end so it's easier to get start without move the egg white along the shell
S0439	that make sense
