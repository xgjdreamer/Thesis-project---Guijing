S0587	shit table you've make
S0584	it's a table it's a bite long
S0584	you're a loud sort of a
S0587	i know
S0587	in the library i get very self conscious
S0587	i don't know why it be
S0584	i swallow but it's like i just drink some right
S0587	i think it's cos when i when i drink i drink lot so i need to like guzzle it down but other people they just drink leisurely
S0584	date of birth
S0584	what what month
S0584	now now expiry may be the fifth yes
S0584	we don't wanna run round too much though do we get
S0587	no we don't but we could a date on it
S0584	we could work back from
S0587	but the we we
S0584	when we we've
S0587	we do know
S0584	do we well i think it would be nice to know how say it take us ten days to traverse russia
S0587	uhu
S0584	so so it date it at that tenth day so come back after ten days to mongolia and then whatever we first then it's that bullshit so it's seven days in mongolia but first it's like nineteen days so we can put like five days either side or like three days here and then seven days of that
S0587	uhu
S0584	just make sure we're always in it
S0587	okay yeah uhu but i think on our excel spreadsheet anyway if we go off the iran thing
S0584	yeah i suppose iran yeah
S0587	well with iran it'll be twenty first and then into russia
S0584	yeah so if we put three days or four days before
S0587	it's cos you can enter after the date
S0584	okay
S0587	yeah
S0584	sound good
S0587	so we need to do that
S0584	so so with iran and we get to russia there cos here it's here so then two days back one day back
S0584	it's the i swear it's the first now we're in the first group don't think there's a twenty seventh group there's a first and then a second i think yeah
S0587	so it'll be the nineteenth
S0584	almaty where's almaty
S0587	it's just get into kazakhstan
S0584	right okay so that's around the twenty first of the thingy be the answer but we'll put it at nineteenth but what month be august
S0587	wait twenty first then to what twenty first then to what
S0584	oh right twenty yeah okay so we get to russia then
S0587	yeah with iran yeah the twenty second
S0584	of august

S0584	i think you have to go to a post office and say
S0587	i wanna pay
S0584	i wanna a postal order
S0584	for this much
S0587	a financial instrument intend for send money through the mail and it's purchase at a post office
S0584	oh right
S0587	and pay at another post office or a small fee for the service know as poundage
S0587	be pay by us
S0584	oh
S0587	what's the poundage on that
S0584	be we gonna do our own passport photos rather than chop ten quid off
S0587	no

S0584	gonna need a lot
S0587	yeah
S0584	either for your drive permit or your visa
S0587	okay yeah well we could go to get them do today if we nip out
S0584	well then it's ten quid

S0584	printer
S0587	don't you like have to have special good quality paper
S0584	yeah glossy paper i suppose
S0587	er i'm just just think
S0584	we'll just we'll just print them we'll just do them
S0587	oh and we can we can take a picture of it and then just go to the as well
S0584	yeah that's fine
S0587	or asda
S0584	yeah
S0587	sure they have a set
S0584	wait oh oh a set okay
S0584	i be think we're gonna go to crop it
S0587	the way we set it
S0584	make a jpeg with like six on
S0587	oh there's no yeah
S0584	that fit on like one of the asdas
S0587	mm
S0584	regular size
S0587	but then we need to know the dimension
S0587	yeah we need to know the dimension for the so we cut it out and the direct the slice
S0584	mm quite hard i suppose it won't be too hard so long as we've get the dimension on the internet
S0587	they they be though yeah we've do our passport photos before i reckon it's not actually that hard now think about it
S0584	well
S0587	but then do they give you a a page and say you can print out anything you want on that i suppose they do cos it's just you can all you can all put you know a picture to them isn't it yeah let's do it it'll be funny
S0587	if it doesn't work it's something like
S0584	not be trim or cut down from a larger photograph to the size of a standard passport photo but how do you do that cos when you go to a photo booth they're all be they probably pre cut
S0587	i don't think that's what they mean i think they mean like you can't say if i take a photo of you
S0584	oh okay
S0587	here you can't zoom in
S0584	oh i see
S0587	and then
S0584	yeah
S0587	see what i mean
S0584	so we could do it i suppose
S0587	have you get like a blank wall
S0584	not cream or grey
S0584	my sister's room be a plain white wall
S0584	cos that visa that be an online application and print
S0587	that's the part we need
S0584	yeah i need to send off passport
S0587	it sound really easy now
S0584	yeah i've just get to yeah i think probably when i be look it be a good break
S0587	right
S0584	so we'll be go today uzbek will be print all our passports photos that's that's what that's what we'll achieve today
S0587	okay
S0584	bite uzbek and passport photos so they're thirty five mil by forty five mil
S0587	so the uzbek one do you wanna send it off today
S0584	no
S0587	just
S0584	you need a passport for friday cos you need your passport on friday
S0587	oh be it actually you've gotta send it off
S0584	oh yeah your passport's gotta go with it
S0587	oh right
S0584	and postal order payment which we don't even know be it have you find the price for it yet or
S0587	for a postal order
S0584	no for the
S0587	oh okay erm
S0584	uzbek doesn't actually say there
S0587	no i think it's
S0584	really
S0587	it's quite a lot
S0584	be that a hotel or that's a hostel hostel be different be it
S0587	yeah hostels be english so english and
S0584	and also hotels not definitely not our third
S0587	not really yeah not pay that much what be we get for uzbek be it a transit
S0584	well erm well well for some i think it's tourist uzbek there to yeah tourist
S0587	okay it say the visa fee be for a multiple entry tourist visa they don't give you an option for a single there's one there actually but
S0584	same entry visa that'll be it won't it
S0587	yeah but there's also one down here say erm yeah so for thirty days eighty us dollars plus a process fee so
S0584	so a hundred dollars can you do a postal order in for dollars
S0587	mm be seventy quid
S0584	what do they say be photo size let's have a look so if you if you can make a jpeg in like or something with like six copy of the
S0587	yeah
S0584	they'll fit on but have the that specific size that do print yeah so have the photo print
S0587	do you know how to change i don't know why it change but it use to be like shift and three be pound but now i have to do alt and three and it change it just change randomly
S0584	i don't know and i have no idea how to get the hash key until age ago
S0584	oh right
S0587	i forget i forget what it be now it's like control alt for hash yeah i just couldn't couldn't do it oh wrong one
S0584	i be do some mad stuff on the i have so many combinations i don't know about
S0587	yeah
S0584	that be do like if you press command and a number it take you to that tab that's open
S0587	i be try to find out cos i do something weird i think see it doesn't do it sometimes though
S0584	okay
S0587	oh maybe mine's different control mm
S0584	six by four that's the isn't it it be six by four inch do we have painter max what what do we have
S0584	get paintbrush you do a width in pixels
S0587	i dunno paint the equivalent from that
S0584	yeah paintbrush
S0587	and it's like hide
S0584	i just search it and get it up
S0587	mm it's not it's not online
S0584	well like if you have you you use er to search paintbrush
S0587	no oh no just get a wikipedia page for it
S0584	oh like we we can use photo can't photos to set the size of it and
S0587	yeah you can do that i'm pretty sure but i be think about just do it on word and then you can set image size to
S0584	yeah
S0587	so and so you just copy and paste it and save it as a pdf and i'm pretty sure you can just print pdfs on the machine
S0584	mm i don't know a lot of the quality might deteriorate though
S0587	so you you want to have it as a jpeg
S0584	pretty much yeah
S0587	can you do that in word save it
S0584	no i don't think so
S0587	can you not save erm like on the load of picture together as an image and then save that as a picture
S0584	mm i see what you mean
S0587	let's just try that
S0584	i think well i smash it
S0587	yeah
S0587	nice
S0584	all different countries apparently visa specific size
S0587	oh well ours be the same as that or slightly different
S0584	i don't know russia where's russia russia visa it's the same forty five by thirty five they've not have all the visa though so i'd just say look they're all gonna be uk size
S0587	yeah there's not that much variation
S0584	no
