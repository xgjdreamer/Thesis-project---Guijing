S0439	that be the point
S0441	we just weren't explain ourselves very well

S0441	we be explain ourselves way too much
S0439	oh she have a really bad day yesterday
S0441	oh do she
S0439	she get tell by her erm company that they weren't gonna sponsor her to stay in the country so she have to go back next year you know she want to try and stay
S0441	shit
S0439	and then leave and she definitely like that's why we be late actually we spend like half an hour in morrisons' car park cos she like cry bless her cos like 's go on holiday like a lads' holiday she think she's in love with him
S0441	oh
S0439	yeah
S0441	oh
S0439	not just like him but be like in like
S0441	i always wonder whether there be something
S0439	yeah i think i think there always be something like i know er she's speak to me about it before and she have admit that she's have like a crush on him and stuff but she be like i think i actually love him i'm like oh god okay
S0441	do he reciprocate the feel
S0439	i don't know i'm really confuse about it because he do everything
S0441	they seem to like be a couple almost
S0439	they be they're a couple without like the sex essentially
S0441	yeah
S0439	and like he do things for her like buy her like stuff when he's out you know like buy her like her favourite cake or like cupcake when she's out or er for her birthday he buy her a scratch map that she yeah that he get in months ago and want to like surprise her with it and stuff and
S0441	see when i hear that i be like oh
S0439	yeah exactly but then i kind of think
S0439	but i would do the same for like like on saturday we're surprise her by take her to the theatre
S0441	yeah
S0439	but because it's girls you it doesn't mean the same thing do it
S0441	no
S0439	but it's because it's him do it
S0441	true oh but then that would make you fall in love with someone wouldn't it
S0439	yeah
S0439	and then when he go out to this waffle house the other er like a few weeks ago he like bring back some waffle and like put them in the fridge for her and be like and like message her be like put some waffle in the fridge for you and it sound really sweet
S0439	but then you're like but if i do like go out and buy you those brownies in the fridge it wouldn't you'd just be like oh awesome thank
S0441	yeah
S0439	but if it's a boy do it it's like
S0441	yeah but
S0439	oh he's think about me
S0441	but boys don't but then okay
S0439	boys don't do that
S0441	boys don't do that do they
S0439	no
S0441	and boys don't think about people that they don't give a shit about
S0439	exactly and like that's the thing though but and also you like you know me i'm a firm believer that if he like her he would've he would get with her
S0441	mm
S0439	he'd go there
S0441	mm
S0439	and he hasn't might not want and they haven't even kiss
S0441	they need to have it out they need to have this discussion
S0439	they do i say that to her yesterday cos i be like you've get another nine months of this like if if
S0441	it's gonna be absolute torture
S0439	do you think yeah do you think you can actually do it and she be like well yeah i've do it before i'm like yeah but
S0441	how long have they be live live together here
S0439	mm since last january time so nearly yeah eight months nine months
S0441	be they friends from like school
S0439	no no they she's friends with his sister
S0441	oh okay
S0439	and then she meet through years ago erm and they kind of know each other in pass but weren't actually friends and then when move to the uk already live over here
S0441	oh okay
S0439	so kind of like show her around and stuff and then they just get on like super well and now they have like this amaze friendship but she yeah she's in love with him and he's not reciprocate but it's really weird cos obviously
S0441	oh
S0439	he's also date this girl at and it's just i like it must be like really difficult to know that he's date all these other girls when you really like him she's like it be difficult but then i also know that his like his relationship with me be nothing like his relationship with them like ours be so much closer
S0441	yeah and it's not it can't obviously be that good can it cos he keep chop and change all the time it seem
S0439	mm yeah like he's date like three people at once or two people at once
S0441	maybe it could be a case of like he can't see it in front of him
S0439	until she go
S0441	yeah she'll really maybe he'll really miss her when she's go these three weeks
S0439	yeah cos he's away this er week or two weeks and then if he come back but she's still in so
S0441	but he'll be in he'll be he'll be without her for a bite
S0439	yeah but he be with his brother and like well he's with the lads he's with a group of lads on a lads' tour
S0441	and that might make him think when he when he come back cos this be what happen to he he go on a lads' holiday and then when he come back he felt really depress and like miserable about his life
S0439	oh god what's wrong with men
S0441	i don't know
S0439	i'm hop but i also worry that if she do start go out with him she'll start to get annoy by things that she now can't get cos she can't get annoy at the moment like if he doesn't respond how she want him to respond or something like that because
S0441	mm
S0439	you know she have no right to get annoy with him cos they're not go out but i worry that if they do start go out or or if something do happen and then he do something she'll then get annoy about it
S0441	she might
S0439	it'll change the dynamic of their relationship
S0441	or you'd hope that it be maybe like a
S0439	make them stronger
S0441	smooth transition
S0439	could be
S0441	ah poor
S0439	mm cos she's so nice
S0441	who erm where do she what company do she work for
S0439	don't know just a small one in town
S0439	yeah they be like we really want you to stay but they have to to sponsor somebody it's not the financial side they have the problem with it's the side that if you sponsor someone to stay in the uk you have to open up the job invite people to apply for it and then the person who want the or the work erm visa have to be the best applicant basically
S0441	oh god
S0439	so to apply so what they have to do be make not fire but make her role available to other people to apply for it and then she'd have to like reapply
S0441	that she would get it
S0439	and well they just don't know how many people be gonna like respond to it
S0441	what be what's her job title
S0439	i i don't know
S0441	mm
S0439	i don't know but they er they say like cos like they'd just recruit two other people and the amount of applications they have be ridiculous and they be just concern that you know if you have to
S0441	she might get lose
S0439	yeah
S0441	oh
S0439	not that they they they wouldn't get like she wouldn't get lose on a personal level but
S0441	no no no on a work level yeah
S0439	just on a work or experience level she'd get lose
S0441	yeah
S0439	so it's really
S0441	could she apply for anything else
S0439	i er she probably could be able to like her boss do say that if you want to look at another place say i don't really know if i want to cos i just i i love this place so much
S0441	mm
S0439	and i don't really know move somewhere else for nine months be er be a good idea like burn bridge or whatever but it's just so sad
S0441	but if she want to stay it might be the thing to do
S0439	mm
S0441	didn't realise it be so complicate
S0439	yeah i know it's ridiculous it's so complicate and i be think like for relationships and stuff how how er complicate it must be but i don't think it be i think you can get something like erm if you're like in a long term serious relationship you can get something which be like a travel like a a partner visa basically erm but no
S0441	what do do
S0439	's half british
S0441	ah
S0439	so he have a dual passport
S0439	well she's actually half italian but
S0441	oh
S0439	they move too long before she be bear to get the or when no actually she might've be like one or two when she be when they move over and so they didn't
S0441	yeah
S0439	she couldn't get them yeah she couldn't get the dual nationality or something er something shit like that
S0441	mm
S0439	and i think one of her siblings have have a dual nationality passport but she doesn't
S0441	really
S0439	yeah
S0439	so
S0441	she need to get marry to him
S0439	that's what we be like we be like just fuck marry her for christ's sake
S0441	well what if he's face with the dilemma that she have to leave surely he will cos he he doesn't know that do he
S0439	yeah he
S0439	well no he doesn't know that she have to leave but he's kind of like when you leave i'll probably leave or i'll go somewhere else or but apparently like he want to live like in other place he might move to the us and stuff like
S0441	okay
S0439	she's kind of doesn't think that he think further ahead than like when he when he's in a relationship with he doesn't really think outside the box he just kind of well he doesn't think into the future but then it's weird because like he tell that he's like he think he's ready for a girlfriend and ready for a relationship and everything and it's like but she's there
S0441	mm
S0439	she's right there and the only thing you're not get from from what you would get from another girl be sex but i'm sure if you turn round to and say you want sex she'd do it
S0441	mm
S0439	you know and then you would be in a proper relationship like everything you would get from a girlfriend be what he already get from apart from the physical side of it but that's because he hasn't
S0441	try
S0439	try or even like hint that he want it like they they be practically in a relationship apart from that
S0441	yeah
