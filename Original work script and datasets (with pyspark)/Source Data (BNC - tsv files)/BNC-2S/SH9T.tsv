S0324	oh yeah it's like
S0325	mizzle rain yeah i do that i don't know what mizzle mean
S0324	neither do i
S0325	yeah and then be ask about erm
S0324	oh yeah something to do with metaphor and
S0325	yeah something that word
S0324	allergy
S0325	analogy
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	that's it yeah but erm i don't know what that mean either
S0324	neither do i know
S0325	so many word
S0324	so many word like i bet she she understand everything like if you give her this text with like
S0325	i dunno a nineteen fifteen novel
S0324	yeah just with random word she'd know what all of them be
S0325	yeah she'd know like whenever we do the definitions on the board she always know what they be miss be like
S0324	oh do anyone know they
S0325	anyone know what they be and she's 's like yeah me me i know what they be
S0324	and then whenever you ask her she won't explain it she's actually quite nice she's not that bad
S0325	she's nice yeah
S0324	because she do explain things to you and stuff
S0325	yeah i feel really i feel really stupid sit next to her though because she know all these word and i'm like be this a metaphor no this be a simile because it's it use like a noun but i do know what a metaphor be i be just
S0324	like if you ask her like what do this random word mean she'd know exactly what it mean and explain it quite well
S0325	yeah i i think erm me and today in art be fail so bad and she you know because the thigh to the knee be mean to have two head
S0324	yeah
S0325	she only put one and i be like no no no no down to the down to the foot and i be like that's wrong because you have to put another head and she be like but miss get really angry because everyone be talk yeah
S0324	i be yeah erm and i think be really good at draw what she can see but not as good as at like the head like proportion
S0325	yeah
S0324	she never really measure it
S0325	follow it she's more good at observation
S0324	yeah like when she's draw that face she didn't like you know erm miss be tell us how the nose be like one eye or something
S0325	yeah and still look good cos she doesn't have the motivation but i'm not like good with that i like to know
S0324	and she can kind of make it look right without do little stuff
S0325	just by treasure little stuff yeah
S0324	yeah it's like whenever i draw a face i have to do like the cross thing so i know where the eye be
S0325	yeah same yeah and do halfway and then halfway down that
S0324	i start with the face cos start with the eye
S0325	yeah i start with the eye
S0324	i do the face shape and cross and then i start with the eye
S0325	i use to do that but then miss say it's better to do the face first then draw the shape of the face
S0324	yeah she say that to us but i didn't do it
S0325	oh
S0324	yeah but you can't do it when you're do the thing because you need to have the head size to be able to measure out the proportion
S0325	yeah but i think yeah but i think what she mean be the shape of the head
S0324	yeah
S0325	because i i find that quite hard and i can't do the i'm not very good at the erm eye and the mouth and nose and stuff
S0324	yeah
S0325	i ask her
S0324	yeah
S0325	what be i go to say
S0325	have you have you look at the french thing have you do that
S0324	which one what
S0325	the paragraph that we have to do do we not have to learn that
S0324	well well we don't because they're not go to see us because they're just gonna see this thing so it doesn't matter
S0325	dull
S0324	yeah so it doesn't matter if
S0325	remember to get some blu tack
S0324	oh yeah i don't have any
S0325	and you have to neither do i
S0324	we can get some
S0325	and i need to remember to bring my iphone on that day to record but i don't have imovie on my iphone
S0324	yeah well then you can send your clip to me i can get it on the mac and then
S0325	i've get it i've get imovie on my ipad
S0324	oh yeah well it be better on the mac cos then we can do it easier and you can come round and we can do it
S0325	okay yeah
S0324	and if i realise if the sound isn't very good so if you just hear like background noise you can always use this microphone and just record our voice again
S0325	oh yeah and just have the the person
S0324	just have the picture and record like a track over the top
S0325	and mute that one
S0324	yeah yeah
S0325	i be with and i saw millions of picture on her snapchat of 's party i think
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	there there be i think there be quite a few people there but compare to erm that girl from her party
S0324	oh yeah something like that
S0325	yeah but everyone seem to know i'm not sure who be but
S0324	yeah oh yeah she
S0325	she's friends with
S0324	yeah
S0325	she's not actually pretty
S0324	everyone say she's pretty
S0325	i've only like see her once and like photo on instagram or something but i think she be in the year above us and
S0324	in our year look so much older
S0325	yeah but in her instagram photos look about fifty
S0324	yeah yeah because she do it like black and white and she put so much makeup on you can't see it very clear so it's just like yeah
S0325	makeup on i don't know it's all i don't know what she's take next year for her options like dance and do she no she doesn't take dance do she
S0324	no she doesn't take dance
S0325	choose dance as her first option
S0324	her first
S0325	her first option then art then
S0324	but when's she actually gonna use dance though
S0325	and if you wanna be a dancer you have to go to stage school and
S0324	yeah you have to
S0325	and you have do proper train have a a dance gcse isn't really go to be a dance teacher
S0324	yeah
S0325	it doesn't really help anything but she's take she's take dance art philosophy and ethics and
S0324	yeah why do she want to do
S0325	and like french or something i but philosophy and ethics doesn't count as a humanities so if you're gonna take philosophy and ethics you might as well take history instead and get the english baccalaureate yeah
S0324	yeah
S0325	because i don't know
S0324	well she like philosophy and ethics i don't oh
S0325	miss miss have her next year as well which be go to be fun and then i don't understand why in year eleven because we don't have philosophy and ethics any more we have to have like what be it citizenship or something
S0324	oh yeah something like that
S0325	yeah
S0324	like pshe day
S0325	yeah twice every two weeks why should be do something a bite more important like maths

S0324	erm no we have two four lessons every two weeks
S0325	four lessons every two weeks i think it's the same or five five i think every two weeks for pe
S0324	at the moment we have four
S0325	yeah but i think next year we have five that's what they say but i don't understand why unless you're take gcse pe
