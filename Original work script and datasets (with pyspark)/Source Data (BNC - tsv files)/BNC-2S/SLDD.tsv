S0439	no erm so what yeah we turn up obviously on the thursday night and we get in at about one and the well no about twelve and the taxi driver we've get a taxi from the airport to the place cos we don't wanna be wander around in the dark erm and then we once we arrive like on the street where we be stay there be a police car and them like deal with some scruffians or whatever you wanna call them ruffians so we be like great this be the entrance to our street and then you walk down the street and there be bar open and stuff but a lot of it be close and a lot of it just have like graffiti all down the side so it be like okay in the daytime it be really pleasant but at night everything just seem a bite erm yeah just unloved and vandalise and erm but it be it be nice but erm like unlike paris where like you know the eiffel tower and notre dame and and the louvre be all kind of like really close to each other in barcelona they're not like one's like up here by five kilometres the next one be like down here by another how many kilometres and you just end up walk around try to find everything so you spend more time walk than actually sightsee but erm you can get like a tour bus and everything like that but because we be there for such a short period of time like none of us have really research how to use the public or what public transport to use
S0441	yeah
S0439	so we just kind of end up walk everywhere which be fine for me and but i think and be not use to the amount of walk
S0441	mm
S0439	so erm but it be really it be nice the first day we arrive and we go to like we wander round and we find this like festival thing
S0441	mm
S0439	erm and then go to in the even go to this erm massive light erm fountain exhibition like they have the beautiful it's it's not a stately home it's now the national museum but it look like it use to be palace or a stately home and it's like up erm up a hill with like fountains and like beautiful step and at the bottom there's this massive fountain and they have this music and water display and that be again miles away so you have to walk all the way there and you know when like you're in a city with people who like none of you know where you're go but you're the one who's kind of vaguely suggest do this and you end up be in charge so i be like okay let's walk this way and then when you kind of get the wrong way they're like you know it's not my fault i've never be here before
S0439	erm and then but we do see the er sagrada familia and that be amaze like really really impressive you've get to walk in and you're just like wow like it be incredible but it certainly be like a city definitely worth go to but it wasn't as pretty as some of the other cities i've be to well the beach be actually okay it's well quite a lot of people slag off the beach well i think it be fine
S0439	like i didn't think it be a bad beach although oh my god i've never see so much nakedness in my life

S0439	if it be slightly too bite you can just tighten the strap and it'll
S0441	yeah i suppose
S0439	be fine
S0441	i suppose that's adjustable isn't it
S0439	mm
S0441	doesn't matter so much
S0439	i guess it's better to go slightly too big
