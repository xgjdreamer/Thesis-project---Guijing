S0517	do he build it himself
S0558	yeah he do he do all the internal structure himself
S0517	wow
S0558	yeah erm he just get an electrician in and a and a plumber in to do some for the they've get they they turn the loft area into two bedrooms so the big land and a bathroom and then they put what be those windows call not the velux ones the one

S0517	yeah
S0558	erm two three at the front three at the bank and my brother do as i say all the work with the exception of
S0517	mm
S0558	he i think he do all the electrics he might have just get somebody in to to fit it all into the you know into the main
S0517	right yes yeah
S0558	cos you that have to be do doesn't it by a certificate electrician and that
S0517	i think it do these day
S0558	yeah yeah yeah what he do be he take i think it be six months off work but it be cheaper for him to take six months off work and do it himself
S0517	than to pay somebody to get
S0558	than to employ
S0517	really
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	gosh
S0558	yeah cos he be earn mega buck then
S0517	but anyway so
S0558	so
S0517	he's fill his garage with stuff and
S0558	so anyway erm and along obviously you know what it's like you get a skip and you start think what else can i get rid of what else can we and it be mention that and be gonna get rid of their piano which be a couple of years older than this one
S0517	right
S0558	but apparently my dad reckon the speakers be better on it he think he prefer the sound of that one to this one where i think this be more clear
S0517	right
S0558	i think dad's be a bite bite sound a bite more bassy sort of echoey to me anyway he prefer that one so he's keep that one but be say we're gonna get rid of the piano and my dad say he say why be we get rid of the piano why be we get rid of the he say because it's never play oh but i might play it this summer
S0517	typical there's there's that's
S0517	the way isn't it
S0558	yeah
S0517	soon as you threaten to get rid of something they want it
S0558	yeah
S0517	but if you if you'd get rid of it without them know they would never ask for it
S0558	no she probably wouldn't have even notice
S0517	no no
S0558	but erm my dad say do you know he say i'm convince it would have end up on the skip i say you be joke
S0517	gosh
S0558	and he go i i
S0517	that's a lot of money to throw on a skip
S0558	a hell of a lot of money i don't think it would i think would have perhaps put it on ebay or wherever but that's how the talk be oh get rid get rid of it have enough of it can't understand why because it's in a room there's two sort of chair in there
S0517	mm
S0558	and there's a where there's a bed to fold down if cos erm one two three four it's five bedroomed house but and have their own bedrooms
S0517	do they
S0558	and they have do for a long time
S0517	do they sleep separately then
S0558	yeah
S0517	oh why
S0558	cos wake up in the night
S0517	gonna have one of those
S0558	fling her arm and kick her legs and scream apparently
S0517	do she be she have
S0558	apparently
S0517	be she have nightmares do she remember it
S0558	yes i think she have something
S0517	do she remember it in the morning
S0558	i don't know whether she do but but he get to yeah
S0517	reckon he's he's just tell her she's do that so
S0558	that's true yeah so he can you know sleep proper erm it get to the stage where say i've have enough of this i'm move out
S0517	mm
S0558	and go to his own bedroom and years probably
S0517	oh okay
S0558	ten years i've sleep in separate bedrooms
S0517	gosh
S0558	i know
S0517	right so they've get one spare bedroom
S0558	mm
S0517	so be that where the piano be
S0558	yeah but because because it's not use as a bedroom they have the piano a couple of chair in it and then a a bed you could fold down
S0517	mm
S0558	as and when need when 's mum stop or dad so it it be in a room they could have just
S0517	mm
S0558	leave it and forget it be there really it's a shame really but 's benefit by it
S0517	well yeah because you've get that
S0558	mm
S0517	and how do your dad get the piano up to his
S0558	in the back of his car
S0517	do he
S0558	cos the side come off the side come off and the top sort of sit on the frame
S0517	oh gosh
S0558	mm
S0517	i'm amaze i wouldn't even have
S0558	i know
S0517	think about try to
S0558	i've get to repair this foot because erm dad be do some work in the house and there be a water leak and this foot get damage so we just need to sort of stick this down and colour it in and then you probably
S0517	yeah

S0558	mm
S0517	accord to quite a few people haven't come back it's
S0558	say to me he there be talk that quite a few be not go back
S0517	well business study in particular he say there be probably twenty people before erm well before their exams i suppose he have one lesson where there be only eight of them but i don't know whether that be a one off i haven't ask him but he'd business study seem to be the one most hit and now 's the only boy do pe cos
S0517	and leave so it's him and five girls
S0558	oh
S0517	say oh you might get a girlfriend
S0517	he's come home the last couple of days and he's have stuff draw over his hand he's have a big heart here and stuff all up his arm i say what be go on he say well it's like it's like i'm a novelty cos i'm the only boy
S0517	i say well where do all this happen he go well actually that happen in geography i say well
S0558	oh
S0517	i say well he say well we've only get we've get and they don't talk to the girls so er
S0517	it's like i'm a novelty
S0517	they're just draw on me and fawn over me
S0517	that'll wear off
S0558	oh bless him
S0517	so but er
S0558	he's gonna make up for lose time
S0517	oh
S0558	he'll have five on the go
S0517	who know but erm i don't think have decide what he's do yet
S0558	i
S0517	he's get two options hasn't he i've hear
S0558	i don't know just say to me he think he's go to college for business study
S0517	right well speak to him this week
S0558	ah
S0517	and he's still get two options he's be offer a place at that you know they're open the academy for football
S0558	no
S0517	you possibly didn't you don't have one that play football i only know cos of but there's a new academy so you know like at the academy for football
S0558	yes
S0517	and he go up there i mean he's really good he get pay for play i think it's the same one
S0558	gosh
S0517	go to but he doesn't
S0558	oh right
S0517	get pay to play
S0558	yeah
S0517	erm they're open a academy but obviously city be not quite in the same football league as
S0558	mm
S0517	so and erm and this be the new the first year so there's he's go for the trials and have be offer a place there so i'm not entirely sure what he'd come out with other than play football and apparently you could carry on with your a level or
S0558	oh
S0517	because there be talk that he might do them at the if that's his option or some of them or one of them or pe or something so there be some
S0558	right
S0517	tie in there and his other option be to go to college and do a business study btec which say be the equivalent of three a level and so basically he will come out with what he be go to get
S0558	yeah
S0517	the equivalent of three a level but just a year later cos it's like start again in effect
S0558	cos it's a two year course
S0517	it's a two year course same as a level
S0558	mm
S0517	or btec equivalent so erm he say to he doesn't know what to do from a money point of view in term of his future and a career he think he should do the business study course but from an enjoyment point of view and what he really like he'd like to go to the football academy
S0558	oh yeah
S0517	but either way he's sort of lose a year really
S0558	well i know
S0517	well
S0558	i mean if he's gonna go down the the sensible route then surely he'd be better off
S0517	he may as well just stay
S0558	return to
S0517	may as well have just stay at school and get his three a level and one of those
S0558	yeah
S0517	be business study
S0558	it would be over in a year
S0517	and be do with it i know i know
S0558	mm
S0517	it seem a bite silly doesn't it
S0558	perhaps er 's be say of late how oh they still treat us like children and i say actually they probably don't what you'll find be you're ready to move on you're probably
S0517	mm yeah
S0558	ready to move on now and bear in mind you're one of the oldest
S0517	yes
S0558	they're probably not you're probably ready for that next stage
S0517	yes absolutely
S0558	like when you get to year six
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	and it's all a bite you know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	too much
S0517	yeah i mean doesn't find that he doesn't find that they treat them like children and he particularly like the pe department
S0558	mm
S0517	he really do
S0558	i know but he's lose his teacher hasn't he
S0517	he have lose his teacher they have replace a teacher but this be the other thing erm they be do the sports' leaders qualification which only mr be qualify to hand out so cos i ask what they're do about that he say we be carry on with it but they have to get somebody through the course qualify to hand out the actual diploma or whatever it be you get
S0558	right
S0517	which won't happen until september because that person's get to go through the course so if you don't come back you won't get award it
S0558	mm
S0517	so have be do it but he won't get award it because there's nobody at the who be able to award it to him at the moment
S0558	oh dear
S0517	i know but also they haven't finish i mean they're still
S0558	no
S0517	they're still do it
S0558	yeah
S0517	so erm i dunno there's a lot a lot to think about but yeah but doesn't find that they treat him like a child he just like
S0558	no
S0558	mm
S0517	always you know always have do he's not really an academic but erm anyway he's he's go back
S0558	be he go back
S0517	yes well obviously
S0558	mm
S0517	we're wait for the result on result day
S0558	yeah
S0517	but the plan be he's go back
S0558	i don't to be i think be they that strict that if you don't get a percentage of you can't go back
S0517	no no no they're not they're not i think you could go back with all es but i think he worry that it would be too hard for him if he only come out with if he come out with really poor grade in his as level he's say so many people have tell him
S0558	oh really
S0517	that the second year get harder again i think he just
S0558	mm
S0517	worry that he won't be able to
S0558	just gonna blow my nose
S0517	to do it but erm
S0558	oh
S0517	anyway we'll wait and see we'll see how that go in erm in august
S0558	bless him
S0517	but yeah
S0558	do you know i've look that that black cover more than i've look at the furniture again this year
S0517	er well we've sit out quite a bite actually
S0558	have you
S0517	i think because ours isn't cover up er and it's just through the back door
S0558	yeah
S0517	and every time the sun come out like
S0517	if we hadn't have be watch stuff on the telly today we probably would have have our lunch out there today
S0558	see i erm we we've be throw the cover over that because of the way the rain be so heavy
S0517	yes oh yeah
S0558	but i agree with you i know it sound bad but i think if we go straight out that way
S0517	i i be just about to say to you if you
S0558	we'd use it a lot more
S0517	if you just open that door you'd use it like i think it's because it's ours be so accessible
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	it's literally just there and we think we'll grab a cushion on the way through in the utility and we've have it and we've have our meals out there quite quite often when it every time it's warm enough
S0558	mm
S0517	we just put the cushion out and put the place mat out there so
S0558	yeah it's
S0517	instead of the kitchen
S0558	yeah
S0517	it's so accessible
S0558	yeah
S0517	but you yeah if you open that door
S0558	i i know it's not a
S0517	i know it's not but i know exactly what you mean
S0558	but it's the psychology isn't it
S0517	it be and 's the same in her house because they'd have to go through the yeah
S0558	through the lounge and that
S0517	they're the same the the lounge or the utility
S0558	be the lounge at the back
S0517	the lounge at the back but they they've get a door up
S0558	yeah
S0517	through the utility
S0558	yeah
S0517	and round and
S0558	yeah
S0517	and they're the same
S0558	i say to when erm when we need to redecorate cos the long term plan be always that eventually we would get rid of that window and have erm either
S0517	but your
S0558	a low window
S0517	mm
S0558	so but just more light come in
S0517	yeah
S0558	but what i'm say to now be i think we'll have
S0517	doors
S0558	a door or doors
S0517	yeah that's a good idea
S0558	erm and i know it's a bite awkward because of the table but i think it still give you that choice doesn't it
S0517	oh er yes i think so i think that would be nice yeah
S0558	mm
S0517	mm
S0558	i know we could walk in and out of here but that's as far as i'm
S0517	i dunno and i think because we do i think because you've
S0558	cover it up
S0517	get that table there as well it's almost like the the stop
S0558	yeah
S0517	you well no if you be go out there if there be doors there you'd whoever's there
S0558	i just yeah
S0517	would just pass it to that person and that person would
S0558	that's it yeah
S0517	and you'd go out and that would be that
S0558	i do think the set up doesn't help and the fact
S0517	mm
S0558	cos i say to this year i say i'm not cover the furniture up this year i say because
S0517	be it wood
S0558	no no no it's that rattan stuff
S0517	oh okay
S0558	say i'm not cover up this year say spend most of the summer last year look at a big black bag
S0517	yeah
S0558	but you know when you it's not easily replaceable
S0517	yeah
S0558	you can't just go out and spend five six hundred pound
S0517	no
S0558	do you know what i mean
S0517	no no so you want to look after it
S0558	i mean we only get that because i sell my car
S0517	yeah no i remember you say
S0558	yeah
S0517	but you do want to look after it but also erm it have when it's rain it's rain so heavily
S0558	well this be it
S0517	i know i know
S0558	it's so heavy and then i'm think to myself cos the bird table there we're constantly gonna get poo so then it actually before you sit down you've gotta start wipe it over which be longer than just whip a bag off isn't it
S0517	yeah it be it be i know what you mean
S0558	but we're hop to get in the garden tonight
S0517	we're go to
S0558	the grass be grow like billy o isn't it
S0517	i know
S0558	isn't it
S0517	get ours for us this week i know he just say be er where be
S0517	can't even remember he wasn't at home but yes he say i'm gonna cut the back grass mum i say alright then cos i can't start that mower i've never
S0558	they're so hard like that
S0517	i never well i say i can't i haven't try for years but when we get it
S0558	mm
S0517	i try a few time and i could never start it so i that that i think it's my mow days over
S0558	well the
S0517	but do
S0558	and the strength deteriorate as you get older you know
S0517	but do they
S0558	yes i mean
S0517	start it
S0558	suddenly be weaker now
S0517	can and he cut the grass so you know that be nice have his have his use now his room's still a pigsty but he cut the grass
S0558	well i say to the other day ring and ask him if he want to go on a run cos she come in and i have tell her a long time ago first of all i hear when she start go out run i say stick to the village
S0517	yes
S0558	just the lanes
S0517	yeah
S0558	and do the village erm and i think she'd do lane with a couple of time or whatever you know the you know and all this and that i say don't do that on your own and then this once she ask me would i go with her cos she want to do a five mile run
S0517	mm
S0558	she want to go up that long stretch for tesco and she say oh i didn't really like it when i do it on my own i say you run up there on your own i say oh you shouldn't really be run up there on your own it's a bite you know
S0517	it's all the lorry drivers
S0558	bite out of the way
S0517	i run up there once or twice in the past
S0558	mm
S0517	and it i know what i know what she mean i'm
S0558	yeah
S0517	much happier round the lanes
S0558	yeah
S0517	even though it's emptier and
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	but it's the lorry drivers they there's something a little bite unnerve about run up there
S0558	yeah
S0517	which i couldn't quite put my finger on
S0558	yeah this it's so i tell her not to
S0517	mm
S0558	yeah so then she she come in i'm gonna go for a run erm no it be last week she be gonna go for a i say where be you go cos i think as long as i know where she's go if she don't turn up you
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know
S0517	yeah
S0558	at least you know you know she's fell down a ditch or break her ankle
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	and smash
S0517	do she take her phone cos doesn't take
S0558	she do i think yeah
S0517	his
S0558	yeah and erm she say er something about erm oh i'm gonna do lane i say i've tell you not to do that but it's oh i've be do it i but i tell you not to she's terrible
S0517	but when be you gonna let her though
S0558	and i tell you not to
S0517	to be fair i mean she be i would let her now i think
S0558	it's very quiet round there
S0517	i've run round there
S0558	do you
S0517	yes
S0558	mm
S0517	i run round there and i've never once felt in any way you see cyclists
S0558	yeah you do
S0517	you see walkers
S0558	yeah
S0517	the
S0558	yeah
S0517	you see tractors you get the odd car
S0558	yeah the odd car
S0517	but really it's just
S0558	oh no it be relatively safe
S0517	it be
S0558	but i say no you shouldn't be go round there on your own so anyway she drag out cos she want to do the big one again up along tesco's she drag out and he accompany her
S0517	do he run
S0558	on his bike
S0517	oh on his bike
S0558	yeah on his bike
S0517	yes she should ring because he
S0558	i say why don't you give a ring
S0517	he's be run quite a bite lately
S0558	mm
S0517	erm he do he run cos he be train for the athletics at school which have
S0558	right
S0517	come and go now the fifteen hundred metres he do very well he get invite to the county thing he didn't do that but he get a new personal best he be very happy but he be just do run around the village in fact i be out walk one time and and i be walk back along the canal and i hear him shout mum and i turn around and he be run up the canal which i say oh
S0517	i don't know whether you should be run up here anyway he do he run off carry on but he say to me er one night he say i'm gonna go and do the run the the run that i do which be about five kilometres
S0558	mm
S0517	just short of five kilometres really i say okay i mean it take me best part of half an hour twenty eight minutes he run it in about oh i dunno twenty or something so he's much quicker than i be but anyway he go out and he be go a while and i you know when you sort of look at your clock and think oh i hope he's alright he
S0558	yeah
S0517	he should be back by now and i'm think i wonder if i wasn't really pay attention to what time he go
S0558	yeah
S0517	and he won't take his phone so you do think oh i wonder if he's fall over oh no he's probably just meet somebody and he's anyway eventually he come back in he'd be go about forty five maybe fifty minutes i say be you alright he say yeah i do it twice so he'd just run a quick ten k
S0517	in about
S0558	oh my god
S0517	he say oh and the second lap be better actually i enjoy the second lap more i
S0558	well i think should run with him because
S0517	i can't do that
S0558	she'd she go out of here and and it it's just short of five miles she do and she's do it in something like forty minutes
S0517	yeah they'd run well together
S0558	they'd run well together
S0517	yeah they would
S0558	yeah
S0517	they would
S0558	i should say to her look why don't you just organise one night
S0517	mm
S0558	to meet up with
S0517	just to try it out
S0558	give it a go trial it if either of you you know if your pace isn't right
S0517	yeah
S0558	then but it's good encouragement as well isn't it
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	if you think right go for a run
S0517	oh no yeah definitely i mean i can't guarantee what he'd say to be honest
S0558	oh no no
S0517	but erm
S0558	but erm
S0517	he's not a dedicate runner
S0558	no
S0517	he's he be do because he's in train for the
S0558	he might do his er
S0517	for the erm it's a long way to go to train for a fifteen hundred metres isn't it ten k anyway
S0517	but he like to just be fit he like to be fit
S0558	yeah
S0517	for the football season
S0558	i mean say i prefer to run on my own and i the gym even she prefer to go on her own
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	she say because otherwise you're
S0517	well i and i know again what she mean
S0558	mm
S0517	because you're you can do your own pace then and you're not feel under pressure to go a bite faster than you want or a bite slower than you want
S0558	no no
S0517	so i do understand what what she mean
S0558	she do something every day
S0517	do she
S0558	if she's not at the athletics she's at the gym or she's go out for a run
S0517	be you at the gym
S0558	all the time
S0517	have you be
S0558	all the time in my thoughts
S0517	have you be
S0558	i think about it all the time every day i think about it several time but i haven't quite get there
S0517	you haven't be
S0558	oh i've gotta do something
S0517	have another shortbread
S0558	haven't i always
S0517	oh
S0558	well actually i be very good in the month of may
S0517	be you
S0558	i give up all sugar i never have biscuit cake
S0558	a a biscuit
S0517	how much weight do you lose
S0558	i do actually how much i don't know
S0517	wow
S0558	but i do
S0517	wow i'm not surprise
S0558	i lose a few pound
S0517	yeah
S0558	so i the last couple of weeks i've be well the month of may finish didn't it so i think
S0558	oh i can have a biscuit now and you know when you a bite on overkill
S0517	oh
S0558	so i think do you know actually i feel more tire again now than i do through the month of may i felt great in the month of may
S0517	really
S0558	cos i wasn't load with sugar be i
S0517	then you should try and do that again
S0558	i'm do it again i'm do it again forever but i've have no chocolate or sweets
S0517	no
S0558	at all
S0517	since january
S0558	no so i'm just gonna give it all up
S0517	do you find it difficult in may
S0558	erm no because i'd make my mind up say i say say
S0517	resolve of steel
S0558	i know when i make my mind up why can't i just
S0517	yeah
S0558	i no not at all
S0517	i i would find it difficult
S0558	no i be fine i didn't
S0517	my biggest problem be wine isn't it it's full of sugar
S0558	mm yeah but anyway i don't yeah but i think what i'm gonna do i've decide i think be i'm gonna give it all up give up biscuits cake and all the rest of it but if i get together like this with a friend and you have a cup of coffee it's okay to have a piece of cake or a biscuit
S0517	yes cos otherwise it just get
S0558	cos it doesn't happen that often
S0517	just get life just get dull
S0558	yeah
S0517	if you can't have a biscuit now and again yes
S0558	yeah
S0517	yeah no i that's a good idea
S0558	so so i might be rely on see you
S0558	a lot more
S0558	so i think i might do that i might do that thing because i be
S0517	mm
S0558	feel better
S0517	well that that
S0558	than i do look in the mirror and think
S0517	that in itself should be incentive shouldn't it

S0558	yeah
S0517	at that age

S0517	mm
S0558	she say erm lunch menus although you could still be
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	pay three hundred pound for lunch in comparison to the even menu
S0517	oh okay
S0558	so she
S0517	that must be different in london
S0558	so she say i'm think if i'm gonna do it i'm gonna make it lunchtime cos it's
S0517	yeah well we go at lunch as you know and we have what they call it sound dreadful really it's call brummie tapas so you could do like a a a normal lunch or there be erm there be two different taste ones or it say you can so this brummie tapas which i just like the sound of the examples that it give you and it say you sit in our comfortable er live room and the chefs come out and serve you personally and talk you through what you're what you're have and i think well that sound just a little bite more interest
S0558	yeah
S0517	so there be five course so and as it turn out there be like one long table in the room that you sort of go into there be comfy chair in it so that's the room where you sit when you first arrive and have a drink and then there be another room that people be go through to to just sit and have lunch but we didn't go through to that we stay in this room and it be like a high er a high table with sort of high chair and and i think it say on the website the maximum they would have would be eight but and i be the only two sit there don't know whether you do it like all together i don't know but we be the only two sit there so we have five course and each course be bring out by a different chef i mean consider they we ask them there be like thirty five people in for lunch and erm and us and then she say they have eleven chefs on eleven chefs that day there be at least six people front of house the service be absolutely fantastic
S0558	wow
S0517	they be so attentive but not intrusive it be just amaze so we sit there and there be two little er there be a little a plate with two like little round white things they look like mint and erm you know er and i say to her what be those and she say all will be reveal she say but they aren't edible so please don't eat those anyway so we can out he come out with the first course which be erm gosh i can't remember now the er mad as it sound there be this homemade loaf of bread that be just the nicest bread i've ever have there be these erm what be they call those churros with parmesan
S0558	oh yeah
S0517	there be erm oh i can't remember what they all be now it be a few weeks ago there be a couple of different things but you be use your your finger to eat this first bite and then he say and then now i'll show you what these be and he get this jug of hot water and he pour it over what i think be mint and they just grow and they turn out to be serviettes it be incredible to watch they just grow and these you know like the hot serviettes they give you in a chinese restaurant
S0558	oh wow
S0517	yeah and they be be roll up really tightly so we have those for afterwards erm and then we have we have oh one be beef and octopus but this octopus have be do for five hours in red wine it be so nice but like i say every the presentation be unbelievable one of them be be something that be like beetroot mousse well i don't like beetroot and i think i'm not gonna like this one come out didn't really look anything like you'd expect i taste it it be delicious and i'm think i don't even like beetroot it be lovely but the er the dessert oh we have lamb slow roast lamb my goodness
S0558	oh
S0517	you just literally put your knife in it just fell apart with ph tomatoes they call them but there be different colour tomatoes and one have be do in like er honey and lemon and one have be do in something else they be everything be so excuse me
S0558	oh wow
S0517	so nice and we have this absolutely fantastic dessert and then at the end there there be it be call chocky mint chocky it be call so again they bring out this glass bowl with like a hole in and something at the bottom wasn't really sure what and on the top of it it just look like dead twig to be honest it it didn't look at all appetising and i think what be that literally just look like a dead twig erm but they say no no that's not edible don't panic so then another chef come out and he give us our it be like a a chocolaty minty mousse thing he say and then this be what this be and he pour this water onto this thing and it be dry ice at the bottom so the whole but the and the twig be dry mint i hadn't realise so the whole whole table's cover in this dry ice and he have this really strong aroma of mint as you be eat your chocolate mint he say it's just you know a a little touch we do
S0558	oh wow
S0517	for the sense it be absolutely it be incredible it be so so nice
S0558	an experience
S0517	it be a but i mean actually the food wasn't it wasn't that it be fifty five pound a head which i didn't think be that bad
S0558	no
S0517	for all everything that we have and then they add twelve and a half per cent service it say that before you book so you know that so sixty something a head and then erm they give us a big wine list and i be drive at the other end you know from the station and then i have to do the drive for that
S0558	you should have say could have
S0517	i'll no no but there be still the boys to do tennis and everything so we be out in the day so it be fine but i say to do you want a bottle of wine and he say well i'll have a look so they buy us this wine book the book be about this thick be a bottle of wine in there for sixteen hundred pound
S0517	i say to the erm the guy i say how many of those do you keep in stock he say well we just keep the one actually and we've have it since we've open
S0517	and there be also another one at three hundred pound from the lebanon i say i would never ever have consider the lebanon as a wine make region
S0558	no
S0517	so you know he talk us through that and a bite of the history and why that be anyway we settle on a much much more modest bottle for which i think be incredibly expensive at forty nine pound
S0517	i say i've never pay so much for a bottle of wine erm but i say go on it's your birthday go on i say that's like erm you know four hours' proofread
S0517	gonna have to work four hours to do that for you
S0517	anyway so he ask for this wine and the guy go i'm ever so sorry i haven't get that one he say but i have get this one and it's really really nice and it be one below but that be sixty so sort of look at me and go yes
S0517	i say to him blink heck man i say that's that's a full day's that's a full day's proofread for me
S0517	so you can sit and have that lovely bottle of red wine so i have a glass of it and it be very nice but do you know what er sixty pound nice i don't know but anyway

S0517	hospital be you alright yeah
S0558	what's wrong
S0517	yeah
S0558	no so you think oh as and when i bump into you like she well do you know be in a care home and i say
S0517	i can't even picture them
S0558	no
S0517	i'm not sure who they be
S0558	er they're very private people
S0517	i know the build you mean so i possibly
S0558	yeah
S0517	must have see them
S0558	you might have see run around the village and it almost look like he'd have a stroke
S0517	mm
S0558	he's the way he sort of hold his arm
S0517	oh
S0558	quite small slight man and 's erm again slim dark hair but they're quite private people
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	i mean i wouldn't know them if it wasn't for avon
S0517	oh okay
S0558	you know they don't
S0517	okay
S0558	don't get involve in children be grow up now
S0517	mm
S0558	thirty two and thirty four but erm but anyway she have breast cancer
S0517	oh
S0558	all that be sort and do didn't cope with it very well he's get parkinson's disease didn't cope with it very well i think it sort of erm speed up his condition you know accelerate his
S0517	mm
S0558	symptoms and that unfortunately she have erm septicaemia
S0517	oh dear
S0558	she be whisk into hospital very very poorly really do not cope with it and have a mental breakdown and then do a
S0517	how how old be they so if their kid be thirties
S0558	yeah
S0517	seventies
S0558	i wouldn't i do you know i don't even think they're seventy yet
S0517	sixties i mean
S0558	yeah
S0517	about sixties
S0558	i would say mid to late
S0517	gosh
S0558	mid mid to late sixties dunno he hasn't be at work for quite some time i think but i think that may be perhaps due to his condition i don't know so i don't know whether he's sort of officially
S0517	mm
S0558	i would say they're probably gonna be sixty five plus but i don't think they're quite seventy yet so erm he have a mental breakdown and end up in hospital a mental hospital for two months again
S0517	gosh
S0558	it accelerate his condition he he go on to have a couple of small stroke and basically now through the septicaemia she's get heart damage so her leave ventricle isn't work properly she get very tire de de de de de de this condition she's get erm you can either get better from it but it can take eighteen months two years stay as it be and it's permanent damage
S0517	that's how you be
S0558	and all the rest of it
S0517	yeah
S0558	or it can get worse so she's obviously hop she's in that i'm gonna get better stage but eighteen months on she's only just start to feel better
S0517	be she and that's quite a big house to live in on your own isn't it
S0558	well 's in a care home erm she say i think i'm perhaps gonna have to move and and i say initially oh oh just shut room off it's such a shame you know it's your
S0517	mm
S0558	sort of family home i don't they've she's live there as long as i've do avon so that's fifteen years so it's plus their girls use to go to school here erm i say shut room off rather than leave you know she say yeah she but it's you know it's just so
S0517	that's at the back of your mind though
S0558	big when you're on your own
S0517	that eventually you're go to have to leave
S0558	eventually
S0517	so you may as well do it while you're
S0558	i don't know
S0517	well
S0558	whether she's have to pay for 's
S0517	right
S0558	care so be it financial
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	or or
S0517	it could be that
S0558	like you say it's a big home to look after all by yourself isn't it
S0517	where's which home be he in do you know
S0558	er yeah
S0517	be it close
S0558	the one at the back of now when nanna be in
S0517	didn't know there be one
S0558	when nan be in the home in the the the company the guy who own it get these plan to build a new one at the back of of which have be build but apparently somebody else own it now it's not the same man
S0517	right
S0558	that use to own the one in and that one close where nan be erm but the reason i be tell you this be because she say she go to visit him every day but she necessarily go she very definitely doesn't go at the same time every day because she doesn't want him sit there clock watch
S0517	wait
S0558	and wait for her
S0517	yes
S0558	to turn up
S0517	yeah
S0558	and her feel the pressure of i've get to be there
S0517	and he's in there that's it now for good
S0558	that's it he'll never come back home yeah he's you know he she can't look after him i think maybe the condition of his stroke you know
S0517	and parkinson's
S0558	and parkinson's but she say when she go to visit him if he's okay she say they'll go for a little walk into or wherever and she say do you know she say when you're limit with how where you can she do drive but when you're limit with how far you can go and so this big world have suddenly go like that she actually have get so much
S0517	have get load
S0558	to offer
S0517	i know
S0558	that we're so fast pace these days get on with our live that we don't actually
S0517	forget really that what's
S0558	realise
S0517	i know
S0558	what's on our doorstep
S0517	that's i don't know what's make me sort of think about that recently but i have i keep think we don't take advantage we don't
S0558	no
S0517	but that's great for her though if she can walk place from
S0558	well yeah yeah she say we go to or we go and sit by the cathedral
S0517	mm
S0558	and we have an ice cream there's endless choices of coffee a meal if we want you know some nice shop to look around
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	she say but so much more than just shop
S0517	yeah definitely
S0558	mm
S0517	i always i mean er you know when i'm in a park on a wednesday when we go for our run it's i always think oh so beautiful cos the cathedral you know

S0558	when i go whenever i go to that cathedral you know i every time i look with the same amount of enthusiasm and wonder of how do they do this
S0517	i know i know
S0558	when you think of the the lack of
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know machine and all the rest of it
S0517	i know
S0558	and the
S0517	it's amaze
S0558	the height of it and the structure and the carve and it's just amaze isn't it
S0517	i know i know
S0558	absolutely amaze and i mean you can understand why true craft men like stonemasons and you know all these people you can understand the frustration they have in modern day build can't you
S0517	oh yes yeah
S0558	and you'd look at something as spectacular at that
S0517	it's unbelievable mm mm
S0558	you know it's erm
S0517	yeah
S0558	and and and i suppose if the need be not there you're always gonna have maintenance aren't you but if the need be not there in the demand of like build and that that it's it die
S0517	yes yeah it do yeah yeah
S0558	it die
S0517	shall we have another coffee

S0558	mm
S0517	and then they'd have this talk about study leave be er as home study be a privilege not a right it'll be take away etcetera etcetera
S0558	i think that be when be say they treat us like children
S0517	oh okay
S0558	yeah
S0517	that's just a timely talk two days
S0558	mm
S0517	before the england match be on in and half the school not turn up anyway so they decide to stay in school and they be i don't know whether be watch it it they be stream the football weren't they and they have it
S0558	yeah in the classroom or something
S0517	hook up to a screen
S0558	yeah
S0517	in the classroom
S0558	yeah
S0517	and erm er they weren't suppose to be do this and there be a pe teacher next door
S0558	mm
S0517	who get wind that they be send somebody down to check that they weren't do this so apparently this pe teacher think it's the new one come in and say look guy there's somebody on their way minimise this screen and i'll tell them i haven't hear a thing
S0558	mm
S0517	and then they're just gonna come and check and then you can put it back on
S0558	good man
S0517	i think typical pe teacher
S0517	so that's what they do so they so they're all sit there watch the football ten minutes before the end of the lesson suddenly i don't know how true he be suddenly remember oh i'm mean to be next door in the guide study lesson with that pe teacher right he's mean to you know guide study
S0558	yeah

S0558	well they've do it before
S0517	well
S0558	they've do it before
S0558	cos i say to it's okay but highly unlikely but the erm in the event of a fire
S0517	fire
S0558	you're on the premise
S0517	premise yes i know
S0558	i say so you've gotta you've gotta
S0517	but i think it's quite a
S0558	deal with that
S0517	it's quite a poor system
S0558	if that's your
S0517	really
S0558	it be
S0517	that they can just walk out and nobody have notice
S0558	mm
S0517	which nobody do nobody do phone me

S0517	once
S0558	on a thursday but do you hear about that england match that erm they have pizzas pass through the classroom window or something

S0558	and i be stand there yesterday i be opposite the x ray department do you know i think every i think everybody in the world should do what i do for a week cos you you have a real
S0517	insight into who's come and go sort of
S0558	just just no a real sort of like insight as to how erm delicate life be do you know what i mean
S0517	mm
S0558	and i saw man i'm i'm stand off the the x ray department i saw this man be push up and he's he's get sort of like erm all shave here and he's there and he's full of and all the rest of it and he'd he'd obviously have a scan and i i hear them say we'll get you down for your ct ct scan as soon as we can and he's clothe so he be obviously have come in for an appointment i reckon son and wife with him and and as he be be push up i saw him clock my booth and er he obviously read the word and he just he he sort of just this massive sort of like and i think oh my god you've probably be tell you've get cancer you could just tell by the way
S0517	how yeah yeah of that he saw
S0558	he didn't look at me or nothing i could just tell
S0517	yeah
S0558	he'd see the word and all the rest of it and you think oh my god
S0517	it's awful
S0558	there be so many people
S0517	i know
S0558	so many people and and and like it be just after that that i think god you know everybody should do what i do be expose to what i'm expose to just for a week just to see how delicate life be
S0517	how delicate i know
S0558	and people that i think cos i'm a woman a lot of people come to speak to me
S0517	yes
S0558	and like particularly at the hospitals and they're come to visit you know and they'll say you know like oh mm erm this lady come a couple of weeks ago and again her open word be absolutely marvellous you people you know blah blah blah we be the second week of may and her husband have die on the first of may and she go on to tell me erm that she's gonna do erm a fundraise event at home in the garden and they're gonna get some paintballs and throw them at a big white sheet

S0517	gonna say it's not the end of the day yet i've get to be home and ready to go out at four thirty
S0558	oh really where
S0517	so don't let me go oh only to the tennis club obviously
S0558	oh
S0517	where else do i go
S0517	oh
S0558	erm
S0517	have get a match at five o'clock
S0558	do he
S0517	do his coach at five fifteen and he have offer to coach for half an hour before coach at on his backhand
S0558	oh
S0517	i be down there last night and for the first time 's erm enter the club tournament
S0558	be he do tennis
S0517	yeah he's be do tennis for a while now
S0558	oh i didn't know bless him
S0517	oh yes he have he's be go down there and this be the first time
S0558	ah
S0517	he's enter the club tournament and he he have this match last night but he lose he do alright but he's just he doesn't have a backhand if he can he'll run around and hit a forehand
S0558	oh
S0517	but every time he have to hit a backhand it be a it's a disaster have give him one lesson
S0558	mm
S0517	before and say it make a difference but she can see it's sort of wear off
S0558	mm
S0517	he need to practise
S0558	how much be lessons
S0517	with well he's not charge he can't er which be 's suggestion he's because we say to him it would be nice if he give him a free one i say but then we say i'm sure and wouldn't mind pay you and say well i don't think i'll ask them for money mum because didn't help me out a lot in primary school
S0558	oh of course yeah
S0517	i say she help you out an awful lot he say yeah
S0558	true
S0517	so i'm not gonna charge them
S0558	yeah that's true
S0517	which i think be very
S0558	of course that's very nice of him
S0517	you know very nice of him actually cos
S0558	yeah
S0517	obviously he's do it for money but erm but now for coach with i think he's ten pound for an hour
S0558	mm
S0517	and then he do it he get pay i think he only get pay seven for his that he do when he help the group sessions oh but this erm this middle age middle age lady have ask him to be her double partner in the club tournament cos he he hasn't enter double before but she's pick well with our so he's say yes and she's be have lessons from the head coach and it's twenty pound an hour and she's have enough lessons now she do doesn't want to spend any more money but erm she's ask would he hit with her not coach but just hit with her erm so he be a bite hesitant so she's pay him five pound an hour just to just to hit cos all she want if there's a particular shoot she want to practise she want the ball to come to the right place that she can
S0558	yeah
S0517	practise that shoot
S0558	yeah
S0517	and he can just
S0558	just he
S0517	he take a basket he take a basket of ball and he stand there and he's just wherever she want the ball to be to practise her shoot he can hit it to her so i i say i say i'm i'm not be funny i say that's great but i think five pound be a little bite cheap actually cos that's still an hour of your time
S0558	yeah
S0517	but anyway he say oh you know she be my double partner now so of course and i have be rib him we say well this be the slippery slope now if middle age ladies be gonna start pay you to hit tennis ball to them
S0517	's go if she invite you back to her house
S0517	just say no just say no because you know middle age ladies bore housewives a lot of them
S0517	if she
S0517	we've be rib something rotten so he go down and hit with her
S0558	oh
S0517	and then he come away and he say er well she's pay me for the next three sessions
S0558	in advance
S0517	in advance
S0517	so so er oh she like you you've gotta be careful here
S0558	oh bless him
S0517	you're only sixteen oh we do we often wind him up poor boy but erm
S0517	think well that's nice cos quite like he's gonna do another hour tomorrow but quite often on a saturday he have his two hours' coach nine to eleven that he get pay for quite often he want to stay down there cos he play again maybe at twelve but he's he's get an hour where he doesn't do anything
S0558	yeah so if she's fit it in
S0517	so if she's gonna come and fit in in that hour so even though it's only a a fiver but it's a fiver he wouldn't have have and he's happy to just
S0558	yeah
S0517	he take his basket and he just
S0558	well only charge five pound an hour for babysitting and that could be look after three children
S0517	well yeah it's not a lot be it
S0558	but it's still not a bad rate just for
S0517	er no
S0558	i know he charge ten but
S0517	it's not no i know it's not but i mean he he can charge ten for coach because he have do a lot of qualifications now
S0558	oh he's do be course yeah
S0517	he's do his course so we do we do need to get him a
S0558	but in the way of just knock a ball
S0517	yeah just
S0558	it's
S0517	it's just yeah no you're right
S0558	cos he hasn't gotta teach or anything have he
S0517	no he hasn't gotta teach
S0558	so he can just
S0517	no he just it's just different she want to practise
S0558	yeah
S0517	certain backhand volley and this and that and we just we watch him actually because he be do it while be play a match and go to watch play a match and in fact it be 's you know what we're like the whole family turn up to watch 's match rent a crowd as always say as we all pile up to watch
S0517	but it be 's that say to me i mean be down on the far far court with this middle age lady say you know what's think about do as a career i say i dunno he doesn't know why he say cos he look really comfortable he look really in his element teach that lady or hit with her he say he's just a natural
S0558	i never forget that time do you remember when 's one of his birthday
S0517	yeah
S0558	present out and me and be like god you would think he be and that be to my knowledge one of the first time he'd
S0517	he'd he'd
S0558	play tennis
S0517	i know
S0558	do you remember all them years ago
S0517	but no but it yeah
S0558	he be
S0517	yeah
S0558	absolutely a natural without a doubt
S0517	but he be say that a natural at at comfortable
S0558	yeah
S0517	coach teach do he want to do this
S0558	yeah but yeah
S0517	i yes i know
S0558	yeah
S0517	and i i say to i say well i say funnily enough at one point do suggest to him when he doesn't know what to do how about a pe teacher i say but you know the irony of that because he's hat school and he's hat every minute of be in school
S0558	mm
S0517	that's all he's ever want to do be leave i say if he go back as a job well i say we just
S0517	wouldn't be able to get over it
S0558	could you imagine
S0517	have spend all his life
S0558	he wouldn't
S0517	tell me he's quit
S0558	i mean like if you think i mean some of the like the you know what people must be pay down there for tennis
S0517	oh i know i know i know
S0558	coach for all their kid
S0517	that yes i know i know
S0558	and all the rest of it
S0517	well we say we've say to him you know if he want to go down that route why why doesn't he go off to spain or somewhere where they really take it seriously and there's lot of opportunities
S0558	yeah
S0517	and do a couple of years out there and just see whether it's for him and then cos it's almost
S0558	like education or go and
S0517	no go and
S0558	just go and work
S0517	coach go and work
S0558	work and
S0517	as a tennis coach
S0517	decide whether it's really what he want to do
S0558	mm
S0517	and then if you know if it be what he want to do
S0558	and from what age could he do that
S0517	dunno haven't really look
S0558	like would
S0517	into it probably
S0558	mm
S0517	i don't know
S0558	i be just wonder if there's any like you know sometimes people allow you to live with their family
S0517	yeah
S0558	type thing
S0517	yeah i just know he doesn't know what he want to do
S0558	mm doesn't
S0517	he really doesn't except he you know he doesn't wanna carry on study
S0558	mm
S0517	it's difficult isn't it
S0558	it's really hard because i mean if you go on to university you're talk four years
S0517	mm
S0558	i mean 's excuse me not completely rule out apprenticeships
S0517	yeah
S0558	he's be look at a they've they've obviously have a talk at school about
S0517	mm mm
S0558	the cost of university and make sure it's what you want and it's not the be all and end all they must have have something because he's like come home say i don't know whether to do a
S0517	an apprenticeship
S0558	you know an apprenticeship
S0517	i know
S0558	and i say but but what be you gonna do you don't know what you want to do
S0517	to do i know yeah
S0558	so what be you gonna do with i say you've gotta pretty much decide then within the next six months
S0517	six months
S0558	or whatever
S0517	mm mm
S0558	cos that's when you need to start apply what you potentially wanna do
S0517	it's so i know
S0558	for the rest of your life
S0517	it's so hard isn't it
S0558	it be
S0517	it's so hard yeah dunno don't know
S0558	maybe just go and just get a job don't worry about a career it's
S0517	yeah
S0558	so much harder for a boy do you think
S0517	yes
S0558	cos i dunno i think men
S0517	it be it be harder and also you know i mean several years down the road as find it's hard to change
S0558	yeah
S0517	well i mean he wasn't even try to change career he be try to change industry you know his actual job role operations
S0558	mm
S0517	be stay the same
S0558	yeah
S0517	but he find it very very hard to change industry so you do have to be careful what you choose don't you but
S0558	mm but then it's like say he say because i say the last thing you want be to be one year into an apprenticeship and think i really don't like this cos really you've gotta see your apprenticeship through
S0517	mm mm
S0558	he say yeah but that could happen to me one year in at university
S0517	of course it could yeah
S0558	and i say yeah you're right
S0517	yeah he could could at any time couldn't it
S0558	could at any time he be say last night how some people be have consider a gap year some
S0517	be consider a gap decade
S0517	last i hear
S0558	a whole decade
S0517	yeah last time so the gap year why why would you stop there why would i not just have a gap decade
S0558	and just go travel
S0517	er well you would
S0558	it's like a say to though look at 's he he didn't do particularly well at school he he be a bite you know mess around and all the rest of it he come out of there and i think continue to mess around maybe a couple of years after school then he decide to do engineer so he get an apprenticeship i think for an engineer course so he do three years' engineer and he do his fourth year which get him a higher qualification then he decide to travel so he start do some travel and he's actually end up in erm australia where he's pretty much gonna settle i think
S0517	oh really
S0558	he be work in a surf shop and do something else and do something else and now he's get some sort of sales job in engineer so he's thirty what would be he be eight when we move here oh god how long could we have be here
S0517	i don't know
S0558	nearly six years maybe
S0517	have you
S0558	so he's
S0517	so he's thirty four
S0558	yeah and he's only really just
S0517	just find
S0558	settle into a job
S0517	mm
S0558	so but he's would would step up to anything because he can right from the age of eight he's be able to walk into a room and whoever he's face with at whatever age he's be able to socialise
S0517	mm that's great help
S0558	so he can yeah
S0517	yeah
S0558	yeah he you know
S0517	yeah that's 's ideal job though run a surf shack in the caribbean
S0558	yeah yeah yeah
S0558	yeah i dunno what i wanna do

S0517	be move on
S0558	they've go
S0517	but anyway so that instal his own i think it be two hundred pound from screwfix
S0558	mm
S0517	and he spend all day and it you know it's a nice
S0558	yeah neat box and everything
S0517	proper panel and two box outside and bloom loud erm and he could you know you can set however long you want it to be
S0558	yeah
S0517	go off you can do everything but that's what it do it it can phone
S0558	that's clever
S0517	i think three people
S0558	that be very clever
S0517	because i say to him what be we go to do when we go on holiday and it ring you and we're you know
S0558	yeah
S0517	well be we gonna ask somebody else if we can have it set to them for
S0558	yes yeah
S0558	but yeah yeah
S0517	i say oh okay yeah that make sense
S0558	yeah yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	but er but no anyway i be i i don't think i'd leave them overnight for any length of time yet too incompetent
S0558	mm i i'd feel okay i'd probably think oh but would come in and cook dinner no problem
S0517	yeah you see
S0558	she'd she'd get on with it you know
S0517	mine wouldn't they'd just go to the chippy
S0558	mm well the yeah
S0517	with all their leftover their spare
S0558	well yeah because you get all the leftover yeah yeah
S0517	that i'm pay that he's not pay
S0558	no wonder he's happy to do it for five pound an hour he's make a
S0517	yeah he's make
S0558	well he's make how much
S0517	he's make a fiver well more now isn't he
S0558	more than a fiver a week
S0517	because when yeah because when he hasn't be er back with it's cos i've pick him up and either after detention or when he be
S0558	yeah and and when they pay erm when they pay a pound each that first day that either way a pound each
S0517	mm
S0558	either and he sort that app out he say so i you're in credit for monday
S0517	oh
S0558	so he didn't have anything off them on monday
S0517	bless him oh isn't he lovely
S0558	bless him
S0517	say to me the other you know he he's obviously start to pay attention because when i'm with every time he's he's at a junction he put his handbrake on or you know he come to a stop he say you've never do that mum i've never know anyone else do that i say no i say it's something you get out of the habit of i say but that be how you be teach that's how you'll be teach i be teach that he say so what will he just grow out of it i say yeah quite possibly cos most people do
S0558	yeah
S0517	i know very few people that put their handbrake on at the traffic light or whatever but
S0558	yeah
S0517	he's you know so he's obviously you know
S0517	clock it and pay attention
S0558	won't before he's
S0517	no he say he want
S0558	gonna start learn
S0517	mum do you think i'll have pass by christmas i say i don't know i say that's five months i say no reason why you wouldn't have
S0558	no he should be yeah if if he get his first letter lesson pretty much book in as soon as his birthday
S0517	yeah and then he's get you know
S0558	if i be you in fact
S0517	three weeks
S0558	if he's get a choose i'd i'd actually get him book in
S0517	get him book in
S0558	cos sometimes you know they say well i can't accommodate for a month or
S0517	oh okay oh that's a good idea
S0558	it might be worth
S0517	need to sort out his provisional licence
S0558	mm
S0517	arrange some lessons and he want to have his own car ready to practise cos he can't really he's not practise in mine
S0558	oh yeah
S0517	or 's
S0558	yeah yeah no yeah
S0517	so that's the the other thing
S0558	yeah
S0517	we probably ought to sort that out cos he you know he be always he's get the money and he be always gonna get one to get himself to the tennis club but if he just have it for when he's learn as well
S0558	you know what you need to do now you need to reduce the size of your back garden so you can get another car
S0517	i know it be on my list to have do
S0558	on the drive
S0517	by the time he be seventeen
S0558	mm
S0517	but it just hasn't because it's expensive
S0558	you'd only have to move the fence down slightly wouldn't you and put a gate in just move your gate round really
S0517	what we'd have to move the tree wouldn't we
S0558	yeah but they soon grow back don't they
S0517	and it's on a different it's on a
S0558	if you're if you're
S0517	a a level isn't it
S0558	stand on your drive and there's your garage
S0517	mm
S0558	then all you need to do really be push that back a little bite don't you
S0517	what the garage
S0558	no no no there's your garage
S0517	the the hedge
S0558	turn to the side yeah and push your hedge back a bite
S0517	yes i know yes you do yeah
S0558	and you don't need to be in fact even the full width of the car cos i bet you could move over slightly to the leave if you need to
S0517	yeah i know but it's still expensive to do that isn't it you'd have to have the drive redo wouldn't you you can't just like it's a different level into the side garden there's that
S0558	yeah
S0517	little step well and truly cement that fence in
S0558	mm
S0517	i don't think it's as it's not something could do
S0558	be there put it on the front
S0517	how do you mean
S0558	on the front under your window you haven't get a driveway there have you
S0517	we haven't get a driveway
S0558	no
S0517	what we should do be be sort the garage out and one of us should park in the garage
S0558	that's a good idea
S0517	because i park in the garage in the winter because i don't like
S0558	yeah
S0517	scrap ice
S0558	's away all week
S0517	's away in the week say oh i'll leave mine on the on the
S0558	on the
S0517	road
S0558	yeah
S0517	i mean to be honest we've get such cos we're cos of be on the corner
S0558	there's plenty of room
S0517	there's plenty of room and where people park literally outside our front door
S0558	yeah
S0517	doesn't affect any traffic because
S0558	no
S0517	it's so wide there and it's on this side
S0558	yeah
S0517	it doesn't affect any traffic whereas if you be park you know you know just before you get to our drive by the tree if you be park there
S0558	yeah
S0517	that i think that's a difficult one because people would have to come out to go round it and if somebody be come that way to turn into road
S0558	mm
S0517	that would be to park there would be a hazard whereas if you park up
S0558	like further up by the door
S0517	literally on the corner
S0558	mm
S0517	you're you're although you you're not suppose to park on corner be you but you're out the way
S0558	yeah it's wide enough isn't it
S0517	it's not affect anybody there
S0558	no no there's plenty of room
S0517	but ideally what we have say be we need to get organise so that one of us can go in the garage
S0558	mm
S0517	and two on the drive and have a rethink before get to that age
S0558	i know
S0517	and you're lucky you can fit four on
S0558	we can get six
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	easily if you'd like you know
S0517	yeah easily so you're
S0558	but we be gonna erm be widen it
S0517	yes you say that
S0558	anyway
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	and we do think about do it now
S0517	mm
S0558	temporary just get some gravel or something
S0517	yes
S0558	but we've look at the cost and it's not gonna be cheap
S0517	i know and that's what stop us from do ours
S0558	yeah
S0517	because there's always we have a new bathroom
S0558	yeah
S0517	you know it be a toss up
S0558	yeah
S0517	and the bathroom really really be horrible
S0558	mm you want to do the bathroom
S0517	and need do and it be a toss up to be honest but i mean why get the drive do have be on my list for many years and it be suppose to be do before turn seventeen but we've get there and it's not do so yeah
S0558	cos time just go so fast
S0517	mm i know i know
S0517	it be scary
S0558	but you forget don't you if do you ever when you're on the go do you walk past a mirror and go back and think be that me
S0517	oh yes cos you're look a bite old
S0558	yeah and you think
S0517	oh
S0558	be that me can't be

S0558	but i suppose he
S0517	from our accountants that do our external accountants once a month she come and just not quite sure what she do to be honest but he's now in charge of pay the bill and stuff it be a bite of a mess he's muddle along be that the time

S0558	mm when be you eat
S0517	when be i eat
S0558	later
S0517	later well have his match at five should be do and finish coach at six thirty so we'll probably eat at seven
S0558	so how how many hours' coach be do do his two hours on a saturday
S0517	two hours on a saturday he do an hour and a quarter on a friday and that's his regular
S0558	that's brilliant
S0517	and then he have he's be cover quite a bite lately so he's do some on tuesdays he do one on wednesday night you know there's those tennis court in the park
S0558	yes
S0517	the there's a new thing now where it's tennis for free on a sunday afternoon in the park two till four and something on a wednesday night so he's cover both of those and be pay for that so just
S0558	that's really good
S0517	yeah he's do quite a bite
S0558	yeah yeah it's keep him fit at the same time as well
S0517	it's keep keep him fit he's get middle age ladies pay him to
S0558	pay him to
S0517	to bounce the ball
S0558	to throw the
S0517	but then have say that er well i think we're gonna have to start charge him i mean he's break string again last week that's fifteen pound
S0558	mm that's the trouble isn't it
S0517	he's have new trainers because he his other ones be fall to piece cos he he do live in them
S0558	mm
S0517	but it's the string he keep break the string and
S0558	you need to get a machine so you can fix them yourself
S0517	well yeah
S0558	you remember i tell you when we be out camp
S0517	yes yeah i know yeah
S0558	there be this great big
S0517	i know
S0558	you need one of them
S0517	yeah a little side line
S0558	mm
S0517	it be people at the tennis club who do restringing
S0558	yeah
S0517	and charge
S0558	yeah
S0517	something else he could do
S0558	yeah
S0558	he need to get invest he's earn all this money it would be worth see what it could cost to invest in a machine
S0517	yeah apparently they're quite big though
S0558	mm it be quite big it be kind of on a table
S0517	i dunno where we'd put it mm
S0558	er no it's portable they be camp
S0517	oh oh okay yes yeah no
S0558	yeah they be camp so it's portable
S0517	worth think about
S0558	put it on a table in the garage or
S0517	we have one week
S0558	when he's get his own car he can put it in the back of his car and
S0517	yeah we have one week about and literally only about three weeks ago all three of them break string and in the same week
S0558	oh
S0517	they be all scrabble around
S0558	and be it fifteen pound per string or per
S0517	per racquet
S0558	whole per racquet
S0517	per racquet yeah
S0558	so if it's more than one string it's still only fifteen pound
S0517	oh yeah yeah cos cos the whole lot of string come out and the whole lot get restrung
S0558	oh really
S0517	they don't just replace the one that's break
S0558	oh so
S0517	no no the whole lot come and and you have to
S0558	oh
S0517	restring it completely mm i know one of the chap at the tennis club do do only charge ten pound which be nice he's 's friend and then but the other guy that do restringing who we hadn't use before just happen to be there when break his string so just give it to him but he be fifteen pound erm on all account he's do a very good job
S0558	mm
S0517	whatever that mean the coach tell him how to string it for
S0558	mm
S0517	whereas with the one that's cheaper he just
S0558	just do it
S0517	just do it give it back to you
S0558	oh
S0517	and in fairness he do say to us well he he be really nice and say oh if only i'd just charge a fiver for the kid cos now they're get to the age they're gonna be break them every two three weeks i think well that's no reason to only charge a fiver be it but and we say no no we'll pay you go rate and then i think every two to three weeks that's not last long be it
S0558	no no no no no
S0517	so and and it and 's now
S0558	how good a job
S0517	only just last three weeks
S0558	mm
S0517	so it'll be interest to see now this other guy's do it
S0558	yeah
S0517	our other option be to take it into the shop in and they're fifteen sixteen pound i think and they last a bite longer it's just at the stage now where he's
S0558	yeah
S0517	where he's hit the ball hard
S0558	mm
