S0250	do the hunger game ever actually explain why they
S0253	do the game
S0250	do the game
S0253	yeah
S0250	oh
S0253	have you see or read the first one
S0250	i've see the first one
S0253	so at the begin it's like it's the idea that there be a great uprise
S0250	yeah
S0253	erm which be then stomp upon by the man
S0250	yeah
S0253	and they do the for like the idea be that like the people in the district the poor people in the district like you know they sort of convince them that the uprise be wrong and you know and and everyone agree that they be wrong
S0250	yeah
S0253	and the and the hunger game be a celebration of them quash the rebellious elements of society when in fact it be society itself be you know
S0250	it's a bite stupid
S0253	yeah so they all live out in the
S0250	and it's and this er er go back go back to battle royale and like at least then with that one it be just kind of like
S0253	sort of like some euthanizing like
S0250	yeah they have like a thing with the you know the the population be too so in a in a way to do this with er like they put school children onto the
S0253	yeah
S0250	and the game be call battle royale
S0253	yeah yeah battle royale be a great idea
S0250	apparently er when the suzanne be it suzanne collins or something like that
S0253	yeah
S0250	who write this the very when she write it she be like i never hear of it and then you know once it have pretty much get to print someone be like aye or it be like someone in the er like the publishers be just like this be exactly the same as battle royale
S0253	yeah
S0250	like
S0253	dystopian
S0250	yeah
S0253	nightmare
S0250	like like this be the exact same idea and like erm like she's like oh i didn't know and
S0253	well
S0250	and like and so they just tell her to go through carry on with it
S0253	and it's be a big hit hasn't it
S0250	but i don't know just like i suppose like she'd do her own thing for it it's just
S0253	well it's it's write for a different audience
S0250	yeah
S0253	western western writers have be steal japanese culture for years anyway
S0250	yeah
S0253	and pass it off as other things like horror and you know
S0250	yeah it just seem that like with no reference to it though
S0253	yeah no like thank
S0250	yeah like at least when like like a hollywood
S0253	inspire
S0250	hollywood go like
S0253	inspire by the events of battle royale
S0250	yeah
S0250	yeah exactly
S0253	but it's it's a it's a it's an old concept though isn't it like the idea of people unwillingly pit against each other like erm what's that other film what's the arnie film about that kind of a the run man it's a very similar concept
S0250	i haven't see it but i wanna be that arnold schwarzenegger
S0253	that's convict though and the idea it's i think the the prisons be overcrowd so they do this game and it's like whoever win their freedom
S0250	yeah
S0253	and it's kind of the the last man stand
S0250	have you ever see rollerball with sam kane
S0253	again a similar a similar concept
S0250	what a game that be
S0250	can't believe that isn't
S0253	it's gonna be in the next olympics
S0250	i hope so
S0253	i use to have a game on the pc call hyberblade and it be base on rollerball
S0250	oh really
S0253	and it be like it be great cos it be like obstacles in the in the middle of the the arena and the the arena be the like the shape of an american football so you'd go up the wall you'll go round the wall and stuff so you have this kind of magnetic puck that you could fire at the goal it be a great game
S0250	yeah
S0253	and then but then your stick be like a sword that if you just get close enough to anyone
S0250	kill
S0253	you could maim
S0250	mm
S0253	but it be a very good game

S0250	right
S0253	like do you do you know what i'm talk about
S0250	yeah
S0253	well they do you remember like old vhs cover that be like science fiction film you'd never see and they just look crazy like they're just i can't describe them cos they're just the
S0250	yeah
S0253	the most fantastical imagery you've ever see weird kind of screen print cover from book so it's about that kind of world of like really like super super super science fiction you know where it's like it's so fantastical that it's ridiculous i mean that be and it's about this kid and he write great science fiction and jemaine his character be like he's like the daddy of like science fiction at the time but he hasn't write a good book in years and he steal this idea but it this weird indie flick but at the same like so as the film's play out the narrative's play out they're make a movie of the book like he steal the idea so they
S0250	mm
S0253	make a movie of the book to show like how it be mean to be or something like that and it's low budget science fiction cross with like this you know proper like it low as like view from a the way it's shoot it's brilliant you'd absolutely love it
S0250	yeah
S0253	and it's like really funny in place
S0250	great okay
S0253	odd as hell but really funny i i'd never hear of it and like it's a bite like i guess like it's like in the same vein as like but which it also have
S0250	mm
S0253	it's the same chap but you'd really like it gentlemen broncos be the film

S0253	it just see him just see that once they kind of get get over the finish line they start lose game all of a sudden
