S0015	yeah the landlord
S0281	yeah she she's in the wrong there you know because she she's have agree to do what she say she would do but apparently the bottom line be that she's get the right and he hasn't so yeah
S0015	and the heating's not be work but be that a boiler or what what be that a boiler or
S0281	i don't know he didn't say exactly what it be but there's a there's a problem with the heat and erm he say they they couldn't er they couldn't make her do anything so she she
S0015	to sort it out

S0015	but it's you know these there be some things that you can
S0281	well yeah i i suppose you know you've get to two things i learn today and one be patience and the other be perseverance
S0015	oh
S0281	oh
S0015	mm well i think that's the way of the world unfortunately because what you're deal with be they're deal with be people who aren't work and have get time so therefore you know that's how they be they're because you can wait for me kind of approach
S0281	yeah
S0015	do you have to wait there then when you go today
S0281	no
S0281	that be well it's in the job centre there which be
S0015	yeah
S0281	you know right next to the law court
S0015	yeah
S0281	and the first two guy be there be two obviously bouncers
S0015	yeah security

S0015	oh cool
S0281	and then you see somebody somebody will come up to you and say oh can i help you
S0015	mm
S0281	which be quite nice erm
S0015	eventually
S0281	and then you know he tell me you know you've just get to phone you you can't see anybody the only person you could see there be somebody who actually pop in and he say he just pop into the office because essentially his job be go around to see pensioners who can't get out
S0015	oh right yeah
S0281	so he say it's all get to be do over the phone
S0015	mm and they'll probably send you form and then you'll fill those form in
S0281	yeah maybe
S0015	mm
S0281	maybe anyway i'll find out later
S0015	so you've get you've get to ring there
S0281	yeah
S0015	what time be that so right now it's probably
S0281	well it's twelve o'clock now so

S0281	maybe it's less chance of get
S0015	yeah or yeah
S0281	what be the chance of them reply in the lunchtime so

S0281	maybe if i can prove she exist
S0015	well that's why i say birth certificate

S0015	mm well you you need to have a copy of her birth certificate and they will translate it over here
S0281	ah
S0015	if need be and that that's why i say to you you need it as proof and you could be i mean i don't know how much erm family allowance be but it's quite a lot about ten pound or more it might be even
S0281	be it
S0015	i don't know it might be even eighteen pound a week which be a lot if you've get to pay school fee
S0281	mm
S0015	and
S0281	well we'll i'll see tomorrow what they say and if i need it or not or if if but these pension credit er it seem like that's

S0015	the pension credit chart for people age you're not single actually
S0281	no well the different
S0015	yeah
S0281	well
S0015	people age sixty five and over
S0281	yeah but i'm not a couple either be i
S0015	no so you god get the credit your income be rock bottom isn't it then
S0281	well my income will be just what i'm be pay
S0015	on the pension
S0281	on the pension at the moment so
S0015	yeah
S0281	i'm pretty
S0015	and it start at a hundred
S0281	yeah a hundred yeah
S0015	and a hundred pound
S0281	yeah
S0015	but you're below the scale
S0281	mm i'm i'm pretty sure that
S0015	you will get
S0281	i'll get something
S0015	well yeah mm it's that
S0281	and they ask me if i'm pay any rent and i say no i'm just er stay with my sister at the moment
S0015	but you or what you have you ask them will you get house benefit if you want to take a flat you know
S0281	yes yeah and and
S0281	's be push me to he say well get your get your name down on the house list
S0015	well
S0281	i say what
S0015	forget that forget that they
S0281	i saw a thing on the tv recently er that say in in there's a be it sixteen thousand people on the house list or something like that
S0015	yeah well they're mainly people with children and
S0281	yeah
S0015	you know and and they have to be overcrowd if you can put your name down on the house list here we're not overcrowd
S0281	mm
S0015	so that's you know that's what they would say well you've get room you know
S0281	mm
S0015	where you're live you've get a bedroom to yourself if you put it down as then
S0281	well he's he say he he
S0015	he would
S0281	he could yeah he would do that but that would mean erm that it would show up that he's he's get an unearned income or something like that you know er and that and that that would
S0015	well only only
S0281	that would actually affect and also it would affect his rat because
S0015	yeah
S0281	that would be more than one person live in the house
S0015	yeah
S0281	and he say you can do that but you'll have to pay the difference in rat
S0015	yeah yeah which isn't a huge amount though
S0281	well i'll have to find out when i see him
S0015	erm it's erm it's what they call erm community tax tomato sauce
S0281	please yeah since you tell me the benefit of
S0015	tomato sauce absolutely i mean i don't eat it myself i can't stand it but everyone tell me it's do you want a cup of tea
S0281	lovely
S0015	camomile
S0281	er peppermint please
S0015	peppermint okay yeah so this be the thing so if you put it down here we're not overcrowd we've get room if you put it down at 's then it'll show that you're you know haven't get a bedroom of your own and you be overcrowd but if you it might you don't have to say you're pay him any rent
S0281	mm
S0015	so it won't affect his income
S0281	no but it will affect his rat
S0015	yeah it would affect his er his erm community tax the only thing be of course he's get his nephew stay there and he might not want that to be
S0281	well technically his his his property be four to six actually
S0015	mm right oh right
S0281	and where his nephew's stay there's a door that lead into the
S0015	other room
S0281	the other room where his bedroom be
S0015	right
S0281	he's get a bedroom and that be technically number four
S0015	right
S0281	and be number six
S0015	right okay what need to do be get the other ones up and run
S0281	mm well
S0015	and you pay rent and get house benefit that would be the thing that would be the ideal
S0281	he show me his new new year's resolutions for two thousand and thirteen
S0015	oh major new year's resolutions
S0281	yeah for two thousand and thirteen
S0015	oh for two thousand and thirteen
S0281	and that erm one of them be to erm do his property up at least
S0015	yeah
S0281	one day a week
S0015	oh that's good
S0281	and that i think it's go to be on his list of things to do
S0281	and i tell him yeah i tell him i'll be you know more than happy to help out
S0015	yeah give you something to occupy yourself
S0281	mm
S0015	and actually probably be very good for you because use physical energy make you tire and sleep well

S0015	right
S0281	so i wasn't sure how that would affect me but i keep you know think and things go around in your head you know
S0015	mm
S0281	about the past and the future and
S0015	so you've get to leave the past behind
S0281	and i
S0015	really and think of the future

S0281	but essentially you know for my particular problem there be no solution really er
S0015	well there be solutions
S0281	well yeah
S0015	they're not they're not in you know not maybe ideal solutions but there be solutions and
S0281	mm

S0281	and i'll take er 's er form i've get to say that er
S0015	what
S0281	she's register with the british government
S0015	with the yeah yeah so you've get all that that's you know erm then i suppose you you need to write a list of things you want to talk to them about
S0281	it's funny you should say that say exactly the same thing and i say i know what i've get to talk about
S0015	yeah but it's so easy to forget when you're talk about like some one thing you go off on one direction
S0281	yeah
S0015	if you've get them on a list you can say oh yeah
S0281	yeah you're probably right
S0015	i just want to ask about this so it's worth do
S0281	mm
S0015	erm well one of them of course that you haven't think about perhaps isn't er er wasn't on your mind be child benefit
S0281	yes
S0015	say i've get to contribute to her
S0281	well i have actually
S0015	yeah yeah of course i know you have
S0281	you know i i agree to pay the school fee
S0015	mm
S0281	so
S0015	which be more than you actually get come in at the moment
S0281	maybe yeah
S0015	don't don't tell them that you're she's in a private school or anything
S0281	well
S0015	she's
S0015	just say you have to pay for school over there
S0281	yeah
S0015	school it's not free erm so and which of the about the property or anything because that would complicate things but
S0281	well it wouldn't make any difference it's not er there's only one of them be in my joint name
S0015	mm
S0281	but
S0015	mm but they'll be look at that
S0281	yeah but i i
S0015	as income income from that
S0281	well fair enough yeah
S0015	what you could say be that she's live in it
S0281	yeah
S0015	have have it have it get a mortgage or anything like that do they have mortgage like we do
S0281	we do actually well after we buy the first one we get a a a loan
S0015	mm
S0281	i suppose you could call it a mortgage but er for because we didn't have quite enough to buy it and it's it's weird you can the erm the chinese they they've get a can do attitude to everything you know
S0015	mm mm
S0281	and there's no way they're gonna give me a loan
S0015	no
S0281	but and again you know didn't have a job but so they create a job for her they make her manageress of mcdonald's
S0015	really
S0281	yeah
S0015	how weird
