S0607	of be a
S0644	lawyer
S0607	the clerk of a justice person yeah and in order to erm in order to erm
S0644	oh
S0607	i dunno if it'll work
S0644	okay
S0607	erm to to take up write
S0644	yeah
S0607	but i think i like it because she have this thing erm and i do start do you know and i when i get back from here i'm gonna try and enjoy not have anything to do for like a month because
S0644	yeah
S0607	before we come here i be quite fixate on research for here and it be
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	impend a bite more and more and more and there be like a deadline
S0644	yeah
S0607	and there will be a deadline again cos i've get house sit from the third of april but that's a month of not have to do anything so one of the things i would like to do be to have this project again so i start it and all i remember be that she suggest that you make a list of the things that you like
S0644	yeah
S0607	make a list of the things that you don't like
S0644	yeah
S0607	but it's not i think it's phrase a bite better than that things that make you feel good things that make you feel bad and then things that make you feel in an atmosphere of growth erm cos she be like you can't just have all the things you like erm you have to have an atmosphere
S0644	yeah
S0607	of growth or you don't you're not satisfy then
S0644	yeah yeah exactly
S0607	and i remember how wonderful it be so i wake up one sunday at like five be
S0644	mm
S0607	and i get up
S0644	mm
S0607	and go on the patio and start make a list of what i like
S0644	mm
S0607	and it be so much fun and then i remember wake up at seven and we go to the outdoor pool
S0644	mm
S0607	and it be such a great day erm but then the idea be right so you've get to try and include more of the things that you like
S0644	mm
S0607	get rid of some of the things you don't like as far as you can
S0644	mm
S0607	and what be you gonna do for your atmosphere of growth i bet there's more to it i'm just that's how i remember it so i start do it and the thing be like i have a list of about eight hundred things that i like
S0644	mm
S0607	so i couldn't you can't start do them all so she have
S0644	like what out of interest
S0607	erm there be such a wide such shame i don't have the list
S0644	do you mean on a mundane level or up to bigger things like from read
S0607	all level yeah like
S0644	read swim
S0607	wake up early
S0644	mm
S0607	swim
S0644	uhu
S0607	erm coffee
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm like it's a shame i don't have the list with me but it all like come to me that morning and i be just oh like fresh air
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm
S0644	simple things
S0607	not be oh and then on the like what i don't like side be late
S0644	uhu
S0607	cos it just make me feel like shit erm and other stuff like that so so then it be like she i then i just wish that she be there because she have this fabulous plan of twelve months and each month she be tackle particular bits
S0644	mm
S0607	and i just fell short there because i be work and i just didn't really have time
S0644	mm
S0607	and and you've get to be careful not to let it become a chore
S0644	mm
S0607	so because you're like hold yourself accountable that's how you're gonna get it do
S0644	mm
S0607	it's a danger that you end up go oh i've get to like
S0607	be on time and i've get to
S0644	yeah
S0607	so and then tick it off
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	so i realise i'd do it wrong at first cos i'd end up with a more job
S0644	right
S0607	erm but i eventually get it right but by the way this be quite short live so
S0644	mm
S0607	i choose which ones to do that month so i choose something like write erm cook and i dunno something else and then three things to get rid of
S0644	yes
S0607	and then i sort of like forget about it for a bite but i i remember one day go oh crap i didn't do the thing and i look back and i have be do those things
S0644	oh
S0607	so it have
S0644	so it have it anyway
S0607	yeah it have infiltrate what
S0644	right
S0607	i be do
S0644	right right right
S0607	and i would like to do that again i know it's really like simple but it be so good cos i think do you know what
S0644	effective
S0607	i love go to a café and read my book i'm gonna do that on saturday
S0644	mm
S0607	rather than just go oh i never manage to get round to have the read in the café thing
S0644	like make it an a purposeful thing
S0607	yeah erm and then the thing with the atmosphere of growth be probably my write
S0644	right
S0607	so what do you think
S0644	excellent
S0644	because erm what the theory of everything or the many book that i've read on the theory of everything as you know shall we come up here erm dunno where i think that be a part of the whole thing
S0607	yeah
S0644	but erm what do you think i mean
S0607	do
S0644	i don't mind carry on if you're happy
S0607	do you feel like we're gonna get to that side or not
S0644	i dunno
S0607	or do you think we have to get back in the car to go back to where you saw it before
S0644	maybe stick our head round here
S0607	and see
S0644	see
S0607	and then yeah
S0644	if there's no sign then we'll have to maybe go back
S0607	go back and then see it again
S0644	right so
S0607	whoop
S0644	no what i be gonna say to you
S0607	we're accidently just walk along a road
S0644	it be lovely though innit
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's completely lovely erm right so what i be gonna say to you it sound like a similar thing the theory of everything er one of the many erm tool you can use say every day at the end of your day write down at least three things
S0607	oh
S0607	maybe this be what this be for
S0644	it's it's that look like load of fun though doesn't it
S0607	yeah oh pollute though
S0644	oh erm yeah write down at the end of the day three things or four things that be really good
S0607	oh yeah
S0644	and then what happen be be you look back at your day and you think yeah that be a good day and that be really like this be nice and it make you feel better then when you go to sleep
S0607	and you maybe do find things where you think
S0644	yeah
S0607	that everything
S0644	well it
S0607	have go to shit but when you think about it there be a couple of things
S0644	and the idea be this it's one of the methods you can use to cultivate a attitude that's a happier one
S0607	yeah
S0644	you know because that's what i'm say erm that's what i'm say as in you make your life what it be
S0607	yeah
S0644	so if you make yourself and this be so true and i i don't mean to constantly bring up certain people but i have a friend who be very negative
S0644	and everything be wrong
S0644	yeah i i don't wanna say it on record
S0607	i still like though
S0644	yeah i do she's she's fantastic but you know when you look at someone and you can see how this have come to be like it be
S0607	yeah
S0644	like you can totally see how it's
S0607	but i be get like that definitely i be so negative
S0644	well you you be not negative
S0644	cos this this be the problem with as well be that it's quite funny and then you end up laugh at it
S0607	yeah
S0644	and then that become their personality personality cos they think oh
S0607	it's funny
S0644	it's funny when i'm like this so i'll do it more and everyone'll
S0607	yeah
S0644	think i'm funny and it become your trait
S0607	yeah
S0644	the same thing be with you like you know how you would have buy all warm clothe and it would be scorchio
S0607	yeah
S0644	in february
S0607	yeah
S0644	and you would have
S0644	what be the other thing just now
S0607	get a a a fly up my arse
S0644	yeah while you be have a wee and all these things
S0644	like yeah that would happen to
S0644	do you see what i mean it's it's like that
S0607	oh
S0644	and then it but that become self perpetuate then so then you think oh yeah of course that would happen to me whereas
S0607	yeah
S0644	there be people and i use to be a lot more like it i'm work on it where you actually expect everything to just work out exactly how you want
S0607	yeah
S0644	and it do cos you expect it but
S0607	so i haven't get a fly in my pant
S0644	you probably have this be what i'm say
S0607	sure that i should have like mention that erm
S0644	it's anonymous innit
S0607	cos either er
S0644	probably anonymous
S0607	there be one or and that's just typical me or i just think there be one so i should think there isn't
S0644	yeah
S0607	and then it'll stop itch
S0644	yeah because the worry
S0607	there isn't one there isn't one there isn't one
S0644	the worry
S0607	cos at the moment it's probably lay its egg and
S0644	yeah up your arsehole
S0644	yeah
S0607	do you think that's actually possible that's the kind of thing that go through my head
S0644	yeah it totally be
S0607	do you think it's possible to like cut bits
S0644	that bite out
S0607	be it possible
S0644	i don't know
S0607	no
S0644	what what bite
S0607	the you know
S0644	yeah it be because erm
S0607	no don't give me any evidence
S0644	okay
S0607	we'll be awake all night or go to hospital
S0607	sorry could you just check
S0644	yeah but do you see how it work
S0607	yeah
S0644	do you see what i mean
S0607	oh it's so annoy it's all down to me
S0644	that's what say like
S0644	that's what she laugh at
S0644	she go and on top of all this it's my fault
S0607	do you know what though it's funny when i'm with you but when i'm on my own it's actually not funny
S0644	be it not don't you laugh yourself
S0607	it's like it get you really down
S0644	what what do
S0607	all the like
S0644	the worry
S0607	yeah thank god it's
S0644	erm
S0607	get to like the end of the afternoon because now it's manageable the heat
S0644	i just can't believe how much like cornwall it be and i love cornwall
S0607	and then all we've get to do be erm
S0644	oh
S0607	come all the way back
S0644	exactly
S0607	and then go to a diner
S0644	you know you be talk yesterday about your lovely summer with in italy
S0607	yeah
S0644	and all that i can remember and you know how you say you use that to think of sometimes when you're a bite feed up and it cheer you up and everything
S0607	yeah
S0644	well i be think what have i do and i think one of the best summer
S0607	well yeah because i ask you yeah
S0644	one of the best summer be me and go to go that my nan's place in and we plan to go
S0607	oh
S0644	like for the whole summer and we do pretty much
S0607	really
S0644	pretty much for the whole summer
S0607	oh wow
S0644	and she i'd finish uni for the year i think i'd have i totally finish it or it be last second year i dunno so i have the whole summer off
S0607	first uni
S0644	er no that be not a good year by the time i'd establish that i be gonna be able to stay at uni the second one
S0607	yeah
S0644	like i get over the panic a bite erm and yeah we just have a lovely summer so and we come down and stay at my nan's so we have somewhere to stay and then my nan come down and stay sometimes and my sister come sometimes
S0607	isn't it amaze
S0644	and 's we have 's hen party so they all come down
S0607	how lucky be that don't that's
S0644	of course
S0607	do you feel really lucky
S0644	i do i do i do
S0607	oh
S0644	and it be really excite
S0607	yeah
S0644	it be really really excite and the thing be though this be what i'm say it should all be like that
S0607	yeah
S0644	and if it's not it's cos we've do something or allow things to not be like that
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's our fault well that's good cos that mean we can do something about it
S0607	cos on the one hand i kind of think it can't all be a holiday but i but on the other hand i think that's not what be mean it mean that so for example when i be in frankfurt i be like i don't want to live here and as much as possible go to cornwall
S0644	yeah
S0607	i want to live in cornwall
S0607	and i know that not everybody can live where they go on holiday but that's what my mum and dad do and i suddenly realise this one day
S0644	what live
S0607	cos
S0644	where they go on holiday
S0607	cos by the way i be think if i just buy a place somewhere
S0644	mm
S0607	in england i could go there load and i just quickly before i'd even think it through i be like it's too much i can't keep go over there so and i've get to build a life where you be
S0644	uhu
S0607	but basically what happen to my mum and dad be erm they erm i wonder how far this be no i think it's okay erm so they be live up north and they go on holiday to france
S0644	uhu
S0607	and because they be up north when they use to go on the ferry they have to stop so they one night before the ferry
S0644	mm
S0607	whereas nowadays it's just straight on the ferry from where we live but
S0644	mm
S0607	so they stop in and like probably one on the way there and one on the way back
S0644	mm
S0607	and they love it so much
S0644	in
S0607	in and and then
S0644	where's and
S0607	well be where i live
S0644	oh so it's where you be
S0607	be nearby
S0644	oh i think be a place
S0607	no no
S0644	like okay
S0607	erm be kind of like between and in where i be for that week in january
S0644	right
S0607	and erm
S0644	they love it
S0607	so they decide
S0644	what base on one or two
S0607	to move there
S0644	trip
S0607	yeah they be like we just love it here
S0644	yeah
S0607	why don't we move here
S0644	yeah
S0607	so literally and this be a massive undertake it wasn't just like oh we're hippies let's just move it be like dad be
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm a lawyer a new lawyer and he have to find a job in so what they do in the end be he find a job in and they find a place where they could afford so they they live in
S0644	in
S0607	do you know what my mum always say this she's say it several time so she'll go where's from and then i'll say i think she's from but i can't remember and this be the other place begin with c which i know now be
S0644	yes
S0607	and then my mum always say do you know we really want to live in area but it be too expensive
S0644	really
S0607	so we have to go down the other side of
S0644	be that
S0607	so imagine if they could have afford it i could have grow up near you
S0644	oh imagine
S0607	but we only be there when i be bear until i be two so hang on so we go to so we live in dad commute to everything be wonderful
S0644	where be
S0607	yeah it's kind of like nearer to than
S0644	nearer to than
S0607	and erm so
S0644	so you be bear though where
S0607	i be bear there in
S0644	oh so you're really not a northerner at all
S0607	no but
S0607	but then what happen be when i be two they make a boob they move back up north
S0644	right
S0607	so my mum say i'm too far away from my mum i want to go back
S0644	mm
S0607	and i think something else happen like they be visit and they start to get these thoughts that they should go back so they go back up north
S0644	mm
S0607	and they both say big mistake know straightaway
S0644	know straightaway
S0607	move back up to be miserable as s h i t and erm and then so when i between the age of two and six i live in
S0644	right
S0607	so actually do start off with a northern accent
S0644	oh
S0607	which i quickly grow out of cos when i come back down i just learn
S0644	yeah
S0607	not on purpose but just
S0644	yeah
S0607	yeah
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm
S0644	so be in
S0607	yeah
S0644	i didn't know that
S0607	and they and then they be like we should never have come back here cos our our hearts down there
S0644	why didn't they like it out of interest
S0607	i think
S0644	what be wrong
S0607	really they i think they just they just love it down south and
S0644	right
S0607	they i mean i'd have to i'd have to i i can't i can't really say
S0644	what be wrong
S0607	erm
S0644	yeah
S0607	cos i don't wanna say it's much better down south
S0607	cos it there be lot of wonderful things about
S0644	yeah
S0607	up north but i do think that possibly a part of it be that up north be a bite more downtrodden and down south
S0644	yes
S0607	be a bite more wow we be actually like on holiday
S0644	right
S0607	i don't' know how to explain it properly i mean for example my auntie and uncle they live in a wonderful part of yorkshire and it's really beautiful
S0644	yeah
S0607	but it be a little bite bleak it can be quite bleak even though i've in in even though i think it's great so but it's sort of can't i guess you can't really compare oh i dunno i be gonna say
S0644	okay
S0607	something terrible then
S0644	no no no
S0607	i be gonna say compare with or
S0644	or
S0607	no that's a totally wrong comparison but yeah so erm and then they so then they go back again
S0644	right
S0607	and that's when they move to no which be near and then we stay ever since so erm so anyway there's that be
S0644	have you always live in that house in
S0607	er yeah first we be in and then we move to and we've always be in that one since i be eleven but the moral of the story be they move to where they want to be on holiday
S0644	yes
S0607	and it be difficult like my dad have to then find another job down south and it be really difficult and he have to move down first and we didn't
S0644	mm
S0607	come down till later and then he have to find a house and
S0644	mm
S0607	it be extremely difficult to find a house
S0644	uhu
S0607	er because they be sell a house up north and buy a house down south so the difference
S0644	mm
S0607	in price be massive so
S0644	and also that be hard enough now with the internet
S0607	yeah
S0644	like imagine do it then when you have to go and like
S0607	yeah
S0644	and make appointments and that's how you saw a house
S0607	he actually have to do it in person
S0644	wow
S0607	but the other thing be we have to have like a skanky house because it be all that could be afford
S0644	yeah
S0607	base on the other house sort of thing and my mum still go on about that shithole house
S0607	she's always like oh i hat that house
S0607	erm but you know it get it get us there so i really shouldn't have say all of that cos it be just to say
S0644	no you should
S0607	that you know they follow their dream and
S0644	yes
S0607	it make me think when i be think about live where i wanna live instead of
S0644	yeah
S0607	just try to get there when i'm off work
S0644	but do you know where you wanna live now it's like
S0607	well
S0644	you're still decide though innit
S0607	in definitely england
S0644	definitely england
S0607	i know that i say everywhere we go that i wanna live there but
S0644	i know you don't though not really
S0607	it's just because i i i feel like i've get this travel instinct but
S0644	yeah what you mean be you'd like to have the option in to visit anywhere you like
S0607	but do you know what else i think it be as well
S0644	where be we go there
S0607	still not there be we be it there erm the other thing be that i don't think it's as simple as as germany england
S0644	mm
S0607	i think it's also the sea
S0644	mm
S0607	like sometimes you can't totally work out what the elements be but for example
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm i could get a really cheap place to live in like lincolnshire or cumbria
S0644	yeah
S0607	and it's beautiful like where live be one of the cheapest place to buy a house but it's inland
S0644	right
S0607	so and to me i really wanna be by the sea so there be like different different like i don't wanna be in a city work myself to death
S0644	yeah
S0607	stress out have to go to a five star hotel at the weekend just to stay alive
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm it doesn't even touch the side because i'm back in on monday
S0644	yeah
S0607	er and then and then whenever i can go to the sea
S0644	yeah
S0607	and live three hundred miles from it no i want to be live near the sea
S0644	yes
S0607	but i know that a lot of people might think that that's erm babyish and you can't do that like you have to
S0644	bollocks
S0607	have the job in the city and that's why i'm
S0644	no
S0607	go to try and do it this year differently
S0644	let me tell you this really really good story that i read somewhere so there's this harvard graduate businessman who'd be work his bum off work his bum off work his bum off go to go
S0644	to this little spanish or mexican i can't remember erm village by the sea and it's like this just peaceful
S0607	oh
S0644	chill out nothing happen quiet as anything and he meet this fisherman there who would go out every morning and catch like a few fish
S0607	yeah
S0644	so he'd catch a few and he'd swap some with his friends sometimes like for other things
S0607	yeah
S0644	and one night he buy he try some of this fish off the fisherman he buy it or have it cook at his restaurant where he be stay or whatever he say oh that be amaze that fish he say it's the best fish i've ever have he say why don't you why don't you get more fish like go out more get more fish then you could sell more of them
S0607	this be the harvard guy say this
S0644	yeah
S0607	yeah
S0644	the businessman why don't you get like and then when he say to him so what do you do every day he say i go out and get my fish he say i get a couple of myself for dinner with the family and then i sell a couple to my friends and we swap it for like other things that we need basically
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	and he say and then what do you do he say well then i he say spend the afternoon with my family and then he say and then what do you do he say well in the afternoon i in the even i go out with my friends and we go to a little house and we have a singsong

S0607	nobody's stress to death
S0644	no
S0607	have to watch box set because they're so stress
S0644	that's it so
S0607	oh
S0607	isn't it great i love the promise of it
S0644	yeah
S0607	yeah so
S0644	so erm he say so that's what you do he say yeah that's what i do he say well why don't you get some more fish right and then you can sell these fish then you could buy a bigger boat right
S0607	yeah
