S0679	yes yes
S0680	rather than say they're in next week get one in there
S0679	yeah the lady in the shop be actually very helpful wasn't she
S0680	oh yes yeah yes they usually be cos i wasn't i wasn't sure she'd know what i be talk about but she think what because if they're of an age group where they may have make a calendar at school and stick a thing on it they'll know what you mean
S0679	mm
S0680	but a lot of more recent children may not have do that
S0679	no
S0680	as a craft activity
S0679	i mean it still seem to be you can buy them in bulk
S0680	you can buy them yes but you know
S0679	yeah
S0680	how many school actually have people who do
S0679	mm
S0680	or like where we make the paper we do the do you do that do you do it with do you do erm where he get you get like a big well it's like have a big meet and you get some sort of tray and it's get water in it and they couldn't have be ordinary ink they must have be sort of like an oil on water
S0679	yes yes
S0680	ink and the the paper go on
S0679	mm
S0680	put it sort of swirl it about and you put the paper on and i don't think you run the paper through it because it would be smeary put the paper on
S0679	mm
S0680	it's probably just decent cartridge paper as we use to have in those days and it's get the it have all this sort of dotty swirly pattern on in the do you do that and then we use that to cover a board you know mitre and cover
S0679	oh yes i know about mitring and cover
S0680	and put the ribbon on and put the little thing for the and the calendar and i think we put a and you could put your own picture on
S0679	yes
S0680	and the background be this sort of you know you could
S0679	yeah
S0680	i think you know there be like a pinkie one and a bluey one a green one and you could and er i didn't do that you know i i make the calendar with the paper but i didn't do the oil on water business but i saw it in i use to have this i guess i get it for a christmas present
S0679	yeah
S0680	one of these book of you know
S0680	oh erm
S0679	choccy in the trousers
S0680	erm chocolate trouser uh book of like things to do and it always look really excite but i didn't think it be ever gonna happen

S0679	oh right
S0680	it be quite impressive
S0679	yeah
S0680	and you could do it on paper you could do it on anything and i can't think quite how it all work now but it be obviously some sort of you make pattern out of ink because you could even do it on fabric you know it be it be safe
S0679	yeah but it
S0680	and dry as soon as it come out
S0680	yeah well it's something where you do it kind it's like on water or unless you do it on oil unless it's oil unless it's a tray of oil with ink on ink on it it's something where where the the erm colour stuff be on the surface of the
S0679	yeah yeah i understand the principle
S0680	but i don't know whether it's oil with water water ink or water with oil ink
S0679	mm mm
S0680	you know which way around it be cos be good on the old
S0679	yes

S0680	i know but they'd i mean they be sort of things you have to have for school but
S0679	mm
S0680	because they look like erm what use to be sort of those american plimsoll things that come up to your

S0679	mm i think they're call baseball shoe
S0680	baseball boot
S0679	no i don't know
S0680	they're like they use to be like erm
S0679	yes i know i have some
S0680	yes and they but they have a knobbly underfoot
S0679	mm
S0680	but it use to take me hours to get them on
S0679	yes then there be hockey
S0680	and then you have to run to the top of the field and back so by the time i'd do that
S0679	yes
S0680	everybody have be put in a team
S0679	and it always seem to be cold and horrible when we play hockey
S0680	yes
S0679	but some people it seem enjoy the sport
S0680	some people
S0679	anyway i be tell you about
S0680	yes 's daughter
S0679	daughter
S0680	who marry a german man
S0679	erm i write a letter to her after i find that have die
S0680	oh right yes
S0679	and i must have give her my email perhaps
S0680	yes
S0679	well i guess i must have
S0680	mm
S0679	and she email back say how nice to have the letter
S0680	yes
S0679	and she be er please to hear i have a good er we both have a good experience with
S0680	yes yeah
S0679	because erm she be put in 's class her father's class which be unusual
S0680	mm no
S0679	because normally at they don't
S0680	no
S0679	and she say she have the most horrid time be teach by him
S0680	yeah
S0679	she really hat it and it be really
S0680	yes
S0679	colour her view of be at
S0680	yes but she be a bite older than me
S0679	be she oh she must've be
S0680	she pass on the hockey boot so she would've leave she would've already have leave wherever whatever school she be at presumably unless her feet grow rapidly erm to have pass on her hockey boot
S0679	mm yeah i don't i don't i don't think i've ever meet her
S0680	so she could be like five years older than me
S0679	mm
S0680	she wasn't i don't know what school she go to maybe
S0679	probably i would guess
S0680	yeah
S0679	yeah
S0680	well it's a bite much isn't it cos you've er erm if you've get your father all day and at home as well
S0679	for two whole years
S0680	because be she be an only child as well wasn't she
S0679	mm mm
S0680	so she it be just her yeah
S0679	but i be i mean it it have happen because
S0680	well it's just the way it work out cos she'd be in the as
S0679	i think they try to manage it so we didn't get in our parent's class or it may have just be
S0680	well er you can't help it if if in like in those days it be either or father
S0679	or
S0680	or
S0679	or
S0680	dunno whether didn't do top set usually
S0679	mm
S0680	he do well he he didn't do four a
S0679	mm
S0680	three a four a he might've do
S0679	mm
S0680	i don't he didn't do the as he might've do the the bs
S0679	be in and erm the youngest what's the youngest 's name
S0680	yeah
S0679	and be in the same class and they be in 's so
S0680	be in 's class yeah what be that when it be a
S0679	three a four a
S0680	four when do he have father
S0679	that be
S0680	oh that be sorry yeah
S0679	the the er the other boy
S0680	yeah but i mean it be difficult from that point of view because if you only have say three master
S0679	mm
S0680	who be go to do that
S0679	mm
S0680	then the if you've get a few children the likelihood of you get your parent
S0679	mm
S0680	be quite high
S0679	yeah it's work out quite well i mean they they know you're come don't they they've get a few years to plan it
S0680	mm up to a point
S0679	because dad didn't always do i mean he do other things didn't he
S0680	oh he he occasionally he do he he do erm the remove one year
S0679	and he have he need to have the c and d class
S0680	mm
S0679	didn't he cs anyway
S0680	well that's it that's what i say the remove
S0679	mm
S0680	which be
S0679	mm
S0680	sort of drop off the scale
S0679	mm
S0680	mm
S0679	it be a nice letter tonice erm email from
S0680	yes say say about father yeah
S0679	say how much say how much he er he be a lose eleven year old and how he help and
S0680	yes
S0679	without and without dad he wouldn't've get to
S0680	no
S0679	and without he wouldn't've get to university
S0680	well when we hear that programme i tell
S0679	mm and he be just so like
S0680	yeah
S0679	i mean i don't know whether i mean that that sort of look
S0680	mm
S0679	erm i mean the all the children have er look quite similar
S0680	yes
S0679	but you know because he's get the dark hair
S0680	mm
S0679	and some of the sort of some of the clothe you be show that belong to
S0680	yeah
S0679	but i don't suppose i'll ever get to see the it's hard enough even keep
S0680	no
S0679	up with with
S0680	well might have like to have do something in the music industry you know sound sound engineer
S0679	yeah yeah yeah
S0680	type thing
S0679	well he could have apply to the bbc but
S0680	but er you know it it wasn't
S0679	well he kind of want to stay in although
S0680	no i mean earlier earlier when he be at university he could have go into sound
S0679	yes well we all could have go into many different things
S0680	computers and things he do electronics but you see sound engineer wasn't kind of a
S0679	mm
S0680	kind of an acceptable career path in some ways
S0679	mm
S0680	in our in in those days because they they didn't i mean now i mean like like be it 's sons have have do something or something like that
S0679	one of them be isn't he yeah
S0680	yeah but they be both a bite sort of something in that direction because that one be only work in an estate agents as a
S0679	oh yes that be
S0680	temporary job
S0679	no no it be his while he be a term time job at university
S0680	yeah and that's what i mean it be a just a
S0679	it mean he have a car because
S0680	yeah
S0679	either he be give the car to do the job or he have the car because
S0680	but there be actually course on
S0679	mm
S0680	sound engineer and things where
S0679	yeah i think it would do i think
S0680	you can now but
S0679	there's something at erm whatever anglia ruskin be call these days
S0680	yeah yeah yeah
S0679	you know the old poly
S0680	yeah
S0679	there's erm i think they have the best course of the type in something to do with audio or something to do because erm er oh a friend of somebody come up anyway
S0680	yes well this be it it's a more recent kind of thing especially with all the digital and stuff
S0679	mm
S0680	and would have quite like that
S0679	and there's lot of things now that weren't sort of job
S0680	yes
S0679	because i always think it be interest the erm the upstairs downstairs the downstairs bite of the upstairs downstairs of you know like things like stately home and actually find out how ordinary people live cos history be all about the the posher people it seem
S0680	well do but i use to like the social history and do social history
S0679	but there be so little it wasn't i mean perhaps it be do at school some of them
S0680	yeah
S0679	but it wasn't it wasn't think worthy of university
S0680	oh no no
S0679	university didn't want to be think about things like that
S0680	oh no
S0679	and the national trust whatever it be do be not it it's only in the last ten years
S0680	might have do kings and queen
S0679	that it's open up you know the
S0680	yeah
S0679	other areas like the dairy and the you know it's it's the
S0680	that's right we only do the kings and queen and the royal
S0679	and the and er where do where be it or no i don't go to very much it must be and they've only
S0680	we go somewhere where somebody be do butter or cheese or
S0679	oh yes that be erm
S0680	something somewhere
S0679	that they they
S0680	yes
S0679	they do more with the erm the other people because until recently they they didn't do anything about the polish folk who be down there
S0680	no
S0679	cos they be live in do the erm oh do radio you know a bite of a minor erm
S0680	yes yeah
S0679	and that be i mean there be other things too and they just weren't weren't job
S0680	yes
S0679	and stuff with biology be very limit and when i be at school i want to do design stuff in art choose erm er things from the biology slide you know
S0680	yes
S0679	when you put make a slide and you stain it
S0680	yes
S0679	and use the shape and the colour from those
S0680	yes
S0679	and that be think to be a a non thing to do
S0680	well that might have be and go because that be big in the early sixties
S0679	well nobody think it be a worthy thing to spend time do in art
S0680	well this be it you see the like of erm early pink floyd use to do slide and things on their back projections of things
S0679	mm mm mm
S0680	which be an innovation
S0679	yes
S0680	and at college we use to do well it's like my pottery and things seed pod and cross section and all of that which be late sixties erm but it kind of have be and go by the time you get to do yours probably
S0679	well maybe
S0680	and wasn't consider
S0679	it wasn't consider a thing to do
S0680	a thing it wasn't a thing it wasn't in vogue either really
S0679	no
S0680	and you see with he do his electronic and electrical and he only have a you know half a term on these things call computers and they have this enormous thing you could add two and two on kind of stuff you know didn't do much you could write a little program for it
S0679	mm that's what i use at university
S0680	but erm that be you know in when do come out of university seventy two three and then of course he do his he go to do his electronical things and then computers come in so that's why he sort of take up an interest in that cos that be the new thing
S0679	mm
S0680	cos it wasn't something you do at university
S0679	university in nineteen eighty two or nineteen eighty three i be do ecology and statistics and ecology and you have to use a mainframe link to a mainframe that be in the state or something
S0680	yes
S0679	you know be and you know you put you punch it all in and whatever you have to do
S0680	yes
S0679	and then you get like forty two out you know
S0680	yes be be it because as i say you know have to learn all that on his own really until he get into a company that send him on course
S0679	and so yeah eighty two and then by the time eighty five the end of eighty five no the yeah the autumn eighty five
S0680	mm
S0679	we be get erm pcs
S0680	mm
S0679	which you know be still recognisable in some ways although people people wouldn't know what to do with them if if they've only use a
S0680	mm
S0679	windows eight environment or whatever
S0680	well that's what find with the younger engineer erm they didn't know any history of erm some sort of things like i can't really think of anything sensible here but er not the examples but there would be something or other and they'd come across the problem they'd come across a problem and say we've get this problem and would say well you've get to do da da da da to get around that and they'd say well why be that sort of think
S0679	mm
S0680	because he say because this thing be derive from you know something back
S0679	mm
S0680	you know previously
S0679	yeah
S0680	so that's how you know it's develop from that so you know on the logic of erm you know that's how that be kind of evolve so it's work that you know cos would say oh well you know do nt four or whatever which these young people didn't know
S0679	mm
S0680	and things or they'd come across something that have something that be a bite old in it and they wouldn't know what to do and would say blah blah blah and they'd say uh and he'd say well because that's the next one after nt four and they develop that from that
S0679	mm
S0680	i mean they didn't all work like that but you know he know the ones that which they hadn't get any idea of what
S0679	no
S0680	you know they they know kind of erm like we say windows eight and they or whatever and they'd know the the sort of more recent number but they wouldn't know
S0679	mm
S0680	things further back cos he'd be sort of on the more or less the whole lot of it
S0679	and i rather suspect that erm might be in the same in the same boat
S0680	yeah although he's a lecturer rather than a
S0679	well he's an academic at but he he's
S0680	i don't know what his actual qualifications be in that sense
S0679	no but he's he's in the compute area isn't he
S0680	mm i mean he won't he may not know the ins and out of it but somebody have to for him to have set up the stuff in the museum
S0679	yes so
S0680	and that's why would have like to have help him with
S0679	oh yes
S0680	with the sun stuff he could have help him with the sun stuff
S0679	that would have be oh he probably could have help with all sort of things actually
S0680	well all of it but he he recognise the sun stuff cos he work on it and he's probably get the spare part as i say and he's get the sun manual
S0679	yeah it would be brilliant if erm well if if
S0680	the memorial wing yes
S0679	do i tell you i have that email from
S0680	yes say yes
S0679	and he still look happy and keen
S0680	yeah
S0679	and in the email i send i do emphasise about erm you know that would have like his stuff to have go there
S0680	yes
S0679	and you know that cos in case he just forget who we be cos it's be a while since we've be in touch
S0680	well as i say and it also would be worth mention that have i think you mention that we'd see it on a programme
S0679	oh yeah er well i i think i mention him originally
S0680	originally because have have have you know the wherewithal to be able to get there
S0679	mm cos it's not like a million miles away but it be a bite awkward isn't it
S0680	it's not a million miles but it's an awkward thing to sort of commute to
S0679	cos that journey's a bite not very nice be it
S0680	no it's little roads and things but if it say if it be if it be just like or you know sort of closer round then he would have be able to sort of go probably
S0680	yeah you know just somewhere on the outskirts but it's just that little bite too far
S0679	mm
S0680	but erm this be it you say to him as an ex sun sun engineer and as an ex sun one of the company he work for he be an ex sun engineer erm he he would have er be quite interest in help
S0679	yeah well that sadly be not gonna happen
S0680	no no
S0679	but
S0680	cos he do all the he do a the sun at university you see because have probably get i don't know whether he ever work at but he he certainly do sun at in fact some of them may still have well they won't now they've chuck them out but you know what i mean they use to have his name in them cos he do some for the now what be it it be the be it the linguistics department
S0679	yeah
S0680	no not the linguistics something to do with language and speech and it might be linguistics which seem to be in the bowels of the earth at university and there be this sort of little man who be like a little mole and he be one of these sort of character unkempt with a sort of nylon shirt
S0679	mm
S0679	in this rather close erm warm room which be not the best thing i think it be a bite fragrant down there and this boffin person this he be he be something to do with language and erm not from the point of erm literature and things but it be in the components of language and how languages be you know
S0679	that sound like linguistics
S0680	linguistics that's it it be it be something to do with linguistics and this little fellow have sun down in his den because use to go down and he be a a funny man cos he didn't he be one of these little fellows who get on and he didn't have a great have to sort of talk talk to him cos he wasn't use to talk to people cos i think he be about the only person who work down there so he have to kind of erm get him the get him socialise him first cos he he didn't
S0679	yeah
S0680	sort of communicate all he do be do his wire and be try to sort out and make sure he'd get do the thing he want him to do you know but he be a funny little man and i can't remember what his name be but he say he be a very difficult character
S0679	and he be the guy who do linguistics
S0680	yeah but he he do he be kind of research
S0679	oh
