S0519	ah i i think it should be okay go the other way it's erm
S0520	i don't know bite er it's a bite of a bottleneck it's one of those i suppose yeah it's not a busy time of day isn't it be they suppose to tell you on this thing when there's traffic as well
S0519	they do yes erm i don't always trust it really we need to get it update cos cos we've have the car six years erm they bring to update but i think they charge a hundred pound or something so 's mind go be you have a laugh
S0520	what a wally
S0519	not have an update so we end up we go to things that be roundabouts and it say turn leave at the junction you know and things like that so place be not be not you know as they be
S0520	mm
S0519	it doesn't have them wally erm so first thing i do when we get home be take the key from dad
S0520	yeah you have to set reminders this be the key apparently not that i've ever do it but accord it's all about reminder set
S0519	so i've get a like a reminder thing but i've never know how it work really
S0520	yeah well it's quite easy just erm select the time of day and the day that you want to be remind and you write something in the box like key from dad and then it make it make a little song at that time but you have to be kind of one of those peep that have their phone with them
S0519	all the time
S0520	yeah and 's phone be constantly go off with these things and er it's quite a good thing to do because the those type of things that you forget and it's just a massive pain in the backside
S0519	i can't believe i didn't take it from him or that nothing twig but like that yesterday when i couldn't find my glass my mind use to be
S0520	yeah
S0519	that it would know that i didn't have them with me and i couldn't see the paper and there be so many clue and i didn't remember them
S0520	yeah
S0519	that be unusual and and it's happen a couple of time and i it erm i just start to realise that my mind isn't as good as it be cos i never use to make list or do anything cos i have a pretty good
S0520	you just remember yeah know i can imagine
S0519	erm but now i i really need to
S0520	need some assistance yeah well the thing be with look for things i mean the wallet for instance be that dad could have move it with no recollection of have do so and he often do
S0519	no that's right
S0520	so you know and then
S0519	so you then be
S0520	he's so surprise that you're ask him what he's do with it
S0519	i know i know
S0520	and it's like really dad you know it's not really a time to be take offence its just that's the way you be
S0519	this be normally what you do yeah
S0520	yeah
S0519	but this time it wasn't him which be hilarious
S0520	well why do you why do you put it in the
S0519	well i didn't i didn't so whatever they be all pile up weren't they and erm
S0520	well it do quite often prove to be him be a wally doesn't it
S0519	of course yeah
S0520	oh yeah now i remember vaguely yeah this be what 's try to teach me list and reminders he say that's the way forward you make list of what you need to do and in his case list upon list upon list i think he spend more time
S0519	i forget to text him back er i want to wait till dad have get the reply from the removers the remover guy think it's go to take two days which it isn't but we'll have to just let him have his two days so i tell dad not to change anything else
S0520	so the when be they come eventually
S0519	friday saturday
S0520	oh
S0519	but i personally think he'll get it all do on the friday cos we've get much less of a normal pack stuff that most people have cos we're gonna move you know picture and some things here that we've already take
S0520	yeah it's none of that fiddly stuff
S0519	lot of stuff the kitchen there's hardly anything leave in the kitchen
S0520	yeah i dunno maybe they need to time to suss it out before the start as well like figure out what go in where
S0519	he do say the travel erm so that's fine i don't mind
S0520	yeah
S0519	but if if they're come back for a second day then it'll be pretty quick the second day cos it'll just be load the van and go
S0520	so then you could drive back on the saturday yeah
S0519	so we'd drive back on the saturday yeah
S0520	have you be with this morning er
S0519	good gosh i'd give a lot for that to work out for him
S0520	yeah i mean even if it's just on a stable
S0519	even if it stay as a voluntary job and he's he's happy
S0520	keep do it yeah
S0519	that's right but erm he one of the other people just as it happen one of the other people start out like him do some voluntary work and then be take on to do a few hours you know
S0520	yeah
S0519	a few hours' pay work
S0520	do you think he'll stay up there
S0519	erm i don't know i don't know er he certainly seem so we be say he you know he wasn't quite the same the last few time but er still quite good
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm but there be some some er sort of thing with the friendship with that that's really quite important cos he he's not really get a lot go on if he hasn't get this friendship erm
S0520	and where's he from
S0519	erm so he's in
S0520	no but be he part of like where do they meet be he
S0519	they meet through the schizophrenia

S0519	that way
S0520	yeah
S0519	oh god
S0520	that's where i'm from erm but okay i mean yeah it just seem that it's quite er seem to be the cycle doesn't it you know that he have these friendships with people
S0519	that's right
S0520	but they're not very stable
S0519	no it's very intense
S0520	you can understand why
S0519	mm sort of try to help him to realise that you know they have their off days and they have their low moments
S0520	of course
S0519	and they have their time that they need quiet
S0520	time off yeah
S0519	and it doesn't mean they don't want to be with you
S0520	mm
S0519	but anyway erm we'll see
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm
S0520	but you don't think that he'll decide i mean he could decide to move further south
S0519	south
S0520	i mean i know it's a huge upheaval in term of his life and also all of the erm social service that he's
S0519	the support that's right
S0520	connect to
S0519	that's right erm
S0520	i mean it's good that you'll see him you know
S0519	we've get this regular thing go
S0520	regularly yeah so as long as that and but i just wonder if he'll feel you know once you're go
S0519	it's just too
S0520	that he's too kind of er
S0519	too isolate
S0520	isolate i don't know if he would
S0519	if something come of the job or any job i think that could make a big difference

S0520	and the people at erm that he use to be connect to at the house where do they still keep in touch at all
S0519	no they don't know
S0520	no that's a shame
S0519	yeah it you know i i suppose it's not part of it yeah
S0520	i guess they've just get to focus on yeah i suppose it's not part of it yeah
S0519	he's he's sort of pass over to the next so he's get some other erm support system erm and eh see two people erm that's a big change you know just two people a week instead of somebody every day

S0520	they have to be good i find
S0519	really good i love them
S0520	yeah i agree
S0519	and sometimes they're a bite dense
S0520	sometimes they have a weird texture yeah
S0519	yeah oh we're right there
S0520	i know not like it
S0519	erm
S0520	we go to this place a couple of time in thailand which we didn't we don't like very much but they do with some friends and they erm it's like a buffet it's kind of a traditional way to eat
S0519	mm
S0520	erm they come with a boil hot sort of well in the middle of the table with water at the bottom and a kind of a a raise bite with a blob of fat basically and you go to this massive buffet and you choose all this raw food and they have like meat seafood vegetables and different stuff and then you cook it yourself in this kind of
S0519	vat
S0520	vat of everyone else's food as well and erm it's just basically really grim but what remind me be that you get prawn but they're like not cook yet so they're that grey colour
S0519	mm
S0520	which be really off put erm but if you do buy them fresh like that and then cook them yourself they have that really nice texture instead of the kind of
S0519	okay
S0520	massively over heat dense
S0519	yeah yeah
S0520	thing but yeah gosh they have a lot of weird look creature that you can put in your bowl you know it's not that nice and nothing taste of anything cos
S0519	well you've just boil it in water
S0520	you've just boil it in water yeah and the fat as some flavour in it i don't know i'd rather have a someone
S0519	yeah well it's a kind of a bite like erm what's it call that's not fondue that's
S0520	yeah exactly
S0519	cook your meat in the middle of the table
