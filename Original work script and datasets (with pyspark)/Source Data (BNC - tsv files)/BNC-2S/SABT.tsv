S0037	okay be that upstairs
S0115	it be the fire alarm i don't know whose it be
S0037	okay i'll check i've this thing work i think that's okay
S0115	well the fire alarm's get a heat sensor so it's not really the smoke
S0037	no
S0115	which we know cos we fill the house with smoke recently
S0037	well
S0115	and it didn't set the alarm off
S0037	no i'm surprise that you would think it would be smoke
S0115	erm
S0037	i think like it doesn't make sense that it just to be
S0115	yeah but it's maybe partly like serious smoke but er
S0037	what do you mean
S0115	like maybe like proper
S0037	ah like black smoke not like bite of chicken that you've leave on a bite long
S0115	death smoke yeah rather than just like a bite of sausage or something but
S0037	yeah mm
S0115	er what's on the tv tonight then
S0037	erm i think be masterchef not on because it's not on on a friday because like prime time television's on on a friday
S0115	er i don't normally watch it on friday i don't think
S0037	oh be it no it's not on it's like erm like good things be suppose to be on the friday
S0115	but it but it be on quite a few days it's on like
S0037	mm mm
S0115	it's on like monday tuesday or wednesday or something isn't it
S0037	because it be like before it be the erm the real ones like the real chefs the last series but this time it's like the like the like normal people like from or something
S0115	oh right yeah so it's just like oh yeah the the general public
S0037	but like they've totally change the form haven't they because like do you remember when it be lloyd grossman and it be just like three people stand behind like some plywood
S0115	yeah i remember those ones i remember the lloyd grossman ones with the er the black it be quite black
S0037	the the set
S0115	the the the set be sort of dark and like
S0037	i remember the music
S0115	the kitchens be the the kitchens be they have little kitchens arrange in a sort of a there be four of them or something and they be arrange in a sort of square or something
S0037	no wasn't there three of them oh yeah
S0115	they use to sort of walk around erm in the blackness sort of go from the kitchen to little kitchen to little kitchen and er
S0037	he's funny because wasn't he a chef before lloyd grossman
S0115	i don't know
S0115	he make he make the sauce doesn't he he make the
S0037	well do you hear about that sauce though like one of his sauce like do they kill somebody or
S0037	honestly
S0115	so no no look if if i hear you correctly you say one of his sauce cook sauce kill somebody
S0037	yeah yeah no i'm i'm not tell i don't know if it definitely kill them but like
S0115	you mean that someone die eat the the sauce yeah
S0037	no no no no it didn't like just like choke on it it have something horrible in it like i don't know like campylobacter or some really horrible
S0115	yeah like salmonella or something
S0037	i don't know i'll have to google it it have like
S0115	so someone so someone die at one of his er what he do like a italian or tomato sauce
S0037	i don't know like
S0115	and someone eat that and and die of and er
S0037	i think it be pasta sauce but they all have to be recall there be like a massive product recall and i just think i just think about
S0115	he'd have to do he'd have to do where they'd have to be destroy so he'd have to lot of mini impressions of himself be burn so it would be quite
S0037	like like a pyre of lloyd grossman sauce
S0115	it it will be quite upset erm to see all those mini mes be sort of burn
S0037	well but i'm sure it i'm sure it's lloyd grossman maybe i've get that completely wrong it's probably slanderous
S0115	one of something like that yeah
S0037	anyway but yeah i think masterchef's on
S0115	erm that's a risk that's cool
S0037	but the thing be though unless
S0115	er different now isn't it because we've have so much more cook program
S0037	mm
S0115	that kind of explosion of cook recently
S0037	oh good them them horrible baker boys oh they're so annoy i don't think i can watch them
S0115	i've see them they're er
S0037	they're so annoy
S0115	they're sort of two little gordon ramseys or something
S0037	no they're not even like that they're just so like public school and like oh the first one to make the most tasty chapatti win what ho it's like don't you think it's really annoy
S0115	i think it's quite fake it look quite like they're pretend to be like very competitive
S0037	and they're live this like they in this idyllic place where just like he's the butcher and i'm the baker and my other sister's the candlestick maker or something it's just stupid that might be a lie
S0115	well they're they're live they're live the i know well they're suppose to live in in two shop next door to each other one of them one of them be a butcher and then one of them be a baker and then
S0037	well i think it's just bull well i think it's just make up i think it's a set i think they're just actors it's all a lie
S0115	yeah
S0037	anyway what i be say originally
S0115	well yeah it do look a bite a bite fake actually yeah
S0037	what i be say before about masterchef be like do you see i think i think i think originally it be like erm in australia they change the format and make it really like with flame and like chop you know really dramatic and like make people cry and shout at them and so over here they change the format because if you remember a few series ago like greg wallace and jonty rhodes weren't even like
S0115	his his name for the record be john torode
S0037	no it's not it's jonty anyway like no because a few a few series ago it be like erm just normal like hello mary what be you cook and now it's like the contestants will never survive it's like
S0115	yeah it's more like er something that would have arnold schwarzenegger rather than like than sort of fanny craddock or whatever
S0037	like yeah it's like action cook yeah
S0115	mind you she be she's a bite scary a little bite
S0037	with the eyebrows do you see do you see her eyebrows
S0115	yeah i mean i i think i think i think she could take on schwarzenegger like
S0037	what be her helper what be her little call again
S0115	i don't know er oddjob
S0037	no i can't remember no i don't think it be oddjob
S0115	yeah i don't know like er
S0037	he be like her sort of obedient husband and she use to like shout at him and stuff have you ever see it it's sometimes on like
S0115	that's that's disturb actually
S0037	i don't really see it because we haven't get a at home
S0115	you don't you don't have a like a box set of a
S0037	no but there's all those food channel like we haven't get them just because we've get freeview
S0115	oh yeah well there's that american one isn't there when he he his his purpose be to sort of eat as much as he can before he sort of die
S0037	man versus food
S0115	yeah
S0037	oh he's a pig him
S0115	he he sort of he have a show call the america's greediest person or something and then yeah
S0037	man man versus food
S0115	oh right yeah and er mind you some of the things they eat be tasty look but they're just very large yeah
S0037	yeah it always look tasty but like a tiny plate of it not like seven you know cow in a bap or something
S0115	he's like a elvis elvis burger or something
S0037	it's like super chilly yeah like twenty five elvis elvis burgers and sixteen milkshakes and that it's like extreme eat but yeah
S0115	okay erm
S0037	but yeah i think
S0115	do but now so but you actually like watch erm masterchef don't you
S0037	yeah it's nice
S0115	the new one with yeah
S0037	i like i do like i like sort of erm although i think like the format like i don't mind a bite of excite jazzy cook and all that like who know what's go to happen this week i like i don't really mind that but i think like this time one thing they've change in this series that's just start be that like the erm the contestants it feel like so they do the first bite where they've get like the invention thing and they get all different ingredients and they have to make something and then but then straight away after that i think they've already kick like one person off and then straight away after that it's like the bite where they'd have to go in a restaurant so like the first of all they make bean on toast and then next think they're down like you know the savoy hotel like rustle up some foie gras or something it just seem a bite extreme but
S0115	yeah they it seem extremely hard to to work in that high pressure environment in in a big you know proper posh restaurant like it seem there's still a kind of like
S0037	i think i wouldn't like sorry yeah when they send it back and it's like that dribble be one millimetre too big and all that
S0115	yeah it's i think ex military chef
S0037	the foam isn't foamy enough
S0115	yeah
S0037	but i think it's why i don't think i'd like to be a chef because like erm i don't think i'd like the hours
S0115	yeah the oh yeah actually because it be a bite sort of well you've get a lunch one that's alright er er
S0037	no but you can't just say i'm go to be like a lunchtime chef
S0115	you could do they not have that do they not
S0037	that's a dinner lady
S0115	that i consider be like a chef and i think if i have be a chef i would have want to work in during brunch and lunch
S0037	dinner lady then
S0115	er suppose so tuck tuck shop and er
S0037	do it so like what happen if you're a man and you be a dinner lady do you get call like a dinner man
S0115	er just chef i think er
S0037	well that seem a bite sexist if the dinner ladies be call the dinner ladies
S0115	yeah well that's just composition really i mean that's what they be isn't it they're but they er he's erm
S0037	maybe like with the political correctness maybe they're like dinner persons or something lunchtime operatives i bet i bet
S0037	the lunchtime lunchtime facilitation operative
S0115	i like operative but the special special operations at lunch or something
S0037	lunchtime nourishment facilitator or something
S0115	but other that's that's amaze er but i think if you can't do the lunch shift then you've then get to sort of hang around from lunch till like even
S0037	but do they not have to prep load of stuff like on gordon ramsey's thing they have to like shave load of like carrots and that and otherwise know as peel
S0115	shave carrots do they call it shave when they it's peel isn't it
S0037	i don't think they do yeah i'm just be stupid
S0115	not a skin the carrot or something
S0037	no but do you know what i mean they've get to like chop things and like
S0115	yeah yeah yeah i mean i guess well er they probably have like mass of stuff like freeze as well or or
S0037	i don't know
S0115	they have to make it in bulk or something so like a bite pot or something
S0037	do they not like turn their nose up at them kind of things like
S0115	i well i think they're say that they might say they might say they do but i think they maybe secretly i think there be a lot of defrost and microwave that go on behind the scenes
S0037	yeah but sometimes like they must have to half cook like they must have to like half cook stuff because like otherwise like they wouldn't be able to do stuff would they some things some things just take a long time to cook like if you be slow roast things they must have to half do them the same as like when you go out for food like when you go to wetherspoon's and you ask for like a roast dinner and it come after like seven minutes it's like hmm
S0115	erm those be probably microwave aren't they
S0037	i know
S0115	yeah but not not bad though
S0037	it's a bite disturb really isn't it really when you think about it
S0115	what
S0037	like radiate your food
S0115	oh you mean the science behind microwave er
S0037	do you not think
S0115	it's just a bite space agey it's a bite sort of you know that's have that happen er that shouldn't shouldn't work
S0037	yeah
S0115	erm obviously radio wave go through our head all the time don't they like when we're on the mobile phone or something but they have different ones
S0037	yeah but i mean to purposely do that to eat your dinner seem a bite weird
S0115	how they find it out must be quite interest must have be have some fun
S0037	yeah like accidentally leave his sandwich
S0115	er blast each blast themselves and various food items with radiation must have have a crack crack afternoon erm
S0037	i don't even miss one like cos obviously we haven't get enough room but i don't even miss it have not not have a microwave
S0115	erm so a microwave yeah it's to do with the er frequency and i think it's to do with the water molecules vibrate or something
S0037	mm i don't know
S0115	erm and there's some stuff you can't put in isn't there like you can't put metal in
S0037	yeah like when you're i get really like shout at home when i put like they've get like a plate with like a golden edge or something and i put a dinner in the microwave it be like and i be think oh crap like it's kill the microwave but i just kill the plate so
S0115	yeah
S0037	no wasn't impress but never mind
S0115	no she's she's no er
S0037	but anyway erm
S0115	and er
S0037	but we don't have to watch micro micro chef micro chef maybe that would be a good one maybe like a masterchef but
S0115	micro chef no well we've we've talk so much about him that
S0037	maybe they could have like a round where they could only use a microwave like there's no ovens they just have to microwave everything that's similar to my other idea that i have before and like you know in masterchef in the first bite when like they have to choose the food
S0115	yeah but yeah
S0037	like and they've get like lovely cut of beef and like shellfish and like lovely ham and that i'd like it if instead like they have like quaver some stick of twix like er some jam erm maybe some frazzle a couple of pickle onions
S0115	like a dream like a sort of twenty like a grocer's shop
S0037	no but like instead of the fresh ingredients they have to make something out of like some frazzle a twix
S0115	yeah yeah like a newsagent's so you'd have a newsagent's full of good and you have to go in the newsagent and grab
S0037	oh yeah like that's some strawberry lace but newsagents have like milk and that so they'd have to be off
S0115	be it just like things that survive be this like a sort of wartime thing where you can only use things that that be not perishable so
S0037	i don't know i haven't think it through as a concept
S0115	you erm it's just like wartime cook so it's like
S0037	nothing wrong with a bite of wartime cook
S0115	it's like er corn beef er things that things that wash up on the on the you'll find on like the beach wash up from like some submarine or something like a spam or whatever so
S0037	i'm not i'm not have you say anything bad about corn beef i'm afraid don't be horrible there's nothing wrong with spam they wouldn't have any
S0115	er no no i like erm er certain type of that sort of meat luncheon meat sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	but er
S0037	i do corn beef be really nice but all those old things be come back though aren't they like erm sweet bread and all that and like
S0115	be that that's the pancreas be it
S0037	it's some sort of horrible disgust i didn't know if it be their erm testicles or if it be like
S0115	so it's make a comeback be it pancreas be back yeah
S0037	be it the pancreas sweet bread
S0115	yeah i think so yeah erm parson's nose that's some something
S0037	horrible piece yeah
S0115	er
S0037	brain for meat
S0115	well i think it's good to use to use it you know like
S0037	and it's nearly burn night
S0115	erm
S0037	it's prime offal eat time
S0115	yeah it's it's probably better not to to waste it than let it sort of get go in to sort of unscrupulous dealers and probably again anyway so
S0037	yeah well it's i'm sure that's what's it like sausages be all just sawdust and like hooves and like you know ears and that isn't it
S0115	sawdust yeah
S0037	well unless you get those really expensive ones
S0115	yeah well i mean when we think of something as be tasty that maybe doesn't correspond with the actual quality of the ingredients
S0037	yeah
S0115	we may well think that that some like a pizza would be very tasty but whereas in in fact it's just really a kind of low quality dough and like low quality cheese and low quality tomato sauce and stuff and so it's not very good quality but it's tasty but
S0037	yeah like that pizza we have at that be horrible and sometimes if you put salt on things it just make it taste way nicer than it be anyway
S0115	yeah and erm
S0037	and like i don't think i could eat like you know erm like a fry or even any sort of egg without a nice bite of salt on it
S0115	yeah er definitely i think you have to have a little bite of salt with your egg yeah sort of
S0037	oh i really fancy a boil egg that's stupid i've just have me tea and then that enormous piece of cake that i've just scoff then what do you think of that cake
S0115	erm yeah i i like that cake though it have like it be like a sort of well it be a chocolate sponge but it have like a little little like er like a sauce like a chocolate sauce in the middle and that be that be pretty good
S0037	i don't think i do it i excuse me yeah i don't think i do it any favour by leave it on the bench like but never mind
S0115	hmm mm er
S0037	i come i wake up this morning and i come
S0115	well you mature it you you've let it you've let it age you've let it breathe
S0037	that's that's one theory i can i get out of bed this morning and i be like oh i've leave the cake on the side it be all crispy never mind
S0115	well at least it's it's breathe you know so
S0037	that's one one way of put it but never mind
S0115	so er what's your favourite thing that you enjoy cook the most like do you enjoy cook like er bigger dish the savoury dish or like sweet dish or or like pastry
S0037	i don't know i've i quite i quite like eat savoury oh i quite like eat full just stop the sentence there i quite like eat like cake and things erm but i think like the thing with only be two of us like if i make a whole cake i'll eat like fifty percent of the whole cake so that's probably not very good for anyone
S0115	right so you sort of prefer more like more like sensible food more then
S0037	yeah i don't really make cake so i'll then do other than well i don't know i mean i like cook so i don't like micro meals or anything we haven't even get a microwave like i say but erm yeah er i don't know i like erm i've be hanker after a leg of lamb for a while haven't i i haven't get round to that yet christmas i be overrule never mind
S0115	you just have that er oh well we let i think it be the majority er
S0037	i know it be a majority vote
S0115	my parent request a turkey with all the trimmings erm which mean stuff er and those little bacon and sausage things which i think be call pig in blanket or something er
S0037	yeah i'm not even that fond on them
S0115	that's the er but we have a it be a good it be a good dinner though
S0037	ah i don't know though do you not think turkey's get like a funny taste
S0115	er i think all meat have its own distinct taste turkey's very healthy
S0037	no but i mean that's not what i say i didn't say like do you think turkey's get a a flavour on it on its own i mean like do you think it's a bite weird
S0115	erm no i don't think i mean i think the turkey leg i'm not like i don't normally eat as much of that but like that's good for like curry and stuff
S0037	mm mm yeah
S0115	er i like the turkey breast yeah because it's good for you and
S0037	yeah
S0115	erm yeah turkey's okay i mean
S0037	i think it's unnecessary that they cook like the whole turkey
S0115	but you're suppose to have like a well i mean in term of quantity in term of yeah i be go to say but like traditionally at christmas like
S0037	it can be a goose somebody should get goose or get a goose and put a turkey put a which would put a goose inside the turkey inside the with a chicken inside that with a
S0115	this be the be that the the sort of what be it er some one of the tv chefs do that didn't they
S0037	yeah i think they have it in aldi though like a big freeze one
S0115	erm they actually they've they've do it already so this be like a russian doll of bird be it
S0037	cut price yeah
S0115	so you've get like
S0037	like a oh i think i have the magazine somewhere about it the aldi magazine
S0115	erm
S0037	it be like a four bird erm four bird roast or something
S0115	so what what do it what what be the
S0037	i don't know like a robin inside like a sparrow inside like a crow inside like an owl inside like a chicken or something
S0115	it could it could go on indefinitely couldn't it it should it could sort of keep go couldn't it
S0037	don't know may not be true er no no i think it be erm what be them little things call those little ones
S0115	er poussin or something
S0037	yeah poussin
S0115	be that like be that not a baby or something or
S0037	i don't know be it no i think it's a special
S0115	er wood pigeons be quite small aren't they they sound small er yeah
S0037	oh maybe it be pigeon anyway it be one of those inside erm be it inside a no a chicken must be the third one and duck must be the and sorry and turkey must be the last one maybe it be a duck maybe it be a little thingybob inside a duck inside a chicken inside a
S0115	yeah
S0037	that's nobody need that many meat it's a meat
S0115	it's that's extravagance i mean like we have become more like as a nation in term of cook
S0037	but you can get that in aldi like just as if that be like a normal thing jam cereal four bird stuff inside each other like seem a bite bite far fetch but it might be nice i should of get one
S0115	well it's just the it's just the sheer think of er luxury of it i suppose
S0037	but that's christmas people go crackers don't they
S0115	literally
S0037	literally crackers both sense of the word crackers
S0115	er
S0037	they what's your favourite christmas food like i mean i'm not oh i think i would have like i don't think you can beat a mince pie really
S0115	erm there's that yeah there's them
S0037	i like a nice warm mince pie
S0115	i like er i like all of it i like the pudding er christmas pudding be good
S0037	some mull wine
S0115	er which you pour brandy over and set fire to
S0037	oh i don't like christmas do you know i think it's too
S0115	and er then er you could put some kind of sauce like a rum sauce or like a brandy sauce over it and then that's good
S0037	i know i don't know i think it's just do you i think it's like fatty do you not find like it's like on the top of your mouth
S0115	er well the it christmas pudding yeah it would have that cos it's sort of suet isn't it i mean it would have depend probably on the temperature that he eat it er but i think you're suppose to mix it with other stuff like other
S0037	what do you mean
S0115	the you know the sauce
S0037	the custard
S0115	then that would take away the sort of stodginess of it and replace it with a more
S0037	what what if you're eat it with brandy butter you mean like that's not go to take away
S0115	well not necessarily brandy but you could have like rum sauce or custard or ice cream or
S0037	uh huh maybe ice cream
S0115	some some kind of cream vanilla cream or something but er erm
S0037	yeah actually i saw
S0115	if you mix it it be really nice i think like the sort of er christmas pudding like if you sort of get the custard and sort of like stab it a bite with the spoon then it sort of go into this kind of mixture which be like half half way pudding and half way custard
S0037	yeah mm er well on you know this morning you know the erm you know this morning the programme on this morning anyway i think it be that no oh well they make like erm
S0115	that's what do it use to be with like anne and no well that's good morning
S0037	er anne diamond that's gmtv
S0115	no no anne and nick that that be another the one wasn't it er be it be it the one that use to have richard and judy
S0037	no that be be it
S0115	well do they use to do it or
S0037	oh yeah maybe it's with phillip well it use to be phillip and fern and then it's now it's i think it's the silver fox and holly
S0115	be that a phillip and holly willoughby
S0037	holly willoughby yeah
S0115	er yeah
S0037	erm
S0115	well i've never see that with him and her
S0037	no well i watch it be it over christmas anyway they make like a i feel like i'm be like my nana like you know when you show up it's like ten thousand story avenues you're just like oh the other day
S0115	yeah i mean well we've be go down a sort of like elderly sort of theme i think like we're talk about like kitchens and yeah
S0037	food well that's why dinner's at the table i suppose but anyway erm no what be i say oh yeah he he make like erm sorry he make like erm yorkshire not yorkshire pudding christmas pudding ice cream so like have some christmas pudding and mix it with this ice cream mixture and like make an ice cream that probably be nice
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	or be it mince pie ice cream either way maybe he do both that seem nice rather than just like on its own
S0115	yeah erm that's that's probably quite quite possibly true yeah erm that you can sometimes it's better to mix stuff than it be to have it on their own
S0037	yeah but the thing be about mince about christmas pudding be like it's literally the last thing that you need after a giant giant dinner do you know what i'll just have a massive suet pudding like it seem crazy
S0115	hmm oh well i mean yeah i think that you've get to have a bite of a break after the er the turkey course
S0037	mm i bite of a snooze
S0115	you've get to sort of erm yeah you can't you don't want to also i've less i find it's better to have less erm like potato and less er er bread or you don't like those sort of starchy things cos

S0115	oh yeah just but then of course you get the leftovers you get leftovers for
S0037	i could happily pass on the mash though i don't like that i don't know maybe it's because like you know when you be at school i don't know if they do this at your school do do you like have to erm like at my junior school you use to sit on a table with load of other kid and like they you didn't go up like to a hatch and get your food or anything they kind of bring it out and then the oldest kid on the table have to serve it out to all of the other younger kid

S0115	oh right i just it's i've get quite vague memories of that but i think we have like the er the er hall and then and then you you go up and get your stuff from those dinner ladies that you're you're talk about and then er and erm also like but most people would have er or a pack lunch or some people have free er dinners as well erm
S0037	yeah no but yeah yeah but erm i have school dinners for a long time anyway and then so it use to come out in these like metal tray like sort of dish and if you be like the older kid you get to serve it but if you be the younger kid you just have to like wait until so the older kid would be like oh what do you want and you'd say yeah i'll have a bite of everything or whatever it be on the dinner that day mince or whatever but with the potatoes it use to be like i could only describe as be ice cream scoop into like portion
S0115	oh yeah yeah oh yeah we use to have them sort of ones like the that's old fashion sort of british erm mash potatoes it's like a it's it's like smash isn't it it's like erm like that's mix from a sachet or something then it it's sort of very very er very like runny isn't it yeah
