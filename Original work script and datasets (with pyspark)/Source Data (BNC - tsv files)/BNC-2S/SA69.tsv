S0262	and erm oh yes i tell you all about my erm mum's half sister yeah i tell you all about that
S0302	no you didn't there be no time
S0262	oh
S0302	you say you'd meet
S0262	mm
S0302	your mum's
S0262	so we'd run out of time to talk talk about that right okay erm oh yeah so no she be this adorable welsh woman erm and
S0302	where where do you discover do you always know she be there
S0262	no not at all so what happen be that my dad receive a letter that be address to my mum but my mum have pass on so my dad open it
S0302	oh right so this be after she die oh
S0262	and there's this guy
S0302	that's a shame
S0262	call sorry
S0302	yeah
S0262	and erm he's he's an he's an old gentleman he's in his eighties and he'd write to my mum say oh you know i've be ask you for quite some time now if i could measure your children
S0302	be your mum
S0262	yeah if i could measure your children do you have an answer for me so dad be like measure your children what's that about
S0302	mm and they've be ask for some time
S0262	mm and dad just simply write back to him think oh i'll just tell him that you know 's pass on and erm and then but i don't think i'll probably hear anything again from him
S0302	yeah
S0262	but oh no you know of course he write back and say you know he say it's
S0302	mm mm mm mm
S0262	and then he go on to say what he'd be do for the last fifty years which have be basically he's a scientist he's a sort of genetic researcher of some kind he's be do this for years in this welsh family that happen to be my mum's dad who's call
S0302	oh
S0262	be be the family that he's be fascinate by and he's be do all this research into it
S0302	so wait a minute so can i go back up one thing so this be your mum's dad
S0262	mm
S0302	who have your mum be your mum bear first or after they be
S0262	my mum be bear first
S0302	mm yeah
S0262	and so mum er my gran
S0302	then the second marriage be the other
S0262	well actually that's the thing at the time that be what happen be probably why they never meet be because though my my grandfather marry my mother er grandmother well that be her name
S0302	yeah
S0262	become through marriage and then they get divorce when my mum be quite about er erm young maybe five ish around that mark
S0302	oh right so do oh you don't know do your mum remember him you don't know
S0262	oh yeah
S0302	oh yeah yeah your dad
S0262	oh my yeah
S0302	oh yeah right
S0262	that's the thing she really hat him
S0302	oh i see she remember him in that way
S0262	because erm as far as she be concern she he turn his back on her as a child and she never receive any she never get she never get the impression that well she put it this way she never felt love by him she certainly felt very reject by him but this be where come in which be my mum's half sister that's my mum's half sister who i meet
S0302	now how much younger be she
S0262	she's what sorry
S0302	how much younger be she than your mum would have be
S0262	well this be what i'm try to figure out because
S0302	because then you can figure out when they get together and when their
S0262	mm
S0302	their children
S0262	well i think it's true that we discuss it i mean she's very open about it all we discuss it quite openly and she say you know i be bear illegitimate and so be my brother so your mother would have have me as a half sister and a half brother and be my father too so your mother and my and me we we share the the father
S0302	yeah
S0262	and it's probably quite fair to say that in those days divorce isn't something you just do with the flick of your wrist
S0302	no well
S0262	you actually have to have a reason
S0302	they don't talk about it
S0262	as well to get divorce in those days
S0302	yeah
S0262	you couldn't just go well actually i don't like
S0302	no
S0262	you have to have a real reason and normally that be adultery
S0302	and usually it be adultery yeah yeah
S0262	so
S0302	so the the they didn't manage to get divorce i presume
S0262	they they get divorce
S0302	oh they do
S0262	they do granny pretty much hightail it out of erm you know which be all the farmy people down there they all know each other and you know how small very small village in wales and she just hightail it and come up to here she figure out that she need to leave anyway that's so so actually go to the same teacher train college as my mother by one year
S0302	no
S0262	they miss each other by one year
S0302	oh
S0262	so when the lecturer the education lecturer say do you know erm a she say no i don't but she'd actually she'd know since the age of eighteen that she have a sister a half sister
S0302	oh okay right but she didn't wanna see her dad so she didn't wanna
S0262	mm
S0302	didn't wanna find out about her
S0262	even she tell me you know about erm eight or nine years ago she'd actually go past the turn in where she know where my mum live she know where she live and she say she'd they'd go up to an interview at university at her take her up and that oh that's where you know my half sister live and i say oh do you think you think to stop to say hello she say well no not really because we'd never meet and also the circumstances be a little strain let's say and i say it's a real shame because my grandmother love talk about you i'm sure i'm not sure
S0302	yeah
S0262	about my mum
S0302	yeah
S0262	but my granny would have be well into the idea
S0302	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	cos i just know what my granny be like anyway and erm
S0302	so it sound like your mum have her in contact then
S0262	i and we'll never know you know and that's the thing be that i'm sure she
S0302	and maybe she just decide oh i don't want anything to do with them
S0262	i she do i'm i'm sure that they both of them know granny my granny and my mum know
S0302	mm
S0262	so they be while i be grow up particularly in my twenties i'd walk into the room and you know you could tell when somebody change the conversation especially when it's when your mother and grandmother you know them pretty well you know that there's something up and they're discuss something that they definitely don't want you
S0302	yeah
S0262	to have to know anything about
S0302	yeah yeah
S0262	and i think this be just some sort of welshness you know cos i always think the welsh be quite introvert and and sort of different because their irish side seem so sort of
S0302	yeah gush
S0262	yeah that's right so i just think that be just a counter thing but no no no now i think i realise that this be more of a a thing about mum and gran discuss probably probably discuss matter relate to that
S0302	yeah
S0262	mm anyway they both go to the same teacher train college by you know miss out by one year
S0302	mm
S0262	and that's really quite strange because as erm tell me she say at the time in wales you know there be a number of teacher train colleges in wales and she'd apply to really quite a number and it just
S0302	well yeah
S0262	and it wasn't right next to where they all live either there be
S0302	no
S0262	you know they'd actually make an effort to go to study at this place so now and then the the theme in the family so she's do this incredible amount of research she have teem and teem and teem of this stuff she's obviously somebody who like that you know ancestry and everything
S0302	mm
S0262	she's very good at it and erm she she actually get me back to you know i think eighteen forties so i be there for a couple of hours and we weren't just talk about that but
S0302	no no no
S0262	it be quite like a nice way to learn about a family learn about her interest learn about where how to actually go about research your family tree because it's not obvious especially when she start twenty five years ago before all of these you know internet and
S0302	oh now there be so it's so much easier i remember my dad do it
S0262	right
S0302	you have to go to actual libraries
S0262	mm
S0302	and registry offices and
S0262	mm
S0302	go through huge tomes
S0262	mm
S0302	which be kind of more excite
S0262	yeah
S0302	but it take a lot of time
S0262	well they do and they go up to london
S0302	yeah
S0262	and she's actually be in a wheelchair for about twenty five years i think she tell me so she put down she's sixty seven so she actually have two children like my mum have but the other way round
S0302	oh right yeah
S0262	so no she have an elder daughter and a you know a son whereas it be the other way round for my mum but they have a pair anyway and roughly about the same age
S0302	yeah it's interest
S0262	and er the even and you know they
S0302	i tell you the more i look
S0262	all about the coincidences
S0302	do they look similar
S0262	mm
S0302	can you kind of see
S0262	mm mm
S0302	cos resemblance
S0262	my
S0302	be a strange thing be isn't it it's feature but it's also manners and
S0262	it's manners
S0302	and how you speak
S0262	well she's put it his way she's
S0302	and she wouldn't have those from your dad
S0262	she's lovely when she say oh absolutely not she say to me erm when we be leave she be in her wheelchair and she be you know at the door at her front door and she say now you know because the welsh you see we always wave people off from the door so that's what i'll do and that's exactly what my mum and gran always use to do and that almost make me go cos that's like so much
S0302	yeah of course
S0262	but the other thing be that there she i show her the letter because this the scientist he's in his eighties but he's keep write to my dad say i want to measure you but i really wanna measure your children like he be that obsess and so he's put this long list and it's all handwritten and he's but he's get a long list of things that he want to know about and myself you know and what i show them to and i say have you do any of these measurements she say yes off and on over the years she say one of the ones be droopy eyelids
S0302	ah
S0262	which my mother have so she i hate my eyelids i hate my eyelids
S0302	oh
S0262	because they come over
S0302	yeah yeah
S0262	really
S0302	yeah yeah i'm gonna end up with that
S0262	and mummy have that too so up to you know probably early sixties she didn't but then from the sixties onwards she definitely do and she use to say the same thing i hate my eyelids
S0302	funny isn't it
S0262	mm oh
S0302	you see your mum didn't wanna meet her otherwise she would have she would have meet all those years ago wouldn't she
S0262	i think it be well out of loyalty
S0302	she would have
S0262	i think it be some perceive loyalty to my grandmother
S0302	yeah
S0262	my grandmother be a pretty easy go person and she be the one who say look let let sleep dog lie that be
S0302	be your grandmother alive still or not
S0262	no
S0302	oh
S0262	she die a couple of years before mummy
S0302	oh you see you can't discuss it either with her
S0262	can't discuss it with her
S0302	this be the frustration when people die you can't talk about anything anymore
S0262	i i know
S0262	but i'm lucky
S0302	and you just wanna say i wanna ask you this
S0262	i know
S0302	and you can't isn't it
S0262	at least i'm lucky i have still like a connection to a blood connection
S0302	mm
S0262	to the family
S0302	mm
S0262	and er in in many ways it's kind of help me to understand that though i didn't know my grandfather at all but it doesn't really matter because what i've learn be that he be just you know one small cog in a very big wheel of this family you know and when you see it from that perspective you actually
S0302	yeah
S0262	learn more about yourself by think about why be it that i'm interest in teach why be it that i'm interest in write why be it i'm interest in filmmaking why be that research what not there be so many character from
S0302	yeah yeah
S0262	much further where i can see that something of me have come from them you know it's not out of the blue that you know i'm like this or that
S0302	no no no no
S0262	that's why i'm i
S0302	yeah exactly
S0262	you know
S0302	yeah
S0262	so
S0302	so be he still alive your grandpa
S0262	no he pass away in nineteen ninety nine
S0302	oh dear this be the terrible thing isn't it
S0262	i know
S0302	do you want a glass of water

S0302	oh yeah
S0262	we're gonna do it again she's gonna show me how
S0302	oh that's nice
S0262	to erm get start but i tell you there be a bite about my own family as in erm my mother's my grandmother's side of the family
S0302	yeah
S0262	cos i've get load of black and white photograph of them and i'm a little bite mesmerise by my grandmother's father because he be a really dash chap and he have all sort of adventure around the world and he be the captain of a ship an engineer captain on a big cruise liner and he do lot of things during the first all of these things fascinate me you go boat always fascinate me through my mother and my grandmother cos they be great cruisers they travel the world on cruise so it's all in the blood on that side and erm so you know i'll go back and see her before christmas for sure
S0302	where do she live in wales
S0302	oh that's not far
S0262	now this be the weird thing right get this so my dad turn up to say hello to and she's he's invite down to to have a
S0302	be this the
S0262	the first few
S0302	the first time he's
S0262	the first time he
S0302	first time
S0262	ever clap eye on her and lo and behold he see one of his old work colleagues through british british aerospace days
S0302	yeah really
S0262	this be the reason why they live in be because marry to my mum's half sister
S0302	oh
S0262	they're both marry to the half sister
S0302	he know he know the
S0262	he do he well he didn't
S0302	the husband
S0262	no no he didn't know that be the husband of he would have know that you know my dad have a er have a wife but he would never have clock because mum would have be
S0302	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	and so they would never have be
S0302	so someone he know be the husband
S0262	my dad yeah be the husband
S0302	oh that be
S0262	but they work together
S0302	amaze oh what do you mean they're not
S0262	in in british aerospace they work together
S0302	oh they work together
S0262	it's like you and me find out that somehow
S0302	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	we've get some kind of connection you know
S0302	oh that's amaze
S0262	oh it be totally i mean if you think about all in the world it could be and it's just
S0302	and but yeah but be you
S0262	fifteen miles down the road
S0302	but be you think do my mum know this
S0262	mm
S0302	would she have know or not
S0262	i haven't get that far actually
S0302	maybe not maybe she just think i don't want anything to do with them and she didn't know
S0262	i can't see how she would have make the link between
S0302	's the husband
S0262	yeah
S0302	of the half sister
S0262	because she would have take his name very be an english surname as well it wouldn't even have clock in my mum's and it wasn't like they be work colleagues that socialise together
S0302	no
S0262	they be
S0302	no obviously they never meet
S0262	they would have never meet so
S0302	no that would have be weird if have they meet
S0262	wow that would have
S0302	and not know
S0262	put the cat amongst the pigeons
S0302	no but they wouldn't necessarily have know that they be relate would they
S0262	no i wonder if they have say where in wales be you from
S0302	well it might have eventually
S0262	and there might
S0302	come out
S0262	there might have be my mum have get and she probably would have get a sixth sense to it too i don't know she be a kind of always like that pick up on small things
S0302	that's what i mean she might have have she ever meet this so i'm marry to a welsh woman she might have go right don't wanna get to know them
S0262	yeah don't
S0302	that's so close
S0262	don't get know them yeah you never know
S0262	bloody half sister
S0302	and it be
S0262	exactly well but you know but i could have really i could have
S0302	oh
S0262	eat my foot because she ask me early on she say and i just tell her about how my mum die and it's very good for me to talk about it with a woman
S0302	yeah
S0262	because you know my brother and my dad
S0302	don't like to talk about it
S0262	they don't really but you know they're they're men you know not the same so anyway i sort of fill her in and er you know i have a narrative about it so i say what i say and then she be say to me oh she say that's very sad she say oh you know how long do it take from when be diagnose with pancreatic cancer and i say well less than a month
S0302	oh be it that
S0262	and she well up
S0302	be it that short
S0262	she well up
S0302	yeah
S0262	and almost i be like oh this be interest for somebody who doesn't know someone maybe she be just on my behalf
S0302	no no no no if it's your half sister if i suddenly discover i have a half sister i would be instantly kind of
S0262	yeah
S0302	connect
S0262	connect to the whole thing but then later after about
S0302	oh so your
S0262	an hour and a half of chat she say to me oh you know she say just to let you know i didn't mean to be erm like this on the on the phone with you when i ask you about something or other and i really didn't know what she be talk about so i just be and then she say and that's the reason why you know i ask you about your mother i'm sorry i didn't mean to be nosy about the cancer that she have and i say and she say because have pancreatic cancer
S0302	mm be that what your mum die of oh
S0262	and they've know since august
S0302	oh
S0262	and he's go to start the chemo
S0302	oh
S0262	but it's already spread
S0302	oh
S0262	like it do with my mum so this be the reason why
S0302	oh dear
S0262	she ask me
S0302	really
S0262	and i sort of say it but i wish i if i'd know i would have say it perhaps in a slightly
S0302	yeah
S0262	less
S0302	mute
