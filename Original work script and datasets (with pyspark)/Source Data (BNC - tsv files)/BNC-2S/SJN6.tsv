S0426	right what's on your mind
S0425	right
S0426	young man
S0425	the issue er that er i'm i'm currently in the process of mark the second years' work
S0426	ah well don't mention any
S0425	well it's all it
S0426	don't mention any name
S0425	no of course not
S0426	that'll be okay
S0425	of course erm it's all so it's all er 's moderate it et cetera er the only thing i be gonna ask be about round up
S0426	yeah
S0425	so for the do it do they have to be the use the grey boundaries
S0426	yes
S0425	right
S0426	now it depend whether all the question be of equal weight be they
S0425	they're fifty fifty yes
S0426	okay that's
S0425	yeah
S0426	how many there be two question
S0425	two question fifty yeah
S0426	alright
S0425	so er er
S0426	you have two options one you could mark each question with the usual forty two forty five
S0425	uhu
S0426	forty eight
S0425	which be er that's
S0426	yeah
S0425	that's
S0426	yeah
S0425	what i have do
S0426	then you add up the two
S0425	yes
S0426	and then okay you you er round up that's the only way to do it really
S0425	right okay yeah
S0426	okay now
S0425	cos that's er so i've get
S0426	but hang on a minute hang on a minute
S0425	right
S0426	that will never produce anything that require round up because it won't be in fraction the only round up happen be when you add things which'll produce a fraction like
S0425	uhu
S0426	forty eight point five go
S0425	yes
S0426	to the forty nine
S0425	right
S0426	you don't
S0425	but
S0426	you do not round up forty nine to fifty
S0425	right but because the department have the the boundaries you know the erm er from the coursework so it's like seventy five sixty eight those
S0426	yeah yeah
S0425	so the the one i've just er calculate so two question sixty eight and seventy five
S0426	right
S0425	add together divide by two bring out seventy one point five
S0426	okay yeah when you have the coursework and the exam that will produce then you do er round up
S0425	yeah
S0426	and that give you
S0425	to seventy five
S0426	yes
S0425	right
S0426	well hang on a minute er say those two number again
S0425	er er seventy five and sixty eight
S0426	okay
S0425	and i think it's seventy one point five i think
S0426	oh seventy one point five
S0425	seventy one
S0426	yes seventy two i think you say
S0425	yeah
S0426	seventy five
S0425	no
S0426	oh yeah yeah yeah that's seventy two no problem
S0425	so it's
S0426	yeah yeah
S0425	so so seventy two
S0426	yeah
S0425	be be
S0426	yeah
S0425	fine
S0426	be what you put down
S0425	it doesn't have to be seventy five you know because of the
S0426	oh i see what you mean
S0425	the do you see what i mean the
S0426	no no no no no no no
S0425	yeah
S0426	no no no
S0425	no just
S0426	no no no no
S0425	just a whole number
S0426	just a whole number whatever that
S0425	right
S0426	whole number whether that whole number exist in our mark scheme or not
S0425	be irrelevant
S0426	be irrelevant
S0425	super right
S0426	alright good
S0425	okay that's
S0426	otherwise yeah you'd be really inflate
S0425	yeah
S0426	the score
S0425	yeah
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0425	no that's what i
S0426	okay
S0425	that's what i er that's what
S0426	that's right
S0425	that be my concern
S0426	yes so
S0425	and wasn't a hundred percent sure so i think oh i know
S0426	hang on what's he be do
S0425	i i i
S0426	these last ten years then
S0426	oh god and i suppose all those
S0425	yeah
S0426	firsts two years ago
S0426	oh my heavens alright good
S0425	so yes
S0426	yes
S0425	okay
S0426	what be you do it on
S0425	well er er
S0426	what be you examine on
S0425	oh well it's er individual differences yeah so
S0426	so our
S0425	yeah
S0426	second year lot
S0425	the second year
S0426	and how be they look
S0425	i'm quite impress actually yeah yeah
S0426	well that's good to hear
S0425	yeah there's erm i mean they're obviously they've tend to go for certain question
S0426	yes
S0425	over
S0426	sure
S0425	over over others and er you know but yeah i i think the sort of er i haven't calculate the mean yet but it's i i would anticipate it's gonna be in the sixties
S0426	blimey
S0425	yeah
S0426	well that's impressive
S0425	yeah
S0426	erm
S0425	no i mean even some of the students that perhaps we wouldn't expect
S0426	well yeah yeah
S0425	to do as well
S0426	yeah
S0425	have have erm yeah
S0426	well i that's very please of course in one i'm look for my distribution of er cog anyway it's largely
S0425	yeah
S0426	in the cs
S0425	right okay
S0426	largely in the cs so you know maybe i've be slightly tougher
S0425	or maybe it's a cos er you know in in i i i have ask er a few of the students you know how how be the exams and stuff and and i think they find the question for the individual differences exam easier so maybe that maybe it's a an issue of question i don't know it's do er i i mean the the question for individual differences be very er they be fairly open
S0426	okay
S0425	so they couldn't really get it wrong if they'd do revision
S0426	if they know the material
S0425	yeah
S0426	okay well that's a fairly generous way of ask question to be sure
S0425	mm
S0426	er have be try to make us er synchronise our style for exams but with pressure of time people
S0425	yeah
S0426	just haven't have the time to do that
S0425	and i think that's not always possible with different cos you you're gonna have different materials
S0426	well
S0425	erm er
S0426	er 's point be you could always ask er you should always ask a question which allow or require sorry not allow require critical
S0425	yes
S0426	analysis
S0425	oh absolutely yeah
S0426	of something
S0425	yeah yeah
S0426	right er because the student otherwise will just simply reproduce as it be what he she know about x
S0425	yes i know
S0426	er now sometimes you can do it by put in that word in the title critically
S0425	yes
S0426	evaluate the contribution of z to
S0425	yes
S0426	you know whatever er but if you don't then it you might well get these fairly voluminous answer er which you might feel oblige to give mark to because the volume be there
S0425	yeah
S0426	but if they don't have the critical analysis
S0425	the that's right now i mean erm there be i that that one of the more popular question be you know critically evaluate
S0426	right
S0425	er
S0426	and do they in fact
S0425	some
S0426	critically evaluate
S0425	and the good students do
S0426	okay
S0425	the
S0426	right
S0425	the er less capable tend to just sort of a give you a a verbatim account of you know well essentially be just the textbook
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0425	er and and er if they do that proficiently with erm some sort of contrast and compare with other then then they be in the bs lower
S0426	alright okay
S0425	if they if they demonstrate extra read erm and the you know it be er they they clearly understand they have a decent structure and stuff like that then they be move up higher that be the sort of
S0426	how high would you go on that kind of
S0425	i don't think i
S0426	material
S0425	i i go any higher than sort of give seventy five
S0426	er how how many seventy fives do you give
S0425	not possibly sort of er three or four perhaps
S0426	okay
S0425	not
S0426	alright
S0425	sort of
S0426	okay yeah
S0425	not a a
S0426	alright
S0425	massive proportion there be quite a few sort of bs b pluses
S0426	okay alright
S0425	but but er but there be also a fair few lower as well i mean some of them be very very poor
S0426	we've say this to each other
S0425	yeah
S0426	before about this particular cohort you know but they be there they do it
S0425	yeah
S0426	they get the mark er and that mark be a i'm sure a pass mark
S0425	yeah
S0426	so good luck to them
S0425	absolutely
S0426	and with the probably inevitably better coursework
S0425	yes yeah well the coursework be a bite more of a mix bag so that's it so i i think i the tendency be perhaps for them to have do slightly better in the exam
S0426	really
S0425	rather than the coursework
S0426	that's extremely unusual
S0425	yeah because the i i think the problem with the coursework be erm they be over ambitious with
S0426	okay
S0425	with the sort of material
S0426	okay
S0425	they be and and so again there be there be some students who do very well and i think the ones who do very well in the coursework probably do less well in the exam
S0426	mm
S0425	but the ones that do less well in the coursework seem to have put maybe it's a case of they think i'd better put some effort in
S0426	well it could be just
S0426	regression to the mean i mean there be
S0425	oh it oh it's yeah
S0426	an element of that of course
S0425	yeah yeah absolutely absolutely yeah
S0426	i mean there be usually a correlation between the two er i er i use to do that sometimes correlate it
S0425	yeah correlate it yeah
S0426	yeah it's
S0425	yeah
S0426	it's pretty high it's not anything like point seven point eight
S0425	no
S0426	it's our old friend the point threes
S0425	yeah
S0426	you know the
S0425	yeah
S0426	about that alright good be that your lot of mark
S0425	er quantitative just finish off that quantitative
S0426	what's that look like
S0425	and and their
S0426	i would imagine that's
S0426	even more vary and more of a
S0425	that be
S0426	spread
S0425	that's that's it's a tricky one because they're they have all do completely different things
S0426	okay
S0425	so but but you know the more capable ones be they've do things like er a test for alpha reliability
S0426	ooh er
S0425	or you know they and so they they've do an alpha reliability test have they do anything with it you know have they look at can they drop et cetera
S0426	yeah yeah
S0425	and you know they've
S0426	yes yes
S0425	some of them have take it and and do
S0426	yeah yeah
S0425	whereas others have just some of them have just do an alpha reliability and say you know here it be
S0425	erm which be good you know which be
S0426	yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
S0425	you which be better than the ones that haven't
S0426	that that
S0425	do it
S0426	haven't do it at all yes
S0425	you know you
S0425	er er and and and
S0426	well i suppose that's true
S0425	and so er
S0426	alright
S0425	you know and then then some people have look at you know their literature review be very substantial
S0426	yeah
S0425	others mm
S0426	no
S0425	not so much and
S0426	not so much
S0425	and er and so it's er
S0425	it's it's
S0426	well you remember cudgel these very same students last year
S0425	yeah
S0426	into write a lab report
S0425	oh
S0426	so you'd kind of
S0425	absolutely
S0426	hope that they'd have get it in the end but
S0425	i
S0426	possibly
S0425	that's right i know i you would think by second year the fundamentals would be there er
S0425	and and mm by and large they be
S0426	oh right well there's
S0425	but
S0426	an achievement from all of us
S0426	isn't it
S0425	but er
S0426	well i suppose to give them some excuse this have be a year not it's not a year it's be six months between since their last lab report
S0425	uhu
S0426	because they've be in do quali in the first semester
S0425	yeah sure yeah yeah
S0426	so okay
S0425	yeah that's
S0426	and they how how many go do they have at do a quantitative report
S0425	it's just the one
S0426	oh well
S0425	i think be yeah
S0426	okay
S0425	yeah yeah just er
S0426	er whereas they do five
S0425	well the
S0426	at the other
S0425	that's right yeah no it's just that's it it's just the one project that
S0426	yeah
S0425	that that be a accumulation of the whole year's
S0426	yeah yeah
S0425	so
S0426	well that's a price we pay for assess less
S0425	yeah
S0426	have less time to assess
S0425	yeah
S0426	and we know that if we well it's an old story isn't it if we ask them to do it just for a practice they just wouldn't do it
S0425	no
S0426	well at least
S0425	that's right
S0426	some of them would
S0425	yeah yes
S0426	but the ones that need it
S0425	the
S0426	wouldn't do it
S0425	yes absolutely absolutely and er and erm but yes so some of them have use the time wisely and produce a piece of work that be reflective of er that be a sorry a reflection of how well er how much time they've have and and how well they sort of understand the principles that they've be teach and then
S0426	there's a contrastive come up next
S0425	there's
S0426	isn't there
S0425	yeah
S0426	whereas
S0426	on the other hand
S0425	whereas the flipside of the coin be kind i mean i've have a number of conversations with students er along the line of erm er oh well be this all we have to do or
S0425	erm what why what have we be do for the rest of the term
S0426	oh please
S0425	and then you say well
S0426	well look
S0425	er
S0426	it's fifty percent
S0426	of your mark
S0425	do do you actually
S0426	it's a substantial piece
S0425	understand that
S0426	yeah right
S0425	you know why do you think we cover alpha reliability why
S0426	yeah
S0425	do you think we cover er
S0426	cos i think you just like it sir
S0425	yeah just for fun
S0426	just for fun
S0425	just just for
S0426	cos we enjoy it so much
S0425	i mean hey that's you know we're get a bite philosophical now maybe
S0426	yeah
S0425	this be what it's all about maybe
S0426	about that's right
S0425	a look but
S0425	but it's er
S0425	er yeah no i'll you know sort of
S0426	yeah
S0425	there's only so much you can say
S0426	okay
S0425	this might be a little bite of the
S0426	yes yes quite
S0425	yeah so
S0426	well they will all have at least i hope all will have get the message that they'll need this oh well that's not true because some of them bail out on method on the premise that they don't like this method they're never gonna use
S0425	uhu
S0426	again in their life
S0425	yes
S0426	and certainly not in their dissertation
S0425	yes
S0426	so they bail out early and then it's difficult
S0425	yeah
S0426	er and all that you hope be that they get enough of a mark just to carry through and it doesn't drag them down when they come to do their third year work
S0425	that's right yeah i think if the ones that want to do a quantitative project i think they've get all the tool
S0426	okay
S0425	to do it
S0426	they should have all the tool
S0425	they they're they
S0426	to do it but
S0425	yeah
S0426	yeah
S0425	i mean whether or not they can er
S0426	well you remember what happen last year when they would knock on the door
S0425	yeah
S0426	at any opportunity er well it seem to us at
S0425	yes
S0426	every opportunity but maybe maybe that we're overestimate on the basis of the vividness of some experience
S0425	mm
S0426	and the majority of those even that do quantitative just get on with it and do it themselves either with their
S0425	sure
S0426	supervisor's help or with
S0425	or with
S0426	maths
S0425	yeah yeah
S0426	er remedial class
S0425	yeah
S0426	or whatever it might be
S0425	that's right yeah
S0426	in the maths centre which be just down the road and it's er i think to their credit some of them use it
S0425	they do yeah yeah absolutely er erm yeah and i think i think the the the overall grade do reflect that so i've be you know last year's
S0426	the difficulty next year be that we're gonna have less members of staff
S0425	mm yeah
S0426	and with one of us go on sabbatical
S0425	uhu
S0426	that mean and depend on who we take on for the
S0425	absolutely
S0426	new appointments
S0425	yeah
S0426	who may be probationers
S0425	yes yeah
S0426	who may not have
S0425	no
S0426	enough
S0425	yeah
S0426	hours in their teach allocation to do dissertations it might be four of us
S0425	yeah
S0426	with sixty
S0425	blimey
S0426	people
S0425	phew wow
S0426	so i'll be
S0425	that's
S0426	send some stuff down to
S0425	so yeah more scrap metal yeah
S0426	yes that you come up with a van
S0426	and load up
S0425	yeah
S0426	with some dissertation proposals
S0425	yeah that's
S0426	and just er
S0425	that's that's how you
S0426	see if you can find a
S0425	yeah
S0426	a buyer
S0425	yeah
S0426	anywhere on on the
S0425	yeah that's
S0426	m69
S0425	that's er well that's i usually can yeah
S0425	er
S0425	er it
S0426	on that score how be you do in term of look around for things
S0425	no it it's it's not er i'm not too er too good at the moment with that kind of thing i mean i guess i i'm not i'm not be that rigorous at search because i'm try to get the thesis finish
S0426	okay
S0425	first
S0426	okay
S0425	you know and then
S0426	that's fair enough
S0425	and and and and
S0426	okay
S0425	you know
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0425	if if something come up and i think oh that that that would suit me
S0426	right
S0425	and then
S0426	yeah
S0425	then i would go for it but
S0426	sure
S0425	the the thesis be the er
S0426	oh that's absolutely right well it must be right
S0425	yeah
S0426	er how could it be otherwise you will be
S0425	once i've get that sort of you know and i've submit and all of those
S0426	and how how close be you be you to submission
S0425	fairly well mm yeah erm i would say in the next couple of months
S0426	good
S0425	it could
S0426	okay
S0425	i i be hop it would be earlier than that
S0426	yeah
S0425	but with take on the teach et cetera that's it have it have push me back
S0426	yeah okay
S0425	but it's but it
S0426	fair enough well if you can use the the holiday er sorry you know not
S0425	yes
S0426	maybe not have a holiday
S0425	yes that's
S0426	and use the summer
S0425	that's my plan
S0426	just to
S0425	just to use the summer just to
S0426	yeah yeah
S0425	to to finish it all off and
S0426	and as i'm sure your supervisor tell you just don't be so perfectionist about it just get it do
S0425	no no i'm i be i'm learn that it's just er it's just get to be good enough
S0426	yeah yeah bullet point er for you should be fine i think
S0425	yeah i've
S0426	yeah
S0425	i've write it all down back of
S0426	yeah
S0425	a fag packet
S0426	that's a much better
S0425	be that yeah
S0426	in fact
S0426	that's right
S0426	perhaps with a with er be those you know network of er you know what be they call the you know i
S0425	the mind map things
S0426	the mind map things
S0425	yeah yeah
S0426	that's right yeah
S0425	yeah
S0426	yeah
S0425	bullet point mind map
S0426	yeah mind map
S0425	and a couple of illustrations as well
S0426	and you could say at the bottom of it sorry run out of time
S0425	sorry run out of ink
S0425	yeah er
S0425	and i i i couldn't i didn't wanna go and buy another pen so
S0426	that's right
S0425	tough
S0425	yeah
S0426	and i'm never gonna use this method again so
S0425	yeah
S0425	all in all in conclusion
S0426	in conclusion er
S0425	can i have a phd please
S0426	have a great deal to say
S0426	can i have a phd yes
S0425	yeah yeah
S0426	well okay excellent
S0425	yeah
S0426	so end of the summer definitely hand it in that's you do
S0425	uhu
S0426	good super
S0425	so yeah right
S0426	we have our er exam board tomorrow so that should be interest
S0425	mm
S0426	but this be for the for the third years
S0425	for the yeah yeah
S0426	and this lot well your lot my lot
S0425	yeah
S0426	will go into next year and then we'll see how that go
S0425	uhu
S0426	with as you know some things hang over some of them that you know
S0425	yeah yeah erm
S0426	we shall see how that resolve itself
S0425	mm it's certainly er a first
S0426	it be
S0425	well er yeah
S0426	extremely unusual
S0425	yeah
S0426	let's hope you know it's a one off
S0425	yeah yeah
S0426	right
S0425	mm mm right well i'm gonna
S0426	good
S0425	i'm gonna er do some maths
S0426	oh yes what fun i'll pass you the appropriate form to fill out
S0425	oh absolutely yeah yeah
S0426	smash thank you
S0425	cheer thank
S0426	bye
