S0486	okay hi good morning thank you
S0534	hi
S0486	thank you for talk to me today
S0534	that's alright oh alright
S0486	erm and you do mention a subject that you might tell me about
S0534	yes i'm gonna tell you about the eighth of january nineteen fifty nine in
S0486	right
S0534	now you may you may not remember it cos you may not be old enough but right after the war finish they introduce national service
S0486	yeah
S0534	this be for young men so many people have come out of the arm force that they be get short after a while
S0486	yeah yeah
S0534	and once you get to eighteen you be conscript into either one of the force or if you be very unlucky into the coalmines
S0486	right
S0534	to do two years' service there well i wasn't eighteen until oh nineteen fifty seven but at that time national service be slow down and they didn't want very many people so in fact they be call us up when we get older and older and i wasn't call up until i be nineteen and a half and the letter arrive in the post say report to the depot of the light infantry in street
S0486	right
S0534	send me a railway warrant so i get on the train at home catch the train to and by this time you could see various other young men look bewilder hang around the railway station and when i be watch them i think perhaps one of the highlight of the day be that a castle class locomotive have just be rename sir edward elgar
S0486	oh right
S0534	and i hadn't see it with its new name plat on
S0486	yeah
S0534	until that day so i can say i saw that on the eighth of january nineteen fifty nine
S0486	yeah
S0534	anyhow us guy begin to recognise one another that we be all in the same boat so we start to make our way through er to get to someone have tell us where it be and er as we approach it there be a sergeant come down the road obviously look for young bewilder men
S0534	and er in the in the british army er the senior ncos wear a red sash mainly over their right shoulder but his guy have his sash over his leave shoulder and that date back to a battle many years ago when a lot of the officer of the light infantry be kill in action because they always wear their sash on the leave shoulder
S0486	oh i see
S0534	and because the ncos take over on that day it be decree that those guy should then wear their sash on the same side as the officer
S0486	right
S0534	again just go off tangent very slightly
S0486	yeah
S0534	erm there be a big colour picture of a senior nco from every infantry regiment in the british army
S0486	yeah
S0534	take outside of buckingham palace they'd go to meet the king
S0486	right
S0534	and the picture wasn't very clear but all these chap line up have their sash over the right shoulder but there be one there and you couldn't see his face over his leave shoulder so
S0486	yeah
S0534	you know he be a
S0486	oh right yeah
S0534	anyhow we walk up through street
S0486	yeah
S0534	and there be the barrack
S0486	keep go yeah
S0534	erm formidable go in get your name separate you there be an intake of eighty young men that day and it be to be the last national service intake for the light infantry and we be divide into two section platoons there be platoon and platoon and those two name come from former general that do their early days
S0486	right
S0534	in the regiment and we be direct to barrack room big victorian red brick barrack room cold they be heat by one open fire at each end and you be give a small amount of coke which be mean to last you for the week but in reality you could burn it in a day
S0486	right
S0534	and we go in we be give some bed and not proper uniform to start with but denims which be enough to carry on with and er so that be the first day we be talk to by this very frighten sergeant that i saw in the street not only do he have a red sash he have a very red face and frighten face and to further diminish his appearance in the eye of the poor chap
S0486	yeah
S0534	have a cross eye
S0486	oh dear
S0534	so
S0486	not good for fire then
S0534	he he well he er
S0534	he be alright actually
S0486	yeah
S0534	perhaps he close his bad eye
S0486	yeah
S0534	but er but anyhow the next day we be take for get the uniform issue to us and er the quartermaster be a chap call major who be very proud to say smoke his pipe so he be quite casual i be here like you thirty six years ago and he'd go all the way up through and he have a wonderful eye and he could say look at people and say size that size that
S0486	mm
S0534	and all the way through and this thing be issue
S0486	oh right
S0534	and then it come to greatcoats and you be tell to put on a greatcoat and er he say when i look at you don't look down because if you look forward your coat will droop in the front
S0486	oh right yeah
S0534	so of course he get to me and the first thing i do be look down
S0486	yeah
S0534	so he say to me don't look down there's bugger all there and that be his
S0534	that be his expression but erm again towards that end of the first week the army be very crafty they decide you should have all your injections on a friday because some of them be very painful
S0486	yeah
S0534	and they want to give you the saturday and sunday in your own time to get over them
S0486	gosh
S0534	so one of them be er what they call a tab injection
S0486	yeah
S0534	you probably know this
S0486	erm well
S0534	it's a mixture of er typhus
S0486	everything
S0534	or everything together
S0486	mm
S0534	and it's extremely painful
S0486	yeah
S0534	and i remember a big red mark come up on my arm and it be a very sharp boundary to this red mark and ordinary
S0486	yeah
S0534	flesh if you touch the red oh
S0486	mm
S0534	but you'd go at half an inch the other way and it be normal
S0486	yeah yeah
S0534	anyhow we be all take off to what be camp in those days
S0486	oh right
S0534	and er because that's where the medical officer be
S0486	right
S0534	and give all these injections in fact the medical officer be a retire colonel from the royal army medical corps

S0486	yeah
S0534	and er he sit there in his woolly cardigan
S0486	mm
S0534	and you know he's oh you know sort of thing

S0486	yes
S0534	erm and to get you up from bed of course they blow reveille on bugle
S0486	yes
S0534	and i often use to think about the people who live in ordinary house in street

S0486	right
S0534	we'd all go crash down through street but nobody could have get any sleep there but i'm sure they be quite use to it
S0486	er weren't they very slippery on the tarmac as well
S0534	no

S0534	and er he just say oh excuse boot for two or three days
S0486	oh right

S0486	no
S0534	climb a rope
S0486	no no
S0534	so they decide that i should go off to camp in the middle of all this
S0486	right
S0534	on a on a pt development course
S0486	oh lord yeah
S0534	and it be fun it be er a most odd lot of people there that you ever meet

S0534	because at the end of four weeks
S0486	mm
S0534	i i could climb a rope like a bloody monkey
S0486	really
S0534	and i could throw myself i use
S0486	gosh
S0534	oh yes it be it be hard you start off the day with the run a mile
S0486	oh
S0534	and then er you would do what they call corrective pt
S0486	right
S0534	now in the erm gymnasium there be the wall bar
S0486	yeah
S0534	and you would strap your ankles under the bar
S0486	right
S0534	and heave up on that and
S0486	right
S0534	down with your hand and weightlift it be pretty hard work and then later in the day you'd run a marathon do a short marathon three miles or so
S0486	yeah yeah
S0534	and er then perhaps play a game of hockey or something so it be er
S0486	right
S0534	but on top of this the army decide that you have to be feed up
S0486	right
S0534	i i don't like milk so you get a pint of

S0486	right
S0534	and the intelligence corps never take national servicemen directly from
S0486	right
S0534	whatever school or whatever it be but they pick the ones they want from other regiment

S0486	mm
S0534	because we're all wear different regimental badge
S0486	mm
S0534	from all over the place and we start then what would turn out to be about six months of so train and i be earmark to go to cyprus
S0486	mm
S0534	but then fortunately before i go the cyprus emergency be over
S0486	right
S0534	so i never get there so er the towards the end of nineteen fifty nine they be wonder what to do with all these people
S0486	uhu
S0534	that they train up
S0486	yeah yeah
S0534	so they start a new strategic reserve in the army which be a series of brigade that be on short notice call in case there be emergency anywhere
