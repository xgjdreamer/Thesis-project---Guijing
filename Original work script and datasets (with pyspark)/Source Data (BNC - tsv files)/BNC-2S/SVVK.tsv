S0320	so one of my issue with clil be the division of teachers and the division of work because
S0322	mm
S0320	erm ideally you'd have efl teachers who be also subject teachers or you would train subject teachers
S0322	to
S0320	be efl teachers
S0322	which would probably be the easier way wouldn't it
S0320	exactly but then they're do someone out of a job but accord to him that wasn't that's not the way forward obviously cos his company's call
S0322	yeah
S0320	who run clil course
S0322	yeah when i live in bali erm quite a a few people be get job in international school when they weren't the subject teacher
S0320	oh
S0322	er but they would have to teach for example biology
S0320	mm yeah
S0322	and that's quite daunt to have to properly teach
S0320	i can imagine
S0322	a subject
S0320	really bore as well by the sound of it
S0322	yeah well you do i think you just really want to know what you're do but then again if you think of that cover class and she's just give material and just go and then
S0320	yeah that's true actually
S0322	these days a lot of it be but for that kind of like the example he show
S0320	mm
S0322	you'd need to know your subject
S0320	but you wouldn't the example he show
S0322	but couldn't you just
S0320	be about a record programme you could just learn that that would be easy
S0322	you could be everything you teach them you'd have to learn first and it's quite hard work
S0320	mm yeah that's true
S0322	to have to each yourself before you teach them
S0320	mm
S0322	erm
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	i mean the most logical thing would be to actually use the subject teachers
S0320	mm
S0322	and just teach them how to tefl tefl it up
S0320	yeah but quite a lot of them don't like it i think be one of the problems that they be face anyway cos he have a few
S0322	mm
S0320	like survey that they'd do and the result and stuff like that so one of the ones be be subject teachers don't think efl teachers be proper teachers
S0322	mm
S0320	and that they stand in front of the class and explain everything whereas they don't elicit things it be it be interest
S0322	mm
S0320	and i think it will probably have a place in a classroom but i don't think in an adult private language school you could use it as the sole
S0322	no
S0320	method
S0322	no because
S0320	i mean you can't use anything as a sole method can you
S0322	if i be set work for the thing though but as i be say if you've get say a token intermediate class
S0320	mm
S0322	and you've get a fifty five year old businessman
S0320	yeah
S0322	i couple of teenage i don't know
S0320	mm
S0322	well teenage but sort of seventeen eighteen and you've get i don't know a couple of guy from
S0320	very mix
S0322	saudi arabia
S0320	students yeah
S0322	that be head towards
S0320	yeah
S0322	and you've get to find a topic
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	that they all want to invest that much
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	effort into when you've get the
S0320	and that they don't
S0322	kind of attitude of i've come to improve my grammar
S0320	and that they don't
S0322	or i've come to
S0320	already know
S0320	that's the thing with adults isn't it with kid
S0322	it would have to be quite in depth wouldn't it
S0320	it's a bite more predictable wouldn't it
S0322	yeah
S0320	so you would have an idea with kid from the curriculum that they've already set it for the first five years of their school or ten years you'd have a really clear idea of what
S0322	yeah
S0320	they will have be expose
S0322	yeah
S0320	to whereas adults you wouldn't would you but that's a good
S0322	but the idea of just use more interest material or use stuff that you
S0320	yeah
S0322	would learn cos that's quite excite i find
S0320	mm
S0322	when i do something in class which be
S0320	yeah
S0322	real
S0320	yeah exactly
S0322	and you go oh i didn't know that or use a piece of like a piece of literature or
S0320	mm
S0322	i mean a lot those those erm global book and things like that
S0320	mm
S0322	where you've get they seem to be more where you've get a really interest topic
S0320	mm
S0322	with some interest information
S0320	this be
S0322	and then discuss it
S0320	this be this clil book that i saw at at but it be it some of the it look like it be design for a sixth form so some of the
S0322	mm
S0320	topics include erm what's your future job do you want to work in a marijuana farm in canada erm eminem modern day poet or blah
S0322	mm
S0320	blasphemous blah blah
S0322	mm oh well i
S0320	blah blah blah
S0322	i think i i remember look at a book which be very very
S0320	very up to date
S0322	yo yo we're
S0320	but really interest
S0322	i don't remember
S0320	word really up to date word so you know you be say for the
S0322	mm
S0320	advance those that word book which be great the vocabulary book
S0322	mm
S0320	where all of the word be so far out of date
S0322	mm
S0320	that it just feel a bite silly use it but yeah it be interest i like the idea but my biggest issue i think i write some note actually i wonder where erm i write them my biggest issue i think be what happen to the teachers basically and one of my other question which keep come up again and again and again oh no that's not relevant actually so one of the things he do be he give us this list of ways to represent information that state school teachers use all the time
S0322	uhu
S0320	and ask us to try and work out what what each of them be erm this be my favourite so this be this be a tree diagram this be my version of the tree diagram
S0322	yeah
S0320	the trunk be shop and
S0322	okay yeah yeah
S0320	you've get people and job
S0322	yeah
S0320	and then you've get money et cetera
S0322	yeah
S0320	that's what an actual tree diagram
S0322	oh it's a
S0320	look like
S0322	it's a family tree
S0320	it's really bore
S0322	yeah
S0320	i much prefer mine
S0322	yeah i do
S0322	i like yours
S0320	i know i think i like it too
S0322	it be quite
S0320	yeah
S0320	oh the other thing he say he doesn't use he say he doesn't use a correction code anymore he use an improvement code in write
S0322	okay
S0320	which i think be interest
S0322	what's the difference
S0320	well correction yeah you know come on correction improvement
S0322	i know but what er you know practicality what's the difference
S0320	no there isn't actually any difference
S0322	okay you just call it a different name
S0320	yeah exactly
S0322	mm
S0320	erm
S0322	i'm a bite bore of things like that where you just go
S0322	hey but i call it this
S0322	there's a slight difference in my attitude towards it
S0322	if i call it something different so it's the same bloody thing though isn't it
S0320	yeah erm yeah yeah it be interest
S0322	oh you take a lot of note
S0320	oh that well
S0322	be that a swim pool
S0320	but look that's all
S0322	with a man parachute into it
S0320	yes
S0322	be that what it be
S0320	no no it's not look this be 's link
S0322	oh that be the swamp of
S0320	look it's
S0322	bubble up
S0320	stuff
S0322	stuff bubble up
S0320	bubble stuff good isn't it
S0322	yeah
S0320	i quite like my illustration
S0322	yeah
S0320	i think it be good
S0322	interest that this while top down bottom up seem to be use in lot of different ways
S0320	i felt like he wasn't say anything new
S0322	he he didn't really say anything i like it though
S0320	yeah
S0322	i could have listen to it for age
S0320	he's a very good speaker
S0322	and i find it very entertain and i didn't feel like he really say anything
S0320	yeah he's a very good speaker but
S0322	he seem to say
S0320	i've hear it all before
S0322	a few thing but nothing really
S0320	no i think i've i've i've hear the
S0322	and things didn't seem to be connect
S0320	automaticity before i've hear er we do that in the delta
S0322	well i don't understand what be new about the idea that you're
S0320	there isn't anything new
S0322	think about things and then one minute he be say the
S0320	i think he'd just read a book and talk about it in a slightly different way
S0322	mm the bubble up
S0320	i think that's what it be
S0322	thing
S0320	yeah
S0322	one minute he be say if you're do something else you can get some moments of epiphany
S0320	but it have to be complete concentrate
S0322	but he wasn't concentrate that's the point he be on the beach talk to his wife when he suddenly have this breakthrough he wasn't concentrate on the topic
S0320	i don't think it's as though you have to have constant you have to
S0322	that's what he say later which didn't seem connect at all
S0320	no it didn't he didn't he's say maybe i misunderstand him as i say i be quite tire by then
S0322	mm
S0320	erm didn't he say that you have to have moments of concentrate work on the
S0322	in order to that that
S0320	in order to get that bubble
S0322	stuff bubble up in the first place
S0320	in the first place but then
S0322	yeah
S0320	the sudden epiphany doesn't have to be
S0322	yeah
S0320	while you're concentrate
S0322	no
S0320	cos you concentrate
S0322	because that's
S0320	and then get it down into the
S0322	make that into yeah it's i didn't understand how that be anything to be honest i think
S0320	my my favourite comment
S0322	well yes of course you have to concentrate
S0320	my favourite
S0322	when you're learn something
S0320	my favourite comment be well obviously you can only have an epiphany if you actually know something
S0322	yeah
S0320	if you don't know anything
S0322	there be quite a things
S0320	you can't have the epiphany
S0322	which be kind of mm
S0320	it make me laugh
S0322	yeah it be very entertain and it's
S0320	yes
S0322	nice it be just it be a pleasant thing to listen to at the end of the day
S0320	he's a good speaker yeah
S0322	unlike the fella in london when
S0320	oh what be it
S0322	it be just kill people off the room be just empty
S0320	who be it
S0322	minute by minute it be about erm what be they call
S0320	mm mm
S0322	you know yes you do when the teachers
S0320	the action research
S0322	yeah that kind of thing
S0320	oh
S0322	action research and the other thing be call something about support erm oh when teachers just want to want to find out about something it's like a mini version of action research and they don't have to do all the
S0320	oh
S0322	they do the sort of experimental things to say
S0320	mm
S0322	i'm gonna look at what happen if you do this
S0320	okay
S0322	or another way of do this
S0320	mm
S0322	and then they keep try things and the school kind of just support them with i dunno and then they share their
S0320	oh okay
S0322	what they find out and one of them be an example of this woman who try to use she say when she ask concept question she wasn't sure because you get a general kind of yes or no from the class cos it's just kind of shout out
S0320	yeah
S0322	she say you can't be sure if everybody have understand when you ask a concept question
S0320	no
S0322	so she want to experiment with use mini whiteboards
S0320	oh
S0322	so that she'd ask a concept question and they'd all write and hold up and i
S0320	they mean whiteboards rather than tablets really
S0322	yes
S0322	this may have be a while ago
S0320	okay yeah
S0322	maybe
S0320	maybe not yeah
S0322	but then tablets really for the whole
S0320	i know
S0322	school
S0320	but a mini whiteboard
S0322	yeah that's what it be
S0322	but then she sort of try various initial little snippets and she find that that it be actually they find it a bite laborious and long wind if every single
S0320	mm
S0322	question you get them actually i think they be do it in pair where they have to say what the answer be and if it's just a quick snappy
S0320	yeah
S0322	it turn into a long wind you know
S0320	mm
S0322	and everybody hold them up and
S0320	everyone read everyone else's
S0322	yeah but then she discover through that that she probably ask too many just a yes or no concept question
S0320	yeah okay
S0322	and something like that so i don't know
S0320	yeah
S0322	but so she kind of say this be what i want to look at
S0320	oh okay
S0322	and do a little mini projecty thing on there then
S0320	what do they say about action research then
S0322	oh i can't remember this be the thing it be at the end of the day and
S0320	yeah
S0322	it be something with quite a lot of kind of facts and figure and examples
S0320	okay
S0322	and things that be just not
S0320	not very interest
S0322	no
S0320	erm do they say
S0322	they have people there who win stuff they sort of have a little competition there cos some of the sessions
S0320	what at the end of the day
S0322	there be people give their action research result i go to one of them
S0320	oh yes you do didn't you
S0322	yeah i go to oh well one of them be two actually cos each one be
S0320	yes yeah
S0322	divide into two go to the other ones er and it be a bite er it be all all a bite kind of
S0320	so i've be to an ia tefl i go to a one that be a she be present her master's research paper so dull
S0322	yeah this one i mean i saw one i remember it be something about erm
S0320	maybe that's why they're do it cos they want to be more like ia tefl anyway carry on
S0322	yeah what be she talk about erm oh yeah it be the short term
S0320	oh
S0322	short term learners' goals
S0320	oh yes
S0322	reach their goals
S0320	mm
S0322	help them to assess their it be kind of help er try to help them assess their
S0320	their goals
S0322	but as point out all this research be not very useful because the subject there's about i dunno eighteen people
S0320	okay
S0322	in the whole experiment and you can't really draw many conclusions from so few people because the variability in those people
S0320	so you need a bigger sample size
S0322	you can't get any big trend sort of
S0320	so what would you need to do it over a longer period
S0322	you'd need to do it a lot more to to be able to because all the result be so wishy washy as well it be like mm there's a ever so tiny slight increase in this when this happen
S0320	mm
S0322	but that mean one person
S0320	oh
S0322	or something so and they be different people they they do two wave
S0320	oh
S0322	in one wave they'd do it one way so that be like eight people eight
S0320	right
S0322	students
S0320	yeah
S0322	and the second wave of the experiment
S0320	yeah
S0322	would be eight other people
S0320	right
S0322	so you can't draw anything from that because they could just be completely different people they have to erm try and sort of assess their own
S0320	goals
S0322	progress
S0320	yeah
S0322	the progress that they make in that and that's a very personal thing as well
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	how much you think you have
S0320	yeah
S0322	but to help them to her idea be that if you can help them to identify their goals much more clearly at the begin
S0320	mm
S0322	then they will be able to when it come to assess their progress when they leave
S0320	measure it better
S0322	because they're more aware in the first place of exactly what they're do and what they want
S0320	i don't know if i agree with that though because often the goals that they set themselves be so wildly unrealistic
S0322	mm yeah but that's why basically it come down to
S0320	so essentially you're gonna have to tell them what their goals be
S0322	it basically it come down to talk to them a lot more in depth
S0320	yeah
S0322	about what they want how they want to do it how they think it's go to
S0320	mm
S0322	happen
S0320	mm
S0322	rather than just get them on a piece of paper to say
S0320	mm
S0322	if the second one be talk through it in detail exactly what well you know it say you need vocabulary what kind of vocabulary you say you need to speak in what kind of situations what kind of things do you want to say
S0320	surely then that's the way that you conduct your research surely you would have to make a better if you want to do it through questionnaires you have to make a better questionnaire surely cos i presumably they would
S0322	well why don't you you just can't conclude anything from
S0320	i suppose it yeah
S0322	and it be kind of the same with the other one the second one be something to do with oh it be oh it be oh erm the digital learn platform
S0320	oh yeah
S0322	type thing it be to do with people sort of make blog
S0320	okay
S0322	kind of blog
S0320	yeah
S0322	of their or make sort of websitey things for themselves
S0320	okay
S0322	a lot be aim towards people who be go to university
S0320	mm
S0322	and things like and continue it
S0320	mm
S0322	in the future and erm so once a week
S0320	mm
S0322	their i think it be every lesson i think it be once a week there would be a session once a week there be a whole session on it and then i think maybe every morning the first part they talk through what they do
S0320	okay
S0322	and they'd have to do bits of homework on it and keep you know write record all their homeworky things they do on this
S0320	on a vle
S0322	on yeah maybe
S0320	the vle the virtual learn environment mm
S0322	okay maybe
S0322	maybe it be that
S0320	er they use it a lot in universities
S0322	it seem like a sort of yes cos he be say that you could carry on and use the my issue again with things like you've get somebody come for a week
S0320	yeah
S0322	you've get somebody come who a week who be not go to get
S0320	oh well these be all long term students aren't they
S0322	i think it be the same
S0320	who must be on like
S0322	i think it's the same like we've get this great idea
S0320	pre sessional course
S0322	the people that you'd have for a year so oh it be just about things straight away that aren't relevant to me
S0320	mm yeah fair enough so the other thing that get me as well do you notice that
S0322	what's that
S0320	in it's get a in it
S0322	mm
S0320	erm in the open plenary with the businessman erm that
S0322	yeah that we like
S0320	yeah
S0322	mm
S0320	i like him i'm sure he say that erm the uk have fifty percent of the market share for english language learn in europe
S0322	yeah i think he might have do the
S0320	i don't know where i write it down somewhere it's
S0322	mm
S0320	i write fifty percent so why on earth don't the publishers make anything for the british market if it's fifty percent of the market share
S0322	well basic english i can't i can't understand why there be no there's no solution to roll enrolment
S0320	well it's not
S0322	book
S0320	what the exactly my point cos
S0322	mm
S0320	i've always have the impression that the uk market be a very small part of the market therefore it's not worth their while to produce book for roll enrolment
S0322	mm
S0320	but if you're look at english uk school
S0322	or be he just talk about fifty percent of outside
S0320	i don't know
S0322	it's people go
S0320	to be honest
S0322	abroad
S0320	i miss it
S0322	it could it could be if people be go out of their country so then that leave
S0320	oh
S0322	america australia new zealand
S0320	to be honest i miss the context all i get be the fifty percent
S0322	i think it might have mean that
S0320	oh
S0322	she want
S0320	oh
S0322	to go abroad to study
S0320	oh that'll be why then
S0322	mm
S0320	cos it's very frustrate erm i like him i think he be really good
S0322	i find out about the tier four thing
S0320	oh yeah
S0322	when i say who be tier four route i mean which students be tier but i didn't think it be
S0320	i didn't
S0322	the name of someone
S0320	i didn't see i didn't see the who
S0320	i think it say what be tier four and i be like what
S0322	what's the type if no erm cos i be really confuse because this be a major issue
S0320	uhu
S0322	when i be at
S0320	uhu
S0322	and also in around that time
S0320	uhu uhu
S0322	everybody be go around all the time say tier four tier four tier four students
S0320	uhu
S0322	and attendance tier four
S0320	mm
S0322	critical blah blah
S0320	uhu
S0322	now it's not an issue at all and how be that
S0320	it's because it be a temporary measure the tier four
S0322	no tier four still exist but
S0320	but it be a
S0322	they didn't have apparently you only need a tier four visa if it's over eleven months
S0320	yeah
S0322	which people use to still get them before but now they've realise well just don't come for eleven months at one time
S0320	yeah
S0322	and you don't need to bother with a tier four visa so that's
S0320	well i suppose
S0322	why most of our erm arabic students
S0320	well the language students
S0322	come for eleven ten months
S0320	the language students don't though it's more the university students who have get a three year course
S0322	and they wait until well that's the thing now people be not try to get a three or four year visa
S0320	yeah
S0322	now
S0320	i suppose
S0322	this be why it's not
S0320	yeah
S0322	an issue for us they're not try
S0320	yeah
S0322	to get the whole thing now
S0320	yeah
S0322	they do this whole i'll come until i've get the score i need
S0320	yeah of course then go home and then apply then
S0322	so the come for a certain amount of time and then they extend or get another
S0320	and but even
S0322	cos visitors' visa they can get which i know the tier four one where they have to really prove the
S0320	but there's they because of this problem they introduce this temporary type visa which be
S0322	mm
S0320	something like a long term student visa
S0322	mm
S0320	and have they still get that then
S0322	it seem to be yeah
S0320	but that be only suppose to be temporary cos they mm realise that they've mess up with the tier four problem
S0322	i don't know i mean it's a good thing because i know in the past it be like
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm and they have to be get something like eighty five percent attendance or something and or it be an issue which need
S0320	oh be that not the case anymore
S0322	we the only reason that we take attendance
S0320	oh be that why their attendance be so awful
S0322	yeah now
S0320	ah
S0322	i've have students whose attendance be about fifty percent
S0320	because it use go to the embassy because they be tier oh
S0322	uhu so now we've get this thing call the group
S0320	mm
S0322	erm where we have the
S0320	yeah i know all them
S0322	special register for them
S0320	mm
S0322	but it doesn't do anything
S0320	no it doesn't do it
S0322	cos i just write absent absent absent absent
S0320	yeah the same
S0322	and you look at it it's all as
S0320	yeah
S0322	and nothing happen and you're like well it's just a waste of my time really
S0320	yeah definitely
S0322	be in
S0320	erm yeah so
S0322	mm
S0320	erm tell me about the manage difficult people
S0322	well i know it would be i mean a bite frustrate
S0320	yeah
S0322	it be a guy
S0320	yes
S0322	who we have go to see
S0320	that's partly why i didn't go because i be like well i've already see him i might just leave it
S0322	yeah no i like him in the advance thing but not really in you know
S0320	oh really
S0322	mm it be erm his basic point be talk about what he be say basically be kind of standardisation
S0320	okay
S0322	be the key he be say that erm you have to have a school need to have well a house style
S0320	okay
S0322	that that be his thing
S0320	okay
S0322	a house style that erm like a a brand he be say you know all language school kind of say we're a friendly team we do this we do this and it all kind of mean nothing because everybody say it
S0322	and he be say like to avoid have erm you know the complaints of like i don't like my teacher i want to change class because the teacher in the other one be better and things like this and i'm not learn anything in this class he be kind of just say you need more standardisation you need more minimum requirements that
S0320	okay
S0322	all the teachers be tell
S0320	okay
S0322	so that you know that every teacher do these certain things even if they vary in other ways
S0320	so as in classroom practice
S0322	that you can guarantee yeah
S0320	okay
S0322	that you can guarantee that no matter which teacher they have certain things will be do in the same way
S0320	mm
S0322	for example erm his main thing so teamwork be about behaviour as well as attitude what they actually do
S0320	okay
S0322	erm
S0320	oh what so the practicalities
S0322	yes what i love well what he be talk about mainly he give the example of now he work in a university
S0320	yeah
S0322	again it's different
S0320	it be different
S0322	they're long term students all
S0320	yeah
S0322	with the same kind of blah di blah
S0320	yeah
S0322	but he say one thing they do be a board policy so
S0320	okay
S0322	every every teacher
S0320	yeah
S0322	must have on the board state aim at the top
S0320	okay
S0322	he say oh my god can you imagine have a class without state aim i mean everybody that's get to be a bare minimum hasn't it and i think where where do you where do you teach erm so you'd have state aim on the top
S0320	worry that he's on the he's a lecturer on the ma tefl course eh
S0322	and he be say you know er can you imagine not have them
S0320	yes very easily
S0322	especially when we've get
S0320	cos there's very
S0322	and
S0320	very good reason
S0322	so then he say that erm and one side of the board be the dedicate side for vocabulary
S0320	okay
S0322	so every teacher write the vocabulary on that side must be in phrase not single word
S0320	okay
S0322	erm and there must be
S0320	on which side do you say leave
S0322	on the
S0320	right
S0322	right i think
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm
S0320	it would be weird if it be on the leave wouldn't it
S0322	yeah i don't do that i can just
S0320	i actually
S0322	i use to do it
S0320	i use to actually now i think about it i do it on the leave all over the summer
S0322	oh
S0320	but i'm really inconsistent i
S0322	mm
S0320	rub it out
S0322	i'm terrible at the moment
S0320	because i don't have enough space and i forget about it
S0322	and then somebody say he talk through all this thing and somebody say can i ask erm do you have iwps
S0320	yeah
S0322	cos that change things a bite
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm they must be in phrase and he say
S0320	yeah
S0322	there there must be minimum
S0320	ten
S0322	ten
S0320	okay
S0322	actually ten he say ten
S0320	yeah okay
S0322	erm so that
S0320	do you think he's just pluck that
S0322	mm
S0320	number out of thin air though
S0322	well they agree it together you see they negotiate
S0320	ah okay
S0322	the team beforehand
S0320	ah interest
S0322	what need to be include and what
S0320	mm
S0322	they would all agree to so so that and he say as soon as they implement this the request to change teachers stop completely
S0320	right
S0322	he say because as soon as somebody come to you and say i'm not learn anything in this class you say do you have your ten phrase
S0320	yeah
S0322	and then yes so you've learn ten things at least
S0320	right interest argument
S0320	actually
S0322	yeah cos i think that be a bite naff cos what if you already know those ten phrase then you haven't learn anything
S0320	but it's quite good from the point of view of the do actually cos you often know that people want to change teachers
S0322	mm
S0320	because of a personality clash
S0322	and he be say
S0320	and use the
S0322	yeah
S0320	example my teacher's not good enough as an excuse
S0322	well that's exactly what he be say
S0320	so it's a really good way to
S0322	well that's exactly what he be say
S0320	protect your teachers
S0322	well look i know that this happen in your class
S0320	yeah
S0322	but that's what he be say every school should be able to do be say
S0320	yeah
S0322	i know
S0320	yeah yeah
S0322	that these basic things happen in
S0320	yeah
S0322	every class we have
S0320	mm
S0322	which be true you know when you think about it
S0320	yeah
S0322	you do need to take responsibility with what's you can't just say
S0320	this be true
S0322	it's nice work at the school because they don't interfere too much
S0320	mm
S0322	but you can't just say i have no idea what's go on in the class
S0320	yeah
S0322	so he be say and this way you can guarantee
S0320	okay yeah
S0322	and you can say to students there's a minimum guarantee that this be
S0320	however
S0322	this will happen in every class
S0320	but the school have just get an outstanding for their teach
S0322	yeah
S0320	so there's get to be lot of good things go on and there's get to be
S0322	well that's what i never get to raise with him
S0320	this be
S0322	what i
S0320	yeah
S0322	be go to say he be talk about certain teachers who won't do this and will do this and blah blah
S0322	and i say i say if teachers be very popular
S0320	yeah
S0322	and they teach well
S0320	uhu
S0322	would a school really want to get rid of them in order to get teachers who will do things the way that you
S0320	mm that's quite extreme isn't it
S0322	want to
S0320	mm
S0322	cos he be basically say in a kind of you know this would cos either they're gonna do it
S0320	yeah or you're gonna get rid of them
S0322	well if they're not gonna do it then
S0320	oh wow
S0322	but he didn't say that but you know you'd have to if you need this
S0320	interest
S0322	wouldn't you and he say erm he mention this something about the charismatic teacher he say every school have one you know the charismatic teacher
S0320	the one who play the bloody guitar
S0322	the one that all the students love but the one he say the one that whenever you're talk about students and problems with class they say well he never do that with me they never do that with me
S0320	oh i know who the teacher be
S0322	he say what do he say the charismatic teacher
S0320	she wasn't in there be she
S0322	be a team breaker
S0320	yeah she be
S0322	yeah
S0320	i completely agree
S0322	that be a team breaker
S0320	yeah
S0322	because you can't teach it they say they do this magical thing
S0320	yeah
S0322	that nobody exactly know
S0320	i
S0322	how they do
S0320	yeah i
S0322	they won't follow any rule cos they'll say well why should i change what i do what i do be great
S0320	erm i think there be more than one team breaker at the school
S0322	i just yes
S0320	i can pinpoint two
S0322	yeah
S0320	oh that's bad isn't it
S0322	well it use to be more than that to be honest
S0320	do there
S0322	mm i think another one who be a fantastic teacher but
S0320	the one who go to saudi
S0322	yeah
S0320	but he wouldn't go on do he always use to go on about oh they're they're not like that for me they're great in my class
S0322	no he didn't actually
S0320	no
S0322	he complain about them
S0320	yeah exactly
S0320	it's the oh well they're just wonderful in my class
S0322	yeah
S0320	i don't know
S0322	yeah
S0320	what your problem be
S0322	i know
S0320	drive me round the bend
S0322	he say it's very disruptive to teamwork
S0320	i completely agree
S0322	mm
S0320	oh that's really interest
S0322	mm
S0320	oh okay
S0322	erm
S0320	mm
S0322	and the other ones
S0320	i'm gonna make some note on this i like this
S0322	who be gonna be most resistant to erm to to cos that's where i get the idea that he be say basically you don't want them if you're gonna make a team
S0320	that's really interest
S0322	mm and that's where i want to say
S0320	he'd be lucky to have the choice though
S0322	that's where i want to say i don't know about all your school but or i be gonna say in a certain school cos i be in a room with doss so i we know
S0320	you can't say it then
S0322	which so i be go to say i think in some school
S0320	mm
S0322	the choice between do these things implement these things to create a team
S0320	mm
S0322	when they've end up with the teachers that they've keep because those teachers be get consistently good feedback
S0320	mm mm
S0322	be they go to gamble
S0320	yeah
S0322	lose that an annoy those teachers and lose them
S0320	yeah
S0322	not just get rid of them but
S0320	yeah
S0322	them leave
S0320	yeah yeah
S0322	in order to create this team that you think you need
S0320	well go with manage change erm my old school when it be take over i would have think they'd leave because they all hate it and still
S0322	yeah
S0320	hate it and have have all of these change completely thrust upon them which they be suppose to follow i think they subvert everything
S0322	mm
S0320	and don't follow things
S0322	mm
S0320	but not one of them have leave
S0322	yeah
S0320	so i don't know if they
S0322	yeah
S0320	would actually leave you know
S0322	well no they wouldn't
S0320	i don't because i don't
S0322	because they already complain about the job so much
S0322	even when they're not tell to do anything
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	so they just carry on complain you know
S0322	but nobody's really get the courage
S0320	okay
S0322	to erm to do it and i think yeah i can't imagine i mean get in a flack just from anything he say and do
S0320	uhu
S0322	from certain people and
S0320	okay
S0322	and it would be really hard work but you do think it be kind of the responsibility
S0320	do you know what
S0322	of the school and there should be certain things that we all
S0320	do you know what
S0320	one of the things that come up bear in mind it be a very minor thing one of the things that come up on our last inspection when they go round one of our school be that there be quite a lot of inconsistent board work
S0322	uhu
S0320	it be only a minor thing though and it wasn't
S0322	mm
S0320	it wasn't like it be the the decide factor between an excellent team of teachers
S0322	mm
S0320	which they really weren't
S0322	my board work be horrendous
S0320	but i think i might erm make it a policy in some school actually
S0322	i think it's really good i think
S0320	i really like not overly standardise but this i like
S0322	for new teachers i mean he be also talk about whether you use erm script and
S0320	okay
S0322	how much you use it if you're gonna use it
S0320	okay
S0322	somewhere like
S0320	as a policy
S0322	university you probably would
S0320	yeah okay
S0322	but that's tricky and it's definitely tricky if you're gonna have new teachers
S0320	yeah
S0322	come in certain time
S0320	do he say anything else about board work then he have the standard ten vocabulary phrase
S0322	yeah he have the there be something else hang on aim at the top vocabulary on the side
S0320	oh right aim at the top
S0322	in phrase er must be minimum ten phrase
S0320	how many aim do he say
S0322	could be more
S0320	okay how many aim
S0322	so that students mm he didn't say just aim at the top
S0320	oh okay
S0322	you put put the aim of the lesson so the students can't say they're not learn from a certain teacher because everybody do this
S0320	yeah
S0322	what he say that be interest be that erm when the teachers be grumble about it or things where you've get this thing that some maybe don't want to join it he say it will police itself because the students will demand it
S0320	yeah
S0322	if the students know that's what they should get they'll say to their teacher
S0320	yeah
S0322	but where be the end phrase
S0320	mm
S0322	or but where's the aim
S0320	actually now i think about it i think the one of doss that i work with might have try might have implement one of something
S0322	yeah
S0320	like this before
S0322	but i think it be quite interest when he be say that the students if they know
S0320	yeah
S0322	they should get that
S0320	yeah of course
S0322	probably would
S0320	yeah
S0322	make sure erm yes he also say the same colour for certain things
S0320	ah
S0322	all use the same colour for mark certain things like this colour for mark phonology for this colour
S0320	mm
S0322	for mark what erm i don't know maybe word type it be or something
S0320	oh that's interest
S0322	yeah
S0320	mm
S0322	but then of course you've get to have time to have the train to standardise this stuff
S0320	yeah
S0322	haven't you
S0320	for word you haven't i'm pretty sure that come up in delta quite a lot
S0322	well
S0320	put like vocabulary phrase on the board i think
S0322	i don't think you would still have to all agree and
S0320	you would have to
S0322	when new people come
S0320	you would have to
S0322	it would have to be
S0320	you'd have to do the train because also the less experience teachers get ten vocabulary phrase out of a listen lesson
S0322	yeah
S0320	can be quite challenge
S0322	yeah i mean there there would be a lot more plan involve than currently what happen
S0320	yeah
S0322	with a lot of teachers
S0320	yeah well not do you think so
S0322	cos you're suppose to have state aim
S0320	i don't yeah i'm not
S0322	and target language
S0320	the i'm not a fan of the state aim i have to say
S0322	no i don't
S0320	er
S0322	anyway
S0320	but again for newly qualify teachers
S0322	sometimes i'm really relieve that the students don't know what i have plan
S0322	because what happen end up be nothing like it
S0320	i like have a week's aim i like do
S0322	yeah
S0320	a week menu
S0322	uhu
S0320	but it's always very vague it's always
S0322	mm
S0320	we're gonna do this this and then we might do a bite of this
S0322	mm
S0320	but i always hedge my bet by say if we have time we'll do this
S0322	mm
S0320	and we mainly
S0322	mm
S0320	want to do this okay okay so
S0322	er
S0320	brand standardisation
S0322	yes
S0320	policy
S0322	so
S0320	what else
S0322	the house style basically he be talk about collective responsibility
S0320	oh okay
S0322	that that must include all teachers and i be just try to imagine any of that stuff at work
S0320	what do you mean what do you mean the collective responsibility
S0322	that that that the school that everybody take collective responsibility for what happen
S0320	oh that's
S0322	in the school
S0320	but then but then if you're go to take collective responsibility then you have to have you have to this sound ridiculous
S0322	you have to
S0320	you have to have collective responsibility
S0322	you have to foster the culture of collaboration and trust
S0320	well how be you gonna do that if you've get such a
S0322	you have to have share visions and goals
S0320	top down management system well no you've get to listen to people
S0322	erm
S0320	this all sound very idealistic
S0322	you have to aim at consistency of quality so that you can create a brand a real brand but what be interest and you'll like this i think about this be in order to find out what lengths an elective teach team
S0320	yeah
S0322	from the point of students
S0320	oh
S0322	he give some students bear in mind again that they're university
S0320	yeah
S0322	students
S0320	of course
S0322	he give them a questionnaire
S0320	oh
S0322	to find out what they think
S0320	ah
S0322	which make an effective teach team
S0320	and effective teach team
S0322	and
S0320	not just an effective teacher
S0322	team
S0320	an effective teach team
S0322	yeah yeah
S0320	oh that's interest
S0322	so it be in term of what each erm what the teachers could be do
S0320	yeah
S0322	and he give i don't know
S0322	he give some i dunno if it be just well
S0320	okay
S0322	some kind of silly examples or what they're not ones that he didn't think as well as ones that he
S0320	okay
S0322	he do think
S0320	yeah
S0322	like for example teachers should wear the uniform
S0320	mm
S0322	whether that be important in build a successful teach team
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm and so these be the things that he ask there be like twenty things
S0320	oh okay
S0322	and
S0320	one
S0322	he give them to us
S0320	and one essential okay
S0322	to predict what they think would be important and unfortunately i have end up i be gonna leave it blank but i
S0320	oh no that's fine
S0322	just so i call the ones that
S0320	the ones that he say be important or the ones
S0322	the ones that
S0320	or the ones
S0322	the students choose
S0320	that the students choose
S0322	as most important
S0320	er teachers use the same book teachers write the same the input everyone's use the same work outside class choose the same i can't imagine they would care students would think about the teachers share beliefs about what be effective mm
S0322	mm it be interest what they do
S0320	teachers know all students' strong and weak point now
S0322	that be a definite one that i choose
S0320	that's get to be because it's all completely student centre
S0322	yeah
S0320	students be like well it's all about me
S0322	well no but they do you know oh he know that i'm not good at this
S0320	yeah
S0322	she know that you know of course you do cos then they feel like they actually
S0320	yeah teachers their expectations feedback the same accent equally motivate over new ideas admit mistake
S0322	mm i
S0320	oh that's an interest one
S0322	mm
S0320	i always admit my mistake in class teachers have a similar amount of stt student talk time
S0322	mm
S0320	oh
S0322	i don't know how they'd know that so the biggest
S0320	that's oh
S0322	the biggest one
S0320	okay
S0322	what's number seventeen
S0320	er teachers that be open to new ideas
S0322	mm
S0320	okay so yeah what come out top
S0322	so this be the yeah this be what he give us for these be the least important
S0320	the least important and what i'm confuse
S0322	so where they're bold
S0320	yeah
S0322	that be the sort of
S0320	so it's
S0322	strong pattern
S0320	a number
S0322	number one be like where be you
S0320	teachers very or not
S0322	or be the least important
S0320	important
S0322	or do
S0320	okay
S0322	the bold ones over this side show that it be
S0320	number four be important teachers use the same
S0322	important or essential
S0320	scheme okay
S0322	then you've get ones that be quite spread around
S0320	yeah
S0322	but even all these
S0320	what's then
S0322	all of these ones generally
S0320	from what
S0322	that be the one about erm
S0320	seventeen
S0322	new ideas
S0320	no that's interest and thirty five nineteen teachers use variety and then
S0322	equally motivate
S0320	twelve
S0322	i think it's
S0320	teachers yeah no oh sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
S0322	that's another not important
S0320	interest one the
S0322	it's a bite spread but number fifty
S0320	er teachers have the same accent
S0322	yeah
S0320	yeah that's fair enough oh that's interest
S0322	so yes
S0320	from the point of view of the students
S0322	mm cos that's the idea be that he keep on come back to the fact that it's
S0320	mm
S0322	for the sake of the students it's not so we're all happy
S0320	so presumably
S0322	and love each other and we enjoy our job more it's because what you're give to the students be better
S0320	yeah
S0322	if you've get an effective team
S0320	so presumably that's what he's base his change on then on this research i suppose
S0322	mm
S0320	he would have do the research and then implement the change accordingly
S0322	yes
S0320	that's interest
S0322	but he do sound erm it do sound like a bite of a different the kind of place he work sound a bite more like
S0320	well he work
S0322	a place where you would
S0320	he work at erm he's a lecturer on the ma tefl and i quite like him after the advance one but now i'm not so convince if he think that all lessons should have
S0322	it be a lot he be
S0320	very clear aim
S0322	he he keep say
S0320	it's quite a fundamental difference
S0322	you know these be the good things about teamwork which be a bite yeah and literally you know have a team would be nice
S0320	but equally if you're in this be the thing if you're in
S0322	it reduce absenteeism
S0320	if you're in manchester the university you've get quite a erm you've get quite a large pool of people to choose from where
S0320	oh no actually down here you've get quite a large pool of people to choose from
S0322	mm
S0320	they just nothing ever change
S0322	i be think today though of the
S0320	it's just always the same core people isn't it
S0322	amount of variety
S0320	yeah
S0322	in this job in the kind of school
S0320	mm
S0322	general english school where you have
S0320	yeah
S0322	have kid adults all those
S0320	yeah
S0322	different kinds of course
S0320	yeah
S0322	i though god imagine if you're teach in like a proper place where all you do be one type of you could really get good at it
S0320	i think you be gonna say it's bore
S0322	if you have one type of course to teach well it probably would be in the end
S0320	yeah it would be very bore
S0322	i think god if what the different things you'd be able to do
S0320	no but the thing be
S0322	sometimes i get back to teach grammar and i think i haven't teach any grammar for about eight months really
S0320	i'll tell you what though
S0322	in a general
S0320	with the
S0322	english way
S0320	with the pre sessional i do the interest differences be the subject so they be wildly differ subject
S0322	mm
S0320	there be this one german girl who be quite an anomaly who be study to be a maths teacher i think there be a guy who be study nanotechnology
S0320	there be a few indonesians who be on a government sponsor erm ma programme cos they be gonna go home and build train in indonesia
S0322	oh
S0320	so that's what they be here for so the variety with that come from the the variety in that context come from the subject the different subject you're study
S0322	mm
S0320	but it's not as wide as you get in a general english school
S0322	mm
S0320	it would be bore
S0322	yeah it would but i would like a little bite more chance to even remember how i use to do things and start do that again before
S0320	yeah
S0322	do the next thing cos sometimes i just take so long to get back to
S0320	oh god they're back in from february aren't they
S0322	so long to get back into
S0320	oh
S0322	general mode
S0320	yeah
S0322	and just as i'm get use to it a little bite
S0320	yeah
S0322	cos at the moment i'm all over the place there's board all over the place
S0320	mm
S0322	and it's just grammar just teach grammar
S0320	so maybe you should
S0322	properly and it's
S0320	standardise yourself
S0322	yeah
S0320	give yourself a board plan
S0322	but iwbs
S0320	oh
S0322	i just can't write anything on them that look even vaguely organise
S0320	i be talk to at the
S0322	it's so
S0320	school about iwbs actually and i be
S0322	mm
S0320	well my point be i i think they're great but in the when i be teach in the summer i didn't have
S0322	mm
S0320	have the time
S0322	mm
S0320	to think about how to use them effectively
S0322	no
S0320	cos you can
S0322	and that be
S0320	do amaze stuff
S0322	one of the things
S0320	but it's
S0322	the british council
S0320	just not have the time
S0322	comment be that
S0320	oh
S0322	the iwbs weren't weren't be use for anything really more than just write on them
S0320	thankfully i have erm oh i do have an iwb in my class but i wasn't use it
S0322	i have to use it because it be the only
S0320	oh no no i use the other board i think oh i use it to play a cd
S0322	i be just do normal and i be
S0320	i use it for audio and that be it
S0322	just do didn't really do much of anything really much
S0320	yeah
S0322	but
S0320	but this be the thing it's have the time to explore and experiment cos it's a very experiential
S0322	mm
S0320	product isn't it and you just have to
S0322	but i be think if with things like this like have this vocabulary
S0320	mm
S0322	down the side of the board so it's there
S0320	yeah
S0322	through the whole lesson can't do that on
S0320	no you can't can you
S0322	the iwb they're much smaller
S0320	yeah
S0322	if you wanna start write a list
S0320	but you also get different
S0322	it's not gonna be there cos you have to go
S0320	you get different
S0322	to the next page
S0320	you get different page
S0322	to do something else
S0320	don't you that's interest
S0322	doesn't work
S0320	no it doesn't but then i suppose you would just have to put a list somewhere else surely just not on the iwb
S0322	yeah
S0320	but but
S0322	which mean go back to use the old
S0320	or put a bite of
S0322	the older one
S0320	paper up somewhere have a flip chart or something like that you need
S0322	yeah
S0320	you do need something that's
S0322	but which again mean that iwbs be not a substitute
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	for a normal board
S0320	yeah
S0322	get really annoy that people don't use the
S0320	but he doesn't
S0322	their class back to the old board
S0320	he doesn't give people time to
S0322	he also didn't consult anybody on the type of
S0320	oh i remember you say that
S0322	board he buy
S0320	yeah oh well never mind
S0322	mm
S0320	what else do he say
S0322	so anyway he it be something about why teamwork be good
S0320	yeah
S0322	uhu er reduce the staff turnover boredom and blah blah about competition
S0320	antagonism
S0322	yeah right erm improve productivity motivation sense of community student result
S0320	mm
S0322	improve students' result maybe at a university not quite sure
S0320	it's so hard to measure student result in a continuous enrolment school
S0322	mm definitely how do you know if they have a different teacher that do things differently they would have
S0320	well quite often they do have different teachers but then
S0322	oh a lot yes
S0320	but then they always see that as a negative don't they
S0322	mm erm what else do he say do he say anything else no i like the thing about the charismatic teacher
S0320	yes
S0322	oh yeah everybody's get one haven't they and everybody kind of go yeah that seem to be like rogue do their own thing don't really know what they're do but everybody
S0320	i
S0322	like him and they don't have any problems with anything
S0320	yeah those be the ones the doss love though
S0322	yeah
S0320	doss love them
S0322	of course they cos they get good feedback
S0320	but also cos they do everything well they say they do everything
S0322	yeah nothing to complain about
S0320	they'll say yes to everything they don't complain about stuff whether they're do it very well or not be another matter
S0322	mm i mean i'm the opposite of that because
S0322	i complain about everything and then i'm just see as a troublemaker or a whinge bag
S0322	and like but this be a problem for the students this be why i care
S0320	so what be you be you the uncharismatic teacher
S0322	yes i be that's so that's true
S0322	well it doesn't come naturally to me
S0320	that's brilliant
S0322	i flip work hard at too hard at it to the point where i get so stress about everything
S0320	i just don't see the
S0322	and complain about everything
S0320	i don't think all the students be amaze that's the one that get me i don't think all the students be amaze and i don't think there be any class without problems
S0322	no say something today about oh teach and say i'd love to teach for
S0320	i bet it but
S0322	six months
S0320	i bet
S0322	and say you could teach them for six months but they wouldn't have learn anything in that time so oh but i'd really enjoy it cos be say well maybe not
S0320	oh i just
S0322	when you've get nine other students in your class and and erm
S0320	i can't yeah
S0322	's really
S0320	i can't
S0322	sick of people say that should be fine
S0320	yeah
S0322	she ask for a student to come up
S0320	mm
S0320	oh yeah
S0322	and erm suddenly everyone
S0320	from where to a pre intermediate
S0322	from a pre int
S0320	yeah to int
S0322	cos she have be there for quite a while and so she's
S0320	well be she ready
S0322	be in there all these people have that's debatable
S0320	this be but yeah
S0322	but there's no strong pre int class there's no proper pre int class
S0320	mm
S0322	really
S0320	he make the weirdest mistake
S0322	yeah but he be say
S0320	really weird
S0322	well that i have erm in my class
S0320	yeah
S0322	who would suddenly say suddenly say something like won't
S0320	yeah
S0322	won't
S0320	but
S0322	but be be that be it
S0320	yeah
S0322	be what's be
S0320	god
S0322	and it be what
S0320	but his write be just totally nonsensical and understand spanish
S0322	mm
S0320	totally nonsensical in any language
S0322	mm
S0320	it be really odd
S0322	didn't say it as if he be totally ready
S0320	yeah
S0322	but as if with the people he's with in the class that he's in
S0320	yeah
S0322	it would probably be best for him
S0320	yeah
S0322	to move up
S0320	yeah
S0322	and have a go
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm so she go and say this and then she get really annoy because say that everybody think he's not good enough and be start er say who be everything
S0320	yeah right
S0322	because
S0320	she's his teacher
S0322	i'm his teacher and
S0320	yeah
S0322	have be for quite a while
S0320	who be his afternoon teacher
S0322	nobody else have teach him recently
S0320	oh he only do mornings
S0322	no he do
S0320	no
S0322	afternoons with
S0320	yeah big surprise there
S0322	and have also say why not
S0320	yeah
S0322	so it wasn't either of his kind of teachers
S0320	nice positive response there
S0322	who think he wasn't good enough
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm yeah and she be like how can have an opinion on how can come and tell me
S0320	yeah
S0322	isn't good enough
S0320	how would he know
S0322	so she just get really annoy and then she be say i'm sick of people say that my class should be fine to teach because it's
S0320	like she doesn't know
S0322	i know she's just not in the mood i think normally she'd rise above but
S0320	well it's frustrate isn't it
S0322	yeah
S0320	so he just say it be all so he say it be down to
S0322	teachers be not in isolation
S0320	no
S0322	don't work with students in isolation
S0320	okay
S0322	then you've also get the students outside school time you've get their all this other erm and and you should not think of themselves a victim of force beyond their control
S0320	that sound familiar
S0322	ah when teachers be sort of say i don't know what that be actually erm but variable quality
S0320	i think with i think
S0322	so he's talk really about standardise certain things
S0320	i think with those
S0322	and and for a school to be able to say well all our teachers do this
S0320	yeah
S0322	in a class and all out teachers do that in a class
S0320	but i think with those teachers they just they seem to forget that they've get permanent position
S0322	mm
S0320	and that they choose to except the job they choose to apply for it and they choose to accept it not like anyone's force them to stay
S0322	didn't though do she when well when she come back she just walk in
S0320	but she must have ask for her job back like she must have do
S0322	yeah
S0320	they they've all consciously choose to stay there
S0322	mm but i always get the idea she's get a family
S0320	yeah
S0322	need consistent
S0320	yeah yeah
S0322	income
S0320	yeah of course yeah but 's not that bad
S0322	no she's not actually
S0320	's not i'm so hard do by
S0322	no
S0320	this be the worst thing in the world she just
S0322	no
S0320	quietly get on with it
S0322	yeah yeah
S0320	yeah okay what else do he say
S0322	oh yeah he get us to erm
S0322	make a circley thing
S0320	yeah
S0322	and think of yourself and two other teachers in your school
S0320	okay
S0322	and think of
S0320	that's a
S0322	where
S0320	that's a diagram
S0322	okay be it
S0320	yes it be that's what i learn in my clil
S0322	and look at these things think about what you have common with each teacher like what
S0320	who which teachers do you choose
S0322	i choose me and
S0320	yeah that's interest
S0322	and think of things that me and have in common and things that
S0320	okay
S0322	me and have in common and things all three of us and i couldn't do it cos i have no idea
S0320	oh that's
S0322	what they do in the class
S0320	an interest point do you not
S0322	i be suppose to be there with the do
S0320	try and do it with me
S0322	because most of the people who be there
S0320	yeah of course
S0322	it be doss
S0320	well the er the clil one be do one as well but it didn't really matter
S0322	and i think no but if you're a do hopefully you would have observe these people at some point
S0320	ah true
S0322	this be also base on the idea of quite regular observation
S0320	what do they class as regular
S0322	don't know but i think well i can't i can't i have no idea what they do
S0320	do you choose some other people then
S0322	i don't really i couldn't think what
S0320	be you only choose permanent teachers then
S0322	yeah i mean i could have maybe well deliberately choose people like that i think i'd
S0320	yeah
S0322	have more in common with but
S0320	mm
S0322	but with the with the team that you've get
S0320	yeah
S0322	so that be the whole point
S0320	that's interest
S0322	erm because he be say that to help identify your current house style and then he show us a picture of an extremely messy room and i think yep that's our house style just all over the place he say because it might not be obvious to you but it would be obvious to students whether you have one or not
S0320	messy in what in what in what
S0322	well
S0320	context
S0322	just a complete mess he show a picture of a mansion say this be what you advertise
S0320	yeah
S0322	and that's that's to students
S0320	yeah
S0322	and this be probably more like
S0320	so what like posters on the floor
S0322	it be just a complete you know stuff pile all all over the place just a completely mess
S0320	oh okay
S0322	it's kind of true from a student's perspective it might
S0320	yeah
S0322	but they normally only get two experience two teachers
S0320	i don't
S0322	one morning and one afternoon
S0320	think they
S0322	so they're not
S0320	do
S0322	gonna be make that many comparisons
S0320	yeah well i suppose actually yeah
S0322	but actually no a lot of them do have lot of different teachers
S0320	yeah i be gonna say but think about my students in the summer most of them just have me and for the whole summer
S0322	mm
S0320	so it be well the pre intermediate forever
S0322	er behaviour have to be see to be share
S0320	oh what
S0322	they should
S0320	so the managers
S0322	the school
S0320	have to do the same as well
S0322	should be able to provide certain guarantee for lessons no matter
S0320	like what
S0322	what teacher you have well that'll be the same
S0320	oh for students
S0322	no matter what teacher you have
S0320	yeah you'll have this this this and the other
S0322	this will happen and this will happen where do that fit with
S0320	yeah that's true yeah what's that on the first page there
S0322	just a load of rubbish really
S0320	characteristics and
S0322	oh
S0320	in effective
S0322	teamwork's good
S0320	teach can i have a look
S0322	teamwork's good because
S0320	er
S0322	he you've get to look at this
S0320	yeah
S0322	and read things and say do that sound
S0320	what's a partisan
S0322	do that sound right partisan be when you go your own way isn't it
S0320	oh
S0322	but look at that i do kind of read it and think oh yes
S0320	what withhold
S0322	lot of things
S0320	that's so true
S0322	and lot of things
S0320	use to build power information use to build power big time
S0322	yeah
S0320	mainly down definitely oh that's bad look at that that's all of them
S0322	i know i know i be look down this side didn't even get to this side while he give it to us i be just look down here think yep yep
S0320	mm
S0322	intimidate guard
S0320	guard
S0322	atmosphere compartmentalise
S0320	involve personal and emotive
S0322	posh word group non posh word group
S0320	conflict involve personality and motives if you're look at the whole team of the school as a whole big time especially with the directors erm oh force decisions there we go motivation personal goals ignore individual achievement value without
S0322	individual achievement value without concern for the group
S0320	be that on the part of the teachers
S0322	mm i think so
S0320	so the teachers want their individual achievement value without concern for the group yeah probably actually
S0322	mm
S0320	it probably come with those charismatic teachers
S0322	mm
S0320	oh they're just wonderful for my class
S0322	mm
S0320	i've teach them for so long
S0322	mm
S0320	reward base on contribution unclear basis true yeah that's about right isn't it
S0322	cos yeah what kind of answer be that somebody say i'm have my problems with this happen and somebody say well they never do that with me what kind of an answer be that
S0322	like how do that
S0320	it's not an answer
S0322	no it's not at all
S0320	it's just somebody be in competition with you
S0322	it's like it's just make it far worse isn't it
S0320	yeah
S0322	cos then it's like say
S0320	of course it be it's say you're
S0322	no that's not a problem
S0320	the bad teacher
S0322	it's just you're the problem
S0320	yeah exactly you're the bad teacher you're the one with the problem
S0322	and then i'm sure do that as well just go oh well don't know mm
S0320	well i get the impression it's cos he doesn't really care
S0322	but he do though
S0320	about other teachers
S0322	no about other teachers okay
S0320	yeah
S0322	mm
S0320	cos he seem to get on with the students but doesn't really care about other teachers he's not one to go well they're not a problem in my class be he cos i share a class with him all summer and i have i actually have very little to do with him
S0322	mm
S0320	like very little which be fine but erm yeah i don't yeah
S0322	mm
S0320	it be fine but he wasn't you know one for share ideas particularly
S0322	mm
S0320	he be alright to share a class with
S0322	yeah sometimes
S0322	this be quite good it be how would you rate your team at the moment
S0322	and it be very clear to be
S0320	communicate effectively i think you're lie
S0322	what the kind of issue be
S0320	i think you're lie i think some of it be lower you know
S0322	well i know but i i be not be particularly low but those be the ones i star in the end
S0320	you weren't be particularly honest
S0322	as be the main issue
S0320	be good listeners really you give them a five a four out of five
S0322	well they listen they just ignore it
S0322	it be quite hard to think because
S0320	go the extra mile i agree with
S0322	if you're think of at the same time as
S0320	offer praise
S0320	i would put
S0322	it's quite hard to
S0320	offer praise
S0322	do that
S0320	lower than three with that team i would put it at two
S0322	well i be think about towards students
S0320	oh wait oh
S0322	not to the school
S0320	oh i be think within the team
S0322	oh to each other
S0320	yeah that's what i be
S0322	no i be just think in term of
S0320	what they do with the students
S0322	well i don't know not always
S0320	do you not think look i would have put these as what
S0322	yeah
S0320	what be the
S0322	yeah
S0320	oh i be rat these
S0322	i don't know
S0320	what be they like within
S0322	mm
S0320	what's the teach team like to each other
S0322	see see i always like to think yes okay well if it be certain people it would be here but then other ones i mean you throw into the mix and think
S0320	yes
S0322	mm well
S0320	i don't think praise be anywhere there though even if you put in the next
S0322	no not not about the school no i i wasn't think about that though
S0320	no about about i so i'm think of it within the teach team how people work together
S0322	that's i don't i don't think i be think of that
S0320	so offer praise to each other
S0322	at the time
S0320	oh okay
S0322	but also
S0320	so i would put that lower
S0322	i be very aware that i be sit in a room of doss
S0320	yeah
S0322	who
S0320	yeah yeah
S0322	be not gonna say
S0320	who know
S0322	i'm at a really shit school
S0320	oh yeah that's true actually
S0322	it's really crap at my school and we all hate each other and i don't have any kind of team
S0322	because that's what they're responsible for so i think well i can't
S0320	that's interest actually
S0322	and the person that be with me european school
S0320	oh
S0322	she say she she be the assistant
S0320	oh she's actually
S0322	do
S0320	the do though she's be there for fifteen years she's the assistant do the only reason she's not the do be because she hasn't get the delta
S0322	oh well i dunno if it be her then cos it she sound a bite like newer
S0320	or be it who's a teacher there be only
S0322	she teach she's the assistant to
S0320	no yeah it's
S0322	oh
S0320	there's only about five teachers there there's who i've
S0322	well she say
S0320	who i've meet with
S0322	she pretty much work there by herself she's
S0320	the
S0322	the only teacher really
S0320	right so 's position she's be the a do for years like ten years
S0322	mm
S0320	well she's be in the school for about ten years or fifteen years she's the a do and effectively she do a do job but she doesn't have the delta so what they have be and this be what i've enquire about on several different occasion they have a do for one day a week because they need somebody delta qualify
S0322	oh okay that sound right then yeah
S0320	so be the
S0322	she's really nice
S0320	she be she's lovely
S0322	the person i meet
S0320	yeah she's really nice
S0322	but she be kind of say well it's pretty much
S0320	i tell you what though she never forget cos
S0322	i know my own team
S0320	i i tell you what i go to see her before after i'd get back from ecuador before i do my celta to find out about possible work and she say well you need to do your celta and i be like alright then then i go back again er possibly before i do my delta and then maybe another time i think i'd be in two or three time no i go in i go in when i be pregnant i be like i'd like to do the do job but erm only if you can wait another year or so
S0320	she go oh i remember you you come in she never forget anyone so i be like oh god so this time when i go in she say oh yes i remember you you come to see me and erm it's because they don't have any other permanent teachers because they're so small
S0322	mm
S0320	do you know what the
S0322	mm
S0320	maximum capacity be thirty students
S0322	mm
S0320	it's unreal it's tiny okay sorry so what be she say she's her own team
S0322	yeah pretty much she be kind of say it's a bite difficult cos when i think you know i need to work with myself a lot of the time mm
S0320	yeah
S0322	so i don't know why she be there actually if i think about it you know cos she just she should have two because it be the do strand they must have more teachers at time there
S0320	oh yeah yeah yeah of course well they've get and they've get 's the director of study the figurehead director of study
S0322	mm
S0320	erm and be the assistant director so so she'd they all think
S0322	so they could have the same
S0320	er
S0322	house style
S0320	but they do have like i go in last they call me last week to go in because two people be off sick but they have like
S0322	mm
S0320	four class run they'll run a class with one person in it
S0322	mm
S0320	they they've still get quite a lot of teachers but they're just not permanent contract teachers
S0322	but i do think in this one when i come out of the thing about the teach team
S0320	mm
S0322	i do think yeah they should they really should
S0320	should what
S0322	they should know what's go on and
S0320	who should
S0322	and there's no reason why
S0320	the teach team or the managers
S0322	no the managers there's no reason why they shouldn't say you all have to do this this this
S0320	mm
S0322	and this
S0320	yeah
S0322	because if you it be kind of take responsibility it say we care what go on
S0320	what the managers
S0322	and also
S0320	take responsibility
S0322	make it easier to a certain point for a new teachers come in
S0320	mm
S0322	if they're tell at the begin this be the way we do
S0320	but i i do you know who i think the best person to implement that would be can you guess about of all the people that they've get there who would be the best to introduce it and implement it
S0322	i don't know
S0320	love his list love things be standardise it's not his job but he would be absolutely hand down the best person to introduce it
S0322	yeah but he wouldn't want to do it because
S0320	no of course he wouldn't
S0322	he doesn't
S0320	cos he's not academic
S0322	want to
S0320	but he and also he's not that's not really his role be it but he would so be the best he's so good at this
S0322	why be it not his role that then
S0320	because he's not involve in the classroom stuff he's just involve in the list isn't he
S0322	but he's the director of study
S0320	i know that but effectively i yeah if they be gonna do it would be
S0322	well before be there he be the
S0320	well this be the thing
S0322	director of study
S0320	i think with as a director of study who's terribly creative i don't think he would introduce it
S0322	no cos he wouldn't do it himself
S0320	well he wouldn't do it himself
S0322	and make
S0320	and he wouldn't think that everybody else should do it either and
S0322	but he do i've see him when he sit there when he make a lesson plan he always on his paper lesson plan
S0320	yeah
S0322	have vocabulary
S0320	yeah i can
S0322	he have that bite
S0320	i completely agree but
S0322	but then why should he share that rather than him always do that himself if he study this
S0320	but it's
S0322	and he know it's a good idea
S0320	we've study it
S0322	why not
S0320	don't you get that with delta
S0322	no but i'm not the director of study though
S0320	no that's true
S0322	he be and if he know it's good practice
S0320	yeah
S0322	and he always do it himself why not say cos he
S0320	yeah
S0322	he
S0320	yeah true
S0322	he doesn't want to i mean it would be hard because they don't like him anyway and do something like that
S0320	yeah
S0322	would make him just the grumble
S0320	mm
S0322	it's not that much to ask though really
S0320	no it's not you'd think they should be do it anyway
S0322	next four years in the same way
S0320	yeah i think i think probably maybe introduce it in stag and start
S0322	well that he do say that at the end
S0320	start with the vocab
S0322	he say a little a little at a time
S0320	with the vocabulary list yeah i think i'm gonna introduce it in in the summer school actually
S0322	yeah iwps certainly be a
S0320	problem
S0322	problem yeah
S0320	yeah it's a shame isn't it
S0322	yes
S0320	mm
