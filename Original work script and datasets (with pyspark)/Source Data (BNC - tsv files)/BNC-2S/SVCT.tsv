S0671	and your muscle remember it
S0670	yeah
S0671	or your your speech remember it or whatever skill it be
S0670	yeah
S0671	and then you erm practice it in different place so that you er you get a you have passion for it and you apply the skill that you've learn motor with passion and interest and perseverance and that's how
S0670	yeah
S0671	you win
S0670	well i've put my passion and endurance into video game
S0671	yeah uhu
S0670	don't always win at those frequently don't nice catch i'll give you ten point if you guess whether that be sarcastic or serious

S0671	that's in the bible mate
S0670	i be half expect that to be a original i be like yes preach it buddy
S0671	well i dunno what be win in life key question i think it be those three things it's love mercy act justly and walk humbly
S0670	yeah that's a recipe for win but what be what's it look like to win our life
S0671	well you you get you learn the skill practice it so that it's a motor programme
S0671	and then apply character
S0670	okay
S0670	so i would argue that win at life for me because obviously it's different from anyone else be to be happy how
S0671	yeah
S0670	do i learn happiness as a motor skill
S0671	oh well what be
S0670	that scupper you didn't it
S0671	what be what be happiness to you though
S0670	oh answer my question with a question how clever i'd say that's irrelevant
S0671	really
S0670	i would
S0671	what what be happiness it's so intangible that it's irrelevant be that
S0670	yeah
S0671	what you're say
S0670	yep
S0670	i'd say that how i achieve happiness isn't the relevant sign of this
S0671	oh okay
S0670	not how i become happy i mean the form of happiness happiness be a state of be how do i learn the ability to become happy as a motor skill
S0671	i think er you as a motor skill
S0670	yeah
S0671	i think you need to er glean and nice
S0671	glean and understand from lot of people just as okay so if you be say how do i do forehand in tennis
S0670	yeah
S0671	erm
S0670	hit the ball
S0671	you
S0670	with the forehand
S0671	you learn lot from different people by watch people by erm watch people by read book by get people to coach you so those two so like watch people learn from people and then get people to to coach you and then you understand what the skill be so for happiness watch people who be happy erm learn from people who be happy and get someone to help you
S0670	okay
S0671	and then but you you see it look different for other people so obviously
S0670	yeah
S0671	the set technique of the forehand be it's the same for everyone but it look different for different people
S0670	how
S0671	so you find how
S0670	yes
S0671	well a roger forehand's forehand roger forehand
S0670	roger forehand
S0671	roger federer's
S0670	that would be an incredible tennis player
S0670	watch him him roger roger forehand
S0671	there's a girl in my er in my literature class
S0670	there's a girl
S0671	there's a girl in my er english class whose surname be
S0670	oh that oh she be destine
S0671	yeah
S0670	to be a literature student
S0671	erm so maybe learn from people get them get and then understand for yourself what the skill be understand what happiness be for yourself f
S0670	yeah
S0671	and then practice it in everyday life so maybe the skill that you've learn from other people that happiness be to live in the moment
S0670	uhu
S0671	okay so just enjoy what we're do right now
S0670	yeah
S0671	enjoy the simple things of life maybe you could pick that up from someone so then what you need to do be then practice that
S0670	yeah
S0671	every day erm once you've practice it it become a motor neuron so that by not a motor programme
S0670	it become a motor neuron do it
S0671	a motor programme so by the time you're ten years down the line you've be practice this every day then it's become a way of life and all you need do be apply your perseverance to understand it's part of your character and you're suddenly happiness in that sense be part of you're start to win in your in your sense
S0670	yeah nice
S0671	simple
S0670	i mean yeah
S0671	this be all tennis theory in er
S0670	this this be tennis under the guise of er
S0671	philosophy
S0670	yeah i i love that because it should definitely be the other other way round within a book it would be like you're talk about tennis but you're really talk about the darkness in each other's souls and here we be talk about happiness as an abstract concept all symbolic of hit a nice forearm
S0671	oh yeah
S0670	forearm forehand
S0671	forehand yeah
S0670	nice
S0670	that be nice forearm hit then could you make a move for forearm you definitely could
S0671	well you just have to
S0670	if you if you hold the back the bat the i may not know much about tennis but at least i know how to hold the bat be you hold it so you know how you normally hold it with the handle in your hand and the main body of the racquet further out above your hand
S0671	the head yeah
S0670	yeah the head
S0671	yeah
S0670	you have you hold that the other way round so that the handle be still in your hand
S0670	but the head be cover your forearm
S0671	okay yeah
S0670	and you hold your arm outstretched and you hit it so you're hit the ball between the erm
S0671	so the wrist
S0670	the elbow and the wrist
S0671	for some sort of weird drop shoot would it be
S0670	i mean it it's literally so you could call the move the forearm as oppose to the forehand but yeah sure it's a drop shoot whatever fancy play some virtual tennis actually might i might boot up gta and play er
S0670	play some tennis oh man you know what i i wanna play some golf i really do i do love i do love a bite a golf i'm a little i'm a little overzealous sometimes with er with my shots my friends be line up their their wedge and their five iron
S0671	five iron
S0670	not five iron they're wedge and it would probably be like an eight
S0671	seven iron
S0670	eight or
S0671	or an eight iron yeah
S0670	eight iron probably
S0671	so
S0670	oh yeah this this one just er i'll hit it really hard but i'll get a little you know not too much distance and i'm just there like guy you need two club in golf the driver and the putter
S0670	if it's not on the green use the driver
S0670	although to be fair i do use i think i use the putter in the rough one time i be like the rough be just outside the green it be
S0671	oh that's alright you're allow to do that yeah
S0670	i be probably about like ten fifteen yards off the green and i be in some pretty thick rough i be like you know what putter i'll smash it and i'll just flick into the green nicely
S0671	do it
S0670	no
S0671	but it get catch in the rough
S0670	even slightly
S0671	yeah
S0670	i er i i thrash at the grass a little bite make quite a few divots the putter be probably irreparably break although my friend one time actually do manage to break a golf club we be at the drive range in er wait be it it be we be either we be basically we be somewhere we either do a nine hole course at or we be at the drive range and and take an almighty swing with a nine iron and the head just come fly off and he's just stick there hold just the er the club with with no end at all to it
S0670	just a long piece of stick essentially
S0671	do you ever do i ever tell you the story of
S0670	i don't think you do
S0671	erm and let go of the we be do a last shoot
S0670	yeah
S0671	see who can hit it the furthest and he swing it
S0670	yeah
S0671	let's go of the club at the right point
S0670	yeah
S0671	in his in his swing so that when he turn around he doesn't have the club in his hand and it's disappear from our view because you've get like the thing
S0670	yeah
S0671	and it's just go straight up in the air
S0671	and erm and he look round and look like he's kill a man
S0671	he be just really kind of quiet atmosphere and erm and then we don't see it land but we do see it kind of bite like where's it go where's it go and we look up there and you know the big net
S0670	yeah
S0671	that come we just see
S0671	over the net
S0670	what
S0671	yeah and he be use six iron
S0670	no way
S0671	and six selection
S0671	onto the first tee
S0671	just bang
S0670	do you manage to get it back
S0671	we do but thankfully no one be on the first tee
S0670	thank goodness
S0671	cos it would have just it it land on the on the er tee box so it's like
S0670	to be fair i'm gonna be honest like golf be just a statistical nightmare when it come to injury and death like it's not likely but the amount of time that i've hear stories like that or that i've do stuff like that where i've be on the drive range and i've hit a ball and it's have so much shwang it's go over the net straight into like the second hole kind of area and i'm like you have
S0671	over that way
S0670	you have yeah over to the right you have so big and open space with so few people on but so many loose ball fly like at ridiculous pace with ridiculous force
S0671	but i tell you i be out
S0670	and like it it's not gonna hit anyone at all like on a regular basis but like when when the statistics do up and it hit someone they be go down like
S0671	yeah yeah
S0670	if you get hit by a club that come
S0671	yeah
S0670	fly over the net you get hit by a loose ball from the drive range
S0670	you you be not get up
S0671	no
S0670	soon after that
S0671	well i be er i be at er once on the erm on the er on the course with
S0670	yeah
S0671	and er he's we be on the green and we hear fore
S0670	yeah
S0671	like this we're like oh so we're kind of duck down like that brace ourselves
S0670	yeah
S0671	and and the ball smack into the golf bag
S0670	oh my goodness
S0671	it's
S0671	into the golf bag woah
S0670	yeah i nearly get hit at we be on i think the third hole someone be on the first and there's a bite of overlap cos golf course be at all but this guy probably hit it over a couple of hundred yards
S0671	yeah
S0670	with the driver so it's go pretty fast and we just hit a fore and we turn around and the problem with shout fore in my opinion be unless you're an actual golfer you know to brace or crouch down as you do it's just let you know a second before when you get hit that you're go to get hit like if you don't get hit it's like a oh hang on a sec he say fore but if you do get hit all the panic for those that second before you get hit
S0671	why don't you just
S0670	and like so and i turn round like ah ah ah like dart back and forth panic like where have it gotta be ah
S0670	and we both hear the ball
S0671	that's the worst thing to do
S0670	just whip right past our ear cos we're probably like a couple of metres apart and and it land straight into the marsh right in front of us and i'm like oh my goodness i be a metre away from get concuss like the life out of me it's a dangerous sport
S0671	i guess but statistically like the worst thing to do be to run around right or no
S0670	no like
S0671	it make i guess the worst thing to do would be to make yourself big
S0670	yeah i mean like it do sound logical at first that the most statistically bad thing to do be to move about because that way you're erm you know increase your area over the time between the ball be shout as fore and the ball hit something but in realistic term the ball be only go to one place so
S0671	yeah
S0670	if you run about you're not unless the ball be also move in the fourth dimension
S0670	erm but yeah make yourself large be the worst thing to do face the direction that the person so when they shout fore turn around be a bad idea get hit in the back of the head's not good get hit like in you know the forehead or the face
S0671	oh
S0670	be not not great yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh
S0671	oh thank goodness for that
S0670	yeah thank goodness
S0671	nice
S0670	tight throw erm i think i might pop to the loo in
S0671	okay
S0670	mind if we take a break from this some air
S0670	cheer buddy okay
S0671	i'm gonna be at this end now
S0670	yeah that's good
S0671	another ten minutes be that alright
S0670	yeah
S0671	so ten minutes leave
S0670	be that alright
S0671	yeah that's absolutely fine yeah tell you what i be think about there when you be throw stone at me i be think
S0671	david and goliath
S0670	no although i'm definitely david
S0671	while i'm throw stone
S0670	yes ta i have the physique of david
S0671	goliath yeah
S0670	i also have the potential for adultery and murder in my life later
S0671	everyone do though everyone
S0670	everyone's get the potential what i be think about be have you ever mess about with bb gun
S0671	yes
S0670	oh of course you er
S0671	well i've play with
S0670	at school of course you do
S0671	if bb gun mean gun that fire those little pellets yes
S0670	bb pellets yes
S0671	yes
S0670	yes that that that's very astute of you
S0671	well i didn't know if enough can that mean like some sort of weird innuendo
S0670	like what
S0671	i dunno what but you know when someone say
S0670	a phallic reference per chance
S0671	go on have you
S0670	yes i have and i be think if those stone have hit me that would have be a similar pain to er that of be hit by a bb gun pellet cos those things can be vicious
S0671	i'm not sure that stone would have hurt very much though
S0670	no it would have sting if it have hit though
S0671	really
S0670	like bb pellets do yeah
S0671	oh if you throw it hard yeah
S0670	yeah
S0671	but not as i be throw it in there
S0670	well the er the flight path of it mean that when it be come down it gain a little bite of pace they be also quite sharp
S0671	really
S0670	yeah
S0671	oh sorry mate i didn't realise it be gonna
S0670	oh it do don't worry like it
S0671	like and it just
S0670	it's call banter
S0671	i go like that
S0670	yeah but it be didn't hit me it wouldn't have sting as in like i wouldn't have be like ouch why but like it you would have felt it
S0671	okay yeah
S0670	yeah yeah i be think of er yeah bb gun they hurt don't have a er witty anecdote to follow that on or be you just gonna
S0671	no no witty anecdotes
S0670	great great great well so what's it like be the worst passer in this back garden
S0671	to answer this question we find
S0670	nice
S0671	and interview him
S0670	that be that be the classic sort of like i know you be but what be i
S0671	ah right this afternoon

S0670	yeah
S0671	to play tennis i have no idea it be his birthday today
S0670	yeah i mean you can still play tennis with him i'm consider whether or not we should get a gift for him or if that would set a double standard
S0671	i think we can buy him his his
S0670	drink
S0671	dessert yeah
S0670	his oh no of course what yeah let's buy him a little birthday no
S0671	should buy him a big dessert for his birthday
S0670	even better even better like to there and kick up a big fuss about the fact that it's his birthday and see if we can get it for free
S0671	yeah
S0670	why don't we go on a tour of all of the restaurants in and say it's his birthday and then just see how many we get free dessert from and then break them base on how stingy they're be
S0671	which er which business would you own if you own all of
S0670	oh that be a really good question erm what i'd like to do really be consult the monopoly board cos that one
S0671	oh yeah
S0670	kind of the definitive thing
S0671	swalec would be quite good i think
S0670	swalec
S0671	i feel like there's lot of potential in that university town if you own swalec like
S0670	yeah
S0671	they advertise at they provide
S0670	oh be a stadium
S0671	all the gas to everything erm well so it's it's an energy company
S0670	oh right oh of course it be sorry for a minute there i think that be like the name of that group within the university that we go to the lecture on hamlet for and i be like great have fun with those guy
S0671	erm
S0670	nerd
S0671	nerds erm
S0670	prepare to be bore nerds
S0671	yeah i think cos swalec would be like the er the erm utilities kind of thing
S0670	yeah nice
S0671	a monopoly and also they're they sponsor the big stage and like it's good they're do well
S0670	yeah that's fair normally i like to go for the er the train station but would i really want a share in maybe would i want a share in not at all would i want a share of get out of just no no
S0670	erm i dunno i mean what would be a good one cos i love it and it would make a lot of money be ikea
S0671	yeah that's
S0670	the ikea in although be we talk about own like company that be entirely base in or be this like own a branch cos if it's a branch then yeah i can put ikea but if it be the company i can't because it's not base in it's base in sweden
S0671	okay erm i think you can you er it's up to you what you what you what you do but you basically can be the if you choose one that's base somewhere else you can be the owner of the branch
S0670	yeah
S0671	but if you choose something that's base in here you become like the ceo
S0670	yeah i think it would be cool to have ikea but i won't choose it purely because be ceo be way better like cos be store manager you're not your own boss you're just another
S0671	yeah
S0670	manager in an endless line of managers you've just get someone else tell you do this and then you're tell other people do this
S0671	yeah
S0670	and i don't really like that kind of bureaucracy personally
S0671	yeah
S0670	erm
S0671	you wouldn't enjoy the army then
S0670	i wouldn't if i'm honest no the army's a little better because er the order be kind of a bite more direct and
S0671	okay yeah
S0670	they have mean
S0671	okay yeah yeah
S0670	whereas just work within retail i can tell you a lot of stuff that come from up top and from managers be just completely useless
S0670	there be no need for it and this isn't in a sort of like sorry have to disobey your order sir take the stronghold now not later this be like no i'm not gonna fold that shirt like that it look stupid i don't care what your focus group think it look
S0670	erm so it would have to be ceo of a company would fulfil my passions and the aesthetic be amaze
S0671	yeah cool place
S0670	but it would not bring in the money that like would
S0671	okay yeah
S0670	make a good point with
S0671	it's not any more
S0670	no it's i do not care
S0671	yeah but hold on but in our in our discussion though it's not because you you would own it's it's be sponsor by who's it be sponsor by
S0671	be it the
S0670	yeah so here's what i'd do be i'd become ceo of the i'd tell to jog on and i would continue name it the
S0671	okay that's a good er start point for a discussion there what would you
S0670	okay great
S0671	what would er what game would you bid for what would you bid for
S0670	what what game
S0671	as in what game would you try and have there would you have international rugby international football cricket
S0670	everything
S0671	everything
S0670	i would bid for everything get all of the money in
S0671	no but that mean you have to spend a lot of money
S0670	have to spend money to get it sort of i guess erm i guess it's not really set up for cricket be it
S0671	no that's more
S0670	yeah alright
S0670	so rugby international rugby yes
S0671	it's a real win
S0670	there's already a massive erm
S0671	yeah
S0670	demand for it for that stadium it's well know for it
S0671	yeah
S0670	so rugby definitely i think football i would spend much less on
S0671	okay
S0670	and not not much less than be currently be spend but much much less than rugby
S0671	okay
S0670	i think that be a more rugby city than
S0671	yeah
S0670	football
S0671	yeah and you've get football stadium for that anyway
S0670	yeah i'd throw in a few bid here and there see if i get stuff on the cheap bite of a ninety nine p you know buy it now start bid type of thing but yeah what about you what would you bid in the
S0671	oh so i own the gas company not the stadium though
S0670	oh
S0671	but i will have share in the stadium so as a shareholder i would
S0670	yeah
S0671	want to see them bid for erm international one days because that be such a good form of the game and it's the way the game's go and international t twenty so international t twenty probably more than one days because erm i'd put a lot of money into that and glamorgan cricket club
S0670	yeah
S0671	er so for the international t twenties if we can host some international t twenty that would be really good
S0670	yeah yeah okay
S0671	cos load the tv crew come and everything and
S0670	yeah
S0671	nice pass
S0670	yeah cheer buddy mm you know where what would be really nice to own but again it's not big big buck but it's cool a place like
