S0325	basically i be in french by myself because we be really early from assembly and i be sit there
S0324	in the mobile
S0325	yeah and there be two classrooms
S0324	mm
S0325	and then come in there and she be like like that and i be like hi
S0325	cos i don't like wave to people
S0324	what be she in the class opposite
S0325	i think so but she be stand in like the little lobby bite with
S0324	what be you just sit down on your own
S0325	well no because like and be sit over there and there be like me and on this table
S0324	oh
S0325	and then i be just look at the door and she be there and i be like she be like and i be like and i be just calm wave at me like one time i be walk to school and wave at me and i didn't wave back
S0324	
S0324	oh
S0325	she wave at me and i be just like mm and she sort of smile and but we be on the other side of the street so it's really awkward it wasn't really like wave distance cos you know when you're really close to someone
S0324	mm
S0325	and you wave
S0324	and when it's really far away you can't tell if they're wave at you
S0325	yeah
S0324	or someone else in your direction
S0325	and that's really depress when they're wave at someone behind you and you're like
S0324	you turn around mm mm when we talk in maths and always think that you're talk to him
S0325	yeah he's like what and i'm like not talk to you
S0324	yeah
S0325	yeah but i don't understand because i'm not actually look at him like he's there and i'm look past him like he can't he see that cos if i be talk to you and i just kind of start yeah so how how do you like isn't that just weird
S0324	yeah
S0325	i don't understand
S0324	cos you're not even look at him
S0325	and i'm not have a conversation that i would be i'm like yeah hi and he's like i didn't say anything and i'm like yes cos cos i'm not talk to you i'm talk past you and then everyone on that table be like what
S0324	i really didn't get that thing in maths when she be say that the exact dancer thing she's so annoy
S0325	i know and then she be like i really don't understand why i bother teach half the people in here and i be like ha ha
S0324	well
S0325	she always say this to me cos i'm just sit there
S0324	then don't be a teacher
S0325	and i'm just like ha ha ha ha
S0324	she's so annoy
S0325	and then i'm like and then she's like about to tell everyone off and i'm like miss can i just can i just go to the toilet now
S0325	cos she be like i be like can i go to the toilet and she be like no i be like why and she be like well you've just have the whole of lunch and i be like yeah but i didn't need to go at lunch and she be like what so you've just have the sudden urge to go when you be walk up here and i be like yeah and then she be like oh as i be sit there do that sheet i be like i really need a wee
S0325	and then i finish and i be like miss i'm finish can i go and then you didn't even notice me leave
S0324	yeah sorry
S0325	i walk right past you i look at you and you be just like oh my god you're sit in front of me
S0325	and i be just like oh alright then
S0324	yeah probably cos be so funny
S0325	oh my gosh and then today in english she go i can't read like well yeah you're the one that say that you read like half a page in nine second so like that would never happen and she literally go
S0324	yeah and then how it go seven eight nine ten eleven
S0325	yeah
S0324	second
S0325	and then like ten nine eight seven and i'm like what

S0325	exactly
S0324	that's stupid
S0325	and she go oh yeah well basically if i get my phone take off me i'm gonna just give them the old phone cos she didn't even
S0324	yeah
