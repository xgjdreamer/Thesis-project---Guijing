S0144	some weird
S0024	that's the problem i have when i after i'd cook it
S0144	yeah
S0024	it taste funny and to be honest this fajita mix be erm er it's get it go hard but i think it would
S0144	well how old be it
S0024	it well
S0144	be it open already
S0024	i use it before summer
S0144	or be
S0024	yeah it be open and
S0144	oh ah
S0024	it be quite hard
S0144	it's probably get maggots in it or something
S0024	it hasn't get maggots in it and anyway maggots don't make it taste like that it's the
S0144	how do you know
S0024	i know what maggots taste like
S0024	like erm they don't taste of anything maggots though they don't put flavour in it er what be i i've lose track of what i be gonna tell you now yeah anyway maybe we should throw it away but these things
S0144	yeah
S0024	be really expensive here
S0144	well if they don't
S0024	it's easy
S0144	taste good then they don't taste good do they

S0024	i couldn't see the ingredients so i didn't know what exactly what be in it that's the
S0144	mm

S0144	erm
S0024	there's one what's that
S0144	that's not a mozzie that's a
S0024	oh
S0144	mm don't know what that be
S0144	er yeah he be like how long do you expect it's gonna take us to do these note take mark and be like well it didn't take me very long last semester
S0144	and i've make it easier
S0144	by have this grid
S0024	yeah
S0144	so what's the problem like
S0024	yeah
S0144	and he just go on and on and he like and he and his voice be get really angry and shaky and
S0024	really
S0144	yeah he be go and say well it take me probably five minutes for each one but i suppose depend how you do it between five and twenty minutes
S0024	yeah
S0144	he be say well it take me a lot longer than twenty minutes but i think each one for mark one of those crappy little things twenty minutes
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's his problem jesus
S0024	yeah but the they
S0144	he make himself look like a tit
S0024	yeah they they forget they've forget all of the people who have be here a long time
S0144	yeah
S0024	they need to go and get themselves another job
S0144	exactly
S0024	and see how much shit they have to put up with somewhere else
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	they don't know how good they've get it there
S0144	no it's just
S0024	complain about that about mark
S0144	yeah
S0024	come on
S0144	and that's his time management
S0144	that's the problem
S0024	i don't know how they've get
S0144	he's go
S0024	the audacity to
S0144	he's go it's only worth five mark why do we have to spend so long mark it
S0024	because it would help the students it's for their progress jesus
S0144	no but you don't have to spend more than
S0024	no
S0144	do you
S0024	no you don't
S0144	it would i reckon i'd spend two minutes
S0024	well they
S0144	per student
S0024	they be talk about erm you know check some people be check all of the plagiarism things in the note some people aren't and so some people be spend a lot longer do it
S0144	but say he's gonna take the plagiarism thing about
S0024	yes
S0144	apparently
S0024	they decide that in in our meet
S0144	the paraphrase
S0024	the paraphrase bite but they still need to paraphrase the summary or something
S0144	yeah
S0024	in the summary so you've just get to check
S0144	so you don't need to paraphrase all your note as long as you put it in quotation mark
S0024	that's what i think yeah yeah that's what i say and then be say well i don't paraphrase any of it they're like no it's not paraphrase
S0144	mm
S0024	but
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's your style that's how you'd do it
S0144	yeah
S0024	erm i'm gonna tell them please put quotation mark around anything that you've take out
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	just put page number next to it
S0024	yeah
S0144	well that's how i'd do it
S0024	because
S0144	but
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's silly that we teach them exactly how to take note you know it depend how they want to do it you know
S0024	well no i i think give the flexibility
S0144	but if
S0024	if
S0144	yeah but if
S0024	i'm gonna check for plagiarism for core note one and two because you see that text over and over and over
S0144	yeah
S0024	everybody's do that text
S0144	yeah
S0024	three and four be not gonna
S0144	yeah
S0024	not gonna check it
S0144	well i'm not gonna i'm not gonna trawl through the
S0024	no but
S0144	all the read material
S0024	do say why don't you know you'll probably end up read most of them and somebody in ours say well i'm not gonna read all of the article
S0144	mm
S0024	that be on the read list
S0144	no
S0024	yeah
S0144	realistically
S0024	that be kind of that be leave up in the air
S0144	not when there's seventeen seventeen erm
S0144	piece of each of those essay
S0024	yeah
S0144	so you're talk five essay
S0144	five time seventeen
S0024	yes
S0144	some of them be fifty page each i mean you're not gonna read all that
S0024	no no that's what what they erm
S0144	that's just
S0024	so you don't know
S0144	we we
S0024	whether it's plagiarise or not
S0144	no but you can tell come on we
S0024	yeah
S0144	no we're all experience teachers
S0024	yeah
S0144	we can tell when oh hang on a minute that doesn't sound like a chinese
S0024	yeah
S0144	eighteen year old
S0144	i mean it's not rocket science
S0024	no no i hope i don't have to mark the group work project this year you do that last year didn't you i'm kind of hop just for the examination mark
S0144	and speak
S0024	no i don't wanna do er maybe speak because that would manage my time for me rather than have a big pile of paperwork just go to work and do it yeah maybe but even if you do speak you do some exams don't you
S0144	mm i don't know
S0024	yeah i'd quite like to do the speak actually yeah i might say something
S0144	mm
S0024	don't know it's i just find it difficult to manage my time when there's hundreds of paper in front of me oh my god
S0144	it be
S0024	how many
S0144	quite intimidate
S0144	when you've get like seventy
S0024	seventy
S0144	it's well i think i have about seventy to mark
S0024	seventy what
S0144	essay
S0024	what the big essay
S0144	oh i can't remember
S0024	group work essay would be smaller won't it
S0144	oh group ones
S0024	that's the second semester wouldn't it
S0144	okay group work maybe i have thirty er thirty forty
S0024	oh my god that's load
S0144	yeah and then you get ones
S0024	and then you
S0144	and then you've get to second mark some of them
S0024	second mark my god i really don't wanna do to do them
S0144	and then you've get to third mark some of them
S0024	mm
S0144	plus you've get to do all the standardisation before you
S0024	then you've get to write write full comment
S0144	yeah you've get
S0024	full feedback
S0144	yeah you've get to write like a hundred two hundred word for each one it's not it's not very nice
S0024	mm
S0144	first few be alright well no the first few be horrible cos you don't know what mark you're give or anything
S0024	and everything yeah
S0144	but then once you've kind of get that measurement in your head then it become easy but then the last
S0024	mm
S0144	twenty you just like count
S0144	you do one and then count how many you've get leave and you do another one and count how many you've get leave
S0024	i don't fancy that at all i'm gonna i might even write an email and ask them
S0144	but if you be really good with your time and you sit down and absolutely blitz it for a week
S0024	yeah then it's
S0144	then you
S0024	better for
S0144	you could finish like three or four days early
S0024	yeah that's what
S0144	and you've get but that would really be push it quite tax on your brain
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	cos you can only do
S0024	that's what use to do isn't it
S0144	mm
S0024	the other
S0144	it be seven like those group work ones maybe seven a day mark be
S0024	oh my god that's load
S0144	it's a shitload
S0024	i would struggle with that because i take too long
S0144	i be
S0024	do that kind of thing
S0144	with the individual ones i use to do fifteen fifteen a day they're the same length as the group ones
S0024	what be that last semester
S0144	so i i have yeah i have erm yeah about seventeen
S0024	what two thousand word
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh my god
S0144	have about seventy five to mark
S0024	mm
S0144	plus individual comment for each one
S0024	mm
S0144	plus then like and put the grade into the computer
S0024	mm oh
S0144	it's
S0024	i might i might do a few bite of hint about the place i don't want that to be leave to chance
S0144	but i i be tell that it it get move around who do it one year and then
S0024	really
S0144	well that's what i'm go
S0024	why do you know how to do it better now
S0144	well
S0024	you've already do it once surely it would be easier for you to just keep do it in the same way
S0144	i dunno
S0024	wouldn't it
S0144	what else be there to mark i cos that's all i've do be the essay i've never mark the exams here
S0024	well you've maybe you won't be do it this semester then
S0144	and i've never do of the speak
S0024	do the exams the exams be like summary write oh no erm with the with the read and write exam erm yeah you just do the the read bite it's just tick isn't it or it's either right or wrong that's it and then the write part they write a short essay in the exam and that's it and then so you mark that there's a read there's a big read and they write a short essay answer to the question be you eat my clothe why and er and then with the speak one you do the speak test and then you and then you have to also mark the summaries that they've do in the listen test so you have listen test to do too so the speak be quite difficult as well i'd say
S0144	mm
S0024	because you go in you've get all those hours
S0144	yeah it's all it's all swing and roundabouts
S0024	yeah
S0144	don't i don't care what i get
S0024	don't you i just don't fancy those big ones cos of my time management be not good anyway hey ho
S0144	anyway we've get a few months before that
S0024	hey ho oh god that one on the end of her nose just look awful she's like a little rudolf she look like she's get a big zit on her nose
S0144	don't squeeze it

S0024	disgust pig
S0144	oh
S0144	so the vision people must have like
S0144	when they're listen to this
S0144	we sound like a couple of
S0024	well you
S0144	slobs

S0024	but i they enjoy do that
S0144	they do
S0024	and they find it helpful i'll do that too
S0144	cos it be the only productive thing they do i the whole class i find
S0024	ah really oh okay
S0144	they need some part of the class where they're actually sit down and write something cos it be a write lesson wasn't it
S0144	and they're never write for a whole
S0024	oh god oh
S0144	it's just all theory that stupid head noun question
S0024	oh god see
S0144	that confuse the hell out of me
S0024	well at least you do something good with them of the
S0144	mm
S0024	i i don't why haven't why hasn't that be change surely people complain about that question
S0144	mm
S0024	last term
S0144	yeah
S0024	you you've get to say well the noun phrase okay the question be ask you what the know phrase be after the verb and what the head noun be if i'm walk around it look like you've write what the head noun be or the first the noun phrase before the verb which be the one that's correspond to the verb so it's just why isn't it question there and they've all do it so you can't get out of it they all do it wrong they all go the verb the noun the head noun that go with the verb because the question's kind of like ask you what's the main verb
S0144	mm
S0024	and then what's the head noun well
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's a stupid stupid stupid question but nobody else seem to be bother by it none of the other lecturers
S0144	no i i still don't get it so the first one be say what's the head noun of the noun phrase
S0024	mm
S0144	after the verb
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	although that shouldn't technically be call the head noun
S0024	mm
S0144	well it's the head noun
S0024	it's
S0144	of that phrase
S0024	of that phrase
S0144	and that's it
S0024	yeah
S0144	not
S0024	mm
S0144	of the sentence of that phrase
S0024	yeah
S0144	so they do all that think okay that's the rule and then they turn the page and say actually
S0024	actually you need to look at the other noun
S0144	look there's another noun here before the verb this be the head noun
S0024	that correspond with the verb
S0024	that correspond with the verb so do all the other nouns not correspond with the verb
S0024	which nouns
S0144	well the ones on the first page
S0024	the first page no they don't match
S0144	they don't match with the verb
S0024	they don't match with the verb because they go with the other nouns that come after the verb
S0144	so the head noun be always before
S0024	no i dunno that's the head noun of the noun phrase after the verb
S0024	but the question look like you're look at the verb and you're look at the noun and they they're look at the head noun like the the noun that correspond to the verb for the whole sentence
S0144	yeah
S0024	but because oh because that make sense
S0144	yeah
S0024	but you've get to stand there in class and say well actually this question doesn't really make that much sense what some of you have put this this and this and i write up by the verbs okay what some of them have
S0144	mm
S0024	put for the head noun in the first of the noun phrase it's stupid
S0144	mm
S0024	and they're all just sit there with their mouth open and go oh okay and then we have to move on because i'm i couldn't explain it
S0144	but you can't explain it
S0024	any more
S0144	cos it doesn't make any sense it's the first page
S0024	what when you say
S0144	of their book and you tell them
S0024	yeah the first page of their book oh this be a crap question
S0144	yeah
S0024	you can't you have to say oh some of you have put the answer for the other noun phrase let's have look at that oh god really mm
S0144	so the hang on so just to carry on with that again quickly cos i've get to teach it again tomorrow
S0024	mm
S0144	so the first page they just want the head noun of that phrase so communicable diseases diseases
S0024	yeah
S0144	be the head noun of that phrase that's it
S0024	and the question say look at the noun phrase after the main verb
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm so that doesn't have to match the main verb
S0144	no
S0024	basically but then you turn over the page
S0144	yeah
S0024	and it say find the head noun erm look these be head no it it just talk doesn't it it doesn't even give them an exercise
S0144	this be what a head noun be
S0024	these be head nouns the head nouns tell you the main idea and they match the verb that's what it say on the next page
S0144	yeah they match the verb
S0024	mm
S0144	but the ones on the previous page didn't match the verb
S0024	no
S0144	and they're call head noun
S0024	they're call they be head nouns of that noun phrase
S0144	yeah but that's what it should say head nouns of the phrase
S0024	yeah
S0144	and head on the next page head nouns of the sentence
S0024	well i don't know be that what you call them head nouns of the sentence
S0144	mm
S0024	i guess so yeah i
S0144	but i don't think they should be call head nouns on the first page at all
S0024	no
S0144	it should be like the dominant noun or the
S0024	mm
S0144	the most oh i dunno another word because head noun be the technical name but you're talk on the on the sentence level
S0024	i don't know i don't know
S0144	yeah i can't believe that's there
S0024	but i know that i've get an american girl tomorrow in my class that be bind to have some question about that activity
S0144	yes it's it's embarrass when you've get shit like that
S0024	and on the first
S0144	mm
S0024	well the second lesson yeah
S0144	cos it take me age to she cos i didn't see it at first
S0024	i should have warn you last night
S0144	and i be just
S0024	i saw it and i remember from last year
S0144	yeah
S0024	i think you
S0144	and then i have a student come up and half time and and say well hang on a minute isn't surely threat would be the head noun cos that match the verb
S0024	yeah
S0144	why be it diseases or something and i be like oh er mm yeah
S0024	i wonder if there's another terminology for the head noun of the sentence oh i don't know
S0144	well at least i've i'll be able to cover my arse a little bite tomorrow with that
S0024	but you've get a relational be it call a relational clause the first one be a relational sentence so it's there be blah blah blah bah diseases so the first one be correct yeah
S0144	right
S0024	you'll find that they've all give the first one as a correct answer it's both the head noun of the sentence and the head noun of the second noun phrase
S0144	mm
S0024	cos it's a there be clause
S0144	right
S0024	there be sentence or whatever i've forget what you call those relational sentence
S0144	i don't know yeah
S0024	relate to the world for something what be it call
S0144	there
S0024	there be
S0144	there be don't know
S0024	oh well anyway yeah so you'll find they've all get the first one right and all the rest wrong oh it's just a bad bad question
S0144	who write that
S0024	bad question
S0144	jesus
S0024	and nobody else have say a word about it people be just go and i don't know i be gonna ask someone today and say look what do you do about this how do you do this but
S0144	well you should write it on that feedback the weekly feedback thing
S0024	yeah okay
S0144	it's what you're suppose to do i didn't write anything on it last year
S0024	i write a little bite
S0144	so it's my fault this problem's still here
S0024	it's everybody's fault the problem
S0144	well yeah
S0024	be still here
S0144	yeah but i remember we i remember last year we
S0024	i never do the first few weeks
S0144	remember do this
S0024	but after that i do few
S0144	do you know
S0024	less
S0144	i haven't do a single one
S0024	say he look at every single point though so
S0144	mm
S0024	so it's a shame if cos he want to change the his he do make some change to the book
S0144	he basically the reason they show that be to get the verb agreement thing right yeah cos that's a common mistake
S0024	yeah but
S0144	so why not teach something that actually
S0024	be the
S0144	go directly to that rather than some
S0024	why
S0144	confuse the fuck
S0024	well
S0144	out of them
S0024	why don't they look at the head noun of the sentence or the head noun of the first
S0144	mm
S0024	noun phrase be it a mistake in the book should it say but then the answer be on the powerpoint so ah i dunno they should be look at what's the head noun of the sentence what match the verb i mean they're look at
S0144	mm
S0024	the main verbs which be all they're see these like they aren't the most excite verbs but they're excite noun phrase
S0144	be that what you say
S0024	no but all of it's all to be isn't it like i say well you don't need interest verb no i didn't say that like that i say you don't need see you don't need interest verbs in academic write so much you need interest noun phrase
S0144	yeah
S0024	you need all the information in the noun phrase
S0144	yeah
S0024	not i the verbs
S0144	yeah
S0024	i dunno i say something i can't remember
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0144	okay that's enough talk
S0024	i don't know
S0144	about work
S0024	yeah i know it's
S0144	it's
S0024	oh i've get to plan for tomorrow yet
S0144	right well
S0024	be it alright then
S0144	eh
S0024	okay enough about work
S0144	yeah
S0024	we shouldn't be talk about work at all at home
S0144	well we have to blow it off sometimes don't you i know well you do you're a woman
S0024	what
S0144	well if i wasn't do this record i would just go in and stick some music on and go in my cave
S0024	what you wouldn't be talk to me
S0144	no
S0024	that's really mean
S0024	you wouldn't be talk to me if you didn't have to
S0024	what
S0144	oh
S0024	i think you need to make up with me for that i don't like that
S0144	no i'm pull your leg
S0024	eh
S0144	i'm only joke
S0024	no you're not joke
S0144	i be joke
S0024	you're not joke she's asleep now i'm gonna put her down
S0144	so we're not go for a japanese or
S0024	well i think you say it be too pollute to go out
S0144	well you just have a look on the thing and it be alright
S0024	but they be burn a field near here you
S0144	burn a field's not bad be it
S0024	yeah a lot most of the pollution come from burn rice field
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm yeah two type of pollution one from burn the field one from the construction both just as bad as each other actually the fine particles the two point five particles in the air most of that come from burn field
S0144	mm
S0024	mm but to grow rice you have to burn the field why it's one of the problems they've get in china cos they grow so much rice
S0144	mm
S0024	but then they didn't have this problem in vietnam and they grow enough rice there it's the construction too isn't it
S0144	it's the construction i think they probably shift a lot of the blame onto the burn the rice because they know that nothing can be do about that and the people who need their rice
S0024	they accept it yeah
S0144	they'll accept it more than say yeah everyone's die of cancer because we're build a load of build
S0024	mm that we don't need
S0144	yeah people will oppose that
S0024	mm
S0144	people would
S0024	they will need them when the population increase again
S0144	hang on they'd need the population to double to fill these this area
S0024	it will double people be allow two kid now
S0144	it well these place will be only build to last ten years
S0024	oh well that's a bite pointless then isn't it
S0144	eh
S0024	that's a bite pointless then they only just bring in the law that they can have more kid
S0144	look at the state of it i mean like one of the sunday plazas that they're knock down i bet that's only ten years old they just don't build them to last everything's so temporary
S0024	well what will happen
S0144	it's cheap
S0024	it won't fall down will it
S0144	well they they're the first one will probably fall down and then they get everyone to move out
S0024	no
S0144	no
S0024	although i never forget those ones in korea that fell down
S0144	no yeah
S0024	because of the cement
S0144	yeah well that's
S0024	mix cement with paper
S0144	yeah
S0024	i dunno they do some shit
S0024	what be it mix cement with something
S0144	yeah i i wouldn't be surprise if they're do stuff like that here at all korean standards be a lot higher than the chinese standards
S0024	mm but they
S0144	so get know what
S0024	they do have
S0144	they're do here
S0024	big strong metal rods through build now don't they like especially tall build
S0144	well it's suppose to you don't see them
S0024	oh you're scar me now
S0144	no i mean look how shoddier this workmanship be

S0144	get those big crack i know they be only on the er like the thin wall i mean that's not a big thing but just look at this place
S0024	yeah i know what and you think the people who build it
S0144	i mean what what's this gonna look like in five years
S0024	yeah
S0144	and then you compare that to a home that's build back you know in england for something
S0024	mm
S0144	which
S0024	this be suppose to be posh and it's just not be it
S0144	it's a shit hole
S0024	yeah it's weird isn't it
S0144	say this be what worth two hundred thousand pound i can't see how that's possible surely
S0024	no i don't see how that's possible
S0144	if it be then you know we be right on the crest of a bubble at the moment and when this pop these people that have buy these place be gonna they're gonna be in a whole world of shit
