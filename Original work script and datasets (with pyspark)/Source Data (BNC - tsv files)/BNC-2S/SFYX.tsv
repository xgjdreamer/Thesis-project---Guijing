S0486	there we be good morning
S0491	good morning
S0486	erm and erm i see from your form that you be bear in in australia
S0491	mm yes
S0486	so can you tell me er erm how er how old you be when you leave australia
S0491	yes well if i can go back a step just to explain both my parent er be english
S0486	yeah
S0491	or be english and they meet on a ship go out
S0486	right yes
S0491	and erm my father be a clergyman and he'd sign on for five years of poverty chastity and obedience in a what be call the bush brotherhood in
S0486	right right oh
S0491	and erm so it be a bite inconvenient really that he meet my mother go out but anyway they keep in touch for five years and at the end of his five years of go around the bush erm he they get marry
S0486	right
S0491	and er and then the war come and he be a chaplain in the australian army and then erm we live in two two parishes in and come back to england when i be seven
S0486	oh right
S0491	and that be quite hard for my mother because she'd leave all her family behind
S0486	right
S0491	cos the whole family have emigrate but not together she'd go separately erm so anyway that that's what happen and and we end up in actually because my father have to look for a parish and for us to live somewhere erm and so i spend most of my childhood in in just over the border from actually so we use to do our shop in so come to live in be a little bite like come home
S0486	yes i see it's it's it's a a bite weird because we've get similar circumstances cos my father be actually erm he he become a padre in the army erm but but he be also a vicar and we move from when i be seven erm and erm we go to germany for three years
S0491	really
S0486	and another thing that i can draw a parallel with be that when we come back from germany cos he do three years that's all it be a sort of er appeal from the bishop for erm clergy to go abroad and when we come back there be no live for us and we have to look for one and that be extremely difficult we end up live in
S0491	oh goodness me
S0486	isn't it strange
S0491	well there's a bigger coincidence because when we come back from australia we have to sort of stay with various people and we come to and stay in erm the on the edge of the park can't think of the name of the road
S0486	erm
S0491	yeah we catch with a former colleague of my my mother's and erm dad go to see the bishop of
S0486	right
S0491	to look for a live
S0486	really
S0491	and one of the live that be available be
S0486	be it
S0491	yes
S0486	how weird
S0491	that be probably not just after your father leave it because i'm i'm a lot older than you so it would've all happen before
S0486	right before how weird
S0491	yes yes
S0486	isn't the life's full of coincidences isn't it
S0491	it be but it but i think i don't know why he decide against it it just didn't feel right presumably and we end up actually in a lovely place on the coast near
S0486	oh oh wow yes
S0491	he have two parishes
S0486	oh right course be very i mean the war the horrible war story there and the tragedy of yes
S0491	yes yes yes well at the time that wasn't the facts weren't really know
S0486	ah it be all secret then wasn't it
S0491	it be a bite secret
S0486	yeah
S0491	and er but while we be there erm the commemoration erm stone be put up but still people didn't really know the full detail unless they'd live there all their live and and i don't think anybody ever tell us how it really happen
S0486	right no no it's come out a lot recently hasn't it
S0491	it have yes
S0486	erm and erm you know it it be one of those things that you just couldn't they just couldn't erm they be have an exercise i believe weren't they
S0491	yes yes
S0486	and then the come up and and and saw them exercise and wipe a lot of them out it be just terrible
S0491	that's right yes yes yes
S0486	erm but you must have have a a very interest childhood what do you what do you remember of australia then
S0491	erm well just a few impressions really erm er not a lot i remember go to school and it be rather sort of marshal we have to do exercise in the playground we go in to to music
S0486	yeah
S0491	erm and i just remember play and er remember do in a vicarage which have have a tennis court but it be terribly overrun and er overgrow rather erm my parent decide they'd have some chickens but of course the wire net have all go in the corner and all the chickens escape so it be pretty
S0486	oh right yeah
S0491	erm i have lot of cousins and i still do and i get a little visit from time to time
S0486	right
S0491	in fact erm at a recent count i have seventeen first cousins
S0486	really
S0491	yes
S0486	seventeen
S0491	but they live a long way away
S0486	yes yes
S0491	and and er so we didn't see them often but that that be nice so i i vaguely remember things but not not anything very spectacular i remember the plan visit of erm i think princess elizabeth as she then be
S0486	right oh right
S0491	we be all issue with medals which i still have
S0486	oh
S0491	but she but she didn't come because her her father die
S0486	oh
S0491	erm i do remember that i remember be attack by erm kookaburra
S0486	oh right
S0491	but it it's put me off bird fly around for life
S0486	i'm sure i'm sure
S0491	erm but they be a little bite possessive of their nest
S0486	yes
S0491	erm but i can't really remember many things i remember sort of visit to other members of the family and
S0486	yes what about erm do you ever go sort of on on a sheep farm or erm one of those large sheep farm they have in in the centre of australia
S0491	no
S0486	no visit there
S0491	no we be in
S0486	right
S0491	i suppose there be sheep farm but i don't remember them as be anything very special
S0486	yes no no
S0491	i do remember have to take a plane to get to sydney a little tiny plane
S0486	oh right yes
S0491	that be cos that be quite a long way away for us
S0486	right er be you be you interest at all or have you read in in the past the work of nevil shute
S0491	yes yes
S0486	and a town like alice
S0491	well that be i think the town or the area where my father be and so it be very interest
S0486	oh be it yes oh i've i've be i've rediscover nevil shute a while ago actually
S0491	ah
S0486	i read them all when i be about sixteen and i've rediscover them all a while ago
S0491	yes
S0486	erm and i've start reread them but i really must keep up on that because it's amaze how clear they be in my head yet still i miss so much in my memory and go back to nevil shute be wonderful
S0491	mm mm yes
S0486	erm and of course it's what i'm go forty year forty years ago when i read the last book and and of it's even more er of an era almost vintage stuff really
S0491	yes yes it's a good idea to go back and reread because i think the first time you read you read for the story don't you
S0486	yes you do yes
S0491	the second time you you read as much for the story as for the detail or the detail as much as the story
S0486	do you find that too with watch drama on television because some of the morse for instance and the lewis erm series i don't know whether you like them but erm we find and the frost the good series a good drama series we find that we don't watch them when we watch just one for the second time which we try not to do but we do i always say to my husband i'm watch them for the act i love the act the way they play the part so it's so good and how they inter react with the other character and that i find absolutely fascinate which like you say i'm not look for the narrative because i know really what happen cos i've see it before
S0491	mm mm yes ah yes yes yes
S0486	erm you you see the erm the frisson between erm lewis and er his sidekick erm and how they talk to one another and the body language and everything be just right er and and also the actors have evolve that over time they've start to work together so much that they they're actually in a relationship as the part rather than act the part
S0491	yes
S0486	so it's very good
S0491	oh yeah yes that's that's an interest aspect my my husband doesn't like didn't like morse he didn't like his voice for some reason but erm i enjoy cos we live erm in before we come here and i've work in
S0486	oh right
S0491	and erm i look for the bits of
S0486	yes
S0491	and that that make it fun
S0486	yeah and that really do make it fun i mean in the same way i go to school in eventually and they do the eddie shoestring series from
S0491	oh right oh
S0486	and i mean that's a long time ago and that be all around at all place i know and there's that wonderful feel of you're actually involve in it because you know the place so well i walk down you know every day or whatever
S0491	yes yes yes
S0486	erm and so there be that lovely feel
S0491	yes
S0486	but tell me about then tell me about erm your work cos
S0491	right well i go to because i be i be work in and then get interest in cleave palate
S0486	oh right
S0491	and there be a erm well be a centre of excellence for that so i i apply for a job there and erm it be very interest work in cleave palate though thing be there's well the whole job be just too huge for one person to do and we be terribly terribly underfunded erm for speech and language therapy and erm yeah i be pull in the direction of cleave palate but also neurology neurosurgery elderly paediatrics
S0486	right
S0491	it be it be impossible and look back it it you know i i find it erm difficult really to see how i actually get through it all
S0486	yes yes of course yes of course
S0491	it be but anyway the i try to give the cleave palate priority erm because i be work with a a surgeon who be very very eminent and do research and and erm that involve me as well to an extent but it it be it be quite hard but be in i just love i just love go out at lunchtime if i have the time to just walk through the streets and and look at the architecture and everything it be it be really beautiful
S0486	yes
S0491	we live in a village outside er seven or eight miles out near
S0486	right
S0491	and erm so travel in and out be be quite difficult traffic be dreadful
S0486	yes it's like i mean we've just be to for the weekend and oh my goodness the traffic be a problem and we decide the hotel we usually stay in have get so expensive cos they've have a refit and so and i decide to to stay outside and then that's a problem cos you've get to keep get in all the time
S0491	oh yes
S0486	erm but we go to some really good lecture erm the erm it be really really good erm so we enjoy that but get back to then so the question i'd like to ask you about cleave palate erm how do you manage obviously there's so much surgery involve with cleave palate so obviously you've get to wait until the end and the surgery's be do be do so you can start work with the patient on their speech
S0491	well erm not exactly because you would attend the combine cleave clinic
S0486	right
S0491	erm where there be a surgeon and maybe an orthodontist you know
S0486	right
S0491	erm and others involve in the care and in fact i would see erm the moms and erm just on their first the baby's first admission just to say hello who who i be and as a the surgeon would have explain what be gonna happen erm but with this surgery the recent surgery much many of the children have normal speech
S0486	right
S0491	it be fantastic but i my job be to monitor that
S0486	right yes
S0491	and if there be any sign that any more input be need
S0486	right
S0491	erm at a certain stage then i would i would be involve not personally necessarily because erm the hospitals cover a wide wide area include at that time
S0486	oh yes
S0491	so i would contact the local speech and language therapists and ask them to do some work with a child if necessary erm but the result erm be very much better in the later years i work there for ten years in the early years there be a type of surgery which erm leave a very good result as far as parent be concern but less good speech result
S0486	right yeah
S0491	we do some some research and look at that and it be quite clear that that be not the way to proceed
S0486	no
S0491	and so the surgeon erm work erm very early in repair the cleave
S0486	right right
S0491	so the child have a normal anatomy to use as speech develop
S0486	yes yeah yeah oh erm i suppose the the the most vital part of it all and i use to work on ents years ago
S0491	oh do you
S0486	yeah it's close up the hole in the cleave isn't it
S0491	yes
S0486	so the the the whistle and the noise isn't isn't come down through through the open
S0491	yes yes
S0486	erm and i always think and also then obviously food get inhale and it it it must be a terrible thing to have
S0491	yes it be and the the the feed be a real problem for some children
S0486	yes
S0491	there be various teats as you probably know
S0486	yes yes
S0491	various ones develop for for cleave children but erm the surgeon i work with be close the front of the cleave very very early
S0486	right
S0491	so the child would have a normal hard palate to press the the tongue tip against
S0486	right yes
S0491	erm they use to make plat to put into sometimes didn't they to close erm the front palate
S0486	yes yes
S0491	but i don't know i i'm now very out of date because it's so it's ten years since i retire and it's oh a very long much longer time since i have any contact with cleave
S0486	yeah yes yeah and so you go on after that to do erm a more general erm you know stroke victims and that that type of
S0491	yes i i when i come here to erm i come to erm and work here for ten years er because i want to do some management
S0486	right yeah oh right
S0491	so i manage as speech therapist there in and that limit erm my own clinical work
S0486	absolutely yeah
S0491	but i be expect to do fifty percent clinical work which be i mean sheer impossibility
S0486	yes i can understand that
S0491	erm but anyway i do keep up a little bite of cleave work but mainly work in community hospitals
S0486	right
S0491	with elderly people
S0486	right
S0491	but they're not necessarily elderly people some be people with younger people with voice problems
S0486	right
S0491	erm and well anyhow the head injuries like that ongoing rehab
S0486	yes yes yes
S0491	so in in a way it be a good thing that i have to keep up my my clinical work because after ten years i'd felt i'd have enough of work as a manager because the budget be get tighter and we be expect to do more with less basically and of course the situation's get much much worse since i leave
S0486	yes oh yes
S0491	erm anyway i want to work part time partly because i want to spend some time with my husband
S0486	yes yes
S0491	he have be retire oh a very long time and also my mother be ninety live in so we decide to go back to
S0486	right right ah
S0491	and i get a part time job in community hospitals
S0486	oh
S0491	and i work there for eight years and it be lovely i work three days a week
S0486	yes
S0491	they give me a day for mom and a long weekend so we could enjoy
S0486	yes
S0491	and i i just love drive around and i love meet the people in community hospitals
S0486	yes
S0491	and after be a manager i really relish the erm clinical again
S0486	yeah i can see that you do because as soon as you start talk about it your face light up and it be like oh this be the best thing i've ever do be it the best thing you've ever do
S0491	yes erm i don't know i enjoy the challenge of the management and i i think i achieve a lot well it be impose the change be impose
S0486	yes yes
S0491	but we we go along with them and do them and i think end up with quite a good service
S0486	great
S0491	which then get cut and they'd break up
S0486	ah yes
S0491	and anyway that's but yes i think i become a better clinical therapist in a way have be a manager
S0486	yes
S0491	it make me think differently
S0486	yes
S0491	erm i always think value for money when after be a a manager er and do my clinical work you know if i'd would it have be worthwhile erm which make me in a way more objective and i be more easily able to manage a a pretty impossible caseload because of that
S0486	yes
S0491	erm and i think people also because i be then older erm they enjoy relate to somebody older who have life experience because so many of them would say oh wow she be such a sweet young girl you know therapist
S0486	yes yes
S0491	but she be so young you know i think the young therapists be remarkably mature when i compare myself eh with them when i be that age they be amaze people and erm and very academic these days
S0486	yes
S0491	but i think be older help also in you know when you're relate to to the families as you as you do and to carers at residential nurse home
S0486	mm yes
S0491	they have a bite more respect for you cos you're older and you've obviously see life
S0486	absolutely
S0491	and i suppose you have more confidence as well
S0486	well that's right that's right i mean the confidence only come with experience
S0491	yes
S0486	i mean it's it's erm it's it's like you go to a young doctor and erm he hasn't really learn the trick of the trade yet and they're i mean there be in in all walk of life ways of do things
S0491	yes
S0486	erm and erm you know er i just change from a very young doctor to an older doctor erm because erm ah i my erm my er care be mismanage to such an extent that we lose our erm our private medical insurance
S0491	oh
S0486	erm i be give a a a drug that give me a erm stroke and tia erm just a small stroke you know
S0491	mm
S0486	erm but i do i do on two occasion i report speech erm i i couldn't think of the right word and also my speech be slur and erm i erm i report it oh you know give i think it's a bite slurry my speech oh he say oh no no give it another go and i i do and then i have the stroke and then erm and then erm we be be in the process of retire and we be leave the company scheme after thirty thirty five years the company erm medical insurance scheme and we be go on to somebody else and erm my doctor i have the stroke the the the erm the actual scheme come into effect on one day erm and it be the day erm before i have the stroke but she insist that i'd have it earlier and he put it down and therefore that be the end of my insurance and he couldn't see that from a humanitarian purpose but an elder doctor would have say when do you have the stroke would've take my word for it and er but it make a huge difference and that be it so now i can't have private health insurance
S0491	mm
S0486	and so but but there's be lot and lot of mistake in that regard there've be so many mistake with that surgery that i couldn't stand it any longer and it be more stressful go to them so now i've book in with another doctor who well unfortunately i saw him for the first time last week and he's okay he's much older i i didn't choose him they they they won't let you choose
S0491	oh yeah
S0486	i want a female actually i think it'd be much better at my age if i see a lady doctor i mean it'd be much better but they wouldn't anyway there you go
S0491	mm
S0486	erm and so we go on you know
S0491	yes
S0486	but erm it it's just erm yes it's it's
S0491	that's a really awful experience you just have
S0486	erm just interest what you say about value for money and also the two aspects of that and the way your face brighten up when you be say erm about that because in the last two years run the gallery be the best thing that i ever do
S0491	oh be it
S0486	and every time anyone ask me about it i brighten up and say it be the best thing i ever do and value for money be key point because if people be come in to buy art which they do erm i i make sure that the artists didn't ask unrealistic price for them for two reason really one that you want the artists to sell and they're not famous so they're not gonna get a huge amount for it and secondly the the member of the public can come at the shop and say great i buy a piece of original art and it didn't cost me that much and that's such a wonderful thing
S0491	yes mm mm yes
S0486	so that's what keep people come back keep the artists come back and keep the erm buyers come back
S0491	yes
S0486	so there you be but i mean they use to very interest picture up there
S0491	oh
S0486	be that something that you do
S0491	no no that be my mother's actually
S0486	oh
S0491	erm it be always in her lounge
S0486	right
S0491	and erm when she die i say i'd really love that and it i think it go rather well in here with the with the dark beam and other things
S0486	oh it do definitely
S0491	erm i just i just love it i love paint and picture which be not too definite and cos you can keep look at them and see different things
S0486	yes absolutely well the horizon and you're look towards the horizon and i be listen to a video by erm my i i go to on a monday for erm an art course and there be one by someone call who's really quite good i didn't realise i saw her website last night and she be talk about horizons and how everybody like horizons and look towards them because everybody want to look into the future and be elevate by what they see and imagine what's beyond that side
S0491	oh yes yes yes yes
S0486	and it sort of it's sort of romantic version erm those do you think they be hang on those
S0491	i think they must have be but they're just just there i suppose
S0486	yes yes take down away or something
S0491	yes
S0486	it's a nice isolate scene
S0491	yes
S0486	it's the sort of scene you get over the talk from to it's that sort of thing
S0491	yes yeah
S0486	in the there be a river which be wonderful
S0491	yes
S0486	so erm so what now now you're retire then what be your hobbies here
S0491	i don't have too many hobbies i'm afraid erm i do go to an art group well it be a class
S0486	right
S0491	er our teacher be lovely and he but he be a commercial artist and he get too much work which be lovely for him
S0486	right good for him yeah
S0491	erm and then we continue to meet as a group but to be honest i never want to to do any paint
S0486	really
S0491	no it didn't a lot of them would say oh i can't wait to get go with the paint
S0486	right
S0491	i just didn't feel like that i think perhaps although i do one or two things which i be amaze at
S0486	yeah
S0491	erm i i'm not artistic really i don't have a gift for it and i think i'm always a little bite worry about waste time and be dissatisfy with what i've do
S0486	well yes it put yourself in the right situation for it er teach completely differently to anyone i've ever meet erm what she do be she give you exercise to do and that sound really bore erm for me if if someone have tell me that i would never have go to the class right
S0491	no yeah
S0486	it's very hard to explain she's very insidious in her ways of get you to do things and you don't realise that you're do them you see
S0491	yes right
S0486	so erm she show us a picture last week of a of erm well several erm picture of of the new york erm skyline the chicago skyline and they be all in silhouette so they be just black and she ask us use a rigger and a flat brush to erm give us a demonstration she do a demonstration to everyone very very simple to just try some brushstrokes with these brush to make this erm skyline or make a skyline up
S0491	mm
S0486	well honestly it it i mean say to me you can sell that he say it's so good you could sell it nice it be an exercise erm and erm but be produce things they could sell just with these two brush by do things not plan just let it happen
S0491	no oh
S0486	and erm she paint horizon picture but it's very much it's very similar to the atmospheric work in that paint up on the wall where you've get the sky and and so on so you might enjoy that class
S0491	yes i don't think i'll go
S0491	no i i come to the conclusion that really i like be with people
S0486	yeah
S0491	when i go to an art class i mean you have but basically it's not chat i like talk
S0486	yes
S0486	oh it's lovely to talk to you it really be and i i actually approach the library long before i get interest in this i approach the library in and ask them if erm if i could run the art of conversation class and erm what we would do be just sit down and choose a topic or several topics depend on which one wear out the quickest and talk about it because there be an awful lot of people around who want to have a conversation but when you're in a a partnership for a long time you sort of almost become the other person you be actually think what they're think and you actually don't have as good a conversation as you might do with a stranger which be obvious really you don't know the stranger do you
S0491	mm yes yes yes
S0486	so i want to start it and erm they say well we we do this knit and natter
S0491	oh
S0486	and i say no it's not it's not gossip what we're talk about be we might actually discuss erm for instance what's go on at the conservative conference or talk about women priests in the church or my goodness anything
S0491	mm
S0486	but they just couldn't seem to and they say would you be charge for this and i say well obviously i'd have to ask people for the money in order us to pay for the room i can't just you know so i would do it free but so i be think about that but no erm they say well we we'll put it on the board with the friends of the library but when i think they be do origami and knit and natter i say no i want to raise the game a bite and talk about something else so erm
S0491	yeah
S0486	it do it fell on stony grind
S0491	yes well what i do i have quite a lot of friends and i seem to have fill the diary with you know meet one or two the one i go for a walk with and one i and couple i meet for coffee
S0486	yes ah yes
S0491	and my other interest apart from garden and stuff
S0486	yes get things do
S0491	yes erm and and also i want to be free to to go out with say it's a lovely day or something
S0486	yes of course that's it
S0491	erm so i don't want to to tie myself down too much
S0486	no
S0491	erm i do go to keep fit on a friday morning
S0486	right
S0491	i've be away so i haven't be for a while but that be quite important i suppose
S0486	when do you do that then

S0486	oh yes i go for a couple of weeks the dance to music thing
S0491	well it's very dancey isn't it

S0491	yes yes
S0486	well it's a rise pink colour it's it's amaze it's really nice
S0491	yes
S0486	erm so erm we i i don't really remember it i don't know whether it's do you remember a fashion show be stag in church years ago
S0491	no i don't think i be here then
S0486	well there be a young from hospital and erm it be all she be she run a christian group at and and i use to go erm years ago and erm i'm sure she be involve in it and and that's how i get the invitation and they they actually put erm it be when they have the pews they actually put board all across the top of the pews and the model walk all over them over the pews
S0491	oh
S0486	and i remember think at the time this be a bite strange for a church and they be sell you know i'm i'm terribly mindful of i mean we're talk about erm seventy eight erm nineteen eighty early nineteen eighty we're talk and i remember you know what jesus say about the moneylenders and and transactions go on in church of course nobody take any notice about that now we've get we've get cafes we've get erm gift shop and all
S0491	yes
S0486	i can't believe it how how the church as an institution have divorce itself from christianity and i find that very hard to to to take on board erm and yeah so yes i be i remember be absolutely amaze and i go to it be a very nice erm i think maybe a lot of these erm items have be make locally erm i buy a skirt which i wear for a long time a patchwork skirt which be very nice but i i often say to my husband he say do you really think that they would have allow have allow that to happen at erm because the other thing too about church be er just very briefly i'm sure you've have enough by now but erm just very briefly
S0491	it's very interest
S0486	well erm my husband and i meet twenty one years ago
S0491	oh yes
S0486	and erm we be both erm you know quite mature by then and er he and his parent have live in this area for years and he'd be an altar boy erm for years at church
S0491	uhu
S0486	and erm he erm we be we be live in erm and erm we be go to get marry and and he say well i'd like to get marry at church erm although i haven't be because i'm you know er well he use to go to the eight o'clock quite rightly but he hadn't be for a while
S0491	mm
S0486	and it be during the interregnum and we ring up and the secretary tell me there be no chance we could get marry at church i think when i think think of the time after my mum die and and erm for four years i to my father while he be vicar of and i have to i be nurse full time and i be clean the house make all the coffee for take all the over the phone let the people out in the hospital and have the undertaker ring me up when i get home for four years i don't know how i survive
S0491	goodness me
S0486	and then and and you know and then they weren't even marry me at church and i i plus i didn't have the fortitude to explain to her a bite about my life it just make me so totally angry and i think that be typical of bureaucracy and not only in the church but in the nhs in everywhere i mean yesterday we go to have for a meal and we could only eat so much and we could only drink coffee for this special price and in the end and i didn't have anything any of this special price food which be eight pound a head it's just bureaucracy go mad so we sit down and eat this meal and the thing the meal which be just two small meals come to seventeen pound and and erm it be only in a garden centre oh but you've get to have this this and this and if you deviate you've get to pay the full price
S0491	oh
S0486	and it be just like that and i think where be bureaucracy it's go completely mad in some case
S0491	well it's a good thing my husband isn't here because i we have a similar well not as extreme erm an experience about get marry as you do
S0486	yeah
S0491	but i'd live in this village in in erm for some time and i'd be secretary of the pcc i'd do the gift return i've be a bell ringer i've clean the church
S0486	yes yes you've do a lot
S0491	come to get marry and we go to see the vicar and he say well i'm afraid cos have be divorce before we couldn't do it
S0486	oh right yes yeah
S0491	and that's why i write to the bishop
S0486	right
S0491	and erm i felt well well i don't know i'm not bother how how it's do we'll go and go to a registry office and we'll have a service bless afterwards which we do
S0486	yes
S0491	and the vicar everybody their service free and we have a
S0486	yeah sound lovely
S0491	everybody do all they could to make it nice but have never get over the fact fact
S0486	yes
S0491	with all my background
S0486	exactly
S0491	erm we couldn't get marry in church
S0486	no exactly well my father when he be vicar of he he make it his business to marry divorce people i mean he be it wasn't really then the thing to do but he have lot and lot of people who come in and he he always marry them
S0491	mm
S0486	and erm it be just the way he felt about it
S0491	well i'm sure he's right because in fact first wife leave him
S0486	right so
S0491	and okay they probably he be at fault to some extent but how on earth can clergy gauge whose fault it be
S0486	exactly no exactly you can't
S0491	no
S0486	and it it's like people look at you in life i mean as you get older erm and you're retire and they don't know that you've be a brilliant speech therapist in your life they don't know that i actually have write three play and be to drama school i've be a you know i've get three professional qualifications
S0491	wide range life haven't you
S0486	yes well it be because i be on my own for so long we didn't get marry until our mid forties you see so erm it's because i've be on my own for so long and i think well blow it i read a book once call anybody can do anything and erm it be about this girl be quite a crazy book i can't really remember but she would take a job and then she would erm decide well that's not really interest i'll do something else and she'd just go on and on until she get bigger and better job basically well i wasn't really work towards that plan but things tend to happen to me in my life good things and very bad things like everybody but erm it it do enable me to erm to try a few things out and erm you know i've have my you know i've have my highs and i've have my low if you have very big highs you do get very big low i be just read nicholas parsons' biography
