S0324	yeah sure
S0325	thank
S0324	you can have some of that juice yeah
S0324	erm i'm really annoy that we only get four options
S0325	i know that's probably cos they make the gcses harder
S0324	yeah i know so it's probably for better
S0325	yeah but still i don't actually know what i would have take though if i hadn't take if i have another option maybe i would have take
S0324	i would have take geography
S0325	okay
S0324	cos i don't have any humanities
S0325	oh yeah well that's not a problem be it sort of
S0324	no it's not
S0325	well
S0324	mm
S0325	you don't need a humanities
S0324	mm yeah and i wouldn't really use geography that much
S0325	yeah
S0324	i don't think i don't think i really want to be a geographer
S0325	what do you want to be
S0324	erm probably a designer
S0325	oh
S0324	like an industrial designer or an architect probably what do you want to be
S0325	i don't know
S0324	and just
S0325	probably like dunno something to do with english or something
S0324	i think you should be like a reporter or something
S0325	or a journalist like
S0324	yeah
S0325	like
S0324	yeah
S0325	yeah exactly
S0324	you'd do
S0325	a much better job than
S0324	well i like 's blog
S0324	well erm it's not very well write
S0325	well on her newer lipstick one she say today i'm gonna
S0325	i'm gonna
S0324	talk about lipstick
S0325	yeah she delete her er outfit of the day string
S0324	i never saw that one
S0325	didn't you who be show it to you
S0324	yeah should have
S0325	mm it be really funny
S0324	yeah well
S0325	i think she's get no followers still
S0324	yeah plus
S0325	and all of the view be just mine
S0324	or mine
S0325	mm
S0324	yeah it's but it be quite i can't imagine how like actual famous bloggers how they actually start out because
S0325	mm
S0324	it's really hard to find like followers
S0325	mm
S0324	and people to read your blog because how do people find out about your blog
S0325	i don't know
S0324	unless you're like their friend
S0325	mm
S0325	like zoella
S0324	yeah
S0325	but she have load of people on her blog and that's why
S0324	yeah that's why she start on youtube
S0325	mm and now
S0324	yeah
S0325	she doesn't do her blog the last time i go on her blog like the last post she do be about advent calendar
S0324	that be quite a long time ago
S0325	mm
S0324	mm
S0325	and she always complain she be like oh i do have a blog to run and stuff but she never actually
S0324	mm she never actually
S0325	mm
S0324	do her blog yeah
S0325	i think like also it would be really hard to find things to talk about
S0324	yeah especially original things to talk about
S0325	mm
S0324	because what do you talk about
S0325	not just er
S0324	unless it's like a diy blog and you have to try and think of like fun crafty diys
S0325	mm
S0324	each week and if it's like a blog like zoella you have to try to think be of like beauty things or something each week
S0325	mm that
S0324	like how
S0325	not everybody's do
S0324	yeah exactly cos yeah it's really hard to be original i think
S0325	yeah
S0324	i think it's probably hard to run a blog
S0325	yeah
S0324	i wouldn't
S0325	well
S0324	be able to find i wouldn't be able to
S0325	mm
S0324	think of enough things to do really
S0325	yeah i don't think people like bloggers earn that much money
S0324	mm
S0325	i think only when she start on youtube that she could
S0324	yeah probably cos then each time someone watch it you'll get money basically
S0325	yeah
S0324	through advert
S0325	she get like twenty thousand a month or something
S0324	yeah yeah cos she have like millions of view
S0325	and and erm the other day i be watch an emma blackery video with luke and erm
S0324	and didn't she er on
S0325	it be like emma and luke versus stock image or something and it be really funny cos she be put lipstick on him and he be like i'm zoella and then she be like i don't think zoe sound like that and she be like alfie alfie
S0325	and he have a banana and he be like this be my banana erm i get it from a shop and that's it and then
S0325	cos he go ten million view
S0325	it be really funny
S0324	yeah that's basically all you do on youtube though
S0325	yeah
S0324	you just have like
S0325	they don't even work do they
S0324	and favourites and stuff it's like
S0325	yeah
S0324	oh this be my favourite lipstick of the month or whatever and it's
S0325	i know they don't actually do anything
S0324	it's not very interest like if you think about it
S0325	they're like i don't have a perfect life i've get a really hard life and like you just sit there for an hour
S0324	yeah i'm so jealous of their job
S0325	yeah
S0324	because
S0325	they literally just don't do anything
S0324	they have to make a video like once a week that take like if you do a full out day you could do it in a day
S0325	yeah and edit it and be
S0324	and then have the rest of the week off
S0325	yeah
S0324	and you can do whatever you want
S0325	and
S0324	you make load of money
S0325	yeah
S0324	like she just like zoella just
S0325	you see her vlog she's go shop
S0324	yeah yeah she's just get like personal shop in topshop
S0325	in topshop
S0324	i be and and she buy like load of stuff from topshop
S0325	yeah
S0324	and like
S0325	and she's probably spend like two hundred pound
S0324	yeah
S0325	every time she go in there like every day
S0324	i'm really jealous of their job
S0325	yeah but then i'd also feel like i'd get a bite bore
S0324	yeah so would i
S0325	and shop and
S0324	cos it's really hard to like as i say before think of original videos
S0325	yeah and then
S0324	and it's the same with blog and and youtube
S0325	what else do you do for the week
S0324	yeah exactly
S0325	nothing
S0324	it's bore
S0325	well apart from
S0324	like i would like to have some time off but not a whole week
S0325	mm
S0324	of just and you could even like spend a week and film seven videos and then you have seven weeks off because you've get
S0325	yeah
S0324	videos for seven weeks
S0325	yeah you only need one every sunday that's like ten minutes long
S0324	yeah and then if you choose to you could do like two videos a week
S0325	mm
S0324	but still that's only
S0325	and none of them actually do
S0324	yeah exactly
S0325	danisnotonfire upload like once every month
S0324	yeah same with zoella basically
S0325	and everybody's get a book louise be bring out a book it's
S0324	i know
S0325	so annoy what
S0324	it's life with louise
S0325	dan and phil
S0324	or something
S0325	dan and phil
S0324	yeah
S0325	louise zoe
S0324	zoella

S0325	but the
S0324	the only one i want to read be carrie's
S0325	yeah

S0325	well i like carrie
S0324	yeah i like carrie
S0325	i wish i could meet her

S0325	i know even though like
S0324	of meet her
S0325	i don't know if i would want
S0324	and she doesn't even like
S0325	like her
S0324	like carrie or
S0325	i know
S0324	watch her videos or anything and then she meet her and it's like oh i love carrie so much
S0325	yeah even though i didn't really like their blank space cover i think it be
S0324	neither do i
S0325	especially them like like at the start it be really slow and sort of like
S0324	yeah and i didn't think the harmonies work
S0325	harmonies work
S0324	very well and they be like clash and sort of
S0325	yeah but it be fine
S0324	and they be shout
S0325	yeah basically it's fine in the middle or something but not from the start
S0324	mm
S0325	to the end they didn't do anything but harmonies
S0324	yeah exactly
S0325	it be like mm
S0324	and some of it's okay like the bridge i think be okay
S0325	yeah
S0324	and like there be some other bits which be quite good
S0325	yeah but not like the begin or anything and the bite where they be shout in like the chorus
