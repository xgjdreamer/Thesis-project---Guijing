S0261	there we go okay
S0262	alright
S0261	so er now it's on
S0262	okay
S0261	we be on this be
S0262	so let's just pretend okay
S0261	yes
S0262	the
S0261	so we're start with three shape which represent
S0262	the three three core competences of the business
S0261	yes
S0262	okay not in any particularly well yes no it will be in a particular order
S0261	right
S0262	this represent technology
S0261	yes
S0262	social media technologies
S0261	right so this be er about communication
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	so it's about use technology to good effect
S0261	yes
S0262	off the back of that
S0261	make the most of be able to spread the word
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	exactly erm off the back of that because i've already make a start and there's other people who i can draw in erm to come into the academic world so this represent a an academic world and academic world be important because if you really get the end game be on the erm the er publish company erm most of the way i think you actually get to do this sort of work be when you've be hang around here and get to know people in the right place
S0261	er publish in academia
S0262	er publish in in people buy book like your study skills book
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah okay yeah
S0262	study skills that's what i'm
S0261	yes
S0262	well know for
S0261	right
S0262	so this actually funnily enough be erm really what i wanna do er to publish i i want to do more work in this area of how to argue
S0261	right
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	okay
S0261	yes
S0262	there's a lot more that can be do in this area and i know that cos i've be work in this study skills learn skills area for three and a half years
S0261	right yeah
S0262	okay so i know that business quite well
S0261	yes
S0262	so this be
S0261	yes
S0262	and this how we get the students to tell us what they want so we do our market research by get students involve in tell us what they want
S0261	yes
S0262	we get we get that information and we kind of cherry pick the bits that we think be useful for us and
S0261	yeah
S0262	in term of move into the academic realm and hobnob with the right people that mean go to conferences and shit
S0261	yeah
S0262	and then when erm you rub up again with erm academics who know people who be already in with the with the publish company erm you make the sort of erm you know business step into you know a fully and what i would call a digital a digitalise you know publication you know it's a it's it's go to the next realm of what we be look at in term of china and and and vietnam not necessarily on language proficiency though i do think language and arguments do go together
S0261	yes
S0262	so i can see that i can teach people language but i can also teach people how to argue
S0261	mm
S0262	more effectively
S0261	yeah
S0262	in academic world
S0261	okay
S0262	and we could even go to secondary school with this as well so cos it's poorly do so that's what i think be how it could work
S0261	yes okay so you're interest in deliver a message to the mass about how to learn or the the context of learn within er university
S0262	mm
S0261	er and other institutions or or university university
S0262	we'll keep it to universities for now
S0261	so you'd start there
S0262	mm
S0261	so it's kind of like how facebook start
S0262	mm
S0261	that start at college basically
S0262	mm okay
S0261	and and everybody so that they test an idea within one crowd and and within moments it have spread to all these other unis that want the same system so and of course there be others who like to be involve and think that they be there first erm so yes test it within er a university crowd be probably a reasonable context and what what be it that you're seek to try and share the message of and take out of what do you get out of it
S0262	okay well
S0261	so if you're if you say that
S0262	in social yeah
S0261	you've get people who er you would choose to interview
S0262	okay wait so social media erm typically where what we've be look at erm be be like say he's get a message er he respond to people
S0261	mm
S0262	he do respond but he's basically the person deliver the message yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	i i don't see any other people around right now what i like about the interview technique be that it put people normally if you're really good at it it put people on an equal level of contribution
S0261	mm
S0262	and erm what you'd call collaboration knowledge co construction of knowledge right
S0261	yeah
S0262	so yes i do want students to deliver me message more importantly i want them to come to that site and and and basically put in er you know an email request for me to interview them about something that they think passionately about in term of the higher education you know realm of study and learn and erm and i ask them question on it and then i'm get the message loud and clear that oh shit things aren't really that great and if anybody else be watch they can have benefit from that too primarily i'm mean to be benefit from it because basically i'm the one who's run that work that erm that website
S0261	yeah
S0262	okay so i don't know how all the ipr stuff work i have no idea but yes essentially i'm create a platform where people can come deliver their message to me and i'm not deliver any message there be a another side to it though and i think outsource could be useful here be that
S0261	can i just be clear about what message be people try to
S0262	right so in this book in this article
S0261	yeah
S0262	it talk about and you need to read it but it talk about student engagement and disengagement so i deliver a message at the begin of my website which explain the mission of the website the mission of the website be to get students to deliver message or ideas on how to engage at university and to stop disengagement from occur at university cos at the moment we're experience high level of attrition in the first year because students be not engage with what's go on when they're learn they're not give options to actually engage it's a fundamental problem for all australian universities at the moment
S0261	so really that that sound like a er a mothers' meet it sound a a place where people share their problems on that er
S0262	no no it's not cos there's gonna be a dogma yeah the dogma's gonna say you're allow to you're allow to mention the name of your university but that's it you're not allow to mention any name okay you're
S0261	you mean persons
S0262	yeah you're allow to talk about the success of what your university be do to engage you in your study so this one be gear up for success story it's not bitchy and moany and whine
S0261	right okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah and that okay and that's fine and so in that context you can get others involve who aren't students who help teach the students about the the bigger picture
S0262	well also success breed success so if you see that erm perth a western australia university be do a student erm film festival and then the other students see that over on the other side er east side of of the coast and go well why don't we do that
S0261	mm
S0262	we should go and ask the people who be mean to be engage us to allow us to do shit like this and give us money so that we can run our own student film festival
S0261	mm uh mm mm right and so if you look at where you start from yeah there you've gotta create some kind of database of information to start with and that you need to find a mechanism to spread your message before you start
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so there be certain lead elements before you actually go live with the stuff that you're do
S0262	okay
S0261	and have you get a picture in your mind of when you would like to make that happen
S0262	yeah i want this to happen in i want it to go live in yeah i'm flexible by about a week but essentially erm i yeah no oh yeah okay no i i need it to go live i need it i need it to be launch in that week that
S0261	well frankly you're dream you're talk about the six week period that we have available before we go to august yeah what be it that you want to launch rather
S0262	erm
S0261	i'm not say i want you
S0262	some videos a few videos a few interview videos of students' work
S0261	right so strategically don't you wanna hit the grind like massively run
S0262	what size be you think of
S0261	well you need time to to allow the message to get out there to build an audience right
S0262	mm
S0261	and what you want be an audience to turn up on day one
S0262	i know that's why it's
S0261	yeah
S0262	semester one the week one semester
S0261	that's this year
S0262	yeah week one semester
S0261	well if you consider the amount of work that actually need to be do in the context of what else you've get to to do yeah
S0262	well yeah but let's just say that we can get some hand on you know resources of people back us to get that bite go
S0261	erm i'm not afraid of hard work
S0262	i think we be gonna outsource some of this
S0261	yeah just hear me out right
S0262	mm okay
S0261	go away in june
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah come back midst june
S0262	mm
S0261	you're talk about the six five to six week period er it's a six week period to get to there
S0262	mm
S0261	right so in that six weeks you've still get to deliver certain things
S0262	mm
S0261	and what we talk about be have say ten interview available
S0262	no
S0261	right
S0262	i didn't say ten er you say ten i never say ten
S0261	er okay so when you start erm what kind of frequency do you want to publish information on to keep up the momentum
S0262	i dunno well you tell me what do you think's beneficial
S0261	well erm you could start with weekly you know so you're do one per week
S0262	okay
S0261	and erm it it's not usual to do a higher frequency than that people who do a higher frequency than that be work particularly hard right
S0262	mm
S0261	or they have that particular focus so if you start somewhere start with one per week
S0262	mm
S0261	and er and you need to maintain a connection with your audience right
S0262	mm
S0261	so you you get your your pre message out there you create a launch platform
S0262	mm
S0261	you have a a a land page for a website
S0262	mm
S0261	which people you get people to sign up to that to start with
S0262	mm
S0261	before you get to the video stage
S0262	mm
S0261	right and you might try and erm promote that there's there's a product that they might be interest in yeah so they get access to that by sign up create a mini product which give a benefit to people right for free yeah they sign up they get the product they they see what's go on and they get an interest and then you can put out a couple of youtube videos which er which tag in at your website yeah so then you've get a visual message out there that you can steer people to straight up without go to your website but it take it back through a loop to your website so the curious go and have a look at that and sign up
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah erm and you can and you and you wanna try and create some kind of message that go through your facebook er and twitter et cetera so the it can get share
S0262	mm
S0261	amongst the social stuff
S0262	mm
S0261	so you have to get all those things in place upfront and then you want erm a a a series of videos that you've get pre prepare that you can launch to take the pressure off have to create those at those time
S0262	mm
S0261	so you launch one you're go to be deal with try to capture that market and capture the people
S0262	mm
S0261	and that's where your time's gonna be spend rather than make videos
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you've get a few make in advance you've buy yourself time to get use to that process
S0262	mm
S0261	and then and then you start create them ongoing basis
S0262	mm
S0261	so you might say oh well i've get a couple of weeks leave i need to start create some more videos so then i've get a buffer
S0262	mm
S0261	of more right erm and you'll find that information will come in that you'll want to try and adapt with
S0262	mm
S0261	to try and help streamline a few things and what have you all sort of systems you need to make sure be set up
S0262	yeah you say you
S0261	and so on
S0262	mean i er be that mean like you
S0261	well that's us yeah
S0262	oh oh okay
S0261	that's us
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm er and and sure outsource and get people onboard erm some of the stuff i have an awareness of but i've never do
S0262	mm
S0261	so i need in that june period i would be look to be use something to to to learn and create and i'd prefer to know how to do that first before i do it in real for this
S0262	yeah
S0261	right so erm part of it be what i i would have put that kind of platform together with
S0262	mm
S0261	but they weren't receptive to that but i have a quite a big big picture of
S0262	mm
S0261	it's quite a large platform of
S0262	mm
S0261	how you bash it out yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	and and you're the real thing be about try to create a strong launch
S0262	mm
S0261	and get people's email address so you're get message out to them as soon as you've get that you can create email campaign
S0262	mm
S0261	to keep people onboard they're quite that be quite straightforward
S0262	yeah
S0261	you keep them engage that way
S0262	yeah
S0261	and you can do that on a on a however many day basis
S0262	yeah
S0261	but it's really you bash out a message side of a4 boom
S0262	yeah
S0261	out there
S0262	okay
S0261	you know
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that get them interest and connect upfront and you can use other carrots to get them involve like free products et cetera and then you go boom on that day this be what's gonna happen come and have a look at us you might flash out some kind of certainly a social media message if not a media message you try and get something publish in er connect forums or page or media
S0262	yeah
S0261	that lead to your site
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you say you go to education supplement dot com or whatever it be you write a little article you get them to publish it you put stuff into their forums
S0262	mm
S0261	and you say this be who i be come and have a look at my stuff boom you're get people from all these different corner who go boom land on your on your site at the same time
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so erm and you you kind of want to you know there be technical things you need to be aware of that you know could fall down because too many people come along for the size of server that you've get available you know
S0262	yeah that's kind of cool though
S0261	and that's kind of cool but it fuck up your launch and that
S0262	sure
S0261	so you wanna you wanna get through that and keep that go so there's a there's ground for have a test first you you wanna try and test it first
S0262	yeah this be the test
S0261	you want you want to you want to take some guinea pig
S0262	yeah
S0261	and you wanna have them be the guinea pig run
S0262	yeah
S0261	for it first
S0262	okay this be the test
S0261	so pick a few pick a few students
S0262	oh i will
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah thank and er the test be semester two two thousand and thirteen the real launch will be semester one two thousand and fourteen because the semester one launch be fuck massive
S0261	right okay
S0262	it's huge orientation be when students be switch on they're at their most engage and that's when we know we've get a captive audience
S0261	mm
S0262	i know it
S0261	mm
S0262	okay i've see it be there and i've see five hundred people in a lecture theatre
S0261	okay so this test that you do here
S0262	yeah
S0261	what be you gonna do with the other six or eight months in between those two time
S0262	well interview people grow a repository
S0261	right erm and if you be one of those people somebody come along and say do you mind if i interview you blah blah blah blah blah erm we wanna use this we're gonna use it on this basis oh but we're not gonna use it for six months
S0262	no no we'll would we'll we'll figure out a frequency that will be enough to keep it tick along
S0261	mm
S0262	but you can have a
S0261	plan
S0262	you can have a mini launch
S0261	yeah
S0262	and you can have a major launch
S0261	yeah yeah you're right erm
S0262	so the ones who be the early adopters be all cool with it
S0261	yeah yeah for sure and you've get the early adopters who who who who be by
S0262	be spread the word for us
S0261	who be by definition people outside the normal box of
S0262	yeah
S0261	the bell curve anyway
S0262	yeah
S0261	so erm and that's good because that allow six months to actually build quite a significant
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm product
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah and
S0262	and the universities will never compete on that level as quickly as we can move because market be so full of bureaucracy that no one will be able to make decisions on anything
S0261	yeah the erm part of part of my concern would be with the exposure to others who could do the er the same thing in
S0262	well they can't the universities can't do it
S0261	no i'm talk about other individuals
S0262	oh yes of course
S0261	you know
S0262	they can always do it yeah
S0261	yeah anywhere yeah
S0262	so could 's one
S0261	so if you're look at try to get erm a strength in in in the market erm
S0262	i think you're right and a a product or a service attach to the interview would be useful
S0261	yeah and you and you build a series of those things as you go
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you can say in that six months that allow you to build one side of it and the other
S0262	yeah
S0261	the interview side of it and the core business side
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah and you're link those things together you're get message out there et cetera
S0262	well business be come later the business be gonna be down here
S0261	yeah
S0262	this be just a platform to get credibility in order to move into these areas
S0261	well you still want to find mechanisms to get your money in the door
S0262	yes well the mechanism well the money will come here i don't know how to make money on this
S0262	i don't even know how 's make money
S0261	hey fella
S0262	oh
S0261	you know yay get out of it
S0262	oi that's alright
S0261	that's alright
S0262	erm yeah
S0261	he's not allow our beer or our crisp
S0262	but
S0261	cheer mate
S0261	have a nice day
S0262	potentially sponsor hang advertise off it that's all i can think of
S0261	well yeah yeah well
S0262	but we need to pick 's brain
S0261	well look look in in term of of websites right
S0262	yeah
S0261	they do typically what's call affiliate market
S0262	yeah
S0261	so like what that other guy be do he be hang different products off his site
S0262	mm
S0261	but it's such that if somebody click through your site to go and purchase that product he would have get a commission from the software company
S0262	mm
S0261	so it's a kickback yeah for send people in in in their direction
S0262	mm
S0261	so what you would do
S0261	be you would identify key part that er erm key erm key company or key outfit that you would want to connect to
S0262	mm
S0261	and what you're try to do be you're get exposure because you be actually you wanna use their email list their contact you wanna draw them in as well
S0262	right
S0261	yeah
S0262	okay i i'll need to check with about how to do that cos i don't i don't know how to do that but i will ask him how to do that but i've get a couple of ideas in mind
S0261	well i know how to do in an internet market way
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah
S0262	but we can also get some free advice from about
S0261	mm
S0262	how to do it cos i think he do that day in day out so it would be good to touch base with him and
S0261	yeah for sure
S0262	yeah
S0261	and i think get a a sound erm independent outlook
S0262	yeah
S0261	be good
S0262	get some measurements in throw in there cos that's what company want to see
S0261	yeah
S0262	how do you measure this
S0261	mm
S0262	that's what you don't know but do yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah exactly
S0262	okay so let's have him
S0261	and then
S0262	more as a sort of you know cursory kind of advisor
S0261	mm and we want to be able to capture some metrics as we go
S0262	yeah absolutely
S0261	yeah
S0262	so i have get a couple of ideas of how to do that erm of cool port be er make you think of you know water but similarly erm if you take the idea of port be an airport right
S0261	or a portal
S0262	a portal yeah i'm think port mean something like you know port it's a place where you arrive it's a place where you kind of get off at a destination that's why we get the idea airport harbour port you know
S0261	you're say well you pitch this to an international student say you're arrive from outside of this place
S0262	so one of my dogma question in the interview be so sarah tell me what's so cool about study in where you be
S0261	mm exactly
S0262	and she get hey montreal be like blah blah blah blah blah blah
S0261	mm mm
S0262	and oh sydney's fantastic because blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
S0261	mm and so people
S0262	and if you go to
S0261	get this international feel for it
S0262	so plan
S0261	mm
S0262	that's what kid get on these days buy er plane ticket and they go somewhere
S0261	mm mm yeah
S0262	so i'm think airline carrier
S0261	oh as an affiliate
S0262	mm
S0261	well could be that's one one option yeah of the myriad sector you could choose
S0262	well i mean it would only happen if it be a majorly successful site
S0261	yeah
S0262	it's may as well aim big there
S0261	well you wanna be aim high
S0262	i'm aim very high
S0261	mm
S0262	i'm think new air new zealand or qantas or someone else air er if we go asia pacific
S0261	virgin
S0262	who virgin yeah alright
S0261	er if wanna kind of think flamboyant and think entrepreneurial and think the kind of people who like the spirit of entrepreneurs virgin's a good outfit to run
S0262	mm
S0261	if you get somebody like branson say hello
S0262	yeah
S0261	you just have to get him to say hello
S0262	mm
S0261	because he would like the idea that you're send business his way er through some educational mean or maybe he wouldn't he hat the education
S0262	do he
S0261	yeah he doesn't believe in the well it's not that he hat the education he doesn't believe in the the concept of of business school et cetera
S0262	but this be about students tell us
S0261	mm
S0262	what they want he like that he like have
S0261	mm
S0262	customers tell you
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	what you want
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	what they want
S0261	yeah no i'm i'm let's not suppose that one but yeah that in the round that sound quite strategically interest erm so you're say er a small launch that be focus on a bunch of people so like we talk about have a list of a bunch of people that have a strong network contact so then you can start build
S0262	i think it should be thematic as well
S0261	through their
S0262	i i actually do think month in month out you should we should be pick theme so one theme could be you know tell us about something recent that you've do that you've engage with outside of your curriculum you know something like that but much catchier
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	and then another theme might be you know tell us about something cool that your lecturer do the other day you know or tell us about some educational technology that you didn't know about and how you you know so the theme be always about engagement but i know i know so much about engagement that i can pick off probably twelve theme that i could cover throughout the year
S0261	yeah okay erm i i think start with theme seem reasonable and then as you kind of get through it you you probably wanna mix things up so it's it's less kind of chunk chunk chunk
S0262	i want a box where people can write in to me and suggest theme like so frank so people write in say you know
S0261	well that's what you use your test crowd for upfront
S0262	mm
S0261	you'll ask them their opinions you'll get their feel you see what they like and try them on products and see how they react to it get their feedback all of that kind of stuff
S0262	don't want too much cos students have get a completely minimal attention span
S0261	yeah well you're probably try to draw in those who will react like that say if it's strength on
S0262	yeah i don't want it too hard straight away though we need to make it as fuck easy to participate as possible and i know that basically
S0261	yeah well that that's what you're try to to test
S0262	yeah
S0261	you're try to test whether your your ideas be be align with what they think
S0262	yeah

S0262	mm
S0261	before you do the major launch and that's what i'm say with the six month period you look to try and optimise that so when you do go bang you go bang with a big bang

S0261	academic lecturer somebody who's
S0262	academic lecturer it's somebody who's really work in the environment and know what you know students be up against
S0261	mm
S0262	but can also give a little bite of themselves and say you know yeah but i'm i be i'm try to do stuff like this but it's not so easy because and they give some reason why
S0261	mm
S0262	so mainly to do with universities but you don't slag off the universities you just let so this person be go to be call be go to be faceless be not gonna have a face i'm gonna be the face yeah
S0261	right
S0262	not two two compete face but he's gonna have a voice and he's gonna be a podcast voice okay
S0261	oh so he's gonna be like the stick
S0262	fantastic i'm so glad you've get that but do you know what his name's gonna be sage
S0261	spod
S0262	sage
S0261	sage
S0262	sage on a stage
S0261	right okay
S0262	wise one whatever
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	and sage be gonna be the word of reason and reflection so what happen be that i interview the person the student and we have that nice dialogue go and then sage will listen at a later date and he will he will er review sorry he will
S0261	the footage
S0262	he will listen
S0261	mm
S0262	will make some note and then he will record his erm
S0261	response to that
S0262	response to that
S0261	and what do you do with that response
S0262	and then i post it up so that's another little side bite so interview and then maybe a day or two later i don't know how the trickledown effect will happen
S0261	mm mm
S0262	but you've always get a follow up
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	you've get another reason for go back and have a and and listen
S0261	yeah yeah i i i i like that
S0262	you've get that
S0261	you can say
S0262	yeah
S0261	like in a couple of days it and and never make it a consistent number so people don't get use to
S0262	exactly
S0261	it be there
S0262	it's just
S0261	but within a week
S0262	yeah
S0261	you say at some time during that week it become quite random
S0262	mm
S0261	that you you you you post this thing in response to the the item of the week
S0262	yeah
S0261	and when you post it that that be do through an email and distribution as well as it go up on that website
S0262	yeah
S0261	so people go well this week we have this you've get the link to the web
S0262	yeah
S0261	the the video so people can come and watch the video
S0262	yeah
S0261	and then you've also get the link that go to the response
S0262	yeah
S0261	to that
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so then you've get a story to tell we have an interview with x y z
S0262	yeah
S0261	these be the point
S0262	yeah
S0261	and then this be the feedback or that this be some reflection from guest lecturer blah blah blah blah blah
S0262	yeah
S0261	that that that
S0262	i mean don't tell them too much cos you really do want to
S0261	the sage from the the sage
S0262	yeah you just give them a log line of about three word and then they've get to go and listen to the podcast on the website
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah but what it however it's format
S0262	mm
S0261	and how whatever it look like but you can i can get the gist
S0262	okay
S0261	that's quite cool
S0262	so the thing
S0261	mm
S0262	about it be then be that
S0261	what's in it for the lecturer
S0262	oh well we'll come to that in a minute erm sage sage have get to have a personality because he hasn't get a face
S0261	mm
S0262	so sage have to have a narrative work around him
S0261	yes
S0262	okay otherwise he's just gonna be fuck bore
S0261	well you can make it sound like a podcast
S0262	yeah well it will be a podcast but what i'm try to say be i'm create a persona for sage here
S0261	yes yeah that's right
S0262	cos he hasn't get a face he's like an avatar in a way
S0261	mm
S0262	but not cos i don't hate avatars okay
S0261	yeah
S0262	so he won't have a cartoon face he will not have a face he will just have a voice okay so that's something that students be gonna feel a bite wary about but what be we gonna tell them about sage hang on let me have a go cos i'm i haven't have a chance
S0261	i haven't say anything
S0262	well you be about to sage be gonna have two things go for him okay to appeal to the male student audience he's gonna love test drive cars and the other one for the female audience who be gonna have a really kind of like you know over sort of imagination about who this fella be yeah there's gonna be a question about i haven't really kind of get it right yet but it's something like along the line erm you know who do you think sage most resemble in your role in a role er not a role model but erm you know it'll be better than that but it's about basically you've get to put up photograph of who you think sage might be okay so we're gonna have things call wiki survey and then you always click between two choices and you're get this interaction go on where students come in they'll listen to the interview and then they get to be interactive and then get to click which car they want test drive next time or which car they think would most be coolest to test drive okay so when sage start his little piece about the reflection piece he's always start with it's format yeah so i be drive along the other day in my or in a you know test drive whatever car yeah blah blah blah blah blah and i be think about sarah's interview with you or whatever and this be my response so it always start with drive along in a car or a motorbike
S0261	yeah okay cool
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah alright
S0262	so the reason why i want that to happen be because i want students to engage with the personalities that i've present to them
S0261	well sage could be richard hammond
S0262	yeah
S0261	cos he love science and education
S0262	sage could be anyone it's just a voice but sage actually have to be quite clever
S0261	mm
S0262	he can't be somebody who's a bite of a nonce cos he's get to be able to articulate between what the students be tell him and what he fuck know about how universities actually work
S0261	yeah okay mm
S0262	so he's get to be an inside job
S0261	yeah
S0262	but he can't be too inside on the outside
S0261	mm
S0262	cos people start get a bite wary about it
S0261	mm
S0262	even though i clearly work from university
S0261	people don't need to know that
S0262	ah well this be then this be gonna be the interest thing isn't it credibility anyone say they're a learn advisor but credibility be about you're a learn advisor at which university
S0261	at a university
S0262	no but think about it you your english fella university he could spread that all around
S0261	mm mm mm
S0262	well what do he get out of that well what do they get out of that so that somebody want to go to university because they've see his website
S0261	maybe mm yeah it's interest so well it sound like there's quite a lot to do before this end of july
S0262	and that's just the begin
S0261	yeah i know
S0262	mm
S0261	so
S0262	do that frighten you
S0261	oh i i don't know that it frighten me i'm just try to think realistically that's all
S0262	well we this be an ideal version you know
S0261	yeah i know i know i know i know i know know know and and there's no reason why it what be the rather what be the reason why it have to be before er that end of july that's the start of a new semester be it
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay
S0262	it also mean i maximise my erm time at university
S0261	yes erm i i kind of think before you get to that semester you you wanna have a few things in place that be already kind of there
S0262	like
S0261	well it's like when you're try to say to somebody you want to steer them to a certain place that they want to see that others have already be there
S0262	that's how no i've get really good
S0261	that kind of thing
S0262	student contact
S0261	mm
S0262	trust me
S0261	mm
S0262	we've get people who i know would turn up tomorrow and do an interview with me and they'll be fascinate
S0261	yeah yeah i'm not i'm not worry about that
S0262	well that's the content that's the bite i do
S0261	yeah what i'm say though be you get to semester one and you want to be try to launch something
S0262	mini launch
S0261	mini
S0262	yeah
S0261	launch yeah and so this mean you you you're actually try to constrain anything or be you
S0262	no
S0261	no you're just do a mini launch and see where it go
S0262	yeah
S0261	right so you take that where where where do it go and before you launch you wanna have already engagement with things like your social sit yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	on a small level but so at least at least that it look like it's be use
S0262	of course
S0261	it's not brand new
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so erm
S0262	so we need er seeders
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	and you need outsourcers
S0261	mm mm
S0262	that's where you come in
S0261	yeah yeah that's right but i i just need to get a context of of er how how much work you expect that you'll be do and how much you think i'll be do
S0262	i'll i'll do everything i can in the hours that i've get to make this happen
S0261	right okay
S0262	and i will really really rely on fuck massive favour from people to get it to happen for that for that launch
S0261	mm
S0262	and we will be away in the uk for the launch so that will be very advantageous
S0261	in which context that that you you're er already put in place a system which be which be others will be deal with it
S0262	no you and i will be deal it you you're test this rebel location right that's what i think we be do
S0261	yeah yeah no no no that's fine so you wanna test it from afar
S0262	yeah absolutely
S0261	yeah that's okay
S0262	remote that's what we're talk about
S0261	absolutely that's fine
S0262	yeah
S0261	that's absolutely fine so you get to you get to get a a kind of a full dog hog kind of understand of
S0262	plus
S0261	where the
S0262	we'll have three weeks
S0261	's studio
S0262	hang out with my dad who'll be love it my brother will come up have a look
S0261	mm
S0262	and he will totally engage with it
S0261	mm
S0262	and he will just start pump ideas in
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	he might even give us people
S0261	mm
S0262	to connect with and make it even better
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	so we've gotta be on the uk grind so can be readily available to help with it
S0261	so that's what you're interest in try to get a a a a right buy in from
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah okay alright i can now i can understand actually why the deadline's
S0262	yeah
S0261	that deadline so erm i mean my first focus obviously be to finish the stuff or and that's gonna be shove anyway but i've set a date a few days before i go away and we need to pre plan and have other things in place for when i go away as well
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah we make a big list so i think it's kind of a case of have to crack on but do a bite of each every day
S0262	yeah
S0261	rather than do that chunk and then do that chunk and then that chunk
S0262	yeah
S0261	i mean there be priorities but erm
S0262	we'll we'll give them
S0261	you need to do a little bite each day so you don't kind of find that it's a struggle
S0262	give the give the new er impetus we can now revise what we talk about last last yesterday and we can reprioritise okay so erm you know we'll we can have that as conversation another day what i wanna understand be if you think you've get the skill set to deliver this
S0261	er explain what what you expect to be deliver
S0262	a website
S0261	and
S0262	erm a fuck cool website
S0261	carry on
S0262	erm and all of the directional traffic around it go straight lead into the website
S0261	er okay so you're talk about any peripheral stuff that help fee traffic into the site
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay so i mean the it
S0262	i hate those fuck ball cos they could just come
S0261	oh they it's not gonna come over near us
S0262	be you sure
S0261	it's alright they're way over there one's wear an english rugby jersey
S0261	and the other be south african yeah and they've get an aussie football ball
S0262	bite confuse
S0261	yeah it's a bite of shitty oh no it's er yeah it be it's a anyway that that aside erm yeah so there's actually you know if you wanna make it work properly there's quite a lot of work in all of that and and can i make it happen of course i can make it happen i'm gonna be learn a lot along the way and that's great cos i've always want to do that i've want to know how it work as a whole system
S0262	yeah
S0261	and i can actually start get a better credit and credos by do you know this be where i sit outside the box with a lot of these people they just do that i go away and i do that
S0262	yeah
S0261	and it's gonna be the same in this case i do that to start with
S0262	yeah
S0261	not this
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that's where the project management awareness and skill come in
S0262	yeah
S0261	and really it come down to you look at it and you go well i haven't get time to do this so i i have to outsource it
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah and it's better probably to start with and you say well we'd if we set a budget of x that that money be some of it be set aside for get others to get certain things do for us
S0262	yeah
S0261	and in some context i would prefer to use some of the people that i know can do it but if there's a price
S0262	it's up to you
S0261	then
S0262	if if that's it's
S0261	i'd go somewhere else and try the outsource thing
S0262	but i see there's clearly define roles that's your role that's
S0261	yeah
S0262	for to decide
S0261	absolutely fine but you understand that we need we might need some money to be able to
S0262	yeah
S0261	facilitate that to make that easy
S0262	yeah
S0261	and probably it's easier to do it that way and get good product
S0262	yeah
S0261	straight up
S0262	okay so who want to be in control of that money budget thing
S0261	well i think er just need to schedule a a bunch of things and say well which bits be i gonna do and which bits be we gonna outsource and then look at relatively how much of my cost
S0262	who want to be control of cost
S0261	i'm happy to cost everything
S0262	okay cool
S0261	er we obviously can i have a beer
S0262	mm
S0261	erm we obviously erm talk about and share all that before anything get spend but erm i think if if you say for er that period of time if you say you have five hundred dollars you'd do well with it yeah and and the aim be obviously to spin it down as best you can and get the best quality out of somebody so erm
S0262	i might need some flyers do just for when you're go around to different part of asia or when you're in cities and things and you maybe you know just have a postcard or something that kind of have you know the actual and then maybe you know a very succinct kind of mission statement of what
S0261	and a website
S0262	website
S0261	like an oversized business card
S0262	yeah so you can hand it out to students
S0261	yeah yeah for sure
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	that would be really useful
S0261	mm
S0262	cos we need that trajectory over into erm er asia pacific
S0261	yeah and exactly and so
S0262	and in new zealand i can do the same
S0261	mm
S0262	when i'm in hopefully i will go and find some students in university and they will just hand out flyers
S0261	yeah yeah yeah exactly
S0262	so we get them come in straight away
S0261	mm so that kind of stuff need to be design what's the content what's gonna go on it
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm you know and and you you hit at things with you know we're gonna have a launch date and that's er so before you get that hand that stuff out you wanna you wanna land page up
S0262	mm
S0261	on your website
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know
S0262	well well we really want what you do with you just want people to know to go to the land page and put in their email address
S0261	mm
S0262	that's really what you want
S0261	yeah that's right and i can use that same template if that's what you like and i can make it look better than it do for them
S0262	well if it speed the whole process up then yeah use the same template
S0261	well it's it's it's a template call launch effect
S0262	right
S0261	yeah and part of the thing that don't use but be in the system be that each person who sign up get a code and if they then pass that code on to their friends and their friends sign up then the system record that they're they're the the create affiliate
S0262	right
S0261	so then you say well you look at the top five of them and you go well we're go to do something for these people
S0262	okay
S0261	and you could say the carrot could be you could be one of our first interviewees
S0262	yeah yeah absolutely now
S0261	something like that
S0262	there's another part to this which do need someone a little bite more long term outsourcer okay
S0261	carry on
S0262	so you know when we be talk about how erm that fella erm keep find all these tool on the internet and we reckon he didn't do that himself that he just get someone to do it for him close up on facebook
S0261	yes
S0262	i need to have a learn advice forum i need it where students will come in post something up go
S0261	yeah
S0262	i don't know how to i don't know how to do reference
S0261	and then and and others and they'll interact yeah so you want there's a part of your website a forum that that punters can sign up register and interact on
S0262	alright but i
S0261	like a wiki
S0262	i need to be there every now and then like you
S0261	yeah but you can drop and drop out
S0262	sure
S0261	so that's exactly what happen on
S0262	but i don't want that person to really think that
S0261	location rebel
S0262	exactly but i don't really want that person to be me i want it to be somebody else
S0261	yeah that's fine well many people on location rebel for instance get pay to do that stuff
S0262	excellent
S0261	right so but you want somebody who's in education basis
S0262	i could get to do it for a little while
S0261	
S0262	yeah
S0261	great
S0262	she's smart
S0261	yeah and and she'd be interest probably
S0262	she be always a good student
S0261	yeah she can write
S0262	could do it
S0261	yes exactly so you want yeah and and er the idea be to try and get people to do it on a friends voluntary basis
S0262	mm
S0261	don't have to pay them anything
S0262	just to start now exactly
S0261	yes erm
S0262	but with a view that eventually when it really kick off it could be a steady little income a little side thing
S0261	well it it could it could be yeah exactly erm and hire one of the location people to be his person who do all that
S0262	his bitch
S0261	yeah well she no she she sound quite nice she's just kinda she's really helpful
S0262	but we could also use and as seeders so they can run around and write up stuff in various place and facebooks and
S0261	absolutely of course and
S0262	you know you give them a list of things to do
S0261	yeah
S0262	they just do it in a day
S0261	exactly we need you to fee into this forum we want a a little article that we can post on this over here
S0262	mm
S0261	and all of that kind of stuff
S0262	both of them can write really well
S0261	yeah yeah so anybody that you feel happy with try to get involve and that fine absolutely and i'm happy to be the go between to make sure that the the organisational message go out to say this week we need to try and do this be you available to do this
S0262	yeah
S0261	let me know what you can do
S0262	yeah
S0261	or you can't do
S0262	yeah
S0261	and if you have two or three people then you just share the wealth
S0262	yeah
S0261	absolutely and that's good for us because then we're manage people
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that's all a part of what a company's about
S0262	yeah
S0261	and it's better to do it with people that you can rely on that you don't have to pay much for
S0262	yeah
S0261	and
S0262	pay them in kind anyway there's always a way to negotiate these things
S0261	yeah yeah well the the kind for could be well will teach you how to do a website
S0262	yeah exactly
S0261	or whatever
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know and that's fine by me
S0262	i mean i could also erm you know proofread 's er thesis you know in kind i can always do stuff for her
S0261	yes exactly

S0262	no erm and er then we go to the conference and we start rub up against people connect to these people 's and other people
S0261	right
S0262	so that's the lead time
S0261	okay so what be it that you hope to get out of er an opportunity to publish stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	digitally
S0262	yeah and i'll tell you who's gonna come in on this
S0261	do you think you'll make any money out of
S0262	fuck yeah with i don't care who they be i'm just tell you this be the this be the be just a publish company i don't care who they be i don't need any publish company 's massive
S0261	yes i know that
S0262	so i don't care if it's or macmillan or whoever it be right
S0261	do you make any money out of publish through
S0262	we make
S0261	another company
S0262	yes we make
S0261	well can't you self publish
S0262	ah now then you're talk right but that's really really long term and the people who could potentially not get us in this area but leapfrog over into the self publish area yeah be and
S0261	in yeah well look you know the reality be be a lot of people be self publish now and
S0262	i need
S0261	and and and
S0262	i need name i need big name i need two three doctorates be a doctorate 's a doctorate and so be
S0261	mm
S0262	i would have to be catch up with them then
S0261	er you're talk about publish academic article
S0262	publish study skills book on how to argue and by the way that i've i'm think a little bite different here i'm not just think a digital version of this
S0261	so you're talk about those be distribute amongst educational institutions
S0262	yeah
S0261	rather than something that's a self help book for students that they buy off a bookshop shelf
S0262	yeah this be sell back to it's
S0261	or through amazon
S0262	it's do do what you want but sell to mainly the ones who've get cash which be the institutions cos they've
S0261	so that's base on volume
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so why wouldn't you just steer the students to buy straight off a web website and self publish
S0262	alright do both students always have to buy their own textbooks
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	but do you know what something else happen
S0261	mm
S0262	be a lot of the time the institutions yeah don't fuck know how to teach so what they do be they buy the licence to the textbook so they actually put that into the syllabus of their unit
S0261	yeah okay because that tell the appropriate story
S0262	and they get the student to buy a subscription so they get to practise it
S0261	right mm so if we be to write down some some first hand core action that need to happen before i go away
S0262	yeah
S0261	we talk about what we might do while i'm away but we'll come back and reassess that yeah erm so we need logo design we need this er hand out a a leaflet
S0262	a flyer yeah
S0261	a flyer you want a land page for the website
S0262	mm
S0261	erm we want we want fb and twitter feed sort out
S0262	mm
S0261	and google plus
S0262	mm
S0261	do you use google plus
S0262	mm
S0261	mm okay that's good i haven't get my head into yet but i need to the idea be to connect all this stuff together so the message be much the same they're just spread amongst it
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah erm
S0262	so i need to come up with the message er okay my stuff can you write down what i need to do as well so i need to have the introduction to the land page
S0261	yes
S0262	i need to have a erm self intro video that explain the dogma
S0261	so be that something you put up on youtube or vimeo or something
S0262	i don't know i don't get it i don't know do you have to be on youtube do it have to be can you not have it on your website
S0261	well there look that youtube's own by google right
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you put it up on youtube it's like market you you're put it out there into the mass
S0262	alright then
S0261	and then what you're do be you're provide a message in your video to go back to your website
S0262	okay
S0261	so that's how you would get message that go through that and come back to get people to sign up their email
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah erm so self intro video and you could put that on youtube or vimeo or whatever
S0262	mm
S0261	and then you can say to people go and have a look at this that's quite you know and then they go round the circuit and if they like what they see they'll sign up erm what else do you have to do
S0262	interview some people
S0261	so how many
S0262	erm okay so i've get on the list
S0261	five
S0262	hang on a minute wait a sec alright well we'll aim for five yeah
S0261	well we're talk about one a week yeah
S0262	yeah so that will get me if it's if week one be erm twenty ninth of that will get me to mid semester break so i think there's six weeks in the first half of the semester yeah four five six yeah
S0261	do you want more
S0262	so we've get ninth of september be mid semester break so basically
S0261	so you want six
S0262	yeah
S0261	six
S0262	so so yeah shall i give you the week number
S0261	no erm that's yeah but you'd be do them june through july yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah okay carry on
S0262	but the whole point be that i can do them remotely
S0261	yeah that's fine
S0262	yeah i can do them in the the sunday night and then post them up on a monday morning just like do
S0261	yeah but you need to edit them
S0262	no he say you don't he doesn't
S0261	erm what you do edit be not edit out the content but when when you film it right you've get two you've get two things you've get the the other person and you've get you
S0262	yeah
S0261	so it record both of those picture
S0262	yeah
S0261	and what you edit be you cut them together so it's like you're speak they're speak you're speak they're speak
S0262	oh right
S0261	yeah which isn't hard to do because you just go through the tape and it's like you're talk so then you show a picture of you
S0262	mm
S0261	and then they're talk
S0262	that's what he's actually when he's not talk he's still in the frame and he's drink from his white mug
S0261	let me go back and have a look at it
S0262	yeah
S0261	right
S0262	look at it
S0261	i mean you wanna cut down that crap as much as you can but let's just imagine six we've get six weeks so one a week okay just think of it like that
S0262	well let's do it exactly like how do it i wanna do it exactly like how he do it
S0261	be you happy with what you see there
S0262	yeah it work for him
S0261	yes
S0262	it'll work for us
S0261	mm okay yes so what we're say be be study er the output now he use software which be either screenflow for mac or or vodburner for for windows
S0262	yeah
S0261	vodburner cost a hundred dollars
S0262	right
S0261	you can use it as a trial
S0262	mm
S0261	so you can try it as a trial
S0262	mm
S0261	and you can probably outsource it
S0262	mm
S0261	so you just get somebody for a fiver to to to edit it together for you
S0262	alright
S0261	if you can and provide easy instructions which be when i'm talk i wanna see a picture of me and when i and he's talk i wanna see a picture of him
S0262	i actually quite i think if you find they're actually both
S0261	if it's both of them
S0262	simultaneous
S0261	then that's fine you know
S0262	that's like a
S0261	and that work
S0262	that's like a conversation
S0261	yeah okay erm so when you say interview that's x number over six weeks
S0262	by the way they're never gonna they be mean to be no more than ten minutes long
S0261	er that's what you want
S0262	it's dogma
S0261	er er yeah okay erm i mean he he put the stuff out er on podcast as well so he do his video interview it go up on his website
S0262	what software do he use for the podcast
S0261	erm i i think it's probably itunes so erm
S0262	that mean you have to have apple
S0261	well we've get apple
S0262	no but do students have apple
S0261	no but it get distribute through rss and stuff so i've get it on my phone through beyond be beyondpod yeah
S0262	okay
S0261	right so the i look at erm the blog that get send out from you've get all the stats on who collect what where and how many people open it and all that kind of stuff and what devices they use right so of the hundred odd it be about a hundred people go to seventy one percent open open it and read it yeah of that seventy one percent something like ninety percent be use apple apple systems yeah so that's in new zealand but predominantly that's what you'd expect to see in western countries and asian countries you'd probably see er the stuff yeah so it's america versus north korea china er south korea china or whatever yeah but you try and get it out on all platforms that's what it's about
S0262	okay
S0261	so everybody get to see it
S0262	so then the thing
S0261	however they see it
S0262	that's gonna take a lot of time i think be actually me come up with a dogma and a sort of format and you just format these interview yeah it's it there be a little bite of er kind of waver a bite around with creativity
S0261	but you want systems that be straightforward
S0262	yeah
S0261	bam bam bam bam bam
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	that's it you don't wanna be fuck around with oh i want it to look good i wanna change it
S0262	yeah
S0261	the reality be be that it's only the graphic designers that really want to try and put that kind of shit together
S0262	so yeah so we need something that will appeal to the young audience
S0261	yes exactly
S0262	okay and i'm define for you who the primary audience be
S0261	yes
S0262	erm so they be erm eighteen to twenty six
S0261	okay now i wanna go back you mention about avatars and er whatever yeah one of the guy who the one of the australian guy he use cartoon and avatars as part of
S0262	no
S0261	his thing
S0262	not have that no
S0261	that's fine
S0262	don't want it it's look babyish and it give the wrong signal i'm not interest in second life fuck you know war of war of world of no it's not about that it's about the fact that they've get me and i'm i'm enough yeah i'm already put my face out there on all frigging internet that be it
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah and i'm probably gonna get some shit for it from from troll and stuff yeah okay but there's no need for another face to be attach to this
S0261	no that's fine absolutely that's that's that absolutely right yeah
S0262	so it's just the play on word of stig sage
S0261	mm
S0262	everyone's fuck see erm what's it call
S0261	top gear
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm
S0262	and if it's not it'll be somebody else it have to be that way it have to work that way
