S0037	what's it like then that beer
S0115	um well yeah it's like a sort of a strongish lager five point five
S0037	it's pretty cheap though
S0115	percent and it's quite a strong taste quite rich uh quite quite malty i suppose
S0037	malty
S0115	bite malty yeah
S0037	ah
S0115	get that sort of richness
S0037	hey what's that badge
S0115	sorry be that good or bad
S0037	oh russia it's a russian one no i say what's that badge
S0115	yeah it's it's write in russian script isn't it if you look there you've get the russian b
S0037	so what's that what's that letter there
S0115	that's l
S0037	that j be it attach to there
S0115	it yeah the it look like j i but it's actually l like a lambda
S0037	oh right
S0115	look a bite like a lambda
S0037	and then that h be an i
S0115	yeah that's right yeah that's a capital e sound yeah yeah so e
S0037	that's really confuse like
S0115	k a the same b uh
S0037	that look like a b
S0115	it's confuse because there's another b in russian
S0037	be there
S0115	yeah which be which look the same as our b but it's pronounce v
S0037	like a capital b
S0115	yeah it's pronounce v
S0037	oh right
S0115	um t's the same obviously but some of the small letter be confuse as well
S0037	i know there's the like some backwards don't they like the backwards n
S0115	yeah like
S0037	be it n it's n
S0115	yeah like like a t be t be like a m when it's small i think
S0037	mm
S0115	the their their small t isn't like our small t
S0037	oh so you mean the oh right
S0115	lower case yeah yeah the yeah one that look like a upside down m or w or something be be like sh
S0037	yeah
S0115	which look like a w
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then there's um shch which have a sort of um
S0037	it look good i think i like sort of my favourite one be like um thai be it thai with all the circle
S0115	oh um
S0037	be it thai or be it
S0115	thai have uh circle and they look sort of like they're attach to they look like little tadpoles i suppose like sort of get string attach to them
S0037	little what right
S0115	so it look somehow similar to tadpoles uh not exactly
S0037	oh tadpoles i think you say something i think you say something else
S0115	ah no um what you think i say um
S0037	yeah anyway so
S0115	yeah no no no no no um uh there be there's a lot of interest uh if you're a graphophile or whatever and you like letter then there's a lot of systems out there like uh
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	thai's quite hard i think because it have letter that that don't have a sound like
S0037	and arabic as well like i think you know from that book that i buy you it's really hard like when like a tiny little a tiny little mark change the whole thing
S0115	ah yeah well the the main problem with uh arabic be that
S0037	dunno how you could get use to that
S0115	one of the main problems with arabic be that a lot of the vowels aren't write down
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh and sometimes the vowels be symbolize with a tiny little uh underscore like
S0037	yeah that's what i mean like a diacritic thing
S0115	superscript and subscript
S0037	yeah
S0115	um and also arabic have some confusion because the the start of the word and the end of the word and the middle of the word
S0037	yeah
S0115	and a separate on its own
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	all have different form of the letter
S0037	oh right right i see sign
S0115	a letter have a letter at the start of a word have a different shape from when it's at the end of a word
S0037	i think it look really nice i like the look of it
S0115	um and that also happen a bite in hebrew as well which be
S0037	i do like the look of it but i dunno if i would ever be able to like understand it or anything
S0115	arabic no i don't think it's that it's not that bad it's not as hard as like um
S0037	no i have a friend who go to uni
S0115	uh it's not as hard as thai i would've think
S0037	i have a friend who go to uni who'd do like um french french a level and that be all and she go to uni to do arabic
S0115	yeah to become she end up become work in the in diplomacy or something
S0037	like she's from she work in the she work in she's do a phd but i think she's work in congress and she's work at the un
S0115	what american congress
S0037	yeah she do an internship thing
S0115	that's really that's quite good isn't it actually liz have get a friend who uh be uh work in diplomacy international relations doesn't she
S0037	she's a bite of a high flyer oh have she
S0115	um so
S0037	and also um you know her um friend she go travel with work for the foreign office in can't remember where she be now but she be in kazakhstan
S0115	oh excellent um they get their script over there
S0037	oh the russian
S0115	cyrillic script
S0037	so what do
S0115	but they don't speak a language relate to russian they speak their own kazakh
S0037	ah
S0115	the uh the drink man's leave
S0037	what be them old fellas do
S0115	ay
S0037	what be you
S0115	well no i i just assume he be drink cos he's normally drink when i see him he might actually not be drink he may just a disease which cause the person to behave as if they're drink
S0037	oh that guy yeah and that that would be so bad like if you have that
S0115	um cos like there be a few of them sort of diseases uh like that affect the nervous system aren't there so
S0037	well i know that like when me me granda have a stroke and he sound piss all the time obviously he wasn't and i'm sure he much would have much rather have be but he be like really slur and sort of
S0115	yeah well no it's it's horrible to it's horrible to have your nervous system go isn't it it's the
S0037	i think it be because i think it wasn't like
S0037	he didn't think any different he say like obviously once he be better he be say like he still felt the same but he be it couldn't come out of his mouth like
S0115	yeah it's horrible to feel like you're sort of trap like that like um
S0037	yeah must be really scary
S0115	you can't uh
S0037	like our neighbour me dad's next door neighbour knock on the door and me dad answer and she be like slur and like just act weird and like me dad think at first that she be drink but it turn out that she'd have a stroke
S0115	be that in the
S0037	it's in yeah yeah
S0115	yeah
S0037	yeah
S0115	ah
S0037	must be really scary
S0115	actually yeah cos i sometimes see them through the see them through the kitchen window sometimes
S0037	oh yeah what's his what's he call the guy next door and he's like well i've get a million pound all the time
S0115	be he come across as a bite sort of like
S0037	oh he's quite annoy
S0115	boastful
S0037	he really do like a burst sausage face
S0115	uh oh no boastful and the face of a sausage oh dear
S0037	sausage face yeah
S0115	that's not a good combo combination uh yeah and some of them diseases be pretty bad but no i think that guy be actually drink and that's why he's he's always in the pub um
S0037	be he the one who like paint his nail
S0115	no that's a different one actually he's leave his coat so i think he's come back
S0037	oh right
S0115	coat but uh
S0037	maybe we come here too often if we're like that guy
S0115	he oh well i know i know a few of the i mean i don't really i don't don't i don't speak to the people apart from sometimes the bar staff
S0037	no yeah
S0115	uh but uh yeah i do there be a few regulars that i know that come here obviously
S0037	well you just see people don't you like it's the same anywhere you live you sort of get to see people
S0115	yeah i mean uh
S0037	there be a few people i recognize in the shop this morning
S0115	yeah from round the area i mean this sort of community be like it's a funny community cos you get the students don't you
S0037	it's a really weird mix though like so when i be i be in the shop this morning like buy some bread to have with me boil egg and then like so in there at the same time there be like people buy croissants and like the guardian and stuff and fresh orange juice
S0115	yeah
S0037	and like people buy can of like special brew it's like such a weird mix
S0115	yeah um
S0037	like tramp it's cos of that tramp shelter thing
S0115	there's a there's a couple of uh them sort of halfway house or whatever local shelter
S0037	must be really weird like
S0115	uh
S0037	i just don't know how you could i mean i like beer and everything but i don't know how you could face like a a special brew at like what time be in there like ten be or something
S0115	well it's the sort of need for it isn't it the the uh dependency
S0037	but i be read somewhere that like that cheap
S0115	dependence on it
S0037	i i don't mean like cheap booze like a in like you know deal on drink or whatever i mean like serious like cheap really hard like that hard cider and like frosty joe's or whatever it's call and
S0115	jack jack frost uh
S0037	d'you know what i mean white lighten lighten and that
S0115	uh frosty jack um
S0037	frosty jack
S0115	white lighten and then obviously the like tenant's uh super step past a can of that uh
S0037	and the special brew and the super all the super ones yeah that's true outside
S0115	so so i mean it's it's what be it like a pound a can or it's like nine percent or so
S0037	but i watch a it's awful like i watch a programme say that like that's the biggest threat it's not like cos obviously if you're a tramp you're not gonna be like
S0115	it's a terrible strain on the nhs isn't it
S0037	it well it be but i mean you're not if you're a tramp you're not gonna be like oh please can i have
S0037	what they do
S0115	i'd like a campari and soda
S0037	exactly you're not gonna be like a bottle of bottle of your finest wine it's like what've you get like that tudor rise that's really strong it's like port like horrible
S0115	um
S0037	but i watch a programme where they be like it be like a wet hostel so they be allow to drink but they be basically these old fellas all basically die
S0037	like with alcohol poison and um just sit there like just drink and shake and just so
S0115	yes cos they're lock in a cycle aren't they because they're
S0037	it's like worse
S0115	if you if you're dependent on it and you've get you've get um the shake then
S0037	people be say it's it's worse than
S0115	uh you would need some alcohol but you obviously have to step don't you you have to um you have to have some alcohol and gradually reduce it and you come off it like that
S0037	well the same well it's the same with come off anything i suppose like
S0115	it's it's difficult because then they would have the decision of whether to be teetotal or not
S0037	but they that's the thing they can't some of them like
S0115	if they go back on it then
S0037	it it knacks them like
S0115	yeah it can be a bite dangerous can't it yeah like yeah
S0037	if you've drink if you've drink that much for that long
S0115	yeah if you've um be dependent on it like you would probably have to have some alcohol sometimes which run the risk of you get back addict to it
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	uh part of it be you've get to
S0037	i think if you're that bad
S0115	you've get to sort of be able to sober up for a bite
S0037	i think if you're that bad you've you've gotta be like manage off it like you can't just stop
S0115	yeah i mean it's just that discipline isn't it and it's to do with self control isn't it
S0037	cos be that not what happen to amy winehouse like she stop and then when she go back on it her body be just like and that's that like
S0115	i'm not exactly sure what happen with her but uh i think she be just a very big drinker and then
S0037	it's such a shame though
S0115	she probably get that die of alcohol poison but she she have come off it hadn't she
S0037	well but but what i be say about
S0115	you can die of you can die of be off it as well cos the body the body uh be use to it and um
S0037	the shock what's it call again thingybob tremens
S0115	so it get all and delirium tremens be the be the shake
S0037	that's right yeah
S0115	but but you get um
S0037	but i be read
S0115	but because alcohol go in go into i think every cell in the body
S0037	yeah
S0115	it go it enter every single cell so every single cell all type of cells and obviously the nervous system the muscle
S0037	damage
S0115	all the cells be gonna be slightly alter in their uh behaviour by have alcohol in them so
S0037	yeah but i be read a thing about the thing that i be um say the it be an article i think i can't remember what paper it be in but it be like say that it's it's worse because it's more socially acceptable like if you saw like somebody on the street just like buy crack or what some drug you would be like oh like that's really that's illegal isn't it
S0115	you would go like oh wouldn't you you'd be like oh dear i saw a man take crack today it be very disappoint
S0037	well no but no but you know what i mean you you would like would feel like you have to do something about it like you would tell the police or i dunno what you would do but d'you know what i mean but obviously if you saw someone just buy like can of special brew or something then you would think like aw poor him sort of thing but you wouldn't it hasn't get the same stigma have it that like take drug have
S0115	no it's funny well it be a drug isn't it it's a hard it's a hard drug it's it's a psychoactive drug isn't it so uh
S0037	i think they should put the price up of those like of well all in fact all beer really as much as i like it
S0115	yeah well i mean there's there's a lot of difficult ethical political issue aren't there because there's a rather large number of people in britain who be addict to alcohol or other drug perhaps
S0037	yeah
S0115	and these people be in some sense be keep alive by by the state um and yeah
S0037	yeah i don't they should i don't think it should be cheap i don't think it should be cheap and freely available like i don't think you should be able to buy those horrible bottle of like the really strong alcohol with like pennies i think that's wrong
S0115	well i think it's the there's also a problem in term of the economy be actually there's a lot of money go back into the economy from um sales of this stuff if you raise tax i mean yeah
S0037	no i know that but that's that's part of like a tension isn't it like if they put up the price of beer then
S0115	well some of the other would've actually say that a better policy might be to legalize certain drug because um it bring them in it bring them in to you can get tax revenue so it shrink your black market and it possibly shrink gang activity as well
S0037	no but do do it not like just move those people like who be vulnerable onto something else like
S0115	i don't know if you change i they would change it because of that i mean well the the obviously marijuana if you if you legalize that in some in some ways marijuana's softer than alcohol isn't it so
S0037	well i i mean
S0115	i think if they legalize it more people would take it but that would mean that less people would take alcohol which would take alcohol money away from the uh
S0037	yeah exactly less pubs and club
S0115	take alcohol money but you'd have to look at place where this have be implement like
S0037	yeah
S0115	holland and uh and i think they've they've do it in uh they've do stuff in portugal
S0037	i know but it's be but it's be like that in for a long time in holland like there hasn't be like a change have there
S0115	no i think it be technically illegal but they just tolerate it
S0037	well actually when we be there be be they not change it i know they be change it like i remember see sign in the shop say that you couldn't buy magic mushroom there but you previously could have or something in holland
S0115	uh yeah i mean i don't really see why you would wanna ban magic mushroom um
S0037	well
S0115	personally but that's they're kind of natural so it's it's not illegal to grow them cos they grow naturally um um yeah
S0037	yeah but marijuana grow naturally and it's so they could grow that
S0115	not in not in england it doesn't
S0037	oh right yeah
S0115	it require uh like
S0037	yeah cultivation
S0115	you know they have to
S0037	get them uv lamps
S0115	you see the program don't you you see them with the whole house with like uh full plant a cannabis plant and like uh
S0037	that's crazy isn't it when they strip the everything out of the house
S0115	they've gotta the the radiators then
S0037	yeah yeah the uv light
S0115	uv light and well also well infrared you know heat
S0037	yeah heat lamps yeah yeah
S0115	energy be need um and you need to buy the compost
S0037	yeah
S0115	get to uh water them so i mean and they put like proper farmers you know proper like sprinklers and that
S0037	the irrigation systems yeah yeah
S0115	it's all very well very well do you see
S0037	i know i've see them on those like police police things
S0115	legalization would bring a lot of it would shrink the black market for that cos there's a lot of money in uh cannabis as you know there's uh often often smell whiff of it as i walk down round here in this uh student area like
S0037	it's quite studenty
S0115	um well i think it's uh i think it's it's not really dangerous but like there be a problem if you smoke it obviously the like the health risk of smoke it
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but eat it i don't uh i don't personally see that's that dangerous
S0037	well i don't know i don't know if i've make me mind up about it
S0115	well compare to for example alcohol which be just notoriously uh dangerous and
S0037	yeah
S0115	cause numerous accidents and massive strain on the nhs
S0037	it's funny isn't it how like i suppose it's just evolve over time that one thing's acceptable and another isn't
S0115	well it's funny i think think we've be drink we've be drink alcohol in this country i would imagine you know like from you know like since like stonehenge
S0037	cos people always drink beer haven't they from the word go
S0115	from the year dot uh i imagine that the the ancient stone age people would probably
S0037	yeah small beer what be it call
S0115	well the part of it be what we be say before about about mushroom be that they're that it's natural like uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	alcohol like rotten fruit naturally ferment cos the because the yeast yeasts live in the yeasts live in the air don't they naturally
S0037	but all those other ones all those chemical ones though like mdma and all them they be like they're manufacture aren't they
S0115	mdma what be that uh
S0037	and like acid and e
S0115	methamphetamine like ecstasy and stuff
S0037	no mdm mdma be be that not ecstasy
S0115	yeah something uh something uh methyl amphetamine isn't it or methamphetamine which be a that's that's a similar one isn't it um crystal meth
S0037	yeah crystal meth saw a horrible programme about that
S0115	um load of addict and that round american aren't there
S0037	yeah
S0115	i don't know about ecstasy i mean there be that thing wasn't there when there be uh a guy call mr nutt
S0037	mr what
S0115	mr nutt i think he be a doctor actually so dr nutt
S0037	right
S0115	and he uh and he say that ecstasy be less dangerous than horse rid
S0037	oh
S0115	and and um there be a massive there be a massive media storm about that and uh
S0037	i know who that be he be on the he be on like the the the uh government panel for drug drug
S0115	government government and he get he get reprimand for say and uh but he's raise an uh interest if that be true the fact that he you know the statement he make have raise more interest ethical question hasn't it
S0037	i know but it doesn't do any good say things like that do it like
S0115	i don't know if it's more dangerous to ride a horse than take ecstasy then i'd think well what's the sort of
S0037	but that not just mean that more people have die rid a horse than have do that doesn't mean it's necessarily more dangerous
S0115	i think it i think it do like
S0037	cos you can't equate the number of people with can you
S0115	uh
S0037	the amount of people that ride horse versus the amount of people who do drug or whatever
S0115	why not
S0037	i mean do he do that
S0115	it's like it's more dangerous to go like on a parachute it's more dangerous to go like um formula 1 race than it be for example to play uh to play chess
S0037	i know i get his point he be say oh i'd love to go on one of them rally things
S0115	i think more people have die formula one race get injure formula one race than than uh than play chess
S0037	well that's probably
S0115	so therefore formula one racing's more dangerous than than chess
S0037	dunno you could have some wild chess game
S0115	although you could you could have some like
S0037	extreme chess have you see extreme iron
S0115	i've see i've see chess and box play together
S0037	oh yeah when what be that on
S0115	where which where you you use your brain and then you bash your brain
S0037	what be that on
S0115	it be in germany and i don't know what it be on but
S0037	i saw something
S0115	it be on it be on uh on the box and uh
S0037	i saw a similar thing actually yesterday i be watch a programme about the us coast guard in the caribbean and like they're do their train where they make them do all kinds of physical exertions and like fire these question at them while they're like in these stress position you know like hold things out like that or and like make them answer question
S0115	right
S0037	similar to like box chess
S0115	that's um just strange isn't it
S0037	just crazy
S0115	i watch a bite of box yesterday actually it be chris eubank's son um
S0037	he's get such a funny lisp
S0115	chris eubank junior uh who look quite similar to chris eubank and he narrowly defeat by like a fifty six fifty two something very close no fifty eight fifty six i think
S0037	yeah
S0115	there be like two point in it narrowly defeat chris eubank
S0037	chris eubank's funny isn't he do you see all that stuff on the news do you see it there it be just on the tv
S0115	he's a strange he's a strange guy
S0037	about what happen after that the other fight that be on the that russian fella
S0115	oh yeah that be in the news wasn't it today um russian the the sort of you say like the english ones be be really behave really in an uncivilized way and then like the russian one have behave much better and then the english one have then like the english one have you know get all get all boastful and then he'd get beat by the russian one
S0037	i think i i sort of know he be gonna get beat
S0115	but then the use to be the two english ones actually start scrap afterwards or something
S0037	david yeah so david haye who's like he be the the one who um so he be the these two russian fellas uh i can't remember what their name be they begin with a k they're brothers they're massive like absolutely men mountains you know what i mean like six foot five type you know total
S0115	be it super heavyweight or
S0037	uh well just really big guy heavyweight i think and these two um and he one of one of them ones vladimir well he be fight david haye and he be on um i saw him on the telly the russian guy and he be just so nice like he be like well you know it'll be a good fight and i'm look forward to it and
S0115	it's funny isn't it mind you you can be you can be polite but evil can't you
S0037	well i think he be i mean he's obviously like a fighter so he's obviously use to like git punch people in the face and that but um
S0115	cold cold blood person
S0037	but but then the other guy david haye be like i'm gonna take him down i'm gonna beat the crap out of him i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that and like
S0115	well it remind me of uh
S0037	and he just get totally sit down like in the fight
S0115	remind me uh ricky hatton yeah
S0037	exactly the same it last like
S0115	although he be apparently fight above his weight when he be like
S0037	um but apparently it last like about one round and he'd just get totally like put on his arse by this
S0115	well i think that's just a cultural thing uh i think in britain and maybe america too they expect
S0037	but anyway
S0115	they expect the boxers to to have this kind of like bravado sort of thing
S0037	but anyway this other guy this other um
S0115	like wrestle i suppose isn't it where wrestlers sort of insult each other and it seem to be rather choreograph doesn't it
S0037	yeah but it's not like but it's really i think it's bad for the sport like people be try to just you know if you can call it a sport i mean it's debatable as to whether punch people in the face be truly something that we wanna be encourage but um i think it's bad like it's really you know it's like when you see in a football match there's people scrap in the tunnel and stuff like they shouldn't be do that you know
S0115	they shouldn't uh it it it's well it be it's make them like cos they say that box be suppose to provide discipline isn't it to to sort of people on the street uh who might otherwise be get drag down into crime and general general ridiculous behaviour

S0115	right
S0037	i mean people just aren't like they're not really tackle it so
S0115	yeah the i mean there be some the football's always be an area some of the unpleasant part of society sometimes uh you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	rear their head like in the the crowd obviously hooliganism and violence organize fight uh
S0037	just so stupid
S0115	obviously various uh extreme uh opinions such as dislike of gays or dislike of women or dislike of uh people with different skin colour and stuff like that in football
S0037	it's just stupid isn't it i can't understand it at all
S0115	but uh at least i think it's improve though but i think it's worse in other countries isn't it like uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	i think think we britain's better than i think perhaps some of the ones where i dunno if there's many players with darker skin
S0037	yeah
S0115	and therefore if they see someone with dark skin they would shout various abuse at that person like sort of happen in one of the game we watch last week actually in be it the spain one with porto
S0037	yeah
S0115	um they be shout abuse at like um the uh in uh players from uh who be it who play porto last week
S0037	i dunno i'm terrible
S0115	hold on be it man city do they beat them
S0037	oh yeah that's right
S0115	they beat them uh we watch obviously we watch arsenal and inter milan which be a c milan which be uh
S0037	that be a good match
S0115	which be a really great match uh milan be like the performance be really really good
S0037	i know sunderland would win you know i know they would
S0115	i mean um
S0037	i really think that they would win
S0115	but yeah that game be between sunderland and arsenal be a result but i mean but very bad if you're an arsenal because of the the sort of lacklustre that that arsenal do they often advance by pass backwards
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh which be like something that um
S0037	i i really think they would win
S0115	but often the pass you know right back to the defenders and the goalkeeper um
S0037	maybe they can win the whole cup that'd be good
S0115	uh yeah course they say there's a statistic wasn't there um might go to the
S0037	okay i'm alright i don't want one but shall we press pause
S0115	bar if you want one uh oh good idea
