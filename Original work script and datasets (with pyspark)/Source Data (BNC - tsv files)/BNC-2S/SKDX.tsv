S0262	oh right wow that's amaze
S0299	so it be really incredible
S0262	it be
S0299	i'm just look to see if the
S0262	but be that a well know college that's the reason why for education that you both go there or be it because there be more location in term of near to home or
S0299	i don't know why your mother go there but erm i go because i be very just er apply to all the welsh ones
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	you see so erm and
S0262	gosh so she must have be in some kind of the great all black which be actually so funny because you know the new zealand rugby team be call the all black
S0299	oh yes
S0262	i don't know what she be play there it's hard to say what she be play there i don't think it would've be hockey
S0299	yes
S0262	it might have be they would have have hockey stick
S0299	you would have think so erm
S0262	and this be it here this be the an old pupil of
S0299	yes
S0262	have successfully pass her finals at college
S0299	yes
S0262	take up her first teach appointment
S0299	oh right
S0262	at the queen's school for girls
S0299	yeah
S0262	which be funny because my first proper teach position i suppose erm be in
S0299	oh
S0262	not far really from at all
S0299	yes yes
S0262	and actually strangely the college in which be the the teach college well the teach college further education college sorry erm i call it a teach college because i do my my postgraduate erm diploma in education while i be there
S0299	yes i see yes
S0262	they make you do it
S0299	mmhmm yes
S0262	i mean it be a good thing to do but it be to get you on to the next ring of the salary
S0299	yes oh yes yes
S0262	that's the way they get you in
S0299	that's right yes
S0262	you know but i i work there for two years so i actually be live in erm just outside of ten minutes down the road from mum and dad and then i would commute each day up to and the college of also have a college in which be actually get bigger now erm
S0299	yes yes
S0262	so the whole connection though
S0299	it's amaze isn't it yeah
S0262	really it be you know in way i know be a sort of focal point for the family but erm just how she would have be there i don't know she would have be there from gosh i suppose
S0299	well i go sixty four to sixty seven and she leave in sixty she leave in sixty four
S0262	mm
S0299	so three years that would be sixty two sixty one
S0262	sixty four yeah yeah well i mean she have in seventy so she have me in seventy three so she would have be there maybe in for i don't think she do it for long i think she might have do it eighteen months or so
S0299	oh so your brother be bear seventy
S0262	yeah and so and she meet mum er dad in erm well they get marry in sixty sixty
S0299	oh sixty oh no
S0262	they must have get marry in sixty eight i think that would make sense
S0299	so be your brother bear abroad
S0262	mm mm he be bear in in
S0299	oh that's
S0262	they be post up there so
S0299	i see
S0262	so funny because really you know i be bear in england i be bear in dad be bear in but he's really an irish have an irish family
S0299	yes
S0262	erm and be bear in and mum obviously be bear in wales so really the four of us kind of have a quite a celtic you know
S0299	yes yes very much yes
S0262	represent represent you know the celtic so erm yeah it's interest how how that turn out to be the case but yeah live and work in london erm he have do for a number of years so
S0299	yes
S0262	and that's my my grandmother there yeah
S0299	yes
S0262	and that be her great friend
S0299	so your your mother look like her mother doesn't she
S0262	yeah yeah yes but i suppose there must be some resemblance to i would imagine
S0299	i can't see it
S0262	can't see it no
S0299	no
S0262	i you see i well i i think i meet him i wasn't entirely sure i might have meet him once erm granny take me down to erm when i be about nineteen and to see a friend of hers and it it might have be that we stop off to see
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	but that's a very hazy memory for me it's not something that i really recall very well so
S0299	yes yes yes yes
S0262	you know other than that i might have meet once as a little girl erm it's possible that i meet him but again i don't have a recollection of that
S0299	yes yes no yeah yeah so oh
S0262	you know so he really remain quite a
S0299	a mystery
S0262	he do really
S0299	yes well he be yeah i recognise this as
S0262	and he's much less of a mystery now that i know a bite more about mum i didn't quite realise you know the er the significance of all of this you know
S0299	well it be amaze cos i didn't know about er my mother call her erm until i go for my interview i go for an interview erm to
S0262	yeah
S0299	and this woman say to me be you expect any mail and i actually think she mean m a l e
S0299	i kind of look at her i say no and she say oh cos there's some register mail there's a notice on the noticeboard you know that they have for students say register mail for miss well obviously she didn't know that miss although it wasn't a big college and i tell my mother about this and she say oh that's your father's daughter
S0262	yeah no right okay yeah
S0299	and i didn't so i didn't know until i be eighteen that my father have a daughter and the fact that we go to the same college
S0262	right ok yeah
S0299	but she so she be there when i have my interview but she leave
S0262	right
S0299	and it be that man where she's get the group photograph there
S0262	yeah
S0299	a mr er er well he be the education lecturer
S0262	right
S0299	and i do erm so it be divide into the education be infants junior secondary so she and i both do
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	and he say oh you anything belong to so i say no because in those days if i if he might have say well how
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	and the fact that my mother wasn't marry be such a scandal so i just say oh no i think he say do you know her so i quite honestly could say no
S0262	yeah yeah yeah say no i don't know her yeah yeah
S0299	i don't but it be amaze that we should be in the same group
S0262	yeah
S0299	and i don't know perhaps she didn't do she's get re there oh she do geography
S0262	she do geography she do english and she do something else which be a bite erm sort of like home economics or
S0299	oh well you all have to do you have to do certain things be everybody have to do
S0262	right okay something like that yeah
S0299	yes but my main subject be re
S0262	okay
S0299	whereas hers might have be geography
S0262	yeah i think it be
S0299	yes yes
S0262	so how much younger be you then than my than my mum
S0299	right i don't really i can't remember i do know i be bear in nineteen forty five
S0262	yeah so she be bear in forty three
S0299	forty three yes it's just two two years
S0262	yeah that would explain why you be at college kind of at about the same time yeah
S0299	and your mother's that's right yes cos she she be bear in the january wasn't she
S0262	yeah
S0299	and i be bear in the october
S0262	that's no mum be bear in december
S0299	oh december oh december i see
S0262	december tenth yeah yeah so yes yes so you're your birthday be this month
S0299	yes yes so so it be really quite incredible and then oh it be some time later and then there be a chap call your dad might have tell you about
S0262	oh yes i've hear all about him
S0299	there's a cake and biscuits there
S0262	in fact i've the the latest oh thank you
S0299	oh you've have a letter from him recently
S0262	i have no well he keep actually write to my dad i do feel a bite sorry for both of them cos i think they're sort of lock into this thing
S0299	okay
S0262	where dad have agree to give erm you know the measurements to to
S0299	oh
S0262	but i think what start all of this from what i can recall erm before my mum die be i get a sense that after my gran die erm that have write or phone my mum and be probably ask her you know whether she she would allow for for us to be measure be the way he put it and i i don't think she be in to the idea at all
S0299	yeah yes no no
S0262	at all erm so i think that really that come to a bite of a kind of a a head
S0299	i see yeah
S0262	erm but i think i be aware of the fact that some well not fact but some kind of sense of somebody from her past with some connection to her past probably be try to come back into her present and i could sense that that wasn't make her happy at all
S0299	yes yes yes yes yes
S0262	erm but dad on the other hand have take a you know i think he's take more of a kind of a a objective approach which be you know this guy have be collect this information for years and though he's not entirely sure why erm it's so important for him to have dad's measurements i think more importantly be really after and myself you know in term of
S0299	you could yes
S0262	he's the link you know
S0299	yes
S0262	we'd have some sort of genes there you know to share
S0299	yes yes yes it be possibly the link although he do he's take all as well
S0262	oh have he
S0299	yes
S0262	well i suppose in term of the of the x and y and the
S0299	it's all the
S0262	you know the genes yeah
S0299	it's it's all an academic thing at the end of the day
S0262	mm mm mm
S0299	and he do have some paper publish but it's all in academia it doesn't sort of help you in any way
S0262	mm no
S0299	erm but that be
S0262	he seem like a nice old man i mean
S0299	he be he's an old man and he's in his eighties i expect and he's just continue on what he's do all his life really because he also erm so he do his family of 's as well
S0262	right
S0299	but then he do as they as they branch out he'll do you know the the branch of where if marry so and so he'll marry
S0262	oh right
S0299	he do all of those as well so he's he must i don't know what his house must be like because he doesn't use a computer
S0262	no he doesn't
S0299	it's all write down
S0262	yeah he's write a long list here of measurements you know by hand
S0299	yes oh and yeah and have you do the test and have you
S0262	well i haven't actually sign up for the test yet you know because my brother and i haven't really discuss it erm
S0299	and your birth weight
S0262	the thing about it be be that i think the first important thing be to try to ascertain whether that be what mum would've want or not want
S0299	i see yes
S0262	and i know that she's not here today to say you know one way or the other but i'm kind of in two mind about it erm i'm sure if this this old gentlemen be in the room i'd probably go yeah yeah you know take my waist measurement but all these other bits and bob and detail i'm not quite sure whether erm you know that that's actually the sort of information that
S0299	these be things
S0262	i can be bother to give him
S0299	oh droopy eye that be quite yeah i think from i he's get droopy eye and so i have i hate my eye
S0262	oh
S0299	it's that's its i haven't see this before he just have send things to us and we've do i mean we've get to do all these sort of test like i iq test in a way and
S0262	mm well i'm scar of do that i don't want to know my iq
S0299	oh and he well he's do all of ours and my grandson and er but the worst ones be the taste ones and say he could be give us any sort of drug and we'd probably put it on the end of our tongue and say be it bitter be it this be it that
S0262	yeah yeah you see you see if i agree i can see this be gonna be an ongoing thing you know and apparently his daughter be also somehow relate to the the project you know this project
S0299	of be she too sense that uhu
S0262	well she write another letter because i think write something a little i suppose the way it come across in the letter i suppose he's an old gentleman you know
S0299	yes he's blunt he do he
S0262	he's he's a bite blunt but he also insinuate insinuate something
S0299	oh i see
S0262	that could've be interpret in slightly negative fashion about my grandmother
S0299	oh i see yes
S0262	now that really would've get me go because i have a very strong relationship with my grandmother
S0299	yes yes
S0262	erm and i didn't really like that so i sort of think what if he really want something from us wouldn't you be think you'd go along with a nice be nice and nice and nice rather than try to put across something that almost be a little bite distasteful
S0299	yes yes yes yes
S0262	well in fact it be distasteful he he basically say something along the line of i can't remember the letter but you know be erm you know not a bright spark which i disagree with erm and you know her head would be turn i suppose by men in parenthesis and it could even have be possibly that 's father i've forget his name so my great grandfather
S0299	yeah
S0299	yeah
S0262	that might have be you know have her head turn by
S0299	oh i see yeah
S0262	and inside of all that be an insinuation be just unfathomable to think about you know what that all mean so
S0299	yeah
S0262	i could probably see why my mum wasn't a big fan of
S0299	yes yes
S0262	cos that's the sort of thing she would've take a real
S0299	well i i've never meet him i know he do lot of these things i'm i but we haven't give him all this information he just send us things from time to time and we haven't have anything for quite a while but we always know his handwrite be distinctive so say oh it's again
S0262	mm mm oh i know that's what i say when i see the letter drop through the letterbox i say oh god here you go dad and i thankfully he's not so into to write to me you know as address to me
S0299	yeah
S0262	but he be definitely still after us
S0299	well his yes and his wife have die now so he's obviously you know keep himself occupy
S0262	yeah but the daughter write and i think she try to make amend cos she may have erm read what he'd write or maybe he have have have second thoughts about what he'd write
S0299	yes
S0262	but he get i have the impression that he realise the error of his ways by write something like that
S0299	yes i see yeah
S0262	and that you know certainly i would not take kindly to that
S0299	yes yes
S0262	and i think dad be actually a little bite upset by it too
S0299	yes yes
S0262	erm on the other hand be you know water off a duck's back you know
S0299	yes
S0262	really couldn't be bother either way
S0299	he's not yes yes
S0262	not at all
S0299	yes
S0262	and erm but she write and say something along the line of no my father this be my father's life life's work you know he's very passionate about it he's almost obsessive about it
S0299	yes he be yes
S0262	but i i'm a something else a marine biologist or something but i help him from time to time with his research or his data collection i think she be try to say this and
S0299	oh i see yes yes cos if he be er we've be in touch with him for years but he's always be slightly eccentric
S0262	right so that must be it then
S0299	and and absolutely blunt
S0262	right crikey
S0299	and one might sort of say he's on an if he's do scale he's on an asperger's scale
S0262	yeah yeah okay
S0299	you know but but i've never meet him but through all his letter er he he's quite outspoken and that
S0262	but what be the connection of the family to the family
S0299	oh he'd i think he's a a third cousin to me i'll tell you now right
S0262	can i take that from you
S0299	yes and i'll i'll because i my i've not because i've get so much knowledge there i can't remember it
S0262	yes yes
S0299	and to say it easily right so our grandfather be call and his father be call
S0262	right
S0299	and marry i think this might not be absolutely correct now
S0262	oh no don't worry about it it's fact yeah
S0299	so his marry i think and then 's brother marry a marry 's sister so from that line
S0262	yeah okay
S0299	so he's a i think she be call he's a through that line and they come down into the so can can you picture it
S0262	right yeah yeah i see it it's interest
S0299	i if you go back like that
S0262	yeah
S0299	a brother a brother and sister marry a brother and sister we come from 's line he come from the sister's line
S0262	okay yeah yeah
S0299	so er so i think it make us like a third cousin or towards me anyway
S0262	right
S0299	erm but be a really good name to research although he be a and he isn't you know as i be a
S0262	right yeah
S0299	erm he do a lot so he will do it with the 's and then the 's also that they marry but the be a good good name he will contact anybody
S0262	mm mm okay
S0299	who's a good name he a a lot of he's give a lot of information
S0262	okay
S0299	and i think a lot be right but i'm not sure about everything that he's give not from my research
S0262	okay
S0299	because and he seem to be quite obsess with illegitimacy
S0262	yeah
S0299	er now the i don't know if you've ever hear of judge
S0262	doesn't ring a bell
S0299	oh well no it probably won't but he he sit on the trial for the great train robbery
S0262	oh right okay
S0299	well i and it it's just amaze because when i be in grammar school i think i be in first or second year er it be announce in assembly that one of the people from who'd go to our school have be make a judge and that be him
S0262	wow
S0299	and say that he's a you see well er in my research
S0262	wow yeah
S0299	erm he he his aunt be marry to a
S0262	okay
S0299	his aunt from his
S0262	right
S0299	mother's side
S0262	yeah
S0299	and she die and the two of them the two boys live with the 's
S0262	right
S0299	now that's my research say that and definitely his name be and i've get them live in that place
S0262	yeah
S0299	but say that he be the illegitimate son of them but i
S0262	oh yeah yes
S0299	so i i favour my research into 's assumption he be in the but he he wasn't but erm
S0262	yeah yeah yeah oh well i'm begin to get a bite of a picture now then about because there's you know these kind of ideas that he have you know about how people be bear and you know get well you know how they come about and and everything you know in term of of who do what with who you know
S0299	yes yes yes that's right yes
S0262	erm i just i find yeah i mean he's he be quite an intrigue individual
S0299	yes
S0262	but erm but i'm still not sure whether it's not long really since my mother die
S0299	no no
S0262	and come back and i you know i be in when my dad tell me that mum be die
S0299	oh you be away yes
S0262	erm and so that be in two may two thousand and twelve and she die june seventeenth two thousand and twelve i be due to come back anyway on a on a holiday with my husband
S0299	yes yes
S0262	actually that weekend we fly on the sixteenth of june you know you leave sort of two pm and you you get to at about six in the morning the follow day and then we take a coach as we always do to get up from to to erm and you know my mum die about two hours after that so she be definitely hold on to see me and to see erm
S0299	yes yes mm
S0262	so i didn't really erm you know i didn't really have much time to spend with her when she be die so
S0299	no no
S0262	but it be so quick you know it be so it be just one of those aggressive cancers and
S0299	mm it be cancer of the pancreas
S0262	it be and then it spread into the liver and i think that maybe the lung and you know it it be just
S0299	yes how long do she have from the time she know
S0262	well actually i you know i'm i wasn't there so should probably not say much but you know i know be mean to be a very good hospital but i guess each cancer patient be different erm but what i didn't like about it be that i keep phone up to say to dad any news any news about the test
S0299	yes
S0262	you know because we didn't quite know at that stage how far the cancer have spread and he be like well she's on the list for the mri she's on the list she's on the list she's on the list
S0299	yes
S0262	she keep get bump off the more and more and more important you know as in more urgent things
S0299	yes yeah yeah
S0262	so well how about my mum's lose the basically she couldn't walk
S0299	yes
S0262	you know from the time that i i think i skyped her early may and i think god she look very gaunt
S0299	yes yeah yeah
S0262	her face have actually go into that kind of look
S0299	yeah
S0262	where you think to yourself but i think she have be diagnose with diabetes too
S0299	yeah
S0262	and they tell her to change her diet radically i mean my mum love everything that be basically bad for her
S0299	yes yes
S0262	she love it
S0299	mm mm
S0262	so she really slimmed down pretty quickly on this new diet you know low salt low sugar and everything
S0299	mm mm yes yeah
S0262	and so i think well maybe it's a bite of that but then i think in the back of my mind no no no no there's something else there that'll explain this look
S0299	yes
S0262	and she actually phone me on friday i be yeah friday even and she say to me i think i've get cancer this be before she lose the really lose her that the use of her legs
S0299	yes
S0262	erm she say yeah i think i've get cancer or i've get what granny have now my my granny have a a sort of muscular dystrophy atrophy it be one of those it be one of those ones that you get when you're basically older
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	you know in your seventies which be when granny get it
S0299	yes yes
S0262	erm so i say oh crikey mum why do you think that she go oh i just have a feel that something's not quite right and i think okay
S0299	mm mm
S0262	i hadn't see her in about a year and a half so i wouldn't know so i ask dad and he say oh i don't know i don't know she's a bite you know confuse and say well you're not gonna be that confuse you know if you're not healthy you know
S0299	yes yes yes yes
S0262	so i say well let's see you know go to the doctor and it be to me the way it sound just sound horrific because she basically use to love a lovely chair like this and she use to sit in her chair
S0299	yeah
S0262	and she'd watch the television down in the sit room and she go probably to get up and she realise
S0299	yes so she couldn't walk
S0262	that there wasn't anything leave you know that these my muscle have just start to well just go i guess so she say to i can't really walk and he say what do you mean you can't really walk you know you walk a couple of days ago okay you be a little bite kind of you know but i but anyway apparently it take the whole weekend for a or three or four days for a gp to even come and see her
S0299	gosh yes
S0262	which time she hadn't be able to i mean they didn't have a way at that time to get her to the bathroom
S0299	yes yes mm
S0262	so it all sound quite from what i can say it sound like quite a long time have pass before my dad have really click that something quite serious be go on with my mum erm and then the gp take blood test and blood test and blood test
S0299	yes
S0262	but she still sit in the chair they didn't actually take her by ambulance to the hospital
S0299	yes right
S0262	so my poor father be try to take care of my mum
S0299	yes yes
S0262	you know with the basics
S0299	yes
S0262	which he wouldn't have know much about how to do
S0299	no
S0262	he really sort of doesn't have a bedside manner
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	he really doesn't have much of one
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	so it be all quite
S0299	yes i see
S0262	and i and then she get to hospital and she hat doctor and she hat hospitals
S0299	yes
S0262	even when i be in hospital she really didn't want to come and see me and er so i know this would be very this would've be the worst thing you know for her to happen but
S0299	yes yes
S0262	she be in there fourteen days erm until they realise that she be actually well they say to her look we can give you erm er you know we know it's we know it's spread we know it's aggressive erm we can tell you how much of it really there be in the liver by take a erm what do they do you know they go in and they take a kind of
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	but my mum say well listen you know you're tell me that i've you're tell that i'm die so you know erm why do you need to do that then and they say well only just because and she say well if it's just because no not really i prefer to go home to my dog and my cat and
S0299	so do she have she she didn't have chemotherapy
S0262	she choose not well she be too side yeah
S0299	yeah
S0262	they say they couldn't do anything for her
S0299	so it be quick
S0262	yeah it be so there be so much of it that it be just
S0299	yeah and how long do she live from the time she be diagnose
S0262	well she be diagnose on about er i suppose maybe may the fifteenth and yeah she actually die a month later
S0299	really
S0262	but the problem be be that the doctor you know what they're like you know some of them be i should say the consultants but some of the be very good cos i've i'm sure you know as well unfortunately you know people have pass away from cancer and you hear all the different ways that the doctor talk about how long people have to live you know and this one have say to my dad erm i would think in erm day no i would think in months i would think in weeks and months not years and or months and years okay i would think in weeks and months that's right now when i saw her when ifirst get off the plane and we walk straight into the live room and there she be in her hospital bed and i think well she's get a couple of days
S0299	yeah yeah
S0262	you know and i'm not a nurse or a doctor
S0299	no no
S0262	but i you can there's a smell as well you can sort of
S0299	really yes
S0262	it be that you know it's that smell as well and i just think to myself well she's get a couple of days erm i didn't know it be just a couple of hours so everything be kind of like that it be it be compact into a very short amount of time which some would say it's better to go that way
S0299	yes yes
S0262	than have this
S0299	drag out yes yes
S0262	protract you know and the palliative you know care be such that at least she get to die in her own home which be fantastic
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	you know cos granny die in in and i think granny's mum die there so that would be my grandmother i think even the great aunt die there too
S0299	oh really
S0262	so it's like four women in the family have actually fortuitously in a way

S0262	and in education you should be
S0299	yes
S0262	lead by example
S0299	yes there's an element yes
S0262	and i be work as a yeah i be work as a learn advisor at this university in call university it's just a few kilometres out of centre erm and i get a job there as a study skills person and then move into the faculty with the job and end up do you know erm teach new academics newly appoint academics who didn't know anything about teach
S0299	yes no yes
S0262	i mean they're wonderful researchers you know they're phds
S0299	mm yes yes
S0262	but they haven't get a clue about what to do with you know three hundred four hundred people on their course
S0299	that's right yes yes
S0262	so i be ask to come in and give some you know nice talk gentle coffees and
S0299	yes yes
S0262	sort of chocolates and see if i could win them over with this idea of that teach be actually quite an important thing to know how to do well
S0299	yes yes do yes absolutely
S0262	erm and er so then i get sort of you know take into different project and things so yeah it be a really great job because in a way i be i have the best of both worlds i have the the learners come to me and ask for advice about their how do you know reference something and how do you start your your essay how do you do critical think but then i be also work with their teach in a way to try to help them and i'd often say you lot need to talk
S0299	yes yes yes yes yes
S0262	you need to like understand each other's point of view and erm and often that would help you know that i could do little bite of both but i quite like that position because in a way i think though i do i do miss have my own students as in a class
S0299	mm yes yes
S0262	and see them
S0299	yes
S0262	you know every day or every week or something i miss that cos i work in regional college for two years
S0299	yes yes
S0262	so i do two years at which be the and then i because the commute be just too much
S0299	yes yes
S0262	and i it be too expensive as well to be honest with you so i get this permanent position at with the language school but they have a whole array of international students
S0299	mm mm yes
S0262	and i get pull into the different project and one of the project i like be be a form tutor and pastoral tutor for erm thirty five norwegian students
S0299	ah
S0262	who'd come over to go to the college to receive their er norwegian curriculum their their penultimate year so they'd have be about sixteen seventeen but all of their subject be in english the point be obviously to give them some experience in
S0299	yes
S0262	fight for themselves though they be stay with families in
S0299	yes yes
S0262	but they be independent and that they would you know have improve their english skills so i be their english teacher as well as their form tutor and their personal tutor
S0299	yes yes
S0262	but the erm that be lovely you know that be really great because they be at that age where you could see they're about to you know matriculate
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	from high school what they call high school and go off into to universities and do whatever they be start life so i do actually quite like that age i think that be nice
S0299	mm yes yes yes oh i can imagine yes
S0262	and i have them for a whole year you know so i miss that a bite
S0299	mm yes so where do you go to university
S0262	well i go er and do business erm what they call business and management now but at the time it be business study
S0299	ah yes
S0262	erm i go from ninety two to ninety six i do a work experience year which be part of the degree
S0299	yes
S0262	erm in and it's call the university of
S0299	oh yes
S0262	it's er not far from you know it's all around
S0299	yes oh yes i i mm mm
S0262	round that part you know the bottom of street street so it be it's you know it's right in the heart of it and what be good about it i suppose at the time be erm you know all of these business people erm come in and do these lecture you know the lecture and they do the the guest lecture and some of them be you know real high flyers you know we be like oh wow erm because they're alright in the city you know so they be that be great you know that be like a wonderful er exposure to business and then after that i go off to germany and i decide i want to do something different
S0299	yes yes oh yes
S0262	and i be an au pair as a way to get start in germany
S0299	oh yes yes yes mm
S0262	and i go to and i like it there for a while erm teach english there to erm business people erm and then yeah i then i decide oh you know i want a change of all the sort of different things that i'd be do and i take a sort of more creative process and path into write still like write erm but film script and then i go into the idea of film production
S0299	yes yes
S0262	so i go and do a master at erm in
S0299	oh yes yes
S0262	in film make and that that do me well for a little while and then i go off and do a french and german thing which be a quite an unusual it's sort of professional train but it be mean for european producers and distributors so i get onto that and that be the second year they run that course and it's still run but it's much bigger now but but that be nice because i be student at which be one of the big film school in france and then i be a student film school student at erm which be near and they pay for us to go all around europe and meet all these amaze people it be incredible for formation of the train it be a really well put together course but i find really even after that course even with the language skills cos you have to have french and german to do the course
S0299	oh yes fantastic yes yes yes mm mm yes
S0262	erm that i still really couldn't use the the the certificate well the qualification or the language skills to actually make a go of it i think it be the wrong time i'm not quite sure but anyway i be either a little bite ahead or a little bite behind i wasn't sure but it be time wasn't right
S0299	mm mm yes yes
S0262	so i decide to go out on my own and set up my own production company and i park up with a polish lady and we make documentaries together about polish stories
S0299	yeah
S0262	just because it be little bite different
S0299	that's right yes
S0262	and have more chance of get commission
S0299	yes yes
S0262	and so we do a few things together but we didn't have enough money to make a good go of it
S0299	oh i see yes yes
S0262	so i i think oh wow what be i gonna do and er and i think yeah that's when it i sort of realise that actually teach be more the thing that i want to do
S0299	mm mm yes yes
S0262	and i realise that filmmaking be nice but it's you have to be a certain person to keep on at it
S0299	yes yes that's right yes
S0262	and be really determine you know
S0299	yes yes
S0262	and i though well be i that determine no i'm not so what's the other thing i like to do and it be teach you know so
S0299	mm yes yes
S0262	yeah
S0299	oh that's great and what do your brother do he work in doesn't he
S0262	he do yeah he he start off more as a sales erm in publish sell advertise
S0299	oh publish oh i see yes
S0262	well he actually work at in erm er in for some time and then then he move all with the time with the social media and he you know he he's move as the technology you know advance erm
S0299	yes yes yes yes yes
S0262	he's now you know er work in advertise
S0299	mm mm
S0262	but he do sort of more the social media technologies communications more of that kind of creative you know
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	big campaign for lloyds bank and b and q and blah blah you know
S0299	oh i see yes yes
S0262	erm but he's try out for the job actually next week with the uae government for expo twenty twenty
S0299	yes
S0262	so it's a pretty big job er but anyway apparently erm you know he's in with a chance but he also have another job in the wing which be a job with etihad the airline company
S0299	oh yes yeah
S0262	which would mean he'd be in dubai anyway
S0299	mm yes yes
S0262	so it look like he's go to
S0299	i see so he's not marry
S0262	no he's not marry no and he hasn't be marry before no and he no he you know he doesn't have any kid so erm he's footle footloose and fancy free and you know
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	he's about to to go off and have a new new adventure you know in dubai and
S0299	yes yes quite something yes yes
S0262	yeah so that's lucky in a way because one's go but one's come back you know so it's
S0299	have come back that's right yes so that's so that's good for him
S0262	yeah yeah yes i think so
S0299	but it be amaze the sort of the connection with in a way because erm be my father's brother 's brother and he's get two daughters and
S0262	yeah
S0299	and 's son be in he might still be in
S0262	right
S0299	erm i don't keep in touch with her much but he be in at one time i don't know if he go to university but he's a he's a musician
S0262	oh right
S0299	so if you ever erm his surname be
S0262	right
S0299	i think it might be erm but he's into sort of erm i don't know play the guitar and sing
S0262	yeah okay well i'll have a look around yeah
S0299	yeah you might see him he he's the sort of the fringe things that they have around and then 's erm daughter be in at the moment
S0262	yeah yeah right
S0299	she's in her third year study medicine
S0262	okay wow
S0299	so it's and my grandson have just go to
S0262	have he
S0299	he's at
S0262	right
S0299	so it's really strange that i mean we're not far from er but they've come all the way from you know west wales
S0262	from yeah
S0299	up to it's interest
S0262	it be the connection be i mean really it's quite random well random in a way not random really but erm they could have go another way but you know but you know have have granny not get divorce
S0299	yes
S0262	you know i really i think you know i mean really what that be what propel her forward over to this part of the country i think because she have
S0299	yes so be her mother already here then or they come together
S0262	no no i think it be really granny's decision with a lot of advice and persuasion from her first cousin who marry into the family erm in so the 's be the people who own the book store
S0299	okay those yes yes
S0262	yeah so her first cousin have get marry and er and you know set up a life in and say you know this be as good a place as any you should come up here because you'll have fun up here and granny i think just take the first chance and say great you know i'm gonna go off and do that and so they buy the house the one that we live in now or dad live in
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	granny buy it and move everyone up
S0299	yes yes
S0262	so she move her mother
S0299	and yeah and her sister
S0262	and she move aunty er well aunty now yeah that would yeah you're right actually that would've be granny's aunt that's right yeah the great aunt aunty her sister
S0299	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	and the three well basically granny look after the two of them
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	and then she have get well of course granny you know say to mum what be you go to do with your teach qualification you have to do something
S0299	yes yes yeah
S0262	erm and i suppose the idea be that she come here to
S0299	so do your mother use to go down to when she be in college so do your granny live there at that time or do she live in earlier
S0262	i think she have almost two live gran you know she have a life down in
S0299	oh i see
S0262	where mum would be
S0299	yes yes
S0262	but quite a lot of the time she be in or she be here
S0299	oh i see
S0262	or as in
S0299	yes
S0262	so throughout mum's teenage years and perhaps even when she be quite you know even before a teenager i get the impression that you know granny have other things to do put it that way
S0299	yes i see yes
S0262	and i don't know how much mum really do actually get to see of her
S0299	ah ha i see yes
S0262	yeah because i get the impression that her grandmother bring her up quite a bite
S0299	ah ha i see cos i know she go back to because two of the girls who be in my the house that i live in erm that's what we call those nissen huts
S0262	yeah
S0299	erm they know they know your mother and one of them i can't remember where the other one come but one come from and she she say oh do you know she live or near where i live
S0262	yeah
S0299	so i i think that she so she be go there to her granny then not to her mother really
S0262	yeah i think so
S0299	yes that be her
S0262	think so maybe it be just the proximity as well be that you go for a weekend or
S0299	oh yes yes yes yes
S0262	or something i don't but
S0299	yes it would it be still a trek from north wales to west wales but
S0262	right that's yeah
S0299	not as far as go over to or wherever yes yes
S0262	or it could have be that granny have sort of forewarn my mum say look you know i'm pretty much think of go here
S0299	yes yes
S0262	can you see if you can get a teach position pretty quickly after you graduate
S0299	yes that's it
S0262	and see if you can get close to where i be
S0299	mm yes yes
S0262	close to me
S0299	yes
S0262	and i guess they be just lucky to have it all happen so quickly
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	i get the impression that that year erm must have be quite a lot of change
S0299	yes yes yes yes i see yeah
S0262	but yeah i you know and then granny really just establish herself in and pretty much you know the link with with wales become
S0299	yes really sever yes
S0262	well yeah quite sort of loose really
S0299	yes yes
S0262	and the only person i think that she really really miss a great deal be her great friend who live in and you know be her great great friend
S0299	yes yes
S0262	erm and we would have make trek down to to see and would trek all the way up to to see granny you know on a on a regular basis so so that be when you know that the the welsh connection be strong in that friendship but with pretty much everything else it just seem like
S0299	yes
S0262	you know it's it's a world apart
S0299	yes yeah but it's so interest because of the name erm my cousin or my cousins go to to live this be my mother's family
S0262	yeah
S0299	erm my mother's sister marry a
S0262	right
S0299	a very common name in wales and erm he have a car accident and couldn't continue the job that he be do he be a policeman and they just say he could work in the office but he didn't want to work in the office he want to do all the other business
S0262	yeah
S0299	er so they move to
S0262	right
S0299	but they move the other side they call it there's one side and the other side so they live side whereas your mum and my dad come from the no not side
S0262	yeah
S0299	erm but when my aunty die a few years ago and we be at the funeral and my cousin's mother in law be there and i don't know how it come up about you know my name but she get the bite and she say oh she say i use to be a teacher at

S0299	but it's such a small world
S0262	it's a small world
S0299	it's really incredible
S0262	it's that's funny isn't it
S0299	yes but there's one other thing i must tell you about erm the name of and one of the families that i cannot actually even get the i can't find them out to be welsh

S0262	yeah
S0299	but it's that they really i think ah how can't i get them back to wales
S0262	yeah well yeah why i wonder why not i really wonder why not
S0299	yes it be quite well it's partly be if if she have be a man it would've be easier to follow and he might have travel or whatever but but because she marry and have children
S0262	i'll have to take a photograph of be that okay
S0299	oh shall i photocopy it for you

S0299	okay then
S0262	they actually they do come out quite well
S0299	right cos otherwise i can go and
S0262	no that's okay that's fine honestly it's erm
S0299	oh yeah
S0262	just hold it steady and then i'll now if i just get the light right that should do it
S0299	there's little bite there what's on this other side oh that's just tell oh so i've get so that's the eighteen forty one census then that's i don't know where that's her there oh no see yes oh there she she's a cousin in eighteen sixty one
S0262	mm
S0299	so be that
S0262	's just next door to yeah
S0299	be it yeah
S0262	yeah
S0299	just like yeah so erm
S0262	amaze
S0299	it's absolutely
S0262	mm that be really quite a coincidence isn't it
S0299	isn't it yeah
S0262	or whatever it's call i'm not quite sure if the word's coincidence
S0299	yeah i mean it really be just
S0262	what's
S0299	so just because oh be i not write on this somewhere erm oh yes so all the 's from there you see all these bunch together they're all from so i think cannot find these in any of the families so there's very few
S0262	mm
S0299	and even those i have find now that they come from
S0262	mm
S0299	so it's not many that well they come from but there's not many that be not from what i call the area
S0262	yeah
S0299	really oh this be just of i think oh yeah it doesn't so oh there we be
S0262	mm
S0299	so this be so that's
S0262	that's
S0299	so it's not far at all and i think all these see and they're all farm that they
S0262	they be aren't they
S0299	everywhere that i've mark them but they're all farm we've be to all of them as i say 's car's get really dirty
S0262	wow so yeah so
S0299	oh yes see yes so 's you know where my dad live and so they weren't far at all
S0262	mm no they weren't be they gosh mm
S0299	and then the there erm the 's live up at and
S0262	so where be from here then
S0299	er well isn't
S0262	that's a bite further away be it
S0299	yes it's it's erm it's quite a way that they move
S0262	yeah
S0299	ah i didn't bring in another map
S0262	oh that's okay i can have a look on there
S0299	it's i mean it's it's not far
S0262	yeah
S0299	but erm in term of how they be all no no it doesn't i have i won't be a minute
S0262	so so of course so when you marry you become a
S0299	yes yes
S0262	so have you look into your husband's side then
S0299	ah yes
S0262	yeah
S0299	he's he's do quite a lot
S0262	yeah
S0299	and erm but it's it's very hard because it's really so common in wales
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	erm but
S0262	so you haven't be able to get quite as much like
S0299	and he hasn't present his like i present mine
S0262	right okay
S0299	he he's his be very academic it's all print out in order say last generation last generation whereas i have present them so that you've go back in each generation and i've take photograph of where they live at that time
S0262	yes that's it yeah
S0299	but his mother actually come from
S0262	okay
S0299	and the record in be really really excellent
S0262	okay
S0299	so he's get good he's go further back on his mother's side than his dad's side
S0262	right yeah
S0299	erm but his when you when you do it and you get the record you get a you get a feel of what the minister be like
S0262	right oh i see
S0299	and what and what society be like because when you go through the christen and it'll say things like oh erm erm daughter of er or and or something suppose allege daughter of
S0262	allege daughter yeah
S0299	and but then it'll say bastard
S0262	oh
S0299	yeah it will
S0262	that's a bite of a shock isn't it
S0299	well yeah so you see you get a real feel of what the minister be like at the time
S0262	yeah how liberal or or strict they be yeah
S0299	that's right yeah and that be really great but then the other thing that's very sad be because it be
S0262	yeah
S0299	erm or because it's near the coast be when you do the deaths
S0262	oh right
S0299	and they'll say er man find on the beach oh that do you know that make me cry it's like i think i don't know him but how sad somebody have lose him and nobody know where he be and nobody can kind of warn him and there's quite a lot of those that you see
S0262	yeah so people drown or something
S0299	yes yes someone could you know
S0262	go overboard
S0299	over a ship or anything
S0262	yeah
S0299	yes yeah but erm they have to go to church really in those days but somewhere amongst that stuff i get that stuff i get a great letter write by a
S0262	oh yeah
S0299	about the minister at the time erm oh write to the i don't know what they call him because i be a i'm a chapel person but erm what be they call erm you've get a vicar what's above the vicar the dean anyway write to the big man
S0262	yeah i i don't know to be honest
S0299	saint saint be a cathedral there and whoever be in charge of the cathedral complain about the vicar that er erm oh he's see him erm mow the lawn on a sunday and that he hardly ever go to take communion at different place
S0299	but but the other thing which i think be a real gem be that he only speak in the language of english and nobody can understand him
S0299	of course that be his they be at
S0262	mean to be go yeah
S0299	you know and i mean that be why there be a move away in a way because the the chapels the minister speak in welsh
S0262	ah
S0299	er and so they move away from the church of england because they be bring in the english speak you know people to
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	and er that's why i i love the social history
S0262	yeah it be great isn't it
S0299	and read all those sort of thing it's er
S0262	oh wow
S0299	it's quite
S0262	it's a gulf of knowledge that you have that's very impressive
S0299	and there's but there's one in one of them i've write it down and it's not to do with our family but it be somebody bury my i i write it down cos i think it be so awful erm may his soul rest he be oh and a baptist bury in the grave like a dog
S0262	ah
S0299	and that's what be write in the register
S0262	that's terrible
S0299	you know it be really
S0262	bury in the grave like a dog
S0299	yes yes yes and the way and a baptist you see because he wasn't church of england so so i i i
S0262	it's amaze
S0299	love all those things and some of it i just have to
S0262	they're amuse little stories as well in a way you know
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	it be a social comment of course yeah
S0299	oh yeah very much so yes
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	so erm
S0262	wow it's get it's get me think really about the other lot erm the lot that erm so from my mother's side
S0299	yeah your side yes yes hopefully
S0262	well i say my grandmother's side i should say
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	but they're the erm er gosh so this be this be what i've be learn more about erm right now i'm not go to be able to say that straight off erm well that's my gran and that's my mum there
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	so yeah well i this be me with my young handwrite so obviously i be get into it from an early age
S0299	early age yes yes
S0262	it's nothing like my handwrite be nothing like that now it's terrible now erm but so my great well yes my great great grandfather's wed erm so i've actually get quite interest in my great great no my great grandfather erm er and so he take the family out to
S0299	oh i see yes
S0262	and granny spend her formative years in in so i i some of these be miss i've actually take them
S0299	yes
S0262	but erm that would've be my that's my granny erm oh well and then we have mum as a young woman
S0299	actually i can see my father in your mother
S0262	yeah with the nose absolutely
S0299	yes but you look like your dad do you
S0262	well i have that's that's me
S0299	yes yes
S0262	that's actually me unfortunately i don't quite have the nice jaw line as my mum have i've get more of an soft more i call it jowly jaw line
S0299	yes oh no
S0262	unfortunately
S0299	yes
S0262	because she have a lovely jaw line she have a really nice jaw line but yeah from there really i have my granny's nose
S0299	i see yes
S0262	erm and i have my dad's eye
S0299	mm
S0262	and i have granny's forehead and we'll see a bite later on but yeah
S0299	oh so you've get that photograph
S0262	yeah
S0299	yes
S0262	yeah i have get that photograph and that must have be you know i suppose somewhere in
S0299	yes
S0262	or that might have be actually oh i don't know erm and so mum obviously take a like to like to the horse she love horse
S0299	oh yes yeah
S0262	erm that's a different exercise er somebody's wed and then i be try to find out if now that would have be you see i didn't meet any of them so i'm not entirely sure oh look so these be the form here
S0299	oh yes yes
S0262	yeah these be the that's right and that be erm so what i've be get more interest in
S0299	they're fantastic photos though aren't they
S0262	they be lovely
S0299	yes
S0262	they be sweet erm i wonder if there be any older ones in there no i don't think there be sorry but i have get quite interest in them so what i've be do start with the photos and just digitalise them all
S0299	yes yes yes yes
S0262	so you know that we don't lose them
S0299	that's right
S0262	but then the idea will be to try to you know start to branch out and do something maybe not quite as as intricate as what you've be able to do but you know
S0299	well you yes i mean i we've have such fun because we go up to london quite a lot to find out a lot of information
S0262	yeah
S0299	and we be mad
S0262	yeah
S0299	we actually go to
S0262	really
S0299	yes because the mormons they it's part of their religion that they have to find out so many generations so over the years they've keep different things and at the time
S0262	yeah
S0299	you you didn't get it on the internet so we go we go for two weeks and almost every day we go to this record office look through erm wind up reel
S0262	yeah
S0299	and that and and that's
S0262	wow
S0299	and i and they get book that you'd never see anywhere
S0262	right
S0299	so that be really fantastic
S0262	yeah
S0299	but now if there's two organisations there's find my past or ancestry dot com
S0262	which be the one that's own by the run by the mormons
S0299	neither of those i don't think
S0262	right cos somebody be tell me that erm not because i be say but they be say that erm they want to to get into look for their you know
S0299	oh yes family search i think that's place be call
S0262	right they be say well i don't know if i want to use that one and i be say why not you know but as you say the mormons that's part of their
S0299	yes
S0262	you know their religion isn't it to find
S0299	yes and we we actually they don't try to proselytise when you go there
S0262	no okay
S0299	and we we they be what i would think would be mormons when in the room and then you're their downstairs be like a big place that you can eat
S0262	ah okay
S0299	and we'd go down and we'd eat and we'd chat to the americans but they didn't try to sell their faith to you
S0262	okay
S0299	they be really just all about family history you know i find a one thing about the americans that they do like that their families they want them all to be royal come from royalty
S0262	of course of course yeah
S0299	you know they be royals but they be throw out so they
S0262	yeah
S0299	now that's a wild generalisation but they do like it oh my grandma she be you know
S0262	yeah
S0299	that kind of business
S0262	yeah
S0299	erm but family search 's use family search i quite prefer erm find my past
S0262	find my past yeah
S0299	really or ancestry dot com i mean you have to subscribe to it so you have to make a payment
S0262	yeah
S0299	but they've get so much erm information erm yeah they've really get
S0262	so they've really get it and be it expensive for the subscription
S0299	i don't think it's i can't remember now but it's not that much
S0262	yeah yeah and why do they want you to subscribe what do you think that's about
S0299	well because i suppose they've get they've probably get to pay to put it all in a format
S0262	right i suppose yeah
S0299	because it would all have come from the old the old record
S0262	record yeah yeah
S0299	so it would be put into a format
S0262	right okay
S0299	but they've get erm ship you know passenger list things from erm army record and newspapers things i've get on the 's be lovely i've get quite a few newspaper cuttings that i find online
S0262	wonderful
S0299	and they because they be all out congregation and church play the piano and sing
S0262	how nice
S0299	all of the sisters
S0262	a nice family idea isn't it
S0299	mm but but i i the one i've get the best be from my mother's family erm be my grandmother's grandmother and when i be find out her information i say to her i don't know i say i think she's a bigamist because she marry him but she marry him not long afterwards and erm it wouldn't have be long enough for a divorce in those days i think it take a long time
S0262	yeah
S0299	and i can't find him dead so anyway i've actually write it in
S0299	i think so i think this a bigamist marriage
S0262	oh god
S0299	so more recently when the newspapers have come out it's in the newspaper
S0262	it be you're right
S0299	and it's it's quite hilarious because it be a a bigamist marriage erm a bigamous marriage and if you read all the detail she be quite sharp she know what she be do
S0262	say
S0299	but she actually be find not guilty because he live he live about ten miles away from her and they'd live apart and she didn't know whether he be dead or alive
S0299	and i know that she know what she be do
S0262	ten miles and she didn't know whether
S0299	so but the really it's so hilarious though in she must have give
S0262	but she be find not guilty
S0299	yes say she must have give him the wink or something
S0262	ah i say
S0299	but i've only recently find out since they do newspaper things so
S0262	that's wonderful oh that's get me very excite
S0299	it's great we'd love a lot of people say to me oh do you find any erm any what be it they say closet no something in the closet
S0262	oh skeletons yeah
S0299	skeletons and i think well what do you find because that's life isn't really any different today
S0262	than it and yeah that's right
S0299	and i mean they mean illegitimacy er they don't know that i'm illegitimate
S0262	yeah yeah right yeah yah
S0299	that's what they mean on the
S0262	they're look for scandal
S0299	yeah and it's because it doesn't bother me when i read it
S0262	yeah
S0299	when you come across it the the one thing i have find be that generally the welsh people live have live straighter kind of live they've get marry and all the rest of it my english family be not quite as good
S0262	okay yeah
S0299	i've get to say you know they have erm but i think well that happen anyway doesn't it really
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	but some people be scandalise by it
S0262	oh yes the different culture i mean i've always felt that you know between erm mum and mum and gran be welsh and dad be you know basically irish
S0299	irish yes
S0262	you know erm though he doesn't sound at all irish and he be bear in england he be bear in
S0299	no no no mm
S0262	they all of his family in our background you know my ancestors would be irish on that side but erm yeah i've always felt that about the welsh that there's something there's another an an otherness in me which i feel like the more i go there and the more i learn about
S0299	yes
S0262	the welsh side of the family
S0299	yes
S0262	there be a part of me there and i'm not quite sure what it be yet but it's sort of maybe something more that you know to explore
S0299	yes yes
S0262	because when i grow up in england and we we didn't we didn't go every summer holiday to to though i think it would've be great but we didn't
S0299	mm no mm no
S0262	erm but yeah i think that there be a draw a feel there's something
S0299	you will yes yes
S0262	and now that mum's pass on and gran's pass on and really i've meet you which be really fortuitous
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	you know cos this be a link to the family
S0299	that's right i'm your aunty really
S0262	that's right you be you know and it's wonderful to have that it really be
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	and to actually have somebody who have really go to such an incredible you know obviously enjoy yourself do it but
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	you know it's an incredible legacy to leave behind
S0299	yes yes
S0262	for your children you know and
S0299	yes yes
S0262	kind of grandchildren so erm but also yeah it's for others too because it be erm it's an important document
S0299	yes yes
S0262	you know documentation
S0299	yes
S0262	i love it you know i really do
S0299	oh that's great yes
S0262	it do it put me more in touch with the welsh side because i know that there be something in me but
S0299	mm cos there be yeah
S0262	not sure what it be you know
S0299	yes yeah well i hope you know you must go with your husband to
S0262	yeah we should go
S0299	look around some of those place
S0262	yeah yes definitely
S0299	and feel that because there be i'm really proud to be welsh
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	wherever we go i mean
S0262	well good for you
S0299	we've live we've live here since we've live in since nineteen sixty seven which be longer than i live in wales
S0262	yes
S0299	but we do feel very much that we be welsh
S0262	very welsh
S0299	and we always say oh we're welsh
S0262	yes yes yeah
S0299	erm so it it be a heritage and it's it's lovely and we do come from a really i think they're a nice family the 's and the 's
S0262	yeah yeah yeah oh well i'm lucky in that respect then
S0299	erm my feel yes yes
S0262	because it's funny because all that i'd hear really from my mum's side granny very rarely talk about and if she do it be quite um distant
S0299	mm yes yes
S0262	but towards the end i ask her about you know her her well i suppose you know her her time with erm and and i say i suppose you know she be pretty much erm well she be actually er she be you know she have the disease and i think she sort of think oh well i may as well just sort of say it like it be and she say oh well you know i be young and i marry him for his horse you know
S0299	oh yes yes
S0262	which some would say you know somebody have a nice car in those days
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	you know she love the horse
S0299	well yes they do
S0262	and
S0299	be a breeder of horse so
S0262	yeah yeah she love these horse
S0299	they yes yes
S0262	she love them
S0299	yes yeah
S0262	erm and i don't think it be because she marry think that she'd marry into a wealthy family
S0299	no no
S0262	cos i think she actually come from quite a well to do family herself
S0299	yes yes yes yes yeah i wouldn't say they be wealthy but they be very very comfortable
S0262	yeah comfortable farmers
S0299	they be well off and especially as i say after the during the war i think it be even better but
S0262	yeah she these horse just sort of really capture her imagination but unfortunately though mum have of the farm days the early days her early childhood really terrible memories
S0299	yes yes
S0262	i mean these be just shock memories now how much over the years she i suppose maybe add to these this childhood memories
S0299	yes yes
S0262	but you know whatever her memories be it be unfortunate in a way because i think she carry rather than an anger and a and a hatred for i think she carry the fact that you know he never really love her
S0299	yes
S0262	and that's get to be one of the most hurtful things as a child
S0299	yes yes yes
S0262	she never felt he love her
S0299	yes
S0262	and even though she can sort of rectify the idea or remedy the idea that a man and a woman might fall out of love with each other or not be compatible
S0299	the man and the woman yes yes yes yes
S0262	she couldn't ever forgive him i think this be what eat her up for the fact that he he he from an early d he really wasn't that interest in her
S0299	yes
S0262	at all
S0299	yes
S0262	but later he sort of maybe grow into the idea of be a father and really want to have perhaps the proper kind of love with with her with his one of his you know his children you know
S0299	yes it it's strange really cos i would say i can talk dispassionately about my father
S0262	yeah
S0299	because really my mother's father my grandfather be my father that i the man that i really love
S0262	right yes yep
S0299	erm and felt that he be like a father erm so because i didn't really know my father didn't meet him many time really although well i do meet him at different time and he give me away when i be marry
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	erm he be a nice man i think he be i can quite dispassionately say like i could say about the man next door he be a nice man
S0262	mm mm
S0299	and he have lot of interest and i think he be very intelligent but i've get a feel he and never have any children
S0262	mm
S0299	and i don't think he they he he didn't want any other children so i think he be a man who would've be better if he'd be erm never have children at all
S0262	i see yeah right
S0299	or be a bachelor erm we be when we meet him my brother and i erm it would be we'd go to which be between and where we live and we would meet him for the day
S0262	right
S0299	and he could cope with see us for the day
S0262	right
S0299	and would pack a picnic
S0262	yeah
S0299	and we'd have a picnic erm it be and then as we be older erm he be more interest and he be more interest in me
S0262	yeah
S0299	than my brother because i have go on to college and we would talk in the way he like to talk he be see to be more interest in because always say that he say oh he's more he wasn't interest in me but i think because be a boy and he wasn't one who want to chat he'd rather go out and chat up the girls or be play whatever he like he like conversation so he would ring and ask to talk to
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0299	erm but then she would have be at university or older by then so i think and they you know he do think a lot of her but i think it be because she be a young woman by then
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	erm so i think probably he be a man better off with who and they never have any children and accord to my mother erm she say that he have tell he didn't want any children
S0262	mm
S0299	so whether or not so i don't think it be by accident that they didn't have them because she be young enough
S0262	mm oh twenty yeah
S0299	but she can't be many years older than me
S0262	well that's right
S0299	really
S0262	i mean she be twenty when she marry him so i think they
S0299	yes and he be thirty four fourteen years so
S0262	yeah
S0299	so i think erm if that help you in any way with regard to your mother
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	you can think of him as a nice man
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	but he wasn't paternal
S0262	no no
S0299	really when you be older and he could relate to you as somebody who be older that be a different thing
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	he'd probably love you
S0299	you know with all your and he like people who be clever and you know all of that sort of thing
S0262	yes yes it's funny how people mm connect on those point yeah
S0299	but yes yes so erm
S0262	right well that's good i think that's good it be good to know you know these just fill in some of the detail or the blank because you know for many years i just really get the impression that it be more about mum's feel toward him
S0299	mm
S0262	than myself or you know as as grandchildren you know
S0299	yes yes
S0262	erm but now yeah it's more of the point i guess be that you know it's more about the 's you know it's he's a i'm a you're a we all fit in together somehow
S0299	yes yes that's right yes
S0262	so it's more about that it's a bigger picture really than just one man
S0299	yes yes that's right yes
S0262	one man's decision what he do and what he didn't do
S0299	so you know i mean i don't really know much about anything because erm it my mother never speak my mother do love my father
S0262	yeah
S0299	all the time until she die even though he be marry to
S0262	yeah gosh that must have be heartbreaking for her
S0299	erm and she do er but she but she never ever say anything bad about him
S0262	no
S0299	erm but she never say anything about why he she begin to go out with him when he be marry i think that from what i can gather my mother be in the land army
S0262	mm
S0299	and she work on a farm and she live there and i always get the impression that he be live there at the time
S0262	mm mm
S0299	so i'm not sure if she know too much about your grandmother really so
S0262	mm probably not yeah two separate live that way
S0299	because you know they they yes and they be in different place and it would've be very just their life would've be there really at i suppose or and then she would come be come back
S0262	but there be one question i would've ask my grandmother but i think it be little disrespectful so i didn't ever ask erm that from my understand to get divorce in those days one would have have a pretty good need a pretty good reason to get divorce
S0299	oh yes yes
S0262	i don't think it's like how it be today just like oh well you know we just sort of don't want there would have to be quite a specific reason
S0299	yes yes
S0262	erm and you know most people would say one reason would be adultery that sort of thing
S0299	yes well it would be yes
S0262	and erm so but i never ask it because
S0299	yes well it must have be
S0262	basically you you can't ask that question
S0299	no really and i mean that's i i don't i don't know if
S0262	but you you never know anything about whether that it through all of this i don't suppose the divorce
S0299	i think you can i think
S0262	things have come though
S0299	ah you you can get record of of divorce but they only start at a certain time and i at the time i be do this in more detail it wouldn't because they don't release record too early they take you know they every
S0262	yeah they let
S0299	the census only come out every ten years
S0262	right yeah
S0299	and it's something like that so i couldn't find a copy of my father's divorce but i'm sure it must have be adultery because i'm not much younger than than your sister your mother
S0262	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0299	so my father be but i'm not sure my mother would have know that he have a child some or perhaps i'm make excuse for her
S0262	yeah
S0299	i don't know but it must have be that and it's awful to think that my mother would have be name as the co respondent
S0262	well this be it for her reputation
S0299	yes yes but erm well because it seem such a sort of harsh word somehow
S0262	it be really yeah
S0299	and it seem as though you've do something really deliberate i don't know but erm
S0262	no of course not i wouldn't have see it like that you know
S0299	no but she she she never she never speak about that sort of thing really
S0262	no no i don't i don't think you would yeah
S0299	erm so i don't know the detail of any of that then
S0262	no but the one last question then be be you in contact with your brother
S0299	oh my brother yes
S0262	yeah you be oh that's good yeah
S0299	yeah my brother be my brother be my mother's son
S0262	yeah yeah so that's fine then so you know in that respect you grow up together as sister brother mum
S0299	oh yes yes yes
S0262	three of you together
S0299	and we live with my grandparents
S0262	right
S0299	so erm yes yes
S0262	yeah yeah oh that's good
S0299	and and it's really it's so sad really because my mother be afraid she wouldn't say anything and i i have a i i kind of i cos i always love read and i i find a letter which say about change my name and i be ten i think and i always think that's funny that why you know i be always call but my i'm register as
S0262	okay interest
S0299	and erm because they weren't marry and
S0262	yeah
S0299	and my mother wouldn't have know any better
S0262	yeah
S0299	because now you can put the because my brother be on his birth certificate be be
S0262	a yeah yeah
S0299	and erm i think about it for a long time and then you know when you go through school when you get to the grammar school and that and they take call bastard be a new word that they all learn and they like i always say i think that's me
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	and i be sixteen when i ask my mother and she tell me so it be a you know you just didn't sort of say it and she be really really upset
S0262	mm
S0299	erm and and then i have my name change by deed poll
S0262	okay
S0299	erm to because my birth certificate have say i can't remember what i be go to say now but so you do oh that's right so i use to say to my mother then as i get older mum you must tell you must tell that you've never be marry to our father
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	and she and she you tell him i say it's not for me it's for you to tell him
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	anyway she never tell him and i think it be at oh it be at the funeral of an aunty i think and erm i be talk to my sister in law say something and i think she they don't my mother hasn't tell him so i tell my sister in law's call i say you know my mother be never marry to our father and she say oh she say no she say will be so please
S0262	oh really
S0299	because he always because he say i he know there be a secret
S0262	ah
S0299	and he always think
S0262	mm
S0299	that we didn't have the same father
S0262	mm
S0299	he think that that be my father but he be the illegitimate
S0262	right
S0299	well we both be but he he didn't know
S0262	he get pick up on some sense or something
S0299	you know and he he be in his forties and i think that be so awful that all the time he think there be a secret he know there be something but but that be it we just people weren't open about things in those days
S0262	no
S0299	they my my grandparents take my mother in
S0262	mm
S0299	erm and we and really have nothing but it be like you don't tell anybody sort of thing and i think everybody in the village where i live believe that my mother be separate and divorce they didn't know that she be never marry
S0262	yeah which i suppose even then separation and divorce would have be consider to be quite a thing to gossip about
S0299	oh would have yes a thing that's right yeah absolutely
S0262	you know so but then she would have have to have go quite through a lot of
S0299	yes yes so er
S0262	heartache
S0299	that's right
S0262	yeah
S0299	but i think i think tell my mother to go because when she
S0262	what to protect her
S0299	no to get out
S0262	oh really
S0299	i don't know my mother have dementia in her last years and we be visit her and she just use to talk about she talk a load of rubbish erm but she would say things and she oh god what have i do wrong now what i have do wrong now cos i think cos the way you bring there be religion be really quite it be very much about do wrong in those days
S0262	yeah yeah
S0299	and erm she think i be bear with spina bifida because of what she do
S0262	okay
S0299	because she'd have me without be marry
S0262	okay
S0299	and then so we be there one day and she say why do she send me away why do she send me away from the farm i didn't do anything wrong so from that i think that must have say you've get to go back home now that you're have a baby cos i be bear in a mother and baby home
S0262	okay yeah
S0299	initially and then my then my grandmother find out and say you've get to come home
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0299	you know erm so i i the things be much more open
S0262	gosh that's tough
S0299	myself i i'm not all that keen on this promiscuous society that there be
S0262	yeah yeah no
S0299	but i do think it's much better to be honest about things you know all these secrets and i can't help you with you know what happen with your mother and my father because i my mother never say you know like my daughter say i can't believe you you believe your mother that there wasn't room in the house
S0262	yeah that's it but you know but why not it's easier to believe that than to believe anything else
S0299	that's right yes yes yes
S0262	you know so
S0299	so erm but it be
S0262	and it really revolve around well i suppose you know cos my my grandmother
S0299	or your grandmother rather yes
S0262	never remarry again so we we never have so it sort of to me it sort of revolve a a lot around you know about this relationship with this man you know the the daughter father relationship and the as my mother keep put it fail marriage you know the way she'd phrase it
S0299	yes yes
S0262	fail marriage so erm so really see that all gun be point at you know erm
S0299	mm yes
S0262	and er and that's the way i've be bring up you know
S0299	mm yes
S0262	but as i say now really it's kind of like well that's one man in a in a in a you know in a tapestry of live
S0299	yes that's right yes yes
S0262	that be interweave together throughout the centuries
S0299	absolutely that's right yes yes yes so
S0262	yeah but some of the theme the thematics that come through i think be quite interest you know erm i've pick up on a few things today where i sort of i suppose people say oh i wonder why i'm like this or i wonder why i'm interest in that or
S0299	oh yes yes
S0262	you know i wonder where that come from and you know some people would say yes it can be something in the family that sort of you know encourage
S0299	well it be yes yes
S0262	more than something else you know
S0299	but no there be some things that be genetic really that have come through yes yes
S0262	mm
S0299	yes yes so
S0262	well it's be really wonderful
S0299	oh it's be lovely meet
