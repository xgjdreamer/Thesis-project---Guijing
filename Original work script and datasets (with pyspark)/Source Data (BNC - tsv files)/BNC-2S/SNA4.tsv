S0579	yeah
S0454	i suppose it's different when you've get a family if you've get to do it every day
S0579	well i think your dad do a bite of cook occasionally maybe
S0454	mm
S0579	if 's not available
S0454	he's not bad mm
S0579	well i think i think say he cook everything he like yeah yeah
S0454	mm yeah
S0454	now don't feel you have to eat it all cos i give you load of potatoes
S0579	they're very nice potatoes
S0454	be they good cos they're they're new ones
S0579	yeah they're very nice yeah
S0454	they're in season at the moment just come to the shop
S0579	oh do your dad grow potatoes
S0454	no
S0579	oh no
S0454	no it's a shame cos new potatoes be delicious the same with carrots
S0579	oh
S0454	new carrots be delicious
S0579	oh they're much better than
S0454	mm by the time you get them in the supermarkets they're enormous and old
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes i've put onions in and i've put potatoes in this year
S0579	have you
S0454	mm only half a dozen plant
S0579	yeah
S0454	but erm they say if you've get heavy clay potatoes be ideal for break it up
S0579	for break it up yeah
S0454	yeah and you don't have to dig it so that's what i've do
S0579	oh
S0454	and i've put jerusalem artichokes in have you have those before
S0579	what er artichokes no they didn't they didn't round here
S0454	they're they're like a tuber like a potato but much
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	erm thinner and you cook them much as you would a potato
S0579	oh
S0454	it's sort of a a posh potato i think you never see them in the shop they're never for sale
S0579	what do we use to have erm in south africa the sweet potatoes
S0454	oh i like those yeah do you like them
S0579	not particularly no
S0454	mm
S0579	i prefer the english ones
S0454	mm i like them
S0579	you really like them i
S0454	they use to be really expensive here but they're cheap at the moment
S0579	be they
S0454	i don't quite know
S0579	i know i mean when mum's in kenya that's when always have them over there
S0454	oh right oh yes oh she's never mention them
S0579	yes mm
S0454	i suppose she doesn't like them
S0579	they've never be back either to that part of the world
S0454	no i think she's in two mind cos she feel
S0579	oh really
S0454	if she go back it will have change and that might spoil her memories
S0579	well it be actually like that cos i where do i go
S0454	you've be to china a few time that must have change enormously
S0579	yeah the summer where i use to some air station
S0454	ah right
S0579	and when i go next time round they've get a family there and they're no more an airfield
S0454	yes that's right so you have to be careful go back
S0579	yeah that's right it's spoil it
S0454	it might be nice to leave it as it be yeah so i think that's why she's not go back perhaps they should go next door though to tanzania or something like that and have a holiday there cos it would remind her of it a lot but it's different
S0579	oh hasn't be to tanzania
S0454	well it's quite a safe option i think cos kenya's not actually that safe at the moment well it it's not be bad the last year but there have be a few shoot there of tourists
S0579	oh really yeah
S0454	it's not the best place to go
S0454	uganda's safer than kenya now which be a change
S0579	well it use to be awful in uganda
S0454	that's right yeah so that's the other way round now but tanzania's a good option you've get the safari option
S0579	yeah mm cos i do all my air train in south africa
S0454	ah right
S0579	and then and then when we go then go to the middle east
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah and where do we stay oh about twenty miles south of

S0579	yes but you you you're dad's a very quick eater
S0454	yeah i be and i need to slow down actually
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	it's not very good for you to eat quickly you should eat slower
S0579	i think i think they tell you to eat but erm
S0454	they tell you to eat slowly it's better for your digestion
S0579	yeah oh well your grandma well
S0454	she be very slow
S0579	yeah would take all day

S0579	so she grow up on vegetables cos her father use to grow most of them
S0454	ah right
S0579	yeah
S0454	ah maybe that's where i get it from
S0579	oh you get it from me
S0454	well you use to grow a lot of fruit didn't you

S0579	yes
S0454	good for privacy though
S0579	you your actually your grandma never really get over i don't the ones want to leave er
S0454	ah right
S0579	cos erm she know it she know everybody there in pretty well
S0454	yes

S0454	that's nice
S0579	just trust that no one pinch them
S0454	yes now i be
S0454	it's funny actually just the other day i be
S0579	yeah
S0454	think of do plant sales from the house cos no one do it round by me there's not anywhere so i be think of grow
S0579	have you get any
S0454	load of house round by me and there's no shop

S0454	so it's too late this year but if i do it next year you could start them indoors
S0579	yeah there's always someone gonna buy those aren't there yeah
S0454	yes and just put it on the internet and people would come round i'm sure cos a packet of seed be never any more than two pound but if you you can easily get them half price if you look around
S0579	yeah well
S0454	so a pound but you'd be sell them for well minimum fifty p i don't think erm people will pay a pound probably wouldn't they
S0579	yeah yeah so where
S0454	so that's a good mark up
S0579	i just there's still the same firm now actually paper advertise
S0454	yes

S0454	yes so you can only start them indoors and you can't take over all the room with that well yes it's it's

S0579	garden yeah i know the tune yeah
S0454	yes i think i'd buy a lot of those seed actually erm cos once they're in
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's easy like foxgloves be perennial
S0579	yeah
S0454	i think they biannual so they'll they'll last several years
S0579	yeah your mum tune in the past
S0454	yes she be yeah
S0579	yeah where do they i think she must have win a cruise somewhere some oh it must have be one of those performers i suppose cos he be sing rather nice tune or do something like that
S0454	mm
S0579	and mum go to congratulate him
S0454	oh right
S0579	and then she tell him she be a music teacher
S0454	ah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah i meet
S0579	mm
S0454	i have a lady stay with me last night and she'd spend about eight years work on cruise ship round the world not a bad job be it a hard job but erm
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos you know long hours but she be a masseuse on them
S0579	oh
S0454	but i say that must have be really tough because you know it's hard on your arm isn't it
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	if you do that all day long you'd be exhaust
S0579	yes they they work hard on those boat
S0454	they do and that's a very physical job
S0454	use only certain muscle
S0579	a lot of them on there be people from south america like on those boat
S0454	ah right yeah
S0579	we always find american south american guy
S0454	yeah
S0579	and er where do we see them yes a lot of a lot of them be sort of erm not white either they're sort of really
S0454	mm
S0579	sort of south american
S0454	yes
S0579	but they're always very nice people
S0454	yeah
S0579	and mum always get along well with everybody
S0454	ah that's nice
S0579	she's able to you know she also say she be use to be very shy
S0454	yeah
S0579	but no longer be she say
S0454	ah
S0579	yeah
S0454	what my mum
S0579	your mum yes
S0454	yes that's right i think that recently yeah she always use to say that but she seem okay and the same with dad actually dad i don't know if he be shy or just stress but he never want to talk to people but now he seem quite chatty
S0579	i think i think say he should cos he be stress
S0454	that's what i
S0579	as a headmaster yeah
S0454	yes i don't think he be really shy
S0579	no
S0454	i think it be more stress
S0454	yes cos he say in the supermarket he never go to those checkouts where you you know you can check it out yourself
S0579	no i can't really
S0454	he always go to the ones with people
S0579	honestly there can't put my head inside those
S0454	oh yeah the first time it take forever cos you don't know what to do
S0579	oh
S0454	but now they've get a new thing where they give you a scanner when you go in if you want not in morrison's they do this in tesco and you scan the food as you go round and put it in your bag and then when you get to the end you don't have to take everything out you just put the scanner on the machine and it tell you what you've buy and then you pay so you don't have to take everything out again
S0579	but if you forget to put something on your well then
S0454	i know yeah they do they and the thing be they don't check that often so it would be quite easy to do
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	er but they do random check so maybe every four time you shop there erm the lady will come over and say they're gonna check your shop and they just check you've do it right
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	but yes i expect that do happen it's quite easy to do cos i realise the other day when you you know buy bananas or something you have to put them on the scale and get the sticker and then i forget i have to scan the sticker so then i end up not pay for it and then realise too late
S0579	oh ho yes
S0454	because i put i scan it so i think that be it yeah
S0579	yeah you go back the next day and pay do you
S0454	so that be no good
S0579	oh
S0454	yeah well i realise when i get to the till so it be okay
S0579	yeah
S0454	i think well where be those on cos it show you what you've buy before you pay and i think where be the banana's
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	but it be okay we could sort it out but it's interest cos there'll be no staff leave in supermarkets at this rate cos that those scanners use erm you know the self checkout they only have one staff member on don't they for about eight or ten till
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	so that mean nine people have lose their job
S0579	there's someone in in the tesco one that's right
S0454	ah
S0579	he sort of recognise me
S0454	yes
S0579	he say i remember you come with your wife or something like that
S0454	ah that's nice yeah
S0579	so please to go there yeah
S0454	yeah that's lovely
S0579	but oh no it wasn't tesco's she go to what what erm somerfield's be it somerfield's
S0454	ah yes they've they've change to morrison's now
S0579	yes that's right
S0454	i think yeah somerfield have finish haven't they yeah
S0579	yes yes somerfield's that's right yes
S0454	or be it
S0579	where you could call them up use that's right mum use to go to somerfield's
S0454	i think so mm
S0579	dunno what happen that die a death do it somerfield
S0454	i think so i'm not sure what happen to that one i have oh maybe that's become co op i think somerfield merge with co op
S0579	oh do they
S0454	and safeway merge with morrison's or it might be the other way round yes cos we do this class the other day er sort of data description write and we look at the big supermarkets five years ago and there be more big supermarkets then now there's actually less competition than there be five years ago
S0579	oh yes it's really
S0454	there's really only four supermarkets in the run cos although aldi and lidl have become more popular they still only have about three percent market share so it's hardly significant
S0579	well well i mean in it's so tiny
S0454	yes
S0579	you know cos you look at morrison's with big build there er er
S0454	that's right
S0579	well you're lucky to find anything you want
S0454	well that's what i think i mean it be for some things it be cheaper but i mean you could hardly do a big shop there
S0579	mm
S0454	i mean i go the other day and i try to buy natural yogurt they didn't have any
S0579	no
S0454	how can you not have natural yogurt that's just basic
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	you know it's not a fancy thing it's and the same with the fruit and veg you you'll find you know very basic apples and oranges but if you want a pineapple you'd be hard press
S0579	oh yeah i know this guy who recognise me be he be compare say what it use to be like
S0454	yeah
S0579	he say now today it's nowhere near as good as it be but in in
S0454	that's right
S0579	years ago
S0454	yes
S0579	erm
S0454	so we talk about competition but there isn't really much not with the supermarkets
S0579	no not a lot no no
S0454	but they be compete more with each other i suppose
S0579	well i know er it be er supermarkets can ruin businesses
S0454	mm
S0579	the er
S0454	and farmers too actually
S0579	yeah i know they we use to well
S0454	yeah
S0579	and we use to go and meet up in in cos themselves to go to meet up with the people who don't come down from london
S0454	yes
S0579	good price i mean
S0454	yes cos they'll really
S0579	and he be all these egg and chickens and all that stuff
S0454	squeeze them won't they yes
S0579	you have to come he say i know they'd do me down if you don't
S0454	yes
S0579	so yeah
S0454	well a lot of them have go haven't they the greengrocers there use to be one on every high street but
S0579	yeah oh no
S0454	maybe one in
S0579	tell me
S0454	i expect you've get one
S0454	and the market you would have stall there wouldn't you
S0579	there's there a little stall in isn't there away up there somewhere on the corner
S0454	ah right yeah and often they're cheaper than the supermarkets which be interest
S0579	yeah cos he's usually get stuff outside and you know on for sale like
S0454	yes
S0579	that have a little space outside the
S0454	i find them quite cheap actually
S0579	yeah i do i do find them yeah
S0454	yes yeah they can be which be interest yeah they can be a fraction of the price of the supermarket for fruit and veg
S0579	oh
S0454	so you wonder what's go on with them don't you they're buy in bulk that's money's go somewhere someone's pocket
S0579	well the farmers haven't get it that's for sure no no
S0454	that's right yeah the farmers haven't get it
S0454	but yes i like go to the supermarket
S0579	do you oh
S0454	yeah i don't like shop but i like food shop
S0579	oh really
S0454	i never buy what i think i'm go to buy i'll go in for two things and i'll come out with fifteen
S0579	morrison's quite good for cake and stuff
S0454	oh be it ah
S0454	mm occasionally
S0579	and then the
S0454	yes
S0579	he sell cake
S0454	ah right
S0579	erm make not too far away like
S0454	mm mm oh grandpa you've do well i give you load of potatoes
S0579	and i've get more there yes
S0454	go through all those
S0579	yeah
S0454	i wasn't sure what vegetables you like i couldn't remember be it do you like spinach
S0579	not particularly
S0454	no i didn't think you do i have a feel you
S0579	old habit
S0454	yeah i have a feel you didn't like spinach
S0579	no no i didn't like cauliflower erm what do you what do you do with cauliflower
S0454	cauliflower cheese
S0579	cheese that's right not too bad
S0454	yes yes and broccoli do you like broccoli
S0579	i'm not keen on erm the cabbage and stuff
S0454	no i don't no i didn't think you like that yes
S0579	yes that's where your grandma love all those things
S0454	yes so i think maybe green bean be the safest wasn't sure cos that's what's in at the moment it's all broccoli and kale in the shop at the moment
S0579	oh yeah we use to grow a lot of those er runner bean years ago
S0454	oh yes they're nice aren't they
S0579	yeah i use to pull them out over there somewhere yeah
S0454	ah right yes i've get some broad bean in
S0579	oh
S0454	yes good for the soil bean
S0579	be they
S0454	yes cos they can take the nitrogen out of the air
S0579	oh oh
S0454	and fix it in the soil so if you've not get very good soil they're a good thing to grow
S0579	if you remember the fruit cage we have here once
S0454	yeah i remember that one
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	i i go out to look at the other day well you can't recognise
S0454	no
S0579	but erm you can see there's be something there but i use to have it all net off if you remember
S0454	that's what i remember
S0579	mm
S0454	be there any plant leave there or have they all die off
S0579	no i have it might be there's some
S0454	oh right
S0579	blackcurrants and raspberries and that sort of
S0454	oh right yeah
S0579	well i well we'll wait and see i suppose yes
S0454	mm oh i might go and have a look later
S0579	i i assume it's probably all cover with grass this summer
S0454	mm probably all brambles
S0579	and nettle and brambles and
S0454	yes have you ever eat nettle
S0579	no
S0454	mum love nettle soup
S0454	mm i i use to make nettle soup but it's an acquire taste if you don't like spinach then you won't like nettle
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	it's a very similar flavour
S0579	i don't like the cabbage family at all
S0454	no well if you don't like spinach you've have
S0579	no
S0454	then you're definitely not but nettle be incredibly good for you they're full of iron
S0579	oh that's
S0454	and vitamin c yes exactly it's very good for your heart and your blood and the thing with iron apparently if you don't have enough vitamin c then you can't up take the iron so it's no good just
S0579	oh
S0454	take iron tablets you've get to have fruit and veg with it or you won't absorb it so nettle have both together so you'll up take it
S0579	oh
S0454	and cheap as well free
S0579	oh yeah get a freebie yeah
S0454	that's right so i might go and pick some actually i be think next week and make some soup
S0579	yes yes grandma be always pick stuff from the hedge
S0454	oh do she oh
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah i do that as well
S0579	yeah well
S0454	i try primroses the other day
S0579	you can't make can't make er food out of that
S0454	no but you can eat the flower
S0579	can you
S0454	delicious absolutely delicious
S0579	oh
S0454	i'll go and pick one for you later
S0579	and you cook it do you
S0454	no just eat it raw
S0579	oh put me off
S0454	taste like sunshine if you could capture sunshine in a food that's what it would taste like it's very very sweet
S0579	oh catch some sunshine into food yet
S0579	yeah
S0454	very very sweet it's funny like nectar
S0579	oh oh
S0454	yeah it's interest mm
S0579	your up in the garden
S0454	yeah and i'm i'm quite interest in things you can't buy cos there be some foods even though they grow around you that you just can't buy like jerusalem artichokes you just can't buy and things like primroses no one's ever go to sell them for food but that's quite interest
S0579	yeah cos one one of the i say second largest erm market in the country
S0454	have it ah
S0579	come
S0454	be that every day
S0579	at least five at least five days a week
S0454	well that's pretty good isn't it
S0579	i think i don't think they have it on mondays as far as i can remember
S0454	ah right
S0579	but the rest of the week they're there
S0454	have they get a livestock market
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes cos i pass on the way up actually that it say livestock something
S0579	yeah
S0454	on the right i think oh that's that probably use to be
S0579	er well
S0454	where they hold them before they sell them
S0579	well that's quick though they have sales there now
S0454	oh do they oh interest yeah
S0579	yeah and the field there
S0454	yeah that's get a big livestock market still
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah i think like shop in doesn't he
S0454	he love shop
S0454	and mum miss it actually
S0579	oh right
S0454	cos she stop do it for a while cos he wasn't work and she be but actually she's never manage to get it back again cos he just buy what he want
S0579	what he want well that's sensible isn't it
S0454	yes
S0454	do you like food shop
S0579	i don't know i give it a think i know you have to do it like
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	i quite enjoy it just think it cos it's nice to anticipate what you're go to eat so you'll go round and you'll think oh
S0579	yeah
S0454	that's on special offer what can i make with that
S0579	well i i i never use to shop
S0454	no
S0579	when cos grandma use to do the shop
S0454	yes
S0579	but i towards the end of her life she use to ask me if i would go with her to
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	because she use to get mix up what first
S0454	yeah yeah
S0579	and all these and they say fifty five p oh how be i gonna get that oh fifty five p
S0454	yes well she didn't have very good eyesight for a while do she
S0579	no not in
S0454	with the cataracts so she probably have trouble see the money actually
S0579	yes exactly yes i have and i have
S0454	mm
S0579	do i have one perhaps
S0454	you do actually yeah
S0579	i've get
S0454	i think you still have but they say they would leave it cos it wasn't that bad they think yes
S0579	oh well that's what i say no no point in have cos it wouldn't
S0454	no
S0579	wouldn't improve it wouldn't get worse
S0454	no but then it be alright
S0579	well it be that's right take charge of that when she be here
S0454	ah right
S0579	a couple of years back
S0454	yeah that's good well it's as long as you go for regular check up that's okay
S0579	and she yes i do get a car
S0454	yeah
S0579	they also get them from eye opticians don't they
S0454	ah yes
S0579	they sell
S0454	yes
S0579	and then they get go i don't see the cars come like
S0454	your hearing's good isn't it
S0579	oh it's not bad oh
S0454	yes
S0579	no no no
S0454	you can get free hear test in your home now specsavers will come to your house and test your hear for free
S0454	but you don't need it yours be fine
S0579	yeah they that's funny you say it but i've just remember it now live with with your grandma
S0454	mm
S0579	use to come out to see her especially
S0454	ah that's good yeah
S0579	only have around test test
S0454	yeah all for for hear
S0579	yeah for hear that's right
S0454	oh for hear yeah that's good
S0579	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0454	yeah i saw that the other day i think that be very good
S0579	
S0454	go to people's house be sensible because i mean the people who have trouble be probably older
S0579	oh people's house yes yeah
S0454	and they probably can't go out very easily they might not be able to drive or
S0579	no mm
S0454	might not be able to get around easily so that's good
S0579	i think actually i think i think use a shop in the road sometimes so
S0454	mm
S0579	grandma do think she's er well towards the end she want me to be there because she couldn't count the money right
S0454	yeah i pay with a card
S0454	do you
S0579	er oh can i pay no i usually pay pound note
S0454	yeah ah right okay
S0454	you can't really go wrong with card and the good thing be well cos they can't take more can they
S0579	no no you you can always go back can't you
S0454	and yes you can always go back with the card
S0579	yeah
S0454	and actually in term of consumer protection you have more protection legally with a card cos actually with a credit card you're it's not you enter into the contract with the erm shop it's your credit card company enter into a contract when you pay on your credit card so there you've get the legal clout of the bank behind them
S0579	oh

S0454	crumble so you get that nice balance
S0579	that be super
S0454	oh good glad you like that i like that i think it look nice in the shop

S0454	i could tell and i think ah that's nice rhubarb there
S0579	well it's nice to see the
S0454	mm it look fresh yeah and it's funny they be sell it off cheap but i mean it it would've keep for another two weeks you could see
S0454	in the supermarket
S0579	in the supermarket
S0454	mm cos you know they put date on but sometimes the date be meaningless
S0579	oh er yes sorry they'd probably be there a few days then perhaps sell it off
S0454	yeah yes that's right it's funny cos some things do go off quickly but rhubarb doesn't particularly
S0579	well no like you've just it up doesn't it
S0454	yeah yeah that's right so
S0579	perhaps it hasn't do they cut the price as well do they
S0454	mm that's about half price it's only about a pound
S0579	oh well perhaps that's why probably not sell yeah
S0454	maybe yeah yes maybe that's i suppose quite a lot for a dessert mm early in the season though there's plenty more if you'd like it would you like a bite more
S0579	ah well i wouldn't say no to that
S0454	oh there we go you've get a very good appetite that's good

S0579	oh that's good go yeah
S0454	so erm yes if we can't eat it all that's alright erm
S0454	there's no point save a tiny bite
S0579	no no no
S0454	it's a waste of time
S0579	tomorrow never come
S0454	that's right yes there's no point it be really only
S0579	yeah that's lovely
S0454	a bite leave
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes be you alright with the ice cream cos there's cream here as well
S0579	oh yeah ice cream yes oh that's that'll put your weight on cream yeah
S0454	i know yes well i'd lose

S0454	oh yeah that's a nice photo
S0579	be his job reasonably safe again be it
S0454	mm yes he just they just erm
S0579	mm he be worry he be worry wasn't he with
S0454	yes
S0454	yes they've just do their second lot of cut but he's be alright
S0579	oh okay yeah so mm have another cut for some time i suppose
S0454	no
S0579	i suppose he could always get another job anyway
S0454	yes he's do enough hasn't he
S0454	mm i suppose the problem be they'll be he'll have trouble get a job in oil cos everywhere's cut job
S0579	that's right yeah
S0454	so then he'd have to retrain a bite cos that's what he specialise in
S0579	yeah
S0454	but he's okay i mean he's get his degree which be not in oil it be
S0454	a general civil engineer degree so he could always go into construction or something
S0579	oh oh of course it's it's yes er
S0454	mm
S0579	he always have long chat with him
S0454	yes yes that's right
S0579	mm i suppose have get the same sort of thing i suppose
S0454	mm
S0579	i think he be
S0454	he be a civil engineer
S0579	a surveyor of some sort yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	he be in with i suppose but i suppose he be use to the
S0454	mm

S0579	oh really he's not really a a fishy person like mum no no no no
S0454	i don't think he be no and in spain they tend to serve a lot it be very popular to have sardines whole
S0579	i know you smell em for miles
S0454	and then they er they have the head on still when they serve it you don't eat the head of course you you get rid of it but they cook it whole because it keep its shape better it doesn't dry out but he wouldn't eat it with er cos it have the head on
S0579	oh i remember when grandma and i use to visit spain occasionally you could smell that for miles away

S0454	just wrap it up like that in foil
S0579	nice fish
S0454	you can't go wrong mm cos it keep all the juices in

S0454	oh really
S0579	in an in a in a jar
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	yeah so er give it to the erm one of the waiters there
S0454	ah
S0579	an african guy he's in the he oh it's in a tin that's right it's in a tin that's right
S0454	ah he wouldn't know what to do with it
S0579	wouldn't know a thing no so it be what do i do with this tin he use to say
S0454	yeah
S0579	then have to explain what he have to do with
S0454	well it be a funny way of cook christmas pudding isn't it cos actually you boil them don't you
S0579	boil yeah
S0454	mm and not for a short time you boil them for four hours
S0454	and that's just the precook
S0579	yeah i know
S0454	and then on the day you've get to do another two hours
S0579	yeah er
S0454	it's quite a a thing isn't it a boil pudding
S0579	i think yeah oh i i think be upset actually he'd get this christmas pudding
S0454	probably do it wrong didn't they
S0579	er well yeah ah no it wasn't that it remind him of home too much
S0454	ah
S0579	oh i know what's happen that's right we send him a spoon and mum then or grandma i should say have the and erm i suppose it be
S0454	yes
S0579	and and as well and they sing christmas er sort of christmas things to them
S0454	ah that be nice
S0579	they they even use to put them on a disc i send it over
S0454	yes oh that wasn't
S0579	and and he put he say he couldn't ah he couldn't do it
S0454	no make him homesick
S0579	that that's fine about five weeks before he
S0454	ah yes it's funny be away from home at christmas
S0579	i i i remember the african guy's family he say what's in the tin how do i cook it
S0579	yeah
S0454	well it be it's a very british thing isn't it a boil pudding
S0454	and i expect that be a big thing years ago but now it's only christmas pudding isn't it we do like that i can't think of anything else you make in that way

S0579	jamie oliver
S0454	yes and i i weigh the ingredients
S0579	you do you

S0454	oh good i'm glad you like that i like it
S0579	consider it's all go yeah yeah

S0579	the rhubarb's quite nice too isn't it really yeah yeah
S0454	i really like it yes yes it's unusual very british

S0579	on all those canal
S0454	yeah take two weeks it take
S0579	yeah oh
S0454	and load of lock you wouldn't believe how many lock there be
S0579	well birmingham's full of lock isn't it
S0454	yeah so it's a huge amount go into oxford about ten miles out be about fifteen lock in a row
S0579	yeah
S0454	it take a whole day to get through they're like a staircase
S0579	well when live in wolverhampton which be only about ten miles from birmingham i suppose
S0454	mm
S0579	erm i be show my mum where we use to live
S0454	ah that's nice
S0579	yeah er well of course they've build a bite more now than there use to be
S0454	mm
S0579	er but what it remind of in my day along the er canal i suppose it be and the boat be there er like there be a horse pull them down the
S0454	yes yeah that's nice isn't it
S0579	they take with it
S0454	not horse draw they get eh er car engines actually they
S0579	they be yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	yes well in my day most of them be pull by horse
S0454	yeah
S0579	and you use to find one man with walk with the horse
S0454	mm
S0579	a young chap would guide the boat
S0454	ah right yeah
S0579	yeah pull it along yeah
S0454	yeah something
S0579	well i'll show you use to have
S0454	mm
S0579	i don't think she be too impress
S0454	yeah
S0579	what they use to do course be a bite into history so tell about sort of things pull sort of barge along he think that
S0454	yeah
S0579	medieval time i suppose
S0454	that's right well it's funny though they're begin to move cargo again on the
S0579	be they
S0454	the canal yeah i've there's some test project cos actually it's very cheap
S0579	that's right
S0454	it's not very fast
S0579	yeah
S0454	but it be very cheap still
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	cos you don't you know once they're move they'll keep move
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's they don't use much fuel
S0579	well they use to say no but i they use to say it be canal but really useful for the people live in stoke
S0454	ah
S0579	because of the pottery
S0454	ah right yeah
S0579	so you fill up your boat you know
S0454	yeah
S0579	with you know cup and saucers or whatever you're put on there
S0454	yes
S0579	and there use to be a lot go out
S0454	yes and things like coal as well
S0579	oh coal as well
S0454	heavy
S0579	coal's always heavy
S0454	so it's very useful whereas i mean imagine do that on truck how many truck you would need to fill
S0579	yeah yeah yeah that's right
S0454	it would be horrendous wouldn't it so you could only really do that on the railways or the canal still
S0579	yeah
S0454	so it'll be quite interest if that become commercial again
S0579	it well it would be yes
S0454	yeah
S0579	so lot of canal
S0454	we've still get a lot haven't we
S0579	yeah lot of canal
S0454	yes
S0579	well occasionally they do some don't they now yeah
S0454	that's right and there's still restoration go on
S0579	yes they're still do
S0454	yeah in wales they they're restore some of them
S0579	oh
S0454	and they restore the bude one but not all the way
S0579	no
S0454	the bude one be never very long and it never connect up to anything
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	it just go from the sea inland about nine miles
S0579	oh right
S0454	but they've dredge that one out and you can it's a leisure canal now though
S0579	i think this one be the one from or somewhere quite big canal
S0454	yeah yes
S0579	and course be always interest in a bite of history tell me horse and barge have be pull by horse and one guy use to stay on the boat and the other one walk with the horse
S0454	yes and it's still the law in the uk they have to keep a towpath open on all canal in the uk on one side or the other but that's from the horse that's the law and you know the only place in the uk where that doesn't happen
S0579	no
S0454	cambridge
S0579	be it oh
S0454	that's the only place
S0579	oh
S0454	cos they've build on both side right down you know the green of the colleges
S0579	well the the
S0454	and there be no public right of way but that's the only place
S0579	but they they don't use them too much though do they now
S0454	no but it's still
S0579	oh
S0454	the laws still there
S0579	oh the law yeah
S0454	so you can't close the right of way
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i mean it's wonderful for cyclists and walkers cos that mean every single canal in the country be public land you can walk down one side will be public land
S0579	oh well
S0454	so you can go for miles and it's easy isn't it i mean it's
S0579	well
S0454	navigation zero you just follow it
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yes lot of pubs along the way still
S0579	cos very often there's not two not two pathways yeah
S0454	no it's one side that's the law there have to be
S0579	yeah
S0454	one side
S0579	oh i think
S0454	yes but that's from the horse that they would of
S0579	yeah
S0454	have to of have those
S0579	cos i don't remember be you get a hedge i suppose the other side and haven't you
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah on those canal
S0454	yeah and it's very popular to live on the canal now
S0579	course we use to live very close to canal
S0454	ah right but on the boat i mean it's very popular
S0579	oh the boat yeah
S0454	cos it i'd work out when i be a student that rent a a room in a student house in cambridge be incredibly expensive
S0579	yeah
S0454	this be about ten years ago but it be over oh well over four hundred pound a month
S0579	ooh that's a lot of money
S0454	but if you rent a boat
S0579	oh
S0454	well you didn't have to share with anybody for a start
S0579	yeah
S0454	so at least the space be yours
S0579	yeah
S0454	and you can keep it as clean as you want to keep it it be only go to be about two hundred pound
S0579	oh
S0454	so half the price
S0579	oh
S0454	private
S0579	a nicer way of live too
S0454	and a nicer way of live but it seem
S0579	yeah
S0454	a lot of people have work that out
S0579	yeah
S0454	and apparently they're be overrun by the waterways overrun by illegal boat
S0579	oh won't
S0454	moor up
S0579	cook your own meals on the boat then
S0454	yeah i have erm a gas cooker
S0579	oh yes
S0454	just off those canisters
S0579	yeah
S0454	which we keep outside
S0579	yes
S0454	and er a gas fridge
S0579	yeah
S0454	so it be just gas er so that be very reliable
S0579	mm
S0454	and gas be very efficient you don't use very much actually for cook
S0579	where on the boat
S0454	yeah get these those big calor
S0579	yeah
S0454	erm canisters two of those but you
S0579	yeah
S0454	i mean in a year i didn't get through those
S0579	oh that's pretty good then yeah
S0454	yeah yeah it's pretty cheap and then the heat be off coal or wood a little wood burner
S0579	yes oh
S0454	yeah
S0579	you enjoy your up the river
S0454	i really enjoy it yes
S0579	oh well
S0454	yeah it's a nice way to live
S0579	you live another day then
S0454	yes
S0579	er it's quite nice on
S0454	yes have you ever take a narrowboat out
S0579	er have i take a narrowboat out i don't think i do actually i mean i seem to we be always watch them go by
S0454	mm
S0579	but er course they just go on and on there be one guy walk with the horse the other one steer like that
S0454	yeah
S0579	i really i don't go on oh i i do go somewhere outside wolverhampton actually on the boat somewhere
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	along one of the canal anyhow
S0454	mm yeah
S0579	do one of those erm
S0454	hm
S0579	must have know somebody who be on on one of the boat and they take me on there i think
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh use to take me occasionally use to take me fish
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	cos he be he use to i i be a fisherman he have all the rods and
S0454	ah
S0579	he give me a set free once
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	but i never use them cos i
S0454	no it's quite a bore sport actually i've never quite understand
S0579	oh fish sit all day
S0454	but yes dreadful
S0579	you don't catch a fish all day and they seem quite happy with that
S0454	no i know
S0579	and they use to take their meals and sit down at the side and eat their lunch and their suppers and
S0454	i have a feel it be to get away from the wife more than the
S0579	probably for some
S0454	the enjoyment of fish
S0579	yeah
S0454	i think there be an ulterior motive
S0579	yeah
S0454	or get away from the noisy children
S0579	yeah er

S0454	the catholic priests be fine you know they go round and they visit people as they should but the parishioners be not encourage to go out into the community and help the poor and if that wasn't the message of jesus then i don't know what be
S0579	no
S0454	but the other church be much better like the baptist church and the salvation army they're much more involve
S0579	i think they must be a little bite better off now than they use to be
S0454	mm
S0579	not as i go to them i know they do have meet together
S0454	ah that's good
S0579	you know because they've get the and there's another

S0579	yeah that's nice
S0454	then shall we go into the lounge
S0579	that's right
S0454	yeah i'll put the shall i put the dishwasher into the dishwasher that's easier isn't it
S0579	super wasn't it
S0454	oh i enjoy that yeah that's my first rhubarb in like a year but that be really nice
S0579	yeah yeah that be very
S0454	and actually i think that's probably my favourite way to have rhubarb with crumble cos it's a nice contrast isn't it
S0579	oh
S0454	yeah
S0579	yes
S0454	delicious so i'm glad you like it that be good
S0579	you manage all your cream then
S0454	no no i've get load leave that's fine
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	but i can always cook with it so er
S0579	how long do that last
S0454	er till the seventh it to the ninth yeah to the ninth of erm may so
S0579	oh
S0454	yeah plenty of time you can always cook with it
S0579	yeah well
S0454	yeah
S0579	go off
S0454	no no that's no good
S0579	no no
S0454	yes right i'll just fill the
S0454	no
S0454	well they
S0579	oh really
S0454	you know like an old egg timer so i i put the stop watch on cos if it's things like twelve minutes it's actually very difficult cos i have several things in the oven so i have the
S0579	oh
S0454	have the crumble go and i know what time that would finish but then i put the fish in
S0579	yeah
S0454	and that be suppose to be twelve minutes and i have the potatoes on
S0579	oh
S0454	and that's twenty five minutes and we have the bean on which be four minutes
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i need the fish to be time properly
S0579	oh
S0454	cos if you get that wrong then
S0579	and haven't do properly
S0454	it's quite a mathematical challenge
S0579	yeah
S0454	i think that you know that cos i have to think well that go in first the
S0454	well the crumble go in first because that be half an hour but i mean at least that even the time erm but things like the potatoes you've get to work it out because the potatoes would take longer than fish
S0579	yeah
S0454	but then the bean would take less time than the fish you've get to have sort of timeline work out
S0454	otherwise they all finish at the wrong time
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then it's cold ruin
S0579	oh dear dear oh
S0454	yeah the crumble work perfectly
S0454	that be that be er
S0579	nice nice flavour good
