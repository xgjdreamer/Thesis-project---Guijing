S0439	yeah she need something didn't she
S0441	she do i'm put it in the oven now
S0439	i always find the oven quite quick i know it's you know i always find the oven quite erm quick actually if i'm honest
S0441	ah
S0439	what be you do
S0441	hit my leg
S0439	oh i do erm i've join the yoga they do yoga in the every sunday so i've join that
S0441	yeah
S0439	the first session be really fuck hard her name's
S0441	yeah
S0439	she do the one at the gym
S0441	what do she look like
S0439	she's quite a erm a round woman brown curly hair not curly hair but like long but wavy kind of hair and she erm it be an hour and a half and it be really intense
S0441	how much be it
S0439	erm it's a hundred and twenty pound for fourteen weeks course or something like that no that's why i think because like because all of the run i'm just stiff all of the time and i don't stretch enough so i think yoga would be a good way of
S0441	it's so good
S0439	and it's on a sunday night at half past seven so it's kind of like you know it's just a nice way to end the weekend i guess
S0441	yeah
S0439	cos i'm always here sunday night really so
S0441	what time be it at
S0439	half seven till nine
S0441	oh be it
S0439	but just like some of the position be so intense and it's just like although i think she do slightly hurt my knee cos i've get slightly bow in knees and and my knees slightly curve inwards erm and she keep try to like make me like straighten them
S0441	they always tell you to straighten them out don't they
S0439	yeah and i and i have a really sore knee for the whole of last week like i genuinely be slightly worry i wouldn't be able to do the run cos my knee hurt so much like i have to strap it and take like diclofenac and ibuprofen and things like that but i complete it fine it be it be okay but i be a bite concern it be go to hurt or that i wasn't go to be able to run properly and i think it be because she keep tell me to straighten my leg out without like ease into that position but just to properly straighten it
S0441	no that's really weird that that she do really
S0439	yeah
S0441	that she wouldn't like do it slowly
S0439	yeah but she she be really good but i don't know cos you always expect people like she be very much into her yoga and she be all about the spirituality of yoga and the the she be like if you want to join in with the the please do i be like no but erm but then it's weird because she be quite not unfit but just she be a bite overweight erm there's this one pose where you have to kind of not do a press up but you have to lower yourself into the right position and then straighten your back out and you have to go down with your arm so it be a bite like a press up all the way to the floor and she like it's take me a long time to learn to do this because you have to support your whole body weight and everything and i be like it's not that difficult
S0441	mm
S0439	she just seem like slightly unfit
S0441	maybe she just eat shit
S0439	yeah but she be like really into her yoga and everything it be really good

S0441	no we get on really well and it be a really good opportunity to have like chat about things and make plan for the future
S0439	what do you chat about
S0441	so we've actually officially decide to move in together
S0439	that's good
S0441	yeah
S0439	and when be you go to do that
S0441	well probably in like two years
S0439	okay
S0441	which would give me give me time to save up
S0439	mm
S0441	but the thing be if i it's difficult cos i i don't think i'm go to be able to save up any money here
S0439	no
S0441	so i'm i i haven't ask my mum yet but i might ask if i can move home
S0439	when i move out i'm go to probably move out officially move out
S0441	i know i know i know i know i know but you know you're just sort of live for your own mean aren't you
S0439	oh yeah like my salary i do not save
S0441	no
S0439	i try and fail miserably
S0441	it's really annoy i try and fail miserably
S0439	i mean i do go on holiday but
S0441	yeah but that's it
S0439	that's the thing like this holiday be ninety nine pound like the one i'm go on be ninety nine pound like i should be able to afford a ninety nine pound holiday
S0441	yeah yeah
S0439	and i still struggle
S0441	exactly ninety nine pound be nothing really
S0439	exactly
S0441	in the grand scheme of things so yeah so i'll keep you post with that
S0439	oh yeah no it's fine
S0441	what's go on it depend it it i don't know cos he he's obviously so much further ahead than i be
S0439	mm
S0441	and i don't like he doesn't want it to be all him i really don't want it to be all him
S0439	no
S0441	like if we put a deposit down i wouldn't want him to put
S0439	no when you move in move in together you mean like buy a house
S0441	we need to yeah we need to buy a house and we need to we need it to be half
S0439	mm
S0441	like half each cos i'm not
S0439	yeah cos then not think of the negative but if you do break up it it would be him
S0441	yeah i know i know so it be really good like because it be so chill out and stuff and i guess normally when we're at weekend together
S0439	it's a bite
S0441	you can't really talk about that kind of stuff
S0439	no
S0441	cos you don't want to like waste the sort of time talk about serious stuff
S0439	and if you do have an argument it's two days that you're not go to
S0441	yeah so it's just waste so we talk about it it be really good and cos he's never really actually say to me yeah let's move in and let's do it
S0439	yeah
S0441	here or whatever
S0439	yeah
S0441	it's always be sort of pie in the sky sort of thing
S0439	yeah
S0441	but this time he's actually say yeah let's make a plan let's save up and we'll move in together you'll save up i mean in all fairness with him he's be worry that i wouldn't have enough money that's why he's not really commit to it because he doesn't want to
S0439	he doesn't want to have to support you yeah course not yeah
S0441	and that's absolutely fine that's clearly understandable
S0439	yeah no it's like it's hard and the house be big like they're massive investments
S0441	yeah
S0439	like if i be with somebody and they didn't pull their weight i'd be annoy wouldn't you you don't want to resent somebody
S0441	exactly you you you'd no and you know i don't want to be the person that sort of like just
S0439	it would be it would be his house it wouldn't be your house it'd be his house so
S0441	yeah no
S0439	yeah no it make perfect sense
S0441	so yeah that's excite
S0439	mm
S0441	but it won't be for a while

S0441	i don't want to live in
S0439	i wouldn't want to live in you can't save money here bollocks if you're go to save any money in

S0439	i could imagine you as a stripper
S0441	i couldn't i would be so awkward
S0441	people like be horrible

S0441	yeah maybe they'd pity me they'd like throw money at me for pity
S0439	come see the stripper who's the worst stripper ever

S0439	she'll make you laugh and cum in the same half an hour
S0441	ah this be just such a cheese overload but i don't care
S0439	love cheese
S0441	so yeah i will let you know what's go on
S0439	yeah no no don't worry about me i'm all good
S0441	but yeah
S0439	like i'm still debate on whether if go back to to go back to with her so
S0441	okay well
S0439	don't worry we're all good
S0441	when do she go back
S0439	next june
S0441	okay what so you'd give up your course
S0439	i actually give it up
S0441	you give it up i do wonder why you weren't study
S0439	i couldn't do it it be like they want us to do fifteen hours a month erm a week and
S0441	and it be too much
S0439	they'd move the exam forward it be suppose to be the end of september they move the exam forward to mid august and i well i be in and i couldn't do it and they be like well you have to do it i'm like well i can't
S0441	can't
S0439	and so i decide that i'm long distance learn be probably not work for me so
S0441	do you pay for it
S0439	yeah but they give you your money back
S0441	well that's good i would have think they wouldn't give it back
S0439	no they give me i think they take a hundred odd pound for like the induction and stuff but
S0441	oh so you you you don't pay it in bulk
S0439	no no i didn't pay up front i pay like in instalments
S0441	well that's good
S0439	but i just couldn't do it i didn't have i didn't have the time and i be like it's not worth four thousand pound if i don't do as well as i would've do so
S0441	no but could you imagine if you like do but just didn't get very good grade
S0439	exactly
S0441	that would be shit
S0439	exactly so i be like
S0441	would be a big waste wouldn't it a waste of money
S0439	yeah completely that's what i think it didn't work so i will probably i want to try and look at go back full time
S0441	what to do a course
S0439	yeah
S0441	okay
S0439	i still i still would like to do the psychology and the become an occupational psychologist it's just when i do it
S0441	yeah
S0439	so
S0441	well it could be a sort of a thing to look forward to or no no but plan for work
S0439	yeah exactly so i've get like this year i want to do a year at obviously
S0441	yeah
S0439	and then
S0439	yeah no no i've get to head off in a minute to go watch the bake off anyway
S0441	okay
S0439	but like i want to do obviously finish the year at and i want to carry on till like next definitely definitely want to carry on till like next easter next summer because that's when all my project come and i want to complete some project
S0441	yeah
S0439	erm so i could start uni next september or the september after i wouldn't want to leave it too late but i'm still
S0441	and as well probably bite of advice like psychology people if if you're not just like a undergraduate learn psychology like everyone else do
S0439	mm
S0441	they perhaps would look for more mature people anyway
S0439	yeah
S0441	for that sort of life experience
S0439	exactly
S0441	so i think it's probably better if you do wait
S0439	yeah
S0441	not too long obviously but
S0439	yeah i'm glad i try and i do really enjoy it i just couldn't just couldn't dedicate fifteen hours a week
S0441	it's a lot of hours
S0439	yeah and
S0439	full time work and then obviously i be train for this half marathon i just couldn't fit it all in and i be like i'm not go to do it justice cos i don't want to waste my money so i decide not to do it
S0441	you have to literally do like an hour a night
S0439	you have to do like two hours a night yeah
S0441	yeah
S0439	plus like a whole weekend and i just couldn't do it i couldn't fit it in especially not with all the run and everything so
S0441	yeah
S0439	no i'll get there okay i've get to go and watch bake off
S0441	if i do move out i mean obviously we have to wait for the end of the lease anyway but what would you do in that time if i do do that
S0439	i'd just find somewhere else what like next january in january
S0441	i guess
