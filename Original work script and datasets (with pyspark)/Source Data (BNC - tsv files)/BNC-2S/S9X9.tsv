S0284	what be his name
S0282	john john
S0284	john paul john

S0282	yes
S0284	officer in charge and the controller from outside
S0282	yes
S0284	er and she's do shakespeare work with trevor nunn erm in america
S0282	mm
S0284	er so so erm so she's not a household name
S0282	no
S0284	and she's she's something as you know do do some significant work
S0282	mm
S0284	er that just pop out from time to time and this be a trevor nunn production so i think he turn her her age and er when he be think of it
S0282	mm
S0284	and that's how she become
S0282	okay so who and who's play er madame
S0284	er
S0282	the main actress
S0284	now now now you've you've get erm i can't remember her name i can't remember her name erm er and and the wife have a much more prominent role
S0282	oh do she
S0284	as as well that's the thing she be actually she be really big
S0282	right
S0284	er i think that's the thing that's the thing that they be they be all roles of equal status
S0282	mm
S0284	equal equal size really
S0282	oh that's the thing
S0284	er that be the difference between that and the film
S0282	mm
S0284	and erm erm i just can't remember the name at all no can't remember the name at all but it's the same thing the erm erm the wife be play by the the dark head actress the role of prim actress who be in the sex and the city
S0282	ah yeah
S0284	er american er
S0282	that's a name i really can't remember
S0284	i can't remember either we can't always remember it's jp
S0282	mm
S0284	so it's just and the ginger one and er of course kim cattrall
S0282	oh yes
S0284	kim cattrall who didn't she do some western roles
S0282	mm yes
S0284	and some sex and the city
S0282	mm well she turn out to be
S0284	yeah she be isn't she
S0282	yeah from who do you think you be
S0284	yeah yeah she be she be a erm
S0282	by some reprobate male ancestor who run off and leave all his dependence and erm until he go to america turn up but it be her father or her grandfather have get all this erm i just leave this country and leave all these women and children
S0284	mm well yes well i get one not far back and we don't know what happen erm yeah my cousin's still look into it
S0282	mm
S0284	and oh i think that be a bite
S0282	oh no there's only one no there's two no there's one oh
S0284	and no my cousin's still still research it but things don't things don't match up with with those census record and there's a family story that erm someone around that time be be marry be marry twice
S0282	mm
S0284	er probably not bigamously but erm
S0282	oh right
S0284	so we don't know we don't know what happen that time
S0282	alright
S0284	so
S0282	oh
S0284	well that's not terribly far back
S0282	well i have a similar thing my great grandmother run off with somebody during the first world war leave five children erm who then have to go and live with their aunt
S0284	mm
S0282	and run off with somebody who be ten years her junior
S0284	mm
S0282	and er they er then have another family and she have another four children so what with the one that die in infancy that be ten children that she have anyway she er my great grandmother divorce her and so she eventually marry this other guy erm and
S0284	mm
S0282	well she live with him the whole rest of her life and i think be very happy but erm my father er my grandmother would pretend that she die and my father be always tell that she be dead when in fact she wasn't she be only live about er thirty five or forty miles away in erm in nottingham
S0284	oh wow wow mm
S0282	and only die in the nineteen sixties so it would've be perfectly feasible to
S0284	mm
S0282	to er have meet or know her actually
S0284	mm mm
S0282	but erm but anyway she be erm her family except they don't want to know our family
S0284	mm
S0282	because erm there's still somebody live from my grandmother's generation who would probably kill him of shock if he find out
S0284	right right mm and that's intrigue cos she didn't have any the options weren't so weren't so wide as they be now as they be be they
S0282	well no cos cos it's of cos if the before erm we didn't know what happen we couldn't know if she have get marry to this guy or if they'd live together erm bigamously or erm or whether erm she have she never get marry to him or what have happen and erm and it would've mean that i would've need to work out when they be likely to have be divorce
S0284	yeah
S0282	from her first husband and then work out where it take place and i would've have to then to do sort of do quite a lot of research you know dig about manually as it be and give that she have quite a not a a totally common surname but a relatively common surname she only have one first name and one surname so therefore
S0284	mm
S0282	even in the year where she be bear there's forty or fifty women bear in that same year with that exactly the same name
S0284	yeah
S0282	and erm we didn't know the name of the man she'd run off with so erm so it all sound a bite impossible until such time as erm one day she just pop up on a ancestry dot co dot uk search
S0284	wow wow gosh yeah
S0282	mm so and then which be divorce record
S0284	right
S0282	so somebody some labour in somewhere some in america i think probably
S0284	yeah
S0282	the record and there's you know make a note on it on the digital file and up it pop so something have lose forever just suddenly rise the top of the file
S0284	yeah wow yes well you're erm you're very fortunate like that aren't you cos some
S0282	mm
S0284	no one know anything about my mother's family or or that's that's that's the story
S0282	mm
S0284	and i be try to track down some friends who live from their facebook entry look as if they might've their friends from college they might be live erm just three or four miles away from me
S0282	mm
S0284	same place scenarios as actually
S0282	oh right
S0284	and so what do i have to do i have to in really try to track down them i i have to pay five pound to gingery unite and i only use sort of fifty pence
S0282	mm
S0284	in try to track down the the other people
S0282	oh right
S0284	er and so often one that'd go by they remind me i only get another three days to use my remain four pound fifty and i probably be talk to my cousin on my mother's side and she talk a little bite er and her cos she just one of the reason i move here be cos her cousin be only down in fareham
S0282	alright okay
S0284	so she's only half an hour's drive away
S0282	mm
S0284	and she er er have send me a copy of the marriage certificate of my grandfather and we know about my mother's father's side but not my mother's mother's side so i just put in put in her name and and the record come up very quickly with her father's name and i track down
S0282	mm
S0284	her father's name and you know within three or four search then add then add erm yes yes that's it because there be a reasonable amount of information for
S0282	mm
S0284	mother's mother
S0282	mm
S0284	and erm mother's grandfather which actually explain explain a lot
S0282	right
S0284	because not that they always pretend that erm she be as she be
S0282	no
S0284	it seem to me
S0282	right
S0284	i mean i didn't know but as soon as she she she i mean she be fairly militant as a as a as a woman and as as as as a feminist
S0282	mm
S0284	erm er and that be great so i be bring up take it for grant that if you work full time as a warden you didn't do housework
S0282	mm
S0284	er er and and things like that so i i just take it for grant that that erm er that reasonably educate women do if they want they do do have a do have a job
S0282	yeah
S0284	as as my mother always have
S0282	mm
S0284	erm
S0282	what do she do
S0284	she be a teacher
S0282	aha
S0284	a teacher she she teach erm there would be children they would call her erm mother or er children or i think there's a politically incorrect word for erm er children with learn difficulties or
S0282	oh
S0284	or erm i can't even think of the politically incorrect word any more
S0282	
S0284	oh i i can't remember
S0282	thank you
S0284	thank you erm and er her subject well actually be french she she get a degree in french but she say she she claim er i keep on say she claim because at the time i be never sure that if she be actually say the truth or say something but she claim she couldn't bear to see school children wreck the french language so well it could've be better
S0282	oh dear
S0284	yeah anyway she she'd always erm claim that she'd never be bring up to do cook and housework and and er my first three years of life be be spend in in sudan where there be people to do the cook and the housework erm and when we come back to england she then much resent have to do that
S0282	mm
S0284	erm and part of the resentment she say be she be never bring up to do this
S0282	right
S0284	anyway long story short
S0282	be she very be she bring up in a family then
S0284	er well
S0282	but they do have to
S0284	i think it be all pretence because erm through the search which i just do a couple of months ago
S0282	yeah
S0284	i find her grandfather be a coal miner
S0282	oh really okay
S0284	er and erm what be interest be sort of the set he be actually a a forest of dean coal miner
S0282	oh yes
S0284	er since twelve by charge of twelve ninety two or something like that
S0282	mm
S0284	erm anybody anybody bear in the hundreds of some rebel gloucestershire which be forest of dean er be entitle to erm take the minerals in forest of dean
S0282	oh wow
S0284	so he have a whole lot of er individuals erm dig dig dig kill
S0282	what the mine
S0284	yeah
S0282	their mine
S0284	mm
S0282	oh
S0282	he could've be he could've make a lot of money
S0284	he he could've do
S0282	i guess so
S0284	he possibly do and
S0282	like the american or something
S0284	mm he could've do and on this marriage certificate oh his daughter's marriage to erm my mother's father erm he's describe as of independent mean
S0282	oh but the he make a fortune out of it
S0284	erm well plausibly he have but in the same way as if if if you're if you're do a a census in builder and what his occupation be then i i've do this on one on on one set of survey then then sometimes so they'll come out with company director
S0282	right yes definitely and then yes it just come in the door
S0284	erm that's right that's right so so we just don't know that's that's an that's uncertainty
S0282	mm
S0284	but it will explain why mother be a bite try to erm try to say she be and she be she must've be
S0282	mm
S0284	feel a bite insecure about erm
S0282	mm
S0284	er about her er grandfather be a coal miner
S0282	mm
S0284	and
S0282	what year be your mother bear
S0284	say again
S0282	what year be your mother bear
S0284	nineteen thirteen
S0282	oh okay
S0284	and
S0282	my my granny's bear in nineteen 0 three and erm you would you would've think she be extraordinarily posh the way that erm that she sort of er present herself to the world but er
S0284	yeah
S0282	she really wasn't
S0284	wasn't she wasn't she
S0282	no
S0284	what what be the sort of what be the conflict what where the differences between er
S0282	oh it's well there's more than a no i mean i i erm my my grandfather's family be kind of er one of the shopkeepers of england i suppose
S0284	yeah
S0282	and erm so erm the the family have a restaurant and a deli and a delicatessen in stratford
S0284	mm
S0282	erm my grandmother's father be a chauffeur in a stately home erm and actually work in buckinghamshire when i when be her family where he be the chauffeur for for many years and then he have his own cargo his own cargo right after after the war
S0284	mm
S0282	where erm erm which it still exist but he be a sort of garage so he be probably the same thing where he be a company director but there be probably only him and another another bloke or another couple of blokes
S0284	mm mm
S0282	and erm so erm so i think my i think it probably stem from the shame of her mother run off my grandmother's sort of social not not pretentions but she really really want to be respectful and she wouldn't countenance anything
S0284	mm mm
S0282	that would you know denigrate her in any way socially in front of other people she be always very sensitive about that and stratford upon avon which be a place
S0284	mm
S0282	erm be full of ladies who who who have pretentions and there be that stuff which be terrible it be a terrible social war i guess throughout my grandmother's marry life as to who be the poshest who have most money who have the nicest house who have the most background who not not like today who have the most expensive holiday and stuff like that or who have the biggest cars
S0284	yeah
S0282	but really who be who be most refine and most gentile out of everybody
S0284	yes
S0282	and erm
S0284	yes
S0282	and and it be really quite sad i think
S0284	yeah yeah
S0282	so erm
S0284	yes
S0282	you be allow to have a shop but er or a business you know that be okay because they're mostly business people and then the and things like that so you be allow to you know you you didn't have to be erm london gentry or have dependent mean or something like that it be okay to work for a live but it be really who have i suppose whose the least defective this i suppose
S0284	yes yes and the nuances which i tremendous ones i mean my mother
S0282	yes
S0284	rumble about about relatives er and i don't i lose track because she'd she talk as if you know who all these name that she turn out be
S0282	yeah
S0284	and there be one particular member on her side who she say be have run off with the barmaid who wear pink blouses erm
S0284	and and you know there're two nuances
S0282	yeah
S0284	erm
S0282	well at least two three possibly yes run off barmaid pink blouses i er pink blouses be
S0284	the barmaid and the pink blouses and it come across of the it be hard to tell whether it be the barmaid or the pink blouses
S0282	yeah
S0284	cos my mother's quite a heavy drinker so she probably think barmaids be good things erm erm
S0282	but only if they
S0284	erm that's that's right anyway go off with this barmaid er who wear pink blouses only only possibly she just wear a pink blouse on one occasion
S0282	yes
S0284	and erm it produce children and she say you know like i'm pretty sure those children don't know they're bastards
S0282	yes
S0284	and again i didn't really comprehend
S0282	yes well actually my great grandfather
S0284	why that be important
S0282	actually also get together with somebody who use to be a barmaid his name be
S0284	uh even better
S0282	yes
S0284	mm
S0282	so my grandmother could barely say the word without without spit or hiss or or have to wash her mouth out with carbolic and be actually a very nice lady and have a couple of children one of whom be call so that be i mean not pearl common name to call people as well isn't it
S0282	so my my poor grandfather be sort of terribly you know sort of bring down by the world by this feel so my nan i think probably spend a great deal of time try to disguise all of this stuff
S0284	mm
S0282	and hide it from everybody
S0284	mm mm whereas now
S0282	well people go and and then er
S0284	be be he be he
S0282	or do you do you think allow that you know you know to have marriages and all sort of things in their past people go to jail
S0284	yes yes and nobody nobody mind or care or
S0282	no
S0284	or anything but it be i mean it be amaze how how strong all these nuances be further down the social scale i mean you could
S0282	yes
S0284	okay so erm people didn't receive all of these cos she be cos she be divorce even before she
S0282	mm
S0284	go off with erm erm but erm she wouldn't be receive just cos she be divorce and er yeah yeah
S0282	so i think that yes it be erm things have change
S0284	oh it's much better when other people say oh modern life be dreadful and i i i think quite the opposite i think modern life be be great in in the sense that the erm that's what a social condemnation and the cover up of things
S0282	mm
S0284	erm what edward norman call the secrets and narrow privacy in family life
S0282	mm
S0284	er be not nearly so not nearly so so cover up as they as they once be
S0282	yeah
S0284	so much more healthy
S0282	oh be go up
S0282	this be suppose to be a quiet environment not as only this thing be quite good at not pick up background noise but
S0284	mm
S0282	who know erm so erm so what do your father do i i didn't catch what your father do he didn't he he love literature so
S0284	yes he be
S0282	but he he be a teacher as well then
S0284	yes he yes he be he
S0282	but but that be
S0284	yeah he be he be a lecturer
S0282	ah
S0284	erm a university lecturer
S0282	how many be in sudan as a child be that cos he be teach then
S0284	that's right there be in khartoum there be a university college erm which do external london degrees
S0282	mm
S0284	er i i think in in in a there be quite a lot of colleges like that in various bits of erm empire erm not that sudan's actually empire as such it be an anglo egyptian condominium
S0282	right
S0284	i read it somewhere and erm yeah and that be his job straight after straight after the war er there be some very odd things go on i think in his family er we only discover my sister discover about twenty years ago this be about nineteen forty three or nineteen forty four my my mother and my parent have be marry for a couple of years and have a child of about one my mother announce that she want to leave my father
S0282	oh
S0284	and he come back from where he be
S0282	mm
S0284	and er manage to persuade manage to persuade her not not to go through this
S0282	mm
S0284	er and i think i think that mean that immediately after the war she say well i don't want to stick around in dreary old britain erm when i can't get any food and everything's a bite drab and and grey
S0282	yeah
S0284	erm er i think father felt a bite pressure into keep things together by agree with her
S0282	right
S0284	i don't know that's just pure speculation
S0282	oh right i suppose they must've go away for a new start or something you know
S0284	erm
S0282	sort of get away from perhaps get away from bad influence or like a new start somewhere else or
S0284	well the thing well i think you know once people have be demobilise er the bad influence be be less cos i think it be just a general war time er atmosphere of of er couple be separate
S0282	yes
S0284	and be be fairly young
S0282	yes
S0284	and she be in bristol where those club and social life and all that sort of thing
S0282	yeah
S0284	and and so i think it be part of that really and the people she be involve with don't know could could well've be american for some reason i sort of have a feel about that
S0282	ah
S0284	and
S0282	it's funny about all those facts isn't it because you know there're sort of bits where you have to imagine something where it's very difficult to find out the truth of the matter because it wasn't then record or if you could know something it's not necessarily true you know so say for example my uncle say to me the other day oh well how do my great grandmother meet erm who be the guy she go off with and and nobody know how that happen it could even have be her husband that introduce them erm or else er
S0284	yes
S0282	you know they live in a place which where the house be turn into military for train so
S0284	yeah
S0282	so you know perhaps he go there on train while her husband be away we just don't know that's that's another story that my great grandfather chase them through the station of the
S0282	and then he just stop them leave and that nobody know if that's true or not because it's just it be just part of a story and nobody remember where they hear that
S0284	mm
S0282	and whether that be factual or whether that be a supposition or
S0284	mm
S0282	whether they imagine that that would that that be a sort of thing that he would've do have
S0284	yeah of course that's a wonderful erm sort of elaboration isn't it
S0282	yeah
S0284	which be yes yes it's it's such a shame cos we didn't know the question to ask
S0282	no and also
S0284	and
S0282	yeah how do you i i don't know i suppose if i go to the archive erm and read the local newspapers of that time from that place perhaps it might turn up from one of those then but
S0284	mm
S0282	that as a story that you know somebody run off and i have i have erm get the the transcripts of the divorce placement thing and my great grandfather have a compensation which erm
S0284	aha
S0282	and the judge award him compensation because he'd lose his wife this man have steal his wife and erm and so and it take them many years to be able to afford to pay it back but they do actually pay back this sum of money in the end
S0284	right
S0282	which be erm
S0284	gosh
S0282	well i don't know i mean i suppose you be that you be legally entitle to that money at that time whether it be an act of vindictiveness to go for it or whether your solicitor or your barrister tell you you have to cos otherwise you'd there be some kind of culpability or or whatever i don't know but there we be
S0284	wow wow yes
S0282	mm
S0284	yes think that's that's erm
S0282	yeah do you want to erm do you want to go and sit outside and carry on or shall we stop there
S0284	yes yes let's
S0282	let's see if we shall we see if we can slide out whilst talk
S0284	yes
S0282	and go outside past this hoover mind you
S0282	the hoover'll probably be a bite inaudible for a bite but you're suppose to do it all in one go so you're not suppose to sort of stop and start again
S0284	i see
S0282	that's the oh look at this
S0284	i see right
S0282	oh
S0284	so can i make a pig of myself and
S0282	yes go on
S0284	you you don't want to make a pig of yourself
S0282	no because i'm suppose to be on a diet
S0284	oh
S0282	yes
S0284	mm i'm erm erm
S0282	and erm but you know when you go out it's a treat so i'm not i'm not be on a diet when i'm out with people because that's just too bore and grim and i know i'd feel mutinous and i'd feel vindictive about life no no no no no
S0284	mm well i'm on a i'm on a non dairy diet
S0282	ah well there so you'll have
S0284	so so

S0282	there be word for things and the english language be a fantastically rich language so you know and it do have more it have more word than french by a long way and so it have get nuances in word
S0284	well it it it do but er yeah but but er listen to younger people sometimes i wonder whether whether they do use language with nuances like they like they use to
S0282	ah well this be one of the aim of this project be to work out the differences between how young people speak and how older people speak
S0284	oh be it
S0282	so one of the sort of things that they say to me in an e mail be you know we're particularly interest if you can get young people to do record
S0284	right
S0282	so i'm gonna go off and talk to my nephews
S0284	yeah no that's interest
S0282	at the weekend
S0284	that that that really be interest cos er
S0282	if i can get them to sit still for an hour that'd be a miracle cos they don't do anything for an hour
S0282	they're just they
S0282	everything be on the double really with them they can't listen to a whole piece of music
S0284	yeah
S0282	erm they've get to fast forward it erm i'm afraid they're not very academic so they've just come back with some very very poor with some poor erm result from their exams but never mind
S0284	oh oh
S0282	i don't
S0284	yeah and how do you get involve in this project
S0282	because a friend of mine erm be a pr agent and he have be erm and he get send an e mail and he obviously send it to everybody in his inbox and say erm who be anybody interest and i think oh that's really really interest i mean there be i be go to do erm some oral history with erm there be a there be a job i be go to apply for and i didn't apply for it in the end erm but erm somebody have give a heritage lottery grant to erm the guild of quilters
S0284	oh yeah
S0282	to do an to do an oral history of quilters and quilt
S0284	yeah
S0282	so i erm so i think oh this be really interest and i be er just about to apply for the job when i saw that there be an exhibition in at the and i think well
S0284	yes
S0282	i must go to this exhibition and erm there be a sale there as well erm so erm we and i go and there be this crush of women of a certain age
S0282	all in candy colour rainwear
S0282	and with very sensible shoe and very sensible hair
S0282	who be behave like a giant flock of starlings they be just land on everything squabble elbow er just behave in a really unseemly manner and erm just sort of claw at each other and claw at things to make sure that they they get things before other people get things and i just think i cannot spend three years of my life with these people
S0284	yeah
S0282	i be quite interest in quilt but there be no way that i be go to associate
S0282	with erm these people for the next three years because er i mean
S0284	mm
S0282	i presume that these be the people that one will then be send to interview
S0284	yes
S0282	so that's erm
S0284	yes
S0282	that be all a bite of a disappointment really but erm
S0284	wow
S0282	but i'm very much into oral history anyway cos erm one of the things one of the historians that i very much er like at university and since be stud terkel do you know stud terkel
S0282	oh stop stop drink
S0284	so what be they what be they gonna produce next
S0282	i don't know erm
S0284	stud terkel why have i hear of stud terkel he sound like a porn star really
S0282	he no he be he be on a canadian erm radio presenter but he do oral the history so he do an oral history he do he's do the great depression he's do the second world war he's do book about death he's do book about poverty all oral history so he sit down and he record people talk and then the book be just absolutely unexpurgated and unadorned account
S0284	aha
S0282	so erm so one of erm when i be i think be i study the i can't remember if i be study the great depression but erm i be i be able to impress my university tutor by be able to give first hand account of the of the erm of the great depression nineteen thirties in america from you know some people who actually witness it
S0284	oh yes
S0282	and as i tell you earlier my university lecturers be all ex oxford and cambridge and they be all look at how you learn and teach history in a different way
S0284	yeah
S0282	and therefore erm you know that that be a kind of approach that would impress them history from time resources
S0284	yes yes yes i see i see gosh yeah well and so where be we yes yes i be in erm
S0282	completely lose my train now
S0284	mm
S0282	oh yes we be talk about quilt and we be talk about oral history and how i get involve in this project that's how we get to here
S0284	yeah yeah yes yes yes through through through a friend
S0282	yes
S0284	yeah yeah that's that's brilliant that's pretty good
S0282	yes i'm go to go round and find people who there's there's various i'm suppose to be do a bite of a history about the charity that i'm chair of at the moment so i'm gonna go round and have conversations with trustees and ex trustees because we're open our build up for the open house weekend in september
S0284	mm
S0282	and i'm i'm go to be erm i'm go to be erm sort of try to produce a little handbook about our project and erm to hand out to people who might come round hopefully people will come round
S0284	yeah
S0282	we're right opposite the build of the in brixton so it be entirely possible if they open that they will have ten million visitors and we will have none well we will only have people who be an overspill and can't get in there and just come round our build while they're wait to queue to get into the other one across the road
S0284	yes yes what church be that
S0282	oh it's call er at so we have a we have a church an old church we look after date from eighteen twenty four but it's be convert so it's a community centre now rather than a church
S0284	right
S0282	it's right in the middle of brixton oh there's dance
S0284	yes oh the dance yes
S0282	yes
S0284	it's a good idea i i haven't reply
S0282	yes
S0284	cos i be away but erm
S0282	no that's alright
S0284	but er yeah that sound that sound good that sound good that sound good i've be try to think of people to ask to come
S0282	yes well if we sell i don't know how much people would be prepare to pay
S0284	mm
S0282	a tenner fifteen quid
S0284	yeah erm let me think let me think mm ten come to mind
S0282	mm and then we'll do drink for ten quid or just to get in for ten quid
S0284	erm possibly just get in for ten quid or possibly ten quid and get the first drink possibly
S0282	mm oh yeah that's a good idea
S0284	er yeah and then after that after that carry on carry on play
S0282	yeah cos i actually make this massive it's massive well i call it a tape keep say to me it's not a tape erm of erm my all my favourite dance music which be seven hours worth by the time i'd i'd to compile a a playlist
S0284	gosh gosh and
S0282	and erm and then so i be and then nobody would get up and dance my could not believe it and for the mistake i make be i should've set up music in a separate room with no furniture because the way i set up the house i think that we'd turn the light out
S0284	yes
S0282	and start dance round in that open space but everybody be already sit in comfy chair and eat with the light on
S0284	yes
S0282	so i would've have to switch the light off turn the music up
S0284	yes
S0282	and just cut across everybody's conversations
S0284	yes
S0282	so so there be not much to be do really
S0284	no no there wasn't there wasn't erm erm that's why some people yeah well they're interest people to chat to as well and interest chat we have
S0282	yes oh you speak to
S0284	er i
S0282	my friend in the in the window seat
S0284	i do yes
S0282	she say oh that he be very frustrate he wouldn't say how he know
S0284	didn't i
S0282	no she say i keep prod him to say well how do you know how do you know her and you wouldn't reply
S0284	oh that's right that's right i didn't that's well
S0282	she say i have to give him a lecture in the end and tell him that how could i could possibly start to play more have a conversation with him unless i know where he come from and you know
S0284	that's very reveal of of isn't it yes but erm no i think i be i be go through a phase of not want to be and i know one isn't not not not want to
S0282	yeah yeah let one in yeah
S0284	include include where we meet
S0282	yes
S0284	in the definition of who i be
S0282	yes
S0284	erm because
S0282	i know do you get on with her because she's very musical and her kid be really musical as well do you find that out
S0284	i do i do i do er yes yes and i be a bite of jealous cos they be all all better than me er
S0282	ah
S0284	and yes i do i do discover that
S0282	how do you know not her sing necessarily
S0284	erm
S0282	but you're a singer aren't you rather than
S0284	yes
S0282	an instrumentalist
S0284	yes i be yes
S0282	i only play silly things like bazooms
S0284	yes
S0282	it be not the kind of thing that you take to a party in case somebody ask you to play
S0284	that's right that's right and and er yes yes yes there be a yes so she be she be a good good good good person and
S0282	she's very nice i've know her for
S0284	and it's almost that i don't like to be define by by things like that anyway
S0282	no
S0284	so i i do once go through a phase of not tell people what i what i do for a live er and would refuse to say well you know let's let's talk about erm what my view be on erm dwarf throw
S0284	and you know that's far more interest than the bore old erm
S0282	yes
S0284	what what do you do for a job you know what do you think about dwarf throw
S0282	yes but be a very ardent feminist in my younger days i use to go very about you know these conversations about what do you do because you know erm you're gonna be define by by whether you get a job or if you haven't get a job how much you get pay
S0284	yeah
S0282	how senior you be yes i know and one come round to the same
S0284	you understand
S0282	debate over and over again
S0284	you're
S0282	different time
S0284	yes yes yes you understand i know that's that's that's erm
S0282	yeah
S0284	yeah yeah and it be and everybody be i mean yeah june and july this year be a be a time of er when i first get into that period of think well they're it's not merely survival after not just survival i'm not just into survival i'm actually into into life after
S0282	mm
S0284	cancer treatments
S0282	mm
S0284	and that's and literally be just june and july
S0282	really
S0284	it be the first time for
S0282	mm cos you just cos you be erm
S0284	to erm
S0282	erm you get back into
S0284	years
S0282	sing cos i remember you say either earlier this year or last year that you have stop be interest in the things that you've be interest in all your life and you just have no motivation and yet you say
S0284	right
S0282	you just spend sorry how many weeks have you spend away at summer school now or be it a week be it
S0284	yeah three three weeks three weeks
S0282	three weeks
S0284	three weeks yes
S0282	and whose whose summer school who organise it
S0284	erm there be two summer school one be call er
S0282	alright at
S0284	it be a charterhouse
S0282	uh
S0284	er start by erm
S0282	ah
S0284	in nineteen forty six
S0282	ah the great
S0284	yeah erm and erm have have run since then and the other one be be which start about nineteen fifty two at
S0282	mm
S0284	and
S0282	but these
S0282	be these for singers for choir for choir
S0284	er they be for oh choir solo singers orchestras of different size chamber orchestras string orchestras wind orchestras erm er jazz er piano componists and composers
S0282	oh fine
S0284	so there're there're there's there're sessions on the people who want to do all of those things
S0282	yeah
S0284	and as it happen those charterhouses decide they can make more money over the summer holiday er by let up the school to erm er sport sport train for example
S0282	oh
S0284	and so both summer school have to move and they both er have move to in dorset
S0282	aha alright
S0284	so these run consecutively
S0282	right
S0284	er
S0282	and you go to both
S0284	i go to both yes
S0282	mm
S0284	it's cos some of the people who tutor on one tutor on the other as well
S0282	right
S0284	and
S0282	ah
S0284	so there's a bite of a bite of an overlap
S0282	yes and so erm you enjoy it
S0284	yes yes very much very much very much yes erm
S0282	and do you wish to do you erm prefer be in a choir or do you like be a soloist
S0284	i prefer be a soloist
S0282	do you
S0284	yes yes i
S0282	and what's your what be your favourite genre
S0284	oh that er that's difficult to say because i keep on discover lovely music erm from all periods so it depend i mean i've just discover one by i take a song by thomas arne
S0282	arne a r n e
S0284	arne a r n e
S0282	yeah
S0284	who's famous because he what's thomas arne famous for
S0282	i don't know
S0284	rule britannia
S0282	oh be he
S0284	yup
S0282	oh right see i see music be one
S0284	yeah
S0282	huge gap see i'm with i'm like music like you be with literature
S0284	right okay fair enough
S0282	well not quite actually not quite as bad i'm just not
S0284	well i have admit to read george orwell and that's that's
S0282	yes that's true that's true yes
S0284	that's literature p g wodehouse do that count as literature
S0282	yes you'd i'd say he's a classic now cos you'd be read classics without know it
S0284	well i could
S0282	i think that's classics with a capital c or classics with a small c
S0284	right right
S0282	okay classics i suppose classics with a capital c obviously would be sort of a big set of piece i guess
S0284	yes yes
S0282	and erm with a small c be just anything that be now deem to be a classic
S0284	right right
S0282	such as for example a few years ago in the guardian or the observer i can't remember which say these be the top hundred novels of all time and you really have get to read these novels
S0284	oh yes yes
S0282	so i think well and i cut it out
S0284	i do remember that
S0282	and i discard the children's ones and i think the j k rowling rowling and erm oh what's his face well who's that extremely pompous sanctimonious person erm
S0284	erm philip pullman
S0282	yes
S0284	yeah
S0282	so i cross those out cos i think
S0284	yup
S0282	actually i'm not read those cos i'm a grow up and i don't need to read these things and then that leave me with the rest and so er and actually i set about for a few years try to read all a well i have read i probably read about forty of them already or something
S0284	yes
S0282	part of them all possibly more than that so i then i set about try to read the others yes so which lead me to things like don quixote which
S0284	oh
S0282	actually as you say before with or whatever you call him
S0284	yeah
S0282	it depend on the quality of the translation
S0284	yeah yeah
S0282	because erm don quixote in some translations be absolutely unreadable
S0284	yeah
S0282	and you cannot imagine for a second why it's on the top list hundred list of novels in fact it's very long
S0284	yes yes
S0282	like if it be just length
S0284	yes
S0282	anyway
S0284	yes
S0282	so but erm with erm we be talk about your genres and you didn't really say
S0284	yes erm so so so er there's since it happen with music generally over these last years i have listen to so much in the course that like i've be discover more good music from all stag so i i find one by thomas arne he's he be seventeen ten to seventeen seventy eight or something like that
S0282	mm
S0284	and er write a lot of stuff erm some of which have be lose erm and i find a lovely song by him which be a bite in between baroque and classical
S0282	mm
S0284	so o come o come my dearest and hither bring and so on erm but i also sing one er sing a song from sixteen hundred and two
S0282	mm
S0284	by caccini erm which again i come across this year and like very much and oh oh perhaps and perhaps a little bite like in the earlier music erm sixteen hundreds perhaps
S0282	oh
S0284	purcell purcell's
S0282	oh right okay
S0284	purcell's quite quite good erm and quite erm quite rude at time
S0282	mm
S0284	which i quite enjoy cos vulgarity be one of my favourite genres
S0284	erm what be the other one erm oh and a mozart aria that i hear some in the last year and think i could wonder if i could do as well as the as the singer
S0282	oh right
S0284	between that
S0282	well
S0284	so that's that's sort of expand from sixteen 0 two sixteen 0 two to seventeen ninety erm so so anyway my favourite genre be the be the one i last do
S0282	okay
S0284	but erm but i'll i'll take the thomas arne for audition piece for next term
S0282	mm
S0284	erm
S0282	oh do you have to audition to go to these place
S0284	erm no but next term at er to join the opera group what you do be you you audition you take a song and from what the people turn up from the people who sign erm to to the producer she then decide what opera she want to do with the voice that've come forward
S0282	oh that's an interest approach
S0284	which be yeah i think about it it's actually a sensible thing to do
S0282	yeah
S0284	erm with the with the shift
S0282	rather than swap square peg into round hole or whatever
S0284	exactly yeah
S0282	and i guess actually it's just the lack of or whatever
S0284	yes yes erm exactly exactly and and yes with a a shift population that you haven't yet you know then you'll you'll find that people be er yeah you you just don't know who you're gonna get
S0282	mm
S0284	and who's get a job and go off and of the recent postgraduates
S0282	yeah
S0284	whose whose stay on for another year and whose
S0282	that must be frustrate as well lose people that you know you're think oh yes that's person be go to key up and be a central person here and they just wander off cos they get another job or their circumstance have change or something
S0284	yes yes in fact last year conduct the chamber choir be er er somebody who be do it for the first first time and she's primarily a school teacher and and it be a little bite er it be very clear that she wasn't really at ease with the undergraduate situation so
S0284	you know week three only half the choir turn up you know where be all the others well so and so's get an instrumental lesson and so and so's get to get a composition invite tomorrow and so and so be not feel well and erm
S0282	so tonight i'm go to have fin if you don't turn up
S0282	yes so i be erm talk to an art tutor that whose class i go to and we be talk about what make people go to art class or not and er and er you know the day of the week be quite be be quite important because a lot of people work part time
S0284	oh be it
S0282	well yeah no no i mean not
S0284	oh yes
S0282	any particular day of the week but any individual so you know might not be able to come on a like us you know meet on a tuesday even
S0284	yes
S0282	erm there you know they'd be i i can't come
S0284	of course
S0282	to class unless it's friday afternoon and he be cos he's a proper artist he be like oh you know
S0284	yes
S0282	why it should be effective by the lack of if somebody's get a shift on a friday afternoon or whatever
S0284	yes
S0282	and then certainly in colleges they're very strict they they really tell you off they're phone up these days ask where they where you be if you don't turn up for class
S0284	yes
S0282	because they only get pay by result so if you drop out
S0284	yes
S0282	or you don't turn up or only half the people wander in and they're late then erm the tutor get their wrists slap
S0284	yes
S0282	so they actually now call you up they send you a text or something they say where be you
S0284	yes yes i i hadn't realise until last year that happen with undergraduates well as as you know it happen with undergraduates as well
S0282	i didn't know
S0284	oh yeah yeah erm
S0282	i only go to three lecture in the whole three years or something like that no it's probably a slight exaggeration but
S0284	yes
S0282	but we learn early that if you want to drop out you have to drop out quick because if you be if you get down to the last sort of half dozen they start to realise who you be and certainly you could be follow up if you drop out really early then nobody could quite track whether you be ever
S0284	right
S0282	suppose to have be there or not
S0284	yes yes it be it's a it's a bite more of a it's a bite more of a a a a sort of market be not quite the right word but it's it's it's quite quite different now cos people be
S0282	mm
S0284	pay such vast fee for
S0282	mm
S0284	for erm for their for their education
S0282	yes well i think
S0284	er
S0282	we be all we be conscientious you couldn't you know you be we be erm know well enough to know if you be skive or not and people be follow up if they you know if they sort of disappear but and and actually have a very good education because it be in such small group and with things like tutorials so you know you know tutorial be only with only two or three other people so one or two or other people so they certainly know if you weren't there and if you hadn't do your essay
S0284	mm
S0282	so erm
S0284	mm yeah
S0282	so you couldn't really but it wasn't so
S0284	yeah
S0282	it you weren't keep out as you know it's not like fling a register or something or
S0284	yeah yeah
S0282	perhaps they leave it more to us to be self discipline
S0284	they do they do but only a a lecture have to be reschedule erm because a lecturer be ill
S0282	mm
S0284	and er erm at the reschedule lecture as it be about to start erm somebody say i'll have to leave early er so the lecturer say why and she be i've i've i've get to go to my job er and he say what's your job it's it's in a restaurant and where's the restaurant he say in in soho
S0284	erm he be due on a his shift start at twelve o'clock
S0282	mm
S0284	at twelve midday so he get to leave erm at er quarter past eleven which it simply catch him out because er because of the change in the time it be on the day
S0282	yes
S0284	of the of the lecturer
S0282	yes
S0284	and and that's take me by surprise because i didn't realise people actually have have to work
S0282	when be this
S0284	this be last summer
S0282	oh yeah no i think a lot of people work through
S0284	erm
S0282	now
S0284	they do they do but i mean one of the first time round forty years ago er one of our lecturers who be canadian by origin you know be terribly scornful of us
S0282	mm
S0284	get grant and not have to pay tuition fee cos in when he be an undergraduate in canada and and america erm everybody er all students or most students work
S0282	i can't see why that's desirable
S0284	erm
S0282	i really can't i mean i i suppose that that i'm well like like you from a sort of privilege time because not many people get to go to university
S0284	mm
S0282	you know
S0284	mm
S0282	and we be a very small percentage of our age who could go and er perhaps it's only now that i look at it and think quite clearly that be such a privilege
S0284	yeah
S0282	and such a boon to have
S0284	yeah
S0282	that amount of money to be invest in you as an individual with no kind of expectation at the end of it erm
S0284	mm
S0282	and erm so i do i do value it i value it cos it allow me to leave home but
S0284	yes yes
S0282	and i would never've be allow to leave home for like university it would've it would've be much more difficult to to explain why couldn't stay at home any more
S0284	yeah yeah
S0282	but erm but anyway erm but these days i mean it cost so much
S0284	yeah yeah exactly
S0282	it's good though isn't it i don't have to go right up to the wire on this so i don't know allow for erm who of us
S0284	helicopters
S0282	and that be a helicopter well that's just about it isn't it the end of
