S0336	okay
S0337	okay so do co op versus ai erm yeah that that'll be brilliant
S0336	yeah that one
S0337	so just so
S0336	match me
S0337	yeah yeah and just wait a five minute wait i guess it's only four o'clock in america so
S0336	and i imagine as well there's very few people that be play on intro
S0337	yeah
S0337	oh so this be the normal process
S0336	yeah i don't think i've do this bite before
S0337	no no you haven't you've only do okay so these be the three champion for the week you get give these ones as start
S0336	yeah
S0337	boom boom boom boom erm i either go for the top leave or the top right whichever you fancy
S0336	that one
S0337	you've play her before but shall we do top right then just to mix it up a little bite yeah
S0336	so what do i do here
S0337	right okay well you don't have any run yet cos you're level one
S0336	okay
S0337	but if you go to masteries and you click on the little pen and edit your masteries okay so you can make multiple mastery mastery page on the top
S0336	mm okay what's a mastery page
S0337	but but right okay okay wait there so you've you've only get one available point
S0336	okay
S0337	and on that on that page you can you can put it on something
S0336	okay
S0337	and each of these basically i don't know it's worth something
S0336	okay
S0337	so oh actually yeah so if you wanna have damage damage there you can you can see what they all do attack speed cool down reduction and you know it's hard to you you you
S0336	okay
S0337	the rest i'd just
S0336	okay
S0337	have erm attack speed just cos
S0336	okay
S0337	and then click save masteries but on a different champion you want some more defence or
S0336	yeah
S0337	more offence or utility
S0336	what's utility
S0337	utility be
S0336	oh shit i probably
S0337	doesn't you don't have to lock in
S0336	oh what's the countdown mean
S0337	i dunno i can't remember but erm utilities be stuff like
S0336	take my rengar
S0337	oh the champion below you there
S0336	oh yeah
S0337	up yeah that's a rengar
S0336	oh
S0337	yeah erm oh man if we have a laptop now we'd er if we have a laptop i'd be next to you erm yeah utilities might be recall quicker or more er one extra gold when you kill a minion what your ping
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah erm play on er uk servers should be like less than thirty that mean you're probably five your reaction between the game be five time slower than other people
S0336	that's great
S0337	but it's it's not fast it's not that erm big sorry it's not actually that big their computers be oh no they're bots never mind
S0336	mm
S0337	these be a really slow computers actually
S0336	er er
S0337	erm definitely think a laptop should've be on our list a bite higher don't you
S0336	yeah but it's christmas soon
S0337	oh yeah erm that tesco's thing through the door have some price match on like hudls be hudls any good
S0336	i don't know oh i guess you'd have to like have a look
S0337	look at them
S0336	review online i suppose
S0337	cos just to read stuff it might be worth it erm or then again a kindle as oppose to an actual ipad
S0336	yeah
S0337	can you still watch things on kindle
S0336	yeah er you know the kindle fire
S0337	the fire
S0336	yeah i think it's still cheaper than an ipad but it work as a kindle and as an ipad type thing
S0337	so you have two settings
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah show me er some cisco train that he's gonna do it's six hundred page but it say you can do it in sixty days you can learn everything you need to know about erm cnnp which be the qualification in it

S0336	wahoo
S0337	happy with that
S0336	yeah they've say i've win that's good
S0337	yeah that's good
S0337	i wanna er i kinda wanna play the same champion just just by two or three kill
S0336	i definitely get confuse between

S0336	my leave and right click
S0337	leave and right click
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah yeah
S0336	and i i didn't i don't know what mana be so
S0337	yeah some champion use it energy or rage or some don't even have anything but generally mana be what the blue bar underneath your abilities
S0336	yeah
S0337	and let's say an ability take to fifty mana to use erm so you can only use it twice cos you've get a hundred mana before it need to slowly recharge you see it there
S0336	oh i assume it have to recharge after every go
S0337	no
S0336	oh okay
S0337	but each each ability have a timer but it still have a mana cost so er er yeah i kinda wanna run to the middle and kinda wanna run to the middle just do the q and the e and just show you just yeah
S0336	you wanna show me how it's do
S0337	well not show you how it's do as such yeah maybe a little bite
S0336	it's gonna take time you weren't amaze on your first go either and you have a lot of like game experience
S0337	how do you know if i wasn't amaze on my first go
S0336	cos you're not amaze now
S0337	well i'm better than you so
S0336	well clearly

S0337	mate you should see them on that hexakill thing whatever it's call i'm gonna carry on rammus mvp mvp
S0337	erm yeah
S0336	there's just a lot er if i think i'd be okay if there if you could learn it in bits
S0337	yeah
S0336	but there's just so much it's like it's not just like all the different things it's this mana and it's it's buy stuff and it's it's there's like ten different things you can be kill and they all die differently and like it's just hard
S0337	i've tell you about that game rakion chaos force haven't i
S0336	the what
S0337	rakion chaos force it's a game i play years ago and no one er literally no one in the world play it it be so much fun i wish that be still a thing it be a bite like this but you have like you're more zoom in and you could like if you be if you be the archer remember that one guy over there

S0337	it's get a certain it's get a max range it can be and that's about let's say that big
S0336	yeah
S0337	when you first start it start there so the longer you hold it down the the
S0336	ah
S0337	the the further away your arrow can go yeah you see it we should go and get the blue buff it just make make it more fun for you that you can keep use your abilities

S0336	i just panic
S0337	i know i'd back cos you've get so much gold three thousand four hundred gold you've get eighteen kill with no deaths there's be thirteen deaths so these idiots you're play with have manage to die between them thirteen time
S0336	well er to be fair
S0337	you've get almost half of your kill
S0336	i've get the advantage
S0337	okay i'd go i'd go bottom leave
S0336	this one
S0337	to be honest yeah erm and i'd go that as well and you've get quite a lot of gold still so i'd go all items and i'd go with that okay good stuff let's go and look at the score okay so you're eighteen for nil the garen only have five kill and three deaths and malphite have eighteen kill four deaths but ashe have three kill three deaths and the warwick have two kill five deaths
S0336	yeah
S0337	but that's all a joke because obviously they're program to be terrible

S0337	and that be utterly terrible
S0336	that's the kind of shit i'd do
S0337	we'll push we'll push sorry push bottom lane again push keep stick to your lane
S0336	okay
S0337	it's the easiest thing for you to learn just that's that's basically half the game will be in lane until you know those outer turrets that you kill right at the start
S0336	i don't know what to tap
S0337	your your mouse be all the way over here
S0336	oh
S0337	yeah your mouse wasn't where you be look
