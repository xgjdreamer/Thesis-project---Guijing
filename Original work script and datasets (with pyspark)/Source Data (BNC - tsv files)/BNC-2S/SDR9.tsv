S0083	mm i might have another one i'm quite peckish
S0084	mm bet you be mm
S0083	oh that's okay you er the thing be you should also speak to each other because be go to well he be come back but he be obviously he be watch the football and he didn't know what time dad be back and we didn't know what you be do or you know um so i be hop that we could you know combine the things but anyway
S0084	oh i'm sure he's go in to dad's cos then he would have say oh
S0083	yeah
S0084	where be you take the car
S0083	you see
S0084	i would've say mum's and he would've say well i wanna come with you
S0083	you see won't say i'm go to mum's later he'll just say i'm go to mum's now
S0084	mm
S0083	when he decide to go
S0084	mm
S0083	he won't think ahead er which be annoy cos you know
S0084	no i have no idea
S0083	no i know
S0084	never know he be here
S0083	mm well exactly why would you think it er you know it's just that he doesn't think ahead so you have to do it for him and it's it's just you know
S0084	mm
S0083	it's just annoy um anyway it's fine i mean either dad can bring him over or he can get the bus or or
S0084	mm
S0083	whatever it's fine
S0084	or his bike
S0083	mm yeah that's fine
S0084	mm mm mm
S0083	nice this cheese isn't it
S0084	mm yeah it's pretty good
S0083	i be just peckish when i come in
S0084	mm so what do you get in the amnesty shop
S0083	er
S0084	you get the other jane smiley do you
S0083	sorry
S0084	you get that jane smiley
S0083	i do cos it's a much better copy
S0084	mm
S0083	it's actually really nice it's you know almost new sort of thing so i think and i only pay a pound for that one
S0084	hmm
S0083	so i think i'd charity shop that one
S0084	no
S0083	but if you wanna read it first that's fine
S0084	mm well
S0083	it be recommend i haven't read it yet
S0084	okay but well i think i wouldn't go to the bookshop because i wouldn't be able to take anything with me cos all my book be in box
S0083	mm that's true
S0084	cos it it seem a bite unfair to turn up and not take anything
S0083	mm that be true well it's not just that you could you know if you don't take anything you can pay more
S0084	oh okay
S0083	and still go in and take book but you know
S0084	but then you pay more i suppose
S0083	mm
S0084	and the idea be that you don't clog up your house with more book
S0083	yeah exactly it's
S0084	so
S0083	and it's a good way of yeah
S0084	mm
S0083	anyway
S0084	mm no it be a really good idea
S0083	mm
S0084	be it run by people that you know
S0083	no i think there would be but there weren't i meet and a couple of other people but
S0084	mm
S0083	um yeah
S0084	do they go to the um strauss thing yesterday strauss kahn
S0083	um didn't um i'm pretty sure other people do but well i know i mean i know the usual suspect do but
S0083	i don't know whether jenny do i think she might be there this afternoon but um
S0084	mm
S0083	but she wasn't so i should give her a ring actually i might do that in a minute he didn't put that back this morning so i think i'll come in and hoover and then i stop to have something to eat but i think i will put the hoover over quickly
S0084	i think he just leave it out because he be come back later no point hoof it
S0083	well that's what he do but i would've put it back
S0083	you know but anyway
S0084	mm
S0083	no i mean he would've leave the whole thing so
S0084	mm yeah
S0083	but we do have to sit here in the even so
S0084	how do it go with the woman yesterday he wasn't very talkative when i try to ask him
S0083	no he wouldn't be er it be good
S0084	oh third time be the charm then oh no this be a different woman
S0083	it be a different woman but i get the feel i mean nothing be say obviously she's gotta go and talk to people but
S0084	mhm
S0083	it's quite difficult talk it over
S0084	sure
S0083	i mean it's it's quite a difficult thing for all of us to do
S0084	mm
S0083	but at the end the things she be say she be say oh you know i i need to speak to my superiors and i need to do this i need to do that um
S0084	oh right
S0083	but she didn't er she didn't just say er clearly you don't qualify um she didn't say we do but
S0084	mm
S0083	i dunno i just get the impression that you know it would go through
S0084	okay
S0083	so i get everything across i mean i could be completely and obviously it's not her
S0084	it's not her final sign off
S0083	say so but she's very experience she seem she know exactly what she be do what she be talk about
S0084	good
S0083	so
S0084	okay
S0083	er um well we'll just have to wait and see
S0084	and be she talkative about this sort of declassify of his condition cos be say that they've you know a few months ago they'd decide to now classify it as a syndrome
S0083	we didn't mention that
S0084	as oppose to oh right
S0083	mm
S0084	think think it best not to probably for the best
S0083	that be a very kind of unresolved question
S0084	well yeah well er i mean it'll only rear its ugly head if it's gonna affect the fund isn't it you know if they the they decide that his condition be not as severe
S0083	thing be he you know he's entitle to support
S0084	well clearly
S0083	the question be
S0084	the fact that he have be for the last five er eight years
S0083	well exactly
S0084	whatever it be
S0083	um she um i mean as far as i can tell talk to dido er sorry dodi who's also a social worker
S0084	mhm
S0083	and i speak to the autistic society as well speak to them at length
S0084	mm
S0083	um this be not unusual apparently so um
S0084	right
S0083	but the thing be it's just a question of which department you know cos each department have its own fund the same as you do
S0084	yeah
S0083	you know same in social service
S0084	mm
S0083	um and er
S0084	mm
S0083	if if they er as a department as a learn disability department won't fund things then another department should
S0084	mhm
S0083	but we'll see i don't know i don't know she didn't go into that
S0084	no
S0083	so i think that's what we have to talk about when she come back to us
S0084	right so do she give you an end date for that
S0083	no
S0084	mm
S0083	no cos obviously she pass things you know she then have to sort of take it to the next level and speak to them about it she will report to them what she learn from the assessment and you know
S0084	mm
S0083	it's very bureaucratic
S0084	yeah of course yeah and presumably the fund differ from county to county
S0083	well it do i mean everything differ from county to county
S0084	yeah it's mad isn't it
S0083	it be completely
S0084	you'd think it'd be more uniform
S0083	you would think so
S0084	mm mm well it's a wait game then
S0083	and the good thing be i mean she do say this actually because he get dla as well as income support
S0084	mm
S0083	well it's esa now but anyway and he he's always have the disability live allowance
S0084	mm
S0083	and that's a national award obviously that's from the government that's not
S0084	yeah
S0083	local
S0084	yeah
S0083	um when she hear that he get that she say oh that's good and i think that make a difference you know if if he's
S0084	if he's see as need that
S0083	need that then that will help his
S0084	mm
S0083	claim i think
S0084	so be he still get that even though he's live with dad
S0083	mm
S0084	yeah right
S0083	yeah because it's his entitlement
S0084	right okay be he get less because he's live with dad how do it work
S0083	no but what they what they're do and she talk about this and i think this be new this be you know follow on from you know various budget things um they sometimes make people contribute money to their package whatever
S0084	mm
S0083	their fund package be
S0084	mm
S0083	you know how many hours how much money how many this that and the other
S0084	mm
S0083	they ask people to contribute towards it especially if people be you know sort of comfortable then they expect that
S0084	mm
S0083	which i think er fair enough
S0084	yeah
S0083	but not many disable people be in that position so
S0084	mhm
S0083	um and he's certainly not and she say sometimes you know if if people have no money at all then you know it's gonna be a you know nominal amount
S0084	mm
S0083	well that's fine so maybe they're look at that
S0084	mm
S0083	and if if he have to contribute some of his i mean it's tough but especially while he's live at dad's it wouldn't be as bad i don't know i don't know i mean it could be cos he's you know he he have no other money apart from that and his father's retire and i
S0084	mm
S0083	don't have any money
S0084	no
S0083	it could be that you know on that basis that you know he won't have to make a contribution but the fact that she be talk that's what i mean she be talk about this
S0084	mm
S0083	scenario and i'm think if you think he wasn't gonna get it you wouldn't actually bother go into all this
S0084	no it would be very unfair
S0083	mm
S0084	sort of raise your hop in that way
S0083	i mean there's nothing definite
S0084	no of course
S0083	because they can easily do that but
S0084	yeah
S0083	it just make me feel that you know she think it be
S0084	well that's encourage
S0083	we'll see we'll see
S0084	yeah it's just a wait game now isn't it
S0083	it be but that be a huge step do that so
S0084	yeah yeah i mean it's difficult for him i know but he just he need huh but it's i mean i don't know i don't know what the answer be but he need to have a bite of a better attitude more positive attitude i know it's so so hard it'd be hard er if i be look for job but it's all very well him say you know i there's nothing that i wanna do and isn't life very difficult for me and there be an element of need to take a more
S0083	he can't do that though
S0084	positive attitude
S0083	he doesn't have a positive attitude for several reason
S0084	i know it's flippant for me to say that
S0083	no no no
S0084	and i i know it's
S0083	no
S0084	probably i'm not be able to understand his position but i do know that that that that's what he struggle with but you know with a supportive family behind him and us you know suggest things and i know er you know the support
S0083	the thing be
S0084	necessarily might not be there
S0083	he can't he can't the the the problem have always be with try to get him something to do job course whatever be the fact that he can't imagine what it's gonna be like if he hasn't do it
S0084	mm
S0083	the things he have do he hasn't like hasn't fit in hasn't
S0084	mm
S0083	work out
S0084	yeah so they're his only experience
S0083	that's it and they've all be negative ones
S0084	mm
S0083	he's also um you know he's in this state of mind where he will think negatively about anything he have be extremely depress he have no motivation he have no self confidence and it might seem like he do because you know in a family set he can be quite
S0084	cocky
S0083	not er no i wouldn't have say that but he can be quite bullish
S0084	mm
S0083	um but that come from something else
S0084	yeah
S0083	i think
S0084	well we're probably the the only ones he be
S0083	oh yeah
S0084	comfortable around
S0083	absolutely that he can be like that with yeah definitely um when he have enjoy things it's it's be mostly because of the company rather than you know the people he's be with rather than what he's actually do
S0084	mm
S0083	and that always make a difference but he can't er obviously you can't tell before you start something if that's gonna work out you can't make that happen i mean it's it either do or it doesn't you know
S0084	yeah yeah
S0083	um
S0084	and er that's that's his not be able to imagine something you know
S0083	yeah and he find it very difficult to socialize to talk to people he can't do small talk he know he can't work in a shop
S0084	mm
S0083	or anywhere where er it's the public he just can't do that and he hat it it make him feel terrible
S0084	yeah i know
S0083	so er it's absolutely the wrong thing so the only experience he have have well apart from i mean he er as i say he enjoy work in the kitchen but he didn't like cook he just like er the banter
S0084	yeah yeah
S0083	and i think the same with the garden perhaps slightly more because it be outdoors
S0084	and it be one on one
S0083	yeah
S0084	rather than you know a big group which he do find intimidate
S0083	no i mean she be talk about things you know um there be colleges and there be course in things like horticulture and not that he's you know particularly interest but it's kind of outdoors it's
S0084	but even if he just become an odd job man
S0083	work with things
S0084	do you know what i mean like you know there's lot of people
S0083	i know
S0084	in the in the industry
S0083	mm
S0084	locally
S0083	i know
S0084	who just take on lads like my housemate like i think he's go about it the wrong way but he's just pick up with some guy and he go off with him and they do the insulation on the outside of house and he's just be knock around with him
S0083	mm
S0084	and he he sort of so that mean he's self employ and if the weather's bad he doesn't work and i've be say to him like why you know there be fund out there and there be help if you wanna get your city and guilds qualifications
S0083	mm
S0084	and that mean you'd be able to get a more reputable job
S0083	mm
S0084	on a build site and you'll have more
S0083	mm
S0084	um stability he be like yeah well i dunno if i wanna do it and you know he do complain that if he doesn't work and i think well do something about it but there be
S0083	yeah but
S0084	opportunities like that around
S0083	but if if people want to do it they will do it it's he's not sure that's what he want to do he doesn't wanna commit himself to do something long term
S0084	yeah
S0083	it probably suit him for the time be
S0084	well i mean
S0083	a lot a lot of people drift like that
S0084	yeah and he's do lot of different job
S0083	yeah
S0084	but i think you know give that he's get a criminal record as well i think it
S0083	mhm
S0084	it's better to find something that you can do
S0083	mm
S0084	that's stable in the short term and get a qualification that mean you it will be stable rather than just here and there
S0083	well i agree but some people find it very difficult to stick to anything and they just do
S0084	then er don't complain about it don't complain that you only work one day a week i think that's what i find like he's get quite a negative attitude you know my housemate
S0083	mm
S0084	which i can't really cope with hmm
S0083	mm it be difficult i mean i find i find it difficult i find it difficult suggest things to because he'll just say no
S0084	yeah
S0083	but i do know that a lot of that be because he doesn't know it's not just no it's i don't know
S0084	yeah
S0083	so we're work on it
S0084	it's yeah i know i'm tut it be hard cos i you i can't empathize in that way i can't imagine what he's go through and i know it's hard for him you know i know that he be depress and he must be pretty bad if they feel like they should medicate him
S0083	mm
S0084	give everything that he's already be through with drug and i know that it's
S0083	i think it help
S0084	easy for him to talk
S0083	i think it's helpful
S0084	to you about it because you've you've get more of an experience in that
S0083	mm
S0084	area you know dad and i can't appreciate how that feel
S0083	mm
S0084	but i suppose all you can do be really sort of be there for the person
S0083	mm
S0084	and that's what you try and do but it worry me obviously cos i you know i i know it'll worry you the think that what's gonna happen when you and dad aren't here to support him not that that's happen any time
S0083	well absolutely
S0084	in the short term but
S0083	no but er but of course it
S0084	that's the worry
S0083	it do i just assume that by that stage hopefully something will have happen for him
S0084	yeah yeah
S0083	and and i it's it's not just that you know even he be aware of time pass and want more in his life
S0084	yeah yeah
S0083	whereas he be happy at sort of nineteen to drift
S0084	cos you don't see the future yeah
S0083	at twenty six he's not
S0084	yeah
S0083	at nineteen you think nothing's important and you can just drift along for forever
S0084	mm
S0083	but he's think now that that's not good enough
S0084	mm
S0083	well good for him for for realize it
S0084	mm
S0083	but it be you know what you do mm
S0084	yeah poor rich
S0083	anyway he seem alright i mean last night he seem quite relax and this morning he be in a good mood
S0084	be he
S0083	yeah
S0084	that's good
S0083	pretty much mm
S0084	so do you leave together at the same time
S0083	yeah
S0084	oh yeah i'm annoy i should've go into dad's i just think well i'll nip round here cos i've gotta get back cos i'm cos i'm go out to see tonight um
S0083	yeah
S0084	although i don't
S0083	well that's fine i mean by the time you get back then um i mean either will say oh 's go oh never mind i'll get the bus
S0084	mm
S0083	or he'll wait there i mean i might i might give him a ring actually i'll do that
S0084	yeah give him a ring
S0083	i'll give him a ring
S0084	because they don't know that i'm here i just texted dad to say
S0083	oh right mm
S0084	be you back can i take the car because i think be here
S0083	mm
S0084	i didn't realize i didn't know
S0083	so what's it's really difficult i never know what to
S0084	what to fee him with
S0083	what to do about food for him
S0084	yeah well you can i mean um you could've give him that curry but he doesn't seem very keen on curry at the moment
S0083	no he's not he's not at all
S0084	i think that's his
S0083	i think he like curry but apparently he doesn't
S0084	well i think he use to but i er think he's get quite um a more of a sensitive stomach these days
S0083	i think he probably have as well
S0084	so er that could be why
S0083	yeah just gonna put a quick hoover um
S0084	mm if you must
S0083	table
S0084	if you must
S0083	um
S0084	where be he
S0083	er he be with and he's he go home get his bike then he be with now he's go back to dad's and they're gonna have bangers and mash and watch lord of the ring
S0084	oh
S0083	um and he's gonna come back to tomorrow here um and he's gonna stay over tomorrow night um and he's get all his appointments in road on monday so that seem to make sense
S0084	mm
S0083	that's fine i be just a bite concern where he be that's you know um but he say the football start later than he realize so anyway
S0084	hmm
S0083	oh as long as he's alright er i don't mind where he be as long as he's okay
S0084	yeah yeah absolutely well that be really move

S0083	well that be i think two thousand and seven she have that
S0084	right
S0083	be it seven or be it nine no two thousand and seven it be two thousand and nine hold on yeah cos i've be here two years now
S0084	yeah but we only move in two thousand and ten
S0083	that's right and they and it be in february they find they find the in two thousand and nine so it be two thousand and seven she have the big operation yeah
S0084	right
S0083	that be right and obviously i didn't know her then so
S0084	mm
S0083	yeah
S0084	mm horrific
S0083	but it's but he's very good at capture somebody
S0084	mm you think
S0083	he's very good at that
S0084	he's sort of paint her quite accurately yeah
S0083	well it's it's her
S0084	well i suppose he would wouldn't he because he's
S0083	i know but
S0084	know her best
S0083	but sometimes you you can't i mean i think it take a a good writer to do that even if you know somebody really well to be able to paint a picture of that person for somebody else to get it
S0084	mm mm
S0083	complete but it's her to a t
S0084	right
S0083	absolutely spot on i mean it's just uncanny and i think it be his how good he be a writer to be able to do that because i think if i try to do it i couldn't do it
S0084	mm mm yeah i think you're right
S0083	mm and i like the way he describe how they how they work together
S0084	yeah
S0083	so yeah i think it be
S0084	it be very move
S0083	er er as always you know he he can combine i think that's that's quite a gift combine make something amuse and touch at the same time
S0084	yeah
S0083	without go too far
S0084	yeah
S0083	in either direction to make it really awful
S0084	yeah
S0083	so
S0084	absolutely
S0083	i think he's he's get a very good touch like that no that's absolutely you know her character come through in that
S0084	mm
S0083	and i can always hear his voice in his write as well he's he's very he's very accurate in his write
S0084	mm
S0083	you know you know that that's what a lot of writers have a problem with be find their authorial voice
S0084	mm
S0083	she do lose it when when when i read some of her stuff i can i could i can hear her voice you know when she's write the dialogue in the murder
S0084	mm
S0083	i can hear her say what she's write and it's just so accurate she really get it sometimes and sometimes not so well
S0084	mm
S0083	sometimes she lose it
S0084	well i suppose some isn't some of their stuff still
S0083	no the the thing be i haven't read any of the stuff that he's throw out
S0084	yeah
S0083	or that she's make him throw out
S0084	yeah yeah
S0083	but the stuff that i have read that's his voice
S0084	mm
S0083	it's accurate so it i think that's why work
S0084	yeah
S0083	because it's it's completely natural
S0084	mm
S0083	he he capture his voice and his character i think er you know do amazingly i know it's obviously what he's very good at do
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0083	but you know he paint himself as well
S0084	yeah
S0083	and very accurately and sort of
S0084	he be very honest about himself
S0083	warts and all yeah
S0084	yeah he really be you know his frustrations
S0083	yeah
S0084	both er with the bureaucracy surround you know people
S0083	and with himself yeah
S0084	and with
S0083	yeah
S0084	so he be very honest about that and i think
S0083	i mean i think that's why it work
S0084	though that's why people respond to it
S0083	and and that's er absolutely but that's that be his voice it's in that be
S0084	mm
S0083	how exactly how he speak about people so yeah
S0084	and i suppose and that's what make him different to a er to other well i don't read a lot of biographies but
S0083	mm
S0084	because usually in a biography it's just the one person that you're
S0083	yeah
S0084	write about
S0083	yeah exactly
S0084	but i suppose but maybe that's to do with you know normally you'd be write a biography about a famous person or possibly
S0083	possibly
S0084	or someone well know
S0083	mm
S0084	so you might only want to tell about them
S0083	yeah
S0084	you wouldn't wanna put yourself in it you'd want it to be objective like a a historical biography
S0083	but i think no that's right but it work have the two
S0084	but it work this way yeah
S0083	yeah it do and he obviously enjoy do it
S0084	mm
S0083	which be why he's do it and want to do it again
S0084	yeah and i suppose it make it quite personal doesn't it
S0083	it do it do
S0084	yeah i do want to read about
S0083	mm
S0084	so yeah when you get that back from or be it
S0083	no 's get that 's get v
S0084	oh yeah
S0083	i must get that back as well cos somebody else want to watch it
S0084	mm
S0083	what be i look at monday that's the twelfth okay
S0084	hmm
S0083	nothing on then that's fine no it's fine
S0084	hmm mm that um house on the end flat on the end sell really quickly didn't it
S0083	within about a week
S0084	yeah
S0083	so fast that be incredible i
S0084	mm
S0083	think it's the one upstairs
S0084	oh be it
S0083	i think so cos the downstairs one be the one where they do all the work do you remember
S0084	they've do a lot of work to it yeah
S0083	yeah um so i think that's what it be but it sell really quickly
S0084	mm do you know how much it go for
S0083	no actually i be just gonna look
S0084	i didn't recognize the estate agent sign out front but you could look on rightmove
S0083	okay rightmove
S0084	and just type in your postcode
S0083	yep
S0084	what do you reckon about one eight one ninety what do you pay you pay one eight five
S0083	one no one eighty for this
S0084	one eighty and you've get a bigger garden probably although theirs be on the end they might have a big garden
S0083	yeah it's oh no no that's interest
S0084	hmm
S0083	it say grind floor
S0084	oh maybe the family want to move they've only probably be there less than you've be here
S0083	i know and it's one eight two five hundred that's ridiculous
S0084	but they spend they must've spend load of money on it they've rip the kitchen out
S0083	they've spend a lot of money on it
S0084	mm
S0083	and when i move in come round a couple of months after i'd move in and he say he think it'd go up already
S0084	really
S0083	and he say you know i'm sure he say it have go up
S0084	mm
S0083	so that's that's that's interest why be it
S0084	maybe that's the market or that's obviously why it sell so quickly cos it be quite a bargain if they've put a new kitchen in
S0083	yes exactly the garden be a hell of a state that's really not very nice at all very unkempt
S0084	oh really
S0083	yep property require some update that can't be right
S0084	maybe it's the one next to it maybe it's not that one on the corner
S0083	but the picture
S0084	can you tell from the picture outside
S0083	no this oh right this be and it's not it's another it's another one it's not the one on the corner
S0084	that's not on the corner no
S0083	no
S0084	it's m somebody begin with m
S0083	so this be another one
S0084	so
S0083	but it be okay so it's a downstairs one and they're say it need some update
S0084	so where be it can you not tell
S0083	oh no wait a minute i can see it it's number eighty eighty three
S0084	round the other side
S0083	that's round the other side okay so
S0084	can i see the photo oh right yeah
S0083	the garden be right okay i'm just read the detail require some update okay so it's probably not in its best condition and that's why
S0084	mm
S0083	um that's the only one that's come up when you do a search
S0084	oh that's interest maybe they sell no they didn't sell it privately do they
S0083	no it's definitely get a sign
S0084	cos of the estate agent's thing out the front
S0083	um
S0084	yeah
S0083	wait a minute so hold on we're fifteen so it's fifteen and seventeen that side it must be er eleven and thirteen yeah
S0084	mm
S0083	so presumably it's number eleven isn't it
S0084	mm if it be the first one or be it seven and nine cos next door would be eleven and we're fifteen and yours be fifteen and seventeen this one here would be
S0083	oh yeah there's two more that's right
S0084	there's two more
S0083	okay
S0084	so it'd be seven and nine maybe seven
S0083	so it must be seven okay yes cos that's yeah okay so
S0084	cos there's three house on the way in isn't there
S0083	that's true
S0084	one three and five
S0083	that's right
S0084	be you just google it
S0083	yeah cos it wasn't come up on
S0084	oh on rightmove
S0083	wait a minute zoopla
S0084	hmm god they're noisy
S0083	yes aren't they right okay it hmm nope that's just guess work it's not the actual thing right it um can't remember what it say on the sign
S0084	it wasn't one i recognize
S0083	no nor me it be it's yellow isn't it mustardy colour
S0084	mm
S0083	i'm gonna go and have a look
S0083	cos it's i can't find it anywhere
S0084	it's a funny time of day to be go out mm mm messy
S0083	it be isn't it
S0084	well i hope they don't wake you up when they come back oh what be the sign
S0083	well i don't hear it quite so much as will
S0084	oh the front the main bedroom's
S0083	cos it's the front door
S0084	at the front be it oh the front door
S0083	well no it's the front door
S0084	oh right yeah
S0083	cos you the they just they slam it and it's just not necessary to do that
S0084	mm some
S0083	but they do
S0084	some people be just really inconsiderate
S0083	yes they be
S0084	so what be the sign
S0084	ah
S0083	never hear of them
S0084	no
S0083	cos you if it they if they've put a sell sticker on it it won't show the price
S0084	oh right you'll have to wait until it go on zoopla cos they tell you what it
S0083	yeah
S0084	sell for
S0083	but there's a a delay isn't there
S0084	mm yeah until it's all official
S0083	mhm no that's not it oh no wait a minute ah now that's interest one nine nine
S0084	huh
S0083	nine nine five
S0084	blimey
S0083	now say he think it it be it be
S0084	mm
S0083	go up to the sort of two hundred mark
S0084	really
S0083	that's what it would you know within a year that's what it would do sort of
S0084	mm
S0083	thing
S0084	mm
S0083	so that's interest interest um
S0084	i wonder how much
S0083	they do do a lot of work to it
S0084	they do they do i think they put in a new kitchen didn't they
S0083	i think they do
S0084	mm
S0083	although they've get a rotten front door they haven't replace the front door
S0084	yeah it's strange maybe they want a house cos they've get little 'uns haven't they they've get kid
S0083	oh the kitchen's weird
S0084	be it
S0083	yeah um it's weird look
S0084	oh very strange i don't like that
S0083	that be weird isn't it
S0084	yeah i suppose it probably give them more units more unit space
S0083	dunno
S0084	urgh
S0083	but they've put these
S0084	i wouldn't spend two hundred thousand on it
S0083	floor in
S0084	mm
S0083	you know these wooden floor
S0084	mm
S0083	well it's not real wood you you know it's laminate
S0084	no no
S0083	floor
S0084	yeah mm same as yours
S0083	i think that's all fairly new actually no i don't know
S0084	i wouldn't have say
S0083	the suite doesn't look it
S0084	that toilet doesn't look very new
S0083	no it doesn't do it that's the live room don't really like it
S0084	mm where's the it look
S0083	it look actually much more cramp
S0084	it do look more cramp and there's no door to the garden unless it's by that sofa
S0083	oh no you know why that's why they've get that because
S0084	they've only get half the window they've not get french doors
S0083	oh that's strange isn't it i wonder if they be i wonder if they be all like that and when they have this put in
S0084	mm
S0083	they knock you know whether there be a door and there be like a half window you know do you remember like
S0084	mm
S0083	nanny
S0084	mm
S0083	and grandad's
S0084	mm
S0083	like that
S0084	yeah
S0083	and they actually take all of this out to put to make it all glass i don't know but next door they've get french windows
S0084	yep
S0083	that side they've get french windows
S0084	yep
S0083	i mean they're all different
S0084	yeah
S0083	but they're all full length
S0084	mm
S0083	so that's weird that it's not
S0084	yeah you wouldn't have think they'd have build them all differently they're all from the same
S0083	no
S0084	time aren't they
S0083	and that's weird as well cos that's there but they've get this thing on this wall haven't they
S0084	what thing oh yeah you say
S0083	when you walk up
S0084	you think you'd see a tv
S0083	and you can see it on that wall there you can see this big tv
S0084	well then maybe that's a maybe you'd see a projection because if that's a blank wall like yours what they might do be have a projector
S0083	mm maybe
S0084	and watch movies on that on that wall
S0083	would they do that
S0084	well i know um a friend of mine use to do that
S0083	strange
S0084	he use to get a projector and the sofa be behind and onto a blank wall
S0083	and this be very very peculiar i think they're mad okay even if they haven't get all glass er there's wall there
S0084	yeah
S0083	would you have your sofa there look at the wall
S0084	no it be
S0083	that's what they've do
S0084	yeah it
S0083	it's weird
S0084	it's very strange you'd certainly be look out of the window wouldn't you
S0083	of course you would how bizarre
S0084	so their priority be the tv not the life and nature outside
S0083	and their and their charm urgh
S0084	it's disgust isn't it
S0084	it's so tacky
S0083	people be oh dear
S0084	yeah people be weird
S0083	yeah cos when you walk up here you can see through that window there
S0084	yeah
S0083	see it's all exactly the same that's the kitchen window that's the bathroom but they've get that as extra and they've get it upstairs as well
S0084	mm
S0083	er and that's that there
S0084	yeah
S0083	so there's a window there
S0084	mm
S0083	it's weird isn't it
S0084	it's a really strange set up i dunno why they've get and
S0083	that's very odd
S0084	if if you'd have bookcase or something on that wall i could understand it because you
S0083	yeah
S0084	don't have anywhere else to put bookcases
S0083	yeah
S0084	but why would you have your sofas there just face that
S0083	no wait a minute that's why it's not all glass it's cos it's the it be the top floor then
S0084	oh right
S0083	right when i saw it be the downstairs one that's the one the other side
S0084	right
S0083	that's the eighty two or whatever it be
S0084	oh well now now we understand
S0083	so okay so now this right
S0084	now we understand why there's no door
S0083	okay so this be the upstairs one which be i think it be and it's not the downstairs where they've do all the work
S0084	right
S0083	so this be the one now this be go for two hundred and er they haven't or near enough
S0084	and they haven't get a garden
S0083	and they haven't get a garden
S0084	and it's not very nice
S0083	and it's not very nice
S0084	mm
S0083	well er i mean they've get the laminate floor people like that although i'm not mad about it but the kitchen be really odd
S0084	it's really odd but you've probably get more per inch
S0083	so that's why they've get their
S0084	you've get more square
S0083	that's why they've get okay now the kitchens upstairs be different
S0084	yeah they be
S0083	because you haven't get the that bite of corridor to the front door
S0084	mm
S0083	you haven't get that so that be all kitchen
S0084	mm it's not nice though i don't like the set up of the upstairs flats
S0083	no no i it's not as nice
S0084	and there's no garden so yours must be worth more than that
S0083	so it must be
S0084	you've get a massive garden
S0083	that must put another ten thousand on
S0084	yeah
S0083	at least
S0084	if you take five off for replace carpet and stuff but
S0083	the the downstairs one would always go for more
S0084	yeah absolutely well you've get that you've get a garden at least
S0083	yeah
S0084	and you've get the biggest garden on the block so
S0083	absolutely and it's nice as well i mean it might well it'll be even nicer when i've do all the things i wanna do but yes
S0084	yeah but already it's much nicer than it be
S0083	it be it's and it's much nicer than this
S0084	mm
S0083	that's why this look odd
S0084	yeah
S0083	cos it's actually upstairs
S0084	now we understand
S0083	right okay
S0084	so um so that's a nice to have a ballpark
S0083	and actually 's doesn't look like that oh cos the sink be there that's weird
S0084	yeah you'd think the sink would always be in the same place wouldn't you
S0083	and where's the boiler
S0084	might be in the air cupboard still might be really old
S0083	mm maybe that's odd
S0084	mm
S0083	cos 's be like you know it's it's the galley kitchen
S0084	mm
S0083	it's same as mine
S0084	mm
S0083	i can't remember if he's get a thing there or not but it's just narrow like that but it's all the way along but it's obviously longer cos he you've get all this whereas we haven't cos of the front door
S0084	yeah
S0083	but then we have get that huge cupboard under the stairs which he hasn't get cos that's the stairs
S0084	mm
S0083	so but the kitchen be a bite bigger it be just you know you could
S0084	mm
S0083	there's room for one more set of cupboards or another appliance
S0084	right
S0083	which i haven't get
S0084	okay
S0083	cos you imagine if you didn't need to get to the front door
S0084	mm mm
S0083	you've get that
S0084	yeah yeah yeah of course but i still prefer er this flat
S0083	oh i er god yeah and i'd much rather be downstairs and i'd really miss my garden so
S0084	yeah
S0083	so it's the upstairs one and it be go for nearly two hundred grand and it sell within a week
S0084	wow well there you go you see so that's encourage that let's you know
S0083	well it be encourage so if the one round the corner be only one eight two it must be in a hell of a state
S0084	yeah it must be really old because that's not particularly nice
S0083	look at that nearly two hundred grand
S0084	good grief
S0083	well that's good for me i mean i'm really please
S0084	yeah it's good to know what yours be probably gonna be worth
S0083	yeah if we go to rightmove
S0084	oh yeah because do you wanna have a look at dad's postcode because 's flat be probably on the market now
S0083	oh yeah
S0084	cos they've just put it up
S0083	that's interest
S0084	his postcode be
S0083	hold on
S0084	oh
S0083	i be gonna show you this one
S0084	do it have any photos of the inside
S0083	so here's the downstairs no it doesn't
S0084	oh that's interest
S0083	and i think that's dodgy
S0084	because it's really ugly
S0083	but look the garden be i mean it's big but it's really
S0084	it's big well there's not you'd have to put stuff in wouldn't you
S0083	it's actually
S0084	unless you have a family
S0083	it's actually not that big it's nowhere near as big as mine and it's really in a bad state
S0084	mm
S0083	really in a bad way
S0084	but er you know first time buyers might think that that's really nice grind floor get you know you it's a blank canvas
S0083	it's very it's a good investment
S0084	mm
S0083	it be a good you could go if you it hasn't sell so if you if you could get them down to one eighty now
S0084	if then if you could get a ten percent mortgage that's doable isn't it
S0083	and people and people would but people would buy it and go in and do it up
S0084	yeah yeah cos if you cos that's twenty grand isn't it
S0083	yeah
S0084	correct me if i'm wrong
S0083	yeah
S0084	ten percent mortgage which be doable if er if it's a couple buy it cos
S0083	mm
S0084	then you just need ten just you've gotta have ten thousand
S0083	yeah
S0084	and then you've probably gotta have five each
S0083	mm
S0084	to do it up
S0083	but that's interest isn't it
S0084	but it'd be worth twenty five grand more when you've do it
S0083	oh yeah always but yes when when it's i mean unless they it hmm if it's get a lot to do they have to really reduce the price
S0084	mm mm
S0083	to get somebody to buy it
S0084	mm
S0083	it depend if you think you know if you think you can do it and not without spend too much
S0084	mm mm
S0083	then you're still gonna make some profit on it
S0084	you've get a margin yeah
S0083	yeah it depend how big that margin be
S0084	mm
S0083	right so what's dad's
S0084	one x w
S0083	yep that'll be it won't it
S0084	be it
S0083	it be
S0084	yeah there's dad's front door so 's be the top
S0083	so what be they say for it
S0084	hers be this one
S0083	one eight nine five
S0084	ah now what do dad dad's be on the the same and he knock them down because er it be so old
S0083	how's she's live in it for a long time
S0084	yeah
S0083	so it will need well no it's it look alright
S0084	but it but it have er it's still get the ceiling heat
S0083	yeah
S0084	i think
S0083	i think that's the reason that they come down because of that
S0084	mm
S0083	because the room itself look fine it look
S0084	it's fine
S0083	look much nicer it's all um
S0084	it's all bare
S0083	cream
S0084	you know it's all yeah it's not floral well apart from that it's very yellow as well that room and it's get this er
S0083	funny they're the same units aren't they
S0084	yeah
S0083	they're obviously the original ones
S0084	and but this be the old tiny half wash machine thing
S0083	oh
S0084	so you'd have to get rid of that
S0083	yeah
S0084	er they're big though you know that master bedroom
S0083	they be
S0084	be really big and even cos obviously that's the build in
S0083	yeah
S0084	cupboard but yeah
S0083	that's not bad at all be it
S0084	but you'd have to knock them down on the heat which be what dad do
S0083	yeah
S0084	so i dunno i'll be interest to see if it go for that
S0083	mm
S0084	give the state of the market
S0083	well they've only just put it on haven't they so
S0084	it be last end of last week
S0083	mm oh interest
S0084	so we'll see cos so yeah i think his be on for one ninety and he get he knock them down five thousand because that's how much he well he ask to knock it down by ten and they say no
S0083	mm
S0084	so he say knock it down by five they do and obviously i don't know how much his central heat cost but probably about that
S0083	well that's fine so he's he's you know
S0084	so well er exactly at least he didn't he didn't pay the market price
S0083	no that's the thing hmm
S0084	yeah it's just i mean er this be just
S0083	well it's nice to know that this be worth that though i'm please about that
S0084	yeah oh it must be easily and by the time you know you don't know how long you want to be here or how long you're go to
S0083	no
S0084	be here you know
S0083	exactly
S0084	you dunno what i mean you dunno what you will have do to it in that time so
S0083	no but you it's it's reassure to know that it's either keep its price or increase its
S0084	yeah
S0083	value
S0084	yeah
S0083	um that's
S0084	absolutely
S0083	that's quite a um an important point
S0084	well i guess unless you're ruin it which you're obviously not do um somewhere like be always gonna be appreciate in value isn't it
S0083	absolutely no i er absolutely i i would never worry about buy somewhere here
S0084	mm it's just so demoralize when you think
S0083	unless it be in arbury or somewhere
S0084	well yeah which they might bulldoze at some point you never know um
S0083	there's too many people live there
S0084	just try to get on the property ladder just seem impossible
S0083	it do i mean i feel sorry for you i i just
S0084	but there be still part buy scheme
S0083	there be
S0084	you know that you can that you can get in on and you only have to have
S0083	the there absolutely be
S0084	half the deposit and
S0083	and you can i mean er you know live somewhere er where it's not quite so expensive and you know
S0084	yeah i mean be a good place to start but
S0083	i mean you be careful about where you you know you you choose to live somewhere
S0084	you you get a lot more for your money in place like although they be become more expensive because people be realize
S0083	yeah
S0084	i mean half the live in now it's hilarious
S0083	do they
S0084	they all live in
S0084	you know you walk down the street and you just see everyone from work
S0084	but but there's a reason for that i mean it's on the train line
S0083	yeah
S0084	it's only fifteen minutes it's it's quicker to get there by train than it be to drive which be quite rare the house price be cheap it's not it's not an
S0083	no
S0084	it's not an ugly town
S0083	no and you're near the station so it's not like you're you know out at the science park or anything
S0084	yeah
S0083	so that's not so bad
S0084	it's just um even to buy somewhere like that
S0083	yeah
S0084	and even if it be a part buy you'd still need five or six thousand
S0083	yeah
S0084	which actually now be be completely unfeasible but this year i will get out of my overdraft
S0083	mm
S0084	like at the begin of the year i think god how be i gonna do this and i be really worry but actually i have be careful i have say no to all of the hen party
S0083	mm
S0084	i have be do this record as a way of
S0083	yeah
S0084	clear my debts
S0083	mm
S0084	and it's make me feel more confident about
S0083	good
S0084	have probably from about april onwards when i get the second payment for this um second of two there'll only be until cos it finish in april
S0083	oh right
S0084	um it's only until the end of the financial year they just have some money to burn um that should clear my overdraft and at that point i start
S0083	oh good
S0084	from zero
S0083	okay
S0084	so every month i can be put like
S0083	you can put some
S0084	hundred and fifty a away into a save account and it's little
S0083	i think that's a good idea
S0084	little little catchy monkey
S0083	yeah
S0084	but at least that mean that there's a safety net there which i don't have at the moment
S0083	no that's all a good thing
S0084	so
S0083	absolutely
S0084	depend on you know what i wanna do whether i do wanna try and work abroad for a little while and
S0083	yeah exactly
S0084	at least it mean that i feel like
S0083	you have
S0084	there be opportunities and there's
S0083	yes exactly
S0084	a chance to do something so
S0083	exactly
S0084	i don't know i
S0083	i mean you don't have to tie yourself down you don't have to buy
S0084	well no i mean er that's the thing i think it's just the idea of throw money away if you don't
S0083	yes but
S0084	i'd like a little house
S0083	but a mortgage
S0084	i'd like somewhere that i can make my own
S0083	be like
S0084	i know but it
S0083	especially the size that they be i mean oh god
S0084	but the thing be
S0083	i can't imagine
S0084	you you just rent the i mean i know that some of them don't let you rent them out in the first five years or whatever it be but if you be to buy a house
S0083	do they
S0084	at least then yeah there be some scheme and
S0083	mm
S0084	in the to in the part buy you can't rent it out you can't sublet that's the difficulty
S0083	right okay if you're do it that way round
S0084	so maybe you could do it to a mate or something yeah
S0083	right okay
S0084	um but typically if you be get a mortgage on your own and you you decide to take a job abroad
S0083	mm
S0084	you would just rent your flat out
S0083	yeah
S0084	or your house
S0083	absolutely
S0084	and then that's not a weight it's just something that's appreciate in value
S0083	that's true
S0084	back home
S0083	yeah
S0084	and you're off work somewhere else and someone's pay your mortgage
S0083	that's very true that be true
S0084	so it just mean that you do have that security
S0083	yeah
S0084	but it
S0083	that's true
S0084	but really it's a massive massive problem
S0083	it's a huge thing
S0084	start a massive commitment and you're penalize for do it on your own
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know if i be go in with a friend or boyfriend
S0083	mm
S0084	you you know
S0083	mm i know
S0084	you're you're in a better position
S0083	well you you know that that's you know at some point that will happen
S0084	well who know but um you can't let it worry you
S0083	no
S0084	but also at the same time this year i'm thirty
S0083	mm
S0084	i don't wanna live in a house share like i don't wanna sound like a petulant child but
S0083	no i know i know what you mean
S0084	i wanna place to make my own
S0083	i know i know
S0084	so it's hard
S0083	mm
S0084	i don't know what the best thing to do be but at least i can feel a bite more confident know that if i be put money aside
S0083	mm
S0084	at least then i can start think about what it be i want
S0083	yeah
S0084	to do i mean even though i don't know what that be
S0083	you'd think you could huh you'd think it would be possible to buy a little flat somewhere without kill yourself wouldn't you but
S0084	it's just impossible
S0083	it's it's oh it's unbelievable
S0084	yeah
S0083	oh dear
S0084	yep it's just impossible so you can't even i mean if you could borrow money to pay a deposit to get a mortgage
S0083	mm
S0084	at least then you have money it's have the money up front
S0083	it be because that that wasn't a problem for a long time but it will be now
S0084	mm it's a massive issue now
S0083	from now on
S0084	cos obviously bank be worry about lend to people
S0083	yeah
S0084	quite rightly you know they be very irresponsible in lend
S0083	but they be
S0084	money to people who couldn't repay and then
S0083	well yeah but it's their fault
S0084	kick them out on the street but it's their i agree but you er they do have to be careful
S0083	and it mean people like you who you know
S0084	i'm a sensible person
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know and it's it's now nigh on impossible if you don't have any money behind you
S0083	yeah i know
S0084	and you haven't be save since you be sixteen
S0083	mm
S0084	just think the people that i know that own house well their parent give them money or they inherit money from
S0083	i know
S0084	somewhere or you know
S0083	well that's true dido do
S0084	that's and that's live in an affluent place
S0083	she inherit money she's the last person in the line
S0084	mm
S0083	um that's that's exactly what happen with her
S0084	i mean
S0083	well it's nice to have family to leave it to you but
S0084	yeah
S0083	you know
S0084	well you know
S0083	yeah
S0084	i'll just have to wait and see what happen really i mean er the good thing be i like my job
S0083	no i wouldn't worry about it i mean i think rent be fine i mean er er the problem there be again
S0084	i can't afford to rent a place on my own
S0083	but rent but rent be so high
S0084	if it be if it be i could rent a place on my own
S0083	mm
S0084	and then at least i could see how i be fare then it would be okay
S0083	mm
S0084	but then at least i'd have a little place where i could have all my stuff out
S0083	i know
S0084	and you'd feel like it be a little home even if it be just you know with er she's she's just rent
S0083	mm
S0084	but at least it's her house
S0083	yeah
S0084	and it's for her and i can't afford to do that even i mean i'm keep my eye peel and at least now i think
S0083	mm
S0084	i can get out of my overdraft and i can put money aside it's better to be do that
S0083	mm
S0084	i at the moment and maybe in a few months i'll pay i could pay a little bite more on rent and have a nicer place
S0083	i think look at it like that yeah
S0084	but we'll have to see
S0083	yeah yeah we'll see
S0084	because just save even if it be two hundred pound a month once i clear out of my overdraft and i'm put money aside
S0083	well that will add up
S0084	to save six grand
S0083	yeah
S0084	that's gonna take you years
S0083	i know but but it will you know it will happen and it'll be you know huh yeah i know
S0084	never mind you can't moan you just have to you know i er i think
S0083	it's just it's difficult and this be a very expensive place to live i mean
S0084	yeah and that's the thing as well be i don't know if i you know necessarily this be the place that i want to be but
S0083	mm
S0084	all my family be here but that's neither here nor there really i could i could move away
S0083	you of course you could
S0084	i've get friends everywhere so that's not a stick point
S0083	yeah i mean you're
S0084	it doesn't matter where they be we keep in touch
S0083	you're free to to to live where you want to
S0084	the but the job be good and i think you know
S0083	yeah
S0084	i don't wanna move just yet because i've only just start this job and it's
S0083	yeah
S0084	it look bad to move within the year and actually i've it's a good place to sort of hone my skills
S0083	no it's a
S0084	so
S0083	exactly no i think i think you you need to be there
S0084	i think by the you know come september
S0083	for a bite
S0084	i'll start look at other job
S0083	yeah
S0084	and look abroad probably because at least then i i'll have the
S0083	well i think
S0084	option to
S0083	i certainly think yeah
S0084	travel and work
S0083	exactly so if you think about travel and work next year
S0084	yeah
S0083	and and use this year to consolidate your job
S0084	mm
S0083	as it be yeah
S0084	and save fund and
S0083	exactly
S0084	we'll just have to wait and see
S0083	so you've get a new job that you're enjoy
S0084	yep
S0083	um
S0084	clear my debt
S0083	clear your debt you're you're look to next year do something different maybe
S0084	yep
S0083	you're able to save a little bite of money possibly
S0084	mm
S0083	if something nicer come along go for it
S0084	yeah
S0083	you know to live absolutely um
S0084	and that's all you can do really
S0083	huh see exactly
S0084	i think it's just maybe it's just because it's this year you know i think
S0083	mm
S0084	er a at the begin of the year you always look ahead don't you
S0083	yeah
S0084	you always look ahead and think well this um you look behind you and think well look what happen last year
S0083	yeah
S0084	what could happen this year
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know you wanna you wanna always be think that something good be gonna happen and you know also you think i'm thirty i'm single i don't have a house i'm in debt
S0083	well don't look at it like that oh for god's sake
S0084	well you can't help yourself but then obviously you
S0083	no you must
S0084	but you you do snap out of it obviously but er you know er every so often you do you do think oh it's such hard work sometimes be on your own it's it's easy when you're with somebody else you know you sort of share your problems with or whatever but it's not a problem i've you know i'm i'm not resign i'm i'm happy but at the same time
S0083	i think it i think
S0084	it'd be nice to meet somebody
S0083	well well of course it would and i know that's that's i you know of course it would be lovely to have somebody um but you're also you're independent you're free

S0083	and you be you be
S0084	in the grand scheme of things it i could be a lot worse off
S0083	mm

S0083	you what be you like
