S0324	cos it sound really cool and to be able to say oh i play the ukulele and just bust it out like
S0325	little tiny i'm really
S0324	because it's small it's easier to carry around
S0325	yeah
S0324	and it sound so much cooler
S0325	well it doesn't i really like the guitar
S0324	okay
S0325	but i don't think a guitar suit me too much though like
S0324	yeah well now that you've start play the ukulele i can't imagine you with a full size
S0324	guitar and it's like me i can't imagine myself play ukulele feel
S0324	it feel really weird because it's so much smaller than a guitar cos i'm use to a guitar and like
S0325	yeah
S0324	rest it on my knee but you can't do that with a ukulele
S0325	i really want
S0324	it's really weird
S0325	to save up and get a 's ukulele
S0324	i really want
S0325	i want
S0324	to save up and get a banjo
S0325	i want
S0324	i really want a banjo
S0325	i want to get a guitar and i want to get a like a concert size ukulele
S0324	mm
S0325	because they're sort of
S0324	they're slightly
S0325	they're bigger
S0324	bigger yeah
S0325	cos my one be tiny i can hold it in the palm of my hand
S0325	but they're like mini guitars and i like them they're really cool and 's one be an electric acoustic but i don't know where i'm gonna find two
S0324	i want
S0325	for thirty nine pound from
S0324	i want an electro acoustic guitar
S0325	i'd love to learn the guitar just to like an acoustic guitar but i don't feel like you know i don't know if i'll be very good at it i try play 's but i just
S0324	yeah well 's
S0325	it be horrible
S0324	be terrible
S0325	it be
S0324	so don't like
S0325	like
S0324	just base it
S0325	oh i forget to give it back to her
S0325	i say i be gonna give it back to her on today
S0324	well you be gonna bring it to school
S0325	er well no i be gonna drop it off at her house
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	so i'd go to her house
S0324	of course
S0325	but erm
S0324	give to her tomorrow when you go round to hers or do she come round yours
S0325	oh yeah i'm go round hers oh she should have come round mine cos then i could give give her my guitar
S0324	well you can go round to hers and you can get insurgent back from her
S0325	oh yeah
S0324	have she give it back to you
S0325	no no
S0324	i can't believe
S0325	if she's crack that spine
S0324	she's so and she hasn't finish the book yet
S0325	no she hasn't
S0324	i'm sure she hasn't
S0325	she be like i've nearly finish insurgent i be like oh really
S0324	really
S0324	when you mean nearly do you mean you've read one page
S0325	i just like cos it
S0324	cos it take her how like
S0325	it i give her
S0324	it take her years
S0325	diversion
S0324	to read diversion
S0325	in like november or something and she give it back to me like last month
S0325	but she's try because she think she's so good at english she's try to be like a reader but i don't see any part of her that that's that interest in english she doesn't like read she never read book
S0324	she just want to be a journalist
S0325	i know and because she think she's so good like
S0324	yeah
S0325	but then i guess that's what you do if you if you're good at something then you're like that's what that's what i wanna be
S0324	well
S0325	because english be the only thing well i'm better at english than i be at maths or science or anything else
S0324	well i don't really wanna be a mathematician or something
S0324	like
S0325	yeah but i think you'd be a really good mathematician i feel like you'd be a really sassy
S0324	i don't i don't like
S0325	maths teacher
S0324	maybe actually i wouldn't mind
S0325	with a bob
S0324	be a maths teacher
S0325	with a bob and like smart glass
S0324	because i do like quite i do quite like teach even though i can't teach because i really don't know how to explain anything to anyone
S0324	but
S0325	i'd be a rubbish teacher i'd be awful
S0324	but i don't like mathematics like mathematicians always try and find reason why things happen
S0325	yeah
S0324	and it's
S0325	you just like
S0324	like you just
S0325	solve the problems
S0324	er the problem that's all you need you don't need a reason why this problem solve this way or whatever
S0325	but i'm i
S0324	or something like that
S0325	i'm not sure i'd want to be like an academic because i can just picture myself in a university room just scribble away
S0324	yeah
S0325	like like a total recluse just like
S0324	yeah that's
S0325	i i've get to pass my exam
S0324	mm
S0325	i've get pass my exam
S0324	yeah
S0325	but i you know teach be cool but i don't think i'd be able to deal with children be sick
S0324	yeah
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	like well
S0324	well like just naughty naughty children
S0325	children yeah
S0324	i'll either be well teachers be be either really good at do that
S0325	yeah
S0324	or really bad
S0325	yeah like mrs
S0324	yeah she's
S0325	she's
S0324	really bad
S0325	i know
S0324	i mean she sort of deal she kind of deal with them better than you think she do
S0325	yeah
S0324	but still
S0325	but she still like favouritises them
S0324	yeah i know
S0325	that's why they behave a little bite for her
S0324	how can you favouritise them it's yeah
S0325	i don't understand why teachers give them so many second chance chance though like
S0324	yeah i'd just
S0325	cos it
S0324	like
S0325	be like get out of my classroom
S0324	yeah exactly or i think the tactic you have to do be like embarrass them or something
S0325	yeah
S0324	or maybe
S0325	like mr when be have his hand under the table
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	and he be like i don't know what you're fiddle with under there but
S0324	it's give the wrong impression
S0324	or something
S0325	but also all i'd want be
S0324	or like do you remember when mr do that erm lesson about be dylan and outlier
S0325	yeah
S0324	and we have to work out if he be really bad
S0325	yeah i felt a little bite sorry for though because when he get move down
S0324	yeah be so much worse that
S0325	i know
S0324	at maths
S0325	why be
S0324	but somehow 's in top set and be i think it's because mr do actually favouritise
S0325	yeah because he
S0324	there be
S0325	really like
S0324	yeah he do
S0325	and i remember be like oh i'm not on there i guess i've get move down and mr be like well i guess you do
S0324	yeah i know if that be
S0325	yeah
S0324	he'd be like oh sorry i didn't that one or like
S0324	or like not mention it
S0325	yeah
S0324	like he didn't mention that she move down but ask
S0325	yeah
S0324	to get move down
S0325	yeah
S0324	but still he didn't mention her
S0325	i don't know why ask to be move down
S0324	but he won't
S0325	cos she's always go on about how maths be her strong point and stuff
S0324	yeah and she
S0325	and when she do well in that test like
S0324	i don't think she be actually that bad at maths
S0325	no well i see what she mean but
S0324	she's in like the bottom
S0325	yeah
S0324	half of the maths group
S0325	yeah
S0324	but she's still
S0325	i dunno i kind of i like maths when i can do it because it's sort of it's it's a nice feel when you get a question right
S0325	but
S0324	yeah
S0325	and normally i just don't get it
S0324	yeah with english you can't do that
S0325	yeah
S0324	but with english there's no like i think that's why i don't like english really erm
S0325	yeah cos you're very
S0324	erm cos i like
S0325	all a very logical person aren't you
S0324	have like an answer
S0325	yeah a right or wrong
S0324	know if it's right or wrong not things like how can i improve on this sentence
S0324	or something
S0325	but also er
S0324	and it's really hard to know like where you're go wrong like when we be write our assessments
S0325	mm
S0324	i didn't know i dunno i didn't know how to like make it better i dunno i'm gonna fail with that one
S0325	but the no the thing be the reason that i don't i'm not too sure about english be because i've never be like that particularly good at english in the past i've just be alright in the top set you know sort of bob along but then now
S0324	and now you're suddenly amaze
S0325	yeah so i'm just a bite worry that miss because obviously the teachers be mark it so it's sort of their opinion like if they like your write style
S0324	yeah every teacher be gonna mark you
S0325	yeah
S0324	differently
S0325	so if they like your write style they give you a high mark and if they don't like it they give you a low mark so it's sort of like
S0324	yeah well before we have miss and she didn't like you
S0325	no she didn't like me at all
S0324	well actually she hat me
S0325	oh
S0324	and she like call me a pain or whatever
S0324	mm
S0325	but she really she really didn't like me at all she love
S0324	oh
S0325	i sit next to she love her i remember one time she go to when have a horrible like
S0324	oh yeah and she be like
S0325	when she have
S0324	how do you get your hair
S0325	how do you do your hair and be like erm i just sort of like like just sort of backcomb
S0324	do it
S0325	it a bite and miss say
S0324	and it's like do you use talcum powder
S0325	yeah
S0324	or or whatever she say it be
S0325	well 's hair use to be white
S0324	yeah i know
S0324	so obviously i think mrs be be sarcastic
S0325	yes so do i
S0324	so it's really hard to tell if she be like sarcastic or not
S0325	mm
S0324	she's really weird like
S0325	well
S0324	sense of humour
S0325	yeah i remember and mrs love i don't think do you remember in year seven she
S0324	oh yeah and she
S0325	and get a blue as well for a
S0324	mrs love you especially after she find that if
S0324	you be do a
S0325	oh god

S0325	no
S0324	er gcse in japanese she be like and 's do a whole gcse
S0324	in a different language
S0325	obviously
S0324	so just think what she's go through
S0325	and i remember
S0324	or whatever and
S0325	at one time well she didn't like me that much and she be really into
S0324	and she be like why don't you tell us about your gcse and then you be
S0324	so
S0325	bite awkward i shouldn't have tell her cos one time what be it oh yeah we'd have an assessment
S0324	yeah cos you be like oh i i'm not here for the assessment and she be like oh why be not here and it be like oh i'm do a gcse in japanese and she be like

S0325	and then that be the day when we be plan the assessment she come over
S0324	mm
S0325	and talk to me for forty five minutes
S0324	yeah and then she get grumpy at you at the end
S0325	she get angry at me cos i hadn't write anything i'd write like a paragraph and everyone else have write a page she be like you haven't write very much i be like well you now and miss as well you weren't in
S0324	yeah

S0325	oh i dunno they're so annoy they be really annoy
S0324	they think they're rebel and whatever
S0325	they do like i think well i remember in year eight when we start do language futures and you be the do you get a you probably get a blue for language futures didn't you for spanish i'm sure you do
S0324	i think i do yeah
S0325	yeah because you be the only one that actually try like i felt a i felt really bad for you cos you be try so hard

S0325	egg
S0324	with like
S0325	and it be like burn bits
S0324	black
S0325	and then and drop hers down the sink
S0324	yeah she be like shake it and it come out
S0324	oh
S0325	i send a picture to i remember i send a picture to her i be like do you like my omelette
S0325	it literally just look like sick in a tub
S0324	oh
S0325	i didn't actually eat any of that i just throw it in the that waste a whole six egg i go out and buy six
S0324	yeah you have six
S0325	egg
S0324	egg or something yeah
S0325	each six egg each so we have a twelve egg
S0324	oh
S0325	and then just divide the gloop in half
S0324	you should have halve it by three three
S0325	well we think it be gonna go really well
S0324	yeah yeah
S0325	load of omelettes oh erm
S0324	mm
S0325	but then you make your really cool paella you be like go oh
S0325	i don't know why you didn't take food tech actually cos you be
S0324	mm
S0325	really good at food tech
S0324	yeah because i like cook
S0325	just not at school
S0324	i don't like food tech
S0325	the yeah
S0324	i mean
S0325	i can't deal with the sink
S0324	i kind i like cook at school because i think it give you an opportunity to actually cook and try
S0325	to show off all your skills
S0324	new recipes and stuff like cos otherwise i don't i don't cook that much
S0325	no cos i i mean i have to like arrange it and then write down
S0324	yeah
S0325	the ingredients on a shop list
S0324	yeah exactly and decide
S0325	it's a bite er
S0324	what to cook
S0325	yeah so much effort
S0324	and then it have to be like particular to like a dinner or
S0325	yeah yeah
S0324	a pudding or something it can't just be like a random cheesecake on
S0325	yeah
S0324	on a week that we're not gonna eat it or whatever erm and it's and like it's things like i don't know if you're gonna make like muffins or something like you know when they be make those cool cupcakes i would never do that here
S0325	mm
S0324	because i would never like experiment with fancy caramel
S0325	yeah
S0324	cupcakes or whatever but there you can cos you can like find a cool recipe and it give you an excuse to do it but i hate how you only get an hour
S0325	yeah
S0324	because you can never really do anything in an
S0325	mm
S0324	hour and also you then have to do five million lessons on write in a booklet about
S0325	yeah god
S0324	safety information when you're cook a cupcake like don't put your hand in the oven
S0325	oven
S0324	because it will burn
S0325	i always remember
S0324	things like like that just gonna get a sponge
S0325	it be so bad
S0324	just get a sponge
S0325	because i always leave everything to the last minute the night before i be cook something i'd be like oh wait
S0324	oh yeah same yeah
S0325	i'm cook erm i'm cook something tomorrow
S0324	but it's it's really hard to
S0325	to remember
S0324	remember i know and then oh the worst time definitely be when we be make stuff pepper and i literally turn up to school
S0325	i make stuff potatoes
S0325	i
S0324	i get chef of the lesson
S0325	do you
S0324	for the stuff potatoes
S0325	i never get chef of the lesson that's why i didn't take food tech she hat me well it's not cos i just hat food tech but i like i literally turn up for school with two pepper and a can of tuna
S0324	oh well er
S0325	it be literally it
S0324	i
S0325	and so i open
S0324	well i do like
S0325	the can of tuna
S0324	roast potatoes and then i sneak it out
S0325	no i didn't even
S0324	and put bacon and stuff in
S0325	the pepper i just cut open the pepper
S0325	spoon in the tuna put on the lids i'm do
S0325	and so it just it literally take me
S0324	yeah but
S0325	two minutes and so i just have to stand around and help for the rest of the lesson and it be oh my god it be such a fail and i just take home these pepper with tuna inside
S0325	oh i just i couldn't do it and be really when we make cheesecake erm he he miss be like right do not bring philadelphia light never bring
S0324	oh
S0325	the diet cream cheese it will not work

S0324	i'm not sure if i can use this straw any more
S0325	he just carry on and then it fail and he be like why be it why be so gloopy

S0324	like with homework unless it's like a subject like re
S0325	yeah

S0325	yeah i
S0324	especially if it's like a subject you're gonna take at gcse

S0325	yeah
S0324	if it's like an easy one
S0325	mm
S0324	or well like maths that sound really but there you only get like five question
S0325	yeah
S0324	and that's all you have to do
S0325	and that's question that i can never do
S0324	that's the sort of homework that i like things that be just question
S0325	mm
S0324	cos then you still learn it but you don't have to write millions of page or whatever
S0325	yeah it's like
S0324	like tech homework like
S0325	oh yeah
S0324	dt er don't have dt any more product design

S0324	they're always like research metal and then you have to write a whole page about different type of metal
S0325	yeah
S0324	or whatever
S0325	well mr think i be really good at product design just because everyone else in my class be just incompetent like in my class there's two s erm like who else i don't even know like all the cool people
S0324	uhu
S0325	and nobody else try and i'm just always there like get mine do really quickly so they think i be really good at product design and it turn out i'm not at all and someone
S0324	and it's just everyone else be really
S0325	yeah when we have to
S0324	well actually you be good at product design
S0325	no like when we go to the
S0324	you get choose for that competition
S0325	yeah i know exactly when we go there i i didn't do any of the the design for the actual thing and be just like right okay so we make it balance on this side we can put the motor here we put the load here and and as i be join in with them i just do the whole portfolio
S0325	i be decorate it i be colour
S0324	well there you go you need someone for the portfolio to
S0325	yeah i should become like a design worker
S0324	yeah
S0325	but not but not actually design an actual product
S0324	a decorator
S0325	just decorate
S0324	like you can be the erm what's it call it's like well i'm not sure if it be an actual thing but like the the aesthetic no what's
S0325	the aesthetically please
S0324	yeah but erm what's the person which you like ask for advice and they help you make it more like you can be that person that help people make design
S0325	yeah
S0324	look nicer
S0324	and they can come to you like i have this great machine but it look ugly on the outside
S0325	yeah cos
S0324	you'd be like right what you need
S0325	right strip on this side
S0325	spot here
S0324	yeah nice shiny lacquer or whatever
S0325	like i and then but we do win the portfolio award
S0325	and then be like i do load of portfolio i be like no sorry i basically
S0325	do the whole portfolio but the machine that we do didn't even work that well to be honest it be because we be play with it load like turn the battery on and off so it be spin round so one of the things come loose so when we put it on the string it just keep fall off
S0324	oh no
S0325	but luckily we realise on the fourth attempt we be mean to have three attempt but they pretend they didn't notice the first one because we literally just put it on start it and it fell straight off before it even move so like on the fourth attempt we be like oh no it's loose so we screw it back on and it go across basically
S0324	well do
S0325	the teachers be so cool it go forward and backwards because they like rewire the motor
S0324	that be
S0325	and it have two people on it and it be it be so cool
S0324	do they that before or after
S0325	after and i get to work it because i be stand at the front and they be like do you wanna do it i be like oh okay er and like you have to like twist twist them and it go forward and backwards
S0324	oh
S0325	it be so cool
S0324	cool
