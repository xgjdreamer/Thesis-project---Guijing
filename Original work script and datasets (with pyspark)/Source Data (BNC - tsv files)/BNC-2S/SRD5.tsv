S0282	oh yeah no if you when you know what she's talk about
S0293	yeah
S0282	then er you think oh really
S0293	mm
S0282	crikey
S0293	mm
S0282	erm if you didn't know what she be talk about she it be so elliptical a reference
S0293	yeah
S0282	that erm you wouldn't really've understand
S0293	well she she's very conscientious about these things as you've gather
S0282	yeah
S0293	she will go to her grave with all kinds of secrets i go to the physio the other day and that be jolly useful
S0282	you go to where
S0293	i go to i go er to the physio the other day and that be jolly useful
S0282	oh what persuade you to do that
S0293	well i'd be well i'd be refer to this bloke before
S0282	mm
S0293	and er i didn't get on very well with my last physio cos he keep and erm er he always hold it
S0282	oh right yes
S0293	and erm and so er and in the end anyway i i didn't end up go to two appointments and er be obviously blacklist they be furious with me absolutely furious
S0282	be this a referral do you have you be refer by the
S0293	i'd be refer and then i be refer back a second time yeah i be refer for my back which be the reason well i the reason i want to go the er reason i ask for the referral be because i be so bloody stiff all the time i can't move and erm i really can't move any more erm i i i can't put my clothe on and things like that i've be be tell you haven't i for some time how stiff i be and erm i ask them to erm i'll do that afterwards if i start even think about it i will not stop talk and erm er
S0282	mm mm so you so you go to the physio
S0293	can't bear it i hate it
S0282	just pretend that nothing's go on
S0293	but i can't when you're put your little pen down it's horrid
S0282	sorry
S0293	anyway erm
S0282	i don't have to do that
S0293	erm yeah so i'd already be refer for my back and er then i end up do this stuff which drive me mad and erm then i get refer again and i miss two appointments so she be absolutely hop mad with me so i go in there and i think oh my god she's gonna be she do give me such a hard time and erm actually i say look i'll be perfectly frank what i want be i want a set of exercise cos i be so stiff i don't know what to do with myself and i've get knee pain and back pain and actually she be really very switch on erm and she say yes i be extraordinarily erm stiff
S0282	mm
S0293	i've be you know i keep say this to everybody but nobody believe me you know i have i have a very flat back which be an indicator of how stiff i be and i can't rotate in any
S0282	mm
S0282	in any dimension
S0293	in any way no i can't and i keep say this to people and i know you know it's not a a major thing but it it make life quite hard work and also things like i fall off my bike i fall over i i er cos i can't bend to get out of situations
S0282	yeah
S0293	i'm all so it's actually quite
S0282	but also if you're if you're tense
S0282	then you can't fall properly and you can't correct yourself because you need a certain amount of fluidity and relaxation
S0293	yeah yeah so my daily life be more dangerous as a consequence everything be more dangerous about it so
S0282	yeah yeah
S0293	erm anyway she agree with me that yes it be a level of stiffness that be really quite acute so i i felt quite kind of you know sometimes they look at you as if you're mad you're say you're stiff you know oh why be you come why be complain about this i say you know i just need some exercise i need to know what to do but i have to be very careful cos otherwise i set my back off and if i start do things that set my back off then i just don't don't do the exercise so erm and then she say with the knee which be even more useful she say the reason i'm er she she reckon with the correct exercise plan i may actually be able to stop the knee pain because what's happen be my knee cap have move outwards
S0282	mm
S0293	i guess cos of the back and erm i'm very strong on the outside
S0282	mm
S0293	but on the inside and therefore they're not be support correctly
S0282	right
S0293	so if we can build up muscle here
S0282	yeah
S0293	actually we could probably physically rectify the stress which be oh i've get arthritis but not very bad arthritis
S0282	no
S0293	so i can probably improve the situation a lot myself
S0282	yeah
S0293	which be what i wanna do you know
S0282	yeah
S0293	i'm not say miraculously cure me i'm say you know there must be a way of improve life cos again with the knee it's it's incredibly impractical you know you can't get i can't get up and down i can't get out the bath i can't get into my cupboards erm
S0282	i've end up on in a supermarket go to get something off the bottom shelf and think i can't get up now
S0282	and have to put a hand on the floor or on the shelf and
S0293	i can't get up i've fall over
S0282	pull myself up
S0293	erm in the street and not be able to get up you know it's really really embarrass
S0282	mm
S0293	erm and i've be in situations with big step when i actually just can't get out of the situation i'm think oh shit what do i do now
S0282	mm could be your feet as well
S0293	no no i've be that alley
S0282	have you
S0293	mm
S0282	cos i mean that my er the pronation of my knees come out as a consequence of me go to see the podiatrist about pain in my feet and they they they have this little er studio where they make you walk on a treadmill they attach electrodes to your bum and they film you erm at the same time so they could see so they could see what your feet be do your knees your thighs your bum and so i be all one side so one buttock higher than the other my knees be point outwards my toe be point inwards
S0293	yeah but i don't know about you but didn't they just give you thick insoles which you can't get in any shoe you see that's what they do with me
S0282	ah they give me a thick pair of insoles which i can er wear in one pair of shoe and when i have pain in my feet i wear those shoe and if i'm walk a lot or
S0293	oh you see i do have pain i do have pain but a very high arch it's which be the problem
S0282	oh i have the opposite i have really low arch
S0293	mm mine be exceptionally high exceptionally high arch so and very high feet er my feet be you know very solid and sort of high so but i can't get anything in i can't get them in any shoe even walk shoe so you know it's no bloody good
S0282	i think the only way you can go from there be to actually have your shoe make and have them make so that they're the right shape for you
S0293	oh mm well my mum's be down this cos we've all get my mum's feet basically
S0282	mm
S0293	and it it it do limit you know my mum use to go round in i don't know white lace up things which be they're just horrible anyway it's
S0282	you can get nicer shoe if you have them make
S0293	yeah it's just expensive though
S0282	oh yeah no absolutely expensive
S0293	yeah
S0282	but perhaps you know just one pair really or something
S0293	well possibly but i can't imagine
S0282	a treat for your birthday present
S0293	i can't imagine that there be many treat that i want at the moment but
S0282	i know
S0293	i can't imagine that particular one come my way but erm i find this in the charity shop it's you know the
S0282	i notice that it's really nice
S0293	but it's it's only size ten which be er you know it's a blow so it doesn't even cross it doesn't even erm fasten but
S0282	it's look good it's a nice shape
S0293	oh my god it's just
S0282	let me feel
S0293	it's not the feel it's just the colour aren't the colour fantastic
S0282	oh it's soft mm it really match
S0293	the of blue and brown i just
S0282	er yes i be look at it earlier and i couldn't work out if it be er it be brown or grey
S0293	i love their colour i just think their colour be every time i go in that shop and i think oh my god so fantastic
S0282	mm
S0293	i love er all the colour jerseys but who would spend that kind of money unless you have silly money i mean have you see the price
S0282	well when your children eventually leave home
S0293	no no nobody would buy a jersey that expensive
S0282	you can have i don't know i've get a cashmere twinset which be really really expensive really really really expensive but it have last for twenty plus year twenty five years and it still look as good as new so it's not a false economy
S0293	yeah well there be that if you do get good jerseys it do make a difference doesn't it
S0282	yeah cos the rest look so ratty so quick
S0293	my suit be just er er you know i've get a couple of suit which i buy really really early on and they're fine now you know
S0282	mm
S0293	er i agree with you about buy good stuff but
S0282	oh well it's out of the question now
S0282	and anyway i'm change shape all the time so i'm
S0293	how's your weight erm loss thing go
S0282	er well last time i weigh myself i have lose twenty kilos
S0293	how much be that in stone
S0282	i have no idea
S0293	sound a lot
S0282	there's two point two pound per kilo
S0293	sixteen pound er no fourteen pound in a stone fourteen twenty so you've lose two stone er almost
S0282	oh be that be that all i don't want to do it in stone then in that in that case cos that's really depress that take a year
S0293	two two kilos in a no i'm gonna be wrong about this two pound
S0282	two point two pound i think a kilo be two point two pound so twenty kilos be ten kilos be oh no this be ridiculous this be embarrass i'm not do i'm sorry it's friday afternoon and i i can't do maths
S0282	and i can't there's no point it doesn't mean
S0293	twenty kilos be i'm just gonna look it up on the computer twenty kilos be how many stone
S0282	how long be go to be go
S0293	three minutes
S0282	well
S0293	i'm a whizz at this
S0282	yes but then what be i gonna do be i gonna talk to myself for three minutes i be gonna talk to myself for three minutes this be just plain sabotage actually if somebody leave the room in the middle of a record to go away and do something for three minutes it's just plainly sabotage so this be very nice i have a day out walk with some people and i'm now exhaust cos we've be out for such a long walk and now i'm have lapsang souchong lapsang souchong that just show how tire i be and cake which be a really nice treat at the end of the afternoon
S0293	it's very very impressive
S0282	be it
S0293	yeah it's over three stone
S0282	oh wow well good i hope it show actually
S0293	well it do show
S0282	it's be hard win
S0293	well it do show three stone be pretty bloody impressive how much further have you get to go
S0282	er well i don't know if i get back to my sort of erm you know my glory days
S0293	no no we're not go for i wouldn't er go for glory days aren't you just go for normal
S0282	well the thing be it depend i need to get back into the clothe that i have when i be work up to the year two thousand and four and and they i can't remember even what size they be but they be my posh clothe and my expensive clothe and my really nice work clothe
S0293	can you not alter the size
S0282	they're all pack away i haven't look at them for age
S0293	mm
S0282	because it's just too depress i haven't throw them all i haven't throw them away because that would just be that would break my heart really and i use to look at them and think oh i'll never get into that but
S0293	i get rid of a lot of mine the smaller ones so wait a minute er anyway if you want to get to er your fight fit weight what would that be then
S0282	nine and a half
S0293	and what be you now
S0282	don't know well last time i weigh seventy eight kilos so i don't know what that be in stone
S0293	you haven't get that long to go then have you you're do quite well
S0282	no no no i'm i'm get there it's probably another well it depend how strict i be if i stay on the strictness of the diet i've be on it should be another six months but i'm lately i'm just get a bite tire and feed up so i haven't be as assiduous and actually have not be help me because he have not be er measure quantities and he's be start to go like we be before which be just basically you know just not measure or weigh pasta or portion of food so i shall have to get him back do that as well and when my dad move in he's my dad's suppose to be on a diet so we're gonna erm have to start try to enforce that as well
S0293	mm
S0282	but erm my dad be try to they tell they say to my dad he have to lose weight because it be a strain on his heart and of course he and my mother be take this as be a kind of a question of defeat er you know of confound a person in authority by by you know eat cup a soup for the two weeks before you go and see the specialist and then the rest of the time just ignore
S0282	what you're suppose to be do
S0293	mm
S0282	but anyway
S0293	yeah i've er i'm go to get down to my sister's go down to eight stone eight and a half stone
S0282	really mm that's
S0293	she's quite similar build to me she's a bite taller than i be perhaps
S0282	oh that's too thin then
S0293	which be oh er she's ridiculously thin erm it's you know she's five foot oh actually she be taller than me i reckon she's five foot nine five foot eight five foot nine
S0282	well that's just ridiculously thin in that case
S0293	so she i the lowest weight i'd be happy if i get down to ten and a half ten and a half would be erm a fine weight to be in my book
S0282	mm
S0293	so i've still get another stone to go
S0282	well it's not so much about i mean i cos i never know how much i weigh before really it's just about whether my clothe whether my nice clothe fit
S0293	well i know i have to do it that way cos i have to kind of er we put on two stone completely accidentally that be well we put on one stone completely accidently
S0282	mm
S0293	i know i be around eleven stone and then we put on a stone
S0282	one do one do it's very easy to do that
S0293	so erm
S0282	but also er it's it's come off the wagon and stop be vegetarian because erm in er and actually then not adjust because if you put meat back in your diet and you then don't
S0293	you gotta cut the fat back
S0282	rack back on the carbs severely and the fat
S0293	the fat as well yeah
S0282	straight away
S0293	but you have a very yeah you have a very fatty diet didn't you very i for me come in to a vegetarian diet be a lot more fat and a lot more carbs than i would eat naturally
S0282	yeah oh yeah much more carbs absolutely
S0293	but fat actually as well interestingly sort of the cream and the cheese and the
S0282	yeah and pastry and
S0293	yeah mm
S0282	and stuff like that so you you have to erm if you er when you're eat on your own on a weekday night you can just have a vegetable stew and throw in one pot but if you invite people round it's very difficult to give them a vegetable stew people really feel hard do by so you have to do a thing to mimic what you would have if you be eat meat which be you know a piece of meat and discreet vegetables
S0293	do you eat much fish
S0282	no not really
S0293	you see we eat a lot of fish that's our
S0282	i'm not really very partial to fish
S0293	mm we eat we're eat as much fish as we can get away with actually
S0282	mm
S0293	so we eat fish er three four three time a week at least yeah
S0282	mm well we have now things like can tuna cos that's always a really quick supper and er we have er and when my day off be friday so we have fish and chip on friday night which be also 's treat as well i have some rock salmon or something the other day which i'd never have before cos i think cod be extraordinarily bore or er have say that when we go to this restaurant on thursday we have last thursday i have erm a piece of smoke cod which be beautiful really nice but it be all this this er sort of very high end michelin star er you know little teeny weeny portion of things so like little scallop about this big
S0282	and er and then they sort of say oh with er you know with parsnips and and actually they must've make one parsnip go round the whole din room
S0282	because you just get like half a matchstick of parsnip
S0282	it be really quite extraordinary and and they have a hierarchy of waiters and erm and so one person come round and be like oh no i can't describe the food to you i shall have to call my colleague so the other colleague have to come and say oh this be a carpaccio of cod with a erm
S0293	do you dress up to go
S0282	no not particularly
S0293	it's so you know i really there's no nothing we ever dress up for any more it's quite sad really i like
S0282	it be sad
S0293	i like dress up i really do like dress up and er you know you can't you know christmas party no party ever people dress up these days
S0282	no
S0293	smart casual i mean they spend lot of money on their casual clothe but it's not
S0282	no
S0293	what i like enjoy do i like to wear i don't know i like to wear nice fabrics and nice cut things and
S0282	there's somebody who's in my erm in this group of 's who be always dress in a really quirky fashion and she have she buy clothe from this woman who who make clothe out of vintage bits of fabric so she's always wear something that be extraordinarily quirky with a very quirky print and er erm very kind of odd shape and really peculiar button and stuff like that and she look amaze she always wear really bright colour so pink or red or green or blue just vibrant hue and she's very i mean it look really nice and but she er you know it doesn't matter the rest of us be in jeans and t shirt and she'll turn up in like a prom dress or something like that or a
S0293	it's really cheer though you know
S0282	yeah oh yeah
S0293	and you know when i go and see my dad they all notice when you're dress up
S0282	mm
S0293	the old people cos it's get bore
S0282	yeah
S0293	it must get so bore look at old people in bore old clothe mustn't it

S0282	and so what she's get a video on her phone as well be it worth
S0293	yeah
S0282	be it worth do can you see can you actually really see her
S0293	i can't bear it
S0282	can't you
S0293	no i can't bear the video call we have to do that by skype last time
S0282	mm
S0293	and actually it be very grainy
S0282	yeah
S0293	and we couldn't hear each other properly it drive her absolutely will call later so that's fine just
S0282	just sound as though she might be in a place where the
S0293	sorry
S0282	it might be that she might in a place where her reception's not good or be your reception alright here
S0293	yeah
S0282	i be er we i we go to today and erm go to be slightly complicate because it's not very obvious the route and so i set off and my satnav honestly i'm gonna i'm i don't know whether it's do you think it's this area because er our satnav just do not work our my satnav almost all the way to say it couldn't find a satellite signal and so it just keep switch itself say can't find a signal can't find a signal turn itself off
S0282	so i be late because by the time i be fiddle with it and i miss a turn off and
S0293	oh
S0282	goodness know what
S0293	i do find round your area i can't get much of a signal sometimes
S0282	it might be that it might be the i don't know if it's the tree
S0293	yeah
S0282	or whether the soldier have get some sort of damp
S0293	i think there maybe some er there may be some blockage system
S0282	round the erm round all the barrack er so you can't get a signal on the barrack like in a hospital where you can't get a signal
S0293	mm
S0282	cos they've block it off
S0293	there's something like that round your area definitely
S0282	mm i wouldn't be at all people pooh pooh me when i say that
S0293	no i wouldn't be surprise
S0282	and also er i get this funny buzz in my ears when i'm on erm the east side of my house
S0293	mm
S0282	and i think that there's there may be some electronic thing go on there but everybody say that er i be erm paranoid and this be not true but i definitely have a ring in my ears that i don't have at other time when i'm in my live room or in my bedroom
S0293	mm oh well i trust your trust your instincts on this thing er i should think the army have all kind of weirdo weird and wonderful things
S0282	but i could turn into one of these barmy old ladies who believe that you shouldn't be anywhere near a you know telegraph pole or something who know
S0293	no i'm increasingly increasingly anti anti technology although this have this have be very good cos er er as you interestingly neither of us like do facetime we only like see speak as if an on a phone it's the only feel or else it make her feel further away actually
S0282	mm oh
S0293	if you speak on the phone it's fine
S0282	yeah
S0293	cos it just feel like an ordinary telephone call
S0282	yeah
S0293	she's like around the corner and like you know you'll ring your mum up
S0282	yeah
S0293	feel okay if you start get skypy it start feel like she's bloody miles away and i think she feel the same way actually so
S0282	mm
S0293	she doesn't normally phone me very much she's have such a nice time but erm
S0282	well that's that's so good i'm just so please about that it's just such a good decision wasn't it
S0293	mm it's marvellous yeah it's er it's absolutely marvellous and she's you know she's quite proactive about things i don't know she's yeah she's change er have definitely turn a corner unlike our who's erm definitely not
S0282	oh dear poor kid that's just so not fair but then i don't know whether it's cos she's have that kick back with the exams as well or be it just too much now
S0293	no it it's a disaster at this particular point cos she's get these big college audition as well just come up so it's very difficult from a confidence point of view to pick yourself up and erm and and er get out there it but on the other hand you know for be in the music industry you've get to be prepare for this
S0282	well yes that's true
S0293	er because they all have different they like different style i mean they er her and her friend obviously they're the same standard although her teacher say she should've get it er she teach both of them
S0282	ah
S0293	she say she really do reckon should've get it but
S0282	and what happen if this other girl bomb out
S0293	she won't bomb out
S0282	why not cos the thing er the thing that er strike me about be how much she enjoy it
S0293	oh she
S0282	and she er she appear not to have very bad nerve and when you when we when we go to see her in that concert she be so joy of it
S0282	and she be just so
S0293	yeah
S0282	into the performance
S0293	mm
S0282	and so engage in everything but
S0293	you couldn't get more involve than actually
S0282	yeah
S0293	you really couldn't wasn't like that
S0282	no
S0293	nobody
S0282	whereas actually yes and erm
S0293	mm
S0282	you you know obviously doesn't like it at some level to be in a kind of competitive situation and and erm do get nerve and do lose lose her you know sort of
S0293	this girl oh no no 's fine on
S0282	her calm sometimes
S0293	she she doesn't like she doesn't like erm she doesn't like the orchestra so much she work with a big group of people be hard work for her
S0282	mm
S0293	whereas er just can't get enough of it
S0282	mm
S0293	the more people around the better
S0282	mm
S0293	and to be in charge of a section she couldn't you couldn't've get a better section leader cos she so good
S0282	well i know that's er that's why i'm think well you know be there a chance that they'll sort of think my goodness what we need be we need back
S0293	she'd be so fair and
S0282	you know
S0293	she'd be so fair but this other girl be er er er er she i know she's quite bossy and whatever sometimes they have terrible section leaders they do last year absolutely bloody awful she have asperger's and really really bad with them and you just have to put up with em and bear it erm and it do happen there's two things erm one lead the section and two do the solo
S0282	mm
S0293	and three prepare the section get the section to do the work on it but it's it's do you have to move on
S0282	well i hope she get another opportunity
S0293	mm
S0282	what's happen about her maths
S0293	she's plod on
S0282	be she poor sausage
S0293	yeah it's it's not erm she be do a lot of extra class and things but i don't i don't think she's really get how important it be but i don't know we'll see
S0282	be this will this give her a chance to catch up a bite
S0293	well only she she wouldn't get above a c if even if she work her bollocks off she couldn't get above a c now
S0282	well that's alright it's a pass
S0293	yeah oh i'd be perfectly happy with a bloody c i tell you but
S0293	it's a shame because i think she could've get a b but erm i'd be very happy with a c er to get a c in german will be a miracle get to go from a u to a c for coach for that oh god bloody coach
S0282	ah that's er extraordinary isn't it really
S0293	yeah it be and she's very dismissive of it but that's cos she's so pliant about the money she get terribly worry about pay out money i mean that's part of the problem i have with be she try to economise on things so for example reeds she won't buy enough reeds and then she run out and then
S0282	mm
S0293	and you can't order them or she won't do the coach cos she say it's too expensive or she won't take she hasn't get enough money on her therefore she end up at a station without enough train fare to get home that kind of thing that kind of thing happen to quite a bite
S0282	mm
S0293	cos she's so busy try to save money it doesn't doesn't help really
S0282	mm
S0293	a good good attitude but it just doesn't help in the long run like she wouldn't have any money in her account like i like to have a hundred pound in her account for when she need money urgently for an audition or reeds or something turn up and otherwise i have to be available at precisely that moment lot of things have deadlines you know you've get to be able to do it sometimes and she wouldn't have it her account and of course we just end up with me have to do three very complicate transfer against the clock and i'm think you know if you'd only have the bloody money
S0282	mm
S0293	it would've be an awful lot easier for all of us
S0282	mm
S0293	erm but anyway we'll see
S0282	mm so where be she at school at the moment
S0293	yeah she's get an orchestra course she's do they're do this concert actually and erm in a symphony concert on sunday they've get a course and then she go off to this holiday that we totally disapprove of to spain without her oboe and without her text book
S0282	oh right oh yes
S0293	with the girl who's get her place in the orchestra
S0282	oh
S0293	so yes so we
S0282	do you think their friendship will survive this
S0293	's quite generous about it actually she she couldn't talk to her for a day but she seem to have work it out
S0282	mm
S0293	but then er the girl work out why be so upset it's funny isn't it that's she's slightly she slightly catch cold she didn't work that bite out i guess if you haven't be in a i dunno i don't know why she hadn't work out how erm couldn't care about anything else except
S0282	oh no
S0293	it's funny but er
S0282	that's er
S0293	anyway her teacher her teacher be very good and
S0282	poor kid
S0293	her old teacher be really good she we brilliant actually she couldn't couldn't get hold of her teacher this be when you realise they're such fantastic human be she couldn't get hold of her current teacher so she ring up her old teacher and she's so brilliant at sort of put it all in perspective and be sensible about it and calm down and understand the realities of it all she be absolutely fantastic
S0282	that's good i mean will will it help that she do it for a year
S0293	oh yeah yeah no it do help yes you can two years
S0282	you can you can you can present it that actually for personal reason she couldn't do it
S0293	you wouldn't want you couldn't lie cos they all they work with these people er all the time people would be able to tell
S0282	well in which case everybody will know that there be a change of policy or that there be a decision make so
S0293	well no it wasn't exactly it wasn't as it's not as clear as that they never tell you er it's a very strange email they send through they they're never really clear of the reason
S0282	mm
S0293	so they say it's a it's a general email they send through say that they have to balance er that first and foremost it's the erm er it be do on merit it's meritocratic the best the person get the best position however this be balance out with how this have to be balance with how much each person would get from continue in the orchestra so there have to be a balance of whether they feel that she would get enough from continue in the orchestra or whether somebody else who hadn't be in it before would gain more and i can understand that if you're a equal standard
S0282	that's very weasely
S0293	it's very weasely it basically give them
S0282	and how be they to say erm i suppose that that you know that's kind of sop cos you're then you're suppose to conclude well actually i'm so good now and i've progress so much
S0293	it's weasely
S0282	that actually i've get eighty per cent of the value i can get out of this and another year would only give me another twenty per cent and therefore somebody else would
S0293	but then on the other hand they're say it's completely meritocratic
S0282	yes
S0293	so it's not really it's
S0282	no it's not meritocratic be it
S0293	no
S0282	how can
S0282	no it's either meritocratic or it isn't you can't have meritocratic er mitigate with some other factor
S0293	exactly
S0282	because then it's it's
S0293	yeah er but er it it er be renowned i mean paul daniel who be most famous oboist there be never get in to
S0282	really
S0293	yes
S0293	and erm er we know many stories whereby a teacher would say this be the most definitely will get in this person hasn't get a cat's chance in hell and then that person that hasn't get a cat's chance in hell will get the position and the other one won't so it be very idiosyncratic
S0282	mm yes
S0293	they never give you any rationale you never know what's really happen there's quite a lot about personality in fact get on very well with this tutor but i don't think she's she have a terrible injury so i don't think she'd see much of er operate so she probably didn't realise how serious she be erm it's a variety of things there always be always be a variety of things
S0282	mm
S0293	i mean if er when she get chuck out it be for very good reason and er but we be very lucky cos he felt so bad well 's teacher know him very well and and he she make him ring her up and that be brilliant because he say you know you didn't know the piece well enough you you and she be she be she didn't
S0282	she be wing it again
S0293	practise it she be wing it yeah
S0282	yes
S0293	and and you know that be a reality to that and it it be a terrible shock but er you know there be some reality to it
S0282	mm
S0293	erm anyway
S0282	i don't know perhaps it's better if you have an experience like that somewhere along the line when you
S0293	it be you have to have it you have to have it
S0282	mm so it just teach you what happen
S0293	well you have to
S0282	when you don't
S0293	you have to be robust enough to deal with the knock you can't be a musician and many many good musicians fall by the way at this stage
S0282	yeah
S0293	or at music college cos they can't can't cope with the rejection if they've always be the best
S0282	yeah
S0293	and suddenly they start get knock
S0282	but then on the other hand this be where it start get serious because it's you know beyond a certain age nobody's go to stand up and clap you and beam all over their face and be please to see you stand on a stage just cos you're you as your parent and your friends and your aunties and uncles et cetera would do you know you become just another musician in an orchestra one of however many perhaps you're cannon fodder you're certainly pay a shitty amount of money you know and actually the reality of be a musician as an adult be be you're not a gild youth any more at all you're a hack
S0293	no no no
S0282	and the transition from gild youth to hack must also be
S0293	it's a really rough transition
S0282	yeah
S0293	it's really rough and and and interestingly now i've go through it with the kid i think it's more interest because they be train to such a high level and they dedicate themselves from such a young age all of these kid will've be practise serious amount of time from fourteen onwards
S0282	mm mm
S0293	you know it's they be adults in their play
S0282	mm
S0293	from the age of fourteen onwards
S0282	yeah
S0293	and then as you say they just become any old hack who's sort of hire for a pittance to do you know play a tune
S0282	mm yes
S0293	and it
S0282	and nobody notice you again and actually you're probably sit in the dark most of the time
S0293	yeah
S0282	cos erm you know you're just you're just at the back and super you know just i don't know just
S0293	well that's why
S0282	you might as well be play the triangle or something ping
S0293	but it's a society unto itself i think the musicians all appreciate each each other so
S0282	oh yeah there must be a benefit there must be a benefit to it i mean i suppose i don't know an artist or
S0293	yes it be an artist
S0282	any any other kind of perform really that that actually the comradeship of your peer and be part of the little
S0293	well they know whether you're good or they know whether you're good or not
S0282	yeah no
S0293	and you be create music and er you know you know whether you're do it well or not about personal satisfaction i think
S0282	yeah yeah yeah
S0293	for you know like with er with the she actually really didn't care whether she get through or not all she care about be whether she felt she have do her best
S0282	yeah
S0293	it be about it be a personal thing
S0282	no
S0293	it be she could stand up in front of her contemporaries and feel pride in what she have produce and she could and that's it wasn't anything to do with anybody else it's just whether she could actually say she actually play like she want to
S0282	yeah and what be really nice when we go to that concert be other people see other people around go oh that's oh that's and come up and say oh hello
S0293	
S0282	when we go up to the to see what be the name of that musician that whose piece we listen to that time when we go up to see on that saturday night at the there be that modern begin with a a modern composer
S0293	oh adès
S0282	adès
S0293	yeah
S0282	be it adès
S0293	yeah
S0282	and i really like that music
S0293	i oh i i we saw erm the tempest which be an opera by adès which i think be bloody brilliant it's it's a film you if you ever get a chance to see it
S0282	mm
S0293	it's it's quite weird but i think it be wonderful
S0282	oh right
S0293	yeah well mm we shall we shall see but erm 's actually win a competition she's win a concerto competition and she's do erm a performance up at erm the new well it's a new concert hall in it's call it's just opposite the centre it's part of
S0282	mm
S0293	and it's huge and she's do that in december so she's get big things come up
S0282	oh well that's good
S0293	so it's yeah
S0282	and what do you say erm that erm what do you say that et cetera be come round to have a look at a gym to have a look at oh no to have a look at 's
S0293	's house
S0282	's house not er at a gym i think oh my god
S0293	no no no they're come round to socialise really
S0282	oh right
S0282	and be come as well or just
S0293	no
S0282	no cos he's on holiday
S0293	's well doesn't socialise with and doesn't come down ever
S0282	doesn't he
S0293	no be very antisocial he play he play golf but he doesn't he go on the golf trip but he doesn't doesn't socialise otherwise
S0282	mm they be down at our house the other day mend the boiler again again something else go wrong but it's a three way valve and they always go wrong it's very bore indeed it drive me bonkers you wake up in the middle of the night and you think what's that noise you think it's the boiler what be the what time be it why be the boiler go and of course because it's the the valve have block it's still just go like billy o and it's the middle of the night and all the radiators be boil hot and the water be pip hot and everything and it won't switch itself off because the valve be stick in the open position it's really frustrate
S0293	mm mm yeah they be annoy we when we do the kitchen we need a new boiler i guess will talk to
S0282	how far have you get on with
S0293	nowhere
S0282	nowhere
S0293	we've get the plan for we've get build regs plan now
S0282	oh
S0293	saw the builder but he can't do us till next year so i don't think any builder's go to be able to do us until next year
S0282	oh it's frustrate isn't it
S0293	to be honest there's quite a few things we have to do ourselves and we're not progress with those you know we've get to change some gutter we've get to move a flower bed we've get to empty the shed get rid of the shed you know there's quite a lot of stuff we have to do
S0282	mm
S0293	which erm we're not really address at the moment we've get to get
S0282	no it's very frustrate
S0293	skip in and we've get to actually
S0282	it's very satisfy get a skip
S0293	i know well i want to get one now cos it's the only way i'm go to get to empty the bloody shed and we've get just we've empty 's loft which be a huge and to be fair to him he do it himself erm which be well help him
S0282	mm
S0293	erm but that be a huge relief cos we do a whole load of old carpet and god know what else
S0282	oh that's terrible and you imagine that they're still gonna be alright and you look at them and you think
S0293	they probably would've be alright but you know there come a point when you just don't have the will to lay these things do you
S0282	no and actually also we roll up the carpet in one room in our house to put to to put the wardrobe in new wardrobe what i didn't realise be once you've roll up the carpet the last thing you should do be walk on it because when the guy come round and i say oh can you relay that carpet he say no i can't cos it's all crease up if i lay it now you're gonna have to call me back in about three weeks' time because when all the crease have have unfold from it again it will be too loose so therefore you have to lay it back down and not pin it down for the next sort of three or four weeks and when call me back after that when all the crease have go and then i'll then i'll pin it back down again
S0293	mm
S0282	that and he sort of say have anybody be walk on there so say er er well yeah didn't realise we weren't suppose to so so it's so once they've be roll up in the loft for however long i would imagine they're never gonna lie flat again actually
S0293	no
S0282	they're not roll down to a piece of cardboard like they be in the first place
S0293	no
S0282	they're just sort of sloppily throw up there likewise lino
S0293	and the other thing well 's friends have just be sleep on them and sleep on em
S0282	oh yeah
S0293	but erm the other thing be i suspect this bloody project be gonna end up er exponentially must more expensive than we'd anticipate
S0282	mm
S0293	because actually when it come to it 's begin to realise that he can't do certain things himself and he hasn't get he just hasn't get the time
S0282	be that his knees as well
S0293	it's just time hasn't go the time erm
S0282	mm
S0293	you know er
S0282	er i be gonna say earlier as well be have you do you ever have massage cos er if you have massage that i think that would help as well
S0293	i don't find anybody i trust cos the cos i've have a back problem i'd only want to do it with somebody i really trust for massage
S0282	yeah
S0293	i wouldn't go for a general massage cos some people can bugger me up
S0282	yeah
S0293	and there be people that that be good but i would only go on personal recommendation
S0282	yeah no quite but i be wonder if that might help really
S0293	it's expensive expensive
S0282	yeah all these things be expensive
S0293	but actually that's what my mum use to do think about it she do yoga massage and she that help her with her stiffness so perhaps that be something well i'll try these exercise and see cos i've be do quite a lot of swim recently and i think well it have help i have get
S0282	well that ought to help a bite yeah
S0293	well yeah but it it actually hasn't help on the lower back it doesn't hasn't er it help in term of pain and it help in er term of general strength but it doesn't help it have help to a certain extent with the knee but it hasn't help get up and dress and move around type things
S0282	mm mm
S0293	so er
S0282	and when be the last time you have a new mattress
S0293	er fifteen years ago it be a good one
S0282	perhaps you should get a new mattress
S0293	well i know we've be think about that we probably do need a new mattress
S0282	my actually er my er cos er have one of 's fetishes be about mattresses and he always use to say i like a really really firm mattress so he we go out and buy a we have to go to to buy this mattress and we get the hardest one in the shop which he insist be the only one he could sleep on and we sleep on that for i don't know er for i can't remember how long and in the end i have to say to him i cannot sleep on this mattress any more because actually you know what it be really seriously do my hip in and my leave hip i have
S0282	i er my hip be out of joint really just a bite kind of erm just i don't know unbalance or slightly twist or slightly tense er i don't know i be kind of cock my hip a bite
S0293	mm
S0282	for such a long time and i just have a permanent hip ache so i have to go on my leave hand side and in the end i have to say to him look we will have to get we'll have to get a softer mattress so we do get a softer mattress
S0293	why don't you do er two two
S0282	and then ah well no and then we have erm and then we get a softer mattress still wasn't enough and my hip be still bad and then in the end i buy a i buy a new bed and a new mattress without consult him and i get a more expensive mattress and one that i've get more pad and one that have more independent spring which mean that actually that it it's much more responsive to your individual weight and protuberances
S0293	ours be an incredible expensive bed we buy
S0282	mm
S0293	because actually interestingly as you say we have be have a terrible time and i be in agony at night and hadn't sleep for years and we be you know some friends say we'd only just inherit bed and whatever we'd never buy one so we buy a really high quality bed and it's be really really good
S0282	yeah
S0293	it's it's difficult to know whether we actually would improve matter or not er can still sleep on it it's not bad the bed
S0282	well the thing the thing be say that he have to have a hard mattress he sleep he sleep whatever he's sleep on so actually it hasn't matter to him at all that we've get a soft mattress he's be absolutely fine but it's be much much better for me but it's take an awful long time for my hip to get better after that my hip be bad for ten years but the other thing that help me be t'ai chi
S0293	yeah you see i can't do anything like that at the moment cos i fall over
S0282	no but it help with that it's be prove scientifically prove don't give me that look
S0293	no no no
S0282	scientifically prove in ancient japanese people chinese people that it improve your balance
S0293	i'm not very good at class to be honest
S0282	no it be a pain in the arse
S0293	i i erm i i'm not a very groupie person
S0282	you can get youtube videos and you can get
S0293	yeah i'm not i'm also very bad at follow things cos i don't know my right and leave
S0282	oh yeah no yeah that's very
S0293	it's really i can't follow a video
S0293	it's twenty past five
S0293	come on homework it's gonna be a nightmare otherwise tomorrow come on
S0293	i've buy some kitkats for tonight
S0282	and you're not have one unless you've do your homework
S0293	but you do need to get some homework do
S0282	no shame bribe your child with kitkats that's terrible
S0293	well i er i i er i bring up completely differently you should see her pack lunch they're absolutely ridiculous
S0282	chock a block with crisp sweeties
S0293	crisp everything the lot
S0282	jelly cub
S0293	things i completely ban from the other children but i've just give up well just not i haven't give up but bring her differently it be interest how i'm bring her up it's just different and i have to bring her up differently cos she be a different child
S0282	she's a different animal that girl she's be that way
S0293	and er she she's on board now with pack lunch
S0282	mm
S0293	she
S0282	well if she as long as she eat something
S0293	exactly
S0282	just eat anything girl
S0293	well exactly i come to the point where she be eat a lolly for lunch you know it be better than a lolly
S0282	yes quite
S0293	erm
S0282	she's get the will of a
S0293	yeah
S0282	stubbornness of a whatever
S0293	she's quite funny actually cos for somebody who doesn't really take school very seriously she actually do do her homework it's quite amaze to me i haven't have any kind of detentions for not do it or anything
S0282	oh that's quite good cos she's not yeah she's not actually get detention she's not actually you're not actually be haul up
S0282	to have little you know discussions with the headmaster about you know
S0293	well they may be be be very cautious cos she's know to be emotionally vulnerable i don't know
S0282	ah right okay
S0293	but i haven't
S0282	yeah but then on the other hand actually that's the worst possible thing that could happen to her because then she'll just turn out to be a monster when she's thirty cos she'll she'll just be expect people to stay out of her way

S0282	and they might as well not bother i i be er say to i nearly felt like say to them why be you talk there there's no point talk to him and in fact they leave him instructions as to how to clean the filter and i think he probably he he maintain he's do it once but i think to myself if they if they've have to come round again cos hasn't clean that filter i shall be really cross because have not clean the filter again and there's no point in ask to clean the filter he do it once as far as he's concern you know that's it you know you're not that you do it every six months he can't possibly remember something as repetitive as that although i have to say he be get far more practical in his old age at least
S0293	i'm get more impractical you see cos live with i get terribly impractical
S0282	mm
S0293	i use to be quite a practical person not at all now
S0282	no well i suppose it's very easy to leave it to them but erm but anyway erm do you say that have a lathe and everything
S0293	yep bury
S0282	be it don't throw it away
S0293	no no he wouldn't give it away
S0282	there be i be on the the the other person on this course be a barrister who erm who erm have get a i don't know must have his own house with all his own tool and make his own long longbows er longbows and have now and have get a lathe that he buy off somebody for a hundred quid when the person get bore
S0293	that's what that's what 's do use to get him all the stuff from auction
S0282	oh right oh right okay
S0293	so have get a shed full of unbelievably high end wood turn tool
S0282	oh right i'll have to bring in my things to show you
S0293	mm
S0282	i i be quite please with them actually
S0293	mm
S0282	although it be so tire we be just discuss today with the others about how our brain don't work properly any more since we have chemotherapy
S0293	mm
S0282	we're all in the same boat it really really fry your brain so it take such a long time for you brain to come back and by the end of tuesday and by the end of wednesday i be so
S0293	aspect of work isn't it
S0282	tire
S0293	it's what
S0282	that er this guy be tell me he be sort of say right okay start with your tool over here bring it round like this use that hand as a lever that hand as a fulcrum go in this direction and by the end of the afternoon i be like er i couldn't make my brain tell my arm what to do especially my right arm the right hand side of my body seem to be completely unbiddable and my brain be just like not send message it's like i be suppose to have my elbow up here and do this with my elbow and my brain be say okay elbow move and my elbow be just not go anywhere
S0282	and the man's go no no not like that no not like that no not like he's he's very very patient and but i'm gonna have to have some more class and not do all day just do half a day at a time because by the end of the day i be just completely
S0293	expensive hobby though isn't it it's very expensive these class
S0282	it be an expensive hobby
S0293	mm
S0282	but the thing be that if you erm once you've get the tool and once you've get your own stock of wood it's fine
S0293	once you've get the tool it's a mega investment
S0282	i know the tool be very expensive
S0293	and you can buy endless tool have them come in for years every time they go down the pub er a new one would come in by the back gate
S0282	really
S0293	he'd think i wouldn't notice
S0282	well we only use four five different tool
S0293	no 's get an awful lot of them
S0282	have he
S0293	mm
S0282	well it's the lathe that's the most expensive i should imagine you pick up the tool if you if you er keep an eagle eye open cos i've never you know i wouldn't've know what i be look at
S0293	's your man

S0293	mm
S0282	so she be very much like that
S0293	mm
S0282	so anyway we can stop in a minute it's nearly there you do realise you've help me to earn twenty quid near enough fifty two minutes it's only a few minutes to go so what be your so this weekend in what erm my husband keep ask me question about it
S0293	i don't
S0282	and and i keep say i really don't know
S0293	don't don't don't come if it's er
S0282	well it's not that it no it's not that it's not that actually
S0293	it feel like if er it
S0282	no i tell you what
S0293	we very rarely we very rarely ask people to to come down and i guess cos it's so such a special place to us in a funny kind of way
S0282	mm
S0293	and erm i guess it may not be like that for other people and and er i guess er i can quite easily take offence actually when people don't seem seem to like it so i really wouldn't it's not a big deal come down cos we
S0282	no no no i i tell you i can tell you exactly what the problem be first of all have get a week off last week
S0293	mm
S0282	secondly i be suppose to go to hospital on monday for an appointment and then thirdly there's that weekend which involve take the monday off work now monday's at work for him be really big days they have really big meet with the permanent sector on a monday and with all the senior managers and stuff like that
S0293	well that's why i'm say just don't don't bother come a different time
S0282	so no no no no no well that it won't help because it'll be always be a monday but because erm
S0293	no it won't always be a monday er it be this time cos of the half term
S0282	mm well okay okay but er because my appointment be cancel and he go into work this monday he then relax a lot more because he think that out of four out of four mondays in the month he be take three of them off which er leave him quite vulnerable because that mean that he's not in the room when really quite big decisions get make about his work
S0293	well i quite understand that
S0282	and stuff like that but because i didn't have a hospital appointment on monday
S0293	yeah
S0282	it mean that he be now far more relax
S0293	but even so
S0282	about
S0293	even so we you can wait and we can go on a friday sometime we just didn't get the friday date during half term this time sometimes we get friday saturday sunday but we didn't this time
S0282	no no no no no that's fine now he's all square and but also he's just be he's be arsey about he's just be arsey he's be arsey with me that's the point he's not be arsey with anybody else he's just be arsey with me and also maintain also the other thing of course be he maintain it be the first he'd hear of it well actually i then find a note of a phone conversation he's have with you where it be quite plain that he'd talk to you about it he swear blind that this be he'd never hear of it before but which be just him again be arsey with me really but erm so the friday
S0293	yeah er i think we will drive down in our car so if you drive over here
S0282	mm
S0293	we wouldn't leave before probably eight i think not early
S0282	eight what
S0293	seven seven thirty at night
S0282	at night
S0293	seven
S0282	not in the morning
S0293	yeah no no no no on friday
S0282	oh well that yes and oh right okay
S0293	er maybe maybe seven eight nine ten yeah maybe seven seven thirty
S0282	oh right okay to avoid the traffic and everything
S0293	yeah
S0282	okay oh well that make that put completely different complexion on things as well
S0293	i think probably seven thirty
S0282	okay
S0293	i'll talk to tonight but er it it wouldn't be any earlier than that
S0282	oh well no that's fine
S0293	mm
S0282	because that's fine
S0293	wouldn't be earlier than seven definitely
S0282	okay oh no cos the other thing about him be he's extraordinarily conscientious i've leave him at home today and he will've work all day without stop he be at his desk at eight o'clock this morning and he will've sit there absolutely all day and he won't've he won't've shift out of his chair all day and he he be extraordinarily self discipline and he be like oh well i have to cos he be like oh i can't possibly skive any work on friday as well that's er no i can't i can't do that that would be wrong if i skive and it's like well actually i'm sure they owe you load of hours quite frankly
S0293	mm yeah
S0282	oh no that make that make it very much easier as well
S0293	but i i wouldn't do it if it's if it's difficult
S0282	no it's not that it's no it's not that it's difficult it's no no it's absolutely fine with me it's just that er you know it really be er broader circumstances that he's in
S0293	i know but that mean we we could do a different we can do different time
S0282	that's just lead him to be an awkward sod really no no he'll be it'll do him good
S0293	we just go we haven't have many well hasn't get any any more leave so that's why we can't take well why couldn't we take the friday we couldn't take the friday cos the kid be at school and and then they're off on monday so we've get that we've get that weekend at er sometimes we get erm in the holiday we get friday saturday sunday but 's get that this time
