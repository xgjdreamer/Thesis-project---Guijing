S0336	i erm have pretty much decide that i'm not gonna to drive to work any more
S0337	any more any more
S0336	any more any more
S0337	okay
S0336	erm my car isn't reliable in the slightest and i'm just not enjoy it at all like aside from the like the congestion traffic et cetera et cetera like obviously with it get darker now for the whole hour i'm drive home i'm just i'm squint and i'm start in like into headlights and it's just not very nice and i i get to work in the morning and i'm exhaust because i've have to concentrate so hard for the last hour just to get myself to work i'm exhaust by the time i start and when i get home i'm exhaust because i've do a whole day's work and then i've have to drive home for an hour so i'm get home and it's it's not even seven o'clock and i'm absolutely shatter whereas like even though the train be a little bite more of a faff but when i get to work on on the mornings i get the train even though i've leave probably for work about forty minutes earlier than i would be car i'm i've get more energy by the time i get to work and then
S0337	yeah
S0336	come home like i've get plenty of energy when i get home to do stuff
S0337	okay if that's what you wanna do that's what you'll do
S0336	and the way i see it like that
S0337	you need if you need to take the car you can take it
S0336	well the way i see be that like erm this way i'm get incidental exercise so i don't have to feel so bad about like not get to the gym and stuff erm but er that kind of bring me to my car i wanna get rid
S0337	okay
S0336	i don't see the point of hold onto it obviously i've say i wanna take you out in it tonight to listen to it you know when you just i know it's about to cost me more money it be about to cost me more money i be i be kind of surprise that they be even will to offer me like six or seven hundred quid for it because it's do so many miles and it's so old and it be batter but i'm surprise it's even worth that at the moment my concern be actually if i let it get to a state where it need more work again not only be it gonna cost me money but actually the value of the car isn't gonna warrant me pay it if the car's worth six hundred quid now i don't wanna keep spend two or three hundred pound at a time to fix it cos that's ridiculous
S0337	it's not actually
S0336	i'm never gonna get that money back erm which bring me onto something we be talk about yesterday in that erm i wonder whether you perhaps would like to buy a new car use my car as part exchange and then sell your car and just pocket the money because you say to me basically yesterday that get cars on finance it that would be the money you would put into save for if you want to go away with your friends et cetera et cetera well if you if you use the money that you get for your car and put it into a save account
S0337	so i just straight sell my car now basically
S0336	i mean it's just an idea i'm not say that that's i'm not say i'm not you're not i'm just kind of put it out there as a suggestion that we could use my car as part exchange and actually get a little bite of money off and then whatever you make on your car you can just keep as save for you to do whatever you want with
S0337	okay let me try and work this out right we use both cars as a deposit for one car
S0336	well we could do that
S0337	yeah
S0336	if you want
S0337	well yeah
S0336	but that mean you'd have no cash though so it would almost defy the
S0337	yeah maybe
S0336	the point of it
S0337	yeah or maybe sell my car and then use some of that as deposit
S0336	yeah well what i be
S0337	i might see about if my parent want a new car
S0336	well what be
S0337	those off them
S0336	what i be think be what you might be able to do be you know that fifteen hundred pound you've get that's kind of stash aside at the moment you could use that plus my car as a deposit and then put that money back in there when you sell your car do you know what i mean so you'd have like you'd have over two grand as a deposit which mean hopefully that would bring your monthly repayments down like a little bite
S0337	and then i sell my car as soon as possible
S0336	and then you sell your car as soon as possible
S0337	about to obviously pay for my mot aren't i
S0336	yeah but i actually see that as a positive cos if
S0337	what freshly mot'd
S0336	yeah it's but it's a sell point say you know it's not gonna need a service or mot for another year like that's a really big sell point erm and you know like you probably will actually get more for your car with it be service and mot'd cos people kind of trust it a little bite more so i don't see it as a bad thing that it's about to go in for service and mot
S0337	if it pass
S0336	yeah
S0336	erm but yeah annoyingly there's a little bite of a be a little bite of a ticker on it because my tax be due at the end of this month and the tax be like ninety quid for six months which isn't the be all and end all but it's something to bear in mind erm
S0337	i'll talk to i'll i'll talk to my parent and see what they advise
S0336	well i haven't do any sum or anything this be just like me think off the top of my head i need to get rid of my car put it that way i'd quite like the seven hundred quid however that come do you know what mean be this okay with bruise can we watch a film tonight
S0337	no the other night you have me watch soap award
S0336	it wasn't the soap award it be the pride of britain you idiot
S0337	similar
S0336	and we didn't even end up watch all of that you go and play league
S0337	yeah it's bite more grill

S0336	i don't want you to go in there and be like yeah it's all fine it's it's kind of not like there's stuff you wanna ask him
S0337	what
S0336	more money
S0337	yeah
S0336	what do you have to do for more money and actually it shouldn't even be that you should kind of go in there say actually i be make permanent it wasn't i be make permanent and it wasn't even discuss with me like i think in the last year like i've grow from strength to strength i i'm now in charge of like one of our largest customers you know they're really happy with the work that i'm do for them on a on a day to day basis
S0337	can't say that
S0336	like i i think
S0337	cos obviously there be issue there but
S0336	yeah
S0337	there's always gonna be issue
S0336	i think and just sort of say you know i think it do deserve more money and that and the conversation be kind of skip over by just announce that i'd be make permanent without kind of talk to me about it i be little bite disappoint like obviously i'm happy to be make permanent but
S0337	yeah i've
S0336	it's
S0337	i've kind of say this to him
S0336	it's such a big thing and for them to just be like oh by the way now you're permanent and that that be it that's quite disappoint you have to really like in your one to one
S0337	yeah i know but
S0336	you should be allow to fight your corner
S0337	when you look at the i'm not i'm key standard rate and everyone in the office and they're not gonna go just give two grand more than that now it just doesn't happen it might have be in the past with some people in the
S0336	yeah no i appreciate that but that's such a defeatist attitude to have to say oh nobody else in the office be be pay more so why would i ask for more
S0337	it's not defeatist
S0336	it be
S0337	it's realist
S0336	you have to ask if you don't ask you don't get
S0337	i know oh there's pepper in there
S0336	and even if he turn around and say oh i can't offer you more at this point you say right okay well i wanna know that if i do x y and z i will get more money cos otherwise there's no incentive and they know that they can't say right this be what this be how we think you've fare over the last year your goals for the next twelve months be this and expect you to do it for no extra money that's not how it work yes fight face but yeah all the
S0337	oops
S0336	all the personal development stuff be obviously important for you as well you can ask about all of that kind of thing do you think he'll pick up on the fact that you're late quite a lot
S0337	i'm not like late all the time i'm cut it fine
S0337	all the time i wasn't late this morning i be late yesterday i wasn't i haven't be late the rest of the week
S0336	okay
S0337	i just cut it fine
S0336	yeah
S0337	i cut it fine
S0336	well that that
S0337	when i live
S0336	i almost feel like that look just as bad as be late though like you walk into the office at one minute to nine when other people have be sit at their desk for fifteen minutes
S0337	i'm not get pay enough to come in there's different ways of play it
S0336	you know what i'm say though
S0337	i know i know shall i leave this for a bite yeah
S0336	yeah they've probably get another twenty twenty five minutes
S0337	well we're gonna do it like that
S0336	two be probably gonna do it like that
S0337	shall we just put a rack on top of
S0336	just put some tin foil on
S0337	erm well they'll just go in here won't they er be it like that
S0336	well what'll probably happen be that the fat will drip down and it won't just catch in that one neat little thing it'll run around the whole thing
S0337	this suck
S0336	so that's slightly redundant
S0337	well let's not waste that no we'll be we're not gonna use that clearly we're not waste it and chuck it out obviously
S0336	okay but it need to be at least that long
S0337	a whole strip that's retard just just for those two little things
S0336	we're about to
S0337	oh have we use this already what do we use it for
S0336	well it didn't come with a lot i don't think do it
