S0623	but it turn out she can't do today she's get to do erm tomorrow
S0525	why do they make a commitment for wednesday and then change it so quickly
S0623	she say something about her have to go to religious study at the mosque
S0525	well where's the mosque
S0623	i have no idea
S0525	must be i suppose
S0623	guess so anyway she say that she didn't want her to do it all the time erm and so i say oh okay er so she be happy for me and i say be you sure it's alright for me to do er erm a che che che che a wednesday if she's go to mosque on a and she say yeah yeah it's erm it's fine so i'm guess ah here we be guess that she's just speak to her mum and it's actually not okay and they want her to go on a wednesday so
S0525	what do you mean she doesn't want to do it all the time doesn't want tutor every week
S0623	no she doesn't want to go to she doesn't
S0525	oh
S0623	doesn't want her do her religious study all the time she'd rather her do a little bite of school study and then religious study you know the other three days
S0525	oh right
S0623	cos i think she go erm oh i think she go every three
S0623	shush
S0623	monday to thursday erm so it's quite a big commitment
S0525	every day
S0623	monday to thursday yeah
S0525	do the whole family go then or be it just her

S0623	stop it when be it
S0525	it's on the friday saturday and sunday the fourth fifth and sixth of march
S0623	oh be it okay
S0525	it's a pity cos if i could talk him into the fifth we wouldn't be go to the flip garden centre
S0623	yes
S0525	cos murray'll be play it will be good
S0623	oh dear yeah yeah
S0525	but
S0623	right let's see i wonder if
S0525	he think the ticket be extortionate i think they be about right
S0623	yeah
S0623	oh dear
S0525	he suggest it then he look it up and he well not go at that price so i say oh okay
S0525	i know nottingham be a lot cheaper but that's just because it's much lower rank players
S0623	oh
S0525	apart from well there be quite a few it be all women as well that day and
S0623	mm
S0525	they tend to be a bite cheaper as well than watch the men
S0623	where do you say it be again in birmingham but where
S0525	i think it's er birmingham edgbaston or somewhere like that
S0623	oh okay
S0525	yeah i don't i don't know i can't remember
S0623	ah right so
S0525	one of the indoor arenas or something isn't it
S0623	yes yes i think it yeah probably be
S0623	so this work but i don't know how to save it onto the erm onto the computer
S0525	why just cos it's apple but it's also different
S0623	mm
S0525	oh
S0623	yeah i don't know how to would know how to do it if he be here
S0525	can you just leave it open
S0623	er i don't know whether because it's open via a er email so i don't know whether it would cut off if i didn't have a wi fi
S0525	oh i see
S0623	erm oh anyway oh desktop
S0525	this be for the two girls be it
S0623	yes no it's erm
S0525	oh for the new girl
S0623	yes
S0525	what be you teach tonight maths or english
S0623	er a bite of both erm we're do the argos catalogue
S0525	oh yeah
S0623	thing and they've get to design their own erm bedroom we've get a er sorry just a second oh pop up on both computers erm
S0525	mm
S0623	they've gotta design their own bedroom
S0623	and to do that they've get to look in the argos catalogue price it up they've get a budget of a thousand pound so they've gotta add all the money up that they spend and they've also gotta find the things
S0623	they've get to find the things in the argos catalogue to start with so they've gotta use the index
S0525	yeah
S0623	so that's a bite of english
S0525	oh i see and the budget for maths
S0623	mm so it should take them a long time i need to go and get some er child friendly scissor
S0525	be they cut thing out the argus catalogue then
S0623	have a look there yeah gonna stick them into their er gonna stick them on a piece of paper
S0525	good idea
S0623	well i be lose them a little bite last week cos of what we be do so
S0525	right you're make it easier
S0623	do something fun
S0525	mm
S0623	no it's mm
S0525	different
S0623	not really easier it's just yeah apply it a little bite more rather than just erm practice sum which they need to do though it be like couldn't be avoid now i dunno if we want yeah marvellous right i'm gonna close them now and see if they open up on the computer finger cross because otherwise yay
S0525	do you think 's work think that he's look for other job see as he's have a few half days off
S0623	erm i don't know cos they obviously know the situation with that we haven't long have so i think they must just think
S0525	look after the baby
S0623	he's look after him for a bite
S0525	mm
S0623	erm yeah i don't know i don't think they've ask though not that he's say anything
S0525	do he know how many people they're interview
S0623	erm he do say i think they tell well they tell him they've get another few days of do it and as i say they're do they're interview quite a lot of people from in house
S0525	yeah
S0623	from well in the
S0525	yeah
S0623	er in the industry already but er so he seem to think well they're just gonna get it aren't they think well
S0525	well not necessarily
S0623	yeah i say they wouldn't have even consider you if they didn't think
S0525	oh he must have a good chance
S0623	well exactly i say they wouldn't have even bother interview you
S0525	no
S0623	if they be just gonna recruit people from
S0525	well they they do
S0623	there already
S0525	they do actually do that because they have to be see to take a
S0623	oh
S0525	broad spectrum
S0623	of course yeah
S0525	it's like when go internally for the job and she know she's gonna get it they have to interview you
S0623	yeah
S0525	cos you've gotta go through the procedure
S0623	mm
S0525	so he be you know
S0623	okay
S0525	yeah that that isn't a
S0623	oh
S0525	a forego but even if they're do that and then they come across somebody that's actually oh really good
S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	you know and it make them think twice
S0623	mm
S0525	so
S0623	hopefully they'll er
S0525	and he say they be quite keen on the fact he have experience outside of er
S0623	mm
S0525	the remit of a lot of the people they be interview internally
S0623	uhu cos they be only on graduate scheme and obviously he's do three years whereas they'll have only do
S0525	yeah
S0623	well probably maybe a year some of them to
S0525	yeah
S0623	get onto the next position that they're in three and four but so yeah they be quite impress and they say oh you've only do that amount of time but you've already get that much experience
S0525	so he wasn't home last night then choose a car
S0623	not just yet
S0623	he will be he's home most nights choose a car
S0623	he's just never really serious
S0623	but er yes of course he
S0525	that woman who's replace who 's er replace at the she get a company car with her next position
S0623	nice
S0525	but accord to she's a waste of time and apparently erm come in after that incident yesterday
S0623	yes she be tell me
S0525	oh she do do she speak to you erm and cos that woman apparently go on and steal something
S0623	yeah
S0525	from the high street
S0623	from the high street store
S0525	and the police be come in to talk to them today so hopefully
S0623	mm yeah she say they're have a meet with him er with the police so
S0525	be as well
S0623	no i don't think so i think she's just
S0525	why wouldn't
S0623	i dunno
S0525	why wouldn't they
S0623	yeah i think that
S0525	go and see them that's crazy
S0623	yeah well
S0525	anyway come in after that with a manager
S0623	yes
S0525	and say that er or say she'd already turn the store around
S0623	oh okay
S0525	be she tell you that
S0623	no no erm well apparently
S0623	ask her why she didn't drop kick the woman
S0525	oh yeah he be be sarcastic
S0623	of course but for a she be quite
S0525	i saw the photos of her
S0623	oh do you
S0525	oh have she's get them on her phone she take two
S0623	oh oh she she's
S0525	cctv still
S0623	she be gonna send me to them

S0623	yeah
S0525	just in case anybody see her come and
S0623	yeah
S0525	all that stuff oh she be a stocky nasty look piece of work so the dropkick be obviously a a joke because be like a third of the size of this woman
S0623	yes i think be just a bite shock at the manager would even joke well the owner would even joke that she'd do that when she's try to be all professional and so she think she they're up for a bite of a bite of a laugh which she's quite happy about
S0525	well apparently erm say that a lot of the staff have already say how great they think be
S0623	oh
S0525	to that's what she say to
S0623	oh
S0525	and 's
S0623	seem to think that they never like her
S0525	i know and say erm she'd only and apparently the couldn't come and help her with this woman cos they be serve customers
S0623	i know yeah
S0525	which 's tell them to do
S0623	i think she's get to address in her erm meet staff meet be it on sunday
S0525	yeah
S0623	that yes okay we need to be serve customers all the time but if you see something go on
S0623	and it's you know it's er

S0525	it take priority
S0623	that member of staff
S0623	be possibly go to get punch in a minute
S0525	well she say
S0623	i mean yeah
S0525	she'd just be into the you know this she's get that woman who work just in the office
S0623	mm

S0623	oh really
S0525	and 's much better and have just be in and move a few things and
S0623	mm
S0525	erm finish off a few procedures and i say well it's probably cos she feel now that she's do something that's worthwhile
S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	cos the other woman wasn't bother about the report and wasn't file anything
S0623	no
S0525	so what be the point of her do it because you're on it and you're ask her for it

S0623	no not on a saturday morning when i i haven't really i don't really wanna do saturdays anyway
S0525	no i don't blame you
S0623	and we don't do anything on saturday so it's not as if i can't
S0525	she say that would rather have you and they would rather have you the the woman they take her to isn't erm a primary school teacher either she's just some sort of tutor but
S0623	oh really
S0525	yeah so be be it be it finish as far as you know for now until she contact you
S0623	well that's what she just say that she she well she say
S0525	oh
S0623	i'll give you a call
S0525	right
S0623	and i'll speak to
S0525	yeah
S0623	and yeah we'll see what
S0525	er cos i think if it's a saturday i bet she'd get to bring you over anyway
S0623	yeah
S0525	and then you could always you could always come to ours if your dad's around mind you dad often work on a saturday so
S0623	yeah
S0525	'd go in the office actually
S0623	yeah he would be yeah
S0525	probably would be better in
S0623	mm
S0525	cos that's what he'd do he'd just go down
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	to the office for any hour fall asleep
S0623	yeah but yeah i'm sure
S0623	we'd be call him after the hour so
S0525	well we would actually yeah that's the trouble
S0623	yeah with yeah
S0525	or we'd take her up there
S0623	yeah or i could go to the office see if he'd put the heat on
S0525	yeah that's true
S0623	and tutor her there
S0525	yeah
S0623	then i could leave after the hour
S0525	yes that's not a bad idea either be it
S0623	no
S0525	you've get the wi fi there and all the computers
S0623	yeah yeah yeah yeah no we'll see
S0525	well that's worth a suggestion if 's bring her over
S0623	yeah definitely
S0525	cos he'd be much happier then he'd he'd spend his hour do something
S0623	mm
S0525	i mean he's slow at everything he he might make a payment in that hour or something like that
S0623	mm
S0525	say he be struggle with it all all the finance i i say i'd offer to help she go oh but you've you've leave this behind now
S0623	oh
S0525	i say okay you've move on you've leave it behind now i think right er that's probably his his word so fair enough
S0623	yeah
S0525	she say the bank be be very unhelpful and she say er she she say it's cost they've charge us fifteen thousand pound for a letter of credit she it's outrageous and i say erm no that's about right she go what you see 's
S0525	get no idea what things cost and i say
S0623	yeah
S0525	i say they base it on the erm the value of the letter of credit be base on the the value of the money
S0623	yeah
S0525	that they're they're put on there so usually the turnover of the job or the turnover's four million i say isn't it to she go yeah and i say they might have three million three and a half on a letter of credit i say normally work it out on a percentage basis i say our last one be about two million turnover and and i think we spend fifteen thousand on bank fee in total and that include all the currency transactions as well so currency letter of credit any erm any other bank fee that we have
S0623	yeah
S0525	i say so on a job of of four million i say i think i'd be budget between twenty and twenty five thousand for fee oh well that's interest she say i think well why be you even get involve when clearly doesn't know
S0623	well
S0525	and i say erm when we have natwest involve i say they for a a million pound job he take ten percent straight off he take hundred thousand straight off the before we'd even do the job i say they just when the bank be operate differently and how they shouldn't have be i they just look at the profit
S0623	yeah
S0525	then take a chunk
S0623	uhu
S0525	i say so this be nothing
S0623	they obviously have no idea do they
S0525	compare to you know we be quids in with hs i say they
S0623	yeah
S0525	they do a good deal actually compare to what natwest be offer
S0623	mm
S0525	she be horrify
S0623	yeah
S0525	i say so they're not rip you off i say that's about right and it's about standard and that's what you've gotta pay you're deal with a lot of money
S0623	yeah
S0525	you know twenty grand on four million for fee be be nothing
S0623	be nothing no
S0525	oh she say right
S0525	but the thing be you see and they never factor all that in they
S0623	no
S0525	they never factor any contingency and they just look at the pipe
S0623	yeah
S0525	look what they be sell at and look what it be cost them and they forget that
S0525	they've get all sort of charge with delivery when the wagons break down and the crate can't offload and you end up get what they call a demurrage charge which be wagons hang around crane break down so the charge back up massively so that's a big that could take ten thousand pound
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	maybe twenty thirty on a job this size and then you've get the bank fee like i say twenty twenty five thousand so when decide to cut to cut his profit down to a hundred thousand
S0623	mm
S0525	you can halve it again by the time he's take and that's what they never do and won't be take any of that into account
S0623	no
S0525	so they'll cut the profit to get the job and then all those cost
S0623	that's yeah
S0525	will eat into it
S0623	they have no idea do they
S0525	they don't really so if think he be be rip off at fifteen grand i think he's get he never he just didn't get involve
S0525	and now he's do it from scratch on a four million pound job
S0623	oh god
S0525	good luck mr
S0623	yeah
S0525	i don't know and because he's deal with it he'll keep give them discount now as well
S0623	uhu
S0525	well er will you pay earlier if if we give you a ten percent discount on that one and then they will
S0623	mm
S0525	and he's know for it so
S0623	yeah
S0525	i never do that i me and just work away behind the scenes and stop deliveries and all sort till they pay us and
S0623	yeah
S0525	they pay
S0525	'll just give them a discount before you know it he'll be leave
S0623	oh dear
S0525	and he'll pay him the commission he's promise him about fifty grand on that i imagine easily he's gonna pay
S0623	right
S0525	so he'll be leave with nothing again except a debt
S0623	yeah oh dear oh dear
S0525	and hopefully they'll get the next one which i think be gonna be more local but if your dad your dad say he'd go up to scotland and maybe do monday to thursday and then come back and do at the weekend
