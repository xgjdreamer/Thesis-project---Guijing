S0443	maybe yeah it's about three be the best time
S0320	yeah
S0443	mm
S0320	no i'm avoid all of these things until i absolutely have to go

S0320	really
S0443	and my father use to er dress up as father christmas

S0443	oh it'll be somebody's husband
S0320	well it's at the church so it might be the vicar
S0443	no
S0320	let's hope not
S0443	it won't be the vicar
S0320	no i don't think it'll be the vicar
S0320	yeah exactly
S0320	erm yeah so that's yeah that's excite that's i think of of that the other day when you say i don't know where 's go to see his father christmas and i now i know
S0443	mm
S0320	but say it all politely say we're gonna have a santa claus
S0320	okay so yeah and that's the last one before christmas which be nice
S0443	be there lot of little ones there or be they nearer to three
S0320	no no they're all about the same baby there yesterday it be
S0443	oh really so it's like a young playgroup
S0320	no not a well they're all toddlers they're all about they're all sort of between a year and two and a half three cos
S0443	yeah
S0320	a couple that be siblings that come so there's a couple of older erm kid that come as well but
S0320	they still like it cos they've get erm lot of tricycles
S0443	mm
S0320	and in the big hall they can just cycle around don't go round and round in circle
S0443	mm
S0320	so there's a few that come with two of them
S0443	mm
S0320	erm but no they're mostly sort of tweeny i think there be maybe eight to nine months yesterday and
S0443	mm
S0320	three and three quarter i think the oldest boy be yesterday
S0443	oh right
S0320	and he come with his little sister who's about the same age as
S0443	mm
S0320	so yeah they're all it's all very very toddler
S0443	oh that's nice
S0320	it be it's really nice actually
S0443	yeah they start school by the time they're four so
S0320	i think it go exactly but i think it's because they've get the tricycles and it's really big they can come a little bite later and they don't get really bore and annoy like perhaps with other toddler group
S0443	mm
S0320	i think the tricycles and the scooters be a bite hit with the older ones
S0443	yeah well they always use to have that when it be outdoors at
S0320	mm apparently there's another one suppose to be start in i don't know if it's with the same people
S0443	mm
S0320	yeah they use to have one in so this be all offshoots of the playgroup
S0443	mm
S0320	erm and apparently someone's start one in but i don't know the same one
S0443	it's quite a long way to drive though it's nice just to walk to the
S0320	yeah exactly
S0443	mm
S0320	yeah
S0443	er
S0320	and he's go to playgroup with today so i don't think he need three playgroups in a week
S0443	what in the library
S0320	no in the church
S0443	oh the methodist church
S0320	yeah a few people come up to me yesterday and say oh i recognise your little boy i saw him
S0320	mm
S0320	do you
S0320	it's funny it's very big quite a lot with people go oh i've see
S0443	yeah say oh they all be
S0443	mm
S0443	i say
S0320	mm
S0443	she wasn't very baby focus be she
S0320	yes and no
S0443	oh right
S0320	all she want to talk about be her grandchildren but she wasn't really interest in in actually talk to
S0443	exactly
S0320	yeah but i wonder if she's forget i don't know maybe wasn't like
S0443	no i think that she's get itis
S0320	she er she manage to carry on a conversation when be clearly like
S0443	i know
S0320	shout and run around and yeah
S0443	i know it's very odd
S0320	i felt a bite rude to everyone after me leave but i be like yeah we have really get to go
S0443	yeah well she should understand
S0320	yeah
S0443	yeah
S0320	yeah
S0443	no she everything you say she just relate to herself
S0320	yeah
S0443	she be very isolate i think so and i say oh you know start a new career well i should start a new career not oh great how's it go it's
S0443	she be very self absorb
S0320	mm
S0443	i think it's cos er she doesn't get out enough
S0320	maybe
S0443	naturally gregarious
S0320	yeah definitely
S0443	but everything she say be just incredibly competitive and out of date and
S0320	yeah shame
S0443	i get very bore
S0320	you only saw her for ten minutes
S0320	and half of that you be with
S0443	well when she start talk about i think oh like about
S0320	mm
S0443	i'm not bother
S0320	mm
S0443	all i be say be it's go well he's get a sport car
S0320	mm erm yeah
S0443	i ask if he want any dr hauschka moisturiser for christmas
S0320	
S0443	yeah
S0320	why what why would he
S0320	why would he want that he's get bad skin
S0443	well
S0320	well he's always get bad skin actually
S0443	every man should use moisturiser i've be campaign for it for years
S0320	have it work yet
S0443	no
S0443	and he say well he do use them sometimes but usually give them to him
S0320	oh
S0443	for christmas and you can imagine actually would
S0320	mm
S0443	so she'll get like nivea men or something
S0320	mm
S0443	so he say he do use them cos i mean the the statistics for men
S0320	mm
S0443	it's like they've go up you know hundreds several like hundreds of of percentages
S0320	the number of men that use moisturiser
S0443	the sales the sales of men male
S0320	yeah
S0443	skin product facial skin products
S0320	not very consistent though i've find so have some and use it but he's not very consistent so dr hauschka cos it's all so fresh run out quite quickly
S0443	oh right
S0320	so
S0443	what like cream
S0320	yeah so if you don't use it quickly enough it kind of go off because it's all much fresher so probably nivea and all the chemicals be probably much better cos they last a lot longer
S0443	the only guy i've find that use dr hauschka be 's brother
S0320	yeah
S0443	who be on stage worldwide
S0320	yeah
S0320	he's get much more of a reason to
S0443	i hear he look after himself he start his morning by do his pilates and
S0443	moisturise his face with dr hauschka
S0320	mm
S0443	he also have money but i mean he's
S0320	mm
S0443	appear on stage and he's under light and everything else
S0320	yeah
S0443	but but i think we look in superdrugs and see if they've get any nivea men
S0320	yeah yeah nivea or l'oréal's quite a good one as well it's really men they advertise it as men
S0443	oh right but i think
S0320	it's all like against all of the elements and blah blah blah have have a l'oréal one before actually and now he's get a nivea one again i get it for him last christmas and it's he's only use half of it if that
S0443	oh you use it then
S0320	it take a good like year or two take about two years to use it
S0443	we usually just need it in the winter i'm just think i need to get some moisturise oil
S0320	tend to have it more in the summer actually
S0443	oh really
S0320	i think so i've notice i haven't notice he's this one cos it's probably cos he's in the water all the time
S0443	what like a seal
S0320	yeah he doesn't need his face hydrate at the moment cos he's just always in the water
S0443	or an otter
S0320	he's in the water every day
S0443	it's not hydrate it's protection against the cold elements and the wind bad for your skin
S0320	he's alright at the moment actually i'm quite surprise i don't maybe he's use it i dunno
S0443	mm
S0320	but his face be alright at the moment
S0443	mm
S0320	and that's be in the river every single day he's always do it at the moment
S0443	oh right there's obviously something in the river that's good for the skin then
S0320	i doubt it
S0320	mm
S0443	well it keep it hydrate that's for sure
S0320	mm and neither of us will need it when we go to cos it's so humid you don't need it
S0443	what you go to use for have you get all your skincare products from the summer
S0320	er what sun cream
S0443	yeah
S0320	get some yeah i've get i'll probably take another one they've get some on sale in erm in er co op at the moment so i might buy
S0443	oh guess what i saw in the co ops chemist
S0320	no one's gonna be buy at this time of year
S0443	yeah there's more things come on sale this time of year
S0320	well they've just get a big old like not not on sale but it's like a
S0443	display case
S0320	reduce
S0443	oh okay
S0320	no it's just it's not on display it's just a reduce box where you get like
S0443	oh right
S0320	candle and all sort of odd things
S0443	oh okay
S0320	and cheap champagne sometimes and it's in there so erm i'll go and get them i don't think anyone else have buy any since i've notice it so i think i'll go and get some
S0443	yeah it might have erm short use by date on it
S0320	i don't yeah it doesn't really matter erm so yeah no i'll probably wait i dunno we'll see and i speak to the guy in boot about erm anti mosquito stuff and he check on his computer and it be really one one woman and this little bloke come over who must be like in his mid twenties seem to be the pharmacist so like oh so where be you go then oh oh oh oh south america oh well you'll need this he clearly have either be travel or really want to go travel so he be a bite of an expert and he say well you can get this one this one or this one and it's fine for six month and blah blah blah blah blah so erm i might go and order some anti mosquito stuff from him actually cos there's a boot one that's get quite a high deep percentage but be fine for kid over six months
S0443	oh okay that sound good
S0320	cos i normally get the jungle fever which be the my favourite for me but
S0443	yes get a lot of it mm
S0320	but i doesn't say you can use it for kid under six years i think he reckon it be just to do with the test so the boot one have obviously test it on not test it on kid they've obviously test it and say it's suitable for kid whereas i think the jungle formula people probably haven't so yeah
S0443	oh okay
S0320	that's what he reckon
S0443	right sound quite knowledgeable
S0320	yeah as i say i think he be an aspire or previous backpacker cos i just ask the girl vaguely and he come over with his
S0443	yeah
S0320	his tablet and go blah blah blah blah blah blah blah i be like oh okay
S0443	that be good that's good you need that and get some of that avon skin so soft
S0320	yes i will do there's
S0320	quite a lot of different it's quite confuse though there's quite a lot of different skin so soft products not just one there's like cream and spray and blah blah blah blah blah but yeah i'm sure i'll work it out
S0443	whichever one you'll use
S0320	yeah
S0443	mm
S0320	's mum say that she's get air condition so they that they don't get she doesn't get mosquitoes in the house
S0443	mm no
S0443	and one can get those little electric plug ins which we've probably get
S0320	yeah i'm not sure about those i never use them before
S0320	they never seem to work
S0443	no they don't but nothing work properly
S0320	mm probably need it nice for the beach actually
S0443	mm
S0320	but then when i go to the beach on my own quite excite about
S0443	if if you're lucky
S0320	i'll just have
S0443	if you're lucky too early
S0320	tough luck
S0443	if you're lucky if you're lucky
S0320	ha
S0443	isn't it the next weekend
S0320	it's not her birthday the next weekend
S0443	you won't make it
S0320	i think i'll make it for a little while i don't think i'll make it for two nights
S0443	oh god's sake be sensible
S0320	i be be sensible
S0443	no no in term of you haven't be to the country for how many years
S0320	yeah
S0443	how many years
S0320	six
S0443	right and
S0320	and
S0443	you're go straight on the bus to on your own
S0320	no not until the friday and saturday we arrive on monday
S0443	and you oh okay
S0320	we arrive on monday and this isn't until friday she's book the place for two nights but i keep i've tell her that i'm quite bite worry that it might not work out blah blah blah blah blah so she's get it for yeah we'll see how it go so it will either be the friday or maybe just even the saturday that i go
S0443	how long's the coach journey
S0320	i think it's only about three hours now actually not very far
S0443	oh right
S0320	i'm i'm not take and i'm not take so the odds of me go be dramatically increase
S0443	i don't think i don't think the queen would let you anyway
S0320	also i just write to my i message my friend who's just get marry in ecuador and be over there with her six month old little girl and i be ask her about how she get around and what she do who say they'd hire a car for part of it with a car sea actually they probably take their car seat with them and that erm be a be not a good place to go with kid
S0443	oh okay
S0320	it be still fun but not the same and really difficult for kid so
S0443	so erm car seat aren't actually legal in ecuador
S0320	what do you mean
S0443	i mean here you have to have a car seat
S0320	probably not no
S0443	no
S0320	but i'm on it i've ask and i've ask 's mum and they say they're gonna try and find one but then if we haven't get a car no one's drive
S0443	but 's get a car hasn't she
S0320	yeah she doesn't drive though but she always
S0320	well i be ask her and she say she take taxis and she doesn't take the car seat cos it be just too much stuff so she'll take the buggy when she go out with just her and
S0443	mm
S0320	her the little boy she take the buggy and stuff and he just sit in the taxi with her which be the same here i think black cab you don't have to have a car seat anyway
S0443	anyway
S0320	's cousin's get a car so we might end up either a convince him to let us borrow it or b convince him to drive us to
S0443	okay but you can't borrow it cos neither of you drive i think
S0320	no
S0443	that's why take his drive test so early because of
S0320	mm
S0443	's promise that if you get your test you can borrow his car
S0320	yeah but you know
S0443	i'm sure that's why he take it before
S0320	mm oh say we'd put them on his on their drive on their insurance
S0443	which half
S0320	the nice older half so he go canoe he drive they say come on out you get he didn't drive with the trailer but he drive erm i be tell him and tease him and i think they've probably do it now so that it mean that
S0443	wow that's great
S0320	a they've put him on in the insurance and b they've offer to pay for his christmas dinner
S0443	yeah
S0320	with the canoe club i be like haha you're gonna have to drive them all home and he go oh
S0320	i reckon they've probably put him on the insurance so that he can drive them all home and they can have a drink
S0443	no cos they'd still have to be legal one of them would have to be sober cos one person have to be in charge of them so
S0320	oh of course oh yeah
S0443	it's quite funny but no it's not not true oh that's really sweet so he drive up to
S0320	yes and back again
S0443	that's brilliant
S0443	because that's what he need because when he pass his test that's what he'll be do
S0320	exactly exactly i have no idea they'd even offer if i'd have an idea or he he might've tell me but i'd forget i would've say yes certainly not go on my insurance yeah do it
S0443	to do it by himself so it's with you know
S0320	i think it a couple of them say it have buy their insurance down
S0320	which it can do it can bring your insurance down didn't with me but i've hear it do
S0443	that's really sweet
S0320	so yeah yeah so the bloke and someone else and the ladies yeah they probably quite like it that they don't have to drive all the time whenever they go kayak as well
S0443	really no it's not that you still have responsibilities and
S0320	yes but i think it's quite nice for them but anyway yeah so they've all do that
S0443	no i think it's even worse that's very generous of them oh yeah
S0320	i think yeah well it be really nice
S0443	say that's what say he need just to keep drive
S0320	well there we go
S0443	cos it's the awareness of other road users
S0320	yeah
S0443	which
S0320	there we go
S0443	you know cos i think he's get the mechanics
S0320	yeah
S0443	of clutch gear change blah blah and
S0320	yeah
S0443	control of the car
S0320	yeah
S0443	it's the road sense
S0320	yeah that's it
S0443	which be why he's fail twice and
S0320	yeah
S0443	you don't get in till you've get that
S0320	yeah so yeah that's great
S0443	so that's really funny
S0320	yeah i think so
S0443	well gosh he's like their personal mascot isn't he
S0320	but yeah it's their christmas dinner on friday and they're go to again
S0443	oh that's quite i'm go to with the life drum group
S0320	be you
S0443	yeah oh two weeks on thursday it's the our last draw session then we're all go to
S0320	oh nice
S0443	which'll be nice yeah
S0320	yeah it be nice
S0443	and i'm i've work out everyone's er pre order i've get to pre order i'm go to later on to give them a deposit that's next tuesday be come along
S0320	oh cool
S0443	and and everyone say aren't we look forward to it and i think well possibly
S0320	yeah
S0443	so i've i've get everyone's order at from who be the same thing oh in the carol service the week it's on friday a week on friday at seven o'clock at night so it's a bite late really
S0320	i don't think i'll be able to come anyway cos be off to wales
S0443	be he
S0320	well he's go i think it's sunday
S0443	be he drive
S0320	monday i don't think so
S0320	it's for his water endorsement
S0443	well he can't drive on the motorway anyway cos he's a learner driver
S0320	no exactly yeah well that be the other thing i think the canoe club want him to pass his test so he can
S0320	on their new trip up to wales he'll be able to drive some of the way
S0443	well erm 's do load of drive in wales actually
S0320	yeah
S0443	mm
S0320	yeah
S0443	so be water endorsement that's with
S0320	no
S0443	oh right
S0320	he's another bloke who work at yeah
S0443	yeah yeah
S0320	be with and he's book in his erm level three for february
S0443	level three what
S0320	er coach
S0443	mm
S0320	and then i think i've have enough for a while i think he can stop for a bite
S0443	well no then he's get his ml
S0320	yes after that that's it then he i think i might put a ban on any more course until i don't know when
S0443	well it's not put a ban it's that
S0320	i think it's enough cos she know
S0443	it become economically viable you know have get all these qualifications you should be
S0320	yeah exactly
S0443	apart from canoe club who've be incredibly supportive
S0320	yeah
S0443	in his volunteer event
S0320	yeah
S0443	but i mean that's part of if he get another chance to negotiate
S0320	yeah i mention it the other day actually
S0443	he need to decide what he want and go back to
S0320	yeah
S0443	negotiate
S0320	yeah yeah
S0443	they be probably quite surprise that he didn't apply for the
S0320	they be i think that's why they mention it he reckon that's why they they get erm 's boss come and say to him what be you gonna do and he which i be quite impress with quite rightly say if it's not all sort by february i'm gonna go somewhere else because somewhere else will give me a contract for a the season you're not give me anything
S0443	yeah
S0320	so if it's not sort out if i haven't february then i'm gonna go somewhere else
S0443	therefore he need to go back with what he would like negotiate
S0320	yes but also they also come out and say just hang on a bite more we're gonna have another contract and this time
S0443	yeah
S0320	that he'll need to i don't i don't think he'll get what he want because it he want because it's an institution it's not
S0443	don't worry about it i mean just er keep keep it keep it live keep it roll but
S0320	yeah
S0443	he would have all these qualifications and then i should imagine in september he'll want to be
S0320	yeah
S0443	internal
S0320	yeah
S0443	work
S0320	which be fine yeah
S0443	so the ml be the next big one er but he won't necessarily get it first time anyway
S0320	yeah
S0443	but certainly with the water sport the amount of
S0320	mm
S0443	experience how he can actually do it i tell him not to apply last year
S0320	yeah
S0443	well he didn't have his drive lessons last year and so he automatically couldn't've
S0320	well he this year yeah yeah well this year he didn't
S0443	have get the mm
S0320	and they be surprise
S0443	mm
S0320	that he didn't because quite a few others do the weird rugby guy that make honey i don't think he's weird
S0443	oh yeah yeah
S0320	but i just think it be all a bite weird
S0443	yeah yeah
S0320	the ex professional rugby player who make honey who's also a rave christian erm apply but then withdraw cos he didn't think that he be gonna get it erm but none of them have get any of the level three qualification that they're ask for
S0320	no no one's get it
S0443	no it's the it's
S0320	they've get drive license which i think be gonna be probably a bump to level three to be honest cos they want people to be able to drive the bus that's one of their big things
S0443	you can drive the bus but people can when you get there
S0320	yeah exactly
S0320	anyway so
S0320	so none of them as far as i know none of them get the qualifications
S0443	no no it's quite rare
S0320	and it's also
S0443	to do level three
S0320	also with the college work with the students people apply and no one's get the right qualifications
S0443	mm the level three be quite rare because it's such a new thing that
S0320	yeah
S0443	we've get coach like
S0320	mm
S0443	who be actually do level three isn't he
S0320	yeah
S0443	but they've be at it since the year dot but it's because the bcu's change the entire system
S0320	yeah yeah
S0443	erm
S0320	well i would imagine they'd accept level three equivalent because all of them have
S0443	no
S0320	get equivalents
S0443	no there be only level three that's
S0320	oh
S0443	what i'm say
S0320	oh right okay
S0443	it's a completely different system
S0320	mm
S0443	it's like it's like baccalaureate and a level
S0320	yeah
S0443	and so you can say well i haven't get a level but i've get baccalaureate and if people say the industry be now baccalaureate
S0320	yeah
S0443	doesn't matter if you get a level cos they're so out of date
S0320	mm but yeah
S0443	and you can always date someone if they say i've get a
S0320	o level
S0443	yeah
S0320	i know
S0443	they'll think you're really really old
S0320	yeah i know
S0443	what's that you know
S0320	yeah yeah
S0443	young people won't know what their level be
S0320	no i know yeah so
S0443	so it's quite rare this level three and he's get on it you know the second tranche i mean in three years' time it won't be become
S0320	yeah
S0443	industry well it won't be an industry standard that's very difficult to get
S0320	it's very hard yeah
S0443	yeah
S0320	and this he's only gotta go up and do the train in february and it take about two years i think so he's not gonna get the actual he's only gonna have the train from february he's not gonna have the actual level three it's not the assessment it's only the train
S0443	oh really
S0320	oh yeah and he's specialise in sea kayak isn't he or something i don't really know
S0443	yeah go for sea kayak it be base in the south west all families and people that want to go out on the sea water cos water season be only six months of the year and the guy just it become go through the dock like in
S0320	yeah yeah
S0443	but the sea kayak you get a lot of families that want to go out and they
S0320	yeah
S0443	need someone to guide them
S0320	i think he be he's also think of ecuador as well and want to do sea kayak in ecuador
S0320	at some point in the future
S0443	well that come with the the profession so
S0320	yeah
S0443	it's in term of tourism travel it's a better one than white water
S0320	yeah
S0443	white water be quite specialise
S0320	yeah
S0443	and so he's get his four star white water which be nice he need to go
S0320	yeah
S0443	in white water so
S0320	yeah
S0443	it's a pretty impressive portfolio but some time before christmas he need to kind of erm you and he you can be need to bring up to date what his qualifications be take them to college and he can say
