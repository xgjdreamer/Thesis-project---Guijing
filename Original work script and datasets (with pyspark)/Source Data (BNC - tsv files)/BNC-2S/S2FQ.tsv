S0261	we've just be spend time talk with er about things
S0262	to do with social storytelling and how to teach someone how to problem solve do we do this in a traditional way or do we do this in an experimental way and i suggest that we do it in an experimental way because that will get us to become more creative and i think that some of the suggestions that er make could be worthwhile discuss in say put into the good pile or put into the not sure about that pile
S0261	okay so one of the key things be about erm ensure that we operate within a certain niche
S0262	mm mm
S0261	er however that might be form and you can operate in a variety of niches er but you need to find a target audience that be focus enough and interest enough such that you can reach them effectively and that's kind of the context of the way the web work right so if you keep it general then you'll be predominantly use general term to be able to cover everything and so you will pick up a whole variety of people but not necessarily be anybody who be focus enough or interest enough on any range of topics to be able to buy what you be into if you focus it on a particular group then and become relative experts in that by bring together others in that group that the others can learn from then that carry a lot more power and er and therefore you can create a community that have more focus and and by default people who will purchase products because they be intrinsically interest in that particular topic
S0262	yeah that will require a bite of market research
S0261	well you could certainly pick anything and you can go i be go to run through this process with the same erm and there's so many different things that you could do so many different things
S0262	yeah but what what should we start with i mean what's the sort of thing that's go to be the most compel
S0261	erm
S0262	and how much of it have get a kind of teach not teach but an educational kind of slant to it
S0261	what's the education element
S0262	i don't know i don't know whether you bring in as an interviewer whether i'm you know bring in some erm say external read from different author or i be just really keep everything on track just be an interviewer and focus right onto the person whose er who i be interview and just find out about their life story
S0261	you see i've get this this thing about problem solve i don't i'm not convince that's what it's about i don't think that's the the end of what the story tell journey be about i don't think it be about demonstrate how to problem solve i think it's more about try to bring together a community in an alternative way which be through the storytelling mechanism and highlight how to bring people together to connect effectively and by default they end up solve the problem in order to make progress so the problem be kind of build into that process that it be part of the story line to to demonstrate the mechanism
S0262	mm so how do you get people's attention to come in and talk about something to begin with
S0261	okay let's just for example say talk let's say car mechanics okay just for the sake of it and you've get erm johnny who's just leave school and he want to be a car mechanic and he's get an interest and he's be do some stuff himself and he have a problem and really what be really what it be about be more not solve a problem about how to fix a car but it be how can he get connect enough such that he can do something that he really want to do yeah
S0262	mm mm
S0261	and too often what happen be you know there's all this formal bullshit hr i need a good person i need to apply for a job a thousand ways use shitty cv interview approach with some a lot of people don't know how to interview and i be not give the opportunity to demonstrate myself or to show how valuable i can be to these people right and you will get people on all sort of different level but the reality be be that there be a comparative level and connection which go together with personality and it go together with skill base yeah
S0262	yeah but i don't want it to become just about find a job for example
S0261	no no no i be not i be just all i've i be not talk about find a job all i'm do be use that as an example that that this person want to go forward in some context in this case i say he want to jump forward in do what he be passionate about
S0262	yeah
S0261	which be car mechanics
S0262	yeah no i get that so it be more like
S0261	he could he could go down
S0262	goal
S0261	the race track
S0262	let me speak it be all about set goals and achieve goals in a sort of realistic way erm that's something another way of frame what you be say be that you know you want to be closer to your goal whatever it be that you have set
S0261	yeah you could say that you could say that mm mm
S0262	the only reason why i kind of i know what you mean but i know the word the word problem be a problem
S0261	mm
S0262	but solve isn't solve like a riddle or solve a situation whatever isn't a problem i think solve things find ways to solve things be very useful for people it be very very practical
S0261	so it's it's crowd solve
S0262	yeah
S0261	now we find a a synonym for solve yeah
S0262	yeah crowd solve yeah
S0261	something like that yeah and you know what i see as important be the collaborative nature of it
S0262	yeah that's really big and he look like that
S0261	mm
S0262	like that and he think that it be in its form
S0261	mm
S0262	how to really collaborate
S0261	effectively to do something efficiently
S0262	mm
S0261	so what you be try to demonstrate be er as an outcome of this thing be over a very short period of time you be demonstrate comparative er progress that it be significant progress
S0262	yeah
S0261	that's that's what you be show people if if you if you come and see us we will show you we will provide you a mechanism through storylines that will get you from a to e in one week that will be so much faster than if you try to do it yourself and the collaborative element isn't what we be show in the in the stream of er connection to connection it be the input that come in from outside that may steer that storyline
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah which we kind of indicate up on the board the other day about how you really need this other input
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that get the community involve in you know and you would have see examples of that on telly i think with with program and stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	where either the storyline be define by some outside source or the like of big brother where people vote on who survive and who doesn't
S0262	yeah
S0261	or whatever yeah but it be not as crass as that
S0262	no
S0261	it be not crass in any sense
S0262	no it be mean to be educational
S0261	it be suppose to be educational and and if people don't get the sense of i have the opportunity to go forward by miles by be involve in this that's what the catch be for people
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and if we can demonstrate to people erm we can help you be connect in such a way use this creative process that will be very different from what your traditional path would be so that's where you be carve out your own real niche because you're you be use the creative process which everybody be crack on about
S0262	mm
S0261	but you be actually demonstrate how effective they can be in a very short period of time
S0262	well this be go to fascinate me on what niche we're we're gonna settle on because we kind of know our demographic we kind of know what our method be go to be we know what the experiment's aim be we just don't know yet what the topic be now next week next wednesday there's a debate be put on by university it be down in the city it start at five thirty finish at eight and you can register for it if you're be interest it be about face to face versus to online and it be pretty much a debate really about you know which be best i suppose erm there's a couple of professors there's gonna be erm a erm a sort of journo type down there there's go to be erm the person who head up which i think be a depression
S0261	it be a depression site yeah
S0262	yeah so you've get a couple of academics throw in it's a free event and i think mm it just it would be interest to watch a debate you know about something that's involve young people you know as well and see what sort of parameters there be within the debate what sort of things be they pick up on what sort of you know what be the main arguments in this debate
S0261	so do you think they be go to pick up on thread like erm er the people be become more disconnect and hence more depress and et cetera et cetera well because what we've be talk about
S0262	yeah
S0261	and what i believe in be that it need to be balance
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so if if you can pin this together in such a way that there be a real community that's meet
S0262	yeah
S0261	and like some other model that be work around the world at the moment you can set up satellite communities in different place around the world which be do exactly the same model as you you be that the input can be international but the local community base be of the local ilk
S0262	mm
S0261	and that can have representatives who come from other place who join there and so they become part of a like community
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	erm we we need to look at it in two ways we need to look at it in the context of if we have a focus niche what be the lifespan of that focus niche where do it go how long can the storylines be erm i like the context of the start up thread because erm quite often in that case well you've pick a niche yeah it be just that there's massive variety within the niche yeah so the people who be of a certain ilk who will be interest in how that go together erm if you look at like as an example a lot of the topics that be talk on there be a whole range of different topics
S0262	that's true it be just that it be about start up
S0262	and they all they all fell under that
S0262	entrepreneurial
S0261	thing yeah
S0262	so start up now what's a definition of a start up
S0261	erm there's actually a proper definition of it erm a lot of people think it's just kind of start up a company but erm there be a formal definition of it let me just find out erm i need that that be the most pizzery burp in the world
S0262	oh you didn't need to say that on on the sound record
S0261	i just say the most pizzery burp how burpy pizzery it be so i be just look up the definition of start up because ask me and i don't actually know the proper definition so we be go to find out off erm i don't want to go google ads start up just wait for google start company wiki a start up company or start up be a company a partnership a temporary organisation design to search for repeatable and scalable business model these company generally newly create be in a phase of development and research for market there you go start up usually utilise a casual a casual attitude in some respect to promote efficiency in the workplace which be need in order to get their business off the grind nineteen in a nineteen sixty study douglas mcgregor stress that punishments and reward for uniformity in the workplace be not necessary as some people be bear with motivation to work without incentives this removal of stress allow the workers and researchers to focus less on the work environment around them and more at the at the task at hand give them the potential to achieve something great for the company so the point about the start up be er repeatable and scalable business model that's the the core part of the definition erm so be talk to us on that context start up be it scalable yeah and scalable be an element of well to what degree for how long for how large massive
S0262	actually you know what
S0261	can it continue to grow
S0262	he's kind of get a point because the more i'm think about it the more i like it because even the latest research from academics that would be put into a curriculum won't be nearly as up to date oh no no current as some of the things that we would discuss
S0261	yeah it be already behind the time
S0262	but it mean
S0261	anything that's publish be like that
S0262	yeah
S0261	because it take time to be able to publish it
S0262	well yeah but nowadays we can have quite a lot of you know immediate publish you know in term of news
S0261	yeah but once it be publish it be old news
S0262	yeah i'm talk about curriculum in universities
S0261	okay so carry on what be it that you like
S0262	it's it's it's it's current
S0261	what be it that you like you say that we're talk about and scalable and then you say oh and this er the more i think about it the more i like you like what
S0262	okay that erm if you be a student study business and you want to know about start up you take a unit in start up that unit would be a year out of date only because i know how long it take to get a a unit into curriculum
S0261	mm
S0262	and validate
S0261	yeah
S0262	and accredit
S0261	so it be quite potentially it's it's it's possible that the the data that you teach be just out of date right and the idea though be that a university system should be flexible enough to allow people to to look at the coalface and look at what be up to date
S0262	they be mean to have their lecturer do that for them by bring in their own research and their research inform their teach but it doesn't happen that way people say it happen like that but it doesn't
S0261	right okay alright so what be it that you like you like that
S0262	that if you be a student
S0261	yes
S0262	and you want to learn about start up you ain't get your need satisfy at university unless you're incredibly lucky
S0261	yeah
S0262	so if you be young you be think about make a start up
S0261	mm
S0262	you think maybe i should go to university and study this oh no crap i be not go to study this at university i be go to find another way and this be a complementary way of look at things
S0261	yeah okay erm i be definitely for the case of be in a place where now we talk about a variety of different things but be in a place where we be sit in the market where people who would who would or have go to university be go to fall out of that and be interest in look at something else
S0262	in fact i can think of of already three people i could interview and
S0261	yeah mm mm and the good thing with with with probably all of them be that they have a connection they have probably if you get them to distribute what they be talk about effectively and you somehow attach a product to it that by word of mouth you can get stuff out there fairly quickly
S0262	mm
S0261	and erm that's what intrigue me so much about this lot who have do this thing yeah because they talk he talk through his mechanism of how they get their voice out there about this stuff between them they send an email out to eight hundred friends yeah and they send out this email that say erm here guy a fifty percent discount voucher you can operate our site do this and you will get fifty percent off so the email go out to eight hundred people and they could through analytics find out that three thousand two hundred people look at that yeah they get erm quite a large number of people buy stuff off this site and this be their first very first kind of get go erm and through that their story get into the press because they be enough of of a different model and they be the it be call and so somebody bother to write about who they be and then go on to how they go to expand the company and they use some fairly straightforward techniques but they come across as quite clever erm to get massive exposure yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	erm they simply come across a youtube video of sixteen year olds who be teach each other how to put on makeup and so they contact a girl in the us who be teach this to other students and make money out of it
S0262	mm mm
S0261	and they say we would like to use you to promote our products we have get custom design your own shoe and they end up have to pay her money because she have a hollywood agent and so on and so on they pay her some money she do it in the time to build up to that time through their however long they have be run they have have two hundred thousand visitors to the site through other press stuff on this particular day with this one person on youtube do a promotional video for their product one day they have two hundred thousand people look at their website
S0262	wow
S0261	right of those two hundred thousand people ninety five thousand of them leave comment of postiveness on their product
S0262	wow
S0261	on that site on that day and what they find out be quite odd they think at the time the majority of people who be contact them directly weren't actually people who have the money to buy the shoe they be thirteen year olds so there be people who be look up to the sixteen year old who be her natural market
S0262	mm
S0261	and so they have that problem and so they send out another another way of do it and after three weeks they actually get to their target market which be er business women yeah who would be pay two hundred buck for a pair of shoe but they still get a massive uplift in sales
S0262	yeah
S0261	so that just show through use a different mechanism how and and there's nothing complicate about what they've do they've just use a certain different approach they have manage to get a massive voice out there for what they have do
S0262	they have yeah without much of a market budget by the sound of things
S0261	well they've just use things to they've use the collaborative nature of the crowd
S0262	mm
S0261	to to create a viral story
S0262	mm
S0261	and the reason why it be be because there be enough they're of enough
S0262	mm
S0261	they they have a different enough idea that it be disruptive to an exist industry
S0262	well i would say our idea be probably quite disruptive
S0261	so it be easy enough to sit here and think through the nature of the the process of somebody say what be it that you really want to do what's different that you would like to try and progress with
S0262	mm
S0261	and what be it that's hold you up at the moment what's your hurdle yeah so you would go through that you would discover what the hurdle be and you know a lot of things be simply just you need to go and do it more than anything
S0262	yeah you do but i think you know you've get to talk to the right people and suss out your ideas a bite more as well because like honestly it hadn't occur to me until today and it obviously have to you but you hadn't discuss it with me
S0261	mm
S0262	that it be go to be on a certain kind of niche i hadn't get get that from what we put up on the board those problems be three very very different type of problems
S0261	mm
S0262	they be you know not really relate to each other
S0261	mm mm
S0262	so from what we put on the board i be run with this very general kind of sense of things
S0261	and that's fine as long as you block all of those things under the guise of they're all students
S0262	yeah but i think you will get
S0261	well they be all problems that students could learn
S0262	the topic i think i understand though the question be one thing but the topic be another and it be true like what do be he say the topic be about entrepreneurs
S0261	mm
S0262	that's the topic
S0261	mm
S0262	the question i ask
S0261	mm
S0262	be just question i ask but the topic be entrepreneurs so i can't really say the topic be university students i would prefer to have something that's get a little bite more bite to it than that
S0261	the topic be education
S0262	yeah the topic be education
S0261	topic be learn topic be self learn topic be self direct learn topic be
S0262	alright i know i know what you be say i be just say thattopic like entrepreneurs be you know er big enough but small enough for it to be meaningful to people so people be i'm interest in entrepreneurs but it's quite a big it be quite a big area but actually it's big enough to break it up into small chunk
S0261	yeah
S0262	which be what 's do and i quite like this idea of the start up because it be big enough to break it up into small chunk
S0261	part of the problem i have with it be that we be not in that space
S0262	well what about if we put
S0261	we don't have we don't have we don't intrinsically have a track record that be enough to speak with authority
S0262	yeah but also say that he would interview people so that he could he could learn from them
S0261	yeah but what you didn't know until today be be that before he get into that he have build a forty million dollar company when he be twenty three
S0262	alright but what i be interest in be the topic that it be the mix of the people so it's start up for graduate or something start up for you know university students and graduate something like that so it be attach to the idea that we be look at a much much younger demographic and maybe people who get involve in start up be in their early twenties
S0261	oh they be you look around at a lot of the stories i'm listen to they're all twenties they're in their twenties
S0262	well then start up be great because it's around the demographic we're interest in
S0261	it be in the demographic where things do really kind of happen
S0262	yeah so we could you know interview the the people from the shoe
S0261	i i'm quite attract to their thing erm i the reason why first they be in so you can connect them intrinsically with the community that they do appear to be outgo because the guy run his own blog talk about how they be go about build their own company
S0262	mm
S0261	and that he be now quite connect with er investors various different place yeah erm and he's probably a good they're probably good model for for for for erm young mentor for younger start up people
S0262	mm mm
S0261	erm that they're still learn but they're a few step ahead of where other people be go
S0262	mm
S0261	so they be not miles ahead they be not angel investors they be not they be not old geezers they be not you know all of that you know erm and so yeah why not you can see them as be the people at the end and what you want to do be try to connect somebody at the start with those people
S0262	yeah but it's fudge it
S0261	well
S0262	that's a really weird way of do things
S0261	do it backwards
S0262	no i mean the people in start up people they could just be like the tuesday or the wednesday or the thursday they be just people who be around to be interview that's where we be do things differently be we be make a thread we be actually make a thread of conversations that have be have discuss and we're just basically tell it in a story format
S0261	yeah okay i can run with that erm i haven't look around the net erm at start up type there must be oh there be heap and heap of group for entrepreneurs and start up yeah erm in and when i start look at it probably two of them stand out and that's because they be international group yeah so they're start up crunch or something like that or whatever erm grind start up grind and there's another one erm like the big think and they have the the highly populate things yeah you're tire
S0262	yeah i be tire actually
S0261	i know
S0262	i be think how nice it would be to be tuck up in bed with a nice little cup of something hot
S0261	mull wine
S0262	no not like a mull wine i be think perhaps something more like a peppermint tea or
S0261	oh
S0262	mm
S0261	but you get the point erm these communities er er be quite disparate there be several group
S0262	mm
S0261	people go to different group erm talk to a couple of people last week they kind of go along to these things and say that sometimes they be a bite hit and miss
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you will get an element of people who go there just to be listeners
S0262	yeah
S0261	and they say they be go to do something but they be not doers and then you have get the real people who be doers who go there to network to find people to partner with yeah er you've get the sniffers you've get the er you've you've probably get the investors as well yeah
S0262	well that's alright that's a network session i don't mind that it be not a learn session though
S0261	no but my point be if you join all that together as you're pick these people out of these group within the group the people know the people right so that's your niche that's your crowd
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	and and then they can see well erm naturally these people get together and do this kind of network solve problem stuff anyway
S0262	yeah
S0261	it be just that it be all kind of keep together nobody be learn from it it be just their little bubble
S0262	yeah that's true
S0261	and that's why they think it be all special because i'm all part of the team
S0262	yeah
S0261	and everybody else be out there you know
S0262	yeah
S0261	but
S0262	it's a bite silly
S0261	but we be move into a society where everybody be expect to be more open and transparent
S0262	yeah
S0261	and with the way that information be spread anyway you can find out a hell of a lot without have a talk to these people in the first place
S0262	yeah
S0261	so so what they can learn to help others along as they be do it be very valuable
S0262	yeah
S0261	and the start up and tech community in be start to flourish yeah but these guy on the shoe thing be say that four years ago it hardly exist yeah they have to work it out all themselves
S0262	it be interest what be say about he see the youth in be the younger ones be a they're go to be a big part to play soon in if not already maybe he need people who be young enough to you know want to start up start up company and
S0261	yeah well that's the way it be kind of work around the around the world erm and i bet that the people who be go forward here now have be watch what's be go on in the us for a long time yeah they simply appear to be ahead of the game here now because they've be transport model from america that have be cover five years ago yeah that's how long it have take it have take five years for the ideas there to come here
S0262	bugger
S0261	that's what i be see
S0262	well yeah i mean you know fair enough erm
S0261	it doesn't mean to say that you can't do anything it's just that
S0262	i like it i like it as a topic i think it's it's it's a good way to at least run with something to start with i think we need to define what we be go to run with
S0261	mm
S0262	and i like it because i can see i could you know
S0261	the potential be you're go to get a lot more positive stories out of it because of the nature of it be a start up
S0262	yeah
S0261	people will have an interest and try and make something go forward with progress
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm yeah i think it could be quite good because even though what you be say be that it be not necessarily i'm come to you and with a problem and i need people to crowd to solve it together it could be i be come here with an experience which i would like to further by share my story and people can add to my story by the very nature that they be social that they be social be and that they will have input to what i be say at some point
S0261	i mean the nice idea for these people to become connect through it maybe simply the storyline be connect that way so somebody a tell their story somebody b can tack onto that story because they've get the experience that go beyond that and so on and so on
S0262	i think i be go to have to call it there tonight
S0261	okay that's there what's the time
S0262	i don't have the time lady
S0261	the time old lady be quarter to nine
