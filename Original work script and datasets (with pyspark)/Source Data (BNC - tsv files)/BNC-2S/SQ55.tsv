S0055	right so we've get the kid play raucous kid there be rowdy and that be also more prominent
S0139	in comparison to a more remote location tut and then the other one be oh right other locations be much quieter there's a path alongside however it be not the most use artificial lightning lightning
S0139	er
S0139	artificial light could also affect the number of species present
S0055	yeah so um
S0139	what be be we so we're er concentrate on the amount of species and the type of species in the
S0055	be we gonna
S0139	would that not mean that we'd need we should've use a quadrat
S0055	well not if we do it as fauna as against flora
S0139	right
S0055	cos if we be to do it like that then we'd get away with it do you think
S0139	yeah er yeah
S0055	yeah right
S0139	just whatever cos i i think sorry i've sort of mess this up we should've um we could just
S0139	basically we just need to write what we should've do
S0055	yeah okay
S0139	and then just say we've do it
S0055	so we need to read around these areas and develop ideas to test the field be ideas to test in the field be a key skill of enquiry do you even understand that
S0139	i don't understand what that mean
S0055	be it like we're suppose to work out
S0139	read around these concepts and to test in the field
S0055	um
S0139	so be we so then then suppose to look at because we have propose that we're gonna do it on um the amount of species and er noise pollution effect er of species present
S0055	yeah
S0139	be we suppose to then read around any research to show if noise pollution affect the amount of species
S0055	yeah i think the on like well yeah didn't you say like read round
S0139	yeah but do then that mean that um we need to go away and research it
S0139	be there gonna be research on it
S0055	i don't think there gonna i don't think there gonna be anything on that
S0139	then we can be like pioneer
S0139	there you go sir we do it
S0139	this be a brand new bite of research for you right there
S0055	um
S0139	it's too it's too broad

S0139	because to be fair even er
S0055	it's the kit that's gonna cost a lot of
S0139	if she be if she be charge about twelve pound on for team train and then a tenner for rid on a wednesday it's as much as you'd pay for a rid lesson anyway
S0055	yeah
S0139	so i'd still do it
S0055	but i know that people like lizzie complain a lot about money like um
S0139	yeah
S0055	she's always like i can't do cos i don't have they don't work do they

S0139	and then i think they do like nothing over the summer
S0055	and be do their
S0139	i don't know i don't know because she's only just learn how to jump and it kind of scar her you can see and if they're want us to jump a course of ninety centimetres she might feel slightly scar
S0055	yeah
S0139	i don't know if she's do like course and stuff
S0055	it be the first time she'd jump in like six years or something like that
S0139	yeah i um i like jump i find a picture the other day of me jump
S0055	i wanna start i wanna start do it
S0139	well there's no reason why you can't because um we only jump every three weeks at that place low battery again
S0139	how long have we have these
S0139	um but there's no reason why you shouldn't
S0055	mm it's just get them to do like a a thing for people that who be
S0139	look
S0055	oh

S0055	i do
S0139	not even gonna comment on that ames
S0055	i do i like what they wear well just that i'd just feel special
S0139	look this say on here
S0055	mm
S0139	cos er that that's um him obviously with some star round it and he's get his match bandage and
S0055	pretty nice horse that whose be it be it yours
S0139	yeah um
S0055	yeah i want to wear that
S0055	i'm quite happy just to stand at the side wear it
S0139	oo
S0139	i'll make this happen for you it'll become my sole responsibility to ensure that you can
S0055	that i wear show jump stuff
S0139	get dress up like you're jump and be really happy about
S0055	i'd even go on a little trot round
S0055	not jump though
S0139	jump what be they i'm really scar because when it come to team trials and stuff they'll be like jump i'm fine with jump
S0055	what if you what if you forget the like like the the run course you run like
S0139	it's er how you can manage to remember the course well i like pace the course to work out your stride round it um really i don't really do anything other than go oo this one's a bite of a long one and you'd go for and just guess um but it make me feel important
S0055	i like watch show jump you know when like the horse stop and then they just go
S0055	like dead fast
S0139	yeah
S0055	cos there's a wall that's like as big as that and they're just like their hooves just on one
S0139	yeah like
S0055	they they seem to be there from just stand
S0139	yeah
S0055	to straight up
S0139	yeah it's amaze it be really amaze um
S0055	it's even more amaze when they're gonna jump it as well
S0139	yeah i er love it i want to arrange for next year for a trip to horse of the year show for us guy and then maybe stay in for the night
S0055	yeah
S0139	and go out in
S0055	i'm gutted that i can't go holiday in september
S0139	i know
S0055	really want to go
S0139	i think it should be change so we can invite the new people
S0055	and like er not be funny but i would've be one of the people that would've go
S0139	i know
S0055	or
S0139	i think i think personally that maybe it should be change from september to october
S0055	yeah
S0139	and then we can invite the freshers
S0055	yeah then er that's something to say er look do you we're do this at so and so as well
S0139	yeah
S0055	it's like er it's a sell point for the club cos then they'll be like oh i've only be here like a week and they're go on a trip already
S0139	yeah
S0055	for a few days
S0139	oh we're do this it's gonna be ace
S0055	yeah
S0139	whereas at the minute it's not
S0139	i use to be here like every year with my mum but i think
S0139	horse of the year show you get to see some amaze jump we use to go cos um i use to know people who compete
S0055	yeah
S0139	stuff
S0055	do you wear a top hat

S0055	i be gonna say
S0139	mm you're like
S0055	think you be a veggie
S0139	um no i i think i might mention to them and cos at the minute only three people be suppose to be go i can't justify do a trip for three people for the rid holiday
S0055	no i want to go
S0139	because um i'd want you there
S0055	i want to be there
S0139	it'd be really good can you imagine it
S0055	yeah
S0139	just be an actual nightmare oo you'd be rubbish cos they'd be like yeah let's streak and then you'd be like i can't get a cab
S0139	but we get to pick our own room it's not guide so then that's not so much of an issue
S0055	yeah i'd like that
S0139	cos i don't i don't think anyone else'd go maybe might
S0055	how much would it be
S0139	i don't know
S0055	be people gonna be able to afford it at that time of the year
S0139	probably not
S0055	because their loan will have go they'll be look for the next one
S0139	i feel really bad because i be like i wanna go so they've they they change it from the start of september to accommodate me but then
S0055	and now i can't go
S0139	but then that mean um that you can't go
S0055	yeah it's horrible of you ain't it

S0055	yeah but you would go though wouldn't you
S0139	yeah
S0055	i'd er go if i could go
S0139	but i can't like bail on them cos they've change it for me but then they where they be gonna change it to they've change it again for so i don't know i might be like oh i can't do that weekend and try and make them change it again till later
S0055	yeah
S0139	till when you're back but the only problem be we be run into when we be suppose to to be do um freshers stand
S0055	right or they could just do it like when be you back
S0139	i fly back on the second
S0055	of september
S0139	yeah
S0055	oh
S0139	so they want you to do it the next weekend
