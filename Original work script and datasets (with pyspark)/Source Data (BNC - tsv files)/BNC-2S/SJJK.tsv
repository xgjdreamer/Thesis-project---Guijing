S0619	oh hello
S0618	so right so yes anyway talk about erm yeah coffee
S0619	but i think place like this in this part of poland i just get the impression they spend a lot of their money on the design and all this that and the other but no one come either because they don't know it's here mm and i just think eat out in general be not a thing do by people unless they have load and load of money and if you have load and load of money you wouldn't come here and i don't think it's very close to school either so i i imagine it would attract lot of teenagers but i don't know where the nearest school be
S0618	mm mm yeah yeah it be next door to lidl's car park so they might get
S0619	yeah with park facilities definitely
S0618	yeah they might get the
S0619	people wander in
S0618	yeah i mean i would pop in for a coffee when i'm lidling and actually i would be really happy to meet you here if you fancy a coffee i just hope the next one be not in a paper cup that's a little bite disappoint when everything else be so nice and nice fit out nice design nice coffee
S0619	yeah isn't it really nice we could have our own cup
S0618	yeah yeah we could do you could just buy one in lidl
S0619	yeah well i be go to say keep them behind the bar
S0618	a pound's worth of mug just pop it in there it would good
S0619	we could write our name on them
S0618	yeah my friend he live near brisbane in australia he's erm his local coffee shop have his cup there and when he he sit there and pass the time of day with them the morning drink his morning coffee and when he's finish he go round the back and wash it up ready for tomorrow
S0619	that's nice that's nice and put it yeah when i work in we always have cup and we have get to write our name on them because otherwise people you know will start use each other's cup so we start do it with pen permanent pen and it would just wash off you know you just er rub it off with your finger and use the cup so then we do it with nail varnish and that be slightly more effective
S0618	that doesn't last though do it yeah yeah okay oh that's a good hint
S0619	yeah write your name on it in nail varnish
S0618	so nail varnish survive the wash up
S0619	but i would still just use someone else's cup anyway
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't think it matter yes so confession time a strange confession
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	i think i need to tell somebody
S0618	okay that's your catholic upbringing
S0619	but for the last or two or so years i've have this weird addiction to this medication and i've decide to stop take this medication it's not a physical addiction in that there's nothing chemically inside this medication that make you need to take it it's like a psychological addiction to it where if you it's basically to do with like decongestion and nose and it's one of these things where the more you take it when you stop use it the more the symptoms the original symptoms be worse so it get worse and worse and it's be like two years and i imagine it's what it's like if you start take load and load of drug like the inside of your nose be sore it's bleed to the point where it scratch
S0618	mm mm uhu right okay cold relief okay yeah okay yeah you've get that now
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh okay
S0619	and i'm start to think eventually my nose be just go to like fall off
S0618	fall off so you might think okay yeah so you're go to look like you're a a coke head
S0619	yeah a coke addict yeah
S0618	like a big hole in it or something yeah okay
S0619	so you know which be why me and go to buy that sort of nose inside nose washer
S0618	oh you didn't go and get it
S0619	no we do we do
S0618	oh you do okay
S0619	and i'm hop that with a mixture of that and sort of willpower i will be able to break this habit but i be google it i've google it in the past i google it again today and it's like load of people be say i've be addict to this for ten years
S0618	mm yeah oh wow well if people have be addict for ten years presumably their nose haven't fall off
S0619	they be still attach to their face
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i'm just try to break this habit so it's really awful because it mean that i can't breathe through my nose until i learn to breathe again without rely on medication to help me breathe so it's just go to be
S0618	yeah oh no okay the people on this site say how long it's take before their nose get back to normal
S0619	they be say like a few weeks but people be sort of go on it the people who be write on this forum that when they start and i sort of think if they be not write about it sort of weeks later then it must be because it's a positive because you would only write about something if it's negative
S0618	yeah mm yeah if it's yeah if it's a problem yeah
S0619	yeah so i'm hop that in a couple of weeks
S0618	yeah that you will be alright again
S0619	yeah
S0618	that's cool
S0619	so it's rubbish
S0618	in the meantime yeah that saline stuff probably wouldn't hurt and also steam bath stick your head over a bowl of hot water with a towel possibly with some bake soda or salty stuff epsom salt i don't know can you breathe them in
S0619	yeah mm mm yeah yeah yeah yeah we've have salt yeah they have something like really you know like menthol like type things
S0618	well vicks be good but by god it make you blind if you be not careful if you accidentally open your eye when you be breathe it in
S0619	yeah so i'm just i'm hop that sort of fresh air and be distract and i think something like that will help it's worse at night but
S0618	yeah yeah well good for you my god you be a woman on a mission you be really clear out everything that's toxic in your life aren't you it's like tick next
S0619	yeah i know i know and i feel like if i do it all at the same time i'm just go to implode the lot
S0618	yeah booze yeah man yeah nasal stuff yeah
S0619	the inside of my brain
S0618	what's next
S0619	yeah i know
S0618	yeah good for you though just i suppose new year new beginnings it's erm yeah i mean you can recreate yourself at any time
S0619	yeah exactly
S0618	yeah i be listen to last sunday's johnnie walker's sound of the seventies when i be cook this morning and it be really interest the first hour be dedicate to david bowie and there be interview with him sort of talk about invent himself and become the character and things like that which i think be just really interest and quite wonderful and it sound like he get a bite confuse at some time as to whether he really be that character which of course he be if he be act the role then of course he be but i suppose equally it sort of open up for all of us the idea that we can be whoever we want to be and we can perform a role in life that we want to perform be the character we want to be so there's nothing false about it it's just do it
S0619	mm mm yeah mm yeah me and my friend have talk about this before where sort of if you're if you be act for want of a better word erm be it a good thing or a bad thing and will you eventually become that person who you be act as but if you be act as it then it's because you be already that person
S0618	mm yeah yeah you already be yeah it's a bite like people who affect a silly laugh and then after a while that be their laugh it sort of stop become ironic and amuse and just become
S0619	mm yeah your laugh
S0618	your laugh that people then take the piss out of because it's amuse so yeah
S0619	so i don't know
S0618	yeah interest now i think my view be that as human be we're dynamic change evolve there be no this be me it's you know you be as you be in the moment so be who you wanna be man you know
S0619	yeah mm we shall see anyway anyway anyway i'm just a bite at the moment but i'm try to stay i'm positive i be positive about the future but it be just like
S0618	be you positive about now
S0619	i be i be positive about now
S0618	that'll do
S0619	and in term of the future i'm kind of think god do i have to do all of these things all of the time it's so exhaust
S0618	no you don't you just do it now
S0619	yeah just do it now don't think about it
S0618	exactly just do it now yeah
S0619	that's good yes
S0618	yeah the future doesn't really exist anyway so yeah yeah i've be struggle again with not be on alcohol and i'm almost desperate for january to end so i can have some alcohol but it's kind of i'm a bite concern really it's highlight to me that perhaps there's a deeper issue there and i'm start to feel i think i say to you the other day that something change something click in me a few days ago and i feel like a whole different person and that's carry on and i really do i'm get more energy now i'm start to feel really good and i wonder if part of that be detox
S0619	mm mm yeah well yes and what's the date today it's like what the twenty third
S0618	twenty twenty third it's my nephew's birthday
S0619	yeah so it's twenty one days to break a habit
S0618	be it
S0619	possibly or twenty eight
S0619	or a hundred and two i don't know
S0618	oh i mean to send you those
S0619	twenty one days to break a habit i'm sure that's true
S0618	abraham hicks thing on facebook the other day basically say people say it take thirty days twenty eight days twenty one days whatever to break a habit but actually it only take a moment because there's only now so you have break it now erm yeah i be go to send that to you i forget i might have photograph it actually let's see if i can show you that without bollocks up the record let's have a look oh yeah it's still record that's good okay camera roll yeah i do here be look oh no that's not the one okay be it that one no it's not that one no
S0619	he's get a lot of interest things to say
S0618	no no i didn't save it to my phone
S0619	yeah mm yeah well if this twenty one day thing be true then you know you by now we should be feel the positive effect
S0618	yeah but you know i do wonder if i've get about the psychological addiction because it's not really a physical addiction anymore because after a few weeks it's sort of out of my system so it's only psychological addiction i'm think now maybe i need to not drink in february as well but then i think well let's have a really big binge on the first of february but then i would probably be piss on half a shandy so we will see
S0619	yeah yeah yes i use to think or i use to do when i be at uni kind of i wouldn't drink really very much at all for a few weeks or a few months and then have a massive binge and realise why i wasn't drink
S0618	mm yeah but then you can stop again
S0619	it's like a second wind oh yeah there's another month erm i could easily do another month not drink just because i don't think anything good come of it erm
S0618	yeah yeah mm yeah
S0619	because then i'm rely so heavily on some of the negative experience at the end of december i'm just you know you be use them to my advantage which be why i don't want that to happen again i don't want to be that oh yeah i don't want yeah
S0618	mm yeah you don't want to be mm
S0619	well no it's not that i don't want to be that person because that's put it on me and i don't think it's me
S0618	mm well you still have a role to play in any situation
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	so in some form if not in the physical world then at least in some sort of vibrational level you've invite a challenge at some level
S0619	uhu yeah yeah so
S0618	and in a way if you think about how good you be feel now maybe you can i don't know maybe it will take a bite longer but at some point you might be able to look back on december and say oh my god best thing that ever happen
S0619	thank you it change yeah it change something
S0618	yeah yeah that's really cool
S0619	yeah yeah yeah so but it be i think not drink because we've be talk about barriers so much not drink put a huge barrier around you in some ways erm
S0618	mm how much of that be real and how much of that be psychological
S0619	i don't know in term of people don't well certain people especially don't want anything to do with you
S0618	mm you don't get invite to party or
S0619	yeah or yeah at the same time you don't want to go to party sometimes because it will be more miserable or you enjoy yourself you don't want to bring other people down i don't know it's kind of a combination of things
S0618	yeah yeah i really struggle when we go bowl i felt so bore that's why i go home when you all go on to play pool in town but i realise that you know i think that be just where i be at at the time and part of the detox process possibly i'm quite capable of carry a party head on dance the night away and be stone cold sober but in that moment i wasn't so i don't know i do wonder if a big bite of me kind of reach the point where i think no i'm not really into this scene anymore you know at some point somebody always arrive with a tray of shots and that sometimes lead to another tray of shots and there have be time in my life when that's a fantastic thing keep it roll let's go yeah yeah yeah but for the most part i kind of think actually no i don't want to be in that scene yeah it's not such fun i don't know i kind of think drug be better from that viewpoint because you don't have a stink hangover in the morning
S0619	yeah yeah yeah no i don't
S0618	yeah
S0619	i could keep this up for another month just because i've really sort of rid this wave of everything be okay and especially because we be on holiday as well it's sort of help i think it would be rubbish be on holiday and not be able to drink but actually it's be a bite of a godsend in a way because you can do things
S0618	yeah yeah you can get out for a walk you can get to the gym
S0619	yeah your days be so much longer because erm you be not i don't know lie in bed hungover or you've get the energy to get up in the morning
S0618	yeah yeah yeah you can enjoy the daylight enjoy the fresh air go out for a day trip
S0619	yeah and we've do we've do so much i mean i'm not say if we have er if i have be on load of nights out that wouldn't have happen it would have just happen but i would have you know be drink the next day to to keep my spirit up or whatever
S0618	yeah mm yeah and perhaps on a teach week you'd be more likely to be out on a friday night or out on a saturday night or even out on a thursday night so yeah
S0619	yeah yeah so it's nice
S0618	it's kind of take the pressure off thursday friday saturday eve for not be drink nights
S0619	i think today be monday
S0618	because we meet up in the week
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah that's true i need to remember it be saturday for the bus timetable
S0619	i have no idea what's go on at all
S0618	oh shit i've do that before oh that be just after new year when i be back and i walk into town and be wait for this bus back and it be like minus seventeen or something ridiculous and i have be at this bus stop and i think oh thank god only five minutes to the bus and i wait and wait and wait and wait and then i realise fuck it's saturday and it be more than half an hour oh no i'm never ever do that again so i'm quite yeah remember to look what day it be
S0619	oh my god oh yeah
S0618	but no feel good and i keep have these dream last night's dream be wonderful and i quite often dream about build or house and i'm explore them or i'm renovate them and i look on these as part of my psyche or different aspects of self and the dream i'm also have lot of kitten dream i tell you about that
S0619	mm yeah yeah you say yeah
S0618	which i think be sort of my higher self say it's time to have some fun because i associate kitten with fun and lay on the grind and roll around on the floor and play basically so there's i feel like i feel a lot more light hearted than i've felt in a while so i'm feel a bite more kittenish but i think i probably be attract kitten as well so i expect some cat to be arrive soon little cat but yeah so a couple of nights ago i have this dream and i be kind of in this big mansion and at the top of the hallway and it be mine my friend be paint and she have do this purpley turquoise colour which be impossible but it's possible in dreamland and she have paint a bite over the white ceiling oh fuck she's go over the line never mind i will do that again when she's go home when it's dry and then opposite that i be do a turquoisey colour and there be a mirror there and i have friends around all help which be really nice but it just felt really warm homely the mirror be reflect the light and it be great and this one last night i be in this massive mansion again and it be really old fashion with old fashion sofas and things and i go into a room i'd never be in before and open all of the massive dusty curtain and it be a big high ceiling room there be windows all about so i be let light in again so i think this be all quite symbolic and there be a guy on the outside rid his bike and with every sort of second foot it go on the bike so i know he be there and i felt a bite threaten by him but it be almost like well i need to take the risk if i'm to let light in that there might be some nastiness out there but you know i can see it all and it's only my perception that there might be nastiness maybe it will maybe it won't who know and a friend of mine be with me there as well and she's actually a painter and decorator for a live so there's almost that sort of freshen up renovate sort of theme go on again so that's two dream with paint and decorate and renovate light let light in in kind of the darken room of my psyche so bring it on

S0618	okay i hate this polish phone look what eat you up to and then if i want to go back and replace the t in eat with an r for be i mean that's actually do it quite sensibly but sometimes i'm just click at various bits it's because it's cheap plastic shit anyway what be you up to er i'm with in for frig sake look come on i'm yeah that's just annoy anyway i'm with and it's oh i have to put the apostrophe in oh i will have to fault myself it's nearly film o'clock
S0619	yeah it click yes but these poor people they've just be stand around all day
S0618	i know
S0619	well someone be go to get
S0618	i think that must be so difficult when you start a business like that
S0619	yeah and you've just get to wait and you be so excite for customers and you have put all of your life save into it
S0618	yeah i hope they know it's possibly i think they say erm the first year of a business you make a loss the second year you break even and the third year you make a profit and i observe and who be a polish couple who erm move to my arse end of nowhere in northern ireland the bottom of the peninsula village and they have successful restaurant business but the way they do it be they be always open seven days a week so you know if you fancy a coffee or a fry or whatever if you wander down to the shore you know they would be open
S0619	uhu mm yeah they would be open but that's not good it's not good for them be it
S0618	well no i use to say to as well because they use to work seven days a week and use to say well i didn't come over here to have a holiday you think well you know that's some heck of a work ethic and i think that idea be to make shitloads of money and then come back to poland as rich people and not work but i'm too much in my now for that and i just imagine you work your arse off for ten years and then drop down dead and you would be look down on your body go shit i wish i hadn't bother but anyway
S0619	yeah mm i can't do things like that yes but no one have ever say from the deathbed i wish i'd work harder
S0618	i know exactly so
S0619	you know they've go i'd i really i'd wish i'd travel the world or do this or do that i don't know
S0618	yeah so i will just say what time will you be here and say
S0619	hello
S0618	can you please bring your laptop there we be
S0619	very good
S0618	okay do so if we leave that there with the volume up let's see if she's text back yes so you think you might be up for no booze in february i'll join you binge on the first
S0619	no
S0618	you be so good
S0619	you can you go and do whatever you want i just
S0618	well no i don't actually have any good quality alcohol in the house i've get sort of i've get cook whisky that you give me leave over from your party erm
S0619	have all the shit
S0618	i've get this white wine that i've just buy it look like it's russian or slovakian or something there's some interest look character on it and it probably taste really awful erm and what else have i get i've actually get another bottle of wine that's halfway reasonable and i've get a cherry liqueur thing actually i really a fancy a go at that
S0619	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0618	that's only fifteen percent so i might drink that bottle on the first of february throw up a bite get really sick and then decide
S0619	yeah remember why you stop drink
S0618	yeah so i think out of all of the booze that's the one i fancy the most
S0619	why not
S0618	so i might just drink that on the first of february what day be the first of february
S0619	it's a monday
S0618	okay well i haven't get any students on a monday right so breakfast cherry liqueur
S0619	no i i kind of think now all of my friends here in this country you know good friends don't care if i'm drink or sober and the ones who want me to get drink i think if you want me to get drink then that mean that you might not like me as much so why why should i be your friend
S0618	mm uhu i wonder if the ones like you drink be the ones who maybe have alcohol issue themselves and it's probably not so much about you as about them
S0619	yeah yeah that's true that be true yeah if it's because they want to drink
S0618	yeah to no offence but you could be anyone
S0619	yeah true yeah that's true
S0618	yeah
S0619	but we shall see
S0618	yeah
S0619	so yes i feel i'm for it
S0618	i'm think now i might like to sort of support you in you give up your nasal thing as well as something what else can i give up
S0619	this be
S0618	that would be really good to give up
S0619	this be this be the hardest thing this be way harder than give up alcohol or give up chocolate or give up fag or whatever else so this be like because i'm not addict to anything else i'm not addict to alcohol or smoke i just do these things because i enjoy them but this be like addiction because i can't breathe and breathe be very important
S0618	yeah and not be able to breathe yeah mm it be kind of important
S0619	so i just have to breathe through my mouth like a loser
S0618	oh i bet you snore something chronic at the minute
S0619	that's what i mean i kind of don't want to either don't want to go to i'm gonna have to start take this medication for the trip
S0618	yeah oh oh in my junk drawers i find about four pair of ear plug so we will be alright
S0619	i don't mind pay for a separate room because
S0618	you be go to potentially keep everybody awake yeah
S0619	so i just have to work through it
S0618	you've just remind me of this really passive aggressive guy i meet when hostelling around new zealand he be this arsehole of an arrogant essex man who be also hostelling his way around new zealand on this large motorbike and he basically he go to the boss of every hostel and say look i really really really snore so you need to give me my own personal hostel room at the same price as a share room bed because i'll keep people awake and you will get complaints and i just think what a dick you know i mean he be kind of dress it up as i'm concern about everybody else erm but really he be just want something better for nothing he invariably get it so yeah i be think
S0619	that's funny yeah uhu
S0618	yeah i didn't like his vibe so yeah this be weird there's a sort of a bite of heat come out of this chipboard thing can you feel it
S0619	well there's a radiator
S0618	oh it's up there look there's a radiator behind here
S0619	i can't feel it because i'm very warm in this sort of
S0618	yeah so anyway yeah we'll see but don't don't worry on my account because oh there's
S0619	oh hello
S0618	because erm i'm quite use to share with my brother when we have be place and he can snore for england
S0619	uhu i don't yeah i'm really try but i know that i be at the moment because there's just like stuff go on
S0618	do you wake up with a sore throat
S0619	er with a really dry mouth but it's only be one night so far
S0618	yeah it will pass yeah good for you though
S0619	you know these people on this website say like they only use this sort of medication once a day and try to wean themself off it or they only use it in one nostril they have to do it that way so it's like
S0618	mm yeah be you cold turkey
S0619	so i'm go to try but it have be a few hours so i might sort of die before then
S0618	yeah
S0619	i just don't want to
S0618	i think cold turkey be the way
S0619	yeah keep ring me oh well
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	this be something that i need to give up but i don't really know how to approach the give up the give up part it be not so easy to give up an actual person
S0618	oh i don't know
S0619	i can't just you know pour him down the sink
S0619	or put him in the bin or give him to a friend until i come back
S0618	i can be really black and white about people sometimes and i can just switch off i'm not sure where that come from self preservation instinct i suppose
S0619	i know no i can it's like i do it before i can switch someone off like a light switch but i'm never very good at sort of tell them i just go cold turkey with people in the sense that i never speak to them and if they text me i don't reply and if they call me i don't answer and when i see them i blank them which be all horrible things that i shouldn't do
S0618	yeah yeah why
S0619	well because i don't think it be fair people sometimes need explanations and but i don't i'm not the sort of person i just don't have the capability to say this isn't work i'm not therefore i can't do it no sorry bye
S0618	mm maybe yeah mm yeah to my mind this be a situation where selfishness be vitally important and i suppose there be some sort of circumstances or situations where it might be a kindness to the other person or i don't know compassionate thing to have the conversation with them but at other time
S0619	yeah yeah you get to do it for yourself
S0618	yeah you've get to do it for yourself i find i can sometimes be a little bite aggressive then sometimes which isn't like me and i will tell someone to fuck off if need be but yeah i'm think about an ex friend who a few years ago and i be a little bite the same i be just blank her for a while we have a huge fall out and i just think well fuck you and have the space then to look back on the friendship and relationship and just to think actually that's not really healthy for me and i don't want anything to do with that so off you go then
S0619	yeah yeah that's what we be say in the car the other day i want somebody for whom you know after themselves i'm the most important person in their life and that's not this person you know i will never be the most important person in his life er
S0618	mm yeah yeah yeah i completely agree i'm in a relationship i want to be adore
S0619	i be the centre of your world
S0618	yeah i don't mean that in a completely self centre way
S0619	yeah no no neither do i
S0618	but i just want somebody to really value and appreciate me and if they don't really value and appreciate me you know like you say as well as have their own life and their own interest
S0619	yes yeah everyone be you should be the centre of your own world you should be the most important person
S0618	exactly yeah first and foremost i agree
S0619	but i want to be a presence and i don't think i be
S0618	yeah and to feel important and to feel consider and to i suppose that's a true partnership isn't it
S0619	and i think i'm the sort of right now in this thing that be end i don't think it even begin but you know i'm sort of at a
S0618	be end or have end
S0619	have end be end be end erm you know i'm a sort of fair weather person it be like oh i don't know what to do so i will call this person it be like oh i don't know what to do so i will call this person or i need to get out of so i'll call this person and it's not you know i'm desperate to see you so
S0618	mm yeah yeah it's not the best reason really be it
S0619	no i know
S0618	you might think in a relationship that you know the motivate factor would be more like yeah desperate to see you or not in a can't live my life without you kind of a way you expect the other individual to be exactly that individual who be perfectly complete in on themselves who bring something to the table so you can be a complete person they be a complete person but when you get together you're a kind of organism of something greater than the sum of the part erm and create something beautiful together that really benefit you both that expand you both that challenge you both but
S0619	uhu uhu where be these people i haven't find one
S0618	i have yeah
S0619	and i think it's because i'm work stuff out and i have to be alone
S0618	i want to be alone
S0619	no it's not that i want i don't want to be but i be have to be until i work out whatever this be whatever be go on and i think this be the sort of the turn point the sort of the pinnacle sort of what's the word the pivot
S0618	no i think that's important yeah yeah the pivotal point yeah
S0619	yeah and people who come into my life now will be because they be interest in this sort of strange sober person you know maybe i need a gym somebody from the gym because people be healthy and they don't drink and they don't judge for go to bed at ten o'clock because they be do it too i think that's what i need and not an alcoholic
S0618	mm mm yeah i suppose yeah that be the thing when you change you know you yeah you do need your friends to i don't know not change i don't know
S0619	not not change for you but you need people on a similar a similar wavelength or in a in a similar routine with similar erm interest not necessarily interest but things that be important or
S0618	on a wavelength yeah yeah i guess when i think about you i see somebody who be evolve or i mean you know how we be dynamic creatures we be always evolve we always change you know i i don't think a personality be ever set but i suppose you have certain characteristics or a certain resonance or a certain vibe that you get on for a period of time because it suit you and you explore everything within that vibe and then something shift or change and you move and you do become a different person on a cellular level on a and well on a cellular level you be not you be a completely different human be to the physical organism you be seven years ago everything about you have shift and change and also sort of psychologically spiritually emotionally well you be a different person in every moment you be reinvent in every now but i do think you hit these like you know you be at one now which be a life change oh okay choice of two big paths and there's another probable you that's carry on business as usual but this wider path be the you that be now recreate or create something new and i think good for you be assertive and be proud of who you be don't do yourself down or call yourself a sad git for go to bed at ten o'clock you know be proud of that
S0619	yeah yeah uhu uhu it's great i be
S0618	it be fabulous if it feel good do it
S0619	yeah
S0618	but be proud to be that person and the more you embrace and feel joy at be that person the more you will attract people to you who be on that vibe definitely like attract like it's the law
S0619	yeah yeah and i think like do attract like but er especially in this situation when we be here it be harder to attract because there be so many kind of layer of like filter almost you know you have to say right erm can you speak english
S0618	yeah uhu yeah definitely first and foremost
S0619	so you know if you be play a game of guess who and you be put down face that's like a part of your board go
S0618	yeah that's the first one isn't it that's more than half your board
S0619	yeah yeah you be think i be go to try it okay erm
S0618	so most likely it's go to be english people who be teachers that you get to know and i guess the question how do you meet more natives i don't know you go to spain
S0619	yeah yeah yeah and then it's like yeah exactly you can't do it here can you speak english be you in the vicinity of this city more or less
S0618	mm yeah within an hour or two bus drive yeah
S0619	and then you know you can get more and more specific into what you sort of want or like or
S0618	mm
S0619	anyway i need to go to the toilet do you mind pause the
S0618	can you do a pause on this
S0619	otherwise you can sit and talk to yourself
S0618	can you do a pause thing on a record
S0619	i think you just stop and then you can just carry on again
S0618	can you okay there we be
S0619	so it should just continue i will have to have a little break
S0618	jolly good i send a text to say we would be back at your flat by two forty five at the latest
S0619	yeah i walk home from her house last night and it didn't take me long it take about twenty five thirty minutes
S0618	oh that's not long
S0619	yeah and it be just a straight line
S0618	i should think it feel like age in the van that's probably because we always go the wrong way and have to turn round and go back
S0619	yeah yeah and i think we go a long way round maybe no i don't know i don't know
S0618	yeah mm that will be 's satnav for you
S0619	yeah right so i'm just go to research this
S0618	yeah i might look at this bistro menu particularly where it say burrito for fifteen something like two pound fifty for a burrito
S0619	i don't know yeah what we will get in it though
S0618	i know probably something dead
S0619	erm sure i be try to see what else they have that be vegetarian and i don't think there be so much because even the salads have stuff apart from dry tomato salad but that's like it and erm there's potato cake with with mushroom sauce
S0618	ah now erm say that potato cake with mushroom sauce generally have something dead float around as well
S0619	yeah and some come with like lardy stuff on top
S0618	yeah be normally alright what be you look for
S0619	oh just some lip balm my lips be dead sore
S0618	do you want some vaseline
S0619	no i have i have
S0618	i've get load of these tin of vaseline
S0619	yeah so have i
S0618	i'm sure of them be like thirty years old
S0619	i've get yeah i've get because i never use vaseline because i always hear mix er report on how good it be as a moisturiser and that it
S0618	i've get one that be go rusty yeah it's more of a barrier
S0619	yeah stop stuff get in but doesn't actually actively moisturise
S0618	no but i quite like that because i wonder with moisturisers i try not to use them because i think
S0619	yeah yeah just sort of chemicals into your face i suppose
S0618	well yeah and parabens and shit but no i erm like hand or whatever for example i think the more you use a moisturiser the more you need it
S0619	the more your skin need them yeah and i use to have really dry hand but because i've be like really hammer the water i haven't have dry hand and it's be like and i rarely wear gloves because i'm such a forgetful
S0618	oh yeah oh good good because you've be yeah okay so hydrate from the inside
S0619	hopefully the water yes i'm just go to drink some water now would you like another oh i suppose if we be go back in 's and we've get coffee at home so we don't need to have a
S0618	yeah that's cool
S0619	well we'll have a sit and maybe have a long walk home
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know how we can lengthen the journey er i might nip and get some milk er
S0618	in lidl
S0619	er anywhere i'm just try to think if there's anything i need i've get tea coffee and milk
S0618	i like lidl but i find i use to love lidl in northern ireland every thursday it be oh all the new things be in and on a thursday it would be pack and i use to go on a thursday because i use to drive a forty mile round trip to get the only organic vegetables that be available in the whole of northern ireland from the holywood camphill community so i use to be uptown every thursday anyway and call into lidl and the quality be excellent but i find lidl here the quality of all of the stuff it's all just polyester and stuff really give you bad electric shock so don't go near anything metal so er yeah so i haven't buy hardly anything from the all the knicky knacky new section in the middle of lidl but the biedronka the polish lidl be brilliant and they have erm stuff that's make in poland and the quality be great
S0619	yes nice nice what like the clothe and stuff uhu no i never go to biedronka in fact i didn't even know there be one near alma until today there be another one over that way across that little roundabout you know at the end of er if you pick me up then there's a roundabout near the flat
S0618	oh yeah yeah yeah uhu mm oh yeah and then drive towards
S0619	yeah kind of or drive towards gemini there's a biedronka around there but i never think to go maybe i will be start go to biedronka
S0618	okay yeah okay no it's good it's good
S0619	because i go to alma on the way back from the court
S0618	i know because it's easy and you be pass it
S0619	for for kind of basically bits and then tesco at the moment because it's next to the gym creature of habit
S0618	no biedronka be brilliant for all of their like bits in cage that be bargain in the middle erm yeah really good and also they be really good for saudi things a bite like lidl actually i find them in lidl how you you get those tubs of
S0619	mm uhu coleslaw and stuff
S0618	yeah coleslaw or the carrot or beetroot or cabbage or whatever they might be and they be really cheap and really nice so yeah i tend to buy those in biedronka and they've quite often get row of pick and mix nut or seed or fruit which be pretty good as well and incredibly cheap i saw dry kiwis the other day which be really interest yeah
S0619	oh how excite i be look for some dry pineapple and it be dead expensive and that be in galeria in and you know there's a big supermarket oh no be i there i be somewhere yeah i be there
S0618	no in
S0619	yeah or maybe it be in
S0618	oh the french supermarket

S0619	the applicator tampon
S0618	i'm alright i bring a load from england
S0619	yeah i i buy some the other day from rossman
S0618	i've be really tempt to try a mooncup
S0619	yeah my friend mooncups erm and she swear by it erm i don't know how i feel
S0618	mm no i be not very i'm not sure i could be bother with all of that and the mess
S0619	but i think you know if you be sort of in public toilets for example it's just you'd have to take that and you'd have to take wipe just because you'd just you know
S0618	yeah yeah yeah yeah you be blob everywhere while you be wash the thing out
S0619	well all over your hand and stuff it's alright in the comfort of your own home but yeah
S0618	yeah i don't know i wonder i'll see because yeah i maybe when i'm live with a hippy dippy community it might be the way to go
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	but my friend say it's no problem and it's sort of easy and quick and comfortable
S0618	yeah yeah there be youtube videos that i haven't watch and i think maybe if i watch them that might decide me
S0619	spur you on
S0618	up in cambridge sell them the last time i be in cambridge i be in there pick up my fluoride free toothpaste and i saw them oh shall i shan't i shall i'shan't i but anyway i will ponder it a bite longer but i think i probably will yeah
S0619	yeah we'll see i just think if it be not break don't fix it
S0618	well it be sort of be for me live in poland because i do like my applicator tampon and i can't be do with the non applicator ones i mean biologically speak it's just not happen quite frankly
S0619	well then i know but then mooncups be not far remove from that you still have to do a lot of poke around
S0618	i manage one of them what's that contraceptive thingy
S0619	coil
S0618	no not coil be it cap
S0619	like a dam be it call dam or something
S0618	yeah i manage one of them for a year when i actually go out with a man and that be fine yeah so i don't know we'll see we shall see
