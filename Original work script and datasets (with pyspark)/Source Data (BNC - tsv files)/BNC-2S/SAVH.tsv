S0670	so i'm l i kiss a girl once and it be nice
S0671	erm
S0670	she have very lips
S0670	full body as well
S0671	well i
S0670	so how's your sex life
S0671	well what what i be go to ask be erm er the deal or no deal question again
S0670	yeah okay
S0671	at what point would you erm
S0670	be we talk weakest link
S0671	in your
S0670	or deal or no deal
S0671	and your well i don't i don't really
S0670	or who want to be a millionaire
S0670	because
S0671	well i don't know i don't know er weakest link the concept of weakest link i just know that you
S0670	you answer question every time an answer be correct it move up er in the you know amount of money you can win but if anyone get a question wrong it all go back to zero and before a question be ask
S0671	so when you
S0670	you can say bank so it's technically work as a team but it's also very individual
S0671	like cricket
S0670	no more individual than that as in basically the benefit
S0671	hunger hunger game
S0670	of work as as
S0671	the hunger game
S0670	yes
S0670	essentially it be like you're work together in order for it to be better for you
S0671	right yeah
S0670	erm and you basically
S0671	so communism
S0670	it's like a very capitalist version of communism
S0670	yeah erm
S0671	well i guess then you wouldn't have much difficulty
S0670	and basically before so you but the main thing be just you answer a question and you want to get it right because if you get it wrong not only do it take the prize money back down to zero for that round
S0671	yeah
S0670	but also at the end end of every round everyone vote as to who get knock out that round
S0671	oh so surely you just
S0670	so it's a cross between pick
S0670	oh that person get the most answer wrong
S0671	people who be go to be better than you you want no
S0670	no no that's the thing be that most people at the begin vote for the people that get it wrong but beyond that cos you you want people to get it right
S0671	oh my goodness it's
S0670	in order to get you know the money up
S0671	yeah
S0670	cos if you just have people get it wrong then you would never do well you'd never get the money
S0671	yeah
S0670	and then towards the end then it get tactical and like i think that person might
S0671	oh my goodness
S0670	you know try and oust me
S0671	but
S0670	next time so i'll vote for them and hope that other people do as well and then of course when you vote for someone else you're erm
S0671	you're like and if they don't go out
S0670	if if they don't if they don't go out then regardless of your performance they're gonna be like oh but they vote for me i don't like them so you're gonna vote for them to get out it get weirdly personal and spiteful and stuff
S0671	whereas deal or no deal
S0670	and not only
S0671	be just harmless fun
S0670	not only be it be it just like oh if you've get the question wrong i'll vote for you because before you ask before the question be ask a person can say bank and if they say bank then
S0671	they get all the money
S0670	no then all of the money get save so let's say five question in a row be answer correctly as they go round
S0671	so you get say five hundred
S0670	let let's say erm
S0671	but be it be it
S0670	five grand
S0671	exponential
S0670	at that stage it
S0671	okay
S0670	it do get exponential let's say it's five grand erm and
S0671	to share between your
S0670	a person a person say bank
S0671	okay yeah
S0670	then that five grand be save so that they have five grand that round regardless
S0671	yeah
S0670	but then it go back down to zero for that question
S0671	but that question could be really easy
S0670	yeah in which case if it be easy people be like oh you shouldn't have say bank and then you know we could have go up from five grand to you know ten grand
S0671	mm
S0670	so it's tactically bank because obviously if you don't say bank and you're high up and you get it wrong then it go back to zero but if you say bank too early then you're gonna look like an idiot because you could have go higher
S0671	yeah
S0670	erm and then basically the person at the end who when they get to the last two then they have a sudden death so whoever get the question wrong first lose and the other person get the prize money
S0671	so the chance of you actually win this game be pretty slim
S0670	oh very slim like it's not it's not even about it's not a hundred percent about your ability erm in quids kind of cos you can be really good and someone might tactically be like i don't want them in the game any more because they're gonna cause problems for me so they'll try and vote you out
S0671	goodness
S0670	yeah it be vicious and anne robinson
S0670	that woman
S0670	be absolutely vicious
S0670	like she be just so brutal for no reason it would be like so
S0670	you're a
S0671	you're a
S0670	zoologist
S0671	you're a plumber
S0670	from bristol
S0671	not exactly brain surgery be it
S0670	like she would just literally rip into people like personally for no reason
S0671	that's so funny
S0670	and you'd be like why be you do this so that's
S0670	not exactly a very specialist field now be it chris and chris be just there like like what why anne why be you do this
S0670	do you get some kind of kick out of this and the producers every time like anne can you please you know tone it down
S0670	the insult
S0671	anne just like okay
S0670	and she's just there like no i shall not these idiots
S0671	she's richard
S0670	continue come onto this programme i will continue insult them
S0671	she's basically richard the third isn't she
S0670	she be she be a more malevolent richard the third i'd say
S0671	more
S0670	and that wink every time she be like you be the weakest link goodbye and then wink and it be just you could feel
S0671	really
S0670	yeah as in like it wasn't a wink as in like a aye kind of wink
S0670	it be a sort of like you're the weakest link goodbye and it
S0670	i don't know how she do it but it manage to even as a viewer like suck the soul out of you
S0671	so erm that's
S0670	you be just they she'd be like you be the weakest link goodbye and you'd kind of just sit there and be like i need a hug
S0670	someone just hold me please
S0671	so let's say you're on erm oh you're on er
S0670	the weakest link
S0671	no i be gonna say deal or no deal
S0670	oh deal or no deal great okay
S0671	which be more harmless
S0670	well that that explanation of the weakest link be a very very helpful then wasn't it
S0671	contributory yes
S0670	so i'm i'm on deal or no deal
S0671	erm
S0670	with
S0671	the scenario be
S0670	noel knobhead edmonds
S0670	he really be just just a slimy git isn't he
S0671	so the erm i be in this the banker give you erm offer doesn't he
S0670	offer yes
S0671	er okay so
S0670	he do
S0671	the banker's give you and offer of oh goodness
S0670	i mean the banker in
S0671	ten thousand
S0670	deal or no deal it just
S0671	he he wouldn't
S0670	no he just he give outrageously low offer
S0670	every time it's just they're like yeah so you've get rid of everything under the ten grand limit except ten pence and one penny and the banker's like i'll offer you two hundred it's just and you're like no you're just laws of probability be kind of you know hugely in my favour now
S0671	would you do it by gut instinct or by er work like by probability
S0670	well the thing be that gut instinct be just intrinsically gonna be wrong more time ironically out of probability it will be but
S0670	if you win by probability it's kind of a hollow win and it's like because it's hugely unlikely that you'd win big big by probability
S0671	yeah
S0670	if you're work entirely mathematically you'd probably end up with like a five ten grand kind of prize you'd get some money and it's good money but there would come a point halfway through the show where everyone would be like yeah yeah no he's do really well and you'd be like yeah i'll take the ten grand thank you bye
S0671	yeah yeah
S0670	everyone'll be like what no go for the big prize you can still have the big prize and you're like statistically no
S0670	gonna stick with this but if you and if but there again yeah if you go with the gut instinct and you win then that's just the most incredible feel it's just
S0671	it's like square a last minute goal in fifa
S0670	it's a little too soon mate
S0670	the wound
S0671	well as as you you
S0670	haven't quite heal over there for that
S0671	i shouldn't because erm because you don't you beat me so i'm sorry
S0670	yeah kind of no you don't have to apologise i'd do exactly the same thing
S0671	you don't go you don't go
S0670	what be i say the other day when i be like go up to the shop can i buy you some fifa ability i do exactly this we both do this
S0671	but not a huge isn't it
S0670	yeah but i win more often so
S0670	you should definitely enjoy the sport a bite more
S0670	erm do you want the m and m cookie by the way
S0671	be you gonna chuck it out if you don't

S0670	in a shakespeareanmanner until hamlet and he be
S0671	yeah
S0670	fantastic in that but in fact i'm no i'm i'm gonna go ahead and say i think his hamlet performance be better than his richard the third performance but this be in the context of him be incredible in both i prefer the hamlet performance yeah why not
S0671	yes

S0671	a good question erm it's quite expensive isn't it if we're not
S0670	if we're not what
S0671	if we're not go on the door it's like it's probably be it over ten pound
S0670	i think it be twenty something
S0671	that's quite i don't think i can
S0670	i i don't have that kind of budget for this next week or two
S0671	mm
S0670	i'm fine with go to the door and then if they don't have ticket

S0671	yeah
S0670	yeah so we walk into town if they have some on the door we enjoy a fantastic performance of a midsummer night's dream
S0671	indeed with er the royal shakespeare company
S0670	indeed and if they don't to
S0671	there you go good idea so either way we're
S0670	yes
S0671	great that's good
S0670	wonderful teamwork what team wildcats team wildcats
S0671	oh sorry wildcats
S0670	nail it erm yeah yeah
S0671	that childhood propaganda that be high school musical
S0670	what high school musical
S0671	yeah
S0670	er er discuss and explore the idea of
S0671	well
S0670	high school musical as propaganda
S0671	i don't know all the haven't read all the theories of
S0670	no no certainly
S0671	the immediate
S0670	okay stop
S0671	i can't yeah so the theories of media and the
S0670	stop stop i do not i'd i don't give a toss about critical theory at this stage secondary source i want no citations or reference
S0671	so just
S0670	i want your
S0671	pure
S0670	yes
S0670	i want your opinion on the matter
S0671	my opinion be that it portray a certain picture
S0670	uhu
S0671	of erm western late teenage years life
S0670	yeah
S0671	which be firstly not representative of the entire world
S0670	uhu
S0671	and therefore whereas it's obviously culturally construct and it's try to it be hold up a picture of society which because it's not representative be propaganda
S0670	mm
S0671	for a certain way of live and for certain attitudes
S0670	i would agree entirely but as i'd say this this wasn't a springboard for me to say you're wrong this be a springboard for me to say you're right
S0671	okay well i could
S0670	i agree entirely i think it's a very interest theory that you consider it propaganda and i'd agree with you on it i think that you
S0671	not say it's not nice to watch
S0670	oh no no it's it be nice but that's kind of the point be that it's
S0671	mm
S0670	overtly nice to a point where it isn't representative it's absolutely not i mean if you take a look at the the yeah that look perfect if you take a look at the the conflict within it the main conflict of the of high school musical be that troy bolton be too talented as the main as the main character it's not that he have a flaw
S0671	mm
S0670	it's that he just be too good at everything he's too good at sport and
S0671	mm
S0670	er sing and his academic study
S0671	so he have to choose be be that it
S0670	so he have to choose where where to go from there
S0671	and
S0670	do he take up a scholarship in a
S0671	yeah
S0670	sport university or what
S0671	yeah
S0670	and then beyond that
S0671	yeah that kind of thing
S0670	it's erm er er
S0671	actually
S0670	no no that
S0671	mm
S0670	yeah
S0671	and it get young people inspire to be to do well in life
S0670	oh yeah but it do also kind of imply that to do well in life you erm kind of need to go into wait no how do it end i i would suggest that it do imply that
S0671	he's he's with his friends isn't he
S0670	the route to success be university
S0671	yeah
S0670	be college yeah
S0671	and he also stay with his friends
S0670	yeah but i i can't remember how it end so i don't know for definite if that's what it be say erm mm yeah it do have an interest message erm at least on the idea of stick it to the status quo or a the americans
S0671	mm
S0670	in high school musical unfortunately
S0670	refer to it as status quo which it's absolutely not and it's an infuriate song to listen to status quo man
S0671	be they say be they say you that you should and that be
S0670	so
S0671	the satire of it
S0670	so the song in itself
S0671	mm
S0670	erm have the lyric in the so the verse be a character say for example like oh i love to play the violin or i think one of them be a basketball player say i love to bake
S0671	yeah
S0670	erm and and then the the chorus go no no no no stick to the stuff you know it's better by far to leave things as they be don't mess with the flow no no no no stick to the status quo
S0671	okay obviously
S0670	erm which obviously
S0671	suppose to
S0670	be fly
S0671	yeah
S0670	completely against the direction the film the musical be try to take it which be embrace who you be
S0671	okay yeah
S0670	and you know your your passions as oppose to the social construct that you're mean to fit into
S0671	but
S0670	which be a positive
S0671	yeah this be very
S0670	film in my opinion
S0671	yes very good er just a side tangent on
S0670	yeah
S0671	yeah have you have you say any more about that have i stop your main point
S0670	no that that be kind of the main point be basically that it do have a good direction the film and
S0671	yeah yeah i i entirely agree
S0670	it be it be suggest that the especially gender norms erm within society be irrelevant at this stage
S0671	mm
S0670	and you know harmful but yeah what what be you go to say
S0671	i be go to say that our be be bring to my well er one argument that i've be think about recently be that our passions
S0670	mm
S0671	be merely socially construct norms
S0670	oh
S0671	you for instance the guy who's in it bake
S0670	yeah
S0671	have get into bake not because he's somehow intrinsically erm make for it
S0671	he's come out of the womb he hasn't come out of the womb with a spatula in his hand he's come out of the womb into a family where either bake be like really prize and he's adhere to that
S0670	yeah
S0671	or it's really shun and he's find it from some role model and he's get it whereas his basketball be what his family want him to do so it's all these passions aren't things that be like great things that we should be champion they're just other type of norms
S0670	i think textually there be not a lot of evidence for that
S0671	so not not yeah
S0670	but
S0671	none from
S0670	but if we're go
S0671	none from high school musical
S0670	if we're go
S0671	but like this be my opinion
S0670	if we're go beyond textually
S0671	this be my opinion of life generally
S0670	okay i i agree with you to a point
S0671	okay
S0670	i agree with
S0671	i that i be thankful that you do
S0670	i
S0671	to a point
S0670	i agree that that be definitely a way that it it can be see and also a way that it happen especially erm the kind of polar opposites of er something be love and kind of like worship within a family that stick to it or something be shun erm because i think especially within the young teenage years erm what parent champion and love and also hate and kind of i think those things be very very closely as you say adhere to or completely
S0671	yeah
S0670	erm rebel against by young teens but at the same time i would say although your viewpoint be one way it do happen i would also say that there be some things that people have a passion for that isn't erm directly cause by familial or friend
S0671	yeah that's good
S0670	or social construct
S0671	and i'm please yes mm like erm example be
S0670	i mean you you could look at it broadly and say that everything er be cause by social construct ie that family be really into football the son like play golf they're both under the umbrella of sport and because the family
S0671	uhu
S0670	love sport that's the social construct i think you can get very you can reach very widely within that idea but i i do think that there do get there there there have to be a stage where you say that be not cause by a social construct that be remove enough that that be an independent
S0671	yeah
S0670	passion
S0671	in in which case it would have to not be an art as in it would have to not be something with a set of rule that you have to learn from someone
S0670	what what
S0671	because because
S0670	no no sorry you'd say it it doesn't it can't be an art
S0671	it can't be it can't be so it can't be erm a musical oh it could be a musical instrument if they teach it themselves like they just find a musical instrument and teach them themselves the musical instrument
S0670	yeah
S0671	but i what i'm say it can't be anything where someone have have to teach them the rule like they can't learn erm
S0670	but how far do you do you go with that for example i enjoy write stories and write creatively before i be teach it on you know a curriculum level
S0671	okay
S0670	but i read book so be i be teach by the author through that media
S0671	mm i guess you be take line of argument then yes
S0670	then in the same way that that go if someone just pick up an instrument and you know start play it be they not learn that instrument through whoever create that instrument music be the rearrange of note in the same way that creative write be rearrange of word
S0671	yeah yeah good i like that yeah so that just kind of be rather rather dismal so basically i think then we have to look up and just say everything we learn be teach to us
S0670	i would er i would disagree with that purely because although although you're take that from what i've just say what i've just say be reductio ad absurdum
S0671	okay
S0670	purely just for my own cause my personal belief erm beyond ruin you in that argument
S0670	erm my personal belief
S0671	no you've just help my argument
S0670	yeah do it though
S0671	it do because what i'm say be that you but if someone have a passion it's it's not construct by themselves but it's help by other people it's construct socially
S0670	yes
S0671	in the same way that the guitar's construct
S0670	and in and in say that my argument have help yours you have foil our own argument cos i just
S0671	foil your argument that be that be a different argument
S0670	no no i be
S0670	further your argument reductio ad absurdum be where you take an argument and then you
S0671	further
S0670	exaggerate it
S0671	yeah
S0670	until it's ridiculous
S0671	yeah but that wasn't ridiculous
S0670	it be though
S0671	that wasn't completely
S0670	no no no no no no
S0671	ridiculous
S0670	to say that play a musical instrument you're teach
S0670	by the person who make that instrument be utter bollocks
S0671	no i didn't say he be teach but it by it do i
S0670	yes i cos you we be i say that be i
S0671	i be say it have an influence on him
S0670	in read a book
S0671	have an influence on him
S0670	in read a book be i teach by the author and you say oh good point to an extent
S0670	now i say well in that case be you not teach by the creator of an instrument
S0671	well we be say teach as in
S0670	and you agree similarity
S0671	influence by yes
S0670	you be not though
S0671	you be because if they weren't alive the the the thing
S0670	you be not no no you you be not influence
S0671	wouldn't have be make
S0670	you be not influence by the creator of the instrument you be influence
S0671	no no
S0670	by the music that you're make with it the medium be irrelevant the book be irrelevant the musical instrument itself be irrelevant the art that you're create with it the note the write that you be write
S0671	mm
S0670	be what be relevant that be the passion there's a difference between read a book as an art and write as an art in the same way that there's a difference between play an instrument and the creation of an instrument
S0671	be there really
S0670	yes
S0671	but you have to have one in mind to be able to do the other you have to in order to create the instrument you have to know that it will make an art
S0670	you don't have to know
S0671	well you can't just have a block and erm another block on top of it you have to know that the string vibrate to make the er
S0670	to make a noise
S0670	yes but to make an art no
S0671	why be it a strong oh no okay yeah okay okay
S0670	in the same way that you can you can take art out of things that be not originally intend to be art you can make an orchestra out of exhaust from a car
S0671	yeah yeah
S0670	the exhaust be not make to make art the exhaust be make to be functional
S0671	and this help your point in what way sorry i've forget
S0670	i think we've both forget
S0671	i think we
S0670	my point
S0671	it's a brilliant discussion
S0670	my point my personal belief be basically that you it's cut off be most of my argument here be that you have to have define point in the sense that if you you can take an argument and say oh you know art be influence by the note which be influence by the instrument which be influence by the creator the creator be influence by someone else before that i'm say that you need to have define point
S0671	yeah
S0670	where
S0671	so the
S0670	in in my context in write can be influence by a book but it's not intrinsically so you can't so in in my opinion art can be a passion that be personal as oppose to socially construct because you don't have to be influence by another person
S0671	okay so in just sorry
S0670	that's okay keep go
S0671	in erm in er so in that line of think if there be a somebody who let's say just for fun hadn't come into contact with another person
S0670	uhu
S0671	erm
S0670	feral child
S0671	would would they have the ability to create art
S0670	i think that art take on a far more abstract
S0671	yes it would
S0670	definition here be you talk about art in the mind of the outsider
S0671	erm as in the mind
S0670	or
S0671	as in as in would they have something of their passion i guess would tie our argument
S0670	that
S0671	back nicely wouldn't it
S0670	that be a wonderful point because that be say it be again be passions inherently constructive within our society something that we're teach or
S0671	or can you have it without this be get to the point
S0670	or be this something that the human condition be build upon
S0671	yeah
S0670	be basically be human be humanity
S0671	be we humans or be we dancers
S0670	my sign be vital my hand be cold
S0671	i'm on my knees look
S0670	look for the answer
S0671	for the answer no
S0670	yeah no the the question there the very crux of it be be be humans animal or be they something more be we build to survive or be we build to thrive that's what we're come to here
S0671	mm
S0670	be be we an be be we subject to pure necessity or
S0671	or be we make for passion
S0670	yes that's a gold star for you
S0671	and that be the subject of next week's lecture
S0670	this have be your host with guest lecturer
S0671	from the university from the university of
