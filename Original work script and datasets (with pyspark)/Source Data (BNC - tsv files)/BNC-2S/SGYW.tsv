S0180	there's bbc news
S0070	mm
S0180	bbc4 be good
S0070	mm
S0180	you get intelligent program on that and then sometimes there's an interest film on
S0070	mm
S0180	itv4 or whatever
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	but there's not much
S0070	yesterday have one thing interest perhaps a day or week
S0180	i think er but you have to like with everything
S0070	and film4
S0180	you have to scan and and pick and choose carefully
S0070	but no the point be you know there's like a hundred odd channel isn't there
S0180	yeah
S0070	and they're all just crap aren't they most of them
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	most of them most of them you know and the even in the daytime you still can't find anything to watch
S0180	i but i'm think of kid some of them must be real telly addict cos then they must have all these plus they buy sport and like
S0070	mm
S0180	plus film channel they they subscribe to
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	must spend their whole live watch tv
S0070	i suppose yeah mm
S0180	some people do don't they
S0070	yeah i think so yeah well it's always on isn't it in the background but there's not you know just it's it's funny cos even with the insane number of channel you still have the same pattern of daytime television you er you know
S0180	yeah
S0070	there's always that chatshow crap in the morning and
S0180	yeah
S0070	then it sort of settle down a bite
S0180	they don't really give you more choice do they
S0070	it doesn't really give yeah
S0180	mid morning if you want to watch something serious
S0070	exactly yeah or a film

S0070	but you've like you know documentaries you know that er er that's and yesterday occasionally have er but most of that's about war
S0180	yeah second world war
S0070	isn't it yeah
S0180	it's all about hitler
S0070	yeah
S0180	it should be call the hitler channel
S0070	the hitler channel
S0180	it be isn't it
S0070	film five should be call like be it film five or something the steven seagal channel
S0180	yes that's right back to back steven seagal
S0070	lethal weapon how many time have lethal and then all it's always the same
S0180	and er
S0070	lethal weapon or
S0180	jurassic park on itv1
S0070	jurassic park
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah and they go through phase where they kind of repeat it often don't they
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	like stardust be on a which be an okay and everything
S0180	what's that one
S0070	er it's sort of like a er magical thing where he some girl fall from the
S0180	be it like neverending story
S0070	it's a bite like that
S0070	a bite more update yeah but it it's one er they just show it again and again
S0180	i guess they buy the right to certain film
S0070	i suppose so
S0180	don't they
S0070	yes yes
S0180	so they you know show it as much as possible
S0070	as much as they can get away with
S0180	fill up the schedule
S0070	yeah
S0180	with something isn't it
S0070	and and then it kind of and then they replace it with something else and then it come back again and then there's the sherlock holmes channel isn't there
S0070	who
S0180	itv3 always play poirot but i quite like poirot
S0070	yeah yeah yeah i mean occasionally or sherlock holmes be on occasionally the whole day heartbeat it's heartbeat day
S0070	and then
S0180	your heart would stop if you watch all of it
S0070	yeah it would yeah and then silly channel that er er er sell things you know
S0070	yeah it would yeah and then silly channel that er er er sell things you know
S0180	oh yeah i know
S0070	have you ever watch well well seriously i mean who who watch who watch these
S0180	that's in battersea that the qvc channel
S0070	be it
S0180	it's next to battersea park
S0070	oh
S0180	where the observer newspaper use to be
S0070	oh yeah okay
S0180	yeah yeah yeah like big white and
S0070	mm
S0180	and black build
S0070	yeah but who you know do
S0180	i dunno some people do though i do watch ten minutes of the garden programme once where they try and sell you garden products only cos i'm interest in garden stuff
S0070	mm yeah
S0180	yeah that be quite interest for a while
S0070	but then you know but you know wouldn't you go to the garden centre
S0180	well to be honest
S0070	i it depend what
S0180	i i get much more entertainment from the internet
S0070	mm
S0180	like videos
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	cos cos because you can be in control
S0070	sure
S0180	you can watch something on youtube
S0070	yeah when you
S0180	you can pause it you can stop it
S0070	yeah it's more yeah yeah it's interactive isn't it more or less
S0180	i find tv too passive
S0070	yeah yeah yeah cos once you're stick on that channel
S0180	yeah
S0070	there's nothing you can do apart from go to heartbeat or sherlock holmes
S0180	but i think most people nowadays find the internet much more
S0070	yeah mm
S0180	for news and video
S0070	mm
S0180	like i don't i don't i don't wait for the six o'clock news to get news
S0070	and and and and that's what i mean that's that's the tv hasn't really catch up with with this new
S0180	no
S0070	thing have it you know with the internet you know you can watch anything at any time and you can cut and to to to watch a bite of that bite of that the only thing that would be very good be if you could watch
S0180	yeah
S0070	four screen at once but um the tv hasn't really catch up
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	and that it's still plod along with its traditional
S0180	they be talk about put internet on the tv weren't they
S0070	that would be quite useful
S0180	you can stream it to your
S0070	that would be quite useful which er surely in time it will happen won't it
S0180	yeah
S0070	put it inside our head that er that's that'd be the ultimate we could be on the internet all the time
S0180	think control yeah oh no
S0070	and those yeah well you're not er
S0180	some countries like korea seem to be want that don't they cos the korean students i've have be so
S0070	mm
S0180	they get very frustrate with the speed of the internet
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	well why don't you look out the window for five minutes
S0180	you know just relax do you have to be connect all the time you know it's like do you know what i mean and when you say um
S0180	nobody send letter in korea
S0070	no no
S0180	cos nobody have the patience to sit down and
S0070	i suppose not
S0180	and then and then go and buy a stamp
S0070	yeah they're not kind of write people like that but they're quite into the
S0180	there must be postboxes and post offices
S0070	there be there be but not not like we have them here you know where they're on er sort of
S0180	every street corner yeah
S0070	not these days but they be yeah every village every street corner
S0180	you have to go to you have to make a special trip to a post office
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	some countries be like that
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah and they're not they're you know they they don't have a you know like we we can easily recognize them with their
S0180	yeah
S0070	sign and their postbox outside and the postman they're kind of a bite more blend into the
S0180	hide and seek with the post office
S0070	mm
S0070	cos most people don't
S0180	that's part of the fun you have to find the post office
S0070	find it first
S0070	with a a big hat on
S0180	yeah
S0070	it's funny cos i we do do you remember the korean girl
S0070	at your your
S0180	yes er which ones be they
S0070	well yeah there's probably quite a few korean
S0180	many s
S0180	yeah obviously need more of them
S0070	i dunno i remember once we talk about it and you be
S0180	there be three together and
S0070	oh
S0180	yes that's it
S0070	i meet er one one time she be ask me she say she have notice that um you often see relationships in london and she say she'd notice it with english language teachers although i didn't know which english language teachers she be she be refer to have more of a connection with japanese students than korean students
S0180	oh yes you mention that before this be not true er
S0070	well i mean i i've be sort of try to figure this out and she she ask me to explain why
S0180	hey hey hey
S0070	sort of think
S0180	do she really ask you that er
S0070	well she sort of say what do you no not that quite like that but you know she sort of say why do you think that be and
S0180	do she know your wife be korean
S0070	i can't remember if i suppose she might
S0180	or maybe or i think it be korea or japan educationally developmentally probably have more in common with uk than south korea do
S0070	i guess so
S0180	because they they've have more um democracy for longer and
S0070	i think so and and i think er as well like a similar you know
S0180	the the the what do you call it the cosmopolitanism of the people
S0070	right
S0180	and the sophistication of the people
S0070	okay okay
S0070	and i think if you look at that sort of they be in the same war as us
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know so there's a kind of post war generation of hard work people who go out and then there's those kid who kind of be a bite kind of more you know
S0180	but it's easy to explain because japan's generation go through the sixties like yoko ono and er but koreans didn't because
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	they have the korean war in the fifties yeah
S0070	it's a it's a bite of a kind of
S0180	they have a till eighty six japan you know have be liberal democracy since the sixties
S0070	yep
S0180	so there you're talk about two generations who've be
S0070	so in term of culture
S0180	through the pop culture you know
S0070	pop culture more in common
S0180	more in common with people yeah
S0070	more sort of common grind
S0180	that's what it's that include
S0070	sorry
S0180	you didn't say that to her
S0070	no well like you know it's be er cos er obviously
S0180	that would've be my explanation
S0070	er i think so
S0180	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0070	but i mean it's difficult to sort of say there's one one
S0180	you can't generalize
S0070	reason you know
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	i mean there's probably quite a number of reason isn't there and like be say yesterday she be talk to a japanese person and at the weekend this japanese person have be to beatrix potter's
S0180	mm
S0070	village and i say yes and that's quite typical of japanese
S0180	yeah
S0070	they're they're interest in these type of things aren't they
S0180	very very english yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0070	yeah they're interest in english culture things
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know not just english probably a lot of things they have a curiosity
S0180	yeah
S0070	which you don't often find with koreans and so and say yeah koreans be fuck savage she say
S0180	she say that oh no
S0180	denigrate your own her own nation
S0070	i i should explain the savage i'd just introduce her
S0180	those be her word
S0070	i'd just introduce her to the term savage
S0180	oh no terrible
S0070	cos she be on about um rough people who come to the market
S0180	oh
S0070	and i say yeah savage so now she's decide
S0180	oh no
S0070	to say it to her friends
S0180	maybe she think of it in term of country bumpkin
S0070	well you see i i think what she and and she sort of explain it
S0180	she mean uncouth or
S0070	a a lot of koreans be really rough
S0180	ah
S0070	really you know once you go outside of seoul or even in seoul you know there's this kind of a like you know the ones you see here be quite sort of
S0180	mm
S0070	de de de de de be be very look very
S0180	small unsophisticated
S0070	no you know there's a lot of when you're actually there and outside of seoul you know it's
S0180	yeah people spit on the pavements and like
S0070	yeah
S0180	like in yeah yeah
S0070	yeah do you know what i mean it's quite rough you know like and and that's what she say she probably say you know korea and china be more similar than korea and japan
S0180	yeah in china
S0070	yeah
S0180	i often have students go oh yeah the quality of those people be not good i say
S0070	oh okay
S0180	what do you mean the quality be not good and they mean things like you know people who spit on pavements and
S0070	mm mm
S0180	shout in restaurants and
S0070	mm mm
S0180	elbow
S0070	and there's a lot of that
S0180	yeah
S0070	they don't have the kind of and i suppose japan as well have a quite a lot of a lot of doesn't it
S0180	it do doesn't it
S0070	and like
S0180	yeah
S0070	so we have some japanese guy i think i i've say to you he come round a few months ago
S0180	japan's the other extreme isn't it
S0070	yeah
S0070	he bring round a box of um he be come round to look at some of 's um er clothe
S0180	oh right clothe yeah
S0070	and he come round and he bring sort of
S0180	sample
S0070	yeah a box of rice crackers
S0180	oh
S0070	and it be wrap up
S0180	wrap yeah
S0070	and tie up
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	and perfect like this and then inside each wrap rice cracker and she you know she say you know and and that's what's the difference between japan and korea newspaper
S0180	but but but that's it's but it's interest that you say that because the er i have a i've have a lot of er teach with chinese and korean students and they do admire that a lot of japan
S0070	mm mm mm
S0180	even though they've get all this war history and they they
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	they don't like that side of things but they all seem to admire japanese
S0070	mm
S0180	culture societies
S0070	and and and so like be say as well you know and and you have similar things like with er you know we can be quite particular about
S0180	yeah
S0070	things like this as well can't we you know if you go out sort of not so much in london cos that's a bite rough but you know
S0180	mm
S0070	there be you know we do like to do little nice little quaint things don't we
S0180	yeah
S0070	and i think the japanese
S0180	quaint
S0070	quite like yeah
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	and um but quaint and korea don't really sit comfortably together
S0070	you know they're quite sort of you know they'll go out and they'll sit and like oh they'll eat
S0180	loud
S0070	you know eat be what
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know get to go and be loud get drink and eat you know and um
S0180	which some people might find refresh
S0070	sure yeah
S0180	er you know yeah because it's not er the stereotype
S0070	well
S0180	reserve and
S0070	exactly you know and it be nice and you know they're they're not sort of you know just not all sort of watch each other and oh look he hold his fork like this or
S0180	down to everything be down to earth
S0070	exactly
S0180	yeah
S0070	get stick in and they don't care about
S0180	but your wife doesn't see it as down to earth
S0070	um she well she's kind of like i i think it's
S0180	embarrass by it
S0070	i don't know she i think she's kind of i dunno i think she
S0180	she get very self conscious about um
S0070	i suppose er i suppose well it's like you know when you go away from your
S0180	just it's like see british tourists in the south of spain
S0070	exactly
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know and it it it's when you
S0180	order fish and chip and
S0070	stand outside
S0180	yeah
S0070	of your culture
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know i suppose once you're there you don't notice it but you know now she's be over here
S0180	or americans watch american tourists abroad
S0070	yeah exactly
S0180	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0070	you know you you start to notice things that you don't notice when you're there
S0180	and you think oh my god be we really like that
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's yeah it's understandable
S0070	yeah
S0180	no that's good i mean it's a good skill to have i mean
S0070	it be
S0180	mean she mean she's very aware isn't she
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	cos some people be totally unaware of that
S0070	yeah yeah cos i think she be quite shock by a lot of her you know cos a lot of koreans do come and they stick to er i i remember
S0180	yeah
S0070	she be in in melbourne like a couple of years ago and again she be quite shock by koreans there and she say that they kind of just come and they just settle and they don't give a fuck about anyone else around them
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	and just carry on as if they're in korea
S0180	as if they're in korea yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0070	you know sit down you know wear flip flop and sort of like sit down at table like this and ch ch ch to waiters and all this and you know they're completely oblivious of of
S0180	wow
S0070	what of how they
S0180	cos they've be such a homogenize nation for so long
S0070	i suppose and they don't really look out it's it's odd you know they don't look outside
S0180	yeah
S0070	themselves you know and and they don't
S0180	they don't see other people as sort of
S0070	they don't and and as you say it's refresh
S0180	mm
S0070	cos when you go to a restaurant they don't care who's there there there you know they they're not sort of like oh what be they eat they just get down and they just eat what they eat
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	and that's it they don't they don't look around they're not interest
S0180	not curious about anything
S0070	they're not
S0180	yeah
S0070	not curious and not but not also not inhibit by people
S0180	no
S0070	either
S0180	mm
S0070	you know so you know like i say you know we're always a bite sort of self conscious you know especially if there's a table next to you they don't they don't care who's there you know they could be sit there
S0070	you know they're they're just nothing to them
S0180	really
S0070	and that's kind of good in a way but also a bite weird because they do transfer that purport that and 's pick up on that you know that she do these things herself for example
S0180	no but it's a it's a part of certain culture though isn't it
S0070	mm
S0180	like it's like you say the family bubble and outside the family bubble
S0070	mm
S0180	be the people be non persons you know
S0070	yes
S0180	almost
S0070	yes
S0180	there's no
S0070	mm
S0180	consciousness of the
S0070	no no
S0180	wider community isn't it
S0070	and and and i sometimes feel that i'm part of one of those non persons
S0180	mm
S0070	you know i don't kind of figure because i'm just the i know a guy who's who's marry to a a japanese woman and he say that he get it a bite
S0180	mm
S0070	often when he go to japan
S0180	mm
S0070	he's the kind of
S0180	the outsider
S0070	the person who doesn't really you don't need to figure in these decisions
S0180	even though you're family
S0070	or and he's black as well
S0180	oh really that's that's an interest
S0070	so he kind of doesn't really
S0180	yeah cos they're even more quite
S0070	yeah
S0180	prejudice aren't they
S0070	yeah
S0180	skin colour and
S0070	yeah
S0180	that's yeah that must be interest
S0070	so it's it it's and it be funny you know like i say about the the whole education thing when the the nephew's over here you know they wouldn't think of of of ask me my opinion on it cos i don't really figure in their world
S0180	and what i find most sad be lack of curiosity
S0070	mm
S0180	cos i think certain time in my in i mean it happen everywhere but in er every culture but i felt that when i be in china it's or er the students i teach here total lack of curiosity about other people
S0070	mm
S0180	and ways of do things
S0070	mm mm
S0180	and
S0070	mm
S0180	in this sort of bubble
S0070	mm
S0180	so the lack of awareness
S0070	mm
S0180	just astound actually
S0070	it be and and what what be and what what what i've i've often think you know that that that for koreans it's probably like a self almost self protection but
S0180	mm
S0070	you know have the history that they've have you know like with their you know they're so proud of it
S0180	they've always be in in between japan and
S0070	exactly
S0180	china yeah
S0070	you know and when japan
S0180	mm
S0070	colonize and
S0180	mm
S0070	and they ban their like their hairstyle and their write and things like this
S0180	the national psyche
S0070	exactly you know
S0180	mm
S0070	and and
S0180	so what be 's be she upset that
S0070	i don't think so she be just curious er or maybe she
S0180	but how do she know cos you can't that's a bite of an assumption to make isn't it
S0070	i think that i well i dunno
S0180	that's what she observe
S0070	i suppose so i suppose which be
S0180	in the street
S0070	yeah er so i suppose she be quite observant for a korean
S0180	mm
S0070	in that in that sense i don't know i don't know
S0180	it's funny because they they often complain about teachers to me
S0070	do they
S0180	they they didn't like they didn't like um the new zealand girl and i say oh i mean it's it's so subject you know er her name be
S0180	short blonde girl
S0070	okay
S0180	but she be they felt she wasn't good enough to teach them or er she wasn't do it properly or whatever but it's so subjective when you're in that position
S0070	yeah
S0180	and you get students come to you and you think oh i don't like her i don't it's really awkward be academic manager
S0070	there be a south african guy that they use to
S0180	oh yeah he be
S0070	more as well
S0180	he be late all the time
S0070	be he
S0070	you see er but see it make you wonder because
S0180	he be bad
S0070	be he
S0180	yeah
S0070	you have no idea what they say about anyone do they
S0180	i know yeah
S0070	cos they you know
S0180	yeah
S0070	you kind of think oh you know i i appreciate your you know sort of
S0180	candour yeah
S0070	er er and and you know that you're share this information with me but i wonder what information you share about me with other you know
S0180	yeah
S0070	you kind of do wonder about cos
S0180	it's awkward isn't it you know
S0070	cos i remember the er like i cos i know that koreans er er er again they've get a particular idea of what be you know they're not they're not flexible
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	they're not kind of oh i don't you know they're not i mean okay teacher i'll go with you sort of thing you know they've get clear ideas of what a a lesson should be i mean i remember one of 's friends come and and she want to know how to she's be here about eight years and she still can't speak english and a few years ago she go through a stage where she want to to to learn english but she didn't want to sit and have lessons she want me to to write typical answer that she might get
S0070	on the you know in a in a dialogue situation but how the fuck can i do that you know so so like er cos she be work with at the time so if someone come up and say oh how much be this that dress be forty five pound
S0180	she want you to write it down
S0070	well she want yeah so she'd have all of these phrase which she could just kind of okay that one's
S0180	oh no too logical too logical
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	think far too logically about it
S0070	exactly and and and the and and the that's
S0180	use a different expression slightly different word
S0070	no it's because they do everything by memory don't they
S0180	yeah
S0070	they want to memorise everything yeah exactly so if someone have use a different word er do i tell you when we be in spain me and back last year there be a there be an american woman and she be teach two waiters some some english and it's it be er hello my name be duh duh duh duh how be you i'm fine thank and they come they notice that me and be speak english so they come over and they want to practise
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	and the guy say hello my name be duh duh duh how be you and i say yeah i'm great thank and you
S0180	blank stare
S0070	and he just
S0180	er
S0070	look at his piece of paper and what right hang on the
S0180	oh really huh
S0070	that's not the response that and so but like this you know
S0180	mm
S0070	and they want to have these rehearse
S0180	dialogues
S0070	dialogues
S0180	yeah
S0070	that they can just memorise and
S0180	that be the problem with dialogues in book
S0070	yeah
S0180	they don't reflect er real er
S0070	not at all
S0180	life
S0070	no no
S0180	often
S0070	no so when you do have students who who do try and memorise them when there's something but it's funny because perhaps in korean cos english i be think about this this morning like
S0180	be korean more formulaic
S0070	well perhaps so cos i be think about italian this morning cos i be er easter monday we visit this italian chap that we know and and i be listen to to give his wife a er er a jacket and she say to her husband oh and i think oh that's really you know we like this and i think that's really odd isn't it because that such a kind of formulaic expression
S0180	yeah
S0070	that you know you see it all the time in and and i think we
S0180	well certain languages might be more formulaic
S0070	some might languages might
S0180	yeah
S0070	and i wonder if er italian's a bite like so when they answer the phone it's always er
S0180	well they be cos
S0180	yeah yeah cos in in japan you have certain what be it formal way of speak
S0070	okay
S0180	to strangers that you don't use with or
S0070	okay
S0180	something like that
S0070	right right
S0180	but in some culture yeah you don't use certain word it's like english be not like that be it
S0070	no i'd say not we we tend to sort of i i don't know i mean er it it would be quite interest wouldn't it to sort of have a look a bite more closer er i don't know enough about korean or italian to say so but you know there be kind of i would say they're a lot more fix
S0180	there be there it's formulaic in every language but it's more
S0070	yeah sure sure
S0180	fix in some than others
S0070	yeah like like
S0180	so you know
S0070	like when they're on
S0180	yeah
S0070	italians on the telephone they'll often say sort of like when they want to like listen to like so it's listen to me you know
S0180	ah
S0070	and it's quite and and and i don't think i've ever hear anyone speak on a phone who hasn't say that
S0180	mm
S0070	at the begin of a conversation
S0070	very different
S0070	you know
S0180	in japan they say moshi moshi
S0070	yeah and and then
S0180	yeah
S0070	duh duh duh duh but i wonder if you know we would say you know
S0180	in china you would say wait wait
S0070	okay and then what what could we say
S0180	but in england you don't have to say that you could say hi hello
S0070	ah yeah mm
S0180	er how can i help you
S0070	yeah
S0180	yep
S0070	oh okay
S0180	what's up
S0070	but i mean more than just the initial it it's more than just the initial kind of greet
S0180	mm
S0070	it's the kind of like you know hi ah i'm just call you
S0180	mm
S0070	or rather than listen to me
S0180	mm
S0070	you know or you know or hello listen to me
S0180	yeah
S0070	or hi listen you know and they seem to have that sort of introduction bite you know so not just the greet bite but the the whole next stage you know
S0180	there still be things that be inappropriate though aren't there we wouldn't start say like um you there
S0070	yeah
S0180	to your boss you know you'd say oh you'd say oh excuse me
S0070	yeah
S0180	or er
S0070	yeah i'm just surely because ner ner ner ner ner ner yeah sort of like wonder
S0180	doesn't exist in english but it's different it's it's er
S0070	yes
S0180	you have to learn the convention don't you
S0070	i think so
S0180	for the language
S0070	and i and i would say there's a lot i dunno i dunno
S0180	er the those people be probably
S0070	i just just have a feel
S0180	probably translate their formal convention into english and it doesn't work
S0070	right mm
S0180	so the korean learner be try to maybe in korean you can learn some formulaic phrase and she be try to replicate that
S0070	perhaps so
S0180	in english
S0070	and that's what i mean
S0180	yeah
S0070	perhaps in service transaction okay there be there be form
S0180	yeah
S0070	there be a a er a generic structure to a
S0180	like can i help you yeah
S0070	yeah yeah but but maybe it be more formulaic in some languages than others you know
S0180	but also the student be not aware of how language work
S0070	right
S0180	no matter what background they're from cos you might have learners english speakers try to do that in another language as well
S0070	mm
S0180	can you write down some sentence for me and then they
S0070	mm mm
S0180	they get the same problem
S0070	yeah
S0180	so it might not be a problem with the language background of the person but it's the er the student's lack of awareness about how language work
S0070	mm
S0180	and that could be from any cultural background
S0070	true
S0180	you know
S0070	and indeed it's also a a a mistake that coursebook writers make themselves
S0180	yeah
S0070	and i be think today about about this you know how we we we give students a list of word or phrase and we say okay now i want you to put those into a dialogue
S0180	mm
S0070	forget that the dialogue be actually interactive and and what you say
S0180	negotiate yeah
S0070	what depend on what i say and depend and so we we might have these phrase but we're never gonna get them into the dialogue because our dialogue be be do its own thing kind of thing
S0180	yeah that's right yeah yeah inform doesn't it each part er inform the next part don't they
S0070	inform the next part
S0180	mm
S0070	yeah rather than okay hang on a minute we've gotta go back cos i've gotta use this expression here
S0180	yeah there be a lot of activities like that aren't there
S0070	there be yeah
S0070	yeah so you make you try and build a dialogue around these kind of word and phrase sort of like with the deduction thing it might be a
S0180	but it's like the lesson sequence isn't it it's like well here's the language presentation now use it
S0070	now use it yeah
S0180	free practice control practice
S0070	yeah
S0180	and it be artificial in that way
S0070	it be because the free practice isn't really that free cos you have the teacher stand over you and every time they say you know ah yesterday i go cinema brilliant yesterday i go cinema yeah i go cinema brilliant and you're like
S0070	go cinema
S0180	i never correct much though in
S0070	i didn't because it doesn't
S0180	because it doesn't work number one
S0070	no of course
S0180	something's not happen in their in their cognition
S0070	yeah
S0180	to to recognise it as a mistake
S0070	yes
S0180	and that's
S0070	well that's that's the fault of the
S0180	you you're not gonna correct it by orally correct it
S0070	i don't think so and i no and i suppose there's be er probably a lot of research do on that but but that's the fall down of of that ppp sort of approach and its many
S0180	mm
S0070	manifestations be that you know okay er you can try it now to do practice and hope that they integrate those
S0180	mm
S0070	but to to pass or fail someone on their teach practice as to whether or not they use those form be a bite unfair really unless you're gonna stand over them beat the beat them with a stick if they don't use them you know
S0180	cos it always seem quite labour doesn't it and i i
S0070	yeah
S0180	that's why i give up on a lot of the techniques i think oh this be not not that it's too much hard work it's too much of the wrong hard work
S0070	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and it's not effective
S0070	yes
S0180	it's just it's not work be it
S0070	yeah
S0180	so you're think hang on a minute i must be do something wrong here
S0070	yes
S0180	you know
S0070	no that's quite an interest way of put it it's too much of the wrong hard work
S0180	yeah
S0070	there's nothing wrong with hard work
S0180	no no and anything of value be from hard work
S0070	yeah
S0180	but
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's you know when you're it's like beat your head against a wall
S0070	yeah
S0180	and you you
S0070	yeah
S0180	it hurt and you're not do anything
S0070	no no
S0180	you're just hurt yourself
S0070	and and a lot of the time er the students don't even pick up on those differences you know when er like that go go from er
S0180	yeah
S0070	it's you know they don't they're not listen to it and i be talk to er the er the italian lad and i be say about like you know if you've get you know they have you know if you if you use different verb end you know so so instead of sort of i go you know and you use a different end for he go you know
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	do it do it really inhibit mean and he say well no of course not it's just it's just not grammatically correct
S0180	it just doesn't sound right yeah yeah
S0070	and so what really be if you're if you're focus on sort of try to get mean out what's the point in bang on
S0180	yeah
S0070	their head because they make a small grammatical error oh
S0180	cos you listen to people like at your um tut you know if you listen i listen to the world service a lot and if you listen to the experts and you know um ambassadors or whatever people very high up in their job
S0070	mm
S0180	who be non native english speakers they often make small mistake
S0070	yeah so er
S0180	but it it hasn't
S0070	yeah
S0180	it it doesn't detract
S0070	no not at all
S0180	at all
S0070	not at all
S0180	they've get a wonderful vocabulary they know
S0070	yeah
S0180	they can understand a hundred
S0070	yeah
S0180	a hundred percent of what they be
S0070	yeah
S0180	listen to and they're just make those odd
S0070	yeah
S0180	mistake and and they're the top of their profession
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	so do it matter that they don't
S0180	yeah it doesn't it doesn't have any bear that they
S0070	mm mm
S0180	miss the s off now and again
S0070	exactly
S0180	or
S0070	and how many time have you see that on you know they say okay put an s in the corner of the board and a square round it
S0180	oh i haven't see that
S0070	it's a place an s you know so you've get it up there on the board and you've get your long beat stick
S0180	oh really
S0070	and students
S0180	i haven't see that method
S0070	oh teacher and i'd say tell me about your friend ah my friend er he like er football
S0180	ah ah you point it
S0070	ah
S0180	you don't beat him with a stick
S0070	he like no
S0070	not the first time
S0070	ah he like er like like
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	okay er he like football and so okay so tell me something else er every week he watch er inter milan
S0180	and this go on and on and on and on
S0070	match inter milan match yeah and it go on and on and on so in the end you do beat them with the stick
S0070	or break it over your head or find the person who tell you to put the s on the board and stick it up their jacksy
S0180	oh right cos they they have to recognize it first don't they they have to hear
S0070	yeah
S0180	if they're not hear it they're not gonna correct themselves be they
S0070	and and the thing be no sure and and and also if you've get load of students in the room and they're say things and the other students be be join in you know he like he like inter milan ruh boo boo
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	you know
S0180	they're not think about the grammar yeah
S0070	the they they're not think about oh but he miss an s off they they know what he's say he like
S0180	unless that's an aim of the activity
S0070	unless er yes unless that's what you're there for to to be a pedant
S0180	no what be i gonna say i be try to think of something just then about the s um yeah cos obviously not in i've do a lot of dictations i do a lot of dictations in my last couple of years of teach and i think
S0070	oh
S0180	i mean it be so obvious because they would they would not hear it
S0070	okay
S0180	like i'd play the tape like or the cd like with them three or four time and none of them could hear what what they be not hear and and it be all things like miss an a
S0070	oh
S0180	miss an s and er none of them could hear a the weak form of a
S0070	which be gonna always gonna be problematic
S0180	yeah
S0070	in english isn't it
S0180	but the the the how i mean no matter how many time i play it
S0070	mm
S0180	they just couldn't hear it and that be so reveal to me because it make me realise that they just couldn't hear
S0070	say say say for
S0180	he he he go
S0070	yeah say
S0180	they they would write he go
S0070	okay so you say a sentence then with he go in it
S0180	um
S0070	think of a kind of fairly long sentence and say it duh duh duh duh
S0180	he er usually go to the supermarket on wednesdays and thursdays to buy newspapers and milk
S0070	go so z z be
S0180	the z the z sound be there
S0070	but that's a voice sound isn't it
S0180	yeah okay
S0070	okay so what
S0180	it's always voice isn't it he go
S0070	yeah so z like so er he like s s s
S0180	oh i'm sorry
S0070	be unvoiced be it
S0180	yeah yeah yeah
S0070	so
S0180	because he like he like
S0070	he like to watch he like he like to watch
S0180	cos it be a very soft s s
S0070	exactly so if it's unvoiced
S0180	hiss sound
S0070	then it's possible that it's um
S0180	yeah
S0070	missable isn't it
S0180	ah you're right yeah
S0070	i dunno i dunno
S0180	he like
S0070	cos he's sort of think that
S0180	yeah
S0070	ah my sister she really like to go um
S0180	yeah if it's quick speech they don't hear it
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and the other one which always flummox them be the um i have be when it be contract i've be yeah i've be there and they would write i be
S0070	i be
S0180	i be
S0070	i be
S0180	i be yeah they would not hear i've i've be it's the contract form be not
S0070	no and it's arguable i mean the whole point of that be be be er it's an auxiliary isn't it so
S0180	yeah
S0070	but you can you can retrieve the mean
S0180	but it er change the whole tense
S0070	it it do but i mean you can retrieve mean from i be really can't you you know where's
S0180	yeah
S0070	where be where the stress be
S0180	that's true
S0070	i be
S0180	that's true
S0070	i've be
S0180	and if you say the time i be there
S0070	yeah
S0180	no if you're use present imperfect you wouldn't say the date though would you cos it's experience you wouldn't say
S0070	yeah
S0180	i've be there yesterday
S0070	ah i've be there hundreds of time
S0180	yeah
S0070	i've be hundreds of time i be
S0180	i be cos in some languages you would say i be
S0070	i be i be er
S0180	or i've be doesn't exist do it
S0070	no no no
S0180	mm but i be some west country
S0070	yeah
S0180	old english i be i be
S0070	you alright i be brilliant
S0180	yeah
S0070	but yes i mean i be the manager of yeah
S0180	i mean in some dialects the grammar change doesn't it
S0070	yeah yeah yeah but you know it do sort of make you think you know what what why be we mean
S0180	the the interest the i think for exam pass it matter maybe not for general use
S0070	sure sure sure yeah
S0180	but exam cos when i when i play these tap to the three korean girls they really enjoy have their awareness raise
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	cos i i i point this out to them i've be and they say oh that's what it be er they'd never think of it before
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and it actually direct their attention
S0070	yeah
S0180	towards it
S0070	and i think that's more valuable than actually
S0180	be valuable
S0070	sort of try to just er make them repeat it
S0180	but then a lot of language teach be about raise awareness
S0070	yeah sure
S0180	isn't it
S0070	sure yeah
S0180	it's not about explicitly teach something
S0070	oh no
S0180	it's about raise well it be in a way but you're raise awareness of
S0070	mm
S0180	what
S0070	mm
S0180	what's there
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	in the language
S0070	mm rather than get er people to repeat it parrot parrot fashion
S0180	oh i hate drill i don't do drill it it never work in big class cos everyone's get different
S0070	yeah
S0180	mastery of pronunciation
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	unless the whole class can't say you know the same pen instead of pin
S0070	come from a language background
S0180	well yeah
S0070	share language background yeah
S0180	but usually you have a a multi lingual class
S0070	i mean er so so glass reflection dress my we be we be give name to
S0180	glass reflection dress
S0070	we be give name to to dress the other day and it there be a
S0180	oh i see yeah yeah
S0070	and and i say glass reflection she be be gonna show to some japanese people and i say well hang on a minute that's a really that's gonna be a really difficult word for a japanese person
S0180	oh yes
S0070	glass reflection dress
S0180	glass glass glass reflection dress
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	and anyway and i the
S0180	glass erection dress
S0070	well exactly you know could have all sort of problems
S0180	yes well
S0070	and i think er but why be i say this but like like i mean she'll she's be here how long and she'll still make those l l
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know l r
S0180	yes i notice that
S0070	things
S0180	when she speak
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	and same with
S0180	quite strong pronounce
S0070	or whatever it be or v v and b you know
S0180	yeah
S0070	they're still they're still there after ten years of say it
S0180	it's only if she really want to change it because she's get a good er ability i would think
S0070	yeah yeah exactly when she's speak fluently you know it's always always but it'll you know it it'll come in quite easily because
S0180	on the phone it would be a problem
S0070	i suppose so er you know when and but then when people sort of say sorry you sort of say er oh l you know she's able to kind of you know
S0180	l for
S0070	lima
S0180	lima yeah
S0070	yeah and that's how you get round it cop strategies aren't they
S0180	and and that that er non native speakers they use that alphabet
S0070	yeah when i say um road people often don't sorry gate
S0180	yeah
S0070	and then they don't know how to spell it
S0180	and then you say you spell it out
S0180	that's the skill of language isn't it
S0070	yeah
S0180	i mean you say l for lima
S0070	yeah
S0180	mm
S0070	so even if you're a native speaker you you know there's still
S0180	yeah
S0070	difficulties in you know cos people have different dialects accent
S0180	cos then but cos we're teach communication that's the skill to teach isn't it
S0070	that's the skill isn't it yeah
S0180	and the um tut morse code no it's not um romeo charlie foxtrot there's a word for it isn't there
S0070	there be a word for it alpha
S0180	semaphore be the flag
S0070	yeah
S0180	oh god it's go now
S0070	mm
S0180	international

S0180	that's different isn't it that one
S0070	indian pale ale
S0180	yeah
S0180	no
S0070	yeah no there be a name but i i remember cos last summer it be the first time i'd ever actually teach it and i and um
S0180	yeah it's teach it to students though isn't it
S0070	it be it be
S0180	from what
S0070	it be
S0180	but that never feature on
S0070	no no never at all and it's more important than teach you know sort of just sort i remember in in language textbooks
S0180	lessons for it
S0070	well you could but
S0180	what be zulu what be a zulu yeah
S0070	well exactly i mean you could do
S0070	you could be dance round the build dance
