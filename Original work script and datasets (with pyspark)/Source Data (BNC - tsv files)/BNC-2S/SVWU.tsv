S0336	so have the erm boy online be get a bite of an ear bash then be it literally just the three of them that be talk about
S0337	a lot of people be say no
S0336	yeah
S0337	erm
S0336	and and i mean be it be it people from the uk or people from america like and just for the sake of like get on board with it
S0337	china there's no one from fuck china on our forums
S0336	no that's china
S0337	why'd you say it
S0336	from like abroad
S0337	china not china though
S0337	where do you think we be
S0336	i don't know obviously it's like primarily like us people on that forum isn't it
S0337	erm we be almost all us europe and australia slash new zealand
S0336	okay so these people that have be kind of say no when he's say yes what's be they from the uk from scotland or
S0337	er there's quite a lot of people from australia get involve actually
S0336	yeah
S0337	with it
S0336	have you see i saw a mock up the other day and i and i realise again it's all like propaganda stuff but i saw a mock up of what like flag we might have to choose if scotland go
S0337	yeah that's right that's right
S0336	and they've get like the wallabies haven't they on erm
S0337	oh no i've not see that
S0336	oh
S0337	i've see the actual
S0336	oh i haven't see any of the i think it's quite funny cos
S0337	the union jack but the blue's actually green erm there's some other stuff with just white and erm cross and cross
S0336	yeah but with the blue take out basically
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah it be quite embarrass erm it must have be like from the last general election but i follow the lib dems on facebook
S0337	really
S0336	and erm they share something the other day which be like oh you know share this if you don't want britain to look like this and what they've do be like they'd erm they'd get like a map of the uk and like just cut it short obviously without scotland there but then like in the background they have like the union jack and like there's a load of scottish people be like it wouldn't look like this it would have blue like blah blah blah kind of miss the point a bite in that they be just talk about like
S0337	yeah
S0336	the shape of the uk or whatever but like it be like petty little things like that though that make you realise that actually like to try and untie scotland from the rest of the uk
S0337	be a lot of work
S0336	be such work yeah it's gonna be huge and i'm annoy that it's gonna be as huge as it be cos i i really don't know how it's manage to gain such momentum like i think it's laziness on the part of like
S0337	the no campaign
S0336	down street yeah absolutely like for them to to have let it gain such momentum be a fault on their part isn't it
S0337	there's so much more i want to go off on but i've not read enough about it so
S0336	no well that's the thing and like like
S0337	perhaps not like matter
S0336	i feel like half educate about it to be fair and i haven't do enough research but if i be in scotland right now i would know my facts like how else would you be able to vote if you hadn't do your research like they it it's just such such a define vote that you wouldn't vote without think would you i be frankly surprise though that a lot of the older generation do seem to be sway towards no when in theory
S0337	yes the
S0336	yeah which kind of show that there isn't a lot of strength in in what's be say cos i feel like
S0337	right well where's that be that me
S0336	never mind
S0336	i'll have a look at the form thing topic after dinner
S0336	why no idea
S0337	no no it make sense though
S0336	i'm a bite piss off that erm the ultrasound thing be a bite of a fail
S0337	erm yeah
S0336	do it feel like a waste of your afternoon
S0337	yeah he didn't even he didn't even look at the right like if that make sense
S0336	why be he a dick then what happen
S0337	oh he just walk in stick his out bite of a not really give a shit like like the space erm what else be there erm didn't really ask many question just start just start do it the nurse be nice she's nice enough
S0336	yeah
S0337	but she start i ask if i be allow to eat she say you shouldn't've quite young to be honest erm so you shouldn't've i don't really normally do this i normally get mri
S0336	mm mm
S0337	at the keep i keep type
S0336	mir yeah i know i didn't that
S0337	anyhow erm she be like yeah i don't really work here normally work on the other department but you know i just have to come here and just be an assistant once in a while okay should i have eat no you shouldn't have eat i be like okay well i have a banana for breakfast and then i realise i shouldn't have i've have a coffee today she's like mm that's okay erm normally when we look at the gallbladder if you eat something fatty and it empty the gallbladder i'm think my gallbladder for that's not be mention before i i didn't say anything so oh right okay great erm obviously have the ultrasound on the stomach and he be look all the way up here all the way down my right side all the way round the top and i'm think
S0336	that's not where
S0337	that's not where it's be an issue i'm just sit there like okay and he's like no i didn't find anything great so it all look normal yeah yeah it all look normal great he just didn't like ask enough question
S0336	that's
S0337	yeah erm but yeah i wasn't there for long as you can tell i be really quick
S0336	that's good and at least it mean you didn't have to stay too late either
S0337	at work
S0336	yeah
S0337	well it be absolutely fine today i just
S0336	i be actually think today that you've be load better recently though
S0337	yeah erm it's cos 's pick up er drop off er give to a load of old so erm
S0336	no i mean i mean with your tummy and stuff
S0337	oh tummy yeah yeah yeah yeah i guess
S0336	i didn't really i don't really feel like you've be complain anywhere near as much
S0337	i think you mean like finish work
S0336	no no no i just mean that actually like erm we be we obviously we still need to find out what be wrong so we can do stuff but like i feel like some of the advice he's already give you like to cut down on like the fizzy drink and sugar and all that kind of stuff like i know you're still have it but
S0337	not as much
S0336	it be help yeah exactly it be help have like reduce it a little bite
S0337	it's the fruit juice i think
S0336	do you know interestingly enough i've actually read a couple of things this week about fructose cos like quite well everybody be now jump on the bandwagon of say it's like the worst thing in the world erm
S0337	well look as you can tell when like lactose be the worst thing in
S0336	yeah
S0337	erm lactose free stuff's everywhere
S0336	yeah
S0337	might be fructose next so i'm just always ahead of the game
S0336	yeah
S0337	or just slightly ahead
S0336	well that be one way to look at it i suppose
S0337	well yeah cos with the lactose stuff you couldn't get that milk you could only get it in green and it wasn't always there
S0336	no
S0337	you couldn't get the other stuff the other stuff you could get be like actually dairy free stuff sort of like
S0336	as in like soy stuff yeah
S0337	yeah erm and now lactose free stuff's everywhere
S0336	yeah and i mean that i mean that's really good for those that be like properly lactose intolerant they're like the lactose free stuff their range have increase load and actually it the point where there's such a market for it that compare to can actually start
S0337	do you want
S0336	yeah jump in and bring out new products which can only bode well because it take me age enough to find like a vanilla ice cream that you could eat
S0337	oh yeah
S0336	which be nice but like every once in a while you want something a little bite more excite than vanilla so it'd be nice for people to have a lactose free choices rather than simply be like oh well this be this be the lacto free choice do you know what i mean
S0337	yep i erm just try to work with but anyway back to work stuff
S0336	mm mm
S0337	erm yeah i've not be too busy obviously we've get i think it's five order that be really bad shit just hit the fan and i've get that other customer that's just cause me a bite of leg ache
S0336	mm mm
S0337	i'm gonna speak to about it and see if he can help out or give us some advice
S0336	well you've still get a fair bite of holiday to take between now and christmas as well haven't you so
S0337	yeah
S0336	try and get try and work yourself into a position where you can actually afford to have
S0337	oh erm try glastonbury next year i know i've just come back and
S0336	oh there's no way i wanna commit to that right now
S0337	no you have to though sometime

S0336	well i think she be try to imply that this loner coder type thing probably have like a fairly nice set up at home
S0337	yeah
S0336	and i say yeah but that's why he's a loner like the nicer you make stuff at home like if you create yourself this like awesome bat cave that have everything you could possibly wanna do you're never gonna leave your house like that's so not healthy
S0337	god it's so hot sit here with that i really wanna put the fan on but can't
S0336	erm this be really like greasy

S0337	mm
S0336	don't know how much of this you actually need that seem like quite a lot of hard cheese

S0336	because there's only one day before i get pay
S0336	erm what be i gonna say might try the train next week
S0337	for real
S0336	yeah i'm just wonder whether like maybe do the train like once or twice a week will just break up the monotony of the drive a little bite
S0337	today
S0336	it wasn't that bad in the grand scheme of things but
S0336	it's just not a very its not very fun and like certainly not very fun on your own and it's quite bore and you know at least if i get the train i would have a nice walk to and from the train station so it'd give me a bite of exercise or what have you and i'd probably get like the ten past eight train in and be in work for like quarter past nine and then i'd be able to get the five o'clock train home hopefully so i'll be home for like six so my work day'll shift ever so slightly on those two days
S0337	as long as you're happy
S0336	i don't know i'm just gonna try and try a few things out
S0337	it's so hot
S0336	erm i think we're gonna end up have a really busy weekend
S0337	why oh we've get oh

S0337	should be easy they probably plug in to a usb port into your car somehow
S0336	yeah
