S0529	mm
S0530	and i don't want to have to buy an outfit really so you know if he want to buy me dress dress he will buy me by the way if you want anything this be your chance
S0529	seriously
S0530	yeah yeah jump in
S0529	mm
S0529	don't think i want a dress though i
S0530	oh yeah that's the thing like he's like i want to buy dress i'm like i want coat i want jeans
S0529	yeah i'll have a quick look i'm not gonna
S0530	go on have a look
S0530	have a look
S0529	it's not really but i don't know
S0530	i mean i don't know if he'll buy it on this one but you know if this turn out to be a regular thing i'll make sure he'll get you a nice dress
S0529	well you haven't get two hundred pound have you
S0530	no i haven't
S0529	why be it not work i hate this laptop

S0529	break me out i don't like it
S0530	you know go down like that
S0529	yeah but i need to look at all of them and i i don't what do i want i don't want a bodycon
S0530	you want a like a
S0529	oh why be it not work
S0530	you have to double click it
S0529	oh my god i don't like it
S0530	yeah this be

S0529	my god this be so frustrate
S0530	he say give me fifteen minutes and i'll look and i'm like okay sure why not why not my friend
S0530	if he do buy it i'm gonna laugh i'm gonna laugh so hard i could technically get the dress and not pay for the picture and just delete him
S0529	yeah that's i think that's what the plan be
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos he probably won't ask for and he probably won't pay you for the picture
S0530	no
S0529	cos he pay for the clothe
S0530	pay for clothe
S0529	that's the deal isn't it
S0530	but what if he could track me down somehow how could he track me down
S0529	he wouldn't be able to
S0530	i could just delete everything and be like
S0529	yeah
S0530	wa
S0529	that's kind of the beauty of it really isn't it cos you haven't give anyone your bank detail or anything so i mean even if you give somebody your bank detail all they'd be able to do be give you money so it's not really an issue
S0530	no yeah
S0529	these be all hideous
S0530	yeah they be
S0529	who who would wear that
S0530	i know
S0529	that be awful it's like
S0530	it look like a christmas present almost
S0529	it's horrible
S0530	i like the plainer ones not the ones on here but like plainer dress
S0529	yeah i know that's the problem like i'm so not wear any of this stuff like ever this be not my style but i like this website for some stuff cos it's quite cheap and the clothe aren't bad but it's more like i dunno baggy clothe
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	that i'm into oh my god like what
S0530	who
S0529	what be that
S0530	it's thirty five pound
S0529	it's disgust er er that be like so disgust be nice if they just have like a nice slip dress that'd be nice
S0530	i be look for them before but i couldn't really find any
S0529	just see if there's any they're all two shapely and shape things be hideous to me
S0530	just like a slip dress yeah

S0530	oh there's some underwear oh get some fancy underwear from the thingy
S0529	that would be nice it be nice have like a match set or something
S0530	nice underwear yeah lovely erm i could technically log back in and get some underwear let's do that
S0530	he say he'd take ten minutes or something so
S0529	i don't think he'd mind if you be wear undewear i don't
S0530	i don't think he would you know somehow
S0529	new
S0530	unless be quite funny if he be a gay guy just like look nice
S0529	yeah i be wonder that cos the fact that he doesn't want you to buy like you know provocative clothe

S0529	do you want like a drink or something from the kitchen
S0530	erm no thank i'm alright

S0530	yeah i like bras i don't have enough bras let's get some bras
S0529	i don't get this thing where people find bras uncomfortable like
S0530	some be but some be really like more comfy most of the time for me

S0529	treasure it
S0530	like if i i see the my my sister have to hold hers when she go upstairs
S0529	yeah
S0530	and i don't i i wouldn't
S0529	i know i know mine aren't that big but it's just like top and stuff it make it a lot harder
S0530	mm
S0529	cos you can't wear certain things
S0530	cos like you have quite small boob
S0529	mm really
S0530	like really small boob
S0529	they use to be bigger than this it be horrendous horrendous like i use to have like ds
S0530	really
S0529	mm
S0530	wow
S0529	yeah all my family have like massive boob
S0530	what what happen
S0529	i dunno i just kinda like i think i just sort of lose weight just like naturally lose a bite of weight and then you know it come off my boob as well i suppose and now i can
S0530	yeah go off your boob first
S0529	yeah which be kind of annoy but
S0530	log out here we if this become a regular thing though i could get so much clotheslike imagine that i i'm kind of wear this like kind of thing so i just yeah see where i don't like all the sparkly dress
S0529	mm
S0530	erm
S0529	just plain
S0530	i have one lovely sparkly dress at home but it's special but i don't really like them in general
S0529	mm
S0530	but erm
S0529	well you never have a chance to wear them really like what be you gonna wear them for
S0530	i know slip dress here we go well that's that isn't that be a pyjama dress isn't it
S0529	that's horrible
S0530	it's not a proper dress no let's see if i can get a coat oh
S0529	mm that'll be nice
S0530	coat cos i've already get two i just want another one because i'm
S0529	be it just missguided like nothing else
S0530	erm
S0529	not like urban outfitters or topshop or
S0530	i yeah that's what i be think like
S0529	ow my god i nearly die
S0530	i be like how about topshop sir topshop sir
S0529	although topshop's not really that much better than that anyway really
S0530	i'll search topshop because topshop can have some gems erm dress how about topshop can you go can you access topshop in different countries
S0529	erm i imagine so if you can with missguided you probably can with topshop cos it's a bigger like it's more global isn't it
S0530	slip dress you see they have slip er oh i'm imagine they have slip dress here
S0529	oh my aol group be so chummy and i'm just like never talk on it
S0529	i hate that
S0530	they're all like a clan
S0529	yeah but i still get their notifications cos i'm on their group and it's really annoy
S0530	oh my god that's lovely

S0530	some old people can't put weight on though some old people get really skinny
