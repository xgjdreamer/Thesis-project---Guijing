S0058	hmm but i mean the world will continue on the way it's go even if you haven't give it a name
S0179	yeah i'm just curious
S0058	mm
S0179	cos i think it's a really sort of season be quite a quite a vague thing
S0058	yeah i think the thing be like there's some days which be really like this be the epitome of winter or this be the epitome of autumn but a lot of the time in england it's just a sort of ne somewhere in between things
S0179	well just grey
S0058	yeah so a bite grey and cold between autumn and winter and just a bite grey and not very excite between spring and summer that kind of thing
S0179	mm
S0058	so yeah season be sort of vague
S0179	ha a fire station
S0058	hmm
S0179	many many many many
S0058	sorry
S0179	i'm just talk to myself
S0058	huh
S0179	yeah erm another day i think
S0058	yeah i think so
S0179	we're quite early a relatively quick walk
S0058	mm oh
S0179	away
S0058	well yeah that's white
S0179	really how be people wear so much today and not be sort of
S0058	hmm but he have his short on
S0179	yeah okay i'll just go through there so should all sensible people
S0058	hmm oh be this the that the guy have a sign for or be it for the bathroom
S0179	no but but that be fifty miles away
S0058	yeah that's what i think so yeah
S0179	mm just
S0058	hmm mm
S0058	yeah
S0179	okey dokey
S0179	but
S0058	yeah
S0179	the car and get it clean
S0058	i'll clean it what time we get back tonight i'll either hoover it tonight or tomorrow morning
S0179	no i would like you to do it in the daylight please so you can actually see
S0058	alright okay i'll do it tomorrow
S0179	yeah so you don't get a chance to sort of do a crap job of it
S0058	hmm
S0179	or at least when you do a crap job of it i'll be able to no you shouldn't have do this job
S0058	oh
S0179	be that a challenge
S0058	what for me to i'm not even sure what you'd be challenge hmm
S0179	well i'm hop that i've i say you're gonna do a bad job and you won't
S0058	huh right
S0179	just to prove me wrong
S0058	yeah prove you wrong yeah
S0179	to check
S0058	yeah oh sorry yeah i be miles away um
S0179	yes you be
S0058	i be think about the erm there be a sign there for the sort of mini business park say if you saw it it have sort of technical engineer or whatever
S0179	yes i do
S0058	it have a sign there say vacancies you know and it kind of i think oh like a b and b then i think do they mean like job vacancies that they just have on a board outside
S0058	that's quite odd
S0179	it depend if they with the industry as in it depend sort of high tech firm and
S0058	mm there be one that say there's precision engineer but i don't know exactly what that mean
S0179	well that could well be erm
S0058	yeah but i guess that you know if you have a job like in a bar you'd just stick a notice in the window you know apply within so
S0179	yeah
S0058	i guess no reason why not
S0179	because it's a low cost mean of advertise
S0058	low cost
S0179	mean of advertise
S0058	well indeed yeah it's like us just stick um posters round the faculties look for recorders
S0179	yes exactly
S0058	actually i don't think we've get anyone out of that which i'm quite surprise i would have think the students would have be keener
S0179	well we don't want recorders do we
S0058	ha ha it's fine there's plenty but erm yeah i think most people read about it either on our on the cup website or on like a um i think there be a couple of people who respond from
S0179	or on where
S0058	on the on the website or on one of the um it be put up on the university websites
S0179	oh okay
S0058	i think we have it put up on but yeah most people weren't students yeah i would have think that they'd be really keen but yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	for that kind of thing you know the number of people who respond for the survey and
S0179	medical experiment
S0058	well i think well i do a scientific study one where i have to um watch videos and kind of comment on things and i think it be to do with language acquisition or something so there be one where um i be show picture of things and i have to remember word and make link with things it be well you know it be quite interest it be quite fun um and i be pay sort of a tenner for do that
S0179	okay
S0058	well so it be quite good you know i i'd finish my exams and everything and it be like well you know i be there an hour or sort of thing and i i do a couple of and when i be there they say ah and while you're here be you interest in do another one it's easier than this one and we pay the same rate and i go yeah
S0179	easier
S0058	well as in the first task be quite difficult i have to use my brain um for the second one i be tell to watch a video and describe what happen and i think it be to do with the language i use to describe what i'd see so whether i be say there's a man or there be a man or it be or you know the the how what you know what kind of tense mood i be use so that be part of it
S0179	interestingly i haven't there's not be a single car that i've see on our side of the road
S0058	what do they know that we don't
S0179	exactly
S0179	there's not many in the other direction but there have be a few
S0058	yeah
S0179	there be of course you you're travel at a far higher relative speed so and in fact er relative speed cos we're probably only travel at difference and maybe at the most ten miles an hour plus or minus to the vehicles in this direction
S0058	yeah
S0179	travel the relative speed of well over a hundred
S0058	right yes
S0179	a hundred and thirty or so
S0058	right
S0179	so a hundred and forty
S0058	obviously
S0179	so like this be come our direction but not on this road
S0058	yeah
S0179	i wonder how long we can keep this up for
S0058	what and not see one
S0179	yeah
S0058	well it's look good
S0179	ooh
S0058	oh oh it couldn't last see they're like bus you wait age and
S0179	well now the road's straighten out
S0058	ah ha it could explain why
S0179	one two these people say the roads be get busier
S0058	yeah not this one be it really quiet what day be it friday so i think they'd be more people walk about
S0179	if they have be anywhere i think they would be walk about
S0058	mm
S0179	what be they gonna build there
S0058	i don't know be it a
S0179	just a big man
S0058	interest house
S0179	i don't think so
S0058	will be take over the world slowly but surely i wonder who the biggest house builder be
S0179	um i think
S0058	yeah mm i think
S0058	oh yeah they're certainly the most visible i think like i'd hear of them and i hadn't hear of or of
S0058	oh in my accent it would be same as moor rather than moor ha
S0179	oh okay
S0058	i'm sure there's another one as well oh we be talk about you know like book and cook the fact that in some areas some people pronounce them book and cook
S0179	right
S0058	just sort of compare that
S0179	so we haven't actually past any cars
S0058	no
S0179	so be even up the road
S0058	yes erm really hazy
S0058	ha ha indeed not lazy hazy crazy hazy
S0058	hmm
S0179	mm
S0058	what
S0179	this road sign
S0058	hmm yes
S0179	be that a pipe
S0058	wow you never see someone drive with a pipe you very rarely see someone with a pipe unless it's part of a fancy dress costume
S0179	yes indeed
S0058	like if they're be sherlock holmes or something
S0058	do you know anyone who smoke a pipe
S0179	sorry
S0058	do you know anyone who smoke a pipe
S0179	i know somebody who use to smoke but i know i use to know someone who smoke a pipe
S0058	yeah
S0179	er yeah er er er sorry the husband of auntie use to from next door
S0058	oh okay yeah interest
S0179	er yeah he be a pipe smoker i seem to remember
S0058	hmm
S0179	cricket correspondent
S0058	be he
S0179	yeah
S0058	well that's very excite
S0179	well it depend
S0058	ha well yeah true
S0179	well i still know nothing about cricket and i don't understand the game fundamentally
S0058	i'm not sure i do i kind of get the round and i sort of get what's go on but then you extend it to cricket i've get no idea
S0179	i know it's get overs and run and
S0058	yeah i don't know what i don't know how the score work so you have yeah something to something for something
S0179	i think it be either six or twelve ball and over
S0058	oh so what's an over like a round
S0179	yeah but i don't know how any sort of i don't have any sense of how that relate to because you can continue bat for as long as you're not bowl out catch out
S0058	yeah
S0179	so i don't see how overs come into that
S0058	yeah cos yeah surely i assume it finish when the over finish i don't really know
S0179	no you don't
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean the over be relatively short
S0058	yeah exactly mm ha i'm the wrong person to ask ha i never even watch cricket
S0179	i be once invite to go along to a game at lord
S0058	ah excite
S0179	oh it's not a cricket thing it's a
S0058	that's be there cricket
S0179	well there's somewhere in but i don't know if there's anywhere more sort of anywhere rather than just a local venue
S0058	i'm not sure i've i've hear of the oval i think
S0179	yep like i say it's somewhere in
S0058	oh
S0179	but i don't know if it's actually anything else
S0058	okay i'm not sure it ring a bell
S0179	mm
S0058	ah okay but yeah um the original owner of the lord be call lord
S0179	sorry
S0058	the original owner be call thomas lord
S0179	oh okay
S0058	hence the name i didn't what i do know about cricket it mainly come from the album um the ducksworth the ducksworth lewis method um which be a sort of novelty well so it's sort of a concept album all about cricket it's really good but it doesn't really tell you much about cricket
S0179	who's the band
S0058	um the band be call the ducksworth lewis method and i think the album's call that as well
S0179	no no no i i i'm not hear what you're say
S0058	duckworth lewis method it's apparently it's a a rule or a sort of a weird do another way of play or a strategy for play cricket i think
S0179	right
S0058	and duckworth lewis must have be some figure
S0179	yes i guess that it could be a way of bowl i suppose
S0058	yes i be think it's something like that um but yeah that's what the the band be name after after that and yeah i say band it be it's the guy you know the divine comedy
S0179	right
S0058	it's him plus a few friends basically um sort of under another guise
S0179	mm surely that constitute a band
S0058	yeah exactly yeah i mean they're famous for other things so there's a guy from a band call pugwash and but they come all together under this other banner to do this cricket album and it's really good
S0179	well be it famous
S0058	yeah fair enough
S0179	no as in you you might have to tell me who they be
S0058	pugwash
S0179	yeah
S0058	um i don't have anything by them they're just a sort of just a a band i think fairly indie happy indies type stuff
S0179	well that that description doesn't really help
S0058	i i don't really know them very well very much
S0058	hmm tire cyclists by the look of it
S0179	mm
S0058	some non tire cyclists
S0179	oh dear some florescent cyclists fortunately who be leave this road
S0058	hmm mm ha ha
S0058	mm i wouldn't mind dong a sort of er you know like a proper bike ride like a country bike ride
S0179	well you'll have to do that by yourself
S0058	hmm yeah yeah no fancy for it
S0179	no bike
S0058	no but you could hire a bike
S0179	where from
S0058	a bike shop
S0179	bike shop don't just hire bike
S0058	well how about a bike hire place lot of place hire bike out
S0179	where
S0058	hire cycle sorry cycle hire for a start if you want to do one there or where ever you're go they'll be some you know you can go to a place where like that walk we go on have a bike hire place at each end
S0179	oh right i think you just mean randomly round the countryside
S0058	not particularly you can also do that if you want to like at cycle hire the point be that you can hire it for a week or a month or whatever that's why you see them park er out and about quite a lot so kind of students who be on like a language programme or something often hire them and to be honest that's their major market i think
S0179	to be fair you can make up a second hand bike so cheaply i'm surprise it's worth it
S0058	mm true
S0179	cos then you can buy a bike for what twenty thirty quid
S0058	i don't really know what the go rate be probably yeah it might not be very good i mean i think the the idea be that these be all really nice and i think yeah the yeah sort of in people's head if they're not gonna keep something afterwards but no you're probably right it probably be much cheaper just to er to buy one
S0179	and then literally you could probably resell it at no loss
S0058	yeah you can probably pick up something quite reasonable as well probably a decent enough range that you you probably get terrible bike but i imagine you can pick up quite a nice one
S0058	okay
S0179	mm mm
