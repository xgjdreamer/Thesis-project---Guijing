S0623	ah
S0525	and all the baby be cute lie on the little thing yesterday it's funny how the two of them love be on their front isn't it
S0623	oh yeah no they won't go on their back
S0525	yeah and didn't like his
S0623	it's so funny cos you put the you put them two on their front you put him them two on their back him on his front and they just all roll in unison
S0623	that way
S0525	back to where they want to be
S0623	and just doesn't put down just
S0525	she's tiny she's she's get the right name i mean to say that to her
S0623	yeah
S0525	like a flower
S0623	yeah she's bulk out
S0525	very delicate little thing
S0623	she's bulk a lot
S0525	but she look very delicate
S0623	yeah she do and
S0525	to the others
S0623	when she sit it's like this and she's very you put her up on her feet and she's very like this
S0623	and the others be just like
S0525	solid yes
S0623	yeah
S0525	stand yeah yeah
S0623	that's what the extra three pound at birth
S0525	well that's right 's be fine he be er
S0623	mm
S0525	good a good healthy baby boy and he's be really good since then
S0623	yes
S0525	so what do you yeah so you buy your baby wean book what be you gonna look at
S0623	oh i be go to plan when i be go to make more
S0525	food
S0623	yes
S0525	you should maybe if you make your puree again
S0623	yeah
S0525	or your your apple and your pear
S0623	make a little bite more mm
S0525	can you just or can you just mash it down you know when you just when you just
S0623	yes
S0525	when you just cook it in the pan
S0623	mm
S0525	and not puree it then
S0623	yeah
S0525	so
S0623	i need to do apple and pear
S0525	if you can i would
S0525	say do that cos i think even if you come out to bulgaria we could do things like that
S0623	mm yeah
S0525	and they'd be quite easy to make and if he cos we wouldn't have a blender out there but you could do that
S0623	yeah
S0525	and we could do erm pasta
S0623	yeah i've get some good recipes for for pasta sauce and things
S0525	oh have you
S0623	mm
S0525	oh that's good
S0623	so er
S0525	with with
S0623	it's just a case of
S0525	just tomaoey base ones or cheese base ones
S0623	no no it's cheese and chickens and all sort yeah
S0525	cos he can have erm the cheese and presumably the little yogurts and things
S0623	mm
S0525	cos we can buy yogurts out there as well
S0623	yeah yogurts he'll start those those soon
S0525	cos he'll be seven months if you come out to bulgaria
S0623	yeah
S0525	so he'll be onto things like that and just bread
S0623	mm hm yeah i be gonna wait another a couple of weeks for to start the dairy stuff like the yogurt and the cheese
S0525	yeah
S0623	just so he settle down on i be think if he get establish on like three meals a day
S0525	mm hm
S0623	and then i introduce stuff like that then that'll make that'll make sense to me so
S0525	er yeah i mean he's over five months now so like you say
S0623	mm
S0525	some baby at six months be much smaller and
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	so at i think he'll cope fine
S0623	oh yeah definitely mm what i buy some food for him so i'm probably not gonna be here when mind you it might be quarter to five actually
S0525	or for today
S0623	he have erm
S0525	what's he have
S0623	this morning when he wake up three o'clock
S0623	he have some milk
S0525	yeah
S0623	then he have his breakfast be have his breakfast a little bite earlier cos he's be do that wake up just think if he could stop do that wake up and sleep until half past six
S0525	yeah
S0623	i'd get him up and i could get up with him we'd get dress and stuff and then we'd start like seven o'clock
S0525	yeah
S0623	he could have his milk have his breakfast properly
S0525	mm hm
S0623	and then he'd play then cos at the moment he's get up but he's not ready for it cos he's have that early morning one
S0525	yeah
S0623	again if he could just hang on
S0525	yeah
S0623	but i'm just gonna give him another few days till his teeth have settle down as well
S0525	yeah
S0623	erm
S0525	then there'll be no
S0623	yes
S0525	more feed in the night
S0623	no just
S0525	you've be warn
S0623	difficult with especially cos he hasn't be take it in the day so when he's cry at night i well he be hungry
S0525	yes
S0623	so there's no
S0525	no best to give to him in the night yeah
S0623	oh definitely yeah
S0525	but you won't have to worry about you want to ask the midwives and think they be gonna be
S0623	health visitors no no
S0525	no he's gonna be fine i say it be just gonna be a phase
S0623	yeah
S0525	he he do brilliantly he really do i mean you're
S0623	mm hm
S0525	he's an absolute credit to you you've do everything right with him and he's fine and i know everything freak you out a bite if he stop do this suddenly and that but it's
S0623	that be a big thing that i didn't want to ever happen be for him to stop eat and obviously i know that yes he's eat his food but he need to be get his nutrition and stuff from his milk still cos he only have
S0525	like i say he hadn't go off it it wasn't the case he didn't like it
S0623	no it wasn't no
S0525	i think it be his teeth and i just think
S0623	yeah
S0525	he didn't want the teat in his mouth and it be hurt him and he obviously still need it cos the minute you want it he need it he just drink a whole bottle down so
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	i don't think he's gonna he's not he's not gonna go off food he's be good since the day he be bear with take his milk
S0623	yeah
S0525	and his food
S0623	uhu mm will he be fussy though that's the that's the question
S0525	you be fairly fussy as i remember
S0623	yeah
S0623	well this be yeah the why i do wanna get him start on lot of different things but
S0525	fish finger be good as well
S0623	yeah
S0525	and when he's you know little if you want to just do the fish finger take the skin off
S0623	mm
S0525	you could have the fish inside or i you know buy the nice buy the cod fillet and
S0623	yeah
S0525	and just mash it up flake it up cos i mean that's all soft fish and when you flake it you can check there's no bone in it
S0623	mm
S0525	and that's nice and again a lot of your sauce that you've get the recipes for you can probably put on erm
S0623	oh there's fish yeah fish and pasta there's a nice look nice salmon and tomato one
S0525	mm
S0623	for pasta which would be er which i'll do
S0525	yeah cos all those be nice soft foods that erm
S0623	mm
S0525	you shouldn't have any problem with
S0623	yeah
S0525	ideal
S0623	so that's yeah that's really from about six six to nine months he need to be on those sort of things
S0525	uhu

S0623	break
S0525	respite now
S0623	couple of weeks yeah
S0525	yeah
S0623	while we can
S0525	yes cos i can't remember
S0623	start his new foods
S0525	so things like egg cheese dairy can they can have them to six months can't they
S0623	let's have a look it's tell you all in here
S0525	i just remember with us it be nut obviously they say don't give them nut
S0623	yes
S0525	for twelve months
S0623	uhu
S0525	but i don't think it er and egg cook
S0623	oh okay
S0525	or be it or
S0623	yes
S0525	no no they could have egg
S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	i'm but cook
S0623	but you have to cook them really well
S0525	erm oh i'm just try to think
S0623	i think it's in the front of here
S0525	i'm just try to think could could he have soft boil egg cos you use to have egg and soldier do you remember use to dip your
S0623	yes uhu
S0525	your soldier and that that's not cook that's only semi boil cos the yoke's runny
S0623	yeah it's all er it be all in the front of here
S0525	but i can't remember so i'm just wonder if there's anything that they say to avoid
S0623	erm definitely be in here
S0525	cos it say you can start with cow's milk in cook didn't it from six months
S0623	yes and that be on the i think it say they be percentage of higher risk foods yes erm okay it's in in here somewhere oh yeah what can they have so six months citrus fruit six months well cook egg
S0525	right
S0623	six to nine months soft egg eg
S0525	oh i see
S0623	well cook scramble egg
S0525	oh
S0623	or one year add salt
S0525	oh okay
S0623	sugar limit amount from twelve months whole cow's milk as a main drink
S0525	as a main drink
S0623	honey pate soft cheese
S0525	all the stuff that you avoid when you're pregnant and chop nut
S0623	and chop nut when they're five
S0525	so really the things you avoid well you you wouldn't give a baby pate or soft cheese particularly would you
S0623	god no crikey
S0525	but why this honey at twelve oh i bet that's your erm your hay fever allergies and things you know
S0623	oh yeah no it wouldn't surprise me yeah mm
S0525	they say about honey but erm i have honey on pancakes on holiday it be lovely
S0623	yeah
S0525	i be look for the maple syrup but it's either honey or chocolate sauce
S0623	no brainer for the chocolate sauce be it
S0525	well i have some of that as well to be honest when i i have two bottle of it cos i be try all the bottle that but they be all the same they be all chocolate sauce oh cos it be say these melons it that be to mm
S0623	yes
S0525	that be
S0623	that's when
S0525	to be avoid with your banana

S0623	when you've get your like pudding as well
S0525	uhu i reckon he'll probably be alright with it

S0525	with the salmon that would be erm
S0623	yes
S0525	if you and be have some
S0623	oh yeah yeah

S0525	well i like it as well
S0623	yeah
S0525	erm just do just just steam it in the microwave
S0623	yeah
S0525	and get flake him a little bite off
S0623	yeah
S0525	and then you can erm
S0623	i mean even if i make some portion then i freeze it then it's like well erm if i make some portion then i freeze it then i can always just get some out for myself
S0525	what cake be that you're eat coffee
S0623	yeah
S0525	since when do you like coffee cake
