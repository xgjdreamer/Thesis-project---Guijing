S0329	i mean no but i mean get his docs doc martens off you don't have to get book
S0326	i don't i i want this book anyway
S0329	but i mean why do you get a this bizarre sort of translation
S0326	cos that's what i want i didn't know what it be when i buy it
S0329	i i know but why my question be why
S0326	it's interest you're not mean to read them by themselves
S0329	you're not mean to read what by themselves
S0326	these things
S0329	emily dickinson's poems
S0326	no these weird translations of them
S0329	now i'm confuse
S0326	that's because you're quite stupid
S0329	cos i'm quite stupid now that be possible
S0326	it's interest it's what this this translation of emily dickinson
S0329	do you yeah do
S0326	it's english this be how this person interpret them
S0329	do it do it get review erm be they be they good the review
S0326	that book
S0329	yeah
S0326	no
S0326	no
S0329	how do you even know about it
S0326	cos i remember i have to
S0329	don't be so irritate these be normal question they're
S0326	well because you're just be a bite dense about it
S0329	no i'm not be dense it's it's an odd thing for me
S0326	i don't think it's i think it's i think it's the i think it's the kind of thing that i would expect you to be interest in
S0329	i'm not uninterested
S0326	well why
S0329	and
S0326	you be like why do you buy that
S0329	but i well i not say it in a way like
S0326	you be
S0329	not
S0326	i get it let me show you now it's last year at the classical society thing have to do this like poem picture thing where you have to take a poem and talk about it so i what i do be i do emily dickinson poem the one of the translations beneath it
S0329	oh that's really good
S0326	i do i do a well good talk on this poem
S0329	yeah you could do your well good talk to me i'll be i be interest in it
S0326	well
S0326	i do yeah maybe the whole thing my point i didn't really talk about the i didn't really have time but my main thing be be about homonymical
S0329	really
S0326	and the neurology of read
S0329	be that something to do with i do
S0326	think about it cos you think about this first line yeah
S0329	yeah
S0326	i felt a cleave in my mind
S0329	yeah
S0326	what do that mean
S0329	i felt my mind i felt i be have a mental breakdown or something
S0326	no but what do it mean though really
S0329	i felt break apart
S0326	what what else do when what when your tongue cleave the roof of your mouth what do it do
S0329	stick
S0326	together yeah
S0329	do it
S0326	yeah
S0329	so
S0326	cleave mean two things it mean exactly the opposite things it mean couple together and
S0329	fuck that's deep
S0326	move apart as if my brain have split okay so that's not really gonna go anywhere i try to match it seam by seam but could not make it fit a mental breakdown kind of but what i think erm be that it's actually kind of as soon as you get that sort of lucid think that you have to have your brain fall apart to have a lucid think you know do you know what i'm get at when i say that
S0329	no not really why
S0326	they're sort of like look past reality or the surface of things
S0329	yeah
S0326	you know how people always say that mad people be visionaries and they're the only ones who be sort of
S0329	yeah
S0326	know what's go on and emily dickinson's obviously totally batshit crazy
S0329	yeah batshit crazy
S0326	she write these funny like these sort of really lucid poems that be weird but they like sort of touch a nerve so i just think that be a poem about her her creative process in a way i felt a cleave in my mind she's work it out at the same time as she's fall apart
S0329	go on read the rest of it to me
S0326	i felt a cleave in my mind as if my brain have split i try to match it seam by seam but could not make it fit a think behind i strive to join the think before sequence ravel out of sound like ball upon a floor there's the other word ravel so if you if you ravel out a jumper
S0329	be that you don't ravel it
S0326	no but it but it's in modern the the word in modern days mean different from what it do in eighteen sixty in eighteen sixty unravel's not really a word you ravel up something and you ravel up something it mean both again it's like it's like do the same thing as cleave do the sequence ravel out of sound so what be it come together or fall apart i don't know and then also there's a sort of regular iambic rhythm it's very compose for rhythmically for a poem that's about lose your mind
S0329	yeah that's for sure
S0326	well anyway that's why i buy that book
S0329	oh i see okay well i think that's that's brilliant and it's really interest and i'm sorry if i give you the impression that i wasn't interest cos i be you've get shoe on so can you take that out and also the one that's on the doorstep tie it up thank you very much
S0326	so i also talk about how how it be a a really different experience to read it on a page or to listen to it because it look like when i say about the rhythm erm it sound all like regular but if you look at it it's get all these dash
S0329	oh yeah the
S0326	capitalization
S0329	but it all every single in capitals
S0326	yeah i know but even i i know
S0329	yeah so it mean that you it look as though as though it's all break down
S0326	if you yeah but if you didn't look at it and just hear someone say it it sound like it's come together
S0329	yeah but you know that there be it's it's a mistake to think that she be just a naïve crazy batshit woman
S0326	no that's exactly i know
S0329	yeah
S0326	cos it also there's this at this thing you have to erm talk about your poem and then there's like people like be there you know to try and challenge you on it and stuff
S0329	yeah
S0326	you know and it's like go up and just become it be like just we be talk about generally how generally like you get emily dickinson or whatever and then this guy be like really kind of genius classicist latinist that be talk with a cockney voice
S0326	erm he be like go off on one like about emily dickinson be about how great she be and that he be surprise that didn't really get it
S0329	oh really
S0326	but you know i trust his opinion you know
S0329	god such a fuck education it's good 's work hard too but not obviously not do the same shit let's throw that away
S0326	er so that's what i i mean you if you read
S0329	let's have a look at that
S0326	cos be talk about this and she think it be like just take the piss and like she be like if i be emily dickinson i'd be annoy
S0329	well it it that be a bite take the piss i mean i can see why she say that
S0326	it be but yeah but i don't
S0329	i have to hurry out the road now
S0326	why what for
S0329	well cos and i be go out
S0326	where you go
S0329	we've be invite to dinner
S0326	i also talk to at that thing
S0329	oh yeah what do he say
S0326	he be alright but he's a bite of a sort of doesn't have a very like good view on the tuition fee thing think it's a good thing
S0329	they're all i don't know why they i hate academics well most of them
S0326	and he be like the real problem be the vice chancellors who be get pay three hundred fifty thousand pound a year and i be like yeah i'm pay for it he say well actually i'm pay for it well i'm pay for you
S0329	well he's pay for it cos of his tax
