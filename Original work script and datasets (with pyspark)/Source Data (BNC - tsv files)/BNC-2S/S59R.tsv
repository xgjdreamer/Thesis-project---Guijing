S0251	what be ask you this morning in the coffee shop
S0252	he be ask whether we like erm the coffee what be the third one
S0251	pistachio
S0252	pistachio erm
S0251	no i think it be quite a cheffy sound combination wasn't it
S0252	it be it be
S0251	i think the bake off's get a lot to answer for don't you
S0252	it have in some ways yes
S0251	and what do you say do you like it
S0252	erm well i i be ah relatively positive with my response
S0252	say that ah the flavour do have a little bite in common with the erm the coffee itself
S0251	yes
S0252	with the sort of citrus flavour
S0251	mm mm i haven't come across that combination before but he say it be quite a popular thing in scandinavian countries
S0252	mm yes
S0251	i hadn't hear of it before though
S0252	i'm not quite sure why because none of those things would be native to
S0251	no
S0252	scandinavia
S0251	no
S0252	because obviously usually local specialities tend to be things that come from the area or
S0251	mm yeah i suppose the very i imagine they would drink more coffee than we do i don't suppose they drink as much tea
S0252	mm
S0251	see i wouldn't have think of put with coffee
S0252	no
S0251	i think to be honest although i wouldn't have say it that he have get it a little bite dry around the edge and it be a little bite more well do around the edge
S0252	mm
S0251	because it be quite a big cake
S0252	yes
S0251	it would have to be in the oven for quite some time to set in the middle
S0252	it would
S0251	so i think if he'd put more greaseproof maybe two or three layer of greaseproof round the edge and maybe some brown paper it would make it bake a bite more evenly
S0252	mm
S0251	it be just a little bite on the dry side actually
S0252	another thing that depend on what sort of oven he have use
S0251	mm i think it actually make it for us in a way because the day before he'd say what be our favourite cake
S0252	yes
S0251	and i say coffee
S0252	yeah
S0251	and then the next day we go in and he'd make that coffee and cake so
S0252	yes
S0251	i think he be try to please us really wasn't he
S0252	yes
S0251	but i think it be a very happy coffee shop really isn't it
S0252	it be yeah
S0251	friendly
S0252	yes
S0251	one of the waitress there leave one time to get a what she think would be a better job an office type job but after a few months she come back and i think she'd just come back to maybe fill in for somebody who be ill or something but she say she decide to give the office job up and come back to the coffee shop because she miss it so much and she miss see all the people and think she'd be a lot happier at the coffee shop so
S0252	yes
S0251	why not
S0251	it's not always about have what you think's the best job but what's the best job for you isn't it sometimes and what's go to make you the most happy
S0252	indeed and what you can stick at or or work life really
S0251	mm mm hm do you see anybody else today
S0252	erm one of our neighbour
S0251	yes
S0252	yes
S0251	what do she have to say
S0252	she be erm say that her son have move either to the residence
S0251	mm
S0252	and erm that she will have to despite her be four children and her husband will be the only one in the house except the cat of course
S0251	mm yeah just her and the cat leave now so i think she'll really feel it don't you
S0252	she will
S0251	it's quite sad in some ways when so call empty nest
S0252	no one to speak to really
S0251	no
S0252	and that there'll be a few house on the estate where only one person live
S0251	yes
S0251	increase number i think
S0252	yes
S0251	she know somebody else who be also go to university but they be hop to stay at home live at home and travel in but they've be hop to pass their drive test in the summer holiday which after all be about three months this time wasn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	but unfortunately they hadn't manage to pass
S0252	no
S0251	i don't think three months be really quite long enough
S0252	well er i'm aware of company offer a a week course where you you do it for the whole day for a week
S0251	mm yeah
S0252	and that be you'd be consider to be er more or less ready for the test after that but
S0251	what's the pass rate on that though mm
S0252	it's er erm if you be prepare to do it a bite more gradually
S0251	yes
S0252	i think you're just try to do it one a week it's probably more maybe six to nine months course include maybe a few holiday and that type of thing
S0251	yeah yes if you just have one lesson yes that's it
S0252	but obviously if you do it at the more frequent level then er you can probably expect to pass a bite quicker
S0251	mm yeah or if parent can give you a bite of extra practice they can get the car insure
S0252	yes
S0251	and get a bite of extra practice that way
S0252	yes i think you'd have to choose your rout well
S0251	yes on quiet roads
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0252	but whilst quiet roads it's get to be a good mix of roads
S0251	mm to get you use to different
S0252	er because in er the test to do real test what different road condition
S0251	yes
S0252	yes
S0251	so you want some quiet ones and some busy ones
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah the trouble with his position be that because he live in a village he'll have to get a lift into the town centre so that he can catch the either the train or the bus so that he can get himself there so
S0252	yes
S0251	he's still go to need a bite of assistance isn't he
S0252	er he be yeah
S0251	and er if you live in a remote area
S0252	mm
S0251	you be quite dependent on
S0252	cars
S0251	cars
S0252	yes erm i think another thing that doesn't help be that the er insurance will probably come be most expensive in the first month or so when you pass
S0251	yes
S0252	especially if you to be a main driver
S0251	mm
S0252	in the time
S0251	true
S0252	whereas if you just give it five six months
S0251	yeah
S0252	you can just make it a little bite more of a a reasonable price
S0251	yes take the edge off it a bite
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0252	but it doesn't like they'll have that choice
S0251	no not just for now but there again we're do over more experience drivers don't we
S0251	who's have a bite of a how much will that car have cost do you think
S0252	which car
S0251	's car
S0252	oh i eh i think that it'd have be at least thirty thousand pound
S0251	ouch he must have only have it what two weeks three weeks
S0252	yeah well pick it up on the end of august i think
S0251	august so yeah
S0252	over six weeks
S0251	mm and then he get mix up between which be the accelerator and which be the brake
S0252	i know
S0251	and erm wrap it round the hedge
S0252	yes
S0251	and do two and a half thousand pound worth of damage
S0252	yeah i think i don't it must have really get it in the hedge in a bad way to create that amount of damage
S0251	yeah
S0252	you'd have think if you just hit the hedge
S0251	yeah
S0252	might have be eh a little scratch but it must have be it must have more or less knock the hedge over to create that much damage
S0251	yeah yeah i wonder what's all the damage on it that's cost so much
S0252	i don't know
S0251	now it could have be worse if he'd have hurt somebody
S0252	yeah
S0251	or himself
S0251	bang somebody else's car
S0252	yes
S0251	or if his wife have be drive
S0251	yeah so it's a good job it be him that be drive
S0252	yes
S0251	i think be the automatics a bite more different and difficult to drive
S0252	well if you've be drive a manual car for any length of time then
S0251	but have they
S0252	well erm i think they have in the past but due to strange circumstances they've move to an automatic vehicle
S0251	mm mm yeah
S0252	so i think ah his wife have quite a bite of experience with an automatic a little now but i don't think he have
S0251	yes bless her hmm
S0251	mm
S0252	i think you just get use to the er manual if you drive manual for many years really
S0251	yeah yes so will he lose his no claim bonus now or will it be protect or
S0252	it's it's a grey area really it's it's sort of depend what's include sometimes the i think it will be cover but i think as long as he's pay the extra to have it cover but i think sometimes in more serious case it even if you do have that you will still lose it
S0251	it's bind to be mm yes be it all in the small print
S0252	yes it's not just as simple as just you protect yourself against it or you don't
S0251	mm
S0252	it's kind of sort of protect yourself but not fully
S0251	in every circumstances
S0252	yes
S0251	i don't think small print should be allow why should some things be in such small print that you can't see them
S0252	well i mean some sort of term and condition seem to be about ten page long in small print
S0251	mm
S0252	so if they do it in big print it'd probably be a a small book and no one's go to read it it's ah
S0251	but you couldn't read it even if you want really when it's so small could you
S0252	but so you're say if it be in size fourteen to sixteen font you would read it or
S0251	probably not i don't think anybody ever read that kind of thing in detail
S0252	i know
S0251	because it's just too painful isn't it
S0252	but you can usually upload them on the computer and then obviously you can magnify it
S0251	yes
S0252	without a big problem no
S0251	yes he do suffer from insomnia doesn't he
S0252	mm hm
S0251	god that'd get you off to sleep in no time
S0252	yes yes hope i will be alright on my regular commute
S0251	yes yes you'll ah have to get use to it won't you and
S0252	yes obviously i will probably be a fairly high mileage driver within the immediate family
S0251	i know you'll be notch up a few miles soon won't you
S0252	yes
S0251	mm i think one of the main hazard for you be slow move traffic
S0252	mm
S0251	on the a64
S0252	yes
S0251	if that make you think you're go to be late and then you know start get a bite anxious about it or something
S0252	yeah
S0251	what do you think
S0252	i know what you mean i mean i personally just try to not look at the time when i'm drive
S0251	yeah you just have to
S0252	because it doesn't matter what time it be you've still get to get there safely whether it's what whether it's half one or whether it's midnight you've still get to to get to your destination safely without any damage or anything like that
S0251	yeah you've get to get there in one piece mm that's the main thing definitely i just thing that it might be unpredictable you know that you go one time
S0252	yes
S0251	and it's completely fine so you think oh i can set off at this time then another occasion you set off at that time and then it make you late because there never seem to be a reason when you get to the front of the queue oh there'll be an accident or erm something of this sort lorry's slip its load or something and you'll see what the problem be
S0252	mm
S0251	but when you get far up the road then it just disappear there doesn't seem to be any really good reason
S0252	i think sometimes it just be too many cars on that road it's a major road
S0251	mm
S0252	really link two big cities to the coast
S0251	yes
S0252	erm for it to be single carriageway for most of the way
S0251	yeah
S0252	and obviously where it do change from two to one you get a bite of a bottleneck there
S0251	it do
S0252	it it really doesn't help
S0251	no
S0252	i think if it be just it be a dual carriageway the whole way i don't think there'd be i think there would rarely be a problem unless there be an actual accident
S0251	yeah mm
S0252	but
S0251	it when it change from two lanes to one
S0252	yes i think hopefully there will be a bite of a pattern and also hopefully be able to tell before you actually get on
S0251	mm
S0252	and have an opportunity to go take a different route
S0251	yes yeah but the other way be more of a country way isn't it
S0252	mm it be
S0251	and in icy weather that would be a bite dicey wouldn't it
S0252	you can't do it in icy weather it would only be suitable in normal drive condition
S0251	yeah good condition
S0252	just hope there isn't too much ice and snow
S0251	no
S0252	to contend with drive in ice and obviously i think black ice can be a real danger if you be drive at sort of sixty seventyish on the a64 and black ice and you're you're in a real problem then aren't you
S0251	mm definitely mm definitely mm
S0252	but even if you're do fifty
S0251	yeah
S0252	you know it's a tricky thing
S0251	but we do have some alternatives because you could go on the train couldn't you
S0252	i could go on the train
S0251	think it be a bite icy
S0252	yes obviously it do take a bite longer and
S0251	you'd more or less have to decide the night before i think so you could plan it more
S0252	yes and it's not that frequent really in some ways every hour
S0251	no
S0252	maybe miss one then
S0251	yeah you've get a long time to wait for the next one really mm you just can't tell what kind of winter last winter i think we pretty much get away with it i don't even think we have snow last winter do we
S0252	no we didn't have any snow well other thing be if i don't need to get there until ten or eleven o'clock
S0251	yes
S0252	most the worst effect will have probably disappear
S0251	it should be a lot better by then and probably be grit and just the temperature will have just lift a bite
S0252	the sun will have come out won't it
S0251	that will definitely help if you don't need to be in first thing
S0252	yes
S0251	but the timetable seem a bite variable doesn't it there isn't really a set pattern to it i don't think be there
S0252	yeah no well it's just sort of every each component be at a set frequency really
S0251	yes
S0252	and it will change at each semester i think
S0251	mm so we'll just have to check each day won't we
S0252	yes but in the semester after easter
S0251	yes
S0252	you really any lecture after that it's pretty quiet really
S0251	why not so what happen at that point
S0252	well it'll be revision i imagine
S0251	right
S0252	we might get more sort of small group ones i don't know but
S0251	i see
S0252	there doesn't seem to be that much actual
S0251	down for the moment
S0252	no
S0251	well it might fill up a bite more as it get nearer the time
S0252	yes but in some ways the university be just more or less from october to easter really isn't it
S0251	mm seem to be as far as we can tell up to now anyway i'm glad we've get your park permit sort out now
S0252	yes
S0251	get that fit on because i think it'll be very busy in the first few weeks people queue up try to get the park permit try to get the id card and you've get yours collect and there there wasn't any real queue be there
S0252	sort themselves out yes no
S0251	pretty quick
S0252	yes but obviously if anyone's come in from any distance they won't really be able to pick up like that
S0251	no that's right they wouldn't
S0252	i hope that the car park doesn't fill up too much
S0251	no
S0252	that there be a few space
S0251	so do that just entitle you to just use one particular car park
S0252	well technically it's two
S0251	two
S0252	yes
S0251	oh
S0252	but that's all the car park at my part of campus
S0251	yes
S0252	but you can't park on other part of the campus
S0251	no
S0252	but it wouldn't be really convenient for me to anyway because
S0251	no you're too far away
S0252	yes really it's one and a half miles from the other part of the campus so
S0251	mm it's
S0252	it's not really handy to park on the other side particularly
S0251	so be they pretty extensive car park or do you think there's a chance that you might get there and find all the place have go or
S0252	i think they're just medium size car park really
S0251	mm
S0252	they're not they certainly could be a lot bigger
S0251	yes
S0252	i go they've do their very best to try and limit car usership
S0251	um hm um hm
S0252	like i think ah some of the staff might well have to pay up to four hundred pound a year to park permit which
S0251	yes
S0252	obviously be quite a lot of money just for a park space
S0251	i know
S0252	and they sort of try to discourage it by ah encourage staff to car share or
S0251	mm
S0252	erm if they surrender their pass they get a hundred and fifty pound to spend on a bike or something like that so
S0251	mm
S0252	they're a little bite sort of anti car really so to what extent that work will depend on how many space be there
S0251	yeah yeah mm it's not always practical though in bad weather another thing it depend on how much you've get to carry you've get book and file and laptops and that i think it's a bite dangerous have all that to carry when you're on a bike
S0252	yes yes well their solution to that one be to erm have a permit that allow you to go ten time per semester so you can drive in bad weather and when you carry heavy stuff but use public transport or bike when you don't
S0251	think of everything haven't they mm
S0252	but erm i don't think it's really particularly possible or convenient in my case really
S0251	no oh no it's too far much too far
S0252	and also pretty expensive as well really
S0251	yeah
S0252	without that sort of flexibility
S0251	yes
S0252	only good thing be that you can go and leave when you want really
S0251	yes it give you that independence doesn't it
S0252	there's no yes you don't have to wait half an hour or
S0251	for the bus or
S0252	the pressure to collect something or
S0251	no that's it
S0252	the car park's open twenty four hours so
S0251	oh that's good
S0252	there's no restriction the only condition be i can't park there for more than twenty four hours
S0251	no mm
S0252	but i don't think there's any chance of that really unless it's break or something
