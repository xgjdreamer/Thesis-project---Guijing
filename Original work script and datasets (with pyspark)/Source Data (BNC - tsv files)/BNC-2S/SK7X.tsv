S0024	car
S0144	yep hmm yeah do you see er discovery channel's that bear grylls
S0024	oh that's what why do they
S0144	er i don't know something to do with his contract no he be probably ask for money or something
S0144	you know what people be like bite of greedy or maybe the discovery channel want to start make him do stuff he didn't want to do
S0024	yeah probably probably poor bloke he's quite i i like him very adventurous
S0144	he seem alright actually he do seem down to earth doesn't he
S0024	yeah i want to learn all of that stuff they do some
S0144	i'd love to learn all that that would be brilliant
S0024	have you hear about the new forest school
S0144	no
S0024	they've get they've start them in different place of the uk where the kid oh it's a sore point i think because it's mainly the kid who be have difficulties
S0144	right
S0024	they're get to go and live and stay in the forest cos it improve their behaviour because they're learn life skills in the forest
S0144	okay so it's like you're behave like a complete bastard let's send you on holiday as a as a punishment
S0024	so well no but it's part of the school it's part of the school they do it every month but they've every week or every month or something a class go out to the forest and learn
S0144	yeah but what's the incentive to be a a good kid these days
S0024	good kid yeah exactly but they they reckon they be learn quite a lot of stuff from it
S0144	yeah i'm sure they be
S0024	and they're become better behave but you do wonder about the good kid
S0144	no no
S0024	maybe they're do the good kid as well
S0144	well they don't you see it on well you see it on tv all the time you know they're do up a boat or they they get i don't know they go on a orienteering thing or or whatever and it's always these kid that be you know get these behavioural problems and i can understand they come from bad
S0024	mm do you want to do it over here
S0144	a lot of them come from bad environments
S0024	do it over here
S0144	but i don't think you can have a society that operate that way
S0024	no i don't understand the how they always well they don't reward they try and better the behaviour by give them nice things don't they but that it be reward
S0144	yeah which be essentially reward bad behaviour
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't know i think they should reward good kid and so the other kid say look look at that kid he's get all this stuff what's wrong with that onion
S0024	oh it's just double up in the middle i think
