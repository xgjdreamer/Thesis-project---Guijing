S0282	right so i'm gonna start it out now so so we can talk about the kinds of things you want to get my feedback on
S0645	right okay right well first and foremost like i say be talk about this erm er who who do you reckon would be the first person to contact
S0282	about the conversion of this space
S0645	yeah about the structural sort of possibilities cos if they then if they've gotta stay connect to these stud wall for some unknown weird reason then that sort of stop it go ahead
S0282	yeah
S0645	cos we can't go put in any more support it will be intrusive enough to have a space that's get these steel and just about saleable with those steel all the way through the room
S0282	yeah erm i erm i think it's very because i think that if we that a conversion of the build happen in the seventies and the eighties and that be definitely his work and he be in charge so there be two phase of work one in nineteen seventy five seventy six and then the next in nineteen eighty and then the work carry on between then and nineteen eighty six nineteen eighty seven
S0645	yeah
S0282	so erm and he be the architect for all of that work and that be the point at which they put the theatre in downstairs and these space upstairs be convert into those erm kind of little shed things
S0645	yeah
S0282	the little chicken wire shed that we saw in that photograph out there so whether these strut be part of keep the ceiling part of keep the roof up because we be actually in a what would've be a disused space
S0645	yeah
S0282	so whether they take something else out some other kind of structural support or some other kind of structural if other structural erm
S0645	i would've think there would've be roof joists standard roof joists
S0282	yeah
S0645	cos that's what steel be there to replace
S0282	but then we've get a flat roof here so i don't know what's above this roof there be a there be actually a space above isn't isn't there
S0645	yeah there be an attic
S0282	there be an attic have you be up there have you have a look up there
S0645	yeah it's get no but no but there wouldn't be any joists all the way along it then
S0282	but you could have you could stick your head through that hole and see what's hold the roof up because this could be part of some structure from above that's actually hold
S0645	yeah yeah mm
S0282	the roof up above or erm
S0645	well if it's anything above there that's not gonna be an issue but if it's like i say if it's if if for some er weird reason they've put these erm brace roof brace roof tie whatever they're gonna be actually call on non load bear wall which be what all these be
S0282	yeah
S0645	then that'd be weird and
S0282	but do they go through i mean be that be that
S0645	yeah they go all the way through yeah these strut yeah
S0282	that go all the way through so that bite there will go have get a bite that then travel across that office and the next office
S0645	yeah yeah yeah they erm they criss cross but i think the upright extensions that they'll stand on be behind the outside wall
S0282	yeah
S0645	so yeah the uprights and the bits that we really really can't remove
S0282	yeah
S0645	be in the space that we don't wanna touch anyway
S0282	yeah that's fine
S0645	so that'd be ideal i think
S0282	all i'm worry about be these metal strut the
S0645	the metal strut we can't move but i don't think they'll stop us sell the room i mean if they come to sort of here at the at the most if you open up that room and have that space double if you be do a dance class in here there's still space in between them
S0282	yeah
S0645	to actually use erm i mean it's still a usable space you could set the room up anything like that and still be able to see they're not they're not that big that they're sort of gonna be a restrictive view for anybody it's not like have a a big concrete pillar or something in the in the theatre or whatever
S0282	no
S0645	it's erm it's a minor hindrance really i mean it'd be a pain for sort of krav maga and stuff like that
S0282	well yeah that would be dangerous wouldn't it
S0645	yeah
S0282	if they'd trip over them
S0645	yeah well that's it and you'd you'd hit into them but if it's
S0282	yeah
S0645	sedate activities like dance and stuff like that where it's more erm it's more control
S0282	well i don't know what kind of stuff do what kind of dance do but
S0645	mm
S0282	erm i think it's all kinds i mean i've i can't er i look at her website a long time ago but er at that time she be offer so little in the way of rent
S0645	mm
S0282	that it just wasn't feasible for her to take her proposal any further than
S0645	well if if unless if it be er drastically increase from the old stream of email that i read through the twenty k mark we'll only get her basically the erm time on the days and and slot that she want so she could have a similar thing to krav maga four even a week and a saturday
S0282	yeah
S0645	for that for that price
S0282	yeah
S0645	and she's still go to be quite a little bite under what we would've be able to achieve with other people
S0282	well er i think she's come when i mean i think i tell her that twenty thousand wasn't gonna do it
S0645	mm
S0282	so hopefully she's
S0645	that be for exclusive use though on a lease wasn't it
S0282	er yes she be look to lease a space
S0645	yeah
S0282	erm and she say to me it wasn't that wasn't affordable at the time but we have that conversation about money so if it turn out that erm she come back er she have come back to me which mean that theoretically she's get more money than she do before
S0645	mm cos if i just work out say fifteen hours a week three five erm five three hour slot erm fifteen time call it fifty be seven hundred and fifty hours time forty five pound the lowest rate that's still thirty three thousand
S0282	yeah
S0645	which be basically we're only in
S0282	but er but then how much be krav maga pay again
S0645	thirty six that's what i mean i wouldn't be able to i wouldn't do it for less that thirty six quid thirty six quid an hour be ridiculous
S0282	mm
S0645	and that's only because they've get the the vast majority of er the business come from them so i mean if we do it that way then seven hundred and fifty hours over the course of a year at thirty six quid that's still twenty seven grand
S0282	yeah so we're look for thirty for a share use basically
S0645	yeah yeah with thirty to give her the hours that she want
S0282	yeah
S0645	of of around fifteen hours a week maybe a little bite more give or take but i need to be able to rent it out for the lion's share of the days monday through friday nine till five
S0282	yeah then if we're if we set ourselves a target for how much we want to earn off the space a year
S0645	mm
S0282	then we can work from that as well
S0645	mm
S0282	so if the target be to turn sixty grand a year off the space then if she pay if she pay a third of that that's probably enough
S0645	mm i i wouldn't wanna give her that that prime slot for a third she would have to be pay at least forty percent for a prime slot cos that's where we make money
S0282	yeah but but that's the only she that's the only that's the only enquiry of that nature that we've have for a while
S0645	oh yeah if it be something to start from it'd be alright
S0282	yeah
S0645	but what you've gotta bear in mind be that the slot where i make up the rest of the money the fifty five pound an hour into the sixty five pound an hour tariff be the one that she's take up a lion's share of the hours from
S0282	yeah
S0645	so it diminish all possibility of be able to get an a bump up of of money i mean i wouldn't be able to get many more church and stuff in which be also good money at the weekend
S0282	yeah but then on the other hand we must bear in mind that all of these people be erm temporary fixtures if we give them a space we don't have to give them a space forever so say for example if if krav maga or something we should probably have all of these these er on a on a on a contract on a term contract
S0645	mm
S0282	so that we give them six months or we give them a year and it's renewable after that time so we er you know we don't want to mess people about and and throw them out and have them on the streets but quite frankly they they they will up stick as we know they will up stick and disappear from one week to the next
S0645	yeah
S0282	if it suit them so therefore we should have contract with them that allow us to say look i'm sorry we've change our mind this be not work for us
S0645	mm
S0282	and and erm er and you know please review terminate and go away by extent which be the end of your term contract with us so rather than be arbitrary with people we we we do sort of say to them look this be for six months this be for a year and then at the end of the year we reserve the right to renegotiate
S0645	well the main set up with erm the erm hall book more specifically krav maga at the minute they're on a recur contract where we can stop them just as as easy as they can stop us
S0282	mm
S0645	but the understand i've get with them be that his price be base on a be he's be give a price for the next year so next april may sort of time we'll have to go through and renegotiate his his tariff that he's on cos it will have to go up a little bite
S0282	mm
S0645	but then we could look at do that and go right okay i'm gonna put your money up but i will give the security of a twelve month fix so
S0282	yeah i mean the thing be that if you i mean it's like rent a flat it's like anything or rent a room or whatever erm you you have a start price and then other people can put it up
S0645	yeah
S0282	at will really the only way to not have that kind of thing happen to you be have a formal lease
S0645	yeah
S0282	you know whereby you commit to quite a big long period of time yourself so that you know you're both tie in to
S0645	mm
S0282	the deal the rent be set on one side the term be set on the other side and then that both give you advantage and then perhaps you that that's when you know you've get your your price but if you want to have casual use and you want to be able to pull out when you need to
S0645	mm
S0282	and you want to be able to disappear between one day and the next you have to accept that your landlord might want to put your rent up between one day and the next
S0645	yeah well what i be think about for this space
S0282	mm
S0645	go back to that be basically give it over to people like for this sort of erm this er erm the dismantle of the erm town hall sort of thing
S0282	yeah
S0645	and people need it and say to them
S0282	yeah
S0645	look okay for nine months of the year i can guarantee you can get a monday tuesday and a wednesday
S0282	yeah
S0645	and i will hold it free
S0282	yeah
S0645	but then for three months of the year i will give nobody erm preference over say and the cast company cos if i hold the space empty for them for a week we earn double and triple the amount from other people so we could look at it as that
S0282	yeah er well yeah but except for the fact that actually what we work out in the past be you can't ride those two horse at once if if come come along they want the whole week and then want it back so so you can't have
S0282	yeah but but it's it's a season
S0645	er you can't have on in there er
S0282	no no but you have to work it for a season you wouldn't actually do it you wouldn't put somebody like in there because they want to be in there throughout the year you'd have the season in so that's what i mean so for nine months of the year it could be available monday to friday but for the christmas season sort of november through january it's it's not
S0282	yeah i well i would i would be very cautious about that because we we have we have a period of about two years when we have people like come back periodically and they come back less and less and less
S0645	mm
S0282	and when you look back at our schedule they use to be here you know they use to be here for ten weeks twenty weeks or something like that out of fifty two
S0645	mm
S0282	and then gradually gradually it cut cut cut down and we be hold it free for them in case they come back and then they they just go off and they use somebody else's hall instead and actually the weird thing about that particular company be the scabbier the space
S0645	yeah the more they like it
S0282	the more they rent it i mean the the more we do up the space the less they take it on it be very bizarre i mean it be it you know who
S0645	mm
S0282	i can't well i don't know they just i don't know whether they're really grungy old hippy type and they really like it be sort of scabby and dirty and everything make them feel like they be at home in downtown and this be really grungy
S0645	yeah that's why they come here yeah
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm well it's not set in stone but we can do anything with the space but if we do make it i would like to keep it open more of a sort of overflow from downstairs try and not replicate what i've get downstairs cos what i've get downstairs now be an unsaleable sort of space one or two days a week i want it more fluid than that
S0282	yeah
S0645	and try and transplant stuff up and down you know
S0282	yeah although on the other hand we're not actually do any or much active market at the moment so
S0645	er there's no point at the minute
S0282	well i mean it be difficult we be go to have to rely on somebody come along who want a monday
S0645	yeah
S0282	or who want a friday or something like that and it have to be those days because that's all we've get i mean like you know the town hall people it strike me be go to be one of our best options on that because we you know they can probably adapt their schedule to a certain extent so that they they do have things on a monday because you know as long as they can have every monday for a year or two years or something like that that's fine for them it's just they don't want irregular pattern of of of availability
S0645	mm
S0282	they want you know they want us to commit to particular date particular time but it it be always go to be difficult because er and there's always go to be slot that can't that can't be fill and and and if and we decide to do this thing that we be discuss the other night of be a theme some sort of theme build where we go for say religious use or educational use that's gonna actually make it worse
S0645	that'll make it really difficult won't it
S0282	because somebody somebody will come along and say can i have it on a monday and say well be you educational
S0645	no
S0282	no so okay do we accept the money or do we stick out for an educational project that be gonna have it full time
S0645	i think we try we try the theme thing but with always the sort of er decision that we need to take the money
S0282	yeah
S0645	that come through the door sort of thing we don't turn money away but if we've get a choice of two people we may we may take slightly less profit or maybe even at break even for some some hours to choose to go in the field that we want to be in but we need to actually pay the bill first we're not in a position of luxury that we can just turn away money
S0282	no no absolutely no i know that better than anybody actually but i mean what we're come back actually erm somebody like you know so what if the whole of 's project move in
S0645	mm mm
S0282	and take up the whole of this suite of offices for example that's that's a possibility that we actually you know we have have those stroke of luck before
S0645	mm
S0282	and you know we've we've market small space to small organisations but if there be a distinct possibility that somebody might take the whole or somebody might take the whole all of these offices
S0645	mm
S0282	and they might want it as a as a single thing or as a big room and and that be always erm i haven't renew our market on the property website for a very long time but that be a distinct possibility that we can let out to a bigger organisation who want more space
S0645	mm if we're gonna do that i think we do that with the central area of the hub we actually put some proper decent online market on with the property people to say that there be a there be a space up for grab of a certain size de de de de de
S0282	mm
S0645	can be configure into
S0645	this that or the other
S0282	the only trouble with most estate agents be they take fifteen percent of the first year's rent as their fee
S0645	mm well erm
S0282	and i've that before because that's you know that's actually a sort of eye water amount of money
S0645	yeah it be a lot of money i think what we should be do then and this be what i've sort of try to say right from the begin be to get that space configure by a new person come in we just aim for break even for the first year cos it's be a year now if not more where we've not make a single penny from it if you look at it per seat there be that central area it's not make any money
S0282	well
S0645	if we have a year of break even
S0282	yeah but ah ah except for the fact that actually one thing i need to do erm be to talk to about what kind of financial contribution he be gonna make to this organisation his because it have actually be in use and it's be in use
S0645	yeah just
S0282	and it's be in use by
S0645	well the central area yeah for
S0282	neither of them have contribute a single red cent to that space
S0645	mm
S0282	and you know what i be think about the other day be that you know actually they be real liberty takers because they have the space for free they lean on us to give us this space because they're you know how you know we're we're be like we're just not be nice to them by not let them have the space they don't pay anything for it and then they leave it in a mess
S0645	well no in the even they have pay it's just be a ridiculously small figure that be just not worth us do for the amount of hassle so i send them that email the other day anyway say it's about to be change and it's no longer gonna be available as of today so er there'll be no more hire the space out and the the furniture from ikea be down there ready to be put up
S0282	ah i forget to ask about that
S0645	but it come last week but i'm still wait for the erm email via germany suppliers erm
S0282	about the legs
S0645	yeah
S0645	so at the minute it's still a case of we don't know whether we can do it cos we don't know whether you get mark one or mark two furniture well of course of course they do they must know that erm but anyway that's er another
S0282	have you do they copy you in on the email to germany
S0645	no he's wait for the suppliers to get back to him
S0282	cos i bet you any money at all if you email the suppliers direct you'd get a you'd get a better response and a quicker response than via
S0282	do you know who make it
S0645	no it's their it's their manufacturer be in germany
S0645	i think it's in germany the name be german isn't it
S0282	oh right there's probably a factory manager
S0645	yeah
S0282	who will respond to you before you've even finish your email
S0645	well i'll prompt him again tomorrow cos that'll have be a week again then erm and just see what he say cos as far as i'm concern we need to know about the legs
S0282	yeah
S0645	we've we've gotta have the legs otherwise there's no point in have that furniture
S0282	oh yeah no no absolutely absolutely
S0645	yeah
S0645	right okay so just come back to this then
S0282	yeah
S0645	er if i speak to then
S0282	yes
S0645	er and just send him an email just say can you give me a straight answer erm about
S0282	well i be erm er er what you could say in that email be that be about to contact you again about meet up again
S0645	mm
S0282	to sort of er progress discussions that you that we start last month but in the meantime i've get a query about the configuration of the sixth floor you know ie these beam the metal and the and the plaster beam that go across
S0645	er yeah
S0282	because erm you know i need to know whether they're structural and if so what be they hold up because erm we're think about renovate the space and we need to know you know which bits we can get rid of and which bits we can't
S0645	yeah
S0282	and we feel that this be probably work that you do as part of your your renovations so
S0645	well i would've think it would be a simple answer for er an architect whether it be him or not because he'll know what they be
S0282	oh you know what he well he's very obsessive about this build anyway
S0282	and he be sort of so over the moon it be quite funny have you get an eye infection there
S0645	no
S0282	make your eye go red
S0645	it's just itchy
S0282	be it
S0645	mm just dry i think
S0282	my eye yesterday i be do this iroko
S0645	mm
S0282	god be that stingy blimey
S0645	yeah iroko's thingy wood erm oh i can't remember what it's call now it's get load of sap stuff in it if it's not dry out properly
S0282	it be dry it be quite dry but it be erm it be very hard so when i be grind my hand be
S0645	mm
S0282	when i be take the stuff off it be come off in really little shave
S0645	yeah
S0282	and it be quite pungent and it be er go in my eye and up my nose
S0645	yeah there's some quite erm thingy there's some quite crazy wood that you get for do stuff like that with
S0282	mm
S0645	it's not the kind of stuff that you'd use in normal carpentry though erm right so after i've speak to we can speak or look at go to a floor company
S0282	yeah
S0645	and look at the differ things because if we can agree on two different things er two different products to go on the floor that will then give us an idea of what the spend it gonna be once i've speak to sort of i dunno a a rubbish clearance company or something like that
S0282	yeah
S0645	or a general builder or something because get the rubbish down the waste from these down will be a job
S0282	yeah
S0645	i don't wanna do it through the build if we can possibly avoid it
S0282	it would be nice if we could have a shute
S0645	you can have a shute but that'll need scaffold
S0282	really
S0645	yeah
S0282	okay well scaffolding's not that dear
S0645	no but it's just
S0282	yeah
S0645	it would it would only be a single storey it wouldn't be like a man scaffold unit
S0282	no
S0645	it would be just be scaffold and rig
S0282	yeah
S0645	to attach a thingy erm a shute a rubber shute to the to the erm what's it call
S0282	parapet
S0645	parapet on that on that corner of the roof there
S0282	yeah
S0645	and everything could go out there
S0282	yeah
S0645	it'd just be put everything up which be easy enough
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm and that'd be the main cost i think erm in addition to the floor
S0282	yeah
S0645	cos that'd be i dunno a couple of days rather than about a week and a half
S0282	yeah
S0645	to get rid of the crap then erm and i think that would be the only big cost the rest of it would just be stuff that i could do with a couple of local tradesmen the painter that i've get the chippy that i've get could do it all as far as i'm aware erm i mean there's nothing else that couldn't be do wouldn't need any other build firm 's guy could come in and reset the electrics that be on the wall cos everything's surface mount it's easy enough i'll just undo all that break it down it's it's not hard erm
S0282	i think you'd turn over a new leaf
S0282	i think you have go beyond all this stuff now that you weren't
S0645	no i don't want to do it every day like i be do it once a week around the build but something big like this would be alright to do cos it would be an achievement rather than the rest of it's just like the forth bridge
S0282	i know
S0645	just constantly do stuff and then have to redo it so
S0282	you're gonna end up really possessive like don't touch my space
S0645	no it'll be alright
S0282	that's my space
S0645	it'd be it'd be good to convert it into something that's use cos at the minute er it's just not be use
S0282	no
S0645	it's kind of dead area really and even though it's turn over a very small amount of money with no hassle at all there's no knock on doors to get rent from this side it's just it's not
S0282	and what and how do you feel where's up to
S0645	i don't know i would have to speak to her basically and see what she say whether she'd consider it
S0282	be there any moan and groan about the facilities lately
S0645	er no not as much not as much but then there's not be any conversation at all really so if i a conversation i avoid erm
S0282	be they use the toilets down in the hub
S0645	erm i'm not too sure i have no idea i haven't see them in there
S0645	definitely
S0282	oh right no cos i be just wonder the sort of the complaint about students go in there might be cos that little spindly one be go in there
S0645	no no no no no it's definitely not them i watch a full day of cctv footage
S0645	er to check and no there isn't erm
S0282	much less interest than it use to be i dare say
S0645	yeah definitely erm no as far as i'm aware it would be a case of kick out and offer them that
S0645	cos that would be the only option as it stand at the minute consider i've just give who be still yet to move in like a sort of a nod that he's get at least eighteen months if not permanent
S0282	oh yeah
S0645	so i don't wanna dislodge anybody that's not permanent ongoing
S0282	no
S0645	i mean the way go on every other time you speak to him he could be go at the er sort of drop of a hat really i mean if his fund
S0282	carry him out with his fingernails still embed in the doorframe
S0645	yeah so as far as i'm aware there's nobody down that end of the down that end of the build that's show any sort of er inclination that they're gonna move soon so it would have to be a case of kick somebody out in addition
S0282	what about the people
S0645	may come or go but they wouldn't take that space
S0282	what space
S0645	the space
S0282	no
S0645	no they wouldn't they may use it
S0282	well not as a storage area they could have that
S0645	yeah but apparently it's not a storage apparently it's a kitchen and sort of staff room which be never use so it's just a case of it would be it would literally be an option of you've get two in this side i can offer you one down there or you can go sort of thing
S0282	they do like two offices they've always have two offices
S0645	yeah i i i fully understand that and if if they want them that's fine they're pay for em but to to move them rehome them wouldn't be an option unless we build an extra one in this end here and give them that one and sort of thing bang opposite each other cos have two disjoint ones wouldn't be an option
S0282	no
S0645	i don't think
S0282	no
S0645	they wouldn't have that at all
S0282	no no no no they'd want it right close to each other but be they really never in there
S0645	never in there never at all that i'm aware of obviously i'm not down there that much but
S0282	they have their microwave in there and their lunch and make coffee though don't they
S0645	yeah well yeah that's something that they could put in their space though
S0282	perhaps erm perhaps doesn't like them have food and drink round the tap and the post and stuff i mean it would be you they can't really send out envelop to people with sort of sticky paw all over em
S0645	no
S0282	where someone's be eat their kebab over the
S0645	yeah
S0282	packet
S0645	well erm it's it's obviously it's something that they do need but
S0282	please can you send me a new cd cos i drop my lunch on the last one
S0645	erm it's something that i just wouldn't be able to offer em as it stand at the minute
S0282	no
S0645	without create something but that would literally be the only other thing really erm the meet room i think we could sort of erm we could get by again with use one of the other space down the other end like you say about move the the partition wall further into the kitchen
S0282	yeah
S0645	and that'd create a space that's easily big enough for a meet room or erm we've always get the hub the hub be always gonna be
S0282	yeah
S0645	sort of available i mean obviously the meet would have to be push on a little bite
S0282	no well i mean the thing be about have this room it's about have access a us have access to the roof whenever we need it and not have to knock on doors because er we've see as with the people in the crypt you say we need permanent access to the electricity room and the gas room
S0645	yeah
S0282	er and the the plant and everything and then you have to argue with them to get a bloody key and then and then er before you turn round they've change the lock so you have to get another key
S0645	mm
S0282	and then there's an instance they ask for the key back et cetera when this er there be a set of people who be in this office for a really long period of time get in this office to get on the roof be the a right royal pain cos you could never get in
S0645	well if this be on
S0282	and then secondly then as soon as we get as soon as they leave and get in we discover that they have be they have get deck chair out there they be lie sunbathe on the roof all the tile be break where they'd be clamber all over the roof
S0645	mm
S0282	and get up there and god know what they'd be up to out there it be just er you know you have to honestly save people they've get to have the key to the door so you can't stop them go out there and the next minute they're scramble all over the roof like they're
S0645	mm well the point of have this as an open space would make it very easy to get access to the bell tower door and that roof door
S0282	mm
S0645	because you just say to people that i dunno say we have in here at the same time as the people go on the roof just say to em today you can either not have your session or you could have a little bite of interruption with come and go from the roof it's not in use all the time it's more of an emergency access and when we do need access to it it's plan
S0282	yeah
S0645	i mean i'm the only person that go out there without plan it cos i don't have to tell people what i'm do
S0282	yeah
S0282	by the way have you do a
S0645	i've check er it's on a reminder on the phone yeah er every fortnight i go out there and check em at the minute they're alright
S0282	oh good and how many dead pigeons be out there
S0645	erm there's less than normal i think
S0282	actually the other thing to put on the list on our maintenance list for next year be to have that net have someone sort out that net again because
S0645	yeah
S0282	those watch those pigeons die of hunger gradually and then drop off bite by bite be disgust and they're get in somewhere the stupid twit well how they can i don't know why they can get in and not out do you say they can only fly upwards or something or downwards or something be there somebody say about pigeons they they can't fly in every direction
S0645	i don't know i don't think they can fly backwards
S0282	but then they can get in they sort of walk along the ledge and they can't they can't remember how to get back out again
S0645	i think i think they just sort of yeah i think they're crawl in there from one of the other side and then they're not use their brain to know that they've walk in they can walk out and they're panic they're try to flap out and not come out er
S0282	yeah they've only get a brain the size of a pea
S0645	yeah but they're also they're also put their nest up there so i think some of them be actually be bear on the ledge
S0645	and be in and out of it and then obviously they get big one day and they can't fit through the hole any more so but i dunno i i think it's just
S0282	mm and do you say that somebody's get a hawk or something we could have a hawk
S0645	no there be a hawk there be definitely a pigeon hawk or a kestrel hawk or whatever you get
S0282	we could have a bird of prey up here that would be really fun wouldn't it
S0645	i don't think you can just get a bird of prey i think you need them to naturally to be in the area
S0282	no no no there's no no no there be a feature on the on the radio yesterday about erm there's this guy who run they they they they do have get the contract for trafalgar square so they go out to
S0645	yeah
S0282	trafalgar square with a bird once every couple of weeks and
S0645	yeah
S0282	and when we've get the peace garden we can have we can have a we could have falconry
S0645	well i be think about erm the erm city beekeeping initiative thing
S0282	oh that would be fun wouldn't it
S0645	they do these plastic beehive things that you put out and erm we'd put it on the other side cos the other side be much less erm access
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm and it'd really good
S0282	i the other thing that i'd really like to do as well be have erm you can encourage swifts to nest as well
S0645	mm
S0282	er apparently you can get a tape which you play which have get swift noise on it so it make other swifts think oh that oh hang on
S0645	mm
S0282	that's a nice neighbourhood
S0645	mm
S0282	and then they come and er roost because erm they're run out of place to roost and the their number and diminish and i think it would be really fun
S0645	i think the roof be yeah i think the roof's best to er have no bird on it at all cos of the amount of crap out there at the minute be no good i mean er after speak to the roofer last time he say basically just get a spray and just clean it out and bleach it all and it'll stop all the slime but it's just something that you just constantly need to be do
S0282	yeah no look at those weed as well
S0645	yeah
S0282	you need to get out there with your weed spray
S0645	yeah erm actually have somebody in the in the car park this morning when i drive in do chemical spray of all the cobble and around the edge of the build
S0282	oh yeah
S0645	cos be pull her face at it the other day when she walk out she's like that's disgust like yeah i've have a go at it a few time myself but it's just a constant battle so
S0282	be she impress
S0645	a couple of weeks later
S0282	that you have have a go at it
S0645	er yeah yeah but i think it's just a case of that it's just an ongoing thing that the street care team or whoever it be the grass cut guy just don't bother do it
S0282	no
S0645	and they don't do the privets and
S0282	no
S0645	you know it's just a bite of a pain
S0282	i be just look at them this morning and think that
S0645	yeah they're get ridiculous i go to park my car against em the other day and without drive into the privet my car be stick right out
S0282	mm
S0645	so unless you've get a small car those gap
S0282	oh
S0645	those er thingies those park space be not big enough any more to cut that back
S0282	no but also then when the privet grow that's when people start break into cars because they can't be see from the road so actually the bloody things need to be down at knee height
S0645	yeah well erm i'll try and get that get er get on to to get that sort er erm because as far as i'm concern if i've gotta close the car park for a day just to get those guy in to do it then it's worth do
S0282	well we can i mean if we know erm if we know when they're come we can have everybody move you know just park that bite further out or park in front of the build
S0645	well i'll just i'll just do the same arrangement as a wed or a thingy just get the four or five cars
S0282	mm
S0645	that need to be in for the day
S0282	mm
S0645	in and then the guy can get in and cut
S0282	mm
S0645	and then go away again although they're not friends any more cos i have a go at them about chop the fence down didn't i
S0282	er yeah yeah
S0645	and it's the same team
S0282	be it
S0645	yeah it will be
S0282	they must be subcontractors of subcontractors i mean they're just
S0645	they be but i think these guy be all take on from because they'd be there so long
S0282	oh really
S0645	yeah i think that's what they do
S0282	oh they've be tupe'd across
S0645	yeah they've all be tupe'd across
S0645	cos the guy even the young guy be adamant he'd be work there for years and years and years and they actually all wear erm brand clothe and everything they don't wear like or anything like that erm when you get people come out do the fountain and the erm ground work and stuff like that they all wear erm i can't remember the name of the company now but whatever company it be erm
S0282	it's not really er it's it's er it's the other frog one erm sorry the other french one
S0645	yeah
S0282	erm
S0645	i can't remember who it be now the south african guy work for him from er i can't remember the name now but anyway yeah those they they actually have different uniform so these guy who come out to do the privets will be the people that i've have word with already which be great
S0282	yeah
S0645	so anyway just go back to this so we can write that down so
S0282	yeah
S0645	i'll speak to i'll tell him that you're gonna contact him anyway when do you wanna go and see floor
S0282	er well yeah do you want to go
S0645	there's a place
S0282	i don't mind go today i haven't get my car have to go in your car
S0645	erm we can go this afternoon if you like i've get nothing else to do once i've finish off the schedule erm we can do that so we'll go and view floor there's a place in and there's one closer which be i'd prefer to go to the one
S0282	yeah no 's fine
S0282	i haven't be to for a while i don't mind have a little a little out to
S0645	yeah okay we'll do that
S0282	and now you're mobile again
S0645	yeah view floor today price cos erm i know obviously what the erm the jigsaw floor the jigsaw mat look like cos every gym that i've ever be in have have them
S0282	yeah
S0645	and i know they're hardwearing they're basically really good for soundproof and sound insulation er
S0282	oh no i think that's a good idea i mean i don't i mean this stuff be disgust i think
S0645	it's crap laminate but it's good for a base you can lay on the top of it
S0282	yeah
S0645	which be then call a float floor what you're mean to do be have this stuff call erm soundboard which be green sort of medium density sort of like mdf but papery look
S0282	yeah
S0645	these board that go down and you do like a tile floor of that and then you put laminate on top
S0645	with erm a foil back on it that's a proper laminate floor installation
S0282	mm
S0645	but obviously this hasn't get it cos you can feel it hasn't get
S0282	no no no this be as cheap as chip
S0645	yeah
S0282	this be this be from you know sort of er well in fact we have use to be a
S0645	mm
S0282	a floor merchant oh no we have the be it be a floor workshop and then in the end we just go in there and get the cheapest possible
S0645	well to be honest the lino now the final lino floor that look like erm oak plank be better than this we have it down downstairs remember the stuff that i pull up
S0282	yeah yeah
S0645	that look really good compare to this and it last longer than the laminate as well if you get any chair and stuff bang against this too much
S0282	yeah
S0645	it'll go quickly
S0282	no and it's horrible round the edge this sort of er trim that you put round the edge look really crap
S0645	yeah
S0282	but erm er yeah i think and also it's i think it's quite nice have a quite a nice bright colour
S0645	well a bright
S0282	quite bright colour as you say
S0645	yeah
S0282	and also then if we get to actually polish it properly
S0645	mm
S0282	then you know it'll come up with a nice buff and it'll look good
S0645	and you can see it's be clean and er and this stuff just look
S0282	yeah yeah it do it can you know
S0645	mm
S0282	yes and you look down and you think oh we have somebody work here
S0645	mm
S0282	who and i think she have false hair and when you sit in her seat and look at the floor you could see
S0645	yeah that be in the offices yeah find some of that when i be move the office round
S0282	er horrible horrible
S0645	erm so go on to spend then as you've probably just overhear with i've come in under budget on what i be mean to spend on cos i've not do a few job they've put a few job off mainly by the contractors not come back to me and also by just prioritise what need to be do
S0282	yeah
S0645	er be you happy for me to carry on have the painter do job work and possibly his dad do a little bite more with the doors and stuff
S0282	no no that's absolutely fine if you're happy with the quality of their work
S0645	it's fine for it's fine for this i wouldn't have him decorate my house but he's he's fine for these kind of space you know
S0282	they do look a bite er be they they don't look as if they're the sharpest tool in the box those two when you look at them
S0645	i don't know they're just lads really aren't they i think they're the kind of people that leave school and go straight on to like build sit and stuff you know
S0282	mm
S0645	if his dad's a chippy he's probably do his apprenticeship when he be on his six week holiday or get er suspend from secondary school or whatever
S0645	and instead of go to college or whatever he's do that erm
S0282	well if you're as long as you're happy with them i mean they won't be a permanent solution cos nobody be but while they while they're good and they're do good work for us then then that's fine by me i have no problem as long as they're invoice properly and we're not pay them out of petty cash and stuff like that which be what i really object to
S0645	no well erm petty cash have only be use for materials which it's gotta be and it's just the same as me go up the road and buy it and just come back with the receipt and do it all properly erm other than that no his his actual wag his hours for a day's work be get pay by a cheque i've tell him that i can get him a cheque really quickly now at the minute
S0282	yeah
S0645	with be in the build
S0282	yeah
S0645	and also like today if he want the cheque for a hurry cos he's go on holiday and i'm then go on holiday we can just write him the limit you know
S0282	yeah
S0645	er so it's all be do above above board and by the book sort of thing
S0282	okay that's fine
S0645	so i'm gonna carry on with the
S0282	no no i just don't want to be somebody like you end up with where you know he just well anyway
S0645	mm
S0282	erm
S0645	well to be honest there's not really any need for another general builder at the minute erm speak to him yesterday he do know somebody that can do installation of vinyl floor like you know the guy that come from do the heat laminate floor
S0282	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0645	he's get a guy down the road work on some flats for or 's house company whatever it be erm and they're gonna do that
S0282	okay
S0645	erm and i mean they're do that now and i've say to him maybe i'll get him in to redo the bathroom erm gents floor and the ladies at some point because the paint's just not stand up to the wee basically
S0282	oh really
S0645	yeah it's come off already
S0282	already
S0645	yeah if you have a look in the gents in the cubicles and in front of the urinal where you're gonna get piss splash on the floor it's come up it be eat away at it
S0282	you're joke
S0645	no it's eat away but he say that's because it's water base paint which be mean to be oil proof for like in a car er from in a garage it's garage floor paint
S0282	yeah
S0645	so it's be design to be oil proof but you've obviously get erm er well i can't remember what the chemical be in urine
S0282	urea
S0645	no there's something else it's
S0282	ammonia
S0645	yeah ammonia ammonia will break it down because it's erm water base whereas if it's an oil base paint ammonia won't break it down
S0282	but should should shouldn't he know that
S0645	well he he know that now
S0282	but he should well
S0645	cos er no cos he come to me and say oh i'm really sorry but the floor's lift i be like no it's alright i've see it it's not lift where you've actually do the work where people aren't pee on it but where they be pee on it it's come away so they're pee on it it's sit there for a day the cleaner's go in the next day and it's it's take the colour out of it
S0282	by that time it's
S0645	yeah it's by that time it's sit on it
S0282	so be it visibly horrible
S0645	in patch it's only small patch like that at the minute but yeah it's it's not gonna look good for very long so what i'm say be what i will get the guy to do be i will get the guy to do a little run a little square with offcuts cos we've say that we might be able to get it on the cheap from his job that he's do at the minute
S0282	oh
S0645	from his waste and just do the the the cubicles
S0282	right
S0645	cos that's where it's gonna be worst and then the bite in front of the urinal we can do at a later stage but it's a bite of an issue er
S0282	so what would he do would he kind of he would get cubicle shape
S0645	well he he'll have offcuts
S0282	cubicle size offcuts and then what weld them together with the with the sticky with the silicone sticky underneath the underneath the
S0645	yeah he he say he do it with the strip but i don't think because of the size of the erm the cos of the size of the erm space that we're talk about the strip wouldn't be need for join the strip would be need just to sort of join it to the the the erm
S0282	to the wall
S0645	yeah to the wall of the cubicle
S0282	oh yeah cos the wall of the cubicles go down to the floor don't they
S0645	yeah yeah they touch
S0282	right okay so that's fine so all you need be an oblong of
S0645	yeah yeah just about i dunno er i dunno a metre by a metre for each one so he need four four square metres
S0282	yeah okay
S0645	and which i'm pretty certain they can just write off in a day
S0282	yeah
S0645	so i'll get him to do that if i can and that will just be a cash job and i'll just make it out that i pay for the materials and they do that themself
S0282	okay
S0645	erm cos that would be the same
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm so i'll get that do if i can
S0282	well no i think i think that need to be do as soon as possible cos i think it's
S0645	well it's the floor that's make the space look so good
S0282	yeah
S0645	so i don't want the floor be er be rough
S0282	yeah no you're gonna get you're gonna get a repeat of exactly the same problem again
S0645	yeah but some idiot have go in there already and it's a good job that he's not actually make it into that cubicle yet with the the top coat of paint and scratch his name in it scratch his name in the back of the door and in the cubicle so that piss me off already the other day but erm
S0282	so be that a child from or be that er
S0645	it's not a child from it's definitely not a child from cos it's not childish write it's basically somebody write in big letter twice in what i would assume be basically someone who's not very cool who think they can graffiti it cos it's not do in like your average outdoor graffiti style write
S0282	but be that i think the students at be more mature now
S0645	no
S0645	i think they're slightly older
S0282	do you think it's one of them
S0645	definitely it's either one of them or someone from krav maga
S0282	oh
S0645	but i don't think it's somebody from krav maga i i don't see why they would go and sit in a cubicle and scrape their name in the wall
S0282	why not
S0645	because they're too busy they're all quite straight bods and they be busy when they're in the build they're not the kind who want to go and sit in the toilets you know
S0282	so be it sit height or stand height
S0645	it's the sit height
S0282	really
S0645	yeah so somebody be sit in the toilet bore cos you wouldn't go into the toilet and be busy do what you're do and do that you know it's somebody who's sit in the toilets bore on their phone and just
S0282	multitasking
S0645	yeah some idiot but no it's not it's it's the style of write isn't a child's style of write it's definitely not
S0282	how stupid honestly i mean have see that
S0645	well i don't know er
S0282	so have you say something to about it
S0645	i don't know whether anybody's see it it's it's scrap into it with a key or something sharp
S0282	yeah
S0645	something sharp and thick
S0282	it's have you say anything to or about it
S0645	no cos the toilets aren't finish yet if the first thing that happen when the toilets be finish i will go and check cos i do check the name against cos it's it's literally so it's like
S0282	and be there and er be there a
S0645	there's nothing that correlate from the erm student list at the minute but then it could be a nickname i don't know
S0282	yeah well you er perhaps you could get erm to go in there with a piece of paper and say i've get a note for and see if anybody stand up
S0645	there'd there'd be a way of check but
S0282	yeah
S0645	like i say once it's finish once it be finish i will be sort of erm more on it than that and i be go to do something i'm go to do like a toilet attendance sheet or something for the guy so when they're mean to be do their internal chores they can go and check the toilets cos it's start to annoy me now erm so yeah that'll be something that we'll be do but anyway i'm gonna carry on get and possibly his dad to carry on do the cosmetic stuff
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm the store's pretty much build in the fourth floor he's gotta come back on monday to finish it cos
S0282	oh
S0645	the timber that they sell they only sell full sheet and he need half sheet and if he buy full sheet he's gonna end up with too much waste and consider he's do that at price it's gonna eat into his money that he's get pay so he's gonna come back monday and put the lid on it and then 's gonna paint it it's fine perfectly fine it's actually quite huge erm but it'll be good enough for the krav maga guy
S0282	and it's look alright do it
S0645	it'll be fine it's make out of sterling board
S0645	it's make out of sterling board and it's it's er to to that single single roof height so basically this height roof
S0282	right
S0645	in the corner so once it's paint it'll look like it's always be there
S0282	right yeah
S0645	and it'll be fine depend what lock i put on the door will make it look slightly different
S0282	okay yeah you don't want anything too industrial look on it then
S0645	so i'm gonna have a look at the ironmongery on it well i might just put a single erm shackle and erm thingy like on it shackle and padlock like i've get in the kitchen there on it something like that cos it can't have a erm because it's double doors without a post
S0282	yes
S0645	it can't have a normal lock
S0282	no because otherwise people can just push it
S0645	yeah erm so i'll have to have a look but i'll try and get something that look nice and neat
S0282	yeah no i mean something that look a bite more decorative
S0645	mm
S0282	and like you know
S0645	well that's what i mean if i get a like a nice chrome one or something something that doesn't look like it would go outside something that be definitely for inside
S0282	oh no that's that little fly be it
S0645	yeah erm
S0282	we've only get one little fly haven't we
S0645	yeah i think so yeah
S0645	erm something that's definitely for inside rather than outside as well i won't put anything horrible on it but it need to be something secure enough to make it erm make it that it's get to be break for someone that want to get in there that shouldn't be get in there
S0282	yeah
S0645	so i'll do something like that erm he's gonna then blank off the two set of doors that we're no longer use
S0282	yeah excellent
S0645	so he's get he's get some board to go over those
S0645	he's just literally gonna blank them
S0645	erm to the actual doorframe flush fit so if we ever need to use them in the future you just
S0282	yeah
S0645	literally pry the piece of timber out
S0282	yeah
S0645	so that's easy enough
S0645	so i'm gonna maybe get him to do some stuff like that around the place as well erm
S0282	oh er yeah no i've get another couple of suggestions
S0645	mm
S0282	which be that erm the entrance er somebody comment the other day that the doors into the community hall look really
S0645	yeah
S0282	and so we we should get a coat of paint on them
S0645	well that's it that's the the the thing i'm gonna get do job be basically just start with things like that
S0282	yeah yeah
S0645	so all the all the all the doors that be unglossed
S0282	and that and that and the corridor out there
S0645	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0645	all the doors that be unglossed i'm gonna get him to gloss over
S0282	yeah
S0645	and fix up anything like the pane of glass that's in it i might get that remove
S0282	yeah
S0645	or just take out or whatever whatever's easy erm then if there's anything that be not match like we've get the brown stuff that like level two to three it go brown for a time
S0282	yeah
S0645	i want all that do and the blue all blue uniform erm and then if there's any job for his dad to do carpentry wise
S0282	yeah
S0645	i'll get him to come and do those
S0282	and also the door into the ladies loo have get have peel
S0645	yeah yeah
S0282	cos it's a laminate door
S0645	well that just need a coat of paint a coat of paint really for the time be
S0282	yeah although there's a bite that i sort of could pull at this morning
S0645	right okay
S0282	where er there's er just a little there's just a little strip of
S0645	well if you just cut it just take more off it and cut it so it's square that'll be fine then
S0282	mm mm but yeah it do i mean the ladies look immensely better already
S0645	well just yeah the coat of paint that go in on there the other day have make it lift
S0282	yeah yeah it's er yeah absolutely hugely better
S0645	yeah totally lift it mm
S0282	and then also wherever there's a coat of paint and it's look that's look good that corridor in the the original and the actual exist cupboard and it'd be really nice to kind of lighten the colour of those so that corridor as you go into the community hall be lighter as well
S0645	the the sort of yeah the the the old chill out space
S0282	yeah
S0645	well i need a light in there
S0282	yeah
S0645	but at the minute we've get issue with the with the electrics the electrics be still throw up problems erm
S0282	oh
S0645	with regard to the erm circuit board that be in there the circuit board that's in there come down the other day this be obviously do it themselves
S0282	yes
S0645	basically the circuit board that's in there the breakers that they've get be not sell by any electrical wholesaler the only place that still sell them be b and q so it's basically it's it's it's trade electronics at retail level
S0282	well it's yeah it's no it's
S0645	so
S0282	er it's or who be 's right hand men
S0645	mm
S0282	do a bite of their their er you know impromptu electrics that they be do all over the build all the time and you know they take they take a light spur off the
S0645	mm
S0282	off the fire system in the cleaner's cupboard and stuff like that they be always sort of er why how come they never get kill themselves or anything i really really don't know they be just they be they be absolute maniacs and they be always you get it
S0645	yeah
S0282	erm and so there be place all over the build where i mean all that rig and all those light the light and you know people say things be latch on with bits of string
S0645	yeah
S0282	and stuff like that that's all them that's their handiwork they be just honestly erm er it's a miracle that this build be still stand up quite frankly and we haven't have a fire so yes they would've do they would've mess around with the board in there
S0645	mm well erm as far as i'm aware
S0282	and where be the board for that bite
S0645	they're both in that space
S0282	oh be they
S0645	one to the right one to the leave
S0282	right
S0645	the one to the leave we've have the community space light switch for the new uplighters and the ceiling light remove so if you look at the blank door that we use to use into that space
S0282	mm
S0645	on the wall there there be now three socket three switch one's a blank switch which be gonna be an emergency light i think
S0282	mm
S0645	at some point in the future
S0282	mm
S0645	one be the hall light and one be the ceiling light so nothing on that board which have now get the krav maga storage unit build around it need to be access on a daily basis
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm the the the fuse board to the right control weird stuff like bits of the ladies toilets and the erm clean cupboard erm
S0282	oh yeah yeah
S0645	i don't know what else it control but basically that's the board that need to be make safe
S0282	yeah
S0645	there need to be more breakers go in it
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm the gents toilet control be literally on one switch in the board that's now get the krav maga store build around it so that's there nothing in there need to be access on a daily basis
S0282	no
S0645	erm yeah we've er we're get to the bottom of it what i will have by the end of this remedial work be do be a full map of everything like that
S0282	yeah
S0645	so i'll be able to refer to a piece of paper and say right that's control from there
S0282	yeah okay well we have that before but yes it obviously need update cos we've do
S0645	yeah well things have be move and split now board have be erm yeah board have be break down
S0282	yeah and also the other thing that i be gonna say be that erm now that our community hall be not use for a nightclub or any other mass entertainment thing
S0645	mm
S0282	we don't need those two wide fire escape down to the front doors of the portico so only one of the fire escape need to be a fire escape the other one doesn't need to be a fire escape anymore and quite frankly when we have the peace garden
S0645	mm
S0282	we might need to use one of those space as a kind of storage space or something for garden equipment the one the one that only go up to the back of the fourth not erm you know the one there's the one that serve sixth
S0645	yeah
S0282	which be outside 's office
S0645	that's the right hand side one
S0282	that's the right hand side one and that go from top to bottom
S0645	yeah if you're in the community space
S0282	so that serve
S0645	yeah
S0282	us up here
S0645	mm
S0282	and the fourth floor
S0645	yeah
S0282	and the one on the other side that only come up to the fourth floor
S0645	yeah
S0282	we could reuse that and make that into er you know i know it's get stairs and er it's not
S0645	well no it's it's it's get three full land on it
S0282	yeah and there's space at the bottom
S0645	but the church have gotta use it the church have gotta use that on er at first floor above grind
S0645	cos it be theirs cos it's it's their second fire escape there's two fire escape there's a mirror of fire escape on the
S0282	yes yes they've get four fire escape haven't they
S0645	yeah they've get two down below that
S0282	yeah
S0645	but if they've get them they need to be able to use them
S0282	no no but then we take it out of service cos they can it's no longer a fire escape and get them to take the light off the exit
S0645	oh right okay yeah yeah
S0282	we say okay when you're on the mezzanine and your level you can either go to the right
S0645	there's a fire exit to the right down
S0282	to get out the front of the build or you can go to the back and onto the central staircase so you've still get three fire exit at mezzanine level
S0645	yeah
S0282	but erm or or be it two but you shouldn't have there shouldn't be that many people on the mezzanine that there's a crush to get out and that people will need a metre wide sort of exit so i would've think that cut one of those stop it be a fire exit would be and then also all we need to do then be sort of blank off the glass so that when you come in through the through their front entrance into their space they can't see that there's a storage space on the other side
S0645	mm mm
S0282	so that you know but erm but then that could also be another storage area at some point you know if we want er or actually if we want to reverse the build and have the garden stuff at the back of the build
S0645	mm
S0282	up the back fire escape we could then make the front fire escape a storage space
S0645	mm but you can't go right the way the build through the back fire escape cos it only go to
S0282	yeah no no no i know no no no i what i'm talk about be you know the space where have get the last of his stuff
S0645	oh yeah yeah
S0282	under the back stairs
S0645	yeah
S0282	so those storage space where we've get two church
S0645	mm
S0282	
S0645	yeah
S0282	those storage you could reverse it out so that you've get storage space at the front so the people who've get storage at the back behind the hub
S0645	yeah well that'd mean that they didn't need any access from us then basically
S0282	yeah
S0645	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0645	yeah cos they'd just come out and go through the inner doors of the church reception or church foyer but
S0282	yeah yeah
S0645	yeah okay
S0282	so actually yes the land outside the back of on the mezzanine level
S0645	could be their storage
S0282	that that could be their storage area
S0645	they wouldn't pay us for that though
S0282	
S0645	we're we're only make five hundred quid a year anyway it's just it's not even here nor there erm
S0282	mind you if they'd have to take it down the spiral stairs then wouldn't they they wouldn't be please about that
S0645	no cos they could us the big stairs in front of them no just use the inner door of the foyer
S0282	yes i suppose so
S0645	mm
S0282	that's true
S0645	anyway erm i think that's enough to be go on with erm i can't think of anything else that we need to discuss obviously erm i'm on holiday a week today
S0282	yes
S0645	erm i'm gonna leave him instructions that basically say he's gonna do i'm gonna put him on the rota for next week to do you know they're do split shift
S0282	yes
S0645	erm the only days that they're not do split shift be tuesday and a thursday so he's not gonna check erm the computer on tuesday or thursday cos he's not gonna have time
S0282	right
S0645	cos it's a really busy day but monday wednesday and friday
S0282	yeah
S0645	he's gonna do an hour or an hour and a half do er empty the voicemail and empty the i will change in fact i'll start at the begin i'm gonna change the voicemail erm in the office on the landline
S0282	yep
S0645	so he doesn't have to go into the office say please leave all voicemails on the mobile
S0282	yeah
S0645	and then we give him the mobile
S0282	good
S0645	so for that hour and a half he can turn on turn it on
S0282	no no no but actually i think somebody should have your mobile your work mobile during that week not you
S0645	mm i i don't think there's any need for it to be on all the time he's just gonna get pointless enquiries that he's not gonna be able to answer while he's work
S0282	no no no but it's about answer the phone though it be about answer the phone when somebody ring up somebody answer the phone and you don't have somebody say oh i'll come back to you in you know next week or something
S0645	okay office
S0282	i mean if if you don't wanna hand your phone over hand the sim over
S0645	it's not about that i'm not bother about the handset it's more to do with thingy that he's actually get a job to do on reception so he's get the security phone he's get that phone and then he's get the whole
S0282	yeah but i mean even if you just even if whoever's there just check it twice a day or something
S0645	mm
S0282	or answer it when they can or be just aware that it's ring and that there's an enquiry then i think that you know somebody pick up the phone and say oh sorry 's on holiday do you need can you leave it till he get back or do i need to do something now so that at least we know you know cos there be that glitch that time when erm when you couldn't get hold of for example
S0645	yeah
S0282	and i can see that sort of situation turn up where somebody sort of say somebody phone up and say oh help help there's something urgent and there's nobody at the other end listen to the message oh yes cos have leave the phone at work so when you be phone him up say where be you
S0645	yeah
S0282	it be actually just phone to the reception desk where he wasn't
S0645	right okay so what i'm gonna do be i'm gonna put an office close use mobile voicemail on on the office landline
S0282	yeah yeah
S0645	then 's gonna have the phone
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm in fact the phone can stay in the box office
S0282	yeah
S0645	so whoever's on can answer it
S0282	yeah
S0645	when they can
S0282	yeah
S0645	basically just take down message
S0282	and if it's on the premise then they're not get random call at night which they don't
S0645	well yeah it can stay here then
S0282	yeah
S0645	and then when i phone the security phone
S0282	yeah
S0645	if i need to i can actually get any number that they've get that i've get on there off it
S0282	yeah
S0645	cos that's the only reason i don't leave it erm then i'm gonna get to do one and a half hours on monday wednesday and friday on the pc which be the old enquiries pc which i'm gonna set up in the hub
S0282	yeah
S0645	so he can go into the hub sit at a hot desking station and just and answer all the erm email i'm gonna leave him a template basically with a can't take any book until such and such a date cos we can't we've get nothing available
S0282	yeah
S0645	erm and i'm gonna take basically sacrifice the one work day that we have get off that we have get free while i'm off just to say that we can't do anything with it basically unless someone come down and pay cash to use the meet room can't do anything
S0282	yep
S0645	and i'll just leave him a cut and paste erm response basically say back on the second of november or whatever day it be so that's it erm and that's it there's only new business come up for church 's go basically erm
S0282	oh
S0645	church she didn't turn up for two weeks so i've remove her from the schedule erm this sunday
S0282	have you double check with er
S0645	no not yet i be gonna wait until i get back which be give her three weeks so then if she's really ill or something and she's just not bother to tell me
S0282	yeah
S0645	she'll be better by then and she can come back
S0282	yeah
S0645	if she doesn't come back for the first week of november i've already line up a church to go in her spot
S0282	oh really
S0645	yeah
S0282	oh that's really good
S0645	so
S0282	and they're pay more i hope
S0645	oh they will be pay
S0282	and they're and they're and they're gonna pay in advance
S0645	they'll they'll pay more they'll pay upfront basically
S0282	yeah
S0645	the way they should do because they'll be take a bigger spot i think they want a three hour service
S0282	yep
S0645	so it'll be a ten till two
S0282	oh brilliant
S0645	or ten till one or thereabouts
S0282	okay
S0645	so that's basically it that's all i've really gotta tell you about for when i go off erm
S0282	okay we've get seven minutes more to go
S0645	okay
S0282	before i it's an hour well we can or four five or six
S0645	erm so that's all i've gotta do for that we've agree that 's gonna have a sub of three seventy five
S0282	yeah
S0645	for his erm rent deposit
S0282	yeah
S0645	and he's gonna pay that back er just to clarify with you now once i give out i'm do the hours up right the way until the end of the year
S0282	mm
S0645	for the guy erm i'm gonna give a rough estimate of what 's gonna do to year end he's then gonna give me a figure that be owe in holiday hours
S0282	right
S0645	i've tell that he's get to use it all in january
S0282	right
S0645	so be okay to use his holiday in january but for business erm purpose only because it suit us
S0282	oh er okay well i mean have you talk have you talk have you talk to him about what he want to do
S0645	erm how do you feel about him cash any of it in he doesn't wanna work he doesn't want any holiday he doesn't want time off
S0282	ah you see there's er something you didn't have holiday and then he go sick
S0645	no but he's get a erm he want to go back on his own shift rotation
S0282	yeah
S0645	which he's do now definitely
S0282	yeah
S0645	but he doesn't want any more time off than he's get
S0282	how many days have he will he have by the end of december
S0645	i don't know i would estimate that he's probably get er he's be here what two or three months two two months yeah he'll probably have about three to four weeks i reckon
S0282	what he's not take any holiday
S0645	no he's not have any holiday no
S0282	oh christ
S0645	he's just do load of days straight as well so what i'm suggest be if he's get four weeks come
S0282	yeah
S0645	that we let him use half of it and let him cash half of it in
S0282	yeah no i think that's a good compromise actually that give him a nice bonus and it say thank you to him for work so hard and then we should also give it to him at christmas so that he's get something
S0645	okay
S0282	nice for christmas i think yeah so
S0645	right all holiday to use in jan fifty percent cash in available
S0282	yeah yeah cos otherwise well i mean who know what's gonna happen in january you know the er i mean
S0282	it'll be just be our luck if he go off on a month's holiday and and then get a sore throat or something
S0645	well what i've gotta
S0282	oh when's his when's his baby due
S0645	that's what i be come to then what i've gotta do be i've gotta sit down and find out with what the due date be and what the plan be
S0282	yeah yeah
S0645	because i know that'll be the next issue
S0282	and be she in
S0645	she she be and she's gonna be up there until she's have the baby
S0282	oh god right
S0282	that mean he's gonna go at a moment's notice he's gonna just phone you up and say i've get to go to now
S0645	most likely
S0282	oh bugger
S0645	what i've gotta do be i've gotta sit down with and we do it the other night very briefly cos she's just get her holiday entitlement
S0645	erm for yeah for the next come full term which be basically
S0645	into next year so when she finish
S0282	marital relations good then be they
S0645	great yeah erm until august so basically she'll be able to tell me when we're take our holiday start next year again
S0282	mm and you do remember of course that on every day that the build be close you have to take a day's holiday part of your holiday be the days on which the build be close
S0645	oh yeah my
S0645	my thirty days be include the
S0282	twenty third twenty fourth and
S0645	yeah
S0282	twenty eighth twenty ninth or whatever the work days be be part of your holiday
S0645	yeah
S0282	mm
S0645	well er i'm actually think i'm actually erm go away two days before we close this year we're not close much next year will be a bite of an issue cos there's a two week close down pretty much this year
S0282	mm
S0645	this year it's
S0282	how do you work that far ahead this be ridiculous
S0645	just because
S0645	the head it's it's
S0282	the hand
S0645	just just about christmas really
S0282	what be you do christmas two thousand and fifteen
S0645	two thousand and fifteen i dunno i'd like to be in india that'd be great
S0282	a cruise
S0645	erm if i could afford it i'd be in india er i'm not gonna be though
S0282	oh
S0645	erm
S0645	so yeah i'm gonna tell that basically
S0282	yeah
S0645	his holiday balance be x
S0282	yeah
S0645	and he can cash fifty percent of it in but he's gotta use or take the rest of it in january or lose it and then next year
S0282	er well er er actually before you do that though talk to about when his baby's due because
S0645	oh yeah that's
S0282	it it might be it might be sensible to say to you've get to use it by easter if it look like might have to rush up to in january
S0645	yeah
S0282	so it's no use say to he can have time off in january
S0645	no it's it's not that soon it's not that soon
S0282	isn't it
S0645	i think from when tell me probably we're talk go back it be about august so may june july august september october november december january february march i reckon it's gonna be at least march
S0282	okay okay
S0645	i think
S0282	alright but then perhaps perhaps you can give erm perhaps you can give till easter or something to use it up i don't approve of this this be actually it do say in his contract use it or lose it
S0645	it do say it but i'm not gonna enforce it to the point of like give him grief because it's his first time here and he's just do us a favour
S0282	well the thing be yes he have only just join here and we've work him really hard and we we make him work a month without stop essentially cos of 's holiday
S0645	yeah
S0282	so it would be it would be a bite mean and
S0645	well i kind of agree with already apart from the baby erm that next year when he want to take his three weeks so he can go away it will always be in august and i've say to him that i've already tell him that every year now i will not be go away for the first bite of august because i can't
S0282	mm
S0645	basically 's get all her extra holiday now she's a teacher rather than support staff she get all the six week holiday off bar four days
S0282	oh i didn't know she'd be promote
S0645	yeah she's get teach hours now
S0282	oh
S0282	so she's do her course she's start a teacher train course on tuesday even
S0282	oh brilliant
S0645	she's teach about six or eight hours a week over two days set and then she's do like bank cover as well so any teachers that can't do their lesson for whatever reason erm she
S0282	oh that's fantastic
S0645	yeah it's good it'll be alright
S0282	mm
S0645	in about a year or so she'll actually have some more decent money come in
S0282	excellent excellent
S0645	erm so basically that that dictate when i can and can't take holiday so i've say to him i've make a sort of friendly agreement with him i can't take the first few weeks of august off so if he plan to have an annual three week holiday
S0282	yeah
S0645	which he want to do
S0282	yeah
S0645	that he have to take it at the begin of august which mean i'm here plus a a security guard
S0645	at the minute or whatever
S0282	okay
S0645	so i will have a chat with i will have a chat with both tomorrow and as far as i'm aware that's it i'm not really worry about me go away for the week the build be at ninety nine percent capacity if any enquiries come in about this last office the woman who be mean to come tuesday didn't turn up
S0282	no
S0645	if any enquiries come about the office be more than capable and himself to show people and give it the hard sell
S0282	okay
S0645	erm the space downstairs fourth floor be only available monday's unless somebody turn up with cash and pay in advance which they're not go to
S0282	no
S0645	erm we're not gonna shift that day have just tell me that he doesn't want monday's

S0282	yeah
S0645	to discuss what he want to do
S0282	yeah
S0645	er and when he start pay erm
S0282	quite
S0645	other than that the meet room which again the guy could do with cash i can let em just do a cash deposit or or or cash up front for the meet room
S0282	yeah mm
