S0392	i know it's like they say that well we could let everybody have a bite of the world cup but to be honest it's a bite like have the winter olympics in france or no not france that's a really bad example somewhere with no snow have the winter olympics in where could you have the winter olympics that would have no snow mexico
S0391	do they not
S0392	yeah
S0391	get snow in cancun
S0392	no well actually somewhere no it's like have the winter olympics here cos it's a bite snowy sometimes but you can't rely on it like qatar it's probably a bite cold sometimes
S0391	cornwall
S0392	no no well even like yorkshire
S0391	mm
S0392	or cumbria where there's like enough mountains and stuff like in on paper it seem okay
S0391	oh like you'd get a ski jump and
S0392	but in practice it's not like you could play football in qatar
S0391	but you couldn't do
S0392	but in practice you couldn't really could you it's too hot
S0391	you'd struggle to get to ski jump in east anglia maybe or the fens
S0392	well yeah
S0392	i'm think more like the terrain's there but the weather
S0391	ah right
S0392	just sometimes be but sometimes isn't if you know what i mean
S0391	what do you call those things there
S0392	what things
S0391	in the front of the car erm

S0391	a minions film
S0392	yeah they're get their own but they're so good in despicable me i don't know whether
S0391	yeah they'll still make the profit won't they

S0391	only four out of three hundred and sixty nine families spot that their child be very overweight
S0392	well i don't know how they do those survey
S0391	they survey nearly three thousand families
S0392	yeah but
S0391	they probably just weigh their children and ask them
S0392	be your child obese well what if the child be
S0391	and they didn't reckon
S0392	listen you wouldn't want to say yes if they be listen would you really if you're
S0391	well i think it's a ticky box thing isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0391	they weight everyone in year six anyway

S0391	i have notice that our
S0392	yes
S0391	our year sixes have never there's no maybe even one person overweight but this year the first time ever i would say there be one two three four five so from like one it's go to
S0392	really

S0391	they do have a sweet tooth
S0392	yeah go to show how it's the sugar rather than the saturate fat stuff cos you can get rid of saturate fat easy by grow and stuff can't you but the sugar stay around a lot it's to do with refine like white sugar
