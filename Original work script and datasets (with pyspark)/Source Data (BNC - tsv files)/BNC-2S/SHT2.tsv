S0251	what be you do there
S0252	i'm i'm ah list eh a some of my old textbooks on ebay
S0251	oh that's a good idea you can get so many free list a month now can't you
S0252	yeah it's a i think it's a twenty free list which can be either an auction or a buy it now
S0251	oh right which do you normally prefer
S0252	it with both really i think one good thing about buy it now be that you can guarantee a price
S0251	yes
S0252	erm but i don't think erm if it's a more popular item that it ah you might have it for a long time whereas with an auction
S0251	yes
S0252	you do hopefully sell it before a set date
S0251	yes
S0252	whereas that it's not go to with a a buy it now
S0251	no although sometimes people can give you a best offer can't they
S0252	they can yes but i think my only concern with that be if there be the best offer option i feel as though i'm give them an invitation to offer less than what i want
S0251	yes
S0252	whereas if i just ask the price i want i'll get the price i want
S0251	yes mm
S0252	i don't particularly really want to start negotiate a price once i've decide
S0251	no although if you're buy something if you want to buy something have you ever have any success on negotiate a slightly better deal
S0252	erm i have have some limit successes i have have probably one very good success where i manage to get something for half the amount
S0251	mm wow
S0252	but it's usually at best within five to twelve percent
S0251	yeah just a pound or two
S0252	yes
S0251	which do you think be best for erm sell something ebay or amazon
S0252	again there's for and against with both erm i think the eh amazon platform be a little bite easier to work with
S0251	yes
S0252	that you don't have to take a picture
S0251	true
S0252	the description's already there
S0251	yes
S0252	basically you just have to give a condition
S0251	so it's quicker to do isn't it really
S0252	mm hm and also i think the erm products usually realise a higher price on amazon than on ebay which obviously be a good thing if you be buy
S0251	yes yes
S0252	erm but erm if you be sell you really want to go for amazon
S0251	if you want to sell yes but it really offer you a huge market if you've get something to sell doesn't it
S0252	yes it do and also there's more flexible for erm offer service to european countries and worldwide countries we have have a erm a couple of sales for things portugal and denmark as well
S0251	yes it's great isn't it although you get to be careful with the postage there because that can be quite pricey can't it
S0252	yes yes i think it's erm relatively expensive just to post them in the uk so
S0251	yes
S0252	it probably it's all be
S0252	much further oh aye
S0251	and it's also good say if you're look for a book that's out of print in the past if you go to all the second hand bookshops in your area and you hadn't find it you pretty much couldn't have it
S0252	no
S0251	but with the internet you can look at all the second hand bookshops that have get book available on the internet
S0252	you can within the uk and the world
S0251	yeah so you stand a good chance of find it
S0252	yes
S0251	if it be for sale somewhere that you
S0252	i'm hook with the so you can get it at a price that ah
S0251	yes or in best condition
S0252	mm yes
S0251	because the email have reduce the amount of letter post i would say because people ermerm be send more email but fewer letter but i think it's probably increase the amount of parcel post
S0252	it have
S0251	that's send
S0252	it have
S0251	with all these things that be put for sale people buy and sell well all kinds of commodities really
S0252	absolutely i think erm from the royal mail's point of view it it shouldn't make a lot of difference because obviously parcel realise a higher price at least a few pound to send
S0251	yes
S0252	whereas erm a small letter be maybe fifty sixty pence
S0251	yeah although there's a lot more competition now isn't there
S0252	there be
S0251	for the erm parcel post side of the business
S0252	ah to be honest they're not the most competitive for any parcel that be larger than a kilogram or erm that doesn't fit through the slot that be put in place
S0251	yes
S0252	erm other couriers tend to be ah a bite more generous on dimension
S0251	mm
S0252	and it's really more or less just price by weight
S0251	yes and ah be it hermes where you can print off the erm postal stamp on the computer
S0252	stamp yes
S0251	on your printer and then you take it to the ah local corner shop don't you
S0252	you do yes i think that erm follow a a german model where when the post be charge too much
S0251	oh right
S0252	erm they start pop up in erm corner shop
S0251	mm hm
S0252	erm that's now start to happen in this country as well
S0251	mm
S0252	but i think for erm larger parcel they be definitely a lot more competitive than royal mail
S0251	yes
S0252	and then but then that's erm if you're send an item between twenty and fifty pound worth of value except erm royal mail only go up to twenty pound on the second erm first class ah package whereas erm hermes can go up to fifty pound
S0251	yep yeah
S0252	ah but then that price so it just offer a little bite more protection without an additional fee
S0251	but be some of the other company that do parcel deliveries more for commercial
S0252	i think so really i think one of the main downsides be that they would have to come up to the house to pick the parcel up
S0251	yes
S0252	which would mean that you would be in all day wait for them to collect it whereas you can just drop it off at a corner shop you can do that when you want to really
S0251	mm yeerm that's right but some of the post box in our area be have fewer collections now aren't they
S0252	they be which be a bite of a disappointment i think really when you think that our post really come at well i don't know but sometimes one to two o'clock
S0251	yes
S0252	really that be the time when the box tend to be collect but i think really they're just use nine be because erm they don't really want to give a specific time which be really more or less when it suit them
S0251	no that's right because in the past the post use to come in the morning ah certainly before perhaps about nine o'clock sort of time
S0252	yeah
S0251	but now it seem to be come after lunch regularly now and it have be a lot later than that in some instance
S0252	it do it do sometimes up to six pm
S0251	i know i think that's dreadful
S0252	i know it almost mean that you receive the parcel the next day because you're not really able to act on it within that day any more
S0251	no that's right yes
S0252	but erm it be surprise how the erm dot com revolution have change erm even the post network
S0251	yes it have hasn't it
S0252	do you think that erm we use the postal service a bite more with me erm put book for sale
S0251	yes i think we do i think we've certainly buy a lot more online erm in the past few years and i think we've buy a wider range of goods online
S0252	mm yes
S0251	more recently erm book and sometimes clothe erm what else have we buy online
S0252	oh fridge freezer unit
S0251	really i think we do didn't we
S0252	we do
S0251	yes
S0252	yes
S0251	that be a very big item
S0252	it be and er
S0251	i think that be the biggest item we've buy online
S0252	yes and holiday
S0251	yes
S0252	well i suppose they're technically bigger in term of value
S0251	yes
S0252	yes car insurances home insurances erm well even to things erm like a tin of paint and er a pen er
S0251	yes yes yep yes all kinds of things so
S0252	yes i think one thing be it can be quite hard to erm find the things that you want with the local shop they might not necessarily have it in stock or the size or the colour
S0251	no that's right
S0252	and i think sometimes they can even charge a bite too much
S0251	mm
S0252	i think one good thing about the internet be you can compare all the different price before you purchase
S0251	that's right
S0252	so it should enable that you get at least a competitive price if not the best price available
S0251	yeah that's right one good thing about john lewis though be that if you do find it elsewhere cheaper and it's exactly the same
S0252	yes and in a shop
S0251	and in a shop they will do a price match won't they
S0252	i know it's very good that really
S0251	so
S0252	it do there be some items we've price match that there be be er be no way that we'd've be able to buy it from that shop really
S0251	no that's right because it be too far away or something
S0252	yes i mean for example the spade
S0251	yes
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah and the postage would've be a lot on that presumably cos quite heavy and a bulky object
S0252	yes they be yes er one thing that retailers seem to be do now be erm like er a click and collect service that you order it online and pick it up in store
S0251	yes
S0252	usually at a cheaper price or in some case free
S0251	mm
S0252	do you think that have catch on or
S0251	ah well when we have do click and collect there's always be one or two people collect things hasn't there
S0252	yes
S0251	and then it save you have to pay the postage
S0252	yes
S0251	although obviously you'd have to pay petrol
S0252	yes
S0251	to take your car there to go and collect the item don't you
S0252	you do that's but i suppose that aspect really you just ermerm in some ways reserve the item so you can pick it up and don't have to look for it or
S0251	no
S0252	risk someone else take it or
S0251	yes
S0252	but have say that i think some company actually use their erm online warehouse to
S0251	yes that's right
S0252	to be honest i don't think it really benefit the store in that respect unless impulse buy encourage the purchase
S0251	no yeah
S0252	do you think erm purchase things online will change even further some people have think of erm have a digital stream in tube station for people to order their groceries online
S0251	really while you're wait for your train
S0252	yes
S0251	yes well not a bad idea good use of time isn't it productive
S0252	yes all different amazon's sort of teleport fly device to drop off parcel in people's garden will catch on
S0251	i'm not sure about that what do you think
S0252	i think the erm american government have ban those because i think they're worry about security risk
S0251	mm
S0252	in regard to those devices
S0251	yes it all sound a bite strange
S0252	that's have you hear of any other ways that you think erm online shop may evolve
S0251	eh i can't think of anything at the moment
S0252	but erm even erm grocery shop have change as well
S0251	yes i know
S0252	but in some ways it's a bite like what it be before because erm people use to erm go into the shop with a list and then have it deliver by bicycle or van or
S0251	that's right the eh errands boy would bring it round for you
S0252	yeah so in some ways it's revert back to the past
S0251	yes it's back to that yeah yes
S0252	erm erm
S0251	yes because i didn't really feel attract to have the groceries deliver at first
S0252	no
S0251	and then now i've try it i've get really use to it and i've find it much more convenient and then during the week i just do little bits of shop extra that i might need like extra fresh vegetables or milk and things to top up as i go along but most of the shop i now get erm deliver from the online service
S0252	yes
S0251	i've really get to like it more than i imagine
S0252	yes i think one of the the best things about it be that you can just stay in the comfort of your own home when you order it and when you receive it that you don't have to go into a supermarket which can be quite noisy stressful park space you've get to load everything up and put it on the counter stand and then bag it up and then move it to the car and get out it's a try to time consume and unpleasant
S0251	mm that's right yes yes that's right yes it's very laborious it can be yes
S0251	and usually all the checkouts have get queue on you're wander up and down look for the shortest queue and realise they're all busy so you've just get to grin and bear it
S0252	yes probably bump into somebody that you be hop to avoid or
S0251	well possible
S0252	take up a bite of time
S0251	yes
S0252	also i think erm it substitute erm can be good at time it mean that you can sometimes just a better product without eh pay extra
S0251	yes occasionally it work in your favour but sometimes you don't get things that you be really hop for
S0252	yes i know best one we've have be two alaskan ah salmon ah fillet ah which be swap for erm four salmon scottish fillet
S0251	what be the work in our favour that time didn't it
S0252	it certainly do
S0251	mm
S0252	that's erm i i don't think that will happen too frequently
S0251	no no i don't think that be just a one off don't you because they'd run out of the packets of two
S0252	yes yes
S0251	we've still get some good offer haven't we
S0252	yes
S0251	we can still do eh all the special offer that be available the two for ones and that sort of thing
S0252	yes
S0251	you can still view those
S0252	i think it enable you to look at offer better actually because i think when you're in the store with the shelve units be very high i imagine it's probably quite easy to miss offer out which obviously might be rather disappoint at time
S0251	yes mm yes
S0252	have say that though erm we have see things on the websites you know be in store to pick it up but eh they haven't change the label or erm the the offer doesn't seem to be applicable in that store so
S0251	yes yes so you might not be aware of it
S0252	in some ways you might actually miss out on the offer by not shop online
S0251	yes
S0252	but the only downside be you can't make use of say reduce items with short date
S0251	no no and another thing be if you have vouchers that you've print off online
S0252	yes
S0251	you can't use them on an online shop can you
S0252	no
S0251	at the moment
S0252	only in very rare case
S0251	but i think the technology be go to be improve isn't it to incorporate that i don't know how long that's likely to take
S0252	yes yes well i think one awkward aspect be the fact that we've get at least sort of four five different retailers do online deliveries that and have have have to work it mean you're go to have to try have some kind of system that overlap with that and
S0251	mm in common
S0252	i don't think that would work terribly well consider how erm competitive and volatile the erm supermarket industry be
S0251	yeah
S0252	but obviously it will be nice when that time come
S0251	yes yes
S0252	i must admit i don't think we get offer really frequently but when you do get them it be nice to use it
S0251	mm yeah yeah i think it be especially good as it get nearer christmas and the shop get really busy
S0252	yes
S0251	i think it's nice to go and look around and see what there be and then it give you a bite of an idea but i like the shop online now
S0252	yes
S0251	also you can try clothe on at home which be a bite more satisfactory
S0252	yes also you can erm try and match it with exist clothe as well
S0251	yes that's a good point
S0252	which obviously you can't take the whole wardrobe to the the shop
S0251	no to see whether it match what you've already get that's true
S0252	but erm i think there be increase number purchase online
S0251	yes yes it have
S0252	good selection of most type of clothe really
S0251	yes some things you couldn't like shoe for instance
S0252	i can get away with shoe
S0251	i wouldn't really like to buy shoe online because it's ah tricky to fit aren't they
S0252	they be i must admit they have generally be alright
S0251	mm
S0252	with
S0251	but you just stick to the same make don't you
S0252	i do
S0251	the same brand
S0252	preferably the same type of shoe but maybe just in a different colour
S0251	yes yes
S0252	i think that make it a bite easier
S0251	mm
S0252	but obviously if you're a bite more adventurous you're take a risk that you might have to send it back which can be a bite of a nuisance have to take it up and erm take it to the post office
S0251	yes yes yes that's right
S0252	and some case we've have it the parcel be lose and that turn into a bite of a tricky situation
S0251	it do indeed
