S0037	yeah
S0115	quite a lot of people you know um
S0037	get an email from tosh today
S0115	yeah
S0037	just the usual rubbish
S0115	he's always he's he's very talkative isn't he
S0037	say that he'd he be say that he'd be chat up some girl in a shop by tell her about my thesis i be like oh well i'm glad those eight those like ten years of study
S0115	that's funny cos he doesn't actually know anything about your thesis do he
S0037	well he know what it be on doesn't he and um he's something about he say something to her and she like he get talk to her and then she say that she be do like lancashire lancashire dialect stuff
S0115	where's that then in australia
S0037	in huddersfield
S0115	ah huddersfield
S0037	and um say she be do like yorkshire stuff
S0115	australia
S0037	and then he say ah me friend do a phd on whatever and um and he and i so i reply and say like ah it's good to know that my like ten years in my eight years at university didn't go away didn't go to waste then for that two minute conversation but uh
S0115	no well
S0037	but uh but then i be tell him about then he say something about be you up to much and i say ah um not very much and then i be tell him about about and about um say to her like you haven't get a real job
S0115	oh right
S0037	and he be like have you tell this tell him like in capital letter i be like i think he can see both side though and then i tell him the story about go d'you want the money or be it alright like when i go to the bar
S0115	i don't know there's some funny we just don't seem to be able to find people who haven't get like certain certain you know idiosyncrasies and and stuff
S0037	well everyone have that's why like
S0115	yeah
S0037	if i have friends who be normal then they would be bore wouldn't they nobody you know
S0115	i mean no one be normal that's that's my point you see who's normal i mean like
S0037	no i know i know what you mean but like if they be really like
S0115	try to think you know like who's the most normal i suppose maybe there's some people who be more normal than others
S0037	it depend what you mean by normal like do you mean like sort of calm and like rational or do you mean like stereotypical or do you mean
S0115	um that's quite like it's one of them sort of discussions where you're talk about something but you're you know because of the the sort semantics you could be talk about absolutely anything you just don't know what it be you're talk about cos like
S0037	cos i've get friends who be rational and sort of sensible
S0115	i guess yeah certainly like part of it you'd have to have like you couldn't be um couldn't be stupid
S0037	yeah
S0115	but um they couldn't be i suppose it's it's what you're what you're not isn't it partly uh it's like they they wouldn't wanna be like what you might say i dunno eccentric or something that would be by definition not normal um
S0037	yeah
S0115	but then that's very broad as well um they they couldn't be like like for example criminals i i'd imagine um
S0037	yeah i don't think any of my friends be criminals
S0115	to to be normal um you say like something typical about be you know in a family perhaps
S0037	mhm
S0115	um the old two point four children or so if you're if you're at some stage of be in a family then that help to make you more normal
S0037	no i don't think so i don't think so lot of families that be very not normal none of my family be very normal
S0115	no i mean just the fact that you're in a family make you more normal maybe
S0037	think so
S0115	normal
S0037	i don't know if i agree
S0115	might do
S0037	cos everyone's in a family everyone's get a family
S0115	i guess there's more there's more like more than one type of normal that you be in like
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	stereotype you know sort of standard standard type of people you know like a normal uh um banker or a normal banker or a normal
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh uh
S0037	student yeah
S0115	scientist or something normal uh then you could have a normal criminal i suppose couldn't you like a people
S0037	ooh i find this website today
S0115	be it like i think there's nothing much that you can say really about about
S0037	oh that's true yeah oh hang on nobody be normal i find this website today call pinterest have you be on it
S0115	no never hear of it
S0037	it's really good like you'll probably not like it it but it's it's where like you can put like have picture of things that you like
S0115	right
S0037	and you create your own little pin board but you can also look at other people's and so on the front page they show like load of different photos
S0115	right
S0037	and like of all different things like so people might've do their hair nice and then take a photo of it or it might be of a
S0115	shall i go on the pin board then
S0037	and you can like you can put things on your own pin board and and you can find people
S0115	so it's basically it's kinda like a like a blog almost
S0037	yeah but it's just picture or you can find things that other people have put on their pin board and put it on yours
S0115	i see and then
S0037	and like you can use it to like if you be create you know do you ever do it design like at school where you be create mood board and stuff
S0115	uh yeah i think i've use uh whether you can use it like a wiki you mean work with other people
S0037	so if you be like look for inspiration for well it's more like sorry it's more like a place where you can group like um picture together and stuff
S0115	yeah i see so you don't use it like wiki pin board or something
S0037	so if you be have a thing no you can i think you can
S0115	yeah yeah yeah
S0037	um but people can comment on all like think you pin and you can comment on other things some other people have pin and stuff and
S0115	yeah
S0037	you can pinch theirs and pin it on yours as well you could have theme ones like there be some people there who be like redecorate some things they be like look for inspiration
S0115	yeah
S0037	like if you're redecorate your live room you might wanna like put theme you know picture that you like and get ideas of colour and like also of like things to put in it like lamps and stuff there's also a lot of like food things on there really nice food people have make
S0115	yeah
S0037	lot of like hair things lot of really good clothe and all different picture from everywhere so
S0115	so it's like my my picture
S0037	it's kind of yeah but it's it look really nice and snazzy
S0115	oh right
S0037	it's uh you should have a look i mean for me literally every single thing i be like ooh look at that ooh look at that ooh look at that like time a hundred but i maybe it's more of a girls' thing
S0115	so it could could have like a purpose as be you could find someone else's idea and copy that basically
S0037	i think so but like you can also add your own things and like if you be collaborate on like a project or something like have you see it on that that blackberry advert though when it's like what about this and then he take a picture of like a some colour and then the other one go be this what you mean and take another picture
S0115	oh yeah i think so yeah um
S0037	i think that you can do things like that on there
S0115	so you you sort of put note on yeah
S0037	yeah you put note under the things
S0115	um yeah it seem it seem good although yeah haven't some
S0037	it can also link it to something else like if you take a picture of like a
S0115	we we do we not already have this sort of before but not maybe with the ability to put them all on next to each other or something
S0037	oh right yeah of course you can save a folder of photos but it's you can sort of display them nicely and like
S0115	yeah yeah yeah
S0037	i haven't explore it fully but it look good but i think it might be more of a girl thing it be like shoe and cake and um interiors and um food and oh i've say that and like holiday and
S0115	yeah i mean i dunno what would be a male version of that
S0037	baby hedgehogs and stuff no i think there be like men's stuff on there i think men be interest in like that sort of thing but maybe the bits i look at sorry i've get a bite of a cough hope i'm not get that like liz's horrible ming
S0115	you could go to a specialist site and like if you've see a good hedgehog or make a good cake then you could go to a specialist hedgehog or cake site that you can you can sort of compete and put your own cake and your own hedgehog yeah
S0037	yeah yeah of course but i think you can like i think you can tag things so that you can search for other hedgehogs say
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	so like you can search on their site for hairdos or
S0115	i see
S0037	you know um wed dress or
S0115	i can kind of see it although i think probably myself i would go to a specific hedgehog site so you know like we've get hedgehogs dot com
S0037	oh no i know i know but i think as well one of the good thing yeah find me a hedgehog but i think one of the good things be like that you get inspiration like if you just wanna see different things it's like a blast of new things like if you once you open the page there might be like a cocktail on like a um i don't know like a car and then like some a somebody's garden
S0115	yeah it have a it's like a magazine yeah yeah
S0037	you know just all different things like suppose it just give uh give you ideas and like sometimes like when i'm at work and i've get a few spare minutes and i wanna do a bite of web surf like sometimes i'm like okay what should i do like what should i go to
S0115	yeah yeah okay yeah
S0037	i struggle with like things to do like to read and i know there's wikipedia i know you like it but
S0115	yeah you need suggestions yeah like you mean what people be do well that's something i be think about wikipedia be that it be a bite more sort of um uh well it it's very broad but it tend not to write like methods
S0037	yeah
S0115	like if you be look on cook you know it would it would tend not to really have a proper recipe for something if you be look on
S0037	yeah
S0115	to be honest if you be look on anything
S0037	yeah
S0115	ultimately in any profession or any field of science
S0037	yeah
S0115	you're ultimately gonna get to the point where you would be want to do something
S0037	yeah find out how to do it well this one be good pinterest be good i look at
S0115	like so wouldn't it doesn't really there's a site call wikihow that that do have something but
S0037	yeah well pinterest be because i it be like there be ones where it show you how to like put your hair up nice
S0115	yeah
S0037	and they'd like they have one picture on the front but then when you click it it have like ten different picture and show you all the different step
S0115	yeah right yeah i see
S0037	you know so like
S0115	yeah
S0037	but obviously like if you go to the create wikipedia page on like updos or whatever i don't even know if there be a page for updos if that's just what i call them but you know hair hairdressing or something
S0115	perhaps wikipedia be not very well represent in like
S0037	hairdos
S0115	like cosmetics as well like there wasn't a page for um
S0037	soap and glory
S0115	soap and glory that i know about for example
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh so but but you don't you use wikipedia for for find methods you use it for um
S0037	yeah
S0115	just general like broad sort of knowledge but it be it be really good in its breadth but
S0037	yeah
S0115	but but yeah i suppose it's more like scientific maybe like you could find uh you could find most chemicals i imagine almost like
S0037	but i bet there's a side to that i mean i've only really like i only really find pinterest today so i be just like have a little look but yeah
S0115	should uh should d'you reckon i should have another or d'you wanna
S0037	if you'd like one yeah
S0115	balance it out or
S0037	have you get any cash or d'you wanna borrow some i think i've get some i go to the cashpoint and risk me life in that traffic jam
S0115	i might actually um uh yeah i think i think i have actually how much be a pint
S0037	have you i've i dunno that those be six six eighty so
S0115	three forty i reckon i've get three forty
S0037	yeah well there's a pound just in you can give us it
S0115	hold on uh yeah i think i'm okay actually
S0037	sure well take that just in case
S0115	okay

S0115	uh no thank
S0115	cheer
S0037	must've be my drink that be really expensive
S0115	yeah we've just uh find uh
S0037	typical it's normally the other way around though that's normally really expensive
S0115	well i mean it it it can both be like cider can cider can get you sometimes like if you go in um like to the wetherspoon's and and ask and get strongbow it'd probably be a bite more than like than like if you go for a an abbot and
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh like they don't really have a a a cider as cheap as an as an abbot
S0037	yeah
S0115	um unless you wanna go into the the sort of dangerous ciders like sort of cloudy if you wanna go cloudy
S0037	them be horrible
S0115	some of the perries i think you could probably get from a

S0037	can't remember his name it be really good though well i be like it take like ten minutes to go through the whole thing you have to like press stuff and do things i have one of them these days at work today like when you you know when like i've get obviously get things to do i've always get like things to do but like i just couldn't get settle into anything
S0115	oh right yeah just not not can't think positively or
S0037	like some days i get to work and i'm like do this do this do this
S0115	yeah
S0037	and like it's and i just like knock things out and get things do really fast and type really load of email and do all my work and do my research and everything and then other days like today when i just get to work and i spend the whole morning do something that would normally take us about an hour like just wasn't in the right mood and like
S0115	yeah
S0037	like i be read somewhere that in like um in norway like okay you get your annual holiday allowance and stuff but you get three days like three duvet days when you can just ring up and say d'you know what i just i just don't wanna come to work today
S0115	three duvet days
S0037	so you can use them as holiday if you want but apparently people use them for those days when they feel like unproductive
S0115	okay but you don't always know though before you've go in do you
S0037	no but you can ring on the morning no you don't always know
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	yeah but you could go home at lunchtime and use half of your duvet day d'you know what i mean
S0115	um yeah yeah i do yeah yeah
S0037	you could like be like i haven't do anything any more today i can't do this afternoon i'm just gonna home like
S0115	guess it you can learn a lot by
S0037	obviously you can't have duvet days if you're like a nurse but like
S0037	like a brain surgeon but you've just get like an office job
S0115	you can learn a lot by by read read about um the practice of other countries like
S0037	yeah but i just like that idea like
S0115	uh the scandinavian ones be pretty
S0037	but i just like that idea like cos you know some days when you wake up and you just don't feel like it and you drag your bone there and you put yourself through it and you go through the motion but you're not really feel like it and just like one you know a day off would just rejuvenate you
S0115	that's that be it i mean i mean you get bad days when although you may not always know that it's gonna be one but
S0037	no
S0115	you get a bad and things that it you get in a negative frame of mind and things seem to things seem to go wrong like
S0037	yeah that's bad it wasn't really that today it be more like i just couldn't get like there wasn't anything be really like really interest us to do
S0115	it be more like a bore day
S0037	like everything be okay but i just you know when you go around do like little tiny bits of one thing and then a little tiny bite of another thing so you don't achieve anything
S0115	yeah well um you should have things like in place that you can do when when you feel like that you should have like little little side side plan and stuff that you can do
S0037	i have get some side project i know i sort of have but even those weren't take me fancy nothing be i clean the keyboard for a while
S0115	do you take the key off
S0037	no but i get one of those special wipe
S0115	that's oh yeah yeah a sprayer
S0037	no it be a wipe
S0115	yeah
S0037	i empty the crumb off it though
S0115	fair enough yeah you just you sort of shake it
S0037	yeah tip it out yeah
S0115	yeah i mine's uh my laptop's pretty you know
S0037	clean all the ming under my cos i've get a wooden desk and i don't have like a mouse mat
S0115	you don't have a mouse mat
S0037	uh i don't really like them
S0115	oh you don't mouse how can you not like mouse mat
S0037	i dunno it's crazy but uh so consequently my mouse pick up all of my like cake crumb and bits of eraser and yeah
S0115	oh yeah they they you have to clean them don't you have to open them and uh get the ball out and like pull all the dust out
S0037	well i just it be just collect underneath so i just
S0115	yeah
S0037	get rid of all that
S0115	be it uh quarter to seven already
S0037	i know
S0115	think it be earlier cos it's quite late actually
S0037	it be quite late i know the shop close in like an hour yeah
S0115	at eight eight or maybe nine no eight
S0037	no eight i think
S0115	yeah yeah might be nice and quiet
S0037	be it eight or just some yeah
S0115	think it's eight yeah
S0037	yeah it be probably better off come for a drink first because like sometimes it just get totally ram
S0115	oh yeah yeah i mean hopefully they've uh they'll have have a chance to restock some stuff cos
S0037	yeah
S0115	sometimes you if you go late you get um
S0037	yeah
S0115	totally empty but probably wouldn't happen probably wouldn't happen today though thursday
S0037	no
S0115	uh um
S0037	i think there's
S0115	yeah it be nice and you get the whole place to yourself you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	at this time you sort go round and uh
S0037	i use to like go shop like cos you know only recently isn't it i mean i don't mean like very recently but within the past five years that like shop have start open all through the night big supermarkets
S0115	have they
S0037	certainly in sunderland like i remember about five years ago
S0115	well i think it's a good idea
S0037	like shop be open at all like there's a few in sunderland like a big asda that's open all night and sometimes like um
S0115	actually there be in lancaster wasn't there
S0037	be there
S0115	yeah i think so yeah the asda in lancaster i think it be
S0037	ah yeah it be yeah
S0115	and we drive there at like ten or something once
S0037	yeah cos i remember go shop with in sunderland once at like half ten and it be so nice there wasn't like any kid in there no like not even really very many staff
S0115	yeah i mean
S0037	it be so peaceful
S0115	supermarkets that be crowd really really be quite annoy in fact well everything be annoy when it's crowd like i think i usually prefer like peace you know
S0037	oh it's horrible i know sometimes when i go to aldi like i just feel like there's just a person just in the way like i'm just try to get like something off the shelf and there's just a person there
S0115	yeah i mean i think sometimes you you you do sort of get a bite frustrate in in smaller shop when when they're full and you're like
S0037	oh i hate it
S0115	you can't sort of browse or you feel like you can't browse but but i know i like browse so um but sometimes you go sometimes i go there and i think just gotta get through it really fast like
S0037	get right on me nerve yeah
S0115	um it's gonna and then when when you head in and try to grab everything really fast then then you think that someone's in the way and someone's deliberately try to stop you from uh you know get to the get to the pastrami or whatever it be
S0037	stop you yeah yeah sprout yeah
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's um about couple of years since we've be in here
S0037	i know yeah have it change
S0115	i dunno i i don't think i remember us go to the orange part of it
S0037	be it still open oh yeah
S0115	and sit there we go for like a long walk or something through load of park and nearly get lose
S0037	oh that's right
S0115	then we sort of turn up here
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	and go you know
S0037	we come out like the um what's it call the recreation grind there and then come in here
S0115	yeah we we we totally surprise ourselves with like take a short cut
S0037	that's right
S0115	and and at the end of the short cut we be like this be right next to our house i mean
S0037	i'd like it if it be more ranch like if it have more of a texan theme
S0115	well part of it be orange um
S0037	and there's some picture of horse on the wall
S0115	there's the orangeness sort of up
S0037	i'd like it if the barmen wear like cowboy hat and there be like straw on the floor
S0115	uh
S0037	d'you not think d'you not think
S0115	yeah i mean um
S0037	bite like a proper ranch
S0115	yeah um well
S0037	with like lasso and like ironmonger and
S0115	dunno do do they have ironmongers in in ranch
S0037	i don't know i be just think about like horseshoe and stuff i think it would be good
S0115	yeah well actually i saw a thing on uh you know the one of the things on with uh like one of those program where someone like um um what's his name uh go um
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	around the world
S0037	travel
S0115	the one when he go round the world drink in different place and uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh when he go in australia there be the one of like a big massive like
S0037	like a cattle ranch
S0115	yeah it be just a big pub and it have like mass of uh table and that you could just bring like there be like horse and
S0037	yeah
S0115	cattle go around inside the pub and stuff
S0037	really oh that sound good like calamity jane
S0115	uh i guess a bite like that perhaps more more like a almost like a sort of a hangar or a warehouse or something
S0037	aha i see
S0115	and more like sort of a bite very open so it be out and
S0037	yeah
S0115	but um if it be in that out in the middle of nowhere then i don't know how people get back home after uh after they'd be drink there perhaps they take the horse and the cattle cow
S0037	dunno probably take the horse yeah like home boy you know just
S0115	i guess you can ride a ride a cow
S0037	i dunno well i don't suppose they go very fast do they
S0115	no well or indeed anywhere uh
S0037	i don't think cow do horse probably do a horse could take you home
S0115	yeah um and there's no penalty for drunken horse rid i believe
S0037	no don't suppose there be
S0115	uh i'm just guess i i don't actually know
S0037	might maybe there be probably like a bylaw somewhere you know like those stupid ones like if you're a citizen of york you can still whip your wife within the confine of the city wall and all that
S0115	oh be that a real one
S0037	and shoot her
S0115	no no i'm i'm not sure i i don't
S0037	no you can you have to take them down there's a stupid place i think it's like whipma whoppagate in in some stupid name in york and you can take your wife there and beat her if you want to as a bylaw and there's also that like if you're if you're bear within the city wall of york you can like fire a bow and arrow at a scotsman if you want to
S0115	what anywhere or just
S0037	within the city yeah
S0115	within the city no i didn't know about those those sound uh
S0037	yeah i only know those cos i read something
S0115	but um perhaps have be overwrite by like
S0037	yeah perhaps like don't yeah
S0115	cos i guess our law be be base on precedents isn't it rather than it's not it's not explicitly write down be it or i mean
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	part of it be not be not write down as laws but merely as precedents
S0037	i don't really know
S0115	as common law i mean like i've not certain
