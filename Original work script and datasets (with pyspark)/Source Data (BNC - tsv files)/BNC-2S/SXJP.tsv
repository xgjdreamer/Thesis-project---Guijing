S0439	so
S0441	yeah
S0439	so
S0441	well
S0439	they could repossess the house and
S0441	yeah i mean it's fourteen days after the fourteenth of december so it wouldn't be like we have to get out on the fourteenth so i mean
S0439	no no but i'd
S0441	it would all we'd still stay at the same sort of to move out but
S0439	yeah ring her tomorrow maybe maybe they'll be like fuck
S0441	yeah
S0439	mm
S0441	i'd imagine so but then she's get a copy of it as well and she must have like you don't just get that she must have not be pay her mortgage for a while
S0439	it would be so cool if like oh yeah shit don't pay your rent next month they wouldn't say that obviously we'd still have to pay but yeah mm how scandalous
S0441	just stupid and it's like it's just that these seek independent assistance regard this matter advice can also be obtain from and it's shelter or whatever like it's like great
S0439	that's that's really bad like
S0441	yeah
S0439	to not pay why would you what's the point of rent out your house
S0441	then to yeah to then not to pay the mortgage
S0439	to then not pay your mortgage like
S0441	that's really sort of it's
S0439	that's really stupid
S0441	really stupid isn't it
S0439	it doesn't even make any logical sense it's not like you you you even need the money like
S0441	no
S0439	the money from the rent of the house should pretty much
S0441	that's it
S0439	go to pay off the mortgage
S0441	mortgage yeah
S0439	that's the point of rent out your house
S0441	unless she's i don't know unless she can't afford her mortgage in
S0439	maybe well bad for her
S0441	very bad for her i think we have our suspicions just the the way the house be really
S0439	yeah
S0441	i mean if she be that much of a dedicate landlady she would have
S0439	do more to look after it actually
S0441	spruce it up a bite yeah
S0439	yeah
S0441	i dunno
S0439	oh no
S0441	i'll ring them tomorrow and see what they say
S0439	yeah just ring and be like erm hello what do this mean
S0441	just to let you know that the house might be repossess
S0439	but the thing be though she must be pay the estate agents
S0441	yeah i don't know how that work though and that's really really sneaky because of well i i do a bite of read up on the internet after tell me but apparently some tenant that can't pay their mortgage if you've get tenant in you have a two month grace period
S0439	yeah
S0441	so i guess some apparently some landlady or landlords say that they erm get new tenant in know that they might get their house repossess so they can have that extra two months
S0439	oh sneaky
S0441	so they can like i dunno
S0439	how very peculiar
S0441	very peculiar
S0439	oh no oh well
S0441	mean that can you imagine if we be gonna like carry on stay here
S0439	i know
S0441	be like oh my god
S0439	how be your weekend what happen to the the carpet

S0439	and you go into
S0441	yeah it be really fun
S0439	where do you go in
S0441	just the the be really good like i could literally stay in there for hours and not get bore
S0439	it's good but in a dingy way it's pretty dingy
S0441	oh yeah but jesus i'm not go anywhere other than there cos it's so frigging expensive everywhere else
S0439	yeah yeah i know
S0441	so i be i really like i think it be really good
S0439	where do they stay so over here
S0441	yeah they stay here two in my bed and we all stay on the floor
S0439	mm but er if you'd ask i could have erm you could have use my bed oh well
S0441	oh no it's fine honestly actually not too bad sleep on the floor down here
S0439	mm
S0441	cos we've cos this cos there be only like five of us anyway
S0439	yeah
S0441	so three down here and two in my bed that's not actually that uncomfortable how be your
S0439	oh it be really good it be er put that over there it be really good erm very relax very chill everything go accord to plan i think have problems with her boyfriend all weekend hence last night
S0441	oh god
S0439	they they're the one that i really don't think she'd ever really be together
S0441	the ones that never have sex
S0439	mm well apparently they have they do have sex now but apparently as far as like they've be together for they like as in like officially boyfriend and girlfriend since january he hasn't say that he love her
S0441	mm
S0439	and don't get me wrong i don't think there be like an expiry date on when you should tell someone that you love them but after after eleven months you've get to kind of be a bite like
S0441	maybe
S0439	yeah and like he's not head over heel in love with her and she keep be like
S0441	what's he play at
S0439	yeah she's be like well why isn't he head over heel in love with me i'm like
S0439	maybe you're just no but as horrible as it sound maybe she's just not like the one like i don't believe in the one that concept but you know maybe she's just not
S0441	they're just not compatible
S0439	yeah i just it sound horrible i just don't think he find her attractive
S0441	be she head over heel heel in love with him
S0439	yeah
S0441	oh no
S0439	erm yeah and so they be argue all weekend about he's just like everything i do for you you don't care about you know like erm i cook you dinner and you think that and you criticise me because i don't tell you that i care you know action speak louder than word and i'm show you that i care but i'm like but it's not like for girls you need that verbal affirmation as well it's just a thing like i do think action be important don't get me wrong but i think all girls also do need that verbal confirmation it's just
S0441	i dunno will never tell me he love me i mean he have tell me he love me but he rarely ever tell me
S0439	but do he tell you things like he think you're pretty
S0441	no
S0439	really
S0441	not really
S0439	mm i dunno maybe it depend on the person like for me it doesn't bother me too much but i think for it's important cos she have low self esteem
S0441	and that to be fair if if she think it's important and he know that then he should make the effort
S0439	yeah like she have low self esteem she have this disability you know she already think that she's not a super well he isn't a supermodel you know none of them be be they erm
S0441	i'm sure if i tell like i really need you to tell me that you i don't know then he probably would if it mean that much to me you know but
S0439	erm
S0441	i guess
S0441	that's perhaps why he's not really very
S0439	so they spend the whole weekend argue about that really him be like you never appreciate what i do you know i cook you dinner last week and you don't care blah blah blah and she's like i do care you know it's really important to me and sometimes i just need you to tell me that you actually like me you know and that would reassure me and
S0441	mm
S0439	and it er and go i mean it er it just go round in circle to be honest it be but because she know my opinion on it she doesn't ask
S0441	no
S0439	and i don't offer it's a really nice easy relationship you know
S0441	yeah
S0439	she know what i think she know that i don't particularly like him and he's the one on her birthday who get angry because i have say that he be shy and i didn't want him to be shy cos he be meet like all her friends for the first time and be like you know i hear you're a bite er shy but don't worry and he get really angry at her
S0441	yeah i know i remember you say that
S0439	erm so like i kind of think he's a bite of a twat anyway but so she know what i think of him so it would be it it be fine like she didn't erm you know she didn't get angry
S0441	it didn't bother her too much
S0439	no
S0441	that's good
S0439	cos through the weekend it didn't bother but then we get on the flight and she start to cry
S0441	ah
S0439	and then the moment we get back to the airport and obviously you get wifi and stuff her phone go off and it be him be like you know you're a bitch you know you don't appreciate me you know you just want me to say this but i'm not gonna say it until i'm ready and he isn't he's never gonna say it cos he's he just he just doesn't love her and it's really sad but she keep like hop that one day he will and and she start cry at the airport and i be like i've really get to get my bus so i kind of walk i be like i'm really sorry she be like no no go so i go down and i be like you know what i'll just cos her bus be another hour to go she have to wait an hour at the airport for her bus and i be like i'll just drive into oxford so i drive her all the way to oxford yeah i know
S0441	jesus
S0439	i drive from gatwick to oxford and then come back here
S0441	jesus
S0439	yes yes it be jesus
S0441	jesus be not really help you
S0439	i yeah so tire like cos she be really sweet she be like i'll give you petrol i'm like it's fine but she give me she give me thirty pound she give me for like the park and for petrol and stuff which be really nice of her she she didn't have to do that
S0441	yeah
S0439	and we listen to music on the way home so but she just she just have that hope that they're gonna work and it's just like
S0441	mm give up the ghost now
S0439	yeah just like stop it and she be like oh well he say i could have go over last night and i be like if you'd actually go over to his house last night i think i would have like actually get angry at you after everything he say
S0441	yeah
S0439	and you be like okay i'll come over i say all you would have do be sit there and argue with each other
S0441	yeah
S0439	you know it wouldn't have be a nice even you know like she just want it she just want it to work and i don't like that's not a bad thing i'm not say that want it to work be a bad thing but it's just it's not work you know
S0441	yeah
S0439	they hop that go from like best friends to a grey zone be suddenly gonna be like the best thing ever but it just
S0441	didn't work
S0439	yeah it just didn't turn out that way it wasn't they they weren't they're not compatible that's really sad but
S0441	it take quite a lot to realise that i think doesn't it
S0439	yeah because it's it's admit to yourself that you're not what someone want you know no one want that no one want to be like make you feel that they're not good enough but it's the it's not that she's not good enough for him she's just not the one who's gonna make him go head over heel you know
S0441	yeah
S0439	i don't think you know
S0441	it's get it's get nothing to do with her
S0439	yeah it's not to do with her she will one day find somebody who be madly in love with her and make her you know and say and like be the way she want him to be and
S0441	yeah
S0439	say the things she want him to say and you know like when she walk into a room he's like wow she's amaze but that isn't him it's just not
S0441	yeah
S0439	and the moment she realise that she'll be a lot happier i think but
S0441	unfortunately she's get to realise that on her own
S0439	yeah i mean she like like i say to her i be like you know my opinion i'm not gonna tell you my opinion but at the moment you want you know you want me to you want advice just let me know like

S0439	yeah
S0441	i doubt very much
S0439	no
S0441	erm
S0439	maybe just ask be like erm so what do we do in term of payment then or something like
S0441	cos she's she's not pay for her mortgage so
S0439	cos she's not pay for her mortgage
S0441	so we're not pay for
S0439	so like we don't like our lack er we're lack in trust you know
S0441	do your you know when you pay the rent do it go into an account
S0439	it go to the estate agent
S0441	do it do it go i be wonder whether it go straight into her
S0439	it's i put it into exactly the same account as what we put the deposit into
S0441	but could that not be her account
S0439	could be
S0441	cos that's why like you know when you wonder whether you why you don't get a receipt or anything
S0439	true maybe ask them tomorrow
S0441	mm who have we be pay
S0439	yeah maybe just like maybe it's like we we who be we actually pay
S0441	yeah
S0439	like we're feel slightly uncomfortable now where be the money that we're actually pay go
S0441	yeah what be we fund
S0439	her drug habit
S0441	probably
S0439	i no longer feel comfortable fund this
S0441	i'm not pay any more
S0439	i'm not pay any more
S0441	but we're stay here
S0439	but see what they say tomorrow just be like
S0441	let's just say yeah we don't feel comfortable pay the rent anymore well i mean obviously
S0439	yeah
S0441	in so many word
S0439	yeah
S0441	yeah
S0439	cos like you know obviously this be there's something go very wrong here financially erm
S0441	what be we pay for
S0439	what be we pay for like can you before we pay our next rent or something can you please speak to the landlord about this
S0441	yeah
S0439	cos obviously our next rent's due next week
S0441	or we could just say i'm try to think mm we could just say we're not will to pay any more rent i don't know how that work though cos we're contractually bind aren't we
S0439	no she's contractually bind to not get us kick out
S0441	true
S0439	i think maybe just play it like we're like we're uncomfortable
S0441	yeah
S0439	pay until we until we know this have be resolve
S0441	what's actually go on like
S0439	or what's actually happen yeah like we're uncomfortable with the situation and we'd rather have it sort out before we because the problem be they say that financially that money be go somewhere
S0441	that mean we're technically not pay for this house
S0439	yeah we're technically not pay for this house so maybe just swing it that way just be like we're uncomfortable pay continue to pay for this until we know where that money have actually go or whether it's so that there's a
S0439	financial whether the landlord's have a financial problem
S0441	it would make sense if it if it do go straight to her account because
S0439	yeah
S0441	why would they why would it direct itself back either i mean it would be like
S0439	yeah
S0441	pointless almost wouldn't it
S0439	yeah definitely it's a bite it's just weird i think yeah just sell it that way cos er maybe she you know she yeah we completely understand they should do like i'm sorry like i don't feel particularly comfortable pay seven hundred well nearly eight hundred pound into an account which i don't know where it's go know that this woman isn't pay her mortgage like
S0441	cos a mortgage be not eight hundred pound a month be it
S0439	no and just with like the er the threat of be kick out i'm sorry
S0441	no
S0439	it's not really good enough be it so maybe just sell it that way
S0441	i'm gonna ring as well tomorrow
S0439	the yeah like she should just we don't feel particularly comfortable erm pay continue to pay our rent until we understand like what's happen
S0441	yeah i'll i'll i'll i'll be the nice client i'll i'll say that i understand that it's nothing you know not not your problem it's not your fault but i'm really not happy about this
S0439	yeah really i'm really uncomfortable because and if you say it like you know this be like our money you know it's like
S0439	it's a lot of money a lot of money and we be we're concern that it's not go to the right place
S0441	yeah
S0441	we could be sell her her drug dealer you know
S0439	we could be fund that that poor you know woman's
S0441	a traffic woman
S0441	oh yeah
S0439	she could be like run a factory shop in russia
S0439	for all we
S0441	and we're just pay like towards it
S0439	there's children be use and abuse to make those nike shoe
S0441	let's just get really carry away
S0439	yeah
S0441	start cry
S0439	start be like you know we just we just hate where this be go
S0439	yeah so
S0441	okay
S0439	so like that along those line
S0441	i'll i'll try i'll try my best
S0439	see what she say yeah
S0441	er yeah
S0439	make you feel sorry for the couple move in though
S0441	oh god i know
S0439	cos that's really dodgy
S0441	that's horrible i would not even feel comfortable like even if she
S0439	oh
S0441	what
S0439	oh they'd better ensure our deposit
S0441	oh shit yeah
S0439	cos that money
S0441	what's
S0439	we don't even know where that's money's go if that money's go into a different account that we don't actually know and she hasn't and she's in debt
S0441	yeah
S0439	like that's eight hundred quid of our money that be in
S0441	i'm sure we pay more than that
S0439	yeah also what i think
S0441	it's not
S0439	maybe that's something worth mention as well actually
S0441	yeah
S0439	that's on a serious note that's our money
S0441	that's
S0439	sit in her
S0441	yeah
S0439	account
S0441	yes
S0439	and she's in debt
S0441	but you but the that would make me think though that that surely be back up somewhere it's just in case
S0439	that should be
S0441	of the circumstances because
S0439	it should be yeah
S0441	that's not that's not our fault be it
S0439	no no not at all but if she's in debt then
S0441	yeah
S0439	the government can claim anything they can take any of
S0441	yeah
S0439	her finance can't they so
S0441	exactly
S0439	you wanna make sure that's erm ensure
S0441	do we know how much deposit we pay i haven't even get my document here
S0439	we pay something like i pay something like twelve hundred didn't i
S0441	yeah
S0439	but i think two hundred and fifty of that be an admin bill wasn't it
S0441	oh yeah we have admi i think let me just have a look
S0439	yeah no on a serious note i suddenly just think about that i be like shit that's our deposit
S0441	no you're very right all very well have these stupid folders but i never remember what i've put it under
S0439	no
S0441	maybe it be contract
S0439	i mean how stupid would you have to be to not pay the mortgage like
S0441	i know unless you're in severe issue
S0439	yeah
S0441	oh it's on the erm internet isn't it it be an it be an e contract
S0439	yeah it be an e contract yeah
S0441	i'll find it on that
S0439	yeah
S0441	i've get sixteen hundred in my account for some reason that's that'll be eight hundred pound rent and
S0439	yeah it might have be
S0441	it be a month's rent and and a month's rent for deposit as well i'm sure
S0439	mm mm yeah maybe
S0441	but i wonder if i think it's only only eight hundred pound i think
S0439	yeah
S0441	yeah
S0439	the deposit but we have to pay more the upfront
S0441	the upfront yeah
S0439	yeah
S0441	so it would be eight hundred pound i'll say that
S0439	but that's maybe that's why she be but she be like rush to get people in it wasn't she
S0441	i know and that's what i'm say maybe she be rush people to get in it because she be default on her payments
S0439	mm
S0441	and need to have people in so that she have that i don't know maybe she need that time
S0439	mm either way i don't feel particularly comfortable about it
