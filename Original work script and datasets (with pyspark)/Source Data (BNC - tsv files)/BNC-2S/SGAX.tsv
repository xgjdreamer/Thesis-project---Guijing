S0037	yeah
S0115	um i remember that bite i only see the end of it
S0037	yeah
S0115	so the end of the interview and where they sort of walk off and it have an element of uh frost nixon about it cos of the interview cos it be uh an interview although really it be a debate actually
S0037	yeah
S0115	um
S0037	well suppose to be
S0115	it be it be back in the sort of the blasphemy
S0037	ah
S0115	they they priests be accuse um accuse monty python of blasphemy for uh make the life of brian
S0037	yeah
S0115	blasphemy mean insult god be that what it be or
S0037	yeah lord's name in vain
S0115	yeah um then there's another one which be uh be another thing call heresy isn't it which be that's the denial of the existence of god
S0037	not believe in god yeah
S0115	these guy have uh blasphemy which be a big you know you could you could get uh execute for that in the old days
S0037	thing back then yeah it's a lot more relax now
S0115	um
S0037	yeah not monty python time though
S0115	no not in the seventies no but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	well not in i mean perhaps in in in certain other countries they have uh you know
S0037	i dunno
S0115	very strongly religious uh governments
S0037	vatican city maybe
S0115	dunno but yeah um it's pretty weird if you think about well it's the sort of thing you see on horrible histories be be the be the fact that histories be horrible in in
S0037	mm
S0115	you know you'd get burn for like
S0037	yeah not agree
S0115	mind you i suppose like a lot of the time they just make stuff up like if they didn't like someone
S0037	yeah
S0115	they would make up you know trump up charge
S0037	tell them she's a witch yeah
S0115	you know the classic uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	trump up uh you know
S0037	yeah you just don't know
S0115	think they be sort of burn people be burn probably uh
S0037	but um
S0115	but if you wanna make money in these hard time televise public execution
S0037	ah that's a horrible idea
S0115	pay pay you know subscription subscription service
S0037	people would though wouldn't they
S0115	yep
S0037	voyeurism
S0115	well i i'm not in favour uh i'm not in favour of it but i think in as people get increasingly desperate for money perhaps that's something that'll happen
S0037	but i mean the television's go like that anyway like some of that stuff that
S0115	oh yeah well i think we think i don't know if this be just because i'm get old or
S0037	mm
S0115	which i be
S0037	yeah
S0115	or if it genuinely be get worse but but i do sometimes think you know that things be get more desperate for money and more sort of violent
S0037	ohh but do you see that thing in syria where so it be the the rebel have capture some guy who be from the government and string him to a tree
S0115	no i haven't no what what what have you what have you be read
S0037	maybe it be when i be abroad ah it's because i think it be when i be abroad because obviously i be just watch you know
S0115	yeah perhaps they wouldn't show that in england because in england we we're only give sort of very positive view of the rebel we're we're not give
S0037	foreign news and anyway the it be on aye it be on cnn and they be like
S0115	i don't i don't know if we'd be give any anything that negative about the rebel in england although i may be wrong
S0037	so it be on cnn and they be like um oh they be like oh you know they've capture this guy who's suppose to have i mean there be things that this guy's suppose to have do this army guy you know like kill a child and whatever but basically there be this footage on the news and before they put they say oh by the way this might be slightly upset and it be like this man string up from a tree and you could see his face it well nothing be blur out nothing so it be his dead body like sway sway in the breeze
S0115	oh dead body so they'd already kill him extrajudicially like
S0037	be he wasn't die at that moment but he would he have already die like but he be just
S0115	they'd already kill him
S0037	and he be just hang with his tree and they be all stand there with their weapons like pose next to him
S0115	oh right yeah
S0037	so
S0115	very similar to medieval uh
S0037	exactly
S0115	well not necessarily medieval
S0037	but what i'm say be that be on the news like
S0115	cnn but i dunno if it's well yeah i mean the gadaffi thing be on uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	the the shoot uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	pretty pretty brutal really uh i don't know if um do they use to show that sort of stuff i think things sort of get more censor i suppose like nowadays uh you know there's there's there be a tendency towards more um freedom of speech freedom of broadcast and that that kind of do lead i think to to the or a lower of the standards
S0037	yeah but that's a bite extreme i don't think you need to see people hang from tree and like when they kill
S0115	well it could get far worse and we only have to look back in into the horrible history to see just how horrible it could get again in this country
S0037	yeah but i don't wanna see it i don't wanna see
S0115	remember mussolini in italy i mean that be that may be they say he he deserve that but like that that that be like a
S0037	no i know but
S0115	he be like string up and his body be like pass around you know hang up decapitate and hang upside and stuff stuff like that
S0037	well i know oh they use to do all sort of things didn't they like draw them and stuff so when they be like they would hang them but not till they die and then take them down and pull pull the middle bits out and
S0115	oh well that's i mean that's that's supposedly illegal in the modern um supposedly uh uh illegal illegal to torture in the modern you know uh so call uh free western world or whatever it be supposedly illegal to supposedly illegal to torture although they they do do it anyway but they just don't admit it so i guess it's like
S0037	but i think
S0115	there's there's always history's horrible i suppose the present will be horrible uh like if you
S0037	but you get horrible stuff anyway
S0115	i think one of the big problems like violence look at that dive
S0037	i know it be proper dive wasn't it i be think that wasn't even a penalty no way
S0115	that's a real that uh
S0037	didn't he didn't give it though the referee so
S0115	yeah fair enough
S0037	doesn't matter
S0115	oh yeah so
S0037	it be the right decision
S0115	no i mean i think like violence be be a be a huge problem and uh
S0037	ooh that be
S0115	and it come from government it come from individual it come from you know mob just just come up and uh
S0037	yeah
S0037	i'm sorry i be just just a bite distract by his glass they seem really out of place
S0115	no i don't know i think he's he's most of his face be a bite out of place and
S0037	no but i think those kinda strong glass you've gotta be have a certain sort of face to be able to like
S0115	he look like k c jones from uh
S0037	who's k c jones
S0115	he's a business man that be on dragon's den he's from birmingham and he have really thick glass
S0037	be k c jones not a song by the um
S0115	i don't know well he call himself k c jones so
S0037	be k c jones oh yeah i remember with the boil egg timer
S0115	he have very he have thick he have no he didn't have the boil egg timer
S0037	oh
S0115	um that's a good trick of memory isn't it the way people mix like
S0037	yeah blend things
S0115	mix perhaps like a noun with a verb or whatever you might say
S0037	k c jones be he the one with the microwave that he could microwave his shoe in
S0115	yeah he be the guy with the uh um
S0115	it be funny that
S0037	i could do with one them let's be honest
S0115	he have these thick glass and and he and his eye be really
S0037	he be like you put them in a microwave
S0115	yeah that he really from birmingham and he he have thick thick rim thick glass that um
S0037	well all the best people be don't worry about it
S0115	uh
S0037	oh god them stairs in and out all the time
S0115	population's grow in like some place
S0037	ay what
S0115	birmingham
S0037	what
S0115	its population's grow in like some place
S0037	well yeah
S0115	uh
S0037	d'you not think his glass look really odd
S0115	not really um
S0037	i think he'd look better with some of them ones where you can't see the frame
S0037	god what they do
S0037	in and out all the time
S0115	yeah actually there be uh can be a bite of repeat uh
S0037	i don't understand
S0115	certain amount of repetition sometimes
S0037	on a saturday morning when i'm try to have a lie in they're like boof boof boof boof up the stairs
S0115	what be i say to you well i don't i think there's someone who who like to sort of
S0037	aye
S0115	redo things
S0037	have they get like load of stuff like they're just carry it up in shift
S0115	not sure um they they presumably
S0037	be that be they out there now
S0115	presumably
S0037	be they out there now have i say that really loud
S0115	uh no i think i think they leave
S0037	i dunno shh
S0115	they can't just be like hover there can they but that
S0037	be that too obvious oh well ah never mind
S0115	oh yeah so i be say um
S0037	stupid advert's get in me head
S0115	that that that there's that violence be just be just it's so easy to get a situation of violence you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	even in even in the richest country in the world or or even in the most supposedly peaceful country in the world
S0037	if someone
S0115	like norway or something
S0037	yeah
S0115	which i believe have the highest standard of live in europe in the world perhaps or in europe or something and norway have the highest uh per person wealth in europe i believe
S0037	oh right
S0115	and probably one of the the world
S0037	but
S0115	but but you know you get you get that shoot and in a country as peaceful as norway to get a shoot like that
S0037	ah but you get crackers people everywhere don't you
S0115	well it's the biggest attack in norway since you know the nazis
S0037	yeah but you can't predict that like it's just you get crazy people all over the world
S0115	no but i mean i guess that's part of my point that the violence violence seem to
S0037	but
S0115	can just have like it just happen like people don't seem to there doesn't seem to be a way a mechanism of of humans to stop violence like if they be as great a species as as they claim to be well we
S0037	yeah but i suppose my point that i be try to make be that i don't need to see it on tv if someone like that that american guy who like shoot all those villages right it's fine to tell me that an american guy go to a village and shoot them and then once they be dead he try to burn them i don't need to see the scorch mark on the grind or the body in the back of a van or a pool of blood like i don't think
S0115	well i be you complain about the coverage or the violence itself you seem to be complain about the coverage
S0037	well both both really
S0115	so you're happy with the violence but no as long as it's
S0037	no i've just say both haven't i i'm i'm complain about both but what i'm say be
S0115	be it cos i be talk about like the violence itself as
S0037	i don't see why you should perpetuate it on the tv i think it's like
S0115	oh yeah well if you're take the point that that that like that that can cause more violence yeah
S0037	well they say it don't they like they say if there's like a serial it glamorize it doesn't it like
S0115	it can it can yeah yeah like like we saw on um charlie brooker's programme
S0037	if you're a serial killer and like they put the splash your face around everywhere and make him into some sort of demigod for like other crazy folk
S0115	yeah indeed but then of course violence start otherwise without tv um violence start
S0037	that's quite a good advert
S0037	violence start everywhere i suppose
S0037	i like those cars that have get them big sunroofs like that
S0115	mm so i be think you know where where's where's the most violent place
S0037	me dad's get them
S0115	and i look and i find uh a lot of the violence be to do with um place where there's drug produce or
S0037	congo ah yeah
S0115	also gang and and in it involve in the transport of drug um so so large amount of money definitely particularly large amount of black market money
S0037	yeah
S0115	absolutely attract violence to it
S0037	like um like that programme we watch about that guy who be like he get do over and he be that in peru or chile
S0115	sorry i don't know what you mean
S0037	he be like an american guy and he fell in love with that girl and she be just use him
S0115	oh right that be like bang up abroad or something
S0037	bang up abroad one of my faves
S0115	well that's that's not a case of violence it's a case of stupidity and uh
S0037	it's pretty stupid
S0115	drug it but it be something that go on i mean uh what be he yeah he be from he he move to florida or something
S0037	hey look at
S0115	florida seem to be a real hotbed of of just just craziness i think but uh um
S0037	be you
S0115	but in the news obviously we we have the we've have the shoot in florida just now and we've also have see in the news you know like those two english guy that get drink and run into the wrong neighbourhood and get shoot just for be just for simply be in the neighbourhood
S0037	ah it's pretty bad it just make you scar doesn't it make me scar
S0115	so that's like yeah florida's like a bite of a a but of a i also read recently uh supposedly that some of the nine eleven hijackers be sort of party in florida before
S0037	be they
S0115	carry out the that's this be an allegation it may well anyway uh florida's a bite of a magnet for trouble i think um
S0037	well you can't say that just cos two things've happen and just cos that's you've hear about them
S0115	although i think three things yeah
S0037	just cos you've hear about them like
S0115	well i think it be because and uh this be what i'm on about be that the drug route you see
S0037	oh that look good doesn't it
S0115	the drug that
S0037	oh right
S0115	america consume an enormous amount of drug and those drug probably most of them be come from south america yeah so obviously so anywhere along the the south um so the gulf of mexico coast of america or the mexican
S0037	yeah
S0115	be be particularly i mean florida particularly because perhaps it's get such a big coastline lot of place where um potential sort of smuggle can go on i think um and and obviously it attract people from um i mean look at that guy you be talk about who get do over basically he be in florida and and this this beautiful
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	this beautiful girl you know uh meet him and and give him a story you know like like she's um she's
S0037	she's be
S0115	she's be uh leave or something
S0037	her husband have beat her up or something hadn't he or there be something
S0115	she she have to to
S0037	she need somewhere to go um
S0115	she desperately need um
S0037	escape from somewhere
S0115	something it be she initially basically basically the woman make the guy fall in love with her
S0037	yeah
S0115	then once he's fall in love he become the perfect uh transporter for drug
S0037	yeah well that's me next step of me plan
S0115	because in the word of the guy like in the word in the word of one of those
S0037	hey matt d'you wanna go to um peru i'm just play a long game
S0115	yeah well no i mean yeah you know you you uh you're um
S0037	i'm sorry i'm only joke
S0115	you're uh i wouldn't put it past you but uh
S0037	ee
S0115	i mean you can't trust anyone but uh
S0037	don't be silly
S0115	you know i think you can never trust anyone um
S0037	of course you can
S0115	it's uh
S0037	do you really think that
S0115	if you'd do if you'd um if you'd decide to to go out with me for six years um in order to carry something out
S0115	um i don't know i mean
S0037	don't be silly
S0115	how could you make the money back and you'd have to be but uh
S0037	i'll sell you into slavery or something
S0115	and sort of sell all my uh
S0037	organs yeah
S0115	organs yeah that's the only way to make the money back
S0037	do you see about the guy in the news who'd get that full on face transplant
S0115	um don't remember
S0037	it be almost like a full on head transplant he like his jaw
S0037	his jaw all like his upper and lower jaw all of his face part of his eye socket like i dunno like part of us be a be a bite unsympathetic cos i think he'd accidentally like shoot himself in the face it be a shoot accident
S0115	oh god
S0037	if you're stupid enough to shoot yourself in the face you don't deserve a face really
S0037	i hope that's the case i hope he we didn't just like injure
S0115	well he presumably he be be that on uh american uh
S0037	i think it be yeah
S0115	nhs but i guess i guess you can't really charge someone for like if you've get no face
S0037	well i think it be destroy his life like he couldn't go out the house and stuff because obviously didn't really have a
S0115	yeah i'm not not a big fan of shoot myself though i think get it
S0037	waay
S0115	no i mean that that be a that be a
S0037	no you gotta say shoot myself myself
S0115	that i that wasn't deliberate but uh um no i would would be a bite
S0037	there be a few of them funny little things
S0115	very cautious around a gun i certainly wouldn't be like throw it around
S0037	na
S0115	but if you've have a you've have a few beers
S0037	i suppose if you go
S0115	if you decide to go for a few beers take the take the gun
S0037	yeah but i suppose if you grow up with them like if it's normal then
S0115	it's uh
S0037	like
S0115	yeah but if you're drink you can still shoot yourself in the face
S0037	shoot yourself in the face be not it's like on those cartoon where it's like oh the bullet's stick i'll just see what's wrong
S0115	there's some bizarre oh like um elmer fudd or something look down the barrel look down the barrel to see if there's
S0037	you know like in elmer fudd yeah yeah yeah and then his moustache get all sing and that
S0115	because uh sometimes they would they would pull the trigger and there'd be a pause and uh they'd look and they'd go
S0037	oh that's right yeah or one of my favourite ones be when like it go off and then he have like a cylindrical hole in his head with like some some extra piece like
S0115	yeah cartoon physics uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	big big
S0037	like this like when they get bang on the head like
S0115	yeah
S0115	there's a few a few of those sort of gag like uh when they
S0037	or like um in tom and jerry
S0115	you know wile e coyote on the on the edge of the cliff
S0037	tom and jerry like often his skin come off or something
S0115	yeah i mean it's it's it's horribly violent isn't it but that's there be an episode of the simpsons that that supposedly uh deal with this it be um you know the itchy and scratchy
S0037	yeah
S0115	like the marge complain it's too violent and want it ban then they have a venus de milo
S0037	yeah
S0115	or be it no no michelangelo's david
S0037	yeah
S0115	um which be totally naked sculpture
S0037	yeah
S0115	come to america and someone say that if you're ban uh if you're in favour of ban the violence then you'll have to be in favour of ban nudity um
S0037	nudity
S0115	you know which they call uh freedom of expression or something form of expression but uh no i would say well the violence be be be worse than nudity surely
S0037	some of them tom and jerry ones be classic though i don't mean the violent ones
S0115	like you you can't equate you can't equate as i think that cartoon be try to do
S0037	yeah
S0115	you know freedom of expression nudity with with violence that that's stupid anyway that's that's
S0037	yeah i feel like um i be just gonna tell you about my favourite tom and jerry cartoon but then i just think to meself i've do a i've do a nana jean and i've come all the way back round to like the original thing i be talk about which be children's tv like i've just go on a like thirty five minute tangent
S0115	oh yeah well that's be like a theme though that's that's be a theme though that's be like cos you can always link back to history and once you've get history you can link back to horrible histories
S0037	but um

S0115	it be a good it be a good film though
S0037	be a good it be on the other night actually
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	but then i then i sort of watch it again like it just make us think like oh this be really cheesy
S0115	it's quite it's quite long isn't it
S0037	when it's like unobtainium you just think like
S0115	well yeah it be always i think it be quite antiwar so i think uh it's alright
S0037	liz be tell us she'd be to see that film hunger game have you hear about it it's one of those ones that's like for i don't know why exactly
S0115	no
S0037	i i think it might have one of them vampire blokes in what's that series call twilight cullen edward jam edward cullen oh i'm so i'm so rubbish

S0037	sort of spooky vampirey
S0115	kinda scary scary eye
S0037	well vampirey isn't he let's be honest um
S0115	like what you imagine a vampire the the romanian look
S0037	so i think it might've have him in but i'm not sure
S0115	guess dracula tradition it have a sort of a long nose a long thin straight nose

S0037	that be really good
S0115	against uh yeah that be from
S0037	do it not come off his hand though
S0115	it's cos it be a volley as well so that make it um
S0037	it be like aye oh right in the corner

S0037	oh the goalie couldn't even see that like it be like too many people in the way
S0115	wasn't happy but it be
S0037	i sometimes think some of these british commentators when it's a european match they're like yeah schalke be win yeah
S0115	just bore of it they're just yeah i mean they they're either bore or sort of overly bias they they're not really able to get excite about
S0037	no they're not it's kind of flat
S0115	get to get excite like uh
S0037	i feel like i should put the german commentary on
S0115	well like jeff stelling be always sort of excite about like
S0037	he doesn't sound like he's from germany do he ral gonzález
S0115	um
S0037	yeah

S0115	connelly
S0037	that peter brosnan
S0115	you're already a nana now like
S0037	i know
S0115	one that's you know one of those one of those ones that doesn't shut up
S0037	it's only gonna get worse that's not very nice
S0037	alright sorry for be
S0115	like um
S0115	no no no no uh
S0037	that's not very nice
S0115	that's better than you know like i say like someone who just ah it's nothing worse than uncomfortable silence like
S0037	yeah
S0115	like if you're sit with someone and you you happen to be like go out with them or like live with them and it's just like just like like just endless like pin drop silence
S0037	yeah uh i've never really have that as you say as you say i think i'm just
S0115	i guess you're not use to a family with uh i don't think there'd be ever more than a few second of quiet on your family
S0037	no there's not much quiet not with me brother me brother would just talk even if there's nobody there i i'm sure he just do
S0115	he's a he's a a tremendous talker uh
S0037	chat away
S0115	and i think i think and and be be the same like as well and you and your nana
S0037	oh me nana
S0115	be be really
S0037	i'm sure like when me granda be in hospital he must have just be like aahhh like cos she wasn't go arnie blah buh blah buh blah buh blah d'you want a fish finger or blah blah blah i buy these in morrisons meh meh muh muh meh she really do talk all the time
S0115	so yes so you're
S0037	i write something like that because
S0115	so you don't you don't identify with with women like like rachel from friends or
S0037	not really it's not very me
S0115	suppose not you you more uh like you know monica from friends or
S0037	um well no i i can't say i have any like anything like the clean ethic of monica
S0115	you're not that clean though you're not clean um or phoebe so there isn't someone like you in uh in friends be there
S0037	no i don't know i just don't like i suppose i don't like girls' i don't like the romance i just think it's cheesy like i suppose i just think
S0115	yeah but not but i think you do you can be quite sentimental some time
S0037	i think i'm sentimental and i do think i'm an old
S0115	do you if you see uh if you see like you know something something nice on tv like like that programme with uh those you know they get a little kid and he's suffer a personal tragedy
S0037	yeah
S0115	they build him a big house to make up for it you get really get really uh
S0037	ahh they're a bite silly though they're a bite over the top but no i know what you mean i yes i be sentimental i agree um and it doesn't take much to like set us off cry and that
S0115	yeah
S0037	but that's something quite different to like kind of bridget jonesy sort of
S0037	and those sort of stupid marley and me or like um
S0115	things with hugh grant in
S0037	clueless just like um
S0115	d'you like um four weddings and a funeral which i think be the most successful british film um
S0037	i don't mind hugh grant but uh what about love actually be that not more successful
S0115	no i think it's between the the biggest british film be uh
S0037	i i don't mind i only just saw four weddings and a funeral
S0115	be it one of the recent ones
S0037	no it's not titanic that be an american one
S0115	titanic's not a british film
S0037	i know the jam one of the jam bond maybe
S0115	um no i don't think so
S0037	ah slumdog that be a british film
S0115	possibly
S0037	wasn't it

S0115	no because it'll mention cos because that's one quite a big aspect of like it's quite
S0037	really i don't think it be
S0115	i think it be d'you d'you want me to have a look

S0037	because i wanna type cos i'll just be sit here do nothing if you be do it
S0115	yeah but we
S0037	right
S0115	you really be uh insane hold that thing
S0037	economy of great britain what be i look for film well it's my thing
S0115	we're look for the top list of britain's highest
S0037	i know we be
S0115	highest gross british film do that not bring that on google

S0037	no it just say creative industries account for seven percent and grow an average of six percent per annum key areas include london and manchester that's all it say
S0115	well that's that's quite a high percentage overall isn't it um um
S0037	um this be stupid
S0115	go go to harry potter and we'll do it the other way round we'll go go to harry potter and then try to uh
S0037	harry potter but be it make by a british company
S0115	well we'll find out
S0037	i could just look up the hundred best
S0115	uh well that's not quite that wasn't what we be after
S0037	um
S0115	well i i could have a go on the other computer maybe
S0037	no it's alright harry potter
S0115	have have you not google like british make movies make in britain or film make in britain or something
S0037	alright i'll try that
S0115	or um well british film company and then you can work out
S0037	british film british what d'you want us to type british what
S0115	british film company
S0037	that won't give us any indication of like will it that won't give us any indication of biggest british film
S0115	i think they would just call them british film don't they i'm surprise it's it's that hard actually i i
S0037	biggest
S0115	cos normally there'd
S0037	well i'm not lie honestly
S0115	alright that wasn't uh an an i wasn't suggest that you be lie
S0037	biggest box office biggest box office flop of all time they're all like weekend box office figure
S0115	um why've you you've go for you've go for british um but be it be it uh
S0037	i'll close that now harry potter right what do you wanna find from harry potter
S0115	uh just like what company make it
S0037	um oh this be the book there film series
S0037	have you read them all the harry potter ones
S0115	oh i don't like it
S0037	the film okay harry potter
S0115	um
S0037	warner brothers
S0115	oh right well that's the studio that distribute it but i dunno about like
S0037	produce by david hayman distribute by warner brothers
S0115	the company that they're the distributors but i don't know if they
S0037	harry potter be a british american film series
S0115	yeah i mean british like i think that's part of the problem um that it do tend to be a collaborate but uh like if you go for um go go to full monty then maybe look at who make that and then maybe you can work out if that be truly british or
S0115	like
S0037	list of highest gross film i might get it from there what d'you think's the highest gross film of all time
S0115	um like
S0037	use to be titanic didn't it
S0115	lord of the
S0037	avatar
S0115	lord of the ring and or or um
S0037	avatar maybe
S0115	uh harry potter or star war the um yeah like a
S0037	highest gross film
S0115	it be it be titanic wasn't it
S0037	avatar i be right
S0115	oh avatar
S0037	well it's difficult because of the adjustment like the highest gross film in the fifties and the highest gross film now titanic star war jaw and et oh no harry potter titanic
S0115	be that just in their own be that exclude um
S0037	no that be just i be read them out so it go avatar titanic harry potter two transformers
S0115	that be a great goal actually the way they they sort of build up
S0037	aww
S0115	some very good pass there i suppose they sort of be a little bite scrappy at the end but but they way they the guy pass it right across but there be load of space you see
S0037	yeah they're not defend
S0115	um can i have a go ah
S0037	it wasn't a very nice it wasn't a very excite goal though
S0115	so it it would have be it would have be harry potter wouldn't it if if that if that count
S0037	but that it's a british american film
S0115	i think they all be collaborative like and there's another harry potter another harry potter harry potter yeah it's i think it would have be all harry potter at the top like before
S0037	i want to say harry potter in my dick van dyke voice
S0115	harry
S0037	harry potter
S0115	bodder
S0037	hairy bodder look harry i've draw this chalk draw
S0115	ah but he actually would fit in into that
S0037	i know
S0115	he'd fit into that film
S0037	i could imagine him be like an old wizard
S0115	i think this film's gross like the gdp of you know
S0037	ireland
S0115	italy or something uh avatar gross if this be correct
S0037	whoa d'you think schalke can come back from this
S0115	uh two point seven million billion in fact two point seven billion
S0037	gah two point seven billion
S0115	um
S0037	dollars
S0115	there be probably countries that uh
S0037	oh i'm sure
S0115	that that would struggle to have uh a positive uh you know particularly countries that be in debt
S0037	yeah
S0115	struggle to turn over that
S0037	we saw one of the harry potter at christmas though didn't we which one be that d'you remember
