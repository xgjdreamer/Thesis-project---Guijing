S0482	mm don't know that one it just i don't like
S0483	i get it get i don't know i can't remember it's something to do with he's on a pair of roller boot or roller skate or something he get hold onto the back of a van or something go under a lorry
S0482	i just don't like the kind of calamity comedy whatever you know like oh no he's do it it's all go wrong and then the catchphrases come out and i just sort of think mm you know
S0483	yeah no it's it's crap it's crap
S0482	catchphrase stuff it can be it can be good but
S0483	yeah
S0482	i think the catchphrase itself have to start off be i don't know
S0483	you're say that ooh betty be not the best catchphrase in the world
S0482	he have a few didn't he erm
S0483	i think it be mainly ooh betty
S0482	be it
S0483	and a few you know
S0482	what be the yeah what be his other catch
S0483	i don't remember any more i think that be it
S0482	and who come up with that one ooh betty
S0483	well it's his wife's name
S0482	no i i know but it's not it's it's not very erm diverse be it well you can use it in lot of different ways in different scenarios and it and it be grow as a kind of contain catchphrase
S0483	well you know it wasn't a sophisticate comedy be it
S0482	no not really i like the goon show
S0483	oh my god so how many er hours burn time do you think i've get from those log that i've er
S0482	i'd say you're up to about fifteen minutes
S0483	no no i'm sure a bite longer than that
S0482	that log be a big
S0483	surely that would last us the even
S0482	no
S0483	really not even me big log
S0482	no we work out apparently if you be go to have fire occasionally
S0483	yep yep yep
S0482	for a year you'd need about four metres square area of wood
S0483	erm you say we work it out who work this out
S0482	so imagine imagine well i say we er the guy who write that book i read say that and er and and i
S0483	okay so four four square metres
S0482	yes so
S0483	hang on so hang on a minute hang on a minute hang on a minute hang on a minute oh so be that so be that two by two cub
S0482	so if you imagine two no it's two well i don't know
S0482	four sorry four cube metres sorry my wrong four cubic metres
S0483	four cube metres so be that a two by two by two
S0482	yeah two by two by two so imagine like a pokey bedroom two metres by two metres
S0483	yeah yeah full of wood
S0482	full of wood that's for occasional
S0483	and that can give us what well how many yeah but how many be occasional fire
S0482	if you do every night
S0483	mm
S0482	pretty much
S0483	no no no no no never mind that you've get to define occasional fire so erm
S0482	i i don't know
S0483	i know i know but i mean basically you can knock out kind of march to october say
S0482	he say like on chilly summer even
S0483	you won't have a frigging fire on chilly summer even that's ridiculous
S0482	no actually no that be for use it every day
S0483	well anyway well listen
S0482	between between that between four and nine
S0483	no i don't think we you know we'd probably be talk
S0482	but i think for us i think for us more more like on the lower end of that maybe three
S0483	i don't think we'll be use it in the summer
S0482	no i know that be the occasional use
S0483	well no but i mean occasional use to me would probably be about twenty a year
S0482	oh that really be occasional
S0483	yeah
S0482	i'd imagine er yeah a hundred a year every every three days every day
S0483	a hundred a year be mental we'd never have that many
S0482	well er and er they have it every day at the moment
S0483	yeah well they they're yeah but it's still a novelty for them and they could probably heat the house a bite better with it cheaper than electricity or whatever but you know that's not happen and they're live you know and they're at home more we're too busy fannying around look after kid and things so we're not go to be sit in front of the fire be we
S0482	be we where be we if we're not at home in the even
S0483	no i know but what i'm we're not gonna have them that much so all i'm say be that log might do us
S0482	yes i know no okay that one log the rotten log that you pick up from the
S0483	look that will do an even
S0482	it's not go to burn very well anyway even when it's dry
S0483	it will if it's rotten it'll burn nicely
S0482	yeah but if you think about it when something rot it lose a lot of its er stuff
S0483	yeah but it's dry it's nice and dry
S0482	it's not dry
S0483	it will be
S0482	oh it will be yeah
S0483	yeah and then it'll go up nice
S0482	yeah it'll go up quick and nice
S0483	yeah yeah
S0482	we'll get five minutes of of nice flame and then like we need more wood
S0483	do we have to get a wood basket
S0482	yep
S0483	mm where be we go to put that that's gonna put dirt everywhere
S0482	erm i'm afraid that's what come with a fire
S0483	ah
S0482	but erm i do think basically what we should do be we should chuck out our wood base
S0483	yeah
S0482	erm work out roughly how much space we have
S0483	yeah quite a bite there yeah a lot there yeah
S0482	clear it try and and then obviously we'll just stack it up
S0483	oh no we've get a lot of space there
S0482	erm i think it'll be really good a really good lot of storage that's right out the back door
S0483	yeah we've get a lot of space there yeah yeah we've get a lot get a lot of space there and we could put one out the front we could put one out the front as well
S0482	it would make it look a lot better there as well
S0483	yeah but we can put one out the front
S0482	oh i don't know our neighbour might
S0483	yeah
S0482	walk off with it
S0483	yeah you're not kid he would as well erm ah cool that's good news yeah erm be say about put some deck in maybe and i just say whatever you do don't paint it
S0482	yeah difficult to treat deck isn't it
S0483	yeah no it's just difficult to treat deck well i do well i don't know i mean it'll need to be treat it'll need to be stain or something but i assume that last a lot better than paint cos that's what most people do so
S0482	why didn't we do that oh we need to paint it cos yeah
S0483	well well we have to paint it cos it all get flaky paint on it mm yeah oh but yeah cos they've get all that space to the side of the erm lounge
S0482	yeah that's it's a big size plot
S0483	yeah yeah it be
S0482	i like it i think i think i definitely would have build the house closer to the road
S0483	yeah yeah you don't need a big drive
S0482	you don't need all that big garden
S0483	no no no no no you don't
S0482	it's the front garden really
S0483	yeah yeah but it's nice you know nice and manageable and easy
S0482	yeah i need some lime
S0483	i like i like that get shedloads of lime have we get lime
S0482	and a lot of fruit
S0483	yeah they need use up though
S0482	interest definition of shed load
S0483	well it be three be a lot you only get four in a bag so
S0482	if you're er if there's three people in a boat and you're die of scurvy then three lime be probably a life saver but
S0483	mm mm wouldn't have think so i think you might need more
S0482	although the problem be not scurvy probably doesn't matter do it
S0483	don't know
S0482	or do it reverse
S0483	er no i think you can reverse it
S0482	well i mean you can reverse it cos it's a dish condition you can treat it
S0483	well no er mm
S0482	er what be i in here for
S0483	er lime onion fish
S0482	yeah that's all in here oh and er sauce

S0483	i wonder how much it be
S0482	it's like about eighty p
S0483	be it
S0482	so it's really cheap
S0483	we ought to buy big then won't we
S0482	yeah i'd buy buy like twelve or something
S0483	well may as well buy a year's supply how long do it last for
S0482	i suspect quite a while i think a tin last for a while erm twenty july twenty seventeen
S0483	there you go we'll get an apocalypse an apocalypse level of coconut milk
S0482	absolutely
S0483	fifty two one a week
S0482	don't go crazy
S0483	we could get through one a week
S0482	one a week fifty two
S0483	well actually no this be about it's about half a week so we need twenty five to get us through a year
S0482	get twenty five then
S0483	i will i'll get twenty i'll get twenty
S0482	a years' supply sort of thing you win in a competition
S0483	a years' supply of coconut milk
S0482	yes twenty five can that would be a really
S0483	well that's it like grandad get his years' supply of whisky but i don't know how much it be but he get through it i three months so i mean it be obviously not really a years' supply
S0482	do he
S0483	yeah
S0482	you'd you'd think you'd think it would have to be base on like they just keep give it to you for a whole year until
S0483	yeah well they can't what if they get a proper alky it's not responsible be it mind you back then
S0482	well then that person have a
S0483	but i'd have think what would you what would you think would be a years' supply of whisky
S0482	i mean a years' supply of a ten year old would be well none you know they wouldn't drink it
S0483	yeah
S0482	so what's official a years' supply
S0483	a yeah but a years' supply of whisky what be that three bottle
S0482	twelve bottle
S0483	no it can't be you can't be
S0482	a bottle a month that's what a quarter of a bottle a
S0483	yeah i suppose yeah twelve bottle then
S0482	quarter of a bottle a week be what
S0483	god
S0482	er seven what how be it a litre a standard or be it seven fifty
S0483	er no it's seven fifty
S0482	so then you know that's only about two hundred mil a week
S0483	yeah i suppose
S0482	which be like four double a week
S0483	no it's not much at all so twelve bottle and he get through that in three months wasn't an alky i don't think he drink anything other than whisky i don't know if i saw him drink wine or anything
S0482	well that's the other thing isn't it it would last us a while cos we don't really
S0483	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's your tipple yeah yeah yeah yeah that's your tipple tipple of choice
S0482	tipple of choice
S0483	i guess it probably it's about the only thing he could taste as well must have be a bite of a taste trip for him maybe
S0482	why do he have a taste problem
S0483	couldn't taste anything
S0482	oh really
S0483	couldn't smell anything couldn't smell lose his sense of smell in the war get some sort of
S0482	from an injury
S0483	no no no from erm i think it be like a bug you know like the sort of thing you pick up like dysentery or whatever don't think it be dysentery but
S0482	bloody hell really
S0483	yeah whatever it be knock his er
S0482	you'd really you really only appreciate what you have when you've when you lose it don't you
S0483	well
S0482	sense of smell's one of those things you probably just i remember when i lose my sense of smell for a couple of weeks it be really weird
S0483	yeah yeah yeah it be rubbish yeah
S0482	it it but it be just i mean i i think i remember think to myself what if this be it you know
S0483	yeah
S0482	like they don't they don't come back but it wasn't it wasn't a massive one
S0483	no
S0482	i sort of think that would be a pain but oh well
S0483	it would be a pain i mean put it like this it would be life would be cheaper cos you wouldn't you you you wouldn't bother with wine
S0482	but but remember i get taste from my tongue and i notice that one more even just in the short period
S0483	yeah but i'm just say like you wouldn't need to go out for dinner ever you wouldn't drink any nice wine or anything any more cos you wouldn't be able to taste it you'd be able to eat quite healthily cos you do you know what i mean like er
S0482	it's not like acid level it's not that
S0483	no i mean like for for me i'd just eat lot of fruit and veg cos i wouldn't be able to taste it'd be proper healthy
S0482	it would be a shame wouldn't it
S0483	it it would be a shame i wouldn't need chocolate any more i'd be the healthiest person ever
S0482	i don't know now you see because no you see cos you still get that reward from chocolate even if you don't taste it
S0483	no you're not gonna bother no no no
S0482	no you do yeah you would
S0483	no no no
S0482	okay just smokers don't care about the taste of cigarettes particularly
S0483	no i know but the reward you get from chocolate be nowhere near the level of reward you get from have a fag
S0482	no but you can get a little bite of a like after a meal it make you feel right even if you've not taste it
S0483	no no bullshit no if you can't taste it it's worthless
S0482	oh no
S0483	no and it doesn't and and in fact it case in point i never do it when i've get a cold if i have a if i have a if i have a segment of dairy milk and i can't taste it i quit i don't even bother keep go
S0482	what do you
S0483	what's the point there's no there's no reward
S0482	well that okay but i could taste it on my tongue but i suppose maybe your grandad have lose his tongue taste
S0483	mm no no basically the only things he could really properly taste be stem ginger
S0482	talk of which
S0483	uhu yeah ginger
S0482	we don't have any do we
S0483	yeah we've get load of ginger
S0482	be that
S0483	yeah be there for months
S0482	be it
S0483	yeah it's sprout
S0482	where
S0483	down down down
S0482	down down
S0482	kneel down okay brilliant you should have tell me
S0483	do you think we can grow it
S0482	what i don't think we need to it's do it by all by itself
S0483	no but like i wonder if you can grow ginger or whether you need erm well don't kill that bite i know do it
S0482	i dunno well it grow underground yeah it's like a it's a root oh
S0483	a root don't hurt it's root though
S0482	oh i'm not i'm just try to cut around it like the
S0483	what what yeah well you've kill that other bite now you'd better do that bite as well
S0482	what bite
S0483	i know well you've just flap this flap that's not gonna do it any good be it do you think we should grow it where be we gonna put it
S0482	erm i dunno
S0483	it look very keen to grow and it be grow in the dark
S0482	yeah well
S0483	i suppose it just grow through the grind yeah i know but i've never have it grow before but then we've never keep it that long before
S0482	you're you're definitely not gonna be team botanist in an apocalypse movie
S0483	what fuck no more botany than you
S0482	i know but well clearly you possibly don't
S0483	i think i do i beg to differ
S0482	well you only just work out that the reason why it sprout in the dark be because it's when you're underground it's dark
S0483	yeah alright i know you chuck potatoes in the dark as well but
S0482	oh i see now you're just show off
S0483	mm
S0482	put all the ginger in
S0483	mm this be good this look good
S0482	look good
S0483	well it's food it smell nice
S0482	it's just do in possibly for family
S0483	ah sorry yeah i've buy load more leeks again they're just on such good value at the moment
S0482	it's fine leeks good i like i think they make a better base for a thai meal than onions actually that's why i go for load
S0483	i don't know you i don't think you can beat an onion
S0482	well i regret cut off a very big piece of ginger
S0483	ginger's very good for you though good for colds
