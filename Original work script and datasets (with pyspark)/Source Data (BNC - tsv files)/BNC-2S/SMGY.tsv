S0436	right then anyway i don't know whether you do have anything to say well i'm go to use the opportunity of have you corner to make you tell me all about your erm oliver performance
S0435	if you insist
S0436	well yes i want to know go on
S0435	erm what about it in particular
S0436	i just want to know how it go
S0435	yeah
S0436	cos you never tell me anything
S0435	well it generally go quite well nothing very eventful happen or at least not that i could see happen be not on the stage
S0436	in the pit
S0435	pit yes
S0436	they exile the orchestra to a hole in the grind
S0435	it's a very nice hole in the grind
S0435	we get a much more spacious sort of so the the for the amount of people there be you get a lot more space as an orchestra player than you go as a person be an actor
S0436	you mean what they have backstage
S0435	yes
S0436	fair enough i suppose they just have a lot of them and they have to squeeze into the dress room or something don't they
S0435	and there be sofas down there
S0436	sofas in the pit
S0435	no in the bite behind it
S0436	okay
S0435	so it be very nice
S0436	i be think i have never be in a pit with sofas in it that would be interest
S0435	well there be there there there be the sort of stand fall over and that that be that be eventful
S0436	oh yes you say it collapse on to the piano or
S0435	yes
S0436	oh yes but do not the piano be okay
S0435	er it be a keyboard so
S0436	oh well fair enough who care then you know it's only well however many hundred pound
S0435	yes it's but it's quite old it's it's the school's one
S0436	fair enough but er anyway so but how be the oboe part i you know
S0435	it's it it's reasonably good it's
S0436	do you get any tune
S0435	er yeah i do actually
S0436	lucky thing
S0435	well the first violin part be much better
S0436	yeah well that's what you get if you're a first violinist
S0435	you get silly you get silly cadenzas and everything
S0436	where do they have silly cadenzas in oliver
S0435	in the erm fagin number you know the one where he just wander around the stage
S0436	oh yeah i think i'd better think it out again
S0435	yes
S0436	i like that one
S0435	and yeah it's when people cos we've stretch them out and shorten them a bite it be all sort of a bite conductor go no no stop and the violinists go to have to get to the end of this cadence
S0436	who be the conductor
S0435	erm
S0436	one of the music teachers
S0435	yes
S0436	do i know them
S0435	probably not
S0436	so it wasn't they erm the lady with the loud velvet clothe
S0435	no
S0436	what's she call again
S0435	miss
S0436	ah yes i keep on forget her name it sort of mentally rewrite her as our know that one with the clothe
S0436	obviously they all have clothe but you know what i mean
S0435	i think she do it i think she do it last year
S0436	yeah
S0435	i think this be first year she hasn't do it you know
S0436	other teach just have clothe whereas she as you know clothe
S0435	yes no yeah but there be erm i'm not sure what's happen next year because the erm drama teacher who do it erm the music teacher who's who do it this year aren't go to be there so they're leave
S0436	oh they're leave be they
S0435	yes
S0436	heavens
S0435	so it's all a bite of a sort of luck to what we're end up do i think one of the ones people think be likely to happen be hairspray which i think it's rubbish
S0436	be it i'll admit i watch it and i now don't remember you know i watch the video thingy of it
S0435	yeah
S0436	and i don't remember any of the music from it which be not a good sign no i lie i remember one bite of music from it but that's i don't remember it for be in hairspray
S0435	fair enough i don't know
S0436	well
S0435	i i i think there be quite a lot of things i think they ought to do but they never would cos they'll never do sunset boulevard quite apart from the fact it probably not fit into their appropriate standards although they have down oliver miss saigon and les mis so you can't really
S0436	well especially miss saigon come on
S0435	gon but erm quite apart from that nobody like the music
S0436	no i don't think that's even the problem i think the problem be it have three main roles
S0435	yeah but it's get
S0436	and no one else get to do anything
S0435	but the chorusy bits be proper chorusy bits
S0436	oh yeah but i mean there really aren't very many chorusy bits be my point
S0435	yeah but i think there be ones that come up a lot worse than that in term of nothing but solo part
S0436	yeah fair enough i wouldn't know i'm not as educate in the matter of musicals as i probably ought to be consider how much time they spend listen to them
S0435	i don't know i think that
S0436	your sister's useless
S0435	i have an entirely different everyone else be say even though it's probably not possible for license reason everyone and their dog want to do wicked
S0436	oh this be the wicked thing again
S0435	cos i think they're make it into a film at the moment aren't they
S0436	oh yes i hear that
S0435	so you won't be able to get license i'm sort of ninety nine percent sure you wouldn't be able to get license
S0436	i think you like it
S0435	yeah well i think the best bite about it isn't the music
S0436	fair enough the costume be good
S0435	the costume and set sort of would definitely put the music to shame
S0436	yeah well it's i mean i can't judge it's it's not my style of music and frankly that sort of narrative isn't thrill me either so yeah
S0435	and if you're go and i don't know if you're go to do tacky pop music musicals it
S0436	you should do mamma mia
S0435	no no no you should do legally blonde cos that one's just funny that one be just it's it's ridiculously american but it's funny and it's actually get some quite music in it for be a silly pop music musical
S0436	i don't understand where you develop your sudden obsession with legally blonde
S0435	it's really it's ridiculously tacky but it's good
S0436	be this your friends on the internet again
S0435	no not really
S0436	or be it an influence or
S0435	no no i don't think it ever have do
S0436	well i really don't understand it then
S0435	well ah well the one everyone like at the moment be on the er erm internety people i know at the moment be a one a very recent one that's about shakespeare
S0436	erm a musical that's about shakespeare
S0435	yes
S0436	er go on you have to elaborate now
S0435	i think it pretty much come down to it it's not as in they put shakespeare to music it's a musical about the guy shakespeare
S0436	about i gather that cos musicals base on shakespeare play already exist that's what you should do you should definitely put on shakespeare for kid
S0435	oh no
S0436	yes
S0435	i think if you're go that you ought to do
S0436	complete with the sheepskin costume thing
S0435	no i i think they ought to do that erm the the very weird musical version of much ado about nothing that actually have some quite decent music
S0436	that's just because it have paul mcgann in and paul mcgann with not come to your school
S0435	no i i just find it hilarious that somebody do that
S0436	bless you
S0435	yeah
S0436	oh dear speak of paul mcgann you be say weren't you have you hear anything more about your
S0435	oh the rivers of london
S0436	yes and your optimistic
S0435	but he no no no no no it's erm there's there's the it's so far there's it it have be it's a project that's be openly do by sort of say to be be do and so that's all fine cos it's erm they're sort of it's they haven't yet cast anyone or officially put down anyone's name sort of for anything in particular yet but well
S0436	then personally i wouldn't put any faith in it but
S0435	mm well the the fact that they've just be do very well on the erm the the the jonathan strange and mr norrell television thing
S0436	oh it's the same people do it be it
S0435	yes
S0436	oh fair enough oh hang on you say that before didn't you
S0435	yeah and so it's the same people do it
S0436	i just wasn't listen obviously
S0435	and they've have quite a lot of a success there
S0436	mm
S0435	but it's sort of still hopeful that they might it's not that they've er and it's not just that they've say oh we will do this it's a sort of they've officially put it on their website as one of the project we're work towards so
S0436	mm that's yeah by the way when i finish that jonathan strange and mr norrell ha ha she say be you know two hundred page through it or something it's quite a dense book really i mean
S0435	for something which be really not erm for kind of
S0436	it's kind of embarrass to admit that but i don't know i think i've just lose the knack of read things sort of for pleasure so many academic article er but anyhow but anyway when i finish it would you be keen to join me in watch the television thing you know i'm no good at watch television by myself
S0435	i've already watch it but i'll watch it again
S0436	well that be sort of what i be ask
S0435	yeah
S0436	hang on have the final one come out already
S0435	oh yes last week or the week before or something
S0436	oh fair enough i'm just behind the time aren't i then again what else should i expect but er but anyway it be good be it
S0435	yeah
S0436	well yeah promise
S0435	you've probably come across what's his name john segundus and you have to admit he's he's he's lovely
S0436	he's only be in the book a bite so far basically at the begin
S0435	he never get much further he's never a main main character but
S0436	yeah
S0435	he's he's recur none main character
S0436	he seem like one of the more decent people in it so far
S0435	and what the his er hit his friend erm
S0436	oh yeah
S0435	you know they're nice
S0436	well i don't know kind of be a bite of a i don't know a pompous caricature kind of character but
S0435	yes but i think he's nice they're nicer than
S0436	i suppose fundamentally i tend to go for sort of you know well mean character at least but there you be that's why i don't do literature course i run off and study medieval literature where everyone be a psychopathic murderer
S0435	anyone else it's only because that's what they think be interest
S0436	erm perhaps i don't know you know in the case of icelandic sagas you do wonder whether it's just i don't know you know modern icelandic literature seem to be pretty much the same they just like read stories about psychopathic murderers obviously
S0435	i think it come from live in a country with with no sun probably i think it's a general whole different outlook on life and then it be a it's less let's look for happy things in our book and let's look for actually things happen lot of things happen cos if you if you don't actually have any sun for ninety per cent of the time you might want to spend your time be interest rather than just
S0436	yeah i don't know i i like to think it's not how i'd react but then again i'm sure there be lot of lovely happy book write in iceland and i just haven't read them but
S0435	yeah but that probably come the fact that if you if you look at the english book that be famous in other countries probably have not very many of them be sort of nice lovely happy ones
S0436	happy read you might be right yeah
S0435	i think you'd probably get a ridiculous
S0436	i've graduate i don't need to read literature
S0435	you'd probably get an disproportionately high amount of sort of murder mystery things and crime stuff from sort of
S0436	you know i think they tend to kind of
S0435	i think there's
S0436	i suppose old school crime we be a thing but
S0435	yes but they i think it's all sort of
S0436	sort of the more modern stuff
S0435	mm
S0436	it's all harry potter isn't it
S0435	i think it's probably the main one everyone's hear of
S0436	i don't know lot of things sadly the rest of the world english book and we don't read theirs cos the english be too snobby to do a decent translation of foreign literature be there any particular reason why you're try to take my hat apart
S0435	no
S0436	well please don't then it's a nice hat i like it just cos you think it look daft
S0435	it do
S0436	of course it look daft it's a straw boater what do you expect
S0435	well i don't know i i think you can just i don't think you have learn anything from dirk gently it's not try to persuade people not to wear hat it doesn't work
S0436	that's the only thing you learn from dirk gently
S0435	i think the only real applicable life thing
S0436	not even about the inventor of the cat flap
S0435	yeah possibly
S0436	the difficulty of discover gravity
S0435	it have never occur to me and i don't think i have much use for it now i know it but i would say that yeah
S0436	dearie me they be funny book though aren't they
S0435	i'm still embarrass about how long it take me to realise that erm erm in the radio adaptation what the the the guy in the second the long dark tea time of the soul erm
S0436	mm
S0435	the guy the the marry couple i can't remember their surname now
S0436	oh oh
S0435	cynthia and simon bracock
S0436	something like that
S0435	that that that the guy be play by peter davies and it honestly didn't click
S0436	oh i remember you come run up to me and squeak he's peter davies in the
S0435	i never notice
S0436	erm i i suppose if i be feel a little less charitable i'd point out he's an actor it's kind of his job to sound like different people but erm yes
S0435	yes but but but but i can recognise quite a lot of people in anything by their voice cos i mean you know the guy who play vimes in erm the erm night watch
S0436	oh yes and you hear him on the radio
S0435	you can i can always tell him
S0436	but he have a really distinctive voice
S0435	yes but i suppose peter davidson doesn't have a highly highly distinctive voice but it's still not exactly generic
S0436	well i don't know i think it be fairly generic whereas the the chappy you be talk about he's very distinctive cos he's one of those people like roger allam he's completely incapable of say a word that doesn't sound deeply sarcastic which be i suppose why he make such a good vimes in the first place
S0435	mm
S0436	speak of roger allam
S0435	yes
S0436	do you ever erm listen to the er the the the the
S0435	i listen to a bite of it it be on the radio recently
S0436	i didn't even say what it be
S0435	yes the les mis
S0436	yes
S0435	i listen to a bite of it cos it be on the radio
S0436	and
S0435	i think it be do quite well it's it's a really weird though because it's it sit somewhere between the book and the musical which i'm really not use to in term of it go into far more detail in quite a lot of bits that the the musical doesn't even notice happen in the first place and then them then then then you have then you have the then it skip over massive bits in the book that i wouldn't have well maybe not massive bits but then then it sort of it go into load of detail about him steal the coin from the small child and things and angsting about it for age
S0436	come on that's dramatically important
S0435	yes but it's dramatically important and entirely not at all present in the musical
S0436	yes
S0435	if you get what i mean
S0436	i don't know i just
S0435	but so but it's not vital to the plot but be a sort of atmosphere builder in a sense
S0436	well i don't know i i'd at least rank it as characterisation
S0435	okay but
S0436	but go on what's what's the bite they leave out
S0435	i can't remember but i seem to they they just sort of
S0436	it's a very long novel i suppose different adaptations can make different choices
S0435	yes
S0436	you probably didn't get far enough into the radio adaptation to notice that it be rather sweet they basically telescope all of the spare students into one person
S0435	which one do they name it after
S0436	er hang on it be
S0435	i think it's combeferre in the end
S0436	yes which be kind of odd
S0435	one of the distinctive ones to begin with wasn't he
S0436	well no that's the thing he doesn't really do much in plot term doesn't do an awful lot of plot term but er you know sort of in the book courfeyrac be the one who you know go around do stuff and rescue lose puppy and laugh at his terrible fashion choices and things so do they still have
S0435	so do they still have courfeyrac
S0436	no they just kind of
S0435	oh
S0436	so they
S0435	have grantaire marry enjolras and then they just condense the rest
S0436	yep
S0435	so there be four of them
S0436	hang on come here your hair be do awful things
S0435	no it's fine
S0436	well no you're
S0435	no it's fine
S0436	actually your hand be stick in your hair
S0435	no it isn't it's fine no
S0436	okay
S0435	so there be four of them
S0436	er pretty much
S0435	try to lead a revolution
S0436	well it be imply that there be lot of people in the background
S0435	okay
S0436	i mean you know there's what there's
S0435	just the rest of them be mute
S0436	there's what be nine of them in the novel or something
S0435	but it's all
S0436	and there's nine of them try to lead a revolution
S0435	that's a double not but i think four people be the only people who talk during a revolution be a bite
S0436	perhaps but come on it's a radio play how many
S0435	yes
S0436	you know distinct voice can you really get but you know there you be i suppose also you know they add in the oddest bits though from what i remember
S0435	i presume they didn't add in pot plant and things
S0436	no they they do dedicate several line to erm sort of miscellaneous composite student ramble about tomatoes and i presume
S0435	and i presume they didn't wasn't
S0436	which wasn't in the original
S0435	i presume they didn't do the erm mystic sultana or whatever
S0436	but that be just the come on the that be perfectly unexceptionable in the original it be just you know
S0435	the translation
S0436	yeah translators with cloth ears i don't know it be just mystic sultana
S0435	wonder which erm which translation they mainly base the radio thing on
S0436	oh doesn't make much odds do it
S0435	probably not but i presume they lift quite a lot of the erm
S0436	yeah
S0435	text straight out quite a lot of the erm speech straight out of the book
S0436	not that i particularly remember but i don't know i suppose of course if you erm base it on the penguin classics translation you might fall into problems
S0435	what do they do
S0436	er basically the penguin classic translator hat the book
S0435	oh
S0436	it's rather funny he write a long sort of translators note at the begin explain how he felt it be his moral duty to make up for all of the terrible things in this book which do make you wonder why he choose to translate it in the first place but there you be
S0435	presumably they tell him you're go to translate this cos you're our you be our french translator
S0436	mm perhaps but it would seem a little what do i know about translation
S0435	i presume they don't get very much choice in it really cos if i presume they don't have sort of hundreds of each language translators
S0436	i'm sure there be gazillions people who can translate french
S0435	but i mean you have to be not only competent at read french and read in english you have to be competent at read and work out what on earth he mean and then write it out in something which be close enough to the original that it can count as a translation but not so awful as sort of let's get out my dictionary and translate every word
S0436	yes well i think some people would argue how much er the er a penguin classics translator actually succeed on that front but again you know i think try to translate all those pun in french would drive anyone mad
S0435	and like the usual
S0436	i'm pretty sure most of them sail right over my head because you know look at me do i speak fluent french ha ha no do i speak fluent nineteenth century posh french by someone who's disturbingly addict to bad pun er what do you think but
S0435	i don't know i i like in the version i've read the the the fact you've occasionally get footnote on seemingly sort of entirely unneeded footnote section just sort of say this mean this this this okay good to know but i don't know what you're talk about
S0436	yes yeah dear
S0435	mm
S0436	do you bother finish read the book
S0435	i don't know i take it off my kindle when i be do a whole sort of spring
S0436	spring clean
S0435	yes because i end up change the battery but first i take everything off to see whether that help cos whether it be a sort of er what do you call it er a sort of what i sort of
S0436	you're go to have to give me some more information to go on
S0435	erm it's a sort of er you you they when it go through and sort of er so you can use a search function and search through book i've forget what the word be call and it it sort of it have to go analyse the book first and if it hasn't do it yet it slow down the battery life horrifically it's a
S0436	oh you mean it let you search inside the text of the book you have store on it
S0435	yes
S0436	it i don't know that mine even
S0435	index yes it do
S0436	let you do that
S0435	erm it's an index
S0436	cos mine isn't a kindle
S0435	erm the it it index book and if it's halfway through it or sort of get stick index a book or something it will it slow down the battery life to or sort of it make it sort of
S0436	eat up the battery life
S0435	eat battery life ridiculously quickly
S0436	mm fair enough
S0435	and so i just take everything off and then that be one of the things which i didn't end up put back on because i wasn't read at that point
S0436	mm fair enough i need to do that with my silly phone though
S0435	what's the matter with it be it just slow down
S0436	although you know it do it before but apparently it's just what android phone do sometimes i look it up on the internet and pretty much everyone say this happen and just after a while it decide that there's erm there's no space leave for sort of download apps and things even though you do have storage space leave it just refuse to acknowledge that
S0435	ah
S0436	and there's apparently no way to fix it other than put it back to the factory settings
S0435	oh
S0436	so mine's get to that point again this be the second time it's happen and furthermore i've finally get my new er sim card
S0435	ah
S0436	in the post and low and behold it's not recognise that either so sort of you know last bright glimmer of optimism be that if i put it back to factory settings it might finally twig what's go on with that as will which would be nice cos i ring up the man this morning and he say oh yes yes yes that's perfectly fine you just need to leave the sim card in your phone for an hour before you restart it so i walk it into town this afternoon and funnily enough it do nothing thank you man on the phone really helpful
S0435	i don't know i just keep everything on an sd card on my phone
S0436	i keep everything on an sd card but it doesn't recognise the space on the sd card
S0435	oh
S0436	i think it's just one of those
S0435	can yours use an sd card
S0436	yes that's why it have an sd card in it
S0435	yeah but but the tablet you've get upstairs be an android one and it update and it didn't it it refuse to use it unless you sort of do sort of jail break it
S0436	really
S0435	yes the newest versions of android don't let you use them even if you've get slot in your device
S0436	oh heavens well perhaps i don't want to put it back to factory settings then or it'll have a fit at me
S0435	maybe it's
S0436	rr technology
S0435	maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's only for the tablets rather than the phone but i'd check it first just cos seem like a bite of a rubbish thing to
S0436	mm oh i don't know if that be the case i'm sort of stick either way aren't i
S0435	yeah
S0436	i mean i suppose at least in the current situation i can i can access the things that be already store on the sd card i just can't put any new stuff on there whereas theoretically if it just revoke my sd card i
S0435	what version be you on
S0436	heavens i don't know
S0435	be it a sort of be it jelly bean or kitkat at the moment be the new one i can't remember
S0436	do i really look like i pay attention
S0435	no
S0436	well you would be right i don't pay attention but no i'm at least one update behind cos i keep on ignore it cos cos life be difficult and i have too many things to do and make i don't know console noise at my phone while it have identity crisis be really not top of my priority list right now
S0435	mm
S0436	that's the problem with smartphones they just have a much greater capacity to be really really stupid
S0435	that's why everyone that's why that's why everyone buy iphones because they've get no capacity to anything except exactly what they think you ought to do on them they be sort of they be there's lot of support and there's a generally by have reduce amount of stuff you can do on it you be more sort of not in term of apps but just in term of it sort of lock everything away in close file and not let you access anything or change anything it mean that a lot less be likely to get break
S0436	mm fair enough i wouldn't know everyone keep on say how the hardware conk out in no time at all so
S0435	in iphones
S0436	yeah well they've always complain about that
S0435	everyone's complain everyone complain about the screen but i'm i'm not sure whether that one's and actually because they have i think it be partly because they have the expose screen at the corner cos the glass go all the way and it doesn't have a bevel edge
S0436	mm
S0435	on a lot on the sort of five's and thing so it mean if you
S0436	but
S0435	drop it on its side it's the glass bite be sort of expose to be
S0436	yeah
S0435	take a lot of the pressure well pressure the energy and sort of
S0436	yeah i take your point
S0435	yeah whatever you call it
S0436	yeah well come on your the one do physics i haven't study physics since i be your age pretty much
S0435	that doesn't mean i can remember which of the right word which mean almost exactly the same
S0436	i'm pretty sure
S0435	but each different
S0436	well they never really bother teach you that at gcse do you do they blah
S0435	no not really
S0436	no
S0435	they're much more keen about teach about household wire
S0436	really
S0435	yes
S0436	you still do that how quaint
S0435	and stop distance of cars and how stop distance be affect by whether you be on drug whether you be have be drink how sleepy you be the visibility the road surface the weather condition
S0436	i hate the
S0435	the what else be there
S0436	and you do stop and wonder what this have to do with physics don't you it i do hate those socially relevant bits of the curriculum because it's just it's not science it's just
S0435	in on the science no in in one of the in one of the erm chemistry paper i've do recently
S0436	mm
S0435	one of the question be honestly it say humphry davy discover erm how to use electrolysis to get erm potassium i think it be
S0436	er i'll take your word for it
S0435	sort of something like that
S0436	it sound plausible i can't remember which element humphry davy discover
S0435	i think it's potassium i think it be potassium and one of the question
S0436	ask your mother she'll know
S0435	be actually why be the scientific community quick to accept this experiment
S0436	well that's good
S0435	no the answer be because he be well know as a as a scientist
S0436	well i don't know i i see what your object to but at the same time i don't know i personally think it's quite interest and potentially useful to sort of sort of work out how how the science sort of get scienced rather than just you know appear one day on a stone tablets as it be
S0435	mm
S0436	it's not as silly as one of the question we get be it in a practice gcse paper or be it a practice year nine sats i don't remember now but we genuinely get a question oh what be it it be something to do with you know mrs x say she doesn't want to take these tablets from her doctor because they're make of chemicals what would you say to her
S0435	oh dear the world be make of chemicals
S0436	well that be pretty much what i write and of course that be the right answer but that's one step away from the biology question about what the plant need water sunlight ice cream come on i've tell you that story before it be in the multiple choice section and one of the choices it have be ice cream ah i don't know
S0435	but i think i mean
S0436	ice cream
S0435	what be it in in what be it in physics again they really struggle to fill the physics lessons with actual physics cos they have a a how mobile phone affect your health and how sort of we erm and and why some people think that mobile phone be evil and you should never have them and kill you because they have microwave
S0436	mm so do microwave
S0435	they weren't put those arguments against microwave they be just say
S0436	yeah
S0435	there there there there there's microwave and and and microwave heat up water and there's water in people
S0436	oh miss erm of all the possible arguments you can bounce against mobile phone imagine that stupid br engine thing they make us do at remember that
S0435	yes the the drink lot of water because you're you you're brain need water to function because it's it it it
S0436	your brain run on electricity
S0435	electricity
S0436	and water conduct electricity where do you even start with that
S0435	and i think it's the same people who say that the water be absorb through your mouth into your brain
S0436	through the roof of your mouth or something yes
S0435	your mouth in
S0436	they didn't actually say that to our face to be fair that be just on their silly website or something my goodness it be embarrass we use to have you know actual activity week and we get to do activities and then give us that nonsense be some kind of replacement i'm sorry mm and i never even get to do any of the real activities weeks because i be always at and i mean i like
S0435	no but we have a basically we have a study skills workshop
S0436	but well to be fair if that's good it's useful but
S0435	and it okay we all say oh look here how how to remember a list of they honestly give us seven random word or something and say how will you remember these one of their things how to do
S0436	oh this be your stupid pneumonic thing that you hate
S0435	okay one of them be come up with an action for each of the word
S0436	you'd look pretty daft in the exam wouldn't you
S0435	well that get you probably disqualify from the exam
S0436	i don't know how much wave you have to do before they throw you out of an exam one of my friends from erm last
S0435	no and the other one
S0436	year be an invigilator i could ask him i suppose
S0435	and and one of one of the other ones be okay so now we've get your word
S0436	uh
S0435	now think of something which sound like that word okay then put it in a scenario with a word that rhyme with a number in in a sequence
S0436	oh yes you say that
S0435	i'm learn three time as much stuff here how be that helpful
S0436	mm well you know sort of i have to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that for certain things it work because you know those people who can memorise entire card deck
S0435	but they do it in actual
S0436	do you use these kinds of things
S0435	but they use much they then the the card deck the thing about the difference between those be that instead of have actual mean it what the each of the things have they be just sequence aren't they
S0436	i've never you you mean the card deck be a meaningless sequence
S0435	yes the card be just be just a meaningless sequence and maybe people can see pattern in it but as it be it's just a
S0436	whereas the problem the problem with try to teach you that you should be do your revision by learn things as meaningless sequence be most of it isn't a meaningless sequence yes
S0435	a meaningless sequence
S0436	yes it's just like erm
S0435	and if if if you reduce things to meaningless sequence you find it harder to then apply it when you need it cos there be very few exam question which just say name the thing this arrow be point at
S0436	yeah it's just like mummy always use to complain about with the er cgp maths text book
S0435	oh oh
S0436	cos they do an awful lot of that thing where they say would say you know memorise five formulae or
S0435	yeah
S0436	you know proof for geometry or something
S0435	yes
S0436	whereas actually you could condense it down to one or two
S0435	mm
S0436	if you actually understand how they work but
S0435	yes but honestly i somebody be look through a maths text book whoever write these text book i don't understand what happen in their brain they have a picture of a triangle and for no apparent reason there be a photo of a goat in the middle of it
S0436	that's just cgp try to be quirky
S0435	yeah but it wasn't even cgp
S0436	really
S0435	no
S0436	oh no the blight be spread obviously
S0435	it be something it be something that be try to be more sensible than it obviously be because it it i don't know you can tell it be try to be a upmarket one
S0436	mm yes
S0435	honestly the cgp ones the little comment they put on be so patronise they're just okay so now you've read this page over once so now what i want you to do be close the book go on a nice brisk five minute wake come back read it again and repeat so then you will now automatically remember this for the rest of your life and this will automatically be the best way of you learn this information
S0436	you're just object to be tell to go on a five minute walk don't you
S0435	mm
S0436	lazy little so and so
S0435	no not exactly but it's just this idea that they say how much time be you mean to spend if you're mean to be do this for every single page they ask you to
S0436	no i i accept that it's rather patronise but honestly for for all my final exams i do memorise almost all of it by write down the things i need to have memorise on bite of paper and then just walk round and round and round in circle in the garden just you know declaim them to the tree
S0435	i find do actual
S0436	i get some rather funny look i will admit but you know it work
S0435	i find do sort of do actual sort of question and things on them cos that mean when you get one wrong or you can't answer it you look back find out the answer and that answer always be the one that you can remember
S0436	cos you just remember the cripple embarrassment that can fail to remember something so obvious the first time
S0435	yeah
S0436	at least that's how it work for me but yeah no obviously some things you do need to just memorise by rote and to be honest i do kind of favour the you know recite ad infinitum thing you remember when i do er gcse be it gcse or be it a level a level the one where we er have to do all memorise all those english light set texty things so we could cos it be close book you have to be able to do quote well i don't know they want us to just take relevant quote out of these poems and memorise the quote but they be poems you can just memorise the poems so i
S0435	i think the whole get it a i think the whole idea about get you to
S0436	i remember i spend a lot of time in the garden that summer recite you know dylan thomas and stuff
S0435	to mm mm sort of all of the things that have the close book english things be that you're not actually
S0436	it's not really test your literary analysis in a way yeah
S0435	ly test your english cos if they want to just stop you from have the answer write on the book you're take in just give just give people the passage you want them to use or the poem they want you to use as a fresh piece of paper it's not like you're
S0436	level we have erm open book exams and they just say you have to have a clean copy of this text to take into the exam
S0435	yes but that that that's a fair enough thing but do that because actually you're not really english be i don't know the one thing in its favour be that actually it's not something where mindless memorisation be a sort of
S0436	it doesn't seem like a terribly relevant skill in many ways yeah
S0435	cos i mean for science you can you can't really get away from the fact that it's pretty much mindless memorisation
S0436	on a certain level the whole the whole stick they're sell with the english literature be you know engage your creativity creativity and stuff so yeah you do kind of wonder
S0435	well i i i personally don't think maths be mindless sort of memorisation but i think a lot of people do
S0436	mm maths nerd
S0435	mm
S0436	oh well i tease but it's good be you still think of do maths at university then
S0435	i'm not i'm certainly do it at a level i think
S0436	yeah but you know you've get plenty of time to decide from there
S0435	i'm still probably think either computer or computers or maths
S0436	well they're both sensible choices i mean except in the sense that you're then go to have to support your impecunious older sister when you grow up
S0435	well i don't think i will need to i think you're probably go to get along fine
S0436	erm
S0435	you're go to do better than somebody who hasn't get a degree at all
S0436	perhaps it's possible to be over qualify for stuff but
S0435	i think you're probably not aim to get the job that you be go to be over qualify for
S0436	i don't know at some point i might end up settle for settle for you know give me money please before i have to live in a cardboard box will conjugate verbs for food
S0435	er yeah
S0436	yeah i don't think many people make it with a where the big money be as linguists but there you be
S0435	you could go and do speech therapy and things
S0436	erm mm
S0435	yes that be your response to that and it be about the most obvious response ever
S0436	well you know it need do but
S0435	you're not
S0436	i'm not sure why anyone would think i would help but er there you be also you know i'd probably just lose concentration and start teach them how to speak old english by a mistake which would be kind of funny but probably not very socially responsible
S0435	you'd teach them how to how to learn the name of small furry animals in old english or be that old norse but
S0436	no it be old english dr use to give us small furry animal of the week it's a hedgehog
S0435	i be about to say hedgehog
S0436	i can't remember what we cos we end up buy a little cuddly hedgehog as a mascot but er we send him travel i can't remember where he go in the end i expect he'll come back at some point we might have send him to australia with she's i mean she be very attach to the yes be an odd fish
S0435	so do it just get send around the world and people take picture of it next to various recognisable things and send it back or be it just a
S0436	erm i think that be sort of theoretically the idea but erm mainly it be just sort of you know in the way that a bunch of students do a hedgehog turn up so there be a hedgehog and we all think it be funny
S0435	and do it get a name
S0436	erm sometimes it be just call erm name him something incredibly long that have lot of irish in it
S0435	oh
S0436	at one point i think i didn't dare ask i leave the irish to
S0435	be that like nineteen hamsters
S0436	er no
S0435	so it wasn't a weird as knight hamsters
S0436	well it wasn't in that the whole thing be deliberately silly from the first place whereas
S0436	and i give you know inappropriately formal name to hamsters be just us get rather over enthusiastic in first pet name no asnacs be just strange there be the time where we walk into the common room and find someone have cover the entire whiteboard with dragon it's just the kind of thing that happen
S0435	my computer thing the computer thing i go to on saturdays we walk into one of the other room and there be a whiteboard in there and they have entirely fill it up with meme things as in
S0436	oh dear
S0435	you have pepe the frog and
S0436	what
S0435	oh it's just a thing
S0436	no go on you have to explain what be this do i want to know
S0435	it it it's one of the it's an internet meme and it's a particular draw of a frog i think originally from a children's colour book
S0436	hang on be this that horrify thing you have on a balloon
S0435	yes
S0436	and i ask mummy why on earth you have a balloon with a cartoon frog on it and she say you wouldn't tell her
S0435	yes
S0436	why do you have a balloon with a cartoon frog on it
S0435	cos everyone be draw things on balloon
S0436	do you draw that on the balloon
S0435	yes
S0436	well it be very well draw if you be try to draw a distort cartoon frog
S0435	they be also draw pokémon on them as well
S0436	er well actually you know draw pokémon on them be slightly more understandable i mean except in the fundamental sense which i don't understand pokémon personally yeah
S0435	yeah you you be never i think it's a sort of next stage horsy person thing in a way
S0436	mm really
S0435	yes it's the sort of get to collect a lot of cutesy things
S0436	oh fair enough
S0435	or maybe it's a pre horsey stage
S0436	i don't know my experience be they be do by rather different sort of cliques as it be
S0435	okay maybe i think it's in the same vein though
S0436	well in weird obsessive things to do as a child yes but
S0435	but i mean even weird obsessive things you do as a child
S0436	mm i don't know
S0435	and i think the people who actually play the computer game be a different set of people from who play the trade card things
S0436	yes i think it be people i know mainly play the card again i wouldn't have know if they'd play it one the nintendo doodlies because you know what attention do i pay er but there you be but no mainly what i get out of
S0435	but the but the thing about the trade card be it it be a sort of mainly boys do it it when i be around anyway it be mainly boys do and it be very much a status it didn't actually matter what the card be sometimes
S0436	just as long as you have a super rare one yeah
S0435	so sometimes it be football sometimes it be pokémon there be there be those little plastic erm
S0436	the crazy bone things you mean
S0435	the little plastic figurines the ones which be sort of
S0436	they be
S0435	sparkly and some of which be plain colour
S0436	yeah i think they be i think they be the crazy bone ones
S0435	or well i i think they might be
S0436	they be they be sort of an inch tall and
S0435	yes
S0436	various kinds of colour plastic and they be sort of shape like little cartoony monster alien things
S0435	yeah i'm not sure if that's what they be call or that they be a forerunner or whatever to them i can't really remember exactly but those be another thing and it be a
S0436	well
S0435	it be a very much a status thing have as many and as sort of excite a one as possible and so it didn't actually matter whether you be interest so lot of people do the pokémon card have no interest in pokémon but they do it as a i'm a i'm better than you i have better pokémon card than you
S0436	you're a purist aren't you dear
S0435	no
S0436	just a little bite
S0435	i think i i just don't get the trade card
S0436	well you know me
S0435	you might as well
S0436	i have no collect instincts so
S0435	you might as you might as well just have a set of trade card which be number and the higher the number you have the better so you swap a a a hundred and twenty four for a for two seventies or whatever and er
S0436	well i think that would be a little bite too transparent they they need to have sort of you need to have more than one i don't know more than one axis on which you can measure the value of an individual thing
S0435	you can count the next
S0436	so that both people think they're get a good deal
S0435	you can have an x and a y axis and the further away from the point of origin the better the card
S0436	yeah you really be a mathematician at heart okay now all i'm think of be er that bite in cabin pressure and i start three months ago with a cheese sandwich
S0435	cheese sandwich
S0436	oh dear
S0435	be the sort of person who wouldn't end up buy them at all but would still end up with the largest collection
S0436	i do like cabin pressure
S0435	of course you would be heartless not to
S0436	that be erm helsinki wasn't it
S0435	yes cos it be the
S0436	cos he be er take the orchids to his friends milo
S0435	and there be the not chocolate cake i i i make it more cakey but it didn't it just make it bigger
S0436	make it bigger
S0436	oh dear have you have those scandinavian mostly chocolate the import tax
S0435	the import
S0435	poor caroline in that one you felt so sorry for her
S0436	well you felt sorry for a lot of them poor arthur
S0435	give me some cake
S0436	some cake
S0435	i think i feel particularly sorry for carolyn in that one just because none of it be her fault at all
S0436	yes well come on the whole point of carolyn as a character be it be very rarely her fault i mean it's often more her fault that she'll admit but generally speak she's always sort of
S0435	yeah but i think this be so much not her fault that
S0436	yes
S0435	it be all far too much to do with her but entirely not her fault
S0436	yes it turn out that's how many cigarettes you can fit in a fishcake
S0435	in a fishcake
S0436	oh dear that remind me actually erm i need to bother you to er give me er your zurich so i can finally put it on my mp3 player
S0435	oh haven't you listen to it
S0436	of course i've listen to it
S0435	oh you just haven't
S0436	i just don't
S0435	own it at the moment
S0436	i just don't have a copy whereas we do own a copy it's just you know not on my
S0435	i'm talk about sort of talk about audio you know last year for my birthday
S0436	i do know last year
S0435	you get my
S0436	oh yes you still want me to log into to the diddly squat yes
S0435	yes so i can just download it because actually rip cds be just honestly the the system to which they name the erm for the track be
S0436	well it's not design for it
S0435	i know it isn't but honestly i have do audio stuff and i have get german rock music track name and picture and i'm just sit here go isn't there a way to just do clear all and it just label it one two three four five six
S0436	yes yes
S0435	it doesn't do that it think it's clever enough that it know that this be german rock music
S0436	yeah well i suppose it's the you know it doesn't really want you to be do it because
S0435	i know it doesn't but it's entire it's entirely fine to do it with the cds you've buy though for quite a lot of quite a lot of circumstances because then once you buy a cd it come with a sort of a you you're allow to rip this and put it on your mp3 player slash phone
S0436	i don't know it's mm so long as you keep it for private use
S0435	so long as you keep it for you self
S0436	blah blah blah
S0435	and although they they don't have a very good way of enforce it if they're give that you that function
S0436	it would be nice to have it function
S0435	yes
S0436	function function wow
S0435	oh and the fact it have a silly thing where it doesn't always organise them by track it sometimes it have a an inherent erm sort of order system that it it doesn't show you in the track name or number or sort of date or anything
S0436	mm
S0435	and so then when you transfer it to other things it doesn't keep that inherent order
S0436	it just do its own weird mixture
S0435	yes it would be much better if you want to order it like that just put an 0 one 0 two 0 three
S0436	it just really need to come with its own you know sort of number wizard thingy doesn't it
S0435	yes
S0436	yeah well go on you're the computer whiz you write a programme
S0435	honestly it really wouldn't take much
S0436	i'm a medievalist i don't believe in computers that's a lie most medievalists know all about computers oh well but anyway yes i could do that this even if you remind me to be honest
S0435	yeah
S0436	yeah
S0435	you like dark ice didn't you
S0436	oh yes definitely i mean i won't pretend to but i'm
S0435	it's very good it's get evil glow cloud of orange gas
S0436	fair enough that's really not sell it to me but
S0435	that want to take over the universe
S0436	i think the all hail the glow cloud thing be something else
S0435	no no no no no this be this be the erm the join the eminence and infinite warriors
S0436	you say that as if you expect me to understand
S0435	no i don't
S0436	okay i just won't ask
S0435	but it it it doesn't i don't think it i'm not sure how much it glow but it's definitely orange and it's make up of the consciousness of a weird megalomaniac scientist and a weird megalomaniac dalek
S0436	and it's a cloud
S0435	it's a gas
S0436	okay
S0435	that the weird megalomaniac scientist create to upload his consciousness into then everything all sort of go a bite wrong and
S0436	ah this really be more fi than sci isn't it
S0435	er yes
S0436	to say the least
S0435	but then you look at star trek
S0436	erm well
S0435	you've probably never watch enough star trek to
S0436	oh i've only watch the episodes that you have so i i saw that odd one where they be there be some kind of salt monster thing
S0435	oh the one
S0436	that turn people spotty
S0435	oh that one
S0436	i be a bite confuse
S0435	yes
S0436	i don't know and apart from that i sort of know by reputation the tribbles
S0435	yes
S0436	thing but
S0435	and the fact that everyone wear red die
S0436	yes i think i mainly learn about that from galaxy quest
S0435	i have never watch star trek when i watch
S0436	well neither have i but it be just funny
S0435	it's just so funny even so and i can't imagine how much funnier it would be if you'd actually watch a decent amount of star trek
S0436	it be just a very very funny film that
S0435	i think alan rickman really do it well
S0436	well
S0435	i think he really be the stand out one there really
S0436	erm
S0435	for it the woman
S0436	whoever it be play the token lady who be feed up with be the token lady
S0435	she token lady she be quite good
S0436	she be very good as well they be all pretty good though
S0435	but i think you if you be go to give prize out i think alan rickman would win the prize for that film
S0436	well he just he just very much have a line in that particular kind of supercilious feed up with the world
S0435	yes
S0436	doesn't he at least from the very few things i've see him in
S0435	but i mean as far as i i've be lead to believe people who really like star trek be entirely on board with the fact they they don't differentiate and say this isn't a star war film
S0436	hang on
S0435	they count it as be the the galaxy quest
S0436	you mean star trek
S0435	star trek
S0436	yes
S0435	i do i still get them but the people
S0436	well they sound similar
S0435	the the star trek thing be erm that they basically do just go oh well it's a star trek film if we say it be
S0436	and you'd have to be pretty heartless not to recognise that i haven't even watch star trek
S0435	apparently apparently and apparently
S0436	and i could tell that the people make it obviously genuinely really like star trek and it be entirely affectionate
S0435	no mm no but i mean er to the extent where apparently sort of multiple proper sort of no official in term of internet official do by at sort of when when you have you know on the internet you have the official favourite sort of favourite star trek film list and things you know when people do them
S0436	erm
S0435	instead of just be one person sit there on their computer and do it sort of you have big websites publish these
S0436	which i expect be also one person sit on their computer to be honest
S0435	puter yeah but quite probably but and you sort of quite often er it get put sort of as one of the top star trek film
S0436	well good for them
S0436	good for them yeah
S0435	why do we have a little spinney thing stick in the garden
S0436	oh the er
S0435	be that an
S0436	windmilly thing
S0435	yeah
S0436	it might be i sort of presume it be a futile attempt to keep the pigeons away from the bean
S0435	possibly that make more sense
S0436	cos you know sparkly spinney things be mean to scare bird like people hang up erm old cds
S0435	yeah i think
S0436	i cannot operate my tongue today
S0435	i think pigeons be pretty unphased these days
S0436	yes well certainly these pigeons be
S0435	honestly you you run up to them and they just sit there look at you
S0436	you're all so proud of how tame the degu's be they've get nothing on the pigeons
S0435	i don't think i really want to stroke a pigeon though
S0436	probably not a wild one no yes i don't really want to think about where it's be then again if you think to hard about where a degu's be you probably wouldn't want to stroke it either
S0435	oh don't be mean to them
S0436	they be filthy little vermin
S0435	they're no more than
S0436	yes they be
S0435	no more than any other pet rodent
S0436	they really be other pet animals can be litter train
S0435	i think degu's can technically ours be just
S0436	well you didn't do you
S0435	ours be just not very good at it
S0436	what be they very good at apart from make a mess
S0435	eat
S0436	oh wow
S0435	actually no they're not
S0436	no they can't even do that because they drop their food on the floor and can't find it again yeah sorry they're pretty dim
S0435	i know they're just innocent gerbils though
S0436	mm i don't know it's a debatable point i reckon they're definitely not as dim as
S0435	that would take some do
S0436	it be just so sad when she keep pull her bed out of her nest and take it round and put it back in poor little thing
S0435	i think she wasn't exactly the brightest
S0436	no she be a very good little hamster
S0436	she just be a bite thick
S0435	and didn't like run or anything
S0436	she do she use her wheel
S0435	she she do the she do the hamster walk in the wheel but if you out her sort of and see whether she'd actually do anything faster than walk speed she very much refuse
S0436	oh no she do she just do it at night well she's a hamster they're nocturnal come on give her some credit
S0435	mm
S0436	oh honestly
S0435	i don't think i'm not go to you can try and persuade me but i don't think she actually would ever be an athletic hamster
S0436	probably not but she wasn't as useless as you're try to make out she be very nice she be fluffy
S0435	she bite you
S0436	no she didn't
S0435	she bite me
S0436	she get a lot better anyway
S0436	she be just a bite scar that's all
S0435	yes i know
S0436	poor
S0435	but you have to admit that's one place where she be very much more horrible vermin than degus
S0436	yes i really don't want to be bite by a degu though that could do serious damage i think
S0435	they could i think hamster's pretty hamsters can if they really try
S0436	oh i do get a hole in my thumbnail once
S0435	yes
S0436	yeah but you know on the whole we'll just have to treat them nicely
S0435	lot of green
S0436	well i don't know in the case of the degus it's probably likely to lead to your finger be chew entirely accidentally but
S0435	well you don't mean that
S0436	yes they've just vicious little teeth
S0435	i
S0436	or vicious big teeth
S0435	very much bigger than hamster teeth
S0436	mm and with a lot more power behind them
S0435	i think a lot more power in practice but theoretically i think hamsters could probably do
S0436	i'm not engage in a who would win in a fight conversation about small rodents this be silly
S0435	cookie
S0436	i have some dignity
S0435	not cookie would win in a fight if there be and if there be any food at stake
S0436	i have my dignity
S0436	not much but i'm attempt to cling to it okay plus it's silly anyway i didn't say when i go out to see today she ask after the degus
S0435	they're definitely still around boinging
S0436	that's pretty much what i say she she's decide she want a pet
S0435	what do she want do she still go for duck
S0436	of course she still have pet duck this be we're talk about
S0435	but be there anything she's but it's not a serious consideration want pet duck
S0436	well long term it be but
S0435	yes
S0436	all of this want a pet be fairly long term
S0435	mm but i mean it's not the the the want a duck isn't something she's take into full consideration right now be it
S0436	er
S0435	or be she think so be she think small furry animal fish stick insect or dog or cat
S0436	well i think she be more just think in the abstract that she's lack small furry animals in her life cos you know when she be at university she er do the her volunteer thing at this bird shelter
S0435	yes she like bird
S0436	yes she really do we go and sit by the pond in the park
S0435	and feed the duck or
S0436	well we didn't have any bird seed but we talk to them
S0435	probably not allow allow to anymore be you
S0436	i don't know really to be honest certainly not allow to fee them bread so cute though the duckling there be a tiny baby duckling
S0435	ah
S0436	and you know you know the erm sort of gravel thing that slop down to it keep on fall on it it just keel over sideways and it wave its little feet in the air and then it's mother have to come and sort of prod it up right again
S0435	they be idiot little creatures aren't they
S0436	well it be very baby it be try its best
S0435	ducklings be unreasonably cute aren't they
S0436	they really be
S0435	i mean quite a lot of baby bird aren't very cute be they
S0436	well certainly before they have feather they're just kind of icky
S0435	and even afterwards quite a lot of them be still a bite sort of small and not quite right shape
S0436	oh bother
S0435	what
S0436	oh just speak of me speak of my go into town thingummy
S0435	forget to buy something
S0436	no i forget to post a letter
S0435	oh
S0436	i mean it doesn't really matter and i could walk down to the end of the road and post a letter i be just you know have a nice little glow of pretend i be a competent adult who remember to do things but i have be reveal mm
S0435	oh
S0436	be you okay
S0435	yes
S0436	you're just look kind of zone out
S0435	i'm tire
S0436	yeah be you still feel poorly
S0435	nobody's really teach me how to sleep properly
S0436	most people don't need to be teach
S0435	i know
S0436	usually it just sort of happen
S0435	i still can't get to sleep in the summer i'm definitely not somebody who's good in warm weather
S0436	little squeekity
S0435	yeah i've never work out how people actually enjoy summer i mean i enjoy not be at school and be able to not
S0436	i like the sunshine
S0435	have some sunshine be nice but i don't like the fact that it make everything far far too hot and everything's all humid and sticky and
S0436	no it be it be horrible the other day but it's really rather nice now
S0435	yes but most people think this be too cold for summer
S0436	mm don't move to america and you'll be okay
S0435	i know i wasn't plan to
S0436	well to be fair stay in england
S0435	there be lot of reason why i don't really want to move to america but
S0436	yes
S0435	and the weather be probably one of the least ones the least important ones
S0435	yes we be
S0435	yes
S0435	erm well sorry erm yes but i think the weather be probably one of the reason why one of the least important reason why i don't want to go to america
S0436	er that's probably fairly reasonable on the whole i mean there be lot of nice things about america i'm sure but yeah
S0435	i'm still worry they have place in america where it's sort of think of as normal to just walk to the shop with a gun
S0436	i know
S0436	it's cos you're just a crazy liberal eh
S0435	yes i know but
S0436	don't you know it's a human right to be able to shoot people whenever you feel like it
S0435	yep
S0436	enjoy well that's
S0435	somebody who i don't like the like the look of look at me i think i feel threaten i shall shoot at them
S0436	yes
S0435	that be do seem how seem to be how it go down quite a lot
S0436	yes and i mean i'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt doubt and assume that almost all of the time it be nowhere near that bad but it doesn't take very many time for it to be not alright certainly what you get in the newspapers be a bite scary
S0435	but i mean i i do i be in sort of i can't remember it be one of these sort of english or fpt lessons where we be tell
S0436	fpt
S0435	faith philosophy and think it's your
S0436	oh
S0435	whatever you as you call it
S0436	we have pshe be it
S0435	no no no it's the re
S0436	oh no re why be you do gun control in re
S0435	cos we general do ethicy stuff
S0436	oh fair enough whereas we do our ethicy stuff be pshe
S0435	ah and it be either an englishy thing or whatever and it be it be a sort of a sort of we do stuff on a you know when you do things on argue whether capital punishment be right and things and whether gun control be lot of things about gun control and i look it up and i be you i think the amount of people sort of who be murder sort of firearm murder in america be more than sort of most of europe put together or something
S0436	oh well i mean that's what you would expect
S0435	yeah
S0436	i mean you have to take into account the facts because
S0435	no but i mean i
S0436	it's a bigger place with more people
S0435	place people
S0436	but also honestly you would expect no less when it's so much easier to get hold of firearms but
S0435	and it's a sort of the mass shoot rate be i think in a year be higher than sort of in the last year be higher than sort of erm higher than england and australia put together or something
S0436	mm i've no idea what gun control be like in australia
S0435	er less strict than in england but still reasonably so i think
S0436	fair enough i suppose
S0435	and do you know in erm one of the arcticy circle place i think it's in canada it's svalbard or somewhere it's a country where
S0436	svalbard isn't in canada
S0435	okay maybe it isn't wherever wherever it be
S0436	it's really not
S0435	where be it then
S0436	isn't svalbard norway
S0435	possibly it's one of the very arcticy circle bits where there be lot of polar bear
S0436	uh
S0435	apparently if you erm if you go out of one of the main cities you have to legally have carry a rifle with you and a and somebody who's train to use it cos there be so many polar bear around
S0436	mm well then
S0435	and apparently it's the only place in the world where there's any legal requirement to carry apparently there's a place in actually apparently there's a place in america where for political reason although it's not an enforce law you have to erm your it be a sort of it be a a political statement thing they make it the law that everyone have to own a gun or something
S0436	oh but surely that's just something daft like all of those old rule they say be on the book about
S0435	yes
S0436	i can't remember be allow to shoot welshman with a bow and arrow
S0435	and the not be allow to shoot can within fifty foot of house or whatever or carry a plank of wood down a street
S0436	i don't believe that one be ever real
S0435	apparently so
S0436	nah
S0435	i think it be only a crowd street or something not a street full stop but
S0436	well then
S0436	deary me but no i'd always i'd always find think i find those er you know sort of hilarious laws things well a lot more hilarious if not for the fact that you know they be entirely artificial in sort of in the same way that the world longest word or whatever be
S0435	the erm be the element not element the erm compound
S0436	well well
S0435	the the erm thing
S0436	well in well in english obviously you can make a a word that's pretty much as long as you like by just name a really complicate molecule
S0435	yes
S0436	and obviously that's one way of cheat so most people don't count that you but know even when you have supposedly real word
S0435	long they're a
S0436	mostly make up to be
S0435	the longest word
S0436	long word you know it's like no one ever get pneumona ultra microscopic silica volcana choliosis or whatever it be do they and if they do they certainly never call it that
S0435	and erm it's like the build the tallest build in the world you have no use for
S0436	oh no that's a lot more aggravate
S0435	a build a build that tall but you do it anyway but you do it anyway to prove that your better than whoever's get the tallest one in the world
S0436	i wish they'd stop do that
S0435	at that point
S0436	i mean it's just a sure fire sign that you have too much money and not enough hobbies as a country well at least some people live in the country but you know
S0435	if the whole country have that much too much money then you could spend it on useful things
S0436	yes but i be go to say it would be a little bite less than if you know you'd spend the equivalent equivalent amount of money build a giant skyscraper when you know half the people in the country be live below the poverty line that's when it really do have to start look at people a bite funny but there you be i mean we can't talk london's go to get a stupid garden bridge isn't it
S0435	i'm not sure why i think it's a silly idea
S0436	it's daft it's it's a complete vanity project i'm sure
S0435	yes i know but
S0436	i mean you know sort of
S0435	they could do worse
S0436	yes
S0435	but you one one
S0436	you can always do worse but
S0435	fact about silly erm london architecture
S0436	uhu
S0435	you know the skyscraper the one that's the cheese grater shape one
S0436	the cheese grater yes
S0435	yes the reason it's like that be because you have sight line that be set up so that they be on that if things don't cover the erm that so they're not in the way of the view of st paul's from certain areas
S0436	oh
S0435	and apparently the reason they have to build it like that
S0436	really
S0435	be because to to get it just outside the sightline
S0436	really
S0435	apparently so
S0436	where do you learn that
S0435	erm it be the internet but it wasn't just a random person
S0436	mm i'll have to look that one up before i believe it but fair enough yeah already do on the skyline
S0435	but apparently they're sort of ridiculously old laws that sort of
S0436	mm mm
S0435	it it it be a it be a when you start to get build erm taller er
S0436	yes yes
S0435	sort of just slightly taller than the erm st paul's they start say ah but what will happen you won't be able to see st paul's
S0436	well it's an entirely silly sentimental thing but
S0435	yes
S0436	i think it's nice be able to see st paul's and that be admittedly sort of an embarrass large amount of that be in my case due to have watch mary poppins at an impressionable age which be really stupid because that's such a kitschy commercialise idea of what london be and i genuinely believe dick van dyke have a cockney accent i didn't know any better
S0435	oh dear
S0436	it be the first rendition of a cockney accent i'd ever hear i have nothing to compare it against also i be never very good at accent
S0436	but no you never spend as much watch mary poppins as i do
S0435	i really didn't
S0436	no cos you be too busy watch the shiny show
S0435	oh shut up i think i be at a younger age at that point
S0436	ah i don't know
S0435	i watch the clangers and
S0436	well good
S0435	i watch a lot of the clangers
S0436	everyone should watch the clangers have you see the new clangers yet
S0435	no
S0436	it's really disconcert
S0435	do they do the wrong whistle noise
S0436	no why it's disconcert be because it it's very close
S0435	but not quite there
S0436	to the yes it's sort of it's sort of the faithfulness equivalent of uncanny valley or something
S0435	okay
S0436	it's make weirder by be almost but not quite but er yeah they've it's still a bite too jazz up and computerified for my taste and they seem to have do some sort of recolouring of things presumably so they can better sell merchandise to people which be vaguely annoy but i don't
S0435	you see i'm but i i don't know
S0436	it be it be rather good and you know on the whole i'm go to say well do them
S0435	i'm generally
S0436	but they take away the original music
S0435	and how can you remember it i'm really awful at remember music
S0436	oh i just think i just think the music really make all of those
S0435	but generally i'm not very good at computer animation for film and things generally i like computer animation but i really don't like the way they do computer animate film
S0436	mm in what way
S0435	the style they've choose to do it in
S0436	oh you're just talk about the current trend for children's film sort of the
S0435	yes
S0436	bubble head doll thing
S0435	and it's really become a thing that all of them do that to a certain extent
S0436	mm yeah just i don't know that's not a that's not a thing about the animation per se
S0435	i mean the and the really disconcert thing be that that that that you have these really sort of tiny neck tiny nose tiny mouth massive eye people but with with
S0436	so it's like all those manga people you use to draw
S0435	yeah with with perfect sort of unruffleable hair and sort of blocky unruffleable hair and then then then then you have these background which be pretty passable as be film
S0436	that be the problem i have with em your studio ghibli thing
S0435	studio ghibli
S0436	the background be so beautiful and detail and it look really weird see this you know
S0435	well i think they do it well i i think it's very much i think that the erm
S0436	no i i appreciate it's a matter of taste but
S0435	the contrast between the background and erm the people i think i don't know i think there's certain level but the thing about the people i have a problem with the background be the background be perfectly sort of render but look almost photographic then you have the people they be really out of proportion stylise but then there's fine detail and there's sort of the the textured skin the textured lips
S0436	yes that's the mm that's the problem i have
S0435	and the and the really detail irises and things and it just look wrong
S0436	yes they have you know they have a whole team of people do the their hair physics
S0435	yes
S0436	so it move right and so it look like a i don't know like a nonperson make out of person material and it's a little bite disconcert isn't it
S0435	yes
S0436	yeah but there you be that's why i think you ought to come with me to see the erm be it be the er
S0435	the thingy one the
S0436	the thing they're advertise by the people who do secret of kells
S0435	the one that look very very twee
S0436	yes but remember secret of kells look really really twee but it be just i don't know i'm
S0435	i think this one look more this be one look
S0436	i'm not sure i would watch the film as a film
S0435	this one look more twee than the secret of kells be a person and their dog go on an adventure kind of thing
S0436	but it's yeah well that be what secret of kells end up be really
S0435	oh
S0436	and i didn't see so many advert for that so possibly that's what the advert look like for this but anyway i mean i really wasn't watch the secret of kells for the story be i
S0435	no
S0436	i watch it because it's just it do my heart good to see people sort of do do animation that sort of take advantage of the fact that it's animation and sort of explore that
S0435	mm yeah
S0436	you know
S0435	but i think that's why i so really like the studio ghibli things because i think they be they they do take into account the erm they be a bite twee in the general sense but i think it's a it's probably a sort of i think it's a probably more of a culture difference thing why it feel less sort of sickeningly twee and more sort of happily twee
S0436	i think you're make distinctions i never even know exist but fair enough i you should probably make me watch some more of it you know give your sister some cultural education
S0435	howl's move castle be good though
S0436	howl's move castle be weird i i honestly think that the book be sort of odd and hard to follow but it have nothing on that film
S0435	that film be nothing compare with some of her other book though
S0436	no the the book be nothing compare to some of her other book but simply why do the black blob things where do they come from and why do they wear straw hat
S0435	that be that be spirit away
S0436	no no they be in the thing wasn't it i could swear howl's move castle
S0435	the little black spider things
S0436	no
S0435	oh
S0436	there sort of er blobby monsters and they ooze after them and they wear straw hat and i never understand why they be there
S0435	oh those i think they be just mean to be the witchy person's servanty people
S0436	yes
S0435	and if they
S0436	that doesn't explain why they be black ooze blob wear straw hat come on
S0435	i think they be lack ooze blob because they be mean to be be a show as be evil
S0436	and they wear straw hat because
S0435	to blend in with the crowd
S0436	naturally
S0435	because or they be mean to be be show to be evil but they be not mean to be look like they be they be mean to be be they be be use as passably human servant things
S0436	hello eldritch abomination oh but you're wear a hat so that's okay be you okay
S0435	mm fine
S0436	no i don't really buy that sorry
S0435	i didn't really question it but obviously i should have do
S0436	well obviously you shouldn't have do in sort of how the film work it be just at that point i be still naively try to understand what be go on and it be obviously a bad idea
S0435	yeah but they choose the right one to turn into a a sort of film that be go to make even less sense than the book because if they'd do it to pretty much any of her other ones
S0436	although you do have to wonder how much weirder it would be possible to make
S0435	to make well with the tale of time city the tale of time city be more easy to understand what be happen but why it be happen be an entirely different matter
S0436	yes and er what be the other one fire and hemlock
S0435	i never read that one
S0436	didn't you i could swear we get it up no i don't see why i would have read it if you didn't because i don't spontaneously read these things so i assume i pilfer it off you
S0435	oh i don't i don't remember read it
S0436	it be the erm tam lin one
S0435	oh i think i might have do actually i can't remember what it's about
S0436	erm oh don't ask me it make no sense there be something odd to do with stone gateposts at one point
S0435	oh yes
S0436	and erm she do her slightly disconcert narrative fetish for age gappy relationships again
S0435	i think so
S0436	and i honestly can't remember what else happen cos yeah i be rather lose
S0435	don't know i think her her what's his name ones be good i like them
S0436	yeah they be good fun
S0435	but i think after that they just get weirder and weirder
S0436	and howl's move castle be genuinely funny but it's not really my cup of tea i suppose i i do remember when i i be remember when i be read you howl's move castle and the lord of the ring at the same time
S0435	oh vaguely
S0436	and it be astound how much easier the lord of the ring be to read out loud
S0435	that's what didn't mummy find that when she be try to read you crest of
S0436	oh that be she refuse cos she hat read it out loud yes
S0435	yes
S0436	i think it's it's not bad to read one it you don't notice it when you read it to yourself i don't think at least you have to sort of be pay half an ear to it as it be
S0435	no but i i don't know it's very easy to you know the rivers of london book i have a similar problem i've have a similar problem read them and it's nothing to do with a problem with the write as such because he's a screenwriter you can if if if you look for it you can really tell cos quite a lot of other writers do have a maybe not to a very great extent but it's not just a he say they say she say sort of thing they sort of add stuff in to to put the text into put the speech into context
S0436	yes
S0435	whereas as a screenwriter you notice that what he do be he have text full stop thing happen and he do it very well it work very well but once you notice that consciously while read a passage it's really difficult to get past it
S0436	fair enough yeah i suppose i don't know i enjoy rivers of london well enough but i don't think i'd ever bother to read the rest
S0435	i think it be just cos i do like his things i think i think it's i think it's because i do like a dr who level of weirdness in my book
S0436	no it wasn't the weirdness put me off it be genuinely just too gory for me
S0435	well i think it get less or it doesn't it's not as bad in the later book
S0436	people get their face rip off okay it be traumatise
S0435	okay i
S0436	i'm a delicate flower
S0435	i don't know but i do like it though i really do like those book
S0436	yeah yeah fair enough i i think they're one of those things where i'm sort of go to be happy that they exist on other people's behalf but i'm not really go to bother get into it myself
S0435	mm yeah fair enough i
S0436	see as we appear to be talk about book again
S0435	mm
S0436	we're not very good at have conversations about other things be we anyway i be go to ask you have you start er read the
S0435	no not yet
S0436	fair enough
S0435	it's kind of depress sometimes i forget that there be some people that don't like douglas adams you have to be a real really different person not to it's like
S0436	i can see how you could not like like certain aspects of it but it's hard to see how you could not find the joke funny and and the thing be you always notice they're in people who read book i entirely could never manage they have different taste
S0435	i know but you know those sort of pseudo erm life like sort of people go on an adventure with their dog kind of book
S0436	no i really don't
S0435	no no you know michael morpurgo be a sort of be an uncanny valley sort of real life thing
S0436	you just don't like michael morpurgo
S0435	i don't but you know that kind of style of book and those sort of those soppy feel good book and the sort of the sort of erm that the oh i'm spend my time talk about my life nothing very much happen and this sort of book
S0436	you mean i don't know i suppose i tend to think of those as two separate things really
S0435	i think they be but i think they're very link
S0436	michael morpurgo be just a children's writer write children's book
S0435	i just can't stand it
S0436	whereas when you say soppy book about my life i think of those you know sort of awful ten a penny library book pastel cover and picture of blonde ladies on the front
S0435	no i don't mean those ones i mean the ones with the erm the sort of the the those light blue sort of photograph with the swirly white write on kind of one's
S0436	just think
S0435	but you know the ones i mean
S0436	don't judge a book by its cover ah
S0435	but i mean i think it's same sort of people who go on from things like michael morpurgo to those sort of book and the sort of the sort of people who really no
S0436	be this the fault in our star or something you're think
S0435	no not particularly
S0436	but you like that didn't you
S0435	not particularly but that kind of style of thing and the erm and the er sort of the whole sort of people who really like first person stuff
S0435	i mean there's nothing in practice wrong with first person there be
S0436	some of my best friends be in first person
S0435	i mean there be lot of really good book in first person but first person do quite often bring the worst out in book for me
S0436	yeah well i guess fair enough i've forget what you be read oh people who don't like douglas adams
S0435	yes i just there be people who like very peopley book rather than ploty book yes
S0436	well douglas adams do not have any plot either
S0435	no but he's work on the assumption that the lack of plot be erm i think the lack of plot be a be due to a sort of the fact that he's pack it too full of other stuff
S0436	i think he just
S0435	to put in a plot
S0436	didn't really have the attention span to write plot sadly
S0435	no
S0436	the joke be just so funny i don't know how you cannot find them funny
S0435	i have no i sort of have an understand why
S0436	lord you're turn into a penguin stop it
S0435	but i i can sort of understand why some people may not like hitchhiker's guide because of the sort of weird non sequitur
S0436	yeah it be very whacky and very disjoint
S0435	it be but how you cannot like dirk gently or hitchhiker's guide
S0436	well by most people's standards dirk gently be also very whacky and disjoint it only doesn't look whacky and disjoint when you come to it after read the hitchhiker's guide which doesn't even pretend to have a plot
S0435	well in the later ones it sort of try to
S0436	and frankly go massively downhill with it but there you be
S0435	i still can't get over the fact that the erm eoin colfer sequel be just so cos it be it be just a oh it be all a dream
S0436	really oh
S0435	it really be and it be that be the worst thing you could ever apply and it be all a dream to
S0436	er i don't know i'd say that it's as valid a plot move as most things that happen
S0435	yes but it be just a no no no no
S0436	in the series and
S0435	but but it be nowhere near as funny because he obviously wasn't douglas adams
S0436	yes but that be sort of inevitable
S0435	and so so he go down the plot route and take what little plot there be and try to make it into a big plot and then just say oh well it be all a dream they all actually die
S0436	really
S0435	yes
S0436	okay now i'm glad i didn't read it i mean i never really like eoin colfer anyway
S0435	i almost could manage but it be just slightly off
S0436	well i try to read artemis fowl and it be just it smack far too much of the target audience be hyperactive teenage boys for me to sort of really have the patience for what it be sort of it be very he jump up and down shout in your face
S0435	i think i manage my way though i manage about three quarter of the way through first book i think or something
S0436	i think i turn all the page in the book but mainly because i be transliterate the silly cipher they have at the bottom of the page which it turn out it repeat so that be pointless
S0435	i think i think if you do that you should at least write something interest that you wouldn't already find in the book
S0436	oh you you you didn't it be it be genuinely something new i think but anyway so i have fun with that but anyway i don't know who who would there's no one who could really write douglas adams except douglas adams i mean the closest you could get be terry pratchett
S0435	you could get be terry pratchett if they'd give it to terry pratchett you would have maybe you wouldn't have get a douglas adams look alike out of it but you would have get a good book out of it
S0436	yes i'm still sad about terry pratchett
S0435	yes the new book's come out though
S0436	yeah i don't even know whether i want to read it or whether it would feel a bite you know weird and morbid
S0435	i be because it's another tiffany ache one and i sort of
S0436	i'm not so keen on them you see
S0435	no i i do like them but i think the thing be that they're they're one of the few actual proper coherent sort of series within the
S0436	oh yes i just
S0435	and i feel that it would be a bite of a shame to
S0436	to sort of let that go you mean
S0435	yes
S0436	fair enough and i'll probably end up read it at some point anyway i don't know i think i'll probably just you know steal go postal from you again and curl up in a little nest of go postal so funny
S0435	i i still can't i still think night watch be just so utterly brilliant
S0436	the night watch be utterly brilliant
S0435	and i think that's not just cos it's funny though
S0436	yes night watch be one of the very thinky ones go postal have some very good thinky stuff in it as well it's just also i think in many ways sort of overtly funny
S0435	oh yes i think night night watch be one of the least overtly funny ones
S0436	yeah i mean it have some fairly good gag in but
S0435	the boil egg
S0436	poor and his hardboiled egg but er yes i just really like go postal
S0435	okay
S0436	yes but yeah you have to read it now you see you've only for the thing
S0435	mm
S0436	mm ah anyway we should probably wrap up now consider that we've be wittering on at each other for nearly two hours
S0435	yes
S0436	you be tell me you couldn't think of anything to say for that long
S0435	no
S0436	and you didn't even have to resort to summarise entire big finish and things which be
S0435	you still have time ten minutes
S0436	no no no no
S0435	be you sure you don't want the communist daleks on drug
S0436	i think i have never be surer of anything in my life
S0435	actually no you wouldn't get that one anyway cos i still don't understand it
S0436	and i think that prove my point
S0435	ahem just because there be far too many layer of non reality in it and then they start sing
S0436	do they start sing gilbert and sullivan be the question
S0435	no but they start
S0436	good
S0435	sing patriotic songs i think
S0436	real patriotic songs or
S0435	yes like
S0436	i can't remember what it be it it be cos all i can imagine now be sort of a fleet of daleks all burst into i don't know jerusalem or something
S0435	no it's a i think it's a communist thing or thing you songy thing
S0436	yeah well that would make more sense i don't know any communist songs the closest i know to a communist song be the song about the history of communism set to the tetris theme tune
S0435	oh
S0436	have you never hear that
S0435	i've hear of it
S0436	it's it's quite something put it that way
S0435	yeah
S0436	no i come across that at er one of those
S0435	asnacs
S0436	er not actually asnacs but one of those sort of student gather of those kinds of people yes this be also one of er youtube watch at midnight events that lead to me find that erm that those clip from a playstation game with tom baker's narrate a story about magical dolphins stop and save the universe
S0435	i sort of want to play that computer game
S0436	you've have to wonder what be go through their head
S0435	if it wasn't narrate by tom baker it would have be great
S0436	if by great you mean terrible
S0435	yes
S0436	how do that get pitch
S0435	i don't know i think they say well we know you like douglas adams so let's have dolphins cos cos douglas adams have dolphins
S0436	see the link
S0435	okay and okay get this save the universe see universe galaxy douglas adams and and then okay who can we think of that have a erm mm sci fi dr who
S0436	i think all of that imply a level of logical think that
S0435	wasn't it splash the dolphin or something
S0436	something equally awful yes
S0435	and didn't he get dolphins in spaceships and things
S0436	i wouldn't be at all surprise but all the weird youtube videos have be introduce to they do sort of blend into one
S0435	have there be more than one time time where you have dolphins save the universe
S0436	er no but then there be also the video about erm the mass murder llama that wear a hat
S0435	oh very everyone's hear of that though
S0436	well i hadn't
S0435	the erm the stephen carl one
S0436	oh yes it be call carl
S0435	i think the other one be call steve
S0436	fair enough i i wasn't pay attention i be too busy be traumatise er there be also the song
S0435	no not hear that one
S0436	you probably don't want to i mean you've actually read love prophet so you might like it
S0435	and then there's the nargle song do you never see that
S0436	no i don't want to do i
S0435	probably not it's not that bad it's an animate song about nargles
S0436	naturally cos what else would it be well this be the internet
S0435	it's less disturb than the llamas in hat
S0436	good although that's not really say very much
S0435	it be significantly less so
S0436	good although that's still not say an awful lot
S0435	and it's less traumatise then the charlie the unicorn
S0436	do you ever have to watch that
S0435	no nobody ever show that one to me
S0436	you just need to be surgically remove from the internet
S0435	oh no no no no if people my age i can say that
S0436	youth these days
S0435	a large proportion of them will have hear of the nargle song erm charlie the unicorn and what be the other one i be say that you haven't hear of be there another one no and probably llamas in hat as well
S0436	fair enough then again i learn fairly recently that what people of my age be suppose to remember on the internet be something about badger badger badger badger mushroom snake
S0435	well everyone know that yes
S0436	no i'd i'd never come across that
S0435	okay
S0436	i didn't spend very much time on the internet when i be little i spend a lot of time do equally pointless things but you know other pointless things read things of questionable literary value but you know maybe i can't claim to have grow out of that
S0435	you've read blank and fire
S0436	come on that be at least impressive
S0435	yes
S0436	you can't really claim it be bad just because that imply you have some coherent standards by which to judge its literary merit
S0435	i think i think that one have win discussions when people have be discuss who have read the weirdest book
S0436	no still have be beat on that one
S0435	what one have
S0436	she swear blind she can't remember much about it anymore but she swear blind she once read a book call the voodoo handbag
S0435	okay but it be weirder than a dragon that's dead and alive and a bridge all at the same time and trap in a railway tunnel and somebody get their arm burn off by a dragon bone
S0436	er i don't know i think we really do need to wrap this up now
S0435	yeah okay
S0436	bye bye mr record device
S0435	bye bye
