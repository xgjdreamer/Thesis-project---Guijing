S0192	what like anything
S0198	yeah i mean
S0192	doesn't that happen in the third week
S0198	maybe maybe we should test run it midweek next week just have a day on like wednesday or something when oh no that's too stressful
S0198	friday friday thursday 's come so she smoke
S0192	on a friday
S0198	yeah why
S0192	friday's my my good day it's the day i'm allow to smoke friday and saturday
S0198	no it's not we're not at work anymore any day can be friday although it be friday so i'm gonna have a beer and smoke a rollie and then we've gotta count your cds
S0192	if that's alright
S0198	yeah i think i'd rather have a beer first though
S0192	yeah
S0198	just to relax
S0192	do you mind go through the cds or
S0198	no i suppose not what be we do exactly just count them be there any purpose to what we're about to do
S0192	i've already tell you a i want to count them b i wanna go through the cds have a look at the cd
S0198	be you gonna catalogue them
S0192	it's as simple as be the case too damage be the cd too scratch
S0198	don't wouldn't it if we're gonna go through them wouldn't it be beneficial to start catalogue them though
S0192	i mean yeah but that would take a lot longer
S0198	well i mean otherwise we've get to do it all again
S0192	i mean yeah but the first time you do it it's really quick it's just open the box have a look at the cd check the cd that one's fine put it in that box quickly quickly quickly
S0198	but yeah i know but then i've gotta go back and do it all again rather than just
S0192	well otherwise i'm catalogue cds that might be too damage to sell
S0198	we don't have to do them we don't have to do them oh right well no you check it and if it's good you catalogue it if it's bad it go in the bad pile
S0192	but then i have to
S0198	and we just we don't have to do them all tonight just
S0192	that's more effort though isn't it
S0198	mark the box but if that's the inevitable purpose of your cd do this i don't what's the point in just what be i do
S0192	it's even more detail than that though because
S0198	oh no
S0192	you've get to write down the isbn number on the back
S0198	oh
S0192	so you don't really need to write down the detail all you need to write down isbn number and then you have to go to amazon marketplace type it in and then it'll tell you the product

S0192	cos i basically buy them burn them and then put them in a cd box
S0198	and then you didn't touch them again
S0192	didn't touch them
S0198	i mean you look over them a few time
S0192	yeah have a quick look
S0198	lcd soundsystem i think you've get that on oh no it should save
S0192	so i mean i'm tempt let's say i think what we need to do be erm basically document them all
S0198	mm
S0192	which ones be new which ones be use which ones be not sellable
S0198	mm
S0192	and then we need to check on amazon and see what kind of money can we make from do this
S0198	mm and then
S0192	be it worth it
S0198	calculate whether or not it's gonna make a profit
S0192	yeah be it worth it
S0198	how much of a profit
S0192	basically
S0198	when do we graduate like
S0192	two thousand and eight
S0198	cor my parent have get age since then look at my dad there he look kinda chunky well definitely compare to now
S0192	oh he do look fat doesn't he there
S0198	he look different yeah he look quite round my mum look younger too
S0192	your mum definitely do look younger
S0198	yeah
S0192	so do you
S0198	i mean yeah but it wasn't that how many years ago be that eight years
S0192	oh when we graduate just six years ago wasn't it
S0198	yeah
S0192	two thousand and eight
S0198	be that all it's be oh that's take care of my nan take its toll although my mum still look good for her age she be fifty seven now
S0192	yeah she do look good
S0198	so she look fine
S0192	maybe she look better with brown hair
S0198	yeah dunno why she's go blonde
S0192	no i'm not sure either
S0198	but she like it she like it my hair not that's something say to me actually cos there's a picture of my graduation photo the professional one up on the in the live room and she say to me why's why have you colour your hair and i be like i haven't colour my hair this be my normal colour my natural colour she be like ah it's just in that photo it's very different i don't think my hair look that much different but obviously she pick up on things kid pick up on things like that
S0192	mm yeah they really do don't they
S0198	much blonder in that picture she be like you look different
S0192	they really do
S0198	expect me to look like a picture that be take eight years ago
S0192	yeah why do you look different cos time have pass how about these ones like omar rodriguez lopez do you wanna sell those
S0198	not really
S0192	oh
S0198	i wanna beer
S0192	alright okay i'm struggle to get this back in the box which be kind of annoy now
S0198	i don't know if i do wanna count cds
S0192	don't know if you do wanna what
S0198	count cds
S0192	well we're not go to be we you already say so
S0198	yeah we will do
S0192	no we're not go to we'll document them another time i'm just worry about when we're gonna actually get time to do these things
S0198	i'll have a beer and then i might be quite happy to do it now's a good time to do it while we're chill
S0192	yeah i know
S0198	let's have a beer and then we'll start process them basically
S0192	what by process you mean write them down i didn't wanna do all of that tonight
S0198	i guess we can count them then to give you a rough idea of everything be that what you wanna do
S0192	well there's no point in take all the box out today either be there
S0198	it won't take us that long what to count them
S0192	yeah there's just so many we're gonna have to put them back
S0198	and get them back out again this be why they need document
S0192	i don't see any point i guess we do need to get them out a box at a time and to document them and write them down
S0198	yeah
S0192	just a bite of a mission isn't it
S0198	just do a box in here and then i mean we've get all year whenever they go or don't go so it just depend really doesn't it
S0192	we do have all year but we'll probably get busier and busier and busier as the year go on i think i'd like to get rid of them before i you know before we go to saudi
S0198	yeah i know i know i know i know
S0192	so
S0198	so you may as well do it sooner
S0192	just cos they're not do you know what i mean
S0198	this one be er five pound fifty use
S0192	oh that's pretty good and that one
S0198	oh i haven't look up this one yet old money
S0192	see a few of them we've look at now have be about five quid
S0198	yeah which i mean that would be a i mean that'd add up
S0192	i mean you'll get five quid for it your the postage'll cover the postage
S0198	this one's four pound three ninety five use
S0192	so i mean that's pretty good
S0198	not really make any money back on them though be you jesus
S0192	oh no you're not make any money on them
S0198	you've get all these copy no legit digital copy what if something break and gotta download it all again
S0192	that's something you get i wouldn't do something illegal like download
S0198	no you can download from itunes
S0192	it's too expensive
S0198	you just go without music
S0192	no i just borrow music off my friends indefinitely
S0198	i suppose so
S0192	i really don't understand why that's illegal
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	borrow music off my friends
S0198	never use to be what's this big one use to be able to lend each other cds didn't you
S0192	yeah i mean trojan dub well think about it you use to be able to record off the bloody radio
S0198	i know
S0192	that be alright wasn't it
S0198	yeah it be fine
S0192	and i could give a cassette to my friend that be fine
S0198	erm yeah it be all about make tap for each other
S0192	what they don't didn't like be the fact that you could very quickly share it with everyone
S0198	mm
S0192	not just people around you because now suddenly you could share it with the whole world
S0198	the whole world mm just upload it to something and you stop make money
S0192	but so what
S0198	i know
S0192	artists have get to realise that they make money in other ways
S0198	they make money from their art which be perform
S0192	memorabilia art performance but without their music effectively what be they it's like a footballer just i don't know you just pay so the footballer play regardless of whether you actually see the damn thing
S0198	see the thing
S0192	you know what i mean
S0198	i mean they get pay thousands don't they
S0192	but without without them play there be nothing they're make money off
S0198	yeah i need to get some water
S0192	no reason yeah i need water too
S0198	and a beer
S0192	and a beer shall i roll a cigarette then
S0198	do that it's friday night isn't it
S0192	where be the cigarettes
S0198	it's friday night at the movies
S0192	yeah this be our friday night study have a beer and a cigarette
S0198	don't go crazy
S0192	where be they
S0198	er i don't know darling you're the one that tobacco
S0192	ah i find it
S0198	you get it
S0192	yeah
S0198	lose things round the house you get it ah it's where i think it be
S0192	yeah it's here should put this there that should be alright shouldn't it
S0198	and we've get another spider it's the same one i'm concern
S0192	you're worry it's just go to be an explosion of spiders
S0198	i'm worry there's a nest somewhere go on go out of the house
S0192	just move him out with your hand just freak be you proper freak out then
S0198	no he be on the floor it's not very useful be it
S0192	should have cup him out
S0198	but you say just brush him out so i just go to brush him out
S0192	yeah but not quite like that
S0198	oh you leave the bedroom light on again
S0192	be that my fault do i do that last time
S0198	ah
S0192	where be you off to
S0198	to bedroom so we've get two more clear weeks and that's it it's not very long be it
S0192	no
S0198	it's come around quickly
S0192	obviously it's gonna the the thing be the course be gonna start i mean obviously it's gonna be busy from the word go
S0198	yeah
S0192	but it's gonna be less busy in the first six weeks than it be in the second six weeks
S0198	yeah
S0192	so we're still gonna have plenty of time for study that won't be a problem
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	what beer have we get then
S0198	grolsh grolsh
S0192	nice
S0198	i guess yep we be i mean there must be some people there's always get to be a couple of people hasn't there that go into these things completely unprepared
S0192	yeah always pretty much
S0198	there usually be isn't there
S0192	i reckon and hopefully there'll be other people that read the book
S0198	or people that aren't quite prepare
S0192	and they'll be like oh my god i don't understand this
S0198	erm i don't know at least i hope so but then who go into an ma in linguistics lightly
S0192	that's what i also think
S0192	i think that like oh you just get your s and what not
S0198	you wouldn't though would you
S0192	but like you're do an ma in apply linguistics
S0198	it's not the same as a celta or tefl course
S0192	mm maybe yeah
S0198	it's a bite more something to do you don't just stumble into a there's prerequisites before you even get that far so
S0192	yeah no you them you do however stumble into a celta so
S0198	yeah but not a delta unless an ma be comparable
S0192	mm
S0198	anyway i'm kinda hop that at least someone or they they're just people that have just get in i mean they accept us without any query
S0192	yeah
S0198	so i'm confident that's
S0192	we have fairly strong background
S0198	i mean how hard they can't make it too unrealistically hard surely otherwise nobody would get qualify in anything
S0192	to ma standard yeah i guess i don't really
S0198	it's just with all the read it's a bite overwhelm to know how expert we're mean to already be
S0192	erm i think we're certainly mean to recognise everything whether or not you have the ability to just use it randomly i don't know that i don't know
S0198	mm
S0192	i think they'll expect us to recognise it
S0198	yeah
S0192	certainly
S0198	that's okay
S0192	do you recognise pretty much everything
S0198	i mean i don't know no you still oh if you there's just so much that i'm try to i recognise it when i read it and i understand everything and i'm much more comfortable with a lot of things so yeah it's okay but i still can't when i'm put on the spot i still don't think i can give a good definition of stuff textbook definition it'll take me minute to think about it and think of a good answer perhaps
S0192	that's okay
S0198	i guess stuff just hasn't you know some normally with education you some core things be drum into you from quite a young age so even the basics be kinda cover but when it's something new it take a little while longer for that to get so drum into me
S0192	it be an entirely new topic for us but it's not cos we've be work in the field so
S0198	yeah that's true
S0192	so hopefully we're alright
S0198	and yeah the erm i'm do second language acquisition as well so
S0192	that's still within your field
S0198	still within the field
S0192	i mean like pidgins and creoles who the hell have study pidgins and creoles before now
S0198	well they've get people the er sit down there we've get they've get they reference people in my be it the dialectology book i be read or something else maybe it be that talk about or language variation there be some people that have go out to you know do their research in bolivia or do their research in peru although i don't know if they be study creoles actually i think they be study language variation no yeah sorry i'm confuse it just make me think
S0192	there's no creoles there i don't think i just mean like
S0198	that some people do go out and do that
S0192	people of our no of course people go out and do it but i mean just more like
S0198	no i mean the cigarette
S0192	peer i be a cigarette
S0198	ah yeah
S0192	for
S0198	what do you mean peer what do you mean peer
S0192	what do you mean this i don't really understand
S0198	no i just think actual with the drum only that's fine
S0192	okay
S0198	what do you mean by peer
S0192	if that's what you want then i'll i'll make that what do i mean by peer
S0198	peer
S0192	your people that you're you know study with
S0198	no i know who what peer mean i mean who what why why do you mention them
S0192	cos i be talk about i'm sure nobody else would have study pidgins and creoles before
S0198	oh right as in the people in your class
S0192	you know you're start talk about dialectology and people go to bolivia and stuff and i'm talk about know my peer
S0198	okay sorry yeah i'm sure you're right i'm sure not too many people have that's why especially see as it's a year three module
S0192	yeah
S0198	she do say in that discovery and book doesn't she that undergraduate students so i guess it's something that linguistic course definitely incorporate and it's something that some people on our course would have definitely study
S0192	and you should know
S0198	you should know yeah
S0192	yeah which i why i wonder what that actual course be gonna be like but it's still thirty credit so they can't make it that easy
S0198	no i mean it's not gonna be easy be it it might just be quite heavy i don't know if i should have do it
S0192	it might be difficult in the sense that it cover everything therefore i need to do a lot you know
S0198	yeah it's why i still like language variation like have you see the like week to week thing it's like so this week i'm mean to be an expert in dialectology but the follow week i need to be an expert in something else discourse analysis or something do you know what i mean i'm like what it's very vary i guess language variation be vary
S0192	yeah that's quite a bite topic to be cover
S0198	yeah i assume i mean it's like anything i suppose they just focus you in on certain key feature you pick one of those you have i have to do a when's i week oh no it's the twenty fifth of november i have to hand in a literature review and then in assessment week one which i think be the first week be that week of the two weeks
S0192	in january yeah
S0198	in january i have to hand in the actual er er i dunno essay mini dissertation whatever the literature review be on basically
S0192	yeah
S0198	so the first i guess the first eight weeks you're gear up to research this literature review of some area or the other and then you produce a bigger paper on it
S0192	yeah
S0198	but what whether i wonder how much guidance they give
S0192	i have no idea like presumably enough i hope
S0198	yeah
S0192	i don't know anything about i mean mine be gonna be completely different mine be gonna be exams so
S0198	yeah
S0192	i don't know if i'm gonna have much to do until
S0198	until yeah
S0192	apart from read you know what i mean read
S0198	that's nice
S0192	and well no i'll have to read and probably do example question and i'm like
S0198	yeah you do have to what's your seven hundred word
S0192	i do have two two seven hundred and fifty word analysis paper in each module
S0198	okay
S0192	so i'm gonna have something to hand in
S0198	in each of the three modules
S0192	i think so definitely in two of them
S0198	what about the core module we're both do what's the assessment for that it's just
S0192	mm i'm not sure actually grab me my computer
S0198	mm should get all this stuff handy on the erm on the handheld thing really that's what it's design for isn't it
S0192	what all our document and well just both of our
S0198	yeah module handbooks and all the textbooks
S0192	i'll just put both of our ma apply linguistics folders plus all the the textbooks
S0198	just for reference and make it more convenient
S0192	so what be i look for here i quite like that background
S0198	mm
S0192	i quite like the fact that it go in like er here you can see it around a folder
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	do you know what i mean which be a bite strange cos even if you make the folder smaller it's not actually the background behind it they've take a colour out of the background and like
S0198	oh yeah and just make it as a border
S0192	what be i look for
S0198	erm the language oh no the core module assessment
S0192	research languaging
S0198	yeah i'm pretty sure it must be some sort of
S0192	bet your folders aren't this neat
S0198	no i mean they're not bad they're not bad
S0192	do you emulate mine
S0198	mm
S0192	workload
S0198	so what be it why do it say wednesday do it say wednesday
S0192	this be old
S0198	oh
S0192	this be the we don't have the new one
S0198	oh yeah of course we don't
S0192	this be just the two thousand and thirteen one
S0198	i wonder if he's contactable now he's get his picture up cos he hasn't
S0192	he he might be do they have his email address on there
S0198	ah i don't know two piece of coursework due thirty first of october and the fifth of december
S0192	oh crap so that's due pretty much when and arrive
S0198	so that'll be set pretty early on that'll be something whatever that exercise be whatever that be ah they're both due before christmas
S0192	mm
S0198	each worth fifty percent
S0192	yeah
S0198	oh
S0192	it's only a fifteen credit module but still
S0198	yeah i don't imagine they'll be too big then
S0192	i don't know can't collaborate evaluation course evaluation questionnaire read week
S0198	i imagine i mean there must be enough time yeah i haven't i haven't look at this module enough yet
S0192	erm they've get quite a read list
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's all like research and stuff if you have a look in my one here these be the book that i've get from my book list i've do this now for them all so this be what i've read or get this be what i've get this be from the read list
S0198	yeah
S0192	this be what i need from the read list
S0198	so much read
S0192	yeah i know but we've already get that
S0198	yeah yeah i know
S0192	so you could just copy this you have exactly the same thing
S0198	yeah
S0192	i've already read those i'm read this one now and i've read that one
S0198	mm
S0192	and then we need and also i've make an additional list of book that i've read that could go in a bibliography
S0198	yeah of course anything that we've read basically so far
S0192	well not anything
S0198	no cos it's get to be relevant
S0192	pidgins and creoles have get no relevance to this but like all the general linguistics book that we've read they can definitely go up here
S0198	but even so even in the pidgins and creoles book if it talk about research and the practicalities of research you might find some of those book cross over
S0192	yeah i guess it hasn't i mean no it's not really take out figure out fee i don't know i just didn't put it in i guess but that's still quite a big
S0198	that's a start
S0192	yeah that's a start i've get those to read
S0198	yeah
S0192	i don't know if i even need to get some of those i mean i hope not
S0198	i'll get some well they
S0192	how many book be you really expect to read per module
S0198	i don't know what cover to cover not that not that many
S0198	i mean a few a few core book but i think a lot of the others you will be just reference chapters you're skim
S0192	dip in and out of
S0198	out of and my bibliography for my dissertation be quite you know it be a few page or well it's probably a page and so of book and then a page or so of journal article and then primary resources
S0192	i've never use journal article do i have to use them i can't use book
S0198	i think you need to include journal article as well i think they'll definitely expect you to do that
S0192	why
S0198	because it it's pardon me it's another source of information
S0192	but if those source be just publish in book you know there be book of effectively journals
S0198	they're not mm
S0192	some of these book be edit and it's effectively just journals
S0198	but some of the stuff doesn't make it into a book
S0192	so it's just surely if it's worth
S0198	it's a useful way of get er like a
S0192	be it just
S0198	a snippet of a counter argument and stuff like that
S0192	be all the journals you be use no i suppose they be quite old weren't they cos what's the point in go back
S0198	no some of them be new
S0192	but surely the whole idea of journals be just for new stuff that hasn't yet go into book cos i mean if you're look at
S0198	but other stuff hasn't go into book that maybe you might find cos people get that's how people publish isn't it through journal article someone could do quite a good piece of research that hasn't be reference in a book yet
S0192	surely it would be if it be a good piece of research then it would be put in a compendium
S0198	it might just be a bite particular or
S0192	be talk about in other people's
S0198	i think you need journal article i think it's a it's a
S0192	cool i don't i don't know anything about it
S0198	unexpected and
S0192	where do you get those from
S0198	they're in the they're in the library library and have a library of journals
S0192	so what you just look up a specific
S0198	they'll have a way
S0192	very very specific topic for a journal
S0198	they have a way of i mean you have to get you have to browse things and take snippets from bits and bob
S0192	yeah
S0198	and work it together into some sort of argument that benefit you basically
S0192	i keep i'm keep my book list now so at least at the end when i make whatever it be i've get to make i've get all the reference and everything here do
S0198	yeah
S0192	they reference slightly different to how i've be reference
S0198	oh do they
S0192	only very slightly just like bracket italics
S0198	yeah
S0192	a little bite it's
S0198	there be a rule about what you italic and what you don't
S0192	yeah yeah well i follow the rule the harvard one that's on the website
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	but it do tell you to
S0198	check with your course
S0192	check with your core lecture but that'd be annoy if i have to go and
S0198	i assume the way they're reference in er read list be the way you have to reference the text
S0192	ah surely not
S0198	be that not the same
S0192	i mean it's pretty similar but not exactly the same see i put bracket here and i just put w i wouldn't put lebov william i'd put lebov well you see here i put ray oh let's get one that's just one mayer comma c dot open bracket two thousand and two they don't she doesn't put the bracket she put a full stop and then i put that in italics cos they tell me to on the thing
S0198	ah i mean
S0192	otherwise it's the same it's in the same order it's just a bite of punctuation
S0198	mm as long as you've get the information there then
S0192	i mean i think it
S0198	it's something you might have to change i think the way you you're do it be the way that i do it for history
S0192	yeah surely as long as it's consistent
S0198	yeah
S0192	and correct and you know i'm consistent i'm not use different
S0198	different style or yeah
S0192	different ones then surely it'll be fine it'd be annoy to have to go and delete all the bracket out of all of these just because she doesn't want some bracket
S0198	mm
S0192	it just seem a bite silly doesn't it
S0198	oh we'll have to erm we can clarify immediately with the lecturers
S0192	yeah
S0198	and get their feedback i wanna go in and er with a good lot of question and things prepare yeah
S0192	yeah about that read that first week
S0198	yeah what it be
S0192	whatever's the topic be
S0198	the topic be
S0192	so what be the topic in this first week
S0198	well language variation be language variation that's the first week's topic and i'm like
S0192	so just general question
S0198	well what aspect of yeah of that it's a big topic what be i suppose to be ask i don't know i'll make some question then
S0192	yeah so like this first week be just lecture on research and linguistics
S0198	mm then
S0192	and then a week later be the seminar find and process literature i mean what be you mean to say about that
S0198	the different ways in which people find and process literature
S0192	linguistic evidence argumentation
S0198	see it's all prepare you for a linguistics review
S0192	data collection yeah i know this be just
S0198	it's blatantly what they're gonna do
S0192	this be just one of two modules prepare you for it
S0198	i mean that's nice cos i have to do a literature review for variation so the two combine
S0192	so you wanna be able to er
S0198	help me double up on something then
S0192	i'll be able to do that
S0198	but this be hold on a monday at in the afternoon
S0192	yeah four till six
S0198	yeah so i don't know when to need to sign up to the bloody language class
S0192	have you decide which ones
S0198	i don't know can i go well what would it be like go into beginners spanish
S0192	so this be your this be your timetable here erm
S0198	what do i start i don't want to be learn number
S0192	it will be pretty beginner
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's gonna be hello how be you what's your name
S0198	because we do distinguish more here between beginner er
S0192	elementary's elementary
S0198	yeah
S0192	i would say at the height of my spanish speak ability i be lower intermediate
S0198	mm
S0192	maybe push intermediate in certain areas like confidence
S0198	see i don't know if i'd get classify as a false beginner in the sense that you seemingly know a little bite but actually when you get me down to the nitty and gritty i'm not very good
S0192	i mean
S0198	it depend what beginner be though isn't it
S0192	you have quite a bite of vocabulary don't you
S0198	i'd like to yeah i think i'd recognise it whether or not i can produce it be different
S0192	so when be the time you be look here language variation
S0198	there be one on a tuesday that be six to eight er six six to eight thirty
S0192	so
S0198	oh no but i only finish at six no six thirty to eight they're all six they're all six thirty to eight
S0192	so we would not have dinner together at this time i don't know when you'd have dinner
S0198	just when i
S0192	get home at
S0198	yeah i'd eat different
S0192	nine o'clock
S0198	yeah i'd eat differently that day i would have a like a slightly bigger lunch and a slightly like i'd probably swap my lunch for my dinner that day
S0192	yeah
S0198	and then have something smaller in the even
S0192	that's fair
S0198	but that day we wouldn't see each other at all would we you go off to uni at nine and i'd come home at eight well later than eight don't really want to be cycle home at
S0192	no i don't think you should cycle on those days just don't think you should cycle on those days
S0198	get like it depend on the cycle route
S0192	i don't know if you should be cycle in winter if it's dark after you get back
S0198	i know i've get light and everything for my bike though i haven't get a front brake apparently which i need to ask my dad about before he come up i would like a brake i don't know if he mention it and i be just like whatever he just forget
S0192	yeah i mean not have a brake on your bike be a bite of a negative isn't it it's not the safest thing
S0198	mm
S0192	i've get a book give me on bicycle maintenance
S0198	oh really
S0192	might be able to do it ourselves but then we have to go buy a new brake cable and all the stuff that attach to it
S0198	i know well i'm not do
S0192	oh well the brake cable's there be it
S0198	no the there's no there's nothing there it's naked it be bare
S0192	there's nothing
S0198	no there's i don't think there's any cable i don't know how you i don't even know why you would have remove a brake cable
S0192	oh no i don't know
S0198	just stuff
S0192	just do whatever he want to do fix it up
S0198	have you message to dad about his birthday
S0192	yeah he say erm
S0198	do you say about go out
S0192	yeah he say he'd like it if i come up he say we could go out for a meal erm but then send me a picture of this propagator and i i kinda need to say to him like either or i don't know if i can afford to buy you a gift and come down so i guess which would you prefer
S0198	what's a propagator
S0192	erm it's a way do you want another cigarette
S0198	mm
S0192	no it's a way of propagate do you want to shut the door or
S0198	mm yeah
S0192	a way of propagate plant so that they erm
S0198	oh right of course
S0192	they grow but it's only about twenty five pound for the propagator which i would i would happily buy him
S0198	yeah
S0192	but if i go down and visit you're talk another twenty pound to get home plus i'll probably pay for the meal i guess
S0198	oh i dunno yeah if you're gonna go out for dinner
S0192	but i mean i'll be able to record so i can make some money from that
S0198	depend how much i mean yeah you would your dad's pretty good but i mean dinner could it depend if you're go to go out for dinner who pay for that
S0192	yeah i really don't know if it's that kind of price i guess we'll see
S0198	talk to your brother as well can't so he's go to spain this week
S0192	he's not gonna be there yeah
S0198	oh no that weekend no oh he's gonna be in uni by then
S0192	yeah he'll be in uni
S0198	oh so he's gonna be in kent that weekend
S0192	yep erm so get one one day of work sorry one week of work
S0198	oh right which he's use to go to spain
S0192	and then he use it to go to spain yeah
S0198	dear oh dear
S0192	mm
S0198	do you ask him how much he spend in thailand in the end in total
S0192	no i didn't
S0198	oh
S0192	i can work out roughly how much he spend
S0198	yeah more than we do i'm sure quite a lot more
S0192	erm yeah i would i mean i spend i live off a thousand pound for nine weeks
S0198	yeah
S0192	er
S0198	he spend that in the first couple didn't he
S0192	yeah he
S0198	well maybe not best three weeks
S0192	i reckon he spend close to two thousand pound maybe fifteen hundred maybe fifteen hundred pound
S0198	but yeah so but he's go when's he go to spain the thirteenth or
S0192	this sunday
S0198	not this sunday
S0192	mm
S0198	oh it's a couple of days
S0192	yeah
S0198	be they gonna stay in a guest house or be they be she be he stay with her family or
S0192	i have no idea
S0198	no she's a student isn't she
S0192	mm
S0198	to be a doctor or do i make that up no i make that up be it something like that or a nurse or no
S0192	i can't remember what she's a student for
S0198	oh no she's do she's study science or something be she
S0192	biology maybe something like that
S0198	yeah
S0192	ring a bell biology i really don't know
S0198	maybe it's just clash wherever she live
S0198	whereabouts in spain
S0192	erm kind of the north west just north of portugal not pay basque
S0198	okay
S0192	but erm near there
S0198	yeah
S0192	near basque country but further closer to portugal i believe there's no french influence
S0198	no i don't know if i read yeah it's funny isn't it basque country as be it french
S0192	influence um
S0198	influence but it's not be there then their
S0192	i believe their language be
S0198	what be they teach at school
S0192	what what language do they
S0198	what be their standardise language do we know
S0192	let's have a look shall we
S0198	be it spanish
S0192	i know that catalan be kind of it's spanish but it's get a lot more french word in it a lot more of a french mixture and i think that
S0198	the
S0192	paes basque might have be similar
S0198	well i know yeah cos that girl that be from the other couple we meet she be she just speak french
S0192	yeah
S0198	she didn't speak
S0192	so i think they speak like french or spanish or both or what erm paes basque it's an autonomous community let see where do it say where they speak the languages official languages basque and spanish
S0198	oh dear so what's basque when you break it down
S0192	basque as a language erm
S0198	be it autonomous or be it
S0192	it's speak in north eastern spain and south western france
S0198	oh
S0192	mm
S0198	so be it mm i do read something today that be say the reference like a poet in the thirteenth fourteenth century think it's the fourteenth century
S0192	mm
S0198	who note the difference between northern france and the dialect of northern and south france
S0192	yeah
S0198	they pronounce the oui differently or something that's thing
S0192	accord to this it's a language isolate
S0198	mm
S0192	it's the last remain descendant of the pre indo european languages of western europe
S0198	wow
S0192	mm
S0198	mm so be that what a language isolate be then
S0192	mm i guess that when
S0198	i guess an isolate language
S0192	yeah it's like a member of the family
S0198	but pre indo european i think
S0192	that put it back pretty far doesn't it
S0198	yeah
S0192	i think pre indo european be some proto language that they didn't really know demographic
S0198	mm go to basque country and do your linguistics stuff
S0192	yeah
S0198	might help know the language i assume you have do you have you have we you don't have to know the language of course you don't otherwise we'd never transcribe tribes and things but surely for somewhere like that you'd be expect to just know the language for something that accessible
S0192	it be say in the book that the first way that they erm figure out new languages like back in the day be with minimal pair
S0198	mm
S0192	so they make all the sound and then they replace the sound and give them the same word and say be this a word in your language basically it be a very long and laborious process of like hat be that a word and they'd go yes yeah hat and then you pat be that a word
S0198	a word yeah
S0192	and they'll say it so you keep and then if pat's a word be pap a word be pag a word
S0198	oh
S0192	be puck a word
S0198	just do it through minimal pair
S0192	yeah
S0198	once they find a er erm
S0192	it be to isolate a phony
S0198	a phony
S0192	yeah be to isolate a phony
S0198	yeah it work
S0192	and decide whether they have difference in mean or not
S0198	mm yeah
S0192	that must have be laborious
S0198	exist or don't exist
S0192	must be
S0198	yeah like i say when i be read today and i talk about i didn't really we've read about lot of the research that be do pre i don't know whatever nineteen something or other i don't know when the first tape recorder be be invent
S0192	no i don't know
S0198	nineteen forties thirties i don't know no we've have record since then
S0192	yeah well
S0198	but to be accessible to the public
S0192	yeah
S0198	anyway the fact that before then people be just write it and everything he say in an interview have to write down they probably have some sort of short form
S0192	what's a stenograph
S0198	i don't know sound crazy
S0192	that word have come into my head relate to what you're talk about
S0198	although initially the record equipment would have be incredibly heavy which they also talk about kind of trials and tribulations of the pre digital age linguistics researcher
S0192	ah a stenograph be a keyboard machine for reproduce letter in the shorthand system
S0198	oh right be that what you be think of
S0192	nothing to do with what you be say
S0198	where would that be use
S0192	for erm minutes i guess
S0198	would have be use yeah court
S0192	yeah
S0198	they have to take minutes and somebody's type away on it
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	i wonder if you get pay well for do that job
S0192	it's gotta be pretty tire
S0198	yeah i think it'd be
S0192	kinda bore
S0198	just program and be at that point you're think surely now there's a machine that do that do people still type in court you see it on film but
S0192	be so many job not just really repetitive
S0198	yeah
S0192	i know like okay let take some of the highest job out there some of the highest regard regard job be a doctor or be a lawyer
S0198	mm
S0192	be pretty highly regard do they vary that much you know once you're a doctor sit in a gp practice
S0198	yeah well a gp's different to
S0192	yeah but most doctor be in gps right
S0198	i wouldn't have think so well maybe yeah
S0192	i mean hospitals or gps
S0198	yeah i mean be i don't know if there be more i guess in er i don't know
S0192	i mean be it not okay you have different patients with different problems but you're not house you're not work on a team of some crazy like
S0198	no
S0192	you're just deal with the same stuff over and over and over and over again and like as a lawyer i'm sure a lot of their case be like very bore very normal and run of the mill
S0198	i imagine be a gp be terrible in some ways
S0192	mm
S0198	you'd have to
S0192	but like in our field i don't just mean teach but teach abroad
S0198	mm
S0192	it's change just from a middle school to a high school change countries change the type of people that you're teach their age their level it's there's a whole load of variation on top of the fact that you have different students each time you're not see one
S0198	mm the requirements of each
S0192	yep
S0198	each department be different let alone each institution
S0192	what you actually teach you could be teach english and then you could be teach how to teach english and then you could be teach linguistics
S0198	that's why it's kind of an entire field rather than just a job
S0192	mm
S0198	if that make sense
S0192	yeah it's a series of job
S0198	yeah
S0192	i guess you could argue that a doctor could become a surgeon could become a whatever
S0198	yeah there be of course there be that
S0192	but do they move that fluidly in between them i think you once you have to be fairly good in your field don't you you can't just be a surgeon for a couple of years and then be like no i wanna go work with children or something do you know what i mean
S0198	i mean they can do if they wanna be a especially if they be a surgeon for children
S0192	take quite a bite of train like you know be a paediatrician
S0198	mm
S0192	and she'll remain a paediatrician for quite a while because once you're a good paediatrician
S0198	there's no reason to well there be a reason to
S0192	i'm sure it'd be kind of difficult for her after five years of be a paediatrician to be like i wanna be a surgeon
S0198	mm
S0192	so that's quite a different set of skills really
S0198	oh right to be a surgeon
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	to like go from be a paediatrician
S0198	see i think a surgeon can go down
S0192	a paediatrician to an oncologist or something even just a different area
S0198	yeah
S0192	take quite a lot of specialise knowledge that i don't know if
S0198	i don't know if the
S0192	you could change i'm sure as a doctor you can change but i don't think it's that easy i don't think you could change become an oncologist and then a year later change again and become something else you'd be like no you just become an oncologist you need to spend two or three years just train in oncology
S0198	i think that's just the nature of that particular job though
S0192	yeah
S0198	isn't it have to be an expert in something before you can practise it
S0192	to be a lawyer i mean i never really understand this as a lawyer be you what's the opposite of a defendant
S0198	prosecutor
S0192	a prosecutor be you one or the other or be you both depend on the case
S0198	case yeah i feel from my from movies i think that you you be either famous for one or the other
S0192	yeah because you develop a reputation
S0198	but i don't but i think that's because
S0192	and it take different skills
S0198	yeah
S0192	but so do they change around very much i guess what i'm say be in our field
S0198	i think lawyers do do both
S0192	it's common to change around a lot of people don't like i'm sure will stay in the same kind of job for age but
S0198	yeah
S0192	and like even in school in england you don't get a middle school teacher that do the work work in a bite for a college and then work in a high school and work in an elementary school
S0198	no no only qualify for their particular area
S0192	and then work in a uni you know what i mean they become train in whereas in our field okay there be prerequisites for example the company will say you need
S0198	and it depend who
S0192	three years of children experience to work with children
S0198	yeah yeah it depend who you're who you're get in the job with as well
S0192	but once you've get
S0198	there's requisite get
S0192	those base of experience
S0198	if you go up but that's only because some somewhere else along the line like you have no experience have no experience in experience in that area
S0192	mm that's also the problem with our field be it's inundate with inexperienced people that there be job you can do that require very little experience under the teach english
S0198	there be well you're just go to you need to just work your way into institute where that doesn't happen
S0192	yeah
S0198	or work yourself into institute where that doesn't happen
S0192	you know they every institute i bet especially foreign not so much in western europe i don't think but further afield will hire last minute
S0192	they'll hire but something will happen someone'll drop out or somebody won't resign or something will happen and they'll just
S0198	there's always last minute position
S0192	and then they'll need to hire someone late and they'll just seem to go for whoever at that point
S0198	yeah
S0192	again i be quite surprise by unis in korea that you know be quite strict when they put out the formal advert but then they hire people like who be really young and have no experience whatsoever
S0198	yeah mind it's yeah convenient when necessary
S0192	whereas we have to have three years of experience really to be properly consider
S0198	consider yeah well they i don't know oh most people do that get hire
S0192	in korea yeah it be
S0198	when we be hire have quite a bite of experience
S0192	so do erm
S0198	's get her ma
S0192	yeah have her ma to support her i suppose
S0198	and all three of them do
S0192	all have their mas we get hire because we didn't have an ma but because we do have three years of korea experience
S0198	experience
S0192	in public school
S0198	yeah
S0192	erm and then like what's her face get hire just kinda last minute i reckon
S0198	who
S0198	i don't know they like her video
S0192	hire from abroad
S0198	but yeah i don't know
S0192	not last minute she wasn't last minute she be just i guess same as us she fill a quota
S0198	yeah
S0192	so just do it really quickly
S0198	would have be fine good as a conversation she like her be enough
S0192	yeah they could have erm have a more thorough hire process
S0192	though we may not have get through
S0198	mm
S0192	erm
S0198	have to remember that during that time though like apply for our position didn't get it and he be live in and have some of his friends actually make videos teach the students
S0192	that's true
S0198	and they didn't get in either
S0192	and they be from direct reference
S0198	so it probably just mean that they're go a bite on appearance also
S0192	the thing be who reference at that point
S0198	i don't know and yeah what from the
S0192	no one maybe maybe
S0198	maybe would have do and also er when the er those two er and whoever i know be and someone
S0192	oh yeah when they be there do they know him
S0198	they they may they be good they be friends with friends enough that that they vouch for so i'm sure she know she would have know
S0192	mm
S0198	i think they be friends but that would have be the only person i wonder how they be get along
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0198	i wonder if anyone's in our flats
S0192	delete them i delete a bunch of people whoop
S0198	delete
S0192	i delete
S0198	oh yeah i need to delete them i actually look at something today and
S0192	i keep i mean i just you know if anyone ask i cull like
S0198	yeah keep my number down
S0192	i've er i'll be honest i didn't think we be go to stay in contact so i mean what do you say
S0198	i've only ever re add someone once and we never saw her for the entire yeah
S0198	and that be and the only reason i re add her be cos i be certain we be gonna bump into her
S0192	no
S0198	and it's just like well whatever i don't care that much
S0192	no well you just say you know
S0198	i delete you and re add you
S0192	i mean for all they know you could be like i shut down my account for a while
S0198	i'm pretty sure i delete her again so
S0192	stop use facebook for a bite
S0198	yeah yeah exactly i be travel around for a year
S0192	but erm people use facebook differently don't they
S0198	yeah depend on the purpose
S0192	but the problem be when they see you post on like other people's things and they're like oh they click on you then
S0198	they be active
S0192	and they can't now look at your wall anymore it say you're not
S0198	my get facebook a couple of weeks ago and he's like he add people and he look on their wall be he doesn't there's no other he doesn't do anything he hasn't like do anything else on it i don't think he think it's really weird cos most people and be the same have an account that set up for him doesn't doesn't even carry his mobile phone on him most of the time
S0198	but yeah not very up to date my family
S0192	that's not necessarily a bad thing
S0198	my mum's the most the most tech savvy of them all how's that
S0192	and she and she couldn't even open my computer
S0198	she's alright on her mobile phone though
S0192	yeah
S0198	she know everything on that she show me something actually which be quite good
S0192	what have she show you
S0198	that when you type a message on my samsung iplayer cos she have a samsung phone whenever you go to write a message you have to press the arrow that point upwards i mean that's probably the same on all iphone things you press this arrow to get the upper case and when you hit it once it go back to lower case but if you wanna write something just in upper case you have to keep press this arrow for every letter but if you just tap it quickly twice it lock it in upper case
S0198	that be good i didn't realise it do that
S0192	why do you need to write in upper case
S0198	there be something i want to just keep in upper case i can't remember what like when it's like a initialism or
S0192	mm
S0198	an abbreviation or something
S0192	i find it crazy that we have two case
S0198	yeah
S0192	like there aren't many languages i can think of that
S0198	have an upper case and a lower case that just add a bite surely learners be just like why
S0192	it's a whole nother alphabet
S0198	mm
S0192	just for
S0198	they get it wrong my my university students they would start sentence with the wrong thing always
S0192	no no definitely yeah
S0198	like because or something and then write it in lower case
S0192	yeah
S0198	and then do some upper case thing somewhere it be quite bad actually
S0192	yeah as i say they always write insubordinate er subordinate clauses
S0198	yeah
S0192	and then yeah wooden
S0198	it's like they just i guess they're just translate much
S0192	the capitalisation be incorrect
S0198	the most relevant part which be possible
S0192	yeah but there's no harm correct them i correct it i'm pretty thorough with my correction
S0198	yeah you do need to correct them
S0192	and i know people be like er you know put put them off like you gotta and i'm not go to correct everything like but if i'm go around class and i see stuff that's wrong quite often they're not write very much it's just like a paragraph or something
S0198	mm
S0192	you know what i mean like
S0198	if that
S0192	couple of line i'll correct that because that's accuracy as far as i'm concern
S0198	mm
S0192	if it's fluency then i won't correct it so harsh
S0198	yeah
S0192	so i take that er correction to write also
S0198	yeah
S0192	but like i definitely correct their capitalisation and their commas and all that kind of stuff i teach punctuation a little bite
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah just simple stuff you know about erm conditional sentence if they're reverse not put a comma in it
S0198	a comma in yeah they seem to like know information like that
S0192	i teach them about clauses and once you're talk about clauses you have to talk about commas you can't not talk about punctuation
S0198	yeah punctuation yeah
S0192	erm they understand a question mark they don't have a problem with that
S0198	no just form question can be difficult
S0192	really difficult
S0198	yeah
S0192	have nobody teach them
S0198	w h movement
