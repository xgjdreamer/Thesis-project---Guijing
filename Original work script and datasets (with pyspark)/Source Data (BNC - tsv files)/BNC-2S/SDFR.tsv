S0417	can you come and sit down
S0416	that's glass do you guy put a glass overlay over it
S0417	that's just how it come
S0416	i don't remember see that before ever
S0417	these be all new aren't they do you remember when we first move in the tvs weren't here there be a different one
S0416	you didn't have a tv
S0417	no there be one big one but er get or maybe he just get that one and maybe the old one be now in the small room
S0416	mm maybe
S0417	cos this be the h this be the hd one
S0416	we use to have a tv over there and that be the computer over there well first off
S0417	there's nothing in this
S0416	first off the baby room be an office room with a computer that's where the computer be originally
S0417	i hat that room
S0416	hat it i think it be amaze
S0416	and then then we move it till we just
S0417	it be just like a teenage room
S0416	instead of a monitor we just have a big tv and then we have like a keyboard and a mouse and that's how we play our computer game
S0417	it be just one big computer thing
S0416	and and then eventually it move there and now it's just kind of like all shove into one compartment all the game stuff
S0417	yeah it's cos i refuse to have them elsewhere just some other areas that's don't have computers or xboxes cos it's just
S0416	it felt so much more multiplayer in that room cos you could fit other people's laptops on it so you could all play game together now you have to
S0417	yeah it be it be more like that there
S0416	but now now i don't even wanna play game on it
S0417	but then you can play game on like xbox here with a big sofa cos you didn't have that before do you you couldn't play xbox
S0416	pretty sure i do
S0417	where do you play where would you play xbox before
S0416	pretty sure it be here
S0417	but nothing really to sit on be there or be there
S0416	pretty yeah there be sofas here this be just a new sofa that's what i think
S0417	there be those two green ones
S0416	you get rid of the best sofa in the whole live room the black leather sofa
S0417	be there a black leather one
S0416	yeah it be the best mm
S0417	i didn't get rid of it 's make all the decisions
S0416	no idea why he do it then it it be it be because it always felt cold
S0417	probably cos it be horrible
S0416	it's not like you just go on go on it and it's just you know it's soft but so be the black leather sofa and it be just always cold and it's like you know when you flip over the you know you flip your pillow
S0417	yeah
S0416	to get the cold side
S0417	well i don't do that actually
S0416	be you serious
S0417	yeah i don't flip my pillow
S0416	really
S0417	i don't need cold things
S0416	well anyway when you flip your pillow it's just like a new pillow every time you go on it it's just cold and nice
S0417	well i like clean my pillow that that make me feel like it's nice and neat a nice a nice crisp new
S0416	be you serious you've never flip your pillow
S0417	erm well maybe i have ocassionally i i
S0416	that's like all i do and do you ever put your hand under the pillow so what what i do be when when my face get too hot and it's just all the pillow's just too hot i just flip it round and that side's colder because it it or fresher cos er my face hasn't be on it then my face be back on it and then i put my hand underneath so i'm like that and it's like cold
S0417	do you put your hand underneath your pillow then
S0416	course
S0417	so do i
S0416	not it's cold
S0417	i think it be cos it's warm
S0416	i don't i hate it be warm i don't know if it's just me but mum i actually do think i'm way warmer than most other people
S0417	yeah i think you be i think you're make a bite warmer than other people
S0416	because i i sweat way more than other people way more
S0417	yeah
S0416	erm i'm way more cold resistant like i can bear so much more cold than other people that's very true mum
S0417	yeah
S0416	like i can i can just be outside in at like nine o'clock on winter with not that many stuff and i'd like it it's just kind of cool
S0417	yeah
S0416	but a lot of people would be like you'd only see their face they'd be cover in all that stuff
S0417	yeah
S0416	and i just find that too hot so i'm always just like i always have one one or two legs out
S0417	one or two
S0417	just one leg out
S0416	one or two legs out just
S0417	why one or two be it like one leg
S0416	because like
S0417	i'll just do the right leg today just because my right leg feel like it
S0416	no it's because i always sleep on my side always
S0417	oh you mean out of your bed
S0416	yeah i always sleep
S0417	i be think like walk round town
S0416	oh no no no
S0416	like i always sleep on my side and it's a bite weird to always do that
S0417	you don't have to show me i can imagine it okay sit down
S0416	so it's not it's better just like that
S0416	cos cos then your leg be colder it's not under all the cover
S0417	and it's
S0416	and i also have my other arm out and then my other arm under the pillow cos i just bake at night
S0417	but then you have be erm complain it be too cold weren't you but then go round in t shirt and short
S0416	that's just because that's just because oh my goodness it's so warm down here and then when you're warm such a just catastrophic difference
S0417	catastrophic
S0416	for like oh my goodness you've never
S0417	oh my goodness
S0416	i don't think you've ever do this where you've be in your your room or something we're in where it's just like so warm and all that and then you just go into my room and you just get pneumonia
S0416	it's like when i'm in my room all the time it's fine
S0417	be it like a fridge you open the door and it's like
S0416	it's it it it's fine when
S0417	you can you hear the antarctic
S0416	it's fine when i get use to it cos then it's just it's just my room then when i go out i'm like oh it's pretty warm in here
S0417	you should you should just hang a coat and gloves and everything and a hat outside and put it on before you open the door and then go in
S0416	you always get angry at me for wear my black hoody
S0417	i don't get i don't er i think angry be a bite strong
S0416	well yeah not angry you're just like that's horrid you know i get two you know i get two of those exact same black hoodies for my birthday
S0417	yeah but you put them on with nothing put it on with nothing underneath
S0416	what's wrong with that what's wrong
S0417	because it's
S0416	so that that part you just wanna see just that much of a t shirt you just wanna see that much of a t shirt that much
S0417	it's more like i don't think you should be wear like sweat or erm or knit things just over bare skin i think it's i think it make them a bite smelly
S0416	i think it make me even warmer and it feel nice you've get crazy terminology
S0417	strong strong
S0416	get crazy terminology
S0417	yeah they're not my favourite really they they don't look that my personal opinion
S0416	hoodies you hate hoodies i cannot go out
S0417	no i like hoodies i just don't like the those blue ones that you've get
S0416	i ain't get blue ones i get black ones
S0417	black ones navy
S0416	no they're black black
S0417	okay okay black
S0416	i want it to be er winter again so i can wear my hoodie
S0416	i i definitely prefer cold weather cos then you can actually really get warm and that feel really nice and also i don't find it that cold outside i really like the breeze and stuff sometimes it be really cold though i really like it cos you can get all cosy you can't get cosy here you have to jump in a fridge but even the fridge be warm
S0417	you can get cosy here
S0416	i can't get cosy
S0417	probably cos there's no carpet downstairs
S0416	no it's just it's summer everything's warm
S0417	oh
S0416	i can't get cosy
S0417	you get cosy in the even don't you
S0416	no everything's too warm that's why i like the winter cos you can get all cosy and that feeling's the best and also when you're really hot and you're outside there's no way to cool down you're just all hot and
S0417	yeah but we go swim
S0416	you're all hot and sticky and
S0417	that yeah but swimming's a nice way to cool down
