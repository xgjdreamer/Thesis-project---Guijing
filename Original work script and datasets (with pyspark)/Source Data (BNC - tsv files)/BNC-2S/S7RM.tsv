S0115	so the the pie have um quite a lot of spice in it
S0037	mhm
S0115	uh flavour like the uh garlic the carrot onion like the flavour have some extract in them
S0037	taste quite peppery
S0115	yeah they it have like black pepper extract they also have thyme and cleave um and like the concentrate you know vegetables um
S0037	yeah
S0115	and yeast extract go in there that's a bite like marmite innit
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	and with tomato paste so they do this be typical i think that you do with it be these sort of things they do have a lot of different flavour uh at the same time
S0037	yeah i'm just get me scissor
S0115	like i mean more than you'd you'd always think of put in uh
S0037	have you have any thoughts about what we should buy your mam for her birthday
S0115	um
S0037	d'you think she's like some jewellery or something or
S0115	uh i wasn't hold on i be i be gonna ask her wasn't i and then um i imagine it would probably have something to do with the garden or a plant or some sort um
S0037	or you not plan on spend yeah yeah although we've get her those the past two time i mean i do like a bite of plant action but i just wonder if she might want something more
S0115	yeah more
S0037	should her cook her a cake or something if she's come round
S0115	oh yeah yeah
S0037	with seventy candle
S0115	um yeah
S0037	well i can just get one of those number sevens cos i've get a number zero from when you be thirty
S0115	um
S0037	you know that's in there somewhere i'm sure i saw it the other day
S0115	it sound sound like a great idea
S0037	ah she'd like that wouldn't she she like a bite fuss everyone like a bite fuss well i like a bite fuss
S0115	something um
S0037	doesn't do she
S0115	i think so i mean
S0037	or would she be embarrass
S0115	well maybe a bite but you know you you always get
S0037	what's that for
S0115	i be gonna grill this
S0037	ah put it in the grill pan in the this one
S0115	oh the the the um um alright yeah yeah cool
S0115	uh yeah so i dunno if um what she'd want but i think it would be uh she doesn't normally ask for much do she
S0037	she normally ask for some sock from mark and spencer's
S0115	yeah she do
S0037	i feel like we should probably buy something slightly better if it's like her seventieth and people ask her ooh what do you get from your son and if she's like um some sock
S0115	well i think that
S0037	i know she's a woman of simple mean
S0115	in the um in traditionally um i've ask her and she's not ask for like spectacular things so um that's why you know
S0037	well that's why i be think maybe don't ask her and just buy her
S0115	you know she's she wouldn't be expect
S0037	but then again she might not like it
S0115	um yeah i wouldn't uh i would definitely wanna ask her first uh to make sure cos otherwise it you know could get could make her really well if you be do it as a surprise well what would you you know what would you get
S0037	well she's funny cos she doesn't really like the sort of things that i would like
S0115	yeah that's like uh one of the main reason why
S0037	why what
S0115	just have to sort of
S0037	ask her
S0115	wouldn't wanna surprise her cos we don't really like the same things she do
S0037	like or similar things that i would buy for like or me mam i would kind of know what i would buy them
S0115	yeah
S0037	i wouldn't really know what to buy
S0115	yeah
S0037	your mam i quite like any sort of smellies and
S0115	stuff like stuff from from boot's
S0037	vanity items
S0115	a lot of stuff from yeah you're you're quite a vain person aren't you
S0037	well i'm not really but i do like cosmetics quite a lot i don't say i'm i wouldn't say i'm vain
S0115	no no neither would i
S0037	you're mean
S0115	no i be say it's just a joke i mean
S0037	i like i like quite like nice bath things and like um hair products and stuff i like that sort of thing and and cosmetics
S0115	yeah sort of like boot's things yeah like similar to what
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh and probably
S0037	and i also like sweets and i also like booze
S0115	yes
S0037	so i think a bottle of wine box of sweets that you can't go far wrong with that for me uh flower be always nice you should get your mam some flower cos she'd really appreciate that
S0115	yeast extract
S0037	lovely d'you not think
S0115	eh
S0037	she would really appreciate some flower
S0115	uh yeah i think she like flower yeah um and plant she like like a lot of plant
S0037	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah could we could go but where we could get her something that would last like why don't we buy have she get have she get herbs and stuff i mean i know we give her some cuttings but do they all survive
S0115	a tree or something like that um
S0037	cos we could buy her like um a sage bush or a what about like you know have you see those little bay tree do she cook like that though would she use it
S0115	yeah probably a bay tree yeah
S0037	they're about twenty quid aren't they
S0115	yeah
S0037	that's a great present i'd like one of them
S0115	yeah
S0037	maybe they've if they've get them on two for one i'd be over the moon
S0037	wonder if they have
S0115	quote of the day
S0037	eh
S0115	quote of the day
S0037	if they've get them on two for one i'll be over the moon no it's true i would be
S0115	yeah
S0037	in fact i'm tempt to just look on homebase dot com and see if they have that would be really good
S0115	oh yeah so these these things take age to uh
S0037	that's why i be think we should put them in i be tell some people at work about my knit hang bag things and they say they think it be a nice idea not you're mental be what which be what you say
S0115	sorry do i say when do i i didn't say that
S0037	that be a paraphrase but yeah
S0115	what when be this the oh the the plant thing
S0037	i saw them this morning and they like they make us smile so i think that they should definitely stay just for the craziness of them
S0115	oh yeah no i i mean i never i never say that they didn't look good uh i be just think that it be more than what be necessary
S0037	yeah but i'm it's just like free time isn't it
S0115	yeah
