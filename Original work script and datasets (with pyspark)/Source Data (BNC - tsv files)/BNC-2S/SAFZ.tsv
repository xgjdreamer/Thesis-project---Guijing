S0405	ah okay let's discuss eh let's discuss our
S0402	life
S0405	yeah no no okay eh other teachers
S0402	you what do you want to be as a child
S0405	a barrister i mean
S0402	no no no no i mean as a child not like as a you weren't bear a four year old
S0405	erm i i i be bear and i ah
S0402	fine okay watch this right when you be the youngest you know okay obviously football it's football alright obviously
S0405	i didn't care yeah football
S0405	i didn't i want to be eh i didn't want to be i didn't want to be an astronaut or a firefighter or a
S0402	i do no not firefighter i didn't want to be anything where i have to probably die
S0405	yeah death wasn't something fun
S0402	i i and i and back then i didn't realise that there be so many fail apollo missions
S0405	yeah
S0402	before they actually get to space
S0405	ah no not apollo erm do you understand what death be at a young age
S0402	no cos no one tell you what death be
S0405	i know exactly
S0402	no one tell you you're go to die in like
S0405	we don't have as much of a regard for death as do you ever oh a swear word
S0402	yeah you know you know that everyone grow up at some point yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	i'm at that phase where i'm not grow up yet i still want to be something like an astronaut or something
S0405	yeah yeah but to become an astronaut that would require
S0402	physics degree yeah
S0405	maybe a physics degree but do you think work from an early age to as as in commit to an a career from after eighteen or after twenty one
S0402	well erm
S0405	i don't i don't know
S0402	neil neil armstrong right
S0405	yeah neil armstrong
S0402	erm he at no point do he want to be a a an astronaut
S0405	oh yeah
S0402	he fly erm air bomb missions in a in a the korean war
S0405	do he
S0402	yeah he
S0405	oh shit
S0402	yeah he he he have like a crap load of successful er missions in korean war
S0405	yeah
S0402	and after that cos he be so great
S0405	yeah
S0402	erm that you know the nasa recruit him because he be the best pilot they could find
S0405	damn so he he he he but do he have a physics degree before he become a a pilot
S0402	no he he be part of the air force
S0405	damn
S0402	i guess now you do because if you there's there's a finite amount of people that go like they know how to get people to space now
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0402	maybe not cos their rocket blow up
S0405	they still don't i know that i'm not
S0402	no no no that be a private company that be a private company
S0405	be it really oh okay
S0402	yeah nasa know nasa know how to get people to space
S0405	i understand nasa have close their space project haven't they their shuttle project
S0402	yeah yeah that's why they need private company
S0405	that's why oh alright investment
S0402	and private company have re use
S0405	that's what we should be invest in like er ah i wish i have the statistics on erm on america's use of er er military erm as in the amount they spend on military every year it's like eight time more than than china and like russia combine
S0402	yeah like you realise they yeah but their military invent duct tape velcro
S0405	do it
S0402	they do
S0405	we invent the jet we give them the jet after world war two apparently
S0402	no no no what happen be there be a guy that invent the jet
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	and erm
S0405	he be british
S0402	yeah he be british but er and er this start at like thirty nine right
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	and and he he campaign for years and years and years try to get his idea pick up by the military
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	it wouldn't have it it wasn't until like after the the er second world war that that he he go basically go bankrupt
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	and then they decide to take his idea
S0405	yeah i see well the whole world steal for for everyone's own please
S0402	yeah yeah it's like erm yeah in in king james' time isn't it monopolies be always people that invent stuff
S0405	yeah
S0402	i guess that i for me i find that kind of fair
S0402	because if you you be the first person
S0405	it's like a patent
S0402	yeah no no it's not like a patent because you can you can like patent say you invent the hoover tomorrow yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	and the hoover hadn't be invent you invent the hoover you can't patent the hoover
S0405	yeah
S0402	you can patent the the things that you make the hoover out of and the systems you use
S0405	oh right right
S0402	but you can't patent the hoover that mean that if if if i come tomorrow or the day after and i make a a
S0405	right yeah
S0402	a vacuum
S0405	yeah
S0402	cleaner and but it use different part
S0405	yeah
S0402	it's not it doesn't break the patent
S0405	right right right
S0402	so so
S0405	so it that's an issue with the patent though like
S0402	no it's not well because you
S0405	that they're not specific enough or they're not
S0402	there's two things there's erm what one people believe that if you invent something you've work hard at it and you should be able to be reward in it
S0405	yeah yeah that's good yeah
S0402	so so if you invent the computer say as alan turing do in eh world war two
S0405	yeah
S0402	he you should have ah undisputed right to every single computer
S0405	yeah okay
S0402	and then there's the flip side of that that people say that that's anti capitalistic whereas that you have a then have a situation where you have a monopoly
S0405	yeah
S0402	where erm whereby one person control the complete market share
S0405	right right
S0405	yeah it's it's it's it's eh so it's like but that i think the issue with patent be that they they hinder the progress of anything creative
S0402	no patent don't monopolies do
S0405	or no no no
S0402	that's that's that's that be their original argument against monopolies because
S0405	yeah monopolies yeah okay monopolies exist since seventeen hundreds in
S0402	i mean arguably they still do because
S0405	yeah
S0402	you have like oil and gas monopolies
S0405	right right yeah yeah yeah that that
S0402	in the end big six six energy company
S0405	yeah
S0402	it's weird how none of their price ever drop and they all move it up at the same time
S0405	yeah i know i know that's just competition with ally though
S0402	yeah no but that be a monopoly though because
S0405	control yeah
S0402	by by definition if you're control market that make it monopoly
S0405	yeah yeah i see that
S0402	so that's the i i don't know personally i think that people aren't reward enough for invent things and that's why we don't have enough cos cos you could invent something tomorrow and
S0405	yeah
S0402	you would you could get like you would make no money out of it
S0405	yeah
S0402	and i think need to be protect more
S0405	well okay
S0402	but on the flip side people that erm eh seek to monopolise a market that can't it's it's like like everything it's nearly impossible to strike up a perfect balance
S0405	yeah but just because you invent something
S0402	yeah
S0405	erm just because eh what be i say erm just because you're invent erm yeah just because you manage to invent something you you say they should be protect more
S0402	yeah
S0405	doesn't that theoretically mean that in like fifty years or a hundred years or there's go to be a point where it's become eh a a a less likely or a smaller chance that you're go to create something then isn't that i mean isn't that unfair why don't we reward people for
S0402	no but i know that that be why there be invention because if you you can invent something today
S0405	yeah
S0402	with a risk of become a billionaire or you you can create an amaze product and lose get get absolutely nothing
S0405	yeah
S0402	whereas if you be erm certain
S0405	yeah
S0402	that you would not get nothing out of invent something
S0405	yeah
S0402	more people would you know quit their day job and and pursue you know try to make something you know unbelievable
S0405	and we shouldn't be that though
S0402	must be
S0405	i mean because because innovation
S0402	cos every right everything
S0405	and inventions be so they're so scarce now even in the past they be so scarce
S0402	exactly that's the issue they're so scarce we're not inspire enough people to invent
S0405	ah oh no no no no no no i think i think we're over inspire i'm say scarce i'm say scarce as in it's hard to create something that be original and can be market
S0402	well i mean you you get to realise that the universe you know ever increase you know it's a world of infinite possibilities
S0405	yeah
S0402	i could create you know a new sandwich tomorrow
S0405	yeah
S0402	and that would be invention but the point be that you could invent ah ah an infinite amount of things
S0405	yeah
S0402	but a lot of them don't have applications
S0405	no
S0402	and the the second thing which be an issue you know we're basically talk about be they they're they're not monetarily sustainable
S0405	yeah but you don't want to be encourage people all these people to quit their day job for a cause that be very it's still very unlikely
S0402	right you get alright look at the unemployment yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	if more people quit their job and go into you're get more people do the steve job steve wozniak deal or a bill gate
S0405	that be so rare that's mostly with like innovative speakers
S0402	that's so rare because not not that many people be try it
S0405	no some people how many
S0402	you you realise that there's a certain probability something's go to happen
S0405	yeah
S0402	the more time you you test that
S0405	yeah
S0402	the more like the more result you're likely to have
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	steve job and steve wozniak yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	they set up a business in their garage
S0405	yeah
S0402	who do that now who set up a business in their garage
S0405	people try people how many stories do we hear of of inventors or people who spend their entire live try to follow their dream whether that's invention whether that's quit your job to to do something extraordinary
S0402	yeah
S0405	and yet they can't make money out of it they get no success it's impossible
S0402	that's the issue they don't make money out of it we need to help them make financially sustainable
S0405	like fee them money but at the same time we still need people motivate to work i think people be get lazier
S0402	yeah but the easiest way to motivate someone to work be to work for themselves because at the end of the day you're not work for a company
S0405	yeah
S0402	the profit you make isn't go into the pocket of the person that own the company if you if you know that the money that you make now be the wage you will take away for the year
S0405	yeah
S0402	you you're go to obviously work hard aren't you
S0405	how hard be yeah
S0402	because it doesn't matter if the the business start you're you're the business company you work for they make a a loss this year or they don't make money at all
S0405	yeah
S0402	because at the end of the day you're still get pay
S0405	but they're go to be make a loss as in how hard be it to be freelance or or or or self employ and make money
S0402	it be hard we we need to help them because
S0405	yeah
S0402	at the end of the day we we have a you you look at the compute sector or the game sector
S0405	yeah
S0402	erm the movie sector we be miles behind the like of america and china
S0405	yeah
S0402	eh and even india right
S0405	yeah
S0402	we be miles behind because people don't
S0405	but look what that's result in
S0402	you know that's not result in anything good because at the end of the day you look at it a mountain of things that erm america and china will invent yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	they're push for why be all the big like mobile why do we not have a big mobile phone make company because no one because we we we've slip into the erm
S0405	we
S0402	the the way of think that well why why let why try and work hard and invent something else make our own company
S0405	yeah
S0402	it doesn't matter that cos china be go to undercut us and we have america over there we have india with a a population what's the point in try
S0405	yeah i mean but you don't want to you still want to look at the way china have increase in its economic growth because of the
S0402	that's the mentality as much as anything else
S0405	i think it's as much to do with the work ethic as it be have to do with encourage people to make inventions and the
S0402	yeah i know but the the point be that they invest in their people
S0405	yeah by force them to work by control them by give them hard hours
S0402	i mean yeah i know but you think about the amount of freedom they have now compare to fifty years ago yeah that's
S0405	yeah okay
S0402	obviously they're still it's not perfect you still have a a communist regime and you can't talk out against it
S0405	yeah
S0402	you have the hong kong umbrella riot
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	but but the point be there's they there's be you've see a stark amount of investment from erm you know communist regime
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	industrialise you know agriculture
S0405	yeah
S0402	there there's now no more of that as compare to erm we have erm now er a a market where we can start sell people stuff to consumers we can we can you know
S0405	yeah
S0402	work that way and that's what they try and do they're invest that way that's why their er the
S0405	yeah we do
S0402	erm i don't one of the most one of the most er popular phone right now be the oneplus one yeah
S0405	mate yeah
S0402	chinese company they invent it they make it cheap
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0402	it's all about try to now change from like industry to try and make stuff that the consumer
S0405	innovative yeah yeah but they do i mean they do that well i guess japan do it in a similar way but they don't have
S0402	well no the reason japan
S0405	they're they're just innovative in everything they do
S0402	i know but their their issue be that they don't spend enough money
S0405	yeah okay but they're they're not in as debt as bloody britain or america
S0402	like that's why they they no well china be in a massive amount of debt
S0405	or china be
S0402	china be in a
S0405	china's grow though china be sustainable
S0402	yeah i know that's the difference the china's debt in be investment
S0405	yeah
S0402	they they unlike us we we we money into the nhs or er we we spend it on benefit china all of china's debt
S0405	yeah
S0402	have be through erm invest in their er in their country and in their people in their new innovation
S0405	we the nhs be invest in our people maybe not fundamentally or ideologically but healthcare be better erm er school education that can be argue but we've get we've get a sustainable system
S0402	education be a the the point be these be necessary cost right
S0405	yeah
S0402	every country will have these cost right
S0405	yeah
S0402	unless you're america and you try and do an obamacare system
S0405	yeah obamacare
S0402	okay but everything will have a set amount of cost what china have do well be they've minimise the amount of cost
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	that you spend on education and healthcare and they've get the the best that they can possibly get even though they have a billion people
S0405	yeah
S0402	and it must be hard to healthcare bill budget be go to be pretty high in that
S0405	yeah
S0402	they've manage to do that whilst also with the surplus money they've have
S0405	yeah
S0402	they've invest it
S0405	they have and they've do that well yeah
S0402	i mean if you think about britain have britain invest they've sell all their gold
S0405	yeah
S0402	they they waste the eh in the eighties they waste the north sea oil
S0405	yeah
S0402	they they have a they have a a windfall of money with north sea oil they take the scottish scottish oil yeah they have no oil now basically
S0405	yeah
S0402	and then a massive windfall of millions and they do not invest it correctly
S0405	so so you think it's it it should be the government that hold on let's end this conversation erm yeah you think it should be you you you think it should be the government that take the responsibility
S0402	yeah by
S0405	for yeah yeah that's true alright i get to go yeah
