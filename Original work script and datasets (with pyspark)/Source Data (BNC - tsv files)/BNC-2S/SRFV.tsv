S0253	yeah
S0274	so he i think he maybe have be
S0253	you find a lot of people who have work in the military

S0253	have you have you never read bravo two zero
S0274	no be it good
S0253	i mean i it be from his book that when i be when i be kid and i be really into like military stuff you know
S0274	yeah
S0253	my dad like when i when i be when i be a bite older my dad give it to me
S0274	that be when your dad look at you and be like that's my boy
S0253	yeah yeah that be my lad before i become a
S0274	yeah
S0253	a a wuss yeah before i become a literary wuss erm you know i think i read a lot of book to make my dad like you know proud
S0253	like not proud but like you know you wanna
S0274	associate with yeah
S0253	like something to talk about isn't it really as all all little boys do
S0274	yeah
S0253	but erm so he he use to give me these really like complex spy novels with like sort of you know an erotic
S0253	an erotic part in it halfway through like some fella come
S0274	she
S0253	yeah like some fella come home on leave halfway through and you're like
S0253	okay he give me this one and it be about that big it be like a proper doorstop it be call storm intrepid and it be a really complicate story about erm how how satellite be use for spy across the world and just oh my god i remember try to read it as a kid about twelve and i be just like
S0274	it be what you didn't realise it be actually an instruction manual
S0253	yeah what be the one i be read but erm
S0274	we be talk about actually erm i dunno if notice i be pilgrim that come out come out a few i read that i've just
S0253	which one
S0274	i be pilgrim
S0253	no
S0274	terry hay i've just finish read it and that be a spy one but it's a murder mystery as well as a er like counterterrorism
S0253	right
S0274	well and the interlink sort of erm what do you call it erm coincidentally
S0253	wow
S0274	erm but it at first i be like where's this go and after some chapters i think why have he put so much detail into this one main part
S0253	yeah
S0274	but then it kind of work and then at the end when i've read his like but later on he say erm i understand that this be quite a weighty novel and people may seem to think that this be not really appropriate but he say if you're into your what be it if you're into your hard booze and your quick liquor and stuff then it's maybe not for you but if you don't mind have a bite of a journey then this and i think
S0253	yeah
S0274	do you know what to be fair cos it's like you follow erm it start in this scene in this erm erm east side apartments
S0253	yeah
S0274	just after nine eleven literally i think like a week after or something and there's a woman erm in a bathtub and she's be mutilate like you can't recognise her because her face have be strip so
S0253	right
S0274	and all like her fingertips have go so there's no way of er fying her
S0253	break bad style
S0274	basically and
S0274	you've get his guy who's like you've get this la cop but then you've get this new york cop and everything and you've get this guy who's kind of no one's mention his name but he's the one they're
S0253	right
S0274	and then it turn out he's a former like cia sort of like top government sort of
S0253	be it a be it involve conspiracy and all that stuff
S0274	no no no no erm and then basically he get call back into the service because he's a guy who they call the saracen
S0253	the the saracen
S0274	yeah he be mujahideen fighter erm in afghanistan
S0253	yeah
S0274	who's manage to erm make smallpox make a strand of it that erm can't be vaccinate against
S0253	lovely
S0274	and so it's er yeah it do sound a bite erm but it's really good
S0253	i'm not sure this be a book i'd like to pick up right now
S0253	my anxieties about oh er these things be pretty pretty high at the moment
S0274	and it what i think what's quite good be that he do kind of say it in the start which set it for the rest of the book cos you think come on that's a bite unlikely that you'd find that but he do kind of make a point of it he talk about some of his former case and he say well that time be pure luck but
S0253	right
S0274	that i would have be able to crack any and you think oh right but at the end i don't know who terry be i recognise their name but erm a lot of the people who contribute who he thank be like screenwriters and stuff like that
S0253	wow
S0274	so i dunno what his
S0253	maybe he's an actor or
S0274	yeah
S0253	a director or something like that
S0274	maybe give a different name on it i don't know
S0253	that's cool
S0274	yeah
S0253	yeah
S0274	but it be it be there be like nine hundred page
S0274	i know
S0253	do you read it
S0274	yeah yeah
S0253	bloody hell
S0274	but it's cos of the work i'm do and i've get the time i think whilst i've get the time
S0253	i think sometimes i think i'd like that if i could er i mean obviously you'd you'd i'd be bore out of my mind but i like whenever whenever you just hit the train
S0274	yeah
S0253	like from mine i use to i use to get a bite annoy at the staff cos half the time they wouldn't be at the window and when they be there like they'd be there on like candy crush saga on their phone
S0253	or they'd be read but then i think like well i'd be do the same if if
S0274	yeah
S0253	cos the way their day be it's like people wouldn't show up every fifteen minutes
S0274	yeah
S0253	so you've get that just gap in your day where there's nothing to do and you know station doesn't get that dirty
S0253	so there's nothing to do so they just sit and read all day but they must they must get through like
S0274	yeah well obviously like i'm on to my i'm on to like my fifth to sixth book now so it's like mid september erm
S0253	bloody hell
S0274	erm
S0253	you wouldn't
S0274	i've notice my speed's be go up the rate at which i read
S0253	you get you become a better reader i think
S0274	yeah and i've notice already in term of like erm even over in the space of a month i mean i know i i think i forget that like i notice a difference i've study for the ma for two years i've just come on to read read journals er article book that
S0253	yeah
S0274	be associate with the social workers i be out of work when i be do that and i know it's my vocabulary just like sort of i dunno not so much
S0253	it be really good
S0274	but really structure
S0274	er not so much now if we be talk but you know when i be write and i'd look back and sort of go jesus do i write that
S0253	yeah
S0274	erm but even like a month read like a lot have mean the word that i wouldn't normally use i would go like and also i'm have a better er guess at the mean of word
S0253	yeah
S0274	even though i've i've never really properly read it and then cos ask me she be say to me why what's stoic and in that vince flynn he use that book that word a lot and from know it obviously my brain's sort of it and go
S0253	yeah
S0274	well what's i i say oh it be someone who doesn't really show their emotions
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	and blah blah blah and then she guess yeah yeah i suppose and then she look at and yeah it do kind of so it be
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	that be quite nice cos and i think be able to stick the tendencies that we all have i think what's nice with a book be you start something and you finish it and you complete it see what i mean and it's almost like a mini sort of
S0253	i i think i have the opposite problem i'm incapable of finish anything
S0274	right
S0253	like a really struggle to finish book i start them i love i what i like be start things i would i'm although i'm i'm not sure what this say about me on a psychological level but
S0253	i'm very good at start things and i start with a lot of momentum and then i burn myself out so
S0274	mm
S0253	i give it er at the start of a book i will get really into it and get obsess with it and then when i get i don't like to finish things cos i like to i hate the idea that i'm enjoy something so much and it's
S0274	yeah
S0253	gonna be finish
S0274	yeah
S0253	you know some book where you're sad when you've finish them
S0274	yeah
S0253	and often i find that if i've really enjoy a book i'll read it i could read ninety percent of it in the space of a a week or something like that
S0274	mm
S0253	and then it'll take me another three weeks to finish fifteen page because i just
S0274	yeah
S0253	won't pick it up cos i don't i don't want i know it's really strange unless unless some some book you have to finish
S0274	yeah
S0253	some book you have to know like
S0274	well obviously with these you've get to to cos you're kind of like well
S0253	the
S0274	what's gonna yeah
S0253	but er a lot of the book i read there's no real there's no real resolution at the end of it often some of them be but some of them end quite i don't know sort of there's always like a kind of point at the end but it's not quite
S0274	yeah
S0253	it's not quite what you want so i guess that's why like i've kind of i've get in the habit and i think since university as well because really oddly when when you study when you study literature you don't have to look at the whole book the the point of it be not the whole novel as a as a whole
S0274	yeah
S0253	it's it's
S0274	you take out a chapters at
S0253	you well half of the time you take it out of bloody context and like you're try to read it you're try to read section of it obviously you might read the whole book you you often you're just read you're take a section of a book and then try to make a you know make assumptions base on that section of the book without really relate it to the rest of the novel
S0274	yeah
S0253	some so obviously some some some literary study be about the whole novel but very often it's you you're take a sentence and you you know you're you're focus on what that sentence mean in its own context and stuff so i think that's why like i'm not a good reader because i'm too
S0274	you're almost a bite like a journalist in a sense i suppose then like an editor isn't it just go and er
S0253	that's what i tell people yeah
S0253	when they ask me what i do
S0274	but it's that's really the same skills isn't it like
S0253	it's
S0274	that's why i've always find it funny when they have like journalism degrees you'd be like but i'm sure the best journalists be not go to uni to do journalism they've be er work in politics or they've work in an area
S0253	yeah
S0274	link to something or other
S0253	the the the big i mean that that's the funny thing about about about journalism as a career i don't i don't i don't claim to know much about it but i think what you should like the people who be hire by like big newspapers and get i mean get give a chance to write have life experience because they've it's cos they've live like in
S0274	yeah
S0253	war zone or they've
S0274	yeah
S0253	or they've travel or they've study people out of their own interest or they're they're environmentalists and but
S0274	yeah
S0253	they haven't they've never study journalism in their life they just it there's there's something
S0274	so they've get natural passion and flair and knowledge to be able to write like you say like a decent article that's obviously
S0253	yeah
S0274	will be get or like or like something you'd do you'd be like proofread it from someone and
S0253	yeah
S0274	fault you know to make it more sort of concise but yeah
S0253	it's like i mean it i mean obviously like i think a lot of people really love him i i've read a few of his book like you know hunter s thompson who write like fear and loathe in las vegas and things like that
S0274	see i watch that film with you guy but
S0253	no don't
S0274	i
S0253	don't don't don't base hunter s thompson on
S0274	i just i
S0253	the johnny depp movie
S0274	i i think because i've never be in the drug scene or
S0253	into drug
S0274	or anything like to me it's it's very erm i've not actually just just i read the book before but erm
S0253	it's unrelatable
S0274	yeah that's it
S0253	yeah
S0274	if anything it i'm quite like
S0253	i just don't particularly like that film
S0274	uhu
S0253	it's and it's it's not and i think i think cos i when i when we live with like them lot i i kind of get put off it because of you know like they'd watch it like ten time a week and be like ha ha drug but
S0274	yeah i think
S0253	the the point be be that he he be a bite of a you know he he do he do take some strange some strange drug hunter s thompson and but he's also a very good he be also a very you know a very important writer at the
S0274	yeah
S0253	time and things like that and
S0274	cos you never think of that as a well in term of it's cos you maybe think of it be i know he's do a lot of shit film in the past couple of years erm
S0253	ben stiller
S0274	johnny depp
S0253	johnny depp
S0274	yeah erm but you know he cos you cos you be talk about fear and loathe in las las vegas
S0253	yeah
S0274	erm it but the rum diary
S0253	mm
S0274	and i know i've get a bite of a thing but do you know when i watch that nothing really happen but i love it
S0253	but that that's hunter s thompson as well
S0274	be it
S0253	no it's not the rum who's the rum diaries by yeah it be erm i might have to google it on my phone
S0274	yeah cos erm i dunno i i think i watch about two thirds of it and i think i love this cos it be just
S0253	rum diary
S0274	it it make me think of cos obviously i love rum you know
S0253	obviously i love rum
S0274	but i dunno it kind of make me think thing that could so easily be you
S0253	me
S0274	as in sorry myself
S0274	no that could be so you could so easily become a cos i like drink everything like
S0253	pretty
S0274	cos
S0253	pretty
S0274	it's
S0253	pretty
S0274	a pattern isn't it
S0253	it's it's either hunter s thompson or someone equally mess up pretty sure yeah pretty sure it's hunter s thompson
S0274	yeah i know i wasn't on google
S0253	i'm just gonna google the rum diaries be he also write er one call the tax you might like that give that a go
S0274	yeah the shark tax
S0253	the shark tax or something give that one a go i know what you mean though about about it like that that kind of i guess people kind of go like i think i think a lot of let's see erm the rum diary hunter s thompson yeah there's a novel in and you be be i've never see the rum diary be it good
S0274	what's he call his name again
S0253	hunter s thompson
S0274	hunter s thompson do you know what's really nice though that when i feel like i've find something you can't beat
S0253	in read
S0274	yeah
S0253	it's one of life's great pleasures
S0274	it be
S0253	i'm i'm tell
S0274	it's
S0253	i've never finish anything myself
S0274	cos i mean i dunno it's like cos my dad be a big reader and he but he love he would read charles dickens novels constantly
S0253	really
S0274	yeah probably
S0253	it's it's
S0274	do you know what i mean you know
S0253	they say they say say he's the best charles dickens don't they
S0274	yeah
S0253	apparently it's just the best
S0274	he he use to and his cos his favourite bond film be erm well his favourite film be scrooge with the black and white one
S0253	not quite
S0274	that's
S0253	not scrooged with bill murray
S0274	no
S0274	not that one er
S0253	yeah i know the
S0274	so i suppose for me now that he's he's go
S0253	yeah
S0274	but he's not i suppose read in a sense be kind of it's a it's a connection in a way i find cos he well he love read
S0253	yeah
S0274	erm i dunno if it's quite er cos we're only human and we like get compliment don't we but there's a new girl start in work
S0253	yeah
S0274	and she's from like quite she go to yeah i know go to go to private school you know academy
S0253	it's a good school that
S0274	she's like very well speak and you know she's a lovely person you know
S0253	how old be she
S0274	erm she's she's twenty four
S0253	what's her name
S0274	she's she live in she live by the erm
S0274	yeah very much i'd say i'm sure somewhere in your circle would have know them like you know
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	her father and she's be work with me for about the past month and in initially it's like like the job the joke we have isn't it when we be in uni be that people see me oh right yeah he live in area that's all there be
S0253	he's a divvy
S0274	he yes he be and the other night we be sit there cos she as on a on a and er she just sort of say to me cos she be ask me and like we be talk about things and i be like oh yeah and i be talk about yourself and i say oh yeah i'm finally gonna meet the major for tomorrow it's he do erm literature and then he want to get into publish and all this and i be talk about like and where we use to go and you know bloody hell you it's quite surprise you're like pretty culture aren't you
S0274	and i be like never think of myself as that and i go well i like i thank yeah i be just
S0253	yeah
S0274	that be quite nice of her to say that
S0253	i think i have the opposite problem i think people always assume i'm really culture and i'm really not i'm like i'm really like
S0253	uncultured
S0253	i'm not at all like i think
S0274	if you think about the debate we use to have at you be the only person and i use to love it when we be live in uni and be obviously do politics and you be do like they be so intertwine and we'd talk about things
S0253	oh yes
S0274	we'd talk about things for age do you know what mean so it's
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	erm do you know what i mean so i use to love that
S0253	i dunno i think i i i think i think study stuff like maybe a bite more culture i guess but i mean i guess i guess it's a relative term you know it's not like you can can be culture or not culture but
S0274	i think
S0253	i think i think people often presume that i'm like i'm i think one i think it's like that i think people presume that i'm really really really into like fiction i'm not i like i like read but i don't really like
S0274	yeah
S0253	read like whole novels that
S0274	yeah
S0253	erm

S0274	patch of it yeah
S0253	patch of novels

S0274	no it's erm no yeah so it's but then like you're say there but it's funny isn't it because when someone say culture and they think like for example this person she's like a lovely person but it's all very much kind of like she she wouldn't look out a place in and i be joke with her like you know what i mean but to me that's not culture that's like to me that's kind of play the scene you know it's it's
S0253	yeah
S0274	play a part whereas to me it's culture be about have social awareness
S0253	yeah
S0274	of know yourself like i know that i go to the gym cos i like to exercise and keep healthy but also cos i'm body conscious and also because
S0253	yeah
S0274	it give me confidence and then but it's i think it's be aware of you know we psychoanalyse everyone but an understand of why the the way people be i suppose that's
S0253	yeah
S0274	that's social work but if you do it properly you come away with you go you understand why people the motives rather than you know it's it's a fix state of
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	like you now oh well they're gonna be set well why be they do that
S0253	yeah
S0274	what what influence someone and what what you know what i mean
S0253	yeah
S0274	so then i think once you have an understand that you better understand people
S0253	yeah
S0274	and you know what i mean so it's er
S0253	yeah i think so
S0274	yeah
S0253	i think i think i i i i use to think there's like there's a problem between people think that culture be about class as in like
S0274	and know when all the like
S0253	like
S0274	diwali holiday be and stuff like
S0274	do you know what i mean
S0253	no but you well you say like you know your dad be from
S0274	yeah
S0253	and he be very well read and it's weird how like you'd think as those things as like somehow oppose
S0274	classic isn't it
S0253	like
S0274	big screen tv on a work class
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	and isn't yeah
S0253	but you kind of you sort of people often think of like be like be well read and somehow somehow a preserve like be middle
S0274	yeah
S0253	class but it's not at all like
S0274	no
S0253	and i mean i use to i use to love when i work in waterstones what i really like about it be generally it be like you could you could tell a a lot of the customers that use to come in be like just guy like your dad like work class fellas who maybe later on in life have just find this love of read
S0274	yeah
S0253	and it be
S0274	yeah
S0253	brilliant because like they you could just tell some people i i've see i'd see customers come in one day pick up a book and then about three days later they'd be back
S0274	yeah
S0253	and they'd be back and then
S0274	get the next
S0253	they'd they'd be there every week
S0274	one of the author yeah
S0253	they would they be hook and and then they well these guy who like erm maybe you get maybe they be bore like on in life or
S0274	yeah
S0253	i don't know what it be but you know there be people who maybe have never really pick up a book before and and all of a sudden cos they maybe though oh it's you know it's not
S0274	it's for those clever yeah
S0253	it yeah it's not for me
S0274	yeah
S0253	and then you realise you can understand anything if you you you know if you sit and read something and you're interest in it you can you can get it and that be what be really nice about that job sometimes be like you know and if you want to read about biology tomorrow you could read about biology and no one can stop you
S0274	yeah
S0253	from have a read
S0274	it do you know what it's a there's a film on that you've get netflix haven't you
S0253	be it call be it call good will hunt
S0274	no
S0253	me and watch it the other night have never see it
S0274	have she not
S0253	it blow her mind
S0274	be that what make ben affleck then and it's
S0253	yeah
S0274	matt damon be it
S0253	they get an oscar for that didn't they
S0274	yeah cos they write it didn't they
S0253	yeah
S0274	erm
S0253	but isn't it rumour that like there's that joke on family guy but isn't it rumour that it be like
S0274	it be just one of them
S0253	one it be all matt damon
S0274	oh right yeah
S0253	and ben affleck's just chill
S0274	yeah somehow i can see that but
S0253	yeah
S0274	yeah erm and then that would be judge erm
S0253	cos his wicked smart
S0274	erm the film detachment with erm brody what's his name er be it adrien brody
S0253	adam or adrien there's two cos the
S0274	the one off the pianist
S0253	adrien brody
S0274	adrien brody
S0253	adam brody be the guy from the oc
S0253	and stuff like that
S0274	oh it's er oh it do my head in erm it's it's again it's a film that doesn't really have any major end it's
S0253	what's it call the film
S0274	detachment
S0253	detachment
S0274	it's about a he's a supply teacher in america a secondary school
S0253	yeah
S0274	and basically as the film go on he hat his life he's like have a midlife crisis but he's kind of he's very intelligent and very aware very well read and kind of like a guy who you talk to for hours can make other people feel happy and he show kindness to other people but he can't find that happiness himself
S0253	right
S0274	erm and it's so and they're sort of show the stress of an inner city school that's you know obviously in quite a deprive area
S0253	yeah
S0274	the teachers be get tell this that and the other and they put this they're very passionate and it's a brilliant film it's very quite sad
S0253	sound good that
S0274	but it's it's on netflix and i'd definitely watch it
S0253	detachment
S0274	there's me go mate there's this film with teachers and i love it because i think i mean you need that like i mean i know i'm a very deep person you know that from erm from the years
S0253	yeah
S0274	but i think you do need sometimes someone who isn't quite well no not to say she's not deep
S0253	a simpleton
S0253	you need to find yourself a no i know what you mean
S0274	but
S0253	i mean it's a
S0274	but i would i i would sit there for hours and you know you know talk about something so like important to me or what like
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	current affair like kind of that time when i be say to you i would have read a read a bite of postmodernism and stuff and you're like just and i be like the world's just it's it's fuck up and it's like what and i remember one time you almost say to me what be it erm we be talk in and we be have a few drink and i think someone in work have be do my head in
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	and you just say to me you can't expect to have that same respect off other people
S0253	yeah
S0274	and it's funny how a simple sentence like that can make you go yeah it's kind of like and again
S0253	kind of like a skinny white buddha
S0253	essentially
S0274	that's it yeah so er but that's what i love off because you know she's things don't bother her in the same way it do me
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	and i think that go well and i think what again it's it's something i think like with the master's erm cos you know for my erm whatchamacallit my dissertation i get a sixty seven
S0253	that's really good
S0274	i be er three percent off a first and it be pure but do you know what though you know the most best part i do all that by myself i do those fifteen thousand word i'd never get my lecturer to look over it or anything or take and
S0253	that's brilliant
S0274	most of the people there they be pretty much write an interest
S0253	do do you do you feel like you do you feel like you think you really come on then from your degree
S0274	yeah
S0253	to your master's
S0274	definitely my degree i be still deal with my dad
S0253	yeah
S0274	definitely i be deal with the fact that you know my mum and relationship with my mum and everything you know
S0253	housemates didn't make it easy for you do
S0274	well no mate if i
S0253	i think i think you should i think if you hadn't live with us you would have do much better
S0274	no it's erm i think it amaze me er more show to the person i be
S0253	yeah
S0274	but also it's er it's be a deliberate path to go and where i be now and then go and do social work and yeah i i'm probably the happiest i be now
S0253	good
S0274	it i be i think i be great then i be you know i would never wish those time away i love them time but
S0253	yeah
S0274	it's great in the context you know what i mean whereas now i'm quite i quite like the fact that you know and yourself and you know everyone's go off do their own thing and
S0253	you're settle
S0274	that's it yeah and just it's it's it's like it's nice
S0253	you spend you spend like i always i feel like i dunno i think i'm still i'm i'm not quite there yet i'm still i'm i'm i'm alright i'm happy with what i'm happy but
S0274	mm
S0253	i feel like i'm still try to like adjust everything and make everything you know like proper whereas i felt like like er i think my favourite time would probably be like maybe the couple of years after university
S0274	yeah
S0253	cos uni be so hard for me cos i just you know
S0274	yeah
S0253	lose my lose my marble so
S0274	i always have it envisage i remember the er i think it be like twelve can of red bull
S0274	and you just wouldn't open the door
S0253	yeah
S0274	and you'd be like no me i'm it's great because i get to know you and be like yeah okay just he need to be leave sorry
S0253	well i'm still that way i'm still like
S0274	yeah
S0253	i'm still obsessive but just in different ways now but like erm so for me like after uni it be like have no responsibility and not really worry too much about you know a degree and once you not worry too much about my future and that be the best time for me cos i just have no burden whatsoever and i'm the problem for me with teach have be that like because like because i'm so like you know really try and perfect everything and make everything perfect
S0274	yeah
S0253	so i think since i've be teach i've i've find that like be really struggle because you can't perfect it
S0274	yeah
S0253	nothing nothing's ever perfect especially in like language teach it's like you never you you you you could be the best teacher in the world all the will i the world and you know you never you you're never gonna get anyone fluent immediately
S0274	yeah
S0253	if you know what i mean and i find that really hard to not perfect something instantly so like i feel like i dunno i i feel like i need to do something where i i just for a while i'm not say i don't wanna go back to teach but i wanna find that kind of like contentment and be like
S0274	yeah
S0253	you know i'm just do my job and i'm go home and my job's my job and i can do it well and then i can go home and i'm not worry too much
S0274	yeah
S0253	about it all the time and i guess that's work
S0274	i'm sure that's what they call drive isn't it that ultimately make you a good teacher and
S0253	it's like i be i like two of the like you know it's weird isn't it like two weeks before you know we finish teach there be two of the best lessons i've ever have today just you know it be you know it be difficult like new students in the class and stuff but it just everything go really well and tomorrow like you just like you just have an absolute breakdown halfway through the class not me personally but
S0274	yeah
S0253	everyone just stop do stuff and it's weird how it go but i think like a lot of my friends be like you at the moment they they're at that point where they're just you know they're get they're engage and they they're get house and stuff and they're not they're not frantically scramble round try to like you know do do do new stuff all the time and they're just kind of
S0274	yeah
S0253	a bite
S0274	and i think there's a there's a point there where like like what be i watch the other day erm that book i wanna get for erm ask my mum for christmas it's a
S0253	which one
S0274	it's a photography book by don mccullin i think it be very famous war like photographer erm
S0253	i think i think i might have see it
S0274	it's on netflix i watch it and the whole time i be just mesmerise the whole time
S0253	what what don mccullin's on netflix
S0274	yeah
S0253	as what like a lecturer or something or
S0274	no he's he's a a well run for the
S0253	be this a documentary
S0274	yeah yeah
S0253	and it's on netflix
S0274	yeah a a photographer and but he never like to be call he say i don't wanna be call a war photographer because that somehow suggest that i condone it he say that i see myself as humanitarian
S0253	right
S0274	this guy be just so i'm gonna use the word but just so culture and just like it but the great thing be he's even from a really really rough part of london
S0253	right
S0274	back like i think twenties or thirties like thirties maybe he literally like he'll be talk away like very like you know sort of academical or something and it's like cos then you know the next time i be round the corner and
S0253	and how's your father
S0274	he's talk about like you know the place i grow up in where you have to fight where you have to get out of there and he say you know he's casually talk about the time he be take a picture of like all the work men go
S0253	yeah
S0274	into one factory and it's
S0253	have have a knees up
S0274	and this guy be like give him grief so he he have to you know i have to sort him out do you know what i mean then back to it but it's just brilliant cos it be kinda like cross you know what i mean cultural mix
S0253	there's something there's something so like like authentic about people like i dunno what it be but it's like it's like people like that i mean who's who have you ever hear of a book you'd like this book it's call the glass arena
S0274	no
S0253	i think it's call a glass arena john try to think
S0274	the internet
S0253	write it down
S0274	do you know what i'll go on to my amazon
S0274	it's offline and talk about be
S0253	yeah
S0274	and i've get an amazon app but it be useful for that
S0253	you'll be the death of the high street
S0253	erm and it's it's i think it's john maybe john healy or something erm
S0274	so what's it call the glass
S0253	the glass or be it the grass arena the glass or grass
S0274	the glass castle
S0253	no that's it so definitely the something arena maybe the grass arena
S0274	the grass arena
S0253	i think so
S0274	oh the grass arena by john healy
S0253	john healy yeah
S0274	oh it's an autobiography
S0253	well more or less but it's about it's about his experience of be homeless and it be
S0274	oh wow
S0253	it i i read it but cos it's on
S0274	oh i find that now i find i find this now after do my dissertation imagine do a little extract from an autobiography
S0253	should have speak to me then
S0274	sorry go on i'll just save that to my wish list
S0253	erm but in you know what i mean it's like er you kind of i remember read it i read like a profile on on john healy john healy and because he's because he's a person who have like this real live experience and he's you know be homeless he's you know his life suffer you know he's he suffer through his life and things like that and now he have this like well he might have pass away but the last thing i read about him he erm he have like a picture of his little studio space and he have this tiny little space in london where he write from and you just get there's something about people like that that you know there's good writers and then there's kind of there's people who you really buy into like their experience and things like that and you can't fake that it's like
S0274	i'm gonna have to yeah i'm gonna have to check that one out man
S0253	yeah it's like it's like you be say there about like about these like these photojournalists and things like that
S0274	yes
S0253	there's people who do it you know and because they've be give the chance they've be gift the chance
S0274	yeah
S0253	to do something
S0274	whereas this be his like it would be like your this be a general passion
S0253	yeah you know he'd have to he must have have to overcome a lot to to to become you know
S0274	well be he he say things like as a kid you know like his dad use to let him draw on the kitchen kitchen wall and he use to like to draw and paint
S0253	yeah
S0274	a man of that era allow his son to do that do you know what i mean
S0253	yeah
S0274	he be like probably work how many ten hours a day twelve hours a day in a factory
S0253	yeah
S0274	do you know what i mean it's obviously straight away you're think that far to have the talent and then recognise it but
S0253	yeah
S0274	yeah no that's it and the whole time i be just mesmerise by this documentary
S0253	but like
S0274	it's literally from the sixties he's be in every erm conflict
S0253	wow
S0274	erm apart from when er take overtake the time
S0253	right
S0274	be it the time and andrew be it andrew neil he become the editor
S0253	right
S0274	er and basically he didn't want they didn't want the time to be like an actual he say you know a like a real paper and cos it use to be like it just you know
S0253	they want it more tabloid and stuff
S0274	yeah they want the sponsor so he be kind of shift out and he say he kind of have to break away from that and do like he'd do like wildlife book and stuff like that you know photography
S0253	yeah
S0274	erm but he he he be really deep because he be talk like he'd get back flash flash back cos he's witness people get execute do you know what i mean and he be like that so it's it's erm and he'd you know he say he'd lose his wife and you know that be his fault but but he say he need to do it
S0253	yeah
S0274	he he need to show the world what be happen he say he couldn't he can't explain it to anyone but and it be just wow
S0253	and and those those people just people like that and stories like that really be be you know you just they like really inspire people
S0274	yeah
S0253	it i mean it it's it's like it's like these it's like these journalists who you know be be still in syria like be still knock about in syria like and i be i there's a really it be erm it be in i be in 's the other week and have gq magazine and i be there be a there be a four page spread about about how how sort of what's the word you think of like you know kidnap journalists and western journalists like
S0274	yeah
S0253	and things like that you think of it as this kind of high trade it's not it's really bland and it's very much like we'll give you this money for this journalist or or the american we'll give you a bite more
S0274	yeah
S0253	and they just trade them round only occasionally will they will someone buy them up and then use them as some kind of political thing
S0274	mm
S0253	half the time it's just to make money and they just generate revenue off them
S0274	yeah
S0253	and they they go up in price and down in price very very banal i guess you could say erm so they but you just you know when you've get to you you know the stuff that's come out of like you know like from syria and iraq and things like that you've gotta you know you've gotta have some you you know you need something different haven't you to to
S0274	totally
S0253	go in to to to really want to show the world that erm to be the person
S0274	to know that the nine percent chance you be gonna get snatch if you're not work for the bbc or something
S0253	or shoot
S0274	but then there be that guy wasn't there work for the bbc who get take i can't remember his name and that guy henning guy again you'd look at him and wouldn't think would you but he have this raw passion that he need to go in and help
S0253	it's the need to help people
S0274	yeah
S0253	and and and everything be you know everyone say to him like you know the the british you know the british embassy say well they they can't stop you from travel they're not allow to stop them
S0274	yeah
S0253	but they can say they have warn that say
S0274	yeah
S0253	we strongly recommend you don't go and you know with his his his need to help other people
S0274	yeah
S0253	you know and that's the difference like that that's this be what some people just amaze people and and
S0274	definitely
S0253	er you know it's you don't have to do you don't have to do grand things to be a great person but when you realise people you just bloody hell like
S0274	mm
S0253	they should you know erm you know and and that's the you you learn a lot about yourself cos i honestly think to myself like you know
S0274	it make you look at yourself doesn't it
S0253	oh absolutely can and you couldn't pay me
S0274	no no i
S0253	you couldn't pay me to well and that's the thing about these journalists half of them aren't half of them of them didn't get pay they're not even do it for any money or any kind of financial incentive some of them some of them will make a bite they
S0274	from a if they sell a picture or something yeah
S0253	yeah picture and and and things like that and you can make a good bite of money on it but they're salaried they're not
S0274	no
S0253	and the half the time the paper that they work for they or the they they don't care about them they're not all they're worry about be get the get the story and get the picture
S0274	mm
S0253	it's really sad but
S0274	it it but
S0253	what compel people
S0274	you're totally right the the
S0253	amaze
S0274	people that you hear of like that you just think and the thing be when people do things not for the erm acknowledgement they just do it
S0253	yeah
S0274	cos they they really feel that's
S0253	there's erm i can't remember there's a there's like a a proverb about that isn't it that's just like do something that like if you do something without be acknowledge i can't remember what it be i think you might know it
S0274	no i don't be irish
S0253	yeah be be an irish erm yeah it's
S0274	mm
S0253	but sometimes sometimes i wish that like i have a bite more a bite more grit maybe and
S0274	yeah that's where i be say before like you be say like you know this age like your friends like you're say and all that but that's where i start go er there be there be a side of me though that go i i need to go and make a story i need to go and make something
S0253	but you but you will be help people though
S0274	yeah and then i think i realise like when we go travel around europe i love it but i realise i be like a home bird
S0253	yeah
S0274	that's when i think i realise
S0253	yeah i'd be the bravest man in the world if there be a clean toilet around
S0253	as long as there be a nice bathroom
S0274	except with
S0253	if i could take one with me
S0253	if i could have a nice bathroom me i wouldn't mind go anywhere
S0274	but you know what halfway through i i think i'm sure you probably do i be totally accustom to those god awful
S0274	those er portakabin if anything i've er
S0253	room
S0274	if if i didn't smell that mm revolt er chemical smell i be like er i'm not go in there

S0274	about that yeah
S0253	because you've get a little pro forma and
S0274	yeah
S0253	you half the time you've get applications save and you just send them off to like
S0274	yeah
S0253	and it's it's mad
S0274	and it's
S0253	obviously you've gotta tailor them and you can't just be like
S0274	i work in an ice cream factory
S0253	i've get experience of yeah yeah
S0253	work in a
S0274	yeah
S0253	cinema i know a lot about psychology
S0274	but yeah that's someone be tell me about that but i dunno i kind of be in like i want a job i'm hop to get an interview with this one i apply for i dunno i'm i've kind of find myself even though i don't really like do this job anymore i'm a little bite content at the moment cos it's be so for two years of like be in uni like near you know like four days a week then work and have like one day off
S0253	yeah
S0274	i quite i dunno i'm quite like just go and have a book to read or go to the gym and then nothing you know worry too much about
S0253	i think i think that i think that's a nice place to be in and i wouldn't i wouldn't go away from that immediately
S0274	mm
S0253	cos that's what i feel like now like i feel i've be do you know i've be in i've be in the same place for three years
S0274	mm
S0253	you know and i've get very much you know i'm say i'm say i be say or moan before say it's it's it's stressful it's it's not that stressful you know and it's quite a nice job
S0274	mm
S0253	like every day i get to speak to people from all over the world and you know it's a very reward job it's really nice and it's it's it's lovely but
S0274	mm
S0253	so i'm kind of part of me think oh god like you know if if can i could i ever like like i just work on my own all the time it's just me
S0274	yeah
S0253	sometimes i go i go a lot of days without see another member of staff i go in and sign in i do the class i go home just
S0274	yeah
S0253	yeah it's very yeah so part of me kind of think like could i really work like a big organisation again like
S0274	yeah true
S0253	have i have i still get my teamworking skills or will i be just like
S0253	just a low
S0274	whilst use your initiative
S0253	yeah well it's these these these be all good word for my cv
S0253	erm you know and i think i i kind of you know i i be so comfortable for a long time it part of me feel a bite nervous about you know do something else because i've do this but if you you you know you don't you don't have to change you you can just stay the same but if you wanna change then you've get you've gotta make a leap haven't you
S0274	it's always yeah you're right and there's always that but you it the annoy thing be you know when you've do it and you go why have i be sit my arse like when i i do that application for the job and i be like that wasn't hard okay yeah you have to think for a day or two
S0253	yeah
S0274	and get someone to look over it but really like you know what i mean but i think the problem for me at the moment i dunno for you but if you be work a a lot of hours like at a certain and you kind of when you do have that time you just kind of like it's almost like you're recharge and
S0253	yeah
S0274	so
S0253	that's on friends they always talk about the fear you know on
S0274	mm
S0253	that one with rachel where like she's the it's like chandler tell her to quit her job i think and it's like you won't you won't apply for another job unless you get the fear
S0274	yeah that's it yeah
S0253	and she quit her job and then she's skint
S0274	yeah
S0253	and it's erm but you know i mean i could i could you know i could probably get another job in another school and i could carry on teach i think for years but and i wouldn't mind do that but i just feel a bite i feel a bite stick really i feel a bite there's no there's no the only way i could the only way i could progress would be if you do like it's call a delta a diploma erm and that make but then that's it i mean obviously you can go on and do like you once once you've get a delta it's it's a three month it's a three month qualification no less but it's it take a long time to do erm and then but once you've get that that's the the limit really
S0274	yeah
S0253	and that's not a bad thing cos it's a really tough qualification but you you're kind of say to yourself that er like i can the only career i could do be either be a teacher or to to be a manager of a language school that that's kind of what you can do and you know it's the there's it's good money and stuff like that and it's a good job but you know i just kind of i just feel a bite like
S0274	you've do that now yeah
S0253	yeah and not only that like i know a lot of managers or language school and you know a lot of my friends be quite quite you know they're do er sort of on the border of that kind of job and it's just you know financially you have to be if you wanna be financially stable you know you've get to really find a good place and a
S0274	mm
S0253	really good school and i dunno i just i think i'm gonna try something else for a bite and then
S0274	yeah
S0253	go back to it
S0274	i think it's good though that you know you're think of do the publish master's i think it's brilliant
S0253	yeah i mean it's only obviously that's help with you know it but that that's kind of that's kind of help with like kind of say you know she if we have to go to edinburgh then but i'll still do it even if if if she doesn't get the the job in edinburgh i'll still
S0274	would you do it here
S0253	well it's it's like a three grand might be worth
S0274	oh god yeah yeah
S0253	might be worth might be worth move to edinburgh wouldn't it
S0274	definitely will mm
S0253	cos cos i'm gonna have to pay for it myself so
S0274	mm
S0253	i might as well erm you know take a bite of a risk
S0274	fuck hell everyone's move away
S0253	we might not be this be the thing be like er i'm really i'm really wary of like talk to people about this stuff cos
S0274	i know it's
S0253	cos if it doesn't come good then you're just like a bite of a divvy
S0274	it's almost like it's a it's it's an idea that you don't quite you you don't want people to take bits of it away isn't it it's your it's i know what you mean yeah
S0253	it it's like it keep you sane your little dream doesn't it
S0274	yeah
S0253	your little visions of how life's gonna be like
S0274	that's it i mean cos for me the reason i wanna get a job in because once you've be in there for a few years then you can work anywhere you know what i mean
S0253	right
S0274	and you can go and work in an organisation and stuff like that whereas i kind of feel it would just be pointless me work for two years to then go and do an organisation job that you wouldn't necessarily need that qualification it would just be a longer road to get to there then so plus i wanna be in the thick of where like
S0253	that's that's what i'm like
S0274	do you know what i mean
S0253	i i i wanna i wanna do something that's like it's like change and evolve
S0274	mm
S0253	all the time and i wanna i i think that's the thing for me i feel like my job can be quite not repetitive but when you when you've kind of stick the course book
S0274	yeah
S0253	and and you can do your own stuff but when you're do the same course
S0274	mm
S0253	all the time like you know i've i've teach the same course like about a hundred time
S0253	and i just feel like if i do it again i'll i'll go mad er because it
S0274	yeah
S0253	it's even if you you know because you know i dunno and i just i wanna do something where it's like it's like really really like outrageously challenge and
S0274	yeah
S0253	a bite scary i wanna be scar
S0253	you know what i mean
S0274	yeah like an academic thrill ride
S0253	yeah yeah a roller coaster if you will
S0253	an emotional roller coaster
S0253	but i want you know how cos then and if and if i just if but you know if i can't do it then i'll i'll do something else but
S0274	yeah i mean i think the worst thing be be those that haven't try isn't it
S0253	yeah
S0274	do you know what i mean i think as you're talk there be i think i think we're probably quite similar be that i'm like i think the reason i never really take up read in term of leisurely read in the time that i know you and with university cos i know in my head i didn't have the time to commit to it and i
S0253	yeah
S0274	don't like to fail not i i i
S0253	yeah yeah yeah
S0274	and i don't think erm in the sense where i don't do stuff cos i think i'm gonna fail but cos i know i would like i will trudge and trudge through something to get it i won't have something unfinished
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	erm so i think that's why i need that but so it's a it's you know it's the thing to have isn't it you want this sort of i it's probably the mentality i use in my train and stuff like that it's kind of like
S0253	yeah
S0274	that's self discipline isn't it and like go okay it's shit and you know do this but you get it do and you
S0253	yeah i i think that's that's i'll tell you what i have i have i have like a certain fear of of of like when i i get nervous i'm type out job applications no one's watch you and no one's read what i'm write
S0274	mm
S0253	and i can always delete and edit and that's and that's the wonderful thing typewriters you know like use a typewriter
S0274	yeah
S0253	it's like you can
S0253	you can yeah oh i'd better start again
S0253	you know but you can erm you know you can edit and you know redact and things like that and but i still feel nervous when i'm do it and it's because i'm nervous about like you know get reject or
S0274	i think that's it isn't it i think sometimes as we're only human you're overthinking every paragraph go how be they gonna perceive that be they gonna think he hasn't take when
S0253	yeah yeah
S0274	really you need to have that sort of it's almost like self confidence certain of us we need to go well no i'm gonna write this and it's
S0253	i mean so i've get i i'm better at that cos the reason the reason i be so bad in uni be because i couldn't finish anything cos i couldn't finish a sentence i'd be like oh it's not right i need to change it
S0274	and you sit or your whole course just
S0253	i be
S0274	and then the man appear
S0253	it take me i
S0274	and then he
S0253	how how long how long do you how long do do it take you to write like what be your longest stint on an essay
S0274	well i wouldn't i wouldn't go by the undergraduate cos that discount
S0253	go on no go on what be the longest time you spend on an essay as an undergraduate be honest like type it out
S0274	it would be like i i remember i do one cos i
S0274	i want to go and see that night
S0253	oh yeah
S0274	yeah erm
S0253	oh well
S0274	i think i do it like in three hours yeah
S0253	that's the longest time no that be the shortest time
S0274	yeah the
S0253	what be the longest
S0274	go off this one see the problem be i don't work on it see i obviously i type it quite quick
S0253	right
S0274	but i'll do i'll do my read and note beforehand
S0253	yeah you always do that didn't you
S0274	yeah so
S0253	right
S0274	my writing's never long but read note usually would take me especially the master's i'd do it over like two weeks to a month
S0253	right
S0274	so
S0253	but what i'm say be when when you be an undergraduate you you have like a similar workload to me but you would you would be very direct you'd be like this have to be finish by this day
S0274	yeah
S0253	so and i've i'm do this and do this that leave me four days so i'm gonna finish this in four days
S0274	yeah that's true yeah
S0253	whereas what i would do be i'd start my essay like three weeks before the deadline
S0274	yeah i remember that and then
S0253	they they'd take me three weeks because i'd sit there and i because i have so much time on my hand
S0274	you'd delete a copy i remember
S0253	oh god i'd delete like i use to i i use to delete whole essay i use to write an essay and then delete it
S0274	i know i i remember your voice you'd be like oh he's do like a thousand word and he's he's just get rid of them
S0253	i know
S0274	but that be the difference that be where
S0253	but but please ask me to email me my
S0253	before you do business yeah just word toss them in
S0253	but erm and that's the thing so it's like i erm everything be like painstaking with me
S0274	yeah
S0253	and that's why i like with with job applications i'm i'm sit there and i'm i'm write them out and then i'm like you know like like and i kind of get nervous and then i delete stuff and it's just really stupid
S0274	yeah
S0253	what i'm say be i've i've get a bite better than i be at uni i've learn to be a bite more fearless so i've send out letter and things like that and then i email people and you know ask about like work experience and stuff and then the other day like i be feel really like you know brave and i be like so i've just get it be on the monday and i be like right not mess around now i'm gonna email a bunch of people see if i can get some freelance work like just some check and proofread so i erm so i email macmillan who be like probably the biggest elt publisher technically erm so i email macmillan but and i be like i just i just ball ballsally like you know be like you know just just enquire about any kind of like er freelance work and then like i be just like i'm not gonna overthink this press send and then like as soon as i look at the send box it be like i'd i'd put i think i'd put macmilla
S0253	macmilla like i hadn't put the l on the n on macmillan and i just like
S0253	when you're apply for like
S0253	a proofread job
S0274	that's amaze
S0253	like when you're try to say you're try sort of sell your proofread skills to someone and you're like yeah i'm good
S0274	you should have send one five minutes later say ah that be a deliberate ploy so the
S0253	do you notice my error
S0253	erm and and that's the problem be like i kind of get this confidence and i be just like yeah just send it out you're a good writer you can
S0274	yeah
S0253	you know you've get good grammar you've get good punctuation just send it and then
S0274	i i know do you know
S0253	macmilla and then it be just like
S0253	and it wasn't even like embed in the text so it be like it be the the the title of the email like the subject it be like flash up macmilla oh
S0274	oh but i know what you mean though
S0253	embarrass
S0274	cos it's not not to that level but i have to email like i email the service manager for the job
S0253	yeah
S0274	cos it have be age since i'd apply and i think ah well if i haven't get an interview i i wanna ask for feedback and like knock on the council door
S0253	yeah
S0274	but she email me back the next day and she be very polite and she say oh thank very much for your email she's like i've be busy erm we're gonna be shortlist next monday so she say if you've get and it's so you'll hear last and i be like oh right
S0253	so you'll hear
S0274	er hopefully a week monday i might hear that i've hopefully finger cross
S0253	good luck
S0274	that get an interview cheer erm but before send it be like right okay yeah and then i send it and i go shit shit have i have i imagine send the service manager of council like you know i've like put like dick on it or something like if
S0253	why would you write this
S0274	exactly but
S0253	do you normally write dick in email
S0274	not not really but you know these things that
S0274	anxiety sort of take over and i'm like
S0274	i'm like and yeah
S0253	yeah
S0274	but it be alright though er
S0253	i have i have i've not not i've not i've never write dick in an email but i've like i have do stuff like that or you know one thing that spellchecker doesn't always pick up be erm cos again if you frantically edit things
S0274	yeah
S0253	you will type a sentence and you will go to you might say such as and then you'll be like oh it doesn't sound right so you do the you start to search as and then you're right and you'll continue the think and you'll say such as something and it never pick up if you write things like such as such as cos that's like that's okay so like and these things or a double double article
S0274	yeah
S0253	oh no double article it do pick up but erm yeah check your work
S0253	just check your write
S0274	that's what i mean yeah macmillas
S0253	macmillas
S0274	probably think you be apply for like a i i dunno a brewery or something do you know what i mean
S0253	yeah macmilla macmilla time but it be i mean it i just have to laugh i mean it be only speculative anyway and they email me back and just say to be honest like our they say our database be like we've get like five hundred freelancers they're not look for anymore he say if we advertise something then but i mean you know you're at the the you're at the bottom of the pile
S0274	otherwise fuck off
S0253	it wasn't that bad it be just er the you know they they they have to control the number of applications they get
S0274	yeah
S0253	you you have to empathise because you know it's a skill that you know it's not something that everyone can do but it's a skill that it's not
S0274	i've hear you have to train in japan for two years
S0253	yeah in a sense like
S0253	no it well generally they they want they want erm you can get like certificate from like the society
S0274	that be not the definitive
S0253	you could you can you can you yeah you can train with like the society of proofreaders and get like accredit certificate and things like that and you know it's sort of have to you have to regulate this this job cos otherwise anyone can just say well i can read quite well and
S0253	cos like cos a he work from the village and he's a proof reader erm and then and he just land on the job but it's you know they've get to protect job like that because otherwise if everyone just say oh i can do it
S0274	yeah that's right
S0253	then you know you can't it's not it's not professionalise so they erm so obviously they're gonna say like listen they be just honest and just say like we've get five hundred we've get five hundred people on on the you know on the on the bank we don't need any more but if we do here's the thing and he be very polite so at least he get back to me
S0274	well it's good that he email you back isn't it yeah
S0253	yeah rather than be like macmilla
S0274	douche
S0253	yeah
S0274	delete
S0253	what an idiot so er yeah that be pretty that be pretty bad
S0274	i suppose it's a less
S0253	you've gotta you've gotta laugh
S0274	it's a lesson there for everyone isn't it
S0253	i'm i'm try to think of other parallel and do you watch the apprentice
S0274	no
S0253	you never watch that i er i i have never watch it until the other day and i find it hilarious but
S0274	i've see the little intros of them like talk about themselves
S0253	i think they're tell i think they're kind of
S0274	yeah
S0253	tell to be stupid
S0274	yeah
S0253	like cos like the guy
S0274	he try to sell me an investment deal
S0253	they're er irrepressibly arrogant
S0274	yeah
S0253	but i think it they're intentionally you know
S0274	yeah it's like go on big brother isn't it
S0253	yeah
S0274	it's one of those
S0253	they're not gonna pick some bland guy who's just like yeah i just wanna get on with everyone really
S0253	it's like they want the guy who's like i'm gonna confront everyone i've get some awful
S0253	erm and there's there be this really funny bite where they be try to sell a jumper to erm the buyer like er it be in it be in some fancy london fashion shop probably erm like you know where it's like a hundred quid a a jumper or something and erm so and it be an awful jumper it be it be call on air and the idea it have a camera in the jumper it be just a terrible idea right and it light up
S0274	it light up
S0253	right and and the guy give the pitch like the the team leader like give the pitch to them he he like you're try to sell them a jumper and he's like obviously i wouldn't wear this in public
S0253	and the guy's just like what so i guess that be kind of like an equal faux pas it's like
S0274	brilliant
S0253	it's contradict exactly what your job be
S0253	to do
S0274	oh
S0253	pretty stupid
S0274	it sound awful that it's
S0253	erm yeah the apprentice be er yeah
S0274	there you go there's er
S0253	er yeah it's it's i don't really like it that much by 's really into it so
S0274	i think i do to be fair i do watch a bite of the last season but it be more just i think when i be in work sometimes if
S0253	yeah
S0274	we'd get a spare like half an hour whatever it be just like yeah
S0253	i don't really like it do you watch much tv
S0274	erm yeah i watch that educate the east end
S0253	that's really good
S0274	but do you know what though it's kind of a thing you you know i watch it go out on a thursday do you know what i mean so the old little thing like but mate other than that apart from your question time on a thursday oh i ask i ask er to go on that this week
S0253	do you
S0274	but i haven't hear back so i mean the main thing be
S0253	where be it be it be film in liverpool
S0274	yeah i make the mistake though didn't i like i should have question her and i just like it probably at the most generic do you know what i mean like who do you vote for like blah de blah
S0253	yeah
S0274	you know what's your topic of the discussion when i really should have be out there like er i dunno i i support animal farm do you know what i mean the the
S0274	party that do that do you know what i mean
S0253	what's animal farm
S0274	it erm there's that book isn't it er
S0253	yeah i know about the book
S0274	yeah i dunno just in my head
S0253	do you mean do you mean like come across as like a rave
S0274	yeah it's like
S0253	sort of like
S0274	nutter
S0253	leftie radical
S0274	you never know on wednesday i could get a phone call and say oh someone's pull out
S0253	it's er it's do do you reckon do you reckon they want people with moderate view or they want people with
S0274	i think they try and balance
S0253	right
S0274	and obviously cos liverpool's quite staunchly labour
S0253	yeah
S0274	like probably have like and they give you the age bracket so it go from like twenty five to thirty five so there's probably that many people but it frustrate me sometimes when people get on there cos they often don't speak and you're well why have you go on it
S0253	yeah
S0274	do you know what i mean they have
S0253	it must be nerve rack though i mean like
S0274	yeah
S0253	i don't know i don't i i don't know a lot about politics
S0274	i they choose they're just current issue you know what i mean like last week it be erm er the the erm the dickhead lord browne broon or whatever his name be make the comment that he's disability minister
S0253	oh yeah
S0274	and he make you know work for about two pound and hour and then
S0253	where do they get them
S0274	he's renowned he's make comment like that in the past he's an idiot but erm they say he's more of a policy maker which which be why labour be go well don't you think that's kind of worry that that's his discourse that he's use
S0253	they're gonna jump on it aren't they
S0274	but then cos it be in berkshire obviously it be quite predominantly tory and they be attack the labour woman i can't remember her name go oh you're use this as a a political well it's like well yeah they be politicians but it be like but no he what he say be in extremely offensive and the whole time i be think there's nobody here with a disability they've ask don't really give a shit what you think doesn't matter what i think let's have someone with a disability
S0253	yeah
S0274	erm so the so there be things like that
S0253	yeah
S0274	and it it's more topical really erm
S0253	i i use to watch it i use to i use to like it when i be when i use to when i do politics in sixth form i use to watch it
S0274	yeah use to have
S0253	do be david dimbleby still do it
S0274	yeah he's there i mean i i just love it cos it be a mixture obviously of your tory one side you have your labour the one side and then you've usually get like a
S0253	like a cultural type of
S0274	yeah you've get
S0253	bite like
S0274	like a
S0253	a writer or
S0274	or i'll i quite like it when erm the liberty one be on it i can never pronounce her name
S0253	er chakrabarti
S0274	that's it yeah
S0253	yeah
S0274	she's very good erm and they have like this reverend guy he's alright but i don't like it sometimes where they're just play to like the popular sort of thing you'd like to see everything but it's not it's either or it's but it's not really what's gonna
S0253	i read i read a good i read a good article erm and it be there be a lad who he's a he be a he's a he say like you know he's a conservative i think he's like i think i can't remember what it be he's he's like a young maybe the representative of young conservatives or something like that
S0274	mm
S0253	and there be a show on bbc three and it be like get young people to talk about issue and stuff like that and it be try to try to bridge that gap in politics between you know young disaffect people
S0274	yeah
S0253	who who you know want want a voice and things like that and i think it be you know rick edwards i think it be him who host it but it be this article you know i mean i don't necessarily agree with a lot of what this guy probably believe you know it's his view on whatever but what i quite it be just really he write this really funny article and he say that when the they get someone so he be invite to come on this political talk show and he say when you get when you get invite on to this things erm there's normally like the stooge there's normally the one who have the most unpopular view
S0274	yeah
S0253	who's who's basically there to take to to to defend to defend themselves and against like vitriol for about you know an hour
S0274	yeah
S0253	erm it could would like like cos by a lot of people who don't agree erm and i didn't you know as i say i don't necessarily agree with his politics but he say it be really funny he say he he walk in the room and he look at the rest of the panel and he be like i wonder where the guy be who's gonna have to defend all the view oh
S0253	it's me cos there be no one in like he be
S0274	yeah
S0253	he be as right wing as they come and he be he say he's like you know he's sort of you know he's it's somewhere between like the tories and lib dems he say but in a in a crowd of young people who be obviously you know generally tend to be a lot more a lot more leave wing and a lot more
S0274	yeah
S0253	you know but also a lot more what's the word like staunch in their view and would or will not will not shy away from attack people
S0274	yeah
S0253	he say he look round the room and be just like
S0253	oh for god's sake
S0253	it just really make me laugh cos that's how these show be make
S0274	yeah
S0253	aren't they like it's
S0274	totally yeah
S0253	it's to get get like someone who get someone who can you know sometimes they can just do defend their policies and that's great but it just it really make me laugh that that cos he he must have absolutely bricked it
S0274	oh god
S0253	be terrify wouldn't you
S0274	i know yeah
S0253	but erm yeah no i only watch i watch newsnight that's about
S0274	yeah i watch that sometimes it's on all the time that
S0253	yeah it's i think it's on a bite more
S0274	and this week be quite good sometimes with that's andrew o'neil i think isn't it or it's andrew or be it andrew neil
S0253	be it
S0274	he use to be the time editor erm
S0253	right okay
S0274	but that's quite good cos they oh esther mcvey be on it the other day oh she do my nut in
S0253	who's esther mcvey
S0274	she's the mp for greasby and frankby and she's the minister of i think be she still the minister for disabilities i think she's still the minister for that
S0253	mm
S0274	she use to be a weather weather girl erm her dad and family own the fly school in john er john lennon airport
S0253	oh wow
S0274	run a business basically her position like many of them be buy
S0253	right
S0274	you know fund her old campaign and stuff like that and she what life experience have she get
S0253	yeah
S0274	you know she's come from a you know i'm not say that anybody come from a well upbringing hasn't get experience to give to the table but it's not and she just irritate me cos she's just that classic sort of like practice erm sort of script and it's like erm it be she be defend well she wasn't defend the guy who say that you know but just she's oh it annoy me because at the at the grass root of it all no matter how they say they're all very like labour and that and tories be very similar tories believe in an organic system where you have your rich and your poor and it's oh well get over the no do you know what i mean at the end of the day that's the core value of it
S0253	yeah
S0274	and they say i i hate it when people attack people for be a bite like well why can't we do this with a conscience oh we can't be pragmatic and have a conscience yes you can most of most of if you look at the tories most of their policies be reactionary austerity measure that's a reaction well oh oh oh we won't spend anything
S0253	yeah
S0274	what about i can never say it keynesianism i can never say it what his idea be be that if you
S0253	keynesian
S0274	that's it if you if you give people money they'll
S0253	yeah
S0274	flood the market and the economy because people spend that's gonna like get the coil go again
S0253	well if i look at my my education in a level be
S0253	i don't know what keynesian economics be but i know i know how to say it
S0274	but that's it but i mean again but i know
S0253	isn't keynesian economics trickle down economics
S0274	i think so i think i don't really know but again that's when i'm conscious that i don't have that much well you you could say it would go two ways can't you i don't have that great er when it's economics but then if i do would i be corrupt by it
S0253	yes
S0274	do you know what i mean
S0253	i think you would
S0274	do you know what i mean so it's cos if you if you're in something like for example i'm gonna wanna go hopefully get into social service you be bind like your experience have on placement it there be a lot that didn't like it you be judge people's abilities disabilities by how much money they get do they meet that criteria
S0253	really
S0274	yeah that's how it's run it's awful erm you you can't you can't measure a person's mental health thing though or whatever er
S0253	in economics
S0274	that that's it erm
S0253	but it i think
S0274	but then if you be or
S0253	but but if er if these service erm be increasingly privatise then that well the in in private systems it have to happen that way doesn't it
S0274	mm
S0253	cos how else do you do it
S0274	exactly i mean there be a lot of goodness that come that come out of it like you know to be fair a lot of social
S0253	like service
S0274	social enterprise as kind of people raise sort of rack their brain and think of what they can do and you know free service be out there you know government do pay for them mostly
S0253	yeah
S0274	via the contract but in the same sense this be what make me well i guess so annoy and that's why i be watch it like they'll blame immigration and erm they'll blame er oh it's the it's like they get us into like er this mess and you think yeah but then you're let the like be starbucks and big company get off with major amount of billions of tax and
S0253	yeah
S0274	you're pay how much into the mod through all these you know pay how much for a missile and you know it's
S0253	yeah
S0274	you you know you're give this tax break oh yes it's twelve grand now or ten grand before you pay tax but then you're think yeah but the people who be earn billions be get that as well
S0253	i read i read about that it's like
S0274	it's very clever like
S0253	isn't it isn't it isn't it proportionately so it's like the tax
S0274	people
S0253	the tax break for people be earn the lower bracket be nowhere near as good as the tax break for those
S0274	yeah
S0253	who be so you
S0274	but it's very cleverly do
S0253	so so it it wouldn't it wouldn't it would in a sense there'll be people who be in the lower bracket pay for the tax break of those on the higher bracket
S0274	essentially but because
S0253	and like they're balance it off
S0274	cos i mean i'm one of those people now and oh but yeah i've notice like my tax that i pay be a lot less
S0253	yeah
S0274	but then the way things everyone and oh the cost of living's go up and then you know the way everything be be change you don't people don't think of that they don't think of the the wider thing they think of the
S0253	the cost
S0274	instant don't they and they go well how much be how much do you wanna spend in tesco how much do you spend to like gas and electricity
S0253	yeah
S0274	those be go up you now
S0253	yeah
S0274	you know it doesn't compare with er so
S0253	one thing that sadden me in sort of and sort of resonate with me a bite be the other day where it be about the opportunities for for young people now like job opportunities
S0274	yeah
S0253	and i guess i guess the thing be that you can have a you can have a social conscience you know and you try you can you can be someone who who say you know i have a social conscience and things like that but and i but i hate the way like you sort of you're kind of force into you know worry about your pay and worry about your pay cheque cos you you always have a lifestyle to protect
S0274	yeah true
S0253	you know and i i hate that kind of feel of like competition and you know i have to compete with like you know i have to i have to compete with people to i dunno to to work and stuff like that and you know it's like i be think about like you know me and my colleague who we both get make redundant at the same time but suddenly we've go from be colleagues and work together on
S0274	to essentially yeah
S0253	i mean we both live in the same geographical area we've get the same qualifications we both
S0274	it's not battle royale
S0253	it basically be
S0253	it's dog eat dog and we're not friends anymore but it's but like i mean i'm not say i think like that and i'm not i'm not that cynical
S0274	no no i know
S0253	but i hate the fact that part of me be worry about that and part of me
S0274	yeah
S0253	be think of god like well you know if that's just one person that i know firsthand
S0274	yeah
S0253	who's in the same boat as me then what be there to say there's not maybe maybe er and probably there's there's hundreds of us you know all vie for the same thing it's really scary
S0274	forget about them
S0253	forget about her
S0274	hey
S0253	thank
S0274	that's the idea just i think that's one thing where i when i'm apply for this i i've i've
S0253	i don't think of about it
S0274	yeah cos i think no you just you're go this be me and and i hate that word sell yourself you're not no you're not you're not sell yourself you're just this be me this be the ability i've
S0253	i
S0274	do i fit your team do i fit with your mind set
S0253	i think yeah i think that's that's a really it's it it go without say but i mean that's a really like if you be tell someone how to go about apply for job i think that's the best way to do it don't think of don't think of your application in relation to other people's i mean obviously you people will say oh try and try and make yourself stand out from
S0274	yeah
S0253	the crowd but it if you present the things as they be you know and you you as long as if you fill your if you fill your applications with sort of what's the word you know just recycle
S0274	yeah
S0253	team player and all that stuff then you're not gonna get anywhere and i think if you just state things as they be
S0274	they want they want at the end of the day if you're look through a thousand applications you wanna read a story don't you
S0274	do you know what i mean
S0253	yeah
S0274	you know you don't wanna you're gonna be get the same thing about i do this and then i do this and i do this but it's like well actually from this experience i learn this and that that go on to you know what i mean
S0253	yeah
S0274	oh i just not i go to africa and build huts you know and that's great but you know what i mean but actually like i don't like yourself i i've work in an english language school for three years
S0253	i think i think i'd much rather a candidate who who go to africa
S0253	rather than just someone who'd like sort of lazily work in a school
S0253	i think that's a much better candidate from me but er but yeah i know what you mean it's erm
S0274	i mean obviously mine's probably similar to yours in the sense that even though it's totally the thing be i've get to make sure i've i know current legislation and current topics of you know change and kind of stuff stuff like that
S0253	yeah
S0274	but once you've get past that it's okay well put that down now you've see that this be my experience and this be how it it's me and me personally i'm a
S0253	yeah
S0274	yeah so
S0253	yeah i think i think i think that's what i'm try to do with the applications i'm write at the moment but another get another few days to write them i'm just like i'm try to i'm try not to overthink them and try not to think too much about oh you know i'm i'm i'm write them properly i'm not like just kind of
S0274	mm
S0253	you know draw picture on the page for something like that but
S0253	but erm you know just try to be a bite more free and just think okay well you know it's obvious that you know all this stuff's obvious
S0274	mm
S0253	try try i guess it's try to like i'll stop this i guess
