S0320	oh
S0322	the wrong way at first
S0320	i get oh i see what you mean it only take thirteen hours though
S0322	cos look you be you're definitely go backwards

S0322	well hopefully you won't be fly backwards
S0320	okay i get it
S0322	ah right okay where be you go sorry
S0320	so we're go to which be here and that's where that's where erm 's family live
S0322	and be this where be you when you
S0320	we we're in when we when i live there
S0322	yeah
S0320	yeah i be in
S0322	but be that where you be work be that where you first go
S0320	that's where i live for the whole time
S0322	okay
S0320	actually erm i visit other place but i only ever live in erm i'll show you let's have a look at some picture doesn't look very appeal
S0322	it's quite a big city oh what's this though
S0320	it be actually erm well that's actually pretty slum area
S0322	cos that's nice oh
S0320	so it be nice and this be a big tourist spot erm i wonder if there's any other picture of it
S0322	i like the architecture i like the the colour the colour house and stuff
S0320	yeah the colour
S0322	bite like
S0320	the the colour be the nicest thing about it actually
S0322	mm
S0320	so there's two they're call this be which
S0322	mm
S0320	and then there's another one just behind it but you really can't go on to the other one or you couldn't when i be there
S0322	oh really
S0320	cos it be really dangerous so nowadays i'm just see if i can find a picture of the step
S0322	that's nice
S0320	yeah again look so this be the hill on the other side
S0322	mm
S0320	not touristy
S0322	yeah
S0320	you can't you can't really you couldn't really go there anyway erm i wonder if there's a clearer picture so there's like it's er there's basically like one set of step that you go up that's here
S0322	mm
S0320	actually
S0322	mm
S0320	it so you go up these this be the the like water front oh i've lose where's it go okay so this be the this be the waterfront which be all really develop erm and you go up these step they're call and it's call and on each the there's like restaurants and shop and all sort of things and the restaurants be identify by which step number they're on so all the step be number
S0322	oh
S0320	so and i meet when there actually and we meet on step like number two hundred and thirty five or something like that at a bar and that's what it be call
S0322	mm
S0320	and if you're meet somebody you don't say i'll meet you in such and such bar you'll say i'll i'm in a bar it's on step number two hundred and forty five
S0322	oh that's cool
S0320	so yeah it's one of the it's sort of one of the nicer areas well i say it's one of the nicer areas but it's actually yeah quite rough it's quite poor actually and the only reason that it's you be able to go there be cos it's be turn into a tourist attraction i can't actually find any
S0322	mm
S0320	picture of the step so this be the erm the malec√≥n the what's it call the the waterfront
S0322	mm
S0320	so you can kind of
S0322	well that would have be quite a walk then
S0320	walk in here er yeah it be relatively erm and i don't know where it be yeah look at all these high rise build
S0322	mm
S0320	again there's a lot more high rise build there when when i be there actually and this be actually near where we get marry
S0322	mm
S0320	and we get marry
S0322	you weren't on a boat be you
S0320	a bite this way yeah not on that boat
S0322	mm
S0320	that boat be a bite dull we be on the party boat
S0320	this one's just a bite bore and a bite historical so we didn't go on that one but that be where we get marry
S0322	well where where's your boat moor
S0320	ha
S0322	be it moor
S0320	it be but then it be for most of the even but it do go around the er do a little sort of circle
S0322	and
S0320	round the river
S0322	where's the oh be that the step
S0320	yeah those be the step finally yeah those be the step
S0322	ah okay
S0320	so it's quite hard work to get up them
S0322	mm
S0320	but the the house like all the different colour house be nice but they're all like it's pretty poor
S0322	mm
S0320	they're not all the big posh house
S0322	mm
S0320	that you get in they're all sort of quite yeah erm
S0322	and
S0320	yeah it's that's what it's call god i've get such a bad memory i'm not gonna know where er nothing be when i go there so it be really nice but it's literally just these house here if you go like a block back
S0322	mm
S0320	it you well you don't go a block back
S0322	mm
S0320	if you're a tourist erm so yeah
S0322	and where's the beach then
S0320	so let's have a look at the map again the beach so this be the closest beach this be where that get the sun first again it's be redevelop since i go so bo bo derek bo derek do that sound familiar
S0322	mm the one with the plait in her hair
S0320	eco warrior these days
S0322	yeah probably yeah yeah i think she's
S0320	yeah so she's be there
S0322	oh
S0320	erm it use to be really really rough and i use to go with friends who just want we just want to go the beach and it be really wasn't very nice wasn't a very nice beach wasn't a very nice town i think it's all be massively redevelop and be quite posh these days erm so but anyway we're not go to we be go
S0322	no
S0320	that's quite posh
S0320	's quite posh 's quite nice i think i need to zoom in a bite to find the beach that we're go to
S0322	what's that do there
S0320	there's a as well you know
S0322	mm
S0320	one of the provinces have go the just weirdest name for weird er weird place
S0320	erm that's where we're go
S0322	okay that sound nice
S0320	er yeah it's the party town
S0322	go on put it on to what's it call terrain
S0320	on to terrain
S0322	yeah

S0320	but they haven't get that yet
S0322	they haven't drive around with the van
S0320	no
S0322	oh

S0322	that's probably why
S0320	so it's not very clear be it
