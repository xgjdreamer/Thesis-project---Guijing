S0181	so be most of the things you have from like two thousand five or when
S0182	no they're from all over all years
S0181	like like when's all years begin
S0182	well from two thousand and five right up to i guess december of last year
S0181	oh right
S0182	and i have a bunch of ones that for some reason i've name l j run one to two three four and onwards
S0181	presumably l j would stand for
S0182	yeah and run i don't know what run mean
S0181	you want to post them to the internet and they be something to do with run
S0182	no random
S0181	random picture be therefore call run
S0182	i've just figure out how my mind work yeah
S0181	logical
S0182	yes
S0181	similar thing i don't have anything earlier than two thousand and five that's a bite odd like that
S0182	that's when our life start i guess actually i think it's pretty much
S0181	i think it's when like we have digital cameras
S0182	no yeah it's when i i start get my camera
S0181	ah
S0182	and i've get a lot lot of ones from usually of food i've get one of a pestle and mortar with grind up sesame seed in it
S0181	do you pestle or pestle
S0182	pestle i say well i say pestle but you spell it pestle
S0181	i also pronounce it pestle
S0182	do you
S0181	yes
S0182	uh have i be say it wrong all this time then
S0181	i have no idea we should consult an authority such as baba yaga
S0182	well i be think more like my mum but i get it from her so
S0181	i'll refrain from the obvious joke about resemblances between your mum and baba yaga
S0182	you can't say that
S0181	she'd think it be hilarious
S0182	maybe
S0181	but no seriously you know pestle baba yaga obvious no no
S0182	no
S0181	oh
S0182	and i have a picture of some um not green tea i think it's i'm not quite sure what it be but you drink it on uh graduation day
S0181	not like special green tea matcha
S0182	no i think it's it might be kombu
S0181	i don't know what kombu be a special kind of green tea
S0182	sea seaweed i think it's get seaweed in it
S0181	green tea with seaweed in it
S0182	something like that
S0181	so it's a sort of
S0182	like kombucha
S0181	a sort of haze of recently graduate students then
S0182	no no no that's that's give to the teachers
S0182	so i've get a picture of um a a some i think kombucha with uh petals float in it and the the guide to the graduation be just inside the frame so you can see that it say graduation in japanese but you can't see what school it be or anything just sort of like stock photography style
S0181	perfect there we go
S0182	yeah
S0181	you can post it to a stock site
S0182	uh oh yeah no no i don't think i can cos the the um resolution be terrible cos it be a digital uh well it's from my iphone
S0181	okay right yeah that's not gonna cut it then
S0182	so it's not yeah but it be kind of what i be go for for a a blog
S0181	even if it's awesome it's not gonna cut it it's quite weird but like micro stock sit
S0182	yeah
S0181	um because they can't afford to employ like professionals to evaluate the picture
S0182	yeah
S0181	and to price them etcetera basically go entirely off technical specifications when they're decide what to accept
S0182	really
S0181	yeah so while like a a a brilliant photograph take on an iphone could actually make it onto like a top premium like getty editorial section sell for hundreds of dollars
S0182	mm mm
S0181	it wouldn't get onto a micro stock site conversely an absolutely dreadful photograph of technical high quality would probably pass for micro stock
S0182	i see that a lot of time on um photo communities there be people out there with absolutely fantastic cameras take picture of cup of coffee
S0181	keep to the theme of micro stock most of the sit have list of things they don't want to see and it's usually like stuff that be lie around your apartment
S0182	but people do that someone i think they they
S0181	well
S0182	they take a picture of their neighbour's garden cos they like their pumpkins or something
S0181	on the plus side that totally doesn't sell um cos that's the other thing be like the micro stock sit admit they have this sort of slight issue that like garbage can get in if it's technically okay
S0182	mm
S0181	but it's not gonna sell so it's sort of self correct right
S0182	and another thing with
S0181	brilliant demonstration of the market system or something
S0182	be that if you do a if you take a picture of a beautiful sunset then people just start vote for that i i don't get it
S0181	could probably learn something about the market of photography
S0182	yeah
S0181	except who want a stock photograph of a sunset nobody
S0182	no well it's not about stock photography but a lot of the ones that get that be rank highly they're um they're picture of nature and sunsets do in such a way they tell you nothing about the country they're in or anything except that it have a that there be a beautiful sunset that day
S0181	be this in the context of like pure photo context or be you talk like day on earth or what
S0182	stuff like that like the photo file community
S0181	sometimes tell you nothing about the country be acceptable isn't it
S0182	mm it's okay
S0181	depend what you're interest in wow that be a strange strange statue
S0182	what be you look at
S0181	a photo of a strange strange statue um yokohama
S0182	uh huh which statue
S0181	the one of the cat stand on the pile of house
S0182	have i see it i must have see it
S0181	i think you be there yeah it look like like the first time we go to yokohama i've get photos of graffiti and things
S0182	okay i'm gonna google that and i'm gonna look for cat stand on house photograph
S0181	that's art man
S0182	cat house i'm gonna add in yokohama
S0181	you'll get hundreds of photos of actual cat which be actually what i would expect to win all these photo contexts we be discuss
S0182	yes some people just vote for the cat
S0181	well who wouldn't
S0182	cat house yokohama statue my first hit be pet in japan nurse care for pet cat cafes and dot dot dot
S0181	okay do you remember those shots from york you be talk about
S0182	yuh huh
S0181	and wonder what they be i can actually tell you they be take on the twenty seventh of january
S0182	oh i know that
S0181	yeah and i can actually tell you where it be um you know okay this be really imprecise but you know that gate that we always seem to end up use when we go to york probably because we always stay in like a b and b just outside it
S0182	mm mm mm mm
S0181	it's the one up the north west westest near the near the to the west of the
S0182	okay
S0181	north of the train station yeah
S0182	okay
S0181	anyway so just south of there
S0182	mm mm
S0181	just across the road outside the wall there's a sort of ruin of an abbey and there's a sort of museum castle and a park full of squirrels
S0182	mm mm
S0181	and that be where that all be
S0182	yeah we do take a lot of picture of squirrels almost as if we know we weren't gonna see them any more for about five years
S0181	and then we do
S0182	we do
S0181	you know i just make fun of people for take picture of cat and i find like an entire folder that's basically just the cat dress as santa so yes
S0182	he didn't seem to mind but it but it's it's our cat
S0181	it keep him warm so
S0182	it's like cat be a lot like kid no one want to see anybody else's
S0181	it's our cat and we never post it on the internet as
S0182	yeah yeah that's the main thing
S0181	look the cat be dress as santa
S0182	but he be very happy with it
S0181	well he be warm
S0182	yes but i think he genuinely like be santa hm
S0181	yeah do you know what i hate
S0182	no
S0181	i'm gonna tell you
S0182	i guess that
S0181	photograph take at firework display
S0182	oh i do that
S0181	i always find i end up with about four hundred and it can quickly trim it down to about one hundred but you really only want to keep about five and it's make the final cut right it's like which of these almost identical photograph be better
S0182	no no no if basically if if it isn't blur it get keep that reduce it to about five
S0181	oh really
S0182	yeah
S0181	i guess i'm better at take photograph of fireworks than you which
S0182	you may well be
S0181	surprise me greatly um
S0182	it's a matter of just hold the camera still but if you use an iphone then basically adjust it basically assume that you're just take things randomly and take it well but if you're take a digital with a with a professional camera
S0181	no i i think digital camera shots that can come out not blur i guess it's just cos i take so many
S0182	okay
S0181	i think i just take way many more than you at firework display
S0182	could be
S0181	that's another thing that you can't sell anyway firework photos
S0182	i dunno depend what you're take it of
S0181	there be someone launch fireworks last night actually do you
S0182	i didn't what time
S0181	oh i dunno nine pm or something that be a complete guess
S0182	what be i i be watch the mentalist wasn't i
S0181	no okay it must have be earlier than nine pm then
S0182	okay then i be watch that i wasn't watch i be in the room with mum and dad watch that show about truck
S0181	that sound painful
S0182	it be kind of hypnotic they be make i think it be harry hill that be make fun of kind of it the other day cos they try and inject a lot of drama into a guy who might not make his deliveries on time
S0181	what show about truck be this like world's most extreme
S0182	eddie
S0181	tough demon truckers of doom
S0182	it be the eddie something or other truck thing
S0181	a different truck thing
S0182	yeah
S0181	oh the um after the famous company
S0182	yes
S0181	eddie stobart
S0182	that's it
S0181	which be a as i say
S0182	yeah
S0181	famous company in the uk so locally famous company
S0182	why i be look basically i find it very fascinate when they talk about um how famous or how many genuine fan they have
S0181	yeah it's like
S0182	that be that be fascinate
S0181	can you think of any hobby more more like ridiculous than train spot
S0182	um
S0181	truck spot
S0182	i probably have a few of those hobbies myself
S0181	well yeah probably the same here but who be that comedian though be that on the radio or be it on tv the other day i can't remember
S0182	well describe the comedian and i will
S0181	oh no the the joke be like all these train spotters i can't think of any more pathetic hobby i count a hundred and forty seven of them this morning
S0182	i i don't think i hear that or saw it or whatever it be on
S0181	be probably on the radio then
S0182	oh okay
S0181	might have be on newscheck
S0182	oh could've be
S0181	or it might have be that um the the programme about glasgow
S0182	yeah i can see why they'd need a few comedians on that
S0181	no don't you remember there be a comedian present a programme about glasgow
S0182	oh it it wasn't really about glasgow it be i think it be about issue in glasgow that turn up in his set
S0181	no it be about glasgow just glasgow as a giant bag of issue and be from glasgow it produce much of his material
S0182	i think it be more about his material
S0181	because let's face it if you're if you're from glasgow and you're do dark comedy you're never gonna want for content
S0182	um glasgow isn't that bad
S0181	you've be there you remember eve's story about the time the post office blow up
S0182	uh vaguely
S0181	that's glasgow central glasgow be really really nice
S0182	mm mm
S0181	but that be a tiny percentage of the whole city you know that glasgow be the murder capital of europe right
S0182	yeah
S0181	yeah not not some like economically devastate ex part of like a balkan war zone or something like that it's glasgow
S0182	okay
S0181	yeah which be you know a fact so people make all these feature about how glasgow be a great city of culture and it's cruel to perpetuate this stereotype about glasgow and then you go there and there's this wasteland of industrial place and hey murder capital of europe
S0182	well
S0181	on a relate note i don't think i have any photos of glasgow which be interest give the amount of time i have be there
S0182	i've only be there once
S0181	might might be a further commentary on it
S0182	i have a picture of of ikebukuro here and it's just a picture of a guy in a mojo jojo outfit
S0181	that be very right and proper
S0182	interest that you have nothing
S0181	mojo jojo you be just wait for me to say that weren't you
S0182	no no i wasn't
S0181	um
S0182	i'm just i think he's advertise cars
S0181	and why not
S0182	indeed hm a lot of my iphone picture have uh gps coordinate embed in them
S0181	it would be really it would be really geeky to ask which kind of mojo jojo he be like which version of the series
S0182	okay what do you mean
S0181	well i mean be
S0182	how would i tell
S0181	oh i don't you'd have to compare the character design from the different incarnations of the series
S0182	i really don't care enough to do that
S0181	no it's not really worth the effort be it
S0182	i've get some of odaiba at night and i think it might have be after the dragonforce concert or whatever it be call
S0181	that be the dragonforce
S0182	there's um tree i think it's sakura or maybe ume
S0181	what be ume again in english
S0182	plum i think well it's it's not
S0181	plum oh right like in as in umeboshi
S0182	it's not plum but it it's close enough
S0181	if force to translate it you could write japanese plum or something
S0182	mm or apricot japanese apricots sometimes translate as
S0181	they be actually more like apricots aren't they
S0182	they be more like apricots yeah green apricots
S0181	marvellous
S0182	they're nothing like plums
S0182	it's just one day someone say well plum and i guess they go whatever
S0181	yeah so translate between japanese and english be often do very badly
S0182	mm
S0181	like that translation of badger thing i keep talk about
S0182	uh huh
S0181	that's something else i don't have i have no photos of badger
S0182	i have never even see a badger so
S0181	really
S0182	yeah never
S0181	wow that's fascinate
S0182	what do you mean that's fascinate why be it fascinate
S0181	well it's just kind of weird to like live in rural england and never see a badger
S0182	i haven't actually live in rural england for any length of time
S0181	i suppose suppose not actually you don't really get urban badger in london do you
S0182	you don't no so there you go you could try and fix that for me if you want
S0181	mm i actually don't know how to pronounce um the scientific name of badger which be meles or maybe meles or meles
S0182	melay
S0181	m e l e s meles
S0182	okay i don't have much to say about that unfortunately and now i've find
S0181	well it make it difficult for me to try and explain the whole different type of badger problem if i can't even pronounce the word i want to use
S0182	right wow i've get a picture of another special kit kat it's actually espresso uh espresso coffee and it's with another drink it's um sekai no kitchen kara and it's caramel au lait
S0181	okay
S0182	it be really good it taste like butter
S0181	fair enough
S0182	no but that sound when i say that to someone they think that sound really nasty but
S0181	it certainly doesn't make it sound good
S0182	but it you if you look at the back the calories be not
S0181	be not
S0182	not too high
S0181	fair enough
S0182	it's a it's less than uh a regular regular coffee even
S0181	get it
S0182	because probably because it's just all flavour flavour and milk but it be really good
S0181	here we go badger here we go so when you say badger to a british person right
S0182	uh huh
S0181	they think of the the the kind with the black and white stripy face
S0182	yuh huh
S0181	which be meles meles okay get that
S0182	okay that sound like a good name for an indie band
S0181	it be right when most people in japan be tell to imagine like a foreign badger a non japanese badger yeah they think of a different kind of plain brown one which be meles leucurus which be the kind you get in china and russia i'm guess that somewhere down the line some compiler of like school science textbooks wasn't very precise in their badger type
S0182	that's terrible
S0181	it's very terrible and you do get badger in japan which be meles anakuma
S0182	anakuma
S0181	anakuma
S0182	oh ana would be in be in hole kuma mean bear hole bear
S0181	hole bear which be quite interest because the japanese ones actually have like they look like they have the body of the asian one and the sort of like european style black and white face so
S0182	right
S0181	the japanese badger actually look really similar
S0182	yeah
S0181	to like a british badger
S0182	right
S0181	but the existence of british type badger be not know to people in japan
S0182	right
S0181	and it's one of those things that's really hard to explain to people because then they start punch it into their dictionary and the dictionary be give them the wrong answer
S0182	yes
S0181	because it's call up the like generic asian one you get the idea
S0182	i get the idea now and
S0181	and there be no badger in hokkaido
S0182	that must be a very sad place
S0181	yes oh i'm sorry i have to be precise here
S0182	yes
S0181	the one that you get in the uk be meles meles meles
S0182	now that be an awesome name for an indie band
S0181	yes you also get some other ones for example in crete you get meles meles arcalus
S0182	mm mm
S0181	and in like afghanistan and you know around in the middle east you get meles meles canescens these all look kind of like stripy face type there's the iberian badger meles meles marianensis the norwegian badger meles meles milleri which only exist in south west norway
S0182	okay
S0181	there's the rhodian badger yeah so there be a lot of varieties on the european stripy face type i'm amaze you've never see one
S0182	why
S0181	you you should go out and take nature photograph they're
S0182	you can't
S0181	they're great for sell to stock sit you get to lie in a ditch for four hours and then you see a badger what a fun way to spend an even
S0182	yeah
S0181	you know i be try to sort out my photos and i've just spend the entire time talk about badger
S0182	and i'm i'm actually get on quite well i'm i'm sort them by date
S0181	i'm way behind where i want to be i'm sort by like sort of date and location
S0182	right
S0181	do you see what i mean
S0182	yeah
S0181	so if there be sort of two distinct activities on one day they'll become two different folders
S0182	yes same here
S0181	yeah i'd also like to note that the honey badger be not a meles at all it's a different subspecies
S0182	well honey badger don't give a shit
S0181	suppose that be inevitable wasn't it that joke
S0182	yes
S0181	and the american badger be a completely different subspecies but it look vaguely similar to the european badger presumably some settlers be short on name for things
S0182	yeah just wander round call everything a badger that's a badger that's a badger that tree be a badger
S0181	hey there be like four cities call aberdeen in america you know
S0182	mm mm
S0181	and what's with perth there be perths in the usa and i don't uh
S0182	that's what i've ask myself all this time what be with perth
S0181	what be with perth right there be perths in the us and canada there's obviously the famous one in australia and they're all name after well perth now why
S0182	not really worth it be it
S0181	maybe hey maybe that solve the mystery maybe perth use to be a much bigger place and then everyone leave to go and live in australia and the us and that's why it's become the sort of through through route that it be now
S0182	maybe they turn up there and just go this be just as shitty as it be back home i think i'll call it perth
S0181	no i reckon perth might have be in fact perth be quite nice it's just there's nothing there it's it's a place that you go through on the way to somewhere else
S0182	which be just like america when they first arrive
S0181	without stop you stop when you go and colonise america right
S0182	yeah
S0181	but in perth you just drive through without stop that's what that's all there be it be a mystery
S0181	maybe in the distant past when people have to travel more slowly they all stop in perth it's my new theory
S0182	and i have a picture of mushi shi which be a movie that be out on the twenty fourth of march dunno what year it's from the director of well the director have something to do with akira and steam boy
S0181	okay
S0182	and it star odagiri jocirc i never saw it i'd still like to though and do you know what the kanji for mushi be
S0181	no
S0182	well you know what the kanji for regular mushi be
S0181	yes
S0182	well it's just three of them
S0181	oh
S0182	yeah
S0181	particularly large and impressive insect then
S0182	i guess well i think it's spirit in this case
S0181	i wish you could do that in english what
S0182	like you'd have like the word for cat and then you'd repeat it three time cat cat cat and that would mean a tiger
S0181	exactly how convenient would that would that not be convenient
S0182	it would yeah
S0181	i also don't seem to have any photograph of tigers here which be a shame cos i know i have some photograph of tigers somewhere
S0182	you be very excite i saw in the natural history museum i saw well it be a stuff tiger but it be actually a hybrid tiger of two different type of tiger and its paw be so big
S0181	what do you call it when you hybridise tigers cos you know if you cross breed like a lion and a tiger it's call a liger
S0182	yeah
S0181	very bite of obvious portmanteau assembly there
S0182	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0181	but if you cross breed a tiger and a tiger we're gonna call it a a tiger
S0182	tiger
S0181	oh curse
S0182	but anyway that be what i saw
S0181	so apparently if you cross breed a tiger and a different kind of tiger you get a tiger with massive paw
S0182	well i don't know it might just have be what a tiger look like
S0181	you're not experience with tigers
S0182	well i can't remember the last time i go to the zoo cos i think about go to ueno but ueno be a sad place
S0181	mm mm
S0182	all the animals look unhappy
S0181	so i meet this cross breed tiger
S0182	right
S0181	and i say to him what's it like be a cross breed tiger and he say well i have huge paw
S0182	i hate you
S0181	that's funny man
S0182	yeah
S0181	that be a classic of comedy
S0182	get one of tanabata here
S0181	which tanabata
S0182	well tanabata tanabata in july
S0181	like like no particular year just a random
S0182	oh two thousand and six tanabata
S0181	random random festival
S0182	just of all the wish hang on the tree and actually now i can actually read one of them it say i wish to win the lottery
S0181	what a heart warm wish
S0182	i wish to win the lottery
S0181	i think you have to buy a ticket first
S0182	well actually mum buy a ticket every week
S0181	yeah but doesn't mean she'd give us anything if she win
S0182	well it depend
S0181	do you help her pick number this time
S0182	i do actually
S0181	you've gotta do that
S0182	i usually try not to pick them rhythmically so i i don't like go this then this then this and a certain number in each column because i tend to bunch them up together cos the ball tend to fall that way which mean i be actually think about the potential possibility of maybe win
S0181	you understand that none of that be true if you see what i mean
S0182	well
S0181	like analyse historical data for number etcetera for the lottery doesn't actually do anything
S0182	yeah but they do bunch up they don't they don't fall like one in the zero column one in the ones twenties thirties forties
S0181	it it appear that way but the net distribution be random
S0182	yeah
S0181	random
S0182	i know that
S0181	oh i just find a whole series of photograph i take of a cat sit on top of the offer box at a temple in kyoto
S0182	that sound like you
S0181	they're great picture something you never see in the uk be it you never go into a church and there's a cat sit on the altar
S0182	that be very true
S0181	hey now there's an idea
S0182	oh no you're not gonna do that again
S0181	we have a cat
S0182	priests don't like cat as much as you do
S0181	no we're talk about stock photos and everyone take the same old things right
S0182	uh huh
S0181	i bet none of the sit have a cat stand on a church altar
S0182	you be actually do exactly what i think you be do
S0181	it's just a great idea i mean i'm sure lot of people could use that to illustrate their you know it could be allegorical in some way or just cute
S0182	it could advertise church bingo nights
S0181	do church really have bingo nights i mean really
S0182	in just ask mum
S0181	do she go to church bingo nights
S0182	she go to pretty much anything the church do
S0181	do i have to start be nice about bingo now
S0182	um actually i don't think she really like bingo i think she'd see it as a sign as of get old
S0181	well it be she's she would be
S0182	well not any more
S0181	she would be quite correct in that assessment what do you mean not any more
S0182	well it seem to be a young person's sport now
S0181	if you're drink
S0182	well basically go out have a drink and maybe you get a chance to win some money i mean i i can't really fault that i'd rather play poker though
S0181	yeah um well that's the whole thing i i guess it's just like you can get the same thing by play poker of course if you're sit there and drink you're totally lose while you're play poker but you you can still have fun
S0182	yeah
S0181	and drink and have a chance to win some money although a a lower chance because you're drink and someone there isn't but i guess the main difference there be poker be a bite classier than bingo right you you expect people to have a higher standard of dress in a casino
S0182	but you have a greater chance of lose money i mean once you've pay your money for bingo you can't lose any more it's like a fix rate
S0181	it's just bingo halls be just so grim
S0182	do you know that for a fact
S0181	don't you remember the one we walk past in with the photo outside of the you know the the the supposedly advertise poster
S0182	mm mm i've always find that picture of
S0181	it be really like it's like be you an age work class woman
S0182	picture of people on their nights out look crap
S0181	but but those ones
S0182	they only mean anything to people who be there at the time
S0181	they they they be suppose to be market their place and they've get these photograph of these people and it's like be you an age work class woman drown your sorrow with bingo they they just could've just choose
S0182	okay
S0181	much better model you know
S0182	well i think they be actually take picture of
S0181	for example
S0182	of people have fun say you could have fun too like this or you could still get a picture
S0181	do you have a terrible fake tan it's like you can make a case for photograph natural people and you can make a case for photograph you know professional model and you can make a case for like heavily heavily photoshoping your image to make people look better but why would you take a picture of someone who's paint themselves orange
S0182	clearly you've never see charlie and the chocolate factory
S0181	well yes exactly maybe i'm just cynical i have all
S0182	with everything
S0181	these beach photos here but all the beach photos i've ever take seem to be rain
S0182	i've get some really nice picture of the um of the
S0181	it's just always rain in beach photos
S0182	sunset reflect in the kind of wash in in the sea
S0181	yeah actually i'm exaggerate for comic effect it's snow in several of my beach photos
S0182	mm it be snow very hard in um one day and actually i decide to take a walk when i come i come across a surfer come back from the beach he look pretty cold all wet suit and everything
S0181	one would presume he be pretty cold
S0182	and here i have take a picture of pudding in a can it's call pud in shape
S0181	what be it be it actually like creme caramel or be it some other flavour
S0182	yeah it's creme caramel in a can you shake it up and i guess there's some kind of a reaction and it the drink kind of go hard a bite and it's kind of puddingy
S0181	that's interest
S0182	i'm very impress
S0181	and they mean interest in the sort of polite way of say that be a terrible and hideous thing
S0182	oh well obviously i drink it
S0181	be it good
S0182	mm it's not bad
S0181	i get pretty much put off all the whole sort of like you know jelly in can kind of drink and all those
S0182	mm mm
S0181	kind of things do i tell you that story
S0182	no i don't think so
S0181	well i go to buy some dr pepper from this vend machine
S0182	oh you get the wrong one and you get aloe vera in it
S0181	yeah the vend machine be misloaded and i get this aloe vera drink so i think well i have it now what i didn't realise it be aloe vera with lump of jelly inside it
S0182	no it wasn't lump of jelly it's it's lump of aloe
S0181	well that's worse
S0182	be it
S0181	but because i wasn't expect any such thing it be quite a shock i think it wasn't actual lump of like the plant aloe
S0182	i believe it be some some be edible some aren't since you ask
S0181	i hope it be the edible kind
S0182	well yeah although i think there be a slight scandal a few years back when people start put lump of aloe in that weren't the edible type and be actually slightly poisonous
S0181	a slight scandal
S0182	well you know there's a food scandal every year or so
S0181	that's true yeah
S0182	think people be a little bite embarrass that it wasn't from china this time oh i've get a picture of you in some kind of izakaya i think oh on on the boat
