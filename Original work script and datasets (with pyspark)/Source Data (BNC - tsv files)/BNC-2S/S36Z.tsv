S0024	it really be age ago it be well anyway what be we that be a funny texture ain't it
S0144	mm
S0024	i like it i'd like to get it again i wonder if they've get it in that foreign shop cos they have all sort of stuff didn't they but i just didn't spend i felt quite rush
S0144	mm
S0024	with just one hour to nip round wasn't kind of browse
S0144	well it take us an hour as well
S0024	yeah well we weren't browse
S0144	only get there with a few minutes to spare
S0024	yeah we have to just focus on the meat in the end yeah so i didn't really look at all those special vitamins and stuff they'd get and the teas but these fruit teas be so expensive
S0144	mm
S0024	and i'm sure they do the flower for camomile at the supermarket but then i buy the wrong ones last time that look exactly the same as a camomile flower
S0144	mm
S0024	er so do you like that do you like those
S0144	so what could we use instead of bonjela

S0024	cloves
S0144	cloves
S0024	cloves and aniseed but it's in a really minute quantity i'm guess i don't really know what they put in bonjela but i know that if you put cleave when er we when your teeth come through when you're a bite older i remember we i put cleave oil on but it's so strong that a baby can't have that can it
