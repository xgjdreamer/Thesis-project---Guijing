S0510	just a bite of an upgrade or two since year seven
S0509	yeah

S0509	yeah definitely
S0510	mm
S0509	yeah there be cos there's all these word where it's like erm choose the word that fit this sentence
S0510	oh okay
S0509	and it be kind of hard cos i be like well that one fit but that one could also kind of fit and if you don't know the exact definitions of things
S0510	right
S0509	you know they can trip you up a bite
S0510	right yeah
S0509	but i think i do okay cos lot of people be they be say erm that there be word on there that i'd never hear of before so i be just guess but i i i know most of the word

S0509	oh no
S0510	mm
S0509	yeah so there be that but i have my double drama as well they keep give us line to learn you wouldn't believe

S0510	mm
S0509	that i need to learn this weekend really and then one of them i'm do tuesday and one of them i'm do friday
S0510	right
S0509	and i'm gonna meet up with the tuesday one on monday because we need to figure out what we're do
S0509	the friday one probably won't be so bad cos we have more time to work on it
S0510	right
S0509	but then i've also get to try and learn this monologue for monday oh my gosh i've gotta learn it for monday
S0510	why what which one

S0510	right
S0509	but it's yeah it's hard to describe but it's mean to be like between two and three minutes so

S0509	go on
S0510	no i be gonna say talk about you know supermarkets and send things back and you know unexpected surprise do you see about erm there be something that make social media sort of last week erm get retweeted and you know bandy around the world i think it be either aldi's or lidl's probably aldi's about somebody that have get a packet of biscuits chocolate biscuits from aldi's and be you know absolutely as daddy would've be too you know devastate that there be a biscuit in there with no chocolate on it
S0510	i mean i think they be overdo it because it be only one biscuit it wasn't like the whole packet be not
S0509	yeah yeah i i when you be say this i be think
S0510	yeah
S0509	well maybe the whole packet just didn't have chocolate on

S0510	but the the guy erm that be the er the the owner of say packet erm post something about you know how disappoint he be and how it absolutely ruin his sunday morning and
S0510	you know i think he put it actually i think he put it on aldi's facebook page or their twitter page it must've be facebook cos there be quite a lot of text
S0509	right
S0510	erm and then how to sort of erm you know improve your customer relations aldi within about an hour of him post this and the packet and it be quite tongue in cheek what he be say about you know

S0509	i be gonna say surely he be be sarcastic
S0510	yeah erm they respond sort of in kind in sarcastic kind you know
S0510	but well not not not maybe not sarcastic but you know tongue in cheek anyway and just say you know well you know i think you're put the ordinary humble er digestive biscuit down you know it be actually a a superior biscuit
S0510	just because it didn't have chocolate on it there's no need to just you know sort of denigrate it because he he be quite scathing about the fact that it be just a plain old digestive and so they be like
S0509	this isn't just any digestive biscuit
S0510	yes quite so it's the wrong one
S0509	this be a pan fry

S0509	yeah
S0510	they they crowdfunded for that
S0509	oh right
S0510	i just i mean they it wasn't a huge amount of money
S0509	yeah
S0510	they just want to be able to cover their materials and everything
S0509	yeah yeah yeah no i've i'm very familiar with crowdfunding and crowdsourcing of
S0510	yeah
S0509	yeah lot of charity campaign do it like a lot of youtubers and
S0510	oh right
S0509	things like that will run
S0510	yeah
S0509	campaign and one author recently start do a campaign i can't remember what he be raise money for i think it be either a fresh water one or a or a refugee one
S0510	right
S0509	and it be erm he be just crowdfunding this stuff and with perk you know
S0510	right
S0509	at different level and
S0510	right uhu
S0509	but also erm like each ten thousand or whatever he'd have a different author who would match it as well so every time like people donate it get up to another ten thousand
S0510	yeah
S0509	an author would go i'll add another ten thousand
S0510	oh right
S0509	so that that be cool
S0510	and what be that for sorry the the actual
S0509	oh it be some charity i can't remember
S0510	right yeah
S0509	but it be bunch of author do it on twitter
S0510	oh fantastic
S0509	erm yeah i'm try to think oh and a lot a lot of youtubers crowd crowdsource their stuff especially a lot of the educational ones
S0510	oh right
S0509	they have sit er you've probably never hear of it patreon
S0510	no
S0509	but erm it that work slightly differently to normal crowdfunding but a lot of youtubers be on it who be create kind of very er high quality content like film and things like that
S0510	right yeah
S0509	and erm crash course with the vlogbrothers do which be like educational videos aim at
S0510	oh yeah oh
S0509	college students
S0510	and what so they crowdfund for that
S0509	yeah
S0510	put that oh i didn't know that
S0509	yeah yeah yeah they cos they when they start it they have a google grant to do it but then that money
S0510	google grant i didn't even know there be such a thing
S0509	yeah but then that money like run out after a
S0510	right
S0509	after a while and they be like we to carry on do it
S0510	yeah
S0509	we need your help and so you can donate to crash course but patreon
S0510	yeah
S0509	erm work differently so people will go erm for every bite of content that i make like if it's a musician
S0510	yeah
S0509	er for every song i make you will donate this amount and you choose which amount you want to donate could be like
S0510	right
S0509	fifty pence it could be like ten pound
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	and then they will offer sort of you will get a free download of each song that i do
S0510	right right
S0509	you or you'll get an early preview of my videos and that sort of thing
S0510	mm
S0509	which be interest but yeah
S0510	mm
S0509	there's erm one i be look at today even erm there's this thing call the harry potter alliance
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	which be this it's really really cool it's basically it's kind of like amnesty international in a way
S0509	like er that that just in the way that they they look at try to help a lot of different cause
S0510	right
S0509	equality wise mainly
S0510	okay
S0509	erm and it's basically start as a group of people who really like harry potter and they bond over this culture of you know different fan group
S0510	yeah
S0509	mainly around harry potter
S0510	yeah
S0509	and they use that to raise awareness and money for all these different cause they do this thing call accio book every year
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	erm where they get people to just send in book from everywhere and then they do a a like a library bus that go around and they donate book to like areas in need of book and that
S0510	oh fantastic
