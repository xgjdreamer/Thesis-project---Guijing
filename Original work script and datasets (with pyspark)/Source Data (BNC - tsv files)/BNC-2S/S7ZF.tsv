S0432	i know cos mum erm in the past she's so we use to do all use to go to mum's christmas day and dad's box day and like alternate it every year
S0428	yeah
S0432	so mum would cook a christmas dinner on the christmas day for us lot and then she'd do it again on the like she we end up just eat load of christmas dinners
S0428	you get like bore of it

S0428	yeah
S0432	like cheese and cheese and pineapple hedgehog do you ever use to have those
S0428	yeah
S0432	party ring
S0428	yeah
S0428	when i be uni erm in my final year we have this amaze house but there be a problem the landlord buy it and then we move in it be like all a bite rush and
S0432	yeah
S0428	i'm not really sure but anyway and he he take out the wrong mortgage so he didn't take out
S0432	oh no
S0428	cos there be there be something about like you you take a mortgage like buy to let
S0432	yeah
S0428	or like buy to live in but
S0432	yeah
S0428	you can do buy to live in and have like a certain number of people live in there and it be something to do with the number of floor the number of people and his mortgage
S0432	oh and that's where the like
S0428	yeah
S0432	the cutoff be for live or rent or something
S0428	i'm not sure yeah i've no idea but it be four floor and that's too many floor
S0428	so the council come round and be like one of you have to move out cos there be five of us
S0432	oh no
S0428	and we be like who be they gonna move out like that's really and then we be like well look they won't really know so we'll kind of pretend that someone's move out and whatever anyway
S0432	yeah
S0428	like we'll you know we be like this be terrible but there's nothing we can do but in the end the council like look it's not your fault like you can stay here for this year it just can't go on next year which be really nice cos
S0432	yeah and that's fine cos
S0428	yeah
S0432	you wouldn't've need it the next year anyway so
S0428	no and we didn't even we didn't know that that be how it have be rent that way
S0432	mm
S0428	we'd we you know we'd sign all the contract so in a way we'd do nothing wrong
S0432	mm
S0428	so it be kind of unfair that it be actually gonna hurt us more than
S0432	yeah
S0428	the landlord
S0432	as students you just presume everything's fine don't you
S0428	yeah
S0432	it's like yeah we'll have presume the landlord's kind of get everything else sort
S0428	yeah and then why i start talk about this
S0428	erm
S0432	yeah sorry
S0428	he buy the landlord be like really apologetic cos i don't think he i just don't think he he be aware of i dunno but he buy us this amaze m and s hamper
S0432	oh
S0428	and it be like full of like all these goodies there be this amaze smoke salmon you know like when you're a student and you have no money
S0432	yeah
S0428	i be like wow and there be like bottle of champagne and pickle and it
S0432	that's so good yeah yeah
S0428	it be the most incredible hamper and we be like we're angry but okay
S0432	we'll eat this
S0428	yeah
S0428	so yeah but i don't know if i think it be i don't know if they'd just go and like take load of food off m and s shelve or
S0432	yeah i think yeah i think yeah i don't know how there's like different things they kind of i i don't know i don't know if you can choose your own but that's quite a good idea isn't it like
S0428	yeah
S0432	if you get the basket and then you're allow to put like ten items or whatever
S0428	yeah i think that would work really well
S0432	yeah but add up to
S0428	yeah
S0432	i dunno erm
S0428	but
S0432	yeah and then she get like the ones that be like already and like make up little like tartlets and things i dunno
