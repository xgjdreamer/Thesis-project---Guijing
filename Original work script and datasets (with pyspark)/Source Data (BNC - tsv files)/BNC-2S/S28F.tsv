S0255	a week on monday yeah take everything away erm i've get fibroids which have be give me pain and i've so i've see the doctor on and off and they give me all these injections which basically it put you through to the end of the menopause
S0315	mm
S0255	and the idea be it might shrink the fibroids er short term or long term
S0315	right
S0255	but it didn't didn't help but it actually just stop and put me to the end of the menopause so my hormones just go i didn't realise the effect it would have on me so i end up be just er all over the place cry loss of memory er you know er
S0315	you're joke
S0255	and my dad have be really poorly and we lose him in may
S0315	oh i didn't know that
S0255	so oh yeah
S0315	i'm sorry
S0255	yeah yeah i know but er we'd know probably from december time i mean er the last couple of years or so it be almost like he's get to that stage it won't be long
S0315	yeah
S0255	he'd get so many bits wrong with him bless him and he be in and out of hospital and in the end we do palliative care at home and i so i stay with him the last week and we care for him er erm mum and i and all the
S0315	that's hard isn't it
S0255	er yeah it it be really hard but a couple of my sisters and that lot the family everyone come to see him cos we know it be that point you know get a hospital bed in for him erm so everyone come and have a bite of time with him
S0315	yeah
S0255	even when he be get so he couldn't really speak er you sort of know that he be he know you be know you know he know er you be there so everyone have a chance to talk to him say goodbye and so it be nice but it be really hard
S0315	yeah hard it's so the emotional
S0255	yeah
S0315	er you'd get with that it's just
S0255	yeah
S0315	well tenfold isn't it
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	so do he erm do he have er cancer or be he
S0255	well he have prostate cancer
S0315	right
S0255	erm but er he actually he be he have pneumonia quite badly on and off and he actually die they say it be er copd i think which be er like the lungs
S0315	yeah
S0255	so he couldn't breathe properly
S0315	mm
S0255	i mean he be oh eighty four so er
S0315	ah okay
S0255	you know and
S0315	yeah
S0255	he have major problems he have major stomach surgery erm a couple of about three years before that and they actually open up and weren't even sure what they could do and and er they be gonna take stuff out and they end up take out some of his intestine and join it up in a different way so he have a load of i mean he be always fit and healthy all his life and these last about three years he suddenly get old
S0255	and have all these things
S0315	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0315	so he'd really have a good life
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	with good health up to that point hadn't he
S0255	yeah
S0315	so he'd do really well hadn't he
S0255	yeah this be it so we have that so on top of all this menopausal stuff that i didn't even know i be just think it be that at work my boss be give me various problems at work as well which be to the state that they be say at work do i want to do grievance against her and i be just in tear all the time go i don't know i can't think straight i don't know what's go on and
S0255	so then obviously when my dad pass away i i leave it a weekish or so help mum sort the funeral help do this help do that go back to work and just totally break down so i be then sign off for a couple of weeks go back into work and totally break down again and they actually get occupational health involve and say er you know we need to help she's all over the place
S0315	mm
S0255	we don't we don't know what to do for the best and the occupational health woman be great and she she be the one that actually say all this stuff the way you've be this last six months be actually the menopause er because you've be put through to the end of it
S0255	and that's what's make you have all these things
S0315	so just hormones
S0255	and they yeah and
S0315	rag
S0255	yeah and they basically say a they have to do really basic admin at work where they give me something and pretty much say just type that up and we'll make sure you've type it okay there there dear i'll sit next to you while you do it which obviously they couldn't do or support me be off and work just say absolutely fine take be off make sure you stay with the doctor keep in touch with us erm but and occupational health say i need to have twelve weeks after the op er so the physical recovery's six to eight weeks
S0315	right
S0255	but they've say i need twelve weeks because they need my doctor manage me with
S0315	yeah
S0255	the hormones and i need to have
S0315	yeah
S0255	a fit to work to go back to work not just oh that's the standard time you'd expect
S0315	so will they take out everything then or
S0255	yeah
S0315	so will you have to be on a hormone replacement or anything like that
S0255	well the doctor's say i've gotta see her afterwards
S0315	yeah
S0255	i'd i'd rather not i'd rather manage however i end up be because potentially in a couple of weeks i could go right back to be how i be when i have the injections
S0315	mm
S0255	to be cry all the time er but she say if we look at manage how you be and get you through that rather than the hormone replacement because otherwise you've always gotta come off that at some point
S0315	yeah
S0255	which be gonna do so you've always get that loom so
S0315	yeah yeah yeah
S0255	yeah
S0315	so you've gotta try and see if you
S0255	yeah
S0315	can manage it yourself
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	i see
S0255	and i'm on
S0315	could you use alternative
S0255	well
S0315	remedy for that or
S0255	yeah er i mean i'm on er erm once we know it be the menopause i go into holland and barrett and i'm on even primrose oil
S0315	yeah
S0255	i'm take multivitamins because they say just generally that that's the vitamin d i think and er
S0315	yeah
S0255	and which help
S0315	and b and things
S0255	so i'm do i'm take those and that's stop like a lot of the night sweat and the hot flush which didn't bother me that much anyway but er the they've stop that
S0315	yeah
S0255	erm
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i'm actually on er an antidepressant that they give for people with the menopause
S0315	yeah
S0255	it's one they buy and they give it to people with ocd and stuff
S0315	mm hm mm hm
S0255	and that i'm on a real low dose but it actually be really help
S0315	good
S0255	so er
S0315	so do it stop the anxieties and things like that as well
S0255	yeah i think er it stop the huh all the time yeah
S0315	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0315	it's amaze what the menopause can
S0255	yeah
S0315	do to people
S0255	that's just saw the doctor this morning
S0315	really be
S0255	go in and just say to her look you know er i just er i know the operation's a week on monday but the last couple of weeks or so i feel like i just wanna kill
S0315	yeah
S0255	everybody
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i probably will kill half the world
S0315	yeah
S0255	not and i'm just seethe and i'm
S0315	yeah
S0255	i'm so hard find it so hard to be tolerant and i'm normally you know really
S0315	dead chill
S0255	yeah exactly i be and i help everyone and this be fine and no no no nothing's too much trouble but people be ask me certain like simple things and inside i'm think and because i don't let it out because that's not me er it's all stay in
S0315	keep it inside
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	do you find just cos obviously you know do you find that sometimes you go from really emotional and then to really like hyper and that kind of rag
S0255	not oh yeah the yeah
S0315	emotions
S0255	it's like see red
S0315	yeah
S0255	almost like red mist yeah it and and nothing and anything can set it off and i'm just i cos i say to you know be be i be snappy cos er i get such a good relationship with her i can just talk with anything
S0315	mm hm mm
S0255	and she say er you know for you er you be be a bite snappy but you er in the whole scale of people be snappy it's such a small thing that nobody would really notice it
S0315	mm
S0255	unless the apart from the people that know you
S0315	mm
S0255	but she say the last couple of weeks she say you can tell you er you're about ready to strangle someone
S0255	but you're not go to cos you wouldn't but actually
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	you know you can tell it's just really
S0315	yeah it's there
S0255	so that's one of the reason i think this the reflexology erm and i'm gonna the doctor say this morning look at some relaxation technique things
S0315	mm
S0255	and she say maybe talk to you as well
S0315	deep breathe
S0255	about
S0315	definitely
S0255	get some some things and i think maybe i dunno what you've get for next week but if there's if i can maybe come and do something else with you next week
S0315	yeah
S0255	whatever you think would be
S0315	that'd be good
S0255	and then i'll be as right as i can be
S0315	yeah for the treatment
S0255	go to the osteopath on friday cos you know with my neck and my back
S0315	yes
S0255	and 's away but i saw who be there
S0315	yeah
S0255	i've see her a couple of time and i say i just wanna be relax and line up and in er er i wanna get as ready as i can be
S0315	try and be as centre as you can
S0255	yeah before i go
S0315	get in the right right headspace i think isn't it
S0255	yeah yeah that's it
S0315	as well
S0255	yeah that's it
S0315	which obviously with reflexology this be what we can do
S0255	yeah
S0315	we can just help to rebalance the body
S0255	mm
S0315	let everything just work more in harmony with each other again
S0255	yeah
S0315	okay
S0255	yeah
S0315	with obviously you're aware of chakras aren't you er in the body
S0255	yeah
S0255	say something about get your your chakra and i think i be think shakira but that's the singer
S0255	but she chakra she go go and get your chakra
S0315	but if it if it's easy for you to think shakira then do it you know
S0255	yeah that's what i be think
S0315	that's more or less the same thing
S0255	then then i'll think of her shakira shakira
S0315	yeah
S0315	so you're gonna get
S0255	so
S0315	all of those rebalanced out again so what we're gonna do today
S0255	yeah
S0315	be we'll with do the reflexology treatment we'll do some deep breathe exercise as well
S0255	okay yeah
S0315	and then there's also something which i learn
S0255	mm
S0315	erm which i will tell you about at the end of the treatment to do
S0255	okay
S0315	and it's something which really will help to relax you
S0255	yeah
S0315	so when you're feel at the point where you be see red
S0255	yeah
S0315	i will give you some relaxation techniques to do
S0255	oh lovely yeah
S0315	to help reduce that
S0255	yeah
S0315	and to calm your breathe
S0255	yeah
S0315	and your body down
S0255	yeah that sound good
S0315	okay
S0255	yeah
S0315	so that's what we'll do i'll teach you how to do the treatment
S0255	just remind me what the shakira bits be as well the chakra bits cos
S0315	so with the chakras you've get your base chakra okay
S0255	mm
S0315	sometimes if this be out of alignment it can make everything be throw out
S0255	yeah
S0315	okay so your base chakra be red okay
S0255	mm hm
S0315	and then after that you've get your solar plexus
S0255	mm hm
S0315	which be orange and then you've get your erm stomach er no sorry you've get your reproductive organs which be orange and then you've get your erm solar plexus which be yellow
S0255	mm
S0315	which be around here this be where you keep a lot of your emotions
S0255	right yeah
S0315	okay and then you've get your erm heart chakra which be green
S0255	mm
S0315	then you've get your throat chakra which be blue
S0255	right
S0315	and then you've get your third eye chakra which be purple and then you've get your crown chakra which can be white gold silver
S0255	okay
S0315	anything call the higher self okay
S0255	yeah
S0315	so when these areas become out of sync with each other that's when they can throw certain areas
S0255	mm
S0315	out of you know tune with each other
S0255	yeah
S0315	cos that's sometimes why you sometimes do experience maybe pain in certain areas because they become block erm
S0255	right
S0315	and also experience certain emotions as well that be unbalance
S0255	right
S0315	okay
S0255	yeah
S0315	so erm just by do the reflexology treatment what we're do be help to stimulate the blood circulation all around the body again
S0255	yeah
S0315	okay and erm just help to erm relieve any blockages which be go through the meridian line which run all the way down the body and these meridian line
S0255	yeah
S0315	run all the way down the body and they link up with each other
S0255	right
S0315	okay
S0255	okay
S0315	so sometimes if you have a pain in your shoulder
S0255	yeah
S0315	sometimes it can show in your knee
S0255	right
S0315	because it's in the same zone
S0255	yeah okay
S0315	okay do you understand
S0255	yeah
S0315	yeah what i'm say
S0255	yeah it make sense
S0315	sometimes it's quite hard to
S0255	no
S0315	get the gist of erm so by do this treatment we're work on the top of the feet top of the toe all the way down to the bottom
S0255	mm
S0315	and just help to stimulate all these areas just to help everything unblock
S0255	yeah
S0315	and channel better
S0255	yeah okay
S0315	okay
S0255	that make sense yeah
S0315	so erm what we'll do first of all be we'll do some deep breathe before we start go into the treatment
S0255	mm hm
S0315	do some relaxation techniques on the feet to help relax those
S0255	yeah
S0315	and then i'll work on erm the right foot first and then i'll work on the leave foot afterwards
S0255	okay
S0315	okay cos i like to work on one foot at a time
S0255	yeah
S0315	and then at the end of the treatment erm i'll do some more relaxation on the feet
S0255	yeah
S0315	and then bring you round and just tell you about what i've find
S0255	okay
S0315	in your feet
S0255	yeah okay
S0315	and bring you round with a glass of water
S0255	yeah
S0315	so erm other than the antidepressant
S0255	yeah
S0315	be you on anything else
S0255	erm i i i have take a and i can't remember what it's call but it's er for ibs erm occasionally
S0315	oh right
S0255	yeah
S0315	yeah be it like buscopan
S0255	no it's erm it's a doctor prescribe one
S0315	oh okay
S0255	erm i i keep go to i know it's not diclofen it begin with a d
S0315	yeah
S0255	it's diclochloride something or other cos one
S0315	that stop the spasms do it
S0255	no it erm it's bloat it just
S0315	oh okay
S0255	er what i actually go to the doctor for in the first place about a year ago be my my stomach be just get bigger and bigger and
S0315	yeah
S0255	to literally er i mean er i know it's a little bite but it be like almost solid come out and i go to the doctor after so many months and sort of say er and she go oh yeah so they start do load of test to see what they think it be and this be when it turn out it be the fibroids but that wasn't what be do the stomach erm swell she and she think it be just ibs and it may well've be just with the stress
S0315	mm hm mm hm
S0255	erm so she give me some of these tablet's which i take before food
S0315	yeah
S0255	but not every day i just tend to you know take an odd one or two a day and it seem and if that's when i stop take them a few weeks ago my stomach start to get really extend again
S0315	do it
S0255	yeah so i think well i'll keep take them again
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i'm just hop that it's probably just the stress with

S0315	and then probably get a job somewhere else but he'd be look at a good pension that's the trouble
S0255	right
S0315	if you stay in the raf
S0255	so basically if he if he doesn't want to take the post he'd have to leave
S0315	he'd have to leave
S0255	really
S0315	unless they could try and accommodate him somewhere
S0255	mm
S0315	with some accommodation
S0255	so do they do they take into account the fact obviously that you've get your business as such or
S0315	mm not really
S0255	no
S0315	they kind of
S0255	cos they're er he's
S0315	post him where they've need him
S0255	yeah
S0315	i mean he could go to
S0255	yeah
S0315	erm it's about the same distance to drive as what he's do to every morning
S0255	mm
S0315	would be good but there's not really a lot that go on at
S0255	no
S0315	there's not really a job for him there really
S0255	no
S0315	but would be amaze
S0255	mm

S0255	oh be he
S0315	cos erm they've er redo the the er runway at so they're all have to work at
S0255	mm
S0315	at the moment
S0255	yeah
S0315	it depend which area he be cos he's where he's he's work really
S0255	mm so do he work on particular aircrafts
S0315	yeah
S0255	right
S0315	so it's wherever they need him to go
S0255	mm
S0315	they could turn round and go you're up at i'm not go there
S0255	at where
S0315	up in scotland
S0255	oh be it
S0315	back of beyond
S0255	yeah no
S0315	i'd hate that
S0255	no mm
S0315	's always have to work away isn't he
S0255	yeah
S0255	he have er erm a spell a while ago when he wasn't away which we actually have a bite of er an adjustment period of him be there all the time cos it
S0315	it's hard isn't it for you
S0255	yeah
S0315	i know what that's like
S0255	yeah exactly
S0255	cos it and i mean when they're not there you miss them
S0255	but you just you get use to your own time and
S0315	your own routine
S0255	yeah exactly and
S0315	you watch what you watch on telly
S0255	yeah exactly exactly and probably eat different stuff in a way not cos just cos he tend to eat some different things than we would you know so and i now we we make different things now when he's away
S0315	yeah
S0255	and we eat a lot of fish a lot of salmon although he's actually get a lot more into that if i've we've get him into that a bite more now
S0315	be he a bite of a meat and two veg man
S0255	yeah well er
S0255	well he like curry and he like erm you know so like a nice chicken thick casserole with chicken and veg and yeah all sort of things like that and er you know he'd er
S0315	stodgy stuff
S0255	yeah er he'll eat most stuff and he's on er he's on a bite of a try to lose weight at the minute
S0315	right
S0255	erm well no he's be try to lose weight on and off for most of his life i suppose for the last ten years or so but erm he's actually try to eat more salads and er and he's lose a stone he's so he's just over
S0315	have he
S0255	yeah he's just over seventeen stone now
S0315	well do him
S0255	cos he he'd go up to almost eight about eighteen stone and he that be like a bite of a oh god eighteen stone
S0315	yeah
S0255	that's big and i know he's a big heavyset
S0315	he be a big build man isn't he
S0255	yeah exactly so look at the actual you should be this weight or that weight if he be what they say he should be he would be far too thin
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	and actually yeah he be he's definitely overweight so he's
S0315	and it tell in the belly doesn't it
S0255	yeah this be it erm so he's be try to really to you know to to really cut back but do it a sensible way so we relax a bite at the weekend and have you know more er a couple of drink or so or ice cream or different things or takeaway occasionally but in the week he's er when he's when he's there er erm you know he have salad every lunch and then we have healthy just potatoes and not potatoes meat and just load of erm roast veg or
S0315	vegetables
S0255	stir fry or er so we we do that and as i say the the weight be come off and he get just under seventeen stone but cos the last few weeks or so he's be away again a lot it's
S0315	i suppose they're out eat and drink be they
S0255	well er yeah and the thing be er a lot of the time he's on his own there anyway but it's just it's
S0315	ah
S0255	hard he say if you go to a restaurant or you go to you eat in in the hotel yeah they usually have one salad or maybe two salads and you can't eat that every single night there's it's the menu it's not different
S0315	yeah yeah yeah
S0255	erm and cos you're bore and you go and you think well i'll have a beer before dinner or he have a glass of red wine with his dinner he wouldn't normally do that at home so
S0315	it's empty calories as well isn't it
S0255	yeah yeah and and he basically like i be say he's be there since mm probably june no yeah he be no he be away it must've be he be away mm oh he be work in when my dad be poorly
S0315	right
S0255	erm so he's be this year he's be away quite a lot but er he'd actually get erm he'd get down to just under seventeen
S0315	yeah
S0255	and he be more or less maintain it but he be like i'm not lose any i'm not lose any i say look as long as you don't put load on i say and even if you put a pound or so on because of the way you're have to eat at the moment
S0315	i mean he's active isn't he
S0255	yeah oh yeah i say at least as long as you don't get put the weight back on stay as you be and then when you're back at home again and more of a routine we'll go back to the salads and the the veggies and and that so he er he's up to about seventeen two at the minute
S0315	right
S0255	erm
S0315	so not bad then
S0255	no no so er erm
S0315	but if he's not careful it could creep back on again
S0255	yeah exactly cos there's somebody who's stay at the hotel now who's work there as well so they tend to have food together so then you know they get a bottle of wine between them so then actually they're have it's like you know a couple of glass every night rather than one glass and
S0315	yeah
S0255	and it's so easy for it all to creep back on isn't it
S0315	it's too easy to wanna drink it as soon as you have one glass
S0255	yeah
S0315	you want another i always find with wine
S0255	oh yeah exactly
S0315	don't you
S0255	yeah and because he we this place we've get in france now it will
S0315	you've get a place in france
S0255	yeah we buy a little studio er er for ski
S0315	oh nice
S0255	yeah
S0315	well you i'm not surprise cos you spend a lot of time there
S0255	exactly yeah and and the big chalet we use to rent all the time erm that he actually sell it
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	so we think well we need to look at get somewhere else and then we think or er maybe buy somewhere and we actually buy a little erm well it's just like a studio apartment but there's bunk bed in the hall as you go in
S0315	mm hm mm hm
S0255	erm and then it's just a studio room with a kitchen in it and a sofa bed and but yeah but no

S0255	go over we be gonna go in over this summer but what with my dad and me and one thing and another and be er away and
S0315	not have time
S0255	no exactly so we've not make it out there in the summer but go out he drive out and have a few days out there with a mate and his mate's son and they put a new kitchen in so cos we're do bits to it you know do it up a bite
S0315	do it up right yeah so it weren't
S0255	yeah so
S0315	er it be liveable but it obviously need a bite do to it
S0255	oh yeah yeah er it be fine but it be er it only have a few cupboards for the kitchen and then er a big wheelie thing that you could use as a top and
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	and that so yeah so it's it's really just erm we go out and and rip the old kitchen out so we've get er a decent fridge now there and erm we take out a microwave oven thing so that we can use a combination one
S0315	right so you can cook with that then if you want to
S0255	yeah er so when we be out last winter er you know like most of the cos you don't go out and eat every night when you're there a lot of the time it's different from be on holiday
S0315	be it expensive
S0255	erm yeah er well it's not too expensive but it's like at home you wouldn't eat out every night
S0315	no no
S0255	because er then it get more expensive than eat in so
S0315	yeah
S0255	we use to just chuck in chicken curry and cajun spice with a load of chop vegetables
S0315	lovely
S0255	just chuck it in this oven thing half an hour later or so and it'd be ready and
S0315	great
S0255	yeah so we use to sit and do that and and again when you're there we'd maybe have one beer one glass of wine with it but not lot
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	erm so
S0315	keep it to a minimum
S0255	yeah so as i be say cos i er when he go out he obviously come back with a van and load up with all the beer and the wine erm include like the box of wine which be real cheap
S0255	but it's really nice wine so we we get in the habit of just have a box of wine there all the time and just
S0315	just tip er top it up
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	as you do you don't you can't think what you're er drink can you then do that
S0255	no no this be it so now again we we try and be more careful so it's er i mean the fact he's away in the week i don't drink in the week now
S0315	yeah
S0255	but at weekend yeah we'll we'll have a couple of glass of wine or so and
S0315	i think if i didn't work in the even you know what i think i'd be terrible
S0255	mm
S0315	i think i'd always be have at least a glass or two
S0255	yeah oh yeah
S0315	cos when i be off last week i know i be off have be it last week that i be off i think the week er before that
S0255	mm
S0315	i be off for a week and we be have a drink every night
S0255	oh yeah
S0315	it's terrible
S0255	you get in the habit of it don't you
S0315	you do and it just go down too easily
S0255	yeah cos it's er they're say about this stoptober thing oh that's the smoke isn't it or stay sober for october and be say last night about it say well she can't think how it can work cos people that only go out at the weekend and have a couple of drink or so or if they're gonna stop that it's not actually that much and if you're drink every day who drink every day only alcoholics
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i say well actually not really i say there's so many people that get in from work now and will quite naturally in an even always have a glass of wine
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	or maybe two and you don't realise what you're actually drink
S0315	cos you could er actually be class as maybe an alcoholic couldn't you
S0255	well yeah yeah
S0315	when you think about it
S0255	this be it yeah this be it so
S0315	a lot of people come home from work they're that stress they crack open a bottle of wine
S0255	oh yeah exactly
S0315	and they drink it
S0255	yeah exactly and just general chat with friends which i've do you know er a lot over the years and you talk to people and actually you sometimes realise oh yeah and they've say actually yeah i do drink every night
S0315	mm
S0255	a couple of glass of wine and maybe a few more at the weekend cos friends'll be round we'll have a meal and you just don't realise how it's actually just all build up all the time
S0315	when you think if you be er to write it down i think you'd be shock how much you probably
S0255	yeah
S0315	be consume
S0255	yeah yeah so i'm see the point of this you know stay sober and not have any and but for me to do that and then they're say you're raise money for macmillan or for whoever but for me if you're gonna stop drink and then you get people to sponsor you or er that just seem really strange so
S0315	yeah yeah funny way of do it
S0255	i mean yeah i i can understand think actually i'm not gonna drink for the next so many weeks and just do that for my health and do this and do that
S0315	yeah
S0255	but it just seem a bite of a a strange concept to say to do that
S0315	it's like everything now innit they've all gotta do it for charity
S0255	yeah
S0315	ain't they
S0255	like the ice bucket challenge do you
S0315	yeah i didn't do it but
S0315	do you do it
S0255	yeah
S0315	do you
S0255	yeah i be nominate i i wasn't for
S0315	oh
S0255	age and age
S0315	and then you think i've get away with this ha ha
S0255	yeah
S0255	i do and then and then yeah someone nominate me and i be like oh okay when i go to do it i say to come and film me do it and er and everyone be all put on like jog bottom or sport stuff or things and i think no i'm just gonna you know i've get a maxi dress on and i think i'm just gonna be normal with my maxi dress
S0315	yeah
S0255	and so er i say to can you film me so i have a bucket of cold water and i get load and load of ice in a carrier bag
S0315	oh
S0255	i say and what i'll do when you start film i say i'll i'll tip all the ice in so we can see that there's lot of ice
S0315	yeah
S0255	so and i i say to him let me just practise get the bucket
S0315	oh
S0255	and do it but not actually put it on but with the cos i need to work out how to lift it and er and i get it there and i i be i go to no 's go no no mum you're gonna drop it on your face and er he say hold it like this so i be go right what about if er i wanna do it cos my arm be so little skinny and that and i'm just i couldn't lift er

S0315	yes absolutely

S0315	you need to take you need to take a step away cos otherwise
S0255	yeah
S0315	it all just get load on you

S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	when i have those
S0315	and do you not notice it that much
S0255	no
S0315	until the counsellor sort of say
S0255	no no just
S0315	she kinda maybe use you as a bite of more of a prop
S0255	yeah
S0315	yeah
S0255	yeah this be it and realise the whole relationship from be a baby and and all that and and and i because i'd realise it i then have to sort of relearn what i be do and step back and get her to more stand on her own feet
S0315	yes
S0255	without make a big thing about it erm
S0315	be your sister the same or
S0255	my sister oh my sister lean on me er erm

S0255	i always yeah and my brother and it's always i'm the family fixer i'm the one that sort everything i'm the one that
S0315	wonder why be you the oldest
S0255	yeah
S0315	and do you think that's why
S0255	yeah
S0315	really
S0255	yeah i think so mm
S0315	that's interest isn't it
S0255	yeah
S0315	because i mean so you it's like you have everything dump on you you're like the dump grind
S0255	this be it and and cos my my dad leave when i be six
S0315	yeah
S0255	so it be very much then that i be the one try to be strong and brave and er you know and obviously the way things be then when i be seven i be come home let the kid in from school and bring my get my sister from round the corner or all that sort of stuff and then we move when i be eight to and then er again i be bring them home from school make some tea do make sure they do this and that make sure
S0315	so where be your mum
S0255	she be work
S0315	she'd be work
S0255	yeah
S0315	you'd be like literally yeah
S0255	yeah so er
S0315	do everything else
S0255	in those days you do you know seven eight year old kid would be the ones who be look after the younger kid
S0315	yeah
S0255	whereas now er it's different
S0315	yeah
S0255	and you wouldn't
S0315	you'd be you be actually allow to be a child aren't you
S0255	er yeah exactly yeah
S0315	but then you be kind of see as a bite of a
S0255	yeah
S0315	erm
S0255	and er i be always old head on young shoulder and this and that and and it be just the way you know
S0315	you have to grow up quick didn't you really
S0255	yeah yeah i do and then go through teenage years and but mum be always very reliant on me not just for the look after and do this but but the emotional support and the erm just everything like use me as a sound board as she'd say and and it be and then i actually end up do everything the way i think she'd want me to do it because
S0315	right
S0255	er it go really deep with er you know this be what the counsellor help me see
S0315	how many weeks do you have worth of counsel
S0255	er oh about six months
S0315	do you
S0255	yeah
S0315	so you have a lot of stuff to get out
S0255	oh yeah yeah and really
S0315	and i suppose you own stuff as well
S0255	yeah this be it er i really have to work through it all er and this counsellor she be absolutely brilliant
S0315	you must've be exhaust after
S0255	yeah
S0315	every single session
S0255	it yeah it be really really hard and it just er but i get to a point where i actually and this be why when er you say you saw me then and i be just so sort and settle and happy and
S0315	oh you be just a different person
S0255	yeah yeah and because i have i'd find ways of make like me be more detach from how from my mum and for her to start have to do more herself and and it be er yeah it it be brilliant really liberate
S0315	and have it be better for her
S0255	er mm
S0315	that you have be do that
S0255	er i don't know i don't know really because er she's er she seriously need to go and get some counsel
S0315	yeah
S0255	because she's get a lot of hang up and a lot of problems and a lot of issue
S0315	mm mm hm
S0255	erm and even like the the me she have er a like a course with help with me that the government be fund
S0315	yeah
S0255	and the the woman who be do it actually say to her she she that perhaps she ought to go and get some counsel to sort out things
S0315	think it's manifest in her
S0255	yeah
S0315	and it's sort of
S0255	yeah
S0315	not make the me any better isn't it
S0255	yeah and i i actually go in to sort something out with the woman that be do it i have to i don't even know what it be but they want me to go in to sort something out about mum and she actually say to me i've be really try to persuade your mum to have some counsel i wonder if you could help me
S0315	mm
S0255	try and i say i've be say to her for years that she need to go even if just to let everything out
S0315	yeah
S0255	she need to go she's get so much stuff that she's carry around and it make her it it make her be who she be which really isn't her
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	you know but she won't
S0315	so she could be set free as well couldn't she
S0255	yeah but she won't she's er even when i've speak to her about it and er she won't absolutely adamant that she won't
S0315	do you think she doesn't wanna deal with it
S0255	yeah i think so and er and i think in a way the way she be she almost like be who she be be manipulative be
S0315	right
S0255	poor little me
S0315	i get you
S0255	be
S0315	bite of a victim in a way
S0255	yeah exactly and
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i think she like she quite like be the person she be she's so control
S0315	mm mm
S0255	that actually if she have the counsel she might let some stuff out and then not need to be so control
S0315	i see
S0255	and cos she's so control she like to be control for herself and for other people
S0315	yeah
S0255	and
S0315	yeah
S0255	so yeah it's it's it's a erm big mess that need sort but i don't think she will i don't think she will
S0315	she's a fool to herself
S0255	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0315	but like you say if she doesn't wanna change
S0255	yeah this be it erm
S0315	do she
S0255	and i'd get so i wouldn't play the game with her any more and i wouldn't do that and it be it be amaze and then obviously with dad be ill it it be it er change things a bite er but then with him obviously once he die it she i i make allowance for her and we get get back into that sort of routine
S0315	mm
S0255	and i have to really stop er
S0315	to yourself away again
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	could you feel yourself kinda get pull back in
S0255	yeah exactly and it's hard now
S0315	yeah
S0255	because obviously i'm all over the place i'm vulnerable so it'd be quite easy for us to go right back into that really destructive relationship and i'm not really strong enough in a way to stop it happen but i'm really try and that's probably make me less tolerant because i'm less
S0315	yeah
S0255	tolerant and er yeah it be er really hard
S0315	it's probably a good thing she isn't come up
S0255	yeah
S0315	isn't it
S0255	yeah
S0315	it probably do you a favour there didn't she
S0255	yeah i think so because er i've just i be just think oh i just yeah
S0315	you'll cope without her there
S0255	oh yeah i know i will cos i'm i you know i do i can get on with stuff and i'll be alright and like i say i've get a really good network of people that will help me
S0315	oh exactly you've get load of friends
S0255	yeah
S0315	haven't you
S0255	yeah exactly so i've get lot of support i know i'll be okay
S0315	yeah well definitely i wouldn't doubt that at all
S0255	yeah but i just need to i need to let her sort herself out a bite and
S0315	she sound like she doesn't mind her own company
S0255	no no no she well she do seriously really erm she could quite easily have be a nun she's very religious
S0315	be she
S0255	yeah and she could quite easily like have that lifestyle and
S0315	yeah
S0255	er just go off and be in a retreat somewhere
S0315	solitude
S0255	and i could see her be like that and just be that's just totally all er all sort of consume
S0315	mm self
S0255	just religion and the self and yeah and and she would actually then not be so control she could just be herself and i don't think she'll do it now but i mean she do say once you know yeah in years to come i might just disappear off to a retreat and would you think that be bad or wrong and i just say no you know if you felt that be what you want to do
S0315	mm mm
S0255	go and do it
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i could see her there i could i could see her be there
S0315	wow
S0255	mm
S0315	it's good that she's get a faith i suppose because
S0255	yeah
S0315	give people direction doesn't it
S0255	yeah she's er
S0315	something to
S0255	very very strong faith and she start every morning with her quiet time as she call it so she get up and i think she have er like a green tea or something or and then she go and sit and she just pray and she's get a couple of book with erm she's obviously get the bible
S0315	yeah
S0255	but just write and things and think and and she just sit and maybe read a bite of the bible and then pray and then she write down things er that that come to her while she's do that and that's her start to the day
S0315	wow
S0255	yeah
S0315	be you religious then
S0255	no
S0315	no no
S0255	no i sort of think that the the there may be something somewhere i think there's so much we can't explain
S0315	yeah i think so
S0255	i don't know how whether it's scientific or religious or you know whatever
S0315	it's how you you know it's what you believe yourself isn't it really
S0255	yeah
S0315	i think i i think there's something but whether it's god i dunno
S0255	yeah
S0315	but i believe there's a higher self you know
S0255	yeah
S0315	such but
S0255	and whether it's your consciousness or whether it's
S0315	yeah
S0255	overall or yeah you know we we must've come from something and
S0315	oh yeah
S0255	somehow and you know
S0315	there's some kind of
S0255	so yeah and and i believe that you know you can be aware of spirit after people have pass
S0315	oh yeah
S0255	and and definitely erm
S0315	well it's just things they start do when i mean we've have some quite freaky little instance since you know cos it take them a while
S0255	yeah
S0315	they reckon to come back through but
S0255	yes
S0315	specially with electricity
S0255	mm
S0315	things like tellies
S0255	yeah
S0315	telly turn itself on and off
S0255	yeah
S0315	you know things like
S0255	yeah
S0315	we'd be talk about my dad the next minute the telly'd come on
S0255	yeah
S0315	weird
S0255	oh wow that's yeah er er that's nice though
S0315	i don't know if you've have anything like that have you
S0255	no no no not that sort of stuff with me it's just i mean i i know my dad's there
S0315	yeah
S0255	but i haven't felt more like that but with sometimes you can just sense there's a presence there's somebody there
S0315	you can
S0255	yeah
S0315	it's er odd isn't it it's hard to describe because
S0255	mm
S0315	you do it's all of a sudden it's like they're here
S0255	mm yeah yeah
S0315	yeah hm
S0255	you know when you read hear people
S0315	comfort
S0255	you know when you when you hear sort of i dunno someone be say about must've be one of these things people put on facebook strange happen or something but er it might've be on the telly but they be say that erm people use to often say they above well they use to say they could see this lady float like beckon them or like arm out and
S0315	do they
S0255	this go on on and off for years and years and years and years and then they say that er at some point they have to actually drain the well for something and and the the skeleton of a young woman be find inside it so she'd obviously either be put in it or
S0315	yeah
S0255	or fell in i dunno
S0315	fell in
S0255	yeah
S0315	she be try to tell people
S0255	yeah she be
S0315	that she be there
S0255	i'm there help me i'm
S0315	so could rest
S0255	yeah yeah exactly and
S0315	crikey
S0255	you know i think it's fascinate
S0315	i believe in it completely i do
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	i'm a i'm a complete believer
S0255	mm
S0315	yeah
S0255	the other thing's when more when i be a kid more erm
S0315	they say you're more er er in tune with it
S0255	perceptive
S0315	when you're younger
S0255	yeah
S0315	don't they
S0255	yeah i have this one night i i be lay in bed and i sort of i i just felt like someone often use to be like somebody sit on the end of the bed i could feel the weight of them
S0315	do you
S0255	never any sort of scariness or anything like that but i know there be nobody there but
S0315	do you you'd look up and there would be nothing there
S0255	yeah there'd be nobody there but i could feel the end of the bed just er cos obviously you don't fill the full bed when you're a kid
S0315	yeah
S0255	the weight of somebody on the end of the bed
S0315	yeah
S0255	and then i always think oh maybe i'm imagine it and then a bite later i would feel you could actively feel it go up as they get off
S0255	so it's somebody obviously sit there just er
S0315	oh come to see you
S0255	yeah exactly yeah and then one night i keep see blue flash light blue flash light and and i'd think er oh and so i'm look out the window think oh it's probably a police car or you know no there be nothing there shut the curtain lay down again blue flash light blue flash light
S0315	oh
S0255	and i keep look and er and it be the night my great gran die
S0315	no
S0255	yeah and she be in a nurse home and she pass away in her sleep so there be no sirens or flash there be nothing like that at all but it be just it be such a coincidence and you think mm
S0315	how strange
S0255	yeah
S0315	like a kinda warn to say she's she's go
S0255	yeah yeah it be something really really really strange
S0315	huh
S0255	yeah i know
S0315	like you hear sometimes of people erm say that their love ones have visit er them before they're die
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	to say that you know to say to say come to say goodbye
S0255	yeah
S0315	it be er i remember the night my dad the day my dad die that night be just the worst ever i don't think i get any sleep
S0255	mm
S0315	just awful
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	i'll never forget that
S0255	yeah
S0315	dunno how my mum do it i really don't
S0255	no i don't my mum say in a way because he'd be so poorly and because i mean they be have carers in a couple of time a day
S0315	yeah
S0255	erm for the last so many months erm and for before that for the last two or three years before that she'd more or less be his carer all the medications and all the this and help with this and that and he be struggle to do more and more and she be have to do more and more for him erm so she say almost that person she be quite happy to have release him and let him go because that wasn't him
S0315	yeah
S0255	and she say a few time i'm not think about him as he be in the years before that because i can't cope with the think of lose that person yet
S0315	yes
S0255	but the person that's be so ill i can come to term with the fact that he's now go and he's in a better place
S0315	yeah
S0255	and because he be very religious too so
S0315	be he
S0255	yeah so for her you know i mean we actually find when when he when he's get so he be wasn't really able to talk or say a lot if he be get agitate or restless if you say the lord's prayer or even or probably start sing he say something about sing sing so we start sing hymn to him erm
S0315	to calm down

S0315	would he
S0255	he be actually when i be sing lord of all hopefulness and he start go he start like join in sing with me

S0255	yeah yeah that's it although i be sing and sing and sing and we actually think at one point cos he be so restless and we'd be tell this be one of the stag that just before he go he'd probably get really restless so he be really restless and we be sing and sing and we actually ring my sisters and say you need to come cos we think it be you know think that be probably gonna be it and and because we think he be gonna go before he they get there and we keep sing and sing and sing think just keep him go keep him go
S0315	yeah
S0255	and sing and sing and after a little er oh i dunno must've be about twenty minutes or so he suddenly go stop sing
S0315	do he do he i don't want this any more

S0255	mm well we er
S0315	that's good
S0255	sit cos with different people go in and out the room to be with him and other time we'd leave him just let him sleep and rest erm and quite often like the the nurse use to come in a couple of time a day and the macmillan ones do and erm so different ones come in and the district nurse at one point some of them come in and we be all just cos we be just laugh and chat and we start do crosswords and stuff like that and we be just roll with laughter and they'd come in and go
S0255	sorry and they'd go to be honest they say one of the last things to go be hear so
S0315	he'll hear
S0255	yeah so they say he'll he can hear you and if he's there in drift in and out of sleep and consciousness as such then and he hear you all laugh and chat that to him be the happy family home and that will actually make him happy so keep do that you know just carry on

S0315	how do your feet feel now
S0255	mm they feel lovely mm
S0315	we'll do some erm we'll do some erm chakra balance in a minute
S0255	yeah
S0315	so do some visualisation
S0255	okay
S0315	with the colour
S0255	yeah
S0315	and erm what i want you to do be visualise that colour
S0255	right
S0315	and visualise yourself and that colour go to that part of the body
S0255	yeah okay
S0315	okay so so i think we're gonna be visualise the colour red which be er erm base chakra
S0255	yeah
S0315	so if you think of big red ball
S0255	okay
S0315	so visualise that colour close your eye
S0255	mm
S0315	go down into the feet just surround all your feet if your be stand up surround all your feet with this lovely red
S0255	mm
S0315	bright red colour
S0255	wow just goose pimples all up and down all over
S0315	it's funny isn't it
S0255	yeah
S0315	it's lovely
S0255	yeah all tingly
S0315	and also another good one be be tree root
S0255	mm
S0315	grow out of your feet
S0255	yeah
S0315	plant themself into the grind ground you into the
S0255	that's a nice idea
S0315	into the earth
S0255	mm
S0315	okay so the next one be gonna do be orange and this be for the round the areas of your erm reproductive organs so if you think of a nice bright orange and orange surround all round that area all round your groin
S0255	mm
S0315	and the next colour we're gonna do be yellow so if you think of a big red yellow sun
S0255	mm
S0315	into your stomach area absorb in fill you lovely yellow tone and then the next colour be green this be for your heart chakra so if you visualise a lovely luscious green tree bright green leave absorb that colour into your heart and then the next colour be blue for the throat chakra so think of a lovely blue blue sky absorb that colour round your throat chakra and now we're gonna visualise purple and violet the third eye chakra so in the middle of your forehead just imagine lovely purple tone absorb through into your forehead and now we're last we're gonna do the crown chakra so i like to visualise silver and gold ribbons all flow in the wind or a halo of gold around the crown and then just imagine those tree root grow out of your feet plant themselves into the grind ground you back down to earth rebalancing that body centre everything so i'm gonna talk you through a relaxation technique now which i do so what i want what i want you to practise be breathe in for seven so as you're breathe in count in your head up to seven and then on the exhale breathe out but count down to eleven so ever so slowly just let that breath out and count to eleven they call it the seven eleven breathe technique and it's suppose to do something with the gas inside the brain and that's where the real action relaxation come in so whenever you're feel stress or overwhelm and you feel like you need to just calm down just remember your seven eleven breathe so just go somewhere quiet or even you you can get to the point where you can do it so well that you can just do it on the spot without even think about it
S0255	mm
S0315	and it really really help how do you feel
S0255	yeah good
S0315	how do you find that breathe
S0255	yeah it's er
S0315	yeah i always hold my hand on my tummy
S0255	mm
S0315	just around the solar plexus area
S0255	yeah
S0315	and then just yeah just er in my head i count to seven
S0255	yeah
S0315	so just let it go down really really slowly
S0255	mm
S0315	and i find i use to just go off and just do it practise it three time a day
S0255	yeah
S0315	and i use to just go off somewhere quiet and do it
S0255	yeah
S0315	and then i get to the point where get so much better at it that if i find myself get anxious or stress
S0255	mm
S0315	in any situation then i would i could just do it
S0255	you'd just do it
S0315	without even think about it
S0255	yeah
S0315	it'll just come
S0255	er that's a really good idea
S0315	really good and it's

S0315	and you find that all those little anxieties that you be have before you're not get
S0255	right

S0315	i have hear something that one of my customers be tell me cos she i think she'd need a hysterectomy cos she's so heavy with periods
S0255	mm
S0315	but apparently if they if if they can they try and defer it they try and get
S0255	oh yeah they
S0315	to not have them any more
S0255	they they they use to just do them at the drop of a hat
S0315	yeah
S0255	years and years ago and now they then they swing totally the other way whereas now yeah they don't just do them but if you need them
S0315	you have to have it do in your case
S0255	yeah and cos i i've i've get this permanent pain which and what they think it be be the the fibroids be like a couple of er couple of centimetres so it's not even a big one but they say they think it's just somehow press onto something towards in my back
S0315	right
S0255	and cos i'm get problems with my back the it's just it's on something and i've get this permanent like a bruise that someone's get a thumb push on it just push push push and that's why when you say about the thing with the bowel
S0315	yeah
S0255	i'm think oh god please don't let it be a problem with that instead of but
S0315	but i suppose he'll they'll go in and they'll
S0255	yeah
S0315	it could be attach itself to something
S0255	yeah
S0315	you just don't know do you
S0255	this it it could be yeah we're not sure exactly so she's gonna have a look around when she's in there and
S0315	yeah be it a female be it
S0255	well
S0315	surgeon
S0255	er my consultant's er a female

S0255	yeah this be it
S0315	and it's word of mouth isn't it
S0255	well it's like you say start to slow down but i still i can never seem to get er like when could i do this one when there's only two today wasn't there

S0255	and then next week now you're fully book
S0315	yeah
S0255	and
S0315	i mean i i work try to work four days a week if i can
S0255	yeah
S0315	i work every even
S0255	yeah
S0315	as well so they're always full
S0255	mm
S0315	even tend to go first
S0255	yeah
S0315	so
S0255	have you get somebody else that's here with you now as well though do you cos you be look for someone
S0315	i be look for someone yeah
S0255	yeah cos i share it didn't i but
S0315	never have never find anyone
S0255	yeah i find that with
S0315	i interview two or three but
S0255	where they be they're er cos they've get the spare room that they're in it's
S0315	yeah
S0255	they've build er like an extension end and a bite more in there
S0315	oh have they
S0255	yeah do that a little while ago and they've get er a spare room which so they've get two treatment room
S0315	yeah
S0255	and they've get a nail room so or what could be a nail room or could be something but they have somebody go and do it for a little while and then she's she leave and didn't come back
S0315	she go
S0255	so get the the hairdressing and that but there's a room
S0315	so they can't find anyone either
S0255	no no it's and every now and then they sort of go oh there's you know there's a room available but
S0315	it's so hard to find somebody
S0255	yeah well this they be say people expect to come and get pay a wage
S0315	yeah
S0255	whereas you want people to come and bring the custom and build the client base and they
S0315	you do they don't wanna do it
S0255	you know you rent the room you rent yeah
S0315	they don't wanna put the hard work in
S0255	no no this be it
S0315	half of the time
S0255	no
S0315	or you find that you get somebody who's do a bite of mobile and isn't prepare to give you part of the
S0255	yeah
S0315	they wanna come in they wanna use your ground
S0255	yeah
S0315	they wanna use your stuff
S0255	yeah
S0315	but they don't wanna pay you any money towards it
S0255	no
S0315	and you're look at at least fifty fifty for that
S0255	yeah oh yeah
S0315	cos electricity water
S0255	yeah well exactly
S0315	stock
S0255	yeah
S0315	cost a fortune
S0255	yeah
S0315	but they only wanna give you something like twenty percent
S0255	mm no this be it
S0315	i don't think so
S0255	no no
S0315	oh er but i'll just i just can't find anybody
S0255	no
S0315	i've interview three people but again they've get no one to bring with them which would be handy
S0255	yeah
S0315	because if you're start from scratch you you gotta realise you're not actually earn anything
S0255	and you don't wanna be give them your customers and it's not you know
S0315	this be it
S0255	and er the thing be even if you're fully book you don't want to start say oh well go to the other person cos then they might stay with them
S0315	won't come back
S0255	and then you don't get them back yeah
S0315	yeah
S0255	exactly and then they might leave and take half your customers
S0315	yeah so you could end up you know do yourself
S0255	mm
S0315	a bite of a
S0255	yeah disservice
S0315	yeah so you gotta be careful
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	you you don't know who you can trust do you these days
S0255	no no that's it
S0315	so
S0255	mm
S0315	maybe sometimes i think to myself well should i just stay as i be cos i only end up pay more tax that way
S0255	yeah
S0315	shall i just stay as i be but if the right person come along then
S0255	mm
S0315	just gonna wait and see
