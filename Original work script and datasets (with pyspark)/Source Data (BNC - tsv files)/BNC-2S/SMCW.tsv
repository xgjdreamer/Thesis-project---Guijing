S0281	there we go okay so
S0307	yeah
S0281	we're record so what be we talk about
S0281	oh yeah erm foods that erm er break down er what acids
S0307	yeah alkaline
S0281	alkaline
S0307	lanising alkaline foods i don't know how you say it alkaline foods
S0281	mm
S0307	so you have some acidic and alkaline foods and basically you think that the ones that be acidic by nature like like lemons
S0281	mm
S0307	be go to create an alkaline reaction in the body but an an acid acidic reaction in the body but it's the opposite
S0281	ah
S0307	yeah
S0281	okay
S0307	so er lemon juice in any juice enhance the properties
S0281	yes
S0307	the alkaline properties
S0281	right
S0307	of the of the juice but don't mix different fruit
S0281	no
S0307	just
S0281	well i
S0307	one type you can mix vegetables but you can't mix fruit
S0281	get so much fruit at home it's most of it's gonna be waste because erm
S0307	well the good thing be if you're make juice it can be old fruit it can be very ripe
S0281	well i haven't get i haven't to a juicer
S0307	well some
S0281	but er
S0307	what which fruit have you get
S0281	oh you name it we're get it cos erm 's be er her best friend's husband's in hospital you know like have this cyst take out on an arm here
S0307	yeah
S0281	and he have one take out of his back the other day and she's be get up early in the morning and take her friend to the hospital
S0307	okay
S0281	er organise food and she's be look after them and er she's be up look after her own family
S0307	oh
S0281	but erm
S0307	oh
S0281	yeah so but and they've give her lot of fruit you know cos people obviously take fruit to hospital and erm we've get all this fruit at home and and before that the husband i think before he go into hospital he buy us a whole tray of kiwis erm the biggest bunch of bananas you ever see
S0307	mm
S0281	erm er a huge bunch of grapes er and
S0307	okay
S0281	and now you know you know these fruit baskets that people buy
S0307	yeah
S0281	so they have a we we've get one of those today erm i say er er you've gotta give it to somebody else we're never go to go to eat
S0307	yeah
S0281	all this stuff
S0307	well the good thing be er there be a couple of things you can do with the kiwis there be load of fruit that you've just mention that can be blend without have a fruit smoothie maker without have a a juicer
S0281	oh
S0307	soft fruit you don't need a juicer you just need to add water or coconut water or milk but i don't drink milk so you can
S0281	no we're we're not allow to either
S0307	you're not a milk people
S0281	well i can't
S0307	coconut water
S0281	can't
S0307	or normal water
S0281	oh
S0307	and you add that and then the fruit blend anyway if it's bananas kiwis mangoes blend quite well dragon fruit blend really well
S0281	just mix with water and lemon juice
S0307	yeah and and a blender and a normal blender
S0281	well i haven't get a blender
S0307	oh god you need blender
S0281	oh
S0307	who doesn't have a blender
S0281	i don't
S0307	you need one

S0307	yeah i don't have a spare erm
S0281	ah don't worry about it it's not worth it
S0307	well anyway with the kiwis then you can make a pulp and you can freeze it
S0281	mm ah
S0307	no that's okay you can freeze it and then when you have er you can either make ice lollies with it you can freeze it as a puree and then add it to things later
S0281	in when we do have a a a blender we we never use it so

S0307	i think it would be interest
S0281	you have to be very good at type
S0307	mm
S0281	mm
S0307	i've do discourse analysis for my
S0281	just have another vision from the past
S0281	oh i i i use to when i first start work erm mm i work in a bank and erm i hat it and mm i want to go to university but i never take any a level so i find out that erm they accept oncs
S0307	mm
S0281	and erm that's how i go to loughborough yeah
S0307	you go to loughborough uni
S0281	no no well i do for an interview
S0307	do you
S0281	yeah so i use to work during the day after i leave the bank they they be always just push us to erm take bank exams
S0307	mm
S0281	and erm but at the same time just keep us on bore trivial job as work an ncr32 machine it be so bore
S0307	yeah
S0281	so anyway they keep take and right you've gotta go and do your exams etcetera but in the end i do i be i end up do a very similar course to the bank exams erm for business study erm
S0307	okay
S0281	and i be er anyway i digress
S0281	in the erm bank technical college where i use to go they have load of different course and there be er one be type and so all these girls you know only girls of course learn how to type
S0307	mm
S0281	i don't know if they do that any more these days do they
S0307	erm i think so cos the people do it in the courtroom don't they
S0281	stenographers
S0307	stenographer yeah
S0281	mm
S0307	and also with book people do it i think famous writers have stenographers sometimes
S0281	mm
S0307	mm i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's still around why be it only women it's just so it seem
S0281	dexterity
S0307	a really girly thing to do
S0281	well i mean it a practical aspect men's finger be thicker and fatter yeah
S0281	and women be more nimble agile you know especially with their finger
S0281	er
S0281	er i suppose it's that and also for some reason they're much better with repetitive work well i suppose if if you look at type that's what it be
S0307	mm
S0281	yeah so that's why apart from the low pay that they always use to get in factories lower pay erm they use to work quicker than men
S0307	yeah
S0281	you know just put part a into part b or put something into a box or or whatever use to be so much quicker and it be true you know i be talk about these horrible machine that we have to use in the back remember this be the day of computers be only use in head offices or company you know and they they be huge box with spool go round so i never i mean i'd hear of computers but nobody have ever ever see one
S0307	yeah
S0281	and erm so in those days erm what i have to do stop me if i'm bore you
S0307	no you're not
S0281	be you arrive at the bank in the morning suppose to start work at about nine o'clock and the first thing we have to do be open the post because all the cheque that have be draw by our customers have be send to a local central office or well the erm or the head office whatever there be clear centre and they all all get sort out and they all get ship off send post erm to the bank from which they be issue or the customer have issue so every morning you use to get the post
S0307	mm
S0281	as it be call so we have to open them and then we have er compartments erm a and i all still remember them a to e er f to hand heart to j k for erm er erm we have to put them er sort them into these box accord to er surname and our customers and then we all have certain section to post it call post now it be all base on a double entry system for every debit there's a credit and nobody could leave at the end of the day until the and they're call have be balance
S0307	okay
S0281	so all the total of the debit equal the total of the credit
S0307	okay
S0281	and we start off with the statements and the statements be er no the ledgers the ledgers be the bank's copy of the transaction so we use to go and get our well i don't know what you call it ledger or something put it there next to our machine sit down with our machine look at the first cheque say it be erm brown er aj brown and then we'd go to the er ledger
S0307	mm
S0281	pull out put it in type in the balance pick up the balance go to whether it's a cheque debit or a credit and the put the amount in and then like total and out well it would come and then put it back and this be what we do tap onto
S0281	can you imagine do this all day
S0307	mm
S0281	and then we have to do
S0307	bloody bore
S0281	and then we well it be it wasn't too bad if you make a mistake on the ledgers you could just you know put in the right amount but when it come to do the customer's coffee copy for statements if you make a mistake there you have to do what's call a retype cos the it have to be perfect
S0307	mm
S0281	and do this bore repetitive job you know the girls be always much faster than i be
S0307	mm
S0281	always
S0307	where be this
S0281	in
S0307	god
S0281	barclays bank it's still there
S0307	so you use to work for barclays bank

S0281	and i think those days there be no contact because they they'd declare udi you know their sort of declaration of independence so i think
S0307	yeah
S0281	that they're completely break with the uk
S0307	yeah
S0281	but apparently not
S0307	yeah
S0281	the record get find their way back to the uk and they're still there
S0307	wow
S0281	yeah so when i i get this message from this centre mm from the police say can you phone us urgently and they say er have you ever be convict of any criminal offence and i say no
S0281	and she say well be you sure mm don't think so she say well do rhodesia ring a bell
S0307	oh god
S0281	i go oh my god
S0281	so yeah so that's gonna be the title of my book
S0307	yeah
S0281	do rhodesia ring a bell
S0307	that's good
S0281	mm but i don't think i'll ever get round to write it
S0307	you might have you hear of er julia cameron
S0281	no
S0307	the artist's way i have her audio book if you want to listen to it but i've get the book here as well
S0281	mm
S0307	she say it's er actually her it's martin scorsese's second wife she write a lot of stuff with him she say that creativity be a spiritual path and she do this thing she teach this thing call the morning page where you get people where people do a kind of meditation where they write three page in the morning every day hand write
S0281	oh
S0307	as a kind of empty of the mind
S0281	mm
S0307	and er she say you know two of those page will be rubbish but maybe one be good and a book
S0281	mm
S0307	be write over a year
S0281	mm
S0307	a little bite every day so she say you know that be a book at the end of it
S0281	it's all cathartic
S0307	yes absolutely that's the the the idea it's that er it's a process not an end result erm and actually in spirituality creatively be the highest form of be er the the crown the the crown chakra sahasrara that be associate to creativity
S0281	mm
S0307	and service to others so charity work be also in there but the be truly creative be be er er completely free
S0281	mm
S0307	so it's a really good thing to practice for yourself you know but obviously if you wanna write
S0281	well
S0307	your memoirs or you book that's great as well
S0281	mm
S0307	it's quite interest
S0281	i've think about it once and mm say er i say to well maybe i should you know learn how to write first
S0307	
S0281	yeah
S0307	no what do you mean learn how to write what do that mean
S0281	well you know you when you write a a novel or a autobiography or whatever you've gotta know how to write
S0307	well i've have this conversation with er many time yes and no i mean if you're an experience reader as in you read a lot of literature you already have a better understand
S0281	mm
S0307	of how to er grab the the reader's attention how to create a climax how to you know do all these things how to create interest how to
S0281	mm
S0307	describe things how to write a dialogue how to express feel of course you have a better understand of that if you read a lot
S0281	although
S0307	and of course and you you have a better understand of what's original or not if you read a lot
S0281	mm
S0307	but i just think that actually people when they write a book they be empty their mind
S0281	mm
S0307	even if it's fiction erm so you could as just as well speak into a dictaphone and have an amaze book it doesn't have to be er er you don't have to be an er creative writer in that way you know
S0281	mm
S0307	sometimes the ideas and the concepts speak for themselves and the language be simplistic
S0281	well the thing need to be plan
S0307	load of writers have write like that
S0281	no
S0307	well yes and no but er not many book you know there there be load of movements like er okay george orwell be know to be a rather scientific writer the ideas be complex but the way he write be quite simplistic and in scientific in a in a way you know
S0281	mm
S0307	and then you have writers kind of er oh i can't remember what period now post expressionism maybe what be it call the period in write anyway that be a trail of think no begin end bullshit you know no this be the start of the story this be the end of the story
S0281	mm
S0307	stream of consciousness trail of think oh jam joyce be one of those
S0281	mm
S0307	er load of writers er very very highly acclaim writers didn't write in a chronological way didn't write with order didn't even write with a proper story in mind you know it be kind of stream of consciousness and that's okay too you know and some writers er be really flowery and they spend ten page describe a door like umberto eco and others don't and they're both good
S0281	very nice thank you
S0307	oh you're welcome they're very healthy for your heart that be
S0281	mm
S0307	heart healthy you should make actually do you have a rice cooker definitely
S0281	yeah
S0307	yeah cos 's chinese
S0281	mm
S0307	you have a rice cooker every day
S0281	in every way
S0307	oh yes make er rice and bean mung bean or
S0281	mm
S0307	red bean or black bean you can get them here really easily but actually any bean you want er the mung bean be really good for you
S0281	have beens
S0307	which ones have beens ah silly see there's a book in you
S0281	have be all those
S0307	and and put herbs salt er pepper any kind of leave you want
S0281	oh
S0307	galangal root anything
S0281	that's very
S0307	and steam it and keep it on the heat and er eat that that's a really good cleanse really healthy and you don't just have to eat it on its own you can eat it like this like a salad
S0281	mm
S0307	and mix it with leave and it's call kitchari it's an indian cleanse
S0281	oh really
S0307	yeah bean and rice one of the healthiest things you can eat
S0281	right i shall try and do that
S0307	no oil don't need oil
S0281	no
S0307	because you you
S0281	that's
S0307	you season it with the you can use raw oil a little bite of raw olive oil be okay but no cook oil
S0281	i think that be the thing that actually erm push my pancreas over the limit
S0307	the oil
S0281	yeah
S0307	yeah it's horrific
S0281	cos er
S0307	the oil use in food
S0281	i i remember i make myself this huge salad which i think oh this be healthy
S0307	mm yeah
S0281	put load of olive oil on and er maybe it be too much well i'm sure it be too much erm er in in quantity you know the the size of the salad plus too much olive oil
S0307	mm
S0281	and it be shortly after that that i complain about er have stomach pain
S0307	but what do you put in the salad
S0281	oh i mean it be lettuce tomatoes onions
S0307	no other thing
S0281	no and bean well whatever you know it be
S0307	the other thing that's er hard on the stomach be mix proteins you can see i only eat one type in every meal
S0281	mm
S0307	that be only one type you only have bean you didn't have bean and cheese and egg you have
S0281	well i don't anyway
S0307	no but i mean don't mix proteins
S0281	oh
S0307	it's too much effort for the for the body to break down
S0281	well erm i certainly at the the way i feel at the moment be fine
S0307	yeah
S0281	no erm no after effect at all oh i didn't finish my story about the
S0281	the bank i rhodesia
S0307	yeah
S0281	and er in er in umtali it be a literally a border town you know erm there be a couple of sub branch out in the bush
S0307	mm
S0281	and we use the land rover and have an african driver
S0307	mm
S0281	and a and we use to go out to erm this er well just a concrete build in the middle of nowhere and people use to come and do their bank but one of the things be that er i be force to carry a gun

S0281	i don't suppose it's for insurance possibly policies
S0307	mm
S0281	bank rule or whatever crazy
S0307	mm

S0281	well i be due to
S0307	in rhodesia

S0281	how young
S0281	mm my father when i be about eleven or twelve and my mother a couple of years later

S0307	yeah
S0281	you know this er no it's the nineteen seventy you know so it's erm
S0281	and everybody have long hair and all the rest of it
S0307	yeah

S0307	mm
S0281	with a power bulge in the bonnet you know and er his idea he's gonna buy this and take it out to rhodesia because of their sanction in those days cos they'd declare udi and he have plan to bust the sanction take the car there sell it at a profit and bob your uncle
S0307	yeah
S0281	and he persuade me that this be a great idea and there be nobody there to give me any advice
S0307	oh
S0281	so be young irresponsible and adventurous
S0281	er i say yeah okay so i go to see and say yeah i'll sell you the house so after the mortgage be pay off er i buy this triumph gt6 and i remember the day i walk into the showrooms in western road and this this young guy with long hair you know and probably the salesman think oh god what what do you want you know to just test drive something and say i wanna buy that
S0281	and it be it be just over a thousand pound well actually it be thirteen hundred pound but if you export it you didn't have to pay tax
S0307	okay
S0281	so but a thousand pound in those days
S0307	that's a lot of money
S0281	it be a lot of money it be a lot of money and erm the thing be erm i go for a drive in it when i get it and think fuck i can't drive this you know
S0281	i be along the seafront and the the you know it's too fast
S0281	oh my god er anyway it be too late by this time and then i er well i find out that i couldn't get fully comprehensive insurance cos i be under twenty five
S0307	yeah
S0281	so i could only get third party fire and theft
S0307	yeah
S0281	and then er roger have the idea he say well erm this be the plan we're go to drive across europe i've get some friends in germany and this be in winter we set off in february i think it be and erm we drive well he cos he say well where be we gonna stay in a hotel he say no no we'll buy a small caravan
