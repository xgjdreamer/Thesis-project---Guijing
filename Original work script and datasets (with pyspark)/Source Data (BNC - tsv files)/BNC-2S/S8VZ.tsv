S0208	can never ever
S0202	i've never try to learn to be honest
S0208	you should erm try some of the thank oh actually no because it's too you need a guitar to do that
S0202	mm
S0208	i be go to say go on youtube and like try some of the self tutorials i've try some of those and like if i watch it i can do it but then as soon as i go away or shut down the youtube video or something forget everything
S0202	mm
S0208	just sit there look at it like what do i do with this
S0202	there's this theory and it's basically if you do ten thousand hours of something you'll become you'll be an expert at it
S0208	really
S0202	yeah like my friend be tell me and like it's just basically as simple as it be if you put ten thousand hours into something you'll be you'll be able to do it and be an expert at it
S0208	hm
S0202	right i don't who that be but
S0208	that's interest though i guess you'd have to do it pretty much full time cos if you think about it ten thousand hours if if you're do like an hour a week there's no way you'd become an expert
S0202	no
S0208	maybe ten thousand consecutive hours
S0202	mm i don't know
S0208	i don't know like i really love music and everything i really enjoy it but i really be just no good at it
S0202	ah i'm no good at sing oh i'm good at learn instrument like we use to be able to play piano when i be a kid but i never keep it up so
S0208	that's cool ah i be the same i use to do piano lessons and then like just stop when i move to but then i lose everything like i can't even read music any more
S0202	you do don't you yeah i use to be able to read music but i can't any more
S0208	it's not like rid a bike when you just get on it and remember everything
S0202	no
S0208	unfortunately
S0202	it's one of them things that if you don't keep it up you just you just forget how to do it don't you
S0208	it's really annoy though cos i use to love it and like but it be different in england like the way they do the music class like it be so different because when i take up drum when i when i come here erm quite a few years ago now like i still have to do the note read next to it and it be two separate class so it be an hour of drum lessons in a week and then another hour of read music like sheet music
S0202	mm
S0208	i be like i'm sorry that's not go to help me at all i'd rather have an extra hour play drum and they be like no you have to
S0202	i use to do two three hours a week of piano lessons and then two hours a week music read
S0208	i just find it stupid i understand for things where you need to read music but it's like the drum sheet music you have like three colour it be the same principle like the ones that be black be one beat the ones that be white in the middle two beat like et cetera et cetera be the same thing
S0202	mm
S0208	and i be just like i don't need to sit through an hour but like i really hat the teacher as well he look like an owl and he have like a monobrow and he be so cruel and i'd never practice because i fuck hat it like literally i'd dread that lesson and it would he'd put on like one of those metronome things
S0202	mm
S0208	and you'd have to read it and then bite by bite you'd have to sing so that you'd learn to recognise it and i know that's a really good skill to have but it piss me off so much i stop
S0202	yeah i'd love to learn how to play guitar fuck oh my god she's so spoil she eh she mention to her dad that she want she she'd fancy learn how to play the guitar so go out and buy her a guitar
S0208	jesus wow
S0202	it's how fuck spoil she be he literally just go out and buy her a guitar like a brand new six hundred pound guitar
S0208	shit
S0202	be so piss off cos 's be learn age to play guitar
S0208	yeah
S0202	and she save up for age to buy herself a guitar and then obviously get jealous that be do something that she couldn't do so she just mention to daddy that she want one and he go out and get it get her it
S0208	why don't you just suggest to like i'm quite interest in learn guitar would you be happy if i borrow in every now and then
S0202	no i'm not
S0208	cos you could use hers
S0202	i'm not give her that fuck pleasure
S0208	well my uncle
S0202	it would be an opportunity for her to brag and be like look what i can do and i'm do it so much faster than you like if i'm go to learn i would tell her that i be learn
S0208	right
S0202	because she'd just gloat like look how much better i be than you and just i'd rather not get into it's not a competition do you know what i mean i don't want it to become that like
S0208	yeah that's what it use to be like with and piano cos like she i do music like piano lessons when i be really young like when i live in england and i stop because i didn't well i cos move here but i keep play but like just learn songs that i want to learn
S0202	mm
S0208	so i'd go on youtube tutorials or i'd just listen to a song and just try and pick it up it be just for fun
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm start do eh piano lessons so i be like oh i use to play piano we should like do stuff together so we do and it be genuinely really fun and like we use to do music and stuff but then at school like when we be do music and like we be allow to use instrument and stuff and she would always like one up
S0202	yeah
S0208	she always have to and like i tell her i be learn this song it's like a river flow in you by that chinese guy i don't remember his name
S0202	mm
S0208	really beautiful and i be really struggle to learn it cos obviously i couldn't really read the music or anything so i be sort of learn learn slowly and it be when be still live here and he's erm he's actually amaze
S0202	mm
S0208	he can listen to a song and just play it
S0202	really
S0208	and if yeah he teach himself pirate of the caribbean the whole way through just from listen to it
S0208	i know so jealous but erm he be the one that start teach me that's why like i learn a bite and then in music cos everyone would sort of do what they want and i be just show and i be like this be a song i really want to learn i be like i'm struggle obviously it's not very pretty but i show her the begin next week when we have music she come back and she play it all like perfectly and everyone be like oh my god you're so amaze
S0202	yeah
S0208	i be just sit there like oh i don't want to learn it any more
S0202	it ruin it doesn't it like that's
S0208	it it really do it's so petty but it do it do for a ruin it for you it take the fun out
S0202	yeah and that's why and that's why i don't want to tell that if i do start learn guitar i don't want to tell her i don't want to let her know because it'll be turn into a competition i don't want it to turn into a competition like i want to learn guitar i've always want to learn guitar and it's not get anything to do with her or anyone else but i don't want it to turn into that and like i want to learn at my pace and enjoy learn
S0208	no
S0202	instead of it be like all the i've just learn like you can't do it so i'm better than you
S0208	mm that's why i like do music with because there's nothing competitive at all in there
S0202	yeah
S0208	and like erm there be something she want to do by bombay bicycle club that i didn't really know and she teach me because like i listen to it a few time and then we try sing it and do harmonies but like my tempo be wrong
S0202	mm
S0208	because i didn't know it very well and it wasn't at all patronise or rude or anything the way she be do it she just teach me it and then we do it together
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it wasn't a
S0202	it's much more fun like that though right
S0208	exactly exactly
S0202	it's so much more fun learn together and like say well you don't know how to do this but i do and i don't know how to do this but you do so let's just learn together let's just teach each each other things let's grow with each other
S0208	exactly
S0202	and it not be a competition
S0208	and that's what we'd always use to do and like lately because she's be teach herself guitar a little bite she do the song on guitar and like we do the harmonies and we we like kind of perfect it and like it be like our song that we be do we want to film it but we just never get around to do it
S0202	mm
S0208	like to put on youtube or something but it be just it be fun and easy and she suggest to me she's like oh do you want to do some music i'm like yeah okay it's not like she's so much better than me though
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's not like i can play guitar and you can't so watch me play it's
S0202	yeah yeah and i hate that like that's why i think that's why me and have grow apart because that's what it turn into in the end because like when we be talk about essay and talk about what we be write about and stuff like that like it turn into that and i just like i'm not interest in have a conversation with you like i'm here to do a degree you're here to do the same degree it doesn't have to be a competition
S0208	yeah
S0202	like
S0208	do i tell you about me and have i tell you that about her parent and stuff
S0202	about what
S0208	like how well it's it's not her parent it's my mum more than anything and her parent quite a lot that sorry i be quite a good student like i enjoy do it and get good mark like for myself
S0202	yeah
S0208	and like for my overall year grade and stuff and she be the same like we be both quite ambitious and drive and stuff but my mum and her parent would always turn everything into a competition like literally it be awful like i'd get say seventeen in an exam and would get a fourteen or something and her parent would be like oh get this like why didn't you do better sort of thing but vice versa so if i didn't do as good as my mum would be like oh tell me that get an eighteen isn't that fantastic you could've do that and i'd just be like i'm sorry i be like i'm sorry i can't be as perfect as i be like what do you want from me
S0202	yeah
S0208	i be like i try my hardest and i didn't do as good like so what and then when i get my final result and i get the erm which be like like the highest merit for and get which be one underneath
S0202	yeah
S0208	that's not a big deal we get like one point something difference overall
S0202	yeah
S0208	and my mum be just like oh yeah look you beat and i be like mum i don't care
