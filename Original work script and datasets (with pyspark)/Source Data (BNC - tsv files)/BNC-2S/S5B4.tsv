S0144	what else do we need to get before we go
S0024	's stuff 's thing to go round the cot and some she's ready for cup now she need a cup
S0144	yeah she's nearly there isn't she
S0024	she need a cup for the little bite of water that she's be drink
S0144	yeah
S0024	so she can practice and yeah and then she then she'll start on water soon as a drink like when it's hot and stuff i don't really know i guess you'll just tell when when she get to that stage you'll just start realise what she need she doesn't need a lot of drink until she start eat because she need to drink milk from the doesn't she not crisp not crisp yeah so she doesn't really need a lot of water unless it's very hot her eye be so erm red it's like she's get massive bag under them she's be rub them doesn't look very good do it get anything that you can put on eye
S0144	no

S0144	that mean go very soon doesn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	she need to be back here at half six
S0024	be back at seven yeah about half six seven yeah do you want to go down there here we go ah i think i get more stuff than that but i quite like the blanket i think that that erm if we some more pad floor things and then we can put that blanket on top it would be like a nice rug
S0144	mm mm
S0024	i think yep we're get there we're get slowly aren't we
S0144	slowly it's take a
S0024	well we we've be here over a year and we're still not mm mm mm
S0144	well i think once we've get these big plant
S0024	mm
S0144	think its come out so
S0024	and the photos that i've be
S0144	say that for half a year
S0024	big plant and photos and then sort and then it's just little bits like now that you've take the little bits off that table onto that cabinet
S0144	mm
S0024	it look really bare and bore you can just see all the wire at the back of the tv
S0144	yeah
S0024	so
S0144	well i be think about move that music stuff into the other room now
S0024	what no we need music here
S0144	but we never use it
S0024	only because the computer's disappear where's it go i think
S0144	well cos i've be use it cos i've be use the second sound card well it's useful have two computers
S0024	see i think that you be gonna get your new computer the old computer be gonna stay here for music
S0144	well that's what i think at first but cos the internet's not work from down i don't know
S0024	but love listen to music today
S0144	oh right
S0024	erm it be like she miss it you should have see her eye so be she just love it
S0144	mm
S0024	cos when we be travel she we didn't listen to much music and since we've be back the computer's be in the other room
S0144	yeah i've be play guitar and stuff to her
S0024	yeah yeah yeah there's that so love that but just generally on in the house
S0144	mm
S0024	i think it i mean when i put the music on she be quiet and happy and yeah she really enjoy it
S0144	mm
S0024	so i mean i dunno i like have the option to play music in here whereas it's gonna all be in the other bite be there any kind of programme we can put on the hard drive so that we can make sure i mean all the music be on hard drive yeah be it all up to date
S0144	erm no
S0024	it's just a shame that when you click on the tv you have to just play by the artist
S0144	but you can't do that cos there's thousands of folders
S0024	yeah
S0144	well it have to be the jukebox plug in the computer and
S0024	do you really need that computer
S0144	i'm use it a lot like in conjunction with the other one
S0024	yeah well i'll get jukebox on mine download the music onto mine
S0144	er how much space have you get on yours
S0024	hm don't know
S0144	be that eh be it on now
S0024	how much space do i need
S0144	erm i don't know i guess my music come to
S0024	but then it's annoy because you can't listen to music and do stuff on the computer at the same time we need another computer
S0144	you'll probably need about fifty sixty gigs
S0024	fifty sixty gigs
S0144	it's a guess
S0024	how do i find out
S0144	just go to my computer
S0024	well i've get on my local disc on my d drive
S0144	yeah
S0024	i've get ninety seven gigabytes free

S0024	hm
S0144	good the c drive you just wanna keep for windows really how big's your c drive
S0024	mm it's sixty nine gigs
S0144	mm

S0024	mm
S0144	what's that
S0024	hold on i've get the digital storytelling up
S0144	oh sorry
S0024	i'll tell you about this one erm it say for use in a k twelve classroom mm
S0144	oh

S0144	mm mm
S0024	so so i'll have a look at that yeah it's not really for university teach university course erm this one need rhetorical compose erm read research research activities erm join us to become more effective writers and better citizens
S0024	erm it's a course where writers exchange word ideas talents and support introduce to rhetorical concepts ideas and techniques to inform and persuade audiences that will help you become a more effective consumer and producer or write visual and multimodal texts
S0144	mm
S0024	i think that sound quite good
S0144	it sound a little bite vague
S0024	yeah erm
S0024	don't really say anything else really oh the syllabus be think rhetorically oh that's just gonna be respond rhetorically where you do a write exchange in a peer review
S0144	mm mm
S0024	argue rhetorically see rhetorically research rhetorically and then rhetorically mm doesn't really sound like i don't know
S0144	i don't really understand the focus of that
S0024	i don't know but anyway i'll have a look at that
S0144	mm mm
S0024	i've get another one erm start oh the english composition one university oh that's just for that's for university write i think what i'd do be take the course to get a few ideas for my teach and just like have a look at the materials that they're use for their workshops basically mm they should be good shouldn't they
S0144	mm i'm really get into my well start that book last night brilliant
S0024	which one
S0144	the r book
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	really good
S0024	what's it about
S0144	well it's like i say it start with edward bernays erm he set up a meet with him and he be like ninety nine or something what it
S0024	who
S0144	edward bernays
S0024	who set up a meet
S0144	this guy who write the book
S0024	okay
S0144	and basically he say how bernays it be only after he have do the meet with him that he realise what a genius he be
S0024	mm
S0144	because he basically have manipulate the whole meet from even before he get there till things happen after the meet he manipulate the whole thing just to him a lesson
S0024	what how
S0144	like he er like for example he say oh oh he be say to him how how to become a er well the techniques of pr be she okay she's get a bite frantic
S0024	you be you hungry okay yeah go on
S0144	erm yeah i can't remember what the name of what's the name of the book the name of the book be erm the social history of oh that's it yeah he do a previous book call all consume image and er in the in the interview edward bernays say okay so for example you know if you want to become successful if you want to become successful you would phone up i would phone up the council on i don't know what it's call council of image or council of advertise or something and say okay what we need to do be focus on the erm consumer image that's about the direction we should go this year erm we should set up at meet at such and such a place and have a big like kind of workshop get the media involve i don't know he's obviously get a lot a lot more contact and a lot more detail to that but it's basically what he say and then three months later this guy get a phone call for the the council that he mention in this interview
S0024	yeah
S0144	just as an example of his power you know cos he be show his power basically
S0024	yeah
S0144	and they say oh yeah we've we think it be a good idea this year to a er a big forum on consumer image you know we've get such and such involve and it's exactly what bernays use in just his like flippant kind of example in the interview
S0024	really
S0144	yeah so he must have just pick up the phone after the interview and set the ball in motion
S0024	really
S0144	it be just erm yeah it it's just start off say a few examples like you know the the incubator one in in you know that don't you
S0024	no what one
S0144	erm well you remember all these stories that come out before war you know be try to get justification in in their action into a war
S0024	yeah
S0144	like they do with syria recently with the chemical weapons
S0024	yeah
S0144	same thing in iraq they do a massive thing say they get this fifteen year old girl to say that the erm saddam hussein's kind of private army have be go round hospitals and take baby out of incubators
S0024	oh
S0144	leave them on the cold concrete floor to to die
S0024	mm
S0144	you know and this testimony come from a fifteen year old girl who get up in front of a it be like a un panel and you know and state it erm which after the war be find out that this fifteen year old girl be the daughter of the kuwaiti ambassador
S0024	oh
S0144	basically on the payroll of the cia and er you know fabricate the whole thing but the power's do right i mean
S0024	yeah yeah yeah
S0144	and as they're say you know like now you can see it go on in syria and and iran as well they've all these stories come up all they're they're bullshit but people don't care about that
S0024	mm
S0144	cos it's just about shape people's mind into justify movement into a certain direction it's just so powerful
S0024	mm
S0144	like another one when remember that erm that in the last gulf war when they pull down saddam hussein's statue
S0024	yeah yeah yeah
S0144	that be a
S0024	that be
S0144	that be an image
S0024	major
S0144	that need to happen because it be a shift point you know it be win hearts and mind basically
S0024	yeah
S0144	it be like yeah america have or whoever erm have get control we're the be the symbol of win the war
S0024	yeah
S0144	of take or remove the statue and it have people in the streets like cheer and
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	i mean like i read no i read erm an article one of the journalists that be there who be so disgust by that he's he's basically become an independent journalist now
S0024	mm
S0144	he say that all of the journalists be kind of shepherd into these hotels around that square and basically it be rent a mob you know who come in it be nothing it wasn't you know they be pay people to come in
S0024	yeah yeah that be the one yeah
S0144	and pull down the statue it be all stag
S0024	mm
S0144	but the way it be show on the media for days
S0024	oh it be on every day for
S0144	yeah
S0024	weeks
S0144	and that be it be like yes we've win and for the open that must have be show in iraq as well not just for us but for the iraqi people see that
S0024	mm
S0144	they must have see that as a a step as well that okay saddam hussein's lose and it's just the things like that it's just so powerful
S0024	oh yeah that's what the book be all about
S0144	yeah
S0024	not just image though
S0144	no no talk about the history at the moment it's gonna go back to the first world be now i think talk about that because i mean the british be master of propaganda in the first world war
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm and then you have people like edward bernays and lippman come to prominence like in the twenties they start write about it how how to control people's mind you know to control society and oh be sick
S0024	can you pass me a tissue
S0144	erm and then the second world war joseph goebbels kind of take their ideas
S0024	who
S0144	the nazi propaganda minister
S0024	who
S0144	joseph goebbels
S0024	goebbels
S0144	erm and he take like british ideas as well from the first world war a lot of good posters and things didn't they take all those ideas and basically make the
S0024	oh no no no no no
S0144	the most successful propaganda campaign in history really
S0144	erm and then it's kind of move on to er kind of consumer base mind control
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	er which be what bernays be write about cos he be the nephew of freud
S0024	yeah but it's just yeah it's quite crazy how it must have all
S0144	yeah it be all about the it be all about unconscious desire you know and tap into that
S0024	but still now
S0144	yeah oh yeah it's still
S0024	but now you've get the internet and the tv where you can just go boom there it be
S0144	yeah yeah well it's change though because people be become slightly more savvy about it you know they can see through it
S0024	well yeah
S0144	so they're constantly have to make it more sophisticate and even more hide you know erm like remember that erm on gmtv or whatever it be call now remember i get so angry with that guy the doctor who be question immunisations with baby
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	and the way that he be take to piece erm by that other guest they have on and they they do that repeatedly over two weeks on different channel and newspapers and
S0024	yeah
S0144	it it be a systemated er systematic pr campaign basically i would have love to have investigate that cos i'm sure that be fund by people like glaxosmithkline
S0024	do you
S0144	and bayer yeah
S0024	well if you see it on load of channel it's a bite suspect isn't it
S0144	well look it's the arguments they set up cos they weren't
S0024	yeah false arguments and
S0144	false arguments it
S0024	change direction quite easily
S0144	yeah i mean the argument they use very kind of emotive things like oh you're you're neglect your child if you're not give them immunisations
S0024	yeah
S0144	that be basically the main kind of of the argument
S0024	and you want yeah and that erm what's the other argument that you say that you know you know if nobody else have everybody else be inoculate yours doesn't need it
S0144	yeah
S0024	and things like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	and it's just wrong because for the whole community
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's wrong
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's the argument
S0144	yeah exactly
S0024	for the whole community it's wrong not just for your child your neglect your child and neglect the community
S0144	yeah
S0024	you're put everybody else in danger
S0144	yeah
S0024	stuff like that
S0144	and that's the spin they give it
S0024	and yeah that's the spin of erm of them that their main argument be probably about the mercury within the injections and
S0144	yeah no that's not mention
S0024	no
S0144	ever
S0024	no it's a different argument
S0144	and and it be very much it wasn't a group of scientists that be say this it be one person
S0024	yeah
S0144	one lunatic
S0024	oh yeah yeah he get out didn't he
S0144	oh he have to leave the country
S0024	yeah
S0144	he live in america now
S0024	do he
S0144	yeah
S0024	i think he live in europe
S0144	no he's get quite a successful tv thing i think in america or something
S0024	oh really
S0144	erm but yeah you can't you just have to pin it on one person erm but other people aren't gonna you know they're gonna be scar to to research the safety of vaccines because you're just gonna be oust by the scientific community
S0024	yeah
S0144	because you have to just pander towards the fuck corporate objectives
S0024	and that's just because yeah and it's not science anymore because you're not allow to come up with a different hypothesis for something if agree with
S0144	no you have to agree with the consensus
S0024	or if you do people just twist the argument and just say something like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	like they weren't even discuss the what's in the vaccines the vaccines fit er erm contaminate with hiv or the vaccines get contaminate with other diseases
S0144	mm
S0024	or the mercury content of the nothing like that
S0144	no no no and all that
S0024	nothing like that that's not the argument for them be it
S0144	no no they'd never touch that
S0024	so if you start say something like that they just bounce it back to you and change the whole
S0144	yeah
S0024	debate into
S0144	and it's things like erm swine flu
S0024	yeah that's the same as well
S0144	like chicken flu all these things these be all
S0024	chicken flu bird flu
S0144	bird flu whatever these be all drive i'm sure by erm like people like glaxo
S0024	mm
S0144	who pump millions into these pr campaign stir up a load of fear
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	erm just look at the people who've die it's it's miniscule absolutely miniscule

S0144	oh really
S0024	yeah that they want to trial
S0144	but people wouldn't take it not unless there be a perceive risk of actually contract it
S0024	mm

S0024	yeah we'll they're try to make it high enough
S0144	well i i dunno
S0024	yeah
S0144	it'd need an outbreak in the uk first or they need at least kind of half a dozen people that'd be enough
S0024	half a dozen people with an outbreak

S0144	i need people have be texting me i need to get back to them
S0024	okay yeah
S0144	i feel bad because i'm suppose to be play
S0024	mm it depend on cos if you want to become the if you want to be the drummer of the band you're gonna have to go to the gigs to drum you can't skip them can you
S0144	i know but it's not really a gig it's his housewarming party but he want music so erm
S0024	but you know what i mean it's
S0144	it's it's a long way
S0024	cos if you don't yeah it's a long way
S0144	it's a long way to go just for a couple of beers as well if i just want to go quickly
S0024	yeah
S0144	and show my face
S0024	yeah mm but it be possible like twenty minute taxi ride and then you can get back in a taxi but it's just that you like to stay late once you're there
S0144	yeah well i know that's my problem
S0024	how about if i phone you at twelve and say get back home
S0024	i could do if you want me to
S0144	yeah but i don't want you to be perceive like that by other people
S0024	but if
S0144	oh 's under the thumb
S0024	yeah well it's not as if i do it often be it
S0144	no well i don't want no i don't want it to be like that
S0024	would you take her a sec
S0144	oh you
S0024	you don't have no you don't have to tell them that that's what i've do i could just be remind you that that's what you want to do
S0144	yeah yeah the trouble be
S0024	but by then you might be so piss that you'll be like no
S0144	well it's difficult people be like oh just have one more or oh just gonna play one more song or say goodbye to people and then people start talk to you
S0024	not if i say that you need to get back cos 's
S0144	yeah i'm just rubbish at leave
S0024	have a bad night
S0144	yeah
S0024	you know
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm i'm just say i'll do that for you if you want but i'm not sure you'll when i phone you
S0144	mm
S0024	you'll have have a few drink by then and be enjoy yourself and you might wanna stay all night then
S0144	mm
S0024	but i wanna get load of stuff do tomorrow if you do go out
S0144	yeah yeah yeah so i don't wanna get piss
S0024	mm mm mm
S0144	and i'm play tomorrow night
S0024	mm
S0144	so well so they're suppose to be play tomorrow night as well
S0024	mm
S0144	and if they get completely hammer then they might not even turn up tomorrow they should do cos we need to practice it's be three months since we play
S0024	yeah well they probably want practice tonight and tomorrow
S0144	and we've get
S0024	all i'm say be if like
S0144	two gigs come up so
S0024	they're start yeah if these gigs be come up and if you start no we're not go to go and play in the band
S0144	mm mm
S0024	then they'll find someone else
S0144	yeah the thing be i
S0024	and you'll just be the sunday night guy
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	which be what you be last term and you weren't happy about it
S0144	yeah
S0024	you want to have more didn't you
S0144	yeah i do want more i know i know they want me
S0024	mm
S0144	so it's it's difficult with you isn't it
S0024	yeah i know but it won't be all the time will it it's only cos it's a one off house party and
S0144	yeah
S0024	because we've all come back
S0144	but i think i could bring quite a lot to the band in term of expand them
S0024	mm
S0144	with ideas
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm because we're the only foreign band in this city
S0024	yeah
S0144	like western foreign band there's filipino band and stuff but this what eight million people in this city
S0024	yeah
S0144	do you know what i mean that's we're we're play at a wed or something erm in a couple of weeks
S0024	that'd be brilliant to do weddings because
S0144	well it's i mean they're not give us i think it's like er about two hundred and fifty quid it work out
S0024	total
S0144	yeah
S0024	so fifty quid each or something
S0144	well yeah about sixty seventy quid each yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	erm which the agents well i think 's go through have say they'll pay us more after that but it's only that's only for twenty minutes
S0024	yeah that's crazy
S0144	so
S0024	you can't have a band for a wed for twenty minutes
S0144	if we have like one and a half hour
S0024	well
S0144	slot you know and then we could get probably double that
S0024	yeah
S0144	easy and the amount of you know it's a big city
S0024	yeah it's massive everybody will be hire you for their weddings
S0144	and it's not just it's the surround areas as well
S0024	mm
S0144	there's a lot of money some here in between and here
S0024	mm
S0144	that whole kind of belt
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm there's so much potential there
S0024	but all i'm say be like i know i really need your help tomorrow
S0144	mm
S0024	so yeah i don't want you to get piss either because
S0144	yeah
S0024	it'll be cos i'm so tire that we're gonna have er yeah we're gonna need you tomorrow
S0144	yeah
S0024	but i think you need to go to any band practice they've get right now
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't mind you go at all i i really don't mind you go but i do need you tomorrow
S0144	yeah well maybe i can go just for a few hours
S0024	mm
S0144	i need one of those like belt those tag like criminals
S0144	erm what else be i gonna say er oh yeah and as i think because i play the and not a drum kit that's another because the chinese love it
S0024	yeah mm
S0144	it's such a novelty for them they absolutely love it
S0024	yeah
S0144	and i think i don't know the best way to publicise ourselves but i be get ideas from that book i be read cos bernays be talk about how it should be a it be a stag event but it should never appear as a stag event as a whole
S0024	mm
S0144	it's one of the first point right i be think what we could do you know to give a massive impact yeah you know to give a massive impact and to bring attention from the media
S0024	mm mm
S0144	but without make it look appear stag
S0024	okay
S0144	but by something we do
S0024	erm well it's play the hotel will be a good start because he he's do all the advertise for you
S0144	yeah he say there's tv radio
S0024	yeah
S0144	and yeah but i i don't think that'll work just
S0024	yeah that that's the advertise
S0144	yeah
S0024	and if you can negotiate not to do it every two weeks to do it to do it every once a month gig
S0144	mm
S0024	that will be perfect
S0144	yeah time
S0024	yeah with the advertise as well it's great
S0144	mm yeah
S0024	and then once people how about erm people need to start put you through reach out basically
S0144	well they they do reach out
S0024	who
S0144	the band
S0024	no no no somebody need to record you post it on we chat for people to erm to you you know how when you be at uni once one of the lecturers say oh wow you've be on wechat your face have be on wechat a lot that be because some students what do they do they take a picture of you
S0144	yeah
S0024	pass it on to somebody else who pass it on to somebody else who pass it on to somebody else share a video share a link share a link share a link share a link and it go round i mean it'll be surprise it'll go round quite rapidly
S0144	so maybe if we could just do yeah a video somewhere
S0024	you need a video and you need someone like me to i'll share it with with er i've only get one but we could ask and then get her to watch it probably
S0144	and try and make it go viral
S0024	yeah
S0144	er locally viral
S0024	yeah yeah yeah that's what i mean yeah not not like on the internet viral but
S0144	yeah
S0024	if you do the wechat then it's all of this community isn't it basically
S0144	yeah
S0024	everybody who's find it so but you don't want to tell people to repost it so you just make sure you you show it to lot of people
S0144	yeah that would get the name recognise but
S0024	what's the name of your band have you get a name
S0144	it's which i don't like
S0024	
S0144	yeah
S0024	why
S0144	's get this story of this girl he be with basically his story about how this girl ditch him at exit four of the subway
S0024	oh
S0144	but
S0024	and a lot of his songs be about the girl
S0144	a lot of his songs be about girls but i don't like that but that be decide upon before i even know them so
S0024	that's not yeah that's not too
S0144	yeah that's yeah i'm not happy with the name well it depend how big they wanna get
S0024	you can always change the name later
S0144	cos i think we could get pretty good to be honest there's a lot of talent in that band

S0024	mm
S0144	erm but be say he want to start a band with me as well

S0024	oh you can be in two band can't you but that's too much hard work you can't you haven't get the time to do that and to make your music on the computer and you're try to do too much
S0144	mm
S0024	and one thing at a time
S0144	yeah but apart from this one that's where my energy's gonna go
S0024	yeah it's
S0144	this year

S0024	lately i know we need it cos we need a break and we be always tire and still tire
S0144	but occasionally
S0024	yeah but as soon as we start one series thing i don't know then we just sit down at dinner we watch another series and then every dinner time it's the same
