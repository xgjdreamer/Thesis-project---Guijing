S0525	mm
S0517	it be weird anyway
S0525	well you be talk about i wonder if 'll stick with erm
S0517	oh why
S0525	well it seem money be the main issue there
S0517	oh yeah
S0525	so do i tell you when i saw her last and hadn't really mention it but erm yeah because you know she's get quite a few properties now
S0517	yeah you say that she get three or four properties
S0525	well she have a lot of money erm when her dad die which be years ago this be
S0517	mm
S0525	before she split up with
S0517	right
S0525	and of course they they sell that house over the road which be worth quite a lot when they sell it and she get half of that erm she'd have all her money from her dad erm her dad's her dad marry four time and the the final wife
S0525	only die recently so they get another inheritance cos a lot of it be in trust for her when the final go
S0517	oh right
S0525	so her and get some more money and that only happen
S0517	oh okay
S0525	probably two years ago and then of course her mother die last year
S0517	oh yes yes yes
S0525	it be about it be about this time when she just get back from thailand
S0517	yeah
S0525	erm they keep the house on it's a well it's a flat in so again it's worth a lot they're keep it on and they're rent it at moment
S0517	right
S0525	so she's get that property which she's rent she own her own property she's get the property in turkey she's get a erm she's get a place way that she rent and then there might that might be the one she rent with or there might be another one that she rent with
S0517	gosh so she's get five maybe
S0525	because 's husband's a builder so he do quite a bite of work and then she own half of 's house
S0517	oh
S0525	because remember
S0517	i think you us he be struggle to buy her out
S0525	so buy her out so and own half their house
S0517	mm so he still live in it
S0525	and they rent it
S0517	he doesn't
S0525	no no no no he live with now he move in
S0517	i be gonna say
S0525	yeah he move in a while ago so but all he own his half a house
S0517	they rent it out
S0525	so the rental income that come in they get half each and they get half each and they do half the maintenance
S0517	oh
S0525	so he pay her do she say four hundred five hundred pound a month something like that
S0517	right
S0525	but will not contribute to anything in the house she say you know she'll buy things for the garden he say well i i don't i don't want it
S0517	mm
S0525	and when she be renovate her mum's flat with she'd ask him to help out he say well why what's in it for me you're just gonna rent that out and that's more money for you there's nothing in it for me so
S0517	what do he do for a job
S0525	so no work at the tesco down the road yeah the big
S0517	oh do he
S0525	yeah yeah
S0517	so just a factory worker really
S0525	mm and then 's load quite frankly
S0517	oh gosh have he get children
S0525	so
S0517	mm
S0525	yeah two two girls i think grow up he's get a granddaughter
S0517	oh
S0525	which adore you know but erm so he's pay this money this
S0517	so do it do that money cover all his rent his electricity and his food
S0525	well she doesn't think it do but he think it's more than enough because
S0517	and he she hasn't get a mortgage
S0525	no
S0517	gosh that sound quite cheap actually to live
S0525	yeah
S0517	in a nice house to get everything throw in for that price
S0525	yeah yeah and he won't contribute to anything and he she so she do all the shop she pay all the bill and and then he just contribute that and say that's what you can afford that's enough and i think now it's become an issue so like with the holiday this year cos she pay for them to go to thailand as a present and everything last year and course they go to turkey to her property
S0517	right
S0525	and erm she's she'd say this year about go various place and he say oh no no i think we should just go to turkey she say i know he say it because he think well it's a free holiday isn't it so i ask him to pay two hundred pound towards the apartment for the week
S0517	right
S0525	she say well she barely speak to me for days
S0517	oh
S0525	she say he be adamant that that you know
S0517	how long have they be together
S0525	oh probably three years now and he's probably be move in have it be a year over over a year cos she be fifty about eighteen months ago i think he's move in by now cos we all think he be gonna propose on her fiftieth
S0517	so so how old be he oh
S0525	he's a bite older not much older he isn't probably two or three years older
S0517	so have he get a pension have he get any
S0525	i don't know what he's get i i don't know he doesn't strike me as the type to have anything really
S0517	can he retire though you know can retire in his sixties or
S0525	no i don't think so well i don't think he can and erm
S0517	so he'd be mad to fall out with her really
S0525	so well he seem to think it's the other way round accord to
S0525	because erm after her mum die she decide she be gonna go part time do less work you know blah blah she's get a lot of properties she say i could just sell one if i'm that hard up
S0517	how nice
S0525	you know yeah so she she hasn't get
S0517	yeah
S0525	money worry she buy the boys cars and things cos he's mint
S0517	oh be he oh the ex husband oh be he
