S0144	yeah
S0024	mm it's sad i hope i'd love who be say the other day like you know like we always talk about the era of pisces and like how this i know not like not like er astronomy astrology type stuff that that other other big massive era like from jesus' jesus'
S0144	mm well the age it be the age of pisces yeah
S0024	jesus start the the pisces and that's why there's so many fish in the bible and stuff like that
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	and because of the the way that the earth be twist or something and now it's kind of go into the era or age of aquarius
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	and that's when well
S0144	this be the dawn of the age of aquarius
S0024	but they say that's when people start to realise go back to their root and live off the land again
S0144	yeah i don't believe any of that
S0024	no but mm it's difficult isn't it you can see that it's happen but people kind of fit the story to the to the happen not
S0144	no well it's happen it's happen here it's not happen in the rest of the world
S0024	no yeah it's happen here because people be get feed up
S0144	but that's but that's also why people be say it's go to be like the end of the word in two thousand and twelve because of the end of the mayan calendar they weren't say it's go to be the end of the astrological age where we're go to be move into pisces into aquarius
S0024	end of the age ah yeah i still think it's go to be a weird year mind you we're a third of the way through the year now and we think it be go to be such a weird year
S0144	i know yeah i still think it will be it's the economy have go really quiet for a few months hasn't it so
S0024	it's the end and they keep they keep do all this on the in the government like erm i don't know say try to get all these company to pay out money and stuff like that
S0144	mm
S0024	and like you say it's it could just be almost like a trap for the public to go ah great they're do something oh great you know they're get some money back for the poor people
S0144	yeah yeah we say that
S0024	but in the whole big picture hmm i don't know be that what you be say the other day
S0144	hmm yeah it's just go quiet there must be a lot of stuff go on behind the scenes
S0024	yeah it's pretty round here isn't it
S0144	it's lovely there's not many animals around here though be there
S0024	no it's cos there's not much
S0144	i mean that's just a big field what be they do with it it's very
S0024	i don't know it look like i mean be that meadow land be that what they classify as meadow land
S0144	i don't know it look like a
S0024	it's just a nothing
