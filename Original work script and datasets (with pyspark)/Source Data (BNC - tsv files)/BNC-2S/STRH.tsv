S0115	so just kick off uh second half
S0115	uh cardiff one crystal palace nil
S0037	be you just
S0115	yeah uh yeah no i'm not actually gonna i'm not actually gonna commentate the whole match uh
S0037	oh you're not gonna commentate the whole match be you i don't think i'd like to be a sport commentator
S0115	uh uh i don't know any of the players so uh i can't really
S0037	you could just make up name for them
S0115	um could just say the team like cardiff have it in this uh
S0037	yeah that's
S0115	yeah i can see now cardiff cardiff cardiff oh cardiff
S0037	i like the which which kit do you prefer
S0115	uh uh over to crystal palace now
S0037	which kit which kit d'you prefer like i like that custardy sort of colour
S0115	uh back to sorry
S0037	i like that sort of yellowy bananary canary colour
S0115	yeah well i think that some of the kit that they have um could be more could be more extravagant i suppose um
S0037	yeah
S0115	but they must think that it's uh that it's off put to have really bright bits or
S0037	yeah like highlighter pen colour
S0115	or it's not you know it's not masculine enough to have um pink kit so i don't i don't know any team that have a pink kit
S0037	i'm i'm sure someone's i'm sure someone's get like a purpley pink do arsenal not have like a sort of how would you call it like a magenta sort of colour one for a while
S0115	um i don't know
S0037	maybe it wasn't them
S0115	i think northampton town have a purple
S0037	oh do they
S0115	but uh
S0037	oh that'd be good
S0115	um
S0037	also i think like there's a lot of strip on the go i i i'm fancy a few polka dot
S0115	yeah they don't have they don't really have spotty ones but but i think that would be it like sort of distract with the with the ball wouldn't it
S0037	you know like jockey have or like some chevrons
S0115	uh yeah that that's probably a bite distract as well innit
S0037	or like um
S0115	animal pattern or flame pattern like
S0037	animal animal pattern that'd be good wouldn't it like a leopard print
S0115	yeah i suppose you could uh
S0037	like a zebra
S0115	well yeah cos if they have name like the you know like the the tigers or something then they could actually look like tigers and then that would be
S0037	oh yeah that's a good idea
S0115	uh
S0037	like rugby league do that though don't they
S0115	so could be like like the cowboys and and the indians or something and actually look like that that would be uh
S0037	yeah well i saw like
S0115	like the the the vipers or something uh
S0037	well i saw like you know you know i've be knit stuff and that at the minute
S0115	yeah
S0037	for uh the baby well i saw this pattern like i like sort of unusual pattern and i saw this one and it be like for a tuxedo but it wasn't it be just a knit jumper
S0115	yeah
S0037	but it look like a baby tuxedo like a dickie bow tie and like a white shirt with like button and like a cumberbund and then like a jacket
S0115	right yeah
S0037	but it be just a jumper so i could do that could have them in like dinner you know dinner suit
S0115	well people um you know people dress sort of baby in that sort of thing nowadays don't they so
S0037	yeah well i'm not sure if they dress them in knit dinner jacket mind but uh that's probably a bite of a niche audience
S0115	uh
S0037	but they dress them as like big pumpkins and stuff don't they on halloween
S0115	i can see how uh you know you might wanna you could make anything out of knit i suppose and for clothe like you could imitate things couldn't you
S0037	yeah
S0115	you could sort of imitate like like a football kit i suppose you could knit a football a football shirt and
S0037	yeah you could that'd be nice and warm
S0115	uh or
S0037	you could do little military one
S0115	i'm not i don't know if i've see that i don't know if there be a market for knit uh sportswear but uh
S0037	maybe maybe there be
S0115	knit um
S0037	cos they're all that horrible sort of nylon aren't they be it nylon
S0115	for for baby that have grow up support everton or something and they would have like everton woolly jumper or something
S0037	well i could definitely knit a red and white stripy one that'd be quite nice to make
S0115	uh for for uh southampton or
S0037	not southampton you know what for
S0115	and uh
S0037	uh
S0115	i mean yeah the colour could be could be more extravagant
S0037	like you know like jockey have
S0115	uh
S0037	like where they have like a like hoop and
S0115	well they have yeah they have more crazy uh colour don't they so yeah
S0037	and like you know like even rugby do like even rugby have the that kind of the harlequin thing and like the um hoop and stuff don't they
S0115	or like the harlequin that they i like i like their one that's get sort of four bits yeah
S0037	although qpr have blue and white hoop doesn't it
S0115	yeah and celtic as well
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	um
S0037	that's probably about the limit of my footballing knowledge
S0115	there be too much there's too much just red white red white sort of
S0037	nothing wrong with red and white i think that's about the like the limit of my football knowledge though i just i like watch it but i think it that's because i like watch anything like i could happily get consume by the dart or the snooker
S0115	yeah well sport be good to watch uh especially in the pub and uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but also if you get into it you could get quite you know become engross in it and and sort of
S0037	i think so like that time we get really into the curl
S0115	that be yeah it be watchable you see you can it's it's addictive and if you watch uh you know the olympics or whatever then you sort of miss it when it finish or something or
S0037	yeah
S0115	when the
S0037	be you look forward to the olympics
S0115	um uh yeah i mean i don't normally watch load of of olympics but um because it be in london this time i suppose uh suppose i should get more involve into it so it's
S0037	yeah
S0115	i suppose you can't just turn up and then and just go and watch it
S0037	well i think you can for like the one the marathon you can
S0115	yeah you can't sort of go to the swim that's on
S0037	or the outdoor ones like the road race but no i try to get ticket but i even apply for like the most rubbish things like the tiddlywinks and like the you know
S0115	hm uh they don't do tiddlywinks do they
S0037	no that's a joke
S0115	but um
S0037	no i didn't get any ticket
S0115	they they do some strange things like like archery and uh
S0037	beach volleyball in london it's gonna be an interest one
S0115	yeah yeah um i've i dunno what what my favourite uh olympic thing to watch be but uh
S0037	i quite like the swim ones last time cos we win a lot of stuff
S0115	cycle uh uh we do win a lot of cycle uh
S0037	oh yeah the commentator be good wasn't he um i sort of get a bite bore of the ones that everyone like like the hundred metre final and that
S0115	well it's pretty quick pretty quick yeah
S0037	it's a bite sort of muh sort of everyone like it but i don't know
S0115	do they
S0037	well that's like the most expensive ticket be for that
S0115	yeah
S0037	the men's one hundred metre final
S0115	how much would it cost you to watch the men's a hundred metre final
S0037	i dunno i think it depend on where you're sit i think that all of the ones have like cheap seat for some of them
S0115	yeah
S0037	um but for a lot of them like
S0115	ooh there's chris martin
S0037	who's chris martin
S0115	play for crystal palace
S0037	do you know him before or have you just read him off the screen
S0115	no it's cos he he's a singer he's a he's um
S0037	oh chris martin chris martin like he's have a break
S0115	he uh use to be use to be
S0037	but yeah he have a better offer and so now he's play football for crystal palace
S0115	yeah um well i think he just want a change of scene um
S0037	well a change of pace so like gwyneth's in the stand with like apple and moses or whatever his kid be call
S0115	um he be always apple and moses
S0037	yeah
S0115	oh be he go through the bible the next thing's gonna be like den or something
S0037	oh you mean apple
S0115	dirty den
S0037	den
S0115	yeah from um daniel in the lion's den
S0037	ah right
S0115	apple from adam and eve and the apple um
S0037	yeah moses from moses
S0115	moses from the moses
S0037	the story of moses
S0115	moses' adventure and uh
S0037	the adventure of moses part one
S0115	daniel in the lion's den be it be that be that what he's he start with adam and eve and the apple you know start and he's plan to go all the way to you know
S0037	i don't know if apple be a very be a very standard choice
S0115	i think apple be i can see why i can see the i can see it's better than some other fruit that you might wanna use but
S0037	like what like pawpaw
S0115	well it's better than many fruit i think uh banana
S0037	mango martin's get a nice ring to it
S0115	mango yeah i think it's like
S0037	mango martin
S0115	it's it's man and go isn't it so it's you know
S0037	yeah mango yeah
S0115	it mean it mean something
S0037	or mushroom mushroom martin
S0115	um
S0037	that's quite nice
S0115	uh yeah his nickname would be would be magic wouldn't it
S0037	oh yeah like it
S0115	um
S0037	but so i think instead of like moses he should've just go for basket like moses' basket you know apple and basket what d'you think
S0115	uh um there's a lot of things around moses aren't there so you've get the ten commandments haven't you and uh
S0037	i don't know if commandment would be a nice name for a person
S0115	the plague um
S0037	buboes
S0115	uh
S0037	that's the wrong sort of plague
S0115	i don't know if that be uh
S0037	that's the black death
S0115	the the the locusts and uh
S0037	locust locust
S0037	um lovely
