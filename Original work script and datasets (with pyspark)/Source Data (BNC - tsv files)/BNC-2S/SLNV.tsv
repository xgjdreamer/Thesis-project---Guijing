S0618	oh my god
S0619	it's like what be you talk about erm it's i don't know
S0618	yeah
S0619	so and as i've i think i've say before i mean we've talk about this before you know you sort of lose touch with or you just presume everyone think the same as you because you surround yourselves with people who think the same as you
S0618	yeah yeah yeah yeah and your facebook fee be full of the same stuff
S0619	yeah yeah yeah and the same people
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	and you know when i be on twitter on the election er night or the night of the elections and all these exit pole my whole stream be people go oh my god what's happen i can't believe that this de de de de
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	erm and i be like well so who's vote for these people
S0618	yeah my family sorry and 's and his family and friends sorry yeah i know
S0619	yeah so i be like these people do exist in our society i just don't know them
S0618	it just make you think you know there's a whole other facebook newsfeed out there that's full of this oh david cameron oh jeremy hunt hooray
S0619	yeah how can anybody how can people be like oh well i just think this be a great idea jeremy but
S0618	i know
S0619	it's rather worry all my friends be out with their banners and sign
S0618	good for them
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh i do like a good march
S0619	oh i do like a good march
S0618	oh i do i do like a good banner wave
S0619	yeah and it be you know they be put all these picture of themselves on instagram and stuff and erm their the consultants who weren't strike have order them like load of takeaway pizza and stuff
S0618	ah
S0619	so my friend be like weigh down with like twenty pizzas
S0619	you know it be just sort of
S0618	that's sweet
S0619	yeah it be good spirit around it
S0618	mm
S0619	but i read something the other day that oh no it's not in it's in like trust hospitals or foundation hospitals they can decide whether to implement the new contract or not so there's like some hospitals where they won't have to implement it but all my doctor friends er be apply to job abroad so
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i be think about this if they all move abroad it mean they won't have to pay their student fee so that's fifty thousand pound per doctor er per person who's graduate in the last few years who just won't pay back their fee
S0618	yeah wow good on them
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	i'm not pay my fee back er but i've not be kind of force out of country because er you know what i mean
S0618	yeah be there a time limit on it i mean if you if you're in the uk and start earn at age fifty five for example would you be expect
S0619	er twenty five years
S0618	twenty five years hey that's not bad yeah
S0619	i think so i think it's i think it's twenty five years cos
S0618	yeah
S0619	we're we're teach this erm at school or at uni
S0618	yeah
S0619	if you're out of the country for twenty five years they wipe it
S0618	yeah yeah that's cool handy hint for you though if you think you might want a uk pension you can ring the tax office every year and say how much do i owe you in national insurance contributions
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and it's a few hundred quid a year i can't remember the figure i do i be a year short er more than a decade ago and i think i have to pay seven hundred quid and that be that year with a tick in a box
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i mean there be no guarantee of course i think you need something like twenty five qualify years to be able to draw a pension but that's as things stand today
S0619	mm mm
S0618	the government by the time i retire might have decide to do away with pension entirely you never know so
S0619	yeah erm so erm what erm what be i go to say mm mm mm yeah and er and pay national insurance for that time that i'm in england so for about five weeks
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	erm and it be quite a lot of national insurance and it's quite a lot of tax but i can get the tax back
S0618	yeah it won't be enough for the year
S0619	er yeah
S0618	but yeah it's just something worth consider you might want to sort of factor it into your annual budgetary equations erm
S0619	mm so we'll see mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it be you know it be just such a shock and then he start a sentence that be something like oh i just don't get that about gay marriage and me and be like
S0619	no no no no no no
S0618	oh
S0619	he's like i just don't believe that people you know be so against it and i be like thank fuck for that i be go to have to kick you out and go to mrs and say
S0618	oh my god i can't live with this man
S0619	i can't live with this man i'm sorry
S0618	yeah
S0619	we be like er this be sort of after the ukip er revelation
S0618	yeah mind you david cameron vote for equal marriage there's still big problems it's a big issue in northern ireland still erm
S0619	mm mm
S0618	with er the dup veto it all the stormont executive have say yes let's have equal marriage and the dup er have this petition of concern
S0619	mm
S0618	which be a a legal thing that they can use to block legislation from be pass if they believe that it's gonna unfairly disadvantage either the protestant community or the catholic community so they've use it erm and it's a nonsense so there be you know big petition try to get their petition overturn to bring it in to to law that still hasn't happen
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	i do wonder you know if it do come in if my legal right of marriage might get backdate because and i have a civil partnership in northern ireland
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so i don't have equal right you know financially and that's go to affect me in later life even if it doesn't now but i wonder if that might get sort of wipe out and change i don't know
S0619	uhu
S0618	i suppose once it eventually go through i need to be ask that question
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	yeah i don't think the coffee's as good here as it be last time
S0619	it's too hot to drink that's the problem with black well we can have a little wander
S0618	yeah can we manage a little
S0619	yeah
S0618	air
S0619	i be think yeah i need to get out of the house
S0618	mm i'm sure it's drive you stir crazy we can just drive around in for a little while if you like open the window when you want some air try not to cough on anything or touch anything
S0619	yeah
S0618	i'm joke
S0619	you know it's be better today i take the i take the rubbish out and then i be like fuck that be a bad idea
S0618	good mm
S0619	erm but in general stuff's start to clear up but we'll see
S0618	yeah
S0619	it well i suppose it should be do by now
S0618	and have you notice how clean be
S0619	she's very clean i hadn't notice but she's clean
S0618	yeah she's very shiny i've be put off go to one of these erm wash place cos there be five number
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and i have no idea what they all say so i ask and he say oh start with number two and then go for number three and that's you just ignore the other number so i be on number two for most of the time get six months worth of shite off of her and then i start to wonder after these streaky line be appear be i actually take off the top layer of polish here
S0618	i mean there's there's a certain amount of potential for that i'm not sure so when i'm over in england in march for the pre mot check and things i'll get an opinion of an expert and we'll see
S0619	oh no
S0618	i know i'm not sure though because
S0619	naked
S0618	no then i rub bits with my hand and then the streak disappear and everything go whiter
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so i wonder if you know the the super heat soapy jet wash of number two get a certain level of shit off of it and then i need to actually rub with a sponge or something to get the next layer of cack off
S0619	right mm mm
S0618	i don't know erm
S0619	but it be easy to do
S0618	yeah really easy to do cost about ten zlotys about a pound seventy five something like that
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and i be there for fifteen minutes with the various
S0619	mm mm
S0618	jet number two and number three so yeah it go very well so i'll do that again and i think any future wash will only cost about five so i should do it in half the time
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah it's good
S0619	good for you
S0618	yeah so i'm write out my itinerary at the moment and erm check with various people that it's okay to stay on whatever date
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm yeah and i've just be in touch with the van man see if he's free to do a check on pre mot check and you know with a vehicle you can get thirteen months' worth of mot
S0619	right
S0618	so 's due on the sixteenth of april
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but if i have her test on the sixteenth of march or after then the certificate be still valid to sixteenth of april next year
S0619	ah ha okay
S0618	so it's a naughty way of get thirteen months i suppose
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	erm yeah so i'm try to do that and try to figure in all of the the the date and allow time for if she do need any part or need any work do
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so yeah but we'll see but i'm quite excite really and i've finally ask my aunty and uncle if i can leave all my shite at their house and my aunty weren't keen
S0619	oh no
S0618	oh shit so my uncle wasn't there he be work late last night he's the one he'll say oh yes mate whatever you need no no worry but my aunty's i don't know i think she's quite stress because her youngest son and his wife who both have fairly severe disabilities have be stay with them for the past few months
S0619	mm mm mm mm
S0618	she's push seventy and she's just stress out a lot of the time so i think anybody ask anything of her be gonna be meet with a ah
S0619	mm mm yeah yeah mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	mm mm
S0618	so i dunno so i quickly follow that up with an email to my uncle just to say i have a chat with my aunty and this be what i ask and this be the volume of crap i wouldn't mind keep in your spare room and it's really genuinely honestly not that much
S0619	mm mm
S0618	it will fit in the spare room and all go away in drawers wardrobe cupboards
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i mean easily it's not like box everywhere erm i mean you know if you look at there she be full on the way over
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i'm keep some stuff to travel with give a load of stuff away i'm ready to let go of now it's not really that much so
S0619	mm mm good
S0618	yeah
S0619	good for you
S0618	and i've be on the work away website and the help x website i'm get really really really really excite
S0619	so what's how's the what's the plan today
S0618	well
S0619	as it stand
S0618	there's actually there's a place in portugal where
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i think erm they they're look for people from i think it's mid april to december
S0619	ah ha
S0618	they accept people and i i don't know i kind of get the feel i could go live with them for the whole duration
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but heat might be a problem in portugal in the summer
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and then there be some poland project i really like the look of as well
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm one of them have they look like horse
S0619	ah
S0618	little ponies they're stumpy little things erm not quite like the things that go up and down beach but
S0619	uhu
S0618	you know a bite bigger than that and a bite more grow up look than that i suppose a bite more horsey look than that but erm yeah they get twenty of them and part of the job obviously will be shovel shit
S0619	cute oh my god
S0618	and i think in the profile they talk about shovel shit or clear shit and think ah that's honest i like that
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm but you'd also have an opportunity to learn to ride and they talk about erm cos they're all hippies be in kind of be one with the horse and learn how like raw ride in a
S0619	horse whisperer
S0618	yeah ride in a horse sensitive kind of a way and i really like that
S0619	well that's nice
S0618	so that might be a wonderful opportunity
S0619	yeah be really nice
S0618	yeah haven't find much with be unfortunately
S0619	mm mm
S0618	i be keen to learn about be there's lot on biodynamic farm and organic farm and permaculture so i'm not go to have problems there and then and then i look at a map and i think i'm you know i'm think now about this drive back to the uk and i'm stay with friends in and i'm stay with two lot of friends in the netherlands
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and i'm think if i'm drive form poland to portugal surely it make sense to stay in some project in czech republic in austria
S0619	nice
S0618	and maybe italy in france in spain before i get down to portugal
S0619	oh
S0618	so i'm think maybe i'll just do like a month or six weeks in poland and then maybe you know a month czech republic a month austria a month spain and then get down to portugal and kind of bed in there for winter i don't know
S0619	nice
S0618	there's project everywhere it's amaze can't believe i've never discover this world before and you can tell from the feedback and the review that well not everybody but if you pick the right ones base on review they treat you like part of the family and
S0619	mm mm nice
S0618	in they can be have a traditional whatever meal with that mum or grandma's cook and be at the table with the whole family and other volunteer so it's excite can't wait really
S0619	good for you i'm kind of well i'm not jealous of the sort of opportunity to move so much but er

S0619	mm m mm mm yeah

S0619	erm yes another thing we be talk about last night we be talk about erm i can't remember it be something to do with sort of not rape culture exactly but it be sort of erm er sort of like victim sham or educate oh no we be talk about have children and then we say i be so worry about erm if i have a daughter cos i'd just feel so protective all the time if she ever leave the house i'd be worry like what would happen to her er and you know well i sort of say but you know it's not her responsibility to learn how to sort of er protect herself it should be sort of the responsibility of or the education of young men say
S0618	mm
S0619	stop attack people please er and i feel quite strongly about this
S0618	yeah i think we have a a lot of that in uk culture in particular be teach women in particular to be afraid and that just suck
S0619	mm mm mm mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	and teach parent to be afraid and a lot of that's you know it's nonsense
S0619	mm mm
S0618	statistically what's the probability of you know a paedophile attack your child or
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm a rapist attack your daughter i mean statistically it's tiny but the fear can be enormous
S0619	mm mm but no i well i think sort of if you're talk about like rapists in the sense of like a man drag you into an alley
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's tiny
S0618	yeah
S0619	but if it's like erm go home with someone on a night out
S0618	yeah and you've have too much to drink and whatever yeah
S0619	yeah that's
S0618	that's more likely
S0619	way more likely so there sort of need to be some education for both young men and women about sort of consent or
S0618	mm yes yeah there be a fantastic thing on facebook
S0619	the tea thing
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	on tea
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah and if a woman you've go home with be too drink to agree to cup of tea she doesn't want tea
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	well i read this
S0618	i like that
S0619	i read this book about no it be sort of a fiction book for young people erm about a sort of group of friends and this girl erm in this community and she's like really really beautiful and she's a proper bitch to her friends and she know that she's pretty and de de de and sort of for the first half of it you don't really like her and you're not sort of very sympathetic towards her erm and she's always go out and get drink er and sleep around and then she's er at a party and she's sort of gang rap by this group of footballers from the local football team and they take picture and put it on the internet and all of this stuff erm and well it's sort of about these issue of consent and about social media and er the impact of social media and all of these things and i think my point be that it should be sort of not not necessarily read in school but sort of recommend to young people young men
S0618	mm yeah the issue should be address
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	yeah i don't remember have any form of school education over sex or rape or consent nothing
S0619	no no

S0618	we can just go for a random drive see where we end up
S0619	yeah
S0618	let's do that will we

S0618	basically it's just nice for you not to be in your flat for a little while
S0619	i know i just need a bite of scenery erm i'm try to i don't know where we could go though that's kind of local
S0618	we could do a sort of head out west of

S0619	mm mm
S0618	and then you can sort of come in to the south of again i'm not really sure how that would work but i could drive in that general direction and
S0619	or we could go i don't know how far away it be maybe it's quite far the place where when we go to the place with the church
S0618	mm mm
S0619	and there's like that town
S0618	there's a bloody great church thing there that describe most of the towns in poland but
S0619	i know i don't know whether that's the one and i say oh that this look pretty

S0618	yeah
S0619	mm
S0618	well we could go park in the square there's bind to be a coffee shop or something we could get a herbal something or not bother
