S0644	yum yum yum oh that old dog
S0607	oh actually i be gonna look at the map while we're here cos i want to see where be
S0644	that
S0607	yeah that's what i be think be that before or after where we're go
S0644	we're do quite good for time today
S0607	yeah if i be like on the thing i would burn half of this map
S0644	would you what cos you've do it
S0607	cos she's carry all the stuff on her back
S0644	really
S0607	everything she's read she burn at night
S0644	really
S0607	cos it's less weight and i be think i could pull out the page of her book that i haven't read
S0644	i love set fire to things
S0607	i mean that i have read not that i haven't read okay so
S0607	where be it
S0644	there's
S0607	oh yeah
S0644	river then it's like we've go up to
S0607	we go past
S0644	
S0607	you think that's where we be so
S0644	oh no we're in that's there
S0607	oh be we already
S0644	yeah
S0607	okay so be before where we're go to
S0644	be it
S0607	we're go up to oh crap too far where we're go or be it er but be that or be it oh there there
S0607	so mm there's
S0644	oh we go past
S0607	where be we here
S0644	yeah be there
S0607	and now we're sort of here
S0644	mm
S0607	okay so maybe we're like a third of the way
S0644	mm
S0607	excellent
S0644	there be no real erm long distance that we cover where there be nothing there be there do you know what i mean you know like when i first think we're do this
S0607	there's always something
S0644	think we be go in remote coastal wilderness
S0607	i do as well
S0644	where there weren't any stop and there weren't any
S0607	i think we probably have to be in do that other trip to get that you know the texas type one
S0644	yeah
S0607	even if i really can't be bother when we get there i'm definitely gonna try and make myself have a walk
S0644	yeah
S0607	cos sometimes we get there and i erm just think oh no
S0607	awesome thank so much for spot that
S0644	that's alright
S0607	eagle eye
S0644	shall i invoice you every time i see one
S0607	that might take away from the get the cash out for free thing but yeah
S0607	might as well just use another bank right but anyway so you be say about erm there be there be a bite that we miss and it be about your course the human be erm we we get erm side track and you be tell me about your course do you think you can remember or
S0644	oh just the reason i cos you be talk about private school and one of the lecture one of the lecturers we have he be brilliant he be call and he could just speak for an hour on a subject like no note no reference no book just speak
S0607	yeah
S0644	very eloquently for an hour on something easily anyway one particular one there be load one particular one be erm about this woman mp english woman who's an mp and she be like i think she must have be in the labour party right anyway suppose to be or profess to be erm against the idea of private school because you know she say it's the argument be that it's inherently unfair everybody should have the same opportunities blah blah blah blah blah then she send her kid to private school
S0607	yeah this happen a lot
S0644	well this be it and so the discussion be be she a hypocrite or not and
S0607	oh interest
S0644	be she a hypocrite so one girl say an unequivocal yes
S0607	yeah
S0644	because you know she spout all this and i i say well here's the thing see what i think be what we
S0607	she didn't have kid when she have that opinion
S0644	no that's no good either
S0607	no
S0644	cos that just show you can't think outside your own
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm sort of what's the word
S0607	yeah i know what you mean
S0644	you know what i mean can't think like past your nose
S0607	outside your yeah
S0644	past your own nose erm oh i like these little shop things they have yeah so everyone say if she have say erm hang on what be it how could i have forget that that's my main point
S0644	if she have say i would send my children to private school but i really think all school should be erm
S0607	yeah
S0644	of a of the same level that they should be
S0607	but give that they're not i'll still send mine
S0644	yeah because i wouldn't i would want my children to have the best education
S0607	if i can afford it mm
S0644	and i but i really think that as a rule we should try and phase out this or all school should be of this or that or the other but she didn't say that she say they're a bad idea
S0607	no one should do it
S0644	no one should do it and then she do it so you can't that's that be hypocrisy
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm
S0607	what i think be that how be it any different to how people with more money can get more things in all their areas of life people who earn more get more stuff include i can afford private school i can afford a big car i can afford a big house
S0607	i can afford a better holiday than you my kid can go to a better school i just don't see how it's any different
S0644	well i'll tell you if you like
S0607	cos otherwise you're gonna have to be a communist
S0644	yeah this be this be kind of erm the problem be it's it's the question of what kind of society do you want to live in do you want to live in so for example erm imagine if just take this this er imaginary scenario imagine if erm let me think here at the bottom line of it be that they would say there be certain things that everyone should have a fair start in and er an equal foot in those things should at least be health everybody everybody should be entitle to good healthcare and everybody should be entitle to a good education and what you do with that thereafter cos they're they're sort of whittle down as two of your basic requirements
S0607	mm
S0644	in life so you've get communism obviously which never work and then you've get er not that i know what i'm talk about particularly cos i've forget it all i use to know all about this stuff cos i do sociology anyway erm would say cos she's very kind and and fair and all the rest of it she'd say well everyone should have these basic tennets from which you like platforms from which you can then do what you want if everyone have the same healthcare erm
S0607	mm
S0644	and if everyone have a good education then you're start from a fair point in society and then it's kind of up to you
S0607	mm
S0644	to work harder
S0607	make make you can
S0644	make the most of it yeah whereas if you just say well erm er i've get more money than you so i i can i'm gonna have this and i'm gonna have that things like a car well you might say well that's not a necessary part of be well in life it's not it's not the main it's not the be all and end all
S0607	mm
S0644	but an education be a little bite more important than that and so's be able to have the drug or the operation or whatever be
S0607	mm
S0644	would of course be erm in favour of that
S0607	i mean we be lucky in our country cos we have the nhs which i for so many years didn't realise that everyone didn't have their own
S0644	yeah
S0607	national health system
S0644	i know
S0607	and that obviously everyone's always complain about it but it's actually free health system and and
S0644	yeah
S0607	where we be now in america they don't have it
S0644	no bang in trouble if you get ill here
S0607	be they still in the middle of be they get one
S0644	i dunno what they i don't really understand it cos
S0607	no
S0644	sometime you can you can call an ambulance and people will turn up
S0607	yeah but i you know on my er program which be all base on real life
S0644	yeah
S0607	so like on grey's anatomy which be obviously a really intelligent thing to bring up
S0607	i do wish that i could have these conversations like go yeah but on the good wife
S0607	well yeah but on grey's anatomy this bloke right
S0607	but it's true on grey's anatomy this guy come in need emergency treatment have no insurance and they weren't able to do it so he die
S0644	oh
S0607	although there be one time when one of the surgeons just like pop his top what do you call it blow his top off
S0644	yeah
S0607	do it anyway but then he get into trouble erm
S0644	yeah
S0607	who be gonna pay for it cos it be like twenty thousand pound surgery and all this stuff so
S0644	yeah
S0607	and it be a bite like seriously they're not gonna save your life
S0644	yeah
S0607	cos you haven't get insurance
S0644	yeah well that's the extreme of it isn't it that's where you're go if you're not careful with private healthcare and private school and all that sort of thing if you're not careful with it it end up it will end up be like that that's what the whole problem be with the nhs at the moment be that they're try to sell off bits of it and i saw a documentary on it and i can't remember a bloody thing
S0644	about it but it be the impression i be leave with after watch it be that you can't believe that's what they're allow to get away with and it be all about how erm yeah basically it's be sell off part of it as a business for example erm so she work in the mental health part and erm they they make so many cut that they can't treat all the people that that need treatment and she say it's really have an effect it's really and they get absolutely nothing for free like everything's just so budget and make huge cut and it's no good it's really really no good but then on the other hand you see the benefit if you're gonna get into all the benefit side of things
S0607	mm
S0644	i don't think it help people that much either to give them stuff
S0607	no i don't
S0644	because it it actually just apart from that's unfair as well on the people that be pay to for everyone else to be give enough of everything for free
S0607	yeah
S0644	at the same time it doesn't help those people if you be naturally a little bite incline to sit on your arse
S0607	oh yeah you can totally afford to
S0644	and then someone say here you go you don't have to work you're not go to and then
S0607	the worst be when you hear about people who could get that job but they'd be better off on benefit well
S0644	but
S0607	i think the benefit should be less in that case
S0644	course it should course it should
S0607	for goodness sake
S0644	that's the thing but that's when there's something wrong with the system and the other theory be that they're try to do a population poll cos there be too many people
S0607	mm
S0644	so which i can actually believe we
S0607	help them
S0644	well we're not so sure we don't devise these social policies but yet i can see that what's happen with these people that won't go don't go to work they're not educate erm they're all breed like rabbit
S0607	god
S0644	those children then have children they're all into drug and gang and
S0607	benefit
S0644	all get like stab and and
S0607	the scrotes breed scrotes
S0644	oh god but what happen be and i read this er cos i be think it and then i read it in an article it say like there'll basically be a mass decline of population cos sooner or later if you've get there's ill health it follow suit like
S0607	yeah
S0644	if you've get unemployment then there's ill health and then then there's drug and alcoholism and all that sort of thing that go with it and then there's gang and it's just a mean of kill people off
S0607	yeah
S0644	and it's almost as if that's be facilitate by this because you cannot like let a a population like that breed and then there's no consequence to it
S0607	yeah
S0644	but then it's all part of the theory of everything so it doesn't
S0607	mm
S0644	in the in the great scheme of things everything's all unfold as it's go to anyway there's not that much of a difference do you see what i mean
S0607	yeah i be wonder back to the health thing when everybody everybody should have the same just go with the health not the education for now
S0644	mm
S0607	in order for everybody to have the same healthcare what have get to happen have the government get to make the nhs better so that nobody need private healthcare because for example mm somebody need an urgent operation but they've get to wait three months
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm if they can afford it they can oh my goodness
S0644	oh wow
S0607	if they can afford it they might decide to pay for it because they might survive then or no i don't know
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm so in order for this to stop need to happen the government have to improve the nhs right or
S0644	i have now decide that's gonna be one of the first things i thoroughly read erm when i get back home because
S0607	it's in the top
S0644	it be
S0607	read about stuff or know stuff cos i feel like i don't know anything
S0644	it's murder well there's always more to know see my
S0607	where should we start
S0644	private health care
S0607	no but i mean in general if i wanna know more erm cos i don't only wanna know more about stuff i'm interest in i want to be able to have an intelligent opinion when i vote and stuff like that
S0644	yeah it's constant
S0607	so and then so one thing be the newspaper but you get wrap up in news but they do
S0607	it be informative as well
S0644	mm
S0607	but how else could you do it maybe you do a bite of news how how else i mean do you have to read like factual book basically cos this might be a struggle for me
S0644	erm
S0607	ted talk
S0644	yeah
S0607	have you see ted talk i've only see one
S0644	yeah yeah yeah yeah they're good
S0607	so i'm not let you say anything i'm ask you and then carry on talk
S0607	so so how can we do it how can we become
S0644	you do just have to read and read and read i one this lecturer that i have be really good he say about there's nothing worse than have an opinion if you don't know he say we all do it he say but there's nothing worse than have to listen to people that know a little bite about a massive subject and don't know the whole thing there's nothing else yeah
S0607	yeah so they rant on and on and then
S0644	he say there's nothing else for it you just have to read and read and read and read and read and it's true
S0607	cos it be embarrass like if we be in the car with someone who actually know load of stuff sorry i don't mean that i don't mean that you but
S0644	that's usually me yeah that's usually me with and
S0607	and then
S0607	you'll be there go i think nana na na na na na and they'll go erm but didn't you know that blah blah blah and you'll and then you feel like a complete idiot
S0644	yes and no right because it's a massive subject even just this right because here's the thing say and they're much much cleverer than i'll ever be but sometimes well obviously everyone's entitle to an opinion and sometimes it just come down to how nice you be as with i say to at one time cos we be have a heat discussion about this thing which can i tell you about it now
S0607	mm i'm so glad cos i be worry the other day literally worry go we've forget all the topics and i be get really mad that we hadn't write it down
S0644	no
S0607	you know in
S0644	this be the sort of thing that i say would happen
S0607	in the middle of the night it be like but that's a whole topic but you should have write down every time we say it's a whole topic because
S0644	oh yeah we can't it now yeah
S0607	now everything we've calm down and forget what they all be
S0644	no this be but i know this would happen cos we'd be talk about stuff in general and then something would come up that would remind me
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm on the subject of private healthcare i've just gotta tell you quickly cos my grandad be very very very erm socialist and there be a time when he be ill
S0607	be that a ladybird
S0644	yeah anti margaret thatcher basically i'm sure there's more to it than that but he be very anti margaret thatcher anyway he erm be very ill and he could totally afford to have this operation but he refuse on the principle he say why should i push in front of somebody who's wait wait longer if it be me he he'd do it do you know what i mean he would pay for it and he wouldn't think twice about it but for himself my nan always say that like if it be for somebody else he'd do it but he have his principles
S0607	mm
S0644	and he say why should i push in front of somebody who erm and then there be an argument that it reduce the list because there's a
S0607	you're do
S0644	you're do and this private one be it's be do privately so it's off the the general list
S0607	i wonder how it work if in the
S0644	but someone say
S0607	the private guy's gonna be busy no matter whether it's your grandad or some or someone else or be it that the private guy also doesn't the nhs stuff and therefore if your grandad isn't on the private no but then your grandad's still on the other list
S0644	what i be gonna say
S0607	but we don't know how it work do we
S0644	i've forget now
S0607	yeah
S0644	yeah no so someone say that it take him off that massive wait list
S0607	yeah
S0644	but then somebody else say would say do you think there's a load of surgeons sit round like twiddle their thumb just wait
S0607	no
S0644	for someone like they're all take up all the time and it's just really push i don't see this be why i don't know cos i've gotta find out
S0607	yeah we need to find this out
S0644	ye
S0607	also cos i've i sort of understand that maybe it's like i'm not sure this be always the case but i know that it's sometimes the case that it's the same surgeon whether you're private or not
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	but it but it's when you have it so you'll still be get i don't this be probably not always the wow that better
S0607	erm it's probably not always the case but i do understand sometimes that it could be the same guy so he have to divide his week between er the private and the nhs
S0644	yeah the private
S0607	on the other hand i think it could also be the case in some scenarios that if you're private you could insist on have the top guy
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm and then you might have to wait again er i'm not sure if that's true though whether you can say i want the top guy or
S0644	mm
S0607	even when you're private maybe you still just have whoever's go because er what i don't this i don't if this be a good example cos it's in germany though but erm so with my job because we're all like european not diplomats but we're like european institution employees
S0644	mm
S0607	so we all have erm health coverage because we're not german so we can't have the german health thing
S0644	yeah
S0607	so we have basically private
S0644	mm
S0607	erm but it's also europe wide so which cos everyone's from twenty eight different countries so you can actually be at home and still do it
S0644	mm
S0607	so i have to have this mole remove
S0644	mm
S0607	and erm i've have i'd be to all i'd be to a few different dermatologists about i can't remember what about though yeah mainly about moles
S0644	mm
S0607	so and they would just go so one dermatologist go so in england i'm use to have more check
S0644	mm
S0607	and then at one time it be really it be really great on the nhs they do photos of my moles because one of the main things about melanomas be when your mole change
S0644	mm mm
S0607	and if you can't really remember
S0644	mm
S0607	well especially on your back
S0644	mm
S0607	so take all these photos horrendous never look so i look like a corpse
S0607	i'd be out the night before and get drink and i'd get spot as well and i try to cover them up with a bite of foundation
S0607	and this woman's get the most clearest camera ever in the world obviously
S0644	oh how upset
S0607	so not only do she get the moles in in the most amaze way she also get like the pore
S0607	and the the bite of foundation there and like the spot there
S0644	ah
S0607	and then my toe look like look like an ogre and
S0644	ah
S0607	but anyway and that be back when i be gorgeous
S0607	so anyway so they take all these picture and i think that be really clever and in england nobody have ever say tell you what we're gonna remove that one it be always like we're gonna keep an eye on that one and that one i have a couple that be always a bite odd
S0644	mm
S0607	so anyway get to germany come to my yearly check up time so i think right i'll i'll find a dermatologist get my moles check immediately he's like we'll remove that one and maybe that one as well so i be like that one that one's never even be a thing like the one that they want to remove it's always be the dodgiest one
S0644	right
S0607	and in fact it annoy me now cos in england they use to go give where it be we'll we'll keep go with it we'll try and not remove it whereas i actually think later i don't give a shit what it look like because it's here
S0644	yeah
S0607	i don't know if you can see it the scar
S0644	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0607	yeah there's hardly anything
S0644	right
S0607	cos it be there they be like mm most people wouldn't wanna have it remove because in case there's a scar and then maybe you get marry and like there's a scar and and i just sort of go along with it but i actually think if there's any doubt that that might be a melanoma just get rid of it i don't care about a
S0644	yeah
S0607	okay it might be different if it be on my face i dunno so anyway
S0644	mm
S0607	everyone be like this one we'll really maybe we'll check this one every six months sort of thing get to germany we're have that off
S0644	right
S0607	but we're also have this one off this random one on my leg so i know
S0644	yeah
S0607	already i know something be up now there's a problem with this private insurance that we have at work which be that if because you're privately cover they do more things than what you need and it's terrible terrible terrible so they'll be like oh you've get a cough we'd better take some blood and do some test
S0607	and then it cost like three hundred and fifty euros which your private insurance pay for
S0644	have pay for
S0607	erm and at first you don't realise cos you're new and you kind of like go oh we need to do a blood test bloody hell
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm then the third time you're like you need to take more blood
S0607	no you don't so i start say
S0644	rip off
S0607	i've already have blood take two months ago so i'll get you the result of that then i would just forget erm so the point be i've get to try and like hurry up the point be that so i i know something be odd about that mole because the one on my leg do not it be like a totally normal mole
S0644	right
S0607	so i go to a second dermatologist
S0644	yeah
S0607	to get a second opinion
S0644	yeah
S0607	and he screw me over as well
S0607	but i be stupid cos i go in go i need a second opinion cos i'm pretty sure i'm be screw over but i shouldn't have do that i'm so stupid
S0644	why
S0607	i should have go in just and not tell him anything cos he be like
S0644	yeah
S0607	oh really who's screw you over
S0607	and he's desperate for me to tell him the name and be a i'm really disappoint with myself because i didn't hadn't do do my assertiveness course so i didn't know to pause and think
S0644	yeah
S0607	i just say the name and i didn't wanna tell him the name
S0644	yeah yeah yeah
S0607	cos this guy be clearly an arsehole and he be rub his hand with glee
S0607	go erm and be his english not very good
S0607	you know and all this stuff so anyway this guy when i get my bill
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm so he i can't remember what he'd say now about the moles because it all get overtake by the fact that he send me a bill and on it be this thing say take culture and send to lab well he didn't
S0644	mm
S0607	he never take any culture so i call up go what culture you didn't do any culture and and he be really awkward on the phone so anyway
S0644	oh
S0607	i be like right now i'm totally screw so do you know what i do i remember that the dermatologist that i'd see in england
S0644	yeah
S0607	be german
S0644	yeah
S0607	so i actually call him my mum be a bite like oh don't bother him but i call him and i say listen dr
S0607	i'm in germany now and i just can't seem to get anybody trustworthy
S0644	yeah
S0607	what would you do and he say well at first he be a bite like cos these er dr have tell my mum that he's gonna have to retire early cos he's so stress so you can imagine the sort of
S0644	ah
S0607	be i in the be i in the be i in the right bite of the road
S0644	oh
S0607	get onto that lane as soon as i can i think it be one of those where it like yeah
S0644	yeah yeah yeah you be actually but
S0607	erm
S0644	it's a bite tricky that weren't it
S0607	so he be a bite like stress out but then he say look i don't know any dermatologists in frankfurt but there's one thing i do know be that if i be in germany i would go to the university hospital
S0644	yes
S0607	so i be like oh dr you have really help me cos he be like i would say that they be reliable so after that i always go so by by this time i've be to two dermatologists my private health never say anything about all these like opinions
S0644	mm mm mm mm
S0607	go to the proper hospital and they do indeed remove that mole erm but i just suddenly felt like i be be see by cos this university hospital i'm not really sure how it work but it feel a bite more a bite more like nhs where they're really busy and they're not gonna remove it if you don't need it
S0644	can i just tell you this be what the problem be when you've get private because all of a sudden there's a buck to be make and then
S0607	yeah but you see i never have i never think that before i go to germany
S0644	mm
S0607	it be like as if people be like you could see us come ten miles off i i don't know how to explain it
S0644	yeah that that's probably cos you there's this huge private erm
S0607	but do you know what the key thing be you don't have to be refer
S0644	you can just go
S0607	you can just bugger off to any specialist you want whereas in england it's really good you have to be refer even if you want to go private
S0644	mm mm mm
S0607	so you can't just be have load of things do
S0644	turn up
S0607	and i just believe i really believe this and it's not just because i'm bias against germany
S0644	mm
S0607	i really believe from my experience
S0644	mm
S0607	cos i have do have some private things do in england cos i've have several job with private stuff
S0644	mm
S0607	i really believe they don't do it if it doesn't need do whereas in germany
S0644	mm they
S0607	i've talk to a lot of people and we and we come to the consensus that usually blood test things
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm they they will do it unnecessarily and i find that to be so horrendous
S0644	mm
S0607	and and i genuinely don't think it happen in england now of course it might happen sometimes but i think we've get a really good system cos you have to be refer so you
S0644	mm
S0607	know how well i me and your friend please can you refer me to the cardiologist
S0607	no yeah but honestly i think there's something wrong with me you can't you can't get rid
S0644	yeah
S0607	and even if you go private you can't
S0644	yeah
S0607	you have to have a referral so you can't just wave your money around
S0644	yeah
S0607	and go i want to see a cardiologist your gp have to decide it's necessary and i think this be a really important safety net because you know someone like me
S0644	mm
S0607	there i be at the doctor and they're go
S0644	mm mm
S0607	i reckon i should do load of blood test well i'm gonna get nervous cos i'm think maybe it be necessary or be it you know how you should be able to trust them
S0644	mm
S0607	and i think it's really outrageous but anyway so i end up at the university hospital it felt much more like nhs type place
S0644	yeah
S0607	where they're really busy and they wouldn't be do it if it didn't need do
S0644	yeah
S0607	so i be so grateful that i find that
S0644	yeah
S0607	and actually over the last five years i've have three moles remove there
S0644	oh
S0607	erm and they be a bite more preventative i think cos but they be the three major moles that in england they be always like gonna have to keep keep keep an eye on that one in germany they're a bite more like we need to get rid of this cos one day it's gonna turn erm
S0644	well i think why not why not just get rid though in in the first place
S0607	yeah i get rid of them and now i'm i feel better because they be my major ones
S0644	yeah
S0607	i've still get a few other big ones i've get so many little ones that
S0644	yeah
S0607	but the the whole point be erm it's so bad that you can just and you can't trust them
S0644	but that that's what i think be half the problem when there's money involve with things
S0607	yes
S0644	it just like anything like once you start introduce a buck to be make but then
S0607	but i i genuinely do think that maybe we could find out for sure
S0644	yeah
S0607	i genuinely do think in england
S0644	have
S0607	we've get a safeguard in place
S0644	have spout about it now for half an hour i realise that i really do have to go and read about this properly cos i don't know anything about it all i know be the nhs be a god be a be a fantastic thing
S0607	yeah
S0644	and we should keep it and it's this thing call tpp or ttp that's try to corrupt it basically there's a whole documentary on it that's really good erm and that's why hospitals be go down the pan a bite as well because yeah anyway can i just tell you then about this thing i be die to tell you so all the moles be alright now
S0607	yes
S0644	good
S0607	i'm i'm surprise i haven't show you the latest scar
S0644	mm
S0607	cos i actually find it a really big thing have them off cos it's not a major operation but it's still i find it terrify but anyway don't let me go on about that cos that'll just be me again now
S0644	best to have it do though i think always best to have it do
S0607	yeah well if there's i i think i would with the mole
S0644	mm
S0607	i would rather do the preventative thing and if i'd say in england age ago i don't care about the things what she keep say
S0644	quality
S0607	and you know if you ever get marry you'll wish you hadn't get that scar i wish i have say no just remove
S0644	i don't care
S0607	i actually don't care that much about you know
S0644	isn't it funny what some people say with things like that
S0607	mm but anyway er yeah but just oh no i'm go on for too long but there be just one other thing which be that possibly also in germany they're a bite more scissor happy anyway so
S0607	apart from the money thing i go about my knee
S0644	mm
S0607	cos i go ski and my knee be play my knee's have be exist problem for years and years and years
S0644	mm
S0607	and it have really really swell up and like go rigid it's cos i hadn't
S0644	mm
S0607	it's cos i hadn't erm sorry it's cos i hadn't exercise before i go go to the knee guy in germany and he be like let's operate and luckily i know about my knee so i be like
S0644	mm
S0607	er er
S0644	no
S0607	hang on a minute and then i just wait till i be next in england and i go to my old knee guy who
S0644	mm
S0607	saw it when i first do the injury when i be sixteen
S0644	mm
S0607	and he be like i wouldn't operate erm you've just aggravate it and again if you operate now erm he say i would only operate on it if you say to me i'm i'm a serious athlete and
S0644	yeah
S0607	this be cause me a problem
S0644	mm
S0607	and he say otherwise if i operate on it now i could make it worse and it's much better for you to just carry on make it worse
S0644	mm mm mm
S0607	and i be just like
S0644	mm
S0607	what if i'd just go oh okay operate on it didn't need do okay now i'm shut up you carry on about your thing
S0644	no i see the point i i do see the point the of it all and it's a bite like religion in that respect because it's almost as if erm there ain't really one somebody else might think well yeah if i can have it do i'll have it do i can do it
S0607	yeah
S0644	whatever it be do it but then there's other people who think why would i wanna have an operation if i don't need an operation
S0607	exactly yeah
S0644	and not only that but the two doctor may genuinely think you don't know it sound a bite like they're they're up to no good in germany but
S0607	yeah
S0644	two two different people might honestly think
S0607	exactly yeah yeah
S0644	that thing and they're do what they think be the best thing as long as they're do what they think be the best thing it's fine
S0607	yeah and it's the doubt over that that's the worry
S0644	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and when you introduce a quick buck to be make that's when you don't really know like what what's go on erm
S0607	anyway now tell me the thing
S0644	well what i be gonna say cos we we be talk about how much we don't know about anything and it make me think of this occasion which i will now launch into
S0644	cos the moral of the story be me and and all sort of disagree mostly disagree with me which be fine but they disagree not because one of us necessarily know more than the other i don't think it's just that they're nicer than me if you see what i mean so there wasn't really a you be definitely right and you be definitely wrong it's more like who who be the nicer person
S0644	which be them but that doesn't mean that she'd be cos there might be right i'll tell you this story then it might be clearer
S0607	that's interest yeah
S0644	then it might be clearer so in one of my job erm be in wherever it be and at lunchtime i find that there be a a court nearby and i love court and go and listen in the erm
S0607	oh yeah you tell me
S0644	do i tell you
S0607	you keep go in and listen
S0644	oh it's probably something i mention to you age ago cos i want to tell you
S0607	be you allow to eat your sandwich when you're in there
S0644	no no no
S0607	no
S0644	well i don't think i don't think mm i dunno actually erm if you see a loo
S0607	yeah i be just think
S0644	it's not urgent for me
S0607	we might be in an area where we could actually go to the loo
S0644	state park at night it's nice this place
S0607	i be also think about you know bag
S0644	oh yeah if you see any handbags and souvenirs
S0607	if we be at home we'd know just where to go and get a little holdall wouldn't we
S0644	yeah oh but one's bind to turn up so anyway i go to this court and it's a criminal court so the first place i go into now i sit down i walk in and there be only a lawyer who i think be a lady possibly and so i go to go and sit in the public gallery bite and there be another chap who be the solicitor and then there be this man in there now this man as soon as i walk in he be like smile at me look at me like that and i'd like
S0607	in a worry way
S0644	well just like erm inappropriate not not to the extent that it would be frighten or anything but there be only three it's a room where you can you know what everyone else be do cos there be only a few of us so basically what i'd what have happen i'd walk in the during the recess and we be wait for the jury to come back in and for the the person on trial to come back in and the judge to come back in so i be wait for that so in the meantime there be only me and they're people do think like why be you sit in there what's what's which be wrong be wrong really cos it's a public gallery you can go and see it
S0607	be it be it can you do yeah yeah
S0644	yeah anyone can go in that's the whole point
S0607	yeah cos sometimes the judge shut it off when it's really
S0644	yeah
S0607	everyone's shout and yell
S0644	yeah well you've get the jury
S0607	get on tv
S0644	and then it's where the family wanna sit if they wanna sit in on it or where journalists wanna sit if they wanna sit in it or public gallery anyone's allow in so in i go and this man be go i know you can't watch but you can feel my eye
S0644	and he be go
S0607	and be he in the public gallery as well
S0644	no it turn out he be the translator
S0644	so and he be go
S0607	you see i get enrage when people do that and i get like do you mind
S0644	well i i think to myself as much as i'd like to think it's cos i'm look really stun
S0644	it be more and i just think you know not to do that i think even if i be look really stun you
S0607	he shouldn't be look at you like that because it's
S0644	well especially in a court right because there there be basically there be him me another person and another person and everyone can see what everyone else do you know want i mean so it be sort of obvious erm if there's four people in a room you know you can see what everyone else be do you can you can see what everyone else be look at what everyone else be do of and so it be just more like you now this be where it's gonna sound a bite like fascist but the only time people do things like that be in pubs or club or
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm
S0607	you wouldn't
S0644	in an office or
S0607	no
S0644	anywhere professional where you have to act professional you wouldn't do that
S0607	presumably not in a court either
S0644	well you'd think so i i be think to myself and in the end i just didn't like look i be just not look but every time i look back it be
S0607	if i turn leave it's because i'm gonna take us to a toilet so just
S0644	oh okay
S0607	yep
S0644	there's a casino why don't you go and spend some money
S0607	so you stop look at him
S0644	right so you get the idea and it's really like
S0607	mad with this kind of stuff
S0644	well normally i don't if if it wasn't in a
S0607	really intrusive
S0644	i don't think it's that it's more just inappropriate it be more like inappropriate because most people know not to do that in certain place
S0607	yeah
S0644	do you see what i mean erm i reckon we could have go into the casino hotel
S0607	do you
S0644	yeah to use their loo just
S0607	oh i never think of that ah
S0644	don't worry now go to the next one there'll be more there's always more than one casino
S0607	i be gonna it be there be erm
S0644	it's not
S0607	it's not very good where i be take us either in comparison i be gonna it say kfc leave and i think that's the kind of place where you can sneak in a new use the loo without them notice whereas i'd see a best western and be think probably with our accent they'll let us use the loo
S0644	if you go in and say excuse me
S0607	excuse me but be it possible to use your toilet
S0607	then they
S0644	oh there's one
S0607	a best where where
S0644	hotel
S0607	hotel where
S0644	oh it's a bank sorry it's a bank
S0607	right okay
S0644	look hotel don't it
S0607	probably not in the bank they're gonna let us but now have see this kfc sign again probably the casino be the best place shall i go back to the casino
S0644	it's up to you
S0607	let's see if there's somewhere to turn round
S0644	oh we're come to now we're come into
S0644	furniture
S0607	that kfc thing be one of those where there's a sign it tell you that it's come up and then it doesn't tell you when it's actually there
S0644	we're still on the one 0 one excellent i just wanna be
S0607	cos actually do you know what we could do if we
S0644	what
S0607	like keep go for like ten minutes there might be a diner where we could have a cup of tea or something
S0644	a coffee
S0607	i mean do you fancy one
S0644	sure thing we're suppose to be like take in the
S0607	oops
S0644	well do we're suppose to be take in the american culture
S0607	yeah which be basically diners
S0644	yeah and kfcs
S0607	okay anyway so
S0644	right
S0607	he be look at you and you're like ignore him
S0644	so you get the gist well it be more it wasn't scary or like it didn't make me angry but i just look it's really inappropriate like most people would just
S0607	yeah
S0644	know not to do that and he just shall we look out for a diner
S0607	yeah
S0644	be there anybody in
S0607	motel
S0644	house it's properly fall apart
S0644	oh i love these cherry blossom tree i love them i
S0607	ah ugg boot bike shop centre i think be where everybody do white water raft and stuff
S0644	oh really
S0607	but i could be make it up could be make it up so
S0644	we're go over a bridge
S0644	look at that
S0607	oh no be this that bridge
S0644	be it what bridge it be a bridge
S0607	oh god okay let's stay calm there be a bridge i saw on a photo and i be hop we weren't go on it
S0644	oh look hop you wont go on it
S0607	it's a really it's a really tall bridge
S0607	it might not be the one i saw
S0644	oh
S0607	actually when you're on it you can't tell
S0644	it ain't that high up though
S0607	but we need to check later to find
S0644	if it's that bridge
S0607	a picture of the bridge but i think the one i saw be at a different place i i can remember the name if i think hard enough it be somewhere else
S0644	oh look
S0607	excite
S0644	look love to go for a swim in that provide there's no shark or crocodiles
S0607	be it too much of a pain for you to carry on tell me because now we're on high alert
S0644	oh what for erm sorry no i will cut to the chase of this of this erm story right so man come in and it transpire that this man the ogler be a translator
S0644	and it's horrible but i have to tell you it be it be a rape case or an attempt rape case
S0607	oh no oh no
S0644	and the solicitor god
S0607	yeah don't look
S0644	so i'm listen to it all and it be horrible and erm the solicitor be ask question and without go into too much detail erm i deduce
S0644	from this fact erm hang on so the way the bloke be talk about it the solicitor get him and it there be no question of him not understand cos the the translator be there
S0607	yeah
S0644	so there's no question of him not understand properly and the solicitor be so good and it make me think about how if you be a solicitor you have to be erm me and be talk about it after and it's a battle of wits like you can't lose your temper
S0607	yeah
S0644	you can't start call name
S0607	you just have to be clever
S0644	you have to be very very clever keep your cool at the same time maintain a tone that let you let them know what you think of them basically cos you're you're try to prosecute them
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm and it's so be this true and be that true and in the end and the bloke what it really really seem to me like be like he be try to make out he didn't understand but he couldn't do that cos he have the translator
S0607	yeah
S0644	and it make me think do people do that a lot like pretend that they don't understand
S0607	yeah
S0644	anyway erm it come down to some detail about something because what they be try to do be escalate his charge from sexual assault to attempt rape which be obviously more serious and they get longer
S0607	yeah
S0644	for it and plus it it be that by the sound of it totally be so that's what they be try to get him do for
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm and the bloke be ask him the question and in the end he he say something like cos the translator be be erm he be speak it all the bloke be talk but obviously the translator be
S0607	mm
S0644	the translator at one point he say take it alright assault her i sexually assault her take it take it in other word he be like i'm feed up with the question yeah i do it alright he he be he be so and he have this look on him of like the whole time
S0607	bloke the bloke
S0644	the the one who'd be charge
S0607	yeah
S0644	yeah he have this look on him that be like you know when you've you've be accuse of something and you've do it and you don't and then you look piss off cos you've be catch
S0607	you just yeah yeah
S0644	it be like that now i think if someone have charge me with do something that i haven't do i would be look the whole time at the he wouldn't he didn't really wanna look at the the solicitor he wouldn't look at him erm and he be just very
S0607	and you would be you would be like
S0644	no this happen no that happen
S0607	yeah
S0644	no and i know that cos i've be in court plenty of time
S0607	yeah
S0644	so you can't use that as a as in he's intimidate by the the you know what i mean like he
S0607	yeah
S0644	i dunno i dunno so if you haven't do something and this again come down to vibrations a bite
S0607	yeah
S0644	because i just think his whole demeanour be be guilty
S0607	yeah
S0644	and isn't that a bite like you can't trust that cos that's just your interpretation of their demeanour you can't judge people base on you think oh yeah he's do it but
S0644	people if you can't look at someone there be a reason why you can't like body language have be study to
S0607	yeah
S0644	show that it it happen for a reason it it's base on i can't stick to one subject ah
S0644	but so the bottom line of it be and the so it seem to me like he's go yeah whatever i do it i do it i'm feed up with be question you know like how you would say if you be guilty be find out guilty
S0607	yeah
S0644	and then you you just feel like have a tantrum basically he be horrible he be horrible he be horrible
S0607	ah
S0644	and the story be so poor like his and it there be no chance of it be misinterpret because he have the translator there be no chance of
S0607	yeah
S0644	maybe it's lose in translation
S0607	yeah
S0644	cos he have this this translator who be there now erm apart from the rest of the issue that be about this i say to the girls when we be talk about it i say i think that's a cultural thing because i say oh that be it at one point he say something stupid like erm i do i i have a mother i have sister or something something like that as in
S0607	mm
S0644	as if he felt like by say that he be gonna get himself some erm
S0607	yeah
S0644	leeway by say that as if you could just say that it as if he be
S0607	yeah
S0644	it matter so little really but if i at least pretend to show a bite of remorse then people will buy it
S0607	yeah
S0644	and then that's good enough for my country that's what it seem like so i think he be middle eastern
S0607	mm
S0644	by the lingo and i think to myself i think that it's things like that can be cultural as well as just be an arsehole
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's a cultural thing where that's just a little bite more acceptable
S0607	yeah
S0644	where you come from it's just you may have a mum and a sister but
