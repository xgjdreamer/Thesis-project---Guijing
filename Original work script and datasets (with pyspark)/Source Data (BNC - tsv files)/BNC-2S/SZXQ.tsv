S0120	if you like not fuss
S0058	not fuss we will see how it go and like i say you might not be able to hear it
S0120	ah so reveal my deepest darkest secrets
S0120	would be um a gamble
S0058	yeah ah
S0120	hm
S0058	i've be watch too much friends it doesn't take much before you're a bite like ah friends i'm sort of alternate
S0120	yeah
S0058	between friends and magnum
S0120	that's probably not much healthier
S0058	i dunno there's more to look at the first episode of this series that we buy you know how normally it's a bite ridiculous it's kind of magnum uncover some kind of crime two massive heavies try to beat him up he win hurrah the end generally there's some pretty girl involve you know how it's normally quite formulaic and quite silly
S0120	yes
S0058	well
S0058	yeah the first episode of this well the first two episodes it be a double parter and it be just completely different it be actually really disturb and frighten so er it be like it be this girl who come to him say you know i don't know if i'm just be paranoid but i think someone's try to kill me um and he say yeah of course and er he he's very quickly fell in love with this girl um
S0120	of course
S0058	er of course yeah
S0120	of course
S0058	well he actually fell in love with her rather than just be like hm she's quite hot um and
S0058	um it's kind of you know it transpire that her er this girl and her twin sister have be kidnap as children and she er the sister be put er you know accord to the girl they persecute this other one and her twin sister have be horrible to her and but the other twin sister say oh and she try to kill me a number of time and it's all get quite quite deep and quite um whatever
S0120	be they identical twin
S0058	they're identical twin yeah
S0120	oh dear
S0058	yeah
S0058	um but you know that be fairly standard magnum fair but then he drop her off at her house and um like the nice twin sister he drop her off at her house and um then you like you you sort of have a view of like from behind like a wall like that so you could see them so there be someone in the house and you're like oh my god and then you leave her there in the house um and and then the end er so it end with her ring him go i think i've er i think i've kill someone can you come round and like help um and you be like oh my god um but they search the house and there's no trace of any blood any body anything at all and it be like uh what's happen you know um and it kind of oh you know the tension ramp up and ramp up and then there's a scene you know the er the er you you know there be someone in a cupboard watch magnum in the shower through this cupboard and it be properly scary and horrible um but then it transpire just to make matter worse that the the other twin the nasty twin well the the the second twin sister have actually be kill when they be kidnap and this other the first twin have multiple personality disorder and have be sort of do both of them and it be just really horrible er you know and sort of quite dark um but not at all
S0120	wow
S0058	yeah you know what magnum's normally like and it be just like right wow yeah
S0120	normally it's just drive around in a fancy car
S0058	mm
S0120	joke about higgins' britishness
S0058	exactly yeah and we watch this and we be just like oh my god what's happen to magnum and then watch the next episode and we be like oh it's alright he's back but it be such a tour de force it be great you know it be really good couldn't sleep that night
S0120	hm bite like watch the kill
S0058	still haven't watch that
S0120	mm
S0058	be it out on dvd
S0120	i'm sure it be yeah oh god it's so good
S0058	well yeah you've you've be rave about it
S0120	mm
S0058	not just you i've hear um general good things and people say like it's a return to sort of like slow pace slowly unfold tv rather than like
S0120	mm
S0058	half an hour everything happen type thing
S0120	yeah twenty hours
S0058	mm
S0120	everything happen
S0058	like brideshead
S0120	yeah or er ten hours in the second series
S0058	yeah
S0120	and then about ten minutes before the end of the final episode of the second series you think oh okay that's it they're
S0058	yeah
S0120	they're not gonna be make any more series
S0058	cos it's gotta end
S0120	but no
S0058	mm
S0120	actually there might be more series
S0058	oh
S0120	but um yeah it be quite traumatic
S0058	mm i quite like stuff like that though where you you at the end of it you're just like oh my god oh
S0120	yeah
S0058	er it's it's it's always good if it's actually have an effect on you rather than be like oh it's okay next
S0120	mm yeah
S0058	which be a tendency with a lot of like cos er yeah friends be a classic example doesn't you know you turn it off and you never think about it ever again you know
S0120	well
S0058	well
S0120	you can
S0120	ever think about it ever again but
S0058	yeah whereas you don't really have an option with some things which be good i like that
S0120	yeah
S0058	have you see let me in or let the right one in it's a vampire film but it's um it's so not a typical vampire film and that's the another sort of one of these things where just really really disturb it wasn't even that scary it be just it's about this you know young girl vampire
S0120	and it's call let me in
S0058	um um yes it's it's a it's an american remake on let me in it's an american remake of the swedish film which have the title um let the right one in um
S0120	oh right
S0058	which be um
S0120	mm
S0058	the basic premise be that a vampire can't enter your house unless you invite them in
S0120	which i know because i watch one episode of be human ever
S0058	i haven't see that
S0058	bbc3 isn't it yeah
S0120	it wasn't bad with one er from that one episode mm
S0058	mm
S0120	but er i'm not gonna get into it
S0120	anyway
S0058	mm
S0120	hm
S0058	no it's
S0120	another one
S0058	i won't spoil it but that's just massively upset
S0120	right more scandinavian tv
S0058	it's a
S0120	film
S0058	film rather than
S0120	film
S0058	yeah but it's um
S0120	okay but still
S0058	it's er apparently it's an almost if you er well i've we i've only see the american one but apparently it's an almost shoot for shoot remake you know um
S0120	oh that's good unlike all other
S0058	so
S0120	american remake
S0058	yeah um which kind of beg the question why remake it but i guess because americans a lot of americans won't watch film with subtitle
S0120	mm
S0058	slash peter won't watch film with subtitle slash
S0120	oh yeah
S0058	english people won't either um but
S0120	there's no problem with subtitle
S0058	mm
S0120	i totally
S0058	i don't get the
S0120	i totally forget that i be read subtitle when i saw crouch tiger hide dragon
S0058	i think
S0120	you notice it for the first
S0058	yeah
S0120	thirty second and then for the rest of the film
S0058	mm
S0120	you just take it in
S0058	yeah
S0120	as speech it's
S0058	exactly
S0120	mm
S0058	i think there's associations of work you know have to you know have to think er more than you should have to but you know
S0120	depend how easily you can read
S0120	i suppose
S0058	yeah
S0058	if you're watch subtitle in a language other than your own then yes it's probably quite difficult
S0120	yeah
S0058	oo but um i quite
S0120	it's sometimes helpful to have german subtitle
S0058	on
S0120	my my dad definitely find it helpful have subtitle even if they be in german for german
S0058	oh
S0120	watch german film
S0058	right i see
S0120	cos er
S0120	cos if you just can't then catch
S0058	mm yeah it's true
S0120	catch the word
S0058	it's easier to to read than er
S0120	than yeah rather than have a continuous line of sound
S0058	mm
S0120	you can see the separate word
S0058	yeah and i guess if someone's get quite a strong regional accent
S0120	mm
S0058	or i often think about that if um if there's like you know an english film where someone's get a very strong yorkshire accent or a very strong london accent you know subtitle it must be er must be fun
S0120	mm
S0058	be your dad like fluent in german then or er you know be it kind of
S0120	no um i mean he can understand a lot
S0058	right
S0120	um
S0058	yeah
S0120	have spend years of practice at understand
S0058	yeah
S0120	but he's never never until recently really have confidence speak
S0058	yeah
S0120	cos that require a bite more that require you to
S0058	mm
S0120	be use to put the word in the right order whereas
S0120	understand it
S0058	mm
S0120	doesn't require that
S0058	yeah yeah
S0120	you know um so since he's since he retire he's be
S0058	mm
S0120	um do german class
S0058	oh that's really cool
S0120	german
S0058	yeah that's interest
S0120	so yeah
S0058	so they meet in england then
S0120	no
S0058	oh
S0120	they meet in scotland
S0058	right
S0058	um
S0120	they meet on the isle of arran
S0058	very nice very nice
S0120	um on an hf walk
S0058	mm
S0120	hf holiday
S0058	mm
S0120	so
S0058	you do tell me that
S0120	i've tell you about hf stand for husband find
S0058	nice
S0120	apparent because it's happen so many time
S0058	that's really nice
S0120	and mm
S0058	well i guess it make sense like a common hobby you
S0120	yeah
S0058	you already have something you like
S0120	yeah walk holiday do tend to yeah you do tend to get a a a group that be quite you know similar
S0058	mm
S0120	so well lot of lot of teachers
S0058	that's interest
S0120	yeah
S0058	i wonder what the correlation be
S0120	mm
S0058	i think i've have enough sandwich shouldn't have have that croissant
S0120	mm well you've still get the tin foil you can have it later
S0058	mm yeah i've get an apple it's go really cool
S0058	yeah afternoon snack
S0058	mm
S0120	better than my afternoon snack my afternoon snack be probably er a snicker bar
S0058	i be i'm i'm
S0120	from the vend machine
S0058	mm i'm fond of a twix at three o'clock
S0120	mhm
S0058	twix and coffee
S0120	hm
S0058	very good but
S0120	what i should do more often be just um go up to the little kitchen area on the third floor where the vend machine be get myself a twix and a coffee or something like that
S0058	mhm
S0120	sit down on the little mini sofa
S0058	mhm
S0120	just have a
S0058	have a coffee break
S0120	quarter of an hour
S0058	very good idea
S0120	the first the first floor kitchen be be not so great cos one side of it be all glass and look out
S0058	mm
S0120	onto the onto the aisle
S0058	mhm
S0120	whereas the third floor kitchen be enclose and it isn't so close to work
S0058	yeah
S0120	and there's a er there's a sofa
S0058	yeah
S0120	but er
S0058	well we don't particularly like do that we sort of you know there isn't really a culture to have er coffee break but i like a coffee break um but customer service i think they have to like i think
S0120	mm
S0058	they have a half hour longer standard day which include two fifteen minute break i think the idea be they they more kind of contractually sit and stare at a screen whereas we in theory don't do it quite so solidly
S0120	yeah well we have um one customer service person pretty much
S0058	hm
S0120	um tanya the receptionist
S0058	mm
S0120	and er
S0058	nice
S0120	yeah i think i mean er she have to have fairly regular
S0120	break because someone have to cover for her at the desk when she
S0058	right
S0120	go up to have a coffee
S0120	or whatever
S0058	yeah
S0120	um
S0058	yeah we have quite a few receptionists they don't do very long like i think i think they do sort of half day shift which i guess make it easier
S0120	mm
S0058	on the er on the eye
S0120	mm
S0058	mm wow
S0120	you can really
S0058	row hand
S0120	you can really see where the skin have thicken
S0058	yeah
S0120	due to row can't you
S0058	you really can i guess that's the idea but
S0120	yeah
S0058	i wonder how long it take to disappear
S0120	probably not the most attractive
S0058	you look
S0120	well it take a long time to disappear i think
S0058	yeah
S0120	because i after not row for a year there be they be still
S0058	mm
S0120	pretty much there
S0058	wow
S0058	you can pretend to be like a a labourer you you dig all day
S0120	mm perhaps
S0120	mm
S0120	what they be do
S0058	water something probably
S0120	yeah
S0058	or play tea shop
S0120	urgh
S0120	don't drink that
S0058	my sister like when we all use to go out for lunch or whatever and parents'd generally have tea
S0120	mm
S0058	and um er you know like when they be finish there'd be a bite of tea leave a bite of milk and a bite of sugar or whatever
S0120	yeah
S0058	and my sister would always just make like concoctions largely sugar and then just put put tea in and stir it and mm
S0120	mm
S0058	and then try and get a parent to drink it no thank you dear oh i'm quite excite for her come should be nice

S0120	well
S0058	i dunno

S0058	he be er he be pretty good company
S0120	mm
S0058	mm
S0120	where be it in scotland that he be on about
S0058	um highlands so kind of ullapool
S0120	where where what what be the name of the place he be on about
S0058	lochside cottages be that what you you mean
S0120	it be a name begin with a t
S0058	oh
S0058	that's the one near carlisle

S0120	it's um pretty much directly west of inverness but on the other side of scotland
S0058	mm yeah yeah i think 's just the name of the cottages er like the the er i don't think it's the village or anything so
S0120	so be i get the impression tend to look at holiday cottages where they're like it's a it's a development of holiday cottages
S0058	um not exclusively
S0120	okay
S0058	not particularly um
S0120	just the ones that i've see
S0058	i think well the ones in scotland where we've be before which be really nice it's just sort of um three link together but it's like it's not a big development or anything it's just one big build that's divide into three
S0120	mm
S0058	um er i think the ones at yeah there's like a group of them but some of them aren't in the group obviously you know something like there's a few spread around um oh er sorry not exclusively and the one in wales be just by itself i'm quite keen for wales i haven't be for years

S0058	um which i'm not massively excite about um i like where i sit now i've get a nice view of everyone come and go and of the sign and the daffodils and
S0120	oh that's nice
S0058	it's gonna be tulips daffodils and the i can see tree and grass and sky it's lovely i imagine i'll be in some corner uh i like my pod i'm i'm very
S0120	yeah
S0058	attach to where i sit but we'll see
S0120	i'm fairly attach to where i sit it's partly a fear of the unknown
S0058	nice
S0120	um but it would be nice to actually be able to look out of a window
S0058	yeah
S0120	i mean i can look out of a window but er it's very it's quite a way away it's not it's not next to
S0058	mm
S0120	my desk
S0058	yeah i don't know how they're gonna arrange it whether they're gonna give like the important people the windows or whether they're just gonna or whether because we're slightly miscellaneous we'll end up on an edge
S0120	ah
S0058	also know as by the window which be what have happen at the minute i think which be really good it's the best seat in the house
S0120	mm
S0058	so i'm kind of get my finger cross for that but anne's like really er so she's you know look round and talk to people and find out what's go on and make sure we've get enough cupboards be really useful about the whole thing so i don't need to er worry too much about it i know i'll get the storage space
S0058	ah oh i'm i'm actually heat up this be lovely right that be stay at home tomorrow
S0120	i should've wear a black shirt
S0058	a what shirt
S0120	i should've wear a black shirt
S0058	yes
S0120	my legs be heat up more than my body
S0058	uh
S0120	hm so er yeah there be murmur admittedly come from the er unit manage director so probably quite um
S0058	quite loud
S0120	er authoritative
S0058	yeah
S0120	murmur that er we might be our build might be get a strip down and rebuild
S0058	oh you do tell me this
S0120	in like several years
S0058	er leave the outside up but strip it
S0120	well not necessarily even the outside
S0058	or completely
S0120	they're just leave the structural elements like the frame
S0058	oh okay
S0120	or whatever
S0058	right and take all the wall out
S0120	um yeah and extend the floor so that it's a wider build
S0058	yeah
S0120	which mean a lower percentage of people get window space i i guess
S0058	if er yeah
S0120	but
S0058	if it's wider and shorter then yeah
S0120	the idea would be to basically make it all new energy efficient et cetera et cetera
S0058	yeah
S0120	and it would be they'd add a floor on the top and they'd fill in the grind floor which be currently cos the building's on stilts
S0058	right okay
S0120	basically it's currently car park down there they'd fill in the grind floor
S0058	right
S0120	um
S0058	with just
S0120	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0120	um so then we'd have six floor they'd be wider floor
S0058	yeah
S0120	and you could get all of mott's staff into that one build rather than split across three build
S0058	oh okay
S0120	um
S0058	what just like be they further down the road or something do you mean or
S0120	well there's we've get one floor in twenty station road
S0058	right
S0120	and we've get er it's not quite so comparable but right next to the station
S0058	yes
S0120	you know where the step up
S0058	yes i do yes there's er yeah
S0120	next to the roundabout
S0058	yeah
S0120	er we've er get all of that um
S0058	oh
S0120	with the er build and infrastructure and health and education units
S0058	aha
S0120	um
S0058	isn't in there
S0120	not
S0058	be it not
S0120	it's
S0058	oh right
S0120	which be the education division of
S0058	i'm sure have something to do with
S0120	so yeah i'm not sure how start up
S0120	but it's be er it it's now part of
S0058	right
S0120	um
S0058	so it's probably connect to hence connect to cup
S0120	i'm not sure
S0058	i'm sure we talk about this before and find that it be actually
S0120	i might have to
S0058	i can't remember
S0120	wikipedia it
S0058	yeah
S0120	or something
S0058	there might be no connection at all
S0120	mm
S0058	i suppose
S0120	but yeah so maybe in about a year's time they
S0058	mm
S0120	will get around to implement that plan
S0058	where will you all go
S0120	i don't know
S0058	cos that's the that's the kind of
S0120	temporary locations
S0058	yeah
S0120	they'll like probably have to cram more of us into because there's
S0058	yeah
S0120	space there's some empty room there
S0058	oh right
S0120	um and yeah i'm not sure about the rest
S0058	mm
S0120	find somewhere temporary
S0058	yeah
S0120	work from home
S0058	i be just about to say yeah presumably anyone who can will work from home save them money
S0120	mm
S0058	that'd be good
S0120	um that'll be weird
S0120	and for that long might present some problems
S0058	mm yeah
S0120	dunno organizationally
S0058	yeah it would be um it's er a lot easier not to work at home i think
S0120	mm
S0058	or you could have er
S0120	but er
S0058	you could have er sort of um like er sort of some days a week you work from home some days you come into the office
S0120	yeah
S0058	which i think be maybe the easiest way so you don't need to be like über organize and have all your stuff cos you can go in and you know occasionally and get stuff and just keep swap round but then you only need half the desks
S0120	yeah hm
S0058	hm oh that's excite
S0120	and then it'll probably er take about a year for them to do it
S0058	yeah
S0120	and we'd have a brand new fancy build everybody'd fit in one build we only have to pay one rent
S0058	yeah
S0120	even though that rent would be then higher because it's higher value
S0058	yeah but and then of course the energy save and stuff
S0120	yeah
S0058	if it's er you know all jazzy and shiny and new would
S0120	yeah
S0058	presumably it's gonna save money in the long run
S0120	yeah um the md be say um people people get the impression we don't spend much on this build cos you know we haven't fix the
S0120	fix the windows
S0058	yeah
S0120	and that kind of thing but we actually spend a huge amount on the just to keep the build go
S0058	yeah yeah once it get to a certain point they probably presumably just decide yeah
S0120	yeah and it's it's partly because
S0058	stop throw money away
S0120	because this might be on the horizon that they're not prioritize small smaller repair
S0058	yeah
S0120	like replace carpet tile
S0058	yeah
S0120	or
S0058	yeah it's like um um
S0120	yeah
S0058	and twenty five they just stop repair it
S0120	yeah
S0058	it get manky because they be like well we're not gonna spend a penny on it
S0120	but
S0058	yeah
S0120	have you see it
S0058	i've be in i've be in one of them and it's all guesty and nice
