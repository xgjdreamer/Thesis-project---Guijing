S0024	that's really nice
S0024	yeah
S0144	er i be speak to earlier
S0024	
S0144	er
S0024	yeah
S0144	and he be say he's gonna try and renegotiate his contract have you hear about this
S0024	no
S0144	he's gonna try and renegotiate it to three years
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos have do that apparently
S0024	really
S0144	's change it from five years to three years
S0024	oh really
S0144	yeah
S0024	but she's a bite more she do more stuff than us
S0144	well why should that matter
S0024	okay well that's interest
S0144	yeah so i think five years just that sound like a long time doesn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean i know we've nearly do
S0024	mind you we've nearly do two
S0144	well we've do one and a half years already
S0024	we've nearly do two i can't imagine us leave just yet
S0144	no no but we're still
S0024	unless the
S0144	talk a year and a half away
S0024	yeah
S0144	but if we do that you know we don't have to leave
S0024	no
S0144	then we can just extend yearly
S0024	yeah yeah that's a good idea actually but
S0144	otherwise
S0024	you know well i suppose it's secure
S0144	otherwise if we
S0024	isn't it
S0144	but if we break the contract
S0024	you don't get the flight home
S0144	the flight and the baggage allowance
S0024	mm
S0144	what be it eighty kilos each
S0024	yeah yeah it's a lot
S0144	no that that'll cos us a you know probably
S0024	that's interest
S0144	about four or five thousand pound to send our stuff back
S0024	and the the job's pretty secure so it doesn't mean like
S0144	yeah
S0024	if we change the contract we're not at risk of get
S0144	no i think if
S0024	fire or anything
S0144	you know we the turnover's pretty quick really
S0024	yeah
S0144	after three years we'll be some of the
S0024	and the university be pretty solid
S0144	longest people there
S0024	they're they're do the biggest
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	more build
S0144	they're make millions
S0024	now mm okay
S0144	mm
S0024	yeah
S0144	i think it's something to think about
S0024	yeah
S0144	and then it will give us the option as well to change our maybe go fractional
S0024	well you can do that anyway i think
S0144	can you
S0024	i think the change the contract to go fractional cos there's be some people who do that this year
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean i don't wanna do it yet
S0024	no
S0144	but maybe you know
S0024	i think maybe
S0144	in a year and a half

S0144	and then we have i dunno how much holiday do they get when they're fractional
S0024	load have you hear they're all so chuff those new guy they're so chuff they're think of it they've get erm i dunno i don't know they get a week at christmas christmas

S0144	what happen america's be split into three different state after the second world war
S0024	it's i can't get out now i couldn't get in before
S0144	after the second world war and so japan and germany win the war and america have take er sorry japan's take control of the pacific side of america
S0024	right
S0144	and germany's take control of the of the east
S0024	be you come in here
S0144	and then the central america like centre of the unite state be like a buffer zone like the rocky mountains
S0024	so that's
S0144	it's like a neutral
S0024	that's more in the west isn't it
S0144	well
S0024	slightly
S0144	i don't know
S0024	yeah a little bite i think
S0144	well i'm only on the first chapter
S0024	yeah
S0144	but i just remember from what say so it's like hitler's be put into a an insane like a asylum
S0024	i think the whole point be that
S0144	no the the nazis have win they but they
S0024	the nazis have win
S0144	they've all go a bite a nut i think and
S0024	okay
S0144	they've wipe out everyone in africa and er how much shall we get two
S0024	yeah okay
S0144	erm and hey get back apparently it's gonna be
S0024	keep your hat on
S0144	about a guy who's write a book like a fantasy book to try and escape like the i dunno the situation and all that kind of like like a dream thing
S0024	what a story within a story
S0144	no he's gonna write a story about imagine if the ally force er have win the war
S0024	oh
S0144	but he's in an alternate dimension where germany and japan have win the war
S0024	oh okay
S0144	so it's all about him write this imaginary like dimension where the opposite have win the war
S0024	so i wonder how many then
S0144	yeah quite a few i should think but it's i mean i can tell by the first chapter it's quite a dystopian view but it'll be interest to see if actually it kind of portray our present time as dystopian or whether do you know what i mean
