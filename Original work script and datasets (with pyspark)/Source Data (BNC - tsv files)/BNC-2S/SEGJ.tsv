S0632	yeah i think we want a few more bits and bob like another grind mat and stuff didn't we
S0635	yeah cos have load us up with her really quite vintage camp stuff which be dent and burn and
S0635	kind of strange in all in ziploc bag and yeah we get a roll mat didn't we and maybe some other stuff
S0632	yeah i can't remember what we felt like we be
S0635	mm
S0632	conspicuously miss
S0635	but felt like we have a pretty good setup really
S0632	we be pretty well setup
S0635	better than some people i would have think but yeah
S0632	be the next night
S0635	so so
S0632	montaña de oro
S0635	after pfeiffer state beach yeah it must have be
S0632	wow i can't believe
S0635	where be
S0632	they be that close together
S0635	where do we have dinner after that be that maybe where we stop for that not that appeal fish place where it be like a beautiful
S0632	yeah
S0635	location but like
S0632	really good location but the food wasn't very good
S0635	yeah and it be quite expensive
S0632	but we pick up like some slim jims and spinach tortillas and a bag of grate cheese so we could make dinner at our campsite
S0635	yeah
S0632	i
S0635	i think i think we stop on monterey
S0632	do we stop in monterey
S0635	for i think either a walmart or a whole foods yeah but i didn't really get much of a sense of the place it be
S0632	remember drive through carmel at some point
S0635	oh yeah
S0632	it smelt amaze
S0635	and it be all sort of misty yeah it be amaze
S0632	and it smelt really strongly of pine and the sea
S0635	mm
S0632	it be just amaze but yeah that be gorgeous and we stop at some non chain supermarket that be quite expensive and we be worry that there be water come out of the bottom of our car do you remember that
S0635	oh yeah yeah that be much later it think
S0632	no that wasn't much later
S0635	no maybe a couple of days later
S0632	it be either that day or the day after i think
S0635	yeah i do remember yeah we sort of come up it be cos there's another highway more in slightly more inland from route one
S0632	mm
S0635	i think and we'd somehow get onto that for a while and that be like a small town there which be quite cool
S0632	mm
S0635	yeah i remember that
S0632	yeah and where be where be the place that we go to the antique place like that be on the road from somewhere to somewhere
S0635	oh that might have be that day
S0632	so yeah cos there be all these different campsites there be
S0635	mm
S0632	ventana which be easy
S0635	yeah
S0632	erm the private and then we go to montaña de oro which be a state park which be a state park which be
S0635	yeah
S0632	it be like the hardest ever what's the word i can't think cos i'm full of
S0635	er
S0632	not puzzle i guess puzzle will do
S0635	yeah
S0632	to work out
S0635	yeah cos we get
S0632	what where the hell our pitch be cos
S0635	we
S0632	no one be on duty
S0635	for one reason or i think it be hard to find in the first place er and then like we maybe drive around the whole kind of area like the state park and we find the main campsite but not no we didn't even find the main campsite do we like it be all really hard to find
S0632	we do eventually find a campsite but we be like
S0635	yeah
S0632	like well we're not pitch here cos we're pitch in the like i can't remember what they call them but like solo
S0635	yeah
S0632	campsites where you're the only person for a mile
S0635	uhu
S0632	but it be like well ours be call st seven or something
S0635	yeah
S0632	but and we be look at the map and there be nothing on there call st seven but there be deer and badger and rattlesnake and and eventually we somehow work out that like badger must be st one and you like there be a code and there be a name and they weren't often put in the same place
S0635	yeah
S0632	and i think and some place somehow we find both the name together so we could work out that our book be actually
S0635	yeah
S0632	call badger
S0635	it be a tiny
S0632	and then look for badger
S0635	it be a tiny photocopy hand draw handwritten map on a pin board in the in the park and that without that like we'd have just never find it
S0632	and that be like miles away from
S0635	yeah
S0632	the main campsite as well wasn't it
S0635	uhu
S0632	it be just like by the side of the road
S0635	yeah
S0632	and you could see it highlight
S0635	uhu
S0632	and it say
S0635	yeah
S0632	and then it say st one badger
S0635	yeah
S0632	and it be like oh so st one be badger and badger be up there but not before we'd already pitch in the wrong place and have people come and tell us we couldn't pitch there cos it be their pitch
S0635	yeah it be like look for a post it note in a national park literally
S0632	and
S0635	but we do actually get there after expend too much energy but we do yeah and we get up
S0632	yeah
S0635	get up the hill and
S0632	it be it be a knackering cos it's a it be a hike to camp the campground wasn't it so you couldn't drive there
S0635	it be
S0632	you have to drive as close as you could park your car and then hike well we'd already do that once in the wrong place
S0635	yeah so then we have to go back up unpack go back down again and load up the car go to the next one and then go back up and and i mean we end up do the hike maybe like seven or eight time i think in one yeah
S0632	i be so tire i be so tire
S0635	uhu
S0632	and that really gall thing be it be stunningly beautiful
S0635	yeah
S0632	and the sun be go down as we be like
S0635	uhu
S0632	finally pitch in the right place and i be like
S0635	yeah
S0632	if this be the wrong place i'm not move again
S0635	yeah
S0632	but i be get really upset cos we'd buy that nice like local wine and i want to sit up there and drink it as the sun go down
S0635	yeah
S0632	but instead we be like race the sunset and i be so tire
S0635	yeah
S0632	that be just that be like that be probably the lowest point
S0635	yeah
S0632	of the trip because on the whole it be a brilliant trip and even that
S0635	uhu
S0632	be great but it be just
S0635	uhu
S0632	there be that one even i be just really piss off because
S0635	yeah
S0632	i couldn't believe how hard it be to find out pitch we'd leave plenty of time to pitch before sunset
S0635	uhu
S0632	but we spend like over an hour look for our pitch and then probably another two hours pitch and re pitch in the right place
S0635	yeah yeah
S0632	but anyway i be quite happy because we do actually make it the thing be i wish we be stay for more than one night cos we stay for one night and we wake up in the morning after all the and bark noise all night
S0635	mm yeah it be
S0632	and then it be like we be on a cliff in the cloud we be up on a cliff overlook the sea cos
S0635	yeah it look totally different
S0632	like fog be so thick
S0635	mm and we saw like a little jogger run round like a little ghost somewhere on the distant cliff
S0632	all in white
S0635	yeah
S0632	yeah and we do do one of the little walk
S0635	mm
S0632	cos it say there be rattlesnakes that we have to be careful where we step
S0635	yeah
S0632	that be quite excite
S0635	famous for like california quail i think and rattlesnakes
S0632	mm
S0635	and
S0632	cos i think i saw we saw the quail
S0635	we do yeah
S0632	yeah but we didn't see any rattlesnakes
S0635	no
S0632	and yeah
S0635	yeah
S0632	and that be all good and then we felt filthy and we want to go to the madonna inn that really er kitsch place
S0632	uhu
S0635	for lunch but we be filthy and the facilities there weren't good enough for us to get clean in
S0635	yeah
S0632	so
S0635	and there weren't any
S0632	well there weren't any i think
S0635	yeah
S0632	there be some communal shower
S0635	i don't think there be
S0632	somewhere or well there be at least communal toilets that be just the worst
S0635	yeah
S0632	like they smelt so bad they be so filthy that
S0635	mm
S0632	you couldn't even like have a hand basin wash of any sort so
S0635	yeah yeah so we go to a whole foods and then i and freshen up in their bathrooms
S0632	i i get my wed gel nail take off
S0635	yes you want to the nail place
S0632	at the mall
S0635	and i go somewhere i think i go to like tk maxx to not buy any clothe while you be do that
S0632	while i do that
S0635	yeah
S0632	didn't take long it only cost me five dollars and they take them all off cos they start fall off with all the camp and it just look stupid erm yeah so we freshen up and no one would know would have know that we hadn't have a proper shower
S0635	yeah yeah no we do good yeah
S0632	and we be we go to the madonna inn and we have our strange lunch amongst all the insane decor
S0635	yeah
S0632	this barbie doll meet german beer house
S0635	uhu
S0632	and yeah eat heartily i think the antique place must have be on that day as well
S0635	i think it be too
S0632	but wasn't there something palace that people like really suggest and we drive up to but didn't go on
S0635	oh be that that day i think it must have be
S0632	yeah it be in that area
S0635	yeah erm hearst castle
S0632	hearst castle
S0635	yeah
S0632	cos that's really like chintzy and tacky too but it be it be quite expensive and you have to go like on their tour
S0635	it be really expensive you you have to yeah like
S0632	er and you couldn't like get up to it on your own you have to wait for a bus to come and take you to the actual place and
S0635	yeah
S0632	it's like quite a big time commitment
S0635	it would have take the whole day yeah
S0632	and we didn't have the whole day we we need to
S0635	mm
S0632	get to our next campsite
S0635	but we do kind of see it up on the hill and we
S0632	we saw it up on the hill yeah
S0635	stop in the kind of there be the centre here
S0632	look through the book
S0635	uhu
S0632	at the picture of what it look like
S0635	yeah
S0632	okay yeah okay
S0635	i think as european it's kind of like it would have be interest from like a cultural perspective but like not
S0632	i wasn't desperate to see it for its opulence
S0635	like yeah we've see a lot of really opulent old build don't have to see a fake one
S0632	that be that be real yeah
S0635	yeah
S0632	but erm we need to get to our next campsite anyway and
S0635	mm
S0632	that be a really nice one too
S0635	mm yes that one like like it be such a relief even though it wasn't like really fancy
S0632	it wasn't really
S0635	to have someone just be like oh yeah here's your spot we have wi fi like there's

S0632	you're right we do
S0635	cos i but i didn't feel like quite enough of one day
S0632	jeez though i mean
S0635	yeah
S0632	that not enough for one day like
S0635	no well i just know that we cram so much in
S0632	i really felt like we go on a
S0635	mm
S0632	different day but yeah i guess we do the watts tower first
S0635	yeah i be think that too
S0632	so i be so glad we go cos
S0635	uhu
S0632	you just have to ignore all that like hysteria about it be a bad neighbourhood and stuff cos
S0635	yeah all the tripadvisor things
S0632	it's like really and i felt bad for feel worry about go cos we be it there be just like children play outside and
S0635	yeah it be a really nice little art community
S0632	with a really nice community centre
S0635	yeah
S0632	and they have that that exhibition on thirty years and i still can't breathe and it make me wanna cry
S0635	yeah
S0632	i hadn't like expect that i'd expect to go and see this piece of outsider art that i'd read about a hundred time and i love
S0635	yeah
S0632	but erm we be wait in the community centre for the for our tour to start which
S0635	yeah
S0632	just turn out to be me you and the tour guide who be amaze
S0635	yeah
S0632	er so it be like a almost like a personal tour but
S0635	yeah it be great he be really sweet
S0632	while we be wait and i be
S0635	yeah
S0632	yeah while we be wait and i erm and i be look at all the artwork it it really hit me really hard
S0635	yeah
S0632	like i couldn't i don't know i just felt
S0635	well the area be part of that famous face riot wasn't it
S0632	yeah
S0635	i guess thirty years ago in the eighties or
S0632	it's historically
S0635	yeah and just sort of say how it still hasn't change and
S0632	but
S0635	but
S0632	yeah anyway that be an unexpected blow and like they kind of bring in the the history of the slave trade and er see like little union jack on the ship and things in the artwork
S0635	mm mm
S0632	and you're like oh
S0635	yeah
S0632	so yeah that be like an unexpected little little punch there i be really glad that we go for lot of reason
S0635	uhu
S0632	and the watts tower be just as amaze as i have expect them to be
S0635	yeah
S0632	erm
S0635	yeah better to be honest
S0632	well our tour guide be a really
S0635	mm
S0632	cool guy who really know a lot of little detail about it that you don't necessarily
S0635	uhu
S0632	get from the big book that just talk about it as an overall thing
S0635	yeah
S0632	you need more about like the layout of it and
S0635	yeah
S0632	like where the all the different bottle be from like what kind of bottle this be and
S0635	yeah and like his wife's high heel shoe or something
S0632	and her boot
S0635	boot stick in the wall
S0632	that he'd like set in the wall yeah
S0635	yeah yeah i think there's something about be inside like them you know like a that's what how they be mean to be see not like photos in a book or something
S0632	yeah like big cos they
S0635	uhu
S0632	that's the whole point of those
S0635	uhu
S0632	those large like environments that you actually
S0635	uhu
S0632	go inside and move around inside cos that's the way they're mean to be experience
S0635	yeah
S0632	it's it's a 3d immersive experience
S0635	uhu
S0632	so it be so good to be able to go
S0635	yeah
S0632	it would have be great if i could have go before write my dissertation but
S0635	oh i know
S0632	but it be it be really good to go have
S0635	uhu
S0632	like read so much about them to actually go
S0635	yeah
S0632	and be in them cos all of the theory that i'd write about be like you need to go and be in them
S0635	yeah
S0632	i be like i haven't be in these and i really want to
S0635	uhu
S0632	and you know that's part of their subversive power take over space and all that learn about his reason for stick it where he do cos the the cable cars use to go by but they don't any more
S0635	yeah
S0632	so it be all really interest
S0635	and now it's like the only reason that like white tourists would go to watts probably
S0632	would go there be to see
S0635	yeah yeah
S0632	that yeah
S0635	yeah
S0632	although some people have never hear of it they just seem like they'd stumble across it like those people who take our photograph for us
S0635	yeah i'm sure
S0632	cos that
S0635	there's a lot of people in la who like have never be there or hear it
S0632	yeah
S0635	yeah
S0632	i think that be really cool
S0635	mm
S0632	i love that
S0635	yeah that be great that really like make me happy see real outsider art mm
S0632	and those two days in a row wasn't it
S0635	yeah so i guess
S0632	just mm
S0635	the next day we just like we be just so please to see outsider art that we should just do that again
S0632	well we be
S0632	always gonna
S0635	yeah
S0632	go and see er
S0635	mm
S0632	er salvation mountain because
S0635	uhu
S0632	big big tick there
S0635	mm
S0632	and it be so funny have come from like ventana campground which be all lush and green and foresty and then just like less than a week later we be drive through the desert
S0635	mm
S0632	to to niland
S0635	niland yeah
S0632	almost almost in mexico
S0635	we stop at the elliott smith mural in echo park before
S0632	ah
S0635	that which be cool for me to see
S0632	yeah that be cool take your picture
S0635	yeah i don't think there be anything else
S0632	no
S0635	other than that except that yeah the landscape just completely change it's like to i mean to
S0635	dry dry dry and dry i mean it wasn't really a very pleasurable drive for the first hour or two maybe like it be like the sort of area outside of california
S0632	just sprawl
S0635	like big it just seem like big towns kind of endless it seem like a kind of rough place i dunno they just seem like harsh place to live like very hot dry
S0632	mm
S0635	boxy build
S0632	yeah cos there be little towns even
S0635	mm
S0632	quite far out in the desert and it just didn't seem like a fun place to live
S0635	yeah
S0632	quite rough look and freight train just hurdle through
S0635	uhu
S0632	i be just so hot
S0635	yeah we even run into like mexican border patrol didn't we
S0632	we do
S0635	even though we didn't cross the border
S0632	we didn't cross the border we be close enough but there be like some sort of checkpoint
S0635	yeah
S0632	and they
S0635	i think cos of all the train
S0632	they check our passports
S0635	yeah
S0632	and they must get so many people come down there to see salvation mountain though
S0635	yeah i think people either come for because they live there or to see salvation mountain or because they've hitch a ride from mexico on a freight train
S0632	well
S0635	i don't know
S0632	we come to see salvation mountain
S0635	yeah we be one of those
S0632	i be so excite
S0635	uhu
S0632	oh but oh my god it be hot
S0635	uhu
S0632	i think the moment i step out of the car you could feel the heat come from above and below like all the sand be like reflect the heat back up
S0635	yeah
S0632	i've never be so hot in my life
S0635	i'm not sure i have either yeah
S0632	it be just ridiculous but i be absolutely adamant to get out of the car and explore i think we spend a good half an hour out in the
S0635	yeah
S0632	sun er i think it be unfortunate the way it out cos it be pretty much midday
S0635	yeah
S0632	and we know we know we need to get there we like
S0635	and it be july
S0632	and and get back again so we need
S0635	mm
S0632	basically we couldn't avoid it be around midday
S0635	no
S0632	it could be slightly earlier or slightly later but
S0635	and there be there's nowhere to stay near there
S0632	no and you i don't wanna be stick out there
S0635	no
S0632	so but it be totally worth it be just
S0635	uhu
S0632	everything and more that i
S0635	uhu
S0632	expect it to be
S0635	yeah
S0632	and there weren't too many people there
S0635	no
S0632	and it be free
S0635	no and after and we hear the er caretaker yell at his wife which i
S0632	he do
S0635	think think be a strange juxtaposition to the message of peace and love
S0632	yeah and slab city nearby but it's like you know what if have to live in this heat i'd probably be just about ready to kill anyone
S0635	well i think slab city clear out in the summer cos it be just too hot to be there and i
S0632	it's too hot
S0635	and i think the caretaker kind of have to be there but
S0632	and go mad
S0635	yeah it's pretty rough
S0632	yeah it's too no you can't live in a caravan in the desert
S0635	uhu yeah
S0632	in midsummer and
S0635	we get out and take some photos of niland as well just cos it be so
S0632	it be so
S0635	run down like
S0632	so empty and run down
S0635	yeah
S0632	oh yeah and then be that the night we drive to palm spring
S0635	yeah cos that be where we stay yeah so
S0632	oh
S0635	after that we yeah
S0632	that be a bite of a relief
S0635	so we go back to palm spring still really hot but
S0632	oh yeah
S0635	we have a pool
S0632	well they have mechanisms for cop with it like every every
S0635	yeah
S0632	business have an awning that jet out
S0635	uhu
S0632	cold mist of watery air
S0635	yeah
S0632	like
S0635	yeah and
S0632	and
S0635	it be like er we do the mystery hotel thing so it be like
S0632	we didn't know where we be gonna stay
S0635	it cos almost nothing to stay there and it be really good yeah
S0632	it be like a motel but like a really nice motel
S0635	yeah
S0632	and our room be literally by the pool
S0635	uhu
S0632	just walk out of our door and into the pool and talk to the other tourists
S0635	yeah
S0632	sit sit out there and cool down
S0635	yeah
S0632	we be right next to the kind of mountain that back it as well
S0635	yeah
S0632	i felt like that's part of the reason it be a bite cooler like especially our hotel cos it be in like
S0635	yeah
S0632	the shade of the mountain half the day
S0635	and there be hummingbirds fly around and
S0632	there be
S0635	big cactuses out the front and they have a sort of gothic font that say royal inn or whatever it as
S0632	royal sun inn
S0635	royal sun inn yeah
S0632	yeah
S0635	and i think we after have a quick break we go out and have tiki bar and a kind of snacky dinner
S0632	we do we we go for their like sharers' platter and
S0635	yeah
S0632	a couple of cocktails at the tiki bar
S0635	uhu
S0632	which be really fun cos we didn't get to
S0635	yeah
S0632	go in san francisco so
S0635	no
S0632	but there be lot of like tiki type place
S0635	uhu
S0632	in palm spring it be
S0635	yeah
S0632	such a party town my impression of it be definitely like party town for the retire
S0635	i'd love to go back it be
S0635	like it be so good so good
S0632	oh it be mental and so yeah i would like freshen up go out have tiki drink come home again and then the next day it be so hot but need to go and get breakfast and as per usual and as per our generation we have to google where the best place for breakfast be
S0635	uhu
S0632	so we go to
S0635	pinocchio's
S0632	pinocchio's which be so camp and they have bottomless champagne for breakfast for three dollars ninety be it
S0635	something like that yeah
S0632	something obscene bottomless champagne for less than four dollars and i know that we be go into the desert that day so i shouldn't really drink but i also be like i'm on honeymoon and there's bottomless champagne

S0632	everyone
S0635	everyone
S0632	yeah
S0635	in there be do it

S0635	yeah the supermarket be one of the best things about that place
S0632	the i
S0635	like it be a proper like local farmers

S0632	and catch our breath a bite
S0635	uhu
S0632	but we do do something every day
S0635	oh yeah
S0632	i think that day we have a lie in and then we just go to the ghost town and then we come back

S0635	yeah
S0632	and i start to write again but i didn't i didn't that be the last time i write and i just stop
S0635	right
S0632	write after that
S0635	uhu yeah that be good and then and then we go and i guess we have to leave time each day cos at this point we weren't really plan like we hadn't book anything so we have to kind of plan our next
S0632	yeah we'd have to
S0635	route every day
S0632	use the time in the day to find out
S0635	uhu
S0632	where we be go to stay next
S0635	yeah yeah
S0632	so
S0635	so then from there we go up through the trail of a hundred giants didn't we that's er
S0632	we do yeah
S0635	which be great
S0632	yeah
S0635	i really like that
S0632	and
S0635	yeah
S0632	we be right back into the forest and the mountains again and it
S0635	uhu
S0632	get cooler and greener and lusher
S0635	yeah yeah it be really good yeah you just sort of park up and then we walk around and the hundreds giants you'd get inside the giant tree

S0635	walk on them climb on them go through them and they have tunnel cut out of them
S0632	yeah it be so cool
S0635	yeah and there be like nice squirrels and stuff
S0635	i think we saw quite a big one
S0632	yeah cos they've get unusual type there haven't they
S0635	uhu
S0632	but yeah cos they've get unusual type there
S0635	uhu
S0632	but yeah that that be the next few days drive up through erm kings canyon and sequoia wasn't it
S0635	yes yeah
S0632	but where do we stay
S0635	so we go pretty much out of the whole area to that night we stay in not fresno that be the other one but it be somewhere else it's
S0632	yeah i feel like it be a v place but
S0635	let let me look on the map
S0632	we didn't really get up to much that be just a place to put our head down wasn't it
S0635	i think that's right
S0632	yeah so we have a couple of days
S0635	mm
S0632	kind of loop in and out of the national park
S0635	mm
S0632	so it be like we stay in a silly motel eat some pizza and then drive back into the national park up up a bite more and then
S0635	yeah
S0632	back out to fresno
S0635	visalia
S0632	visalia
S0635	yeah
S0632	yeah they be those two nights be like probably like the crummiest weren't they
S0635	yeah
S0632	cos we just book lucky dip erm motels and we weren't as lucky as we be in palm spring
S0635	yeah
S0632	i think especially the one in fresno be
S0635	mm
S0632	particularly a dive
S0635	yeah i can't remember much about visalia to be honest
S0632	no there wasn't much to remember
S0635	until
S0632	one of them be fresno the one that we go to the erm er the steakhouse that be posh accidentally
S0635	yes we have the very expensive
S0632	cos that probably the worst place we stay in
S0635	yeah
S0632	but the poshest place we eat in
S0635	yes yeah
S0632	but we like very quickly walk into like quite a posh little redevelop part of town
S0635	yeah it be a steak place that be suppose to be really nice and but we have sort of our hike shoe still on and i
S0632	i think that be the day we we'd swim in the swim hole
S0635	yeah
S0632	as well so i wasn't clean from a shower i'd just be wet from
S0635	yeah
S0632	some wild swim
S0635	that be the day after so i think we do general sherman that day
S0632	oh yeah yeah
S0635	and then like just lot of drive up through the mountains and
S0632	lot of really scenic drive and then
S0635	mm
S0632	when we saw all those cars pull
S0635	uhu
S0632	over and people look down the hill we have to know what they be look at
S0635	yeah
S0632	and it be a swim hole and we
S0635	that be very cool
S0632	have the spontaneous swim and
S0635	yeah and
S0632	it be so lovely
S0635	people blast music out of portable speakers and stuff
S0632	yeah
S0635	yeah
S0632	yeah it felt quite teenage
S0635	yeah it be really good though
S0632	but it be really fun just to do that and then
S0635	mm
S0632	er we be starve when we get to fresno and i want to
S0635	yeah
S0632	eat somewhere nice and and i be like oh it's very posh but we tell them we be on our honeymoon
S0635	yeah
S0632	and they give us a free box of chocolates and it be quite nice to be treat nicely i just wish i'd know it be go to be that posh then i would have
S0635	yeah
S0632	freshen up before we leave our hotel room but yeah that be the worst hotel room and the
S0635	yeah
S0632	nicest restaurant
S0635	i think
S0632	all in the same stay
S0635	it be or visalia i can't remember that we stay in but i think we have i think we go to that place that be kind of like a subway pizza
S0632	yeah i remember that
S0635	yeah i'd sort of forget about it and we yeah we must have just watch stupid tv
S0632	yeah
S0635	they have a pool but i don't know if we use it or not
S0632	no i no we didn't i don't
S0635	no
S0632	i don't think we really pay much attention cos
S0635	no
S0632	it wasn't very interest
S0635	yeah we get get in and get out
S0632	yeah
S0635	yeah
S0632	it be just somewhere to sleep and
S0635	yeah
S0632	we eat and we sleep and then we get back
S0635	uhu
S0632	into the national park because there weren't many place to stay
S0635	yeah
S0632	on the way up because i think
S0635	yeah
S0632	camp in a national park be
S0635	mm
S0632	pretty exclusive and we be lucky
S0635	yeah
S0632	to get that place in yosemite that we do get
S0635	yeah
S0632	otherwise we'd have have to drive back out of yosemite and go some little town on the outskirts
S0635	yeah
S0632	of the park
S0635	yeah there be some cool look camp spot but they just book up so fast
S0632	they just yeah we just couldn't get them
S0635	which would have be cool but and i manage to smash my phone jump on a rock
S0632	oh yeah that be really annoy
S0635	i smash the screen it be but then
S0632	you get
S0635	luckily i manage to fix it like the morning after in the mall
S0632	yeah i suppose at least that be one of the upsides to go out of a national park be that you could get that sort of thing sort at the mall
S0635	yeah and they do fix it reasonably fast and we erm we do we do a bite of shop for our families didn't we we get it out of the way
S0632	i guess so
S0635	i think i remember you get your mum some stuff
S0632	oh yeah i think i do yeah
S0635	and my brother er but then we get the hell out of there and drive right through yosemite
S0632	yeah which be amaze
S0635	yeah
S0632	but it give me nightmares
S0635	yeah it be pretty but be that and we saw that photographer photograph a deer right up close and
S0632	yeah from like a yard away
S0635	you saw that rare kind of mountain goat ram thing
S0632	oh yeah i do see that really weird sheep thing
S0635	which i didn't see mm
S0632	with big spiral horn
S0635	yeah
S0632	and yeah i saw load as yeah as soon as we get into yosemite it be like a disney movie and all the animals come out
S0635	and we saw the bear
S0632	and we saw the bear
S0635	yeah we saw lot of people pull up by the road and
S0632	again we have to go what be they look at
S0635	yeah
S0632	the we're gonna look at it too
S0635	pull up next to the
S0635	yeah sort of ask what people be look at and yeah that's a bear so we
S0632	it go that way
S0635	run round and saw him slink off into the woods
S0632	it be awesome
S0635	uhu
S0632	and that be still relatively low down compare to how high up we get
S0635	yeah
S0632	because that be why it be give me nightmares be because when we finally find again it be another hard one to find cos it be a national park
S0635	yeah
S0632	but when we eventually find our kind of camp it be like a little it be like a little tent cabin wasn't it
S0635	oh it be
S0632	we didn't need to pitch our own
S0635	yeah interest
S0632	it be really cool and we have to put our stuff in the bear box and
S0635	yeah
S0632	but it be so high up and all the roads lead up there they didn't really have safety barriers
S0635	no no
S0632	and i didn't realise how much it affect me until that night and i don't know if it be cos we be sleep at such a high altitude
S0635	yeah
S0632	but my all my dream that night be about drive off a cliff
S0635	and some guy sort of be knock on someone's door be like
S0632	oh yeah
S0635	have you see like someone or other and the guy be like no and it be really odd like be er
S0632	yeah it be quite eerie
S0635	either he be confuse or maybe the altitude be get to lot of people
S0632	maybe
S0635	it be kind of strange up there
S0632	it be
S0635	yeah
S0632	well we be sleep at like eight thousand feet
S0635	yeah
S0632	and then we go up another couple of thousand to walk around or something
S0635	yeah we have breakfast with like a nice family of cool
S0632	oh yeah we have to
S0635	media people i'm not really sure who they be but they be
S0632	cos yeah we have to get seat with you it be the system wasn't it you get
S0635	yeah
S0632	seat with whoever you be seat with but we make conversation with them and
S0635	yeah it be a good breakfast
S0632	it be a nice breakfast very nice and basic
S0635	uhu
S0632	you get what you get there wasn't a frilly menu
S0635	no
S0632	it be like do you want porridge or do you want bacon and egg
S0635	yeah
S0632	and erm yeah so we talk to them for a bite and
S0635	yeah
S0632	we
S0635	and then we have head up er
S0632	we we
S0635	we do like a short one didn't we it be something er i guess tuolumne tuolumne meadows wasn't it be where we be stay
S0632	yeah
S0635	erm and then the er yeah tuolumne meadows and there be like a sort of spring wasn't there like a natural spring water thing
S0632	yeah well we do
S0635	but it be kind of gross
S0632	we do that we do that walk around the side of that lake first didn't we
S0635	oh yeah that be that be nice
S0632	that be really nice
S0635	mm
S0632	and then we drive to the the place with the natural carbon spring
S0635	yeah
S0632	erm and yeah it be just really scenic and then we walk down by the river and sit down for a bite
S0635	mm
S0632	but i always describe it as it be a really there be really short easy walk and i think we take them slow i know we'd take them slow but while by the time we get back in the car it be like three or four hours have pass or something and i be like what like we just kind of wander around a bite and then sit down for a bite and walk back to the car and i think it must have be all to do with the altitude
S0635	yeah
S0632	it's like we be in slow motion or something like we're just like walk for a few minutes sit down walk for a few more minutes sit down like we really take it easy we
S0635	yeah
S0632	didn't go very far
S0635	no
S0632	and it take us most of the day
S0635	yeah
S0635	i felt really heavy like i be i dunno yeah

S0635	yeah we sort of land in newark and er get a nice pilot sort of give us a little speech and thank us and say explain what have happen

S0632	so i know you still need to be really careful around bear but i'd imagine the
S0635	mm
S0632	first and last bear
