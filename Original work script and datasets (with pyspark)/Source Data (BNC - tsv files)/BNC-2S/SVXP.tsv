S0454	okay this be record now mm so the food bank this be really good by the way
S0453	okay
S0454	especially the chip
S0453	mm
S0454	they're better than last time
S0453	what you mean the rest isn't that isn't that good
S0454	no i'm just say the chip be better than last time
S0453	mm
S0454	no so this article on food bank i be read
S0453	mm
S0454	it be say there's now a thousand food bank across the uk which be huge
S0453	yeah so i mean who do they fee be it
S0454	yeah the i mean
S0453	just kind of i mean whoever just turn up
S0454	yeah
S0453	or be it mean test i mean
S0454	i don't know i don't think it be so i guess that's part of the problem with assess like if people really need them like if you're a student
S0453	what's to stop yeah
S0454	what's to stop you just go there and get free food
S0453	or a or a banker
S0454	or a banker exactly and these like erm pay what you feel cafés
S0453	mm
S0454	there's two of them in london now one of them's in a really poor area so there probably be poor people go there
S0453	mm
S0454	but the other one be in a really like posh area where they're apparently it's fill with bankers and then you think like what's the point of that i mean maybe the they say most people there be very generous in what they pay they pay over five pound for a very simple meal
S0453	ah so you're still pay it's not free
S0454	pay as you feel no i'm talk about the pay as you feel cafés now
S0453	mm
S0454	but you know they're very generous but the point be how do we know that these like food bank and food cafés be serve who they're suppose to
S0453	well i think the principle of a food bank be a good one because if you think about how much food wastage there be out there
S0454	yes
S0453	from your average café like costa at the end of the shift they throw away all the muffins and stuff if they're if they're due to expire the next day cos they simply can't display them even though they're still alright for a few days
S0454	mm mm yeah but
S0453	and they throw them away
S0454	but the problem be that food bank aren't stock with leftover food it's like you or me go to the supermarket now and spend say twenty pound
S0453	mm mm
S0454	and then give that food we've just buy to a food bank
S0453	mm
S0454	so they're not really be use in that way the other one that erm the food what be we say before about the pay what you feel cafes that's different those two in london only use erm food that's about to expire or food that have be donate by businesses
S0453	oh okay
S0454	so that seem to be a better use
S0453	what part what part of london be that in that pay as you feel café
S0454	i don't know i'll have to look it up
S0453	mm
S0454	yeah i remember read about it last week cos when we be in australia we saw that pay as you feel concept much more widely use but it's
S0453	do you
S0454	yeah like they have erm at the convent they have pay as you feel yoga
S0453	mm okay
S0454	erm pay as you feel obviously food and i saw a stand on the high street in melbourne say pay as you feel balloon and like face paint
S0453	that's nice
S0454	but that concept in the uk seem to be brand new
S0453	yeah
S0454	erm obviously it's all start by volunteer
S0453	mm
S0454	like in australia and uk but which i mean you could say it's kind of exploit people as well i mean these be still businesses
S0453	mm
S0454	but i suppose if the money's go to a good place then you know who care they're not do it for profit but you'd think they could pay people minimum wage
S0453	from where
S0454	well people if people be pay as you feel and for example they've get maybe it's quite a good business model one in a sort of posh area of london where bankers go and they're pay actually over the odds because the food be free you have to remember
S0453	yeah
S0454	so there's no overheads for the food and they're not pay any staff fee so if they're pay five pound for that meal that's actual pure profit unlike a real restaurant where they'd be spend out huge amount you know probably the biggest expense be wag and then the food itself so that could actually be subsidise the other café where people can't afford to pay as much
S0453	true but don't they have to rent premise to do this
S0454	mm yeah
S0453	so i mean that's massive
S0454	so they do have that overhead
S0453	yeah that's a massive expense
S0454	plus the electricity and water
S0453	mm and there's no guarantee level of income here you know they're just
S0454	mm true but these have be go for years in australia like the one at the convent in melbourne
S0453	mm that's a convent though
S0454	no no but it's like erm it shut down as a convent
S0453	mm
S0454	and the council be go to sell it off privately for erm flats
S0453	development
S0454	development but the local community cos they love the convent decide to buy it they buy it between them they raise money themselves
S0453	mm right
S0454	and they put in a business plan to the county council say we want this to be develop as artist residence you know not as in they live there as in they work there erm and also these kind of community cafés and so they put in this really great business plan and they find backers you know charities who would come in it's really over subscribe for the artist residence and it's be hugely successful i mean it's a tourist thing now people go there to visit and they do like load of course but they do make money because those artists in residence be allow to sell their work and they have erm like natural health clinics and you actually pay quite a a lot of money to go to them
S0453	okay mm
S0454	so it's it's not just you know sort of tick over some some of those be actually make money
S0453	well that's nice
S0454	mm
S0453	that's good i mean but i'm assume that these ones in london aren't there yet
S0454	no i mean it still seem to be very new concept
S0453	early days
S0454	and i wonder if i mean i suppose if they're register charities then they wouldn't pay business tax would they
S0453	yeah they'd have all those charity charitable exemptions
S0454	yeah and you'd think the same for food bank but yeah go back to the food bank
S0453	mm
S0454	i i just don't know like how meaningful it be to say there's a thousand food bank you know that if people be exploit them for free food when they're not actually poor or not in the sense of poverty i mean like students don't really need to use it
S0453	yeah i mean even even you know people that live in that area it's actually quite handy it's almost like your think about your charitable kind of clothe bank
S0454	mm
S0453	where you and and shoe bank where you sort of donate clothe and shoe
S0454	mm
S0453	it's kind of in the same bracket isn't it only with food
S0454	yeah it be
S0453	so if you live in that area you're probably more likely to give because to be honest you're about to go on holiday there's a there's a bunch of stuff that's go to go off unless you you know donate to this bank
S0454	true
S0453	and someone can make use of it but er
S0454	yeah but what they say in this guardian article be that the people who use it erm be often people who have mental health problems and maybe can't work
S0453	mm
S0454	erm you know aren't capable of go to work erm drug addict obviously cos you know they're not earn er homeless people but they also say there be an alarm rise of people who be actually work obviously the unemployed but people who be work full time
S0453	mm
S0454	but in minimum wage job and they be use food bank and that be worry
S0453	mm yeah
S0454	but again we don't know whether they're just try to save money they've just you know sort of oh free food
S0453	yeah
S0454	that'll save me fifty quid a week
S0453	mm
S0454	and they're just use it for that rather than actual poverty
S0453	yeah erm
S0454	i dunno what do you think
S0453	i think the idea be a good one erm although i think we're say that this whole how do this interact with the welfare state and be this like a cop out for the welfare state with the cut and everything
S0454	mm mm mm
S0453	i mean the counter argument to that be you've get a lot of people rid that welfare state that that
S0454	yeah
S0453	have zero incentive to get out of it
S0454	mm true
S0453	and and er and and and there must be a way of of of reduce that reduce that the that parasitic lifestyle
S0454	so in some ways you're say like the recent cut in welfare and like the sanction if you don't comply with the rule might just this rise in food bank might just be a a kind of reaction to that and if we leave it another year or two we might see reliance go down as people start to find work and you know
S0453	yeah
S0454	start to rely on themselves rather than constantly rely on handouts either from the government or for from like well mean people in the community
S0453	it's possible but i think you'll always get people that will be will want to lead that lifestyle
S0454	yeah and the homelessness and drug addiction that's not go anywhere
S0453	no
S0454	erm it's not go to to be honest be it you can't stop people
S0453	no erm
S0454	so there'll always be people who need free food
S0453	yeah i think the the issue that london face as well be be this whole you know the abundance of wealthy russian chinese arab
S0454	mm
S0453	erm investors in real estate
S0454	mm
S0453	that just leave their properties empty
S0454	yeah
S0453	so
S0454	people be force out
S0453	yeah so buyers for buyers be force out you know buyers that erm be don't have that level of wealth
S0454	even renters
S0453	but even renters cos it basically stop the rental market it it it stop property from it remove property for the rental market
S0454	yeah and that have a knock on effect because then people have to commute further and as we know like commute in london be so expensive that that will eat up a huge an increasingly large chunk of their wag whereas before those people might have live in zone one and zone two
S0453	mm
S0454	basically no one can afford to unless they're über rich now
S0453	absolutely
S0454	and even then they can't buy you know they're so
S0453	mm
S0454	if the russian oligarchs be come in and buy that mean even rich british people you know there's not very many of them so even they're force to to buy further out in the suburbs
S0453	yeah
S0454	and that force up price
S0453	absolutely yeah that's that's that's a big issue erm i don't know what the way round it be although whether you restrict foreign ownership i mean that's what the gulf do
S0454	mm
S0453	in the gulf you can't
S0454	yeah that's true
S0453	you
S0454	just erm just have certain areas where they can buy
S0453	mm
S0454	which be earmark and not in like obviously really desirable central locations they have to buy further out in new developments
S0453	although the problem with that be the desirable and really central locations the properties be so expensive that they tend to be outside your average erm
S0454	mm
S0453	you know british buyers' budget
S0454	mm but that's inflation
S0453	so true but i can't see it's not go to drop dramatically if they introduce this kind of restriction it'll take time in london it's almost
S0454	well yeah because when they sell we can't stop people who've already buy right so
S0453	mm
S0454	they're go to hold on to it and when they sell yeah that's when there's be a drop but that could be twenty years away i mean these people be use them as like piggy bank basically they say don't they
S0453	the other difference be you know the gulf state generally don't allow you to hold another passport
S0454	mm
S0453	so there's a clear way mechanism of erm distinguish between foreigners and locals
S0454	true
S0453	whereas in the uk there isn't that restriction so
S0454	mm
S0453	you could be russian an oligarch you could have live in the uk for ten years and you can qualify for a for citizenship
S0454	true
S0453	particularly when you're talk about the investor type that tend to qualify for these things quicker because they're bring their money into the country
S0454	mm
S0453	so it's a complex one
S0454	mm
S0453	erm but it's
S0454	housing's a huge issue
S0453	you know yeah it be and everyone keep bang out bang on you know ukip about erm immigration and sort of erm the the the immigrants that come in economic migrants erm but actually you know whilst i think it's important there be constraints on how many people can come in i think that's important but
S0454	mm
S0453	at the end of the day these people do the job the sort of job that your average brit be not simply not go to do
S0454	yeah but these like polish and romanian workers they're not the ones buy our property in the centre of london
S0453	no exactly so there's two different issue you know everyone keep bang on about the economies migrants but what about the wealthy migrants
S0454	mm they're the bigger issue with house
S0453	i think so mm
S0454	and then the effect that have on people's take home pay as they be force to pay more for rent and live further away
S0453	mm
S0454	to lose more time commute and
S0453	mm
S0454	yeah for sure but no one seem to be talk about that with this election campaign like
S0453	no no one want to piss off
S0454	they're talk about food bank and welfare but no one ever go near house like especially the second home issue or the foreign buy
S0453	mm it's cos yeah it's cos the i mean it's landlords be glad that there be this inflation and high rent
S0454	mm yeah
S0453	and er and property owners in general
S0454	mm
S0453	erm and they're probably quite a quite an influential lobby so
S0454	yes that's true and of course it's richer people who be in that position and they're the ones who be probably in power so you know mps nothing to stop them own like ten properties be there
S0453	no exactly and we saw that problem horizon the other day about the the increase in er in sort of private landlords that be refer to by councils cos they've get a dearth of council house
S0454	yeah
S0453	and they still need to house people
S0454	yeah that be outrageous
S0453	the the ruthlessness that they have for the money
S0454	and they what they be charge for like a you know a caravan literally caravan like ten thousand a week you know that guy be make
S0453	and the really poor hygiene sanitary condition
S0454	but i mean that seem to be a problem about law enforcement if something be substandard
S0453	yeah
S0454	we already have laws in place to to close hotels down for example
S0453	mm
S0454	erm look to me more like environmental health or whoever it be that deal with enforcement be hugely overstretch and they they need a lot more because i mean imagine you know it's not enough just to go and inspect right let's say you go and you inspect
S0453	yeah mm
S0454	and you find it's substandard well you wouldn't take someone to court immediately you would then have to write a report
S0453	mm
S0454	and give that landlord the chance to put it right which be go to take let's say you know six weeks two months i don't know
S0453	mm
S0454	and agree a time frame and then you'd have to go back and inspect a second time and it's not up to scratch you'd probably still give them a third chance right so now six months will go by and only then would you start to think right we need to take this guy to court
S0453	fine this guy yeah
S0454	and that would take hours and hours to prepare for you know cos they're not legal experts these environmental health people they would then have to refer that to their lawyers who be i'm sure be really overwork too
S0453	yeah i mean there's a few issue there one be the cut to the environmental health inspectors themselves and
S0454	yeah that's worry
S0453	and the fact they haven't get the man power to do this give the number of properties out there the increase in the number of people rely on this kind of you know these kinds of erm hotels and hostels
S0454	mm mm
S0453	but secondly but i mean it's also the police cos we saw that they get involve
S0454	yeah
S0453	but there have be police cut as well
S0454	that's right
S0453	so they're probably now prioritise murder you know the big sort of stuff
S0454	and even when they do erm prosecute and succeed you saw the fin they be tiny like erm that guy who have that house condemn
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	he only get fin er he get fin five thousand pound
S0453	five thousand pound yeah
S0454	but he's be rake in ten thousand pound a month so
S0453	no i think it be more than that like he be make like eight hundred thousand pound year
S0454	it be a week or something a year so five thousand pound
S0453	be no skin off his nose
S0454	be a be a slap on the wrist he might as well keep on do it
S0453	yeah
S0454	so there seem to be a bigger problem there that we've get laws but the fin be be not in proportion to what these people be earn and they need to be
S0453	yeah absolutely so there's that issue but then there's the broader strategic issue as we be say of how tough can you be with the people that potentially finance your election campaign
S0454	true and not only that if you're go to be really tough with them be there an alternative on the market and it look like the house stock be so dire in a lot of place that there really isn't anywhere alternative to home these people which they're oblige to no thank
S0453	mm
S0454	so they're leave with kind of no choice but to to not be too harsh on these landlords because what can they do
S0453	yeah
S0454	erm yeah it's a tricky one and i guess you see a lot of landlords wouldn't want these people in their home they're not go to rent out you know a really nice two bed flat to people who be you know be be take this erm you know free house because presumably they're unemployed and have problems so you're not go to want to rent out anywhere nice so it kind of almost encourage the the rogue landlords to let out somewhere substandard because they be go to get you know probably wreck
S0453	mm
S0454	right you're go to have and also you're not go to the neighbour aren't go to want these social this social house on their doorstep because it's go to bring down the value of their property and it's true unfortunately
S0453	it's go to bring along the riff raff
S0454	yeah
S0453	so what do you think about the election and you know the election issue and come up on thursday
S0454	yeah i think the tories will win
S0453	yeah i agree
S0454	labour will do well though better than last time
S0453	you reckon
S0454	it's further cos a lot of people who use to vote labour go right off them with the whole iraq war right i mean i always use to vote labour or green but once tony blair and you know blatantly lie and we all know that even before you know the those document come out prove that you know there be no proof of these weapons of mass destruction like we all know that it be about oil and the fact that he be pretend it be something else really just turn a lot of voters off him i mean we think we might as well vote for the tories then because you're no better before they have the moral high grind
S0453	yeah
S0454	so i think they'll have gain some grind because that's long enough ago that people have maybe sort of forget it
S0453	mm
S0454	but i still think the tories will come out because of the economy
S0453	yeah but ed miliband be a joker though
S0454	that's the other thing he's not very
S0453	he's get zero charisma
S0454	yeah and you need charisma
S0453	mm
S0454	like
S0453	he look a bite of an idiot
S0454	he look a bite sort of wet behind the ears doesn't he
S0453	yeah he look like a sixth former who's find suddenly find himself at the top of the of a political party
S0454	yeah and then that idiotic interview with russell brand you know when he be try be really cool and
S0453	and say get
S0454	gotta gotta go this and we gotta do that in that plummy accent
S0453	he do he be sort of like oh you know like let me just explain you gotta do this and then you gotta do that and it just do it be completely incongruous it didn't
S0454	it didn't work and it just look like he be desperate for vote and oh look i'm go to go and find a celebrity now and do an interview
S0453	mm
S0454	and you also think like what's russell brand do be he try to endorse the labour party like he's suppose to be independent of this
S0453	russell brand be russell brand be just a narcissistic erm essex boy i mean that's what he be he just go on
S0454	yes
S0453	you know he's like oh d'you know what i mean like
S0454	and probably go to a private school himself
S0453	yeah
S0454	and it put on his accent to a large extent yeah i agree but i mean if he if he's suppose to be this anti establishment figure then he shouldn't be court just one party i mean you might as well talk to all of them and if he's try to do good then try and push his cause across and ask them what be you do about homelessness what be you do about immigration and you know back them in to a corner
S0453	mm so let's look back on this coalition government over the last four years
S0454	mm
S0453	four or five
S0454	i don't know four
S0453	yeah and just say what's go well and what hasn't
S0454	economy
S0453	economy have go well
S0454	because we be in a recession right this time five years ago
S0453	yeah it's recover well
S0454	but i mean of course it wasn't just the uk that be in a recession then it be basically all of europe all of the world even australia so
S0453	mm yeah
S0454	to some extent you could say that do the tories really do that i mean they could have it could have just naturally get better
S0453	happen anyway yeah
S0454	couldn't it
S0453	could have yeah could have but but erm i think some some of the policies might have help stimulate economic activity so for example
S0454	mm
S0453	erm you know what they do with the sdlt stamp city land tax before i think it be just a
S0454	flat rate
S0453	a flat rate
S0454	mm
S0453	and then they make it a threshold so it be you know three percent if it's above a certain value
S0454	yeah
S0453	and then and then above really a much higher value than it become subject to a higher rate
S0454	that's good yes no that be good and it it be fairer on the first time buyers and people at the bottom of the ladder that they weren't pay nearly as much it give them a chance but i think it be a lot more than that they have to make cut basically big cut er because it wasn't sustainable what labour be do plough enormous amount of money into education but there be no improvement in result
S0453	mm
S0454	so it be kind of throw money at the wall and you know like for example when i teach in the secondary school they have all these laptops that they bring in erm and we never use them because someone decide some health and safety committee after they be buy that it wasn't safe to have all these lead trail everywhere so we basically weren't allow to use them so school be spend out huge amount of money on technology that they then didn't use
S0453	mm mm
S0454	and they shouldn't be allow to do that i mean the the money have get you know some money have to be put towards technology but ultimately technology become out of date so quickly
S0453	mm yeah
S0454	and the cost of maintain equipment be so huge and school don't have often you know some sort of technical support officer who be capable of fix say laptops that they become useless very quickly so what be introduce need to be think through very carefully
S0453	mm mm
S0454	and the money instead should be spend on facilities like the build themselves bring in the right number of teachers er so it wasn't sustainable what they be do and they've cut you know and they've have to cut the education budget quite harshly so that be one way they save money but some of the other cut like erm you okay to keep go
S0453	yeah
S0454	erm some of the other cut like in the police force and in jail i completely disagree with
S0453	mm
S0454	like i mean that's i don't think the jail be ever extravagant anyway they be never overstaffed
S0453	no they be overcrowd
S0454	they be overcrowd we desperately need new jail and they've still not be build and the same with the police force crime be fall i mean so they say but crime be also be monitor less if you've get less policemen so
S0453	yeah for sure so so erm
S0454	it's kind of a meaningless statistic if you cut the number of police officer and then say oh we've get less crime
S0453	mm
S0454	have we or have we just get more evasion of crime
S0453	mm true
S0454	like illegal immigrants they haven't get a hope
S0453	true erm the other thing be they've introduce this help to buy scheme
S0454	mm
S0453	which be intend to provide a springboard for first time buyers and lower income
S0454	but it's crap
S0453	people i think it be crap because the problem be that people don't read the fine print and they just think that this
S0454	yeah
S0453	oh help to buy great the government be go to help us out
S0454	yeah
S0453	and lend us erm i think it's eighty percent
S0454	yeah it's huge
S0453	eighty percent of the property value
S0454	i think it's something like that
S0453	when you read the fine print though you find that the repayment term be subject to minimum repayment amount of ten thousand pound your average joe bloggs doesn't have that money that easily
S0454	mm
S0453	second thing be that it's not like a conventional mortgage where you pay interest on the amount borrow you you pay back so they've lend you eighty percent you pay back eighty percent of the value of your property when you come to pay it back so it need to be value and in these in these time of high inflation and high property price and property price increase naturally the government be go to make a kill
S0454	yeah make a yeah that's true
S0453	out of that erm and and and it might be on less favourable term to these people than they they would get from a commercial mortgage
S0454	yeah because some of the bank now be offer brilliant mortgage fix rate mortgage like coop's offer
S0453	low interest rate
S0454	yeah one percent interest which be phenomenal it's really great
S0453	mm
S0454	so you think it's not really worth it i mean you've get to scrape your deposit together still but i guess that's the main problem first time buyers have be where where be that money come from
S0453	mm mm yeah
S0454	and i mean no bank's go to accept less than twenty percent
S0453	these days no
S0454	so i mean because property price be so high it's substantial
S0453	what else have go well i mean there cos there's a few other things there there be more new house be build
S0454	yeah that's positive
S0453	now be that be that a policy or be that just you know respond to demand
S0454	no it's a policy but like because there's be a policy of not build i suppose more to the point
S0453	true
S0454	for you know probably since we be bear
S0453	yeah
S0454	since thatcher's time
S0453	yeah
S0454	and well i mean that's not be sustainable either cos what we've get now be the situation where the house stock doesn't match the demographics of families any more before people have you know three four children
S0453	mm
S0454	and so they need a house er two up two down
S0453	yeah now it's more apartments
S0454	now yeah we need apartments people be marry later and they're you know
S0453	if at all
S0454	if at all and when they do have children it's one or two
S0453	mm
S0454	so what we need be flats basically and unless you live in a big city
S0453	mm
S0454	it's pretty hard to find flats especially new build what you get be you know convert terrace and they're not design for it the bathrooms aren't there for example so you you get these share entrance ways it's not ideal at all and what we really need be erm purpose build flats new build
S0453	yeah
S0454	and also i i suppose with erm you know a lot of factories move abroad
S0453	mm
S0454	in the past that those areas be very you know neglect
S0453	mm
S0454	but be in good locations often quite central like liverpool and birmingham have get you know these derelict areas but you know actually quite prime real estate and all of that need to be redevelop into flats and then you know birmingham's do a good job actually i be there a couple of years ago and they've really develop erm these old factory areas into shop centre and it look pretty good
S0453	in term of urban regeneration
S0454	yeah
S0453	so i mean other pluses and minuses you've get you've have the child sex abuse case that have come out
S0454	yeah i mean
S0453	jimmy saville rolf harris it's it's good that those have be pursue i suppose
S0454	but then it's all seem like that's go on for so long that both labour and the tories
S0453	have turn a blind eye
S0454	be yeah exactly turn a blind eye that go on definitely when the tories be in power before and they know about it
S0453	yeah
S0454	and someone know about it and didn't do anything about it
S0453	yes and
S0454	and then the mps themselves be involve
S0453	well yeah this be the thing that i have a major problem with but also come back to the jimmy saville and rolf harris have you notice that in the last week there's be some additional stories about them
S0454	mm
S0453	that have come out and i'm think you know i don't think it's a coincidence that in the lead up to the election the these stories be come out
S0454	that's true yeah
S0453	as in look you know look what we're do the tories to this or the tory coalition government to pursue these guy
S0454	mm
S0453	when actually the tories have be grossly negligent with with with child sex abuse use with er their own government the institutional abuse that happen in that hostel i can't remember the name with high level mps involve a lot of whom be dead but under margret thatcher's government
S0454	mm true
S0453	and i don't think like you say it's it's erm coincidental that they're those aren't be pursue at the moment and i guess they're still investigate cos of the sheer scale of this thing but i think you're right that no decision will be make until the new government come in and they decide what they want to do but i just hope that if it be the tories that get elect as we're expect
S0454	mm mm
S0453	erm that they that they pursue this issue because i think the public will be expect it
S0454	mm
S0453	and and the media in the uk you know they're quite ruthless they won't let this this let this go
S0454	yeah
S0453	and it will it'll be a matter of time before someone start say why be nothing be do about this
S0454	yeah true
S0453	and it may be that you know some of the perpetrators be dead erm but others aren't and some be already inside doesn't matter they they get additional charge
S0454	yeah
S0453	erm they should someone need to pay for what happen
S0454	and what do you think about this rule erm now in prisons that before if you be a erm child sex offender a convict offender your detail be not release to other prisoners like what you be in for be keep confidential
S0453	mm mm
S0454	for the simple reason that
S0453	you'd get your your head kick in
S0454	i mean you you might get kill yeah or certainly you'd be treat worse than other prisoners a
S0453	oh for sure
S0454	and that's apparently all stop under the tories and now they're you know release what people have do
S0453	mm
S0454	that to me be wrong like
S0453	yeah i agree
S0454	if the state say that you know you're you you know you do this you you be guilty of this and this be your punishment let's say ten years in prison then we don't have the right to impose or turn a blind eye to further abuse in the prison system because the prison itself be suppose to be punishment so
S0453	yeah
S0454	to me that's really wrong it's ethically questionable i don't i'm not make excuse for these people
S0453	i yeah
S0454	but i'm just say the the sentence be already pass down by the court
S0453	yeah they be they be sentence to incarceration not incarceration and abuse
S0454	exactly yeah
S0453	but yeah i absolutely agree with you but this probably happen anyway because the prison officer know what they're in for
S0454	yeah of course they do
S0453	and they get all chummy with certain prisoners and they tell someone and word get round
S0454	but that would be but the point be in the past they could have be sack for that or even take to court themselves over that for you know breach of confidential information but now they wouldn't be do anything wrong everybody know it's suppose to be all open
S0453	true as lawyers though when we look at confidentiality obligations they're very difficult to enforce
S0454	mm
S0453	because it's very hard to isolate the source of the disclosure erm as as the person that should have disclose it i mean it's hard to to tell
S0454	yeah that's true
S0453	that guy say i but i didn't you know the prison officer might say i i didn't tell anyone it must have be the prisoners themselves they ask him
S0454	true
S0453	and it's his word against the prisoners and guess who's gonna be believe generally before the court it'll be
S0454	true
S0453	the prison
S0454	but the point be there be a bite of an incentive and also just morally you know they might not have do that
S0453	yeah
S0454	but now it's all open
S0453	yeah
S0454	it's very dangerous and apart from the understaffing these other change to me they're just wrong
S0453	right yeah i
S0454	we're look it's prison suicides have go up a lot in the last two years and
S0453	yeah
S0454	i would have think it be a combination of those two things less staff but also more abuse
S0453	yeah absolutely i i but i think you're right that the prison system be be flaw
S0454	mm
S0453	that there need to be need to be another way of do this
S0454	and the other thing cos you know my dad work in erm a prison
S0453	yeah
S0454	that you know you sometimes question whether a lot of people should be in prison i don't mean the child sex offenders or any kind of sex offender they they do need to be there but other people for example burglars where there's no er there be no violence involve do they really need to be there be this the the best use of the prison space we have which we've already accept be very overcrowd
S0453	you know i mean some good ideas have come up like this restaurant that they do in i think it's in brixton i don't know if you
S0454	yeah i saw that
S0453	where they've basically staff it with inmates erm and they make great food and they make money out of it you know they so
S0454	mm
S0453	and that's that's good i think i think application towards a you know a work erm er objective would be good
S0454	yes
S0453	because i mean you know i'm not talk about the chinese labour camp or anything like that
S0454	no
S0453	cos i think they'd still do they still have erm labour camp in china but but i'm think there must be an alternative to slap someone behind bar
S0454	mm
S0453	because the rate at which inmates be go into prison be far higher than the rate of release so
S0454	yes and the reoffending rate be
S0453	be really high
S0454	very very high
S0453	yes so it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that unless we build more prisons this this this whole system be gonna crumble
S0454	yeah
S0453	it's gonna it's gonna everything be go to come to a head
S0454	and also the prisons we've get be very very old now as well and some of them need to be shut down not to mention they be build in a different time where family support be not recognise as be erm a key component of stop reoffending so some of these prisons like dartmoor be build in the most isolate out of the way place on purpose to prevent them have any access with anybody erm and that be a high security prison in the past you know for murderers and rapists who probably weren't go to be release ever and it be think they didn't have any chance of be rehabilitate anyway now what we've get be those same prisons be completely out the way but they don't have it's not a high security prison anymore it's a low security prison so the people in there aren't dangerous they have a greater chance of be rehabilitate but their family be not able to visit
S0453	yeah yeah mm cos it's so far away
S0454	they're almost no public transport you know the it's miles even from the nearest city plymouth er miles and miles and miles and people can be put in dartmoor prison who aren't from devon or cornwall they can be from anywhere in the uk
S0453	yeah yeah absolutely yeah
S0454	and the thing be we all know that poverty be a major factor in why people go to prison so can those families really afford to drive down from let's say manchester to see them and what stay in a hotel nearby there aren't any hotels nearby
S0453	the problem be the problem be you can't you can't just have there isn't room to have prisoners imprison accord to where they live
S0454	well they're suppose to be unless it's like a obviously a very violent prisoner where you can't put them in the local jail because it's not secure enough but
S0453	yeah
S0454	no they be mean to to house you near where you live the problem be they're so overcrowd that they can't
S0453	yeah they be yeah and there be areas that that produce a a tonne more prisoners than others
S0454	right though dartmoor be never go to produce that many prisoners so
S0453	exactly unless you know i don't know you
S0454	it's in a bad location what they need to do be build one say on the road by bristol next to a motorway this be another thing they're think about with the new generation of prison it need to be close to a major artery and public transport so that people can visit
S0453	yeah yeah true i mean in yeah yeah i mean in dartmoor you know the crime erm aspect yeah it it it probably doesn't produce may criminals you know unless you're kill kill
S0454	there's no one there
S0453	and like bury body part on dartmoor which might have happen before
S0454	yeah
S0453	or you're like erm cut erm sort of trim erm national park hedge and make off with like erm protect flower and stuff like that
S0454	mm
S0453	hardly you know hardly a hotbed of crime but london have load of prisoners and it have quite a few prisoners but nowhere near enough to cope cope with the number that be be er that be that be be convict
S0454	yes no yeah
S0453	er so er
S0454	someone need to invest the next government need to invest heavily in
S0453	someone need to invest exactly all of this need
S0454	build new prisons in the right place
S0453	yes absolutely not only build new prisons but also think about strategies and alternatives to this prison system so
S0454	yes yeah this be another problem
S0453	so i don't know you bring in trainers er plumbers i don't know train plumbers that can that can train these guy on
S0454	mm but you could do that in prison be what some people say
S0453	acquire skills
S0454	like that dartmoor prison be actually a train prison and they do they be suppose to receive course in for example carpentry
S0453	learn a craft
S0454	and they do and they're allow to sell what they produce in the prison shop but perhaps that need to be roll out much more widely
S0453	oh for sure
S0454	that instead of have the odd train prison here and there
S0453	it need to be a systematic
S0454	need to be systematic
S0453	i think you're right
S0454	all prisons where you know there's some hope of people be rehabilitate and release need to be say okay these be the course on offer to you and like you say that brixton restaurant thing's be hugely oversubscribed like everyone want to do it because they saw ah there's there be job in this field and it's a cool job to do these right cook it's
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	celebrities
S0453	yeah it be and i so i think we need to focus on what trade we can er trade skills and craft skills we can give these guy because this be go to give some purpose to their otherwise erm you know wander live
S0454	mm yeah
S0453	erm and it's also go to mean that we could generate some good out of out of their erm their incarceration you know have whether it's erm in the the sort of benefit of of er sell on what they produce
S0454	yeah
S0453	or erm or just get them in a frame of mind that be less likely erm to result in them reoffending
S0454	mm
S0453	which i think be
S0454	the other thing i wonder erm be more have more open prisons i think isle of wight which be an open prison so the prisoners be not dangerous so they're allow out in the day
S0453	yeah
S0454	to you know go around the town or whatever but in the even
S0453	that's cos there's bugger all on the isle of wight though
S0454	oh that's true but no there's old people
S0453	yeah
S0454	but in the even you know they have to come back there's a curfew and someone's monitor so it's more like a a safe house i suppose you could say and of course they can do course and things within the prison ground but why not have that why not let them erm do that more and let people earn as well like just because you're in prison do that mean you shouldn't be able to make a live because i think this be a problem when they release prisoners they they be give erm like a rail warrant it's call they're give free transport to whatever city they're from in the uk and about forty pound
S0453	yeah
S0454	but the truth be forty pound these days isn't gonna even get you into a flat so we've get a huge problem here where people be be release with no support and no money behind them
S0453	not enough to get up on their
S0454	and why should the government give it to them for free erm and and then what be they go to do they're go to go out and reoffend because you haven't give them much option unless they've get family will to take them in then what be they go to do they're go to sleep rough they're go to get hungry they're go to commit a crime
S0453	yeah yeah unless they've get family and friends
S0454	yeah okay but this be a problem where you know people in prison don't always have that
S0453	true
S0454	they're and that's one of the reason they've go into it not only be they say from a poor background with little in the way of educational erm qualifications to get them anywhere but then they don't have that support network and someone come out of prison after say five years inside be institutionalise they're not very likely to think oh i'll pop down the job centre and i'll wait a couple of weeks while they sort out my benefit you know it's all wrong
S0453	yeah i mean that's what they're that's what the erm that's what the probation officer and the social workers be suppose to do they're suppose to help them reintegrate into society
S0454	but there aren't enough
S0453	there aren't enough absolutely
S0454	i mean there the there aren't enough half way house the government doesn't provide half way house what they need be shelter accommodation when they come out there's charities do that work but there aren't enough and that to me be criminal that we haven't think through what happen on release
S0453	no true
S0454	and if you're release someone with no money behind them and no support it it's kind of obvious what's go to happen next
S0453	yeah i mean the system need to allow these people to reintegrate into society and if we complain about reoffending rat you know this be certainly go to be a contribute and contributory factor to that
S0454	yeah
S0453	erm but i think we should erm
S0454	people shouldn't be release until it's clear where they're go to stay that night
S0453	yeah the problem be
S0454	that need to happen and that need to be if if they don't have family and friends who be able to say yes i'm take them then the government have to provide hostels for them it's the only way otherwise you might as well just say you know go out and reoffend
S0453	so what you're say be the the new investment need to be not just in refurbish and build new prisons
S0454	yeah
S0453	but also build house
S0454	what we do afterwards not just build house but how there's no point release a prisoner without have a plan for them
S0453	yeah but that plan could be throw away
S0454	it could be but at the moment there be no plan
S0453	no
S0454	for the vast majority of prisoners there's no one support them i mean people be literally release from the gate no one be there to meet them you know you know they need to know where they're go to sleep that night
S0453	but they can they can contact people people can come and visit them while they're in prison they can write to people they can say tell them
S0454	we we're say that people you know these be the lucky ones who have family who be will and able to visit
S0453	or friends
S0454	but as we just say the prisons be all over the shop
S0453	or friends
S0454	so they might but they might not be able to
S0453	that's true
S0454	if they're from manchester and the prisons on dartmoor they're go to get one visit a year probably and that's the truth of it
S0453	yeah this this be true
S0454	not to mention prisoners be move round the country all the time
S0453	they be
S0454	so it's you know
S0453	some of it depend on the level of security that that you know
S0454	it's not just that though it's about overcrowd again so you know there's dartmoor prison be never an issue of security it's always about they're full
S0453	it's about overcrowd it's it's yeah
S0454	or they're not full and this one be near a hospital this let's say you're in dartmoor prison and you develop er a heart problem
S0453	yeah
S0454	now they're not go to keep you in dartmoor prison because they know if some if you have a heart attack in the night you might well die because the nearest hospital be one hour's drive away and you're go to have to get a doctor out from an hour away from plymouth to that prisoner so they're not go to put they're not go to keep that guy there they're now go to move him to anywhere else in the uk which be near a hospital
S0453	near a hospital
S0454	and that's what need to happen and so they shift you know these prisoners around so they shift that one out of let's say nottingham and then they move the one from nottingham down to to dartmoor
S0453	some of it be bad behaviour though or abuse by other prisoners or
S0454	some of it's bad behaviour they get they get violent and then they have to be move for you know their safety or
S0453	there's a lot of factor yeah yeah other prisoners' safety yeah
S0454	yeah
S0453	yeah
S0454	but i mean they've still get cells there which be design for one person hold two
S0453	segregation units
S0454	and this have this have be go on for age they're not suppose to do that cos it's be outlaw age ago but i mean they literally don't have space
S0453	oh right okay but they but they've get two bed
S0454	that's wrong yeah they've get two bed but i mean you if you've get a tiny cell design for one person and you put two in and they're there twenty three hours a day you're ask for trouble
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	you're ask for them to kick off at some point
S0453	yeah definitely
S0454	and then you've get nowhere to hold them elsewhere
S0453	yeah
S0454	if things do go wrong so
S0453	this be true you're right you're right
S0454	this be yeah
S0453	it's not a it's not a vote win erm thing
S0454	that's the problem people yeah
S0453	no one people don't like prisons
S0454	yes people don't like they think good they're in prison and they fight good
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	er they're in prison they deserve it oh you say the facilities aren't very good in prison you know cos they're overcrowd who care they deserve it
S0453	so unless unless there's public attention i mean you seem quite concern about this but
S0454	mm
S0453	your average voter isn't so unless and until it become an election issue governments aren't go to care
S0454	that's the trouble isn't it no you're right
S0453	and and they're in for four years and they don't they don't give a toss you know they're just there to to to basically erm polish their erm legacy and reputation and and do what erm er what what what's likely to be popular and look popular and that's it
S0454	mm yeah
S0453	this be not this be not in that category of erm of policies isn't it
S0454	that's true it's not a vote winner
S0453	be it sorry
S0454	and it's it's erm an expense as well it's go to be something that if you do tackle it would need huge amount of money throw at it so that's not go to be popular with anyone when we're say that school can't have money school be face a fund crisis
S0453	yeah
S0454	and then we're go to talk about give a lot of money to the prison service for people who have do something wrong i mean most people be go to say that money should be spend on school or hospitals
S0453	yeah
S0454	but for me it's a matter of basic human right like that and also if you want to stop people offend in the first place or reoffending then you need to tackle this problem
S0453	yeah and i think one one area that you know that the revolution will be televise kind of seem to highlight quite a lot be enforcement of tax against big corporations
S0454	yeah
S0453	that be actually liable for huge amount
S0454	that's right you but part of the problem with that be the government be scar if they take on say costa coffee
S0453	of piss of the big lobby
S0454	starbucks or whoever it be but it's not just that those company will threaten to move elsewhere
S0453	elsewhere
S0454	and that's what hsbc have threaten to do you know just this last week
S0453	after the whole tax crackdown
S0454	after this whole swiss scandal and then the mps you know really jump on them cos of the election they have to
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	then of course they've just immediately go fine we'll withdraw our headquarter from london and we won't have this problem any more so that's what they're worry about that they'll move to countries who be less stringent
S0453	true
S0454	and then we've not only you know lose the tax you know the tax that we already weren't get but we've also lose job
S0453	but also the business and job yeah absolutely
S0454	the business and the what they be what they be bring to the country but too bad i'm sorry it's just that's tough like we have to to tackle these people you can't expect the individual to pay when we see these huge corporations get away with it
S0453	this be true yeah this be this be the trouble it's the it's the people at the bottom of the ring that wind up pay erm you know basically contribute most to government revenue because they don't understand the tax system they don't have these the the the ways and mean to avoid erm to legally avoid pay tax and they can't sit down with with erm hmrc and say okay look we'll pay you half or we'll pay you a quarter they can't negotiate a deal
S0454	mm mm yeah that's right
S0453	and
S0454	and that's wrong
S0453	it be wrong so anyway yeah shall we er
S0454	call it a day
S0453	call it a day yeah brilliant
S0454	yeah oh sorry
