S0618	have to go now yeah
S0619	oh it's just the greatest
S0618	yeah
S0619	so
S0618	that's nice my uncle's get er
S0618	this boat and i be on it before christmas which be lovely and he community
S0619	yeah nice
S0618	yeah and rid a motorbike as well
S0618	you you there's a there's a shake of the head that go with rid a bike you know oh
S0618	you don't you don't take a hand off but there's sort of a
S0618	and actually that be the same way that northern ireland people who be not on a motorbike also greet each other in the street
S0619	oh nice
S0618	so if you pass somebody on the street in northern ireland you there's that same sort of shake of the head sort of like a
S0619	mm mm
S0618	they can even have a grumpy face and not even necessarily smile at you but it's just sort of a i acknowledge your presence and your existence yeah
S0619	i see that you be there yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0618	but actually that's kinda curious cos live in the relatively rural community that i live in here i still wanna say hello to people
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	or at least make eye contact with people
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i find even where i live where you would expect that anybody you're pass be a neighbour within
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	a two minute walk erm you'd expect they would at least make eye contact to acknowledge your existence in some small way but
S0619	yeah
S0618	it just doesn't happen so
S0619	i yeah i agree and when i come back here after christmas i walk somewhere and saw like an old man on the pavement outside the house and they say
S0618	yeah
S0619	why do they do that
S0618	why do i say hello to that strange man
S0619	yeah why do i hello to him
S0619	but erm
S0618	oh that look like good coffee
S0619	yeah look very nice
S0619	er but when i be in england near my house cos it's quite rural erm and i be walk home from my friend's and it's on a sort of concrete walk lane er and then you just say hello to anybody who's walk or cycle past
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know and it's normal
S0618	yeah
S0619	fairly normal
S0618	i know mm
S0619	don't know
S0618	yeah northern ireland i think my particular bite of northern ireland because it be so rural everybody say hello
S0619	yeah
S0618	i suppose cos that part of northern ireland as well people probably presume that you're their cousin
S0619	mm true
S0618	kind of like rural norfolk i suppose most people be relate
S0619	erm they also you know it's a dog walk thing as well if you've
S0618	yeah
S0619	get a dog you say hello to anyone else who have a dog
S0618	yeah
S0619	like
S0618	yeah
S0619	that's just the rule
S0618	it's the law
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah it's curious isn't it
S0619	and also love it when bus drivers wave to each other
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know if they're the same number bus but on
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	different
S0618	different route
S0619	time
S0618	that i find really weird i don't about you but i always thank the bus driver
S0619	yeah i do it's
S0618	and that just do not happen here and sometimes i've be tempt to shout thank you as i depart the bus and have remember where i be and not do it
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but i yeah i yeah it just seem really unnatural to not
S0619	yeah to get off the bus and say
S0618	thank the bus driver
S0619	say thank you yeah
S0618	yeah i wonder would it be different if instead of pre purchase a ticket that you then validate i wonder would it be different if you buy a ticket from the driver
S0619	if you buy it mm mm
S0618	so you've already have some sort of social engagement
S0619	yeah i wonder what it's like in london i don't know in central london if you get a bus whether you say
S0618	yeah
S0619	hello goodbye
S0618	but i dunno if the bus be on your oyster card
S0619	yeah on pre pay mm
S0618	yeah so you probably don't there but i don't know
S0619	yeah but you must still get on the bus so so you you get on the bus but you walk past the driver
S0618	yeah
S0619	so you would just hello
S0618	not necessarily you get off at the back or in the middle still wouldn't you
S0619	mm don't know
S0618	i just think i don't actually know i actually know now i know one person that live in london now but more an acquaintance than a friend
S0619	yeah i'll ask my friend
S0618	yeah no i've get a friend
S0619	yeah
S0618	who's move to rotterdam i think possibly today actually
S0619	mm this could be rotterdam or anywhere
S0618	or anywhere liverpool or rome yeah
S0619	oh right i didn't know people actually live there i just think it be part of the you don't
S0618	it's always scary
S0619	i just don't consider it to er be a place where people live
S0618	yeah i suppose where the tourists who aren't take drug or have sex with prostitute go to rotterdam i don't know
S0619	yes yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	why on earth would you want to go there
S0619	that's very bore

S0618	since i tick the opt out box on the rat race i don't think i've ever be happier and i certainly haven't
S0619	yeah
S0618	ever have a period in life as i've have in the last two or three years where i'm learn so much about myself and so much about humanity i suppose or my perception of it in my little niches that i tuck myself into from time to time but

S0619	er so i've just decide never to do it
S0618	yeah
S0619	then we all say in these interview you know like if you go and live abroad it's not all one one of the lads say something like erm you know if you live in spain you're not just drink spanish beer with sexy ladies twenty four hours a day
S0618	yeah go to the beach after work yeah
S0619	yeah it's a job like any job
S0618	mm
S0619	erm and sometimes you know you're sit in your room watch iplayer wonder if it's all worth it when you're so far from your family
S0618	mm
S0619	erm but the the positives well outweigh the negative in
S0618	yeah
S0619	this sort of job erm if you're that kind of person erm so it's an it's an interest one you know but this sort of and i be explain how in this industry it's you know it's about the sense of community
S0618	aha
S0619	and in the summer when you're work in england you're like touch base with other people who do
S0618	yeah
S0619	have the same feel that there's more to it than than er
S0618	yeah nine to five rat race
S0619	nine to five yeah
S0618	and be part of that explore other culture be part of that live in another country
S0619	mm mm
S0618	mm
S0619	yeah all sort of question everything and challenge everything and say there's get to be more there's get to be more

S0618	mm
S0619	so you know you can drive yourself mad if you ask that question every time you ever do anything erm

S0618	no it be good to question i think it's good well well not even necessarily to question but to reflect and to
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and gratitude play a big part for me and in count my bless quite literally sometimes and if i'm feel a bite piss off or a bite sad or a bite bore or a bite with life the universe and everything i think it's good for me personally to shift that focus onto what be there in my life that feel good what do i really enjoy
S0619	mm mm
