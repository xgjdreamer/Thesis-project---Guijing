S0015	mm
S0281	erm usually women but people be generally generally fatter but kid as well that's er
S0015	yeah it's true it's like that
S0281	but you've see you've see china and erm
S0015	part of the problem be
S0281	it's a fast food

S0015	yeah but it's not not just that it's even anything that be make even bread's get sugar in you know it's get such a lot of stuff in these things that you end up not know and not know what you're eat so complicate really
S0281	mm
S0015	change in society isn't it really
S0281	oh very much very much so
S0015	what we eat and what we do our live

S0015	mm
S0281	it's er cultural colonisation
S0015	oh i so
S0281	and it's insidious the you know people don't realise they're become more american erm

S0281	true
S0015	and you know you certainly didn't you hear saw the odd american film or something
S0281	yeah
S0015	but now
S0281	but that's why i think it most of it come you know through film and tv show

S0015	i go to my office as
S0015	i sit there and i'll er you know try and formulate some it's very difficult for me though cos i don't know and i don't know her psyche and what she think and what she oh all i can do be kind of guess at what she might how she might react to think
S0281	well it's very selfish
S0015	be she
S0281	mm
S0015	well therefore you know and do you not see that before or do you always know she be quite selfish
S0281	no i didn't realise it but she be
S0015	hm
S0281	first few years i didn't realise
S0015	mm mm well
S0281	i notice just after be bear
S0015	hm after be bear
S0281	mm
S0015	begin to see it what why in what way
S0281	well when she be a baby she she still want to to go out start go out like she do before she have her
S0015	mm
S0281	yeah
S0015	and yet you say she want more children
S0281	yeah that's part of the chinese culture
S0015	mm erm she'll have more now
S0281	i i really don't know
S0015	mm that would be awful for as well mind you if she's have to move to down there to erm
S0015	she won't be able to go out and her mother won't have them two of them will she
S0281	well i can't see that would live at her mother's place i'm sure she she'd get her own
S0015	would she mm what's it what's
S0281	well it's terrible they live on farm it's so dirty
S0015	be it
S0281	yeah horrible i mean the toilet be a hole next to the pigpens you you're squat there over the hole and you've get pig grunt behind you
S0015	and won't go and live there then
S0281	i shouldn't think so
S0015	why why would she take there
S0281	well well because this problem with school in i really
S0015	mm
S0281	we haven't get the right
S0015	to go to school
S0281	to to go to school there
S0015	and yet she have down there
S0281	well yeah cos that's where she's bear she
S0015	where be bear
S0281	yeah
S0015	but not
S0281	well no no but also she's get her mother er to to fall back on for
S0015	mm
S0281	look after everyone
S0015	what's it what's it what do it cost to rent a property there then
S0281	well the flat that we be live in before i come over er it be er nine hundred quid a month for two bedrooms
S0015	nine hundred pound
S0281	yeah
S0015	mm but it's the same as it be here
S0281	for a month for a two bedroom flat
S0015	yeah
S0281	be it
S0015	yeah that's what 's be
S0281	be it
S0015	mm so they're quite expensive then
S0281	yes but they're not rise so much as here because er the property developers er be all count on this never this boom never end and there be lot and lot of properties that be empty now
S0015	what in in china
S0281	as commercial yeah yeah
S0015	mm
S0281	and people be wait for the bubble to burst
S0015	mm so in other word what do that mean that they're not gonna go up they'll start go down
S0281	they it be certainly i mean the stabilisation i should think well it depend on the area of course
S0015	mm what about the flats that you've get
S0281	no it's in it's not very er commercial area and er the the value hasn't really go up er as much as it have in other part of the country and er so the rent be very very reasonable there
S0015	they be
S0281	mm
S0015	why do you buy in that area again
S0281	well that's that's where i be work and that's where er
S0015	oh right yeah yeah
S0281	be bear and think
S0015	mm mm
S0281	i i have no idea i'd be move on to university
S0015	mm mm mm
S0281	and of course i like along with everybody else i think well invest for the future
S0015	mm mm but they haven't go up much but what what sort of rent do they get then
S0281	very er only er a hundred pound each a month
S0015	you only get a hundred pound
S0281	each for each one
S0015	that's odd isn't it
S0281	yeah well
S0015	be be that be that
S0281	it's a very small it's only like er well a one bedroom flat
S0015	they're small
S0281	small small flats
S0015	mm mm mm well where you be work this last time
S0281	oh it's er
S0015	thrive
S0281	yeah
S0015	mm
S0281	absolutely
S0015	mm that's a shame shame it's not buy there and not in the other place but
S0281	mm
S0015	erm what would there likely to be where she's gonna go then in
S0281	i've get no idea er it should be quite cheap though
S0015	mm
S0281	yeah should be
S0015	well and where's the school compare with erm where they're
S0281	well the school won't be as good because this be er fairly upmarket establishment that's
S0015	mm private
S0281	she go private education and er
S0015	mm
S0281	lot of people get kid in there and
S0015	mm
S0281	lot of people have get their kid in there
S0015	mm
S0281	and er it's yeah it's erm it's not cheap
S0015	no
S0281	it be actually start apparently by a a guy who start out er rummage through dustbins and rubbish bin and sort of sell stuff or that kind of thing and er he just build it up build it up er and then
S0015	but how would he how do he start it then
S0281	well i i don't know the detail but he start make a lot of money and one thing come to another and er eventually er create this school it's huge absolutely huge
S0015	mm
S0281	yeah but there's so many wealthy people over there its get the most billionaires in the world
S0015	mm mm
S0281	but it's like most place in the world the the gap between the rich and poor be ever widen
S0015	mm of course yeah what erm this school fee how do that how do the school fee compare then to other school fee there you know they be that
S0281	i don't know about other private school really er there's erm one i think another one that the er the the head guy in universities his wife work in it's call the international school and i think their price be er quite high as well
S0015	so so five thousand be a
S0281	erm maybe maybe even more expensive
S0015	be it five be it how much theirs be five thousand a what
S0281	pound a year
S0015	a year
S0281	mm
S0015	that that compare with what i mean obviously you're talk about your flat be what you pay here but a private school here would be astronomical
S0281	mm
S0015	in comparison
S0281	mm
S0015	i mean erm i think you're talk something like twenty thousand a year now price
S0281	a year
S0015	yeah yeah
S0281	wow
S0015	private school be just over the top
S0281	really oh
S0015	unbelievable and that's why people move to areas where there be good school
S0281	mm
S0015	that you know and so they've property in an area where there's good school go up
S0281	mm
S0015	so and and that that this area be one of the best be not that we know that or or that know it but erm school have get a good it's a teach school they teach other teachers there
S0281	ah
S0015	you know they all go to that school for
S0281	mm
S0015	you know tuition er or to lead the way share best practice and you know help other teachers
S0281	mm
S0015	it's a very good school but erm you know like when be at his private school that be about fifteen thousand set between twelve and fifteen thousand a year
S0281	be that warrant
S0015	hm
S0281	spend that amount of money on his education see that he's go into a a manual
S0015	well yeah but he he be dyslexic
S0281	oh be he ah
S0015	yeah oh yeah and so's
S0281	be he
S0015	oh yes and be yeah
S0281	really
S0015	mm yeah yeah but erm they have to fight to get him in that school fight to get him a place there
S0281	oh
S0015	yeah 's dyslexic and and erm and be run through the mail side of i don't know where it i mean i would think be probably dyslexic as well i don't know don't really know and
S0281	it's all greek to him
S0015	hm no yeah erm but be i'm sure dyslexic but he's one of those extremely i mean do the definition dyslexic be that you're a average or above average but with specific difficulties well have get no difficulties with money but erm if you ask him to sit down and write letter he wouldn't do it very well erm and be very good at lot of things
S0281	mm
S0015	but again it'll be sit down write a letter or keep his book 's quite good at keep well he's not at keep his book have to do it but and so do but i mean be one of those who always say you know you do this this be your job and my job be that and i'll pay someone to do it that's 's approach he's earn the money he's he's so good with money so fast work out not you know if you say about buy property or whatever he will tell you not just how much it will cost you he'll work it out but all of the additional cost that you won't think about
S0281	mm
S0015	he'll have it all in his head he's so good with property very good and that he do this be erm commercial property because he doesn't they have full repair lease they have to pay for the repair
S0281	mm
S0015	and erm his his erm commercial properties be rent out and they have to it's ten year lease they have to have enough money up front for collateral for him to rent them out for ten years
S0281	mm
S0015	in other word they could pay ten years rent without
S0281	mm
S0015	and the repair without you know they've get enough collateral for that
