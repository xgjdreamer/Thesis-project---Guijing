S0456	it usually it's only professors who do
S0464	yes
S0464	so you're not do your
S0456	mm
S0464	ship or whatever what do you have to do for that more work
S0456	more work
S0456	in finland you have to do nothing
S0464	what do you mean
S0456	we've we've just appoint a new professor at
S0464	yeah
S0456	with with that kind of you know with what they've get
S0464	yeah
S0456	you can barely get a normal entry level job in britain
S0456	yeah
S0464	and
S0456	in britain you have to have i think at least five book god know how many other publications
S0464	oh right
S0456	it's usually a mix
S0464	yeah
S0456	a book it's the equivalent of
S0464	journals article and
S0456	of of three or five article or something like that plus you know responsibility for x y and z
S0464	yeah
S0456	plus ideally be great with get money in and it's like well i don't want really want to waste all my time on fill up grant things
S0464	yeah
S0456	cos i want to actually do research
S0456	so and i've get professors just end up do load of admin they don't really do yeah they do research do admin do very little teach
S0464	i hate admin
S0456	yeah
S0464	bloody bore yeah
S0456	yeah have that get any worse over the last five years
S0464	which the admin
S0456	admin anything
S0464	oh yeah
S0456	tell me about the last five years i'm sure you've get a lot to tell
S0464	oh gosh what's happen in the last five years so where be we two thousand and fifteen
S0456	anything you
S0464	what within my job you mean
S0456	yeah
S0464	well it have really yeah erm the folks be now a lot more on erm long term condition and
S0456	mm mm
S0464	diabetes and stuff
S0456	mm
S0464	so that's become more of of a a thing in the last five years
S0456	mm
S0464	erm
S0456	be that because
S0464	i'm just try to think
S0456	be that because of more obesity or
S0464	well that yeah obesity's gonna be i think the new the new thing and also things like fatty livers as well
S0456	mm
S0456	what's that
S0464	fatty liver i mean
S0456	too much beer
S0464	well no no you'd think that wouldn't you
S0464	but it can be obesity so it have a knock on effect
S0456	mm
S0464	so non alcoholic fatty liver disease
S0456	mm
S0464	but
S0456	that sound scary
S0464	yeah it's a lot a lot's change really in the last five years i think within our
S0456	mm mm mm
S0464	cos the ccg's no more now
S0456	mm
S0464	there's not gonna be any more erm
S0456	mm mm
S0464	but it's with all
S0456	mm
S0464	the governments i mean
S0456	mm
S0464	change and everything but erm they've get now a federation
S0456	mm mm
S0464	like an nhs federation
S0456	mm yeah
S0464	which be just really like an old health authority like there be years ago
S0464	erm but no they focus on preventative things like the now so like prevent
S0456	mm
S0464	obesity prevent this
S0456	mm
S0464	prevent which can lead to diabetes
S0456	yeah
S0464	blah di blah
S0464	but i think yeah i think the admin have get
S0456	mm
S0464	a bite worse actually erm but now freshers in september they're bring in erm online
S0456	mm
S0464	applications so that'll be a lot better for freshers
S0456	mm
S0464	whether it'll work or not
S0456	mm
S0456	yeah
S0464	cos we have something like ten thousand turnover of patients
S0456	yeah
S0464	so they either you know cos there's like a thing every three years they'll move on won't they do you know what i mean
S0456	mm yeah yeah you should tag them like dog with microchip so
S0464	mm and you'll see them in september and do you know what they're just so na√Øve the poor little students
S0456	it's a bite like
S0456	it's a bite like trainee teacher's isn't it
S0464	yeah
S0456	so they come and then within the first couple of months they they get disabuse and suddenly find out no it's actually hard graft
S0464	yeah i know but
S0456	mm
S0464	it a lot's change but erm not in well student health really kind of
S0456	mm mm
S0464	go more nurse lead now so it's always a bite like that but
S0456	mm
S0464	it's run by the nurse now not the doctor they do have doctor there but
S0456	mm mm
S0464	it's mostly run by us now
S0456	okay
S0464	so
S0456	so it's it stay in the profession
S0464	yeah but
S0456	you probably like doctor even less now because you see so little of them
S0464	yeah well we see them like but you know we're
S0456	mm
S0464	probably cheaper than doctor aren't we i suppose
S0456	yeah
S0464	you know we do a lot we do as well we don't do as much but
S0456	mm
S0464	we can do like prescribe and stuff like that so we be cheaper than doctor i suppose cheap labour
S0456	yeah yeah well it's i i'm sure a lot of the er run of the mill stuff and it's far more often now that if you go and see the gp
S0464	mm
S0456	and you want an appointment you get an appointment with a nurse unless
S0464	yeah yeah that's it i mean and and also what we've get be be in the last five years that's a new thing be the walk in
S0456	mm
S0464	so basically
S0456	mm
S0464	you can come in sit and wait and get an appointment
S0456	mm
S0464	so whereas like
S0464	five years ago
S0456	mm
S0464	you'd have appointments for the doctor like you could just book
S0456	yeah
S0464	but now you come in and you you just sit and wait
S0456	mm mm
S0464	so that's the there's an impact really i don't know whether sometimes that create a little bite of a monster really with
S0456	mm
S0464	they're get more
S0456	mm
S0464	dependent on you
S0456	yeah
S0464	cos you notice the students come in and some of them be in every other day
S0456	mm
S0464	so you create like a dependency which be not really good either
S0456	mm no
S0464	they can just come in whenever they want
S0464	you know
S0456	mm sound a bite
S0464	yeah but i mean and in you know doctor 's in be you in there
S0456	mm no i'm erm
S0464	oh be you
S0456	which be which be really i mean it have change completely because they the guy who run it he actually own the practice but he's retire now so now it's it's
S0464	oh right
S0456	i don't know because i don't a i'm not here and
S0464	yeah
S0456	b i'm not enough so i don't really go there very often
S0464	yeah
S0456	erm so every time in the last few time that i've be i always would see somebody else
S0464	mm
S0456	and it just seem to be a lot of doctor and then of course a lot of intern
S0464	yeah
S0456	erm there be age ago there be this guy from austria and i
S0464	yeah
S0456	i think i don't understand him and i'm not quite sure whether he understand me
S0464	but you'd be more be able to understand them than anyone wouldn't you
S0456	mm mm yeah yeah i should've i should've i should've
S0464	see that's another
S0456	mm
S0464	thing as well you don't get the continuity
S0456	mm
S0464	so you don't see your the same doctor
S0456	no
S0464	do you know what i mean which be not a good thing either
S0456	no no because before it be yeah there be doctor
S0464	mm
S0456	but he wasn't my doctor but there be a female doctor and she be the one who be my gp
S0464	mm
S0456	within the practice
S0464	yeah
S0456	and it be only if she be off or whatever
S0464	yeah
S0456	that we would see her when she leave then it become all yeah you would see whoever
S0464	yeah yeah but you see the elderly now have get to have their own doctor they've get to have their own name doctor
S0456	mm mm
S0464	and anyone with a long term condition have gotta have their own doctor
S0456	that make sense
S0464	so they kind of can request to see them but then again you be could be wait a couple of weeks to see them
S0456	yeah
S0464	do you know what i mean
S0456	yeah so it's it's it's in theory that they've get their own doctor and in practice only if they're lucky
S0464	it doesn't really work mm but i suppose if they see the doctor they can book them in
S0456	mm
S0464	say well
S0456	mm
S0464	i'll see you in two months they can book them in for two months do you know what i mean with them
S0456	yeah
S0464	but that that's the the main thing that's happen really erm
S0456	mm
S0464	and i mean over the winter
S0456	mm
S0464	god it's horrendous sometimes you know it's really busy
S0456	yeah yeah and it i suppose it also depend how the winter pan out if it if it's a mild winter it's probably not as bad
S0464	flu yeah but the you know flu and stuff like that
S0456	mm mm
S0464	and but erm no so that's change really in the last five years
S0456	mm
S0464	but i think also as well the government want us to do
S0456	mm
S0464	like seven days a week don't they
S0456	mm it's like well yeah people be still
S0464	for like seven days a week
S0456	be still ill seven days a week because
S0464	mm
S0456	there be always
S0464	yeah
S0456	that kind of service but you wouldn't have
S0464	yeah
S0456	i think it's it's just operations wasn't it
S0464	yeah but gps years ago they use to be on call
S0456	mm
S0464	so say you be unwell
S0456	yeah
S0464	they would come out and see you at the weekend
S0456	yeah
S0464	erm but none of that now but i think what what
S0456	mm
S0464	cos we do quite a few late nights as well do your surgery do late nights
S0456	mm yeah i think there there must be a day and
S0464	yeah
S0456	at least one where it's
S0464	yeah
S0456	later than usual
S0464	yeah
S0456	they they they use to close at five and now i think it's seven
S0464	be it
S0456	so
S0464	yeah
S0456	well but it's it's
S0464	yeah
S0456	i'm not ill enough
S0464	no
S0456	to know
S0464	but the thing be if you're work as well you know
S0456	mm
S0464	sometimes you can't get it in so
S0456	mm
S0464	it be good for people who work you know the weekend
S0456	yeah
S0464	but i just don't know how they're gonna kind of do it it's gonna be hard because
S0456	mm mm
S0464	there's no more fund for it at all
S0456	yeah
S0464	so i don't know whether i i hear there be talk that the er walk in centre
S0456	mm
S0464	be gonna do it between them and have designate ones open at the weekend
S0456	mm mm yeah
S0464	and the others kinda close do you know what i mean
S0456	i think that's what they do on the i think they've get
S0464	do yeah
S0456	two or three walk in centre and they split the load between them but i think that might be might not even be for the weekend i'm not sure
S0464	yeah cos we've get no we haven't get
S0456	mm mm
S0456	mm
S0464	and the city centre that's all we've get here
S0456	yeah
S0464	down this end
S0456	cos it be more than that wasn't it be there not one
S0464	think erm
S0456	somewhere
S0464	the one in be a children's one
S0456	okay
S0464	so that's only kid
S0456	mm
S0464	erm no i think that's all we've have but there's load in isn't there and round there
S0456	mm mm mm that's probably where the demand be
S0464	yeah that's it
S0464	suppose dunno yeah so there's a lot change
S0456	mm
S0464	but just gotta go with the flow we usually do go with the flow to be honest we have to because
S0456	mm well yeah you can't just
S0464	you have to go with the flow and
S0456	stop it's it's a
S0464	but i'm in and they're really good i mean i phone up say today and i'd get an appointment tomorrow
S0456	mm mm mm yeah
S0464	or the day after do you know what i mean so they're quite good like but i don't really go the doctor's touch wood really
S0456	yeah
S0464	i'd just ask one of the
S0464	i'd just ask one of the docs in work
S0456	yeah
S0464	so what do you think about that how would you what would you think about that
S0456	yeah i think i think that the greatest hazard that you have be be be just work relate someone's get the flu and it's
S0464	yeah
S0456	it's the kind of strain that catch you
S0464	you have it
S0456	yeah
S0464	but also them all come in
S0456	mm
S0464	you know but i think you do build up an immunity don't you
S0456	yeah
S0464	i know i do i mean i usually get a sore throat in january
S0456	mm
S0464	that's usually when i get my sore throat
S0456	yeah when everybody else be fine
S0464	yeah and do you know
S0456	mm
S0464	but usually it only last for about four or five days so that's usually alright i can just bear with it but
S0456	yeah
S0464	erm you do get all kinds of come in
S0456	i think that's the same with teach i mean we we finish an then i go er to a conference paris great

S0456	it's from them and then they try to this and then
S0464	oh yeah that be terrible that
S0456	this old poor old lady that couldn't speak english and couldn't understand why the heat didn't work and i think what it be not know it i think whoever be there before have use the emergency which be about five pound you put five pound in
S0464	right
S0456	so it still didn't work because it just cover
S0464	the bite oh right
S0456	the credit she have
S0464	oh god

S0456	they didn't i think they only live a couple of roads away erm but yeah no that's the thing she she could
S0464	that be awful that
S0456	she could barely speak english so we we could yeah even if we want
S0464	yeah it be awful that he just leave her didn't he
S0456	yeah and but that obviously didn't last long i mean she the quietest neighbour ever
S0464	yeah and sometimes it be the better the devil you know but still i dunno

S0464	yeah
S0464	and can hear it from her house as well
S0456	well that's what i think
S0464	yeah
S0456	i i wake up and i wasn't quite sure be it just because they've get the window open but i think he be outside
S0464	what be he do outside
S0456	and he it's like yeah he use the key
S0464	be he out be he out all night or something be he then maybe
S0456	i don't know i think they have the one key so
S0456	rather than get a second key
S0464	for god's sake just common sense isn't it
S0456	mm
S0464	but they will i you know what i just think they haven't get any common sense whatsoever
S0456	no
S0464	it's just they don't use their brain
S0456	this be just therefore therefore therefore yeah the idea of responsibility it's tricky
S0464	i'm entitle to it
S0456	so you do yeah and and you read it and you know should you pity them or should you cos yeah what can you do i mean he doesn't seem to be the brightest of very burn out spark
S0464	but neither do she so
S0456	yeah
S0464	but you see see the mother and you think god well it's learn behaviour isn't it
S0456	yeah
S0464	so if the mum and dad or the mum be on
S0456	mm
S0464	benefit they're gonna be on benefit aren't they
S0456	yeah and of course those four see nothing but
S0464	it's terrible they've get no chance have they
S0456	yeah
S0464	i just feel sorry for them
S0456	yeah i think there be an initiative probably still in the labour government i don't know and they try they say well these be the
S0464	yeah
S0456	the tough ones and basically you get mentor everything
S0464	yeah
S0456	and
S0464	be that be if
S0456	cos it's
S0464	if be that if they're quite bright the children be that if they
S0456	i don't no no no i think it be it be
S0464	oh be that for everyone
S0456	problems problem families which would be call problem families but it's it's just where you have
S0464	mm
S0456	yeah usually more than one child in the house a history of non work and
S0464	oh right
S0456	educational underachievement er you have to fulfil certain criteria
S0464	yeah yeah
S0456	and then yeah basically you're get some money because clearly nobody show them what do what can you do
S0464	so parent skills and stuff like that and
S0456	yeah yeah life skills and basically you have yeah like you not a fairy godmother but like a good uncle or a good
S0464	yeah
S0456	and who's
S0464	yeah
S0456	sort of take a lot of stuff off your neck
S0464	but you see if they haven't get a mother who's get those skills they're not gonna learn it be they
S0456	no well that's what i mean and therefore
S0464	yeah
S0456	you would have somebody who's like state appoint
S0464	yeah
S0456	which which must've work because they
S0464	mm
S0456	it's yeah
S0464	that that go didn't it
S0456	if you
S0464	i mean this government and
S0456	yeah
S0456	well this be this be why i come back campaign and i think oh well i get rid of esther mcvey
S0464	oh i be make up with that
S0456	yeah i claim two of those vote
S0464	that's do you
S0456	i speak to ann widdecombe
S0464	do you
S0456	she be there and yeah
S0464	oh be she there be she
S0456	she she's little old lady i i just think i'm not gonna have an argument with her this
S0464	yeah
S0456	old witch and she be there leave by herself
S0464	yeah
S0456	and then when i stop talk to her go for the train massive rainstorm come
S0464	mm mm
S0456	and she didn't even have a brolly
S0464	oh right
S0456	and you're like former minister of the crown you know if we have anybody who's prominent on the labour party side
S0464	yeah
S0456	they'll be in a group
S0464	yeah
S0456	she be there with her clipboard and then all the train be cancel and i think yeah that be her government that privatise it it's just all fit together
S0456	horrible
S0464	that esther mcvey though ooh she butter a lot of people up the wrong way
S0456	yeah yeah yeah
S0464	oh i didn't like her at all
S0456	yeah i think margaret greenwood she be a gp isn't she
S0464	be she the one who be who take her place
S0456	yeah yeah
S0464	oh be she
S0456	yeah and of course the first the first one of the first things she say be erm i think mental health be one of those things but that's
S0464	yeah
S0456	luciana berger be big on that but
S0464	yeah
S0456	fire fire station fire engines
S0464	oh yeah get rid of all of them aren't they
S0456	cos they yeah and the have be reduce and you think like that might be alright if you have like the odd fire in a house but do you do if if it's like you know the big ones that
S0464	yeah
S0456	in the news so you have to have other firefighters
S0464	and all of them have to go yeah
S0456	yeah and and all
S0464	but also they they they're work as well till they're
S0456	mm
S0464	what age do they want them to work now sixty be it
S0456	yeah yeah
S0464	sixty two or something
S0456	just like they have to be fantastically fit
S0464	but how you gonna get i mean i'm not be funny you're not gonna get a fit a sixty two year old as a fit twenty four year old
S0456	well you get the odd ones but
S0464	but not on average be you
S0456	no no
S0456	plus of course it's it's the same it's it's like if you do labour rather than george osborne's job
S0456	apparently his his one job be fold tablecloths that's the one job he's ever do in his life
S0456	yeah
S0464	oh he's he's quite privilege then isn't he
S0456	he's straight straight from eton into yeah
S0464	they all be even i mean that david cameron be as well
S0456	yeah
S0464	it it you know
S0456	he only he only have to make sure that thirty five er royals die and he'll be king of england
S0456	he's a distant cousin of the queen
S0464	who david cameron
S0456	yeah his great great grandfather be an illegitimate illegitimate son of the then king
S0456	so he's thirty sixth in line to the throne
S0464	so he's still get a claim to the throne even though he be
S0456	yeah
S0464	oh right
S0456	so funnily enough that the circle he be in
S0464	mm
S0456	and the circle the queen be in there be overlap which be like you can't think of gordon brown or david miliband people who who be royals
S0464	mm
S0464	i know but i just didn't even i mean up until the last like the day before
S0456	mm mm
S0464	i think labour would've get in but i dunno i think when i go to vote i think nah like they're not gonna get in
S0456	yeah yeah i mean here it it be deceptive because when people don't vote and people i have to
S0464	that's where the problem be where they're vote where they don't vote
S0456	yeah but a lot more people have vote and of course
S0464	yeah oh right
S0456	here in erm the vote have go up but they be already labour mps so
S0464	yeah
S0456	yes we get the vote but in the wrong place so
S0464	you need to take away the vote didn't you
S0456	yeah
S0464	from like
S0456	yeah
S0464	conservative and stuff
S0456	but that be the thing and that never happen because
S0464	yeah
S0456	if you look at the total vote erm ed miliband get more than gordon brown get more than even tony blair in two thousand five
S0464	yeah
S0456	erm
S0456	just in the wrong place erm
S0464	mm
S0456	so
S0464	who do you think should be the new labour leader then
S0456	i've get no idea i've get because after all the campaign i think maybe i rejoin as an international
S0464	well you get a vote anyway don't you if you're a member of the labour party
S0456	well i i i stop be a member when i leave the country
S0464	oh do you
S0456	because i think it's a bite pointless so i've rejoin now
S0464	yeah
S0456	but erm i think god it's they're all c listers and liz kendall now say oh yeah the the money from the lottery shouldn't go into arts and i think well arts very important to me so
S0464	so why would they go into arts
S0456	well it's well
S0464	she want it to go where do she want it to go
S0456	because well everything else
S0464	into public spend
S0456	in yeah
S0464	no i don't agree with that at all do you
S0456	obviously not so i mean liz kendall be never my favourite but you know she
S0464	it's but it's not her money to dictate anyway be it
S0456	i think i mean she there be one thing that it be a reject when reject when labour in ninety seven
S0464	yeah
S0456	but it wasn't like we don't do arts
S0464	i know
S0456	it be just like well we do it broader rather than just millions for the royal opera and then like hundreds leave for other things
S0464	yeah
S0456	and they i think before sport wasn't really big and that have become because olympics
S0464	mm that's become big yeah that's become bigger
S0456	and
S0464	yeah
S0456	and you know it have work because john major's olympics they have to sell their medals in order to fly back to britain and you know
S0456	the twenty twelve olympics how well be it then
S0464	yeah
S0456	so that work but erm so yeah i i'll probably vote for yvette cooper unless she come up with something odd but
S0464	what's the other chap what's the other chap
S0456	andy burnham
S0464	erm well see i like him
S0456	yeah he he be a liverpudlian
S0464	yeah
S0456	who just have to happen to the vote and he's never turn and he's get all the liverpool supporters on his side because he be on the campaign
S0464	yeah yeah
S0456	but i don't know he be he come fourth the last time round and i i'm sure he's good
S0464	oh do he
S0456	yeah but i don't know but that's what i mean it's it's it's i've never really know jeremy corbyn it's like he's the leave so
S0464	there be a few what be those few lads that be really good and then they didn't wanna go for the run what be it one of them be in the army
S0456	the the guy who yeah nobody have hear of him
S0464	i like
S0456	and then suddenly yeah
S0464	but i like him yeah he seem quite erm
S0456	but he must've think yeah i've see what they've do to ed miliband do i want my family to be under that kind of pressure
S0464	yeah cos hadn't he be under a lot of pressure with his wife and die and everything hadn't she or something and he be
S0456	yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean if you look at the kind of job it be and you think like
S0464	up the kid
S0456	do i really want to you know
S0464	i mean they just take the mickey out of him in the end i think didn't they
S0456	yeah
S0464	i just didn't like him though and i mean i'd never vote conservative
S0456	mm mm
S0464	but i just didn't think he be strong enough
S0456	well that be that be that be the issue that everybody
S0464	and that's the reason yeah i just didn't think he be strong enough
S0456	it's but then of course you know you always think well you know that's what they say in the seventies a woman how can a woman be prime minister
S0464	yeah oh god
S0456	and
S0456	and there be lot of people who think oh yeah labour just have it because of the winter of discontent blah blah blah
S0464	yeah
S0456	and then they never stop regret vote tory for the first time and
S0464	yeah
S0456	last time in their live
S0464	mm
S0456	i don't know it's the worst thing be that there's this really long period where nothing happen so we haven't really get an opposition i mean they like they they just get away with murder it's like
S0456	yeah oh i wake up and the rest of the royal mail have go where do that happen
S0464	yeah yeah they'll just do whatever they want won't they
S0456	yeah yeah they're free and
S0464	mm
S0456	i just hope the budget will be an omnishambles
S0464	oh well well they're get rid of the inheritance tax and we know who that's for don't we
S0456	yeah i mean er i know so many people who have house that
S0464	toffs mm
S0456	a million pound worth
S0464	yeah
S0456	and you know you think like yeah that work well i know somebody
S0464	i suppose they've work for it
S0456	well i know somebody and their house be probably just under but it's in london and that's where it be
S0464	yeah
S0456	you know in the south in the south east that might work but yeah even their house which be big it's not the most desirable part but i think even their house be still value just under a million
S0464	yeah yeah but it would be down there wouldn't it
S0456	yeah
S0464	if you've get any outside space or anything it's gonna be quite a lot of money isn't it down there
S0456	yeah and if
S0464	but i think well do you know what they've work for that house they've pay for it
S0456	mm
S0464	you know they've go to work and work for it
S0456	mm
S0464	so why should it be tax
S0456	mm yeah but i mean they haven't do the price increase
S0464	yeah
S0456	i mean it's it's you're dead you're go and that's the way it's it's
S0464	yeah
S0456	it's not so much that okay we pass it on to the children it's the trouble be that yeah you give a million to the children and then by the time they're older it's like ten million
S0464	yeah
S0456	and what about the people who could not even save up to have a deposit
S0464	yeah yeah
S0456	so you know it it just go apart
S0464	yeah
S0456	and you think like well you're never gonna push anybody to be a billionaire and the children become paupers
S0464	yeah
S0456	you you can be intelligent about it because that's what
S0464	yeah
S0456	paul mccartney do he say well
S0464	yeah
S0456	i'm not gonna give my children everything they want
S0464	yeah
S0456	you know they they have set allowance and that's i might be a millionaire who care
S0464	yeah
S0456	eventually they will get a lot
S0464	yeah
S0456	but you know
S0464	eventually yeah but
S0456	well they've get the name anyway
S0464	yeah
S0456	they they're not gonna
S0464	and she's in her own right isn't she
S0456	yeah
S0464	but erm sting's like that sting say he's not gonna give any of this money to the kid didn't he
S0456	mm well by the time he die he'll he'll be about a hundred and twenty with his tantric sex and
S0464	he's gonna spend it all i know and
S0456	super healthy live
S0464	oh yoga and all that palaver
S0456	yeah so
S0464	mm
S0456	but you know for everybody else i think that's that's still just a tiny sliver of the population and you know if you want that it's well it be the last government that take away the the child bonus wasn't it because
S0464	yeah
S0456	you think like yeah you put a thousand pound into the bank and by the time they go in to do university or finish school
S0464	yeah yeah
S0456	that'll be
S0464	a nice little pot for when they go and get a car or whatever
S0456	yeah doesn't doesn't cost the government much
S0464	no
S0456	and you know it's it be one of those things that make sense because it have be prove to be useful but like
S0464	mm
S0456	too socialist
S0464	yeah but i mean yeah and have get theirs somewhere
S0456	mm mm
S0464	in natwest or something can move them now apparently into their own isas their own individual isas
S0456	mm mm
S0464	so you could change that if you want to but it's just look which one's the best cos they're all crap
S0456	yeah yeah and they're all crap yeah it's it's like i've just open
S0464	they're all crap
S0456	i just move because i can you know
S0464	yeah
S0456	it wasn't much just move it and the next thing i get be a letter say our rat have change and of course they've change now
S0464	yeah
S0456	it's like
S0464	yeah you need to look at that every year
S0456	mm
S0464	and i think sometimes you need to fix it
S0456	yeah
S0464	you those first ones
S0456	that's what i do because mine the isa be with natwest because it be then three percent
S0464	yeah
S0456	then it fell and then it they say well you have to you need to keep in the fix and the fix one just mature this
S0464	yeah
S0456	year so it's in an isa like with hsbc which be only
S0464	yeah
S0456	one point four percent
S0464	it's better than erm er some of them they're some of them be rubbish
S0456	and yeah
S0464	we use to get a lot each month cos we use to get dividends each month on ours and you don't now
S0456	well yeah well it's it's just because the interest rat be so low
S0464	it's
S0456	and with because that's that's another thing with osborne
S0464	they want you to spend it
S0456	well it's it's because the the only ways to to control em be either what the bank do or what the government do if the government say well we don't want to take tax from you but we spend a lot er the bank have to do it which mean the bank have to create money
S0464	yeah
S0456	which mean you can't have high interest rat
S0464	yeah cos
S0456	if you have that the economy go against the wall
S0464	yeah
S0456	and because they say oh we'll raise them and of course if they go up save go up
S0464	yeah
S0456	i mean for me it be great i pay the house off because
S0464	yeah
S0456	every month it just
S0464	yeah
S0456	it be less
S0464	yeah
S0456	well now
S0456	yeah
S0464	so how long have you be in that house now for
S0456	well i move in in two thousand two so it's thirteen years
S0464	oh do god be it
S0456	so yeah because it be
S0464	two thousand two
S0456	as i say wasn't bear yet
S0464	yeah
S0456	and that's
S0464	yeah
S0456	when we last record it
S0464	so when i think we've be in here seventeen years
S0456	mm
S0464	be it seventeen years
S0456	yeah
S0464	nineteen ninety eight
S0456	yeah
S0464	january so it's a long time isn't it time fly
S0456	exactly and of course i love my house this be
S0464	yeah
S0456	you know ideally that that my house be my office
S0464	it's a great little house isn't it
S0456	and i just do consultancy work
S0464	yeah
S0456	fine
S0464	but you never know what's gonna turn up here though in a couple of years
S0456	yeah
S0464	you might be alright mightn't you
S0456	i just play the lottery
S0464	yeah but even university would you go to
S0456	mm mm mm
S0464	in
S0456	well i do teach at i mean they're they're fairly hopeless but it be
S0464	yeah
S0456	cos i know well i know the people who work there and i know the kind of the job there be
S0464	it's not really
S0456	no but you know it's it be a job after all and be there but i think when i do i do one summer there as a researcher
S0464	mm
S0456	and the lead investigator then just drop it
S0464	didn't like it
S0456	he fell out with the there be only two people
S0464	yeah
S0456	and they fell out with each other
S0464	oh god
S0456	so the other one be the boss so
S0456	i think i be taint by association because i work with him obviously i didn't know him before and then a colleague of mine get it find that she be pregnant and usually that's not really a big issue
S0464	yeah yeah
S0456	but erm with maternity leave they didn't really they be not very forthcoming on everything
S0464	right
S0456	so i think she she think well actually it's it's nice to be with my son and i don't really want to go back
S0464	yeah yeah
S0456	so i think they they must have get this feel well you know be yet another one of these
S0464	mm
S0456	so maybe not because would be ideal you just get on the train
S0464	yeah train isn't it
S0456	and then walk ten minutes to the uni
S0464	what about you try
S0456	i've get a colleague at the
S0464	yeah
