S0423	oh right yeah i guess you've well you can't really sit in the lounge anyway can you
S0421	yeah but i'd never sit in the lounge ever
S0423	you do
S0421	when we have a lounge i literally never use it i be always in my room
S0423	oh right
S0421	like no one ever use the lounge really
S0423	do you have a chair in your room
S0421	yeah
S0423	be it comfortable
S0421	it's okay like it's my desk chair so but i usually sit in my chair all day erm at my desk
S0423	yeah but do you not
S0421	erm
S0423	fancy kind of just spread out on the couch and
S0421	no
S0423	lie down on the couch or something
S0421	no i don't know like i never the only time we ever use the couch be when we be watch a film
S0423	mm and what be you do at your desk all day work
S0421	well no but what be i do at my desk it's a good place to sit and do things work
S0423	well yeah it feel like it if you're at a desk you feel like you should it just feel like a bite of a chore to me sit at a desk
S0421	really
S0423	yeah that's why people have lounge where it's more comfortable that's the place most people spend most of their time although i suppose teenagers now they don't they a lot of time in their bedroom
S0421	because what what
S0421	what do you do in the lounge watch tv i never watch tv
S0423	well you don't have to have the tv on
S0421	and mammy doesn't really sit in the lounge i don't think
S0423	what she just sit in her bedroom as well
S0421	er although yeah like no she'll sometimes she'll be on the computer
S0423	mm
S0421	but she'd only really sit in the lounge when she be watch tv as well
S0423	yeah
S0421	like what what there's like nothing in the lounge you would just sit there and
S0423	no but it's a more comfortable place to sit isn't it i suppose
S0421	er when do we use the oh yeah we also use the lounge if mam be on her laptop and i would bring my laptop down and we'd be on our laptops that's what we do in the lounge but
S0423	yeah i suppose it's change since i be your age
S0421	yeah
S0423	that families all use to just sit in the lounge and
S0421	and and do what
S0423	and watch like your favourite program
S0421	oh
S0423	and things but
S0421	we don't watch tv though
S0423	well they say that the way people even now that do watch tv program it's all change anyway cos they can watch it online and
S0421	yeah
S0423	they do their own thing they don't all sit down as a family
S0421	yeah but you'd all wanna watch something different
S0421	anyway probably
S0423	well that's it yeah that's what they say now it's really different so
S0421	must be it must have be a nightmare to all have to watch the same thing
S0423	well no it's good like when you're a family and you all and you're all sit in the same room sometimes you know it's nice to be you i mean but you're not part of a big family anyway be you
S0421	yeah
S0423	but sometimes you you would have disagreements and arguments over what to watch
S0423	fight over who's get the remote control and things but that's all part of be part of the big family
S0421	but then if you if someone be watch something that you didn't wanna watch would you not just go up and like do something else cos then you're just sit there watch something you don't wanna watch it's like waste your time
S0423	well it depend what it be i mean
S0423	if it be watchable then yeah
S0423	i suppose yeah it doesn't matter but
S0421	you could do something that really enrich your experience at home
S0423	like what
S0421	like read a book or you could
S0423	oh right
S0421	erm i like to go on dictionary dot com
S0423	we didn't have never have
S0421	well yeah you could read the dictionary you could
S0421	erm
S0423	read the dictionary
S0421	well you could read a book instead
S0423	i don't know if anyone
S0421	read book be better read book be good you see you could do that or you could go up and you could you could draw you could erm play with your animals you could you could do anything
S0423	mm
S0421	rather than just sit and watch something that you don't really wanna watch
S0423	mm
S0421	and you're just kind of sit there like nah
S0423	but i mean sometimes you can sit down and watch stuff but you're talk as well with other people in your family aren't you
S0421	but then nobody's really watch it cos it the people that maybe who really want to watch it be get disturb by the talk and the like i can't fully experience this programme with that i and i would be annoy if there be something i really want to watch and people be just like ma ma ma ma ma i'd be like
S0423	yeah
S0423	of course although you kind of shut that out don't you if you're interest in something you have filter in your head
S0421	yeah
S0423	that filter that out
S0421	but sometimes i can't and i'm just like be quiet because like erm i could never read in like a noisy environment and i just i just can't and i'm just like i need silence please stop talk
S0423	yeah i think i could filter it out cos i use to take book on things like when you're travel on train and
S0421	i find that
S0423	er
S0421	quite hard
S0423	on the tube and
S0421	i just like silence
S0423	you you know if you get immerse in a book it everything just fade into the background
S0421	silence be good silence be golden
S0423	well it's good that you can manage to enjoy silence most people hate it don't they
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	noise in the background
S0421	most people be like i need noise yeah
S0423	yeah
S0421	and i'm just like mm although i do like occasionally nature sound in the background do you like nature sound have i tell you i like nature sound
S0423	what on a cd or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh right i i i i like when it's when nature be natural
S0423	i'm not quite sure i could sit and listen to it not part of what it's
S0421	like like you can get on youtube ten hours of rain noise and it's just ten hours of rain or like ten hours of forest sound ten hours of like it's usually
S0423	why ten hours
S0421	it's usually ten hours so you can just have it
S0423	oh
S0421	go on like for a long
S0423	be a bite odd on a sunny day outside
S0423	and you just listen to like
S0421	i know i do i don't know
S0423	do you put the rain
S0421	yeah
S0423	on do you
S0421	it's good or something like a stream with like bird
S0423	mm
S0421	that's good as well it's a bite of white noise
S0423	mm oh right
S0421	it's good it's like
S0421	it's like relaxation or like focus be either one if you need to focus on something
S0423	yeah i suppose people who who want to they find it relax the sound of run water and things
S0421	yeah
S0423	don't they cos it's suppose to be that's fair enough
S0421	because sometimes like even classical music it's like you get a bite involve with it so
S0423	mm
S0421	like just rain water or something be be good
S0423	yeah
