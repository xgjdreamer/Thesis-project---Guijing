S0120	yeah
S0058	i actually really need to do a corpus newsletter slightly more sort of relate it's one of the things that be take a back seat for the time be but i really should send one out we're like our new quarterly newsletter six months ago never mind unforeseen circumstances
S0120	yes whereas i'm the only nobody in p n have have send out a bulletin since before this summer
S0058	fair enough
S0120	so em
S0058	i'm assume there wasn't the promise of future ones it be just here be a newsletter be grateful
S0120	em i'm not sure i'm not sure em the london professional network use to be quite organise and active
S0058	mm
S0120	and have a regular one but
S0058	right
S0120	i think the leadership might have change and
S0058	mm
S0120	the previous the previous guy be eh a proper high flyer he be the one who really get huge number of huge quantities of events go
S0058	right
S0120	lot of people involve he be one of the em em ice president's apprentice a couple of years ago
S0058	right so he
S0120	he be kind of big on the
S0058	mm
S0120	well it's yeah it's quite a quite a substantial award
S0058	yeah
S0120	em for a graduate and i think he win the win the new civil engineer graduate award one year
S0058	shit wow
S0120	a proper high flyer
S0058	how do you win that like be it be that through your
S0120	by nominations i guess
S0058	through your company
S0120	i'm not sure i'm not sure
S0058	yeah seem or whether it's cos or whether it's kind of
S0120	i don't think it should be restrict to company really
S0058	well be it kinda through your organisation or be it through your university one you know
S0120	i don't know
S0058	kind of once you graduate this person will be awesome or yeah what's
S0120	em i don't know i think it's probably more a matter of just anyone can nominate someone
S0058	mm fair enough
S0120	cos this year this year another ewb person em get a em a commendation in the graduate award
S0058	mm
S0120	didn't she wasn't an official runner up you know there be a couple of official runners up and there be a winner and then there be a few
S0058	mm
S0120	highly commend
S0058	that's pretty good
S0120	why be why do camo jacket so often have german flag on
S0058	i don't know i've notice that actually
S0120	use to have
S0058	of course yes he do that's possibly why
S0120	mm i guess cos until like a i think it be until last year em last year the em em national service be em
S0058	mm
S0120	be rescind in germany
S0058	be it only last year
S0120	yeah
S0058	mm right
S0120	hardly hear anything about it i just eh kinda find out at one point when i be in a bite of a wiki quest for something
S0058	right yeah there wasn't much of a fanfare about it it be quite a so so what happen now have have they just completely stop or be there kind of be it just a bite more relax or
S0120	i think
S0058	it be already quite relax though wasn't it
S0120	no i think it's just now
S0058	just you just don't have to do it
S0120	the same it's the same for everyone as it use to be for women optional
S0058	well that make sense mm
S0120	yeah
S0058	oh i hadn't actually think about that the fact that what do they do about the women
S0120	so i mean the majority of people would do zivildienst anyway
S0058	would do what sorry
S0120	zivildienst
S0058	civil
S0120	so if you'd send them a letter say you know i'm a pacifist and i do not want to do this
S0058	mm
S0120	lot of people aren't necessarily pacifists but do
S0058	but don't want to it
S0120	don't want to do it
S0058	fair enough
S0120	em em but then you em can do your national service as em well social work
S0058	yeah
S0120	kind of thing em which i think would be a really good thing
S0058	i be just about to say that would really make a lot of sense cos it would mean that everyone have something to do and everyone would have some kind of positive experience
S0120	mm
S0058	you know and you could do you know whatever suit you better and yeah they could really get quite a lot out of that it seem to make sense
S0120	if civil service didn't already mean something else in english
S0058	mm
S0120	then it'd be a good eh good name
S0058	yes indeed
S0120	if we could come up with a good name for it
S0058	mm
S0120	it would be good
S0058	i'm not sure any politician would really be eh make a big deal about it unfortunately i don't think he'd be very popular kid like lie around and not be make to do anything
S0120	mm isn't eh cameron keen on this national citizen service national citizens scheme
S0058	true yeah
S0120	which be i don't know i i haven't look into it
S0058	you could maybe write to him and
S0120	mm
S0058	you write to him hi cameron i hate you redeem yourself
S0120	yeah you've use
S0058	yeah
S0120	speak of em conservative eh cabinet members
S0058	mm
S0120	i saw one yesterday
S0058	really
S0120	the secretary of state for international development
S0058	mm very excite oh yes and he give a talk didn't he
S0120	he be give a talk
S0058	or do you just see him wander around yeah how be it
S0120	well i suppose i could have accost him afterwards he be just stand outside but em i don't know it be pretty bog standard keynote speech material really
S0058	right
S0120	because majority of the audience be students who have be to the em alternative career fair that day
S0058	mm alright okay
S0120	em so more what he be do be em try to encourage people to into international development job
S0058	mm so if you're already in
S0120	and more specifically em the new dfid graduate scheme
S0058	okay
S0120	em which sound all sound pretty good actually
S0058	mm okay
S0120	he wasn't he wasn't all he wasn't at all political about it anything really which i guess be eh be intentional
S0058	yeah
S0120	otherwise they just
S0058	it be sensible
S0120	otherwise all of the em the non conservatives would be like nope okay i'm not gonna not gonna do that job
S0058	yeah yeah it seem a bite em not really the right way to go if you're try to encourage eh
S0120	he even say he even praise claire short
S0058	fair enough
S0120	shock
S0058	yeah
S0120	although i think he do use the eh he do use the word even though she be a member of the labour party
S0058	oh well
S0120	and there be some
S0058	of course he didn't get his wrong
S0120	there be some moments in his talk when it be quite clear he be use stock kind of phrase
S0058	mm
S0120	that the pr department have come up with like em
S0058	right
S0120	talk about the the disengagement of aid with india em
S0058	yeah
S0120	which be apparently go on at the moment em dfid be cut cut fund towards india which be
S0058	right on the basis that they're
S0120	on the basis that they're a giant country yes they have they they do have forty percent of the world's poor people
S0058	but they have
S0120	but they have massive resources
S0058	yeah
S0120	they be a big capable
S0058	yeah
S0120	em country with a with a vast expand economy and all that
S0058	mm yeah
S0120	so actually i agree with that it be
S0058	yeah
S0120	it be
S0058	it mean the people who need it can get it rather than the people who really don't need it be get it
S0120	yeah em
S0058	okay so do he talk about that then
S0120	and a so that so his phrase he bring out a couple of time be em walk the last mile with india
S0058	blimey
S0120	but em no it be alright i don't hate him
S0058	oh that's good
S0120	i suppose i might if i actually hear him talk about any other kind of policies but
S0058	yeah
S0120	but
S0058	what if you hear him on a on a day when he's be clearly be tell no politics
S0120	mm
S0058	no labour bash

S0120	it's suppose to be get people appear on as you type
S0058	oh right
S0120	no it doesn't work
S0058	oh dear i be try to remember what make your phone be be san fransisco the make
S0120	orange no
S0058	yeah
S0120	it's mark as an orange from san francisco it's actually everywhere else except the uk it's a zte blade
S0058	right
S0120	zte be the company
S0058	okay cos 's get a new phone he be have a look and i be try to remember what you have and couldn't couldn't place it
S0120	well it's good
S0058	mm i think he's just gonna get one exactly the same as his old one cos he well he be think about an iphone but then he be like eh that's really expensive and i only want it to ring people on and yeah you've get an iphone and everyone's get iphones
S0120	sadly
S0058	so he's yeah he's gonna get one exactly the same as his other one resistant to change well you know it it well it the thing be it's break but it's have a fairly good innings cos it's a touch screen and the touch screen be break so you can't open texts em and you can only do things if they require press one of the hard one of the button em so yeah you can't open texts apart from that you know
S0120	mm
S0058	so it's the thing he's replace it if you replace this sort of fairly basic touch screen nokia every so often it's so cheap you can get an iphone be it be it not play
S0120	it's just em
S0058	yeah
S0120	there we go
S0058	oh my god
S0120	a fifteen foot snowman
S0058	i've see that before
S0120	i know
S0058	be she
S0120	's short but
S0058	be she friends with by any chance
S0120	what
S0058	one of the guy who build that she be she involve in the build of this or be this
S0120	em yes i think so
S0058	yeah in that case you might know who em it's em the girl who be the life save the president em it's her boyfriend who's at 's oh yes so he probably do know her and he's a fourth year engineer
S0120	oh
S0058	so they probably do actually know each other don't they
S0120	fair enough
S0058	that be a very very cool snowman cos it do put ours to shame it be quite it be pretty good cos we sort of walk em be it do we go to the gym or something on that day so it be kind of late afternoon on saturday em and there be like a gallery of of snowmen all the different style there be like really big round ones and ones with proper hat and there be someone who have do really some imaginative things with their arm and
S0120	i know of someone who do a eh snow dalek
S0058	a snow dalek that be really cool be the em arm make of snow or be that just like a stick with a snow ball on the end or something
S0120	i'm go to have to em check that out as well em i think i might be able to find it
S0058	there be really good
S0120	on twitter which work a lot better
S0058	yes it be a em a snow dog i think it be outside you know like the the one the build opposite i think it be there it have it have a really sort of detail face it be really good where be that i be drive in yeah next to its snowman owner i assume
S0120	sorry
S0058	next to its snowman owner unless it be a stray dog there it be a stray snow dog and eh just random
S0120	just run away
S0058	yeah a random snowman
S0120	eh
S0058	i wonder when it's go to end it be play havoc with all the the bulbs and stuff they be come up in december
S0120	mm yeah we've get some daffodils in our front garden which
S0058	oh i saw them yeah
S0120	which may or may not be alive i'll try and find the snow dalek
S0058	depend how hardy they be
S0120	i know nothing about horticulture
S0058	well my limit knowledge of daffodils and tulips be that they'll pretty much survive anything because my family kill plant and we have daffodils and tulips which come up every year regardless of anything em yeah and my dad regularly use to em for some reason best know to himself he use to do the garden em kind of you know before winter start and dig up all these things out the soil say oh i have to throw them out and me mam be like what they're my daffodil bulbs what be you do and every year he'd dig these things up i don't understand why
S0120	mm
S0058	so yeah i think they probably they they survive be dig up and replant every year nice
S0120	now let's see
S0058	the snow dalek rather than the snow tardis snow tardis would be good if you could get it so you could go in it but then it wouldn't really be a tardis cos it would be quite small inside
S0120	that's true
S0058	yeah
S0120	a a snow tardis would be quite difficult
S0058	so what to make it bigger on the inside
S0120	yeah
S0058	quite yeah fair enough quite tricky i still haven't see the end of last series i've see the like oh wow that's quite good
S0120	yeah
S0058	impressive so it hasn't get the arm but it's get
S0120	it's get something there
S0058	yeah it have yeah
S0120	i'm not sure
S0058	it's a spoon be it a spoon
S0120	mm
S0058	that's really good ah right if it snow again snow children's television character try to think of one snow cyberman's a bite bite difficult the only way i could think of do it be just to build a snowman and put one of those em cybermen helmets at the top
S0120	mm
S0058	you know the the voice change ones not quite the same
S0120	no
S0058	anyway what time be it be be it time for work oh not too bad
S0120	eh i need to clear out
S0058	well that's good
S0120	ow sod off right that's the eh pn pn national coordinator
S0058	oh for some reason i be picture a man there you be my prejudice come out there
S0120	the comms comms coordinator be a man
S0058	so weird and i be picture them as a woman that's interest
S0120	the eh uk financial coordinator fundraise coordinator be a woman
S0058	i picture them as a woman when you say it this be a good quiz
S0120	the new ah the new research what's the new post cos there's be restructure and now research and education be merge ah be that right research and education i think so and placements and bursaries be merge
S0058	right
S0120	no no i'm so confuse so i think research and bursaries be merge
S0058	right
S0120	to become the eh what be it the innovation hub yeah
S0058	right so so it's basically really innovative stuff come out of bursaries
S0120	i don't know anyway well no it's just em they kind of
S0058	or be it like
S0120	they kind of go together in that sense because bursary be there for people to apply people or branch to apply for fund for
S0058	right
S0120	project which might come out of their research project
S0058	ah fair enough
S0120	that kind of thing
S0058	so it really make sense to have that kind of
S0120	link up
S0058	yeah fair enough
S0120	em yeah anyway no that
S0058	so it's the innovations hub coordinator
S0120	now that that so the research guy no the placements guy's no the research guy's
S0058	huh
S0120	i don't know
S0058	so there's join there's there's people there's placements and bursaries and
S0120	yeah there be someone who i've get to send my my master report cut down to

S0120	yes
S0058	it take the ten minutes of sort out but it be quite i i've find that at 's it be quite hard sort of find a time when you want to wash stuff when nobody else want to wash stuff

S0120	ting ting ting ting and doug just come out his room
S0058	nice no word necessary dude stop the drizzle
S0120	so i have to very carefully mix it without the fork touch the edge of the
S0058	nice no no you need like a em a rubber spoon i be wonder if you could
S0120	i also need a grater i didn't have a grater
S0058	be that not your grater that i use all of last year
S0120	yeah
S0058	oh

S0058	well there will be pancakes probably disgust amount of pancakes so if you want to em come around and have pancakes see as you're miss the roast
S0120	what's what's it get to do with 's by the way
S0058	because i make last time i make pancakes be in 's and it be also the first time i ever make pancakes and i use your grater
S0120	ah do i even experience these pancakes
S0058	lois do i can't remember if you be there you possibly weren't aw in that case you've get to come for pancakes it actually work really well cos the em the first it's like the traditional thing the first one's always rubbish em but we do melt the we have a spatula we use it to turn them we melt it cos the pan be so hot the i sort of leave the spatula on the pan too long and it melt which just show how you need hot you need to get the fry pan but yeah it be awesome cif lemon lot of sugar or be you a chocolate spread pancake person
S0120	or jam
S0058	i've never have a jam pancake
S0120	or just a dust of sugar
S0058	yeah yeah sugar and lemon juice
S0120	or just sugar
S0058	just sugar yeah just sugar yeah
S0120	do work mm
S0058	yeah
S0120	or honey
S0058	yeah or maple syrup maple syrup that's good no
S0120	maybe i be just my the only time i've have maple syrup be on hall
S0058	mm
S0120	waffle
S0058	hall waffle aren't nice anyway
S0120	hall waffle be insane
S0058	they're not nice
S0120	and their pancakes aren't good either they're like they're like cardboard
S0058	you oculd roof your house with them but but pancakes vary quite a lot i use have them quite a lot
S0120	you could make you could make a eh you know have a machine gun post with it i think they work well as a sandbag type
S0058	what the waffle
S0120	no the eh the pancake
S0058	the pancakes
S0120	they're just kind of there and flop
S0058	yeah they be they be quite floppy
S0120	they don't taste good
S0058	well i i some of them it be awful when they cook them or heat them for too long and the outside be really hard and the inside be just sort of you know sort of still quite floppy and yeah it wasn't nice
S0120	mm
S0058	i use to have them quite a lot though i think i just really like maple syrup and the porridge wasn't good enough to have maple syrup on it be a degradation to the maple syrup
S0120	i think i might have make pancakes at some point last year i make a ridiculous quantity and paul and i eat them in front of a film
S0058	all of them
S0120	all of them
S0058	oh so you make them and then keep them
S0120	i just stick them on a plate
S0058	fair enough they they i be fry them and they be get eat as fast as i could fry them but that's yeah you you could get a stack and then roll them as you go mm
S0120	mm
S0058	but anyway yes em
S0120	heat a plate
S0058	oh yeah
S0120	help to keep them warm i don't know
S0058	but the there wasn't really a pancake theme film you could watch with them desperately try to think of pancake theme film there isn't really a film set in february either or a nondescript i don't
S0120	you know what you know what e four's play on wednesday snake on a plane
S0058	oh nice that's not a film that's a description that's a plot synopsis oh yeah do i tell you about my em my illness so i've be diagnose
S0120	what
S0058	the the name of the condition be sport induce wheeze that's not a medical condition that's a description yeah so after like i'd i'd do really sort of cardio i get really i sound like i smoke twenty a day i'm sort of cough and wheeze and when i laugh it i do sound like an old woman who's smoke twenty a day for her entire life em so i go to the doctor i be like yeah
S0120	what really
S0058	yeah well you've never possibly never be round after i've do an insane cardio
S0120	you just never laugh around me
S0058	i just never laugh yeah em it's not just the laugh it's the the fact when i breathe in i go
S0120	well you need to hear 's laugh it could be worse
S0058	mm
S0120	no i can't i can't even do it
S0058	you live with yeah nice no no yeah so i go to the doctor i be a bite like good bad
S0120	it's like a donkey or something
S0058	nice i think you have mention that before yeah and then she be like yeah no worry perfectly normal i'll give you an inhaler if you want i be like alright and she be like don't worry she's like if you're wheeze probably stop exercise apart from that you know it never happen during it's always an hour afterwards but yeah i've get my inhaler
S0120	so what do it what what do you inhale
S0058	what do you inhale it's just a look like a normal asthma inhaler it probably be a normal asthma inhaler but she be like it's not asthma you just get a bite wheezy i'm not massively convince by this diagnosis to be honest
S0120	i'm just intrigue what the stuff in the inhaler be
S0058	in salbutamol
S0120	okay that that mean nothing to me i don't know why i ask cos i wouldn't understand the answer
S0058	yes it look i think it be just a normal asthma inhaler it's probably the same stuff it's just to stop you to clear the wheeze i haven't use it
S0120	you just eh now remind me of a particular a very sweet scene in eh in eh big bang theory
S0058	yeah
S0120	not not friends not friends big bang theory

S0120	no they they do like test how much your lungs have be destroy
S0058	alright
S0120	your lung capacity

S0058	they don't cost anything
S0120	alright
S0058	it need load dong to it though it be quite cheap
S0120	mott's doesn't have a sunderland office
S0058	not so much
S0120	that's the thing
S0058	have it get it hasn't get anything aberdeen's the nearest probably
S0120	it's annoy when you like the place where the house price be
S0058	yes
S0058	that the thing i yeah i've move from somewhere which have great house price to cambridge
S0120	mm
S0058	second to london and harpenden i i don't even know it might not be that expensive in the scheme of things but it's expensive do i tell you we em sort of look in the window of a news agency to sort of see how much house in newnham cost and it be like three hundred grand for a very old
S0120	yeah it's a nice corner of the city
S0058	yeah
S0120	it's the it fair to say it's the only nice corner of the city
S0058	apart from and like the colleges so yeah make sense really but goldmine i guess if you can get one
S0120	mm
S0058	i guess if you can get one it's eh worth the money but yeah you gotta have the money to start with
S0120	i don't know be it
S0058	well cos then yeah cos you'd be able to
S0120	it's worth it if you rent it out
S0058	well yes if you because you can charge quite a lot per room which yeah would probably quite nicely cover it
S0120	but em
S0058	but i don't know
S0120	actually you know em i be look and there there be two two flats list in in anglia ruskin i think but i think anglia ruskin
S0058	so what in the student bits
S0120	well basically basically student student flats
S0058	mm
S0120	em be list for sale you know to the
S0058	alright okay
S0120	for a landlord to let
S0058	yeah
S0120	and you save you know i don't know it be like a hundred thousand and a bite per house it be extortionate price
S0058	god
S0120	i don't know but then again it comment it be currently be let for you know
S0058	mm
S0120	i can't remember how much but quite a lot per week per month
S0058	a flat six hundred
S0120	well it's like a bedsit
S0058	a bedsit five yeah five or six hundred probably
S0120	yeah and that's like
S0058	which'll pay your mortgage
S0120	yeah
S0058	yeah no i
S0120	i think why don't i do that
S0058	make the money you mean or live there
S0120	make the money
S0058	oh so you've get you've gotta yeah well yeah
S0120	it's cost neutral
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0120	this mean your capital be sit there unuseable
S0058	yeah but i don't know yeah it's an interest people normally only do that once they've get one the they build up their portfolio
S0120	yeah
S0058	no it's an interest alternative approach
S0120	why wouldn't you start with it why wouldn't you start with it
S0058	i think people just don't generally
S0120	cos you want someone to live yourself
