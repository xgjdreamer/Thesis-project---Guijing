S0198	it would be a nightmare how do you get it home again

S0198	i suppose if have a car but don't have a car
S0192	most people have be live in england so they have lot of stuff
S0198	yeah
S0192	we're not those people
S0198	it's true a lot of assumption go on there
S0192	people accumulate a lot don't they nice afternoon beer we haven't get into study mode yet

S0192	we've get three weeks for our study

S0198	sunday obviously we're still just go to be sort stuff out

S0198	i don't know it's just rubbish isn't it er sunday we'll still be sort stuff out so monday that's the day really
S0192	monday will be our first proper
S0198	wake up
S0192	try and do a bite of study
S0198	study study
S0192	oh don't knock that bike over
S0198	too small be it big enough for us to both sit on
S0192	i be gonna sit on the windowsill
S0198	alright i'll sit here then yeah can you get out there
S0192	yeah i think so oh you do feel you're on view
S0198	yeah
S0192	on show
S0198	i might this a little bite more comfortable
S0192	but you're also definitely outside
S0198	yeah which be a nice thing isn't it
S0192	yeah which be good
S0198	yeah
S0192	erm you might want to put that on something there's a little book to put it on here
S0198	i can see erm why the neighbour partition it a little i suppose cos erm just give a slight add sense that that's part you know part own do you know what i mean rather than
S0192	but be it part own
S0198	i don't know
S0192	that's directional by the way so
S0198	okay well yeah i suppose we don't
S0192	i think it's our balcony
S0198	maybe they just want the privacy of a
S0192	i mean most likely they didn't do it and it's be there for age
S0198	yeah that's true well if the landlady own the whole build she may have do it herself just so the people on that side can't claim that
S0192	mm
S0198	none of the others be like it be they
S0192	no none of them really
S0198	either you have it or you don't basically
S0192	yeah
S0198	i imagine it cause some dispute or ideally you own both room
S0192	yeah i mean if you have both both side that would be nice
S0198	so it would be nice if this if this be
S0192	that person might they've get pot plant on both side
S0198	yeah i feel like they have
S0192	if we start use their windowsill would they be alright with that
S0198	no i don't think so i reckon they do own both of the it's like another flat
S0192	we saw the guy that live there though and he didn't look too normal be we both have a cigarette
S0198	yeah i'll roll one as well
S0192	yeah mm
S0198	oh the sun's on that side this time of the day isn't it
S0192	yeah it be
S0198	it's shin on the back of the build
S0192	i don't think we ever get the sun here on the or
S0198	yeah no that's fine
S0192	you'd dry clothe up here pretty quick
S0198	yeah that's true
S0192	if you just put a hobbyhorse on this balcony
S0198	yeah
S0192	you need a small enough hobbyhorse
S0198	you don't want to you'd want erm peg though because you don't want them to actually blow off
S0192	i mean they shouldn't blow over this rail er
S0198	it get pretty windy here but yeah i guess not
S0192	no i'm gonna direct it this way cos i talk louder then maybe i
S0198	erm well i feel like er i feel like if you just rig something or just stand if you stand a hobbyhorse in the kitchen with the kitchen window open it would dry really fast
S0192	oh i mean that would dry really quickly and there's the sun
S0198	the sun on that side as well
S0192	the natural sun on that side as well
S0198	i feel like we could do i'm gonna try and get one in dorset cos i don't really wanna carry one up the hill here
S0192	what a hobbyhorse
S0198	if i can get a cheap or a cheaper one at a boot fair i'll get one in dorset if not that shop sell them for twelve ninety nine
S0192	yeah
S0198	cos we be gonna
S0192	which shop
S0198	cos i don't know where we're gonna have a a rope up constantly
S0192	which shop sell them for twelve ninety nine
S0198	er what shop be it robert dyer i think the one we
S0192	a dyas or whatever it be
S0198	yeah robert dyas dyas or whatever it's call the one we first go into to get erm curtain hook
S0192	hook yeah oh we'll have to go back there and have a look then
S0198	yeah
S0192	mm it's a nice tree it's gently slop down
S0198	yeah
S0192	i can see hill in the distance over there
S0198	there be hill around there
S0192	you can see in the far distant erm apart from the crazy neighbour earlier
S0198	she seem
S0192	i'm not sure what that be all about
S0198	you didn't like her do you definitely be a
S0192	well she be slag off the neighbour wasn't she
S0198	yeah criticise people but i felt like i don't know i don't know what i think she be talk about
S0192	because people sit out on their balconies shouldn't be nosy it should be see as be neighbourhoody
S0198	neighbourhoody yeah
S0192	like community
S0198	well it's the point of people live in isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0198	become for on show part of the the vibe around here isn't it
S0192	see these ones all have conversions those ones have conversions on both windows can you see
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's get those two front windows but this have only get one and so do that one
S0198	yeah so that house have be more divide than this one then
S0192	yeah it have you don't get too much traffic over here which be nice it's not like a constant road like with cars drive past
S0198	no yeah
S0192	because you could easily live on a busy road
S0198	yeah you could which would be weird see people in traffic go by all the time
S0192	yeah mm you're definitely a bite on show here but you're bind to be it's
S0198	it look better now there's curtain hang up a reckon
S0192	it do
S0198	well just from the outside as you say it's a clear indication that the it's not vacant
S0192	yeah somebody's there
S0198	quite a few people don't bother with net some people do
S0192	and they've get net i guess over there now
S0198	that's another thing you can do which sometimes people do just have it around the bottom section and not round the top for privacy
S0192	where's that oh yeah
S0198	the house on i mean they have blind as well but
S0192	how do we get all that instal that be hook and rope and like
S0198	yeah
S0192	hook and elastic chord or whatever it be
S0198	it's just a little bite of hook though isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0198	that might hold it more
S0192	i i mean my mum say she'd spend up to fifty quid so if there's things we need at that point we just say yeah it would be nice to have some drape
S0198	so
S0192	so people
S0198	the shelve might be still in need at that point
S0192	pardon me
S0198	so you don't need a pub garden on a day like today
S0192	no you don't this be our pub
S0198	mm it be
S0192	cheer to the new house
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	it's like and
S0198	then there's
S0192	how many others do we know
S0192	that be it
S0198	yeah it it be
S0198	yeah so
S0192	er above below
S0198	in the middle
S0192	in the centre
S0192	and down
S0198	oh down
S0192	and in yeah
S0198	yeah mm above below yeah
S0192	roll off the tongue nicely
S0198	do you miss latin america
S0192	no i do we'll go back
S0198	i know that be a good trip
S0192	not many people get to take a year out and travel there
S0198	no
S0192	i think people be might be a bite envious if we do another year in africa or something
S0198	mm
S0192	i don't see why we can't do another year it would be good to travel for at least one more year
S0198	yeah
S0192	just get to raise the money want to chuck us the lighter
S0198	parent have get a year to get use to the idea of us go to saudi or the middle east
S0192	yeah
S0198	and then
S0192	cos we we might be potentially work there for a while
S0198	wouldn't rule out turkey still if a good position come up just to still have a
S0192	they're two years in those contract now aren't they
S0198	they're all of them two years i mean you don't even really wanna work at anyway
S0192	i'd only wanna work at like a uni or an equitable uni i've see quite a few job there that pay quite considerable less
S0198	less typical esl position
S0192	and again especially if we're go to go and visit them
S0198	yeah once our internet's up and run i'm gonna give them a call
S0192	if we've get the money we should definitely try and go
S0198	yeah we should i agree cos er it's just a good trip to do
S0192	mm
S0198	and also especially if by that point 's back out on her boat
S0192	mm
S0198	which she might she may or may not be by she should be by the end of july
S0192	depend when we go i guess if we go in august or something i mean we can always
S0198	i imagine the flight might be a bite cheaper in july
S0192	we can always do a erm summer programme somewhere to earn some quick hard cash
S0198	yeah that's true they kick off you could do that first two weeks of july and then leave
S0192	it depend how your dissertation
S0198	yeah it really do depend on the dissertation er like i go out with and and her sister have just finish her dissertation that day but she hadn't edit yet it have to be in this friday but she'd like she'd get to her she felt pretty comfortable with it
S0192	what be it on
S0198	give herself i didn't actually ask give herself a week to edit it yeah i didn't ask her
S0192	you girls ask different question don't you so
S0198	yeah we do we
S0198	we jump about topics so frequently
S0192	mm
S0198	it's incredible but i mean conversation go that way doesn't it
S0192	yeah it really do
S0198	one thing remind you of something else but you know
S0192	there be a module on discourse analysis i think in the second semester
S0198	yeah there's a there's a consideration towards that but i think i like i don't know
S0192	psycho linguistic
S0198	i think i like the like learn the core aspects of it but not necessarily go too deep into the the serious side of it or whatever
S0192	so much
S0198	but maybe i don't know
S0192	cos that's more my cup of tea it's not bad if we take different modules be it
S0198	no no
S0192	be if we specialist slightly differently
S0198	there will be of all the esl students well anyway imagine second language acquisition be gonna be busy
S0192	yeah there might be quite a few people in there i imagine it'll be mandatory
S0198	mm i'm hop that doesn't open it up to change time or anything
S0192	no i wonder if they're set now
S0198	mm
S0192	i mean they've get to be set right i guess they could get a different class
S0198	do say as well within the first like few weeks you can change your modules
S0192	you can
S0198	so it's not a big deal she say you can but maybe she say after the first week
S0192	so we have like a drop period
S0198	kind of i suppose i'm sure we do in bath spa i don't know i can't remember
S0192	i mean i get on some other modules
S0198	yeah
S0192	end up do those english modules
S0198	i know in the very very first week i do i take a class in history and i didn't have a i just be so what i didn't know what she be talk about
S0198	i can't remember what the module be which be random for an undergrad module i just remember think this be too hectic
S0192	no i don't wanna do this
S0198	i know
S0192	certainly in your first year
S0198	change it to something else like yeah it be in the first semester
S0192	i just do like the history of one o one and one o two pretty much
S0198	pretty much yeah
S0192	the first year
S0198	the american equivalents
S0192	theory of drama theory dramaturging no
S0198	first first of do get plenty of seagulls around here
S0192	yeah
S0198	it's cos the sea's just down the hill
S0192	it's not far be it
S0198	we might get family there actually come and visit
S0192	i mean if there's one place that they might come and visit it would probably be wouldn't it
S0198	might bring up on the train that's if he ever have the money
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's crazy it's
S0198	he would like to
S0192	faster for your parent to drive up to the m25 than it be to just drive across
S0198	across yeah it's not they don't he they're not on the m twenty they're on the m23 longer than the m25
S0192	yeah you're only a small portion of it
S0198	yeah it be a small potion
S0192	well that's the
S0198	but it's quicker go the motorway way
S0192	they have to take quite a big portion
S0198	then go through the only thing be say it's just the only problem be it be quicker but it's touch and go because it only take one accident on the motorway
S0192	yeah
S0198	and then it's build up it's like and then you're two hours later
S0192	yeah
S0198	whereas if you go the other way it's just all a roads and whatever and you can if there's an accident you just go through a different you go through the town a little bite more
S0192	yeah yeah it's alright not a problem
S0198	so so it depend on the risk cos he have to he's have to travel quite a bite for work
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	he go up to erm yeah like i think do he say to you he be say to you he's go up as far as er milton keynes and that kind of area
S0192	have yeah

S0192	i think it be warmer
S0198	behind the cloud now

S0192	it's very changeable isn't it that's it
S0198	mm
S0192	it just go all over the place

S0198	that's good so they can't come around and be like what have you do you leave this on
S0192	no it say it here bedroom door ceiling wall skirt floor heat windows heavy mildew surround edge of glass pan at edge of glass pan heavily paint and scratch mark both sash chord in place but paint mark tarnish to brass fittings cable protrude to bottom leave yellow stain so so they're definitely erm
S0198	how about the cleanliness of the window be they not comment on that
S0192	doesn't really say no
S0198	no well
S0192	just say heavy mildew surround edge of glass pan i mean if we're gonna take some photos i mean er and talk about it
S0198	well they have take photos it's in the back
S0192	it do say only one door shelf present to the fridge usage be mark yellow and discolouration
S0198	oh really
S0192	yeah which then i mean it's the number of smoke alarm
S0198	so if they just if we just accept it as it be and the landlord won't actually because where do you get a shelf from for a fridge
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0198	those children
S0192	do we shut the window
S0198	yeah that's probably a good idea
S0192	we can leave the other window open
S0198	because it's just ridiculous isn't it
S0192	it's very noisy
S0198	as you say in the winter they shouldn't be out there should they
S0192	they shouldn't be out there no oh they do have picture they've get picture of the electrics why do we have four different electrics
S0198	what be they picture from
S0192	these picture be rubbish anyway
S0198	what be that even of where be that
S0192	it's the electric wherever that be there's four different ones they've get a read here rate one rate two rate three rate four electricity
S0198	well where be our electricity meter
S0192	i don't know
S0198	be that downstairs in that cupboard
S0192	should in they've take a picture of the fridge
S0198	oh good look the stave
S0192	the stave top
S0198	good
S0192	it's not very clear though oh well you can see he's get his build tool in here whenever they do that that be the day before
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	oh he's get a whole
S0198	things very patch up there
S0192	table up here didn't do a very good job of that though do he
S0198	no they didn't and they fix one little bite basically
S0192	mm
S0198	and no picture of how dirty the windows be that must be cos that's like a you know if it's a stupid thing or not
S0192	yeah well i'll agree with them anyway
S0198	yeah
S0192	and disagree where be necessary we've get to go round and do that thoroughly then soon
S0198	yeah maybe all the mark and stuff
S0192	yeah
S0198	feel like it could happen easily and be that be that more mark or be that just where it's
S0192	just dirt or just wear wear and tear
S0198	scuff on that as well
S0192	absolutely no idea look a bite like that
S0198	cos i don't know yeah we definitely need to check carpet cos they charge you a fortune to clean a carpet
S0192	yeah i know it's ridiculous
S0198	like three hundred pound for a professional carpet cleaner on this carpet and the carpet didn't cost that much i doubt
S0192	no it didn't
S0198	for this cheap bite of rug
S0192	do you wanna move those speakers over there and see if they work
S0198	yeah okay what attach it to there
S0192	if we plug it up use a laptop or something
S0198	laptop maybe we can get some music
S0192	don't even need to have a laptop go really just a er mp3 player or anything
S0198	mp3 player yeah that's true anything that'll plug into it
S0192	alright if i rest this keyboard
S0198	be they wire up now the speakers then
S0192	not quite no just move them over there and then erm i'll wire them
S0198	no but you have one you have to stick it to the back
S0192	not both of them i don't think maybe one of them i'm not sure
S0198	oh alright then
S0192	i've get a good old cable go on here so
S0198	so this one this one isn't attach okay
S0192	it be just from poundland this cable though wasn't it
S0198	no yeah it be but i mean it's just a basic jack lead isn't it
S0192	yeah you don't need much else
S0198	doesn't have to be too technical
S0192	so this be and move this over
S0198	don't know where this one be attach
S0192	do you want to carry that
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah one of them i attach we're go to have some permanent music set up
S0198	absolutely
S0192	in here
S0198	and something probably er don't need to plug it in yet do we
S0192	if you just get an mp3 player
S0198	just to make sure it work and put this away
S0192	yeah so
S0198	so you can charge your your mp player via this as well you don't need to i mean you can do it on your computer obviously do that have
S0192	oh do that work for both of them
S0198	it work for a plug socket yeah just anything that's a samsung device will use the same connector
S0192	alright do you wanna grab an mp3 player
S0198	yeah put it on here
S0192	alright we should have some sound minimum maximum some speakers
S0198	get some music go then
S0192	where's the mp3 player where's that little cable as well
S0198	you throw it as it's it's between your feet
S0192	it's get a plug here
S0198	for some reason
S0192	right this whole
S0198	now these speakers haven't be use for about six years
S0192	where do this i always struggle to formulate again use
S0192	yeah this one go
S0198	that's a good
S0192	here
S0198	that's good news
S0192	yeah
S0198	obviously not the volume too loud at first
S0192	no get to choose an artist just whoever or whatever come up first
S0198	the power's on so that's the half promise
S0192	hopefully it'll work
S0198	that's promise
S0192	can't be sure though we need to check both speakers
S0198	oh they're work they're both work
S0192	be they both work
S0198	yeah
S0192	see if it's
S0198	that's fine isn't it
S0192	it's not very loud or
S0198	i mean you can go louder but yeah
S0192	it's erm it work
S0198	it's some speakers isn't it
S0192	we'll just make
S0198	we just need to clean them up
S0192	so therefore that
S0198	and once they're hook up to the i mean we can't have music too loud here anyway
S0192	no
S0198	we've get all kinds of neighbour that we have to think about
S0192	we've get some sound there so that's good so hopefully they won't pop round anymore
S0198	no
S0192	at least we won't have people round
S0198	he be go to post it through the door weren't they
S0192	yeah
S0198	bite lazy in the car unless he's do a few round which i hope he be
S0192	yeah
S0198	to kind of do it on their way out to do something
S0192	he's only just round the corner isn't he
S0198	yeah
S0192	i wonder how many properties you can have round here
S0198	i know probably a few
S0192	shall i make another rollie
S0198	there's a yeah there's a couple down the road that have get the young the er outside of their apartments so
S0192	there be
S0198	erm
S0192	that's useful shall i just make one of my list
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah erm
S0198	just need to get and this will see what your dad bring up see how that because i mean we're gonna he's gonna have a bite of stuff i think i think we're probably gonna want as least another bookshelf or something erm to put some book to like to make it tidier basically
S0192	no definitely
S0198	yeah
S0192	what
S0198	erm
S0192	on top of what we're get
S0198	yeah i think so
S0192	so we need to buy one i mean maybe argos have a cheap bookshelf or something
S0198	it probably do
S0192	write it down here
S0198	should have probably grab at argos catalogue while we be there
S0192	oh be they free
S0198	i think so i don't even know if they even do you remember you'd be able to go in and there'd be a pile of them but
S0192	be argos
S0198	everything's online now isn't it
S0192	yeah be it the cheapest of place until we get the internet we're in a bite of limbo really and until you get back form dorset
S0198	yeah
S0192	typical you go to dorset just after we move in
S0198	i know sorry darling
S0192	it's rubbish
S0198	it's the one time of the year there's the bloody steam fair
S0192	i'm sure that's important the steam fair
S0198	well my dad's pretty excite about it they would have be pretty gutted if i couldn't have go
S0192	they don't seem bother that i can't go then
S0198	no i mean my mum be would have quite like it of course she do she's like she's a bite more like your mum i suppose they'll hopefully get to spend some time with with you as well as me this year i suppose
S0192	yeah if possible
S0198	just to build a relationship or whatever
S0192	my mum want you up for christmas if that's possible
S0198	but erm yeah obviously i'll come up maybe the week before christmas
S0192	yeah or the week after
S0198	and then or the week afterwards christmas day box day christmas eve they're
S0192	for your family
S0198	they're a no go
S0192	no of course i'm not expect you to come
S0198	but no yeah no
S0192	i don't think they're expect you to come up either erm bear in mind that i've get two families as well
S0198	where be you go be it your mum's for christmas
S0192	yeah i can't really
S0198	just for sentimental that that's
S0192	yeah i can't really disappoint my mum too much by not go to hers
S0198	mm i think she'd be a bite upset
S0192	i'll probably have to
S0198	why isn't any we don't have any like piece of er cable attachments for cameras that we don't use that we can string across that that erm oh it's all attach isn't it
S0192	yeah i don't think they're thin enough or long enough
S0198	that we can put through the
S0192	that cable we just buy would've work
S0198	what about this to hang across the thing to attach the curtain rail net to
S0192	that's much too thick to go through a curtain
S0198	oh right to actually go through the curtain er no it wouldn't go through the curtain the curtain would still have to have something to hook it to hook onto this
S0192	but if you've just get one piece of rope that go through the curtain
S0198	this would just be the wire
S0192	be it possible to go through the curtain be there like a
S0198	i don't know i'll have a look
S0192	have a closer look
S0198	they're big old curtain
S0192	if you be to get just a piece of rope of a piece of string would it go through
S0198	no
S0192	no
S0198	no the curtain need to attach to something everything's er
S0192	those little bits for the thing
S0198	it it's not horizontal it's long width ways
S0192	we'll figure something out i need to see what my dad's get maybe the curtain that he's get be different
S0198	slightly different
S0192	i didn't look at anything too closely before so i should do that
S0198	i think they do yeah but then i guess the wire need to what we just need like you say be a little piece of wood that go along there basically a little bannister that's so little that it hook into those hook
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah don't know if that make any sense
S0192	i'm not gonna sleep in there until we get something sort cos it's too bright and i'll see what it's like with the curtain close tonight
S0198	yeah
S0192	but i can't see it'll be
S0198	well not with that other door expose
S0192	no it's pretty bright with the street lamp just there
S0198	yeah
S0192	you need like blackout curtain you need something thick blind would definitely help can we shut that door if we're gonna smoke inside
S0198	yeah i suppose we should we've still get a window open in here though haven't we to air it
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah it'll be fine
S0192	if we just sit at the back window
S0198	yeah sun's go in now anyway
S0192	it have
S0198	more or less
S0192	of course it be it's england it's fleet and
S0198	i know doesn't last long
S0192	won't last you long
S0198	enjoy it whilst it last
S0192	be we gonna prepare the chilli con carne after
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	i mean yeah it doesn't we can just get it on can't we see how that beef mince be
S0192	can i borrow your glass
S0198	it's probably not as erm they're in the bathroom
S0192	it's twenty percent fat so it's not too bad
S0198	be this be this too
S0192	no no that'll be fine
S0198	too big
S0192	that'll be fine
S0198	erm it's certainly cheaper than the mince we be buy that's five hundred grams for two pound
S0192	that's pretty good isn't it
S0198	that's really good
S0192	it's like the same as it be in lidl's
S0198	i think like we'll be get our beef from there from now on regardless of quality still probably a step up from expat marts like beef
S0192	yeah i think so
S0198	i mean that be a bite on the one side wasn't it
S0192	gonna finish this beer for first

S0192	pop in yeah
S0198	save myself the credit thank that's a point where
S0192	pretty pretty close

S0192	no i'll after do twelve hours
S0198	and she's tire and she's just try to do her best to function
S0192	i'd say she hasn't be use to work but she's be do a lot for them well she as do a lot for your nan
S0198	yeah that yeah
S0192	and for the grandchildren
S0198	if only she could get pay to do that
S0192	yeah definitely wouldn't be a bad job would it
S0198	she can't
S0192	she be be pay for your nan though wasn't she
S0198	yeah about fifty pound a week
S0192	mm it's not a wage
S0198	not a wage no
S0192	no
S0198	but you also get she also get additional help in other ways through other benefit and things to be a for be a carer
S0192	so there be benefit to it
S0198	wasn't major though but now that
S0192	she's
S0198	she's earn more money now like she like the other month she's like get eight hundred pound and she's like you know that's what's incredibly useful that's a massive boost to my monthly income
S0192	yeah it really be to not have that and then to have it
S0198	yeah
S0192	fifty quid a week be only two hundred quid so
S0198	mm
S0192	she know the difference
S0198	so she need to keep work
S0192	be that after tax that then
S0198	i think so
S0192	yeah sound about right if she get about a grand
S0198	yeah and she's not full time but she keep do all this full time hours
S0192	my mum's on that contract
S0198	oh be she like
S0192	so you know like in in america where they
S0198	oh yeah there's no
S0192	that's mine
S0198	oh sorry
S0192	where they erm they keep them on part time job form
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	like i'm one hour away from be full time so they don't give me
S0198	we do the same
S0192	yeah
S0198	and my brother doesn't get any sick leave full time job no sick pay
S0192	what a joke
S0198	specsavers retract it because too many people take liberties
S0192	well you would never take
S0198	so he doesn't actually get sick pay
S0192	oh that isn't good
S0198	say i think that's illegal in england isn't it
S0192	what do he say
S0198	don't know apparently not they're not gonna be break that law
S0192	it's perfectly fine
S0198	so he say he go in once and he be clearly so ill that they send him home but like the last week he have a flu type thing like he say he be really ill but he still go to work still kind of go through it and i say that's great so now that everyone you come in contact with for a week be go to go home and get sick
S0192	yeah have get the flu
S0198	because your company won't pay for you to have a day off work
S0192	it's ridiculous
S0198	it's terrible
S0192	stuff just seem to be get tighter and tighter doesn't it job don't seem to be get better
S0198	no
S0192	they seem to be cut back on everything after the recession there be like you know
S0198	like the
S0192	want a job in a hotel need to speak three languages
S0198	yeah
S0192	have a degree in hotel management or something ridiculous
S0198	i know and if you're gonna take away people's sick pay well then just be like look we'll meet you in the middle and we'll give you six days sort extra vacation
S0192	yeah
S0198	pay leave
S0192	yeah
S0198	cos that's what you would have i suggest you keep that as a sick pay
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	people wouldn't but then they can't call in sick so it's up to them isn't it
S0192	yeah sometimes you really be too sick to work though
S0198	yeah
S0192	teach especially when i have some basically migraines i'm pretty sure
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's pretty horrible just teach when your head be pound and you've get to perform and you've get to talk to people
S0198	it's terrible
S0192	not nice
S0198	i guess it's in an ideal world be that class that they do but you can't really do that in our job
S0192	depend the class or the course that you're run
S0198	yeah it do depend on the class and the course get through it though and the conversation programme come and go didn't it
S0192	it really do yeah six weeks of that be pretty quick
S0198	yeah really quick
S0192	erm
S0198	they weren't difficult days be they
S0192	no three hours a day
S0198	mm
S0192	of work most people can't confess to that it's pretty good
S0198	it be pretty good
S0192	yeah
S0198	well probably won't have that in our next job
S0192	no probably won't in any job for a while
S0198	or the job after that
S0192	by the sound of things in saudi they make you work full days
S0198	yeah
S0192	and we're gonna be at different institute so
S0198	mm
S0192	it's we're not gonna see each other in the day

S0192	don't deem it yeah yeah
S0198	they still think of it as be significant if you've actually go and do it
S0192	yeah
S0198	sign the paper
S0192	guess people must think that we do to have do it
S0198	i i guess so

S0192	me too
S0198	it wasn't there be nothing mad about that tea party
S0192	well we kick it into gear i think when we arrive
S0198	yeah someone's get to step it up right
S0192	yeah i think be fairly please that's what's er i didn't like and they be both very
S0198	yeah so they're go back to korea
S0192	yeah
S0198	how do you know that
S0192	cos their status be like seoul bind or something and i comment er underneath it like back to korea so soon and she just like it so i don't know if she's go with
S0198	mm
S0192	i presume she be cos they've just get marry didn't they
S0198	er to teach though they may they may be just transfer or
S0192	i know didn't sound like it
S0198	there's no i don't feel like that it would be a comeback that quickly
S0192	it sound like it but we didn't think would
S0198	i know but we didn't come back that quickly
S0192	they may have test the job market there and it be the wrong time for saudi and they just turn round and
S0198	i mean when do they leave
S0192	and they don't have that much experience they've get no post celter experience they
S0198	they've be basically do a few months
S0192	they've they're like us when we leave the first time they do their celter and then be like er what job be we gonna get
S0198	mm
S0192	and they're like well actually i quite like korea i reckon they be go back i reckon they've just weigh up some things and probably have a few job interview or try to get into place and didn't that's ah it's great though korea be too easy
S0192	and they'll do another couple of years there and then they'll er
S0198	they may have consider it if they've both what they consider quite good public school job or at avon university position
S0192	mm yeah they might have be able to get a uni job
S0198	it's really just luck of the draw
S0192	we could have get in at what do you think that would have be like
S0198	i feel like it would be like work at where we do but that your
S0192	but just less organise
S0198	yeah that your job be be split over both program like you do have at like at everyone teach a bite of everything maybe
S0192	yeah
S0198	and it it be still the same yeah but like your cos do you remember they would they say you get eight weeks pay holiday but they be always dodge the question of how their eight weeks happen
S0192	mm
S0198	and they wouldn't like they didn't want to say and i'm pretty sure it's probably the same at the end of every six weeks or semester or whatever you get a two week break or whatever it depend what i feel like it would've be on the same maybe work you even more
S0192	yeah
S0198	we didn't have any office hours i don't know if do
S0192	not have any office hours be amaze why don't all job do that
S0198	i know it's just do your job and make sure you do your job cos i don't know they don't know when they need you it depend on the type of job
S0192	i mean surely like in saudi do you have like a boss somebody that's look over you or be things actually a lot more chill than they seem to be
S0198	mm
S0192	because like everyone seem to say oh you get like a month or two months but then everyone i've speak to that's be out there or know people that be out there you seem to get more vacation than that there be more vacation than that and i wonder if like they say you do eight hours and you be mean to be around for most of the day but i'm sure if you have a class and then go and sit outside for an hour or two hours or disappear or go and do whatever come back i don't know if it'll be so rigid
S0198	yeah
S0192	it depend on i guess if you've get a type character that's in the office the whole time
S0198	yeah i don't think university i don't know where you'd be go i just it's
S0192	depend when you've finish
S0198	well if you
S0192	it really depend on how
S0198	your compound and
S0192	and if they run it like a public school and you've get like a
S0198	mm
S0192	have three years in the public school system in korea be a bite trippy
S0192	wasn't it
S0198	yeah i do do three years in there
S0192	it's a lot of erm pander to obligation and
S0198	yeah
S0192	get to understand their culture get out in the middle of nowhere you know like a one street village basically live in a
S0198	they don't let you forget very easily that you be different to them
S0192	no not at all
S0198	not in a negative way they're not like horrible but maybe even the other end where they're too accommodate where you never
S0192	there's no job like we're the same you and i
S0198	if you go out you you're never expect to pay for anything you're never consider korean so
S0192	i have one guy that say to me oh you be become korean
S0192	he have that like do you ever meet him i don't know if you
S0198	no
S0192	it's weird though it's very strange to me in the work world that we all experience different things
S0198	yeah yeah well when you go off to do a job
S0192	but you myself all four of us
S0198	we've get a little bite
S0192	convene at the weekend and have a good time
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	and like totally share every other experience but
S0198	you're in the classroom on your own
S0192	you're in the classroom and you're in the school those teachers be the people that you know
S0198	yeah
S0192	and once you've teach there long enough like in mokpo you start cross over teachers and that
S0198	we do become we we do get a we get so intertwine us four that entwine that
S0192	intertwine it's
S0198	that and we end up work at some of the same school as each other and we just like really keep it quite close
S0192	yeah to the point where we know different teachers and
S0198	and now we do some of the same and we even work at the same
S0192	well
S0198	school as each other let alone live i the same build
S0192	you can talk about work easier because you know mm there be the same people that i have
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	that you know she's talk about and 's talk about the same people that you have so we can talk to them about it and still know who be and ah it's amaze
S0198	yeah but yeah public school systems avoid that if possible
S0192	see
S0198	underneath there deal with children too much
S0192	no i'd rather deal with adults wherever possible
S0198	yeah
S0192	definitely
S0198	children need a lot of attention and energy i don't think definitely in korea that it be get deliver and i'm sure in an english class or an american classroom there's too many children to one teacher
S0192	absolutely
S0198	there's not
S0192	there shouldn't be more than about twelve children to a teacher
S0198	no
S0192	i think
S0198	i don't like this
S0192	this be you have class up to thirty
S0198	whereas the reason the class be i feel like you know you have no condition up there at that point you know sort of self train in a you have to be
S0192	i really think that a school where the learners teach themselves
S0198	mm
S0192	you know my idea before the learners teach themselves the teachers move about between the classrooms and you always have at least two teachers in the class at any one time but sometimes there could be three as people move in and change but you're constantly move and make sure
S0198	yeah an interact with
S0192	make sure that everything's go on and you have smaller class
S0198	mm
S0192	and you get to know the students more even if you even just have four room just for listen or read and speak or whatever or just like different activities do you know what i mean where they come on and there's like a you can have a pre make instruction video or something er something that they get they open they discuss as a group in english
S0198	yeah and they do
S0192	and they read the instructions and they teach each other how to do it could be something as simple as board game or anything just you know what i mean just anything that they have to figure out for themselves
S0198	mm
S0192	and they know that their only grade be participation
S0198	yeah
S0192	that's it it's one hundred percent participation therefore they will they should sort themselves out they should be able to correct their correct themselves and want to grow themselves especially at the time you get to tertiary education
S0198	mm
S0192	if it's a hundred percent you've get no other evaluation whatsoever you're gonna wanna play a part in that and
S0198	you don't have to
S0192	and you know that you can be evaluate all the time because there's you know like you know that the teachers can see through these windows you can't see through them
S0198	mm
S0192	it's like two way do you know what i mean and the teachers come in and out and they just make sure that you're understand and get on with what you're do and everyone have a different role
S0198	it might make well how big would the class be do you think
S0192	erm
S0198	it can't be too big because there'd be too many people compete
S0192	you don't want bigger than a team of six really
S0198	for attention wouldn't there yeah yeah there'd be team
S0192	there's be a team of six
S0198	yeah
S0192	and they would move around i think when they come into class they would decide which room to go in do you know what i mean
S0198	yeah yeah what they want to practice that day
S0192	you wouldn't tell them what it be but there be different room for different things and you be run different things on
S0198	mm
S0192	and they come in and they'll be like oh i could do an hour of this and then i can do thirty minutes of that or something and provide there's always enough students in there to be get it on with and they're do it themselves so if they go in the room and there's not enough people in there then it's up to them to try and get other people
S0198	people in
S0192	and it's just more interactive and they would i think you'd need to ban their own language a little bite
S0198	yeah
S0192	but they need to be at a good enough level where you could ban their own language and have constant access to dictionaries and all these kind of things around so if they're try to talk to each other and there's always teachers walk around but they're just not do it they're just let them get on with it
S0198	yeah
S0192	they're there to be ask question you can stand around and they'll ask you a question
S0198	yeah yeah be this right be that right
S0192	yeah and you can point them in the right direction
S0198	and then you can do a little bite of teach in that to that small group
S0192	yeah
S0198	of why it be wrong and and
S0192	yeah and then let them carry on
S0198	so a lot of it be self study and self correction and self management
S0192	it's be able to work
S0198	it would be nice wouldn't it
S0192	you'd need a crazy curriculum
S0198	yeah the plan would be
S0192	it would be tough you'd need some good people in there
S0198	you'd need some good teachers in there
S0192	yeah but that be a methodology
S0198	mm
S0192	i think you could actually sell that as if you could start up your own english school i mean really to start up your own english school you don't need much let's say you've just get one of these zone there's four room
S0198	mm
S0192	you've get two teachers per room so you've get eight teachers you can probably get a maximum of twelve students in each class
S0198	mm
S0192	so four class twelve students forty eight students how many teachers do i say
S0198	eight
S0192	eight teachers forty eight students and eight teachers how many eights fit into forty eight
S0198	er six
S0192	eight sixteen twenty four
S0198	six
S0192	thirty six
S0198	five and
S0192	forty four be it
S0198	no you say forty eight
S0192	eight sixteen twenty four thirty two forty
S0198	forty eight it's six
S0192	forty eight yeah so it's six
S0198	mm
S0192	so there's six students per teacher so if a student pay five pound per class that's thirty pound per teacher per hour
S0198	mm
S0192	say the teacher get pay twenty pound and ten pound be leave over for the run of the property and for whatever else that's a good enough business model but you need to get twelve students in each class
S0198	would the class only be an hour long or would you get other students come in
S0192	no the class no the class would be continual throughout the whole day
S0198	alright so they can just come and go
S0192	and they come in when they want really yeah
S0198	but you could you'd have to regulate it to an extent so not too many students show up at the same time to do one particular class
S0192	erm well provide there's no more than the forty eight provide you're not
S0198	it would be the tefl corridor and toefl corridor in the university or
S0192	provide no well i mean provide you're not over capacity you can just never by over capacity
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	if everyone turn up at once you could still manage it you just can't have more children or more people than that sign up
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	say the capacity be forty eight twelve students in each class and you have four class
S0198	but you would just would you tell them which class they go into
S0192	no they just come in and they'd open a door and be like oh it's busy in here i don't wanna go i there or like go in so they decide for themselves
S0198	oh so they don't know what class they're go into beforehand
S0192	no
S0198	ah i know
S0192	they go in and there's like a roster up and they can see what's go on in this board at what time
S0198	yeah
S0192	do you know what i mean so like we'll be run things at certain time in certain classrooms and then they just go in and open a door and try it out and try and hey guy like a bite of talk to people
S0198	what's there to prevent too many students be in one particular class
S0192	themselves and that's it
S0198	they have to stop themselves from go
S0192	presumably we don't you think that people would self regulate if you go in a class and there be like
S0198	and it's really yeah that's not what you want yeah
S0192	you'd probably wanna go somewhere quieter wouldn't you
S0198	yeah
S0192	and you could self regulate by only have x amount of table with the stuff set up
S0198	mm
S0192	and i think you'd have everyone stand there wouldn't be seat
S0198	that's true and people would move in and try something else
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah that's true
S0192	do you know what i mean
S0198	mm
S0192	it's all really active and task base but completely down to their own learn and what they wanna do
S0198	mm make your own decisions
S0192	and we have different four different things run at the same time always
S0198	yeah
S0192	and you could have it in like two hour slot so you change so effectively everyone run the same things that day but you er you just change the room or you have more things go on you'd need a variety of resources to
S0198	yeah you'd need a good amount of resources
S0192	but erm it could work i think
S0198	that's why i feel like the resources and the material that you would need to make it good would be well could be what cost quite a bite initially
S0192	mm yeah and especially if if they get ruin
S0198	if you need to how long would the that it would run how long would a semester
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0198	run for a semester twelve weeks
S0192	yeah i guess so you could even get like them to sign something for upkeep of the materials er do you know what i mean
S0198	yeah like take good care of them
S0192	just like if you damage yeah just ask them to do it but like if you damage any of the materials we ask that you be honest and come up and here's the exact price list of what they be and have it very reasonably price
S0198	yeah
S0192	if you break a little token on a board game it's ten pence or something do you know what i mean
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	you just come in and pay that
S0198	just so you're not run at a loss through wear or damage
S0192	no through wear and tear i think that would be fair to say to them to get them to sign that
S0198	mm
S0192	you need to get enough students and enough teachers and they all need to be like mind it wouldn't be an easy teach scenario but i think it would be effective
S0198	mm
S0192	they be force to do task in the language they have constant access with not too many students per teacher they can decide their learn they can decide what they're do that day and for how long
S0198	mm
S0192	and immediately they have to greet people when they come in cos there's different people every time you're not with the same set of people stick
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	sit next to the same person do whatever you come into a room you analyse it and you go you evaluate it and go these people look interest and what they're do look interest i'll go and do it and it can be simple stuff like you know try and build a house of card or you know what i mean
S0198	mm
S0192	task things that be tricky to do teach yourself to do the yo yo
S0198	t would be a really stimulate environment wouldn't it
S0192	like game watch movies like do stuff that actually take give them movies but with no subtitle and their task be to try and work out what they're say
S0198	analyse some of the movie or something yeah
S0192	and like you know and try and make a dialogue for what they think be be say
S0198	yeah
S0192	and to discuss it all like as a team all that kind of stuff
S0198	it could be a lot of fun
S0192	yeah
S0198	it would be a really stimulate environment very active it would snap you out of it and you'd have to concentrate
S0192	mm definitely
S0198	too much be leave to you make it too easy to just so now
S0192	you could have them have their own recommendations as well for things they wanna do and do make an effort to include some of those things in it so that if someone say you know they wanna do this instead of that then you know a week or two later you do actually put it in
S0198	yeah right
S0192	like a recommendations box it would have to be reasonable i think theatre work well in an english language classroom
S0198	theatre yeah
S0192	yeah i do
S0198	i mean it
S0192	i think when we do that play that be quite good
S0198	i think students need to you can't be shy especially in some of these like smaller classrooms be shy be not very helpful it's not gonna help you
S0192	be self conscious too much
S0198	you're not gonna you will learn faster if you're just more will to participate
S0192	yeah
S0198	so yeah do the drama thing kind of force everyone to do that
S0192	and they have write it so there's write
S0198	mm
S0192	they have to memorise it
S0198	mm
S0192	they have to practice their intonation and their tone and their body language they're all natural things
S0198	mm
S0192	they have to know their line well enough so that if somebody screw up they can correct it which mean they have to understand what they're say
S0198	mm
S0192	you definitely have to comprehend it to be able to correct it and they can be creative and write their own ones
S0198	mm although they struggle
S0192	there be some other ones in korea struggle with it quite badly but some of them do
S0198	i still can't believe some like some of them would
S0192	some of them be really
S0198	be quote or act stuff from freeze and they never have hear of freeze
S0192	no
S0198	or know and literally didn't know
S0192	i have some boys sing in mine
S0198	yeah it really confuse me at point why be they sing sing about a snowman and it have nothing to do with the rest of the role play
S0198	it's just someone practice sing but mm i love that show
S0192	yeah i really do
S0198	hat it and if a seven year old boy doesn't like it then
S0192	there's no to it
S0198	no it might be a bite girly
S0192	the koreans don't care about
S0198	no
S0192	sexuality pretty much
S0198	i'm pretty sure erm i can't remember his name now but my first co teacher er at the middle school what be his name he definitely get a man crush on russell crowe after watch what be that big musical le mis
S0192	les miserables
S0192	a few of them do
S0198	mm i never watch it obviously but it be all to do with russell crowe as a royal marine
S0192	man crush you can definitely admire people of the same sex
S0198	yeah absolutely mm yeah
S0192	and i guess be besotted with them without it be sexual
S0198	yeah that's why they call it like a man crush or a girl crush it's something strange people say i suppose
S0192	be crush a british thing
S0198	no i don't think so be that
S0192	because koreans definitely didn't know it
S0198	oh didn't they
S0192	no to have a crush on oh be it crush no fancy
S0198	fancy's english
S0192	that be english
S0198	yeah americans don't say it
S0192	they say like cos you can say what do you fancy
S0198	yeah
S0192	you know what do you want all americans say that one
S0198	maybe
S0192	but then when you say i you fancy them
S0198	i think they understand it but i don't think it's use maybe it's something that be old fashion
S0192	it's a little strange to have a fancy
S0198	mm
S0192	mm what's your fancy
S0198	i know yeah but what other word would you use instead of that i mean you when you're like oh i really isn't want isn't the right word you don't actually want it
S0192	no
S0198	but you're
S0192	you have a crave for it yeah
S0198	you crave it yeah i fancy be a crave isn't it really
S0192	mm oh i fancy a bite of that
S0198	mm
S0192	or it's not necessarily a crave it can be an immediate
S0198	yeah
S0192	quite compel want
S0198	yeah i guess it's that one word we have for that like immediate stimulation we have from something
S0192	fancy
S0198	which be why we fancy people because when we see them it's the same immediate oh
S0192	and also because fancy someone be usually quite transient l think as well
S0198	mm
S0192	do you know that word
S0198	transient no it be
S0192	fleet pass not ephemeral not last very long
S0198	ephemeral
S0192	ephemeral ephemeral
S0198	mm
S0192	erm transient not last very long so when you have a fancy with someone like an addiction
S0198	mm
S0192	it's transient it's pass it's go soon so it's kind of like a crave
S0198	mm
S0192	you you just crave that person a little bite and then it go away
S0198	yeah
S0192	god i have a couple of crush on girls that be so strong
S0192	it's tough what be that feel
S0198	i don't know
S0192	i think it's exacerbate by a culture of want
S0198	mm
S0192	i mean do you know what i mean if you grow up in a culture where you've get to feel like you possess something
S0198	other things if we want stuff you can you buy it or you
S0192	yeah but i definitely
S0198	after like
S0192	want a couple of girls not many just a couple
S0198	i guess there's a very instinctive emotion that we experience that we don't it's one of the first or it's the most dramatic one isn't it that we naturally start fancy people
S0192	it's a bite strange that
S0198	but this like this primitive inbuilt thing though
S0192	boys and girls and boys and boys and girls and girls but especially boys and girls at a young age you don't have to be very old you realise very young that you're different
S0198	yeah
S0192	show you this and i'll show you that or whatever you kind of want to have a look you know what be that down there and then you get a little bite older
S0198	i do wonder how children i can't really remember what it's like
S0192	and you go through a period between have a look and get with a girl or the opposite partner or whoever you fancy and be repel by them but jokingly
S0198	mm
S0192	oh girls have get cooties or whatever or your kiss chase oh try and get away from them
S0198	yeah kiss chase
S0192	girl girls be horrible boys be horrible oh you know i get because in your sub conscious i guess you know that you be mean to get together
S0198	mm
S0192	and it's a bite strange cos you're a bite like why oh girls be horrible that can't be right you're like have a bite of a rebellion and
S0198	it do become more you go through a stage in late primary school i don't know you're five or something or you're six when kiss chase do go from be something that be a genuine game to be have moments of be awkward or uncomfortable
S0192	yeah
S0198	like oh that be kind of gross actually i don't want it's not so funny anymore
S0198	or just awkward
S0192	you grow out of it why do all little kid play kiss chase
S0198	i don't know you get teach it at school by someone someone's
S0192	someone's carry the
S0198	some little boy just start chase a girl and she then go
S0198	the girl's like no or the other way round girls like kiss
S0192	mm yeah
S0198	i'm always try to kiss my nephews and they always try to run away
S0192	yeah that's probably where kiss chase come from
S0198	the girl but the little girls have like it and they get like er a bite more affectionate as well
S0192	mm
S0198	it be nice watch it's funny watch little people with other little people
S0192	yeah and they hug each other
S0198	like how they treat different age
S0192	yeah they look after each other
S0198	yeah they do
S0192	if there's one older than another one they do
S0198	yeah from a really small size
S0192	just literally care for each other
S0198	mm
S0192	they show them what they've learn
S0198	yeah
S0192	and they pass on the knowledge it's such a very strange concept be a child
S0198	it's really weird
S0192	you know what i mean really strange
S0198	you be literally in your own bubble
S0192	you be
S0198	and the adults be very much the adults
S0192	an empty vessel
S0198	mm
S0192	you be complete and full you be but you're not experience you have no knowledge you have all the motor function and all the instincts and all the abilities that an adult will have and you'll grow into an adult
S0198	with a lot more things you learn that
S0192	but but you yourself be shape by all of this environment around us and now complicate by the quite deep pervasive er human society that we've create on top of the natural society
S0198	yeah that's the thing grow up before you would have have all your instincts
S0192	mm
S0198	but it won't
S0192	like time be simpler
S0198	but you can't rely on and that's not what you need anymore it's the wrong set of skills

S0198	mm anything numerous things pay back loan and and bank
S0192	wi fi and just
S0192	all these crazy concepts so many technologies that we erm we take for grant but we don't really actually know how they work

S0198	yeah it isn't good be it
S0192	no and my immediately brand new pan stick like a
S0198	be it cos it hasn't no
S0192	cos they haven't what
S0198	hopefully your dad's will be better
S0192	we'll see
S0198	we shouldn't cook with them all like at once and see the see which ones cook better than others
S0192	i need to put a bite of water in this cos it's stick to the bottom which it shouldn't really do
S0198	be it cos we use the fat more fat from the meat
S0192	i don't know might be because i use butter instead of erm oil
S0198	could just be the material of the pan i suppose
S0192	butter have a tendency to stick on oh can i use that
S0198	yeah crush some garlic with the garlic crusher
S0192	that's a good idea
S0198	if it's one that actually work i don't like the one in
S0192	oh
S0198	bless you
S0192	make me sneeze then
S0198	it's all go to the back of my throat quite badly
S0192	yeah
S0198	there's some serious er
S0192	the spice that seem to do it
S0198	could do with some other plat and have you get any plat or plat come out
S0192	yeah it's
S0198	or bowl you say bowl didn't you
S0192	i think so yeah a few plat and bowl
S0198	yeah
S0192	my mum be try to give me more of old dusty spider web ride stuff but i be like no i think you've give me too much
S0198	okay
S0192	i think she be just try to get rid of them really can i get rid of this garlic it's just get in the way can take that out
S0198	oh oh sorry
S0192	oh that be a bite noisy
S0198	there
S0192	it's all go down your throat
S0192	yeah definitely
S0192	the quality of the beef seem okay it's seem very different from what we know in korea that stuff we have in korea be pretty fatty and chewy
S0198	oh
S0192	oh no
S0198	what
S0192	just i make a mess
S0198	oh
S0192	never do that before what i've notice though the beef here be really
S0198	oh man be it my eye or be this come through grey
S0192	yeah it look i think it's change their colour
S0198	why would it be come through grey
S0192	cos it's dirty in there cos the stuff your dad get be
S0198	no this be from their cupboard but they they get a different one so they stop use it but my dad didn't tell me there be anything wrong with it
S0192	well he might have be lie or he didn't realise
S0198	why would the
S0192	i think in a way you need a knife be there only one knife
S0198	yeah
S0192	or give it a good clean oh this onion's punchy and have you get it alright
S0198	get what alright
S0192	the garlic crusher be it work any better
S0198	i mean it work well it's just come out a funny colour i'm not really sure
S0192	can you wash the garlic afterwards
S0198	i don't know
S0192	i don't think it should be come out grey
S0198	no
S0192	i've never see
S0198	it's not the inner a grey garlic
S0192	i haven't see grey garlic before
S0198	well do think it will do us any harm because i need to start peel more garlic er i need that knife
S0192	yeah i still need to do another onion be this the only knife we have
S0198	mm
S0192	oh
S0198	it's the only sharp knife we have i still don't know how i'm go to crush garlic with it it's too small
S0192	be it really come out grey how grey be we talk
S0198	i mean it look grey to me it might be the light
S0192	no there's definitely bits of something in there
S0198	i know
S0192	give that thing a wash
S0198	but i wash it i just wash it after
S0192	again then
S0198	after the first bite of grey
S0192	be it come out any of this grey
S0198	no i don't think so it's weird that
S0192	well there can't there can't be an infinite amount of grey stuff in there to
S0198	be this just be it just the material of the crusher itself
S0192	no
S0198	the metal no
S0192	probably not it's it's not infinite be it you're wear away the material
S0198	just don't understand see it's make the dishcloth go grey i think it's
S0198	i think it's the look it's the it's this whatever it's cover in
S0192	yeah i think throw it
S0198	yeah that's not good a god crusher that
S0192	no can i have the can and can you wash the pepper
S0198	i need to cut a if you can just
S0192	the garlic can go in last but i need to do the pepper first unfortunate
S0198	if you're sure
S0192	yeah pepper doesn't er garlic doesn't need to cook for very long cook a onion till soft
S0198	well you'll wanna leave it on for a little while once it's finish
S0192	yeah
S0198	i'll strain these bean shall i
S0192	yeah if you can do both can to strain
S0198	i think the pepper
S0192	i think we need two can if we're gonna do that
S0198	oh both of them
S0192	yeah i think so yeah
S0198	alright then
S0192	don't you think
S0198	yes i trust your judgement yeah it's this be do you need to rinse these as well or be they okay
S0192	i think they're fine
S0198	now i've put that right near to the cloth it's not the easiest of stain
S0192	be it not
S0198	the burn it's quite big
S0192	get a good amount of space at the moment
S0198	yeah yeah and it's just a better layout in general isn't it
S0192	we didn't have the best layout for a kitchen
S0198	no a surface space
S0192	be surprise we even have a kitchen so
S0198	yeah
S0192	of course we're go to we're adults those kind of question they ask be
S0198	yeah
S0192	you know like that guy i be try to sell the bike to the guy be tell me well then how can you have a kitchen in there that's illegal
S0198	yeah
S0192	cos i mean i'm a teacher i think it's okay
S0198	to say that at all though what's the point just
S0192	he's be a dick
S0198	yeah in a manner of speak
S0192	and then he didn't even buy the bike
S0198	no what a lot of effort to go to
S0192	yeah
S0198	i bet i bet they go and buy a new bike
S0192	why even bother it's a fifty thousand one second hand bike on knowledge that be a bite of a if you ask me
S0198	i'm sure he spend a little bite just on the bus fare or the taxi fare or whatever
S0192	yeah i know
S0198	or do he walk actually be he even in
S0192	yeah it have take him a while it be pretty hot there you go here's that knife you've get the here
S0198	right
S0192	i'll just bring this up
S0198	i need a chop board to go with that then
S0192	we've get some scissor haven't we
S0198	snip that yeah we've get what er what do you need scissor for
S0192	erm well we've only get plum tomatoes so they need to be put in a bowl or like chop at least
S0198	well just put them in the blender
S0192	oh we've get our blender
S0198	yeah put them in the blender
S0192	of course we do yeah put them in the where be they then do they have a ring pull no they don't
S0198	ah this be really we can do it
S0192	i can taste it
S0198	hopefully the bottle opener where will
S0192	it be three can
S0198	i don't know
S0192	oh this can opener's really good
S0198	yeah it's not bad be it i don't usually trust
S0192	no some can openers be terrible
S0198	new things
S0192	be the blender pretty straightforward
S0198	i mean i haven't try it
S0192	you haven't
S0198	no but i imagine it's okay
S0192	i'll have a look this be the main attachment be it like a bullet
S0198	yeah the bullet's a little er there's the other one's in if you want like the i don't know a different shape one
S0192	where do i plug it in oh in here
S0198	yeah and maybe i should move
S0192	oh my god the yeah go in okay and this grip on top be they gonna fit two
S0198	should fit just two can in it it's get to be a litre at least hasn't it that thing
S0192	yeah
S0198	maybe just a litre
S0192	maybe it will just fit two can it should fit two can shouldn't it
S0198	there's gonna be a bite spray out
S0192	we'd normally have a bite of herbs in this we do have some pepper didn't we we buy some
S0198	yeah we buy some pepper
S0192	where's the pepper
S0198	it's on the it's on the shelf with the mustard
S0192	on the shelf with the mustard i see it
S0198	do you want to just blend that tomato in with it so er blend i mean the garlic so the garlic's smaller
S0192	yeah yeah we can do that that's a good idea so just crush a bunch
S0198	this'll probably finely dice it very well then peel garlic again aren't we
S0192	yeah i know it's not as easy as it be in korea
S0198	a longer process
S0192	that's for sure
S0198	i forget about it i hadn't even notice
S0192	what that you're have to do it
S0198	yeah
S0192	how do you do this thing then
S0198	it become automatic
S0192	there's no button
S0198	yeah you just like er er it's a twist isn't it yeah push down and twist
S0192	no that's how you put it on
S0198	oh right
S0192	i have absolutely no idea how that work
S0198	no that's gotta be something
S0192	oh hang on maybe oh it come out
S0198	oh oh

S0198	no we just need to put the lid on
S0192	as new blenders glow go i don't like it

S0192	might well give it away for good so you've strain the kidney bean that's two can isn't it
S0198	yeah
S0192	right and then we need to empty this
S0198	no just need to
S0192	be walk and we've be quite a bite have go in the mechanism
S0198	yeah we need to tilt that into that bowl
S0192	yeah i'm do that but i mean

S0198	what a bitch
S0192	how do we wash this out do it need wash out
S0198	erm er
S0192	oh no it's everywhere baby do you want to give that a wash out
S0192	maybe so
S0198	you're in charge of the garlic now
S0192	okay i'm in charge of the garlic
S0198	now you say you say first
S0192	not very nice garlic that'll cook a while
S0198	it's basically the whole thing
S0192	it's cos we waste a bite this cook have be a disaster so far we need to get back in the rhythm
S0198	i know it's cos we're so unsure of things at the moment
S0192	do you think garlic's stronger here
S0198	well my dad's one definitely be whatever he's be eat it's really strong but i guess you don't i mean we do eat raw garlic all the time in korea
S0192	but with other stuff
S0198	yeah
S0192	don't just eat er yeah
S0198	i mean i eat it in like mix in a salad thing my dad make it make my eye water sometimes
S0192	yeah it's too much
S0198	i mean i like it but it's definitely
S0198	definitely strong it's good though i like it
S0192	what be we do with this then
S0198	with what
S0192	the tomatoes we need you to clean it out so i can continue with my
S0198	no but the floor's i can't let you keep tread tomato in
S0192	yeah
S0198	how be i go to clean this out
S0192	i don't know just give it a wipe with a cloth of something
S0198	oh this be terrible
S0192	that doable don't wanna give that cloth cloth a wash in this tomato do you think i need to add a whole another can
S0198	what after the last one
S0192	yeah
S0198	we need to have tomato in it i suppose
S0192	it's nice tomato anyway
S0198	yeah go on then
S0192	well i mean how much do you think we really lose
S0198	oh it's hard to tell a little bite but not i doubt a can's worth
S0192	i wish your mum be here where's the bite at the bottom
S0198	so
S0192	oh this bite that need a wash so basically this just wasn't screw in
S0198	i guess so that be the that's what it seem like
S0192	that's terrible so provide it get screw in properly so it just wasn't in at all oh my god that be a
S0198	well
S0192	a a mistake
S0192	but we couldn't get it to turn on either there be something confuse about that
S0198	yeah maybe because it know that it wasn't it wasn't attach properly or something don't know i mean
S0192	it's all everywhere everything
S0198	tomato everywhere such a mess
S0192	do you wanna practice this thing yeah this need a good clean now just this thing
S0198	yeah
S0192	oh be you mean to just pull it out like that
S0198	yeah you squeeze it and
S0192	be you sure
S0198	and it start activate
S0192	oh that's a bite crazy
S0198	that's the same as the bullet though the thing that look like arrow here you just squeeze there and they you
S0192	and it do it
S0198	it didn't seem so crazy cos you there be a hand but this one's a little bigger
S0192	yeah so i need that garlic firstly
S0198	yeah put that in there
S0192	be that in here i turn this off but yet it's still cook
S0198	mm
S0192	i turn it off a while ago
S0198	those things cool down quickly at all
S0192	no
S0198	that's i kind of wanna take the stick that in a taco now
S0192	i mean you can do
S0198	we don't have any tacos
S0192	but i i think we should yeah we don't have any tacos do you think there's too much in here or will it just fit in here nicely
S0198	er do you put another can in there
S0192	no i haven't put another can in
S0198	oh right so from that
S0192	oh it's go everywhere it's terrible
S0198	they're probably alright i mean we always boil it down anyway and oh it's quite noisy isn't it
S0192	mean isn't it
S0198	so before it just wasn't screw in at all
S0192	so be it be it do now do you think i'd say so

S0192	that can be do
S0198	erm
S0192	or you
S0198	could boil a kettle but it's not really worth it be it i think it
S0192	well we do have the light on why do we have the light on

S0192	must be
S0198	i be look at the guide the one on the can't leave any light on especially when we've get the oven run as well i wonder if cook be go to be really expensive
S0192	hopefully not it's electric hopefully just we'll just heat this through turn it off separate it what be we actually separate this into
S0192	if we don't have any tupperware or cling film have we get saucepans with lids
S0198	yes
S0192	so be just gonna
S0198	but how big be they be they gonna fit in our fridge i don't think so
S0192	probably it's probably about that long you could put two thirds of that in here
S0198	oh yeah you just wanna separate it out yeah yeah
S0192	we'll have today's
S0198	and keep it all together can't you you don't have to separate it into days
S0192	there's quite a deep one that one

S0192	it's a good rice one
S0198	yeah we'll put the rice in there
S0192	oh there's a bite of rizla in there wet rizla lovely
S0198	wonder where that come from
S0192	no idea we gonna have another cigarette in a
S0198	and a beer
S0192	and a beer
S0198	while that cook there
S0192	what's the time when be you speak to your family

S0198	yeah that's good though isn't it
S0192	mm it's look good
S0198	yeah so it's enough for three days isn't there
S0192	i'm pretty sure if we separate it
S0198	and then you can use it as and how you like
S0192	yeah that would be easier
S0198	portion accord you can always get something you could always get like a jacket potato or something to go with it for lunchtime
S0192	yeah i could do that would be nice actually but then i've get to go out to the shop wherever that be
S0198	wouldn't cost you very much would it
S0192	oh the batteries go down a little bite on here
S0198	oh put that
S0192	important
S0198	these be
S0192	i think it's probably cook enough

S0192	yeah i mean for like a few minutes we're gonna eat dinner quite early aren't we
S0198	yeah
S0192	if we have another beer and a cigarette maybe
S0198	yeah perhaps we shouldn't leave it on anymore so you'd reheat some in a little while

S0198	yeah
S0192	should be pretty cook now
S0198	alright look good actually doesn't it
S0192	look

S0192	yeah
S0198	and we'll just have it in a little bite
S0192	cool
S0198	i think i'll be too full after dinner to drink beer

S0192	about that big fill with ice cream
S0198	mm
S0192	but every like few centimetres of ice cream there's another chocolate egg
S0198	oh
S0192	so you have to keep crack through to the ice cream
S0198	that would be amaze i think isn't like the layer i think you'd want the chocolate to get quite thin
S0192	yeah yeah it would get thinner as you go along
S0198	you'll want er want some chocolate
S0192	it would start thicker and get thinner as you go along but can you imagine crack that egg and eat around it and get all the and there's another egg
S0198	and there's another chocolate egg oh sound awful for you
S0192	and more ice cream then

S0198	that's why electric's terrible terrible
S0198	terrible

S0192	be it there
S0198	crème fraiche
S0192	oh

S0192	because we ask them to yes
S0198	yeah and they should if you ask
S0192	that be a bite of a pain in the arse actually i couldn't get hold of my dad
S0198	so if you don't have internet and your internet go down you can't use your printer
S0192	if we don't buy a cable for it you can buy a cheap printer to computer cable but they don't tend to come with them anymore
S0198	oh right
S0192	erm so this will work with wireless but yeah when if the internet be to go down then we couldn't print
S0198	yeah i'm not sure if my parent have a wireless really
S0192	yeah might not be might just look similar there be quite a few model that look pretty similar
S0198	it's very the the front of it look look like erm it's something well they do look identical
S0192	but you're alright with me get that one
S0198	that's good yeah definitely i trust your judgement
S0192	they have a lot of sales erm the other one be slightly cheaper but the ink be like seventeen pound a replacement or something i pay ten pound and get three replacements
S0198	oh have you
S0192	for each one yeah some other one that everyone say work
S0198	oh awesome yeah definitely it's all about the ink cartridges really and how much they cost
S0192	definitely
S0198	that's what you're gonna continue to pay for every like month or couple of months
S0192	mm
S0198	around the year they be just run a printer's expensive fuck a car
S0198	or anything else
S0192	my dad say the other day oh running's a car's cheap i be like whatever i mean he doesn't even pay for it really
S0198	yeah i know he he get free fuel
S0192	doesn't pay for his car so that be a bite of a funny thing to say oh well
S0198	you need money to buy a car to begin with although 's car he pay three hundred pound for it
S0192	oh
S0198	it's a little old car and obviously it fail its mot but he be expect that but he have be rid it to er from london quite a lot lately and
S0192	and he's get his use out of it three hundred quid
S0198	just for three hundred quid he's earn it yeah
S0192	he still do he have to pay that every year
S0198	what to re to
S0192	yeah get get another car
S0198	well people seem to anyway
S0192	yeah i know
S0198	oh what to get another car yeah he probably will that's a
S0192	that's where you're gonna spend about five hundred quid a year just on upgrade your car and on and or maintain it
S0198	insurance
S0192	and more people spend like over the years
S0198	just you have to pay for an mot don't you and like everything cost
S0192	yeah road tax lessons
S0198	yeah
S0192	we be become the minority though of people that can't drive
S0198	no well chris say when he have drive lessons they be ten pound a lesson
S0192	oh it be over twenty when i do it
S0198	i know in the
S0192	i reckon they're probably twenty five
S0198	which mean in er in the space of like seven years they're like seven years they've double in price
S0192	yeah
S0198	from when he be seventeen to when i be seventeen
S0192	well they've just like double in price
S0198	it's a joke ten pound a lesson be pretty reasonable isn't it be that cos fuel double in price i doubt
S0192	i guess for the driver that's pretty cheap isn't it
S0198	mm
S0192	you're not get pay much an hour people pay ten pound an hour
S0198	yeah
S0192	to sit in his car and drive it around
S0198	that's true petrol be expensive as well
S0192	well just
S0198	maintain cars be expensive
S0192	mm er if you can do those crash course for like five hundred pound learn to drive in a week sort of thing
S0198	be they still five hundred pound
S0192	they be i don't know if they be anymore
S0198	i'd be tempt i think they be more like a grand maybe that be just that's still a lot of money isn't it a thousand pound
S0192	yeah it be a lot of money
S0198	yeah
S0192	well for the two of us to learn to drive
S0198	yeah well yeah see that's the thing i have get to the point now where i'd like to confidently get in a car and drive it regardless of like the the licence
S0192	but even if you have lessons and even if you pass the test you're not gonna do that very often so you're gonna have gap
S0198	you're always gonna be
S0192	of two or three years and you're gonna be a bite
S0198	you're never gonna be that comfortable in a car
S0192	wary no you're gonna be wary
S0198	so long as you're confident enough though
S0192	i mean i could probably drive a car now
S0198	mm
S0192	just not very well i don't know if i could drive a car actually or reverse like pull out of that park space and then
S0198	yeah
S0192	i don't think i could i'm alright too many cigarettes

S0198	and that's gonna be the first thing that i'm gonna do
S0192	when you're away with your parent i don't wanna
S0198	cos they're gonna come in and i don't want to don't want to start smell like a smoker again
S0192	no well we've get tomorrow if we don't smoke in the morning
