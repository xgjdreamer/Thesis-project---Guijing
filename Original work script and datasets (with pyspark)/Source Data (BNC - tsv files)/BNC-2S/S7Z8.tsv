S0084	you couldn't live off it
S0157	no
S0084	well not not not solely work for the press and plus you're not really suppose to do that anyway as a freelance you're suppose to work for other publish house but you could do that you could contact other publish house
S0157	yeah
S0084	once you've start work at the press and say you're a proofreader for cup
S0157	yeah at least it'd be something extra wouldn't it
S0084	yeah because i mean
S0157	would help
S0084	the go rate be like nineteen pound an hour
S0157	that's not bad
S0084	that's not bad at all and i mean depend on what the book be it's anywhere between two hundred pound and four hundred pound for a project
S0157	yeah
S0084	so you know it's it's nice it's a nice little bonus and if you have like a couple of those a week
S0157	if i have a couple of those and say like another job like a any like
S0084	yeah just a temping office job
S0157	yeah
S0084	if you're do one of those a week or couple of those a month
S0157	then that'd be alright cos the only problem with do the proofread at the moment reason i haven't get to do it be cos i already have work extra work to do at home
S0084	mm
S0157	so it's doesn't really fit very well with teach but with a normal job oh what be that all about
