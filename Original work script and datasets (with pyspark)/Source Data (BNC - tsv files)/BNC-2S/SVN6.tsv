S0426	right yes the well that that's right
S0427	the pink's behind the green or whatever or it be you know and
S0427	i think that's one of the great line in commentary
S0426	that yes isn't it that's right exactly that's right it use to be very popular on tv didn't it it be bbc two's
S0427	you have pot black as well didn't you
S0426	pot black that's the
S0427	yeah colour television make it
S0426	that's it that's it
S0427	you know
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	erm but er
S0426	mind you it be the days when there be only three or four channel to watch so
S0427	indeed
S0426	it wouldn't have be that difficult to generate a very large audience
S0427	no but anyway i didn't see that erm i do some garden
S0426	good
S0427	well nothing good about it it be a case of go out there now or get lose in the jungle and
S0426	that's right
S0427	and have to send out a search party
S0427	to find me
S0426	i think saturday be
S0427	erm
S0426	good enough for that but sunday wouldn't have be i don't think would it
S0427	er i be lucky erm
S0426	okay
S0427	i the grass be dry enough on sunday and i i go out and er and do it and the rest of the time i be mark dissertations and
S0426	ah yes you
S0427	in chinese
S0426	you've take a whole bunch for
S0427	mm
S0426	of
S0427	yes
S0426	what be they like in the end
S0427	oh it's the language difficulties with the
S0426	sure
S0427	chinese students i mean
S0426	sure sure sure sure
S0427	speak to one or two of them it become clearer after a bite what they're at
S0426	yes
S0427	but obviously they need to make their write english clearer too so
S0426	sure
S0427	i think there will be a bite of a challenge there but i think we'll be alright
S0426	i've always
S0427	the dissertations
S0426	be strike
S0427	one be poor one be good
S0426	but just in the ordinary sort of the way that of er of poorness and goodness like
S0427	yeah
S0426	everybody else
S0427	i mean
S0426	can be poor and good yeah
S0427	yeah erm just er just normal third year undergraduate stuff you know
S0426	fine
S0427	you know one be a third and one be a a and very clearly
S0426	but surely these be we're talk about mscs aren't we
S0427	yes well i have two things here i have proposals from three four msc students
S0426	right
S0427	it be postgraduates and i
S0426	yes
S0427	also have two undergraduate dissertations which be late hand in
S0426	okay right
S0427	and the deadlines and the deadlines for the dissertations as such and the proposals that with the students here on and it really have to be do on the weekend so
S0426	well they're go to be send off for the external any time soon aren't they very very imminently i think
S0427	yes and deal with that yeah
S0426	not that they must well we've have this discussion before not that they can do much about it that they will do much about they can't do much about it
S0427	no no i mean i i i think the would be well i think you're consistently over mark
S0426	exactly
S0427	or under mark or
S0427	more constructively erm er we have this a few years ago be somebody say you know you've get some bright students why don't you encourage them
S0426	mm
S0427	to do more empirical work rather than be play safe with the with their graphical erm
S0426	it's not i've see i've see in
S0427	and in fact that's what we've do now
S0426	it's interest
S0427	we we've not we've not put it in a regulation it must be empirical
S0426	yes yes right
S0427	but we really
S0426	you allow
S0427	have encourage and i would say perhaps say to you ninety percent of all of our undergraduates now do
S0426	interest
S0427	some form of empirical work
S0426	interest
S0427	and it's actually make much more interest for me
S0426	i'd have think so
S0427	erm
S0426	i think really the empirical piece be bind to be at least a bite original
S0427	yeah
S0426	whereas a rehash er well rehash a long essay's just a long essay basically
S0427	one of our students do something i think be really rather clever it and i'm not even sure i'm use this correctly it might have be even phenomenological
S0426	wow
S0427	because she do a study of her fellow students on the third year of the criminology course
S0426	yes
S0427	to see whether the information on crime and justice have alter their er opinions on er punishment and rehabilitation and things like that
S0426	but do she do it before and after
S0427	er i think she compare it with people who be non criminology students you couldn't do a before and after
S0426	yeah
S0427	because you know
S0426	ah mm
S0427	yeah i know what you mean but we it it's not perfect
S0426	oh
S0427	empiricism but
S0426	you're right
S0427	you know
S0426	all that
S0427	you know
S0426	all that say you know criminology students mm
S0427	yeah
S0426	think differently or say differently from
S0427	yeah okay
S0426	non criminology students whether they'd change when they be
S0427	there may be there may be more to it than that
S0426	alright okay yeah
S0427	because i i wasn't supervise
S0426	yeah yeah alright
S0427	this at all
S0426	okay that's alright
S0427	but erm but i yeah i think that be er quite
S0426	good for her
S0427	a more interest use of students
S0426	yes yes yes
S0427	rather than the the stuff on drug
S0426	yeah
S0427	or drink or er
S0426	which there's more normal
S0427	mm
S0426	but do they get any research methods train from you
S0427	er yeah they do it i think jointly with the sociology people
S0426	okay right okay
S0427	i think it's now jointly one
S0426	so not throw into the deep end
S0427	no no no
S0427	no and and to be fair very few of them for instance do anything with require spss
S0426	okay
S0427	it's it's i wouldn't say it's advance it it tend to be things like online questionnaires
S0426	right
S0427	or semi structure interview or maybe a focus group
S0426	fine
S0427	and a limit number of people
S0426	sure
S0427	you know it it would be churlish of us to say well we're it's brilliant but we're not gonna give you any mark because it's it there's there's the sample's too small you know
S0426	i mean with a with an online questionnaire you can reasonably easily knock up a hundred people
S0427	yes but it's it's difficult for instance if you want to interview some police officer just
S0426	oh no no
S0427	just to get
S0426	if you're do
S0427	seven or eight
S0426	no no no
S0427	be do brilliantly
S0426	that's fantastic
S0427	you know yeah
S0426	no that's a difficult kettle of fish
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	but
S0427	no you're right with online stuff
S0426	people's perceptions of
S0427	yeah
S0426	drug er
S0427	yeah
S0426	drug drink whatever
S0427	yeah
S0426	that yeah that's comparatively
S0427	yeah
S0426	straightforward
S0427	yeah
S0426	it's what they do with it afterwards they're after whether they can
S0427	yeah indeed
S0426	write about it in an insightful
S0427	yeah
S0426	way and relate it to the
S0427	yeah
S0426	literature and to make theoretical
S0427	exactly
S0426	you know
S0427	exactly and some of them
S0427	do that really well and others you know they struggle with it
S0426	sure
S0427	but erm but it it's make for a more interest crop
S0426	good
S0427	i think of
S0426	good
S0427	topics and
S0426	good good
S0427	erm er and to an extent i think it's the allow them to put into practice skills that would or to try and develop skills that would otherwise have remain completely dormant
S0426	and it's another line for their cv in that regard
S0427	yeah
S0426	you know they're go to go to place which be gonna expect the student to be able to do a a report on something
S0427	yes
S0426	you know
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	be it be the performance of the shop in the last six months or
S0427	mm
S0426	you know undertake to do a survey of their customers or
S0427	and and for the first time they really understand firsthand you know what data be how you've get to organise it
S0426	true
S0427	and make sense of it and
S0426	true
S0427	never mind
S0426	true
S0427	the gather of it
S0426	that's right
S0427	you know erm
S0426	the kind of
S0427	so it's very good for them
S0426	unless they be go to be read frontline research paper they may never come across data
S0427	mm
S0426	in its comparatively not raw but you know
S0427	yeah
S0426	do in somebody do something with it as oppose to textbooks and simply read
S0427	mm i think that's
S0426	and digest it
S0427	i think that's right i mean er i can think of a couple of professions that some of our students have go into say police probation prison service and i would really really struggle to think of erm day to day job that they
S0426	mm
S0427	do that would
S0426	mm
S0427	require detail erm quantitative or qualitative methods
S0426	no but they're gonna be in an information environment where things will come at them
S0427	yeah
S0426	and they have to understand
S0427	and oh i agree with all that i i mean i i i mean i think in some ways the the cleverer ones amongst them will realise that they be offer something that the probation service prison service and police don't often have and that be an ability
S0426	no that's true
S0427	to handle
S0426	that's true
S0427	quantitative
S0426	that's true
S0427	and qualitative data
S0426	that's true
S0427	because the police don't
S0426	that's true
S0427	the police would normally outsource it or
S0426	exactly so that's right
S0427	or they've get civilian employees
S0426	that's right
S0427	to do
S0426	that's true
S0427	that kind of thing or they want academics to do the research and give them er the find you know
S0426	like your good self
S0427	like my good self but you've get to sign the official secrets act
S0427	in case we don't like the outcome
S0426	so you you may or may not have do one of those
S0427	i i'm afraid i couldn't say
S0426	i er could say
S0427	i'm afraid
S0426	it's
S0427	it's more than my life's worth
S0426	yes i i mean some of those
S0427	just if if you
S0426	er er
S0427	just by ask me
S0427	you know
S0426	i have compromise my integrity
S0427	there be a section er
S0426	yes
S0427	of guilt by association
S0426	iation that's right
S0427	i it's section forty two thousand five hundred and fifty eight
S0427	of the official secrets act
S0426	along with all the other section which you can't talk about either yes
S0427	people well who say there be section
S0426	oh yeah er what what act
S0427	so yes there we be yeah erm
S0426	i wonder how many of our students go into and not just from your course but from all out course go into the police one of my students want to already
S0427	yeah
S0426	she's tell me
S0427	yeah well
S0426	she's in her second year and she want to she's already
S0427	yeah well recruitment be pick up slightly erm even though they're still lose frontline officer but you know the
S0426	what what do the graduate go in as a beat officer like a bobby on the beat
S0427	you'll you'll have to at the moment still for the time be you have to join as a pc
S0426	but isn't there some acceleration
S0427	yes
S0426	
S0427	but at the moment even under the sort of erm elite system of
S0426	yeah
S0427	accelerate promotion you still have to join as a pc
S0426	but you be expect to do it for less time
S0427	you be expect to get to inspector after four five years or something like that
S0426	be that the next step up
S0427	no sergeant's the next
S0426	oh sergeant
S0427	step up
S0426	mm there's the
S0427	you've get to pass the exams
S0426	sure
S0427	and pass the interview
S0426	sure
S0427	but the idea be that they've er they've identify a
S0426	sure
S0427	you know your your rise star
S0426	yes
S0427	there be a it probably under the tories it might resurface but there be a little while ago a suggestion that in order to change the culture of the police
S0426	mm
S0427	and to give them skills that possibly they don't have in sufficient number at the moment people should be allow to join the police service much higher up the rank so this be the argument about well wouldn't erm er wouldn't er someone who's er lead a battalion and have leave the
S0426	oh
S0427	army at the age of
S0426	yes
S0427	say forty
S0426	right yes yes
S0427	er wouldn't
S0426	yes
S0427	he or she make a
S0426	yes
S0427	wonderful
S0426	yes
S0427	superintendent
S0426	yes
S0427	erm and someone who's be in charge of a medium size company
S0426	yes
S0427	wouldn't they make et cetera et cetera you know
S0426	of course the gut answer be no but presumably
S0427	and the lower rank wouldn't like it
S0426	well they wouldn't like it
S0427	that i'll tell you the more controversial
S0426	mm
S0427	suggestion
S0426	mm
S0427	and i don't see this come about but it's be
S0426	mm
S0427	float within the metropolitan police authority if you really want to recruit more people from ethnic minorities
S0426	yes
S0427	let them skip the rank of pc and sergeant now that of course be
S0426	mm
S0427	that would be see as positive discrimination
S0426	yeah
S0427	just
S0426	yes yes yes yes
S0427	in the way that the other one isn't
S0426	isn't yes that's interest
S0427	you know erm and and i think that would be even less popular
S0426	mm
S0427	amongst the er exist police personnel
S0427	there we be
S0426	it's it's such a well embed culture
S0427	it be yeah
S0426	that you rise through the rank
S0427	every chief constable in the land at the moment
S0426	have always be
S0427	have be a pc
S0426	mm be that true and er i think it must be true of the arm service that you can't join as a cook or major er well
S0427	no that that's not true
S0426	of course it's the officer class
S0427	you you can
S0426	yes that's
S0427	go in as an officer
S0426	okay that's
S0427	never have be a private
S0426	true
S0427	a sergeant
S0426	that's true
S0427	or anything
S0426	that's true
S0427	like that yeah
S0426	that's true that's true
S0427	there be a in the army
S0426	and in fact it's very unlikely that if you're a private you rise to the officer class
S0427	i think that be unusual yes it's not unheard of but it's unusual yes
S0426	so if that can happen
S0427	well it it's happen it's happen in in the navy and the army for a long time we i mean at one time if you remember in the navy people use to buy their commission
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	i i don't know whether they ever do in the army but erm
S0426	be the argument that the kinds of skills that the privates and sergeants have aren't necessary for the colonels and major and captain or what have you
S0427	i i don't know the answer to that erm
S0426	whereas in the police
S0427	it be always argue
S0426	those skills
S0427	that you have to have that on the grind experience to get a nose for what be
S0426	yes
S0427	go on
S0426	exactly so that's right
S0427	er that it i mean there's there's a great amount of emphasis within the police culture put on practical
S0426	right sure
S0427	experiential
S0426	sure
S0427	common sense kinds of approach to to issue
S0426	knowledge of the and so on and so forth
S0427	yes yeah that kind of thing
S0426	that's right
S0427	yeah
S0426	whereas the private in the army be not do anything comparable he she be be follow order in
S0427	yeah
S0426	a very large
S0427	yeah
S0426	degree they're not be send out in team let alone individually they be work in a very rigid framework so
S0427	yes
S0426	it's it there's an argument there that they're not actually learn anything which would help an officer
S0427	yeah that's probably be
S0426	unless it's a trade er
S0427	yeah
S0426	unless it's
S0427	i think that's true and the other thing be that although the police be also er er er a sort of a rank organisation
S0426	mm mm
S0427	and they've set great store by it erm what's different be that a pc always exercise discretion
S0426	right
S0427	you can't
S0426	right right
S0427	order a pc to do something
S0426	sure sure
S0427	so to speak there's always
S0426	well sure
S0427	the element of discretion
S0426	whereas of course in the army that's completely out of
S0427	in the army
S0426	the picture
S0427	you always take order from your whether it's from your colonel or whether it's
S0426	yes yes
S0427	from your sergeant
S0426	that's right
S0427	there be very little area for discretion
S0426	that's right
S0427	and people in battle who show discretion either get kill or they win the vc you know
S0426	mm yeah well that's right that's right
S0427	it's that kind of thing isn't it you know erm
S0426	yes and the entry qualifications i would have guess for a even an ordinary pc be higher than that for a private in the army i'm pretty sure that must be
S0427	they yes i mean you you can
S0426	that must be the case
S0427	go into the army with virtually no
S0426	with no qualifications
S0427	qualifications as you need
S0426	whereas
S0427	er gcses of a certain number i don't know what they be i think i it use to be six o level i don't know what it be now but it's er it's not huge
S0426	if it's comparable then that's different from the army i would have
S0427	it be different you i you don't i think the army you know you really need erm good character and that kind of thing but erm even that's
S0426	mm
S0427	i mean there there be certain crimes
S0426	mm
S0427	you could
S0426	mm
S0427	have commit
S0426	mm mm
S0427	and they'll still have you in the army
S0426	what about tattoo er the army take people with tattoo
S0427	yes
S0426	but
S0427	it do yeah
S0426	what about
S0427	and so do so do the
S0426	police officer
S0427	yes but they don't they wouldn't like it and you probably would get turn down if the tattoo be round your neck or something like that you know
S0426	fuck the police on your
S0427	yes that kind of thing it wouldn't
S0426	on your forehead
S0427	it wouldn't it wouldn't go down
S0426	oh that be a a mere bagatelle when i be a youngster
S0426	i didn't know quite i be do
S0427	so you're tell me you won't forgive me for
S0427	a youthful indiscretion
S0426	yeah come on
S0426	everybody make a mistake now and again come on it think of the credibility it'll give me you know on the street
S0426	and in the pub
S0427	right listen i have to go
S0426	okay
S0427	i have a student to see thank you very much
S0426	cheer
S0427	for the coffee
S0426	alright my pleasure as ever
