S0619	uhu
S0618	and you know i didn't gather that from the conversation that we'd have so anyway he fell out with me erm and he's be know to do that with other friends and family members
S0619	mm
S0618	throughout his life and i kind of in a way always wonder when it would be my turn because you know as as friends go i observe how he be not so consistent with other people
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and surprise in a way that he have be consistent with me over more than a decade erm so i'm not quite sure how it become my turn
S0619	mm
S0618	erm but yes anyway so that be that for the friendship and then months and months and months pass and i get a drunken barrage of texts after that i'm really sorry can you ever forgive me and blah blah blah so i say of course you know it's no problem you're a bite of a twat but i still love you erm and then that be the end of that didn't hear from him for months and then get a message today sorry to hear terry wogan's die i think of you kiss kiss kiss like nothing's happen
S0619	person to be associate with
S0618	i know when
S0619	my good friend terry wogan
S0618	well you know i
S0619	yeah
S0618	do like terry wogan of course but yeah i just think that's a little bite on the random side so
S0619	uhu that be random yeah
S0619	people who i've fall out with and there's only one person that i can think of sort of relatively recently i don't fall out i just sort of
S0618	yeah
S0619	stop talk to people
S0618	mm
S0619	not because of a reason just because that's how
S0618	yeah
S0619	life and friendships work and develop and relationships
S0618	you drift in you drift out
S0619	yeah yeah yeah sure er but there be er one of my friends he be my boss er when i work in one of my many retail job er we've know each other for years and we get on well er and he be have a birthday party this be last year so i'd come back home from poland for christmas er and he be have this party and i just didn't wanna go
S0618	mm
S0619	and i be like oh i should go but you know it be a fancy dress party which i'm sort of fundamentally against anyway because it require more effort than be
S0619	really necessary
S0618	i agree
S0619	do you know what i mean
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	i know it's sort of quite selfish
S0618	and people often spend a lot of money on these things
S0619	yeah but why would i wanna spend money on something that i'm never gonna use again
S0618	mm
S0619	i don't have the sort of it's not that i i'm obsess with time i don't have the time to hand make a costume
S0618	mm mm
S0619	i'm not a blue peter presenter i don't give a fuck erm and i just think oh you know what i can't even be bother and i'd have to sort of go on public transport in this costume or you know carry carry my costume in a bag and get change in the toilet
S0618	yeah get change yeah
S0619	and i just think this be a waste of my life er
S0619	say i'm er you know i'm ill i'm not gonna come i'm sorry sorry like i couldn't just say i should probably have just tell the truth and say i don't wanna become you know blah blah blah
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	erm you know he didn't reply but change his facebook status the next day and it be like well things like this you realise who your friends be
S0618	what
S0619	and there be like people upload picture of the party and there be like five people you know i suppose he have learn it's not who your friends be but it's just organise
S0618	mm
S0619	a difficult party
S0618	yeah yeah so be it his it be his party
S0619	yeah
S0618	that he be organise
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	so he maybe didn't have any concept of it be a difficult thing
S0619	yeah
S0618	for a lot of people particularly those that have to travel by public transport
S0619	you know and
S0618	yeah
S0619	it take age for me to go i'm really sorry i didn't come to your party blah blah blah and he be like it be so shit no one come and i be like well
S0618	mm
S0619	oh that's awkward but you know not to put all the blame on you it's your fault
S0618	mm
S0619	never organise fancy dress costume party
S0618	yeah
S0619	or you know party
S0618	and you can't make it up
S0619	yeah yes
S0618	mm
S0619	we've meet up since then but you know we've sort of fall out of touch again
S0618	mm
S0619	er but at least it's on good ground
S0618	yeah
S0619	as far as i know
S0618	kind of how it be with me and cos we sort of fell in again after his drunken apologetic text
S0619	yeah
S0618	but i feel like something's be lose
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	that probably won't be recapture i sort of feel a
S0619	yeah exactly
S0618	betrayal in a lot of ways
S0619	uhu
S0618	but it seem quite illogical and irrational to me when he say oh you're not my friend
S0619	mm
S0618	all over the flower incident
S0619	yeah but er yes and he delete lot and lot of people from facebook and
S0618	yeah
S0619	didn't talk to them
S0618	wow
S0619	i manage to survive
S0618	you survive the cull
S0619	i do but you know
S0618	that's funny
S0619	i think it's the sort of point of this be that don't have fancy dress party number one
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	don't have party where you have to for example pay a deposit for the venue
S0618	mm
S0619	have a party in a pub where you don't have to pay any money
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	you just go to the pub
S0618	and the pub be glad of the custom
S0619	yeah and everyone's a winner
S0618	mm mm
S0619	er but don't put any you know it's not necessarily about money but don't put any effort er don't put any money into something where there be absolutely no guarantee that people will attend
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	people say yes i'll come
S0618	yeah
S0619	isn't the same as them actually come on the day
S0618	yeah so he'd pay for a venue as well oh goodness
S0619	so i think that's another reason why
S0618	yeah
S0619	he be really piss off which you know it's every he's get every right to
S0618	have he fork out for a buffet or booze and stuff like that
S0619	i think yes i think his like mum have do a buffet or something
S0618	ah
S0619	i know it's really sad but
S0618	yeah it be he maybe would've be better off get a few friends to help him organise it
S0619	mm
S0618	and then the friends would've be sufficiently invest a to come and b to make sure a few of their friends also come
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	yes
S0618	oh well
S0619	but i mean i'm really against i'm really against party
S0619	but i be i've never have a party the closest i come to a party be when i be twenty one
S0618	mm
S0619	and we go to the race and we all have like a pie and chip and a pint
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah bet some money on some dog and then that be it we go home
S0618	oh i've only hold one i mean you know i've have dinner party and stuff
S0619	yeah
S0618	people in northern ireland don't really do dinner party so i
S0619	but i'd never like hire a venue i mean
S0618	no i've do that once that be erm cos me and run off and get marry we have a civil partnership in city hall
S0619	mm
S0618	and erm yeah we didn't invite anyone and that kind of suck but the key reason be 's elderly mother who's a staunch presbyterian
S0619	mm
S0618	and who at one point in her life have tell she be an abomination
S0619	mm
S0618	i think that be at the point where she'd be with the german who i'm still friends with he's a lovely guy erm for ten years and i think have plan in her mind of the beautiful baby they'd have together
S0619	mm
S0618	and the beautiful wed blah blah blah
S0619	mm
S0618	and then leave for and that's when it all get a bite pear shape
S0619	uhu okay
S0618	and be the evil alcoholic erm and she be there with her for ten years and i think that's probably when her cancer start
S0619	uhu
S0618	she should've get the hell out of there sooner but i don't think her parent or her friends really like it sound like she wasn't a particularly nice person so god know what be do with her anyway erm yeah that be kind of when that all all happen so when we get marry erm my mum be sick in the uk with cancer 's mum wasn't really very
S0619	mm
S0618	approve so we just didn't tell anyone
S0619	mm
S0618	then we realise we need a couple of witness erm so we ask and 's work colleagues
S0619	nice uhu
S0618	who be two of my g six girls erm they're great and so they come along as witness there be just the four of us that know so
S0619	nice
S0618	we run off and do it on a friday afternoon in city hall and a lot of it be about sort of get the paperwork because we
S0619	mm
S0618	have a fair idea that wouldn't live much longer with her cancer and in fact she make it another two years after our wed
S0619	mm
S0618	erm so we want to make sure we have that paperwork in place erm but it turn into you know we really felt something on the day which we be surprise to feel
S0619	mm
S0618	because we'd sort of think it be a tick box exercise
S0619	yeah just do it sort of mm
S0618	but it become more than that and then we think well hang on a minute you know we really need to be have a bite of a celebration and i and you know invite our friends over at least whether our families choose to come
S0619	mm
S0618	or be able to come or not
S0619	mm
S0618	so we actually have our a party erm we get marry in july twenty eleven
S0619	mm
S0618	have the party in may twenty twelve give everybody enough notice there's from south africa there be load of germans there be people from the netherlands so people come from all over the world and in the end erm 's mum and dad do come

S0618	and 's dad give a speech basically welcome me to the family
S0619	oh nice mm
S0618	and say how they be really happy that be happy and that be sort of erm quite an amaze moment really so anyway so that's a very long story
