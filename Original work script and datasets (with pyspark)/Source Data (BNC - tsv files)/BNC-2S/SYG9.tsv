S0037	sorry
S0115	think we be talk about uh to get
S0037	sorry i be just i be say about
S0115	to get we be talk a little bite about politics weren't we oh in
S0037	i be talk about immigration
S0115	the uh the id scan um
S0037	i dunno what it's like in like in europe there's not really any problem be there
S0115	that's a that's a hell of statement in europe there's not really a problem be there
S0037	no what i mean be i think can you still travel like within europe with just your drive licence
S0115	um uh well yeah cos europe's a
S0037	cos before you use to be able to travel with just a photo id
S0115	europe be a be a coast guard you know uh border control nightmare isn't it because you've get so many different little countries
S0037	yeah
S0115	with their own culture and languages and people and there's load of
S0037	but
S0115	it's really near to the middle east it's near to africa
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's near to russia the the the the there's all potentially dangerous source of uh illegal immigrants or terrorism or blah blah you know
S0037	but i'm sure you use to be able to travel just with your
S0115	and so it's a real nightmare like
S0037	if you're an eu citizen i'm sure you could travel just with like photo id like with your drive licence or your id card if the country have that i don't know if that's still the case now
S0115	uh well uh actually cos me and when i when i be live in uh in berlin um me and my parent be travel
S0037	yeah
S0115	and my parent be be you know kind enough to drive me to berlin from england so we have to go
S0037	yeah
S0115	we have to go in the channel tunnel you know through uh france but into holland and presumably into belgium as well on the way to holland
S0037	yeah
S0115	stop in utrecht that be just like a thing that we develop
S0037	yeah
S0115	stay in utrecht and then so we do that now um that journey uh obviously we one two three four five countries there so um do you get stop in no you certainly don't get i think within the eu you don't get stop
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh because poland's in the eu now we do get check quite when i travel to poland on the train there be quite a lot of like kerfuffle
S0037	yeah
S0115	and poland and germany history be slightly resist of each other yeah
S0037	well yeah well there be on the night train wasn't they they take our passports away for a while remember
S0115	yeah poland and germany give you quite a bite of like they they they do give you quite a bite of a check
S0037	when we travel on the night night train they they
S0115	yeah
S0037	d'you remember that when they take our passports for like fifty minutes and i be like i hope they bring them back
S0115	yeah i mean there's there's cos i remember some friends of mine when i be in berlin some friends of mine travel down it's not that far to prague and uh they travel on the train and they get like properly like stop and force to wait for like two hours or three hours or something and so they miss the
S0037	yeah
S0115	they the trip the return trip or something get totally um
S0037	yeah screw
S0115	totally screw cos they they be delay and they check the border between germany and czech republic at that time be be a real
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh i mean and this post like this isn't the this isn't the cold war any more this be like two thousands you know the noughties
S0037	yeah i remember when i go no but i remember when i go to um
S0115	it i tell you why it's because they be greek nationals add add complexity you see
S0037	oh right yeah
S0115	and i remember when i be in uh go to szczecin from berlin with go on the train um like they be like the germans be like um cos they they see that we're english
S0037	yeah
S0115	so they assume that we be go home
S0037	yeah
S0115	to to britain via
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	from poland to to germany um which we weren't uh but
S0037	on a jolly
S0115	they they be like they be think where they from england why they
S0037	yeah whey they be
S0115	where where be they go why be they go there
S0037	yeah
S0115	they like it be important you know to them like they're pay to basically try and figure out why people be go place
S0037	yeah yeah well that's their job yeah
S0115	and it's certainly much worse out of the eu
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh in term of yeah
S0037	i know when i be in uh when i be in switzerland um we be go to austria in the car and like the people who i be with say to me like just don't speak and like they take your passport but like the car will get stop and they'll look in and they'll speak but like if you just don't speak to them they'll not know that you aren't swiss cos if they know that you aren't swiss they'll have you out the car they'll wanna know where you're go and what you're do and what your plan be
S0115	yeah i um that sort of thing be quite a like feign ignorance be quite a big uh
S0037	so they say like just stay stay quiet like just say like you know whatever
S0115	yeah
S0115	and uh and um then it be fine
S0115	yeah i think that think that my dad get my dad get like properly frisk when he be on his own you see
S0037	yeah
S0115	he be travel to to pick me up on the return uh from paris to take me back home to england for christmas and um they they give it be like he have an estate he be drive a vauxhall vauxhall estate car and it be like uh probably quite a lot of random box you know and he he get he get fully like everything take out
S0037	yeah on his own like i be yeah yeah
S0037	but i don't but i think like i don't mind that it's annoy well it's annoy
S0115	he's just get that sort of look
S0037	well it's annoy but
S0115	you can i think
S0037	i think i don't really mind like oh
S0115	uh i think we we it's one of them things where you gotta wait for better technology to come like better technology you can scan scan the car somehow sniff it get a sniffer
S0037	yeah well they do do that though cos you like all those border
S0115	that that that that little weird that uh bee machine that i saw like
S0037	the what oh the sniff be oh you be tell me about that
S0115	the bee machine it be uh one of the strangest most amaze scientific that i'd see for quite some time
S0037	yeah d'you want some cream
S0115	the the bee machine uh nothing less than than sniff be
S0037	ooh sorry that's crazy
S0115	uh in a box that look like a little hand hold vacuum
S0037	but i've i mean
S0115	the but it's train train be train to sniff for drug in little tiny box
S0037	i know you tell me
S0115	in uh in a in a vacuum cleaner type
S0037	it be crackers
S0115	in the little compartments they put them they sit the be in like they strap them up like like like astronauts or something
S0037	yeah
S0115	these be sit in the put seatbelts on them and like more or less there's they harness them in little little
S0037	yeah
S0115	just imagine a bee that with its head pop out the top it's it's just surreal it's just amaze but anyway that that little box the highly train be can can scan for like coke and uh uh heroin and stuff like these be have be um
S0037	it be weird isn't it
S0115	uh so anyway yeah
S0037	but i think
S0115	uh better technology will allow to do better check with minimal uh discomfort to the uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	to the driver
S0037	i saw the i saw the thing sorry you finish
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	i saw a thing with um you know like watch all those like border patrol and um what they call sniff sniff dog and that
S0115	just just wait room vision
S0037	wait room telly
S0115	like yeah
S0037	but in that one they have a thing where like you know if they have like stowaways in a in a big lorry they can put like a thing in and see if there's any carbon dioxide in because obviously people breathe out they've get like a probe and they can like say if it's a lorry full of like bog roll or something anything bake bean
S0115	oh right to detect if it's full of illegal immigrants
S0037	they've get like a probe and they put it in and if there's any like if there's carbon dioxide in there then they're like oh and then they have to get get all the bake bean off the lorry and then find all the
S0037	immigrants or whatever
S0115	well um of course with every technological advance then there come uh the the increase in intelligence of the of the uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	of the criminal to uh to to counter to counter the advance so like uh
S0037	well they be say about um
S0115	so if you you be say that carbon dioxide well they're gonna have to create a uh put an air conditioner in the in the in the lorry
S0037	well they do where they put like they try and like cover themselves in bag and stuff
S0115	well they could breathe into like a
S0037	yeah
S0115	like a pipe and that could be connect that could pipe outside or something well
S0037	try and yeah yeah i think they've they've try all them sort of things but also um
S0115	yeah
S0037	do you hear about the news about those um like now you're gonna be able to like text someone excuse me text someone money
S0115	oh yeah i saw uh like barclays be do it be that an advert or on the news or something
S0037	it be on the news
S0115	yeah barclays be do it so that but they be say that actually these things be already in place in in countries that we might not have assume to be more advance than us but um
S0037	yeah africa yeah mobile phone be really popular in africa
S0115	yeah they mention kenya actually mobile phone be popular across the world i think it's because they're quite cheap to make and buy
S0037	mm
S0115	and they're really essential for you know
S0037	they're now they be d'you remember save by the bell
S0115	um sound like it might be more do that have a guy in it call cory
S0037	ah save by the bell like
S0115	do it didn't have a guy call cory in it
S0037	zack be the main character
S0115	be that it's not cory or something
S0037	zack he use to go when i wake up in the morning and
S0115	be that that little like kid with curly black hair
S0037	and then there be like kelly kapowsky who be like the brown haired sort of one
S0115	be it's a school drama right
S0037	then then and screech
S0115	be it like a school be it like a little kid with dark curly hair
S0037	mr belding screech screech power
S0115	what sorry
S0037	screech
S0115	what be you talk about
S0037	that's what he be call screech
S0115	the little kid with curly
S0037	kind of geek one
S0115	just uh like he look like he'd be in like some stephen spielberg film or something
S0037	i don't know but yes
S0115	he's the kid be in the in uh the the princess bride with
S0037	but then mr belding but thingy bob from that
S0115	yes
S0037	um she play like a sort of geeky girl and that go on to be in like showgirls
S0115	what's that
S0037	be it showgirls it's like a like a strip stripper sort of film about strippers
S0115	i dunno what that be um
S0037	she get curly hair
S0115	mm i don't really what be you uh i don't know what you're talk about
S0037	aw we're talk cross purpose
S0115	oh right i don't i just don't know um save by the bell be like a like a school drama be it
S0037	save by the bell be like a early nineties school american school
S0115	american bite like grange hill maybe but
S0037	i suppose like an american version
S0115	cos they don't wear uniform over there do they
S0037	no that's true um but anyway
S0115	kind of like the uniform cos i so i be always so badly dress
S0037	this be i'm get really far off the point but um
S0115	yeah yeah yeah
S0037	in save by the bell like zack have like a mobile phone but obviously this be like late eighties early nineties and it be like in a suitcase type thing like a massive like
S0115	like a satellite phone
S0037	like a massive brick with like a massive antenna
S0115	that that go on his back and have like a receiver that you just have to pick up from the
S0037	it be really big and he be like hello like i remember sort of think it be really but you're right mobile phone now you can buy them for nothing like five quid or something
S0115	yeah and and i know that they're really popular with um militias
S0037	with what
S0115	militias militia
S0037	uh right right
S0115	arm people who take money to carry out military operations
S0037	okay
S0115	uh what would you call them insurgents or terrorists or
S0037	ah right but everyone like mobiles though like i say
S0115	like they use the mobiles to to like obviously coordinate themselves and
S0037	but like they're snoop on aren't they all like all those sort of phone call be i'm sure of it
S0115	uh they can be but but but not maybe not fast enough though
S0037	yeah but i think if they know that you're a target like they follow you don't they
S0115	yeah um
S0037	they they would they would trace all your call if they think you be a threat
S0115	yeah the the the monitor will like all all mobile phone call be um ultimately able to be monitor aren't they
S0037	yeah but i again like i don't think i've get a
S0115	but it would depend on the on the politics of like i mean for example if you're osama bin lade
S0037	yeah not
S0115	and you're live in pakistan and uh you're make some texts send a text um
S0037	yeah do he really do texting
S0115	get get um
S0037	re plan lol
S0115	yeah like uh see you uh at at the at the uh rally
S0037	well he didn't go anywhere
S0115	ay
S0037	compound come round to my compound tonight
S0115	have to burn rubbish again sad face
S0115	um yeah he's uh burn his rubbish well we use to do that i mean
S0037	my wive be busy make dinner lol
S0037	it's probably really distasteful make sort of bin lade text joke
S0115	anyway yeah if you're ben bin lade uh you're in pakistan so pakistani you know pakistan telecom
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh be uh it's get your uh your text
S0037	your detail
S0115	obviously um
S0037	your number
S0115	and if america then want to scan pakistani text message because obviously there be a hell of a lot of uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	anti american
S0037	feel
S0115	militia in uh pakistan uh so
S0037	and elsewhere
S0115	america's then gonna have to try and buy that stuff off the telecom the perhaps and the government might say you can't have our stuff
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos we're a sovereign nation don't want you have telecom detail then america would say okay why don't we just give you a very large amount of money
S0037	yeah here's some weapons
S0115	and then they'll say okay uh we've we've think about it and uh so that that's the sort of thing i imagine basically if you've you've get money on you you can get any any phone detail but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but yeah there be i mean i hear a debate um about id card and there be a lot of there be some quite powerful sound arguments against id card and uh
S0037	i suppose my thing my worry be like i don't need an id card and a drive licence and a passport and a european health insurance card and a
S0115	yeah i mean that that's the pro argument isn't it the
S0037	like if they can roll all those together into something that be fine
S0115	yeah i mean no like
S0037	i think you'd probably still have to have your passport cos they need to stamp things on it don't they but
S0115	i mean the the essence of it be be that you've get to have
S0037	can your drive licence not be it though
S0115	you've gotta have a massive database but you've gotta be
S0037	because what information be on your drive licence like let me have a look because
S0115	i dunno
S0037	the you only really add to need to add a few more things don't you like what have we get name um date of birth place of birth address signature picture i need to get that change actually don't i
S0115	your your picture which be uh notoriously uh dodgy because it only have one eye visible um
S0037	i need to get me i need to get me name change
S0115	yep it's it's it's not get your full title there it's not get your uh
S0037	probably have to pay though don't you i'm not gonna pay to get it
S0115	i think we have
S0037	when do it expire it expire in twenty fourteen maybe i'll just wait
S0115	well yeah i mean yeah so
S0037	that's bad that you have to get it change every however often
S0115	yeah so as we be say i mean like if you want to drive to germany from here you'd only get your passport check in britain to france
S0037	be that when i pass my test when do
S0115	you'd only you'd ony get your passport in um in britain and france
S0037	but what i mean be
S0115	actually britain
S0037	what i be say before be that i think you can do it with just your drive licence cos it's get your picture of your face on
S0115	within the eu uh maybe you can
S0037	two thousand and when do i pass my test
S0115	but you wouldn't no you can't get uh get to france with just a drive licence
S0037	i think you can
S0115	you can get to ireland it's hard enough get to ireland no you can't get to france with just a drive licence can you or can you
S0037	i don't know i have a feel that you could maybe i'm wrong
S0115	i'm not sure i doubt i wouldn't i wouldn't leave without a passport if the
S0037	i know
S0115	i think that would be that would be tough but well maybe you probably
S0037	maybe i should change my title
S0115	yeah you can drive all the way to germany but if if you want to go into uh poland i'm pretty sure they'd they'd stop you there
S0037	cos i've only change my name on on some things like i have to be careful like on so when i be book my flight on ryanair they be like title and i be like oh i'll have to put miss because i haven't change it on everything like i haven't change it on my drive licence and i it's not well it doesn't have it on your passport
S0115	so i guess you'll just have to introduce your your new title like at some point and you'll have to
S0037	i need to i need to
S0115	change all your all your detail
S0037	it's not on my bank card or anything
S0115	yeah i think it make a lot of sense to put thing together but the the problem i mean some of the arguments against uh id card get tremendously uh
S0037	and like your blood group like you should have your blood group on there maybe in case you have an accident or and whether you wanna give your where when you give your organs
S0115	yeah no no you see like what thing the id be if it's implement properly like you know use the eye scanner or a finger print scan right
S0037	yeah
S0115	um you'd have you would have a massive database but the the the trick of it be that only the relevant information be available to each person like
S0037	yeah
S0115	the the guy who want your medical record like a doctor
S0037	yeah
S0115	he can't see your criminal record
S0037	yeah
S0115	similarly you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	the passport guy customers can't see
S0037	how many fill you've get
S0115	your your your medical record your dental record or whatever like but they can see what they need to see so if you have an id database you'd have to have all of that information there link with your fingerprint and your iris scan
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh and everybody'd
S0037	but they do they do link
S0115	but they would have something very uh have to be uh very uh careful to make sure that you can't access information that you're not allow to have
S0037	yeah but they do link your your fingerprint now with your passport cos mine mine when i go as i say when i go to america they do that there
S0115	yeah
S0037	they'd put all your finger on on the screen
S0115	yeah i mean no i think it make sense i mean
S0037	and the picture of your face and that
S0115	i think you you just have to embrace that sort of the idea that uh that you're gonna have to show who you be and your birthplace but i mean obviously
S0037	i don't think it's a big problem
S0115	there's a lot of there's things associate with um there be risk associate because uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but obviously um you know with there's things like dna evidence at crimes and um
S0037	yeah
S0115	you know you could appear to be uh present at the scene of a crime that there's some dna but in reality you weren't and stuff like that and uh so um
S0037	i'm sure they must take those things into account
S0115	things like like drunken like a lot of police patrol look for drunkenness don't they in the the town centre or whatever but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	of course you you could do something when you be or when you be a teenager or something and like you obviously wouldn't want
S0037	everyone to always be on your record
S0115	uh you wouldn't wanna you wouldn't wanna criminal record you know
S0037	maybe that would be a deterrent though like not to do stuff
S0115	um
S0037	to know that it would follow you around for all your life
S0115	well yeah uh i dunno i think there'd be a lot of i think if you if you're if you're drink then you know that's one thing but the but uh it's actually a slightly different question because that's a question of whether the state be gonna prosecute you if you if you've basically
S0037	yeah expose yourself
S0115	bar your bar your bottom to people on the street
S0037	yeah
S0115	late at night when you be drink or something do you then like do the state decide to prosecute for that but they they probably but cos it's a silly thing to prosecute someone for but that sort of incident
S0037	no how many time have you see that though like when you're out and about people just do that sort of naughty things
S0115	have some sort of moon uh yeah a fair amount i mean
S0037	or like have wee up side of
S0115	well that's a that's a that's a necessity i suppose you know
S0037	i know but
S0115	things have get to come out somehow uh but yeah i mean that's what the the the public and they try to get public urinals and stuff don't they
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh and then the the the uh portaloos be it the the
S0037	where be it we saw where they have that
S0115	the the portaloos the you know
S0037	where be it we saw that have like
S0115	um in soho i think they have like the they have urinals that sort of
S0037	pop up that's right yeah
S0115	pop pop up out of the grind think it i think that's soho
S0037	at night
S0115	yeah i mean it's i mean i think everyone's everyone's be there when they when you
S0037	when you need the loo it's horrible isn't it it's a horrible feel
S0115	the toilet and uh like uh desperately try to find somewhere but uh
S0037	yeah it's not very nice
S0115	uh no like well yeah so so i think but it's it's a tough uh tough thing to do the ids but i think there's the sentiment overall be against it because of because of the sort of sensationalist things that people
S0037	i think i think the thing that put me off uh the plan that be introduce a while ago be that they be like oh and it's gonna be eighty pound or whatever so i'm not pay any more i pay like pay eighty quid or whatever it be to get a
S0115	for a eighty pound for what a new passport
S0037	eighty quid to get a passport thirty five quid to get a drive licence like it's just sort of i don't see why you should have to have to pay whatever it be to get an id card if you already pay for this that and the other like unless you're gonna decommission one of the things and not have drive licence no more or anything
S0115	yeah well i think if you do it you'd have to make it compulsory wouldn't you
S0037	mm
