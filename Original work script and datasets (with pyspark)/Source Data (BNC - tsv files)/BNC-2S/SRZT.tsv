S0420	so i i didn't know you be go away i what be it for
S0367	well the plan be it be i be mean to go to glencoe so i'd be check the weather forecast for the last week the weather be mean to be okay so it be mainly just to get a few picture take for the calendar for next year
S0420	be this just yourself
S0367	yeah just myself just one day er leave early in the morning come back afternoon time but as the week go on the weather forecast get worse and worse
S0420	oh
S0367	so yesterday's forecast be to be heavy snow so the trouble be if you go past you've get the snow gate
S0420	yeah it can be close off can't it
S0367	so i could probably get there fine the snowline come down and i'm stick up there
S0420	ah well there's worse place to be stick ain't there
S0367	there be but when you don't plan for it
S0420	yeah
S0367	erm and especially up there be as remote as it be and the lack of place
S0420	yeah
S0367	you don't really wanna be leave er with nowhere to go so
S0420	yeah especially with what you're carry you've not get a four by four or anything have you
S0367	no we've not er traction control's about as much as it be thank you cheer so decide
S0367	yeah thank you so change the plan still go up about as far as tyndrum but safely stay south of the snow gate so i i could still get strand by i know that at least the gritters would get as far as the snow gate er should it get any worse so that's what i do go up there yesterday er
S0420	what time do you set off
S0367	leave just after eight in the morning the snow get
S0420	it be what it be light by then or
S0367	no well
S0420	or
S0367	it be still it be still dark it be mean to be light by the time i get to stirling but because the the snow be that heavy it be still
S0420	be it really heavy grey cloud
S0367	grey dark
S0420	yeah yeah
S0367	er so the snow be really heavy come from about stirling head towards calendar it be get worse snow be lie on the the road like so the traffic be down to about twenty thirty miles an hour so i end up take about two hours just to get up to where i need to get to so yeah but it be a good day if snow be on or off but i have to abandon eh go up there but it be a single track road leave the car in the car park head off to
S0420	be that the one that the end of loch erne no
S0367	no er before loch erne so you take a leave and you head up a single track road to where rob roy's grave be
S0420	yeah yeah i've be there yeah
S0367	so but at the end of balquhidder you've get loch voil which then lead into another loch at the end of that
S0420	ah yeah that's that's the one i be think of yeah
S0367	to climb so have a few plan to do er get a few picture take along loch voil the weather there be worth than it be anywhere else so turn back within about twenty or thirty minutes of be there i have to dig the car out cos the snow be honestly the snow be that bad
S0420	jesus
S0367	clear the car get all my stuff off go to set off and have to clear the car again cos it be that heavy
S0420	so you be like stick in the snow you have to do you have a shovel or
S0367	i have well take a shovel with me just in case i do get stick so dig the car out make sure the
S0420	you weren't panic at any point
S0367	oh no no no no it be a good day out it be fun so have to make sure the road be clear cos no one have be across the road erm and then i set off once the car have be clear for the second time and head across to loch erne it's only about five miles away but the difference in those five miles have be a bite lower lower down the the weather be different
S0420	the hill can cut off some of the weather as well couldn't they
S0367	yeah eh where er balquhidder be it's right at the end of a valley so it just seem to be come straight down the valley and you couldn't even see up the valley you couldn't even see loch voil it be that that bad i've get
S0420	do you do you come across anyone else or be you the only nutcase out there
S0367	i be probably the only nutcase but the other folk i do see be locals and i do get a few kinda strange look as if they say like what be you do up here eh by yourself eh even you're not go to work we be just stay in for the day especially the fact that i have my camera bag and my tripod eh they could obviously see why i be there but i think it still the weather be that bad and a single track road where the gritters don't go i think they be kinda like you'd better get yourself away soon
S0420	yeah yeah and so i saw one of your photos on facebook with the er the robin
S0367	the robin
S0420	that's beautiful how how do you get so close or be it with the zoom
S0367	er no no it wasn't even a a zoom lens just at the start of loch so it's just north of calendar there's a wee car park at the start of the loch so i pull in there eh and no one have be in at all cos there's the grind be freshly cover in snow so i walk straight down to the waterfront and i be set up my my tripod and a few other things and this robin come and land on the wall we have my bag so right close by this point i'd have the camera out and it be probably about as close as we be across this table that's how close it be so i kinda stop stay still and to make any movements in case it do manage to take a couple of picture and then eventually fly away it be
S0420	that that one that you post be that as it be or do have you edit it
S0367	no we have that one actually post i go after it initially take the the picture when it first fly up take other picture then head off visit a few other place and about four hours later when i be leave i nip back into the same car park
S0420	to look for the same robin
S0367	no well not not for the same robin but just to get a couple of other picture cos although i'd be down there before the way the weather be go the wind be er quite strong it be blow the cloud so it be change kinda how look from when i be there in the morning but at this point there be two or three other folk out with their cameras at the same spot so go down to the same spot again and the robin it actually end up be
S0420	so he be pose for the photos basically
S0367	well it turn out there be actually two robins the the one that come up to me first the second time i be there take a few picture and that's the picture that you saw so there's be the only edit that i've do be just kind of increase exposure just to give it a bite more light with the rest of it it's nothing's be do all i've do be
S0420	the the colour be really rich and and and what do fur er no feather feather haven't they yeah
S0367	eh so all i do be crop the picture to get it closer eh to the robin and give it a bite more exposure just to brighten it up but nothing else have be do to the picture but whilst i be there that fly away the robin which i think be the same one come back so i've take a couple of other picture but it be only when i go home and be do edit that i discover that the second one be a different one because it be miss
S0420	it be different
S0367	no it be miss one or two of its red feather
S0420	ah
S0367	so it be like it have either catch it on something or have be attack
S0420	ah okay
S0367	so i have kind of like a a grey patch in the middle where red feather should have be so it so it turn out it be two but there must have either be eh friendly cos they be come so close to you
S0420	so they be use to people be at that so it's a car park so they're use to
S0367	well it's a car park
S0420	noise and cars and people and stuff
S0367	yeah the only other thing i can think of be with the weather be so bad be maybe the lack of food and maybe be just chancers think that we'd leave something but
S0420	yeah maybe sit on the bonnet of a car engine that's be run for a while that's nice and toasty on your feet if you're a cold robin oh very good
S0367	yeah no that so that i get that at the start and at the end on the way home before head off so it be a good day
S0420	yeah and then so what other set of picture do you get
S0367	well remember we go and walk erm ben vorlich
S0420	yeah
S0367	and we park at the side of loch erne
S0420	yeah yeah beside the camp site
S0367	beside the campsite now the opposite shore erm you go through lochearnhead and further along and there's another wee kind of car park so park there so it be overlook ben vorlich climb so you could see right up the the kind of valley that off in so one minute you could see the hill two minutes later it be absolutely cover with a white cloud eh snow
S0420	yeah well it change so fast there i mean we've experience that as well didn't we
S0367	yeah so i go down to the shoreline on opposite side just set up the camera and just kinda stand there for about half an hour watch the kinda wind change the landscape so i've get a few of those picture that they're go onto the website today so you'll see them tonight er it's actually surprise although we climb it and get to the top so that when you see it from the other side of the loch actually how steep and big the hill be
S0420	yeah i didn't really feel it when we be walk up
S0367	no
S0420	it be just that last little
S0367	the last
S0420	twenty metres or fifty metres or something
S0367	plus the fact on the day we climb it's once you get to a certain level they lose sight of everything because of the mist
S0420	yeah
S0367	so it doesn't give you that
S0420	you don't get the full effect
S0367	the full effect but see it from a different angle
S0420	yeah
S0367	full of snow eh it be pretty big pretty impressive so eh we'll still need to go back next year and do the next next one that we manage not to do
S0420	well we we need to do the three hill in one day but in a twenty four hour period that's that's the ultimate challenge
S0367	ah the what be that be that snowdonia
S0420	snowdonia be it scafells pike or something like that
S0367	oh in the lake district no in the yorkshire dales
S0420	some or or the peak i don't know
S0367	peak district
S0420	i don't know and then er
S0367	ben nevis
S0420	and ben nevis in one day but that would be something to document in a like a photography project as well wouldn't it
S0367	thing be you could i think you'd be better start off at you'd be better start off at snowdonia start off in the morning there cos what i've know some folk in say that it's twenty four hours you've gotta climb all three
S0420	yeah
S0367	so you couldn't start on the top camp overnight at the top of snowdonia
S0420	no no you've gotta climb all three of them in twenty four hours but erm yeah like you say that would be some photo project like a big you know one of these coffee table book or something
S0367	yeah eh especially i'd hate to imagine all the the rubbish strew over someone's car in between journey
S0420	i know eat mar bar and lucozade to get
S0367	in their pool but no i think i think be able to do that i dunno when you mention it someone start to eh ben nevis
S0420	yeah
S0367	i think you would be better start the other way start at snowdonia then do the one in england and with the light in summer
S0420	oh yeah
S0367	cos you'll then
S0367	then do the ben nevis
S0420	okay
S0367	eh
