S0192	there up there now
S0227	i do tend to go up that way a bite
S0192	yeah
S0227	but i don't erm take much notice and that if i be plop further down there at that roundabout and i just be just wake up so that they say where be you know i'd know it now but if someone have say do that to me where i'd just be away when before it be all build and they just put me there i wouldn't know where i be
S0192	no
S0227	and i be only a few yards away from a few hundred metres away from where i use to live
S0192	yeah definitely when i be erm come back from the airport mum be like oh there's a school that's be build around here now and i kind of have to double take and it take me a few moments to really really register where i be at that point
S0227	that's right yeah where you be yeah
S0192	it's a bite weird and it's change quite a lot around this way
S0227	it be
S0192	you go further into there's no change at all
S0227	no
S0192	but this be the rich area wasn't it
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	it be on the cusp
S0227	this be they're about to build on the inside of the bypass
S0192	yeah
S0227	so this be what they've do and they're build all over here if i
S0192	i mean they're not they're not bad house
S0227	oh no they're very nice
S0192	they're all quite nice yeah
S0227	yeah they're very nice and they're well think out and space around so
S0192	so do it kind of up the area a little bite or
S0227	erm well it's not downgrade it but
S0192	no cos i be worry when they be gonna build it be all gonna get more scummy round here or something but
S0227	well i think we should build some social house but i don't know well i think they probably have to build some social house
S0192	yeah
S0227	but erm
S0192	some of that house be cos it's quite nice
S0227	yeah but erm but the architects er of of today seem to put more think into design
S0192	yeah
S0227	they don't they don't look like all erm erm all rabbit hutches or design
S0192	no there's a block there
S0227	through through the haze of bong smoke or something and they be all all on crack
S0227	at the time cos back in the sixties
S0192	yeah
S0227	you wouldn't get the architecture of the sixties and seventies
S0192	be terrible isn't it
S0227	yeah it's awful
S0192	almost communist or something isn't it
S0227	the the the town hall not the original town hall but the town hall i be in that mum be in
S0192	that grey big it's a monstrous grey build yeah
S0227	be completely demolish
S0192	oh good why be that
S0227	the flats have go in throughout yeah the town
S0192	yes
S0227	the bus station
S0192	not all of them but some of them
S0227	yeah some of them be go
S0192	i do notice that that have change
S0227	yeah
S0192	that be a bite strange
S0227	they've get average speed cameras down here not so you have to watch your speed as you go down here
S0192	oh fair enough
S0227	average ones and they've get er average ones in as well
S0192	yeah
S0227	just come up to the average ones here
S0192	do it mean average speed
S0227	yeah so you erm it
S0192	never hear of that
S0227	so you clock er down so he'll er er this camera this camera erm come up on the right
S0192	yeah
S0227	will clock our speed go and the one at the end will clock and take an average if we're over thirty odd it will get a speed ticket
S0192	oh fair so you get er two
S0227	yeah so that one there and then you've get another one at the other end
S0192	seem a bite slow for this road
S0227	well it be a forty
S0192	thirty
S0227	it be a forty
S0192	oh a forty down to a thirty
S0227	yeah they've erm change change it
S0192	why doesn't there's no school here be there
S0227	er i don't know maybe someone be kill along here
S0192	right
S0227	normally there
S0192	not very residential
S0227	there's normally a fatality or something
S0192	mm
S0227	tend to er change it
S0192	it's not a money maker then i take it that if you get a ticket it's get nothing to do with make money it's not a
S0227	oh no
S0192	not a monetary fine it would be
S0227	yeah it's a definite monetary fine it's a system to make money yeah sure
S0192	at thirty i mean this be ridiculous you
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	you might as well automate this there's no point in drive be there
S0227	but it ha
S0227	they erm
S0227	they can't really take it down to twenty cos twenty you know and get speed there be twenty
S0192	you could
S0227	they've get twenty zone
S0192	you could cycle at twenty
S0227	yep there be twenty zone but i don't think they'd ever ticket for go over twenty cos er to be honest you'd be be overtake by bicycle
S0192	yeah it's difficult to stay at twenty isn't it
S0227	it would be a bite ridiculous yeah
S0192	oh
S0227	so thirty be the be the
S0192	yeah fair enough
S0227	now the camera be back there i think
S0192	so you can speed up a bite
S0227	so i mean it's never one i don't i get shoot when i get in once because i'd hear there be cameras go in i didn't question where they be cos i me of all people should know where the well i i work with the highways and i get up not the last christmas but the christmas before that
S0192	yeah
S0227	and the one thing one of the guy um and er as we be drive through as i be drive through he go you know slow down mate there's average cameras i go what he go average cameras i say crap this be like the end of january when do they come in he say i think i think it be about the begin of january i think oh my god i'd have be go home every day i i didn't come this way to work but cos i go through because it's not the school holiday er
S0192	yeah
S0227	school term but i be come home this way every time and i be think jesus christ you get so use to the route every day you don't think about it you know where the gatso camera be
S0192	yeah
S0227	well so you didn't take any notice i think additional sign and that but fortunately i never get catch so i'm alright
S0192	you obviously drive well enough regardless of know that the cameras be there
S0227	well i be think i could i could have potentially up to about ten ticket which which four would put me up would ban me
S0192	come through the post yeah yeah it would wouldn't it
S0227	i be um i know they've gotta arrive within fourteen days of of it be do
S0192	so you're alright
S0227	so every day after that i er be sweat in february
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	that year i didn't get one but i sweat
S0227	yeah fuck hell
S0192	not a good situation to be in
S0227	no because you're think oh my god
S0192	you lose your licence you lose your job don't you i mean what do they do
S0227	yes
S0192	you need to drive for your job
S0227	i need to drive yeah
S0192	what would happen in that that situation
S0227	i think if i'd lose my licence i'd just go off and stress and they wouldn't even know about it
S0192	no yeah don't tell them
S0227	no
S0192	really really stress
S0227	yeah just go off and then
S0192	cos i lose my licence
S0227	go off
S0192	you lose your licence for a little while though don't you
S0227	yeah
S0192	a year or
S0227	you'd lose it for a year yep
S0192	you can't stress er off on stress free
S0227	yeah well er i'm not ironically but in coincidentally um i've be back to work a year yesterday
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	and that it's go very er very fast
S0192	yeah
S0227	i can't believe it a year have go
S0192	how long be you off for
S0227	twelve weeks
S0192	yeah
S0227	twelve weeks i i stay longer and make them suffer i make i punish them for the stupidity a stupid decision
S0192	yeah that be when they try pile you up with much too much work
S0227	yeah
S0192	and ridiculously terrible time
S0227	yeah i mean and redundancy straight redundancy as well so it be all kind of er and then be allow to do i be still responsible for my tidy up the loose end of my old job
S0192	yeah
S0227	which be where the other people be start new job with clean slat i wasn't i be throw into an area that have be sadly neglect er increase fifty per cent in size and that fifty per cent come from the other area that be neglect me and
S0192	so it need a lot of work
S0227	me and get throw in there and yeah with that and er and especially go blind be very erm be quite i could have handle the work
S0192	it doesn't get much more stressful do it
S0227	yeah i could have handle the work if the if the work hadn't change
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos i do before erm because i have a solid you know you you stand on two feet and you kick one away you can potentially stand on one but if you kick both legs away
S0192	yeah you fall over
S0227	you've get no leg to stand on like er no er rudder no
S0192	and you're still not sleep great
S0227	er yeah i sleep fine as long as erm
S0192	you're exhaust
S0227	as long as i it's it's a mental thing i'll sunday night i'll go into 's room and then i'll stay in 's room until well i've i've slightly progress come i've be guide to come in on a thursday so he stay in his room which i could go in the front room but i don't i'm pretty tire but if be to come sooner i'd be er and like by monday if he come monday i'd be go i'm not near tire tire enough i'd have to go and sleep in the front room which i don't particularly wanna do
S0192	no yeah fine
S0227	so
S0192	but be move out soon be he

S0192	so it wasn't the same weekend that we're move out
S0227	no
S0192	yeah i be confuse about that
S0227	all his stuff all his er his er er he wouldn't have get the van anyway because the van's not big enough for him he's gotta get he's get a fridge freeze which have to be move upright wouldn't have go in the van
S0192	no okay ah so it didn't matter anyway
S0227	no
S0192	what kind of van be we look at here like a transit van or
S0227	yes a transit van yeah
S0192	you know if you see one as we go past
S0227	yeah
S0192	the same kind of dimension the same kind of size point it out to me
S0227	i i i think it's a normal standard transit van erm it's one of the ones they're sell erm say it should bar an incidents and and then nothing go wrong with with the any of the work
S0192	that kind of thing
S0227	like yeah like that
S0192	okay
S0227	with the with the
S0192	like that
S0227	no no not
S0192	not a truck a flatbed no
S0227	no no erm he say bar incidents and accidents he say you know that suddenly i's only pull the van if like the ones they're use break down at the last minute and they need it otherwise we're sell it
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's have erm you know a new engine put in it it's er they've decide to launch it
S0192	so it should be run fine
S0227	well hopefully it's have a rebuild on it so
S0192	um
S0227	they say it's burn a bite of oil
S0192	do you have to pay for that
S0227	no it's just the just the fuel
S0192	just the fuel cost
S0227	just the just the fuel
S0192	and you're happy for me not to come back up
S0227	well no i'll take cos it'll be a day out for er otherwise you've gotta spend money and get all or get your arse back up here again to go back down again where
S0192	i mean it's not a cost thing if you're worry about like cos it's
S0227	no it's no no
S0192	for some reason it's thirty five pound one way
S0227	yeah
S0192	or forty pound return
S0227	yeah
S0192	so it's only like five pound more
S0227	yeah
S0192	i've already spend thirty five quid so
S0227	yeah
S0192	if you need me to come up i can
S0227	no it it it be good for
S0192	if you don't then it's it's probably work out
S0227	because it give an opportunity to see where you be
S0192	yep
S0227	and er it's a for him cos he's he's not do anything he's just
S0192	i mean if you leave fairly early then cos you'll have the van the day before i presume on friday
S0227	er i don't
S0192	friday night
S0227	i'll have to i'll have to i'll have to know that cos i'll be pick it up from
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0227	so i
S0192	be that close
S0227	i'm not sure how i erm there's a barrier to take it's not it's not an industrial estate where they they've get the company
S0192	oh right
S0227	erm so erm i've gotta nail it with with how how i'm gonna pick the van up and then what we'll do be we'll we'll um well we can go out for something to eat
S0192	i'm say if you come down
S0227	and then we'll come back saturday night
S0192	yep if you come fairly early then we can have food then
S0227	yeah
S0192	maybe even lunch and dinner
S0227	so yeah cos it's er ironically now this this be ironic be that when i come to you a year before i be there in brighton on a stag weekend
S0192	oh
S0227	we be at 's wed
S0192	have the
S0227	we have yeah 's stag weekend
S0192	oh be around
S0227	er he will be round on friday
S0192	cool
S0227	because er he's help with the erm with the move
S0192	and be still in obviously
S0227	yeah be in erm
S0192	he'll be there for dinner
S0227	er probably not tonight no i think he's do something else
S0192	oh
S0227	he's not for the past while he's not be in for many meals and plus he's have like he's on some kind of a strange diet and him and keep chop and change what they're eat
S0192	thing or whatever it be er
S0227	i don't know what er i've lose i've lose track
S0192	ha
S0227	other that the diet and them move on but i mean he do er he's only fat in his head
S0192	do he think he's fat then
S0227	yeah cos you know he's fat in his head he's not fat anywhere else
S0192	do he still do his like referee or whatever
S0227	yeah he still do that he's he's get stuff
S0192	be he get pay for that
S0227	yeah er but he doesn't do it as regularly as he use to he's still suppose to be go to tanzania to do this cycle thing
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	so er
S0192	yeah when's that
S0227	er er october
S0192	oh so it's definitely go ahead
S0227	yeah i don't think he'll be fit enough for it but he hasn't train so he's not go to be use to the altitude or the heat
S0192	no
S0227	not in tanzania it's about five five degrees off the equator and it's at altitude that's gonna you'd notice that when um
S0192	how much altitude do you know
S0227	it's probably about four five six thousand feet a lot higher than here
S0192	feet into metres
S0227	er er metres divide it by three
S0192	oh so about two thousand metres
S0227	yeah
S0192	so ha it might not be too bad actually i mean the altitude at two thousand metres isn't enough to
S0227	no
S0192	make you really short of breath
S0227	no
S0192	and it will probably just take the heat off from
S0227	yeah
S0192	the be on the equator i mean i've be about two thousand metres in the equator it's a comfortable twenty three
S0227	yeah
S0192	twenty to twenty five degrees
S0227	yeah
S0192	kind of like a nice hot
S0227	yeah
S0192	summer's day in england
S0227	yeah yeah so obviously the higher you er it start heat up yeah
S0192	as you come down it will get it will get so it might be okay
S0227	yeah
S0192	it might be
S0227	i've just guess the altitude all i know be it's a damn site higher than here
S0192	i mean i know kilimanjaro be there isn't it
S0227	yeah that's
S0192	and that that go up to about six thousand metres so
S0227	yeah
S0192	obviously there's some pretty big elevation
S0227	and
S0192	i wanna go there myself
S0227	right they're do some they're i think they're um cycle something like about five hundred miles in about six days or something
S0192	oh wow
S0227	day after day after day after day and he hasn't do that kind of
S0192	no yeah i'm not
S0227	stamina train
S0192	that might be a bite
S0227	yeah i mean i cycle just under three miles i haven't do as much i've do more this year than i've do for the year before definitely and the year before that combine
S0192	yeah
S0227	and i'm a bite
S0192	hey you don't look er you don't look fat

S0192	yeah definitely that's alright
S0227	i saw your mum the other day
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	and er er she obviously look at me and think the same thing but i look at her again you'll probably notice this yourself cos you don't see like us for a a length of time

S0192	yeah i think we're all look older
S0227	she couldn't see my eye cos i have these on

S0192	think i look older
S0227	really
S0192	have balloon
S0227	have she
S0192	yeah she's get bigger
S0227	i dunno she use to be quite er when she be young she be quite slim
S0192	yeah she's not slim now
S0227	what's she now
S0192	she's like a humpty dumpty or something
S0227	yeah
S0192	she's this little round thing
S0227	that big
S0192	she'll lose it again apparently but
S0192	she's she's balloon since i last see her
S0227	yeah it's also erm erm what's this call erm the menopause
S0192	yeah
S0227	you know it make make women barrel body
S0192	they're have a lot of problems with i don't know if you've hear about anything or
S0227	i've hear something about but erm
S0192	or hear from him or
S0227	i mean kind of erm remove himself from from the moral high grind where he be sit comfortably he decide to erm i er accord to he's not really shape up as much as er of a grandfather
S0192	no he's he doesn't he doesn't talk to the cousins or their children basically at all
S0227	it's you mean his own children
S0192	his own children yeah pretty much at all
S0227	have he like disassociate himself with them
S0192	he's er yeah i mean she er like saw him in lidl's the other day and like call out to him and he completely ignore her
S0192	so er just er they've have a fall out he er basically who he's with now or something doesn't really want anything to do with his children and have make him kind of make a decision and he's decide her
S0227	her or them
S0192	over the children yeah effectively
S0227	yeah
S0192	so they're they're all quite annoy about that
S0227	it's a it's a poor choice and and a bad choice when you put erm sex over erm over kin
S0192	yeah but it happen
S0227	obviously he's
S0192	i guess he's a bite black and white
S0227	he's
S0192	think well i've do my duty and
S0227	yeah he's he's he's a bite hurt but then again he er he he you know his his daughters do erm i can't speak for but and be firmly behind him and not behind their mother
S0192	yeah
S0227	so they didn't have some support so i don't know you know sometimes er erm men be influence by their partner your grandfather be he be a closet racist
S0192	yeah
S0227	but erm when he marry
S0192	it be who be
S0227	be er once you get them together they feed off each other's prejudice and they be basically totally yeah if if she had've if she hadn't have be like that and she be not not have a problem with it she'd have probably have say don't be so stupid it's your it's your grandchildren but she be racist too
S0192	yeah
S0227	that be all that he need and perhaps be at a crossroads where he be think do i stick with this or not but it's it's erm it's erm i it's a wrong decision if you ask me because
S0192	oh yeah definitely
S0227	it's his children and his grandchildren erm they will probably forgive him in time because it the there be a dynamic that erm you can treat your children like shit and they'll just keep come back for more
S0192	yeah
S0227	they want acceptance but erm it's a risk it's a risky game and and if it it it doesn't pan out with this woman or something be to happen to her he's get a lot of grind to make up because
S0192	yeah
S0227	he's give it all back to if she's there for them now they'll forget her her erm
S0192	past indiscretions
S0227	her past indiscretions yeah because she's there
S0192	yeah i think they pretty much have by the by the look of it now
S0227	yeah but er yeah
S0192	they're much more on her side
S0227	he have the position and the er he just give it away just trade with her
S0192	yeah
S0227	now he's the villain of the piece
S0192	yeah i dunno why he's do that
S0227	no i i they say like no reason to i i didn't go and see him i well i i kind of i've tie all my all my tie be tie off
S0192	yeah say i go and saw she's live in some tiny little house you know
S0227	be she i hear she's go back to erm i think she must have be watch er erm spartacus
S0192	yeah
S0227	where they be kind of er to you to paraphrase those word cock or cunt
S0192	yeah
S0227	and erm i think she's go back to the former rather than the latter but i may there may be an update on that
S0192	no i think she just swing whichever way she want to
S0227	do you mind if i wind the window down be she live with someone or by herself
S0192	i think she's live by herself as far as i can tell i think this weekend i'm gonna see the cousins i'll go out with them
S0227	right
S0192	she's go down er be go down to devon of course she doesn't speak with now at all
S0227	she doesn't why
S0192	no erm she blame him because when she decide she be a lesbian apparently he just cut off from her but what i can gather from mum they just both cut off from each other it wasn't
S0227	yeah i've
S0192	that he say anything to her or do anything they both use it as an excuse to
S0227	yes
S0192	not really communicate any more after that
S0227	i don't think erm
S0192	and too she doesn't see or talk to at all but mum do
S0227	yes well there be always a connection between your mum and there be a a bond not blood but a bond
S0192	they live together didn't they
S0227	erm er no they never actually live together but they erm be very young
S0192	do you hear about 's dad
S0227	yes i do
S0192	yeah
S0227	yeah that be um yeah that be a bite sad
S0192	do you hear about erm and 's old friend as well
S0227	erm no i remember big goal guy yeah
S0192	yeah massive guy
S0227	yeah
S0192	he erm hang himself while his child be he be with his child he say i'm just go out to the garage to get something his child go out to see where he be about ten minutes later
S0227	and find him
S0192	and find him still alive like
S0227	oh right
S0192	squirm on the on the the hangman's noose and er run scream to help people but when people come it be too late
S0227	no it's a terrible thing yeah
S0192	what a horrific thing to do
S0227	yes that would erm
S0192	i mean er if life really be that bad okay disappear somewhere tell your family you're go on holiday and then just disappear or something
S0227	just disappear yeah yeah
S0192	you know what i mean don't do it in front of them
S0227	no
S0192	and you could even do it in such a way where they're not sure if you've if you've do it or not
S0227	yeah
S0192	maybe you just die or er something happen
S0227	must must have be a botch job because um hang someone be i mean hang er properly so that their neck break um you have to have to know you have to know what they weigh
S0192	tie the knot correctly
S0227	and yeah and calculate the length of drop because otherwise if you get it wrong there's a good and the drop's too long there's a good chance the head literally come off
S0192	oh my god
S0227	which happen with one of saddam when they be
S0192	saddam yeah
S0227	when they be execute saddam's lot
S0192	yeah
S0227	they do that to one of them erm if you get it wrong the other way they don't die by er c2 snap they die by slowly by strangulation so obviously cos he's a big guy
S0192	that's how i think he die yeah
S0227	he be a big guy he obviously it should have snap his neck but it didn't so he be then suffocate
S0192	maybe it do snap his neck and he be just jerk i mean afterwards or something
S0227	it would no if it be c2 it would have paralyse him from the neck downward he wouldn't be able to move
S0192	so no movement whatsoever
S0227	yeah he wouldn't be able to move
S0192	be there no muscle reflex
S0227	i think you would have see that in erm in hannibal the second he where that guy erm be
S0192	it be pretty dark
S0227	probably be eat his own face
S0192	yeah
S0227	he snap his neck
S0192	yeah
S0227	he he do kill him
S0192	that's pretty dark
S0227	yeah i like hannibal
S0192	yeah it be good
S0227	i like mads mikkelsen who play him because we've
S0192	he be in jam bond wasn't he
S0227	yes he be le chiffre in erm
S0192	the guy that bleed
S0227	casino royale
S0192	out of his eye wasn't it
S0227	yeah casino royale le chiffre erm with the original with play by erm anthony hopkins you just see hannibal as a as a intelligent manipulate erm person you don't see him be charm
S0192	no where be the psychology
S0227	whereas mads mikkelsen come over as be very charm very well you know he's not but
S0227	he come over as be incredibly er sane not insane
S0192	mm
S0227	yeah so he play the part well
S0192	too sane mm very flamboyant in his eat his culinary desire
S0227	well yes and his presentation immaculately dress
S0192	yeah
S0227	his cook skills you know he have have passion in his work
S0192	yeah no it's good i like it
S0227	yes
S0192	it's quite dark
S0227	yeah
S0192	and interestingly film as well
S0227	yeah
S0227	yeah no i i do like that
S0192	can you watch that one quick
S0227	do you watch yes i do yeah wasn't into it
S0192	no
S0227	no
S0192	i didn't think she would be
S0227	if can draw a conclusion very quickly and she her mind won't change
S0192	no
S0227	i can start off with something and go mm and then i think
S0192	give it time
S0227	give it give it time for character to develop and stuff like that and then er erm
S0192	it's too graphic for her i would imagine
S0227	yeah
S0192	would she um be up for play a game i know she probably doesn't like battlestar galactica but she like board game though
S0227	she like board game she'll give it a i guess she'll give it a go
S0192	yeah if there's the four of us tomorrow
S0227	yes okay
S0192	it's a good four player game
S0227	okay er erm
S0192	yeah have tell you about it i guess
S0227	no he hasn't
S0192	cos i say to him
S0227	no cos

S0227	no
S0192	i've get a a friend's buy me a board game battlestar galactica
S0227	no he didn't mention that
S0192	you play on the on the battlestar and you move around and do different things
S0227	okay
S0192	and one person be the cylon but he's undercover so you don't know who the cylon be
S0227	oh right okay
S0192	it's quite good it take a few hours to play though
S0227	okay
S0192	like a good like three hours i'd say want to play it so
S0227	okay do you watch erm game of throne
S0192	yes yeah
S0227	i'm on series four
S0192	you're not finish it yet
S0227	no
S0192	no
S0227	i like tyrion he's very good that little be very good
S0192	yeah yeah peter dinklage his name be
S0227	he's good the i think he be in erm erm the film with erm oh i think it's call bruges
S0192	bruges in bruges yeah
S0227	and he be and erm erm what's he call collin farrell give him a karate chop
S0192	yeah i think you're right i've know about that in retrospect but i haven't actually see it again
S0227	yeah yeah he's a he's a good actor
S0192	yeah he be good have you see the scene where he's in court
S0227	no
S0192	no he's really good in that you'll see
S0227	yeah no i haven't see it he have come out with some great line and give great line to work with
S0192	yeah it's directly from the book
S0227	oh okay
S0192	i be very surprise when i read the book think how quotable it be pretty much all of the dialogue in the
S0227	be
S0192	especially in the third season's book
S0227	oh
S0192	the fourth season they start to deviate a bite
S0227	oh right
S0192	now they still use stuff from the book
S0227	yeah
S0192	but they've make more of their own stuff
S0227	yeah
S0192	but like the first two three season pretty much directly everything they say be directly from the book
S0227	yeah yeah yes yeah doesn't like it cos of the profanity
S0192	no
S0227	and and in er series four it's really quite profane
S0192	yeah well
S0227	the the language get worse as the series go on
S0192	well it's i think because they've deviate
S0227	yeah
S0192	more from him
S0227	right
S0192	they be add some i don't know what they're do with the season actually because they've come to the point now i've read all of his book
S0227	yeah
S0192	there's about six thousand er page it's ridiculous
S0227	right right
S0192	he's get two more book to come out
S0227	right
S0192	and he hasn't finish them and it take him about five or six years to write a book
S0227	mm mm yeah
S0192	so at the minute he do as you can tell in the series they have different stories you follow different character
S0227	but they're all thread aren't they
S0192	yeah they're all thread together
S0227	that's the clever part about it be they
S0192	yeah
S0227	er they're all head to a a a point of of convergence
S0192	yeah
S0227	that's the good thing i like about it be that there's i wish i'd think of it there's sort of all separate plot
S0192	yeah
S0227	but you know they're all tie by a single theme and a single they're all gonna end or meet at a single point
S0192	at a head point yeah
S0227	further in time you know that's gonna happen
S0192	although quite a few of them die
S0227	yes
S0192	don't they yeah erm there's a theory that fan believe i don't know if you've come across it but they claim that john snow be actually the air to the throne and he wasn't ed stark's son he be the son of sorry ned stark he be the son of ned stark's sister
S0227	right
S0192	elina stark or something marry to the old targaryen king
S0227	okay
S0192	and ned er have be keep this promise by hide this son amongst
S0227	oh right
S0192	his own prodigy
S0227	oh right
S0192	erm when in fact he's not actually his son so that's
S0227	oh right
S0192	and george r r martin have recently say that fan have actually get his end correct
S0227	oh alright
S0192	but he hasn't say which fan theory it be
S0227	which yeah yes
S0192	but he's grapple with whether or not he should change what happen in the book
S0227	yes
S0192	because he's apparently he's be be put lot of subtle clue in about what where it's go
S0227	right
S0192	and so his fan have pick up a lot
S0227	yeah
S0192	the evidence and put it at that as the end or something
S0227	i say it's it's very it's very good i wish i'd write that those book
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	oh god they might be from
S0192	it's quite historically base as well
S0227	yeah
S0192	he um base a lot of his character on real people from
S0227	yes
S0192	you know history
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm and i do like it but what i be say about it i don't know what's gonna happen next so he's already write five book
S0227	mm
S0192	he's get two more no he's already write six book
S0227	so be there so be there a series five to come
S0192	he's get two more there's well this be the thing
S0227	so i i
S0192	some of their stories
S0227	i'm about four er five episodes into series four
S0192	yeah i don't know what they're gonna do because there's two more book they've get all these character some of the character for example sansa and bran and these kind of character
S0227	yeah
S0192	they've reach the end of their story
S0227	yeah
S0192	and i can go i've read as far as they as he's write
S0227	yeah they haven't
S0192	they have no
S0227	yeah
S0192	no further to go
S0227	yeah
S0192	whereas aria and a bunch of other people john they have quite a bite more story leave to do
S0227	there's more mileage
S0192	so they haven't be run it the same as the book
S0227	no no
S0192	the book be all inter thread chronologically
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	but they focus on some stories and
S0227	yes
S0192	and speed others up so
