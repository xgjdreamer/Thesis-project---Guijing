S0255	be you tire
S0255	how be this even
S0256	yeah it be good it be alright we do learn to skate but we have to do the new warm up for the new course so that be interest
S0255	what do you mean what's the new warm up
S0256	erm the new course skate skate excellence which have take the place of learn to skate we get to wear these jazzy boot cover and erm we have to do like a warm up with them so they get warm up for their lesson basically that they have and then they have so much lesson time
S0255	so what's the point of the boot cover
S0256	erm they've get like leave and right on them and then they've get different colour to correspond with edge and things like that
S0255	oh right so as you say to warm up you sort of say
S0256	you go onto your orange edge your yeah
S0255	oh right
S0256	but it's erm confuse me
S0256	my brain it doesn't work that way so erm
S0256	yeah i'm not find it the easiest
S0255	oh never mind
S0256	but er it's okay i'm sure i'll get it seem to think i'll get it
S0255	yeah you usually do it's just sometimes your brain take a minute or two longer or a bite longer because of the leave right thing as well doesn't it
S0256	yeah well they've get l and r on the boot and you have different colour gloves on each hand for leave and right
S0255	yeah but leave and right doesn't help you cos your brain think of leave and as be the right one because
S0256	yeah
S0255	that's the dominant one
S0256	i know it just get easily confuse but er it'll be alright i suppose
S0255	ah
S0256	in the end i just i'm struggle with the idea of colour and do things like that
S0255	yeah cos i suppose you just do a certain move without think of it as a colour so when you have to think what colour be that move
S0256	yeah but it's also just the way that my brain learn things so it
S0255	mm
S0256	it erm i learn better from watch and have things break down slowly
S0255	mm
S0256	than have if you tell me to go into the tightrope position and then cross my leg and and make the orange edge edge touch
S0255	yep
S0256	that doesn't make sense to me whereas if you break it down and do the move slowly and i'll watch it and then i get it and then i can do it
S0255	mm so do you think do you find then with the people that be learn it on the learn to skate course do you spot the ones that be struggle and maybe try and show them how to do it
S0256	well we've we've not get any actually do it at the minute cos we've our level isn't do it the girls we've get on our level
S0255	oh right
S0256	aren't actually do it yet it's the new ones that be come in that be start it we just do the warm up with everybody cos they want to do it for some reason erm
S0255	mm
S0256	the problem be though you've gotta stick to the course you can't it's not as as easily adjustable as learn to skate because learn to skate you get tell the move
S0255	right
S0256	and then you teach the move the way that you teach it
S0255	yeah
S0256	whereas this be now more you do this with the colour you go onto your orange erm orange line and then you go onto your green line and stuff so we'll see i mean i've not actually have
S0255	mm
S0256	any experience of anybody learn it yet but we'll see
S0255	yeah i suppose cos everybody learn things differently so that actually isn't necessarily gonna cater for everybody
S0256	no it's very base for kid and it's
S0255	oh
S0256	it's be design by a woman that's get dyslexia so for her it probably make sense the whole way to learn but for me
S0255	mm
S0256	it's my idea of my nightmare way of learn cos i if you just tell me something so just
S0255	mm
S0256	if you teach me how to do a for example er a a crossover and you say you take your leave leg you push out you cross your leave leg over your right leg
S0255	mm
S0256	hold your right leg under and you move it out
S0255	yeah
S0256	er when i first learn wouldn't wouldn't be able to do it
S0255	no cos for me by about the second bite of that be say i'm try to think well hang on which be my right leg my which the leave
S0256	yeah
S0255	er to to what but what do you say
S0256	yeah whereas if i watch it really slow
S0255	yeah
S0256	then i get it which be
S0255	yeah that's what i i tend to learn more like that
S0256	yeah i say to cos she didn't realise but it take me a good year to actually figure out what i be do with my arm in the cool down er at at
S0255	mm
S0256	at erm cos we do sort of lemons where you push your legs out and then bring em back together again which be simple
S0255	yeah
S0256	but we do arm with it
S0255	mm
S0256	and i couldn't figure out which way i be do my arm with my legs and it take me a good year to figure out i say most of the time i just wave my arm around
S0255	yeah
S0256	just sort of bring them round cos er it's like bring them round your your body which i understand but i don't know whether i'm go in or whether i'm go out or
S0255	mm
S0256	what i'm do and when i'm push out what i'm do with my arm take me age and she say why didn't you say something i go ah i figure it out
S0255	well yeah exactly
S0256	just take a while
S0255	and if she'd say oh you do this this and this you'd go but that actually wouldn't have make a lot of sense
S0256	no
S0255	so you just wait until your arm be in sync
S0256	i struggle with think out which way my arm
S0255	with what everybody else's arm be do
S0256	yeah my arm which way my arm go across my body and aware of what my legs be do at the same time
S0256	sorry
S0255	oh sorry i'm tire
S0256	i'm tire
S0255	mm what time be you go into work tomorrow
S0256	haven't decide
S0255	that be such a good thing with your flexitime isn't it
S0256	i know probably like aim for eightish eight half eight
S0255	mm
S0256	cos rainbows start back tomorrow
S0255	do it
S0256	yeah
S0255	erm er you haven't do a plan meet have you
S0256	nope haven't get anything plan
S0255	have have have you get any new starters
S0256	no just do a game night tomorrow
S0255	yeah and ideas as what you could say to the rainbows
S0256	i've get load of ideas

S0256	they bake
S0255	yeah
S0256	they like bake
S0255	yeah well you could have the great rainbow bake off
S0256	yeah we'll do something i'll plan something i just haven't get the motivation to do it at the minute
S0255	no
S0256	but
S0255	do they come back to you about the account
S0256	no i'm still wait for it back and i need my my account back cos i need my pay in book back and i need my cheque book back
S0255	mm
S0256	so i'm just still wait on that
S0256	but hey
S0255	hey i've be shop tonight
S0255	i decide i need to buy some boot for the winter
S0256	shop from the comfort of your own home
S0255	well that's how i do all of it now so i decide i need to buy some boot but before i start buy boot i saw there be twenty five percent off on top so i have to look at the top
S0255	because obviously there's twenty five percent off on the top er so i find a few top and then i start think about er the boot but actually i want to get some new jeans to go with the boot so then i look at all the jeans and
S0255	and get some jeans and then i look at boot and then i think actually what else do i need i need underwear so in my save items
S0255	not that i'm necessarily go to buy all of them cos i think i'm gonna fall off my chair in a minute when i see thirteen items oh it doesn't say total that's probably good actually
S0256	bag zero
S0255	yeah no that's it cos er it drop out the bag after about erm after about an hour or something
S0256	stop move it
S0255	sorry see those shirt right
S0256	yeah
S0255	use to wear those all the time with jeans
S0256	yeah
S0255	and they're come back in and this be why they say whatever you have with fashion if it's still good don't throw it away what be you look at
S0256	i'm add
S0255	oh oh gosh no don't do that that's too scary
S0255	so they say don't throw it away cos it'll come back
S0256	yeah
S0255	it's like now all the bootcut and flare jeans be come back
S0256	yeah
S0255	so i'm obviously have to get some of those although i do actually save one real good pair of my bootcut jeans
S0256	yeah
S0255	so
S0255	i have still get them
S0255	i just need to get the the boot to wear with them
S0256	yeah
S0255	be you still add oh no what shall i be scar
S0256	we'll see in a minute i just need to concentrate while i'm add
S0255	one two three four
S0256	no don't distract me
S0255	thirteen items
S0255	how much
S0256	i'm there and it's three hundred and fifty
S0255	ah
S0256	erm so three hundred and fifty and then four hundred and twenty five four hundred and thirty five hundred and ten what's that five hundred and ninety five so let's do six hundred and five six hundred and twenty seven pound
S0255	and i'm gonna get two of those
S0256	six hundred and thirty seven pound
S0255	six hundred and thirty seven pound
S0256	so probably a no to all of that
S0255	well no well i'll get it and then i'll only keep one pair of boot so i've get three pair of boot and i'll keep one there's four pair of jeans and i'll keep one maybe two and i potentially could keep all the top oh this one here look at this this top the t shirt say vague right and it say youth be waste on the young
S0256	ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
S0255	i just think that's really funny and then it say here oh no it say here on on on the side bite there erm it say er be yourself everybody else be take
S0255	i think that's really good
S0256	on your boob
S0255	yeah on your boob at the side mind you people be gonna come and go what do that say
S0256	yeah
S0255	and i'll go no
S0256	totally unfit
S0255	ah it'll be alright so er i'm gonna order these and then they'll come and it'll be cos see like i say to i get free next day delivery so it'll all come well it'll be tomorrow so therefore it'll be what's today monday tuesday wednesday get it wednesday and i get free return so it's just like shop at home it's like you go and rather than take in armfuls of clothe to the change room to try everything on i order this this this
S0256	yeah but you do actually have to pay for them
S0255	order a couple no but you take it into the change room try it all on and then decide what you're keep then go to the till and pay for it
S0256	mm
S0255	this way this be my shop and i'm look buy try like try try choose choose choose choose different size different colour if i think maybe cos the jeans some of them i'm not quite sure exactly what size then they'll all come i'll stand in the bedroom with big floor to ceiling mirror things on the wardrobes
S0256	yeah but you still have to pay for them initially
S0255	yeah but if i've get the money in the account
S0256	i know i know i know i know
S0255	and then try everything on then send it back free
S0256	i haven't send those jeans back yet
S0255	haven't you you need to do that or else they'll charge them to you well they have do
S0256	it's alright i'll just do an exchange they usually exchange they don't mind how long you have it until you exchange
S0255	i'm sorry
S0256	i just i don't know whether to send them back or what to do cos
S0255	well do you like them or not
S0256	yeah but they don't fit
S0255	well well there's no point keep them then
S0256	no they're not far off though but so i can
S0255	so do you think you need to exchange for a bigger size or you just think hopefully you'll get into them
S0256	i don't that's the problem i'm in between size at the minute
S0255	well exchange for a bigger size if it's too big send it back and then in a few weeks
S0256	yeah
S0255	order again cos it
S0256	yeah
S0255	if you buy them and keep them think oh i'll have them when i get into them that could be six months before you get down actually just that er cos although you'll lose weight and tone up more the little bite where you need where you need the weight maybe on your stomach or on your hips
S0256	yeah i know i just annoy cos like i say erm i'm in between two size
S0255	mm
S0256	so my ones i've get at the minute be too big and fall down but the ones that be smaller er they fit
S0255	mm
S0256	but they're just a bite tight on my tummy
S0255	yeah
S0256	so cos they're low rise where they sit doesn't look nice
S0255	mm
S0256	but i'm in between
S0255	i don't like low rise cos they tend to
S0256	yeah
S0255	squeeze in and pop out the bite you don't wanna pop out over the top of it
S0256	i don't mind them
S0255	no i like high high waisted jeans
S0256	when i sit down er they're fine
S0255	or the medium rise ones
S0256	i need to get some new leggings as well cos my leggings be too big they're fall down see
S0255	oh yeah well you've so you've definitely lose weight so you should treat yourself to some new clothe
S0255	but the trouble be though you you look at the different size and you can get a ten a twelve or a fourteen and fit in all of them in different shop
S0256	i know
S0255	different size it's just ridiculous
S0256	mm we know my problem with jeans they don't really design them for bum
S0255	no
S0256	jeans be design for no bum
S0255	yeah
S0256	because they give you the material for no bum when you've get a bum you get a size that's big enough to fit your bum but fall down
S0255	mm
S0256	and then i can't i don't like wear tight belt so
S0255	but it's like you and have get the in between if you could actually share
S0256	yeah
S0255	make one pair of jeans
S0256	yeah
S0255	cos she's short with no bum
S0256	yeah
S0255	and you're tall like long legs with a nice bum
S0256	mm yeah
S0255	i must admit i be very lucky with jeans cos i do just have the right shape for them
S0256	mm you do just fit into them
S0255	i do
S0256	that's why i wear jeggings cos jeggings just stretch
S0255	mm
S0256	and then i can wear skinny jeggings and they look fine try skinny jeans and it won't work cos i can't get em up my leg
S0255	mm
S0256	so i just live in jeggings but i'd rather not like in jeggings i'd rather get some jeans but cos they last longer jeggings don't last long
S0255	no but they be cheaper than jeans usually aren't they be they
S0256	some aren't the ones i get be like about the same price as jeans
S0255	oh right
S0256	but they do last they're good quality the ones i get from asos they they last quite well but
S0255	mm yeah but i can't wear
S0256	keep buy them in in the in the like can't remember what size it be cos they've change their size like thirties and or not not
S0255	er mm yes i know that but then next to it it do say size ten or something
S0256	doesn't on the ones i buy
S0255	oh well it have on the ones that i buy
S0256	oh cos the ones i buy whatever it be would be
S0255	there's there's some which be size ten to twelve so i think oh i'll just try those as well
S0255	just in case erm i can't if the ten's no good usually it be
S0256	mm
S0255	but then sometimes i'll get ten and i can't get it up my legs
S0256	yeah
S0255	and you think well i be
S0256	mm
S0255	a ten but never mind
S0256	i don't even know what size i be any more
S0255	no the thing be
S0256	not really bother
S0255	it it doesn't matter the size itself doesn't matter and that's the point
S0256	it do
S0255	but you need to have that as a guide cos you need to try and say i like those in that size please
S0256	it do i refuse to buy anything above a fourteen ever
S0255	do you
S0256	because i'm not above a fourteen so
S0255	well you're not but just if they make something and they decide it's a sixteen
S0256	i just won't buy it
S0256	out of defiance
S0256	it be it's defiance
S0255	i'd chop the label out
S0256	it it doesn't matter i know what they be
S0255	yeah
S0256	and er i i don't want to
S0255	no
S0256	cos i'm not a size sixteen so i wouldn't buy a size sixteen
S0255	well no you're not a size sixteen
S0256	so i wouldn't buy one
S0255	no
S0256	so therefore it's defiance and i will not buy it it's like rebellious
S0256	i'm rebel against the designer makers
S0255	yeah oh goodness ah oh i'm tire so that's it i think i'm gonna go to bed
