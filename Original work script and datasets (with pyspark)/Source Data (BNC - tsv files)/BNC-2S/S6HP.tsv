S0303	later that's even more fascist
S0303	it's true isn't it
S0303	oh look it look like a little creature
S0262	it be a little creature it's even get furry erm blue bite but i don't need that that's only for when it's windy apparently
S0303	that remind me of erm you know i've get the half brother in
S0262	thank you
S0303	who's mad
S0262	oh well yes
S0303	i mean he's not mad mad
S0262	this be the yeah
S0303	but i think he be mad
S0262	yeah
S0303	he just hasn't be diagnose but he think he's he buy into all these conspiracy theories about how the government's spy on you and everything's a plot
S0262	crikey
S0303	and everything's be control by somebody or other but it's all very vague
S0262	right
S0303	and i don't know whether it's because he take drug now he doesn't admit that he do whether it's because he's take a lot of drug in the past
S0262	right
S0303	or because that's just his personality and temperament
S0262	yeah
S0303	but just that remind me he tell me this story about when he be in the new terminal five at
S0262	right
S0303	heathrow or something
S0262	yeah do you mind if i smoke
S0303	no go for it go for it
S0262	okay
S0303	erm
S0262	i buy some cigarettes
S0303	i've get some somewhere i think as well
S0262	oh i've get load so if you wanna smoke mine that's absolutely fine
S0303	and he say you know the reason they've build the new terminal five don't you and i say what so they can have more plan come in and out i wasn't be facetious i just think well
S0262	just think that would be one of the reason
S0303	presumably i don't know like there's so much yeah it's not really something i
S0262	unless it's like to show off that
S0303	it's not something i've ever really
S0262	we can build a new terminal
S0303	dwell on or
S0303	it's actually not something that's ever cross my mind even for a fraction of a second and he say don't be facetious
S0262	oh so what do he think be the reason why
S0303	mm don't be facetious i actually genuinely wasn't be facetious
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think he be ask me a question and i think this be a bizarre question but then i'm totally perplex by people most of the time
S0262	yeah
S0303	water off a duck's back he go it's it's it's so they can spy on you
S0262	right
S0303	it's so they can spy on your they've embed with these cameras and he say when i go to the bathroom i could see on the mirror i could see how it be work by the mirror so i go up to the mirror and i go fuck you
S0262	alright
S0303	and be say to him
S0262	at least that be in the bathroom
S0303	i say to him but if it be record you then you've just totally draw attention to yourself
S0303	and you're gonna be handcuff and lead away
S0303	and then the other thing i be think that i think be really funny
S0262	that would really make
S0303	you know a lot of people
S0262	him even more paranoid
S0303	well exactly
S0303	but you know a lot of people who be really
S0262	yeah
S0303	nervous flyers aren't they
S0262	yeah
S0303	they get really anxious about
S0262	yeah
S0303	step outside their zone
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i be think imagine if you're feel really edgy
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you just you know you're wash your hand just try
S0262	yeah
S0303	to take a deep breath and cool down
S0262	yeah
S0303	and this maniac emerge from the cubical
S0303	or the urinal
S0262	go
S0303	or whatever it's like
S0262	there's a two way mirror
S0303	yeah
S0262	there's like cameras that
S0303	fuck you
S0262	fuck everybody
S0303	so the but i'd be tempt to alert someone you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know cos
S0262	yeah yeah i think that's what happen to people on plan
S0303	mm
S0262	and that's why people get all you know
S0303	yeah
S0262	quite upset because
S0303	it just remind me if he saw that oh my goodness
S0303	he'd go potty
S0303	and if you don't agree with him he get really
S0262	so he live his life by
S0303	hostile
S0262	a conspiracy theory
S0303	yeah
S0262	pretty much
S0303	lot of people be like that
S0262	it's true
S0303	and i always say to him
S0262	i've sort of i've manage to avoid them somehow
S0303	i say well let's just say let's say everything you're say be true hypothetically
S0262	mm
S0303	it wouldn't make any difference to the way i live my life
S0262	no
S0303	i'm still gonna wake up in the morning
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm still gonna go to work i'm still gonna try to be
S0262	yeah
S0303	friendly to people
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm still gonna enjoy go for a walk i'm still gonna enjoy
S0262	yeah
S0303	go and see a film
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know whether or not the world's control by
S0262	yeah
S0303	giant lizards be really neither here nor there to me you know i don't
S0303	maybe you be right maybe the
S0262	yeah
S0303	moon land be fake and maybe the
S0262	yeah
S0303	kennedy assassination wasn't what we be tell maybe it be the twin tower story be i don't care
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know maybe it's true maybe it's not true i don't know
S0262	yeah
S0303	i wasn't there
S0262	there's no way of know anyway so
S0303	i would imagine most of them aren't true but
S0262	yeah
S0303	probably by law of average some of them be true
S0262	yeah
S0303	by law of average
S0262	that's true yeah
S0303	if you make up a thousand conspiracies
S0303	by law of average you're gonna hit the nail on the head once but but i don't understand why worry
S0262	but which what which one yeah exactly
S0303	why not try to sort your own life out and
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	stop alienate everyone by your
S0262	yeah
S0303	awful behaviour
S0262	and take up so much of your head space
S0303	yeah
S0262	could be better serve something
S0303	and be bar from restaurants and be bar from hotels you're so rude and abusive but it's
S0262	oh no
S0303	never his fault and
S0262	oh right it's the conspiracy theory
S0303	he's actually very i i find him very likable but he's
S0262	what's his name
S0262	right and he live in
S0303	he live in he live in near
S0262	and you visit him there
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0303	i actually like i mean i like
S0262	yeah
S0303	his company he's quite fun to be around
S0262	mm
S0303	but for short periods
S0262	yeah
S0303	he really like overload your
S0262	yeah i can imagine
S0303	i don't know what to call it something between your soul and your mind and your brain it's really war whereas the sister be
S0262	yes
S0303	a pretty kind hearted person
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but she's really hard go
S0262	yeah you you tell me about how
S0303	she wear me out ten time more than him
S0262	mm mm yeah yeah
S0303	cos at least he's get something to say
S0262	yeah
S0303	even if it's derange you can just sit back and
S0262	and sort of let him talk but you don't have to
S0303	and he have enthusiasms
S0262	interact
S0303	as well which be nice
S0262	yeah
S0303	he's like
S0262	yeah
S0303	really enthusiastic and then he'll be really enthusiastic about something and then it'll fall out of favour
S0262	right
S0303	and then he'll have a new thing
S0262	yeah oh so he's a bite up and down yeah
S0303	yeah he's just
S0262	yeah
S0303	like over
S0262	yeah
S0303	manic
S0262	yeah okay yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	and how long have he live out there for
S0303	he's live there for something like fifteen years and
S0262	oh right
S0303	and the story of how he go there be quite funny in itself
S0262	right
S0303	erm you know he use to be in that he's be in the that
S0262	yeah
S0303	that use to like so
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think he get into that rock and roll lifestyle
S0262	yeah
S0303	but even when he be no longer rock and roll he be still in that mindset
S0262	mm
S0303	so he always use to like these really pretty young girls
S0262	mm
S0303	and they be always really nice
S0262	right
S0303	i think i've meet four of them
S0262	mm
S0303	when i say young i mean ludicrously young
S0262	yeah okay yeah
S0303	and so he fell in love with or want to canoodle with or
S0262	yeah
S0303	want to control and destroy
S0303	er a girl who he meet
S0262	right
S0303	when he be about fifty and she be
S0262	right
S0303	twenty
S0262	right
S0303	but she be so he follow her to
S0262	oh
S0303	and because she be catholic and old fashion it wouldn't have really be appropriate for them to live together
S0262	right
S0303	so he be stay in a hotel or something while she stay with her mum
S0262	right
S0303	and they sort of meet
S0262	okay
S0303	and i think the family accept it but they have to go through the motion of oh it's just a friendship or i don't really know
S0262	oh okay right
S0303	but then erm he live with the girl's granny because the granny have a spare room
S0262	oh right
S0303	or something and erm he get annoy with me he get angry with me actually and i say well maybe they think you'd get on cos you're a similar age
S0303	but anyway the girl finally realise i think
S0262	wonderful
S0303	i think the girl finally realise he's a bite too mad to hang around with so she get rid of him but for some reason he just stay in
S0262	right
S0303	and then er he go to a fortune teller and the fortune teller say your happiness be this be i find this hilarious your happiness be gonna come from the east
S0262	right
S0303	so when he be in a nightclub in
S0303	and he meet a girl from
S0262	okay
S0303	i promise you this be true well this be what he tell me he think oh this be you know
S0262	this be it
S0303	my destiny
S0262	yeah yeah this be my happiness
S0303	and again and just like the one and just like the other very very very very pretty
S0262	yeah
S0303	really lovely
S0262	yeah
S0303	nice sort of i don't know not middle class i don't know what middle class mean but just like well mannered and
S0262	yeah
S0303	and civil and
S0262	yeah
S0303	civilise and oh nice to meet you
S0262	mm
S0303	you know and try and find something positive to say
S0262	friendly yeah
S0303	like oh that's you you know or do you
S0262	yeah
S0303	have a good flight or like very nice but not mindless
S0262	yeah
S0303	just simple girls you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think one be a hairdresser one be a beautician
S0262	yeah
S0303	and erm and yeah that didn't work either
S0262	didn't work either
S0303	no just
S0262	so he didn't go back to that fortune teller
S0303	no
S0262	go a conspiracy theory somebody set him up
S0303	and it's like typical theme like they're always the be knees you know you get of this be
S0262	mm
S0303	and then when they've fall out of favour oh suddenly
S0262	yeah
S0303	they've transform into the devil incarnate
S0262	right okay
S0303	even though the poor girl hasn't change
S0262	oh wow
S0303	you know
S0262	oh
S0303	those sort of people they have those enthusiasms
S0262	but he doesn't go after them afterwards sort of thing or oh thank god for that
S0303	no i don't think so i think he's a megalomaniac in a way
S0262	mm
S0303	he sort of think that
S0262	yeah yeah yeah i know what you mean
S0303	and he's get his sunglasses and his nice car
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know and his stories that he spin
S0262	yeah yeah remind me of someone
S0303	yeah yeah yeah no similar in some ways similar maybe in some ways similar
S0262	yeah
S0303	we'll talk about that later
S0262	yeah
S0303	maybe the next just in case you black out on me
S0262	yeah that's right
S0262	you never know
S0262	but it's actually quite weird because erm so what i have to do with the record i i put them i have to make them into mp3 file which i know how to do
S0303	i don't do mps i've hear i've hear of an mp3
S0262	there's a couple of click and button show me how to do it it's fine
S0303	be it like a tape basically
S0262	it well yes it be it's just
S0303	yeah
S0262	that's their format that they want so this would doesn't
S0303	be it be an mp3 be a tangible thing or it's
S0262	it's like an itunes you know that's what i be gonna say it be tangible
S0303	can you can you touch it okay it's not a concept it's
S0262	i it's a touch it as it click it through the
S0303	yeah
S0262	it's a digital touch as in you click on there
S0303	okay
S0262	on on the file
S0303	ah so a file
S0262	like a word document or
S0303	okay
S0262	it's just a document
S0303	so it's yeah
S0262	yeah yeah so it's just a file and so i know how to do that so that's two click and then what i have to do be i have to go over the conversation so you be right in that respect when i when i email you about it and say oh i'm really not sure if i really want to hate the you know the sound of my own voice
S0262	but i've i've make these file and i go over them and i just basically have to write in what it's slightly about you know
S0303	should be quite interest
S0262	yeah it be it be actually really interest on some of the conversations because what's happen be that they somehow cos i've get an apple mac and i don't' know how it work but somehow these mp3 file be recognise by itunes because itunes only use mp3 file for audio anyway to cut a long story short
S0303	i'm sorry about on itunes be i've hear of all these things
S0303	i've hear of mp3 i don't i know there's such a thing as mp3
S0262	this be something
S0303	cos there's an mp3 player as well isn't there
S0262	yeah that's right
S0303	and i've hear of itunes but
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't know what it be i've just hear
S0262	yeah
S0303	of itunes
S0262	so my little thing that i put on
S0303	there's like ipods and ipads and ebay i've hear of the word of the
S0262	yeah
S0303	term but
S0262	and and they be just file and and so because they're they're in my itunes now i didn't put them there they're in there they be
S0303	they just go there on their own
S0262	yeah and then when i do my auto sync for my little mp3 player which be this tiny little one that you know when i'm
S0303	yeah
S0262	walk around and
S0303	basically like a walkman
S0262	yes just like a walkman
S0303	yeah
S0262	and then i i i switch it on and there's a bite of music and then there's something and then all of a sudden it's one of these record so it's one of the conversations
S0303	oh that's quite funny
S0262	so this erm this afternoon for a whole hour and a half
S0303	but you'll start to see people in a whole new light
S0262	well i re listen
S0303	no because sometimes
S0262	yeah you do
S0303	when you've get that immediacy
S0262	yeah you don't realise
S0303	it's very different
S0262	mm mm
S0303	from afterwards because i think people think that they gravitate towards some people and don't gravitate towards others because of the content of what the person say
S0262	yeah
S0303	but it's not that
S0262	yeah
S0303	at all it's to do with the way the person be
S0262	exactly
S0303	i know people who i think they're quite cognitively challenge
S0262	yeah
S0303	and the type of things they talk about be not of any actual interest to me
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i love their company
S0262	the way they're say it yeah
S0303	i love
S0262	yeah
S0303	i love be around them
S0262	yeah
S0303	they lift my spirit
S0262	yeah
S0303	they're just so nice and yet and there be other people who i think on paper
S0262	yeah
S0303	we've get a lot in common we've get a similar interest
S0262	yeah
S0303	we're probably a similar level of education
S0262	yeah
S0303	iq
S0262	yeah
S0303	erm ideology and yet they're just unbearable
S0262	yeah
S0303	probably because they're like me but i mean i just i wouldn't wanna be around them too much
S0262	no
S0303	and that's why i never understand how this erm computer version of the lonely hearts column work
S0262	oh i don't know anything about that
S0303	because let's say if like people i know people who've do it like
S0262	right
S0303	i don't know it's basically
S0262	what what be it
S0303	a way of find a
S0262	it's a date agency
S0303	boyfriend
S0262	okay
S0303	but via
S0262	it's like a matchmaking
S0303	the computer yeah but if you just type in exactly what you think your ideal person be
S0262	yeah
S0303	er and then you also tap in what your idea of an absolute nightmare would be
S0262	yeah
S0303	the chance be you're gonna prefer the second person
S0262	yeah
S0303	because it's nothing to do with you know just because somebody like read and like go to the cinema and like learn languages
S0262	doesn't mean you're go to like the same type of book or anything
S0303	no it's just
S0262	yeah that's right
S0303	but it's
S0262	the whole approach might be completely different
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah yeah i know what you mean that's interest
S0303	it's nothing to do with anything you can put your finger on just some people you take to
S0262	yeah
S0303	and some people you don't
S0262	yeah i hadn't think about it like that before but even so just er this afternoon i get on the train and i be listen to a bite of music and then all of a sudden the conversation from erm the time when i meet er my mum's half sister come on
S0303	i really wanna hear about that
S0262	which be actually
S0303	i really that's the first thing i wanna hear about
S0262	which be actually two hours long the whole thing she be completely fine with it and so i relistened to the conversation
S0303	and that's the first time you'd meet her
S0262	yeah
S0303	so that say something for her because
S0262	and we go through everything
S0303	because a lot of people
S0262	we go through death we go through the fact that her erm her you know er father be obviously erm have an affair erm so that's how she come about
S0303	so her father be your mum's father
S0262	that's right so my grandfather
S0303	yeah
S0262	so we
S0303	so this be the grandfather that you never really know about
S0262	absolutely
S0303	cos it be always like your granny i remember even from
S0262	yeah
S0303	school days i remember
S0262	yeah
S0303	it be always granny wasn't it
S0262	yeah it be always like granny
S0303	basically mum and granny wasn't it
S0262	granny this and granny that yes it be yeah
S0303	wasn't even maybe granny even a bite more than mum
S0262	yeah
S0303	same as for me
S0262	that's right and so
S0303	yeah
S0262	i re listen to it and you're right erm i mean the topics be fascinate for me but also it be the way that because we've never meet before that
S0303	yeah
S0262	we just gel and you can tell
S0303	and then i'm sure it's not
S0262	there's this
S0303	but you wonder whether there's
S0262	it's not niceties
S0303	something in the genes or something
S0262	yeah
S0303	that you
S0262	oh gosh i wonder
S0303	i don't know probably not
S0262	there be things
S0303	but it cross your mind
S0262	yeah there be things when i think to myself wow that's such a
S0303	some kind of mannerism or turn of phrase
S0262	yeah
S0303	or
S0262	yeah absolutely like even at the end when erm so she's actually in a wheelchair because she have erm spina bifida
S0303	oh okay
S0262	she erm but only for i suppose it when she turn fifty she really need to use a wheelchair
S0303	okay
S0262	but before that she be get around on crutches and things and everything be fine
S0303	mm
S0262	erm so yeah erm then she say oh now i i'll erm i'll see you to the door and i say yes thank you and then we have a little chat before i leave and she say now it's very welsh for the person to stay by the door and wave the the person who's leave off
S0303	oh yeah but i do that as well
S0262	you know that's nice and that so i say no and i
S0303	either you walk them to wherever they're go
S0262	yeah
S0303	or
S0262	yeah
S0303	you yeah
S0262	but i say to her that's what mummy and granny always use to do
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know to me
S0303	but to me that's just manners
S0262	so i have a little wobble at that point
S0303	yeah
S0262	cos i be like whoa cos i think oh i be do really well
S0303	it must have be really emotionally
S0262	and then i
S0303	overwhelm
S0262	i just catch a glimpse of her and cos we be talk about this mad who's the scientist who want our measurements
S0303	yeah
S0262	and she be talk about
S0303	i can remember your dad show me a letter
S0262	droopy eyelids right okay
S0303	and he's get really bizarrely neat write
S0262	he have
S0303	i'd always be
S0262	he have
S0303	suspicious of someone who have such neat write
S0262	yes and he's eighty four
S0303	yeah
S0262	so he can still write really quite well
S0303	but i think i never you know when you come in on something sometimes
S0262	yeah
S0303	and people seem to assume that you know everything that go before
S0262	yeah
S0303	but you don't so they start talk
S0262	oh i know i i have friends like that
S0303	but you actually don't know what they're talk about because they haven't set
S0262	yeah
S0303	the scene they haven't give you any context
S0262	mm
S0303	so oh so and another and i never even
S0262	yeah
S0303	i couldn't even get to the bottom of who he be
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you know there be some people who don't really welcome interruption they wanna just talk
S0262	yeah
S0303	and so you're get more and more perplex and you're think
S0262	yeah that's right
S0303	hang on so who's this what who's and
S0262	i know
S0303	and so i sort of know all these detail but
S0262	yeah but
S0303	but i don't really understand
S0262	don't know what the backdrop be
S0303	yeah it's just some sort of morass of
S0262	yes
S0303	cos i don't understand what his research be
S0262	neither do i
S0303	something to do with genes or something genetics or something like
S0262	all i know be that he's be in he's be research the family from the word go
S0303	but i know it's a stupid question but why
S0262	i don't know i i i don't know i don't know at all
S0303	but be he's not he's not relate to the family or be he who be this guy
S0262	he he he now let me cos i i actually listen to this part today
S0303	i understand obviously you and mum's half sister that's
S0262	erm
S0303	easy to understand that's someone who
S0262	how do he come into it
S0303	have the same dad as your mum but i don't understand
S0262	i think he be relate to the family not by
S0303	oh he's
S0262	blood line but i think maybe through marriage or something
S0303	oh so he be
S0262	he's relate
S0303	oh that make it a bite less weird
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think i cos i didn't understand what be go on and i just think that
S0262	i don't really understand it myself
S0303	maybe he somehow track down your dad somehow and
S0262	yeah well what he'd do be he'd actually just send a letter to my mum see i get the impression at that mum and gran know
S0303	yeah probably
S0262	that be onto them about these measurements because they would
S0303	probably
S0262	their measurements would be fantastic for him because of course you know
S0303	but what sort of measurements
S0262	mum be the product of and
S0303	what sort of be it what be it be it
S0262	everything now
S0303	everything like
S0262	and he send a list to me
S0303	measure your skull
S0262	oh my gosh everything like
S0303	give you a personality test
S0262	even if you iq er honestly
S0303	oh so everything it's literally everything
S0262	yeah everything like even if you be
S0303	cos i say to you i say to your dad
S0262	pay you know when you eat beetroot where there there's a a certain term
S0303	oh
S0262	you know when we do it in biology
S0303	erm whether you can roll your tongue
S0262	yes
S0303	cos i say to your dad it sound like
S0262	all manners of things
S0303	the nazis you and they measure your skull and see what
S0262	oh it's it's it be
S0303	race you or
S0262	like that it er really be like that and that's why i'm quite
S0262	put off by the whole thing and also what i explain to her be she's do the measurements but i and he she say to me well would you do the measurements and i say no i i'm not i'm in two mind actually and not
S0303	mm
S0262	neither yes or no
S0303	it be i'm not be funny but
S0262	cos i'm not sure if my mum would like it
S0303	what would you gain from it
S0262	mm
S0303	what would you i don't really understand
S0262	well i wouldn't gain anything
S0303	what you're mean to get out of it
S0262	i think that's probably what like
S0303	yeah and if they tell you oh you've get some sort of genetic disease
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you're gonna die next year it's probably better not to know cos
S0262	well that's what i think but fundamentally i'm not sure whether i'm okay with it because i don't think
S0303	i just don't see it's any of his business
S0262	mum or gran
S0303	no
S0262	would be cool with it
S0303	because otherwise they'd have tell you
S0262	right
S0303	if they want you to be involve in all this
S0262	yes
S0303	they'd have tell you
S0262	that's where i'm come from
S0303	and people keep things to themselves
S0262	yeah
S0303	for good reason
S0262	yeah
S0303	and that's their business and it's their choice
S0262	that's right so those two sort of things compound together mean i'm probably not go to do it
S0303	mm
S0262	because i also know that he's he's write to her over years to ask her what she's develop for different diseases and whatnot and everything so that mean that if i say yes i'm open myself up to
S0303	yeah
S0262	years of this
S0303	slippery slope
S0262	until he until he pass on
S0303	yeah
S0262	but then he have a daughter who be to take over this research project
S0303	cos i say to your dad i say i don't understand what and er would get out of it i don't understand
S0262	well nothing
S0303	what just out of the
S0262	nothing
S0303	kindness of your heart
S0262	yeah
S0303	you agree to be experiment on by a total stranger
S0262	mm mm i mean of course i could read some of the research journals but
S0303	well why would you
S0262	as
S0303	you know
S0262	as as say
S0303	you'd rather take dobby for a walk if you've get some spare time
S0262	exactly and she say it's such an academic speak it's really not a subject that's actually you know one of those interest ones where you'd sort of pick it up and go alright
S0303	and i mean it's nice to have a hobby but
S0303	what's an eighty four year old do
S0262	well she say
S0303	shouldn't he be play bridge
S0262	well this be what i think i she say well he's just a very have just a very inquire mind he's just that
S0303	bite obsessive
S0262	he
S0303	and he's rude as well
S0262	and he's obsessive he's rude
S0303	cos i know this be a stereotype
S0262	he's
S0303	but i always think elderly people have many fault
S0262	mm
S0303	but one of the things stereotype that i tend to like about elderly people be they're usually extremely well mannered
S0262	yeah
S0303	and very civil
S0262	yeah
S0303	and very aware of your feel
S0262	yeah
S0303	those letter be so rude
S0262	they're very rude and they're
S0303	just the fact that it's couch in
S0262	the term that it be yeah
S0303	articulate terminology
S0262	mm and she tell me more about him that he's all of these series about illegitimacy so he's he's research the family like so she's research the family and she's do an incredible job on it and she's do it for her own interest to see whether she can locate this these s from one particular part of wales which be a fine idea why not no one else have do it and then she want to see whether she can actually prove that they all come from this part and then she want to see how many of them she's actually relate to
S0303	cos
S0262	that's her thing
S0303	i think
S0262	that's what she's dedicate her life to
S0303	i get tell me if i've get the wrong end of the stick altogether the father of your mum
S0262	yes
S0303	be also the father of this lady
S0262	yes
S0303	that's that's straightforward
S0262	yeah
S0303	now be it that his father allegedly father all these children or something
S0262	no
S0303	or be that him himself
S0262	that
S0303	or his father
S0262	that that well there well there be it's definitely the
S0303	somebody allegedly they have
S0262	the grey
S0303	all these illegitimate children or something
S0262	it yes the great grandfather
S0303	be that why do he want to know this
S0262	there there be rumour and nothing have be prove now be illegitimate i mean there's that thing no doubt about it
S0303	yeah but
S0262	and so be her brother
S0303	yeah
S0262	but that's about the only thing that we can say be true because everything else be just really theoretical
S0303	cos i didn't understand when your dad be explain it i didn't understand who it be who be suppose to have be rumour to have
S0262	yeah
S0303	i hadn't i i be think hang on so be this how many generations be we go back
S0262	oh well i mean i think
S0303	and you you know when you
S0262	both of them can go back
S0303	try to ask and you just get another
S0262	dad wouldn't know
S0303	barrage of
S0262	you know what she send me today be a two volumes she's photocopy her own research she's put them into like little project sort of folders for me
S0303	yeah
S0262	and she's send them in two separate package
S0303	and it's awful cos if she's really nice you feel that you want to be receptive
S0262	and i've get this now and then she exactly
S0303	burn it
S0262	and then she start a letter go on about you know
S0303	can of worm
S0262	well i suppose what happen be be that she i do get quite interest in it for a while and you know i be in her house and you know and then we start talk and i be really interest in all the stories that's the sort of thing i'd like but erm but then i do say ah it's interest that you've be do this work because i'd like to have a look at my mother's side as in my
S0303	yeah
S0262	granny's side
S0303	yeah
S0262	and she say oh be you interest in learn how to do it and i sort of say yes if i have the time
S0303	in theory
S0262	yeah
S0303	in theory which be not necessarily in practice
S0262	oh i i'd never have the time
S0303	hypothetically
S0262	to do it
S0303	in an ideal world
S0262	all the information
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0303	obviously in an ideal world
S0262	yeah
S0303	we'd all like to
S0262	wouldn't it be lovely
S0303	know how to do everything
S0262	yeah exactly
S0303	but that doesn't mean you've actually get the intention of
S0262	go to do it no i think she's give a bite of a help hand here
S0303	yeah a bite of a nudge
S0262	so she write to me yeah a bite of a nudge and she write to me and say
S0303	but of a shove
S0262	here you go this be what the thing look like and i've already do some erm initial research into the s and the s which be my mother's side so it's it's definitely nothing to do with the s this be my granny this be the
S0303	so be your granny's maiden name
S0262	er be my granny's erm marry name so she marry into s
S0303	oh so she so so what do she start off as
S0262	erm well there's three different surnames there's and the s
S0303	okay
S0262	yeah
S0303	okay so it be granddad who be granddad who you
S0262	yes
S0303	didn't really know anything about
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	okay
S0262	yeah so she marry into the family
S0303	so your mum be a because her dad be a
S0262	yeah
S0303	okay get it
S0262	mm mm yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	so but the other side
S0303	mm
S0262	be be what i'm really more interest in
S0303	yeah because why would you be interest in some guy you've never
S0262	well it's that's the marry side that's the
S0303	yeah
S0262	bite that really kind of you know
S0303	he he play no part in your life
S0262	not at all
S0303	and your mum and granny to the extent to which they do know anything choose not to divulge it
S0262	absolutely they weren't interest either so but so i start say and she's write to me say i've already make an initial inquiry for you and la la la la la so like
S0303	she's lay the groundwork hasn't she
S0262	crikey
S0303	she's be do her
S0303	pat the grind preparation
S0262	and also i'm mean to go and see her again and i know that she's a teacher
S0303	like a little fly go into the spider's web
S0262	yeah
S0303	isn't it
S0262	i think she's set me some homework to do
S0303	yeah
S0262	i've get to do something before i see her
S0303	explicitly really yeah
S0262	but then she
S0303	but she be nice
S0262	you know she doesn't work she's retire but she's in a wheelchair
S0303	so she's what sort of age
S0262	she's about sixty seven i think
S0303	yeah
S0262	i say about sixty seven she be sixty seven
S0303	so
S0262	cos that's what she
S0303	a bite younger than your mum would have be
S0262	yeah though there's
S0303	a little bite
S0262	some yes i haven't quite work out there be there be some years miss because what be interest about it
S0303	when you hear most people's life story i don't think it bear any relation
S0262	there be
S0303	to reality at all you know
S0262	yes yes exactly
S0303	and it's like
S0262	there be years miss in my life already
S0303	cos i've so trust yeah but i'm so trust
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm so i really be
S0262	yeah
S0303	like a child
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm so naïve like if someone tell me something i just assume it's true
S0262	well yeah so do i yeah i wouldn't even think
S0303	i just presume it's true
S0262	to question it
S0303	and then after time pass you think hang on there's you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you realise like most people be just make up everything
S0262	well that's it
S0303	it's really weird
S0262	yeah
S0303	but they don't even make up anything good if i be gonna make something up i'd try and make up a really
S0262	fantastical story yeah
S0303	fantastic story you know to really
S0262	yeah
S0303	mesmerise my audience
S0262	yeah
S0303	but they make up funny things
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0303	you know
S0262	it's true it's like why would you bother
S0303	things that wouldn't possibly impress you
S0262	no not at all yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	just like or
S0303	or that's not even interest i mean it's interest but it's not
S0262	maybe for lack of imagination
S0303	it's no more interest than the reality the reality be
S0262	yeah it's probably lack of their imagination but so anyway she be there at the same time well no one year out i think erm they go to the same teacher train college
S0303	ah the two
S0262	mm
S0303	the half sisters and do they know that they be each other's half sisters we don't know
S0262	she know when she start
S0303	and we don't know whether your mum do
S0262	mum possibly not because she wouldn't have know she be go yet cos she be a year after but what have happen be the lecturer in education
S0303	it's weird isn't it
S0262	say erm do you have erm oh there's some mail er be you expect some mail and she say to me the story go i think you be ask about m a l e
S0303	yeah be you expect a male
S0262	so she say no yes
S0303	be you anticipate a male
S0303	i'm desperately try to avoid a male
S0262	so they say oh there's some there's some mail here for erm do you know
S0303	and her name's
S0262	mm
S0262	because she's
S0303	it's very welsh
S0262	marry now but at the time er yeah she marry a welshman
S0303	yeah
S0262	erm but she would have be
S0303	oh really
S0262	exactly
S0303	brilliant isn't it
S0262	no it be
S0262	erm er but she would have be at that time
S0303	mm
S0262	she would have be
S0303	yeah
S0262	so that's when they say do you know and that's when she go to ask her mum and say
S0303	cos it's not a common name be it
S0262	not at all and now two s come through like
S0303	cos if it be a
S0262	one after the other
S0303	you would just think oh that's a coincidence
S0262	yeah
S0303	cos there's so many of us
S0262	yeah
S0303	about
S0262	and it i think they must have ask that the the lecturer must have somehow assume that that maybe they be sisters because one be come after the other
S0303	yeah
S0262	as in oh well if one's come so another one's come
S0303	yeah family tradition
S0262	why not you know
S0303	so it's their mail
S0262	teachers whatever so she have to say no because technically she have never meet my mum so she say no and she didn't want to open up a can of worm to say yes but she do know at that point
S0303	so that story sound potentially plausible
S0262	yeah
S0303	but the thing be you just never know
S0262	no
S0303	this be i really try and bear in mind
S0262	mm
S0303	it's so difficult for me cos it go against my instincts
S0262	mm
S0303	i really try to remember that unless i've see it
S0262	yeah
S0303	for myself
S0262	yeah
S0303	unfold
S0262	yeah
S0303	then i don't know whether it's true or not
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	maybe ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent sure it be
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but you never actually
S0262	actually know
S0303	know
S0262	yeah
S0303	unless you've witness it unfold
S0262	yeah
S0303	with your own sense and your own
S0262	that's right
S0303	cognitive process skills
S0262	that's exactly yeah
S0303	cos that story almost it do sound plausible but
S0262	yeah
S0303	but it sound almost a bite too pat doesn't it
S0262	yes
S0303	it sound almost as if
S0262	yeah
S0303	if you be make up a story to illustrate what you want to convey
S0262	yeah
S0303	that's the story you'd come up with
S0262	yeah yes it could be
S0303	it's not natural
S0262	it isn't quite obvious
S0303	it's not natural
S0262	yeah
S0303	to me to think like that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but
S0262	yeah yeah there be something about it but and then there there be so many cross link you know i mean she go back way back to the eighteen forty one census but what i find fascinate i quite like these quirky things be that she say that she'd find and and the that census in eighteen forty one that there be live in
S0303	oh
S0262	now my granny would have be cos she marry a and she keep her marry name and granny move to in the nineteen sixties
S0303	cos i be try to work out this be a bite of a digression
S0262	yeah
S0303	how how do everybody come to be in that be because your granny move there just by coincidence
S0262	not no erm her first cousin
S0303	yeah
S0262	marry
S0303	i've hear that name but i can't remember
S0262	and move in erm into the family who be
S0303	the er who your dad
S0262	the book
S0303	and be very proud of
S0262	the bookstore people
S0303	yeah
S0262	people who
S0303	apparently they're very famous but i
S0262	run yeah they're well they're a publish family
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know erm and er so when
S0303	cos they be say what have you never hear of them and i be say no sorry i'm really ignorant i've never hear of anything
S0262	no you but you wouldn't and it's a base
S0303	yeah
S0262	publish family so
S0303	cos i just never understand
S0262	which be er they're no more
S0303	how from wales and ireland
S0262	yeah how
S0303	happen
S0262	yes
S0303	and i do ask and i do pay attention but at the end i be none the wiser
S0262	no no
S0303	cos i just couldn't follow
S0262	i think what happen be that have erm advise and persuade granny to get the hell out of or
S0303	right
S0262	because she be go through a divorce
S0303	yeah and it be taboo back then
S0262	yeah and she'd already spend a lot of time in london have a lot of fun
S0303	i'm gonna tell you my granny digression later
S0262	okay
S0303	just talk about taboo no so carry on cos i i'm i'm engross
S0262	and i think granny could have be get a little bite wayward in london
S0303	yes
S0262	so she need somewhere with a little bite more family connection
S0303	yeah
S0262	but not
S0303	no that make perfect sense
S0262	so
S0303	so be almost a happy medium between and london
S0262	absolutely
S0303	put a bite of distance between you and the gossip monger
S0262	yes that's exactly right
S0303	and the scandal monger but don't go anywhere where it's gonna tempt you to
S0262	yes
S0303	further scandals
S0262	yes that's very right or get catch up with something you don't want to get catch up with which be maybe what the backdrop be
S0303	an unsuitable gentleman
S0262	yeah cos there be plenty of suitors play
S0303	yeah
S0262	so and just say look this place be lovely so you should come up and have a look and she fell in love with and all that thing
S0303	ah so it be cousin so be
S0262	yes first cousin
S0303	granny's cousin
S0262	yes first cousin
S0303	ah
S0262	they be great friends
S0303	and why be and so be there because she's marry into the
S0262	marry into the
S0303	ah
S0262	family
S0303	so the s be
S0262	he be the head of the
S0303	base there for age
S0262	yes yes they be
S0303	a cousin marry into the family
S0262	yeah
S0303	you see i can understand it when you say it
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's actually straightforward isn't it
S0262	yeah
S0303	i understand it perfectly
S0303	so again when the cousin want to the cousin be your granny
S0262	yeah
S0303	not london but not
S0262	yeah
S0303	the obvious place would be where there be a family connection
S0262	yeah
S0303	which be
S0262	yeah
S0303	area
S0262	exactly
S0303	cos that's where her cousin okay it make sense
S0262	yeah yeah and that's where she stay
S0303	i concentrate for about half an hour
S0303	try to get to the bottom of that
S0262	and none the wiser
S0303	it make sense yeah
S0262	yeah
S0303	cos i hear no i've hear the name but i couldn't work out who it be
S0262	yeah
S0303	it be just i i get that it be a relative
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	and that they be real erm i don't know how to explain it exactly like real goers like great look and
S0262	oh yeah
S0303	out and about and in demand
S0262	she make a point about
S0303	and the social whirl and
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah but i
S0262	they be
S0303	couldn't quite work out who be
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	and i didn't realise that have live there first or
S0262	yeah
S0303	i didn't understand that the i didn't understand that be connect with the s i understand all these s
S0262	yeah yeah and how
S0303	and that there be er somebody call
S0262	yeah
S0303	for
S0262	i i also don't know how the cousin thing work out that's another branch bite that i don't know
S0303	yeah but anyway they be cousins
S0262	so there must have be a brother or sister
S0303	yeah relatives
S0262	but though my granny didn't have any brothers or sisters so erm not quite sure how that work out but
S0303	but in those days and especially certain type of family
S0262	yeah
S0303	the typical thing to do would be if you be have a change in your life would be affiliate yourself to
S0262	exactly
S0303	a relative
S0262	yes
S0303	and i know lot of people who do that now
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	like oh they get divorce they have some sort of breakdown or
S0262	yeah
S0303	they lose their job and they have some kind of crisis and they just oh i'm go to go and live in
S0262	yeah
S0303	wherever because well my sister live there
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	it's normal for some people
S0262	yeah yeah and
S0303	it's the last thing but i'd do but
S0262	it make perfect sense
S0303	you know
S0262	yeah and be then
S0303	yeah
S0262	it's like wow you know
S0303	well it's lovely as well
S0262	so she move her mother up there
S0303	mm
S0262	so her mother and also her aunt so auntie and my great grandmother and the three of them the three women live together in that house
S0303	yes
S0262	and then granny would have say to mum now you have your teach qualification what be you go to do with it and you need to come a little bite closer to me so i can keep an eye on you
S0303	so this be when granny be maybe
S0262	granny would have be in her fifties
S0303	yeah
S0262	late forties just late forties fifties
S0303	so by those standards get quite staid but by our standards
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's young i mean
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's our age
S0262	well er er yeah but i you know i think because she wasn't marry and
S0303	yeah
S0262	she didn't have any of those trappings
S0303	no
S0262	so apart from look after her mother and her
S0303	yeah
S0262	aunt but i mean really they be alright you know
S0303	yeah
S0262	so it be quite a good amount of time
S0303	they didn't need round the clock care or
S0262	no no no not at all and when she
S0303	you don't have to put your whole life on hold for them
S0262	yeah no she really get to know
S0303	so she then move into the house
S0262	they er granny buy it outright
S0303	okay so that's why that house be there
S0262	yeah and
S0303	so that's all from your mum's
S0262	absolutely that's the thing and so mum get a
S0303	and if you think about it
S0262	i know you
S0303	what would they have want and
S0262	well i know i know that's that's another thing
S0303	oh that's not for me to say but
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	you know what i mean
S0262	yeah no i do know i've i've cotton onto that
S0303	cos i've be think that right from the word go
S0262	yeah
S0303	i mean
S0262	yeah yeah yeah i know i i'm completely aware of it you know i don't think he be though
S0303	yeah but what would
S0262	he's er conveniently forget about it
S0303	you know what what would mummy and granny want and if it wasn't for mum and granny then nobody would be live in that house
S0262	mm it's not clear what they would have do actually because he have erm they
S0303	can make an educate guess
S0262	well yeah i mean you know wouldn't be and it wouldn't have be quite so nice i don't think
S0303	no
S0262	because i would have be hard cos he come out of the he choose to come out of the army a little earlier
S0303	mm
S0262	and he do have his army pension but that wasn't it they look to buy somewhere in but it wasn't affordable for them at the time
S0303	no
S0262	so they would have have to have get a huge mortgage
S0303	yeah
S0262	so granny make it dead dead easy for him really
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know erm and to let you know the children come and live with there as well
S0303	and obviously obviously when you get marry obviously you put your destinies together
S0262	yeah
S0303	but at the same time
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	there's also your children
S0262	yeah well that's it and the grandchildren yeah so you know really this be kind of like a shelter you know or a safe haven
S0303	exactly
S0262	or security really
S0303	exactly
S0262	and she allow him to put you know this extra bite onto the house
S0303	yeah
S0262	to give him a sort of sense of ownership
S0303	and what would your mother and your granny think about that have these meet and stuff i mean
S0262	god i don't know i have no idea
S0303	it's weird isn't it be it weird
S0262	yeah
S0303	to me it's weird not bad weird
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's just to me it's weird
S0262	apparently it's part of the trust thing you know i don't know but it the thing that set me off be it be a conversation say it heat it be an argument in actual fact so erm so i get quite emotional about it
S0303	but it be emotional because they
S0262	yeah
S0303	don't people understand if i can understand i probably don't understand
S0262	yeah
S0303	precisely but i can understand the broad outline
S0262	yeah

S0303	that's like be mental
S0262	yeah it's it i say like
S0303	sorry i'm not be nasty but that's actually
S0262	well it could be a mistake
S0303	madness
S0262	yeah it could have be a mistake it could have be anything i don't really know why the bake bean be there but think about what you're actually say dad
S0303	or let's just say you be a bite mental and it matter to you where the bake bean go
S0262	yeah
S0303	there be ways and ways of do things if your dad have say oh sorry i know i'm a bite anal but you know the way i be
S0262	yeah
S0303	would you mind just put the bake bean here next time
S0262	yeah
S0303	you'd have
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah of course dad
S0262	exactly
S0303	and how be you today you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	there be ways and ways of do things
S0262	oh no he just fly off the handle
S0303	everyone's get their own idiosyncrasies
S0262	yeah
S0303	let's call them
S0262	yeah
S0303	to be kind
S0262	that's it that's it yeah
S0303	but there be ways and ways of talk to people
S0262	yeah well this be what set the whole thing off
S0303	and that's your home
S0262	and he say it's my kitchen and i say it's your kitchen how be it your kitchen know full well that he'd set up this trust that that be what be be intend
S0303	but that's rude trust or no trust
S0262	yeah
S0303	forget it you you're mum's daughter and your
S0262	but
S0303	grandmother's granddaughter
S0262	but he's be hammer on to me about this whole trust thing
S0303	that's obscene actually
S0262	so erm that be
S0303	but again i'm sure he didn't mean any harm
S0262	firstly no he didn't
S0303	but doesn't he understand how insensitive
S0262	he doesn't oh no he he
S0303	that be and how hurtful
S0262	really doesn't care really doesn't care
S0303	but that house be enormous
S0262	yeah so i say to him what do you think mummy
S0303	i mean this place be for me enormous it's far too ridiculously enormous but i mean
S0262	but yeah
S0303	compare
S0262	i say well what do you think mummy and granny would have say to that
S0303	quite
S0262	and i keep bring that up
S0303	quite
S0262	and of course that sort of send him up even more loopy but you know i think i get the point across probably
S0303	but he be marry to your mum for all those years
S0262	i know but he's just become completely hypocritical
S0303	can't imagine how your mum would have
S0262	because
S0303	react
S0262	granny let him
S0303	your mum would want you
S0262	stay
S0303	i know
S0262	with his wife well obviously her daughter but with the children
S0303	it's more like he's this be sound awful but it's more as if he's the imposter
S0262	yeah
S0303	you've get the family line from granny
S0262	yeah
S0303	to mum
S0262	yeah
S0303	to and he's the guy who get on the bandwagon and move in
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's not
S0262	and now it's his accord to him
S0303	my kitchen
S0262	my kitchen my everything my house
S0303	if my mum and dad have stay together i'm try to think or try to imagine
S0262	yeah
S0303	if my mum and dad have stay together and my mum die and i go to visit my dad which
S0262	yeah
S0303	in what have be my family home
S0262	yeah
S0303	and he start talk about my kitchen
S0262	yeah it's just absolutely
S0303	you could have knock me down with a feather i mean my dad be mad
S0262	yeah
S0303	but even
S0262	yeah yeah it's very odd and so you do wonder
S0303	and you're not harm the kitchen it's not as if you've
S0262	well
S0303	make a bonfire in the kitchen
S0262	well that's right
S0303	and a box
S0262	this be right and i say to him and i say well what's go on dad and he say well as far as i'm concern you're you're invite guests i say oh really for how long
S0303	seriously
S0262	have we have we be invite to
S0303	word for word
S0262	for yeah word for word i say how long have we be invite oh well er probably after christmas
S0303	i say oh great you know how would mum and gran feel that you're actually basically turf us out after after
S0303	so that
S0262	christmas
S0303	house cos it's probably worth an absolute fortune i'm sure it
S0262	but yeah
S0303	or no but no but i mean
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know
S0303	you and i just probably look it up on
S0303	no but i don't i don't know about things like this but what i mean be
S0262	location location location
S0303	well what i mean be you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	there a there's a lovely house with tonnes of room and tonnes of bedrooms and tonnes of
S0262	yeah
S0303	bathrooms and tonnes of space
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you and be expect to go and do a
S0262	well
S0303	nine to five job and a weekend job to pay some rent on some little flat somewhere
S0262	well well well i
S0303	i mean if you choose to
S0262	yes
S0303	then that's all well and good
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	and that would be brilliant and i think it probably would be
S0262	yeah
S0303	healthy
S0262	yeah
S0303	but it need to come from you
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you've only just
S0262	only just really arrive
S0303	come from australia a few months ago
S0262	yeah i don't think he's cotton on to any of that at all
S0303	and it's the emotional impact and the emotional connotations of
S0262	mm
S0303	come back into that home where
S0262	mm
S0303	for all those years you look at that chair and
S0262	mm
S0303	and your mum be in it
S0262	mm
S0303	for all those years you look at that chair and your
S0262	yeah
S0303	granny be in it
S0262	yeah
S0303	that's what
S0262	so that's the worst argument we've have so far and it be
S0303	but do he back down or
S0262	pretty bad sorry
S0303	he do he back down and apologise
S0262	oh no no no no
S0303	but do he understand he'd hurt you or
S0262	no
S0303	genuinely didn't understand
S0262	no
S0303	this be what i think
S0262	none
S0303	you see i think your dad and don't have any ill intentions at all
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't think they set out to be cruel
S0262	no
S0303	i don't think they've set out to be unkind i don't think they set out to even be selfish i just think it's something
S0262	i i think you're right i i really like the way you express it
S0303	it's like a personality disorder or
S0262	oblivious oblivious be a really
S0303	oblivious
S0262	good adjective to describe them
S0303	cos there be people who get pleasure from hurt people
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	like sadistic people
S0262	yeah
S0303	they like to make you suffer
S0262	yeah
S0303	they like to manipulate just to show they're
S0262	just to see yeah
S0303	i don't think they're like that
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think they
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's just a whole different world view
S0262	no but he i mean he
S0303	and a whole different perspective
S0262	just say to me i'm your father so don't ask me and don't question me don't question my authority be that what he be say and i say really dad i think we be friends oh no i'm gonna cry
S0303	so you're a you're an invite guest for as long as
S0262	apparently
S0303	so you're there sort of under sufferance
S0262	yeah and
S0303	and out of the kindness of his heart
S0262	i do know that
S0303	he's
S0262	mm
S0303	allow you to stay
S0262	mm
S0303	till christmas
S0262	but he doesn't want to be take advantage of
S0303	and he's be take advantage of by the fact that you've put his bean in the wrong place
S0262	something there have be you know
S0303	but how be he be take advantage of
S0262	i've ask him that and he couldn't tell me he he wasn't able to express that
S0303	i mean you don't you don't make mess you're not
S0262	no
S0303	bad temper
S0262	no in fact i've help
S0303	you're not
S0262	around the house
S0303	i'm sure you have
S0262	i've clear the attic we do the we do all the sort of things
S0303	yeah yeah
S0262	that we know that we you know that you know
S0303	i mean even if you didn't
S0262	normal things
S0303	i don't think
S0262	yeah
S0303	that that would justify it but
S0262	no
S0303	you're no you know you're not cost him anything
S0262	no
S0303	either financially or
S0262	well i've just say to him listen i know that electricity be expensive and er i know that it's go to be come to winter and please let me know what we owe you
S0303	well yeah
S0262	because we'll pay for it you know there's absolutely no problem there erm er and even before when we leave to go to australia we be pay a little bite of rent for energy mostly
S0303	yeah
S0262	most of it's energy base but that when mum be alive and you know she be able to sort of cushion quite a lot of this
S0303	but if your mum be alive she'd be just so happy to have you there
S0262	well she would and he's clearly not
S0303	but he's not interest i find it i find it so strange it's i think i say it in the email as well
S0262	yeah
S0303	i find it really weird not to be interest in other people
S0262	well this be it so
S0303	cos i'm interest in everyone even people i find a real plonker
S0262	yeah
S0303	or a pain in the arse i find people fascinate
S0262	i well i mean i ask him question about his everything that he do and so
S0303	mm
S0262	erm anyway come up on the friday and be well aware that we'd have a full blow argument that morning so i actually forewarn and i say i don't know what's gonna happen this even
S0303	yeah
S0262	we're mean to be have this bottle of champagne i personally don't feel like celebrate
S0303	no
S0262	but i will fall inline
S0303	yeah yeah
S0262	because you know you're here and i'll make an effort and
S0303	yeah

S0262	it's so hard for him
S0303	he strike me as so un confrontational and just so
S0262	yeah oh it's
S0303	gentle
S0262	so hard for him to understand
S0303	and just
S0262	that it's
S0303	just plod around doesn't he
S0262	yeah
S0303	just
S0262	yeah he

S0262	let's just see how far we can push it
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know and i'll deal with this yeah i'll
S0303	but ultimately

S0262	mm
S0303	ultimately don't matter

S0303	all these things
S0262	no you're right
S0303	like
S0262	yeah
S0303	oh so what be you go to do
S0262	yeah i know i know
S0303	and so where be you gonna live and what job be you gonna do and what job's do

S0303	and you're marry
S0262	it's completely right what you've just say because i send out this email
S0303	you know you're not gonna starve in this country
S0262	no no no exactly not
S0303	you know even if
S0262	no
S0303	hypothetically your dad throw you into the street
S0262	yeah
S0303	no one in this country starve
S0262	yeah which he won't but yeah
S0303	we don't end up
S0262	yeah
S0303	in the
S0262	yeah
S0303	workhouse
S0262	that's right yeah
S0303	what's the worst that can happen
S0262	yeah exactly that's right
S0303	you know who care about
S0303	all of a sudden it's all a bite nonsense
S0262	no but you see say to me what he think be go on and say i wasn't communicate with dad so normally what apparently this be 's perspective be that dad and i would go for walk and that we'd you know we'd confide in each other and i suppose to a certain degree that's probably true but that be
S0303	okay
S0262	well before i get marry you know
S0303	yeah because now
S0262	so
S0303	i'm not be funny but now
S0262	my husband be my confidante
S0303	yeah exactly
S0262	you know so i don't know where that come from
S0303	exactly
S0262	yeah mm
S0303	i think most people confide in their mums if they're lucky enough to have one their grannies if they're lucky enough to have one
S0262	yeah
S0303	their sisters if they're lucky enough to have one
S0262	yeah
S0303	their husband wife partner
S0262	partner whoever
S0303	whatever they call it
S0262	yeah or with with
S0303	if they're lucky enough to have one
S0262	with friends
S0303	or their friends
S0262	mm
S0303	the father daughter relationship's different
S0262	mm
S0303	and and your dad might think they're communicate but they be not communicate
S0262	no they're not no no no
S0303	i've never see anything more
S0262	yeah
S0303	antithetical to communication
S0262	yeah
S0303	in my entire life
S0262	yeah they're appal at it yeah
S0303	but there's no communication
S0262	yeah no
S0303	but they probably think that's communication
S0262	yeah so sit there
S0303	and one of them do a big monologue
S0262	oh that's right
S0303	about
S0262	mm and then
S0303	something that's happen to them
S0262	you know someone
S0303	and then the other one do a massive monologue
S0262	will pick hole then an argument
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah yeah yeah mm
S0303	but that's not communicate
S0262	no it's not it's it's more like some sort of weird kind of debate so
S0303	i don't know what it be yeah
S0262	anyway i think right well if i'm go to take 's advice just
S0303	yeah
S0262	to see what happen
S0303	and he probably mean well
S0262	yeah
S0303	again
S0262	and i think why not
S0303	mm
S0262	you know it's the it's another perspective
S0303	nothing venture nothing gain
S0262	nothing gain absolutely so i write this email as an opportune moment because be in spain
S0303	oh god really
S0262	dad's in
S0303	i don't know how you cope
S0262	's in
S0303	yeah

S0303	but this be the thing about
S0262	i'm stay now for
S0303	try to communicate with people who drink they don't remember anything

S0303	they say things they don't remember say it
S0262	i have send an email yeah
S0303	you say things they don't remember you say them
S0262	mm

S0262	mm
S0303	you actually go to the trouble
S0262	mm
S0303	and invest your time
S0262	but the intention be let's keep each other
S0303	because you be try to take 's advice
S0262	yeah
S0303	's interpretation be that your dad be maybe a put out that you weren't confide in him as you use to
S0262	yeah
S0303	before you be marry
S0262	yeah
S0303	so you're think that may or may not be true but nothing venture

S0262	mm
S0303	type away
S0262	mm
S0303	and then read it through
S0262	yeah
S0303	and check that all your
S0262	yeah
S0303	apostrophes be in the right place
S0262	yeah
S0303	send cathartically
S0262	yeah
S0303	wait for the feedback
S0262	yeah and nothing
S0303	not even feedback
S0262	nothing at all
S0303	but like oh thank you for go to the trouble for
S0262	or just an acknowledgement
S0303	of spell it out and you know
S0262	yeah or anything
S0303	but i'm sorry i'm sorry it be really weird this communicate by email
S0262	i know it be but if that's what i'm reduce to
S0303	no i know i don't mean it's not come from you
S0262	yeah
S0303	you have to but it be
S0262	it's it it's
S0303	really weird
S0262	it's what i'm and the pressure
S0303	what about
S0262	i'm under i think
S0303	what about
S0262	you know
S0303	what about those email what be it now i can't remember there be something where i get some of the email thing
S0262	oh no about erm
S0303	i can't remember what it be now
S0262	dobby sit
S0303	yeah
S0262	that be when we come back you know it be like how dare you not do
S0303	but it be almost as if
S0262	what you say you be
S0303	i don't
S0262	gonna do but we didn't even know that you be go to know that
S0303	but i don't think it be
S0262	you be gonna do it
S0303	this
S0262	yeah
S0303	but my initial reaction when i saw it like almost your dad's try to like publicly shame you in a way
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't think that be what it be
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i think well why i don't want to
S0262	and also that friday even my dad be so hurtful to me he actually say things that even look at dad and have be drink but not as much as he usually have and i have forewarn him that we'd have an argument and so be kind of aware and i think be actually take aback at just how vicious my father be be to me and i call that now abuse i'm
S0303	yeah
S0262	that be it okay as far as i'm concern i've just label it
S0303	but i think erm
S0262	i know what it i know what it be but
S0303	i think they be both abusive
S0262	yeah
S0303	emotionally abusive
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think i be try to think of friends of mine
S0262	yeah
S0303	cos the thing be you know my dad be mad
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm not say that nastily
S0262	yeah
S0303	cos i love my dad but he be completely mad and violent and
S0262	yeah
S0303	all these type of things so i've get a resilience
S0262	yeah
S0303	it doesn't mean i'm not upset i be really upset by everything but i'm somehow okay because
S0262	yeah
S0303	i grow up with it and i tell you my brother's mad i just describe him
S0262	yeah
S0303	earlier
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i've have lot of those type of situations
S0262	yes yes
S0303	and it's almost as if if you've survive it then you know you're gonna be alright cos you survive in once
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you're kind of confident oh i'll be alright
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i be think like most of my friends i haven't get very many friends but the friends i have get
S0262	yeah
S0303	i be think if they'd be sit in that sit room as i have or sit in that restaurant in as i have
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think they would have describe that as emotional abuse
S0262	yeah
S0303	i didn't experience it as
S0262	yeah
S0303	emotional abuse
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i think
S0262	but it could
S0303	technically it be
S0262	could have be
S0303	and i think it fulfil
S0262	yeah
S0303	all the criteria
S0262	yeah
S0303	of emotional abuse
S0262	yeah
S0303	basically make someone feel really uncomfortable
S0262	mm mm
S0303	and just sort of
S0262	and point yeah
S0303	bang into them
S0262	to yeah
S0303	and challenge everything and
S0262	yeah
S0303	not just the accept that you've get one point of view and the other person's get another point of view
S0262	yeah
S0303	and just not let it go and just keep go on and because the other person's polite and they're a guest they obviously can't really say anything
S0262	yeah that's right
S0303	and just make someone spell something out again and again
S0262	mm
S0303	and just contradict
S0262	mm
S0303	everything
S0262	mm
S0303	and just
S0262	mm
S0303	it's like a barrage
S0262	it be it be a barrage yeah
S0303	and the other person not
S0262	no
S0303	stick up for you or anything
S0262	no
S0303	there's no sense
S0262	no
S0303	that
S0262	no oh no none none none
S0303	and just
S0262	yeah yeah just relentless
S0303	and don't get me wrong i don't
S0262	yeah
S0303	mind
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i be just think i honestly think most people i know who be not woozy
S0262	yeah
S0303	people none of them be
S0262	yeah
S0303	woozy people
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i think they would have
S0262	yeah
S0303	describe that
S0262	say hang on a minute
S0303	people
S0262	what's go on here
S0303	who have study psychology
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i think that fulfil the criteria
S0262	mm
S0303	of what constitute
S0262	mm
S0303	emotional abuse
S0262	yeah and and that be really
S0303	and just keep on say why do you think that and then you
S0262	well
S0303	you're politely try to explain why
S0262	he just say unkind things to me
S0303	and while you're explain they just repeat why
S0262	yeah
S0303	but you're actually in the process of try to answer the question
S0262	yeah
S0303	but
S0262	but won't give you a chance yeah
S0303	but you see it's
S0262	yeah
S0303	drinkers
S0262	yeah and this be it what have happen be that
S0303	that wouldn't happen if people be sober
S0262	he get upset and cos he get upset he get really into the drink erm and erm and then he just say some very unkind things which i i'm sure that you know i
S0303	would you like to share what it be or be it too excruciate
S0262	well there be one or two
S0303	you don't have to
S0262	erm well no there be one about erm so there's this seventieth birthday party go on which be friends of my dad's who be friends of my dad and erm so he say he say erm oh well 's be invite i just leave that hang you know it's like so what
S0303	so what he invite one child and not the other
S0262	well
S0303	that's weird
S0262	that's just what he say so
S0303	yeah
S0262	wouldn't read too much into how get invite
S0303	no
S0262	whether actually he be invite or not but this be what he he say
S0303	well he wouldn't wanna go anyway
S0262	's be invite so
S0303	i wouldn't have think
S0262	but really they wouldn't want to see you cos i don't really think or would want to see you they really actually want to see
S0303	why
S0262	and get that straight away and then he actually replay it around
S0303	i mean
S0303	understand this in a way i mean
S0303	i wouldn't have and whoever they be they probably don't wanna see either of you
S0262	no and in fact
S0303	not in a nasty way
S0262	that's what
S0303	not not not be personal
S0262	that's that's it's actually what say that's exactly
S0303	but why would they
S0262	what say
S0303	you know
S0262	actually say that dad he say hang on a minute i don't think actually either of them and by the way
S0303	but my friends who have get grow up kid
S0262	yeah
S0303	if i'm gonna go for a meal with them i don't i don't mind their kid be there
S0262	yeah
S0303	it would be fun but i don't actively really want to hang out with their kid
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's like
S0262	and anyway it's it's not their birthday party
S0303	no
S0262	so sort of go into this whole thing about it erm and dad be like well yes

S0262	and he do this whole thing about i think you're just be kind to your sister but i know the true story and he be like mm yes mm mm
S0303	but that's very vicious
S0262	begrudgingly
S0303	and snide and
S0262	so poor be sit there watch all of this and er and i think you know that's when sort of think right this isn't just some sort of emotional argument and there's some sort of sense of you know loss about you know mum this be now a different realm
S0303	this be now cruelty
S0262	this be now something else
S0303	it's cruelty it may not be intentional cruelty in fact i don't think it be
S0262	right
S0303	but it be cruelty
S0262	and i
S0303	even if it's not mean like that
S0262	i'm not i'm not drink you know at all really you know i have a glass or two of champagne so i really be kind of like get where it be come from and then i have saturday to think about it and sunday and i go off for a long walk and sort of
S0303	god
S0262	and a chat and i say actually
S0303	sound horrible
S0262	yeah okay no i now i do understand what's go on
S0303	can i say something just
S0262	yeah
S0303	this be where i have trouble with life
S0262	yeah
S0303	because of the way i be i'm really unassertive
S0262	right
S0303	just because i can't usually be bother
S0262	yeah
S0303	but when it's for someone else i become the most assertive person in the world
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	and my problem be i don't think i expect anything of anyone i think i expect less of anybody on this
S0262	yeah
S0303	planet than anyone on this planet i've ever meet
S0262	yeah
S0303	in my entire life
S0262	yeah
S0303	but one thing i do expect it never happen but i do expect i expect someone to stick up for me
S0262	mm
S0303	and
S0262	mm
S0303	it's not a criticism
S0262	mm
S0303	it's just to do with different people and
S0262	mm
S0303	their expectations if i be in your position i would have expect both and
S0262	yeah
S0303	in unison when your dad get onto the second sentence to go stop speak to like that
S0262	yeah
S0303	not not swear at him
S0262	yeah
S0303	not be rude not be disrespectful but dad please don't speak to like this
S0262	yeah
S0303	in front of me
S0262	yeah
S0303	that's what i'd expect
S0262	yeah
S0303	and it never happen
S0262	happen no it doesn't
S0303	everyone's so spineless
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	i've be in
S0262	that's yeah
S0303	those situations so many time you totally lose respect for someone
S0262	yeah yeah it's really hard yeah
S0303	even if i couldn't stand someone even if someone be my mortal enemy
S0262	yeah
S0303	if someone start lay into them unfairly i would
S0262	yeah
S0303	immediately
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'd say stop it
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i i do
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i have
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i'm so erm as i say unassertive so i just
S0262	yeah
S0303	can't be bother to engage half the time
S0262	but on that on that that yeah
S0303	it's like a sense of justice
S0262	yes
S0303	i remember erm
S0262	yeah
S0303	i oh i could give you so many examples where i've say something
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i've be in so many situations where the people who be suppose to think i'm so great and have such loyalty and love for me and everything they just sit there like a
S0262	yeah
S0303	pussy basically
S0262	just yeah
S0303	that's what my students would say
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know like
S0262	yeah and no well i acknowledge that and i i think to myself so many time
S0303	but i really have get unrealistic expectations people just it's not gonna happen
S0262	that that's also where i be at
S0303	but it's not as if i expect it to happen
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't expect anything else and i don't expect anything else
S0262	yeah
S0303	you just expect that if you're under attack someone defend you
S0262	yeah
S0303	wouldn't you
S0262	you would yeah
S0303	i don't know why i still expect it
S0262	yeah
S0303	but
S0262	yeah and that's what i realise that it's probably better for to go you know
S0303	oh poor
S0262	i know because
S0303	i know i don't really know
S0262	because i mean i'm sure he'd love to challenge my father

S0303	glass or bottle
S0262	erm that's fine
S0303	this
S0262	yeah thank
S0303	what i really miss about be all the all the trinkety things that granny and mummy get while they be travel and you know all those things and because daddy be more on the minimalist side he's very masculine about the whole thing
S0303	yeah
S0262	i mean everything
S0262	just have to go you know when mum die it be just deal with it and it all you know accord to him he take things away but i don't recall it that way at all
S0303	but you might like to have them there
S0262	well there be things that i you know move in my direction and take with me but there be so many things so many things
S0303	what i find perplex be your your dad think of that as his house
S0262	yeah now it be yeah
S0303	and you and go and visit
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	whereas i think of it as all three of your house
S0262	yeah but interest though
S0303	to the extent to which you want it to be
S0262	er
S0303	you know
S0262	right and interestingly when mum and gran be there
S0303	because the house come from your but i know this sound awful but
S0262	i know
S0303	it would have be different if the house have come from his parent
S0262	yes
S0303	that would be a bite different
S0262	yeah
S0303	i know it shouldn't
S0262	yeah but the dynamic always be be that when we move in erm and then later the years it play out like oh i really want to do this garden oh i'd really like to do that to the garden
S0303	well do it then
S0262	but your mum won't let me your you know your grandmother won't let me so there be always this kind of
S0303	but then why would you even
S0262	interplay between
S0303	mention it then
S0262	it's not my house really and he say well i do put so and so much money into it and i have
S0303	oh well well do
S0262	pay for the you know extension
S0303	sorry
S0262	so why shouldn't i be able to put a tree here and i say well maybe the tree shouldn't go there maybe the tree should go somewhere else i'm not so sure
S0303	but
S0262	but you know and it be always this thing and
S0303	power
S0262	now i feel like
S0303	it be power struggle isn't it
S0262	yes now mum's go
S0303	now you've take over
S0262	bumph
S0303	the role unwittingly
S0262	yes and i think
S0303	you've be cast in the role of
S0262	cheer and he's and he's
S0303	cheer
S0262	already call me erm a couple of time
S0303	i'd love to have i mean i wouldn't like to know actually but i'd love to know what it be actually like for your mum and dad or for you mum
S0262	i would say it be probably all bloody awful
S0303	so would i
S0262	really awful
S0303	so would i i be think about that
S0262	mm really awful
S0303	and again no ill will intend
S0262	no no
S0303	and no harm mean but it be it's so
S0262	but i think it would have be
S0303	emotional
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0303	a barrage
S0262	yeah she really stand up to him
S0303	and it's just so tell
S0262	but i think over the years towards the last part
S0303	i just don't see the point in stand up because
S0262	no
S0303	nothing's achieve
S0262	yeah well it wasn't in the end
S0303	no
S0262	yeah
S0303	if if it's somebody who relate
S0262	yeah
S0303	then i will stand up
S0262	yeah
S0303	for myself but really
S0262	yeah
S0303	there'd be absolutely no point
S0262	no no and i've try
S0303	i think i tell you
S0262	all my life to stand up to my father
S0303	there's no point
S0262	yeah
S0303	bang your head against the wall
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think i tell you in the email when i for me this be really brave cos i'm the kind of person that i think you should be polite to people's parent and stuff i say really nicely i say oh i don't mean to be rude but we've actually already have this
S0262	yeah
S0303	exact same conversation
S0262	yeah
S0303	he go well i think we need to have it again
S0262	yeah that's a typical response yeah
S0303	but i be think maybe he and didn't remember
S0262	no i don't think they do and actually think you're also quite right be that that this word oblivious be i'm oblivious
S0303	but it's like it be not
S0262	because i want to be you know
S0303	really my prefer choice of subject
S0262	yeah
S0303	the first time round but
S0262	yeah
S0303	please not again because
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm just gonna say exactly what i say last time and you're gonna say exactly because
S0262	yeah
S0303	we both think what we think
S0262	yeah and what happen after that when you tell him that after he say
S0303	we have to have the whole conversation again
S0262	oh oh god
S0303	almost word for word from the last time
S0262	it's like a script
S0303	yeah
S0262	oh my god
S0303	but it be hilarious
S0262	that that's freaky
S0303	i think if my mum be here
S0262	yeah
S0303	just be in hysterics well i think we need to have it again
S0303	it wasn't that no we didn't
S0262	no not tonight
S0303	it wasn't like how dare you say that
S0303	or don't be so rude it be just like
S0262	forceful
S0303	yeah and i be think well you're not gonna remember it this time either
S0262	no no no
S0303	but there be a really funny side
S0262	yeah
S0303	but it's a funny side if you can get on the train the next day
S0262	yes and leave it and that's
S0303	yeah
S0262	and say oh well whatever
S0303	and if
S0262	yeah
S0303	there's none of that sort of dynamic and none of that tension
S0262	yeah
S0303	and none of that past
S0262	yeah
S0303	and none of that baggage as they say
S0262	yeah
S0303	nowadays
S0262	yeah but it be quite funny because i start all this yoga stuff this week cos it's like forty pound for unlimited yoga for a month so
S0303	oh
S0262	i've be do everything and it's like
S0303	oh yeah
S0262	as far as i can i've be yoga this yoga that twice a er twice a day and already i've sort of cotton on to a few things and also the instructors erm first one ask me oh erm do you do you sit at the sit at the computer a lot and i think no actually i don't but i say yes because i just think that maybe if i say yes then you know they'd be able to sort of help my body get into some kind of posture or something
S0303	yeah i see what you mean
S0262	so i just say yes
S0303	yeah
S0262	as a shorthand to yes something's wrong i acknowledge it
S0303	yeah
S0262	erm so they be right fine so they be you know help me get more into the thing i think oh god i actually haven't really spend that much at the computer i wonder what's go on there and then another one say something like oh you've get very tight erm hamstring or something like this and i say oh yes i think it's because i run he say no but be that because you sit at the computer a lot
S0262	these two different people so i just say yes again its be just like whatever
S0303	it's so funny yeah just say something tell them what they wanna hear
S0262	yeah and then i ring her and i think to myself
S0303	divert hostility
S0262	this be
S0303	avoid confrontation
S0262	and they've all be lovely about it you know but i just think well i'll just say yeah and then i think to myself okay no i really haven't spend much time at the computer this
S0303	no
S0262	as an example i finish my job in december
S0303	yeah
S0262	and i've really be on the road
S0303	yeah
S0262	have so much fun
S0303	yeah
S0262	do all sort of things
S0303	exactly
S0262	with my body swim
S0303	but that's also what make it so hard which i don't think anyone appreciate
S0262	oh no no
S0303	have have anyone
S0262	no
S0303	even think about that
S0262	oh god no no no but just to finish that bite so
S0303	yeah
S0262	there's something go on with my body that it's almost like somebody who spend twelve or thirteen hours a day
S0303	yeah because you're so tense
S0262	and that's when i think well
S0303	cos you're so tense
S0262	i be so tense
S0303	cos you're try to protect yourself
S0262	i'm really tense yes i think it be that
S0303	and i think in the olden days there be a different frame of reference and there be a different vocabulary and a different terminology and different expectations about everything in the olden days it would have just be oh well that's how things be
S0262	yeah
S0303	but now that we inhabit this psycho world
S0262	yeah
S0303	these things be abuse
S0262	yeah
S0303	they be
S0262	yeah
S0303	i mean it's all a matter of definition and it's not
S0262	yeah and it's all relative
S0303	the semantics
S0262	that's right
S0303	to some extent but
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	i do think nowadays
S0262	yeah
S0303	the accept opinion
S0262	mm mm would be
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah and even my i i
S0303	i bet you if i do a psychology nvq or something
S0262	yeah
S0303	module one
S0262	yeah
S0303	it would give you in er ten bullet point
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	and i bet you you've get all ten of them
S0262	yeah yeah no wonder my body's feel like this
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know and now i know that it's just him and i in the house so there be that sort of add thing but i'm aware of
S0303	thank god for dobby
S0262	well i know
S0303	thank god for walk dobby
S0262	but i'm also really aware of what's go on you know so i suppose
S0303	yeah
S0262	in a sense
S0303	you've get the insight
S0262	i've get the yoga thing go on
S0303	whereas no one else have
S0262	as well
S0303	no but no one else have no one else
S0262	and er and she say oh you know do this so that you feel root and ground right yeah i'm gonna definitely try and feel that
S0303	yeah
S0262	now we've get to sort of move some blockages here and round in a bite and i'm go yes i wanna move those bits so i'm kind of think well in a way i'm try to help myself
S0303	yeah and it's just survival strategy
S0262	i find myself in the situation of cop
S0303	cop mechanisms
S0262	yeah
S0303	all those clichés
S0262	whatever yeah
S0303	yeah whatever get you through
S0262	yeah exactly
S0303	it doesn't matter what it be
S0262	yeah get me out of the house
S0303	yeah
S0303	i mean it doesn't matter if i mean even if it be a cult
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know just anything
S0262	yeah
S0303	just to
S0262	exactly
S0303	put some distance between you
S0262	i think of type of you know for for
S0303	yeah but i honestly honestly just to
S0262	yeah
S0303	be around people
S0262	mm
S0303	who respond to you in such a way that you realise i'm actually quite a likeable person
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i don't have any major personality
S0262	yeah
S0303	issue because everybody else who you come into contact with love you
S0262	yeah ah it's funny isn't it
S0303	i tell you i saw and
S0303	really briefly
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	oh my goodness
S0262	yeah
S0303	oh 's so amaze
S0262	yeah oh wow
S0303	she's so nice she's know and
S0262	i bet wasn't buy a word of that
S0303	well he
S0262	this sort of thing
S0303	he be he be outside with one of them smoke i think
S0262	right
S0303	and then so i be talk to one of them and then he go outside with the other one so we i only ever
S0262	didn't really get a chance
S0303	no
S0262	to sort of
S0303	but it be really funny completely unprompted
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	you know
S0262	oh that's nice i should really get to see them yeah
S0303	but i just think you just need to bear in mind that
S0262	yeah
S0303	other people
S0262	yeah
S0303	respond to you in a very positive way
S0262	they do yeah
S0303	with huge warmth
S0262	yes
S0303	and like
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	and approval
S0262	yeah i know
S0303	and without any criticism and without any erm
S0262	no
S0303	things to quibble about or
S0262	yeah
S0303	anything to criticise or
S0262	yeah i know i i think he's really miss out
S0303	but i think it's really important to bear that in mind
S0262	yeah
S0303	because sometimes
S0262	yeah
S0303	you do start buy into other people
S0262	true
S0303	perceptions
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	especially if you're expose to that person all the time
S0262	yeah
S0303	especially if you're under the same roof
S0262	yeah
S0303	you almost take on
S0262	yeah you do
S0303	their view of you
S0262	yeah
S0303	and you start think
S0262	oh i felt like that exactly
S0303	maybe i be take advantage
S0262	yeah and say to me but what's happen
S0303	maybe i be disrupt everything with the bake bean
S0262	right
S0303	replacement
S0262	i mean all these things about you know whatever dad's get in mind for me or or whatever but you know i could feel like you're say you know this be his perspective be sort of start to eat away
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know this wonderful sort of
S0303	yeah
S0262	glow that and i would have have
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know when we arrive back erm and actually say to me listen to yourself
S0303	yeah
S0262	you're now begin to sound like
S0303	i know exactly
S0262	your father
S0303	i think take it on
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think
S0262	he do
S0303	become like a
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's almost as if your dad's live vicariously
S0262	yeah
S0303	through
S0262	yeah
S0303	and willingly submit
S0262	mm
S0303	to allow your dad
S0262	mm
S0303	to live vicariously through him
S0262	mm well i think that's what generally
S0303	it's really weird
S0262	annoy my father
S0303	because
S0262	be that i'm not allow that to happen
S0303	no
S0262	yet no
S0303	but 's get all these delusions about everything but your dad
S0262	yeah
S0303	enable them
S0262	yeah
S0303	but act really admiringly towards
S0262	yeah
S0303	all these things that be not real
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know so then
S0262	yeah
S0303	that encourage to to give
S0262	more of that
S0303	even more like that
S0262	that's right yeah oh yeah absolutely
S0303	but i think it's almost as if 's the it sound awful but it's almost as if 's sort the ventriloquist's dummy and your dad's the person
S0262	yeah
S0303	speak it's almost as if 's life be your dad live through
S0262	yeah
S0303	and
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	this like oh be so important and everything
S0262	yeah yeah i i i see it like that yeah
S0303	it's almost as if that's the only way you can get approval
S0262	yes it be
S0303	be by sort of
S0262	it be the only way you can get approval
S0303	be this kind of but it's all fake
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know it's
S0262	yeah
S0303	and none of it's real
S0262	yeah
S0303	and even if it be real so what
S0262	yeah it doesn't matter yeah and i think that's
S0303	but your dad love it
S0262	genuinely
S0303	your dad love it oh yes
S0262	yeah i think that's genuinely what annoy him about me
S0303	yeah cos you don't play along
S0262	no
S0303	but i think that's also perhaps a factor in why make things up
S0262	yeah yep
S0303	because he's so use to only get approval if you act
S0262	yeah
S0303	like all this fake stuff
S0262	yes
S0303	that he think
S0262	yeah
S0303	that no one's gonna like him if he's just
S0262	yeah the i
S0303	tell the truth
S0262	that's that's definitely true and then anyway from my perspective
S0303	yeah
S0262	that be yeah
S0303	cos i try to say
S0262	i mean i've look at stories
S0303	i try to say like you're very likeable
S0262	yeah
S0303	why do you make things up all the time
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's embarrass
S0262	yeah yeah and he's still play that game

S0262	and
S0303	it's sad though
S0262	i've be able to sort of
S0303	step back
S0262	sidestep that you know
S0303	eventually

S0303	definitely definitely
S0262	i've read the bloody play

S0303	it's just like so nice not to be freeze cold
S0262	yeah
S0303	and have some air
S0262	yeah exactly it's so mild here
S0303	but i remember my first ever interview oh no it wasn't my first ever interview it be the first interview that i get a job from
S0262	mm
S0303	and it wasn't that i be try to be clever but when i look back i find it really funny
S0262	right
S0303	cos it's sort of arrogant but then it's sort of not the guy ask me the headmaster ask me
S0262	yeah
S0303	what do you think's exceptional about you
S0262	okay oh god
S0303	and i just think oh for fuck's sake you know
S0262	oh god what a question
S0303	and i say well i think the only thing i can think of that be exceptional about me be that i don't think there's anything exceptional about me
S0262	i love it
S0303	i say i don't know i say i presume most people think there be lot of exceptional things about them i say i have to be truthful cos i don't wanna get the job under false pretences
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't think there's anything exceptional about me
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	i say i think i'm reliable
S0262	it's that's a great answer
S0303	i turn up on time i'm cheerful i meet my deadlines
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but there be nothing exceptional about me
S0262	yeah
S0303	let's be honest
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i get the job
S0262	i would i oh great
S0303	bloody hell this be such a stupid question what do you think be exceptional about you i think i'm gonna demean myself for
S0262	no
S0303	just for a salary i'm not
S0262	yeah
S0303	well
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know i think
S0303	i'm well
S0262	i've wash my hair for fifty minutes
S0303	yeah you know i'm i'm
S0262	every day
S0303	very academic or you know
S0303	you know i be in the i don't know i wasn't in any sport days but let's just say i be but it be there's nothing there's nothing exceptional about anyone
S0262	i know i
S0303	there's nothing exceptional about anyone
S0262	i know i know
S0303	at least i'm not gonna
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	humiliate myself
S0262	yeah
S0303	by make up i'm some sort of
S0303	cos then you know imagine if they do employ me and they're wait to see all these exceptional
S0262	yeah
S0303	characteristics
S0262	yeah
S0303	there aren't any cos i'm not you know
S0262	which be i think bizarre about that whole interview with for one of the interview i can't even remember which one it be
S0303	i haven't hear anything about him and his
S0262	and he come up with some cock and bull story which obviously he's very good at do erm and he just sort of it come out of the blue be like well you know if you're if you you know have er something on on your on your cv as in you live in or anything or you have live in whatever erm so why didn't you go to university of or university and he come out with this whole thing apparently which
S0303	i would just say cos i wasn't clever enough
S0262	and i just look at each other and go oh my god it's get to this and dad say i think that's very well do
S0303	oh of course
S0262	that's very well do
S0303	of course cos they're in
S0262	well
S0303	they're in cahoots
S0262	well do
S0303	they collude with each other
S0262	you know he say that's very clever very responsive
S0303	i say to once i say and i be genuinely hundred percent i'm sure if you give me the truth drug and psychoanalyse me i'm sure i be genuinely try to be nice i wasn't try to be nice
S0262	yeah
S0303	i say do you think the reason that you're so unhappy at work be because you misrepresent yourself
S0262	mm
S0303	you portray yourself as you aren't
S0262	somebody who you're not
S0303	really
S0262	yeah
S0303	and so
S0262	and you be just
S0303	and i be just think
S0262	yeah
S0303	let's say if i do make out that i be really exceptional and so they take me on on the understand that i be a really amaze
S0262	yeah
S0303	person i'm not
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm ordinary
S0262	and so you have to live up to this expectation
S0303	and you're constantly lie and you're constantly
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's better just to be truthful about what you be
S0262	mm
S0303	because then the sort of people who take you on be the sort of people who want someone like you
S0262	yeah
S0303	and so
S0262	exactly
S0303	cos i've always like all my job right from
S0262	yeah
S0303	when i be a cleaner babysitting
S0262	yeah
S0303	shop assistant
S0262	yeah
S0303	washer upper
S0262	exactly yeah
S0303	everything
S0262	fundamentally
S0303	i've ever do
S0262	i've like my job as well
S0303	have be fine i've never felt
S0262	no nothing like that
S0303	and the university i didn't like it i get out
S0262	yeah
S0303	and the school i didn't like it so i get out
S0262	yeah
S0303	but that wasn't because of me
S0262	no
S0303	rub anyone up the wrong way
S0262	no
S0303	it be just because i wasn't suit to it
S0262	the condition yeah yeah
S0303	but i think if you represent yourself as somebody who you're not
S0262	yeah
S0303	then you're never gonna be
S0262	you're ask for trouble
S0303	happy at work because they're
S0262	no
S0303	wait for you to be this person
S0262	yeah
S0303	that you've say you be
S0262	er or to trip up
S0303	but you aren't that person
S0262	which be what
S0303	you aren't that person
S0262	you know
S0303	you're not exceptional
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	you know you might be good at what you do
S0262	mm
S0303	i'm not dispute i'm sure he probably be
S0262	yeah
S0303	but you know most people if you've do something for long enough you become quite good at it don't you
S0262	yeah
S0303	i mean
S0262	yeah i think that come from
S0303	but i say it to be nice cos i think
S0262	yeah and what do he actually say though
S0303	nothing
S0262	no he wouldn't have know what you be talk about
S0303	nothing he wasn't nasty he
S0262	yeah
S0303	like take he take it i think he
S0262	yeah
S0303	take it in
S0262	yeah nothing to say
S0303	possibly no no nothing doesn't respond
S0262	no no response
S0303	i be try to be nice i be think that's what i'd want someone to tell me cos i'm sure
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm do load of things wrong in my life i want someone to tell me
S0262	yeah
S0303	i might not i might not like it but
S0262	no but
S0303	eventually i'll start think about it
S0262	well yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	that's how i be and i often ask people
S0303	i be try to be nice
S0262	can you just let me know
S0303	tell me what i'm do wrong
S0262	yeah
S0303	tell me
S0262	anything doesn't matter
S0303	yeah
S0262	how big or small
S0303	i don't care
S0262	i kind of think i can handle it
S0303	probably won't like it but it's nice
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	i'm sure it's not go to whole disrupt my whole life you know
S0303	but can you imagine if you make out that you're really great then
S0262	yeah
S0303	everyone's wait for you to great
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but you're not great
S0262	yeah and i think
S0303	cos
S0262	this come from
S0303	no one's great
S0262	my dad
S0303	yeah
S0262	have never
S0303	i know
S0262	be to university always have want to go choose this track which he could get into the army which be basically something he could do
S0303	yeah
S0262	and then become an officer and then i think really fight for some sense of identity
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know
S0303	and approval
S0262	yeah
S0303	and status
S0262	from his father
S0303	but you see when your dad's the only time i've really speak to your dad i haven't really speak to your dad at all but the only time i've any anything resemble a conversation with your dad when he's be sober
S0262	yeah
S0303	have be when we sit together at breakfast
S0262	yeah
S0303	now this weird sit on the sofa
S0262	yeah
S0303	sit on the sofa
S0262	yeah
S0303	i should say past tense
S0262	yeah
S0303	well your dad be very nice and he once say oh you know i sometimes i sometimes regret that i didn't go to university but i think overall i do the right thing
S0262	mm
S0303	and i say to him if you'd work at university as i have
S0262	mm
S0303	you'd realise that it's a total load of
S0262	mm
S0303	cobblers
S0303	and i say
S0262	yeah
S0303	people who haven't have that education
S0262	mm
S0303	like my family
S0262	mm
S0303	they assume that
S0262	oh yeah
S0303	people who have go to university
S0262	yeah
S0303	like wow i say believe me
S0262	yeah poppycock
S0303	i say
S0262	yeah
S0303	any way of define intelligence
S0262	yeah
S0303	any way
S0262	isn't isn't
S0303	you're probably
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	higher than ninety five percent
S0262	yeah
S0303	of the people
S0262	yeah
S0303	i've work with but be mean to be the sixth
S0262	yeah
S0303	best in the world or something
S0262	yeah probably be
S0303	i say so don't
S0262	yeah
S0303	have a thing about it
S0262	yeah
S0303	i say i'm sure you know that already but it's all a load of twaddle
S0262	yeah oh well that would have really have you know
S0303	well i wasn't try to
S0262	yeah but that would have do though
S0303	yeah but it's true
S0262	yeah
S0303	but they
S0262	no i agree with part of that you know i really do i really do
S0303	basically nowadays everyone go to university you have the opportunity to go to university
S0262	yeah
S0303	you go and in
S0262	yeah
S0303	the old days
S0262	yeah
S0303	you have to be either very clever or very privilege
S0262	yeah exactly
S0303	and that's change now
S0262	yeah that's so true yeah
S0303	but i know that
S0262	yeah
S0303	i didn't know that at the time when i apply
S0262	no
S0303	when i apply i think oh i'm gonna
S0262	yeah
S0303	be sit with people talk about wittgenstein all day and
S0303	it's gonna be amaze all we're gonna do be talk about shakespeare and schopenhauer and it's gonna be so intellectually and then i
S0262	yeah
S0303	after one day
S0262	yeah
S0303	i realise that it be just a
S0262	just a sort of
S0303	conveyor belt for the middle class
S0262	that's right yeah
S0303	you know it's not a bad thing i enjoy those
S0262	yeah
S0303	years but
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	it's nothing to do with intelligence
S0262	it's one way of do things
S0303	nothing
S0262	yeah
S0303	i mean literally nothing
S0262	no no no
S0303	zero
S0262	no no no no no no no
S0303	but tell me one of his lie go oh my dad's get a phd in erm advance mathematics and i say no he hasn't cos he tell me he'd never be to university
S0262	mm mm
S0303	and he go no he do it as an adult i say well you can't do a phd without do a degree
S0262	mm
S0303	he go i swear i swear on my life i swear on my life he's a phd in advance mathematics and i be just so embarrass i just go oh okay
S0262	yeah
S0303	i think this be just really embarrass this be
S0262	i mean so
S0303	it's not true
S0262	so so part of that that that isn't true
S0303	no
S0262	but i can see where the lie spring from be you know dad go to erm a erm i suppose it's it would have be an an you know academic arm of the army
S0303	yeah
S0262	where you go and do some quite interest shit
S0303	oh yeah i don't doubt it and i say to
S0262	which
S0303	i say
S0262	may have be on of a level
S0303	yeah but that's not the same as have
S0262	somewhat but it's er but i wouldn't quite go to doctorate level you know
S0303	but i say to
S0262	it might be more sort of
S0303	i say i'm not
S0262	post grad but
S0303	i'm not say he couldn't have
S0262	yeah i don't think he be
S0303	do one but
S0262	do original research yeah i don't think so
S0303	because he but
S0262	no
S0303	the only reason i be sure of this
S0262	yeah
S0303	be because he have sit down and say oh
S0262	yeah
S0303	about i never
S0262	and he actually know what he's talk about
S0303	oh
S0262	he know the difference between a phd and you know sort of a professional course
S0303	and i don't think your dad doesn't lie
S0262	no
S0303	i don't think er he doesn't make up things
S0262	no he doesn't no
S0303	no i've never
S0262	no well i mean he can bend the truth somewhat
S0303	yeah yeah but the same as everyone
S0262	but that's not the same
S0303	i don't i don't think
S0262	i just call it call it the irish you know yeah
S0303	yeah but i think that's something 's come up with on his own
S0262	oh he's do fabricate
S0303	yeah
S0262	god know what he fabricate about me and that and actually sometimes i do meet people who erm i have never meet before and there be expectations and er you know
S0303	mm
S0262	i fall short you know quite a lot of the time and i i'm i wonder where do that really sort of that sort of spring from oh yeah of course you know
S0303	it's make up
S0262	must have say something about that la la
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know
S0303	cos when i sort of
S0262	but then when they get to know me better
S0303	yeah
S0262	they say actually oh you be the elder sister as in more mature
S0303	yeah it's funny isn't it
S0262	because they really know now they've catch it out like or catch him out
S0303	yeah
S0262	that actually he's still in kid mode where he's lie where little kid would sort of say something oh you know
S0303	yeah
S0262	oh i i get five pound for my pocket money
S0303	yeah but
S0262	but you didn't
S0303	no
S0262	you know something like that
S0303	you didn't get any
S0262	yeah exactly
S0303	but if someone it's difficult
S0262	you know
S0303	because i don't think
S0262	i win a bronze
S0303	there's no point
S0262	no no gold medal
S0303	there's no point
S0262	no you win a gold medal
S0303	have a conversation
S0262	yeah
S0303	for no reason
S0262	no
S0303	but at the same time you sort of feel that maybe you're collude if you just kind of go oh you know
S0262	well the thing be be that he doesn't do it with me anymore
S0303	no okay
S0262	at all you know and i've
S0303	okay
S0262	actually get him into the you know well a relationship i would say where i don't
S0303	no it's difficult though isn't it cos if
S0262	just don't stand for it but
S0303	cos
S0262	if you're an outsider as in
S0303	cos i think it be all true
S0262	you're get to know him yeah absolutely
S0303	i would genuinely think it be all true cos i think
S0262	yeah
S0303	why would someone
S0262	lie yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah but you know there's
S0303	to me
S0262	so many time where i've catch out so many time i've pull him up on it
S0303	but i could understand
S0262	you know
S0303	why you might lie to someone who will only like you if you're a certain type of person
S0262	mm
S0303	and you know i
S0262	mm
S0303	it doesn't make it right but it make sense
S0262	mm mm
S0303	but i mean surely me i mean who would even
S0262	yeah
S0303	care what i think you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's like
S0262	yeah no i i don't know and he do do it with lot and lot of people but it's really interest how i'll tell you a story about this that talk about lie and it take one to know one but when before and i get marry we have to you know obviously we have to organise where we're go to get marry
S0303	must be so nice just cos he's so different
S0262	yeah
S0303	he's just so
S0262	i know
S0303	he's so different
S0262	he be so good like
S0303	i mean he's really the other extreme
S0262	yeah
S0303	isn't he
S0262	yeah yes
S0303	it's like i mean i don't
S0262	extremely
S0303	i don't know him but that's just the impression i get
S0262	yeah

S0303	have to remind myself
S0262	and erm we meet he meet the the owner of the place that we be get marry erm
S0303	yeah
S0262	and now this be all a little bite of an odd situation because my mum and my dad and er and i be have erm a drink at this pub nearby
S0303	yeah
S0262	so it be the area
S0303	yes
S0262	so the the the the erm the place where we be gonna get marry where where we get marry and the owner walk in and i must say i suppose i be a little bite take in by him but then i think well i'm get marry so i don't really care
S0303	no
S0262	as long as things go well
S0303	yeah
S0262	erm
S0303	as long as everyone's happy
S0262	he he he can tell me what he bloody well want
S0303	what do you need to do
S0262	you know
S0303	show up in a frock and smile
S0262	yeah
S0303	and go home
S0262	exactly
S0303	you know
S0262	and he's just get to do his bite
S0303	yeah
S0262	but that's fine
S0303	yeah
S0262	okay so i think
S0303	no no point worry
S0262	yeah
S0303	that's what i always think as well
S0262	and no no point sort of really worry about
S0303	engage
S0262	any of this
S0303	particularly
S0262	exactly
S0303	yeah
S0262	so when he walk in i notice that there be a sense of erm animosity from the other people in the pub now this pub be a
S0303	okay
S0262	village pub
S0303	that's interest
S0262	and er the landlady er really didn't like the fact that he'd walk in and he say but i be with a client so i'm sit here
S0303	be you the client
S0262	but i'm go to have a drink but we hadn't invite him and we hadn't organise to meet him at all
S0303	oh god
S0262	i think in pass
S0303	it's this ego thing
S0262	we say we might go to this pub anyway walk in because he want to have a drink and we're all go to go home together okay
S0303	okay
S0262	he's come up to
S0303	seem fine everything yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	get a taxi to this place
S0303	mm
S0262	where we all meet together
S0303	mm
S0262	we all have a drink and then
S0303	mm
S0262	we'll go home and have something to eat
S0303	mm
S0262	and he get talk to this guy and slowly but surely it be become quite argumentative
S0303	okay
S0262	and be pull him up on all sort of manners of things things that i think oh my god here we go this
S0303	so be you like tune in to the conversation or be you just get an impression of the vibe
S0262	it there well erm i be talk to my mum and i be desperately try to ignore it erm because i think
S0303	yeah but
S0262	i mean this isn't your wed
S0303	at the side line of your consciousness
S0262	yes yeah yeah
S0303	you can tell that there's something
S0262	yeah
S0303	rumble
S0262	yeah and i notice that my dad go become really silent
S0303	okay which be unusual
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't mean that rudely
S0262	well well no
S0303	but i mean it's unusual
S0262	but i mean normally he'd be chat
S0303	yeah
S0262	erm but he'd become silent so i think
S0303	cos i'm quite quite quiet
S0262	yeah
S0303	like socially
S0262	but normally
S0303	unless
S0262	he would just be sort of engage in that
S0303	yeah no he be quite chatty isn't he
S0262	yeah
S0303	he's quite
S0262	you know i'm the father of the bride to be
S0303	yeah yeah yeah of course
S0262	i'll talk shit for a little while
S0303	and it's all excite and
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	but he'd really
S0303	and everyone's have a drink
S0262	kind of go silent exactly
S0303	so everyone become
S0262	yeah
S0303	a bite more ebullient
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	and it be just gonna be the one
S0303	yeah
S0262	and you know okay i could see that have a couple of win on the way up because
S0303	yeah yeah
S0262	you could smell it on his breath
S0303	yeah
S0262	but he wasn't
S0303	no no no
S0262	at all
S0303	he's still still socially acceptable
S0262	you know yeah
S0262	as far as i be concern
S0303	yeah
S0262	anyway
S0303	yeah
S0262	erm and er you know he didn't look bedraggle or anything
S0303	no
S0262	so i and then i start to ignore it and then i look at my dad and he say i think it's really time to go and
S0303	your dad say
S0262	we all get up to leave and say no i think we should stay for another
S0303	okay but you and your dad be obviously attune to the fact that the vibe for want of a better word wasn't ideal
S0262	wasn't go too well yeah
S0303	but either be aware of that but be enjoy it or be oblivious
S0262	erm say i think we should stay for another another drink and
S0303	cos you can tell you can tell i can
S0262	mm
S0303	i can never articulate it
S0262	mm
S0303	but you can just tell when
S0262	oh god
S0303	you be thank you so much
S0262	i i couldn't decide at that point which either or the the two options that you've say
S0303	mm
S0262	but so we stay
S0303	yeah
S0262	and then make a quite a big thing about buy this guy a drink
S0303	okay
S0262	and erm
S0303	so this guy generally hadn't create a very positive impression of himself he hadn't really
S0262	when he wasn't in the pub er in his own term you know he be sell his place like
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know you're the clients i'm go to sell you everything
S0303	the spiel
S0262	absolutely which well one
S0303	yeah
S0262	would expect
S0303	exactly
S0262	that's quite normal how be you
S0303	totally totally totally
S0262	how be you go to decide otherwise someone's sell you something
S0303	totally right totally
S0262	something as important as your wed day
S0303	yeah
S0262	so there you go
S0303	it's the way it go
S0303	you play the game go through the motion
S0262	we'd already sign on the
S0303	yeah
S0262	on the contract
S0303	anyway
S0262	it's all yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	so
S0303	but your dad's obviously feel uncomfortable and want to leave
S0262	very much so
S0303	and obviously get in his element and want to stay
S0262	mm
S0303	so there's be a divergence
S0262	yes
S0303	of desire here
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	and this guy's sit right in the middle of it
S0303	right
S0262	and he accept this drink
S0303	and the only other people there be you and
S0262	and my mum
S0303	and your mum of course
S0262	yeah
S0303	god yeah of course
S0262	who nip out for a cigarette
S0303	oh poor your mum

S0262	yeah
S0303	real to me
S0262	yeah
S0303	the 's mum that be in my mind

S0262	yeah i would say that's fair so we nip out for a cigarette and i say what the hell be do she say i don't know but i don't like it and i say she say i really think we shouldn't have stay for another drink somebody should have put their foot down
S0303	yeah well exactly
S0262	anyway so we come back in
S0262	and then we be right into the middle of it the thick of it and be pule this guy up on everything he's say he can't utter a word or a phrase or a sentence
S0303	why though
S0262	or utterance and then he but really so how's that then how would you have go to and study this and do that because i know full well i use to work for

S0262	yeah exactly and then last week or whatever it be come up you know and we have the champagne to celebrate his birthday and then my eighth wed anniversary and two things that bring up be one how awful be at the wed and secondly how right he be about this guy be an absolute you know can't remember the word that use
S0303	he's obsess with how awful be at the wed
S0262	yeah and both of them be
S0303	but 's
S0262	yeah
S0303	mental so you have to
S0262	yeah and actually now at that point my dad soften and say erm which be quite surprise cos cos he actually call erm the mutant
S0303	he be a bite of a mutant but he's not a bad person
S0262	and er you know as far as i be concern
S0303	and he be mad he be
S0262	you know
S0303	actually mad mad and
S0262	well he yeah he genuinely
S0303	you know like nowadays
S0262	be mad
S0303	everyone's
S0262	yeah
S0303	depress everyone's this and everyone's that
S0262	yeah but he really be
S0303	but there be people like
S0262	yeah
S0303	and the people like my dad they're
S0262	yeah
S0303	actually mad
S0262	yeah
S0303	and the problem be be that everyone be mad nowadays
S0262	yeah
S0303	it detract from the fact that there be people who be actually
S0262	yeah
S0303	mad in the old fashion way
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	like you would have be lock up into a madhouse
S0303	yeah
S0262	like you know
S0303	yeah so you have
S0303	people like stephen fry
S0262	yeah
S0303	oh one in three people have get mental health problems
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah i don't doubt it but
S0262	mm mm
S0303	there be a spectrum
S0262	mm
S0303	and there be people like and there be people like my dad who be on the end of the spectrum
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	and people who think well everyone's mad if i say oh my dad be mad they go oh yes that's like me i suffer from depression
S0262	yeah
S0303	no no no that's not what i mean
S0262	no no you're not know what i'm talk about
S0303	no
S0262	yeah
S0303	no it's it's it's slightly different
S0262	it's so different and that's what i know so you know and anyway but that's how remember
S0303	but he's not bad
S0262	you know
S0303	he's not
S0262	but that's how he remember the wed and i think well couldn't we have think about
S0303	but it's like fixate on the negative
S0262	something positive
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know the bite where we have fun
S0303	and it's only one guy everyone know he's a plonker everyone know he's a bite weird everyone know he's like a drug casualty
S0262	yeah
S0303	he's not cruel he's not
S0262	no
S0303	evil he's he's
S0262	oh god he's far from it you know i
S0303	i think he's a nice guy he's a plonker
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know
S0262	yeah
S0303	he's like a spoil lump
S0262	yeah
S0303	and a baby
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i think he's nice
S0262	but but yeah harmless
S0303	i don't think he's get a bad bone in his body
S0262	you know
S0303	yeah
S0262	in that respect apart from the fact that he's mad but which doesn't
S0303	yeah
S0262	make him harmless but that's not actually
S0303	but i'm not a pc person
S0262	his intention to harm people
S0303	but i do think you have to step back a bite when the person
S0262	yeah
S0303	be clearly loopy i mean
S0262	yeah
S0303	he's bring it on himself with the drug
S0262	yeah
S0303	in my opinion but
S0262	yeah yeah yeah but that be just my point be that
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know really erm i suppose two point
S0303	and what's the point in
S0262	i be make
S0303	dwell on it
S0262	be that he really want to catch a liar out
S0303	yeah
S0262	and actually show everyone
S0303	it's really interest
S0262	that he be clever enough to actually work that that bite out
S0303	mm
S0262	show my dad i suppose because it really he really hadn't think about how that would impact on on the and myself
S0303	cos the average person wouldn't care
S0262	well the the situation wasn't
S0303	like say if you if you say to me that this be
S0262	call for
S0303	completely hypothetical
S0262	yeah
S0303	let's just say oh you know it's amaze i fly to the moon in a shuttle or something
S0262	yeah
S0303	last week because i win a competition i'd be think to myself i don't think that's really true but i'd go oh it doesn't matter i don't care
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know i'd be like oh okay and try and change the subject
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know just hypothetically
S0262	yeah oh that's lovely but yeah so what about the weather
S0303	no but i wouldn't i wouldn't feel any need to
S0262	yeah
S0303	like
S0262	to exert some sort of
S0303	oh i wouldn't feel that that somehow be some kind of
S0262	pressure or
S0303	assault on my
S0262	yeah
S0303	identity or
S0262	yeah
S0303	mm it doesn't really matter do it
S0262	and actually the thing that happen on that day i wouldn't be surprise if somehow they've really piss well have really piss this guy off that in some kind of way erm there be an influence or a cause and effect where his little streak of you know okay i'm gonna show you really what i'm talk about come out and it come out through well in the situation
S0303	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	where dad and be together
S0303	yeah
S0262	with him
S0303	yeah
S0262	now i be completely oblivious to this because of course i be with my guests and i be have a
S0303	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	great time but then this all become a massive story
S0303	and it become a big thing
S0262	and it be a big thing
S0303	it become a thing
S0262	that be a big negative thing in my view
S0303	yeah
S0262	whereas there be so many great positive aspects of it
S0303	so probably the only two really negative things in any way connect to your wed be the fact that 's brother behave like a plonker and that this guy tell lie
S0262	and actually neither of those things affect me or
S0303	a either of them matter
S0262	yeah exactly
S0303	and b there be probably fifty thousand nice things
S0262	yeah
S0303	that you could have remember
S0262	absolutely so now i be think about it just as you be talk and i be talk i be think because dad doesn't really want me to have my own life and doesn't really want to
S0303	really not
S0262	share me
S0303	doesn't want either of you to have a life
S0262	with
S0303	no exactly
S0262	and yes you're right doesn't probably really want me to have my own life but he's
S0303	no
S0262	go to have well he's be get use to it you know
S0303	i don't think your dad want you or to have your own live
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	and play along and doesn't have his own life
S0262	mm
S0303	and i don't think want you to have your own life either
S0262	mm
S0303	i don't think anyone want you to have your own life
S0262	no i think they want me to be like mum
S0303	yeah
S0262	mm
S0303	yeah but don't do it
S0262	and and no god no and and er and that's the thing
S0303	it get war though i know it's tire
S0262	it it no it's very war and it's almost like wouldn't it be nice if somehow come back to the fold
S0303	don't do it
S0262	and
S0303	cos you escape
S0262	wouldn't it be nice if somehow just sort of clear off
S0303	yes and it's just the three of you
S0262	lock in
S0303	yeah
S0262	mm no well i've
S0303	yeah
S0262	work that one out
S0303	that's why
S0262	since leave
S0303	keep keep a good hold on
S0262	yeah yeah oh god don't worry
S0303	because i know 's not ideal
S0303	because nobody be ideal
S0262	no no of course not
S0303	because you're only human but 's and he's
S0262	yeah but he's a genuine person
S0303	a separate entity
S0262	yeah yeah he's somebody i believe in a lot a great deal yeah
S0303	well he's a nice guy
S0262	yeah and he really believe in me so
S0303	yeah what what more do you want
S0262	yeah i mean we respect each other
S0303	yeah
S0262	a great deal you know erm
S0303	i just think in life you have to have
S0262	yeah
S0303	realistic
S0262	yeah
S0303	hop
S0262	expectations
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah i go i agree with that i think you do and i know marriage a plain sail one and i'm always be tell that by my mum so that be good
S0303	yeah yeah yeah exactly
S0262	so she kind of say forewarn me and say well you know what
S0303	it's just i i think
S0262	plus if you're marry to my father
S0303	thank you so much i think basically it's like
S0262	you know
S0303	it's like it sound so silly but i think it's manners
S0262	mm
S0303	and to feel someone's on your side
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	and everything else
S0262	yeah
S0303	whatever
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know
S0262	yeah i agree
S0303	it's like
S0262	i agree i completely agree with that
S0303	thank you so much
S0262	mm but
S0303	it be a funny old thing
S0262	it's a funny old thing
S0303	but it's interest about that lie thing
S0262	it be really interest about that lie thing
S0303	cos
S0262	i don't know why
S0303	when i say i've never know
S0262	yeah
S0303	it maybe that i have know but i haven't really be aware of it so i'll rephrase it as as far as i'm aware
S0262	yeah
S0303	i've never before meet
S0262	somebody quite like yeah
S0303	a fabricator
S0262	yeah
S0303	i've meet someone who tell lie to get out of trouble
S0262	mm
S0303	oh i be work late
S0262	mm
S0303	when actually they're see someone else
S0262	yeah
S0303	or
S0262	yeah
S0303	you know and those type of lie lie to make your life easier
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	and to get someone
S0262	yeah
S0303	off your back
S0262	yeah
S0303	oh god yeah and probably
S0262	yeah
S0303	as much as the next person i've never meet someone who as far as i know
S0262	yeah
S0303	i've never meet somebody who just
S0262	quite delusional yeah
S0303	yeah and then
S0262	yeah
S0303	become really quite agitate and i swear i swear on someone's
S0262	yeah
S0303	life you know ask
S0262	mm mm
S0303	ask but about really strange things
S0262	mm
S0303	when
S0262	mm it's really of no consequence yeah
S0303	yeah really weird
S0262	yeah
S0303	and it take me age before i realise
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's none of it's true
S0262	yeah yeah it it still concern me a great deal but i suppose
S0303	i suppose it's harmless
S0262	there's really nothing
S0303	but it's a it's a problem isn't it
S0262	like there's nothing
S0303	nothing anyone can do but do your dad know
S0262	get nothing more to say
S0303	do
S0262	i'm sure he's aware of it
S0303	yeah
S0262	mm i'm sure he be
S0303	cos i think i think
S0262	what do you think
S0303	you know i say i be like or i think oh poor you know he must be so stress out
S0262	yeah
S0303	and he's see it's such a come down you know
S0262	mm
S0303	cos you be such an amaze person and everything
S0262	mm
S0303	and i think it must be hard like if you're fight in afghanistan
S0303	to come back and work for a media agency
S0262	i know
S0303	i do think it be true cos i think
S0262	it's like when you're busy save the world
S0303	cos i think
S0262	yeah
S0303	but then i and then
S0262	yeah
S0303	like gradually as the time go by i think
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't think that's actually true
S0262	oh and so you so when and i before you'd meet and we would talk about you know how 's such a fibber and all that sort of thing
S0303	no i didn't really know i didn't really know
S0262	okay
S0303	because 's really
S0262	i just know you have a brother you know
S0303	yeah she's a really good one for that you know that she you know a good one in the sense that erm she you know she and i
S0303	but 's not like
S0262	have
S0303	's so sensible
S0262	she's very sensible
S0303	she's so she's so erm
S0262	yeah but she's get a good grip on
S0303	yes she have yeah cos she's get a good
S0262	a good grip of who he be
S0303	grip on everything she's so sensible like
S0262	yeah
S0303	all the advice
S0262	yeah
S0303	's ever give me
S0262	yeah
S0303	i've never take any of it it's always be good advice
S0262	mm
S0303	and it's always like i think with my own best interest at heart
S0262	yeah
S0303	and it's very rational and it's very i'm just not really like that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	i'd love to be like that
S0262	yeah
S0303	but i'm not i just
S0262	yeah no i'm not at all yeah
S0303	and 's like she's always give me all this
S0262	yeah
S0303	advice about like what to do about like sell the flat and
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	like about the
S0262	yeah
S0303	the will and like she's like
S0262	yeah
S0303	and it's all really good advice but i just can't do it cos it's not me
S0262	yeah that's it that's it
S0303	you know
S0262	and that's absolutely fine as well
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know
S0303	and like most things
S0262	yeah
S0303	and it's just like people
S0262	yeah
S0303	be what they be you can't
S0262	that's like exactly right you can't change
S0303	you can't be someone else
S0262	no
S0303	if i could have choreograph my life from when i be an embryo
S0303	then i would have probably choreograph it to be a bite more like but
S0303	it doesn't work like that you know life mould you in
S0303	do you know what i mean
S0262	this lone little foetus that
S0303	mm
S0262	do choreography well you're go to do this first and
S0303	do you know what mean yeah
S0262	and we'll sit down there later
S0303	but i'm not i'm not sensible
S0262	you move my head that way
S0303	but honestly well you should set aside like half an hour a day to like tidy up and everything and i say yeah i really should
S0262	yeah
S0303	i really should but
S0262	yeah
S0303	have i do that
S0262	but i won't
S0303	or be
S0303	she say okay it's like with the cos i've still get box
S0303	from when i move and i move like four years ago
S0303	i say god know what's in there
S0262	but but they're useful
S0303	can't be bother
S0262	they have a practical use
S0303	and they're out of the way
S0262	they've they've get something in them yeah
S0303	you know
S0262	mm
S0303	you know they're not block my path
S0262	no
S0303	to the kettle or the shower that sort of thing
S0262	yeah so why not
S0303	yeah but it's not as if i think i'm right i think i'm wrong but
S0262	no but
S0303	but i don't think it really matter
S0262	it it doesn't matter yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah i completely agree so it's really interest now that i think that i'm in a juncture with erm you know er quite a difficult one i suppose erm but you know i it in a way it er i just see it as pass part of life's course erm that thankfully i be myself and that i can make my own decisions
S0303	and i think probably be with have enable you to
S0262	yes
S0303	be yourself more
S0262	yeah yeah yeah and there be other things
S0303	because 's
S0262	and there be other
S0303	not the kind of person who's only gonna like you if a and he's
S0262	yes
S0303	gonna like you less if b
S0262	b yeah yeah
S0303	and in a way i can imagine that could be quite annoy in some ways
S0262	mm
S0303	but actually overall it's very very positive
S0262	yeah
S0303	because it give you the space to actually finally
S0262	yeah
S0303	be able to inhabit your own personality
S0262	yes yeah
S0303	which you be never give the opportunity to do before
S0262	true very true
S0303	and that's a huge thing that you can't put a price on
S0262	no god yeah yeah
S0303	and the downside of it be maybe that the person be a little bite passive at time or could be see to be a little bite passive at time
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but the upside be precisely what i've just say you're give that space
S0262	incredible amount of space
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0303	and if you be award a nobel prize or if you be live
S0262	yeah
S0303	homeless in a doorway i don't think
S0262	even it wouldn't matter to him
S0303	's opinion would change
S0262	no
S0303	in the slightest
S0262	no
S0303	as mine wouldn't
S0262	no i think just
S0303	and it's very liberate
S0262	it's just about you know our fulfilment whatever that mean
S0303	yeah
S0262	to the individual
S0303	whatever
S0262	yeah which be why i think well i be go to say
S0303	and who care what other people think i dunno i've get a kind of arrogance i don't care
S0262	yeah
S0303	what people think of me i really don't care
S0262	but now we really don't now
S0303	no
S0262	when i realise when i look at and dad
S0303	yeah
S0262	and i see things a little bite more erm
S0303	objectively maybe or with a bite more perspective
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	step back
S0262	yeah a a step back in erm a realisation or an awareness that there's perhaps an element of jealousy there too
S0303	oh definitely
S0262	mm
S0303	definitely
S0262	mm
S0303	because they're not happy
S0262	mm
S0303	they're not happy
S0262	mm
S0303	cos how can you be happy when you don't relate to anyone
S0262	the only reason why i say that be because i know that
S0303	i totally agree
S0262	we love each other but that's a sort of
S0303	yeah of course
S0262	another thing that's
S0303	of course
S0262	to what love mean
S0303	yeah
S0262	but
S0303	yeah
S0262	in term of respect and sort of erm an easy go manner and an appreciation of each other for for for who they be or for who we be that doesn't really exist at the moment
S0303	no
S0262	and it's quite likely that it won't
S0303	no i agree
S0262	i think we're now at a juncture
S0303	i agree
S0262	where it's like okay
S0303	cos it's not as if you and be twelve and fourteen
S0262	no
S0303	and your dad's forty
S0262	and yeah
S0303	no it's not gonna happen really let's be realistic
S0262	and er and that's what
S0303	it might
S0262	say to me
S0303	but i don't think it be
S0262	she say to me when you break away from your brother try to emulate your brother at about
S0303	yeah
S0262	eight or nineteen i saw a massive change in your
S0303	yeah
S0262	and i actually think great
S0303	mm
S0262	i'm begin to actually find out
S0303	mm mm
S0262	who want to be and who who she be right now
S0303	but 's insightful
S0262	yeah
S0303	isn't she
S0262	very insightful
S0303	even i be really surprise
S0262	yeah
S0303	i don't know if you remember but you know when we be round at her house i can't remember when it be
S0262	yeah
S0303	a couple of months ago and she be say that era with that be just almost the dead years
S0262	yeah
S0303	it be almost she be that's it be the first time i realise that she know that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	cos i just never talk about it cos that be like a bad time
S0262	yeah i know
S0303	for so i don't
S0262	yeah
S0303	if she bring it up i'd be like oh yes okay
S0262	yeah
S0303	but she
S0262	she really cotton onto that
S0303	she's sussed isn't she
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah and i think that's now where i'm at which be the people who really care about me and who i really care about erm you know i place an incredible amount of value on that erm
S0303	friendship
S0262	it yeah
S0303	friendship
S0262	it really be
S0303	cos friendship's get no ulterior motives
S0262	no
S0303	they don't want your money they don't want to canoodle
S0262	no
S0303	with you they don't want
S0262	no
S0303	your approval they don't want
S0262	yeah
S0303	they just like you
S0262	yeah
S0303	for whatever reason
S0262	exactly whatever it be
S0303	yeah
S0262	yeah and i suppose in a way i have become in it's yeah as er more on the mum and gran side of things
S0303	yeah of course
S0262	and that be okay
S0303	that's the way to go
S0262	i think that's okay
S0303	so do i
S0262	you know
S0303	i do as well
S0262	i mean that's absolutely fine and that's why i didn't mind talk to about
S0303	no
S0262	the and even the idea of perhaps
S0303	no
S0262	explore something
S0303	yeah
S0262	other than that
S0303	it's an option
S0262	because it do give me a sense of i'm just one person
S0303	yes
S0262	in
S0303	in a dynamic in a huge dynamic
S0262	in this whole
S0303	that go back
S0262	line of ancestry
S0303	generations before yeah perspective
S0262	really not
S0303	it's perspective
S0262	important this isn't go
S0303	and i don't know if it's
S0262	to be important
S0303	i don't know if it
S0262	you now
S0303	i don't think it's change the subject but i think also i just tend to think as long as i do those basic things if people don't like it then
S0262	yeah stuff them
S0303	it's that
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah but i and another thing there's nothing i can do there's no point
S0262	no there's
S0303	lose any sleep over it be there
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's like you try you try and see the best in people
S0262	yeah
S0303	you try and bring out the best in people
S0262	yes
S0303	you try and be kind to people
S0262	yeah
S0303	my mum always tell me be more tolerant i'm not
S0262	yeah
S0303	naturally tolerant but i've
S0262	yeah
S0303	train myself to be
S0262	to be
S0303	as ostensibly tolerant
S0262	yeah yeah which as a teacher be a good thing yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	it's a necessary thing
S0303	just try to
S0262	yeah
S0303	give people the space
S0262	mm
S0303	to be themselves and if they're not satisfy
S0262	yeah
S0303	then kind of fuck them really
S0262	yeah
S0303	but not in a nasty way not in a confrontational
S0262	no
S0303	way
S0262	oh god no not
S0303	or anything just
S0262	to pull them up on it no
S0303	because life's so short there's no point
S0262	yeah yeah oh there really isn't yeah and that's
S0303	get involve in all this anguish
S0262	and that's what i've decide
S0303	yeah
S0262	be that's how i'm at now
S0303	and i just always feel
S0262	you know
S0303	if you have a million
S0262	wherever
S0303	people like applaud me oh you're so great
S0262	mm
S0303	if you have a million people go you're such a loser
S0262	mm
S0303	i don't actually care i don't care about either
S0262	no
S0303	cos i'm not interest
S0262	yeah
S0303	i'm not
S0262	yeah it doesn't bother you
S0303	no
S0262	yeah
S0303	what their criteria be be a
S0262	yeah
S0303	mystery to me and
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	you can't really live like that
S0262	no
S0303	you just try to have what good manners
S0262	yeah
S0303	try to be kind
S0262	yeah
S0303	try to be cheerful
S0262	exactly
S0303	try not to be a drain on people

S0262	yeah
S0303	tolerant and just
S0262	yeah

S0303	not take things to heart and then
S0262	that's it
S0303	if people don't like it they don't like it there's nothing you can do really
S0262	yeah that's exactly right yeah
S0303	but people agonise over everything

S0303	yeah
S0262	just so exhaust
S0303	it be it be really
S0262	and i've
S0303	exhaust it's such a drain
S0262	forget about yeah
S0303	it's a drain
S0262	yeah and it's an absolute mindset that people you know find themselves in and i guess that's what happen you know be that the you get lock into something and you just don't realise
S0303	mm
S0262	that you've get a choice that you just unlock yourself from that
S0303	yeah
S0262	you know just don't

S0303	that's so true
S0262	yeah
S0303	that's so true
S0262	while you still can
S0303	i'm just gonna say one thing cos i be gonna do
S0262	yeah
S0303	a digression before
S0262	yeah
S0303	about when you be say that your mum and gran have maybe choose to withhold certain information
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	i think i might have mention it before but i think i tell you that i've get these relatives they're my mum's cousins
S0262	right
S0303	and they're do the family tree thing you know
S0262	mm
S0303	you know every family's get one
S0262	mm
S0303	the genealogy
S0262	mm
S0303	or whatever i don't know how to pronounce it
S0262	mm
S0303	and all these things that my granny never tell me
S0262	yeah
S0303	and i kind of feel bad cos i feel i do know these things now
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but she choose not to tell me just like
S0262	right
S0303	for example
S0262	right
S0303	the story i be always bring up with be that she have a husband who die when they be very very young of tuberculosis
S0262	right
S0303	turn out he never die
S0303	they go their separate ways but because it be taboo
S0262	yeah
S0303	to separate
S0262	yeah
S0303	so she just present herself in a new part of the world with her son as a widow
S0262	right
S0303	so
S0262	wonderful
S0303	my mum's parent weren't actually marry because she be already marry but
S0303	i mean just for example
S0262	yeah
S0303	and so her son grow up think oh you know he doesn't have a father but he do have a father
S0262	yeah oh god
S0303	this be a silly thing
S0262	it's just i know
S0303	but just
S0262	yeah
S0303	she didn't tell me because why should she tell me
S0262	yeah
S0303	like you know who know what happen i don't know
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's like oh he die of tb who die of tb when they be in their twenties oh it be sad people die of tb in those days
S0262	yeah it's completely plausible
S0303	it's er
S0262	yeah and that's sort of like that with flora

S0303	exactly
S0262	it's just
S0303	no but that's exactly the
S0262	yeah that's right
S0303	take away quite from this whole
S0303	what be i mean to do with this information
S0262	yeah
S0303	yeah
S0262	for fuck's sake
S0303	it's terrify
S0262	it be it be yeah but you're you're right it's it be it be erm i don't know
S0303	change time
S0262	yeah

S0262	yeah it really be i mean i notice that more and more i mean my dad's cleaner i love her because i say to her do you mind because we have such great chat in the kitchen when she's mean to be clean
S0303	yeah but it's lovely just to have human contact
S0262	yeah and she's get all her worry or whatever
S0303	oh yeah
S0262	and then she doesn't make it out like but it be
S0303	oh no and sometimes it's nice to have
S0262	well i just say to her
S0303	a little insight into other people's woes
S0262	do you mind if we record the conversation and she say
S0303	oh wow

S0303	it's so funny
S0262	be about death families deal with death
S0303	yeah
S0262	it be all about organise the funerals it be about
S0303	well we can move on to death later
S0262	alcoholism
S0262	it and then
S0303	i can do death
S0262	oh god
S0262	you know and it's just and and i
S0303	death's on the
S0262	i i replay it and i think this be somebody who i really don't know very well
S0303	yeah
S0262	and
S0303	and yet she be prepare to divulge
S0262	not only do she want to talk to me
S0303	and disclose
S0262	but she really trust me that you know
S0303	yeah
S0262	this isn't go to harm you
S0303	no
S0262	record this conversation now i believe it isn't
S0303	yeah
S0262	and it's like well you know i i just think to myself wow people when they want to
S0303	yeah
S0262	really engage and interact
S0303	and it's to do with make people feel at their ease
S0303	isn't it
S0262	yeah i think so
S0303	it's state the obviously but
S0262	yeah i think that's really important and i
S0303	yeah
S0262	i sometimes forget that
S0303	but most people don't have that knack
S0262	true yeah
S0303	but i think that because you've be bring up with a certain set of criteria that be suppose to define what be a great person be
S0262	yeah
S0303	and be a success be
S0262	yeah
S0303	it's quite hard to step back from that
S0262	yeah
S0303	and actually think no what really
S0262	yeah
S0303	be the criteria
S0262	or the
S0303	for be a decent person
S0262	yeah that's it yeah yeah that's true that's really true
S0303	and it's a message if people keep
S0262	yeah
S0303	hammer home this narrative
S0262	mm
S0303	it's very very difficult not to absorb that narrative
S0262	mm
S0303	because
S0262	mm
S0303	this have be your life
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but it doesn't mean it's true
S0262	yeah i know
S0303	it's like state the obvious but
S0262	i know it's like but er it really have to i have to leave erm not because it be specifically but
S0303	well things run their course
S0262	it it be just a readiness that i have
S0303	yeah yeah
S0262	to sort of switch
S0303	yeah
S0262	and change and
S0303	yeah
S0262	just off and do something else and just
S0303	well the thing be
S0262	you know
S0303	it's like
S0262	just what i've always do you know
S0303	you could do anything at any time
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	but you shouldn't be put under pressure
S0262	yeah yeah
S0303	in a i mean
S0262	yeah so we're gonna get something to eat then
