S0417	right i've get er i've a groupon voucher erm where i pay twenty five euros i can have four people eat at
S0416	what be
S0417	burger place in in town in city
S0416	in
S0417	mm
S0416	mm that's good
S0417	yeah thing be it might be hard to do it for your birthday like at least people be here in
S0416	yeah i don't think i don't think we could do it for my birthday i think mcdonald's would be more simple
S0417	yeah
S0416	cos at mcdonald's you only really need a euro you can just get a hamburger
S0417	maybe we could use it for like when you know when he's around
S0416	yeah
S0417	er and me you and yeah
S0416	yeah do count do count
S0417	no
S0416	okay so then it could be me you and
S0417	yeah that's for twenty five euros that's not bad be it i mean i'm not quite sure how much you can have from that can't remember erm
S0416	be it like you can get be it like you pay twenty five euro then you can get anything from from like a select list
S0417	no i don't think i don't think erm
S0416	like you can get like goujons and that's all for free if you know what i mean
S0417	right don't do this i'm gonna show you how to cook rice
S0416	okay
S0417	just so that you'll know at one point but not now maybe use the cooker
S0416	okay
S0417	cooker be a bite funny sometimes the gas go on and off and i just i'd rather not especially with be sometimes he's tall enough to reach so for rice
S0416	mm
S0417	erm actually what best way be to get a cup how much for each person i think it's about like maybe about a third or a half half might be too much actually
S0416	that doesn't look like a lot of rice
S0417	i know it's hard to judge cos it do get double the size when it's cook or maybe even more
S0416	do it ah
S0417	you need to get change you've have a shower today
S0416	oh okay yeah
S0417	and have you brush your teeth
S0416	i have
S0417	you sure i can't smell it
S0416	i'm sure i'm sure mum i have
S0417	okay
S0416	can you not hear me cos i'm pretty sure i'm always up at the same time as you
S0417	right now with
S0416	yep
S0417	pour that in pour that in the saucepan
S0416	okay so pour about a third of rice and
S0417	yeah that's probably too much to be honest and then go and fill up
S0416	it might be
S0417	fill up the water
S0416	with the kettle
S0417	no fill up fill up that with cold water
S0416	like to the brim
S0417	to be to be the same amount of the as the rice
S0416	do you mean like a third
S0417	yeah whatever the rice go up to put that up to
S0416	think that's
S0416	oh
S0417	okay er that's as much water you need like as much water as there be rice
S0417	put it on the thing this it and then you put the lid on and you've gotta wait until it it's fifteen minutes from now
S0416	so i will go and i'll time it
S0417	yeah
S0416	so so how do you how do you turn on
S0417	so it's three thirty five but you have to watch it because it boil over really quickly
S0416	how do you turn on the thing cos all you just do be click the
S0417	you put put it in and turn it that put the gas on
S0416	yeah
S0417	and you ignite it
S0416	and then that's that
S0417	yeah so you've gotta like not just leave it without put the ignition on otherwise the gas be erm gas be dangerous without be ignite
S0416	so you've gotta gotta be like this and then you go like this this and then click that
S0417	it er it's the other way i think
S0416	or whatever whatever position it's in
S0417	mm it's this
S0417	with this rice you have to move it cos it's very difficult to once it boil you've get to move it onto a lower temperature
S0416	oh okay
S0417	er
S0416	so how do i do that do i just go like move it back
S0417	well it doesn't really work very well on this oven that's why i don't want you use it yet just to understand how it work first so i put on this one we can have a go put the simmer on do that hold it in and do that
S0416	oh
S0417	right
S0416	do you want me to lower it do i just do this again
S0417	don't do no that's off now put it on again to lower it you go that way
S0416	this this way
S0417	yeah it's get a small
S0416	oh yeah so that's really low
S0417	mm
S0416	and that's high
S0417	yeah turn it on again turn it off and turn it on again
S0416	oh okay
S0417	turn it off again so what i have to do be when that boil cos er otherwise it make a great big mess as well
S0416	mm
S0417	and rice can burn quite easily so there's not much rice in there it might actually take less than fifteen minutes then i've put it on to that on a low simmer not a high one
S0416	so can you only tell by do a clock from like fifteen to zero or can you tell by like certain like noise so if i didn't have a timer could i tell when it be ready
S0417	that's the thing you have to move it half like part way you have to just keep an eye on it while it's boil and it's start to boil now it's start to boil so now put that on
S0416	
S0417	yeah move that across put it on low
S0416	yeah
S0417	mm
S0416	how low
S0417	that's fine
S0416	okay
S0417	right right to right to then move that to that one must always keep the handle that way if you put it that way can come and tip it on his head and that's on so we turn that off
S0416	oh which way this way
S0417	that way yeah
S0416	okay
S0417	you didn't turn that all the way
S0416	what do you mean
S0417	you didn't turn it all the way that way
S0416	oh
S0417	you didn't turn it all the way down
S0416	oh be that
S0417	it's very very it's very little
S0416	be that piece break
S0417	yeah that's why that's why it's very hard to use
S0416	oh
S0417	it's er quite easy to i never use the grill
S0416	i think that be i think that way the
S0417	yeah erm but you time it from the whole time so
S0416	be that fifteen minutes
S0417	no you time the whole thing it's still
S0416	oh
S0417	it's not fifteen minutes until it boil
S0416	okay
S0417	and this be call simmer
S0416	simmer
S0417	simmer be when it's bubble like this and the water's boil
S0416	shall i use two hand when put it to a different one
S0417	it's always best to use like a more like to keep steady depend how confident you be if you're maybe at first use two hand and always keep the but it's important to always keep the handle that way because this way be really dangerous
S0416	yeah
S0417	could just he'd be in hospital
S0416	mm
S0417	you know like that kid at school that have burn or something do you or be that from a firework
S0416	that's from a firework that be from a firework his name be
S0417	god poor thing
S0417	that's so sad it be from a firework
S0416	yeah it wasn't
S0417	just one moment you know
S0416	it wasn't so bad it be just like he have like a bite that's stitch up there he's fine now
S0417	oh right oh be he
S0416	fine yeah of course
S0417	well er what's who's the person who's get the really kind of quite
S0416	oh the i'm pretty sure that's he be just bear with that
S0417	oh okay
S0416	yeah i don't really know cos i didn't really wanna ask him about it cos obviously that's a bite rude
S0417	yeah not until you know somebody
S0417	sometimes if you know somebody then it's okay to ask
S0416	yeah i do know him but he's he's a bite shy
S0417	yeah he be quite shy actually isn't he
S0416	mm when he's on xbox he's not shy
S0417	no
S0416	no
S0417	that's the trouble i think i worry a bite about people like him cos you're if he only feel like not unconfident on the xbox he he might just get into game and never talk to people in real life anyway this immortality thing
S0416	mm
S0417	so these jellyfish they can just keep go and go i mean i don't know if it's
S0416	so but if someone stab it all the time
S0417	i suppose so yes yeah yeah
S0416	cos jellyfish don't really have like mouth or anything so when when jellyfish be beach do they die
S0417	erm i don't know
S0416	because er when i when erm cos i be on a beach once erm and there's there be like it be weird because it be like there be the main beach here then there be like a rock
S0417	yeah
S0416	then there be like a beach there but when the tide go in that wasn't a beach so you have to like go around it you have to go in like kind of half the sea but you be just it be just like up here
S0417	mm
S0416	so you go onto the beach and it'll be like this and
S0417	mm
S0416	it's really cool erm but there be jellyfish on it and they look like just little piece of jelly seafood jelly on the floor
S0417	yeah
S0416	and be they dead cos i really i be watch once i step on one
S0417	yeah you've gotta be careful cos they could sting you as well
S0416	well those ones weren't stingy but i'm sure there be lot that can sting you like boxer jellyfish
S0417	yeah bluebottles
S0416	yeah bluebottles and boxer jellyfish
S0417	box not boxer box jellyfish
S0416	oh i be think of dog
S0417	they're in australia
S0416	yeah
S0417	i mean you can't you can't swim in the sea in the summer because be it summer or be it winter i think it's the summer you can't
S0416	i'm pretty sure it's summer yeah cos
S0417	because of the box jellyfish cos they can kill you and you can't really see them they're quite big they're quite transparent so you can't
S0416	how how big like as big as me
S0417	er no i i think they're i'm not sure they're as big as you but maybe as big as your leg maybe
S0416	so like by bigness cos i don't know if all jellyfish be like this but they're like look all pancake blob and then they have some of them have like little seaweed things come down from there be i right yeah
S0417	yeah
S0416	yeah erm
S0416	er so do boxer jellyfish have those stingy things
S0417	yeah
S0416	they're the thing that sting you
S0417	i think so yeah so want to cook this
S0416	yeah
S0416	i put it on for four point
S0417	four minutes right i'm just gonna pierce the top okay what's the date today
S0416	erm seventeenth the seventh
S0417	use today just on the sell by date still have to look at that as well
S0416	oh
S0417	you know how to look at that
S0416	if it's the eighth be it still bad
S0417	erm well i wouldn't do chicken or pork or anything like that meat be one of the things you've get to worry about
S0416	cos i'm not sure it's
S0417	and fish that can
S0416	i'm not sure it's
S0417	do you understand
S0416	what's the
S0417	yeah you can yeah mm that's okay but generally i wouldn't erm do you understand these
S0416	mm
S0417	your energy
S0416	mm calories and things
S0417	do you know how many calories you need a day
S0416	two thousand for an average person
S0417	really i think it be like i think it be less
S0416	i'm pretty sure it's two thousand or it's twelve hundred
S0417	how how how much be these
S0416	fourteen percent wait the fourteen percent or the calories
S0417	the calories
S0416	two hundred and eighty four
S0417	i expect that mean fourteen percent of what you need in a day
S0416	be it fourteen percent or be it fourteen percent of chicken tikka masala be that much calories
S0417	no this be the whole thing will be fourteen percent of your daily intake and it's that's k cal it's two hundred and eighty four calories and that's the fat
S0416	yeah
S0417	
S0416	so fourteen point eight grams
S0417	suppose it's just hard to think well be that okay be that too much and that's so that's really handy
S0416	oh
S0417	twenty twenty one percent of what you need all day
S0416	so that's what that mean i think it be just like twenty one percent of this have that much fat
S0417	no
S0416	i be think why would i want twenty one percent
S0417	do you know what saturate be
S0416	erm no but it do ring a bell that name
S0417	it's type of fat butter
S0416	oh
S0417	be for example be a saturate fat
S0416	well there's not much sugar
S0417	eight percent oh that's actually still quite high for something that's not sugary it's like a chicken tikka masala
S0416	how much be an apple do you think
S0417	an apple
S0416	cos apples be actually quite sugary well fruit be
S0417	mm i don't know
S0416	fruit be very sugary
S0417	what's so interest be there look at the salt
S0416	that's a lot of salt
S0417	twenty eight percent if you have this and load of
S0416	well i guess this be this be kind of a lunch or dinner meal so
S0417	yeah i know but it's interest isn't it quite a lot
S0417	yeah
S0416	like that's what the percentage mean
S0417	and that's where you can see there that the chicken breast so where where would where would the saturate fat would be
S0416	onions
S0417	that would be the unsalted butter
S0416	mm
S0417	don't let it put you off onions it just mean you're not gonna eat it now be you cos it's get onions single cream
S0416	no of course i'm gonna eat it
S0417	look at all the nice spice though cumin coriander lemon paprika turmeric
S0416	mm i don't see any of those i recognise
S0417	don't you recognise i mean these be the kind of the main curry spice you should know about this if you like curry
S0416	i love curry can we buy these spice
S0417	cardamom ginny ginger fennel
S0416	i'd put them in
S0417	yeah i mean er sometimes i do one day me and you could cook up a curry from scratch if you like with you have to get the all the spice and put them on a like a fry pan
S0417	or a wok and first to bring out the flavour that's what my brother say and he's a he's a chef and then he say the best way be to bring out the flavour and crush them all up and then put them in the chicken to marinade for a day before you use it
S0416	the only thing i'm scar about be i'm very very very picky with sauce some sauce i hate some sauce i adore like chicken tikka masala
S0417	yeah
S0416	so how can i like
S0417	right let's see if they're i think the rice should just be about ready
S0416	yeah it look ready
S0417	so we turn if you turn it off if you take your thing out of the microwave to cool down you can just take it out with your hand i think it'll be alright just grab it just and what i do with the rice
S0417	yeah okay but what i do with the rice just it's good to just leave it on the pan
S0417	do you know why cos it can be quite soggy rice
S0416	oh yeah
S0417	but if you leave it there see all the steam rise up with the lid off it's just dry all the rice flake
S0416	that's yeah yeah yeah that's cool
S0417	it's already be do like that
S0416	be it
S0417	yeah you don't you don't need to do it now you just take off the top now you stab it before it go in
