S0276	that's fuck weird that's fuck weird that's fuck weird that's fuck weird
S0275	i know like he go crazy okay let's let's look at this right basically at the begin there's this man i don't remember what his name be
S0276	man
S0275	his surname i know what his surname be mr earnshaw that's it mr earnshaw go to somewhere find this little black boy call heathcliff bring him back raise him with his two kid hindley and catherine heathcliff fall in love with catherine
S0276	but aren't they little kid
S0275	yeah but when they grow up when they grow up they fall in love with each other they're like well tight
S0275	he erm hindley's very jealous of heathcliff because the dad like heathcliff better than hindley so then the dad send heathcliff erm hindley away to college so then now everyone's all bliss then thingy die the dad die and then hindley get the wuthering heights mansion so when he come back he make erm heathcliff the worker field worker what not and then erm what's her name catherine fall in love with their neighbour who
S0276	wait what happen to heathcliff now
S0275	heathcliff be the worker now mate he's
S0276	doesn't she see him
S0275	go bottom he's at the bottom now she's all about social
S0275	whatnots yeah so she forget about him she start hang out with be it no not lockwood someone
S0275	i forget what his name be
S0276	some bloke
S0275	this guy but his surname be important because they're gonna come up again anyway let's call him let's call him erm thrushcross
S0275	because that's what that's what his mansion's call okay so she fall in love with him be this what happen yeah yeah then they have a kid they call her catherine the first catherine die and then heathcliff go crazy he's like no no no no then heathcliff whilst catherine's still alive actually heathcliff marry heathcliff marry catherine's husband's sister right i don't know what let's call let's say erm heathcliff marry thrushcross's sister
S0276	why why
S0275	because he want to take control over thrushcross grange right so if he have a kid by her if he's marry into the family he will get control of this place yeah
S0276	but ain't that weird like see like the girl you love with your brother in law
S0275	it's very odd it's just
S0276	but when they see each other all the time
S0275	yeah
S0276	unless they have like secret hanky panky
S0275	they're four four miles away from each other
S0276	do they have secret hanky panky
S0275	no they're not she don't love him no more
S0276	bitch
S0275	i know and then right let me think oh heathcliff be mean to his wife she leave him take go to london she have a baby i don't remember what the baby's name be his name's irrelevant let me see if i put his name down nope i just say son
S0275	but anyways so she marry he's she's go he's back in the place by himself oh the the hindley the brother catherine's brother die so heathcliff get control over wuthering heights and now he's get wuthering heights he's like yeah he's and then he's like okay now i need to get the other place now catherine be dead the her husband be very sick i think what happen with the son no the daughter oh then his son come back cos his cos the wife die his son come back to wuthering heights first time he's meet his dad the son's very ill like he's always sick so and and heathcliff doesn't like him so he treat him badly he make his son marry catherine's daughter right
S0276	okay
S0275	and then he make catherine and the son stay at wuthering heights like they're prisoners there but i mean they can roam the house but they're like trap basically erm also he's get hindley's son when hindley die heathcliff get erm he assume what do you call it assume custody of
S0276	oh
S0275	hindley's son so now he's make hindley's son become the field worker and he's uneducated so so hindley's son don't like it oh hindley's son be call carten heratin hareton
S0276	man this be complicate
S0275	i know that's what i say it's mess up isn't it right so so he's now the worker he's get his son and his daughter in law trap he and then what happen oh then his son die
S0275	catherine's both i think both erm catherine's dad die too so now heathcliff's get control of wuthering heights and thrushgrange erm
S0276	that place
S0275	mansion he's get mansions yeah and he's be like yeah this be it i think like he's perhaps
S0275	but then oh then he start go crazy because catherine oh i remember hindley die because he be an alcoholic erm he start get haunt by the ghost of catherine and he like go crazy and then one day he just walk out into the what do you call it a marsh he just walk out into the marsh and die
S0276	oh i've be to a marsh i fell down a hole
S0275	oh jesus
S0276	it's really quite scary
