S0619	but that stuff last night be actually hummus
S0618	i know it be yeah
S0618	well as we understand it
S0619	as we understand it
S0618	as oppose to as polish people understand it
S0619	which mean that i don't have to start make it and which mean that i don't have to buy a blendy thing
S0618	yeah
S0619	in order to make hummus cos i don't think it would work for the stick blender
S0618	no and more importantly it mean you don't have to clean

S0619	oh look a ski slope be it oh a
S0618	it be yeah

S0619	ah
S0618	might be a bite freaky for people i'm just wonder if i can pull over somewhere and just i don't know get out and look at it without crash the van
S0619	yeah the answer to that be probably no
S0618	it be beautiful but no we're come down the hill now so we're probably gonna lose them in a bite
S0619	mm
S0618	but on the plus side we're on the road with buzzards

S0619	you know that this be the right path er and not a er
S0618	not a blind alley
S0619	not a blind no not a blind alley but erm

S0619	it be
S0618	er and it be more
S0619	no be
S0618	expensive than
S0619	be i think thirty

S0618	no
S0619	i think it be thirty
S0618	mm okay
S0619	erm and in it be thirty
S0618	mm
S0619	thirty and a bite
S0618	yeah

S0619	how much be erm how much be the the ski pass
S0618	ski pass er it be four hours for seventy
S0619	oh

S0619	well yeah you know that's what i be say the other day about buy that bottle of gin for

S0618	good
S0619	for the next er few days
S0618	yeah
S0619	i might go into hermit mode

S0618	fair enough
S0619	yeah
S0618	so i won't stalk you too much
S0619	no
S0618	be respectful of my you as my friend but if you wanna grab a coffee or

S0619	mm
S0618	and then if you do just get in touch and if you don't don't bother

S0618	yeah i just like to get out at least once a day and get a walk
S0619	mm
S0618	and get some air and i think for me it's all the more important when the weather's shit or
S0619	oh yeah absolutely
S0618	when it's like
S0619	if you erm
S0618	minus fifteen and you don't wanna go anywhere
S0619	i mean i'm all for hibernate but if you're hibernate for days on end it's really bad for you
S0618	yeah i think
S0619	even if you've just gotta really drag yourself to go to tesco to buy a loaf of bread
S0618	mm
S0619	you've gotta do it
S0618	yeah
S0619	and when i live in i do i do it because i have to go to the gym every day because that's just what that be what i do to stay sane
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	erm but i know it's really easy to not to not do it
S0618	yeah
S0619	at the same time and i think that's what for example do
S0618	mm
S0619	just doesn't go out but we're suppose to see him on saturday
S0618	oh yeah oh now do i say saturday i'm off to see in
S0619	yeah so sunday let's say

S0619	mm
S0618	an alarm reminder on my phone and
S0619	yeah
S0618	i be talk with a hippie friend about this it do seem that when you practise live in your now moment your memory turn to shit you kind of forget
S0619	uhu
S0618	what somebody tell you in some other now moment which be no excuse at all but i think if i
S0618	don't set oh my god beautiful mountains if i don't oh that's a bus stop so i won't stop there jeez that's stun
S0619	mm
S0618	oh
S0619	that's really beautiful isn't it

S0619	yeah i know yesterday
S0618	it be snowy and sleety when we be on our way here try not to run the man over there we be wow that be beautiful you get a much better idea from here what the mountains look like
S0619	mm yeah the scale of it's huge
S0618	immense isn't it
S0619	yeah nice
S0618	wow yeah
S0619	god it's nice
S0618	woah look at that bus
S0619	so clear so this be be it yes
S0618	what do mean
S0619	don't know
S0618	yeah
S0618	it sound a bite northern irish
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah and er i don't know what be gonna be do for the next few days but i imagine it will be horizontal
S0618	yeah
S0619	not to paint a negative picture of him i don't mean to
S0618	if you perceive horizontal to be a negative state of be
S0619	no i don't no i don't mean horizontal i just mean he's er inactive
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	yeah and if he's hoover i will
S0618	it'll be a miracle
S0619	it i will
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know what i will do i don't know
S0618	i kinda get the maybe i'm be unfair i don't know but he's almost like the child that never grow up i wonder if maybe his mum have sort of fetch and carry and do for him
S0619	i think so
S0618	and
S0619	yeah
S0618	he doesn't really think about do anything himself because he never have i dunno
S0619	mm i think there's lot of truth in that he's a he's sort of very interest he's he's i don't yeah oh i can't speak i can't say any word today
S0619	erm i agree in some ways and there's some sort of characteristics that he have you know you know when erm you're talk to someone and erm they're just not listen
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and they go oh really oh uhu and we all do it
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's human nature that you've get your own mind whir and whir
S0618	you're phase out at something yeah
S0619	erm but it's you know or i don't know whether he doesn't get excite about stuff oh how be he be like oh it be alright
S0619	i be like oh my god why
S0618	ah whereas you could imagine you'd be peel her off the ceiling
S0619	yeah exactly erm and maybe people have different ways of articulate or whether people erm
S0618	oops just jump a red light excuse me ah whoop
S0619	just fall over
S0619	erm people have different ways of articulate or people be what things aren't i don't know what would er what it would take to get him excite
S0619	i just don't know what could've happen in to make him come home and be like oh my god it be sick
S0618	oh
S0619	er whereas i take once up the mountain
S0618	oh yes
S0619	and he rave about it like it be the best thing
S0618	yeah
S0619	he'd ever do i be like we'd literally just walk up a hill
S0619	er and wouldn't even walk up the hill
S0618	no
S0619	cos he'd be like oh it's just a hill
S0619	so
S0618	that's funny
S0619	yeah so how people interpret things or at least talk about it afterwards be
S0618	yeah all very different yeah
S0619	really different yeah
S0618	i can really imagine that with
S0619	he just fuck love that hill he would go like every day on his own
S0618	i know yeah
S0619	and when load of people come over
S0619	he just go on his own
S0618	yeah
S0619	we be like no we don't wanna walk up that hill we're gonna go and have a coffee yeah just that kind of guy
S0618	he be
S0619	but i'm gonna start go for more walk like that erm when it do get a bite nicer
S0618	yeah i recommend it
S0619	yeah
S0618	another thing be get on the bus for twenty minutes and then work out where you be and walk home
S0619	walk home yeah
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	i've get a vague idea i think the you know the bus be pretty good you know
S0619	mm
S0618	be fairly sort of between you and
S0619	mm
S0618	and there be load of bus with that on the front erm what else be there or however you pronounce it the new hospital
S0619	uhu
S0618	that's sort of up the same way but a bite further
S0619	mm
S0618	nearer towards the entrance for the motorway erm yeah you can get a vague idea from the front of the bus the likely direction that it's gonna take
S0619	mm
S0618	and i quite enjoy that and i do that the other day and i get the bus into town and i just get off at a different stop and walk some roads that i've never walk before
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	yep so i'm just gonna try try and do that
S0618	don't try do
S0619	do well yeah exactly
S0618	yeah
S0619	so i'm do load of cardio in the gym but i just think why i'm just sort of you know climb my stairs to nowhere or
S0618	mm
S0619	you know i don't go on the treadmills but you know cycle and i just could be do that outside
S0618	yeah i don't think
S0619	but not yet
S0618	inside be gonna be so good
S0619	yeah exactly
S0618	you can't beat fresh air even if it be big minus number obviously if it's big minus number you need to
S0619	yeah
S0618	protect your chest and be careful but yeah
S0619	and i can't run outside when it's icy or there's any possible chance of fall over
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know how people do it i just don't know
S0618	i really don't who be there be somebody talk the other day say i'm gonna go for a run be that and that be like the day where we could hardly walk from where we be stay to where er be it be so bloody icy
S0619	uhu yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	have trouble stand like be vertical and then she be go for a run
S0619	yeah just
S0618	mental
S0619	people have tell me that they prefer run in snow and ice and i don't know whether it's sort of because you're run on snow it's more sort of pad or er i don't know or whether
S0618	yeah snow i can understand
S0619	it make you concentrate more because you've gotta be careful i dunno
S0618	no that's gonna be even worse because you'd be tense the muscle so
S0619	yeah
S0618	you won't be respond quickly enough
S0619	i just don't know
S0618	yeah i think that with erm i use to go to the a lot in northern ireland these little mountains they only go up to about eight hundred metres a little bite more and you'd get load of erm what do they call them fell runners don't they these
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	these guy that wear the
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	the finger shoe
S0619	yeah and the tiny short and thin legs
S0618	erm and yeah tiny short and skinny legs
S0619	wirey
S0618	and er you know i'm kind of navigate my way up a north face that's a little bite slippery and they're in their wafer thin
S0619	mm
S0618	barefoot run finger sock things do like ten miles an hour or something
S0619	like gazelles yeah
S0618	they be leap like gay gazelles so yeah i don't know how they manage that and you know i can nearly turn an ankle slip on a rock or slip on a bite of ice
S0619	i know
S0618	and they're just i dunno and you see them as they run
S0618	and watch them and watch you know the placement of their feet
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	and think how do you know that rock isn't loose
S0619	yeah
S0618	how do you know
S0619	i think practice when i use to ride er bike a lot
S0618	mm
S0619	er and i be you can just sort of read read the land
S0618	yeah i mean i know i i do get that instinct when i walk in the mountains a lot
S0619	mm
S0618	of which rock be definitely wobbly but you can never know with a hundred percent certainty that
S0619	yeah
S0618	you're not gonna like wobble off fall off
S0619	mm
S0618	so yeah oh look
S0618	sound like it's something b o i think be what they normally call organic
S0619	organic somethings
S0618	regeneration of something or other
S0619	oh
S0618	oh look look at the mountains look at the mountains
S0619	oh it's nice wow

S0618	it's the worst if it's non organic
S0619	uhu erm

S0619	mm erm
S0618	yeah

S0618	that's a completely
S0619	what's necessary
S0618	personal issue
S0619	uhu and i think the best way be this japanese woman who say er do it spark joy er but if you say
S0618	yeah
S0619	to a potato peeler do you spark joy i'd be like no
S0618	mine do because
S0619	potato peeler to peel potatoes
S0618	my potato peeler's shape like a little man
S0619	oh that's nice
S0618	it's brilliant
S0619	yeah

S0618	well there we be jolly good navigate erm yeah and i i do have a pizza cutter which be also shape like a man but a green man
S0619	mm
S0618	erm and he's sort of uphold arm be clasp the pizza cutter
S0619	oh nice
S0618	it be quality but i do get rid of that when i leave northern ireland because i didn't eat pizza
S0619	mm
S0618	so yeah i dunno it's quite yeah i i think i'm incredibly good at it i've always be quite ruthless and say
S0619	mm
S0618	if i haven't touch it in a year it's go i don't need it i've never understand the concept of for example underbed storage
S0619	mm
S0618	to store things under your bed you have too much shit erm or i have too much shit cos again it's a personal thing but yeah move a three bed house into a camper van that be a real challenge and it be most definitely connect with let go on an emotional level
S0619	mm
S0618	and i think the box that i'm do now these two metal containers i've do one of them and i basically wanna turn two metal box into one
S0619	uhu
S0618	erm and they're just like little box with a little carry handle i think they're design for file storage originally
S0619	mm
S0618	what the fuck be you do on my side of the road thank you erm yeah so i nearly get it down to one and it it be it's photos letter card from you know people who be dead as well
S0619	mm mm
S0618	there's another car on my side of the road this one's just come right at me i think i'm just gonna have to brake now
S0619	jesus
S0618	fuck's sake asshole yes
S0619	that do you see that woman then she be clasp her chest like she be gonna die
S0619	in the passenger seat
S0618	maybe she's have a heart attack and he's take her to hospital
S0619	i think she be just frighten
S0618	she probably be yeah be you a bite chilly mind a bite of heat
S0619	no whatever
S0618	i'll pop a bite on if you get too hot just say erm let's pop that round there that on there and down again
S0618	and mind the bend in the road yeah
S0618	yeah so
S0619	it's a nice blue sky
S0618	now what i'm intend to do be i have a camper van full of stuff for the journey from northern ireland to poland erm and now i'm take pretty much all of it back nearly all of it back what i don't get rid of now and store at my uncle's house
S0619	mm
S0618	not that i've ask him still but i will in february and then when i return i want just enough stuff to live in the camper van
S0619	mm
S0618	so i know from have live in it for like a month tour ireland for example i've you know get a good idea of kitchen utensils and
S0619	mm
S0618	things like that
S0619	so will you be live in your house in april
S0618	no i've get a tenant in er with oh what you mean with the hippies oh in
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh god sorry
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	i be just all these cars drive on my side of the road
S0619	i know it's frighten isn't it
S0618	it's kind of a little bite off put but anyway that one pull in a bite more efficiently than the last two
S0619	yeah so er
S0618	erm yes i'll be come back at some point during april so i tell i'll keep the house until the end of april
S0619	mm
S0618	and then after that i'll be disappear
S0619	but the house will be empty in february more or less
S0618	yeah do you wanna move in to it
S0619	no
S0618	oh
S0619	no not at all i er be just sort of curious
S0618	erm no i'll be move end of february
S0619	everything everything
S0618	everything everything apart from erm what i need to live in the camper van
S0619	mm
S0618	to be a farmer so yeah some wellies and stuff
S0618	yeah so yeah that's my current clear the platter challenge
S0619	mm
S0618	erm and it really be down to the emotional stuff now i think i'm probably gonna keep erm a lot of that but then i look at like you know congratulations on your wed card and i'll maybe keep one or two of those but
S0619	yeah it be really difficult with things like that uhu
S0618	you don't need fifty or whatever erm yeah
S0619	i've get you know valentine's card that i get when i be fifteen
S0618	oh jesus
S0619	or fourteen but you know they be nice and you know some poor boy have go to the trouble of write a poem
S0618	ah
S0619	and i just think i can't throw that away at some point in my life somebody like me enough to write a poem about me put it in a card and post it to my house and you know
S0618	that's very sweet
S0619	i don't think that's gonna happen in the future so i might as well keep the card
S0618	course it will
S0619	no so you know
S0618	ah
S0619	things like that and it seem a bite stupid to keep something that's so from when you're so young but
S0618	mm
S0619	fuck it i'm keep it
S0618	fair enough
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	just things like that
S0618	so if that's like if you're consider an a clear out like i say from my experience have be that clear stuff be like clear emotionally so what
S0619	uhu
S0618	emotion if you want to phrase it in those term be that that you're keep hold of
S0619	er i don't know
S0618	be it perhaps you know the sentiment or love that another human be have for you
S0619	sentiment love yeah sort of not nostalgia for happier time cos that's bullshit but erm i don't know
S0618	mm
S0619	there's er you know i've get
S0619	i have these box i think i've get two box as well and i go through them maybe every year or every two years and each time i go through them i get rid of
S0618	yeah
S0619	more stuff so i think as i'm get older
S0618	be you add in the meantime
S0619	erm not add so much because of i guess because of technology
S0618	i be just think that yeah
S0619	there be less stuff like that around
S0618	yeah
S0619	people write to me my friend write to me he give me for christmas like a five page letter write on a typewriter
S0618	ah
S0619	and that'll go in the box er but you know stuff and it's not necessarily er all this stuff i'll bin
S0618	yeah
S0619	er it's just you know your mm maybe not your value change but er the things that be important change
S0618	mm
S0619	and er
S0618	yeah
S0619	do i really need to hold onto this er whatever it be
S0618	yeah
S0619	so

S0619	uhu
S0618	i know
S0619	what sort of what just like a sense
S0618	i dunno just yeah and complete instinct and i just know look at them i wasn't gonna pick them up
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah and be in the van i get quite a lot of that
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	and i i do tend to pick up quite a lot but i dunno couldn't tell you why but instinct say no so no it be
S0619	have you ever hitchhike
S0618	yeah only little bits
S0619	uhu
S0618	like when i've be stay in a hostel and wanna get into town
S0619	uhu
S0618	and do some shop and get back again that sort of thing
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah but not seriously go from place to place
S0619	yeah
S0618	i meet a lot of serious hitchhikers travel new zealand
S0619	mm
S0618	erm
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you know there it be just expect and it be kind of nice for for the hitchhikers as well because you all end up do the hostel scene you end up sort of bump into cos new zealand's
S0619	yeah
S0618	so small you bump into people like a month later in a different place it's like oh i remember you erm yeah and you tend to end up on erm like the bus rout and i start avoid the bus rout cos you tend to get younger people in hostels
S0619	uhu
S0618	that get piss and stay up late and i have a rental car for a lot of that trip and
S0619	yeah
S0618	so consciously choose to get off the beat track and that's where i tend to find different sort of hitchhikers
S0619	uhu
S0618	who like me want to get off
S0619	more season yeah
S0618	yeah want to get off the beat track lot of women travel on their own in new zealand
S0619	uhu
S0618	perfectly safe country to do that in erm so yeah i give lift to lot of single women also couple group of men you know just
S0619	uhu
S0618	again on instinct and vibes man
S0619	mm yeah my friends hitchhike i think they hitchhike around france or from france around italy something like this
S0618	look at this
S0619	they go on quite a long journey oh goodness me
S0618	that's so cool
S0619	erm and yeah and they say it be all fairly safe and blah blah blah and you know and people be so generous sort of say oh well you know you a lift and then do you want come to mine for tea
S0618	yeah
S0619	i can put you up for the night and
S0618	yeah the world be like that
S0619	mm
S0618	and you hear all these fearful tales of axe murderers and you get all these hollywood movies
S0619	yeah but no one say it you know
S0618	that portray the worst of humanity but
S0619	it's like er review on amazon no one really write about how good stuff be
S0618	mm
S0619	they just tend to write about the bad stuff or you know book review or whatever so our little cabin up the hill i think be around this corner somewhere
S0618	i think you might be right
S0619	i don't think it's too far along cos i remember that nightclub
S0618	yeah i i just notice the silhouette of the stripper woman
S0619	yeah
S0618	i just think momentarily
S0619	i say that and i say nightclub i mean strip club
S0618	what on earth be that yeah what on earth be that silhouette of and i realise it be a woman on her knees with her head fling backwards
S0619	mm
S0618	i wonder for a moment have she be decapitate
S0618	or something her head seem to be at an unnaturally unnatural angle but anyway yeah
S0619	yes
S0618	i don't know
S0619	yes oh it's beautiful around here ain't it
S0618	and i'm go to be live here hooray
S0619	ah good for you
S0618	yeah i might also like to do a little bite of volunteer around and around that area
S0619	yeah
S0618	maybe you know spend a month work the b and bs and guest house or something
S0619	mm
S0618	learn a few more of the walk rout up here
S0619	yes
S0618	be good
S0619	yeah it's really really nice
S0618	this car i think this car behind want to overtake might be out of luck for the next hour
S0618	oh no there you go pal if you're quick
S0619	go on fast
S0618	no fair enough he's get a number plate say no more
S0619	piss
S0618	yeah
S0618	probably oh speed camera seventy that's handy that they tell you ah but i'm not be fool cos that sign with the silhouette be fifty so i'm gonna do fifty and if it's seventy it's seventy but i'm gonna presume it's fifty aha there we be yeah there's a speed camera on the road near me and they've tap it up with black bin bag and like
S0619	oh right
S0618	i wonder if it be just too cold for the speed cameras to work which
S0618	yeah
S0619	i don't know what the reason be
S0618	but somebody else say they don't bother change the film in poland they're just like for decoration they don't actually do anything
S0619	ah right okay
S0618	so i dunno i do get flash when i be drive here i get really lose and frustrate and piss off er take the wrong road in germany cos erm because i use free online satnavs that you can use offline
S0619	yeah
S0618	when you're go between germany and poland you need to change app
S0619	uhu
S0618	it doesn't you don't get a smooth transition so you need to try and work out on one app the road where it end and work out on the other app the road where it begin
S0619	mm
S0618	and anyway i fuck it up so on the border somewhere near germany i get flash and i wonder if they just let me off because i dunno if i be sort of half look at the map or not really with it
S0619	mm
S0618	but the look of shock and surprise
S0619	yeah
S0618	on my face
S0619	and
S0618	could've win competitions i'm sure
S0619	and where would they send it to
S0618	well exactly they'd send it back to i suppose oh so you know that's probably why they let off the foreigners
S0619	uhu
S0618	i don't know
S0619	so this be we be in load of traffic
S0618	yeah and have you turn leave there you'd be head to my hippies
S0619	mm
S0618	and on a beautiful road that give you great view of these other mountains right warm enough now
S0619	so do quite well
S0618	yeah
S0619	budapest on that bus
S0618	yes yeah somebody else say as well if you want to go to kiev get on the bus and then you don't have the passport border problems
S0619	oh do you not
S0618	no none at all whereas if you drive you can die of starvation
S0619	uhu yeah in the line
S0618	and with an explode bladder wait for the queue
S0619	uhu and on the train i think you can go on a train to kiev erm
S0618	oh cool i'd like to do that
S0619	it's just past
S0618	mm
S0619	or another place i figure it would be
S0618	like it
S0619	yep which isn't too far people er people go for booze i think they just go on booze run
S0618	oh yeah
S0619	across the border and back yeah it's like how much cheaper do you want it
S0618	i know
S0618	i know
S0619	you just go to ukraine and they give you free alcohol
S0618	yeah yeah the other advice i have be if you do want to do that then book your bus online a month in advance
S0619	mm
S0618	and presumably the same go for train and it's
S0619	yeah
S0618	mega cheap you can like get a return ticket for a tenner or something stupid
S0619	yeah well i look at erm the bus to and it be sixty two
S0618	be that a tenner
S0619	one way i think and then
S0618	yeah
S0619	someone else say oh they've they'd see it for thirty five
S0618	wow
S0619	so
S0618	that's amaze
S0619	yeah
S0618	be that a fiver yeah cool
S0619	but the think of go on a bus for so long just make me feel quite ill
S0618	mm

S0619	i don't know
S0618	that's why you wanna travel with me i be that organise person

S0619	mm mm
S0618	as well so yeah
S0619	you know i just don't eat a lot of sandwich i eat like you know egg on toast
S0618	mm
S0619	avocado toast but i wouldn't ever think oh i'll just make myself a sandwich
S0618	mm
S0619	do you
S0618	no i don't
S0619	no
S0618	no
S0619	er cos i eat erm
S0618	i don't do a lot of well i i tend not to do wheat i have do a little bite the past couple of days
S0619	yeah
S0618	i do out of convenience erm so i don't buy bread so i don't make sandwich i buy wheat free bread erm just because lately i've be enjoy erm on toast
S0619	yeah
S0618	so bean on toast or erm organic peanut butter on toast
S0619	yeah
S0618	just as a little even snack
S0619	i might start get because you know i use to be way more this be a bore conversation about sandwich but er when i be in england and work i'd always buy a sandwich in my lunch hour because
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	it's just sort of er
S0618	i use to get a roll from the roll shop
S0619	a custom yeah
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	buy a sandwich
S0618	i suppose you just can't in poland
S0619	yeah and because you can't
S0618	if you want to buy a sandwich you can't
S0619	yeah you just
S0618	you can buy a waffle with a shitload of cream and treacle and chocolate sauce on it
S0619	yeah but you can't really buy a sandwich
S0618	can't buy a sandwich
S0619	you i mean you can occasionally but it's just not sort of worth the effort
S0618	no
S0619	erm so
S0618	can you i don't think i've ever see a sandwich
S0619	yeah you can in bakeries sometimes
S0618	oh i've see stuff roll in bakeries
S0619	mm
S0618	erm from time to time in the entrance to the shop centre their roll look quite nice
S0619	yeah yeah but not sandwich in sort of erm
S0618	not sandwich
S0619	square bread i guess
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm and i'd never have a sandwich for lunch cos i need real not real food but you know massive lunch
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	massive meals
S0618	i don't think bread be really a food substance i kind of treat it as erm it's usually if i've have a massive lunch which be quite often i just have a bite of bean on toast or a bite of peanut butter on toast
S0619	mm
S0618	for my tea as just like a little snack of an even
S0619	mm
S0618	erm you know maximum what three hundred calories four hundred calories
S0619	mm
S0618	nothing more erm yeah but i i think you know sandwich roll it depend on what you have in them
S0619	mm
S0618	but the type of energy that you're consume isn't really sustain
S0619	mm
S0618	i'd be more incline to have something with rice or
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos in when i eventually get more organise what i would like to do be take some food for in between my lessons
S0618	yeah
S0619	i generally don't have enough time
S0618	yeah
S0619	to eat it even like a banana i sometimes don't have enough time to eat imagine not have enough time to eat a banana
S0618	change your job
S0619	but yeah it's only on mondays that this be a problem
S0618	ah
S0619	erm where i do six hours flat out
S0618	mm can you take a protein shake have you get something with a screw top lid
S0619	yeah i have and i use to do do that in as well
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it's just not enough erm
S0618	i think with that kind of a day
S0619	to fill you up
S0618	yeah well
S0619	you know it's just like drink water
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so so what i end up do be if they ever have you know biscuits and stuff lie around
S0618	yeah
S0619	i just start sort of grab a biscuit which be the worst thing
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	so i might start make sandwich just for
S0618	again it's not
S0619	monday wednesday

S0619	mm
S0618	oh it's just go down from ten degrees to nine and a half degrees bloody hell we be in double digits there
S0618	yeah i bet it's hotter here than it be in northern ireland at the moment that's a really weird think
S0619	yeah
S0618	just mini summer
S0619	i be look at the temperatures in erm i can't remember i think it be thirteen
S0618	wow
S0619	but
S0618	oh oh what for ah
S0619	yeah so it's
S0618	oh that's a bite miserable i hop she'd have nice weather
S0619	i know i think there be on saturday
S0618	mm she's fly home on saturday isn't she oh no monday yeah
S0619	i've go a bite chilly again have you
S0618	yeah i'll put the thingy on how do you pronounce that
S0619	yes i think
S0618	i often wonder about the translations and you know when you get like even a half syllable word like
S0619	uhu
S0618	which be more just a grunty noise who's this big flappy bird wow that's no buzzard it look like a
S0619	wow that's a huge bird
S0618	wow that er wow i don't know what that be wow it's a bird of prey and i don't know what it be come on in then look you're in a fuck passat for god's sake to pull over i will there's not a lot of point though really be there for goodness sake anyway erm yeah with these sort of syllable word it probably
S0619	mm
S0618	translate in polish as something like bridge across the river where the hawk hunt
S0619	ah
S0618	or something like that
S0619	i don't think they mean anything
S0618	do you not no
S0619	well you know if you look at place name in england
S0618	mm
S0619	they don't mean anything a lot of them
S0619	well yeah
S0618	bridge over the
S0619	well but
S0618	apart from that
S0619	very
S0619	they're not really
S0619	what do that mean
S0618	i dunno but use to hang out there
S0619	mm
S0618	i don't know that he's bury there i don't know yeah
S0618	my goodness i'm overtake things
S0619	i know we're do very she's on the phone though so
S0618	oh right fair enough yeah
S0618	yeah so more clear clutter for me i'm really quite enjoy it actually
S0619	uhu
S0618	i suppose cos i have something to do when i don't have any playmates
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i think part of erm this live on my own out of town experience have be very good for me to realise i do actually quite like humans
S0619	uhu good
S0618	whereas previously i've kind of have it in my head that i don't really like people
S0619	uhu
S0618	particularly children
S0619	uhu
S0618	and actually that hasn't shift much i don't particularly like children and i love cat
S0619	uhu
S0618	but yeah it's kind of bring home to me now how i be a social animal i do crave human contact and i haven't really have the conscious awareness of that fact before live where i live
S0619	mm
S0618	so it's serve a role and purpose and now it do my head in and i get bore
S0619	mm
S0618	which i never think would've happen
S0619	yeah it's difficult isn't it erm last year i have a well i have a social job but a lot of free time for myself and it be kind of erm what's the word kind of some sort of oxymoron where you're feed up of people because you've be talk to people all day
S0618	mm
S0619	but you crave contact with a a different kind of person
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos you can't build this same er you're not on the same level with your students or with your colleagues necessarily as you be with your friends i mean colleagues that you see sort of every day and you say hi how be you
S0618	yeah
S0619	see you later bye
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so i miss have friends last year erm but i be fine with be on my own it be hard but i really and we've talk about this before i sort of really appreciate the time alone
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i still do and i really need and crave time alone
S0618	yeah
S0619	and as much as i need and crave time with other people so
S0618	that's a lot less for me than i think it ever have be
S0619	uhu
S0618	i always use to really crave time on my own
S0618	erm and i think i still do but i it's very easy to take it
S0619	mm
S0618	when my partner die which be what be that erm august twenty thirteen so we're talk two and a half years ago erm i've have all that time really on my own since then live in a house that we share together
S0619	uhu
S0618	live there on my own but i know that be in a hotel at three o'clock every day have coffee
S0619	mm
S0618	do the crossword and i know i could go to quiz night on a thursday
S0619	yeah
S0618	and just pop into the pub and do a quiz i know you know i've get and and and friends up the road in or or
S0619	mm
S0618	or wherever that i could just go visit
S0619	yeah and sometimes you want to do it and sometimes you don't cos
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah and i wonder if i have a greater appreciation of human contact and company live here because i don't have those options because i don't have that wider social circle spread
S0619	uhu
S0618	over a larger geographical area and i don't have those relationships that i've build with people over years so
S0619	yeah
S0618	it be different yeah it's sort of bring me out of myself really which be not necessarily a bad thing
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i think as much as that yeah and i also sort of really appreciate do nothing as much as do something
S0618	mm
S0619	er i really have to to keep myself happy not do things
S0618	yeah
S0619	sometimes or not do anything or you know not join in
S0618	time
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	yeah
S0618	look out the window daydream whatever it may be
S0619	yeah whatever and then just think it's okay to go no i don't wanna do that today or
S0618	yeah
S0619	and not have to come up with stuff come up with excuse and just say don't wanna do it
S0618	yeah fair enough
S0619	it's good for you those tree be so pretty and so fragile like feather on leave
S0618	what's that sign mean then blue background with a white car with a red cross through it
S0618	i've no idea ah seventy that's why you're go so slow so you and then i'll slow down
S0618	so nothing in the outside lane need to pull over quickly er which we do i'm curious to know what that big flappy bird be earlier
S0619	yeah
S0618	it look
S0619	i've no idea
S0618	it be sort of dark grey with bits of white on its undercarriage it's really a weird colour combination for such a large bird of prey i really can't imagine what it be definitely wasn't a buzzard
S0619	don't know
S0618	cos it be more grey and than brown erm other bird that i know really well red kite wrong colour wrong shape
S0619	mm
S0618	sparrowhawk kestrel it be way bigger erm i can't imagine what it be
S0618	have to look it up when we get home in you get marsh harriers and hen harriers i think the marsh harrier be the rarer and i see
S0618	erm definitely wasn't one of them so i dunno i shall have to look it up which be quite excite
S0619	you shall
S0618	so there's a place come up fairly soonish like in the next twenty minutes where i'll pull in and get some diesel and have a wee if we want to
S0619	excellent ah exhaust just exhaust don't know why
S0618	i think you it's probably an emotional level and you be have a good process
S0619	yeah
S0618	and a good purge and a good clear so that's my theory
S0619	yep you're probably right
S0618	and my instincts suggest you probably be gonna need a fair bite of time star at the wall over the next few days which i'm rather selfishly quite disappoint at
S0619	sorry
S0618	cos i think well fuck 's still ski erm 's in england 's gonna be star at the wall where be my friends so
S0619	i know
S0618	i might have to
S0619	hang out with
S0618	go and find some random strangers who'll speak english to me
S0619	text she's nice
S0618	oh yeah that's true i always forget about her because she's quite antisocial sometimes like me i think she's another one
S0619	she's great
S0618	who like her own space a lot
S0619	mm
S0618	which be fair enough
S0619	yeah she keep herself to herself i mean she come out when she's invite
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	yeah i might just give her a random she use viber rather than whatsapp
S0619	uhu
S0618	i'll give her a random message just to say i'm about let me know if you want coffee or lunch
S0619	yeah she's great
S0618	yeah
S0619	get a lot of time for her she seem
S0618	remind me of her a little bite
S0619	mm
S0618	remind me of her a little bite
S0619	do you think
S0618	yeah that similar sort of a fitness freak sporty vibe but with some
S0619	you know 's get this reputation for be a fitness freak
S0619	and she's really not
S0618	i know she smoke fag and drink beer but
S0619	she's like i've not be to the gym since the summer
S0618	wow
S0619	it's like why do we all think you're a fitness freak
S0618	because then she she then
S0618	in the very next breath talk about this year i'm go to get a six pack
S0618	okay i think that's why maybe she just talk a good fitness rather than actually do it
S0619	yeah i think she be really fit at the begin of last year
S0618	mm
S0619	maybe she's like me and she do sort of
S0618	half and half yeah
S0619	and she be tell me you know in at the begin of the month that she's gonna start again
S0618	yeah
S0619	go to her gym erm so no she's not a fitness freak
S0619	ah she's just erm

S0619	yeah
S0618	that's funny
S0619	cos always say oh you'll really get on with her she really like go to the gym maybe you can go together so i've always see her in my head as a fitness freak
S0618	yeah
S0619	but since i've know her i don't think she's exercise
