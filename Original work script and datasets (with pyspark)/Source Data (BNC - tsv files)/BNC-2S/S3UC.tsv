S0203	awkward
S0202	i tell you
S0203	go
S0202	but but like i would
S0203	i don't think it's necessarily a new think to you know what i think it's slightly
S0202	i know but it's like do you know what i mean
S0203	all the girls
S0202	yeah like all the girls wanna you
S0203	yeah
S0202	no but like do you know when you're tell you can't i don't know if you're the same but i be very malcontent like i something and i want it and i want and i want it and i get it and then i don't want it any more
S0202	and i'm like that and i'm think yeah i could do this and i could do that
S0203	i'm not i'm not a
S0202	no but like
S0203	i've get a lot more of stuff about you
S0202	yeah but i have every single human in the world have
S0203	yeah
S0202	but the thing be like basically now i have commit to spend the rest of my life with one person and don't get me wrong i love to piece and i could never ever imagine cheat on him but i want to do it so bad but i just don't i could never live with the guilt
S0203	yeah
S0202	and i could never do it but i really want to because i can't and it's not even just that i can't it's like the fact that i'm twenty three years old like do i really want to settle down with one person now for the rest of my life and i have i've get two choices i can either with and that'll be it or i can stay with and get marry to him and and
S0203	the difficulty be be don't have a lot of friends that be get marry
S0202	mm
S0203	i don't know how it would feel to be someone so obviously it's quite scary but obviously there be a part of it where you love it and you think it's amaze
S0202	mm
S0203	everything that happen like that be it it happen and there will be obstacles that come up
S0202	mm
S0203	like mix feel
S0202	yeah
S0203	i don't know where they come from but er
S0202	no i have i've already i've already and it's probably the wine the wine make me say this but i have always find you attractive when i first meet you i think you be attractive and i fancy you and i have always fancy you and we have
S0203	i have about that to you as well
S0202	you know and it's like it's so difficult and i love i really do and i've never meet anyone so unlike me and i've never want to be with anyone so much but my dilemma be he's twenty eight i'm twenty two and
S0203	he's probably ready to do this
S0202	he's ready to do it and i don't know if i be
S0203	right
S0202	and i don't know if i and he want children and shit like that and i don't think i do like don't get me wrong right now i don't want children ever like right now i think my life
S0202	it would stop everything it would stop everything
S0202	it's different for a man
S0203	yeah
S0202	like they can they can have a child with someone but they don't have to put in nine months
S0203	yeah
S0202	they don't have to breast fee they don't have to do all that shit and like to me it's so scary because like i'm gonna graduate university when i'm twenty six and i'm do a year in industry so the next four years i've get another
S0203	you've get everything plan out that you're do so
S0202	i'm do stuff and my plan when i finish uni will always be travel always that 's happy to come travel with me or let me go travel we've already have this discussion like what if we split what if we split up for six months say what if we have a break and i
S0203	no
S0202	what if
S0203	no
S0202	what if blah blah what if of our relationship now and it's just like i have no choices the two choices that i have be stay with him for the rest of my life
S0203	or er and you don't wanna do either of em
S0202	and i don't wanna do either
S0202	i don't wanna cheat and i don't wanna like
S0202	i mean awful like cos er
S0203	what i will do be erm you go away for a while don't don't be in contact for like a month or whatever and then see if cos it might just be a phase cos it's here right now
S0202	yeah yeah so hard it be so fuck hard it's like me say to you right you've gotta be with this menu for the rest of your life you can't eat anything else
S0203	mm
S0202	you can eat off this menu and that's it
S0203	everything everything you want be not on that
S0202	yeah
S0202	it's so fuck up
S0203	i i magnify
S0203	er a greater extent but it be nothing i can relate to i suppose
S0202	so anyway let's get off the personal things and
S0203	yeah
S0202	i'd like to talk about erm so you want to be a music teacher
S0202	don't you don't you think what what do you think of your band cos i have always listen to your music and i know that i've not see you many live many time and blah blah blah blah
S0203	i know once once be enough for that
S0202	no i know but it's not cos i don't want to it's because every time you have something go on i have something go on and i'm always devastate
S0203	don't in
S0202	no but i'm always devastate and whether you make it or not i'm always devastate that i can't get cos of whatever but
S0203	there's a there's a lot of fan out there yeah and what i will say there's a lot of band that be all technically better than us that be all like have get great singers have get great all the musicians be great and stuff but there's only a certain amount of room for everyone you can't just you can't just trudge along and be i think we be kind of i think
S0202	you be different
S0203	and i think
S0202	like i can't put erm i can't stick a genre on you do you know when play on someone
S0203	i call it i say like indie rock but some of the songs aren't that so i
S0202	no
S0203	er my favourite band be the red hot chili pepper yeah
S0202	yeah
S0203	and i've always love them because
S0202	me too
S0203	yeah really
S0202	i love the red hot chili pepper absolutely fuck adore them i've grow up with them and i fuck
S0203	like i i wasn't quite like that the thing i love about them be like every album's different they're not just rock like there'll be a song full of like
S0202	different innit
S0203	yeah
S0202	every single thing they do from the first to the current album every single album be different it offer something else
S0203	but that that's what i love about them that's why my like that because and also love them yeah that's why it kind of work it
S0202	really
S0203	we all we all improvise load live and not many other band do that sort of thing so i think that's the sort of thing that would be
S0202	they stick with one thing don't they like kasabian's latest album be the same as every other album they've ever do
S0203	yeah i hate that one as well
S0202	i fuck hate it
S0203	forty eight
S0202	forty eight thirty three or something
S0203	yeah
S0202	like why so shit
S0203	get erm they've get one song on it so like easy which be a single which i think be alright and i listen to the entire album like
S0202	shit
S0203	oh
S0202	yeah it's the same it's the same as all the rest right
S0203	do you know who i think's really good at the moment ed sheeran's new album it's brilliant it's brilliant
S0202	it i i love ed sheeran cos like he do like a song he'll do one song say he'll do a really slow song and be really downbeat and like really like life affirm or whatever and then you'll listen to his next song
S0202	well two actually
S0202	erm and then you'll listen to the next one like completely different the ones that you've hear the first time and that's what i love about him he's different he doesn't stick to oh i'm so depress and i hate everyone and i'm sing melancholy songs and it go up and it then go back down but oh i love that about him really do like that he change but you listen to pop songs and they all sound the same

S0203	oh right
S0202	blur chili pepper have you ever hear erm crash test dummy
S0202	they be like erm all the songs sound the same in a way but that's because the singer the lead singer have get a distinct voice
S0203	right
S0202	so so all his songs they don't sound the same the melody the melody's different the chord or whatever they be
S0202	they all sound different
S0203	you learn
S0202	yeah i'm learn but his his voice be so distinct that this this you know that it's him they don't sound the same but you know that it's him you know it's that that band
S0203	the only real now ed sheeran's get a really unique voice but it's also technically brilliant as well like he can he
S0202	he can rap and sing
S0203	yeah he can do everything he be brilliant
S0202	yeah
S0203	but there's not a lot of people out there right now that be different there's a lot of people that have similar voice or something like that and what i wanna do be i don't have a great natural voice i want to make my voice something different
