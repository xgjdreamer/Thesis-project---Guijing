S0282	okay so what do you think of 's house
S0283	i be really impress i think it be go to a bite scraggedy and i didn't think that it would have the fantastic view that it's get and i think that the erm garden and the meadow be superb i think the way that it be lay out be actually really good so i think it be a very nice house actually and very easy for a large number of people to live in
S0282	and what well how do you feel about all their furnish and everything cos i think that everything be standardise like that i didn't know if that be a good operate or a bad operate cos it be a bite homogeneous in a way but then on the other hand it look very clean and neat and and usable
S0283	i didn't mind it be homogeneous at all i think it's actually quite sensible to just go through the shop and buy a house christmas deliver from or whatever it be
S0282	mm
S0283	and a good erm no i think i don't know i think actually i it's it's it's sometimes a bite off put when you go to someone's or when you go to the country when when you go to a cottage and and you get scrag end of furniture and scrag end of cutlery and scrag end of crockery and nothing fit together and it's all the second or all the stuff that's be throw away so i think
S0282	yeah but that's like our house that's like our normal house that we live in now not like a holiday cottage
S0283	not well no
S0282	goodness what our holiday cottage would be like it'd be like your granny's house
S0283	well exactly
S0282	a health asset
S0283	i don't think my granny's house would be a health asset she
S0282	your mum say it be a health asset
S0283	my granny live till ninety four didn't she so she can't
S0282	yeah but she would
S0283	can't be that much of a health asset erm and my granddad live till ninety four as well erm yeah no i know it's it's not the way that we live it's not the way that we live although have say that we do still every night eat off the habitat crockery that i buy when i first move into my flat twenty nine thousand years ago
S0282	but and the relevance of that be what
S0283	that actually i do quite like set of things in order imagine what you do be to go and buy different set of crockery every week and and then just put them all in the cupboard and not use them
S0282	no that's cos look at so it's no that's different it be a different debate but then do that do you think that mean that when they come here they look at all our stuff and they go oh dude oh oh
S0283	i don't think they use that tone of voice no
S0282	yes but we be down the opposite end of the scale we be i mean you know look this be your granny's thing and actually
S0283	that's
S0282	it still get your granny's lace make things inside it i'm not i'm not
S0283	yeah i know
S0282	a funny
S0283	but the at at at their main home their main home be mix and match and hotchpotch that actually although
S0282	be it
S0283	yes it be it be
S0282	no it's all it's all er tap sofas and and
S0283	no it's not
S0282	and sail cloth wall and
S0283	no the sit the sit room
S0282	it be
S0283	the sit room upstairs for example's get some global ikea bookcases and then some billy bookcases
S0282	and a pink carpet
S0283	and a pink carpet
S0282	but nobody ever go in there
S0283	no well we don't even
S0282	and actually those chair those two chair be now down in
S0283	i know er i think actually that the
S0282	oh when actually say to oh you're actually sit in that chair
S0283	yes
S0282	as if nobody usually sit in that chair
S0283	and she didn't say that she say oh i see you've you've manage to make use of the chair be what she say
S0282	well that also suggest that it's not be make use of
S0283	they it suggest they have a conversation as to whether or not to take it down there and choose in the end to do so but i'm not sure whether she be take a piss out of for sit in a chair that he hadn't sit since he bring it down or whether she be say see i tell you that we need to take this chair down
S0282	do you think it be a marital
S0283	almost certainly
S0282	do you think so
S0283	not a proper one they don't i think they're quite content with each other at the moment i don't think it be a sort of marital that we might have
S0282	mm ah and it's quite
S0283	why be you do all this dirty line wash in front of all these people
S0282	no i'm not no it's just no i'm interest in what you think and i be just say to that i wouldn't want i wouldn't want to have a house that i leave sit there in the middle of nowhere for days and days on end and didn't go back to in case you know well i don't know i would i would either want to be there all the time or i would resent that i wasn't there all the time and think you know why
S0283	well
S0282	why until i why be i here
S0283	but the question
S0282	or else i'd forget about it and i would say oh my goodness it cost me so much money and why you know i should be there because actually the heating's be on for three days but i've not be have the benefit of it
S0283	but i think the question be i think the question be why do you want it what do you want it for er because they might want to live in the country but they can't because of so you know until leave school they pretty much have to live near the school they want to be in and it's not gonna be cos she have to grow up with friends so they
S0282	well she could have new friends
S0283	but i think often they probably have to be in london so they're then think okay we want somewhere that's a bolt hole er and so they get that place which be actually fine be say that it be on the outside of the erm area they be look at because of its distance from london we wouldn't want a place like that what we have do be to move out of london so that we actually have that tranquillity in our daily home so we have a larger home with a larger garden with tranquillity which be absolutely fantastic that's what we want and then when we need to go to london we go to london and i go to london every day to work so i don't think the question arise and we have think as to whether or not if we ever have any money we might get a country a a a a little cottage in the country i don't think we need to you know
S0282	no but i think we also have the debate when we say well you could go somewhere different every time and actually it might be a bite constrict to have to go somewhere to the same place every time and that actually you might want to have a look at the country because and you know and go to different place like when we do all those cottages in the south east of england that we be go to different cottages each time
S0283	we be
S0282	and they be perhaps only ten or fifteen miles distant from each other but we saw something different and go to different place each time
S0283	but then
S0282	and we didn't we weren't oh yes let's go back to shrewsbury let's show those people shrewsbury cos they haven't see shrewsbury yet but we'd see shrewsbury every weekend for the last six months cos
S0283	but they have a they have a bite of what i be go to say be again as i say over the weekend actually if they have take into decision in their mid forties to buy a place that they can go to ten time a year for the next forty years that's four hundred time that they're go to go there so that doesn't you know if they go there once a month
S0282	be that only a pound a time then
S0283	it's a thousand pound a time
S0282	that's still get expensive that isn't it
S0283	but it's yes it be but they still they still have a very erm if they go there if they go there once a month for the next forty years then they can go you know once every two months to somewhere else as well
S0282	well i don't think anybody go there that often do they and what about you know your aunt and uncle with that place in wales where er goodness know that must be absolutely a grim time to leave london and get to wales on a friday night
S0283	well yeah but they've do it most weekend for the last forty years
S0282	really most weekend
S0283	a lot of weekend
S0282	be that true
S0283	at least once a month
S0282	really
S0283	they go there a lot and now they're give up in in in their eighties
S0282	mm
S0283	as they're older than mum he's older
S0282	yes he be older
S0283	yeah so he's in his mid eighties or his early eighties
S0282	mm
S0283	so they've be go there for forty years i i you know i think it's er just it's a choice that you make and for the benefit of those listen on this tape we're now watch er with one eye jamie oliver poke a bite of rosemary through some bacon
S0282	no no it's er devil on horseback
S0283	okay
S0282	he's make devil on horseback erm yes okay well erm how old be they yes he must be well into his if your mum be eighty
S0283	well she's she's not eighty she's
S0282	no she's not eighty yet
S0283	she's seventy eight erm
S0282	but he's he's a few years older than her
S0283	i mean yeah she's seventy eight and he's a couple of years older than her so he's about eighty
S0282	oh be that oh hang on a second that party when be that last party be that his eightieth his eightieth and 's thirtieth fortieth
S0283	fiftieth
S0282	fiftieth
S0283	yeah
S0282	mm yeah well i don't know
S0283	that be last year
S0282	i mean er would you go to oh er i can't i can't imagine i would i think i would just end up feel
S0283	well from that be a bite of a pain in the backside
S0282	well at least they be on the west hand side of london
S0283	yeah
S0282	you know it's not the they haven't they're not start out from or something
S0283	mm
S0282	but erm er i think i would end up i would end up feel that it be a chore i think
S0283	i would go
S0282	to have to go there on a friday
S0283	i would go to
S0282	i mean to sort of
S0283	from here but i wouldn't go to from where they live
S0282	no but even here i mean and be just talk a while ago about when they have to go down and see 's parent in erm
S0283	mm
S0282	
S0283	no
S0282	and how grim it be on the m3
S0283	yeah
S0282	on a friday and how er and how the only way they could do it be to go home have their dinner and then set off at eight o'clock or nine o'clock at night and that be the only way to get through there with a clear run because at any other time that you might choose any time over the weekend
S0283	yeah
S0282	you just get stick in a traffic jam on that on the a303 or whatever it be
S0283	well as i say if he be drive from here and he didn't have to get out of london that's one thing but the think of go to the m3 every friday be just a pain in the back side
S0282	yeah
S0283	and then have to get past every friday be a pain in the back side
S0282	yeah
S0283	but then i think two hours be broadly well it take two hours to get to the cottage
S0282	mm no no
S0283	more than two hours more er but you would want to do it for a long weekend and not for three not for two days
S0282	well just you know the way we've honestly you've hardly get time to turn round haven't you i mean and look at them we've leave them next day and they've get how many they've get six duvets to wash and god know what you know so actually how can you you know it's this lovely idea that you have people for the weekend but the dishwasher go i don't know how many time you get all that wash
S0283	i know
S0282	on the friday night and you get the clean
S0283	i know
S0282	ah do you hear what erm say about and 's place erm their bed their bed have no bed sleep by other people their bed be absolutely filthy and she say when you go to get after the shower you put you look down and put to put your foot on the bathmat and the bathmat be absolutely filthy and they didn't know and everything in the in the house be utterly filthy so you know other people who'd be invite for the weekend have sleep in that bed and they hadn't clean they hadn't change the bed
S0283	my parent would
S0282	she say and she say they be really really disgust
S0283	well i hope the people who've be there before be
S0282	mm mm mm
S0283	what be we test this for be this for idiom be this for what
S0282	i've get to send it to them in order to
S0283	but what be they test for
S0282	for audibility useablity
S0283	no no what what what do they want to pick up the use of idiom or use of language linguistics or what
S0282	erm that be comparative well the reason i'm do the test this test
S0283	no i know i know i know i know
S0282	alright it's okay fine the reason they're do this be because they're compare the past record of people speak in the past
S0283	yeah
S0282	they specifically want people who're indigenous english speakers english be their first language and they be bring up in this country
S0283	yeah
S0282	because it be about the use of english language some of them be they're particularly interest in young people and teenagers and how they speak so next
S0283	it's gonna be reem innit
S0282	yeah so i suppose it's probably then about use of language use of idioms use of of of of erm their slang
S0283	jargon slang
S0282	slang etcetera etcetera and also i suppose probably also it'll be census construction and
S0283	yeah
S0282	and vocabulary and stuff like that so i i would imagine it's gonna be about vocabulary as well you know how big people's vocabulary be and how erm be or
S0283	yeah
S0282	how wide range the number of word that people use in general conversation etcetera
S0283	interest well that's an interest study
S0282	yeah
S0283	we've do twelve minutes now which be probably enough for them to test the audibility isn't although actually i'm not make a huge impact on the old erm oscillator thing so i hope i'm loud enough
S0282	well i don't know i have to listen back to it and see what happen
S0283	yeah where do you think the microphone be
S0282	i do it i have it in the car i be do record in the car and i be do directions so i have it on my lap in the car and i think it be gonna be like in the old days when you do tap
S0283	well what's what's happen now no it's it's barely hear me at all
S0282	well i well it might be no good i just have to
S0283	where's the microphone
S0282	i don't know where the microphone be
S0283	well shall we stop it and listen to ourselves and see what's happen
S0282	ah i suppose we could do couldn't we okay next
