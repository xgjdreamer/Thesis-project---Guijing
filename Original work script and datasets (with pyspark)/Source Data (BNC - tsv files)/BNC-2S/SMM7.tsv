S0421	erm how long do you think it's gonna be
S0423	well half an hour maybe
S0421	oh right
S0423	be that too long
S0421	no i'm just wonder i'm quite hungry
S0423	oh right
S0421	we've get talktalk internet now as well
S0423	have you
S0421	yeah they come and put it in for us like the day after we move in
S0423	well then how come you've go with talktalk then
S0421	it's cheap the cheapest
S0423	so who do you have before
S0421	bt
S0423	get you a starter
S0421	oh it be an absolute rip off bt
S0423	well i'm not on i've not go with them now and i haven't do in years
S0421	cos we use to always have them because like we just never change
S0423	yeah look that look alright
S0421	yeah
S0423	well that's what they rely on a lot of people don't
S0421	yeah
S0423	and so they don't look around and that's
S0421	and then but we be pay so much so we've get talktalk and then he come this person and like sort it
S0423	well yeah i tell your mammy years ago that it's really cheap
S0421	yeah it's good
S0423	and er
S0421	and it work
S0423	of course it do i can watch film on the internet with it
S0421	but like he come this engineer
S0423	yeah
S0421	and then cos we get our box in the post like the the router
S0423	yeah
S0421	and erm he come to install the phone line and usually they install like the router for you as well and he didn't so i have to
S0423	oh right
S0421	follow the instructions in the box and i be like oh it's alright i mean they be cheaper and everything and mammy be like why do they not install it and i'm like i've manage to do it it only take me five minutes
S0423	i just get mine in the post
S0421	yeah
S0423	and i just do it cos there's not much to install really you just i mean
S0421	cos on on bt they're always like don't attempt to install it yourself
S0423	oh really
S0421	like we will come and do it for you
S0423	oh well that's why cos they wanna charge you so much you see
S0421	yeah probably
S0423	and make out that it's something special to do but you know you don't have to do much to put the router get the router sort do you
S0421	yeah well we don't have erm a phone because we never use a phone so
S0423	what so you're just get the internet yeah
S0421	yeah like we have to have the phone line to get the internet through
S0423	yeah
S0421	but we're not like plug in our phone
S0423	well it's only another fiver for a phone line isn't it to have a phone plug in you know if you want a a line you what be you just pay for the phone line
S0421	yeah so that we can have the internet through it but like we don't want the phone because whenever we've use the landline to make call it's always work out like more expensive
S0423	well no you you you pay
S0421	than the mobile because of our mobile package be really good and we can make
S0423	you only pay five pound and you call anything for free
S0421	no i mean but it's just the pay for just like no i mean like company number and stuff cos that's all we ring and company number
S0423	right
S0421	charge and it's the same as like
S0423	cos on the mobile they charge more don't they
S0421	no they don't they er it's it's worse on well cos when we use the landline it be just as much because of the mobile package that we've get it's some of them they charge more
S0423	well i think your mammy be say she's be pay thirty pound to ring the gas
S0421	yeah because we be on the phone to them for like three three hours
S0423	yeah but if if you ring the landline
S0421	no it's just as bad because we ring
S0423	what in
S0421	no in we ring all these company like sort out gas and internet and everything and our phone bill be like fifty odd pound or something
S0423	well that's probably cos of the package you have with bt
S0421	no because we be suppose to have free call but all these number that we have to ring these company be all exempt
S0423	oh why they be 0845 or something
S0421	yeah they be all exempt so it just
S0423	oh right
S0421	work out just as well for us to just ring on the mobile
S0423	can you read that temperature and time
S0421	er cook for eighteen to twenty minutes
S0423	yeah
S0421	er what's do you want temperature
S0423	yeah gas mark six
S0421	two er two hundred degrees
S0423	gas mark
S0421	gas mark
S0423	so even you
S0421	six
S0423	struggle to read these things
S0421	cos it's crumple
S0423	why do they do that
S0421	it's crumple and it's shiny and the light's shin on it
S0423	do you want erm do you want some smoothie
S0421	yeah what flavour be it
S0423	oh oh
S0421	mangoes and passion
S0421	oh
S0423	do you want a few crisp to go with it
S0421	yeah
S0423	be that glass alright
S0421	yeah i'm gonna have to taste your water later though
S0423	why
S0421	because well cos
S0423	do you not like it where you be
S0421	yeah we've be drink and we've be like it taste weird like
S0423	oh yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos this water be suppose to be really pure around here
S0421	yeah i don't know i think but it feel different as well like when i wash my hand it feel different on my skin
S0423	really
S0421	yeah it's like when i put soap on my hand and i'm like wash my hand
S0423	mm
S0421	it's like i'm not wash the soap off but i have
S0423	strange
S0421	yeah i don't know
S0423	well the water in this area be mean to be it's mean to be really good
S0421	yeah it it's good
S0423	be what i've hear yeah maybe it's just cos it's not what you're use to
S0421	yeah it's probably just different
S0423	so i mean it's the same as you have in
S0421	yeah i just it's just change so i'd say it seem different
S0423	there you be mm but but be you go inside or be you stay here i'm come in now anyway cos there's nothing to do
S0421	oh right okay
S0423	come in in a minute well you don't have to go to bed early tonight or anything do you
S0421	no
S0423	shall i show you what what i've be look at a couple of
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	a couple of options i mean you can browse and see if you can find anything else if you're not keen on them
S0421	well we're lucky that there's still place to book cos we're leave it quite late aren't we
S0423	yeah fortunately i don't think the kid will be yet like the kid will in in school holiday at that time then i mean it probably be come up to it not far off it but
S0421	like mid july i think isn't it
S0423	mm so you've get from the sixth to the tenth book
S0421	oh right yeah
S0423	they say i can upgrade to a better caravan and make it a week where we're stay
S0421	mm
S0423	and i'll look we could look for somewhere else for a few odd days but i get i think well you might prefer a a lodge or something like that for for the weekly stay
S0421	yeah don't know the caravan might be a bite cramp
S0423	no it wasn't when we be in scotland be it
S0421	yeah it wasn't bad actually that caravan mm
S0423	it depend what bungalow type thing you get
S0421	yeah cos that could be cramp
S0423	you know some of them be not er great we be lucky in scotland with that as well we have
S0421	yeah
S0423	a nice one
S0421	wow that be cool that be for like six people wasn't it
S0423	mm we won't be get one like i don't think
S0421	well because when you say when we go to italy and you be like oh i've get a little like house or whatever it be and it be like a room
S0423	i know that's it you see you don't want a you may we may as well have a caravan something like that
S0421	yeah
S0423	some of the caravan be they're great they're massive
S0421	mm
S0423	erm so you could look at that as an option there's the bigger caravan possibly they might be a good price
S0421	have you fix whatever be wrong with your internet with that re stall
S0423	well i've i've do it a few time and the problem be it keep
S0421	do it
S0423	even when i i change the it's when i get an update so it keep update and and then i keep change it and eventually i be feed up so i think right i'm gonna go into the control panel and say ask me before you install any upgrade
S0421	oh yeah yeah
S0423	so i do that and then it just do the bloody update when i shut down again
S0423	so then i've i've shut it off and it say it's not recommend that you don't have update but for temporarily until i you know get this sort i've i've shut off
S0421	what be it do
S0423	so i don't get any update any more
S0421	mm
S0423	and i've check the update it's put down cos i be gonna look if it be something obvious and just delete that update
S0421	it's probably a bug in it or something i'm surprise no one's report it
S0423	well no there's various things it could be cos it it's the it it's come up dep er the data execution prevention
S0421	mm
S0423	there's a programme in there that stop and they say you you may have when you when you say what could be the problem they say it could be when you when you run update a company have send you an update and it's not compatible with this dep
S0421	mm
S0423	and you should install uninstall it but all the update be from windows from microsoft
S0421	mm
S0423	so i don't i don't get it
S0421	mm
S0423	so i'll have to look a bite more in depth so this be the only solution i could figure out er temporarily for now erm i mean i've get there's like free erm avg security er thing and what have you on it so you would think if there be a it it the computer's under attack or anything it should pick something up so there's no sign of anything like that go on but i think it's just a glitch in one of these program that be download maybe if i change my browser from internet explorer to
S0421	be it internet
S0423	something else
S0421	internet
S0423	yeah
S0421	explorer be a rubbish browser
S0423	mm
S0421	get google chrome
S0423	yeah i be just
S0421	that's better
S0423	just think that today that might be a more better long term solution so i think google chrome or firefox or
S0421	like if you can help it like no no one use internet explorer any more
S0423	really
S0421	i mean people do but it's quite slow and there's like stuff wrong with it and
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't have internet explorer
S0423	well i've not have problems with it before but i think that might be a a way of solve it
S0421	have you hear that like you know like windows ten or something that's come out i think it's gonna be like a free update if you've get an old windows
S0423	oh really
S0421	mm
S0423	mm i've not hear of that this vista be be not very much rat either be it it's not suppose to be that great
S0421	yeah but the new like
S0421	the new like windows eight they've get have get so many problems with it
S0423	mm
S0421	and erm like most people have that one and they say they're like oh yeah windows ten you can have it for free because it be
S0423	oh right i wonder if they'll give it me or if it's just if you've eight
S0421	yeah i dunno i think you might get it
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't know if you want it though it look really different like i don't
S0423	yeah
S0421	i don't know how to work it
S0423	oh right
S0421	it's like you know on like your smartphone where you have like apps
S0423	mm
S0421	and it's like you click them but on windows eight they didn't have a start menu but in windows ten they've bring the start menu back so it's a bite easier to navigate
S0423	oh right
S0421	but yeah in windows eight there be no start menu and people be like what be i do
S0423	yeah you'd think before do update like that they'd consult people i don't like the look of that what's come down there
S0421	file task
S0423	and i'm gonna get those chip in cos they take half an hour
S0421	uhu
S0423	get multiple problems with your computer
S0421	yeah and it say you've get load of security problems
S0423	that doesn't sound good do it
S0421	it's probably you er erm disable all those update or something
S0423	maybe it's come from them because it's think well why can't we send these update he's get a problem
S0421	i'm gonna eat all these crisp
S0423	do you want more
S0421	what
S0423	maybe maybe you'd better not have more more cos you might not eat your pizza
S0421	do you know i be just think the other day how long it have be since i have some doritos and i be like i really want some doritos and here we be
S0423	oh that's good isn't it
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	i don't get them often but they they be tasty and they
S0421	i have one of those
S0423	they're quite addictive aren't they
S0421	i have one of those usb like mobile stick things
S0423	mm
S0421	and the internet go quite fast
S0423	yeah that's what i be think and it might
S0421	it's not like it wasn't a good value for money
S0423	oh right
S0421	but i dunno you could try it like it's not too bad if you just browse occasionally
S0423	mm
S0421	but it do kind of work out more expensive like if you ever want to use
S0423	oh right
S0421	skype or anything
S0423	oh right yeah i'm better stick to
S0421	like there would be like no way you could use skype
S0423	mm
S0423	install the i don't want to do this cos it's gonna start instal all that stuff again isn't it
S0421	probably
S0423	now let's see security centre
S0421	yeah who know what it's do just get chrome you've get chrome
S0423	yeah i've not i've not instal it though
S0421	how's it there then be it just like do you have to
S0423	well it's probably an option if i
S0421	do you think
S0423	right click i think so yeah it doesn't i've take it off anyway
S0421	do you ever click it
S0423	probably er i may not have try it no
S0421	what to it'll be instal
S0423	oh right it's not it's go slow cos it's still probably load stuff up and from the internet
S0421	nothing's happen yeah
S0423	just leave it to
S0421	why be your laptop this like how old be your laptop
S0423	well i don't know it's er
S0421	that wallpaper i put that on for you when your laptop be like brand new within like the first i don't know when you get it and you've still get it
S0423	mm
S0423	it must be six seven years i think this
S0421	yeah
S0423	mustn't it so it's do alright hasn't it that
S0421	mm
S0423	really
S0421	it be quite slow
S0423	well it's not it's be work since i've stop those update
S0423	it's be really great
S0421	well it's slow now
S0423	well yeah it's take a while to
S0423	yeah that's what it's say cos i've turn it off and that's what it want to bring to my
S0421	yeah look
S0423	attention and it think
S0421	you've get chrome
S0423	oh right so shall i just start use that
S0421	well yeah what be it just internet explorer that keep mess up
S0423	well i don't know it's not it well well i'll find out cos if i start use chrome
S0421	mm
S0423	to go
S0421	oh
S0423	on the internet and let them do the update again
S0421	mm
S0423	and it doesn't bring it up then i
S0421	cos i think internet explorer be sometimes quite out of date so maybe it's just not compatible with the new software
S0423	possibly yeah oh right so i might do that i might
S0421	mm
S0423	might er put the er update on again and then when i try to get on the internet try chrome and see if that make a difference
S0421	mm
S0423	right what time have i put those things in time go quick doesn't it

S0423	and this i think the last day be probably the sixteenth then so it's like a twelve day break or something
S0421	that be like such a be we gonna find one where be we gonna stay
S0423	no we find it alright it be okay that wasn't it
S0421	yeah i know but
S0423	i mean we won't have a problem find somewhere i'll even stay in the caravan can we stay another night and they probably don't do that cos it might be fully book and they probably don't rent out for one night but i can always ask them if we pay them a bite more so erm let's go to view yeah it's run very slow so this be probably what the bungalows be like that but i'm guess
S0421	oh
S0423	because it
S0421	it's quite nice
S0423	oh it be park bungalow
S0421	oh
S0423	so it's like on a holiday park with lot of
S0421	mm
S0421	it's strange that isn't it them holiday park with all these just bungalows like next to each other it just look weird
S0423	yeah i mean they have they have all different stuff lodge
S0421	mm
S0423	and all kinds of things but if it's like that
S0421	mm
S0423	that look alright doesn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	it look spacious it look like it's probably quite a small tv but what i might do cos i don't know if there's a dv or it say tv dvd
S0421	mm
S0423	but just in case i might bring this laptop and i know it's a small screen but if we wanna watch a film
S0421	mm
S0423	and there's no dvd we can always at least we have something rather than you know at night
S0423	there's not always something on telly so if it's like this that
S0421	mm
S0423	look okay doesn't it and a
S0421	i think we
S0423	choice of lodge villas apartments bungalows or cabin but we're go for the bungalow
S0421	mm
S0423	cos that's all that's come up really so the rest must be book er out i mean there be more further down but they're all dearer
S0421	mm
S0423	so that's kind of the price range erm i'm look at especially as we're probably gonna have to spend an extra night somewhere i mean we could look at this it's a similar price three forty what be that
S0421	caravan
S0423	it seem it's that's a caravan
S0421	oh wide caravan
S0423	so that's probably
S0421	one double and two twin that's still quite big isn't it
S0423	a twelve foot one
S0421	although er oh that's what we have in
S0423	no it's not one of those and that
S0421	in scotland
S0423	that yeah it'll be similar to that though
S0421	cos i have an extra bed in mine didn't i
S0423	yeah yeah
S0421	it's get a shower get a microwave tv dvd
S0423	that's what it say on the other though isn't it
S0421	be that
S0421	be that the caravan
S0421	that's nice
S0423	that be nice that isn't it why be it show a picture of that one
S0421	er be that a lodge
S0423	well it say caravan though doesn't it
S0421	yeah it say caravan but it's show a picture of a
S0423	well it probably just
S0421	very nice look lodge
S0423	well yeah probably be doesn't show you the caravan probably think well you know what
S0421	that's get a balcony and everything that lodge
S0423	yeah
S0421	or be that a cottage a villa or an lot of different things
S0423	oh i see oh have i click on a right thing cos
S0421	caravan yeah it's just not show you the caravan
S0423	yeah i click on view accommodation didn't i accommodation
S0421	yeah
S0423	information yeah but yeah they they look nice these type of lodge
S0421	mm
S0423	it's probably a lodge those type of ones aren't they oh look archery
S0423	golf we could bring back our love of golf
S0421	do you know on that hill across from my house
S0423	see i i think these picture be quite standard so whatever our
S0421	yeah
S0421	oh
S0423	but although this be different to the bungalow though isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0421	you know on that hill across from my house
S0423	yeah
S0421	there's a golf course
S0423	yeah yeah you think of join
S0421	no i be i be like i saw someone pull something behind them and i'm like what be they do and they be play golf on the hill
S0423	oh a golf buggy yeah so the these be it probably be those big they be probably a a lodge or a bungalow although
S0421	mm
S0423	we're in a bungalow they're probably a lodge or a villa aren't they
S0421	mm
S0423	cos it look at the the room look much nicer don't they there's be that a caravan do you think
S0421	no that's a a villa or something
S0423	that's a lodge that but well how come it look square there
S0421	cabin it's a cabin
S0423	oh be it
S0421	yeah that's not a caravan
S0423	mm
S0421	it's get a porch
S0423	well some caravan have those attach to them
S0421	do they
S0423	yeah so you rather the bungalow than a caravan
S0421	well i've not see the caravan so yeah probably
S0423	well
S0421	that bungalow look nice doesn't it
S0423	well i don't know it look quite basic
S0423	it look alright but we er we just want somewhere that's reasonable cos
S0421	mm
S0423	we're not gonna be in we're gonna be there the morning and and the even
S0421	mm
S0423	and all day we're gonna be out so it's not something we're gonna be spend age in
S0421	mm
S0423	yeah i don't why be it not show you a picture of the caravan i think that's a bungalow right caravan what if i click on that right i'm just gonna get that pizza in

S0423	well i er those chip have to be on a bite longer than the pizza so
S0421	mammy just say that she's be to buy polyfilla

S0421	yeah it look a bite nice well not that a caravan be not nice but
S0423	no we're not gonna see a picture of it be we really
S0421	be there a reason they don't want to show us the caravan

S0421	oh
S0423	i mean people like
S0421	most of them say electricity include
S0423	and they're a bite dearer than i saw earlier and they oh here we be here's one three five six sleep up to two
S0423	look like a shed doesn't it
S0423	these other ones look alright but up to two be a bite worry isn't it
S0421	that's weird yeah up to two
S0423	oh these date be not right be they
S0421	like what that almost suggest that well it sleep one but we can put another
S0423	that you could squeeze a second one in
S0421	bed in it if you want
S0423	oh this be i think i be look at this one basic two bedroom chalet with sea sea glimpse
S0421	it's probably gonna be like 's sand dun and then it's gonna be like oh i can see the sea today oh can you where just over that hill a little bite
S0423	so there that's that one it look like it would be
S0421	look a bite grim like
S0423	like
S0421	like mm
S0423	it it's probably near the beach so it's probably in a nice place
S0421	yeah
S0423	look inside it look clean and
S0421	it look like it's just be build out of a slab of concrete though it's like just sit there on the landscape like mm
S0423	mm some photos be take be wide angle angle lens that's to make it look bigger probably
S0421	no but it get the whole room in as well though
S0423	well yeah it say
S0421	doesn't it
S0423	to provide the best visual so that's like the lounge so it's
S0421	mm
S0423	a tiny tv kitchen that'll be your room
S0423	that'll be my room
S0423	one double bedroom two single lounge with sofa
S0421	shower room with separate toilet
S0423	shower room and separate toilet
S0423	do that impress you do it
S0421	no it's just strange cos we our shower's get a separate toilet now
S0423	oh right so erm what do you think out of those two
S0423	do you you want to browse at all
S0421	i think that would be alright
S0423	which one
S0421	i'm not any of them i suppose
S0423	yeah i think once you start browse i've be browse for hours and hours and
S0423	this be what i've come up with cos you you can't especially i'm limit on what i'm spend
S0421	i know but cos like if you don't look at the price you'll just be like oh look at that and it's like mm
S0423	oh yeah you can get some that be great they're like
S0421	yeah
S0423	seven hundred pound
S0421	yeah
S0423	a thousand pound
S0421	i suppose it's alright if there's lot of people go but
S0423	mm well yeah you don't need it for a couple of us something big like that those kind of place
S0421	email to a friend
S0423	so there's the beach and that this be the park
S0421	view over the
S0423	what where
S0421	estuary a bus stop fish and chip
S0423	it doesn't tell you which be ours though
S0421	cricket pitch
S0423	or where it be do it on the map
S0421	no well do it give you a number when you look at it
S0421	mm
S0423	alright hang on there's
S0421	just a bite randomly put in aren't they
S0423	mm see if it be right close to the beach it wouldn't be too bad would it
S0421	i mean be we even gonna go on the beach though
S0423	that's not so b be the red
S0421	can't even see it it's not on there
S0421	you'd think it would be on like near the edge cos er the sea view er well i dunno it say some
S0423	sea glimpse
S0421	sea glimpse
S0421	like right on the other side no it's not there be it
S0423	hang on i'm zoom in so there might be
S0421	be that it there
S0423	oh there it be
S0423	oh it's not the best cos you're right opposite where they collect their key and things like that
S0421	where be it
S0423	there this one the orange one b no that's f
S0421	that's f
S0423	it's be you sure it's b yeah
S0423	mm
S0421	café
S0423	right so b should be all the red shouldn't it
S0421	mm
S0421	maybe it's a new one so they've not get it on
S0423	oh right maybe
S0421	or they've just miss it off it's not there
S0423	mm
S0421	it's weird unless they've do it in a different colour but i don't know why they would
S0423	mm
S0421	of all the ones we're look at they've not get it on
S0423	so it doesn't really tell you much about the place do it though so that's a little but you'd think there'd be picture of it wouldn't you
S0421	mm
S0423	i should have a look at trip advisor you'll probably get people's picture there and
S0421	mm
S0423	what they think of it and
S0421	oh it say recommend on trip advisor
S0423	mm do you wanna have a look on there and also look up that other one er there it be park er it might be worth look at that one on trip advisor wouldn't it
S0421	mm
S0423	not sure what time i put that pizza in now
S0421	hopefully it doesn't burn
