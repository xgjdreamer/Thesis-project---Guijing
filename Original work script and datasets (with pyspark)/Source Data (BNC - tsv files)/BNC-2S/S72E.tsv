S0509	so what's all this about uncle and his car
S0510	oh yeah well erm you know he normally drive erm to work with they sort of take it in turn and
S0509	yeah
S0510	drive in and everything and they have a very set route well be off the other week and so when uncle be come back he kind of decide to go cross country and do a slightly different route
S0509	right
S0510	so he be erm come through sort of and way which be where it's not that far from where auntie live actually and erm it be get er near to dark it be sort of dusk time you know
S0509	right
S0510	so light wasn't brilliant but it be okay and erm he be just come over the the brow of a hill
S0509	yeah
S0510	when out of the corner of his eye he notice something come from the side and it be a deer
S0509	i know
S0510	about
S0509	it be gonna be a deer
S0510	he know those those deer they get everywhere don't they
S0509	yeah
S0510	in the country so i mean 's have a few no two encounter with deer
S0509	right
S0510	erm both of them have cost luckily not her life but you know
S0509	but money
S0510	but cost her money cos they do quite a lot of damage cos they
S0509	yeah
S0510	come at really come at speed and the worst thing for uncle be be that you know he be sort of within the speed limit but he be probably at the maximum speed limit at sixty round there
S0509	oh
S0510	so you know he's just come over the brow of a hill see out of the corner of his eye a deer
S0509	oh
S0510	start to you know launch itself and just do all he can to stop the car you know without
S0509	yeah
S0510	spin it like i do on that night come home
S0510	from erm and so he's just brake and brake and just hop for the best but it hit him hit the car
S0509	yeah
S0510	but it's kind of like he clip it almost on the on the side of the car
S0509	right
S0510	and he's just sort of after it's happen you know he it's pronged off somewhere and he's he's carry on slow down so he's sort of near the bottom of this hill and he pull over to get out and have a look and
S0509	yeah
S0510	dust himself down and as he get out he look up the hill and he can see that there's another car at the top of the hill that have also stop and as it turn out what have happen be as he be come over the brow of the hill to go down another guy be come up the hill to go over
S0509	right
S0510	and when uncle clip the deer the other car collect it basically
S0509	oh no
S0510	well it hit the other car so the guy there's a guy up the top there wave down to uncle so he kind of have a quick look at the side of his car and it's you know it's mash up at the side but
S0509	right
S0510	it's not you know it's not insurmountable as it be and he go up to check this guy's okay and everything's alright up there and he go up and this guy's get cut to his head and
S0509	oh my god
S0510	you know to his arm not not really deep cut but you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	he's bleed a bite and everything but he seem pretty compos mentis and erm and you know they be chat say oh be you alright be you okay oh gosh you know uncle see the front of his car and he definitely come off worse for it
S0510	this this other guy
S0509	yeah
S0510	because it's hit the top of the car in the middle
S0509	what
S0510	and if you'd have see a photo i in fact i say to uncle send me the photos cos it's just unbelievable that this guy get out and he be walk and do anything really
S0509	right
S0510	because the whole of the middle of the car be kind of cave in
S0510	erm and the windscreen be totally shatter and you know it's like this it
S0509	right
S0510	in the middle so
S0509	cave in yeah
S0510	yeah just completely cave in so the the deer's obviously hit the top you know near the windscreen anyway by this time another motorist or a couple of motorists actually i think have stop and er this guy be sort of you know say to the the other driver you know be you sure you're alright you know be you sure you don't want an ambulance and he's like no no i'm fine you know i'm just sort of yeah i i've just get a few cut but i'm absolutely fine but look at the car you would never have believe it you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	so no wonder the guy be sort of check him out and everything anyway they go then go on their way although oh that be it this guy have a torch or something they be clear away traffic that be sort of
S0509	right
S0510	come to and fro it just so remind me of my crash in you know in that even
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh my goodness erm and so uncle then help him sort of pull it off of the road into sort of like a layby area with a hedge and everything
S0509	right
S0510	erm and then this other guy go and this lady go erm and they're they're kind of like oh the guy be go oh i don't you know i dunno what happen to the deer it just sort of it all happen so quick and
S0509	yeah
S0510	and be go well you know more often and not know 's experience as well
S0510	erm what happen be they get hit but they just carry on because they almost they get kind of or they just get you know prang over into the thicket or whatever
S0509	yeah
S0510	but often when a deer get hit it keep run you know
S0509	right
S0510	and then it'll kind of just end up sort of you know go its sorry way really erm so er he say oh you know your your car's pretty bad what's it you know what's it like around the back he say oh i don't even know i haven't even look you know so
S0509	yeah

S0509	right
S0510	and have he go round he say oh he say er right so you've not see the back then he say no
S0510	and he say oh you might wanna see this you've you've kind of get a visitor
S0509	oh my god
S0510	and it be unbelievable right this deer what have actually happen be it have hit the centre of the the windscreen at the front it actually go through the window right over to the passenger side the passenger side you know the headrest be completely flatten down where the entry point have be the deer have come into the car pass the driver's head
S0509	what
S0510	right driver hadn't even be aware
S0509	what
S0510	and deposit itself in the boot in the hatchback so as
S0509	oh my gosh
S0510	uncle 's go round the back and there be literally a deer lie in the boot of his hatchback
S0509	oh my god
S0510	it look just look like it's rest it's just like you know bundle up
S0509	jesus
S0510	it doesn't look as if it's get any mark on it on the side that you can see
S0509	right yeah yeah
S0510	but clearly it have and and that's where it end up in this guy's flip boot
S0509	oh my god
S0510	so er
S0509	terrify
S0510	anyway as all this be happen the erm the police have arrive cos the one of the the other motorists have obviously call the police and an ambulance cos they'd while they'd be talk they'd see their car go past but not with the sirens go but with flash light
S0509	yeah
S0510	and an also an ambulance again flash light but no sirens and uncle think oh yeah i wonder if that's for us so then they start come back up the other way slow down and uncle say er have have you be call about a deer that jump out and they say yeah cos and by this point they'd pull the car over into the side
S0509	yeah
S0510	and you couldn't really see what you know what have happen so the police get out ambulance get out you know and er do their thing guy be insistent he be fine he wasn't

S0509	mm
S0510	dear dear the old deer but erm his uncle 's car be in at the garage at the moment thankfully he be fully comp and also he have no claim protection as well so that mean that he use to pay an extra dividend if you like every or premium rather every year to protect his no claim so he could have up to three claim against it and still retain
S0509	retain the no claim bonus
S0510	yeah so he's
S0509	that's a bite of a weird one isn't it
S0510	it be yeah i mean if you've get the money to do it you you know jolly dee and all that but most of us probably haven't erm but so he's get all the work do and and that but you know i think the other guy from what he be say as well be fully insure
S0509	right
S0510	erm but if he'd have have third party fire and theft which a lot of people do
S0509	right

S0509	to fix that king card which be good
S0510	oh good
S0509	and er yeah
S0510	so be you just gonna thread them on to your costume
S0509	yes i be
S0510	i like the way that idea you have with the chain be brilliant
S0509	it it look quite good doesn't it
S0510	oh yeah it look terrific
S0509	i need to pull them in a bite but we'll have to sort that out
S0510	pull pull them in a bite
S0509	oh shorten them
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	really gotta do it right as well so that it doesn't wanna go
S0510	right
S0509	yeah
S0510	with the with the hoop on the end could you not
S0509	yeah
S0510	just put the apron erm
S0509	string
S0510	string through the loop
S0509	be that not what i'm do
S0510	oh be it
S0509	the keyrings
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	that's that's what they're there to
S0510	oh i see i couldn't see that right
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then i'll tie them on but i i've gotta work on shorten them first cos they're too long at the moment
S0510	mm
S0509	so that's the next thing oh i haven't just knock off a card i haven't that's good i think i'd break a card then
S0510	mm
S0509	but erm
S0510	can you not shorten them by what you do last night which be to hook up at
S0509	er mm sort of
S0510	right
S0509	basically when i be hook it before i be hook into the ring that one of the card be on so
S0510	ah
S0509	so the card be then like flip about and go in the wrong way
S0510	oh right
S0509	so i've gotta just have a play with them now but that's
S0510	right
S0509	just do that
S0510	oh
S0509	but erm yeah so i have my sing lesson earlier
S0510	oh yes yeah
S0509	yes
S0510	mm sorry can i just not you know
S0510	just take in the the brilliance
S0509	oh
S0510	of of these sort of chain that you're gonna have round your costume that's so good do you know what use to drill
S0509	no
S0510	erm the chess piece
S0509	he's just get everything have
S0510	be he's
S0509	he's get
S0510	he's steampunk yeah he's
S0509	steampunk
S0510	oh i see i didn't notice that before on your card what you hole punch them with
S0509	yeah the little
S0510	that be a good idea
S0509	butterfly hole punch oh it be cos i couldn't find a normal hole punch
S0510	but do you know what that probably work out better cos it give you more room for manoeuvre with the keyrings go in doesn't it if you'd have have
S0509	yeah
S0510	a little hole there it
S0509	yeah that's true
S0510	it would have make it
S0509	i didn't think of that
S0510	more tricky yeah
S0509	alright that's shorten it a bite anyway erm
S0510	yeah so the chess piece how much be they be
S0509	oh it be like two pound from
S0510	right and they're proper wooden ones aren't they
S0509	yeah they be
S0510	that be cool in fact do you know what they look a bite like the ones that i get from that charity shop don't they that we use

S0509	it's not a scale
S0510	but it's not a scale
S0510	but mm

S0510	be it like the start point it's the not most difficult bite or
S0509	no
S0510	no
S0509	it's just get it's actually the gap that be the most difficult bite
S0510	oh
S0509	cos you have to figure out oh i nearly have the word then yeah anyway
S0509	and lower note cos like i i have quite a high pitch voice
S0510	yeah
S0509	so lower note i'm like wow okay like this
S0509	and i can't find the note
S0510	oh
S0509	but erm yeah and then we be do one of the songs that i'd send to her so we be work on that and like
S0510	oh
S0509	go through a couple of verse of that
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then we overrun but like ten minutes
S0510	oh that's why you be late
S0509	yeah
S0510	well at least you be have fun
S0509	yeah

S0510	mm
S0509	she be just like oh my god my boyfriend's pick me up i need to leave
S0510	so do you think she might be an opera singer herself
S0509	no cos what she be say be she use to teach a lot of opera singers because she have this technique that be helpful to them
S0510	oh right
S0509	this particular technique
S0510	right mm
S0509	she didn't say what it be
S0510	oh
S0509	but yeah god know if this be gonna work yeah
S0510	oh
S0509	have i put it on the wrong side
S0510	no it look like the right side well the end bite do
S0509	yeah it be
S0510	anyway
S0509	yeah it's fine
S0510	mm
S0509	oh
S0510	mm so what's the song again that you're do with her that's your song
S0509	er it be what's it call
S0509	erm panic cord by gabrielle aplin that's it
S0510	oh right
S0509	it's a good song
S0510	and have she choose one for you as well
S0509	no
S0510	or do you just oh
S0509	i just get to choose them
S0510	it's it's not like the naked choir you know
S0509	no
S0510	where you choose one the teacher choose one
S0509	well and your rival choose one
S0510	yeah
S0510	mm
S0509	no yeah so she's that that be good cos then she be like correct the odd specific things so it be like oh
S0510	mm
S0509	and she be like you think it's higher than it be because
S0510	oh
S0509	the singer be do this thing where she have like a really breathy voice
S0510	oh
S0509	and so it sound more high pitch than it actually be so you're go higher than you need to
S0510	oh interest
S0509	i know yeah yeah
S0510	oh
S0509	it be it's good
S0510	so you're do various breathe techniques as well then be that
S0509	er
S0510	part of your warmups and
S0509	breathe wise yeah yeah it's with breathe it be a lot of breathe but it's all just to do with your diaphragm basically
S0510	mm uhu
S0509	and i'm quite good at use that now it's not actually that hard cos you just sort of if you just contract the muscle then you're use it so you can make yourself
S0510	right
S0509	do it
S0510	right
S0509	which be
S0510	oh
S0509	which be good oh there's the chain be that better
S0510	oh yeah yeah turn round let's have a look
S0509	and you just tie them still but
S0510	yeah and and the other side so it can see the other side yeah
S0509	oh oh be careful
S0510	sorry i be just sort of adjust that
S0509	oh yeah the apron
S0510	it's not too tight be it no no it's
S0509	mm
S0510	mm
S0509	oh
S0510	i dunno i i i think they do better lower down have a look in the
S0509	oh no
S0510	get the mirror
S0509	i don't like no it's fine i don't like them lower down
S0510	well i'm not say as low down as they be but i
S0509	i like them like that
S0510	oh you've get the mirror there haven't you
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh well it's your costume darling if you like them
S0509	oh one of them's lower than the other one though that's significantly lower
S0510	be it
S0509	yeah it's just cos it's be it catch no oh oh
S0509	oh wait don't worry i'll sort it
S0510	oh it's different yeah i see what you mean
S0509	they're probably on the wrong keyring that's why
S0510	uhu
S0510	all be reveal
S0509	it's so complicate
S0510	mm
S0509	yeah
S0510	so i haven't get too much sew to do on that it's just that little edge
S0509	no you've just get the little last bite to do
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then it's do right
S0510	well
S0509	be that right
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	so that
S0510	that look more like it that's more balance
S0509	yeah it's go a bite off though
S0510	mm
S0509	i'll figure it out
S0510	it's not the pocket give the illusion of it be off be it
S0509	no
S0510	be the pocket a bite off or something
S0509	no it's not that
S0510	no
S0509	it's definitely it's all really off
S0510	it's not my sew work
S0509	no you you're all fine
S0509	it's just me
S0510	ah
S0509	it's only my problem
S0510	ah
S0509	i'll figure it out why yeah
S0510	it doesn't look that
S0509	it it be anyway
S0510	oh okay well you can work on it anyway can't you
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	okay so what be i do now i'm just sew up that side
S0509	yeah
S0510	and then you're get
S0509	they do look the same length though
S0510	they do
S0509	don't they
S0510	yeah they're the same
S0509	they're not
S0510	you see
S0509	yeah that one be
S0510	different
S0509	that one's like that one's like two link longer or something
S0510	ah right well it could be all the difference
S0510	er i guess in term of where you're put it whether you're put the longer one first behind as well you know if it's overlap it might change the distance a bite
S0509	i'm try to understand what you're say
S0510	yeah sorry
S0509	and fail
S0510	i'm not explain myself very well be i erm so how be they come together at the back there let's have a look
S0509	that one thread that one thread on first then that one
S0510	yeah
S0509	so it's like that
S0510	well it shouldn't make that much difference really should it
S0509	no
S0510	it's only a a little ring
S0509	yeah
S0510	above as it be
S0509	i'll sort it out at a later date
S0510	okay
S0509	i'll probably sort my erm hat now
S0510	oh that'll be good
S0509	mm
S0510	you've you've use all your chess piece there have you have you not get any spare
S0509	oh i've get load spare
S0510	oh be you gonna put any in your hat

S0509	yeah
S0510	sort of what what do you call those
S0509	top hat
S0510	i know it's a top hat
S0510	no you know
S0510	i know it's top hat
S0509	well well what be this then
S0510	i didn't think it be a bowler for goodness sake
S0509	what be the gesture
S0510	or a witch's hat
S0509	well what come on then
S0510	er the rods that come out
S0509	oh hatpins
S0510	oh hatpins thank you
S0509	that's just as simple as top hat
S0509	and totally don't go give yourself air and grace mummy
S0510	well it's not every day i wear a hatpin but there again it could be say it's not every day i wear a top hat either
S0509	when have you ever
S0510	well quite
S0509	i think you be gonna come out with some story then
S0510	oh no well
S0509	oh well when i use to go club in london
S0510	no although have say that at the camden palace
S0510	that wouldn't have surprise me if see somebody walk in in the eighties with a top hat
S0509	cool
S0510	erm you know rock a top hat
S0509	have you ever hear the song erm i wish i be punk rocker
S0510	oh yeah that ring a bell
S0509	it's a good song you sound you look so disgust by it
S0510	er i'm no i'm i'm just
S0509	i wish i be a punk rocker with flower in my hair
S0510	in my hair i think i've get it erm what's her name
S0509	it's really good
S0510	it's
S0509	i dunno what the name be
S0510	i'm sure i've get her cd
S0509	cos i i hear a cover of it and it's
S0510	yeah no it's it be good it be good it she's sort of almost like a folky singer isn't she
S0509	yeah
S0510	but she kind of have a different take on it a bite of a twist oh what be her name
S0509	the worst thing be listen to a cover before listen to the actual song and then the cover be better
S0509	it's happen quite a few time to me
S0510	really
S0509	oh yeah
S0510	blimey mm
S0509	mm it be a good song
S0510	yeah i'm still struggle to think who it be but i'm just gonna have to let that one go
S0510	sorry
S0509	i be think earlier when you be look erm on google i can't remember what oh you be look up the camden palace and you be like oh i've gotta check whether it's the same place
S0510	uhu
S0509	er and i think what would she be do right now if you didn't have google
S0510	i know well this be it you'd be
S0509	well it be like would
S0510	you'd be ring up a friend
S0509	as
S0510	or
S0509	i be gonna say like would you ring up the what's it call now the
S0510	the koko
S0509	koko
S0510	yeah
S0509	ring up the koko and be like do you use to be call camden palace
S0510	yeah or ring up the place
S0509	go to the local library what would
S0510	yeah yeah i know quite
S0509	and then you and then you but then it's like be it a good thing that you be it a bad thing because you remove that element of human interaction or be it a good thing because it mean like if you have to go look for that information would you bother
S0510	mm
S0509	to find it out
S0510	mm well you see the thing be
S0509	be it a good thing that you actually do
S0510	the the thing be at this point in time you're think about because you know it's quick to access er would you bother kind of thing but you've get to put it in the right context because in those days that be the only way so therefore the time factor you wouldn't really think of it as be necessarily elongate to find out because that be the way you have nothing
S0509	yeah
S0510	to kind of you know compare it to in a shorter framework whereas now we do
S0509	but do you think you would have bother to like look that up if it hadn't be like easily
S0510	well
S0509	accessible to you
S0510	yeah well yeah i i dunno mm
S0509	mm
S0510	i probably personally i probably would have try you know just ring because i use to go and just ask her if she know
S0509	yeah
S0510	cos i be curious because you know it depend on on how badly you want to know isn't it
S0509	yeah
S0510	like when i saw them in that place and i think
S0509	yeah
S0510	god that's get to be the camden palace
S0509	yeah
S0510	and bear in mind that it be a significant period of my life
S0509	yeah
S0510	where i use to go there so i be quite passionate about it
S0509	yeah
S0510	and really enjoy it so therefore i probably would
S0509	right yeah
S0510	i'm just think it through i i probably
S0509	yeah
S0510	would because i'd want
S0509	but
S0510	to know cos it hold so many great memories for me and excite time and fun time it's like
S0509	yeah
S0510	be that still be that place
S0509	yeah
S0510	still there you know
S0509	but then would you do it with other things i guess
S0510	well exactly
S0509	be the question
S0510	you'd have to yeah it would all be in context really wouldn't it as to
S0509	yeah
S0510	how significant it be
S0509	yeah
S0510	but it's an interest point though
S0510	you know and that whole thing about technology as well er about you know remove another layer of communication or interaction or
S0509	yeah
S0510	the you know you know in some ways there be many there be many good things not in some ways but there be many good things about the access to information that we have now in term of how it empower us and kind of what what greater significance or what greater level of things we're able to do
S0509	yeah
S0510	because of it but also it do bring as you know its own drawbacks as well you know
S0509	oh yeah i mean
S0510	kind of
S0509	you you could debate that for age the
S0510	well you
S0509	pros and con of technology couldn't you
S0510	absolutely absolutely
S0509	oh
S0510	and i and i think erm something that's interest for me actually be sort of when i be teach it erm and still to to this present day really be how how little sometimes people check the veracity of the not the veracity
S0509	yes
S0510	you know er be i say the right word the
S0509	yeah the veracity
S0510	of the information that they're look at
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know because so much of the stuff that you're look at be self publish i mean wikipedia be the greatest you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	kind of example of that
S0509	the primary example
S0510	and i can't tell you how many children you know and i mean and adults as well but when i be teach
S0509	yeah
S0510	just take it as read that well if it's on wiki it must be true you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	and so i think er that's a dangerous thing as well you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	that you aren't i mean l know like in history i remember primary source and you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	in research and that you i remember you come home and sort of tell me about some of the research and methods that you be use so i guess in school there be other areas where people be question that and i certainly do in it you know i'd ask
S0509	yeah
S0510	the kid to well maybe you know think about the source of information they're use for their own research for their project
S0509	yeah
S0510	and question that but i think we it's really easy to get lazy as well
S0509	yeah definitely and yeah it there be erm you know me and daddy have watch a few episodes of that david gorman's modern life be goodish
S0510	oh gosh no i didn't
S0509	it's
S0510	be it it
S0509	have you see it
S0510	no i haven't
S0509	it's if do you know what it's about
S0510	no i don't
S0510	if it's dave gormon and anything where dave gormon's
S0509	dave
S0510	gonna be good
S0509	yeah and it's it's er he just go on about all these different sort of things that be just not truthful online or just the weird things
S0510	oh really
S0509	go on online and it's really interest cos like he and and then he'll trick you as well
S0510	mm
S0509	and he'll go oh he he'll be talk he he kind of cos it's kind of comedy as well he'll be talk about
S0510	mm
S0509	oh there's all these name of celebrities where the domain name aren't take and you can just like buy them and er and like they have some really weird ones well the weird ones like so there's like this japanese punk band under some british celebrity minor celebrity's name
S0510	uhu
S0509	and then and then like everyone's laugh at it and then he go through another couple and then he go well actually none of this be true cos i've buy all these domain name and make them myself
S0509	and we're all like
S0510	oh
S0509	oh
S0510	yeah
S0509	you know you just can't
S0510	yeah right
S0509	it make you
S0510	right
S0509	kind of go i can't trust anything
S0510	ah
S0509	and he do this whole thing where he unravel an entire sort of erm media campaign where it be this this story it be like a valentine story
S0510	mm
S0509	and it be about this woman dump her boyfriend through like a you know in shop in like corner shop or garage store you get the little
S0510	yeah
S0509	advertise screen
S0510	yeah
S0509	er dump her boyfriend through one of those on valentine's day
S0510	right
S0509	and er he unravel it all and it be actually just a media campaign like a market campaign
S0510	oh
S0509	do really subtly for amstrad erm screen
S0510	you're kid
S0509	cos like he he be like look at all these article about it and like they'd all mention the price of the screen like twice
S0510	oh ah
S0509	and then he be go to the account of the person who originally tweet it and he be like a ceo of a market company and then alan sugar have tweet it
S0510	right
S0509	and it be yeah
S0510	and he manage to track it all back and
S0509	yeah
S0510	uncover its real yeah
S0509	yeah where it have come from and it be like oh yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	you just can't can't trust any of these stories
S0510	yeah yeah but we do you know it's true we we kind of all fall into that trap of
S0509	yeah
S0510	just sort of take things as read without
S0509	without look into it
S0510	question
S0509	ourself
S0510	yeah and in more and more company be get you know more and more more and more erm look at different ways via via social media via you know all these other digital mean to get their
S0509	yeah
S0510	message across
S0509	oh yeah
S0510	you know
S0509	social media market
S0510	tag or yeah
S0509	it's massive
S0510	yeah and make it you know viral in whatever way and yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	i'd love to see that programme so be it on the iplayer
S0509	er it's on the dave iplayer thing
S0510	i didn't even
S0509	iplayer
S0510	know we have the dave iplayer
S0509	we do
S0510	be that on that box that we get from talktalk
S0509	yeah
S0510	mm
S0509	it's sort of when you go to go to the iplayer there's like there's like five or six other different players and dave be one of them
S0510	oh well
S0509	the selection i need to show you how to use this thing don't i
S0510	yeah say a sixteen year old daughter to the former it teacher
S0510	it's a bite worry really
S0509	well you you know you didn't you didn't do the tv manage
S0510	what remote control
S0509	department what be i even say
S0510	what
S0509	tv management department
S0510	it's just you know
S0509	you weren't a technician
S0510	well actually i be cos that's what
S0509	what
S0510	i go on to do after teach i i be a technician wasn't i at the uni an it technician albeit in a
S0509	how do you do that
S0509	i remember when you be teach say how often you'd be go to the it guy for help
S0510	but that's always the case though in any school erm the it you know the it technicians be be critical to oh gosh i anything run because often their network be so poorly put together and patch together and there's so many different
S0509	oh
S0510	variables with student you know account and restrictions that they have on the network
S0509	yeah
S0510	that that's why you end up go to the technicians half the time because either they haven't program something properly or the user you know the the
S0509	yeah
S0510	pupil or whatever have have get something major wrong erm in term of their password or whatever so but
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah no i mean the the to be honest the it technician erm a job that i have it be a an agency job and it be very specific so i use to build erm computers
S0509	yeah i remember
S0510	yeah so it it wasn't you know you didn't need to know huge amount about configurations and all the rest of it it be
S0509	mm
S0510	one specific set of rule if you like
S0509	yeah
S0510	for set up these computers build them instal drivers erm and then you know transfer the data from
S0509	yeah
S0510	one user's computer to another and just make sure it look as it should do er and a lot of it also be to do with kind of customer interaction you know erm which be something that i've always enjoy do
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm customer service because a lot of the people that you end up do their computers for didn't have a lot of it knowledge so their start point be really low down there so
S0509	yeah
S0510	although they might have see me as some kind of it god guru
S0510	i really only have a very specific set of
S0509	yeah
S0510	information you know
S0509	that you need to know to
S0510	and and but you know to them it be all smoke and mirror you know it be kind of like wow you know this be amaze but
S0509	oh right
S0510	it be very limit but but it work and you know the the
S0509	yeah yeah it you do your job
S0510	i i do my job i get them what they want i roll out you know a hundred and twenty different machine
S0510	for this the it be all just part of this specific contract so
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah

S0509	the other one be better
S0510	yeah yeah so erm that word sagacity erm
S0509	yeah
S0510	i think well i'll look up in this dictionary cos it's sort of not quite of the period it wasn't quite a victorian dictionary but
S0509	yeah
S0510	it be sort of early nineteen hundreds
S0509	not long after
S0510	so and i couldn't find it and then the other word that i really like in the play be where say tell the gentleman if he doesn't like the effluvia of my tobacco smoke then he can jolly well whatever and i just and it be partly the way he say that
S0509	effluvia
S0510	yeah er and again it be like what do that actually mean
S0509	mm
S0510	erm and that look that up in the dictionary and i couldn't find it and i say to the director i say do you know i say i think it's
S0509	be these word just make it up
S0510	it's it's really you know
S0510	you would have think that if it they be gonna be anywhere they would be in there because
S0509	yeah
S0510	they be obviously you know topical word for the day and he be go really i say yeah and he go well i be surprise and then a horrible think strike me
S0509	yeah
S0510	do i actually know how to spell sagacity
S0510	be i actually spell it right
S0510	no i wasn't
S0510	so then i think mm yeah it do seem just too weird that both of the word aren't in there when it be
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know contemporary pretty much with the dictionary maybe i be spell sagacity wrong so how do you think i might have spell sagacity
S0509	with an s
S0510	yeah
S0509	and be it with a c
S0510	er no it's still with an s so what
S0509	be it do you do it like s e

S0509	and it's s i
S0510	er no
S0509	s a
S0510	it yeah
S0509	sagacity
S0510	and then when i find the word it be like ah there's sagacity and there's sagacious to be
S0509	oh
S0510	sagacious you see so oh wow so i felt a right silly nana
S0510	and then i though
S0509	a right silly nana
S0510	and i think right well er let's just try another derivative of of effluvia
S0509	effluvia
S0510	i can't even say it properly
S0509	effluvia
S0510	effluvia and i be spell it oh dear i i'm ashamed now i be spell it e double f
S0509	a
S0510	it be a but it be something this be my excuse anyway there be something in the way with mr say say it that make me think it be an e it's not that i'm silly or anything
S0510	erm and yes of course it be a double f so then i have to go back to the director and say ha ha ha ha
S0509	you'll never guess what
S0510	yeah

S0509	but not just one of them
