S0417	so what do you think of the equality vote
S0416	erm i think i don't really know the result
S0417	i think it's erm go to be a yes
S0416	oh erm i hope it's go to be yes cos all all my friends and stuff say it's yes say yes
S0417	do they
S0416	yes
S0417	didn't you say that some people in your school want a no
S0416	well yeah but they they seem like the unmature ones and they haven't really they're not very smart
S0417	do you think they're a bite homophobic
S0416	i don't know just don't think they're clever enough to to know that just cos you're gay doesn't mean you're not an actual person it just mean you're gay
S0417	be they what be they against people be gay or people have kid if they be gay
S0416	people people be gay they just say just cos it's wrong they have no real valid point they just it's just eh their take on it erm i hope that when they get older they have a different view on it
S0417	yeah how many boys do you think be be like that
S0416	out of my whole year
S0417	mm hm
S0416	thirty thirty forty
S0417	really who be against it
S0416	there's about fifty that be not against it
S0417	so thirty be against it that's quite a lot
S0416	mm hm
S0417	what would you have vote for
S0416	i would have vote yes if i could have
S0417	yeah
S0416	cos i think gays should have the same right to marry as anyone else
S0417	yeah
S0416	cos marry can be a really good thing for someone
S0417	yeah why do you think marriage would be a good thing for the people
S0416	erm it's kind of like it's kind of like you you share a bond with each other and you really like love each other and you give yourself to each other and all that
S0417	and why would that be different than them just be boyfriend or girlfriend or
S0416	erm i think because boyfriend or girlfriend be kind of easier to just break up i think with marry you really be sure that you're never go to break up and you really you just love each other that much that you'd want to spend the rest of your life with them
S0417	it's something to do with commitment then
S0416	yeah
S0417	would you get marry
S0416	yeah
S0417	really
S0416	yeah i don't think i'd do it in like a religious place though unless they be religious
S0417	yeah where would you get marry
S0416	i don't know a beach beach sound like the best place if it's not go to be a church
S0417	when do you think's a good age do you think to be marry
S0416	i don't know thirty thirty something if not then like forty
S0417	forty thirty
S0416	yeah
S0417	and you have do you ever want to have kid
S0416	sorry
S0417	want to have kid
S0416	probably cos well a lot of what i've hear from a lot of people be their kid be like their favourite thing in their whole life like that's pretty cool
S0417	yeah that's pretty cool isn't it
S0416	yeah
S0417	well you're a pretty favourite part of my life you know it might even be above ice cream but i don't know it depend
S0416	maybe
S0417	yeah i would like to be marry one day what kind of erm what do you think do you think you'd need to be have a good job and have a good house and things before you're marry
S0416	erm i think i think you'd need to have a stable life before you're marry you don't i don't think you necessarily have to have a good job or a good house you can just have i it doesn't really matter i think as long as you be commit to your partner then that's what marriage be about and not about a good house or a good good like not about have a rich house or anything just about commitment and just love each other
S0417	do you think they might need stability though
S0416	i think stability would be a very a very big factor in it i think it'd be hard to marry if you didn't but i don't think iid let anything stop marriage
S0417	i've a lot of people get marry and then they're they want kid so they want to bring up kid in a stable way don't they
S0416	yeah
S0417	they're not kid about the same time
S0416	yeah but i don't think that should stop you from have kid cos if like
S0417	you've get to be able to afford to have them pay for them
S0416	yeah that's true
S0417	they need somewhere to live and enough food
S0416	yeah as long as you've get enough food then i think it's fine i don't think there should be any law or what or whatever to just to say you can't have kid or marry and that be the situation cos if that bring happiness to your life
S0417	yeah but do you i think sometimes it's selfish though to just have kid when you can't afford to house them or pay for them
S0416	yeah but obviously so you can pay for them and house them
S0417	yeah
S0416	but
S0417	cos you've get to cos you can't just be ask other people even that even if that mean through the government other people
S0416	yeah i know i know
S0417	it's not very fair
S0416	i know
S0417	how many how many kid would you want
S0416	two that would be good preferably a girl and a boy
S0417	yeah what would you what would you teach the boy and the girl do you think
S0416	to be to be kind to others and stuff and you do what do what you want and then you know like have a good life
S0417	would you have any rule
S0416	yeah
S0417	what kind of rule would you have
S0416	obviously like bedtime and stuff that you can't be go to bed at one o' clock in the morning and stuff
S0417	what other kinds of rule
S0416	well feel like there's millions of rule but i don't think i could go through all of them
S0417	what about what would you do if they be be mean to other people at school
S0416	erm if they be be mean to someone else at school i don't know i think i i'd punish them in some way
S0417	how would you punish them
S0416	i'd punish them for two days by no one day by erm one day by maybe not let them either do their favourite sport or their favourite game but then but then after that's like expire i'd talk to them and i'd talk to them about it and make them understand why you shouldn't be mean cos otherwise it can hurt them and then like you should also treat other people like how you'd like to be treat
S0417	what if they just say rubbish and didn't ignore you
S0416	erm if they do that then i don't know what i'd do i don't think i can just make my mind up what i'd do right now i'm not even an adult yet
S0417	no do it feel like a long time ago then when you be a child yourself
S0417	or do it feel like yesterday
S0416	i be a child
S0417	yeah but like oh okay when you be like younger toddler and things do that feel like long long time ago
S0416	yeah that feel a long time ago
S0417	can you remember much about it
S0416	no
S0417	no you don't remember go to the park and the graveyard
S0416	no
S0417	no
S0416	no
S0417	erm do you remember your room with a big leaf on top of your bed
S0416	yeah i remember that
S0417	well that be before you be four
S0416	that's i
S0417	be there any favourite memories that be your first memories
S0416	mm yeah i remember go to disneyland for the first time that be probably one of them eh that be probably one of my earliest favourite memories try to think i don't know i can't think of anything earlier maybe if you remind me of something earlier
S0417	erm do you remember go to nursery school
S0416	yeah i remember someone push me off the slide and then i have to go to hospital
S0417	yeah
S0416	but that's all i remember
S0417	yeah that wasn't very
S0416	and then i remember go into like the sleep room and it'd be all dark and then you'd go to sleep
S0417	do you remember play in the garden there
S0416	no
S0417	do you remember sit round and have your beaker of juice and your sandwich for lunch
S0416	no
S0417	and do you remember you have some mat there do you remember you have a birthday party and we go to a playground and and you have a pirate pirate ship
S0416	mm yeah i remember that i i don't actually remember that i remember photos i remember photos
S0417	yeah
S0416	i don't remember it then
S0417	yeah that be quite fun so do you think do you think all society should be equal everyone should be able to marry whoever they like
S0416	yes well as long as both of the people want to marry
S0417	your top's inside out
S0416	indeed
S0417	we'll have to change it
S0416	not right now
S0417	no not right now so what be you look forward to this summer
S0416	swim a lot i'm go to
S0417	mm hm
S0416	with my best friend and there's also a lake rent out get a lake rent out that no one use which my dad's girlfriend rent out and it's like a lake and there's dive board into the lake and you can like that'll be really fun
S0417	yeah
S0416	i don't know what else we're do there but i imagine it'll be fun
S0417	and you're still go to
S0416	yes i be i'm look forward to that as well see see all the nice things
S0417	you're lucky you've get load of holiday
S0416	yeah i think we might go to something else as well if we have time
S0417	mm
S0416	so i'm look forward to that
S0417	yeah
S0416	also look forward to camp camp i'm look forward to go over to my friend's house for a sleepover and
S0417	when's that
S0416	that be somewhere somewhere after the exams not sure of the date exactly
S0417	whose friend's house
S0416	erm and 's
S0416	yeah iid say that's it
S0417	and do you know any more about the birthday party
S0416	erm
S0417	with
S0416	eh no well you say i can't go
S0417	i say i you can't you can't be kind of unsupervised but where you have to let me know a bite more about it
S0416	erm it's just like you just go there then you go up to the cinema and you come out of the cinema then you go home
S0417	cos if it's just the cinema that's okay or if you have a bite to eat or something
S0416	i'm pretty i'm pretty sure that's what they're do they're like before go to the cinema or after they're like go to like starbucks or something which be in the in the place and just get a drink and then go to the cinema come back and then there something
S0417	yeah i'm sure you could do some of that so just just keep me up to date
S0416	yeah but that that that would be unsupervised
S0417	well i'm sure some of it could be unsupervised i'm just not happy about you wander around beforehand and afterwards like unsupervised
S0416	so so be you okay with this be you be you okay with this
S0417	mm hm
S0416	i i go into and then 's there and everything and everyone's there and we go to get like i don't know what let's just say let's just say we go to get something to eat and drink before the cinema we go we go somewhere erm all together we get something we eat it and then we go to the cinema then we watch the cinema then we go out the cinema then i wait to be collect
S0417	yeah but what i'd probably do be say hang around the shop centre while you're have something to eat before you go into the cinema so that i'm around there
S0416	okay
S0417	i'm not necessarily sit down with you the whole time but just when you go in and then to the to the cinema afterwards and then pick you up after the cinema that's probably okay i imagine
S0416	so you're say you'll walk around in the shop centre
S0417	well we'll see but yeah something like that yeah
S0416	will all of my friends know you're there
S0417	yeah well so what if that's your choice
S0416	but
S0417	if erm if that if
S0416	we we also need to bring money for the cinema and popcorn and things and the bite to eat before
S0417	yeah but you have to do you have to get time for me next week don't you
S0416	june six
S0417	i know but like time
S0416	oh okay
S0417	that kind of thing have you have any more thoughts about what you might like to do for your birthday
S0416	no
S0417	no
S0416	no everything i think would be go over to 's house and have a have a sleepover or something but you say that's my birthday so i can't do that
S0417	you're have a sleepover anyway somebody else's
S0417	you're have a sleepover anyway
S0416	it's just
S0417	it's just what
S0416	nothing
S0417	if it's like one of your mat say can i have a birthday over here sleepover over here and he have his birthday over here it's just not really very polite
S0416	no
S0417	give something else you like to do
S0416	it doesn't it doesn't need to be my birthday over there it doesn't need to be all about anyone there it's just i just want to do something that i like and that would be go round my friend's house doesn't need to be for my birthday it's just that's what i would like to do and it doesn't i don't i don't have to celebrate my birthday there
S0417	you're you've be at well i'd have i've say i would let you have a sleepover so isn't that the same thing
S0416	okay so i can
S0417	you can have a sleepover at somebody's house
S0416	okay so not two
S0417	hm
S0416	so not two sleepovers during the summer
S0417	well why don't people come around here
S0416	because 's asleep 's asleep and it's really really kind of bad to have a sleepover here
S0417	why be it bad
S0416	because it's just can't be as loud cos 's asleep and like you have the tv you have the tv for most of the even so then we couldn't use the tv and we'd all just be up in my room with not much space and they'd all have like sleep bag and be all cramp up in my room so that'd be really but if i go to my friend's house we could like bring sleep bag and sleep in their live room we could go on the xbox we could be as loud as you want
S0417	i see but something else you might like to do do you think there might be something at erm like a laser thing or something i think i don't know whether people might have to pay
S0416	it's just you say you say that erm can't do anything that involve money
S0417	haven't get much money no i mean it'd be like the cinema like you're you're pay for your own cinema aren't you with
S0416	yeah
S0417	so maybe if if everybody pay for their own or something i don't know we could just find out couldn't we
S0416	yeah i'd like to go paintballing
S0417	not paintballing you're too young to do that anyway and it's too like that would mean drive a long way and
S0416	mm
S0417	it's a hard life isn't it
S0416	no no that cost way too much anyway
S0417	think about it must do something okay
S0416	can't really think of anything i'd like to do
S0417	aw i don't know what about
S0416	i can think of tons of things that i'd love to do but can't do
S0417	could always have another cinema date at a different film
S0416	yeah
S0417	for your birthday a second time meet up
S0416	yeah
S0417	erm well you could yeah find out if there's anything at
S0416	mm
S0417	that's like suitable cos i think they've a roller skate thing as well
S0416	i don't like roller skate i'd like to either go go karting laser tag or go to the cinema
S0417	don't they have a laser tag at
S0416	they do
S0417	that might be something different if you're go to the cinema one time and if you're have a sleepover another time maybe be cool if you want to go laser tag another time
S0416	okay i'll go laser tag
S0417	just find out and see ask your mat if it would be okay for them to pay and then just
S0416	i don't know how much laser tag be i need to find that out
S0417	mm yeah might not be too bad could ask the girls if they want to go as well
S0416	don't they'd come
S0417	could ask them
S0416	do ask they won't come
S0417	they might like laser tag might be up for it might be up for it
S0416	i bet you ten euro 's not up for it
S0417	well what about
S0416	erm i bet three euro 's not up for it
S0417	aw there's no harm try though be there maybe your mum would be up for it hm
S0416	no
S0417	i've play it before
S0416	yeah but
S0417	would i would i cramp your style
S0416	mm yeah
S0417	you just go round go
S0416	it would it it would be really weird
S0417	like that
S0416	that would really be embarrass
S0417	really what have your own dear mother there would be embarrass
S0416	yes yes
S0417	how so
S0416	yes
S0417	i wouldn't be embarrass if you come to my birthday
S0416	yeah that's because it's it's like you have your birthday with all like vintage things and me go oh yes oh yes vintage shoe something like that it doesn't work we and then all my friends would make fun of me
S0417	tell them i'd beat them up if they make fun of you
S0416	they would beat me up if that happen
S0417	no they wouldn't because they'd be so scar of me
S0416	no
S0417	they'd be like oh my god get to keep on the good side of that one because like she's go to come down on us like a ton of bricks what if i'll beat them all if i beat you all at laser tag then they won't make fun of me
S0416	you won't beat anyone
S0417	you have so little faith in me
S0416	i know that's cos you hate gun you hate kill you hate everything to do with gun and kill and laser tag be gun and kill but without paintballs and lasers
S0417	well to be fair i don't think anybody die
S0416	no nobody die in paintballing either
S0417	yeah but maybe we better check on that
S0416	paintball be just okay laser tag and paintball be just black ops irl tone down the kill and violence laser tag be level one paintball be level two
S0417	actual kill be level three be it
S0416	yeah it's war
S0417	i see so i'm not sure about
S0416	paintballing be probably the the best one to do cos that's the most cool thing cos you don't kill each other and you just can go through the woods and there'll be like a tank that'll fire like massive paintballs at you
S0417	then there's then there's war would you like to go to war
S0416	no i'm not stupid you get nothing out of war there be people in my class that think they should go to war but they're they're they're as dumb as bricks
S0417	dumb as bricks
S0416	bricks aren't smart
S0417	any of them them your friends
S0416	no not really
S0417	so what like some of the people in your class do they really get on your nerve
S0416	yeah
S0417	who really get on your nerve
S0416	one guy he leave the school but he do get on my own nerve cos he be just so he always use to lie and he be just anything that all the cool people use to say he use to copy and try and be like them like lie like say he get detention even though he didn't and then punch me and try get in fight with me
S0417	well that's not very nice do you tell him his mum beat him
S0416	stop
S0417	what's the matter
S0416	it's like no
S0417	be it embarrass be i embarrass you where's the fun of be a parent if you can't embarrass your kid spend so long bring you up and give you all this stuff and it's all quite hard work so you might as well get a bite of enjoyment out of it
S0416	you you get you get upset when i accidentally embarrass you i didn't mean to
S0417	no that be different that be actually kind of put me down i mean i'm tease you by say i'm go to beat your friends to stick up for you it's different
S0416	yeah but how do you know i won't get the same feel you do
S0417	i'm not do the same as you do
S0416	yeah i didn't even mean it i didn't even know what i be do so you might not
S0417	but put on my voice and complain that i be erm funny with you about the computer and just be really kind of that's not that wasn't very nice that be quite mean doesn't doesn't mean you mean to be mean i understand that you didn't mean to be mean but you be mean
S0416	and you might not mean to be mean and like cos i might get the same feel when all my friends be make fun of me it's not a good feel maybe it's a good feel for you maybe
S0417	how be i make fun of you by say i be go to beat your friends
S0416	it's not make fun of me it's just my friends be make fun of me cos of that
S0417	but i'm tell you i'm not say it in front of you and your friends that's different i'm tell you here
S0416	it's just my friends that would be a thing that my mum with me and my friends i'd like
S0416	make fun of me
S0417	i'm not go to go it's okay
S0416	okay okay
S0417	i be have with you
S0416	that wasn't fun find it fun it's just very cliché and kind of hear it all before so no offence but
S0417	i see
S0416	it's not like it be unexpected
S0417	i see
S0416	it's kind of not really humorous in my opinion sorry
S0417	you tell me your mum's not funny
S0416	i'm just share my opinion
S0416	okay then you be
S0417	be i funny
S0416	yeah
S0417	be i really humorous
S0416	yeah
S0417	should i be on stage
S0416	yeah
S0417	be i like the best mum ever
S0416	yeah
S0417	in the whole universe if i act a breakdance in front of you and your mat you'd just be wow
S0416	you'd trip over your leg
S0417	even if i trip over my leg
S0416	no
S0417	i see if i trip over my leg what would happen
S0416	i'd go up to my room and just play on my laptop well first i'd help help you up go up to my room try forget it
S0417	put your head in your hand and cry
S0416	no wouldn't cry for that no reason to
S0417	i see
S0416	i'd be a bite annoy
S0417	would you why
S0416	cos if my friends be there then they would make fun of me i'd feel quite sad that would make me sad
S0417	so you'd succumb to the rule of the mob peer pressure
S0416	you're think from like a media or tv show erm level cos like as always and they always embarrass the teenager or boy and they go oh and all their friends make fun of them and they're just like er and then you don't really feel sorry for them cos they're tv character but i'm a real person and i would actually feel really sad
S0417	you're a real person
S0416	yeah that's not my point it like be i would actually feel really sad you'd probably feel happy cos she'd be like the mum on the tv the funny mum that you'd laugh at but i'd actually be kind of sad cos things aren't like tv in real life
S0417	i don't want you to be sad son
S0416	then don't do it
S0417	i won't do it
S0416	okay cool thank you
S0417	so shall we stop
