S0018	drop off
S0018	so how long do it take you to learn how to drive and be confident know that what you be do be come automatically and
S0170	mm before i pass my test i take nineteen lessons
S0018	nineteen
S0170	but
S0018	but do you have practice at
S0170	but that be because i fail four
S0018	no you see i'm think of have at least twenty but i don't think i'm gonna get any practice outside of the lessons that's why um
S0170	mm
S0018	do you
S0170	yeah my my dad um take me to wales
S0018	ah
S0170	so that be quite quite good
S0018	what you drive

S0170	he be teach me to drive i mean we didn't go out very often to be honest just before my second test cos i be a bite sick and tire of fail
S0018	how many time do you take your test
S0170	five but i pass on the fifth time because i get so nervous
S0018	mm
S0170	on my test i mean one um examiner tell me okay we're gonna stop the car please relax i be like this my leg because i fail the first one
S0018	mm
S0170	the next one be you know you get more nervous
S0018	you feel the pressure's on and
S0170	yeah and then each one then become okay i've get to pass this time i've get to pass this and my drive instructor say after the you know first one what happen you know you you you should have pass and then you start say well we'll just have a lesson before each test now after which it's we'll just have one lesson before and try and get some practice because i'm i'm waste your money
S0018	but do you feel quite confident when you be actually drive without the
S0170	yeah
S0018	in the lesson and stuff
S0170	mhm
S0018	really
S0170	i'm the same with exams and that
S0018	mm

S0170	i like things like that i like things that be a bite um tart
S0018	mhm

S0170	and then i just yep i drive i be drive on the roads but i wouldn't go on the motorway without a lesson
S0170	so he take me
S0018	that's a good idea and do you feel quite confident quite quickly
S0170	yeah i felt confident before i even pass because i know that i could drive
S0018	mhm
S0170	and my drive instructor be really nice he be sort of say you can drive do not come back to me this time and tell me you've fail again
S0018	oh no i think that's one thing i've maybe get go in my favour be older and learn to drive be that you know i don't get so stress in in test and stuff now i can
S0170	mm
S0018	control my nerve a lot better but
S0170	i still do for interview
S0018	mm
S0170	that's one thing i hate because you're sell yourself aren't you really
S0018	mm
S0170	you've really gotta and then if you don't get it it's such a it's a personal thing mm i take it as just like oh why didn't i
S0018	i know what you mean and it feel like such a waste of time because it take so long to prepare for an interview and
S0170	mm
S0018	write the application form and
S0170	especially for a good job
S0018	hm i don't know do they still exist
S0170	if i'm be like honest i want something you know over twenty really i don't want to go for something that's less than that
S0018	definitely
S0170	if i'm go back full time and pay for nursery fee
S0018	yeah
S0170	i don't i don't want less and i want to you know have some have some money and
S0018	be you still think about do a pgce primary
S0170	at the moment no
S0018	hm
S0170	no
S0018	he's too little
S0170	yeah and i'm not sure if i want to work with little kid to be honest
S0018	why don't you get a job um as a teach assistant and help you make up your mind
S0170	it'd be good but um it's like about fifteen thousand
S0018	i've see some that pay up to eighteen
S0170	have you
S0018	mm yep and you get all the holiday
S0170	mm
S0018	and you don't have to plan or anything
S0170	this be true that would be good if i could get something for about you know about eighteen
S0018	mhm
S0170	that'd be great
S0018	yeah but i know what you mean i think i mean cos i'm i've only get one salary come in although not at the moment um i be just think that it it's under twenty five it's not a live wage
S0170	it's not really
S0018	you can't afford to to live pay rent let alone save for a mortgage on anything below that
S0170	yeah exactly and we have have i mean you've get more experience than me but we have have you know they're not it's not a job teach english be not a job that you just go in into work and just do it's i think it and it give you a lot of good er life experience as well with people how to deal with people how to manage situations cos you know i've have racism in the classroom
S0018	mm
S0170	i've have sexism in the classroom especially with some of the people from from um usually from iraq or iran can be very racist
S0018	really
S0170	i have one iranian guy do not sit me next to that nigger
S0018	oh no
S0170	mm and i be like excuse me he say i have people like that clean my house back in my country so what do i do
S0018	sit him next to it
S0170	between the two
S0018	ah
S0170	guy from africa
S0018	how do he cope
S0170	he didn't say anything cos i say if you say anything else like that again you're not gonna be on this course
S0018	do he get on with them
S0170	yeah he be fine after that he expect me to agree with him and when he saw my reaction be like of horror rather than oh yeah you're right you know
S0018	i be surprise how racist the chinese students be against indian people
S0170	oh yeah
S0018	i mean really really surprise
S0170	yeah and i find if the chinese girl be to have a a black boyfriend they would be you know ashamed the family be very
S0018	what a shame yeah like no i think you're right i mean er the teach it's a lot of different skills that you're pull together all the time
S0170	mhm
S0018	and even like things like project management i mean there's no actual project involve per se but you're still manage like every class be a project to be manage like
S0170	definitely
S0018	over the course of the of the the academic year or how long the course run for
S0170	mm you can communicate with people from all walk of life um and bring them together cos there can be conflict in the classroom between certain individuals and you have to try and sort it out
S0018	mm yeah
S0170	i have one class of they be all they be all muslim men but they be from different countries but with one christian guy who be from eritrea
S0018	uh huh oh i never know how to pronounce that
S0170	and um
S0018	i've only ever see it write down
S0170	well i think yeah eritrea they er i think that's how you say it and um anyway this eritrean guy be um say that he wasn't gonna get marry just yet and he be twenty four twenty five and the other the other guy be all no there be two somali guy who be say to him you must get marry now you must get marry now and um he's like well no i haven't get a job now and i don't want to get marry until i can provide for my family and the one somali guy be say to him no you must get marry it doesn't matter in this country you don't need to have a job you don't need to worry about that um allah will provide
S0170	and it really it just start into a big argument between everyone in the class because
S0018	do it generate a lot of english though
S0170	it do yeah
S0018	perfect
S0170	no it be great i mean that class they cos they be all from different countries there be two guy from the same country and they be both somalian
S0018	mhm
S0170	but the other guy be like eritrean iranian guy from yemen um iranian guy yeah there be all different countries and an iraqi guy so they have to speak english together i think some of them speak arabic they you know not everyone
S0018	mhm
S0170	so
S0018	that be their only common language that's good
S0170	but it it all men together be just such hard work
S0018	i can imagine
S0170	like cos the the summer school and i be like think after the first week oh my goodness maybe would have be better if they'd have a a male teacher but no they be alright about that except for one guy who be a bite disrespectful to me quite often actually
S0018	really
S0170	the other guy be like no don't do that
S0018	oh good yeah sometimes it's it's less contentious to just let them sort it out themselves i have um a class of nineteen year olds one of which be er very very very heavily into the opus dei church in spain which
S0170	oh right yeah
S0018	be very religious catholic order i think and her family she have about seven brothers and sisters cos they believe in have numerous er children cos that give better better gift to god or something i don't know
S0018	and they be all go on a march in madrid that weekend
S0170	mhm
S0018	against gay marriage because gay marriage be just about to be legalize in spain
S0170	mhm
S0018	and there be a a girl in class who be a lesbian and quite openly so and she come to class with three of her friends from school so it be like to her it be
S0170	yeah
S0018	you know a really open issue she be really you know very happy talk about it or what not but because she'd hear that um this other girl's family be go to the er the march she just um unsigned herself from the class she she stop come and the first day that she didn't come they have a huge argument about how
S0170	the class do
S0018	yeah
S0170	yeah
S0018	like her three friends against this girl the opus dei girl and the worst thing about it be that she'd just be indoctrinate she'd just be brainwash
S0170	mm
S0018	into have this opinion a really intelligent girl without have any logical logic whatsoever behind her arguments and these three girls just pick her apart totally and i i kind of felt i have to mediate in a way to make sure that she didn't feel that she be be pick on because there be more people that be completely against her opinion than share it
S0170	yeah
S0018	but i just take a bite of a backseat and just let them debate it because i i think it be important for this opus dei girl to realize that her beliefs be unfounded
S0170	yeah
S0018	and that you know kind of a jury of her peer be lead her to realize
S0018	that her beliefs be unfounded and that maybe she should apply a bite of logic and not
S0170	mhm
S0018	just blindly follow something that someone else be tell her to do
S0170	it's it's so a shame like especially people who be from countries that um like in somalia they're they be mainly muslim but a lot of them have never read the quran and they believe what they're tell by their imams because the imam know well they believe that he's know the quran and he's read it so they just follow what he say without ever have read it without ever
S0018	right so it's
S0170	like a dog
S0018	his interpretation
S0170	be a dirty animal that you can't have a dog and some of the things they believe one student adamantly believe that if he write in the quran and close it when he open on the same page it would be go
S0170	and he would be damn because it's you know it's the quran and you should never do it anyway but i say but how okay why don't you try it and see and he say well no no no no i could never do that because you know if if i do i'll die sort of thing and he really really
S0018	didn't you offer to try yourself well i can do it don't worry
S0170	i be tempt to but i think no i'm gonna get in trouble if i take it too far but what some people have be lead to believe be amaze cos they've just be tell it their whole live
S0018	and how they don't then question it when they you know er develop rational think process
S0170	yeah but you're teach people to learn to read for the first time who've never learn in their own language
S0018	i just wonder whether there might be too many brightness come through for him
S0170	to keep him to make him sleep
S0018	no whether it be er disturb him he seem to like it
S0170	he like things over his face he play a little bite like wuh
S0018	shall i leave it there
S0170	i don't yeah i think he's alright actually
S0018	shall i uncover his mouth a bite though it's a bite worry whoop peek a boo
S0018	yeah but also set up the situation in which there can be dialogue between people who've get different opinions
S0170	yeah and this be like a very transferable skill as my sister say i be like
S0018	yeah it's true
S0170	my she's very good at this um interview talk
S0018	uh huh
S0170	especially in bank and that they have to you
S0018	mm
S0170	have to know all the er lingo
S0018	mhm hm
S0170	you know like all these transferable skills and
S0018	i suppose all the stakeholders as much as possible la la la la la
S0170	i'm actually gonna help her have a go at my oh i might do it

S0018	sleepy sleepy hm so welcome to my new smartphone
S0170	samsung they're suppose to be good
S0018	yeah
S0170	mhm
S0018	well this be the cheapest one on the market um it take me about half an hour to work out how to turn it on
S0170	and the thing be the the batteries go so quickly in it these ones these phone that do everything
S0018	they do
S0170	you have to recharge
S0018	mm
S0170	them like every day where i use to like couple of days you could use it without charge it
S0018	well my other phone you know this one
S0170	mm
S0018	my brick from the nineteen seventies i'd like charge it up once a week
S0018	cos i'd only ever use it for text message and receive some call but yeah this one's all sing all dance want to be juiced every night
S0170	but those be better than the iphones i've hear a lot of bad things about iphones to be honest
S0018	i can't get with the whole i phenomenon
S0170	mm
S0018	it i have itunes i have a little ipod nano and the interface of the program that you have to work through to get any songs onto your ipod
S0170	mm
S0018	be just so it just wasn't logical
S0018	and it really annoy me that you couldn't just use it as a like a hard disk external disk drive
S0170	yeah
S0018	and just you know copy and paste over digital music track
S0170	mm
S0018	cos i have to um convert all of the mp3 file
S0170	oh yeah
S0018	into
S0170	yeah things like that drive me insane
S0018	but i've hear that the iphone be similar that you anything that you've need to put on it it have to go through particular channel
S0170	it have to be like from apple doesn't it more or less and a way for them to make more money
S0018	hm
S0170	cos unless you get it from the apple store or whatever then like you say you have to convert the things and do you have to pay to do you if you put it through this process do it cost you to do it or
S0018	i don't know i don't think so but
S0170	hm
S0018	it cost you in time
S0170	yeah when i buy mine and the guy i say oh you know like apps and that how do i put these i've hear that you put like different apps on your phone he say you have to go to the yours be an android phone i'm like right
S0170	who the hell be this guy
S0018	i will exterminate
S0018	i be an android phone
S0170	and you have to go to the android market and i be just what
S0170	what's an android market where's the android market
S0018	be you picture the with everybody walk round with little
S0170	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0018	little green men
S0170	oh so okay i pretend i i understand what he be talk about then i'm like go home what's the android market what do it do
S0170	be it a shop you have to go to
S0018	they do like use all these er outer space reference
S0170	mm
S0018	for telephone don't they
S0170	yours be android isn't it
S0018	yeah and he
S0170	all of
S0018	he
S0170	all of them be
S0018	he offer me a choice between android and symbian and i have no idea what he be talk about
S0170	i hadn't hear symbian what's that
S0018	i think it's just a different operate system
S0170	oh
S0018	i think nokia phone work a lot with it
S0170	mm
S0018	but um i have no idea pff no idea i mean i couldn't even work out how to turn it on so but no they're quite cunning apart from have to charge them up every every night
S0170	mm
S0018	oh look the android the android market
S0170	yay
S0018	but then again i can you know i've get all these fancy function but to find really what i would say be basic stuff like alarm clock
S0170	mm
S0018	er call log see who you've your miss call be from they're just not obvious at all
S0170	oh i've get the call log from when i first have the phone and i don't know how to you know can delete in sometimes i don't know how to delete that i've get save message i don't know how to mm you know when you've write a message but you've not have time to send it so it's
S0018	mm
S0170	save as draft but can i find my draft message i have no idea where they be it's they're in their phone somewhere but
S0018	what kind of phone be yours
S0170	it's a htc it's on my over there
S0018	who have you contract who have you
S0170	oh orange
S0018	yeah i've get orange too
S0170	yeah um but it's just really funny because it say save this draft i be like well that's it then it's go
S0018	it's save somewhere
S0170	yeah
S0018	i can't work out how to stop a call because when i'm speak to someone on the phone
S0170	mm

S0018	the call
S0170	the screen but it mean the other person probably finish it already haven't they
S0018	i don't know but like

S0170	if you just touch the screen
S0018	then
S0170	and then it should come up like
S0018	really
S0170	and
S0018	aha it's obviously too smart for me
S0170	two minutes and he's go
S0018	aw
S0170	i know he would but i be really desperate
S0018	oh
S0170	determine not desperate determine that no i'm not go to do it but it's just so easy
S0170	to do it like that but sometimes it's just make life easier
S0018	i can imagine oh well it make for a less stress happy mummy
S0170	mm
S0018	that's probably important
S0170	mm yeah
S0018	be there something in breast milk that's like a
S0170	apparently when you breastfeed you release hormones that er make it easier for you to fall back to fall asleep
S0018	oh right
S0170	i don't know if that's pass on to him
S0018	aha
S0170	but for him it um breastfeed be just very relax for him and make him feel safe
S0018	mm
S0170	so he feel safe to be able to fall asleep
S0018	mhm
S0170	and um it lower the heartbeat it um and when they're stress destress him
S0018	mhm
S0170	so it's a wonderful thing
S0170	but i think bottle er do the same if they're use to bottle feed that make them feel because they're with you and next to you and you're hold them and feed them
S0018	mm
S0170	they get the same feel
S0018	mm
S0170	but then they can use a dummy cos if they usually only take a bottle they'll usually take a dummy
S0018	yeah
S0170	so
S0018	and he's out like a light
S0170	yeah
S0170	and as heavy as
S0018	really
S0170	actually i need to weigh him to find out er you can book to go to baby clinic and you book when you've when you feel like it if you want to know if he's grow okay you can book like every week but they probably wouldn't wouldn't be too happy if you go every week but you can book when you want
S0018	mhm
S0170	so if you're worry like maybe i'm not make enough breast milk and i think he's not put on weight
S0018	mhm
S0170	so you can just go they'll check and make they chart the growth
S0018	mhm
S0170	and he'll on the larger side
S0018	aw be his dad quite
S0170	mm he's quite chunky i suppose yeah yeah not that
S0018	cos you be huge when you be pregnant weren't you
S0170	now i know why
S0018	er i wish i'd marry a smaller man
S0170	cos i'd say usually like the baby be doesn't usually get um even if you're a smaller person then usually the baby won't grow above a certain weight cos it's you know it's
S0018	mhm
S0170	too to be able to to come out but he wouldn't have be able to er the surgeon be say who do the caesarean say he wasn't come out by himself
S0018	the door's not big enough
S0170	mm
S0170	maybe i'll have a nice little girl next
S0018	yeah little please
S0170	just like her mum
S0018	make her little ah that would be nice have a girl and a boy
S0170	yeah that'd be nice

S0170	yeah
S0018	banter
S0170	yeah

S0170	do you think you would be close closer emotionally if he live closer or you just think

S0018	probably we'd probably see each other more mm but we don't tolerate each other as much as i do my friends for example

S0018	er that's the thing i think i probably wouldn't be friends with my brother if
S0170	he wasn't
S0018	he wasn't my brother
S0170	i wouldn't be friends with my brother if he wasn't my brother
S0018	we're completely different um and our relationship with our parent as well i think i'm a lot more respectful as my of my parent as individuals
