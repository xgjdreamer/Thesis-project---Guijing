S0189	be it
S0192	nothing like it
S0189	really
S0192	it's quite you would really like this there's a good few well i'm not say you would really like it but there's a good few stories in here set in japan basically it's very short stories like i mean let's go through from the begin this first one greater chongking in chongqing in china so it's like really short stories for each person so like ten to twelve page next one lhasa in tibet it's like different people around the world find out what happen there
S0189	how do they make a film out of it and call it world war z
S0192	what's this in meteora greece quite a few of the cool stories be in erm japan this one guy like get stick in his complex and have to shimmy on the wall and like out the windows and stuff to like get out of the build and like zombies everywhere it be really disappoint see the film because this book's really quite good

S0192	have nothing to do with it whatsoever
S0189	it's just action
S0189	yeah it really be just shove zombie down your face
S0192	dad like it
S0189	i don't think he like it that much like when i i watch it with him
S0192	do you
S0189	and like i have i be pretty much just texting the whole time it didn't capture my interest
S0189	it's pretty bad
S0192	it's pretty poor yeah i want him to read this though cos this be genuinely a good book there's one like they miss out load of bits that be in this the the zombies in this water doesn't stop them they try like live on islands or like be out on boat and stuff but the zombies just sink and they walk along the seabed and then eventually they find like a chain with an anchor and they start pull themselves out so like they start like climb on boat and stuff
S0189	oh shit
S0192	it's worth read don't let the film put you off
S0189	this be like a massive game it's like a a multiplayer but it's shoot so like role play shoot em up
S0192	i wonder if i can put this like that that's alright as well

S0189	there we go alright so i'll go and do some fight i'm currently here
S0192	so where be we now
S0189	i'm there
S0192	oh
S0189	so i'll go up here think someone's try to take that or maybe i'll go and fight them
S0192	yeah
S0189	that's probably more interest than fight them cos it's like a waypoint area which be now
S0192	over there
S0189	no here should be there we be but it's like a challenge to try and go under the tree it's impossible
S0192	very misty this map
S0189	yeah ah
S0192	oh you're do pretty good i'd have definitely crash by now can you do it by go over the tree
S0189	yeah i could but where's the fun in that

S0192	suppose you get part of it there
S0189	yeah so it should be fine go down here
S0192	how good's the sniper on this thing
S0189	pretty good well i've get like a basic oh shit basic sniper rifle it's like
