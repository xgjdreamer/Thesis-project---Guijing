S0518	well i be with all my friends
S0517	yeah
S0518	and they're obviously wonder
S0517	he must have he he's go to the trouble to
S0518	i mean it's quite brave isn't it
S0517	it be he's go to the trouble to find out where you're do it and when he know it's the pub he's ring them up find out when they're on
S0518	i don't no i don't know about that
S0517	i do absolutely
S0518	i haven't i didn't ask him i didn't
S0517	absolutely
S0518	ask him i didn't even ask him i didn't even say what be you do here because i'd just when go i just look at him and he say erm i'm don't worry i'm go in a minute
S0517	and do he go
S0518	yeah so he drink his beer really quickly and he say erm how have you get on tonight and i say well i've cast it i say much older than i want to but i say they're all good actresses i've just probably just have to change the the kind of emphasis on the story a bite so erm he say oh when er that couple leave they say see you tuesday be that when the rehearsals start then so i say oh no rest for the wicked but rehearsals on tuesday be aren't they're somewhere else so
S0517	oh okay yeah don't let on where
S0518	somewhere else he doesn't know where they be so and the rehearsals on thursday be somewhere else as well so erm
S0517	so just go back to what you be say the other day do you actually tell him you weren't interest romantically or be you interest romantically
S0518	no i'm not
S0517	okay
S0517	i just want to confirm that with you
S0518	just to make that clear
S0517	clear for the tape
S0518	for the
S0517	erm so do you make it clear to him that you weren't cos you've be
S0518	i
S0517	very very kind to him consider everything that he's do
S0518	i because and this be my own stupid fault isn't it i find it hard to be to be hard with anybody
S0517	you well i know that and you've always be nice to him and you've always listen to him but i think you might need to erm
S0518	we've have
S0517	well spell it out really from the sound of it
S0518	we've have a lot of very er i don't know the word heartfelt upset conversations where i've get really angry and and then i've cry as well and obviously he's get angry and punch the car because i say to him we're just sing off two different hymn sheet how we view our friendship be completely different i'm in a completely different place to where you be and he want to make some common grind go forward and what i've say be i want us to be able to be civil with one another on the side of the football pitch and he say be that it be that all be that all that you want and i be like yeah and erm for the sake of the boys and the other parent and you know it's would be no good for you
S0517	so do he not accept the fact that you don't want an affair with him
S0518	no no
S0517	he think seem to think that's
S0518	he won't accept it and he want to talk me into it and
S0518	it be base on the fact that why should anybody need to know and you can have your cake and you can eat it and you know who invent monogamy anyway it's a manmade rule and now he's find out that the pope have a friend who be a lady
S0517	oh
S0518	and all of that do i tell you that
S0517	yes but it yes you do but if you're not interest romantically you're not interest that's where it have to end and that's what i think you're
S0517	gonna need to push home to him
S0518	in his mind though we're not i've tell you i think i think i tell you this when i say to him and it be funny because i just just tell you hi how be your day and then when he turn up on wednesday the
S0517	oh i couldn't
S0518	first thing i say be hi how be your day
S0517	i know do you do you see my laugh
S0518	i know
S0517	cos i just couldn't i be cos of course his answer be die and i felt terrible
S0518	i know
S0517	that i'd laugh but it be just because of what you'd say
S0518	i know
S0517	before of that
S0518	and i say it on purpose because that's what
S0517	i know you do and that's what make me laugh and i'm think
S0518	and that's what that's what
S0517	oh i hope he didn't see me cos his answer be die
S0518	and that's what i always say
S0517	mm
S0518	you know hi how be your day and i do ask him and i i feel disloyal to because now obviously all this have develop
S0517	that kiss be weird wasn't it that they have
S0518	what kiss
S0517	oh you see you didn't notice
S0518	no
S0517	and i'm sure it be for your benefit you know they be talk behind us and be gonna leave and
S0518	i didn't really notice no
S0517	we be talk there they never kiss in public i've never see them and he kiss her either hello or goodbye or something
S0518	they don't kiss each other full stop
S0517	no i know so i think
S0518	accord to him
S0517	i think to myself that's for 's benefit that kiss
S0518	i
S0517	i can't believe you miss it
S0518	i didn't even notice it
S0517	how do you not notice it
S0518	i don't know but i have a i have a text from him shortly after he leave and it say i'm really sorry that i i'm really sorry that i i be distract by when you be tell us about your dad it sound really sad he sound equally as bad as mine if not worse isn't it awful that you can live all these years and finish your life in this state erm
S0517	so now he's use your dad as common grind to make
S0518	well i just say
S0517	mm
S0518	i just i text back and say and he say i hope your audition i hope your audition go well tonight because obviously i be do some at 's wasn't i and erm he and also as well have texted to say i can't remember what time you're come but i've get to have a shower so 's just
S0517	oh
S0518	pop out so
S0517	let yourself in yes
S0518	let yourself in
S0517	yeah
S0518	so i i make a big joke i say oh he's in the shower i say let's have a cos i want to show to him that this be how just how i be with lot of friends and we'll just have a banter and there's no nothing mean in it you know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	and or didn't literally mean come and get in the shower with me he's
S0517	he mean let yourself in the house
S0518	yeah in the house and
S0517	and they
S0518	you know
S0517	yeah i know i know
S0518	and all of it but i don't know whether get that or not and cos he doesn't like my drama friends and erm even cos now
S0517	well he appear to be erm
S0518	he's try to get in with them ingratiate himself in my social life
S0517	what's his best friend that's so weird
S0518	i'll go back to that but erm i just when he text me on wednesday night i be literally go to so i didn't text him at all and then i text him yesterday morning and just say look no worry you and have stuff to talk about so
S0517	mm mm
S0518	not offend at all erm
S0517	i think you're gonna need to be a bite more
S0518	well for age i've not answer his texts i haven't engage in any conversation
S0517	what be you gonna do on wednesday cos i can't i won't be there be you gonna run with him if he ask
S0518	i i don't really want to
S0517	you're gonna have to make an excuse and be somewhere else you're gonna have to drop him off and go aren't you you can run in a different place
S0518	somewhere else
S0517	well yes otherwise it's just gonna get awkward for you if you don't want to
S0518	i just think i'm just wary now because if i say it's alright to run and then it's just me that turn up then it look like i'm give an invitation to be alright with this
S0517	yes yeah
S0518	because
S0517	i don't think i would run with him by myself if i be you
S0518	i mean i've swim on a monday night for years nine till ten and it follow the triathlon club
S0517	mm
S0518	which he join with and which be why i start take run in the first place because he could swim and
S0517	yeah
S0518	cycle but he couldn't run and he didn't like the triathlon run coach so that's why i take in the first place but then grow out of it and i think do one biathlon and then he just lose interest but carry on swim with erm her so didn't swim for over a year
S0517	mm
S0518	so i use to just go on mondays and obviously not see him wait for the triathlon to finish get in do my swim now he's come back to it like he say to me he write on this letter or do he write a letter or text me i can't remember and just say erm i know you want to see me because you're come swim on a monday night and i be like i've swim for years on a monday night i don't come to see you and he say well the fact that you be there wait to get in when we get out he say you could easily have come five minutes later so the next week i go later
S0517	oh
S0518	cos i just think if that's what he think
S0517	he's read stuff into all sort of things
S0518	into
S0517	that's not there isn't he
S0518	stuff that i just do normally
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	so that's my worry i'm be
S0517	if i be you i honestly wouldn't run with him and if it mean say oh no i've get to be somewhere else make an excuse go somewhere i mean the run's only half an hour long you've get an hour i would cos i i
S0518	mm i just er you say you've be nice and consider that he's do all of this but i think you know somewhere along the line i'm obviously partially to blame because i've be too friendly and
S0517	well no i don't think you're partially to blame i think that you need to appreciate that he's make his feel clear that he want more than friendship
S0518	mm
S0517	if you've say no i don't want more than friendship he need to back off
S0518	yeah
S0517	you haven't do anything wrong he need to back off
S0518	he give he's give me a necklace
S0517	god have you accept it
S0518	no i i
S0517	when do he give it you
S0518	christmas
S0517	be it an expensive one
S0518	it's erm i don't know it's in a box it's get a butterfly and two little diamond four diamonds in it
S0517	diamonds
S0518	little tiny little
S0517	be they diamonds actual diamonds
S0518	erm well i don't know it's all mark i don't know erm but diamond
S0517	do you open it on front of the family
S0518	no no
S0517	you see that's slightly alarm
S0518	no
S0517	why not
S0517	why not
S0518	because i first of all he give this thing to me and i erm say that i could i say i don't want it but and then he but then he get really like upset and get and mad and erm i say i can't accept a gift from you i can't accept a gift from you but and but then he be he be upset because he'd be and buy it and choose it especially and all this kind of business and it be suppose to be a peace offer and all of this erm
S0517	a peace offer for what
S0518	for all the upset that he'd cause i need to go back a bite really don't i i feel bad cos i've tell you too much already but erm
S0517	have he cause you a lot of upset
S0518	yeah yeah because because he hasn't take no for an answer and then he say
S0517	well he's still not then be he
S0518	no he isn't but i think he's in a mess you see i think he's in a really bad mess and erm
S0517	he do sound a little bite unstable i'd be a bite concern if i be you cos he's not take no for an answer he's get more and more obsess
S0518	last
S0517	gift and flower and letter and
S0518	yeah
S0517	texts and turn up now at the thing i would be a little bite concern
S0518	well i be concern but i'm concern as to what his and i i've say to him you're unstable and i don't know what action you're gonna take next and i say and it really worry me because one minute you're just really normal and ground and calm and act like the person that i know and the next minute you're erm
S0517	a stalker
S0518	yeah do
S0518	really bizarre and then send a really nasty horrible text to me and then send a really nice text and then and and then and i just ignore them all and then he he'll say you know one time when you and it be at the and you saw us sit in the car you've see us sit in the car
S0517	mm
S0518	a few time
S0517	yeah
S0518	we're have these big conversations and and then
S0517	oh be that the time he didn't want to get out the car cos he say you'll just go and talk to
S0518	yeah and you'll
S0517	and then you'll leave me out
S0518	yeah yeah
S0517	like some sort of child
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah no no my husband just think he's weird he always have do
S0518	well i think he's right
S0517	and i'm not gonna tell him anything because i do hate it when 's right and he call it so often with people
S0517	it really annoy me i think
S0518	but would not approve anyway
S0517	oh my goodness no he'd just would think really badly of and then he'd just go why be your friend put up with that what's wrong with her why be she put up with that cos he's a bite like that
S0518	because erm
S0517	cos he's a bite black and white
S0518	and because also
S0517	but it doesn't want
S0518	i'm stupid i be
S0517	no you're not stupid
S0518	i be stupid
S0517	but he call it he do i don't know how he do that he's always say it right from the start from the minute we meet him

S0518	okay erm choose to declare his feel and decide to cycle to hall to barge into the performance and say all of this but in
S0517	in front of anyone
S0518	no just in front of me
S0517	oh
S0518	but he didn't realise that the cycle ride be so long and he didn't get there on time
S0517	how long do it take
S0518	i don't know
S0517	that's hilarious
S0517	so so what have you go home
S0518	erm i no i think he just he decide it be just too late by that stage
S0517	oh okay
S0518	be that you
S0517	no
S0518	the ring
S0517	it be you oh my goodness
S0518	right let me just see what this say okay i don't it's just to do with the play i don't need to look at that just now erm yeah he be he oh i can't even remember how it
S0517	so when
S0518	happen
S0517	do he tell you then if he miss you at that point after cycle all the way to hall that be hilarious
S0518	he well he'd he he say something it must have be the wednesday whatever day the boys have and he'd get this new car and he say oh come and sit in my new car and
S0517	oh i remember you tell me that
S0517	yes
S0518	and and then he say something to me in that car and i be like horrify and get out of the car and then
S0517	what do he say
S0518	that just basically that he think that we should you know have an affair together
S0518	and i get out of the car and he send me a text the next day and say i'm never gonna let you ever sit in my car again and erm you tease me by sit in my car
S0518	wear stock how would anybody know that how would anybody know that
S0517	be you
S0518	well they be pull holdups pull up holdups
S0517	how well
S0518	so i
S0517	you i'm not be funny yes you be partly to blame you should have put a stop to it there and then what be you think still be so nice to him
S0518	but i wasn't that be the that be that be yeah okay i'm partly to blame because i just think this be ludicrous what be this where have this all spring from
S0518	this be just out of nowhere and i be just like i don't be absolutely so ridiculous i'm get out of this car now but you see at the time i be in absolute meltdown
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	over everything else and that be all that i could focus on and i be just like what in the middle of all of this
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	what how dare you
S0517	which he didn't know about do he
S0518	oh absolutely not so erm
S0517	oh my goodness no i didn't mean that you're not partly to blame
S0518	well i be
S0517	you're not
S0518	i be
S0517	i didn't mean that erm
S0518	because i think i could sort it out you see so then he
S0517	so but you haven't
S0518	tell me that he'd erm whatever day it must have be it must have be be it well it be the wednesday and thursday so it be the wednesday night that he then the follow week that he decide that he would i'm gonna make her know how serious i be about this i'm gonna cycle to her performance at hall and i'm gonna walk in and i'm gonna ask to see her and i'm gonna tell her this and can you imagine that wednesday night and i be act in this play together and his wife on the very front row we've already get that to contend with without that happen but i didn't find out about it till the next day when texted me and say by the way last night i start to cycle out to see you my intention be however i didn't realise how far it be
S0517	oh god
S0518	and i i think the performance would probably nearly be finish so i just turn around and come home so i agree to
S0517	oh
S0518	meet him for a serious talk on that friday and i just say to him i say look you can't you can't know all of this but i say there's some other stuff that's happen in my life really really important awful stuff and i just need to tell you now that er be anything but friends with you would be absolutely just it it we can't do it because i say it will go pear shape i don't want to anyway
S0517	no you see you've phrase that wrong because that give him a hope that
S0518	well i probably didn't say it in that order
S0517	i should hope you didn't because that would give him an an idea that
S0518	i probably didn't say it in that order
S0517	if other things hadn't happen you'd say yes
S0518	no because i didn't
S0517	okay
S0518	i didn't
S0517	as long as you're sure you didn't
S0518	because he tell me i'd stick a dagger between his rib and
S0517	oh
S0518	puncture his heart
S0518	so whatever i say
S0518	i'd obviously make it clear
S0517	oh good
S0518	but but basically
S0517	okay okay
S0518	because i know everything that have go happen with have all go so bad and that we be gonna lose our friendship because of our own just lustful selfishness erm
S0518	that risk another friendship that involve children and something much bigger just wasn't even worth it it just wasn't even worth the think of it whether i'd want to or not it just wasn't even worth it and i have to i just have to make that really really clear but then i suppose
S0517	so since then so for nine months he hasn't take no for an answer
S0518	no because obviously then i be poorly i be sign off work
S0517	mm
S0518	then these flower arrive say erm i'm sorry that you're ill
S0517	do you know they be from him then secretly
S0518	no no
S0517	do you think
S0518	no no but i
S0517	do you you ask him didn't you
S0518	no because i didn't even consider that and because i hadn't have really have any contact with
S0517	do ever ask whether you find out who they be from
S0518	not now cos it's all water under the bridge
S0517	i know that but i yeah
S0518	he's not there's no
S0517	so he doesn't know anything you've never you've not tell him any of 's
S0518	i've tell him
S0517	bad behaviour
S0518	i've tell him
S0517	that's what it be
S0518	want to stop run with us and he obviously i tell him some stuff that 's tell me erm about when 's meet me swim and say like oh i hear that come swim and you be swim for the night be she okay to you and say to me just i know what he say i know what men be like for talk to you and tell you their problems and he say it's happen before and you've be really understand and he say you're a really good listener i mean you take on board people's problems and he say and they just read something else into it and that's probably
S0517	so that's what he think
S0518	what
S0517	and that be what's happen
S0518	yeah and but because we've be friends and know each other for a long time and i don't i felt it very difficult to just
S0517	cut him off sort of thing
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah no i can understand that
S0518	and because i've always say look whatever we need to get over this awkwardness because we need to be
S0517	they're the boys
S0518	normal
S0517	be on the same team and all this
S0518	we can't suddenly be
S0517	but he obviously hasn't and he's get worse
S0518	and if say to me oh can you bring home and stuff i don't want to say no i can't i want to be comfortable enough to say yeah that's fine so that's why in my stupid naïve ignorance i just think i can have a conversation with him i can make it clear to him and we can just move on but i have no idea and i say to him i have no idea that you felt like this because as far as i'm concern he say i can't believe you don't know that that i love you and i say every time i see you you say what be you dress in black for you shouldn't be wear that to run in you should be this you should be that you you go too fast you're too chatty calm down you shush me at football match when i cheer there's a goal and i say so really you've always give me the impression that i'm too over the top for you you're constantly criticise oh surely not in another play again erm you're just too dramatic all these drama stories all these drama friends they're just too over the top and all of this he say so all the time really you just
S0517	secretly you're in love with me
S0518	you've just laugh at me criticise me make fun of me tease me so i never get that impression and i say whenever you say something to me you say it in a riddle
S0517	that's like what that's that's what children children do though isn't it
S0518	yeah
S0517	when they fancy someone
S0518	yeah
S0517	they're mean to them
S0518	yeah exactly
S0517	that's what children do when they're when they're first ah
S0518	but i say to him i'm a talker and i tell people how i feel and i say i don't speak in riddle and i say you have just speak to me just in riddle and i don't understand what you're say and you're say oh you be obviously say something to me that i'm just not get and i take it
S0518	on
S0517	face value
S0518	face value
S0517	mm
S0518	of what it what you actually mean and and obviously there's some other hide message that i just haven't get and erm i so i say i be i say i know you like me because obviously you wouldn't spend time run with somebody or ask your children to run with them or say shall we share a lift to a rugby match and stuff like this
S0517	mm
S0518	if you if you you'd just say to oh god
S0517	yes but you know er well for instance take i mean he doesn't run but that he he i wouldn't think twice if he if we share a lift somewhere if the boys be go
S0518	exactly
S0517	it just wouldn't think twice about it because
S0518	so say if then say all of this to you out of the blue you would find that probably well maybe you wouldn't but you would find that because of because be friends with
S0517	oh yeah yeah absolutely
S0518	to
S0517	i'd find that particularly weird but i
S0518	what
S0517	probably would tell i don't know actually yeah the i dunno and it hasn't even
S0518	see
S0517	occur to me because it would never happen hasn't
S0518	well it
S0517	happen but i can see the
S0518	you're put in that
S0517	the similarity that
S0518	sort of terrible situation
S0517	yes yeah
S0518	where this be a family
S0517	family friends
S0518	friend and
S0517	i know where the kid be friends and everything but erm
S0518	yeah and it's just disappoint
S0517	but i mean the whole if he hasn't he hasn't take no for an answer the flower the gift at christmas that's a bite
S0518	so i say i'm not gonna i'm not respond to your texts and then he's say that's not the person that i know because you're a really warm open person and he say and now you're just not even show any kindness you're be call me cold and unkind and he say you've get er like a heart of stone and all of this
S0518	and i've say like that's the furthest away from a description of me furthest away but i can't enter into any communication with you because every time i do it lead you believe
S0517	yeah
S0518	that there's some hope
S0517	something different
S0518	and er i have to tell you though that there isn't and he say well you know you're obviously not happy with because you're out all the time you're constantly in these play and everything and then he do and then obviously these flower come but they be at the begin of my sickness and i think that they be from from i think they be from i think they be from all different so from work and then and they weren't and then the florist wouldn't tell me and then when i go back to work i get these other flower and then at some point i can't remember not that long ago he say to me a valentine card come to work and i guess it be from him i just ignore it and erm i just get this shakespeare sonnet write in it and
S0517	oh have it
S0518	yeah
S0517	oh thoughtful
S0518	it be and it be all about the person who love no matter what erm no matter what happen will not be sway from their position so the object of your affection whether they change course whether they put a wall up whether they say no because that because the lover truly love they won't we dissuade from it and that's what this sonnet be about it's a famous one
S0517	mm
S0518	and he say his heart be like a a dry desert and
S0518	long for a drop of
S0517	look you don't think about that
S0517	of an engineer do you
S0518	and so so
S0517	i mean he's an engineer isn't he
S0518	but this be what i say to him i've get
S0517	that's just
S0518	no idea
S0517	not what you
S0518	i have get no idea because i say you're so guard you don't show any emotion you don't show you know and i say like i say i i say oh i'm excite i'm really annoy i'm upset about this da da da da in all of our time run together talk walk whatever just lift or stuff i'm just articulate it all and i'm not say i'm right and he's wrong but what i've say to him be
S0517	but that's just how people be and then so how would you know from him
S0518	how could i have guess
S0517	yeah
S0518	how could i have possibly guess from how you be that all of this be go on inside you and why have you suddenly
S0517	so do you
S0518	pick now
S0517	say to him that you'd get the card
S0518	so he text me a few days or so after and say he say you either obviously never receive the card and the flower or you didn't like them
S0517	oh
S0518	or you've just choose to ignore it i purposefully make sure that things arrive so that erm be so that you so that it be a last last ditch attempt or something to make you know how i felt and that you would change your mind and arrange to meet me or something of course i just ignore it and ignore it and ignore it and erm
S0517	mm
S0518	like i say then there be this erm pope thing and i be at the auction at 's with 's dad's stuff at ream and ream and ream of texts come through and in the end and it just say the pope be a lucky man because he have someone who truly love him on his deathbed and it make me stop and say look at my dad in the state that he be when that happen to me who will be there for me and all of this kind of stuff and in and he say you're naïve and you you and he's criticise my faith he's criticise religion he's criticise belief and all this sort of thing
S0517	oh no
S0518	and i've say you know you criticise everything that's at the core of what i stand for and you know er that's horrible because it's like criticise me and everything i believe in so you say that you love me but actually you don't love what's the essence of me at all you love what you think that i can be for you which i can't be so actually
S0518	this be me and if it doesn't fit with what you want then actually you don't love me you don't and you certainly don't understand me so i just text him after all of this stuff at the auction and i just say all you be do be wind yourself up more and more and more i'm at an auction i cannot text you back i will respond in full to every miniscule point that you have make in these constant ream of text so just get ready and literally
S0518	you know when your text won't go any further i've
S0517	no no i've never get that far
S0518	okay well mine have and i fill up and fill up and fill up and fill up and i just go and another thing and another thing and another thing and another thing and another thing
S0517	it must have take you hours to write
S0518	it do and then he text back and say i think you'll forgive me for not respond to all of that and i say yeah but you can never criticise me again for not because he criticise me for he's he say i send you my thoughts now and i send you my feel and you ignore them
S0517	and it's cos he want them reciprocate and if you're not
S0518	i know
S0517	prepare to reciprocate them he need to learn to back off
S0518	so when i be poorly
S0517	i think you oh
S0518	he say i'll take you on a picnic i'll take you to the theatre so he say to me it's what's hurt me more than anything be when you be poorly you wouldn't let me help and he say erm other people he say you know you do exercise class with he say you meet your friend in birmingham you erm he say oh you be constantly meet who's he's some mental nutcase that spend half of his life on a scottish island and
S0518	he say you know who who be these people and i say to him these people be people that i've know for years for thirty odd years some of them and i say who i know really well i say we've be through all sort of
S0517	mm
S0518	we've be through each other's marriages people's parent die our baby be bear you know all of this
S0517	yeah you can't just wipe all that out oh no
S0518	you know who know me really well
S0517	so be you you should be i think you should be slightly alarm
S0518	and i say
S0517	i do
S0518	i be alarm and i say to him i erm the reason that i can spend time with them be because they're not the root of my problem i say they be actually i can go and talk to about his art gallery and his latest crazy project and his current
S0517	mm
S0518	walk that he's plan on the isle of skye and i say and it cheer me up i say er i come and talk to you and it's all about why don't you love me why won't you love me and all this sort of thing and he and i say and it just churn me up i'm suppose to be get better and he say i feel i be partly responsible for you be poorly and not sleep well and i say well you be because i say how can i recover when you you're put all of this on me and in the end he say to me i get a distinct feel that if you weren't with you still wouldn't be with me and i say
S0518	that's
S0517	hallelujah
S0518	i wouldn't and he say there's somebody else because he say all you've say to me on and on and on be i've get first hand experience that anything like this go end in tear so he say you you've obviously you've obviously have a situation i say yeah
S0517	oh you didn't tell him do you
S0518	yeah but not in detail so i say to him cos he tell me load and load of stuff and i'd just in that moment in time
S0517	you know he'll hold that against you when it all come out that he's he's suffer with his unrequited love
S0518	well it probably will and he'll probably
S0517	he probably will hold that against you
S0518	but he doesn't know
S0517	you have to be careful
S0518	he doesn't know any detail nobody can say anything he doesn't know any who these people be
S0517	mm
S0518	and erm but i just say to i just say to him you know i've get another friend that speak to me about personal stuff and i say and i listen and listen and listen and we become close because of it he didn't have anyone else to speak to and i say mm you know we act together and i say and then suddenly out of the blue his wife challenge him and say have you have you discuss our problems with and i say and it shock him and he say yes and i say and now we can't even be friends so i say you know we can't
S0517	oh okay
S0518	we can't even be friends and he say so you say like you've talk to him what other things have you do with this guy and i say that really be none of your business and i really resent you ask me that what i'm try to make the point be he think his wife know nothing about me
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	wasn't in my circle of friends i wasn't in hers as far as she be concern he be off rehearse
S0517	mm
S0518	and i say but she obviously know his pattern of do things know what time he should get back every time he'd have a rehearsal he'd stay for a drink that probably wasn't in his normal
S0517	right yeah
S0518	pattern of things so she think who's in that play
S0517	mm mm
S0518	four people 's ninety two it's not gonna be her
S0518	you know and he he she know that it she know that he and i be friends or acquaintances and she just put two two and two together
S0517	mm
S0518	she didn't actually have any proof cos there be none really to have but she just on the off chance think she'd challenge him and he be obviously
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	take off guard and erm so i say you know be already suspicious she didn't want you to run with and with me and i say you know that really really hurt me at the time and i say you didn't stick up for us at all you just bow down to what she want and he didn't say don't be ridiculous woman he just go oh i can't do it that you know and i say and now i can understand what what she's think i can that's
S0517	yeah
S0518	probably why you know and erm so all i say to him what i'm say be that i've get personal experience because i say i've lose a really really
S0517	mm
S0518	good friend who i i say er i i love with all my heart and i say it really really upset me and it really upset him that we can't even have that normal friendship now and i say i don't want that to happen to us you be prepare to jeopardise a nice friendship that we have
S0517	mm and what do he say to that
S0518	for for a a fling
S0517	fling yeah
S0518	that that you know and he just say i don't know who this guy be but if he if he know how valuable your friendship be he would have do this and he would have do that and he would have i say you don't know the first thing about it
S0517	he's no oh
S0518	and i say i haven't tell you this so you can start criticise another of my friends and he say well it's quite apparent that you you know that you really love this other person and i say i do and i miss his friendship so but you don't need to know about that i say but i don't want to be in the same situation with you you know where
S0517	mm mm
S0518	and i say and it's worse because our children be friends i say his children and my children don't know each other but our children be friends and you know oh well not go anywhere
S0517	how's it gonna end where do you see this go
S0518	oh
S0517	how er i where what do you think
S0518	so
S0517	be gonna happen
S0518	he have say as a result of all of this he's come to a new way of think so three weeks three fridays ago i meet him for a cup of tea at marina and erm because he's he'd get some stuff to discuss and i just think you know i haven't be respond to him and in fairness i need to just hear him out he'd send this letter to me and i have just ignore them not respond to them or anything erm i've start go swim ten minutes later so i don't have to come
S0517	yeah
S0518	face to face with him
S0517	yeah
S0518	and i just think i know how upset i feel when have not respond to me about stuff so i think i kind of see from that point of view how hurtful it be so i will
S0517	yeah but that's different
S0518	respond to him it be different
S0517	cos the two of you felt the same about each other
S0518	it be different
S0517	you two don't so
S0518	and that i've tell myself that a million time because i've say why can't i see 's point of view because i get frustrate when i think can't see mine and then i've go hang on a minute that's completely different
S0517	completely different it be completely different
S0518	completely different so anyway erm i meet him for this cup of tea and he sit down in the chair and i sit down and he and then he move to sit next to me and i go like this
S0518	and my body language be like this and he be like you can sit closer you know and i say i don't want to
S0517	good for you
S0518	i want to sit here so i say i don't want to
S0517	be this before or after the incident after the pool
S0518	i can't remember same week maybe can't remember i can't remember anyway i can't remember erm and he say to me i've be do a lot of think and he say i've think i i use to think that i make this pledge that i be gonna hold my family together and i be gonna keep happy and just put on a front just to keep her happy and i have to just hold erm my family together and he say and then i meet you he say i'd know you for a long time but he say then obviously i approach you to go run and stuff and then when we get to know each other a bite more and he say and i just think the boys be get older now i've get myself in a life sentence which i don't have to have it's time
S0517	a life sentence
S0518	yeah
S0517	that's how he describe his marriage that's a shame isn't it
S0518	i know and he say it's time now that i have
S0517	get release
S0518	something for me a bite of love and affection and he say and i think that you could be the person and then the more i've get to know you then the more i think that and and he say and now all of this happen and he say it's make me realise that probably i'm approach it completely wrong
S0518	that actually what i shouldn't be do be hold the family together and live in a marriage that's miserable i should be address the problem and sort them out and make plan to split up really this be all i shouldn't be say all of this
S0517	oh well no well i'm not gonna tell anyone
S0518	this be this be
S0517	yeah no i wouldn't say
S0518	this be what i mean you won't trust me now to you won't tell me anything now about ever if you need to you'll think i won't speak to because she'll go and
S0517	cos she'll pass it on no i won't think that
S0518	tell it to someone else
S0517	i won't think that
S0518	because this because obviously this it's
S0517	confidential er yeah no but be he actually gonna go with it
S0518	well i've get no idea but what he's obviously come to think that
S0517	mm
S0518	and what he's think be he need someone in his life to give him some love and affection that be miss and i've make it clear that it isn't me but what everything that i've say to him and i've give him some home truths about i don't expect everybody i know to be like one of my lovely drama friends show it all on their sleeve
S0517	no
S0518	i say but i i you know i've say to him say i can't nobody can read you nobody you've get these feel but you don't say them to anybody
S0517	to to yeah yeah
S0518	and he say he's be bring up to just get on and manage himself and to push feel inside and
S0517	mm
S0518	it be always expect you didn't show these feel and his aunt have always say about him you're a cold one you be a cold fish you be cos you never show any emotion
S0517	lot of people lot of british people be like that though
S0518	yeah and that
S0517	be buy up a bite the same he be at board school he have to suppress everything and look at him now
S0518	yeah he's he's just out there isn't he
S0517	completely repress that man
S0518	but
S0517	yes
S0518	so you'll understand a little bite of that
S0517	but no yes yeah yeah
S0518	so he's be bring up to know that never have a good relationship with his dad never have a proper conversation
S0517	mm
S0518	doesn't know how his dad tick and now his dad's die and he's get massive regret because he didn't really know his dad only as a person to shake hand with doesn't really know him at all and
S0517	do you know what
S0518	it's too late
S0517	it's weird it's quite similar to
S0518	be it
S0517	well never live with his dad cos he go to board school
S0518	yeah
S0517	from a really young age never really well when until he be about six but he doesn't really remember that and then didn't live with him again after that
S0518	mm
S0517	so mm
S0518	and do his dad die before or do he move from board school to university and then like that
S0517	oh no 's dad only die about ten years ago so if he have we it well he go he didn't like board school so he come back to he his mum come back to the uk
S0518	right
S0517	and he go to as a day boy they call it
S0518	be they split up then
S0517	no no no
S0518	oh
S0517	they be still together but didn't like board school he didn't get on with it
S0518	mm
S0517	he be only young he come back so his mum come back
S0518	mm
S0517	and in term time she live in southend
S0518	right
S0517	and he go to his day and then
S0518	yeah
S0517	every holiday they'd fly back to where his dad be
S0518	yeah
S0517	until he go back to board school at about thirteen
S0518	right
S0517	and when she go back abroad
S0518	yeah
S0517	for good
S0518	and he use to fly back then to see them didn't he

S0518	uhu
S0517	get a job and then his dad dad retire and they come back to the uk and he say a lot more of him then
S0518	yeah
S0517	but of course by then he be in his
S0518	a grow up man with his own
S0517	you know yeah twenty sort of thing
S0518	own life
S0517	yes and wasn't about to move back home so he didn't really ever live with his dad so it's not that there be ever any bad feel or he didn't
S0518	yeah
S0517	feel like he know him it's so it's not similar
S0518	yeah
S0517	to
S0518	i understand
S0517	but but he didn't he never i remember him say to me he never really felt like he have a close relationship
S0518	yeah
S0517	because he'd never live with him
S0518	mm
S0517	and be at board school so he be never you know
S0518	yeah
S0517	stiff upper lip type of attitude
S0518	yeah
S0517	erm but i don't think he's as he's not i mean it go with the name he's not weird though like he's not
S0518	no he isn't like that at all er he be not like that well i don't know he him well enough but
S0517	no he's not
S0518	from what i
S0517	he's not
S0518	get from him he's not like that at all but in all of this that's happen maybe the only good thing that's come out be that our friendship maybe will be preserve on some
S0517	mm
S0518	formal level but that that know now that actually he's probably be think about it the wrong way around and that somewhere there will be a future in a relationship with somebody else
S0517	somebody so he do you think do you think i dunno you say all that
S0517	but it wasn't erm it didn't seem like he'd move on on audition night which be
S0518	no
S0517	only what last night
S0518	wednesday night oh last night oh sorry when he turn up
S0517	yeah be that
S0518	yeah
S0517	just last night
S0518	yeah so
S0517	mm
S0518	we have this talk anyway and i say to him i'm glad that you've do this thing here and that you've he he say he feel at a calmer place now and that he felt like the old proverb of the wind and the sun and i be like the man walk along in the coat and he be the wind and the harder he blow the tighter i've put the coat around and that as soon as the sun come out the coat would come off and he he'd do this think and then i say to him this be like the first bite of sense that you've speak for a long time and he say i'm glad as painful as it's be that you've come to this understand
S0517	you know what he's gonna hope for though don't you he's gonna hope that if he back off a little bite and tell you that he's take that approach that eventually you'll come round to your own way of think and tell him
S0518	no cos i've make it quite clear cos in that conversation i say to him but i say i hope in say this that you haven't get this in your head that i be that person
S0517	okay
S0518	so i say if whatever decision you and come to
S0517	mm
S0518	and that'll be really you know potentially really sad erm but you will make it for your own reason and i say you've explain those now and i say and i feel confident that you're clear in your head about those
S0517	right okay
S0518	i say but i have to make it clear to you that do not be do anything along those line
S0517	on my account
S0518	on my account because i will not be wait for that to happen
S0517	mm mm
S0518	and i will not be that person to give you that
S0517	and do you think he take that on board
S0518	well he say he do because then he talk about erm just not really know where to look for anybody else you know how he would possibly meet anybody else
S0517	he's still marry he's get a lot to get through first
S0518	well and yeah
S0517	mm
S0518	and he talk in a lot of detail which i won't you know i've give you the bare bone then but he talk in a lot of personal detail about stuff and i won't disclose that because it all

S0517	mm
S0518	explain certain behaviours that i have he say i don't really you've really understand why i've be like that and he say i think if we're go to maintain our friendship go forward it's important that you do understand why i do and be the way i be so i say okay which he say

S0517	yeah
S0518	he say
S0517	yeah
S0518	isn't that the nicest compliment you make me feel like i be a worthwhile person but my point be that i'm always there to support him whenever he's have a erm a
S0517	yeah
S0518	something's upset him he he'll always get in contact with me for a kind word for a shoulder to cry on
S0517	yeah
S0518	i'm dump on you it's not fair i'm sorry you're the last person i should dump on but if ever i need any support

S0517	he doesn't reply
S0518	i can't i can't i can't go down that route i can't
S0517	yeah
S0518	it's too dangerous if ever oh i can't i can't
S0517	yeah
S0518	and
S0517	so it's a bite one side it
S0518	yeah and so i be just think the only reason that he miss me be because i make him feel better about himself so i be probably a little bite
S0517	mm
S0518	sarcastic i dunno if that's the right word when i say to him well we yeah yeah and that's the only reason because you'll never you'll never say to me i miss you because i miss something
S0517	like this about you
S0518	yes
S0517	or that about you yes
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0518	i miss your smile i miss your laughter i miss your conversation or whatever it's just i miss you because you make me feel
S0517	make me feel good
S0518	better
S0517	mm
S0518	and he say no no you're misinterpret me you be you're misinterpret me and he say you know i think about you
S0517	mm
S0518	all the time and he say i think i think that we could be happy i do and he say i'm not i'm just not happy now but he say

S0517	you'd be surprise though how many people be like that i think
S0518	well i've be
S0517	you sort of you hear i
S0518	it's obviously come to my attention more and more that
S0517	clearly
S0518	this that this be what they be but that wouldn't be the life for me and that be not the life for him that be not what he want and obviously he know that i that i would love him but i thing be i think he's a brilliant person and he never get tell that he never get tell that he's clever or that he's do something good or er ever
S0517	mm mm
S0518	his kid just take all the holiday that be go and expect load of stuff and you know oh i don't know anyway anyway but there's nothing that can be do about it and
S0517	do you still think that though do you still think that you're not gonna do anything
S0518	all i all i feel be now that it make me really really sad because this time last year and it be wrong because we be talk to each other about things that we shouldn't have be talk about
S0517	no yeah i know i know but it's
S0518	and it be completely wrong but i be not happy wasn't not pull his finger out the house be in a complete state and it you know
S0517	have that get better
S0518	a little bite but you ask me the other day about the floor
S0517	i do and i didn't
S0518	it's not
S0517	and i didn't like to press that cos i think oh have things slip back to
S0518	well
S0517	unless you do it it's not gonna happen
S0518	yeah but it's because be in in the middle of mark his final set of tmas
S0517	mm
S0518	and he spend saturday sunday and bank holiday monday mark
S0517	mark
S0518	and before the floor can go down we need to move furniture out of the kitchen the wash machine and tumble dryer need to be
S0517	mad
S0518	dissemble and it i can't do that
S0517	no
S0518	on my own
S0517	so he hasn't get well why don't you ask
S0518	so
S0517	i'll send round he'll do it
S0518	let see our house
S0517	don't be silly
S0518	er
S0517	he'll do it but i mean if that's what you're
S0518	how can i ask somebody else to come when i've get a perfectly good husband so he will do it but we have to
S0517	but you've get to wait
S0518	wait we have to just wait
S0517	so be the floor choose it's
S0518	yeah
S0517	on order
S0518	it's all choose
S0517	they're just wait for you to give them a date
S0518	i've get a price erm they
S0517	how long can it take to dismantle the wash machine and the
S0518	well the the because of other stuff we've get various furniture which be in the din part of the kitchen so we need to put
S0517	oh okay so it's a bite of a
S0518	our awning thing out our what do you call it gazebo in the garden and we need to put everything underneath
S0517	put it out there
S0518	in case it rain
S0517	yes
S0518	so it's shelter
S0517	yeah yeah yeah
S0518	and we need to know when we be clear to do that so we can book
S0517	can book the floor
S0518	the floor people to come
S0517	yeah that all make sense
S0518	then so it's this
S0517	mm

S0517	and see where all this fit into
S0518	will have sort she you will have sort yourselves out

S0518	or you will have go your separate ways and you will have find love with somebody else and know and
S0517	mm
S0518	that part of your life be or we'll be together and we'll be together because something else have happen if it's be the right thing
S0517	mm mm mm yeah
