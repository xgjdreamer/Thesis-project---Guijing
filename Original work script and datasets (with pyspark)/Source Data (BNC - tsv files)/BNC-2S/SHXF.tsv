S0138	mm oh dear
S0018	start feel a bite oh dear yes how be i go to manage
S0138	that's where that's where two set of clothe come out
S0018	exactly it's the old adage you can never have uh there's never there's there's not a thing as a very low temperature it's just ah inadequate clothe
S0138	erm uh but the actual problem be that the most countries not just this country they never get their weather forecast right so you get out wear one thing right by the by the time you're out you're you end up with a car full of stuff just in case or i do anyway with a daughter and a dog
S0018	right four change of clothe one for each season and another one for roll down a hill in a muddy puddle
S0138	yeah you've get it you must have do it
S0018	no i just can't get the whole you know season
S0138	mhm
S0018	you're use to like you're use to the sun come up and go down and you're body's use to it and you relay on it in a way but for me season usually i don't know follow a pattern but that's the problem here in britain it's
S0138	be there a season now haven't get any anymore
S0018	no
S0138	and that's why the the the flower the animals everything be just confuse
S0018	ah what be we do live here have you never think of uh maybe manage david lloyd's abroad
S0138	live i've only work for the business for two years
S0018	oh right
S0138	so em just like if someone say we've get something in australia em we'd like you to go and look at them i'd probably say i'm your man
S0018	aha
S0138	i'd say yeah i would do
S0018	and what what be you work in before or be it
S0138	in the holiday park industry so have you hear of well there be a company call park resort
S0018	aha
S0138	haven have you hear of haven they're the biggest one in this country park resort be second to it so i look after all the holiday home sales for thirty seven park round the country
S0018	yeah oh wow
S0138	which if holiday park be peculiar place because so you don't realise when you go on them for holiday cos you're on holiday be that it's full of people that be that work there for in my view peculiar reason
S0018	really
S0138	well they're right on the edge of the country
S0018	aha
S0138	and they always have this feel that say that they're that they're kinda try to get away from something and that's as far as they can get away without leave the country
S0018	mm they're try to marginalise themselves
S0138	they've all get stories to tell they're they're all honestly seriously holiday home salespeople be a breed amongst themselves
S0018	really what be they like ex convict and
S0138	no they've just get issue they they're uh they're not particularly ex convict but but there's potential convict in future that kind of thing
S0018	right
S0138	they've just get issue
S0018	bizarre maybe that's
S0138	and the but the only trouble with the the holiday park industry be that em whereas we're right next to a motorway and the one be right next to a motorway right on a dual carriageway holiday park be a be down a b road somewhere so so we use to have four of them in norfolk and em they be forty miles away from each other and i don't mean forty miles then forty miles then forty miles they be all in a forty miles radius
S0018	mm oh radius yeah
S0138	it'd take three hours to get from one to the other just just because it be holiday season you'd be stick behind a tractor or stick behind a caravan somewhere and uh just a nightmare get anywhere
S0018	mm
S0138	don't get me wrong lovely industry to be in because i use to stay in the lodge
S0018	aha oh nice
S0138	and um and then i'd eh get up go down for a run down the beach before i'd end up go to work so so and and because and the other side of it be it's a bite like
S0018	lovely and do you live up there be where you live
S0138	i be live in at the time but i i work away again all week i just work away in different place all week then
S0018	okay okay right
S0138	but em the i suppose the nice thing about the holiday park industry be it's a bite like this be that because they come here as their chill out time and their relax time generally speak people be in a decent mood because of that because of that sense of holiday you you when people go on holiday they they kinda um they forgive certain things which they shouldn't to be fair but they give forgive the certain things because they're on a holiday yeah
S0018	yep yeah mhm oh i'd have think they'd maybe of it would have be the opposite that
S0138	no no some people there's some people decide i've pay for these two weeks if it isn't absolutely bang on then i'm gonna get really upset but generally speak people be quite chill so it's it's a nice industry to be in because of that as well em as oppose to walk work in a supermarket where people be not so chill it might that might be my view cause i'm never chill in a supermarket
S0018	mm me neither i hate the place and so now you're you happy work here in
S0138	yeah well em i leave park resort i'm actually find this quite difficult because em i'm i'm i'm quite use to open uh ask lot of open question
S0018	oh right oh
S0138	and get people to fee things back to me
S0018	oh okay
S0138	so i must be quite i'm uh find it quite difficult to expand on my answer rather than stop and ask you a question and let you talk rather than me
S0018	okay that's fine as well
S0138	well not really otherwise you won't get enough of me
S0018	oh no no that's fine too i mean i'm i use british speech so i'm i'm a guinea pig as well as a recorder
S0138	yeah but you can't be a guinea pig on every one can you em but em forget what i be say there the aw yeah whether i like it i uh em the uh the park resort stuff the ceo leave and he be employ and that finish which be fine
S0018	mhm
S0138	em and i sit down with the wife one day and i'd be a member of david lloyd for about ten years
S0018	oh yeah
S0138	and and she simply say well you spend all of your non work life at david lloyd's why don't you go work for them and and that's how it happen
S0018	mm oh fantastic
S0138	i em it take me about seven months i apply uh for on a number of it's quite a i know most industries be but this be quite a village of an industry they all know each other so so nobody know me so nobody be kinda everybody be kinda see my c v then say i'll come back to you and then when they come back to me it be because they'd go round ask everybody who's this big roberts kind of thing nobody know me anyway so so i treat get the job a bite like a new business venture so i start court people take a couple of people to lunch so they get to know me so yada yada da and then get a a job as a general manager in which be a great club fabulous club work there for twelve months but
S0018	mm mm aha where be
S0138	if you if you look on a map you know where manchester be
S0018	mhm
S0138	well you know if you look on a map the bite this way round if you be look really at the bite manchester leeds
S0018	right
S0138	well manchester in the middle above manchester be bolton and above bolton be
S0018	okay
S0138	yep okay em so i work there for twelve months and i commute backwards and forward from on a daily basis that be fine uh then move down here last july em and it's just far easier to rent a place down here far far easier em but love it but love it the it's it's get its usual commercial pressure but em when you when you find yourself absorb in something it it's not pressure be it it's more just a em a hoop to jump through rather than pressure
S0018	mm fantastic
S0138	eh winston churchill say that he say em make your hobby your job and you'll never work again the rest of your life and i absolutely concur with that concur on that totally
S0018	there you go you absolutely take me to the letter on that em do you credit your wife with the idea or do you
S0138	i will i do due just then so
S0018	it's true
S0138	i must i must do that naturally all the time so
S0018	that's a very good example of think out of the box wasn't it
S0138	yeah
S0018	no i go to em to see a kind of life coach cos i've just find myself in the position where i'm try to get a new career and and she yeah she say the problem be a lot of people don't think out of the box they think in a very uh lead way about what career choices they should make and just sit here now and try and make a list of things that you know you know you wouldn't be able to do like uh personal secretary to george clooney or something but just write write a list of your dream job that even if they're not realistic that you know just write a list of them and it it's true it start it start you the process
S0138	mm great right be that you have a thing about george clooney you couldn't help it
S0018	no that be just a random example
S0138	well nothing about him's normally random but
S0018	could have say harrison ford
S0138	do well do this this funnily enough i've i've get a life coach quality
S0018	oh yeah
S0138	but em there's a book that you'd probably be interest in which be call stop talk start do and it take you through that sort of process
S0018	okay
S0138	it's very very good and it's really a really easy read
S0018	aha what's it call again stop talk
S0138	stop talk start do
S0018	start do mhm very interest
S0138	and em and there's similar to what you just say there's an exercise in it where you you start think through the things that you like but to guide you down these not the things that you do at work the things that you don't do so the things that mentally em you have to physically em it's quite hard to think it through because em when your mind drift off stop those moments and say what's it drift off to what be happen at that point what do you find yourself lean towards when you're drive home eh if you're not go to go home and you decide to do something else what do you go and do that kind of thing
S0018	mm yeah yeah
S0138	so it very similar to what you just say
S0018	yeah yeah
S0138	so what be the outcome of all this for you
S0018	well the outcome really be that i be go to uh drop the pgce course that i be do and suffer from
S0138	suffer from
S0018	oh yes
S0138	okay
S0018	and um take a chance on try to get into english language teach publish
S0138	right okay
S0018	because eh one of my
S0138	and that's how this come about or
S0018	no this be just a freelance stop gap just to have a little project while i'm send off job applications and hopefully get interview but em no it's because i be rant and rave about how i really she say why why don't you like educationists it's happen in your life now while you're do the pgce compare to what be it before and my biggest bug bear be that you know there be no a teacher be only as good as the resources that they be use the educational resources that they be use em okay you can teach a whole class without any resources from time to time but
S0138	but but can can i ask you a question
S0018	yeah sure
S0138	you use a specific word there she say you say she ask you why
S0018	mhm
S0138	do she use that word why just from a coach point of view why be deem as quite critical question
S0018	aha right
S0138	just cos it it it's kinda say to it it it's almost say to somebody why do you make that choice so so you probably say what be it about that that stop
S0018	yeah i think she probably do i don't remember exactly but she's into nlp
S0138	oh right yeah yeah
S0018	neuro linguistic program process program
S0138	process process
S0018	process oh be it aha
S0138	em well actually both it's both of them
S0018	it be
S0138	but you can you can have both of them eh great subject
S0018	yeah no i i'd find it extremely interest but i'm sure she's a she's like a
S0138	brewer
S0018	visionary in that field so she's ah probably get her question word right it be me that be probably report them to be wrong
S0138	that's why i think it be that might have say it sorry
S0018	no it be probably s it be probably to try and get me to specify what it be that i didn't like whereas all my life i've enjoy be a teacher i've love it and then that specific situation i just completely turn against the idea of it
S0138	yeah mhm and what be the idea what be it
S0018	the the fact that a teacher a as a teacher you need to be able to lay the foundations of a good class by plan it well and make sure that your resources be quality resources that be go to aid the learn process em and then once you've get that in place you can then focus on your teach to help um students learn um that what be in front of them or what task that they have be ask to do so you can kind of free up your own time
S0138	mhm mhm yep
S0018	by make sure that the materials be quality and reliable
S0138	mhm
S0018	and except in the pgce and and the class and the school i observe and teach in there be no reliance on quality publish materials it be all random bits and bat of powerpoint presentations that people get off the
S0138	oh wow
S0018	time educational supplement em and online
S0138	so do they have consistency
S0018	no there be no consistency these kid didn't have a class book so so they could see some kind of follow through of what they'd do and what they have do two weeks ago and maybe oh yeah remember how we do that two weeks ago look at that page cause that's gonna help you now now close your book and we'll do an activity no it be all like scrappy bits of paper print out or photocopy and they didn't actually have pride
S0138	mm mm mm cos kid like structure don't they
S0018	yes exactly and colour and you know attractive image and
S0138	yeah an association more than anything else it i'm do ah something over here that actually link in to what i be talk about last week
S0018	yep yep yeah yeah
S0138	that kind of stuff
S0018	definitely and i think eighty percent of language learners have a visual memory so the visuals be extremely important in language learn it help you make associations as you say but it also help as a memory hook for you know you need a huge amount of new memory capacity to learn a language anything visual that can act as a hook to help you remember be be fantastic
S0138	yep yep of course mhm
S0018	but you know those these kid be come to class without any kind of book they have a text eh a class book that they'd leave in the classroom cos they couldn't be bother to take it home cos it wasn't cool to take carry a big bag around with them and so they have no record bar a few scrappy bits of a4 that have be hurriedly fold and glue into their class book that they never look at anyway yeah they have no reference of what they'd do how they'd progress and also in the the you know the spontaneous moment of the learn nothing really that that em back that up
S0138	so how so how how do you then assess them
S0018	oh well it be all do on the basis of em assessment booklets every half term that test their em listen skills write skills read skills and then they have to do a peer to peer speak assessment
S0138	right i mean at parent even do they have parent even
S0018	yeah yeah they do
S0138	i mean what do you show the parent
S0018	well the education nowadays be all about meet target and assign level to students so on the basis of the assessment you write down okay this kid be at level three a in their read skills four b in their foreign language listen skills
S0138	and that's all you tell them
S0018	and that's what you show the parent the progression of mark
S0138	oh right i guess i guess what i mean by that be i've get a seven year old or we've we've get a seven year old
S0018	oh right
S0138	uh and em when we go to em the school nights then outside the classroom for structure we get all our little time where they go in but outside the class be all of the kids' workbooks
S0018	right
S0138	so that you you sit and read all you get there twenty minutes early so you can sit and read all them workbooks do that term
S0018	fantastic
S0138	so that then you can either em pick up on anything that's in that workbook and talk to them about it or literally just see if that workbook correspond with what they're say to you and what that workbook correspond with work you're do with them at home that kind of that's what i mean by that
S0018	brilliant so that's a primary school be it
S0138	yeah and then and then you go in and then they do the bite that you're talk about here which be should be she should she should be up to a c level and she's actually now at a b level great news da da da they do that bite but they allow you to talk things through in the first instance em
S0018	mm fantastic that's a great idea well i guess secondary education be different in by nature because you haven't just just get one the one teacher who know about the whole child's development
S0138	which be yeah fair enough
S0018	across all the subject i think yeah maybe
S0138	of course it's secondary isn't it
S0018	yeah secondary you've get a teacher for every subject but then still there's no reason why you shouldn't kid shouldn't be take pride in create an exercise book in class of the work that they've do or take care of a classbook
S0138	mm mm yep
S0018	a course book a text book that kinda lay it down for them in a very nice visual way and you know engage them it no i think i get the feel
S0138	so they didn't get into that at all
S0018	no and so what i say to this life coach be that that be one of the main reason that i don't i'm not gel with this teach methodology because i think it's one of the most important things to engage students and to motivate them and to give them interest visually attractive materials that be go to help them take it step by step and achieve the learn objectives of the class and without that i be lose cos the onus be too much on me whereas the onus should have be on them cos they're they're the ones learn i'm just like the director of the film
S0138	mm mm mhm
S0018	so i say that and she say well could you get into maybe have you though about get into a career whereby you make these materials and i'd always kind of know that that exist but then i think aww yeah okay and so off that i've be very interest
S0138	and and and where and and where do that type of career live geographically be it all over the place or the the
S0018	em well the the biggest the biggest company be company like pearson longman and uh oxford university press cambridge university press so in the big university towns
S0138	right right okay
S0018	big publish
S0138	and you'd be happy to live anywhere in the u k
S0018	not anywhere i wouldn't particularly fancy go to london for example but yeah i'm geographically mobile it's not a prerequisite that it be in solihull or birmingham
S0138	and and be you say you're not london cos you've be there before and didn't like it or
S0018	no well i have i live in london for about six months
S0138	bottom three in the championship
S0018	i live in london for about six months and didn't like how vast it be
S0138	how old where you be that a long time or be
S0018	ah it be it be when i be eighteen sorry eighteen years ago
S0138	it's interest cos i eh i use to work for
S0018	aha
S0138	a long time ago em and i work at their for bout six months actually and i hat london
S0018	really
S0138	with a passion think it's just dirty em i think it's em it's it's the loneliest place on the planet where so many people seem to be around
S0018	yeah yeah
S0138	em eh the the whole element of eh you you're never out of your work clothe for for no other reason then you you may as well stay in them and have a pint or go for a meal because it'll take you three hours to get home if you do it any other way
S0018	yeah that's exactly what be go on for me
S0138	all that kind of thing
S0018	i live in and a my best friend live in and it would take me less time to come up to birmingham than it would to get over to see her yeah
S0138	yeah it would to get across yeah exactly
S0018	and it be em i mean back then i'd just finish university and i be just get you know pay by the hour job just to keep myself go till i go to spain but yeah you you you'd spend one hour of pay on transport another hour of pay on a beer after
S0138	do you coach him
S0018	no i'm a he's be talk here as well
S0138	oh talk to you
S0018	yeah so no so that's why i didn't like it and i live in paris as well and i have the same feel there it be just too big and
S0138	now you see i this be go to make it sound as though i'm a gipsy but em i use to work for cos before the leisure industry i work for the drink industry and be obviously one of their offices in just outside paris and em i live in em past four months and still can't really speak a word of french i get dreadful at it as i say i'm dreadful with languages which which be sometimes get quite annoy about em because i'm quite a structure person so i'm go to say all this and really i'm not interest enough cos i haven't do anything about it but i've i've always be interest in structure of latin on the basis that that's the structure of most languages and i've always though if i could get to grip with the structure of that then i could link off that and be really interest in it never do anything about it like but i've always think
S0018	yeah yeah aww yeah
S0138	em but em i can i honestly i can go away on holiday and forget the town that i'm stay in literally within days of be on holiday because i can't remember i i don't i seem to associate different sound
S0018	right
S0138	things people's name so so people from ethnic minorities or not particular ethnic minorities but with non british name
S0018	right
S0138	that that so for instance when i saw your ah email actually i would tend to say to myself em stephanie just say to myself and i would automatically do that in my head
S0018	aha
S0138	i could do that with an ethnic name em or a non british name and within second of do it
S0018	you'll have forget it
S0138	it'll have go away
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0138	and it just eh i just really really difficult for me
S0018	yeah be it because you're be it because you're say it to yourself do it happen to you when you write it down mm
S0138	em it it's the only way i've be able to learn any kind of foreign language be through play with my daughter
S0018	okay
S0138	em my daughter's school be be a school of excellence in spanish
S0018	oh oh
S0138	as it happen so she em she start speak when she em she's seven and she start speak it when she be literally in reception area when they first start do it
S0018	mhm super
S0138	so we do all all of the em the christmas in spanish we do em we do em animals when we're play in spanish
S0018	aha
S0138	but even now i can't remember but as soon as she start if she start do them and play them i'd then start get into it more
S0018	right right
S0138	so so even to the point where i think these you you can learn some of the languages by em on a on a on a cd that's get all animals on it for kid
S0138	i've actually think i need that really cos cos i've i've get i've waste so much money on linguaphone
S0018	right
S0138	cos as a job in the past i've spend a lot of time in the car get from a to b
S0018	uh huh oh right so you've take a
S0138	i've always have em in the car but honestly waste of money
S0018	mm
S0138	and i and i persevere with them i mean i i bet i've have uh weeks of hours worth of listen to this weeks
S0018	really so it's not the repetition thing it's not the visual thing or the aural thing it's just
S0138	the play thing it help
S0018	yeah yeah well that that may be help maybe that help more because it's meaningful it's make it meaningful for you it's not just a random nonsense syllable string
S0138	could be yeah could be
S0018	maybe you should watch dora the explorer in spanish
S0138	i do oh in spanish
S0018	with your with your with your daughter
S0138	she's too old for dora the explorer
S0018	be she
S0138	now she be yeah
S0018	aww what a shame
S0138	yeah unfortunately even at seven years old yeah she's too old which be ridiculous
S0018	they grow up quickly don't they
S0138	ridiculous she em she now watch eh witch of waverly place which be an american thing
S0018	oh dear
S0138	and then she get an attitude from it as well
S0018	oh really
S0138	yeah
S0018	oh no you're like please go back to dora the explorer
S0138	yeah exactly i can always remember em ah it's terrible but em when i be watch noddy with her years ago
S0018	mhm
S0138	em we we do quite a lot of coach in this environment em and so my background be to do with that and when when we talk about coach i always talk about this thing that i saw on noddy with big ears
S0018	aha
S0138	i don't know if they do it on purpose but it it it be perfect example of a coach process
