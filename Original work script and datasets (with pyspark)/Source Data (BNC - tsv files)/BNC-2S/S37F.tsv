S0251	what have you be watch on the television recently then
S0252	erm i think the er latest thing be the erm a programme about the er russian princesses
S0251	oh yes i saw that as well do you enjoy it
S0252	yes i think it be very interest i like see things erm you've already have an insight into er because i do that period erm as my as course
S0251	yes you quite like that actually didn't you
S0252	i do yes
S0251	more than the er english do you english history
S0252	absolutely
S0251	yeah it be quite interest we saw the film one film about it didn't we
S0252	yes
S0251	so i think it give you a good idea of the atmosphere of the period i don't think it'll help you write a better essay
S0252	mm no
S0251	or get more mark but it show you a bite more about what it be like in those days doesn't it
S0252	it do it do have you find anything particularly in the erm
S0251	one thing that i didn't realise be when the erm family be hold captive and they be try to escape that george the fifth say that they could actually get a pass to england but they be unable to do that because the girls have get measles and be not well enough to travel and that be the reason why they do not take up the offer immediately
S0252	yes
S0251	then he withdraw the offer and when the girls be well enough so they be unable to go so that's how they miss out the chance
S0252	yeah backfire on them really
S0251	yeah it do didn't it but i don't suppose anybody ever think that it would come to that that all those people would be shoot
S0252	no
S0251	i suppose it be quite unheard of really that the whole family would get kill
S0252	i think in the end it shock er george the fifth so i believe the reason he er decide to erm withdraw his offer be because er he be with that the er rise presence of erm the bolsheviks in erm england would have greater effect if the er russian royal family be in the uk
S0251	mm cos they be actually family weren't they
S0252	they be
S0251	mm
S0252	have say that er the kaiser do not make an offer but obviously that would have be because er germany and russia be at war at the time
S0251	mm be there anything that you think could have be add to the film from your knowledge that would have make it a bite more
S0252	i think one they do talk about erm the strike erm i don't i don't think they really look at specific examples of strike they just acknowledge that there be some
S0251	mm
S0252	but they didn't look at some sort of er how the strike be er initiate
S0251	mm
S0252	one example be the er lena goldfield's massacre erm where the er gold miners be on strike
S0251	mm
S0252	but erm the reason that it hold such a prominent infamous position er today be that that er the russian erm cossacks open fire on the er miners that be apparently by accident because erm they that the miners be try to attack the cossacks
S0251	and how many people be kill
S0252	i think it be a few hundred
S0251	it be some accident wasn't it
S0252	it be yes
S0251	mm one thing that be very good about the programme be that there be a lot of footage from the time which be quite surprise because it's when be the revolution about nineteen seventeen be it
S0252	mm yes
S0251	erm some of it be film and a lot of it be photograph because apparently all the four princesses have these box brownie cameras
S0252	yes
S0251	so there's a lot of photograph of the period and some of them be absolutely lovely
S0252	mm they've do well to er manage to survive that length of time yes
S0251	it's good that yeah that they're still preserve because even when they be hold captive there's a photograph of them all when when they have the measles all their hair fell out
S0252	yes
S0251	and there's photograph of them then so they must have have them even when they be hold captive
S0252	mm
S0251	i don't know whether they be develop then or whether they be subsequently
S0252	yes
S0251	develop i think it be quite good
S0252	i be not aware that er they make er two separate journey erm from er st petersburg that er there be more than they stay in more than one place
S0251	yes
S0252	and i think they just erm stay at one place in siberia
S0251	right so first of all there seem to be er not a strict rule wasn't it it be more like a house arrest
S0252	yes
S0251	but the second place seem to be more severe didn't it
S0252	it do yes
S0251	mm it's a sad story though isn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	i suppose they want to kill the whole family because they didn't want the monarchy to come back
S0252	no
S0251	so when we have the civil war in this country for instance charles the first be kill but his son later charles the second restore the monarchy and come back
S0252	mm
S0251	so they might have try to learn from history that they need to eradicate the whole family
S0252	yes but in some ways it's whilst that be a very horrific thing to occur i think russia at that time it be face massive industrialisation
S0251	mm
S0252	but it wasn't really change politically to erm to the erm massive industrialisation that be occur because it wasn't until eighteen sixty one that the be emancipate
S0251	mm
S0252	so that be almost a feudal system
S0251	yes it be
S0252	in what would almost be consider almost victorian er period
S0251	yes yes it be another thing be in that programme they be say how isolate the princesses be around the whole family but i think if you look at any equivalent monarchy say in england the families would be very isolate they weren't go out to the shop or mix with ordinary people
S0252	no
S0251	i think people in that position at that time would be very isolate and er they wouldn't have go to school particularly i don't think they would have have govern er come to the house for their education and they would have just have have their little court circle probably
S0252	yes
S0251	i don't think they're very integrate so
S0252	no
S0251	i don't think that be much different to any other monarchy of that time
S0252	no i think have er the tsar follow the route of erm a constitutional monarchy
S0251	mm
S0252	i think russia potentially could have still have its monarchy today because i think especially when things go wrong like er fire at erm strikers
S0251	mm
S0252	and also because the tsar go to the front line in the first world war
S0251	mm
S0252	erm that mean that he be see as personally responsible
S0251	yes
S0252	for any failures
S0251	yes
S0252	the fact that erm the majority of people didn't have a vote that really count because er the current that be introduce be just merely consultative
S0251	yes
S0252	so i think have they just go one step further make it constitutional i think that would have it would have mean that it would have only be the very radical er people that would have consider erm revolutionary activity
S0251	mm
S0252	i don't think the er the more politically erm centre people would really have consider revolutionary activity
S0251	mm i think actually it be very popular i think they have a lot of respect
S0252	yes
S0251	from a lot of people and i think the tsar be look upon as a father figure to the country
S0252	he be
S0251	but i think the social condition the poverty that people experience just become so grind and he be the boss he have to take the blame if he'd try to be a bite more understand and have some measure put in place to try to alleviate that he could've still have er pull it round i think
S0252	yes
S0251	i think in those days he be very involve even for instance if people want divorce they have to write to the tsar
S0252	yeah
S0251	to get his express permission
S0252	mm
S0251	so he be very much in control of people's live
S0252	i think he be involve and in some ways he seem very interlink with the the church the russian orthodox church
S0251	yes
S0252	which be a fundamental part of many russian people's live
S0251	yes i think they have a big follow
S0252	yes i think his reputation be bring down erm further along the line i think one thing that really do damage it be the rasputin scandal
S0251	yeah that be a real wild card wasn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	mm that he have all this influence i think that wouldn't have happen have they not have that son who have the haemophilia
S0252	no
S0251	it make them really vulnerable
S0252	it do
S0251	because they be so desperate
S0252	yeah
S0251	to get any help because there be just no know cure
S0252	no
S0251	and so they turn to him i think possibly coincidentally the child have get better at one point and they er credit him with influence that recovery
S0252	mm
S0251	but he just seem to get a stronger and stronger hold on the family didn't he
S0252	he do really if they be seek erm sort of medical expertise
S0251	mm
S0252	they'd have be better off with er a group of erm physicians rather than er you know someone of rasputin's character
S0251	a mystic i think they'd try the doctor but they hadn't have a lot of success and
S0252	no
S0251	they be rather mystify about what to do they couldn't
S0252	no
S0251	find anything to help them
S0252	no
S0251	and also they be try to keep it secret
S0252	i know
S0251	because i think in those days probably the life expectancy for someone with that condition would be say sixteen years of age
S0252	mm
S0251	so that mean that the dynasty be not secure
S0252	no
S0251	because it be possible that the son would erm die before the father do
S0252	mm but it definitely would've be a more legitimate
S0251	mm
S0252	erm approach
S0251	route yes it would
S0252	which i think would've be accept
S0251	mm
S0252	by the russian people
S0251	yes it would so they'd already have four daughters and then this one son so they'd have five children
S0252	yeah
S0251	but er that all be from queen victoria's blood stock i think that problem
S0252	it be mm
S0251	it's a shame and then apparently on the site where they get massacre they build the church i find that quite surprise really and there be the little mosaic picture of the
S0252	yes
S0251	be it all the family or just those four girls
S0252	erm i think as far as i'm aware i think it be the four girls
S0251	four girls and they be worship by i think they be greek orthodox people as some kind of martyr
S0252	yeah but what it would have be interest to know when that be build because you wouldn't think that a communist rule would really allow that
S0251	no that's a good point it didn't look that new so
S0252	no
S0251	it appear as though it have be go on some time but i as you say i don't know when that would happen and how it be allow i wouldn't have think it would have be allow really
S0252	no
S0251	in communist russia
S0252	no
S0251	but obviously it be
S0252	i think they do their best to erm scupper any attempt to er find the er remain of the russian royal family
S0251	oh yes
S0252	by pour acid and bury them under a railway line
S0251	yes absolutely
S0252	that sort of thing
S0251	well they've only just be discover recently haven't they
S0252	yes
S0251	and then that put pay to the myth that it be always say that anastasia have manage to escape
S0252	yes
S0251	and er but i think they have find all the remain hadn't they for the whole family
S0252	yes
S0251	for somebody be pretend to be anastasia erm in america i think and any question that she be ask about the royal family in russia she always know the answer
S0252	yeah
S0251	and they be never quite sure whether it be her as she claim or whether it be an imposter so it seem that she be an imposter but how she know so much about the er tsar's family i don't know whether she'd just read a lot of history book i'm not sure and that historian orlando say why would they let one teenage girl run away cos apparently there be just one person shoot at each member of the family so there be a whole group of soldier there'd be five children and mum and dad so that's seven and i don't know whether they have any or
S0252	mm uh
S0251	well
S0252	as you point out it er you would have expect a shooter per person rather than one for all
S0251	yes well that's what they do have wasn't it
S0252	mm
S0251	they have one person to shoot each member of the family i think one reason for let her go be because somebody didn't want be a murderer that would be one good reason wouldn't it
S0252	yeah
S0251	because it would be a lot to have on your conscience wouldn't it
S0252	i know
S0251	for the rest of your life you'd never forget it would you
S0252	no cos the er from a russian orthodox background
S0251	mm
S0252	it probably would contradict the erm
S0251	yes the morale er morals
S0252	yes the moral and ethics
S0251	mm
S0252	that the church
S0251	whether they think there be work for the good of russia or whether they be just operate under instruction it's still it's a big thing to do isn't it
S0252	absolutely
S0251	mm yeah it's a shame that there be only two episodes
S0252	i know quite a number of er program be i don't think there be erm sufficient episodes
S0251	no no there's only erm program that you're not so bother about probably
S0252	i know
S0251	seem to go on for a lot longer don't they er
S0252	and have you er enjoy the bake off
S0251	yes i have i've like all the bake off really i find it quite fascinate to watch do they put all the recipes on the internet for you to find out how to make the things that they make
S0252	i think the er challenge where they be give a recipe to follow the surprise challenge
S0251	oh yes
S0252	i think that be one of the erm either paul or mary's er
S0251	yes specials
S0252	specials so obviously i think they will be on as far as i'm aware of the rest of them that's just select er recipes that be put on
S0251	mm
S0252	the internet
S0251	yes i think that seem very er steady she's not very erm nervous or she appear not to be very nervous even though she's the youngest i think she's do well isn't she
S0252	mm it's surprise how she's manage to fit in
S0251	i know
S0252	that with her as level
S0251	i don't know how she's do it she say it's relax compare to do chemistry and mathematics
S0252	yeah still
S0251	mm
S0252	i would personally find that quite stressful so i don't like work to such a precise time
S0251	mm
S0252	they only have half an hour to make their one
S0251	there never seem to be enough time to
S0252	i know
S0251	you know finish the job do there
S0252	absolutely not
S0251	of course there's be the controversy this week it's be on the front page of the time and the telegraph
S0252	mm
S0251	about when somebody allegedly take out somebody else's ice cream out of the freezer and it melt
S0252	mm i'm not sure how fairly that be really do because whilst they do say that erm well he could have present the cake or
S0251	mm
S0252	something on those line
S0251	oh it look a complete mess
S0252	it wouldn't have look right
S0251	no it wouldn't
S0252	and you would still be consider er the worst entry
S0251	yes
S0252	so therefore i don't think any additional er consideration would be implement in that case
S0251	no not but that's the first time somebody's storm out of the tent bite of a storm in a teacup isn't it
S0252	i know yeah indeed
