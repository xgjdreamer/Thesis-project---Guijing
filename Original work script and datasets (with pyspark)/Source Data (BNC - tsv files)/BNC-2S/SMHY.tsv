S0037	no

S0115	good pies deserve coolhwhip
S0037	yeah exactly
S0115	um yeah uh
S0037	you're suppose to
S0115	d'you remember what that picture be in in their uh be that uh it's like relief sort of um
S0037	dunno but there's just like a really bizarre collection of things
S0115	it's like a wicker it's almost make out of wicker it's like a a tapestry but it's make out of wicker or something
S0037	it be very much uh like a grotty b and b isn't it
S0115	ay
S0037	it's a grotty b and b isn't it
S0115	it's a b and b for stag and hen party it's suppose to be
S0037	look at that it's like a fake sort of beachside bar
S0115	uh yeah it be it i think it's quite a nice um sort of like it's sort of dirtier i mean
S0037	no but it's like there's load of like pound you know pound shop items that's what i be say before
S0115	but you don't wanna have anything too uh you know precious in there do you on a stag night uh or i've never be on a stag night myself
S0037	no that's true that's stupid thing you've draw on me hand
S0115	i be i be invite on a stag night to to york
S0037	can i rub that off
S0115	uh
S0037	uhuh
S0115	which be really good
S0037	or
S0115	uh uh which would've be really good but but i couldn't uh couldn't really afford it so i i sort of uh
S0037	oh you're not ah well if stag nights be anything like hen nights
S0115	but uh couldn't go but uh it be quite a big quite a lot cos it be sort of a trip in it but um uh but uh yeah hen nights so um
S0037	oh i hate them i really hate them i'd put them in room 101 definitely oh i really really don't like them
S0115	if you that's a good one to to put how many um how many hen nights have you be on be on say two or three
S0037	i don't know if it's like i've be on three hen nights
S0115	you be with uh there
S0037	i go on 's hen night i go on 's hen night and i go on 's hen night
S0115	oh right yeah
S0037	well i go on 's hen night when i be fifteen so that be number one i shouldn't have even be on that hen night
S0115	that's that's bad isn't it
S0037	uh but that wasn't sort of the same thing but like and 's wasn't that bad but i think hen nights there's just the weird mix of like shall i turn this off
S0115	uh put put the um radio on something or just turn the sound off yeah
S0037	be this the one where alright
S0115	turn the sound off
S0037	alright um it's like a weird mix of like um i'll just turn it off if the sound's gonna be off then cos i'll i'll get distract um i think hen nights be just like a weird mix of um like your family and your friends and all that sort of thing never really work so
S0115	um i when i i've never be on a stag night myself but uh
S0037	yeah i don't really like the idea
S0115	it's not always family and friends be it because
S0037	no just different group of friends like
S0115	it depend on it depend doesn't it i mean but i think there's certain things about it that that i wouldn't like sort of enforce and like it have to be all male or all female
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	um so i don't really see the point of that but i suppose that it's so strict these days
S0037	it's suppose to be like your last night of freedom isn't it
S0115	um but well that's the that's the that's
S0037	and like strippers and like inflatable body part and just bad bad crack
S0115	there's there's a few things where it's just it's sort of too uh too much attention maybe and you're sort of you should just go for a good night out but it shouldn't be
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh sort of force people to um do things that they normally wanna do like dare and that you know
S0037	ah cos like at helen's hen night there there be a theme and the theme be sexy sailors not just sailors not like not like a maritime theme where you could turn up as like an old sea dog
S0037	no no it be a sexy sailors aren't even sexy anyway what's sexy about a sailor nothing they've probably get scurvy and like horrible stds like
S0115	but this be for women for female sail cos
S0037	yeah but there's no such thing
S0115	how many female sailors be there
S0037	oh oh you've get a text message
S0115	oh right excellent huh i wonder who it's from
S0037	it'll be from your mam won't it
S0115	um but uh yeah so you don't have female sailors that but they've become like
S0037	you do i suppose you have female in the in the navy
S0115	i mean you do now but like not traditionally and
S0037	no
S0115	if you think of a sexy sailor you gonna be think of like a sexy male sailor as well
S0037	and like that's like a gay thing like isn't it it you say that
S0115	that's well the person who's idea that be may may well have possibly you know want to do it herself hadn't really give too much think on the fact that
S0037	who
S0115	no the person who's idea it be to to have that theme
S0037	ah the chief chief or whatever it be
S0115	it might might they might've the problem with the hen night be it when you start force people whether it be the hen or the other guests the sorry the the whatever the the head hen be
S0037	chicken chicks the chief hen the rooster
S0115	yeah uh the when when you're force people to do things they don't wanna do for some
S0037	that doesn't even make sense a rooster's a man
S0115	cos it's not just like a normal party uh i mean or fancy dress party it's
S0037	i know and i think as well like
S0115	because you've gotta go out you obviously it you're sort of risk seriously permanently embarrass yourself uh
S0037	that's really bad
S0115	yeah
S0037	and i think as well they're always like really extravagant like load of um really far away or like yeah we're gonna do a cocktail make class then we're gonna go on a spa day then i'm gonna have a facial and then we're gonna do this cake make exercise and each one's like fifty quid you just haemmorage money and then you've get to go to the wed
S0115	yeah well uh
S0037	like or not as in the case of helen's wed oops
S0115	we be um you know i i be a bite sort of um i think that weddings weren't my thing but uh when we go to that last one i do enjoy that last one a lot so uh
S0037	yeah i do
S0115	i i could see i can see the the appeal of of wed um
S0037	yeah the attraction yeah hey what do your text message say
S0115	uh uh oh well it say hi uh have a nice day with bet uh they be go to wales last week in august um which combine uh with the bank holiday
S0037	last week in august right august bank holiday
S0115	um so i think she mean that's the only one where lisa and that be go as well
S0037	be and be and that go as well
S0115	i dunno i mean
S0037	be that all she say
S0115	well it's just one there's some text miss
S0037	oh right
S0115	i will some text miss it's uh still wait
S0037	will they be your mam and that go as well or not
S0115	my mum
S0037	aha
S0115	yeah yeah she'll she'll probably be she she you know she probably would much rather if i be go over there that she'd be there as well rather than like me go all the way sort of past them
S0037	so yeah bye like wave to them
S0115	like um over
S0037	august bank holiday okay well that's good isn't it
S0115	uh well that's just one of them but i'm sure we might be able to negotiate uh
S0037	right well
S0115	like a more easter sort of way
S0037	but we haven't get any plan for then have we
S0115	not really well august bank holiday's quite a hardcore one i mean it's quite sort of crowd
S0037	we don't need to go at easter but give us more time to save up though
S0115	but then i mean easter be a bite as well actually they they're the sort of big ones that
S0037	it give us more time to save money though cos like actually easter's a bite close to um it's a bite close to uh you know what's wrong with you
S0115	i get something catch in my throat
S0037	i'm gonna check on the calendar
S0115	uh yeah so we might be able to go around in uh
S0037	oh you're put the wet things on the door don't put the towel here cos the thing get wet
S0115	sorry uh could go different days um
S0037	oh look all me all me little post its have go all like curly
S0115	uh well but yeah but it hasn't really damage it it's just it's just slightly damp isn't it i mean
S0037	no
S0115	it'd still be the same afterwards uh
S0037	yeah i've get the day off before the august bank holiday i've get the friday beforehand
S0115	alright so that's a possibility then that one but a similar thing would also happen on easter and probably we might be you might be able to swap or something someone could swap for one for of the other but like we're more flexible than
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	we're more flexible than than that i mean i i doubt that they're only go one one you know
S0037	no but what's not this yeah but maybe that's the only time that they're all go together maybe like like phil's kid might be go to their mum's or something
S0115	perhaps yeah maybe although if if we didn't you know if we couldn't make it on the august one then we could see them we could see them separately maybe as well
S0037	yeah but we what so d'you not fancy the august one
S0115	no i'm just i i don't i you know it's uh
S0037	i mean august bank holiday be be bite gonna be as busy as easter so
S0115	uh i i don't mind i i mean it's very busy yeah basically
S0037	but but so's the easter one like
S0115	um fair enough yeah
S0037	isn't it
S0115	well i didn't yeah i mean i suppose that's that's the one the best one um but but i be think i be expect to have more than one day like to choose from that's all i be think
S0037	well maybe there be you've only get half the message
S0115	yeah alright she'll check the um uh check the exact date and get back um they're please uh they're please that we're go uh
S0037	aha
S0115	well we're not definitely go i mean we're we're we're maybe go
S0037	we kinda have to now we've mention it
S0115	i mean
S0037	be that all she say
S0115	there wasn't uh i mean you know like may not it may not be maybe we a hundred percent you know set in stone or whatever um
S0037	yeah
