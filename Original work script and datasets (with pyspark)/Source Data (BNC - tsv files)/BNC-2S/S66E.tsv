S0405	i be mean to have a session with yesterday say that we be hand it in but but i don't i say oh there's no point have a session until i've finish it so hand it in she's like that's cool okay
S0555	how long be your epq go to be like your essay
S0405	apparently it's only like five thousand word which be like i could write that in a day
S0555	really five thousand word i
S0405	like a whole day right if if i dedicate a whole day to it five thousand word be like that's not ridiculous
S0555	i i struggle with like write like coursework and stuff like that
S0405	yeah
S0555	i can't do it
S0405	but that would be like fluff that would be like me chat bullshit i i want to make it decent
S0555	mate what be er your title
S0405	er erm so it's now what should humanity do about poverty in the west erm because i wanna include erm you know political responses as well as you know human responses such as biological and religious responses
S0555	mm
S0405	but i think the eu thing be really interest and that relate to when we're go to montenegro so well like it's it's it's go to be so easy to just make it really broad and just literally just chat about the balkans but i should like i need to have a focus title and i need to erm you know have an aim and analyse some data and all that so
S0555	why do you choose the balkans
S0405	erm suggest it and basically it be gonna be on poverty in general
S0555	yeah
S0405	then it make sense to choose a specific areas cos poverty's so massive and there's likely to be more data and there there be data on poverty in the western balkans so i should focus on just that erm but yeah and then she suggest it and i'm kind of do it in history so and then then we're go to montenegro so i be like yeah why not plus i've be to turkey which you know european poverty be like more relate to erm situations in er africa or something you know you know that erm what be i say you know the i don't know if i do give it to you in the end there be booklets on like the stuff we get in the helsinki group
S0555	oh yeah yeah i still i still have i have them i still have them i need to give them back
S0405	yeah i mean i didn't read them can i yeah can i have them back just for the epq
S0555	yeah yeah yeah you can have them they're yours anyway
S0405	yeah cos erm might be useful be it it be overcome oppression or economic erm problems in it be either turkey or it be like
S0555	it be turkey
S0405	it be turkey okay but it's cool in erm in history now we're do well i'm do the armenian genocide and stuff and like
S0555	your what do you mean you're only do it
S0405	erm we be all assign a country
S0555	yeah
S0405	and then we have to research its change from eighteen fifteen to nineteen fifteen to the outbreak of war
S0555	uhu yeah
S0405	and obviously how that contribute so you know stuff like countries become more nationalistic encourage further or a country become more liberal against you know autocracies if you look at countries in eighteen fifteen kings be so important or or or tsars or erm whatever germany have
S0555	er kaiser
S0405	kaisers and then later well if you look at nineteen fifteen you could argue it have much less influence just because of the growth of modernism and liberalism
S0405	that be er so
S0405	ah you're no no that's gross
S0555	my grandma do that it's disgust
S0405	yeah what in in the house
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	no that's like like grandma okay but when you hear like thirty year olds who have like that's what i think will be like when he's twenty five
S0555	i seriously don't get this mentality about like if cos he's basically just like a nihilist
S0405	yeah be he
S0555	yeah he's like
S0555	nothing nothing really matter so we should all be so we should be hedonists
S0405	do he i see
S0555	so if nothing matter the only thing you should pursue be pleasure
S0405	i think
S0555	and he think that it's good to pursue things which be
S0405	just short term
S0555	ultimately yeah self destructive
S0405	right
S0555	he think it's equal to pursue things which aren't
S0405	shit you need to think of the rest of your life
S0555	and it's just like yeah i know exactly like if you're gonna say yolo like you only live once
S0405	yeah
S0555	your point be if you only live once then make sure it's
S0405	then you should make it more precious right
S0555	yeah
S0405	not
S0555	not like try and make yourself die at fuck forty
S0405	that's that's what's wrong about yolo because that's how it's interpret by like everyone
S0555	oh there's
S0405	where
S0555	in there starbucks
S0405	oh right oh erm yeah erm but yeah it's like how can you not know how even occasional smoke how much it's
S0555	i don't know i don't get him
S0405	argue it
S0555	i think he's like he be like oh yeah or cos like apparently load of people in his family smoke family
S0405	yeah
S0555	like even though like really old people and he's like oh yeah they've smoke for so many years and they're still fine like maybe i've get good genes or something
S0405	no way fuck shittiest argument
S0555	yeah
S0405	ah my garage roof be make of asbestos and i get really worry about it cos er and someone i don't know
S0555	oh it's yeah
S0405	yeah okay erm yeah i live under it for a year before find that out and then then i research it and it's only when it's like use in build work and it's inhale the dust that do the damage but it's really scary cos you don't find out that you've get erm asbestosis erm lung cancer twenty or thirty years afterwards
S0555	yeah
S0405	and like you like you not that you'd want it immediately but like the think that you could just die from or you could
S0555	cos the thing be then it could advance in later stag and then you're leave with like stage four cancer
S0405	yeah you don't know about it and you're like shit
S0555	cos i i do lung cancer for my er issue report last year
S0405	yeah yeah
S0555	and like it it's you're so fuck basically that's what it be
S0405	that's awful
S0555	if if you get lung cancer you're so fuck
S0405	really
S0555	yeah
S0405	i think i do i do childhood leukaemia and the like survival rat now be like ninety percent
S0555	yeah yeah that's the thing like oh if all all for things like leukaemia they're really high
S0405	yeah
S0555	but for things like lung cancer it erm smoke base lung cancer
S0405	yeah
S0555	be really er really high er death rate because it's really high hard to notice
S0405	yeah yeah
S0555	so because it develop in different cells than normal
S0405	yeah do it relapse after with some people do find a way to
S0555	yeah yeah also yeah and also it's really hard to get shit out of your lungs cos
S0405	oh right
S0555	you know you need to breathe air but you also need to like extract everything
S0405	yeah
S0555	and make sure you don't do do enough damage while you're extract stuff
S0405	right
S0555	like you can burn skin off like to take cancer cells off and stuff
S0405	right yeah yeah yeah
S0555	if you burn your lungs and they're damage you can't really breathe properly
S0405	yeah of course
S0555	but yeah
S0405	feel so precious hey erm erm
S0555	feel like i'm interview you
S0405	this be what yeah i know it make it so much formal more formal erm when i i be clean my garage and like it's just always be dusty as shit
S0555	mm
S0405	so i've like wipe everything but like for two days it it be last weekend the two days where i be clean it
S0555	yeah
S0405	it be just like ah like you know your throat get really wheezy i don't know if you ever have that and like erm just cough up so much phlegm and like mucus and like but like it's completely clean now so there's no fuck dust in there but yeah
S0555	it's horrible
S0405	i check whether that do anything bad and it's fine
S0555	i i go to the airport on saturday because my er

S0555	so my gran er so my gran er my uncle's take her back here so like she's
S0405	so
S0555	no just for like cos like she might need more help because and the medical care be much better here
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	so like he be there and like while we be there erm we saw like these sikh people
S0405	yeah
S0555	and because they be in the part where erm like where they be like pakistan airlines and shit they be obviously go to pakistan
S0405	yeah
S0555	which be you know er yeah okay that's a bite unusual cos they usually go
S0405	right yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0555	but like the first er the first good rah be in pakistan
S0405	yeah
S0555	so i be like it's not that odd
S0405	yeah
S0555	cos they do go

S0405	yeah
S0555	by by this thing i don't what it be call he be be interview and i be like oh that's really weird so of course er my dad

S0555	and erm he be speak really loudly as well he be like he wasn't speak english so i didn't understand it
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	but basically erm in in indian punjab
S0405	yeah
S0555	they're like the government's treat sikhs really really really badly
S0405	yeah
S0555	and so they've go they've go to these people be go like members of the sikh community from the uk
S0405	yeah
S0555	or india i don't know where they're from be go to pakistan
S0405	right
S0555	pakistan punjab
S0405	i see
S0555	to to try and
S0405	escape
S0555	not escape but like help relations like
S0405	oh i see
S0555	see if they can do anything it be like so weird
S0405	so what he be be er they be go because of cos of that do you think
S0555	yeah yeah they say he say they be
S0405	oh right okay
S0555	that's why he be go
S0405	do you see the guy on tv who be he be like on some some chat show bbc chat show and he be just like yeah erm yeah no one's talk about this on the media
S0555	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0405	and that's like i obviously haven't hear of it before like
S0555	yeah
S0405	like be that a i don't know it over there a fancy car outside a golf club erm but erm yeah that's the only time i've hear about it
S0555	yeah apparently people be like die a lot
S0405	really
S0555	i don't know what i don't really know what's happen
S0405	yeah
S0555	i should know but i don't know
S0405	right so many so much stuff like i wanna research like so i can actually have some authority to say stuff
S0555	yeah
S0405	cos i hate people that they talk about like i don't it in general like i'm not obsess about it but like people who they're gonna make really rash statements about like isis or the situation in syria and they know nothing about it like
S0555	yeah that's why like yeah yeah yeah i don't that's why like i don't talk about when you talk about isis and stuff in rs cos i don't know anything
S0405	right right i see i see i see
S0555	but like
S0405	you do know a lot about things
S0555	i don't no but it's like it's i don't get why people like feel the need to always add their opinion
S0405	just have their opinion out there i know
S0555	like some people
S0405	like no one we're gonna reference
S0555	no one we're gonna reference er
S0405	there be puke on the floor
S0555	i know i just notice
S0405	i i wasn't say that to you
S0555	oh
S0405	i be just clarify
S0555	just clarify
S0405	we be just like er
S0555	we we say er so many time
S0405	i know or like ah or like er erm
S0555	ah
S0405	but yeah he do that he just like i don't i i'm not hit on him but lot of people do it but as an example you know
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	they just have to have their say like the most er do you see like today how piss off be get cos literally his hand go er like he usually put his hand up a lot
S0555	yeah
S0405	but today he he wouldn't shut up like er anyway i'm do with that do
S0555	i be just it's so weird how like
S0405	uhu
S0555	just talk like every lesson and then it's hardly like anyone else other than
S0405	see like the whole lesson like the dialogue between him and
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	like no but no he he's like way better than year twelve
S0555	he he say interest things
S0405	yeah i know now like i i respect much more of what he say
S0555	yeah
S0405	than
S0555	yeah
S0405	year twelve i think
S0555	he's actually have like a visible change like even when he be in year twelve it be it be still interest but sometimes it be less
S0405	yeah
S0555	it be just a bite like er
S0405	shout random
S0555	and like yeah kind of like i don't know and also like less
S0405	irrelevant
S0555	yeah less relevant and less
S0405	yeah
S0555	so invest in the topic more like do mental gymnastics
S0405	right so what do you think about what say about erm social health care and justice across the world
S0555	i don't know
S0405	do you think it's like
S0555	erm
S0405	i do this i do this as part of my erm history report as well er like you know we have to do an ethics section i talk about cos the world health organisation be talk about it a lot and like erm er the survival rat of cancer like way lower obviously than erm in some part of the third world than they be in western countries or more economic economically develop countries but yeah i just felt like in rs they be just like hat on the science community and
S0555	yeah i i don't know it's i don't know it's kind of odd to say like how do you justify prioritise research
S0405	yeah i know
S0555	because people we haven't even get to where we be just by follow what we need
S0405	exactly we don't know where the next scientific discovery or where where research be head or you know we don't know that we're gonna find you know er respective cure for erm cancers and and erm other deadly illnesses but we research it anyway because that's what's important now but
S0555	yeah and stuff like stuff that isn't always relate or sometimes you know do help
S0405	yeah yeah it be often
S0555	like i don't know about clone clone i don't know i don't know how it can help
S0405	yeah i know my opinion of clone
S0555	maybe i don't know maybe within like developmental psychology or shit like or nature versus nurture that would be
S0405	yeah yeah
S0555	but i don't know stuff like the human genome project
S0405	yeah
S0555	they don't have any direct like application to medicine but indirectly it have have help so much
S0405	yeah i guess that be useful in erm yeah as you say nature versus nurture be really important in criminal law and you know justify action
S0555	but also stuff like find out like things with different developmental diseases like
S0405	yeah but do you think that it it should be a natural er aspiration of humanity to just research things in general
S0555	i don't know
S0405	it's science science be know
S0555	i mean like technically technically we can mate with chimps but erm we don't
S0405	shall we do it don't that like
S0555	yeah
S0405	i mean yeah
S0555	so we we could technically but it's so people can deem it so unethical that we don't but should it be i mean like
S0405	why do you think it be unethical
S0555	i don't know i don't
S0405	what wait what what would be the point just to see what happen
S0555	i guess kind of i don't know
S0405	like cos they're not they're not evolve
S0555	i mean that's just something i i know that's that's just the thing that's just something we could do for science
S0405	right right oh i see right
S0555	but like it doesn't really have any direct benefit
S0405	right yeah yeah
S0555	you could do load of random shit
S0405	yeah i know
S0555	but we don't
S0405	yeah at least most scientific research it have a it have a context now and like from do my er placement thing in the summer like they have to have a context and they have to explain why it's relevant to either local community or or the scientific community even though some things obviously seem pointless but most of the time you know you can justify why it's important and keep contexts inform yes but but just know stuff be an aspiration in itself i think
S0555	mm
S0405	i don't think you can hate on someone for that yeah i think you should hate on like materialism before you hate on scientific research i mean
S0555	there's a he bring this picture of like erm a erm of like your basically just like this thing like condemn the fact you like people prefer brand things over normal other non brand things
S0405	right
S0555	because the difference in price be not necessarily the difference in quality
S0405	yeah
S0555	and like that's so fuck ironic be such a
S0405	isn't he the most sort of like but like yeah
S0555	yeah he love brand so much
S0405	yeah i know like
S0555	and the
S0405	he's not obsessive about it but he always talk about like yeah
S0555	the thing he he's like such he's very materialistic cos
S0405	yeah
S0555	he be like i don't think i'd be happy if i couldn't afford things that i want
S0405	i see
S0555	like if i couldn't go out to get really fancy dinners or buy really expensive clothe i wouldn't be happy
S0405	yeah
S0555	i just find that so strange that he's like
S0405	yeah i know
S0555	er head for like materialistic hedonist nihilist
S0405	so yeah the nihilism
S0555	i can understand i i can understand the nihilism kind of
S0405	yeah but then if you're nihilistic you should really not give a shit about what you own other than unless it bring
S0555	kind of yeah you should but if you're not er usually if you're nihilistic you replace the set of value that you would get from religion from another set of value
S0405	mm yeah yeah yeah
S0555	rather than become just hedonistic
S0405	or just hate society and choose to conform to your own laws because you believe that society be pointless and and erm be talk about erm yeah people who go outside of the conform conform can can can
S0555	conformity convention
S0405	conformity conventions probably yeah conventions of society be more free and that's why there be such an argument that erm the joker be erm a nihilist because he because he didn't he didn't obey society's laws but then you you think that he wasn't a nihilist because he do believe in things like anarchy and create chaos for a purpose not just for the sake of it but you know comic book
S0555	there be this book on the psychology of either the joker or batman
S0405	yeah
S0555	one of them
S0405	there's there's a oh what's it call there's like a really famous erm er er er let's see like a cultural anthropologist or something he just analyse batman and erm star war and game of throne now
S0555	mm like popular fiction and popular culture
S0405	yeah really famous stuff erm and that's his life and like he's like consult on i be watch some erm not a documentary but news things on batman it be like they have him as a consultant bring on and it's like it's his full time job i be like no way and you know erm you know you're talk about
S0555	yeah
S0405	do you say that he be like he write the original what star war be base on
S0555	do he
S0405	yeah i be watch a cinema of erm the honest trailer for star war and it be like
S0555	yeah
S0405	the last thing they do be joseph campbell's star war i be like what the fuck and then i google it and george lucas admit that he base star war on one of joseph campbell's stories
S0555	what the fuck
S0405	i need to look up which one it be one of his mythological erm
S0555	he i don't no he he he develop the idea of like a mono myth which be the idea that
S0405	right
S0555	all myths be inherently the same cos they contain the same er feature and then he can outline all the feature that they contain into one story
S0405	right okay i guess that's why
S0555	not one story he make like it's not like he be a writer he's like more of a
S0405	yeah yeah i know i i know he didn't write it
S0555	an analyst like yeah
S0405	but like erm no i i think it be i think it be a specific story that be refer to but i be think why he wouldn't er i don't think he sue you know lucas or anything but yeah what you're say if if he believe that everything be just the same story repeat then yeah i guess so but yeah so i be george lucas get a lot of crap for it
S0555	i still haven't finish the trilogy
S0405	what be you on
S0555	i've still i've only watch the first movie
S0405	oh okay okay
S0555	i haven't
S0405	empire strike back be like one of those film that they say be just as good as the first like cos sequels don't usually do that
S0555	be jar jar binks only in the prequels
S0405	yeah he's only in the prequels yeah
S0555	be he why do people hate him so much
S0405	because he's just the most annoy like character like just imagine
S0555	if you're gonna not know you mean he's
S0405	not not religious but we have a friend call who be really annoy

S0555	yeah
S0405	like in the original trilogy yoda be like wacky but he be cool in that way

S0405	because he be a jedi master and he be this weird guy that live out in dagobar
S0555	yeah
