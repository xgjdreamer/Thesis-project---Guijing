S0144	yeah jordie accent
S0024	or irish
S0144	or liverpudlian

S0144	and another story i saw about university er i think it be one of the ones in london i can't remember which one but they're gonna ban alcohol in certain part of the university cos they've get quite a big muslim um population in in the university
S0024	where where
S0144	i dunno it's one of the ones in london um cos a lot of the students have say it's evil and immoral have all this alcohol around so they're gonna ban it
S0024	right
S0144	in certain part
S0024	right well surely they only sell them in the bar
S0144	well
S0024	you don't have to go in the bar there's coffee shop too surely
S0144	yeah
S0024	they wouldn't sell beer in the coffee shop would they
S0144	i dunno
S0024	oh
S0144	i dunno it's one of those
S0024	i don't know about that that's i mean i do i do disagree with students go mental beering it up and go crazy
S0144	yeah
S0024	like over the top crazy not just have beers mm
S0144	i suppose it's okay if there isn't an area like a social area you can go where they don't serve alcohol
S0024	yeah that's all they need
S0144	then that's fair enough but i mean
S0024	well yeah they just need a coffee shop that doesn't sell it so
S0144	yeah otherwise though you're in danger of just anger people like even more you know
S0024	but well maybe maybe that be maybe the universities be go over the top be they sell it everywhere
S0144	i don't know
S0024	be they sell it in like vend machine
S0144	no you can't do that here
S0024	i've see it in a hotel in a hotel there be a vend machine

S0024	and walk across all the way around england bye
S0024	and just i dunno do you think we would it depend if my hips and my knees last
S0024	and if your foot last
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	well it's get better again now these walk be help me out a little bite
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah well like we be say yesterday i'd like to do the coast to coast
S0024	mm
S0144	i'd like to do ben nevis snowdon and scafell pike or whatever it's call i'd like to know how many miles i've walk in my life i can't even
S0024	i be gonna buy you one of those um wrist counter for your birthday last year and i couldn't find one i go drive up and down in a taxi
S0144	a wrist counter
S0024	to all the sport shop
S0144	do you
S0024	yeah
S0144	ah ha ha
S0024	and then you didn't get much for your birthday in the end do you
S0144	mm mm
S0024	cos i cos i couldn't find what i want and then i run out of time
S0144	mm that's what happen with you as well
S0024	oh
S0144	mhm
S0024	well i suppose if you don't get what you want then what's the point of get what you don't want
S0144	well exactly i don't really want anything anyway
S0024	ah i'm sure you do you could do with a new computer you could do with a new
S0144	it still work
S0024	yeah but it er in the heat we need we need to buy another fan
S0144	yeah that be a problem
S0024	where do we buy that last fan from that be from a shop or that actually that should be alright we should be able to get one
S0144	that be just yeah you can like usb fan
S0024	do you want one of those wrist counter one day
S0144	what be it
S0024	it just it it it clock how many pace you take or how many miles you've do or or something like that so you go for a jog
S0144	er i don't know actually
S0024	and and and you can time it
S0144	mm
S0024	so you go for a jog and like er cos what i think when we use to go for that little jog around the park and we never could agree on how far it be
S0024	then i don't know i think you could like see how fast you do it
S0144	doesn't it depend though
S0024	and yeah
S0144	do it it what it count the the motion of your arm
S0024	no it count
S0144	be that what it do
S0024	oh i don't know
S0144	cos surely that depend on how big you be
S0024	oh
S0144	how big your stride be
S0024	i don't know how it work it somehow clock how many miles you've do
S0144	yeah
S0024	maybe you tie it round your ankle maybe that would be better
S0144	it's like a pedometer kind of thing
S0024	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it be that what
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know i just saw it
S0144	no i don't know if i would want one of them anyway
S0024	well i think they're good
S0144	so oh well oh i like the gps things they've get now
S0024	what can you tie that to your wrist gps watch or something
S0144	no they just a little gps thing
S0024	mm
S0144	and it's get a map on it like the ordnance survey map
S0024	mm
S0144	it's get them all program in
S0024	mm oh yeah yeah yeah
S0144	they come to a scale of like one to fifty but you can then buy better ones like one to twenty five which i think be the proper like ordnance survey thing
S0024	mm
S0144	you know where you can see the footpaths and everything and you can just walk like that and then it it can you know it calculate your your journey and you can store where you've walk and everything
S0024	yeah i think wait a few years
S0144	oh yeah there's still lot of problems with it
S0024	because they can't even make those things to go in the car right
S0144	yeah
S0024	yet
S0144	and also it do kind of take away from the romance of it as well
S0024	mm
S0144	just like walk off into the countryside
S0024	i use to love have like you use to have your map in your plastic bag didn't we
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	and then you get it out
S0144	that's what i mean
S0024	and you have a little argument about where you be and
S0144	yeah
S0024	and which direction you're gonna go
S0144	it's all part of it isn't it
S0024	yeah if you do if you
S0144	not have a little a bite of plastic that's
S0024	if you haven't get that kind of orientation thing
S0144	mm
S0024	like all you have to do be walk it's too easy
S0144	yeah plus you can still get stuff i mean if you run out of battery
S0024	mm
S0144	in the middle of somewhere
S0024	yeah
S0144	or the satellite go down you're stuff aren't you
S0024	mm
S0144	so you've still gotta have the map anyway
S0024	mm i like map and try to work out where you be
S0144	yeah i love map
S0024	but one thing be we usually get somewhere and we say we look at the map and go well we need one of those it's a bite expensive
S0144	yeah we'll we'll wait till we see a cheaper one
S0024	and then we get to the next shop we we really need on of those cos otherwise we're gonna get really lose again nah it's a bite expensive
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then we never end up buy one i mean they but
S0144	and then we get really lose
S0024	but they're they're expensive cos they take such a they take a long time to make those map surely
S0144	yeah but once they're make that's it i don't know how they do make them
S0024	yeah but
S0144	it's quite clever isn't it really
S0024	very clever very like how do they measure all the i mean now they've get
S0144	all the contour and everything
S0024	yeah but now they've get like the the stuff from the satellite they can
S0144	yeah but you can't
S0024	they can judge them
S0144	you can't gage the er the height though can you
S0024	er
S0144	on a satellite image
S0024	i suppose somebody have to walk it or drive it and
S0144	i don't know how they would do it
S0024	and measure it and and then they get those
S0144	yeah
S0024	well yeah cos you get those things that you set at sea level don't you
S0144	yeah an altimeter
S0024	and then somehow yeah i've lose all my language today
S0144	yeah well that's another good thing about those gps things it tell you your altitude
S0024	mm
S0144	which be good if you're climb a mountain or something
S0024	yeah it's good if you know you
S0144	you have to go back down a hundred metres or
S0024	yeah
S0144	before you go to sleep
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's good
S0024	or you're like those crazy blokes who those big rugby blokes that in that highest village place in in india
S0144	oh yeah ah
S0024	what be that place call
S0144	i dunno
S0024	those big rugby blokes rar what eh we're alright we be at three three thousand five hundred
S0144	no it be about four thousand
S0024	be it four i don't know well it be at the threshold wasn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	of of you
S0144	i think the threshold's about two and a half thousand i think
S0024	oh be it
S0144	that's when you can start feel altitude sickness
S0024	but it be the highest be it the highest village in the world
S0144	no
S0024	not any more
