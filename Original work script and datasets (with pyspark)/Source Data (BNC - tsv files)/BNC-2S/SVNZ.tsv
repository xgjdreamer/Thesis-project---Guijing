S0022	okay so we're record now
S0023	yep
S0022	okay so tell me about your day cos you haven't do that yet
S0023	oh well i think it be rain on the way it be a bite miserable eh but it cheer up a lot this afternoon and then when i be there the day go past pretty quickly and i do eh
S0022	do you have to deal with
S0023	no
S0022	well that be lucky
S0023	yeah it be good i do a useful errand though i go to sainsbury and get some milk that be my i get some money out of the kitty
S0022	okay
S0023	and em buy some milk for the tea
S0022	well just for oh okay
S0023	well no it's share milk if you get em the milk there's a share pot of money but it go in the fridge
S0022	okay
S0023	and even if we're fifty people em well because there be fifty you'll find it doesn't last very long
S0022	no okay
S0023	do you go shop
S0022	em no i go to the gym and em then i go swim and em so i didn't after that i didn't want to go to em shop with wet hair and we didn't really need anything so no i didn't
S0023	mm fair enough
S0022	that be that okay so shall i ask you one of these question
S0023	yeah go on
S0022	okay which vice would you indulge in if it have no side effect
S0023	smoke
S0022	why
S0023	because it's lovely
S0022	in what way be it lovely
S0023	well you know if you be ever feel a bite stress you go you can have a nice cigarette and it calm you all down although it actually stress the body but it relax the mind and you can em eh get an excuse to go outside as well and have a chat with people and get away from from the desk
S0022	mm
S0023	but it isn't very good for your health
S0022	it isn't but even before the smoke ban come in there be lot of place who choose not to have they choose to be non smoke wasn't that a pain to have to go outside all the time
S0023	eh well i'd already stop before the ban come in so it didn't really affect me
S0022	ah okay but how do you i mean if you be a non smoker you smoke smell horrible if someone blow smoke in your face it taste horrible how do you get past that
S0023	how do you how do you get past it
S0022	well what i mean be that your first for most people the first taste of cigarette be horrible
S0023	yeah it's just to push past it
S0022	i know but why would you push past it
S0023	oh i see i see em well i first smoke a pipe which be a bite unusual but that be very strong it nearly make me sick when i first try it but i think i'd be like sherlock holmes and very clever so
S0023	so i eh i try that and that be oh terribly strong but i do push past it it's funny it's a bite like drink beer i never like beer for years
S0022	no that's true
S0023	but i sort of i train myself to do it by just try it
S0022	okay
S0023	it's funny what you'll do in the cause of em sociability i suppose
S0022	do you have many friends that smoke
S0023	eh yes yes a few
S0022	oh
S0023	there be a bite of peer pressure involve
S0022	mm
S0023	so i take up cigarettes after a year or two of pipe smoke
S0022	okay
S0023	you've never smoke though have you
S0022	well em not
S0023	ah i'm gonna get a confession now
S0022	well no you could you could never say that i smoke as such but em i think i first try smoke like many other things i hasten to add when i be twenty one
S0023	mm
S0022	and em i didn't mind it i'd sort of take other people's cigarettes and have a drag and i kinda quite
S0023	mm
S0022	like almost sort of like it and then if i go to party or something then i might just sort of take some cigarette and have a drag and and that be it
S0023	well i didn't know that
S0022	and i kind eh well i know but i didn't know you then i kind of like it and then i be in italy em and then i i do that one night and then i inhale oh my god i nearly die
S0022	so that be the end of that i think oh and then when i be in poland i em my friends have these cigarettes that cost the equivalent of forty p a packet so you can imagine what they be like
S0023	lovely
S0022	em yeah so that be but i think that be the last eh the last time i actually try a cigarette
S0023	it be a cigar wasn't it
S0022	be eh be yeah on our wed day when i try your cigar and it be revolt so yeah that be my experience of smoke
S0023	mm that be a good question what would be eh your answer to it
S0022	what my my prefer vice
S0023	yeah presumably not smoke
S0022	not smoke em well i've never really be interest in in drug so cos i don't well i'm gonna contradict myself here i be go to say i don't like the idea of a mind alter substance cos i'd like to be in control but then i be go to say alcohol
S0023	right
S0022	so i would love to be able to think oh you can drink not not to get really drink but i think now you you just have to you know after every glass of wine you have to think ooh i shouldn't do this i shouldn't do that and i think oh i just wish if that be remove so you could have i don't know half a bottle of wine a night
S0023	do you find it have more more or less of an effect as you get older
S0022	em probably more
S0023	yeah i think so
S0022	i think i have i think but there be i think the trouble be though that alcohol be be well wine be em be stronger new world wine be stronger and em
S0023	well that's just
S0022	and that stuff that's fifteen percent the stuff we just have
S0023	it's not us get weaker then as we get older
S0022	well it be a bite of both
S0023	yeah i think
S0022	i think it be a bite of both and i think if you i think if you're the trouble be that if you're tire you need a lot of sleep but of course wine although or any alcohol although it it send you off to sleep quite quickly initially it it stop you i think it stop you have good regular sort of deep sleep pattern so you wake up in the middle of the night and need to go to the loo or need a drink of water or whatever
S0023	yeah it make you thirsty
S0022	whereas and also i think that em because the trend be to drink more wine with things like red wine you have all the congealers and and things that i think can give you more of a headache whereas if you have
S0023	mm
S0022	something like gin or vodka i think that obviously it's still get the alcohol effect but i think the whole sort of fuzzy head thing be less likely to happen so yes if it have no if it have no effect on your health then yes i'd love to be able to sort of drink a social amount of alcohol let's say i do and how how brilliant would it be to drink and not have to worry about drive
S0023	ah that would be handy
S0022	what if you could drink and and it it could relax you but it you could still drive that would be so cool because we could go out to restaurants and things
S0023	yeah
S0022	and not have to worry about thirty pound for a taxi
S0023	that's right it would save money on taxis and it's so annoy when other people be have fun and you're not i mean you can have fun but it there's a certain point when people have be drink and they're laugh so much more easily than normal and you're sit there go mm that wasn't so funny
S0022	yeah yeah there's nothing worse than be really sober in front of load of people a bite squiffy mm
S0023	but you don't get in the mood no i hate that it's a bite annoy but yeah you should probably get use to it and you know around here you have to drive don't you
S0022	yeah
S0023	so em yeah that that would be a good drug to invent now wouldn't it one with no eh no after effect or you could take an antidote straight away and it would cure you and then you'd be back to normal that's
S0022	but i don't i don't well i be go to say i don't take alcohol primarily for the for the effect but i must do to a certain extent because if i didn't then i'd just have ribena which would be a lot cheaper
S0023	mm mm
S0022	if it really if the effect really didn't have any effect
S0023	as oppose to what the taste you mean i suppose
S0022	yeah because like for example it's always it's always strike me as rather odd like say something like vodka and em say if you have vodka and orange it it just taste like orange
S0023	yeah
S0022	and i've always think that be a bite odd because why would you have an alcoholic drink that you can't taste
S0023	so you can get drink
S0022	well yeah i know but i i always think that sound really really immature i'd rather have something that i like the taste of
S0023	yeah
S0022	but anyway should we do you do you ask me one of your question
S0023	okay which be more important intelligence or common sense
S0022	mm hm well this be an interest one em mm i think
S0023	i mean you could say you've get so much of both my love that's wonderful
S0023	but maybe a more eh you know descriptive answer would help
S0022	well that's very interest isn't it because you hear about these people ah like well i be go to say maybe people that be on the sort of autism spectrum who be incredibly clever
S0023	yeah interest
S0022	and could be very and have a really really high level of intelligence but they can't they can't deal with the most basic things
S0023	so they can be brilliant at maths for example can't they
S0022	yeah yeah but it's
S0023	but then they can't do up their trousers or something ridiculous
S0022	yeah
S0023	or cross the road or certainly they're poor at social skills aren't they traditionally
S0022	yes yes a lot of people who have get very high intelligence
S0023	mm
S0022	em i suppose eh from a sort of survival point of view common sense be more important but but do you know what you how often have you and i say that if people just if people just do the job they have to do and and get on with it then it would be so much
S0023	but what's that then
S0022	businesses would run so much smoothly what do you mean
S0023	what's that common sense or intelligence
S0022	no that's common sense to me
S0023	mm mm
S0022	so for example oh i don't know em if i'm if i'm ring up about your em if i'm ring up about your car insurance and i want to ask something really really you know really sort of basic that isn't that's that's i can't think of an example say i want to ask a really basic point
S0023	mm
S0022	that basically i'm ring up cos i'm do your admin you're at work and blah blah blah and then say oh no we can't give it to you because em
S0023	yeah yeah
S0022	because of what's that stupid law the data protection act or something
S0023	yeah
S0022	but then have say that it's probably not their fault but what else em i'm not sure i can't think of an example now but em what do you think
S0023	well i think it's a it's a bite of a trick question really because if you if you have one without the other you're really a bite stick
S0022	yeah
S0023	and what be common sense apart from intelligence that's become a regular you know eh activity i suppose what they mean by common sense perhaps be the things people do habitually which isn't quite the same as intelligence so you know it would take a lot of intelligence to eh to invent the bicycle but it doesn't take eh but it only take common sense to say em eh to ride it just practice there's a different level of skill that's involve there
S0022	that thing's go off be it alright
S0023	em hopefully it's still work let's find out try to save battery probably
S0022	em i suppose you wouldn't have you'd have no em you'd have no well would you well i be go to say that you wouldn't have like some brilliant inventors would you have those without intelligence would you have brilliant businessmen would you have steve job without intelligence you you don't create something like em the ipad just from common sense do you or do you maybe because some of the things some of the useability of say an ipad or an ipod or an iphone or whatever be be more sort of intuitive than than use a sort of traditional computer
S0023	i think my yeah you might yeah i know what you're say what there're get at i think be that if you have intelligence apart from real life then it's inapplicable
S0022	mm
S0023	and it seem like spock say in star trek you don't know who spock be do you
S0022	no well i know who he be
S0023	he's the one with the pointy ears but
S0022	yeah
S0023	he basically he live by logic and he have no emotions or very few and so he be see as intelligence but without eh he have get common sense though but he just doesn't have feel so mm
S0022	i suppose it's it's it's interest isn't it how you define them but i suppose the the question sort of get at the sort of the basic sort of rationalize
S0023	yeah that's yeah
S0022	as oppose to think of greater for example if em when i think of intelligence i think of people who be maybe sort of quite academic who can ah who can apply who can apply stuff em like someone like my dad who's very he can he can learn he can learn stuff sort of by rote but he can't apply it at all
S0023	so how do those term apply to him
S0022	em well what i'm think of obviously not very clearly be that to me intelligence be something that be more academic that be a be a higher level it be think of say for example em when you start read between the line or if you're if you're study literature and you start look at symbolism and you're you kind of have to look for things that isn't look for things that aren't sort of star at you
S0023	oh okay
S0022	and you have to almost make deductions about things mainly
S0023	so logical logical original think and identification of the facts as oppose to do things out of habit would be one way of look at it
S0022	maybe
S0023	well i think you could do a question now cos it be a bite tricky that one
S0022	it be quite tricky wasn't it
S0023	mm
S0022	ah this be interest which other culture other than this presumably which other culture would you choose to be bear into
S0023	ooh culture
S0022	yeah
S0023	so that could be any time or place couldn't it be that right
S0022	eh possibly
S0023	em well i'd say greek civilization
S0022	really
S0023	yeah i know they'd be a lot of things bad about it but eh it be an incredible time i mean ancient greece in the time of eh aristotle and plato and people like that
S0022	but you wouldn't have electric blanket or ipods
S0023	i know but it's warm in greece i wouldn't worry about that but you'd have this amaze culture that be blossom and change for the better and make discoveries every like day every day but i think at an incredible pace and their worship of eh eh art and em their their view of man and so on i think be it would be refresh and em and thoroughly enjoyable obviously very threaten because of all the war and so on that people have then and you wouldn't be as safe but it would be eh an exhilarate sort of time
S0022	mm
S0023	i think
S0022	mm that's interest i think
S0023	probably wouldn't live nearly as long we'd be dead by now probably
S0022	no that be quite interest cos i'm think as a woman i think
S0023	eh
S0022	the first thing that spring to mind with me be think okay what culture do women have em near equality with men
S0023	good point
S0022	em i suppose i would kind of think of contemporary culture and em i mean even if i think about even if i think about europe even if i think say southern europe they're still more patriarchal i'd say than we be em eh i think if you go towards northern europe then they're probably more equal but then em you've probably get socialist em politics
S0023	eh mm
S0022	em then that i suppose that leave america which i haven't really think about
S0023	it vary a lot depend on which part you go to as you know
S0022	yeah yeah
S0023	very very different
S0022	yeah but there's still it's a funny thing because although i mean i think that em although there be although there be there be areas obviously where women haven't get equality with men i think britain be be pretty high in the list
S0023	yeah yeah
S0022	but every now and then you still come across real sort of misogyny and these sort of dark age ideas em
S0023	like when
S0022	well i be think about oh gosh a few weeks ago i be just listen to jeremy vine and he be oh there be some story about a canadian policeman who say to who say to women if you don't want to get rap then don't dress like sluts or something like that
S0023	yeah
S0022	and and first of all i think well that be go back to our common sense cos that's kind of common sense but then i be listen to what people be be be ring in with and there be such misogyny there be this idea that em well you know if you flaunt it what do you expect and i think oh i know okay okay so if a woman suggest that she might be em she might be interest in maybe meet a man then it's alright for any man to just come and take her i mean that's absolutely ridiculous
S0023	be any of the callers women
S0022	yeah they be old women
S0023	yeah interest
S0022	em but there another oh yeah this morning i be watch em your favourite darling big fat gypsy weddings and em it be talk about who gypsies who have marry non gypsies and how some of their relationships work and some of them haven't cos they have in their in the gypsy culture it's a very you know the women stay at home look after the they look after the children they and they clean they clean all the time the men sort of be real men they drink and they fight you know eh deal with horse and stuff and i kind of think from watch it i think the relationships which be most likely to work be when you have a gypsy marry a a gypsy woman marry a non gypsy man because a a a non gypsy man probably isn't gonna be too worry about a woman that want to stay at home and look after the children and clean a lot
S0023	no he'd be jolly glad probably
S0022	whereas the opposite if you have a non
S0023	oh yeah
S0022	gypsy woman
S0023	yes
S0022	and her husband expect her to clean all the time and you know
S0023	yeah that wouldn't work
S0022	never change a nappy and and not be present at the birth of a child and all the rest of it i think that would be harder
S0023	yeah
S0022	but anyway yeah i'm not quite sure what other culture i would like to be bear in em but i suppose it would have to be it eh but eh definitely have to be and maybe even somewhere like australia i think
S0023	but in the present time you mean
S0022	yeah i think so i think you know i couldn't be in a time where there be for example no contraception i mean that would be unthinkable
S0023	oh yeah
S0022	couldn't be in a time where you know women couldn't be couldn't give their opinions on things
S0023	yeah
S0022	so
S0023	well good answer i think
