S0203	she's really creative
S0202	that involve common sense and apparently she use to be really really clever
S0203	oh right
S0202	like mega clever but then obviously if you be a nerd when you be in school you don't have friends so she pretend that she be really dumb and then she pretend for that long that she become dumb
S0203	that's what yeah
S0202	and apparently that's what happen she pretend for so long she become dumb
S0203	cos she be really like ditzy sort of thing like but i can see why she would do that and i could see how it would happen
S0202	but apparently she use to be really clever
S0203	right so do i
S0202	yeah me too before i get
S0203	drink
S0202	drink in my life how weird be it through right you go to university right and you sort of you don't have you you have from your parent when you go to university but you go when you be twenty one i go when i be twenty two so freedom to you be different what it be to an eighteen year old
S0203	yeah
S0202	whose never have freedom and whose never drink
S0203	eighteen i just think about be able to go out and get fuck whenever you want
S0202	yeah and not have to answer to your parent
S0203	yeah
S0202	but you have that before you go to university
S0203	yeah
S0202	so it's different right
S0203	yeah
S0202	and like you don't want to go out as much as
S0203	yeah
S0202	like in fresher's week for instance
S0203	yeah
S0202	like everyone's try to get shitfaced every night cos it's new it's excite
S0203	i can't hack it any more
S0202	i can't hack it and then you feel so fuck old and it's like oh my god i'm so old
S0203	happen though don't it we do get older be depress and old
S0202	i wanna be peter pan
S0202	he be
S0203	no good
S0202	i cry when i find out he be dead
S0203	i could have cry i could have cry
S0202	i know that's really sad
S0203	robin williams be a big part of my life
S0202	he be me
S0203	i use to love improvisational comedy and he be like so sick at it i use to watch him
S0202	he be the master of it he create it
S0203	er so when he die i be like christ that's like a huge part of what i use to watch and what i use to love
S0202	it be a massive part of my childhood like
S0203	it make me feel really bad but erm i reckon that's gonna be happen quite a lot more often now i reckon a lot of other people that we use to love will start die
S0202	yeah
S0203	like my my favourite er guitarist when i be like sixteen be eric clapton but he's like seventy odd now he's gonna die
S0202	he's gonna die soon in the next ten or twenty years
S0203	cos he use to abuse drug so much then that they're all gonna be a lot iller than they should do so i reckon people like that be gonna start die soon and that's gonna be gutting for me paul mccartney
S0202	oh i love paul mccartney i love the beatles like there's two people in my whole life that i know that love the beatles as much as i do my dad and one of my friends er we're not really friends any more but cos we've grow apart
S0203	and now and now me
S0202	and now you like the beatles to me like do you know when like i love the spice girls when i be grow up cos i be a teenage girl blah blah blah
S0203	can i tell you
S0202	me too
S0203	i i've have get the best of the spice girls on
S0202	i've get all their albums i've get all the well i don't have the album i have their albums now but i use to have the cassettes
S0203	yeah
S0202	and like
S0203	that that date you cos i have the cd
S0202	yeah i have the cassettes
S0203	you have the cassettes just a bite older than me
S0202	two years difference but like i just i just look back now and i think music back in the day invert commas whatever like use to when you be younger your whole life revolve around music sort of thing you be if you if you be a goth you listen to like
S0203	that's what you look like innit
S0202	sabbath that what you look like blah blah blah
S0203	it take on your whole persona don't it
S0202	yeah your whole
S0203	cos i live around music music people say it but music be my life like you my career music's what i do for fun music's what i do when i'm bore you know everything i
S0202	your degree
S0203	everything i do be revolve around music so it be my life so if i if erm people die like eric clapton or something it really affect me and if
S0202	yeah
S0203	and obviously it affect people er who be i don't like to say but like non non musicians
S0202	yeah i know what you mean non musicians yeah
S0203	but it affect me just a tiny bite more and it's gonna them at some point
S0202	cos your creativity come from that
S0203	yeah other and i i find it hard to identify because i'm not artistic i can't i can write stories but i'm a bite of a writer but i'm not like creative in many other ways so it all come out when do a song so my my granddad he's creative through dance yeah so what he do he just
S0202	right your granddad
S0203	my granddad
S0202	how old be he
S0203	like sixty odd
S0203	he's so er i respect that but like when people do say like oh well music be my life or whatever i kind of go it's not your life it's not your life
S0202	be it though be it though
S0203	even to me i could still survive without music
S0202	no i couldn't
S0203	i'd find summut to do even though
S0202	i couldn't i'd rather be blind than deaf
S0203	really
S0202	yeah cos like
S0203	i think i think i would agree with that because i'm nearly blind today
S0202	yeah me too
S0202	but like i don't know actually though because if i'm give a choice to be bear blind or to be bear deaf i would choose i would be bear deaf like because i wouldn't know about music i wouldn't know what it sound like but
S0203	i don't think you'd miss it though because like okay well you're stevie wonder who's a brilliant musician who be bear blind
S0202	yeah
S0203	will he have ever miss be able to see because he never he never have any concept of actually what
S0202	you wouldn't miss it cos you've never have it
S0203	you don't know what see be so how could you ever people describe it to you how do you describe like when people say oh it's really colourful or whatever you know what's the colour you don't know
S0202	feel like one of my my best friends be deaf
S0203	right
S0202	and when we're out at nightclubs and stuff and she dance and stuff like that like she doesn't actually know what it sound like she can like she's not she be profoundly deaf but
S0203	she get the vibrations like yeah yeah yeah
S0202	vibrations so she can sort of tell a tune but like personally like i know what things look like so say like i turn sixty and someone give me a choice you can either be deaf or you can be blind well i already know what colour be i already know what people look like okay
S0203	you could you could deal with it a bite more
S0202	you could deal with it more but if you think that you'll have never you'll never hear music again you'll never hear people you love speak
S0203	yeah for me
S0202	but then see them
S0203	for me for me it'd be hard cos obviously i love music so much but i don't know i i do like see
S0202	yeah
S0203	even though even though without i'm pretty much blind
S0203	like i still do love
S0202	but that's the thing can you could you cope with be deaf and blind
S0203	no no i've always say if i lose a couple of limbs like say if i lose my legs or if i lose my arm or something
S0202	i'd want to die
S0203	i yeah i'd would i wouldn't be able to do it
S0202	i could not think of anything worse than be paralyse
S0203	i'm not strong enough to be able to that sort of thing like
S0202	no me either
S0203	i'd give up
S0202	like i could not my my worst nightmare be probably be paralyse like be
S0203	well the worst ones be when they're paralyse but
S0202	trap in your own body and you can't say or speak or
S0203	yeah but if they get me in one of them computers where my eye could point at it and like make a like a you know make a kill me now kill me now with like
S0202	yeah like my mum use to work for age concern and erm she have a few patients who be erm trap in their own body so to speak so they be completely paralyse and the only way they could communicate be their eye and she'd say if that that ever happen to me just kill me because
S0203	the the thing be when you do something like that in this country i don't know i mean it's not legal to do that but then you have to go to prison for do that to someone that you love which be wrong if they
S0202	yeah
S0203	it should be an incredibly thorough procedure and then right at the end of it you should be able to like kill someone that you love or whatever but it would have to be the most strictest procedure ever like you'd have to go through do they wanna do it they'll have to find this this and this they'll have to
S0202	but if they're paralyse they can't sign it
S0203	i know but that that's the thing be like but you couldn't do it any other way because if they didn't have all that you could just go round kill your relatives for you know your inheritance or whatever so you've get that side of it and then there's that thing of erm you could do it abroad in sweden they
S0202	yeah but then you come back home and you get prosecute for it
S0203	so
S0202	i think me me personally when i get to like a certain age like forty or fifty i be go to write a will and i'm go to have a will say if i get these diseases or i can't do this then i want you to take me to switzerland and wherever
S0203	yeah
S0202	but there's gonna be a clause in my will or contract or whatever that will say you can tell anyone what you're do
S0203	right
S0202	and you can't blame yourself sort of thing
S0203	it just always be
S0202	because
S0203	get a nice family trip to switzerland with your paralyse relative they go do like
S0202	and they die naturally yeah but i can't think of anything worse than be trap
S0202	what
S0203	go out and he do get really drink so
S0202	yeah should go out okay i've get two options for you two that's it that's it we can we can drink the rest of this go to my house have bacardi jd load of mixers
S0203	a party now
S0202	though cos i don't think anyone

S0202	oh okay me too and we can do that and go out and around town after when we're hammer

S0202	and no one give a shit or we could stay here drink more and then go out after but the thing be we're gonna spend shit load of fuck money
S0203	yeah
S0202	which i don't have and you probably don't have
S0203	yeah whatever whatever
S0202	do you wanna go out drink or do you wanna go home
S0203	i whatever's cheaper
S0203	i'm gonna i've never be and i've never be like this so i can't really deal with it either

S0203	i don't get why i don't get why be gay affect your personality
S0202	no i don't
S0203	to the point where it's like
S0202	or black or be black i'm not racist but in fuck america every black woman talk like oh damn girl you do not just say that like the finger and the head go and it's like just because you're black you don't need to act it this be why people dislike
S0203	yeah because you live up to the stereotype
S0202	yeah you live up to it
S0203	it's now get this one down a self fulfilment prophecy i didn't know yeah they get stick in the vicious circle of poverty and they do not know otherwise how to act
S0202	definitely
S0203	just say big word now
S0202	yeah
S0203	er no it's because erm they be bring up around like the stereotype that they be suppose to be fulfil
S0202	but i fuck hate that though like why would you want to be a stereotype why do you live up to that
S0203	yeah but if you think about it i'm quite a stereotype
S0202	why why be you a stereotype tell explain to me how
S0203	i'm a stereotypical i'm a stereotypical hippy musician me i'm tell you right now
S0202	no you're not though
S0203	i be
S0202	because if you if you
S0203	i talk about life and its mean and shit like
S0202	no but if you no you're a stereotypical student
S0203	yeah yeah i'd agree with that
S0202	i'm a stereotypical student but my point be like you don't live up to that purposefully it's just the fact that you've be expose to education and that's why you talk about it whereas uneducated people make these stereotype students cos they're not educate
S0203	yeah but but but these black people they've be bring up all their live they're around people like that so they're gonna act like that they're gonna they're gonna be
S0202	i know but if you look at it er
S0203	i know it look daft
S0202	i've i
S0203	and you know i agree with it but
S0202	i recently be watch something call mad men it's like a sixties tv show niggers be what they're call in that tv show
S0203	right
S0202	okay so black people not niggers but that's what they use to call them just say
S0202	erm
S0203	get that on record
S0202	but it
S0203	not racist
S0202	i'm not racist no but like so back in the day blah blah blah do you want one
S0203	yeah alright
S0202	so they use to call people niggers and that be erm a it be a derogatory term
S0203	it be acceptable and they and they could still say it
S0202	it be acceptable because niggers aka black people colour people whatever be politically correct today like they use to call them that because that be their name because it's politically correct no one agree with be black blah blah blah but what i don't understand be today like jay z or any rapper they say oh my nigger my nigger blah blah blah morgan freeman come out and say why do you call each other niggers
S0203	the best thing to do would be to just not use it and it'll go away and you'd lose all
S0202	exactly but the fact that they use it they make it a normal term
S0203	the same thing with what gay people have do where they've say the word fag and make it become er if you say they use queer for each other and stuff like that er it's they're try to use it to to empower each other so they use it as like a we're use this supposedly offensive term against each other and it's
S0202	it's like a massive fuck you innit well america
S0203	they've take ridiculous like turn now where they use it all the time for no reason
S0202	in america we wear erm we be in toronto and the taxi driver be take us to the bus station to get on the greyhound and erm
S0203	you get a greyhound
S0202	it be fuck awesome
S0203	they're like a
S0202	do you know do you know who own them
S0203	really cos they're always like they all just like
S0203	they're all just like megabuses aren't they where they just take you
S0202	but better better

S0203	probably you're a bite weird or something like you get
S0202	yeah well look you're talk to a stranger and you're like oh i'm gonna get off now blah blah blah like normally that's what happen just like five second ten second whatever and they're like ah i'm i'm gonna go now anyway nice speak to you see you later but he didn't do that he stand talk to us for half an hour outside this window even though we be like okay see you later sort of thing and he keep he he say to us say ah i'm just gonna drop my dog off i might see you later i'm come back into the parade and he actually come back ten minutes later without his dog and he kind of sit with us the whole night and he be call gay people queer or dyke and we be just like this be so fuck offensive like
S0203	be that how they live over there
S0202	but apparently that's what they call them they call themselves dyke and queer and it be call the queer and dyke festival
S0203	oh right
S0202	and but to me to me it be offensive as fuck when that
S0203	so you get offend but they be love it over there
S0202	that's what they call each other like they call each other dyke or queer and i be like that's really offensive in england and try to explain that to erm a canadian or an american be like what like why be that offensive and i be like well in england we as a derogatory term
S0203	perhaps over there they're a bite more lenient with that sort of stuff
S0202	apparently i've hear they use it over there like that because they use it they use it's like nigger
S0203	yeah
S0202	nigger use to be a term of you're not in my social class go back to your fuck pit and clean your fuck floor
S0203	yeah
S0202	it's the same as dyke or queer
S0203	yeah
S0202	but in england obviously that's offensive and english people get offend pretty easily compare to americans
S0203	yeah we like to think we're a bite better than everyone else they try and correct everyone
S0202	yeah you correct everyone don't you right and that's what it be like the people the queer invert commas and dyke invert commas not a gay
S0203	not racist
S0202	not racist or gayist erm we say that as like oh you fuck dyke or oh you fuck queer fuck off back to your gay hole
S0203	you say that i'd never say that like it it sound like i'm be all like self righteous and that but i've never call anyone it if if they be be if a gay person be really get on with me i'd never go you queer
S0202	no i wouldn't but
S0203	fuck
S0202	the society would say
S0203	yeah maybe but i i personally would never use that i can honestly say i probably would pick on someone's worst physical attribute so if someone be like er someone have like a big mole i'd be like get away from me you big moley fuck or something like that like you would do that but i wouldn't ever ever go for their sexuality i don't think
S0202	no but that's what they use to do
S0203	right
S0202	like before it become norm they use to call them queer or dyke
S0203	everyone everyone's gay now it don't matter
S0202	yeah
S0203	if someone's gay if you if i call someone a gay person it's part of them like
S0202	it's part of them yeah

S0203	i see them my only only band i haven't actually see all my favourite band now apart from arctic monkey
S0202	i know them personally
S0203	i might er
S0202	i know
S0203	really
S0202	personally my erm ex boyfriend use to go to school with him and they're still best friends now

S0203	cool
S0202	so he use to hang around with all my friends er my boyfriend's friends sorry and erm he use to come out on like nights out and stuff and no one use to know who we be and then as soon as they hit the big time he become a cunt weren't interest in his old friends just interest in his new bigger boys who be like his friends and shit and he drive around now in where my ex boyfriend live erm in a muscle car in a fuck suit all the time think he's the fuck dog bollocks he's actually a fuck cunt
S0203	i can i can believe that yeah
S0202	since since he become famous he's become a fuck massive knobhead
S0203	i'd like i'd like i'd like to think i wouldn't do that yeah but you can never tell look it happen to you you can never you can never think about what actually
S0202	would you let it change you
S0203	i don't think i'd like to think i wouldn't but you don't know like i would never say oh i definitely wouldn't cos
S0202	you don't know do you
S0203	like if there's that much pressure and stuff like that happen to you and there's that much stuff happen like them you don't know how you change i've change since
S0202	you change in a way but
S0203	you get more cocky
S0202	personally like as a as a yorkshire person and as a nice guy like you don't you you don't have you don't
S0203	yeah but he might have be a nice guy
S0202	no but he wasn't he be always cocky
S0203	right
S0202	he be a nice guy but he be always cocky like as soon as he cos i know him before he go into his band and like proper in a band like perform like you be
S0203	yeah
S0202	like because he always have a band but he be never like as cocky as he be until he come become the arctic monkey
S0203	right
S0202	so he become cocky after soon as they get their first big kig gig they get on the erm bbc radio live as like a new starter band as soon as he do that he become cocky

S0202	but you're not cocky you're not you've not change
S0203	i like to think i won't but people can get the wrong impression from you just from one one performance and that if you if you say the wrong thing like cos you've get to remember as well you know him quite well so you obviously get quite a good judge of him
S0202	mm
S0203	but if i perform once in thirty er in a thirty minute set all anyone's ever gonna see of me there might be twenty people there they might all watch me and i might say one bad thing like that i didn't really mean and it might make a last impression
S0202	or it might come across
S0203	and they might just think of him as oh it's that arsehole after that one night
S0202	yeah but i know him personally and he be always cocky
S0203	right
S0202	and as soon as he become well he didn't he didn't become famous he erm he get on bbc and he have his erm first music video first single
S0203	right
S0202	and that as soon as his video be finish record that's when he become cocky like i'm fuck better than you you're a cunt like fuck off sort of thing and like he be just
S0203	i've hear stories like that about him as well he's cocky
S0202	he he use to be a nice guy but go on go fuck leave midway conversation
