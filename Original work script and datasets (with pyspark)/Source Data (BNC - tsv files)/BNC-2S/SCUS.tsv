S0619	yep
S0618	don't drink enough
S0619	i be do health and fitness yesterday and discussion club and one of the question be i drink several

S0618	yeah
S0619	like how much water do you drink i be like three litres four litres
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	two two big bottle
S0618	yeah i reckon erm
S0619	plus tea plus coffee plus
S0618	a minimum of five pints of water a day
S0619	mm
S0618	cos i just keep fill up my pint glass and i be talk to about this and cos i i say you know i like that you drink water he drink a pint of water during a one hour lesson and i do as well and i be say you know i like that you do that i say today i probably have or will have about eight of these and he nearly fell off the sofa you know he say eight you know couldn't quite
S0619	they think it's crazy i think it's because they don't drink tap water
S0618	yeah
S0619	so if you're drink so much water and you're buy bottle or
S0618	ah
S0619	these big gallony things
S0618	yeah
S0619	then it's like but you're waste money when you could have tea which be from the tap boil
S0618	yeah
S0619	and be okay to drink
S0618	weird
S0619	i've be drink tap water here and i've not die yet so i really
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	it's safe to drink
S0618	yeah i be drink tap water in krakow which be probably a lot worse with all the industrial stuff
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and it be fine that be for five weeks
S0619	yeah
S0618	and then here i've there be a little brita filter still in the house so i use that
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	erm which be fine and then oh this i'm really excite by this on monday i'm get a up delivery of a little water filter that's like a mobile one
S0619	oh nice
S0618	it weigh a kilo and it's about a foot twelve inch high erm but you can filter even river water
S0619	nice
S0618	and it's get a carbon filter that last on average eleven years before it need to be replace
S0619	that's incredible
S0618	now it's a hundred and fifty quid
S0619	uhu okay
S0618	but i figure eleven years worth of not buy plastic bottle water while travel
S0619	uhu
S0618	out and about and don't know what water quality's like
S0619	yeah
S0618	happy days
S0619	yeah
S0618	so yeah and erm as part of the promotion you get a free in invert commas er plastic gym bottle now i don't like plastic bottle
S0619	mm
S0618	i have the metal sigg bottle as you know but it promise faithfully that there's no leakage of any
S0619	mm
S0618	nasty chemicals
S0619	mm
S0618	and that's also get a filter in it
S0619	oh that's good
S0618	bloody brilliant so i'm just amaze
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	that the technology be there these days
S0619	yeah
S0618	to have this mobile affordable
S0619	mm
S0618	relatively lightweight thing you can stick in a rucksack
S0619	yeah
S0618	and take anywhere
S0619	lot of well a few of my friends have these filter gym bottle
S0618	i hate those
S0619	i don't know if they work or
S0618	yeah
S0619	how good the the filter be
S0618	with the little knobby thing
S0619	it's like a bobbly thing yeah yeah
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	but er no i don't know
S0618	when i stay with in australia he buy me one of those and it be just the whole plastic bottle thing
S0619	mm
S0618	i couldn't get around i mean the temperature be about forty degrees while i be there so that could've be part of it so
S0619	mm
S0618	wherever your bottle be even in the shade it be just
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	warm and plasticky and not good
S0619	uhu
S0618	so yeah yeah i think
S0618	warm water in a metal bottle still taste not as bad as warm water
S0619	uhu
S0618	in a plastic bottle but anyway we'll see so i'm excite by that because when i've be sort of er you know i don't know if necessarily i'll be live in the van i probably won't but when i've be erm i have a tour around ireland for about a month and live in the van this be go back a year or two now might even've be a couple of years i suppose and the biggest problem i have be well one shower so need to find somewhere to shower every fourth day usually
S0619	mm
S0618	erm and get clean drink water
S0619	mm
S0618	and quite often like if you have a meal somewhere they didn't mind fill up a big
S0619	yeah
S0618	thing for you but my van hold i think it's about twenty litres
S0619	mm
S0618	which be fantastic
S0619	mm
S0618	erm so now i can fill that up and just filter off from that what i need
S0619	what you need
S0618	in the van so
S0619	mm
S0618	water be not a problem and theoretically i'm gonna be somewhere warm enough i've get a little erm plastic bag with a small solar panel on it
S0619	mm
S0618	so it heat the water so you fill the bag with water leave it outside the van in the sun and you can shower off of that
S0619	oh that's
S0618	so theoretically both issue solve
S0619	yeah solve
S0618	yeah and i've invest in a actually my brother and my niece buy me it for christmas or give me money for it erm a little solar panel that erm then charge a little power bank
S0619	mm
S0618	and then i can plug usb devices
S0619	nice
S0618	into that so so i should have shower clean water and solar power for charge the phone erm on the road which i'm really please about
S0619	mm easy happy days
S0618	yeah it's cool
S0619	happy days this mother over here it's her daughter's birthday and there's load of little girls and they're have their you know birthday party in upstairs which i think be sort of the least child friendly place

S0619	it's just the worst thing
S0619	just wanna
S0618	aren't other culture fun
S0619	like so like i just don't get it i just don't get it
S0618	yeah
S0619	i can't imagine english people do that
S0618	no
S0619	i know people who have these sort of professional studio photos do
S0618	mm
S0619	er and it's like you know these awful ones with white background and they're all like lie on the grind with their head like this
S0618	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0619	and you just think oh for god's sake stop
S0618	yeah
S0618	i have a job for a week sell those
S0619	do you
S0618	yeah i work up in in this tiny upstairs hovel work for portrait studio the largest portrait studio in the world and
S0619	what be that fact
S0618	well apparently so erm i presume there be so many franchise that's probably the issue
S0619	mm uhu
S0618	and er over the course of a week it be torture erm cold call basically have people tell you to fuck off or you know
S0619	mm
S0618	all the sort of things that i no longer say to people when they cold call me erm yeah and i manage to sell one portrait package which be to a woman that i'd work with five years previously
S0618	so yeah that be quite amuse
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah i hat that job and i promise myself i would never ever ever again work in sales
S0619	mm
S0618	and i haven't yeah i've do retail sales but then
S0619	it's not the same
S0618	always with the attitude of i ignore target i don't engage with target
S0619	yeah and those people would buy the stuff anyway

S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah

S0618	i think these professional photos part of that might even be a like central european thing or a
S0619	do you think
S0618	mainland europe thing yeah cos i know friends in germany do it as well and erm it be one of my one to ones actually young polish guy be do his er get his provisional drive licence and he have to have an ear show

S0618	to show you have ears yeah you have to have this shoot that's like
S0619	from the side
S0618	yeah almost from the side
S0619	mm
S0618	you still need to see both
S0619	yeah
S0618	your eye and everything but you have to show an ear and i think that's really common and also they attach photograph to cvs here

S0619	uhu okay
S0618	so it's like they've have to pay for the equipment but
S0619	yeah er well i've get a photo on my cv for teach but it isn't a professional it's just like a picture of me on a night out like just my face
S0619	so you can't see it it's just like my face look happy

S0619	mm
S0618	so when they open up this friday saturday sunday in the upstairs of the build that's the cd that be leave from last weekend i think that's what's happen
S0619	mm and this yeah yes there's still lot of valentine's stuff everywhere
S0618	mm half price
S0619	half price
S0618	yeah
S0618	lot of heart shape chocolates about
S0619	i know i've really not have a lot of chocolate recently apart from this erm i don't know this really dark one with the coffee bean coffee flavour to it
S0618	oh at
S0619	yeah it's dead expensive it's like ten złoty at the bar
S0618	yeah i think that's fair enough though i think
S0619	yeah
S0618	i never mind pay for food or drink if it's of really good quality
S0619	yeah yeah and it because it's quite expensive it make me sort of slow down eat it
S0618	yeah
S0619	not really but it not really at all i'm lie
S0619	but
S0618	i find with chocolate of that quality i can't handle more than a couple of square at a time
S0619	mm
S0618	cos i get such a cocoa high
S0619	mm
S0618	and i i find er it's also like erm cup of tea i can't have even a square of proper chocolate after six o'clock at night
S0619	mm
S0618	or i'm up all night
S0618	jeez i think that's happy birthday isn't it
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah be interest if i do get this farm job because erm they have group visit the farm to learn about organic stuff et cetera et cetera and as an offshoot they like to have natives to teach local children a bite of english no i know
S0619	no
S0618	ah i do say i be very well i be diplomatically honest in my introductory letter and say i have no experience of children i didn't say i positively dislike them
S0619	mm
S0618	erm but yeah i say i have no experience of children and erm
S0619	not even of teach children just of children in general
S0618	no i have no experience of children in general full stop
S0619	uhu uhu
S0618	i mean i have a niece
S0618	i sort of ignore her until she be old enough to hold a proper conversation erm never hold her when she be a baby in fact yeah i be round a friend's house a few months back in northern ireland so it must've be before i no yeah it must've be before i leave must've be about august time and be introduce to her baby granddaughter and she just sort of plonk this thing
S0619	oh no i've never i've never hold a child
S0618	in my arm it's like shit what do i do now you know
S0619	bite like hugh grant in about a boy
S0618	exactly like hugh grant in about a boy
S0618	okay er there's a live thing on me
S0618	it's not a cat what do i do with it yeah
S0619	that's funny
S0618	so i dunno but then i be sort of kind of philosophical about it and think maybe it's about time that i just face this morbid fear of young people
S0619	mm
S0618	and i mean you know you do get the occasional young person that i can relate to there's erm another time i stay on island just north of northern ireland it's part of northern ireland but it's an island off the north and erm some friends have their niece come and stay while we be stay on the island and she be about seven at the time and apparently completely latch onto me although i didn't notice erm and sort of follow me about and things like that and i saw her again when i be over for the funeral and she's a wonderful young woman
S0618	we be able to have er you know quite grow up conversations about travel and
S0619	mm
S0618	really engage with her but i didn't really notice that she be there erm at the time although at mealtimes i do remember converse with her and it wasn't as painful as i expect it to be
S0619	mm
S0618	be alright but i think that probably say as much and more about her
S0619	mm
S0618	er cos i think she's always be quite able to
S0619	mm
S0618	you know hold a lucid conversation even at a young age so
S0619	mm mm mm yeah i think it erm if you're an only child
S0618	mm
S0619	i think it help if you be always
S0618	yeah
S0619	around adults it help mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	whereas kid who grow up with brothers and sisters stay younger
S0618	ah
S0619	because they be leave to their own devices they don't have any they don't have any as much adult contact because they have each other
S0618	interest
S0619	whereas if you're an only child or there's huge age gap between siblings
S0618	yeah nine and a half years between me and my brother
S0619	mm yeah if there's a huge age gap then you would spend more time with adults i think that sibling
S0618	make sense mm
S0619	so that's my theory
S0618	yeah
S0619	on children
S0618	yes i mean i'm sure they're very nice
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	i i think eleven upwards be okay any younger than that
S0618	yeah
S0619	and there's not a lot go on and it depend on upbringing and where they're from some these kid in for example they be twelve or thirteen and there's this boy he'll be maybe thirteen this year he's italian but he live in france i think he live in paris and he can speak erm well he can speak italian and french he can speak dutch i think and english be his fourth language
S0618	wow
S0619	and he get an a at fce and he's twelve
S0618	oh my god as be like rock horse shit aren't they
S0619	mm at twelve years old
S0618	goodness me
S0619	er and you know so it depend
S0618	wow
S0619	some of these kid be just frighten frighten
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm but they come from money and like not just a bite rich
S0618	yeah
S0619	like the super rich
S0618	yeah
S0619	the world's super richest children erm i be look at the fee for this school they've put the fee up erm
S0618	they should put your wag up then
S0619	well i've get a two hundred pound bonus so i'm not complain
S0619	erm but two weeks at this school to send one child for two weeks it's two and a half thousand pound
S0618	woah
S0619	to send
S0618	how much of that do you see
S0619	erm
S0618	one child
S0619	yeah er well i see one child yeah
S0619	i get one child to pay
S0618	yeah
S0619	uhu
S0618	that's crazy
S0619	erm for a month and a lot of them come for a month five thousand pound
S0618	wow no discount for do extra
S0619	no discount for do it longer no
S0618	crikey
S0619	some of them send a whole family you can have three or four kid from the same family
S0618	yeah i guess if money's no object then why not
S0619	but imagine have and it's i mean it's not throw away money
S0618	i mean if i have children and i have money
S0619	you would
S0618	i'd probably spend it to have them away from me as much as possible
S0619	yeah there's this girl
S0618	yeah
S0619	who i've know for the last couple of years erm from russia
S0618	mm
S0619	er she spend five weeks in
S0618	mm
S0619	and five weeks in bulgaria at tennis camp and that's her summer holiday she doesn't see her parent
S0618	wow goodness me
S0619	her father i think be she's i don't know twelve or thirteen her er her father be in his sixties i think
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm and she's quite close to her sister who's in her thirties
S0618	yeah
S0619	so her sister come and visit her sister live in but this kid she's just like ship away
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i think they probably a lot of them live at board school as well
S0618	yeah so actually yeah i think i'd just not have children rather than pay to get rid of them
S0619	yeah pay to have someone else look after them
S0618	yeah
S0619	have nannies
S0618	yeah
S0619	send them to board school send them to a different country on summer holiday
S0618	yeah yeah yeah craziness
S0619	but
S0618	no i think my issue with children particularly young children it's a bite like i can sort of relate it to dog as well you know with dog it's there's a level of unconsciousness that do my head in you know when they're just bark
S0619	mm
S0618	and they're off their head they're not really focus on what's go on
S0619	yeah
S0618	in well at least reality as i perceive it and i see a lot of children do that as well
S0619	uhu
S0618	if it's like they're be like a cat when it's chase a leaf so it's like so focus
S0619	focus on something
S0618	in that now moment it's have a lot of fun that i can engage with
S0619	mm
S0618	but quite often there's just like a lot of bullshit chatter and squeal that
S0619	mm
S0618	remind me of a dog that's just bark its head off
S0619	mm
S0618	so if they're be like a cat fine if they're be like a dog no
S0619	yeah mm
S0618	irritate as hell get them out of my face
S0619	mm mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	i think a lot of er i don't know i think a lot of people really kind of er baby children too much
S0618	mm
S0619	like i've work with people who you know they have this sort of primary school teacher voice and it's all very soft and sweet and er you know as soon as they can talk they can talk to them like they're actual
S0618	yeah
S0619	i think the the younger that you talk to them like adults
S0618	yeah
S0619	then the sort of the better
S0618	that i don't mind so much you know if i if there's a a small person and i can have a grow up conversation with them
S0619	mm
S0618	then that
S0619	mm
S0618	you know that i can handle
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah that's alright
S0619	i think yeah as early as possible to start to take the piss out of them a little bite
S0619	just train them up for life that's my advice
S0618	yeah
S0619	in my experience with er children and teenagers
S0618	yeah
S0619	just take the piss as much as you can they like it they do they do
S0618	well that's engagement so
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah
