S0327	oh we we know you're capable of it be be you gonna be arsed be the be the question
S0326	yeah it be the question
S0327	you know what i would say i would say it's worth it erm if if you can do it er cos i mean get it you know you be in a very special position have have the wherewithal to do it not everybody do and i suspect a first will stand you well in stead in various whatever happen in your life
S0326	yeah well er it's just sort of satisfy as well
S0327	and it's satisfy exactly erm
S0326	like if you do something you might as well do it i mean
S0327	well be you enjoy it
S0326	yeah i enjoy i like it i like the work and stuff
S0327	that's nice

S0326	yeah
S0327	and you're please with your tutor
S0326	yeah they're all good
S0327	well i'm very glad to hear it cos you know really doesn't have a very good time with her tutor she find them incredibly difficult to get hold of
S0326	yeah
S0327	and not very helpful
S0326	mm
S0327	and you know both her mum and i have say look you're pay nine thousand a year you wanna get your
S0326	demand yeah
S0327	money's worth
S0326	cos also lot of
S0327	but she's also find the work i think she work she probably have to work harder than you do to to get as far but erm i think she's also find it interest
S0326	yeah she er erm message me the other week cos she's do a a dissertation about beekeeping in the
S0327	i think yeah
S0326	in the ancient mediterranean
S0327	i think that's really interest
S0326	so i be tell her some texts er sort sort of cos the romans be really obsess with be
S0327	be they
S0326	yeah
S0327	be they
S0326	they think they could they they think you could sort of tell you know sort of augury with bird they do the same thing with be
S0327	do they
S0326	yeah and then virgil write a whole sort of book of poetry about be he say they're like er
S0327	well i think it'd be really great if she can put together a thesis on that
S0326	yeah
S0327	because erm i mean i suppose there be some be there some complete what's happen there
S0326	oh it get smash up
S0327	erm well she ought we ought to pick your brain then
S0326	yeah i mean yeah they really like them and they be interest in them and they think they can they think if they sort of if there's a swarm of be they it mean so and so's gonna happen er you know
S0327	i don't think we've get any further erm much since then
S0327	you know i would just as soon put my faith in a swarm of be as i would in the in the weather forecast these days frankly erm yes no i think that's that's really really good and i mean the the best thing be to of course to be interest
S0326	yeah
S0327	erm and what do you have to choose a thesis or be you
S0326	erm i don't have i mean i probably will do a dissertation next year but i haven't i can't really think of something to do it about erm i'll probably do something er sort of reception you know like sort of reception theory
S0327	no what's reception theory
S0326	it's kind of like just the way you i think it it just make classics sort of relevant to me the way you interpret er instead of try to think like a roman you think like a sort of someone from the twenty first century when you read the texts so it's sort of like book like like homer in the twentieth century how to interpret differently
S0327	do they say twelve minutes for this twelve minutes
S0326	ah
S0327	oh i'm just try to get my head round that
S0326	so it's just the way sort of it's it's really sort of simple it's just the way you respond to something it's the way you receive it
S0327	yes
S0326	but it's in classics it's interest because there's sort of a so if you look at homer people have be receive that sort of all the way through from like roman to from greek to roman to the middle age to now and it's i think it's it's counter intuitive if you think everybody's response respond the same way to things erm
S0327	er you mean everybody within a or everybody over a very long period
S0326	over sort of it make it make the the work sort of you you can like free it from its position er and and sort of rework it and look at it new
S0327	and look at it new yes well i mean to some extent we do that anyhow don't we
S0326	yeah it's it's that's why it's like sort of simple but
S0327	yes
S0326	i i just think it's a bite it's helpful to think erm try and get into the mindset of of sort of greek and romans but it's not
S0327	yes
S0326	the it's not the end all and be all
S0327	right i mean you know it seem to me that politically a lot of stuff people think oh they shouldn't have do this or they shouldn't have you know you take something like i don't know anti semitism well anti semitism say in the early nineteenth century
S0326	mm
S0327	er be go to be er see very differently from the way it be now
S0326	yeah
S0327	and lot of people can't do that they can't make that leap erm you know there's erm a that's that's one of the things i didn't like about postmodernism when it come in or or literary theory that that everything be judge from the viewpoint now er i mean i'm talk about within art so you take someone like gauguin and you would deconstruct and look at him in term of colonialism and so on but actually that really wasn't his fault
S0326	yeah
S0327	that be the world he be bear into he why would he have take much notice of that he be an artist so you can't say these paint aren't any good or not to be take seriously or we dismiss them erm because they be politically doubtful
S0326	yeah and so it er kind of keep things alive because they're not really fix
S0327	not er they're not fix very little be fix
S0326	it's interest yeah exactly which be just sort of it's i think it's it free you up from kind of sort of lot of academic stuff you try and fit things into little straightjackets
S0327	yes
S0326	erm and i think it's just more interest and more more good to think with like more sort of give your er your own ideas
S0327	well i know that at some point a few months ago say that what they what they want from them in their what be she in her third year be a personal view of er
S0326	yeah
S0327	and i think actually for archaeology that be really difficult i mean how can you have a i can see what you're do you know in a way things be more general erm because you're look at the way that all society respond to things but for archaeology when you're talk about artefacts which have be scientifically
S0326	yeah
S0327	and chemically date and so on how be you suppose to be original about that
S0326	it's not easy really
S0327	i mean i think those tudors be just bore and they've come up with they want to be entertain a bite
S0326	but they might ask people to do that because it's it's more it's more interest for yourself as well
S0327	yes
S0326	instead of just copy things out of book
S0327	exactly otherwise you know er erm and you know 's get a rather pierce and original mind and er but she can also just absorb facts you can both do that in a way i never could it's very very impressive how's get on
S0326	he's er i think he's alright he's actually i saw him last night he's in
S0327	right
S0326	erm i think he's i think i think he's sort of finish for the year
S0327	oh have he
S0326	i mean he have like a sort of study period that he er and then do exams i think
S0327	right
S0326	but i think his sort of tuition have end already
S0327	okay really and we're only in march
S0326	well it end er or it end in end in good friday
S0327	and be he suppose to do stuff on his own
S0326	yeah i think they er i think he'll he'll have work to do but he doesn't have to be in necessarily
S0327	right and have he get over be dump
S0326	dunno
S0327	you don't know
S0327	you don't know if there's a new girlfriend on the scene
S0326	erm i don't know if there be should be

S0327	sea
S0326	what sea
S0327	yes
S0326	pacific ocean
S0327	pacific
S0326	there's not enough in there anymore and then he spend the whole time be sick
S0327	seasick oh there's nothing worse than that be there so it be rocky
S0326	yeah well it be a bite sort of like that
S0327	i only have to think of a ship boat and i get seasick it's really horrible
S0326	yeah
S0327	when i be first with your grandad erm we use to often go to france by boat three hour trip and one erm on one occasion i remember i felt so awful and i go downstairs to the loo and the boat i didn't realize that the boat dock completely empty and i hear this pathetic voice call my name outside the door
S0327	and i be sit kneel with my head in the loo and it be call where be you
S0327	apparently a lot of sailors get seasick for the first twenty four hours cos use to erm be a skipper
S0326	right
S0327	er for a while and he say for the first twenty four hours he be usually he be usually sick
S0326	yeah and er sort of once you've be on a boat for age get back onto land
S0327	yes yes but that's slightly better well it doesn't seem natural to me and your social life be still in rather than
S0326	yeah mainly i mean it's er i've i've get friends in
S0327	who have you make friends with
S0326	just sort of sort of the same people as last year but like one sort of quite good friend erm and then there's sort of i dunno if you ever meet erm who go to he's
S0327	there's only one there's only one friend of yours i remember meet
S0326	so er he's er he's it's funny to to be at school with him again because we go different place for sixth form and he's er in the year above
S0327	and he's at now
S0326	yeah
S0327	and what's he do
S0326	at the same college
S0327	at the same college
S0326	yeah
S0327	right do that give you a bond erm be in the same school
S0326	yeah but it's funny it's sort of just like erm sort of start off together and then finish together
S0327	that's interest what do he want to do
S0326	i don't know i i think he'd make a really good sort of leave leave wing little bite corrupt mayor of london you know sort of wheeler dealer he do politics
S0327	right
S0326	but he's you know he's quite er
S0327	we've get perfectly good leave wing actually no perfectly good corrupt mayor now don't think we ever want another not leave wing
S0326	erm but but he's he's erm corrupt for sort of big business you know
S0327	be he
S0326	erm er my friend be be er quite i think quite passionate about leftist politics on
S0327	so who's he gonna vote for
S0326	dunno probably green
S0327	what i haven't work out be what happen if you vote for green
S0327	cos that's what i i mean i can't bring myself to vote for any of the others what be you gonna vote
S0326	i don't know really
S0327	it's difficult isn't it
S0326	yeah
S0327	i mean the green of course it won't make any difference they won't get in and if they do get in it would be
S0326	well they might get a seat somewhere i mean they do have seat
S0327	they might get a couple of seat er which which would be good
S0326	i mean it'd be good if they get quite a few seat and then they could do a coalition with labour and sort of that would be like a good
S0327	yes
S0326	erm
S0327	and people keep say that you know look what happen when they have the council in brighton the there be a huge mess in brighton er
S0327	you know they couldn't get the rubbish clear or anything
S0326	yeah
S0327	it's a very it's a rather unpolitical period it seem to me i'm just try to finish this really very interest book which i doubt if you have read by somebody call victor klemperer have you ever er have you hear of klemperer's diaries he wasn't the conductor he be a distant cousin of er of otto klemperer the cousin and he be jewish but he be marry to an aryan and he stay one of the very few who stay in germany throughout the whole war and he keep a diary from between nineteen thirty three and i think something like nineteen fifty nine so you can imagine how long that be
S0326	yeah
S0327	i get it on kindle so at least i can a lot of it's very bore
S0327	erm but i imagine the book must be this big erm so i i read through the whole war period which be rather terrify i mean it be you know er he do he manage to survive that and then he decide after the war to to move to the to east berlin and i'm just now read the bite where it's it's er you know they're put up the the wall and so on erm but it's very interest read about and he be erm an academic he be erm sort of eighteenth century french literary that be his that be his erm his subject erm and he's try to sort things out in east germany to get himself a position to get publish again all that so you you know you you get a sense of the build up in the from the late forties
S0326	mm
S0327	early fifties i think haven't quite get to the early fifties yet erm and everything be political every time he eat a sandwich or take a piss it's political one way or the other
S0326	yeah
S0327	it's it's so extraordinary so utterly unlike society here
S0326	yeah i wonder if that's if er if that's sort of something that place have to go through like sort of grow pain where everything be political and it kind of cos if you think about the like in the middle east now it's sort of not that sort of different from europe
S0326	in erm in the twentieth century
S0327	well it's difficult to know what politics mean in the middle east isn't it
S0326	yeah
S0327	i mean it's all such a nightmare it's it's a nightmare i'll tell you what the the pizzas be ready but while it cool down if you can just clear this thing for me and then yours actually look rather good
S0327	just pop into the studio it's actually to do with 's bank account what happen be that for you know when i go through those years when i pay you all erm some money at christmas
S0326	yeah
S0327	erm and then recently a while ago i pay her something and i inadvertently pay it into that account the so it er er luckily they they they send it away but of course it be terribly confuse
S0326	yeah
S0327	erm so now i want to get her i've get her bank detail here let me just get it up i want to delete what i've get of hers and erm and i can't er find a way of delete it
S0326	so you want to delete
S0327	i'll show you let me just get in there er log in
S0326	wait wait just er click okay
S0327	oh
S0326	er it doesn't
S0327	do i say okay
S0326	yeah
S0327	right log in okay so now i want to do a payment and transfer make a payment or transfer from there now if i go to
S0326	mm
S0327	there be two
S0326	right
S0327	one be and they both be with me as well and i think that go back to the so i what i'd like to do be delete those two and do a whole new one but if i click on it then it just come up that i want to pay the money in it
S0326	mm
S0327	could i delete
S0326	i mean you could this one and just call it something different
S0327	but er when i do what can i call it different because the thing be though it's the same it's the same account i mean maybe this be alright
S0326	what happen when you click on it it doesn't tell doesn't say which be which
S0327	doesn't say which account
S0326	tut yeah it's a bite of a nuisance isn't it
S0327	you see what i mean
S0326	yeah but you couldn't just make a new one
S0327	well if i do you see er then it say i've already get that i'll show you name of the person or company i can't put a different name because
S0326	no
S0327	it's a bank account so account number be
S0326	but you could do you could sort of do like so you can remember it
S0327	i do that on the other one i could do new which i try
S0326	yeah
S0327	so i know it's new their account number be and the sort code be and the reference if i put i've already get that in the other i don't think it'll make any difference then add payee i don't know what that mean add payee
S0326	add it
S0327	look see you already have a payment instruction set up for this payee
S0326	mm i don't really know how to cos there's no sort of way to edit the list of what you have
S0327	no that's exactly you don't think if i go back
S0326	just click click the x instead
S0327	right
S0326	first click cancel
S0327	cancel erm from er do you think if i ah now that's
S0327	but i didn't oh no let's see er i mean what er why be that like that there and it's if i click on that
S0326	so erm one of those be the and one be
S0327	i think so and i just don't know which i don't can't go through all that hassle again could i go edit and delete
S0326	i don't know how to edit to get into that list though that's the which be the thing
S0327	it doesn't say delete do it cos whatever name i put
S0326	yeah it'll be the same
S0327	be the same what can i do
S0326	i suppose what the one what you have to do be maybe just sort of do a transfer of sort of two pound to both and see what what happen sort of communicate and then remember which be the right one
S0327	erm ah but i won't i'll only know if it doesn't go into her account
S0326	yeah but if you just give so you just you give two pound to both of the account and see which
S0327	ah which get that's a good idea okay
S0326	and then er like call
S0327	so
S0326	but i dunno if you would need to do it sort of
S0327	shall i do it one at a time
S0326	yeah i think so let's make a like write down
S0327	make a note
S0326	and then ask
S0327	yes so it's be send to stroke it usually go fairly immediately doesn't it
S0326	mm
S0327	she won't be thrill to get two pound
S0327	next two pound
S0326	wait wait actually this be useful
S0327	ah
S0326	because it tell you er when you click next which be which so that's the right one
S0327	do you think that's the right one
S0326	cos it's the same as this right
S0327	yes ah it be isn't it
S0326	so so maybe if you just sort of trial and error and go back and see if the other one be different
S0327	oh yes okay maybe they're both okay now who know alright so this be then let's try that one that's
S0326	yeah
S0327	two pound next
S0326	see that's something else
S0327	that's something else
S0326	so that's the one you wanna remember
S0327	okay
S0326	not to send money to
S0327	that's great so that's brilliant erm now if i could mark that and write something on it no i can't
S0326	i mean there must be a way to remove people from that list
S0327	delete that
S0326	no that won't work
S0327	no it doesn't delete
S0326	maybe if i just do a quick google search er it'll tell me
S0327	okay do a quick google search and otherwise i'll do this later because at least i know be the be the okay one i suppose one could just ask how to delete name from
S0326	yeah
S0327	at least i've get that erm and we're delete
S0326	erm down
S0326	delete this one
S0327	we're delete that
S0326	how do i know where do she go erm
S0327	that that one we're delete
S0326	right
S0327	great alright that's wonderful theni'll i'll do it all later thank you that's absolutely great
S0326	that's alright
S0327	erm let me just show you something that that will er interest you if you keep sit there i can erm this be my friend who's become a very very successful artist he's very clever erm and where be it and oh other artists the approach i just go to see it yesterday er three three big let's see if we can get them up singularly and they're call no he's call them the projectionists erm and it's it's actually it's base er do you remember when you send me the stuff from pliny about the origin of paint
S0326	mm
S0327	except when we discuss it be the origin of er the line
S0326	line yeah
S0327	line draw and this be he's he's do these erm about the inauguration of the history of pictorial representation in which projection and the fix of shadow be always interconnect from paint to photography and cinema they're they're very big enormous silkscreen and they really be rather interest
S0326	mm
S0327	erm one more that i like a lot where's the other one go this one be be it's rather fascinate you know big
S0326	yeah
S0327	this sort of size and then i email him to say that i'd be and er and and mention this and then he write this morning erm he er say it it it should be the origins of draw but he describe it pliny describe it as the source of paint paint be literally the daughter of pottery or craft the other in ambiguity be that we don't know whether her lover return from war or whether the thick shadow represent the dead the shade or whether it's a visual prayer to reunification of the body
S0326	write about certain paint or in
S0327	er this this be
S0326	er shadow in general
S0327	cos i say erm da da da da i i write i know the ancient story differently that dibutades have draw a line round the shadow of her lover and thus create the first line that's what you tell me
S0326	erm i dunno if i i think i just show you where where it be cos i haven't read that before
S0327	oh oh maybe you give me a reference that's possible so he's take that he's not say it's the first line but it's the shadow of the first paint which be rather interest isn't it
S0326	but er yeah yeah it be er cos i think i remember that that one thing i er talk to you about be sort of who could be who could draw the thinnest line
S0327	yes
S0326	there's this like this lot of stories about sort of artistic one er one upmanship between competitive painters er sort of try to trick each other so someone draw a curtain and
S0327	yes
S0326	try to get the other artist to open the curtain that be a paint
S0327	yes yes
S0326	erm things like that
S0327	well i'll show you a fine line i've just i'm do these new paint of get as about as fine as i i just this morning finish the two red ones you could give me your opinion
S0326	yeah i quite like them
S0327	what
S0326	i quite like them
S0327	yes people do seem to respond to them which do you like best out of the two reds can you see the second division in that one
S0326	yeah
S0327	that's what i'm not certain about i actually think it's better without i make a technical mistake so i be rectify it by do the second one and i don't think it quite work
S0326	yeah it might be one division but i feel like it when it's sort of barely discernible shade
S0327	yes
S0326	if you see what so i sort of i i think er i would like it better as a mix of that and that if you see so one line but closer tone
S0327	closer tone than these
S0326	yeah
S0327	okay well i think i've get to destroy this and do another one so i think that if i can locate the paper cut out that's probably what i will do
S0326	i like this one too
S0327	yeah i think i i think that's good i
S0326	yeah
S0327	i also rather like that one erm i'm i'm i'm enjoy do these and look at this one he say oh you're go narrative
S0327	and it's true cos there be a narrative element cos i'm do so badly professionally and i think i might as well do paint nobody can see
S0327	erm if they're not gonna look at them anyhow they might mean er just as well be nothing for them to see okay let's go
S0326	er that's nice i really like that i think that's a nice
S0327	yes yes
S0326	that's good
S0327	i'm please cos i'm oh i've get to choose a load to show at the which be almost like throw them away

S0327	do he
S0326	i think so
S0327	this be not sibling jealousy of mum's new boyfriend

S0327	i know but they be children
S0327	i mean now she's get a real bloke
S0326	yeah
S0327	i have to admit i really take to him
S0326	yeah he be he be charm
S0327	he's he's charm he's he's bright isn't he
S0326	yeah
S0327	but what i don't know and of course you know your mum she won't tell me anything erm i'll tell you what okay there's mass leave here so you can start with that erm be his work i mean i talk to him a bite about it but only very very loosely but i er you know he have no professional he's obviously decide not to erm compete with the world professionally

S0326	yeah he go to a bat bar mitzvah yesterday
S0327	i mean that have really surprise me
S0326	not only be he jewish he's really jewish
S0327	well he say he grow up erm in a community in i think either or i can't remember
S0326	in i think
S0327	with only it's three thousand jews and that's all so he have not quite escape that
S0326	what do you mean
S0327	and i wanna know what he do that's what i want to know and i i couldn't quite be rude enough to say what do you actually do
S0326	yeah i don't really know
S0327	you don't know
S0326	catch it
S0327	yes i do
S0327	that be clever wasn't it
S0326	erm cos i know he have quite sort of quite a lot of property and things

S0327	the children to tell me erm start well it strike me i have to say but don't repeat this to her that your mum have finally meet her match

S0326	mm
S0327	well it can't be easy for you and all this i mean it's not easy for either
S0326	what's that about

S0326	what be what be what's do you know what 's up to at the moment
S0327	yes he's get he's do something plan to do something really good he's plan to go with erm to south america for three months partly get a job there mm er and probably you know not probably if he can manage if he can take enough money with him not to have a job
S0326	yeah
S0327	erm and to go to however many countries they can go to well i think that's you know i'm all in favour of all you young people travel as much as you can early on i mean you've manage to do it anyhow
S0326	yeah
S0327	but it i mean it's be great the place you've be to oh hot erm so i think it'll be very very good for him i think he hasn't finally choose which place he's gonna go to he's he's get a couple of he's be offer
S0326	mm
S0327	and somewhere else but i think he may be wait to hear if he's get into college help yourself
S0326	it'll be good to go for him to go to south america probably
S0327	yeah i mean if he go somewhere like peru you've be to yes you've be to mexico
S0326	just to mexico yeah
S0327	right mm so where do you actually go

S0327	and they sell this do they this jewellery
S0326	i think so yeah
S0327	well
S0326	and it's sort of sort of it's sort of very cheap to live there and you know it's a good good sort of er base
S0327	right
S0326	sort of launch operations from
S0327	and how far from mexico city
S0326	erm it's about three hours north
S0327	right be it cold when you go
S0326	it's nice because it's really hot in the day and then cooler in the even
S0327	oh that's lovely
S0326	and then we rent a car and sort of drive to the coast to a place call which be a er a sort of a kind of tropical very like sort of run down not really any tourists but like find sort of find hotels cost like three pound a night or something yeah
S0327	mm
S0326	erm
S0327	how nice that there still be such place
S0326	on the sort of on the pacific coast
S0327	who do you go with remind me

S0327	mm
S0326	and athens maybe
S0327	ah but you haven't be to peru
S0326	no i mean i suppose that er mexico's not really south america it's central america
S0327	no be there any ancient sit there
S0326	in mexico
S0327	yeah
S0326	yeah there's lot of sort of you know those pyramid
S0327	oh yes they're wonderful
S0326	mm
S0327	they're clean those all up now aren't they i don't know anything about south america i've never actually be very attract to the culture
S0326	it's strange cos it's very like it's obviously it's very sort of catholic but it's like infuse with er something really sort of pagan it's like it's like really kind of pagan quality of catholicism and very like strange really colourful like in a church there'll be sort of bite like like halloween style
S0327	yeah
S0326	erm skeletons and
S0327	well i suppose that be exactly what it be it's a combination of what they get from the spanish
S0326	mm
S0327	plus their own i've see church in southern spain which be very peculiar because you know they they look as though they be originally spanish but then build by people who have be to south america who couldn't quite remember how they be
S0326	i go to a talk in the other week er quite interest about erm sort of neo latin epic so when the spanish go to the new world these people write epic poems about it in latin
S0327	oh really
S0326	and pretend to be sort of virgil erm so they all sort of the hero's always columbus
S0327	really you wouldn't have think that would be the case see that they make them suffer so much
S0327	i must say they be absolutely vile i mean the spanish do have a a reputation for terrible cruelty
S0326	yeah
S0327	i suppose it's different now you don't speak spanish
S0326	no kind of a nuisance
S0327	yeah
S0326	actually i sort of i wish i could speak more languages better don't really learn it in er in this
S0327	well i mean do think you've get a talent i mean you teach yourself greek if you have a talent you can probably
S0326	mm
S0327	teach yourself so you know german latin and greek well if you ask me that be a basis of so much
S0326	yeah well i i mean i know i don't really know german but i can talk it yeah
S0327	oh you pick german up you didn't
S0326	no i do it do it in school for gcse but i would struggle to read a german newspaper you know
S0327	german be terribly difficult erm that be how learn actually when he go to live there he learn by read newspapers and look word and i get very annoy by how good his german be but then he be there for thirty years so you you expect that
S0326	yeah
S0327	and you never do any french
S0326	not in school
S0327	do any french anymore
S0326	yeah i dunno i mean i do when i be with the other she know french so i i speak french with her a bite and learn a bite but
S0327	mm
S0326	like in i can speak french sort of in theory but as soon as i'm in france i get too sort of shy and er all come out wrong
S0327	it's it's yes and also they're rude they're not if you if you go to italy and just say good even they they say oh you know your italian's so wonderful and so marvellous and and you say good even in french they walk away if you haven't say it perfectly
S0326	i'm go to italy actually
S0327	but i think you can the younger you be the better
S0326	yeah i remember meet a child that like in in ibiza once who could like he be like five and speak five languages
S0327	er they be er it be astonish i'm not sure mm what that do i mean do it mean you can ever quite say what you want to say
S0326	mm
S0327	be you at home in all those languages
S0326	yeah it's interest er i i remember sort of read something about be bilingual sort of er be raise bilingually er erm open up i think the sort of synapses that aren't always erm aren't sort of engage er and you can't can't be engage any other way they think er people just think differently
S0327	well word sound the same word have very very different mean erm i mean german have both an incredible richness and a kind of brutality you know if you think of the the word for leg in german be which mean bone the word for meat be
S0326	mm
S0327	which mean flesh which be much cruder and more brutal isn't it erm but there be some word i just can't think of an example which which just much better just that much different even though we both only have that one
S0326	yeah
S0327	one word i personally think that swear in german be slightly more effective
S0327	but then that might be to do with how use to one be to people swear now you know like now it's common as muck but when i be young if you hear somebody say fuck it that be really shock i mean i personally think that be stronger than shit
S0326	yeah
S0327	if you make a mistake and you say oh shit but if you say it's somehow a bite shittier than
S0326	well yeah cos the interest thing this i i i doubt that germans say shit if you if you know what i'm say they just say all the time
S0327	yes
S0326	where in english people say both probably because the german one be more there's no need er if you're german to say shit cos you have
S0327	yes no they wouldn't say shit
S0326	but an english person might well say
S0327	do you think
S0326	yeah
S0327	no why would they
S0326	no just er they cos
S0327	only educate people like you
S0326	no i er you know i on even on like tv and stuff i've see people funny if they think it's i think it's sort of more in vernacular vocabulary than in in in in shit in german
S0327	it's true when i be young people would say
S0326	yeah
S0327	i haven't hear that for years can you press this down as well
S0326	mm maybe the top half of it
S0327	it's get chilli and tomatoes on and i'm not bigger half so what would you like to learn
S0326	erm i'd like to learn french and and german like properly
S0327	well i think you know you have latin and greek you're not gonna find french very difficult
S0326	no i mean i
S0327	i mean to learn to speak it really really well that's another thing
S0326	i find it easier actually to to read french than read german
S0327	my mother use to speak about five or six languages she and then i think actually no she take up russian in her fifties she say that russian be much easier than german i'm really sorry i didn't learn proper german but i speak the german of a twelve year old maybe a nine year old
S0326	mm
S0327	erm and then er also you need to so much you know we don't have grammar in in english do we so it's quite difficult to
S0326	yeah
S0327	i suppose you grasp that through greek and latin
S0326	well yeah i think it's er just like really er uninflected language be what they call it
S0327	it's a what
S0326	er uninflected
S0327	what be
S0326	english
S0327	english

S0327	do you have time for that
S0326	yeah probably but i i'll i'll i'll have to ask someone who's who's do it if it's any good

S0326	yeah
S0327	and you go there with no english speak people you go and get a job or something for a month

S0326	and then they have a problem with sort of tyrants erm they couldn't really make democracy work until the fifth century until the two these two this sort of er boyfriend pair lovers kill a tyrant but not er out of any political motivation just because the tyrant be make advance
S0327	be that right
S0326	that's really sort of where democracy in athens come from
S0327	how absolutely fascinate
S0326	i mean i actually write an essay about sort of why why the tut naked male body be so dominate so much classical sculpture and er i just basically kind of write a lot about erm cos there's a famous famous statues of those tyrant killers and they're naked and er and the idea that
S0327	what's his name
S0326	erm the tyrant or the killers they're call erm harmodius be one of them and i can't remember the other one
S0327	right
S0326	but erm i mean there be statues of them but erm sort of the whole ideology of erm democracy in athens be sort of root in sort of homoerotic desire it's like an erotic ideology somehow
S0326	because of because that's where the democracy come from sort of er an affair kill sort of crime of passion and then they cut and then they have
S0327	i've never hear that how fascinate
S0326	well it's not really it's just sort of
S0327	i mean i suppose it's not quite that simple
S0326	yeah that's like what i be
S0327	maybe it be
S0326	what i be write about sort of that's like the personal view thing i guess
S0327	so who be the couple
S0326	erm they be sort of just
S0327	power
S0326	yeah i think so sort of aristocratic erm youth one youth one young man
S0327	yes
S0326	and one older man
S0327	right and they be a couple and then the they get feed up with the tyrant
S0326	yeah who be but only not not sort of out of any political not or
S0327	no
S0326	maybe that be part of it but also the main reason why they kill him be because the tyrant be just sort of try to get off with the
S0327	with the younger one
S0326	with the younger one but then there be sort of erm er sort of hold up as erm sort of end end tyranny and bring democracy to athens so it be sort of gift give er public monuments which be didn't really have then up to that point so
S0327	oh didn't they
S0326	it wasn't very i mean they do but it be especially for sort of live people they weren't really it wasn't really er portraiture or or erm public sort of commemorative statues of er real life people
S0327	so that start also what in the
S0326	yeah
S0327	fifth century
S0326	about then yeah
S0327	maybe because there be some particularly skilled sculptors perhaps
S0326	well no well i it's i mean er portraiture really become a thing er sort of in the hellenistic period and it's interest when er
S0327	and that isn't couple of years a couple of hundred years later
S0326	yeah it sort of start at three two three bc
S0327	yeah i see i mean that two hundred years be actually quite a long time
S0326	yeah
S0327	if one think of of be er well it be and it isn't erm
S0326	but yeah er
S0327	oh i see so erm and this be in athens
S0326	yeah i mean it's not really er er like just er it's not that simple it's not just like of it but
S0327	no of course not
S0326	it's in er it's it's what i be think about when i do this essay sort of how cos the way that people when sort of pericles in his famous funeral oration he talk about sort of love the city but he use eros as in you're mean to love it's er it's er like er plato say you you need to love knowledge and you have to have eros for it it's all sort of erotic like i think eroticism be at sort of er the the core of a lot of er sort of deeper things about athenian life
S0327	erm do you think that it's possible that because those two be powerful they kind of er liberate homosexuality in some way they make it okay
S0326	in they didn't it wasn't really a problem with that in athens it be always okay it be er it be
S0327	it be always okay be it
S0326	it be er it be what you're it be sort of it be the norm it wasn't sort of deviant or like different but it's only it's
S0327	how do we know this
S0326	i i mean i don't know where you look but it's sort of just take
S0327	remind me when homer be
S0326	erm well it's write down sort of about eight hundred bc
S0327	homer be write at eight hundred bc as early as that
S0326	but i mean the stories be probably older like they're probably from
S0327	it be utterly fascinate isn't it
S0326	yeah
S0327	utterly fascinate cos we still don't really know how we emerge i mean the more and more i mean i don't really hardly read keep up with all that but it do seem as though we emerge pretty well with our behaviour pattern in already in place
S0326	yeah
S0327	rather than evolve i mean have we evolve psychologically we've certainly not evolve er for the better
S0326	mm yeah
S0327	er in some ways i mean there be an aspect of contemporary society where there be a place for empathy now in the last really since post world war two
S0326	yeah
S0327	but it's completely recent
S0326	i er yeah i just get er cos it's interest when you look at sort of east and west sort of this sort of the chinese wisdom or far eastern wisdom's totally different from greek
S0327	yes
S0326	and those be the two sort of modes of life or sort of pattern of existence that people operate in
S0327	yeah
S0326	and they come from sort of two small place
S0327	well i think we think that it's still probably just slightly more human to have a life in the west if you can ignore all the hundreds of war there have be i mean to me there be still something fairly horrendous about china i mean if you think of the live that most sort of the chinese must live now you know
S0326	yeah
S0327	work fifteen sixteen hours a day for for a pittance so you you know now they're get a a middle class and upper class but it do rather frighten me the think a lot of artists be go over there and they usually have a horrible time
S0326	yeah i mean there's that erm i watch a quite good documentary about apple and er sort of how they make their factories in china and stuff and they're just erm entire cities that be just factories sort of you live there and you work there with like twenty thousand people
S0327	apple like in apples
S0326	like er apple computers
S0327	oh apple computers
S0327	yes right oh really
S0326	erm and sort of really sort of strange existence of er sort of er these company set like they just sort of build out of nowhere whole towns but all they be be sort of factory and then place where people can sleep and then go back to work and people just sort of come from the countryside and live there
S0327	they come from the countryside cos they can't manage to
S0326	make enough money yeah
S0327	make make enough money to live
S0326	there be this
S0327	it's very frighten isn't it
S0326	yeah there be do i i haven't actually read them but there be this thing erm this one chinese factory worker he erm commit suicide and then erm sort of in his paper he he be a poet and he have write all these poems about sort of be a factory worker and sort of a bite very kinda orwellian sort of dystopic existence
S0327	i mean even if you've never know anything differently it be so against the grain so unnatural terrify well a lot of it's terrify right now honestly you know the middle east have just er vanish under a load of rubble now we've get isis erm want to take over the world and do rather well as far as one can see
S0326	yeah er
S0327	well with any luck it'll hold off for another ten years so that you and and will be too old to go and fight
S0326	i think it's a bite unfortunate erm there's the cos the goddess isis every time you er sort of her name be now be sort of overlay with
S0327	yes but of course it's get nothing to do with it have it
S0326	yeah nothing to do with it but it's just a sort of force
S0327	very it's awful when that happen i quite agree absolutely awful
S0326	especially when it's sort of talk be like sort of poems about someone like join the cult of isis and sort of find like religious like
S0327	oh it's it's it's terrible
S0326	erm
S0327	there be er quite a well know composer er i mean he's not so young anymore i don't know whether you've hear of him call he's very successful it's rather good music actually i suppose he's in his forties early forties and i have hear one or two piece go to a couple of concert a while ago and his mother who i just know to say hello to and have a brief chat very very nice and she's a er er er write on art erm and when i first meet her her name be and then they change it to after the whole aid epidemic
S0326	yeah
S0327	same thing well my friend who have this publish house and use to have a gallery he's just publish a book he have erm he's in his early fifties and he's a rather interest character gay and clever german and er he suddenly get cancer or suddenly be erm diagnose with cancer of the er thyroid and within a rather short time er he happen to be diagnose while he have three surgeons spend the weekend with him or something like that
S0327	so he have it all do privately and it be an eight hour operation he have a huge scar and one of his artists give him as a present erm recuperation time in
S0326	mm
S0327	and there's another person very very wealthy art dealer call i've forget his name who give him his credit card so that he could buy anything extra he want at
S0327	and he write this book about it now what happen be i he come out of hospital and he recover instantly
S0327	i mean fantastically strong man erm he's quite stocky not very tall erm and he go madly social he entertain about a hundred and twenty people a day in
S0327	erm and i didn't go to see him for about two weeks and i go in there about twelve o'clock for invite me for lunch and he start talk and he didn't shut his mouth for two hours when i leave afterwards and now of course that be mostly drug
S0327	must you know they must have pump him so full of drug and he say terrible things happen to him you know in that he he say for instance they'd bring his breakfast in on a trolley and he'd say i don't want breakfast on a trolley i want it on a tray
S0327	and the they'd lay the table for dinner and he'd say no i don't like those glass
S0327	i want different glass and so at the same time as do that he could also see himself do it and understand how er ridiculous that be and erm so he he then write he write a book about it he's get a dog call
S0327	and all the way through the dog through the through the book the the dog isn't name it's it's refer to as the bitch
S0327	and i say i see that be refer to as the bitch and he say yes he say i couldn't have have it otherwise i wouldn't have be able to say i drag through the foyer unwillingly she be roll her belly on the marble floor and that kind of thing so
S0327	er i think that's true rather useful you might quite enjoy it he say it's a postmodern novel erm it's get page like like that
S0327	blah blah blah blah blah blah
S0327	so have a look so that's that be one of erm he get six little mondrians tiny little early paint for something like only sixty thousand each he be very clever but i won't lend it to you cos i don't lend book cos you know how one never get them back
S0326	yeah it look good though
S0327	i think you might enjoy it i'll see if i can get you an extra copy i think you'd find it funny start read it and think it be terribly good
S0326	so it's recent erm
S0327	yes so it's all quite recent
S0326	that he go to
S0327	yeah a few just a few months ago and he actually write it for the second part be i'd be interest for you to read it interest to know what you'd think cos the second part be more imaginary it's imagine what would happen if they er make a film of it with erm kevin spacey i don't think that work quite so well although i've be watch him in have you see house of card
S0326	erm i watch the first two season it be i think it be quite good
S0327	see i think it's er absolutely addictive luckily i haven't finish yet
S0327	erm apparently he be kevin spacey's suppose to be an absolute bastard
S0326	yeah probably
S0327	i think anybody to be that successful don't you how's your posh godfather
S0326	oh i haven't really hear from him
S0327	have you not
S0326	i get a christmas card i think
S0327	you wanna keep in touch with him he's a good contact for
S0327	whatever you want to do later
S0326	yeah
S0327	you should keep in him in touch with what you're do i i imagine he'd be quite interest
S0326	yeah i mean it's hard i suppose it's just sort of hard to do it not really artificially
S0327	yes erm well you could next time you go somewhere interest you could just send him a postcard
S0326	yeah
S0327	and say er we haven't see each other in so long just to say i hope that you're well i saw him on television the other day briefly and he look very well
S0326	yeah er last time i saw him er he look good for he's quite old now i suppose
S0327	yes he must be over seventy i would have think
S0326	yeah
S0327	erm of course from where i stand it's not so terribly old
S0327	but it be old but er he he seem quite vigorous
S0326	yeah
S0327	and he's on the radio every week and i think what he do be very good
S0326	the er the other week my erm i i wake up to that programme it be it be him and then my erm teacher
S0327	at
S0326	er yeah erm and i be sort of half asleep and i be like what's he do in my room
S0327	how many tutorials do you get
S0326	erm two about two a week i think two or three erm yeah it's good
S0327	well it's very nice that still place like that
S0326	and i i tell them i really i like have one that's two hours and one that's generally about an hour
S0327	mm
S0326	but also any time you want sort of extra time you just sort of they would be they're really happy like will to like to talk talk something through with them they like i mean er like they obviously enjoy it and so i think it's it's more reward than other universities cos you can you have a real relationship with them
S0327	oh it's very good that i mean at i don't know what art school be like now most of them aren't like that but most of my teach years we have long tutorials you know at least an hour and i have several friends who've remain close friends who be students
S0326	mm
S0327	and that's very that's very reward i mean one of the great things about that kind of relationship be you actually can talk about what you're interest in erm which be not so easy in social life
S0326	yeah
S0327	you know i mean artists don't talk about art when they're together they they er they complain about their dealers or they talk about money
S0326	yeah
S0327	sometimes they talk about technique but they don't talk about art
S0327	so presumably it's the same you're not gonna be talk about classics with your mat
S0326	yeah no
S0327	so it's it be very very nice that be always what i like about teach but that's very interest what you say about the of course those communities go back to pre ancient greece or ancient ancient greece those communities must have be very small
S0326	yeah
S0327	i mean that's i think one of the problems that's happen everything be now so enormous and everybody's in touch with everybody
S0326	yeah yeah sort of globalisation world
S0327	i mean i'm sure there's some very good things about it but
S0326	yeah it's er it's lot er sort of er er it mean there's a lot less mystery
S0327	yes
S0326	kinda cos i think erm i i even i even i can sort of remember just sort of look at photos and book of other place you know that be sort of like excite and when you're a child it's like imagine
S0327	yes
S0326	but now it's sort of that's would be totally sort of compare to a film or
S0327	yeah i think that's that's a problem i mean when i er er start travel just in europe it be very excite but when i then go somewhere like morocco mind you i suspect there be still place in in
S0326	yeah
S0327	especially in north africa where modern life hasn't really impinge i mean there's some funny sight i could er this must be go back ten years but i remember go to petra and we be in wadi rum which be er the the the part of the desert that erm what's his name the famous arabist erm tut world war one time lead er lead the arab revolt
S0326	i don't know
S0327	erm and there be this guide with all the camels get onto his mobile
S0327	and that do look very bizarre
S0326	yeah
S0327	firmly from one to another
S0326	yeah even things like telephone sort of er like the world before the telephone
S0327	half the time you didn't know where anybody be
S0327	well even in in my childhood
S0326	yeah
S0327	it be it be very expensive to phone i use to go up you remember in cottage the little room i use to sleep in up a few stairs
S0326	yeah
S0327	that be my father's room and i use to go up to phone my friends in the even and after five minutes my father'd roar up that's enough
S0327	you er i'm not make of money
S0327	cos it be very expensive
S0327	i'm work on try to get to get a mobile phone he's a long way from it but
S0327	he's move up two pace
S0326	yes well i think that's cos er well before there be telephone erm do you know that oracle at delphi it be actually er erm they have er sort of privilege access to a lot of information cos lot of people pass through
S0327	ah yes
S0326	and so that's why they're able to sort of give sort of quite good answer to question cos they they be really have an awareness of what be go on in the greek world which no one else have because no one have things like phone or even like letter really
S0327	no
S0326	but they have pick up all all the sort of chit chat from the whole sort of greek world
S0327	terribly hard to imagine live like that now there be a movement er have you ever meet my photographer call he's a very nice man he's in his mid thirties now very good photographer and he start a course in some aspect of of politics and there er have be for a few years now some movement to kind of erm i've only just start look at look at the the essay that he send me erm the opposite of sustainable development to rather reduce everything down so that life can in some way be simpler
S0326	yeah
S0327	and i'm i'm interest in read it cos i can't imagine how that can happen cos i get frighten occasionally when you think that you know er the life we lead be so artificial in so many ways you know all you need be electricity to go
S0326	yeah
S0327	you know and you've get no television you've get no radio you've get no telephone you've get no way of communicate you've get no way of see in the even erm you've get no way of heat you've get no way of cook
S0327	it's extraordinary
S0326	yeah i mean that's why erm sort of it's the idea of like cyber warfare when you can sort of really bring a country to its knees er just by mess with the computer systems
S0327	i'm amaze that no country's manage to do it yet i suppose that there be firewalls everywhere
S0326	mm but you know even something as as simple as sort of mess with traffic light you know make them all green
S0327	absolutely hospitals you know everything would just stop well i guess it'll happen er er somewhere at some point
S0326	yeah
S0327	only recently wasn't there some enormous storm somewhere in australia or off on an island off where everything everything crash the lot so that's how it's gonna happen but then maybe people think like that i remember my father say i'm glad i'm not gonna see what's go to happen to the world next
S0327	would you like to read a story i write about an experience of 's go to renew his passport a year or so ago and he he come here and he tell me the story of it it be a complete and utter nightmare and erm i say look i i've gotta i've gotta turn that into a story can you write that down for me now be dyslexic and er for every word that there be he use six and he send me this thing it's ten thousand word
S0327	and all about how he be his frustration in you know go from queue to queue and so on and i think i can't do this but then i suddenly saw a way of do it and turn it into third person
S0327	would you like me to send it to you
S0326	yeah i have a look at it
S0327	it's it you may find it it well it it be it be bore you know i mean that's the point to it erm but it's er but if you can sit it out it's worth read send 's story
S0326	but it's a sort of bureaucratic nightmare
S0327	yes yes i've call it erm renew your passport roll over franz kafka
S0327	and in fact i'm start to think about do a collection of stories about the some extreme adventure of my friends and people i know if there's anything really wild that's happen to you already in your life think about it
S0326	yeah
S0327	and if it's then we can you can you can tell me about that and write it down and erm i just think it'd be quite a nice thing to do
S0326	yeah i wish i i remember one time my friend in berlin tell me such er i wish it be record her tell me this story about how one time she and her friends they sort of er know a little bite about but not really they'd like do a bite of sail on a reservoir and by the end of it they go on the computer and fake a boat licence on photoshop and rent a yacht sort of a big like two million euro yacht sail it in greece and it's like the sort of they didn't really know how to park it so they just kinda didn't wanna get in trouble so they would leave it in the ocean and like row back and forth
S0326	they didn't really know like they have to say forget they have to get water and you know
S0327	yeah that's the kind of thing that you know everybody's get one or two stories like that at some point
S0326	well i think i'd better start
S0327	okay well i'm i can feel my afternoon nap come on thank you for do the chair
S0326	that's alright
S0327	erm water the garden so how long be you here for now
