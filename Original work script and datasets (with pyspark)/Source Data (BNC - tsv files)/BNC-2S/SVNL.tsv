S0018	oh no
S0019	but have obviously not bother to write it down
S0018	so he'd just completely forget you
S0019	yes in a word
S0018	do you phone him
S0019	no i didn't i allow myself a little bite of time to not be quite so cross and i have er half an hour with well more than half an hour three quarter of an hour with one of the other coach there
S0018	what he just happen to be free
S0019	yes he just happen to be there and wasn't do anything for three quarter of an hour so i have that with and then i texted
S0019	and say and who forget twelve o'clock today and i say i will be expect a suitably grovel apology
S0018	do he reply
S0019	he do he do he do
S0018	be it suitably grovel
S0019	yes
S0019	yes oh no how could i have do that yeah well i know how you could do it because you didn't damn well write it down
S0019	huh he's so disorganize at time he drive me round the bend
S0018	so what else do he say
S0019	um oh how can i make it up to you
S0019	i be tempt to say well you can give me a free lesson
S0019	but i think no that's that's a bite much
S0019	um but i rearrange it for wednesday
S0018	mhm
S0019	at twelve o'clock now it'll be interest to see whether he forget that one as well um i mean again he send back er how could i have do that
S0019	and so i send back well you do have a track record cos this be not the first time
S0019	he's do it
S0018	aw don't make him feel too bad
S0019	oh yes i will
S0019	and the last time he do it to the lady he have before me on a tuesday and we be both not amuse
S0019	and he get a roast from both of us
S0019	the follow week
S0018	be he
S0019	not not only that but i buy him a little notebook
S0019	to put in his bag
S0018	be he sheepish
S0019	have he use it
S0018	well that's the thing i think a lot of people nowadays be rely on their mobile phone
S0019	mm
S0018	to do things like keep appointments
S0019	mhm
S0018	and stuff but it's such a difficult interface
S0019	mm
S0018	i for for example i much prefer to write something down
S0019	mm
S0018	than to than to put it in my phone because you have to unblock your phone
S0019	mm
S0018	you have to press
S0019	mhm
S0018	enter duddle uddle er tick on the click on the right thing like the voice note or the
S0019	well think back
S0018	the diary or
S0019	when we be talk about it last tuesday he he didn't put it in his phone he didn't look at his phone he just say i can do twelve o'clock on monday
S0018	hm
S0019	now whether this course come up since he do that but he'd forget it anyway so it doesn't really matter
S0019	but er no i i'll make him pay on wednesday don't worry
S0019	i'll make him pay
S0018	aw
S0019	but tom's very nice
S0019	very young but very nice very pleasant and he be much kinder to me than be he didn't put things at me very hard and he didn't put things at me where i get to run a lot
S0019	which be very nice of him um but no it be interest
S0018	do you find tennis to be a good workout because whenever i've
S0019	oo yes
S0018	whenever i've play tennis i don't actually find it to be that
S0019	if you're play a game double particularly no it's not but this be a lesson where we're do various drill and practice and then we play single at the end and that be hard work
S0018	hm
S0019	cos you've get to cover the whole of the court um so yes it it it be a good workout it certainly make me
S0018	so maybe i
S0019	out of breath
S0018	maybe i just wasn't do it right
S0019	no double when we play double at the end of the monday night it's not you don't get that many rally go in double
S0018	hm
S0019	um and it just isn't isn't the same
S0018	hm
S0019	so no the the the lessons themselves be a good workout
S0018	and what about the aqua aerobics be that a good workout
S0019	it depend it aqua aerobics be the sort of thing you can do as hard or not as you like depend entirely how much you use the water for resistance
S0018	hm
S0019	um and most people don't strangely enough the whole idea of aqua aerobics be to use the water as resistance but you can't do that unless you're actually below surface of the water
S0018	mhm
S0019	and so many people be up way out of the water so their arm be half in the water instead of right down cos when you're pull and push against the water
S0018	mm that's when the
S0019	yeah
S0018	you get
S0019	and it's so you can make it as easy or as hard as you like depend on how you feel on the night
S0018	mm
S0019	depend on how cold the water be
S0018	oo
S0018	brr
S0019	and lately they've have trouble with the boiler and it the temperature of the water be definitely down and then the the boiler bust completely so it be out of commission the pool be out of commission for a couple of days
S0018	oh dear
S0019	yep not good and the spa pool be out as well cos all the boiler heat all the water
S0018	be the spa pool usually hot
S0019	mm it's lovely
S0019	just go and sit in it and it bubble and it's lovely
S0019	mm it's lovely
S0018	but aqua aerobics be you suppose to be i mean you your feet have to be on the floor
S0019	oh yes
S0018	i imagine
S0019	yeah
S0018	on the
S0019	mm
S0018	bottom of the swim pool
S0019	mm oh yeah it's just the same in many ways as do um an aerobics session on the floor
S0018	mm
S0019	except that you're use the water as resistance instead of use weight and things like that
S0018	mm
S0019	but it certainly be a good workout
S0018	no i'd do it if it be er in the mediterranean
S0018	and warm and sunny
S0019	yes wouldn't we all
S0018	one of my friends have get a free two week pass to the la fitness in kings heath
S0019	oh yeah
S0018	yeah i be think of maybe try that but they've just get so many different class that i just don't know
S0019	mm
S0018	what to do
S0019	well you're best off keep it i don't know whether they have a a a system where you can see how difficult the class be they do at david lloyd
S0018	i don't know
S0019	it's colour coordinate so that you know how what sort of level it be
S0018	right
S0019	you would be better to pick something on a fairly low level to start with to see what it's like
S0018	yep
S0019	cos there's no point in go in one of the hard ones and then be put off completely
S0018	hm yes i just don't want to go er to any of the class that have get boom boom boom music
S0019	they all have boom boom boom music
S0018	oh no
S0019	even the aqua aerobics
S0018	oh you're joke
S0019	no i'm not
S0018	and do you find that actually motivate you doesn't it just
S0019	it's better than do it without the music
S0018	yeah
S0019	and the music that use um she's get these sort of compilations of sixties and seventies
S0018	mhm
S0019	and we can sing along cos most of us be in the slightly older age group
S0019	and we all know the word
S0018	oh really
S0019	oh yeah and you can sing you know abba things
S0018	oh so she hasn't get boom boom boom music
S0019	there be some yes she do have some boom boom boom music um
S0019	but it's it be better with the music i have to say
S0018	yeah
S0019	definitely
S0018	no i mean i love music i just don't like
S0019	mm
S0018	house music hard
S0019	the annoy thing be that there be a spin class go on upstairs at the same time
S0018	and you can hear that
S0019	mm huh the woman who take it she's get um a microphone on
S0018	uh huh
S0019	and it's so load
S0018	yeah
S0019	you can hear her above everything else there be time when we have to get the pool attendant to go on the phone and say can you put the volume down a bite
S0018	well i can believe it in do you remember i be do some step aerobics
S0019	mm
S0018	in murcia and yeah the woman who be do it have like a a mouthpiece
S0019	yeah
S0018	and
S0019	yeah
S0018	bark order
S0019	yes
S0018	at us over the top of the boom boom boom music
S0019	yeah
S0018	and but the the gym be on the grind floor of a residential apartment block
S0019	ff fun
S0018	and er all even
S0019	you've get that oh ff
S0018	it be okay one two three to the side
S0019	oh
S0018	duddle er
S0019	oh
S0018	to the leave
S0019	god
S0018	duddle er come on girls
S0019	oh
S0019	oh
S0019	how awful
S0018	the people who be immediately above that gym
S0019	mm
S0018	must have be tear their hair out
S0019	yep
S0018	then again the spanish people be more
S0019	true they live with noise don't they
S0018	tolerant to noise
S0019	it would be worth you go in to see um what sort of class they've get on offer see if they've get pilates cos pilates
S0018	yep
S0019	be usually very quiet
S0018	yep i'd even go to a zumba class again
S0019	you wouldn't would you
S0018	yeah
S0019	oh my god i saw a zumba class
S0018	doesn't everyone look silly
S0019	yes
S0018	i look at myself in the mirror cos we be do it in front of a mirror
S0019	no
S0018	and i just think oh my life i look so stupid
S0019	yep
S0018	i'm never come back to this class again and then i just take a moment to look at everybody else
S0019	yep
S0018	and i be like oh it's alright
S0019	yeah
S0018	they all look stupid
S0019	they all look silly yeah yeah becky when they start zumba class at david lloyd she go and she say i can't do half the things they want me to do
S0018	yeah
S0019	my body doesn't do that
S0018	yeah i know
S0019	it be so funny
S0018	and also it's so fast pace
S0019	yes yes
S0018	that once you've master one particular step that they're do at that time
S0019	mm
S0018	they've move onto the next one
S0019	that's right yep
S0018	but i do think the more you go the easier it be because
S0019	well the yeah because you learn the step
S0018	yep
S0019	you know it's like line dance
S0018	it do seem to be the same
S0019	anything like that
S0018	every week
S0019	no that's right yeah have a look at at what class they
S0018	yeah
S0019	see er there be one that go on this morning at david lloyd it's almost like um huh kick box to music it look quite interest
S0018	mhm
S0019	but i don't know what else they do because i don't do any of the other class i don't have time i can't fit any more things in
S0018	well already with your three tennis lessons
S0019	no oh no not three
S0018	personal train
S0019	not three two
S0018	two tennis lessons two personal train
S0019	two personal train and two aqua aerobics if i can fit the second one because just lately i've be work every friday morning so i haven't be able to go
S0018	yeah
S0019	which be a bite of a nuisance but i don't have any choice so if it have to go it have to go
S0018	well that's not bad six exercise sessions a week sometimes five
S0019	mm but i'm not as cardio vasularly fit as i be
S0018	really
S0019	no cos i'm not do the treadmill stuff
S0018	oh right be you fitter when you be do that
S0019	mm yep
S0018	how do you notice that make a difference
S0019	i don't get i didn't get so out of breath tennis and things like that
S0018	oh really
S0019	mm because when i start get tire and out of breath like that i go silly and i have to laugh and
S0019	it just and then after a while when we've be play for a while
S0018	maybe you maybe you go all silly because your body need oxygen
S0019	well very probably
S0018	and your body's way of get oxygen be by laugh and huh ha ha ha ha ha ha huh ha ha ha
S0019	yes
S0019	well i can just we'll be play and be do a rally and all of a sudden i've lose it but tonight by the i'm alright until half past eight and once you go past half past eight the concentration go the coordination go
S0019	and i can't do anything but no it's good fun and that's the most important thing that you have fun do it and you have a laugh
S0018	mm although although the er la la la be there always the same group of people
S0019	yep yep three oh there's four of us huh yeah four of us have be go now for puh three four years on a monday night
S0018	be that the tennis
S0019	mhm
S0018	oh who take that lesson
S0019	be we keep you up
S0018	no
S0018	it's nap time obviously
S0019	yep no as far as the drive be concern it it's only a second lesson
S0018	oh it do knacker me though i
S0019	oh yes
S0018	concentration
S0019	concentration yep
S0018	he say to me while i be drive just get ready to turn leave er at a junction he say so what be you plan what be you plan for the rest of the day and i be like rest of the day what uh okay wait there sorry i've just i'm concentrate
S0018	so hard on everything that i i haven't get space in my mind to think about the rest of the day at the moment sorry
S0019	no you'll get use to that
S0018	yes
S0019	it's there's so many things to think about and to do in a set procedure and
S0019	it's very easy to get things in the wrong order to start with
S0018	yes
S0019	but no as i say remember it's only your second lesson so
S0018	no it's true
S0019	yeah
S0018	it's
S0019	you'll be fine
S0018	he be kind of i i feel that he's make he's take me quite quicky cos he can see that i'm quite capable and whereas i can do it er i know whereas i know i can do it when he's there tell me what to do i don't feel confident in do it without him tell me to do it so in a way i kind of wish that he wouldn't take me so quickly
S0019	in which case
S0018	to new things
S0019	yeah
S0018	and
S0019	say that to him
S0018	but the but the thing be i also want to you see i don't know whether huh it's probably cos i'm just not get practice but then again no i don't think it's that i'm not get practice i think i just would prefer for him to take me through it and then let me do it myself two or three time
S0019	mm
S0018	and then give me feedback
S0019	mhm
S0018	and then
S0019	well say that to him
S0018	mm
S0019	that's the most important part get the instructor
S0018	mm
S0019	to do it the way in which you feel more comfortable and if that's
S0018	oh my
S0019	how you feel more comfortable then tell him
S0018	at the moment i'll defer to his expertise but um you see for example if i say if i tell him the way i want to do it i e please take me where there be no other cars at all
S0018	it's probably actually not a very good thing for me to learn how to drive
S0018	in a vacuum without other cars around be it cos
S0019	mm
S0018	and you get use to
S0019	it it's true and as i say before it be only your second lesson
S0018	i know but tomorrow he want us go up the do sixty miles an hour in fourth gear
S0019	right
S0018	or maybe forty miles an hour in fourth gear
S0019	i be just go to say i don't think he'd make you go sixty miles an hour down the
S0018	forty miles an hour in fourth gear he say
S0019	yep
S0018	down the
S0019	yes because you'd be speed if you do
S0019	sixty miles an hour down the it depend on which bite of the he's go to take you on
S0018	i don't know
S0019	he'll probably take you to
S0018	mm
S0019	turn leave and then leave by safeways so that you come off the there
S0018	mm
S0019	and that's perfectly straight
S0018	mm
S0019	er it's two two lanes of traffic so you'll be fine
S0018	mm well luckily so far all the other cars that i've encounter have be very patient
S0019	most people be
S0018	yes good but i when i see another car i'm always think oh god if i be a
S0019	no no no
S0018	if i be a driver like be it you yesterday i hate it when people do that i hate it when people don't
S0019	yeah
S0018	pull out when you're signal for them to pull out and
S0019	it's it's that they don't look
S0018	yeah
S0019	that's what annoy me that they don't look at you and see what you be do and er act accordingly it drive me round the bend
S0019	but
S0018	what drive me round the bend be people who don't signal so you don't know where they're go
S0019	yes yes and if that happen you have to work on the principle that they be go to go where you want to go and you let them go
S0018	hm
S0019	if subsequently they turn off that's fine but it's you don't assume anything when you're drive it doesn't do
S0018	yes i know but i just don't know the think i have any more mental space
S0019	oh yes you do
S0018	no no no but i i'm think about so many things at once
S0019	yes you're think about them now but as you go on you won't have to think about them
S0018	oh that's good
S0019	it'll come automatically so you know
S0018	the clutch thing kinda come
S0019	mm
S0018	quite naturally now
S0019	mm
S0018	but not change gear and why you have to change gear and what gear it's best to be in at a give moment
S0019	well that's something you just learn by experience
S0018	mm
S0019	but say i use to tell grandad by the sound of the engine when he be go to change gear
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0019	so again you'll find that'll come
S0018	uh huh
S0019	with time but you do need to get some practice in so i suppose i have to speak to your father about get you on my insurance to drive my car
S0018	not if you're not happy do that
S0019	oh i it's i'm it's not so i'm not happy about you go out practise um i'm more concern about you pass your test and want my car
S0018	oh gosh no
S0018	i'd never do that it's your car isn't it
S0019	you're not have my car
S0018	it's your car of course i wouldn't
S0019	you wouldn't manage you father's car anyway
S0018	hm
S0019	i think you'll find that's just too big
S0018	don't think i'd manage my father either
S0019	huh well the problem be if you could put tape round his mouth and let him just sit there
S0019	and not say anything you'd probably be alright
S0019	um but i'm not sure that i would be much better
S0018	oh no i think you would be but again i i i'm not particularly confident go out on the
S0019	no
S0018	roads
S0019	have a
S0018	without a
S0019	no
S0018	dual control
S0019	have another few lessons before you even think about that
S0018	or
S0019	you've get to get use to it
S0018	or what i'd maybe like to do with you would be to go to the old carpark or something and just practise like have no other cars around and just practise the whole mechanics of what do you do when you come up to a junction if you're in second gear and you have to stop and duddle uddle uddle er and just practise it and get some feedback on
S0019	what do
S0018	what i'm do wrong
S0019	what do he tell you to do
S0018	i don't know mum that's the thing he's put he give me instructions all the way through the lesson so i'm not actually take anything in at the moment i'm just
S0019	mm
S0018	react to his instructions
S0019	mm
S0018	to keep
S0019	mm
S0018	myself alive
S0019	no no that's you will find that that become almost automatic after a while you won't even have to think about it cos if you're in second gear and you're come up to a junction clutch brake neutral handbrake
S0018	hm yep
S0019	it it's really very simple you do the same pattern of
S0018	uh huh
S0019	action every single time and the more you do that the more you will get use to it and become automatic
S0018	hm i just why don't people just have automatic cars
S0019	well yes
S0018	stop go leave
S0019	yeah
S0018	right honestly
S0019	automatic cars be fine except if you take your test on an automatic car you cannot drive a manual
S0018	i know but why aren't all
S0019	gearbox
S0018	but why aren't all cars just automatic why because dad say what be it he say the last time oh i know but you'll you'll learn to appreciate a manual gearbox it's like why
S0019	pardon
S0018	it just complicate everything
S0019	well it yes it do i mean we have an automatic and i have to stick my leave foot underneath my seat
S0019	because automatically i go to change gear and i keep hit the brake
S0018	oh it's it's just two
S0019	not a good idea
S0018	pedal
S0019	yeah
S0018	accelerator and brake
S0019	mhm
S0018	you see that's all you need
S0018	leave and right accelerate and brake
S0018	it's a lot easier cos you have to think about coordinate look in the mirror
S0018	flick i tell you what i keep do i can i'm alright indicate leave cos the indicator's
S0019	mhm
S0018	on the leave but when i wanna indicate right i've get my right hand out go where's the indicator on the right hand side
S0019	oh dear oh yeah the only thing you have to watch about go onto a car park or something like that be that you're not insure it's private grind private land
S0018	uh huh
S0019	and you're not insure for that so you'd have to pick your time very carefully
S0018	okay
S0019	so that there wasn't anything er likely to come up and hit you actually i don't know where the the largest open space would be when i be learn there be um tut disused airfield can't remember where it be now but to start with i go on this disused airfield and just
S0018	hm
S0019	drive around the perimeter track and
S0018	you don't know anyone who work at silverstone do you
S0019	no i don't and i think that probably wouldn't be such a good idea with the way you handle the speedboat
S0018	i do like go fast
S0019	yeah mm
S0018	i also it's also natural for me for some reason when i'm turn like for example there's a junction no there's a road
S0019	mm
S0018	with a right hand turn that be a t junction so i'm turn right
S0019	mhm
S0018	onto another road where it's
S0019	across the flow of traffic
S0018	yeah
S0019	yep
S0018	and if it's clear and everything you kinda nearly come to a halt
S0019	mm
S0018	but if it's clear you carry on
S0019	mhm
S0018	and then i turn and my foot automatically hit the
S0018	hit the accelerator
S0019	right
S0018	don't accelerate into a turn i mean be that be that just genius on my part
S0018	or be that
S0019	well you don't well yes you do have to accelerate but you should aim for a nice steady
S0018	oh it's steady
S0019	slow er
S0018	i just like i just take it fast i think it's because the faster you go because i'm not so comfortable with steer i'm worry about oversteering all the time so it maybe the faster i go on a turn the more it turn
S0019	mm
S0018	in
S0019	yeah but again as you get more experience you'll compensate for that anyway and you won't have the problem
S0018	yeah huh
S0019	you'll be fine don't worry about it
S0018	yeah i know i will i will i will it's just
S0019	you'll be fine well it's always daunt to start with
S0018	it's not it's that it's daunt it's you know you get to that point where you realize how much you don't know and you know
S0019	mm well
S0018	or you get you get show a lot and then you think oh my gosh i'm gonna have to start do this off my own back
S0019	mm
S0018	and i have just get no clue
S0019	yes you will
S0018	and as i say because he's give feed me all these instructions all the time because i'm concentrate on interpret his instructions and react to them respond to them er that and i'm so concentrate on the mirror and if there's anything else on the road and
S0019	mm
S0018	where's the
S0018	how do you indicate right where's third gear oh my god where be it i'm not take anything in i don't feel like i'm actually learn
S0019	mm well if you want to really learn the gearbox then the best thing you can do be to sit in my car without the engine on and practise depress the clutch and find the gear
S0018	mm
S0019	cos once you've do that it then become just automatic
S0018	yep
S0019	then you don't even think about it
S0018	hm
S0019	and even now sometimes um go from where be we second to third i sometimes overcook it and go straight to fifth
S0018	on purpose
S0019	no
S0018	yeah cos you see that's why i couldn't i couldn't find third
S0019	mm
S0018	i'm fine change from first into second
S0019	mm
S0018	second into first and neutral
S0019	mm
S0018	but i be either go into first or fifth
S0019	mm
S0018	instead of third
S0019	mm
S0018	cos the notch just didn't seem like it be
S0019	mm
S0018	there be it
S0019	no you just have to learn where it be
S0018	be it generally the same in every car
S0019	mhm the gearbox um
S0018	no
S0019	be the same pattern
S0018	but the amount not the pattern like
S0019	no no no no
S0018	the distance between
S0019	no er every car be slightly different um but once you've do it a few time you get to know and you can feel where it be
S0018	mm
S0019	most of the time so again it's just get use to it
S0018	yes i'm sure i will
S0019	very interest to watch people change gear
S0018	mm
S0019	to see how they do it because your father if you watch him he's get a very circular
S0019	very fancy
S0018	look very camp
S0019	very fancy
S0018	no i think i'm just like mine's just like frenzied where be it oh my god
S0018	duddle uddle er duddle
S0019	no you'll you'll find it
S0018	yes it's just practice i guess isn't it
S0019	and strangely enough if i have to think about the gearbox and where everything be that's really hard
S0018	really
S0019	yeah if i sit in the car and do it it's just automatically there
S0018	well that's like when you're try to remember a phone number it's always easier to
S0019	mm
S0018	remember when you see the er dial pad in front of you be that what it what it's call
S0019	no idea
S0018	or have i just invent that name
S0019	i guess now why have you phone me the last two or three time on my mobile instead of the house phone
S0018	because i get on my mobile i get free minutes
S0019	ah
S0018	but i've get a feel that that's only to mobile number
S0019	right
S0018	wait there i'm just gonna go check on my
S0018	potatoes
S0019	i think i could
S0018	yes those be my potatoes and i they have burn er boil dry and they er luckily i catch them at the stage of just sautéd
S0018	slightly burn
S0019	be they
S0018	just sautéd
S0019	edible
S0018	oh i haven't eat them yet
S0019	oh right
S0018	i've put them in the fridge cos um i'm gonna have i'm gonna put some er salad cream on them and have a bite of potato salad
S0019	mhm
S0018	with the chicken cos the chicken's cold
S0019	mm
S0018	i didn't particularly want to have hot potatoes
S0019	no no
S0018	but i be oh i should've do some for dad i didn't think
S0019	no he'll he won't want them
S0018	be he not gonna have chicken when he come home
S0019	he'll probably have chicken but he'll probably have just a sandwich he won't have
S0018	ah
S0019	potato salad
S0018	what time be he home or
S0019	depend entirely on the traffic
S0018	ah
S0019	and apparently there be fog at some stage between poole and somewhere else very much depend on whether the fog have lift and what the traffic's like
S0018	fog at this time of day
S0019	mm
S0018	why would that be
S0019	depend on the um oo i hear that depend on the the the land the lie of the land if it's in a dip and you get that sort of especially if there's water around
S0018	mm
S0019	um you often get fog and it can linger for quite a long time
S0018	mm
S0019	and it's be beautiful in poole but somebody be say who'd come through blandford forum i think it be that there be fog around there but he will be hit unfortunately around oxford at the worst time for the traffic
S0018	really
S0019	and sometimes it take him age to get through and sometimes it doesn't it's just luck of the draw so he could be home at five he could be home at six just don't know
S0018	what time be he leave
S0019	um think it be about two so it's five pretty much the earliest and of course if he's hit the traffic it'll be later so it's it's always variable the last time he make it in two and two and three quarter hours
S0018	hm
S0019	but it be a sunday
S0018	ah
S0019	and he have a clear run through
S0018	yep yeah oxford's a nightmare for traffic isn't it
S0019	yep
S0018	all the organizations that i've look at the webpages for they're like um we do not recommend for you to drive to our offices er
S0019	no
S0018	you get the park and ride or
S0019	yes
S0018	there be no park in oxford
S0019	mm
S0018	and
S0019	no park and ride be a very good scheme
S0018	mm
S0019	let you park outside the city and just shuttle bus you in it's they they've get it at um warwick
S0018	mhm
S0019	as well cos park in warwick's a nightmare
S0018	yep
S0019	so you can do the warwick park and ride as well
S0018	yeah that's
S0019	i don't think they've get it for birmingham don't think there's a park and ride system in birmingham
S0018	mm
S0019	mind you i think birmingham's get a lot more car park provision well i've really only be to oxford on the train and it's quite a walk from the station into
S0018	yep
S0019	the city centre not unpleasant but it's all cities and nothing can be worse than bath
S0019	bath be an absolute nightmare
S0018	i think place like that aren't actually build for traffic
S0019	oh no
S0018	like place like birmingham have be
S0019	mm
S0018	develop so much since
S0019	yeah well
S0018	the advent of the motorcar
S0019	yep bath be still very much a georgian city
S0018	yeah cos oxford be be i like that character about it
S0019	mm
S0018	that it be very walkable
S0019	mm
S0018	and the roads aren't too wide and
S0019	there's some very nice build
S0018	yeah there be some beautiful build
S0019	i'm not sure huh i think well i don't know cos it's a long time since i go to cambridge to look round i think i sort of prefer cambridge to oxford
S0018	for drive or in general
S0019	no no just for visit
S0018	hm
S0019	but i'm not sure how it's change
S0018	why do you prefer
S0019	it be it seem to me to be smaller
S0018	really
S0019	mm but it's a long time since i go to cambridge to walk round so it may have change quite a lot
S0018	mm
S0019	but lovely build
S0018	i think pause
S0019	try and fix up for next week go to the french pâtisserie
S0018	okay
S0019	monday would be a good day for me cos i don't have anything on a monday usually
S0018	i be just think i haven't book my drive lessons for next week but i'll see him tomorrow
S0019	you can do that tomorrow
S0018	mm
S0019	but that would seem
S0018	mm the only thing be that be send to nursery on mondays so that she can do more work
S0019	ah right
S0018	so i'm not sure if next monday
S0019	okay
S0018	i'm gonna be do the spreadsheet that we've get to do
S0019	right
S0018	um what other plan have you get over the week
S0019	well i suspect tuesday and wednesday will be again
S0018	but that's only that's morning
S0019	that's an hour yes
S0018	and what time do he normally come
S0019	and tennis be tuesday
S0018	what time do normally come
S0019	um either nine or half past
S0018	but if you wanna go there for lunch that doesn't
S0019	well no
S0018	rule out er tuesday or wednesday
S0019	no i'd rather go for coffee
S0018	oh would you
S0019	coffee and naughty cake
S0018	okay
S0019	just don't tell
S0019	um if he come it'll be either nine or nine thirty tuesday but then i've get tennis in the afternoon
S0018	so what kind of time
S0019	but wednesday
S0018	okay if you say you wanna go for a coffee
S0019	mhm
S0018	what kind of time be you think of want to go then
S0019	mm somewhere around eleven
S0018	oh right
S0019	would that fit
S0018	yeah i'm just
S0019	wednesday actually would be the best time to do that then cos i've only get er in the morning and i haven't get anything the rest of the day cos er
S0018	mhm
S0019	don't i must write down the weeks cos now i've get so many weeks holiday to fit in from work cos i haven't take any holiday this year at all um and i've get to fit it in between now and begin of june when my holiday start next year's this year's holiday start er so i've work out that i'll be work every other week rather than every week
S0018	but you'll get pay for it as if it be holiday
S0019	oh yeah cos it's holiday yeah
S0018	um well monday could work then in that case cos i don't know whether if you want to go earlier it wouldn't cut the day in half would it i could still go in and help
S0019	mhm well i could make it any time monday morning it's not critical
S0018	um um um um
S0019	have a think about it and let me know
S0018	well i'll see when
S0019	yeah
S0018	he's free for drive lessons
S0019	yeah
S0018	cos it might actually we could even do a drive lesson earlier and then both go to moseley
S0019	mm i'm not doesn't really make that much difference it's just that monday i haven't get anything on at all until the even
S0018	okay that seem more
S0019	and then wednesday after have be i haven't get anything until the even again so
S0018	so monday or wednesday
S0019	monday or wednesday would be the safest cos i know i'm work this friday huh um i don't think i'm work the follow friday i must check i must take my diary with me and write down the weeks that i be work
S0018	mhm and what about saturday then again saturday be difficult with
S0019	saturday's busy
S0018	traffic
S0019	yeah saturday's busy
S0018	i think the farmers' market's on as well this saturday
S0019	mm
S0018	which will be difficult
S0019	should be busier yeah
S0018	then again
S0019	no
S0018	you might like to see that
S0019	make more sense to do it during the week when it's quieter isn't it
S0018	okay
S0019	i think that would
S0018	no problem
S0019	and i'll defy for a day and have something really naughty
S0018	who's
S0019	the dietitian
S0018	oh of course i be wonder who you be talk about
S0018	be this the new god of your new find religion or something
S0019	no
S0018	cos it sound like moonies
S0019	thank you don't let her see hear you say that
S0019	no she's go to have word with her professors to see if they have any other suggestions cos she's try pretty much everything and nothing's work
S0018	what what would she be talk about to her professors i mean what
S0019	to see if they've get any other ideas cos obviously they be more experience um
S0018	so what have she do so far just exclude certain things
S0019	we've be do exclusion diet er different um pattern of eat um like this week i have to eat something every two hours and make sure that i drink before i eat it's only a snack thing um to see whether it make any difference
S0018	hm
S0019	we'll just have to see what she come up with
S0018	but nothing at all have help
S0019	nope nothing at all
S0018	who be her professors where do she study
S0019	i've no idea absolutely no idea
S0018	i give her number to indy by the way
S0019	oh good
S0018	yeah well her e mail address
S0019	mm
S0018	see you say don't phone her
S0019	well it's not that i sort of think that phone her be probably the least secure way of get in touch with her
S0018	well she's probably in consultation most of the time isn't she she can't er answer her phone
S0019	but when i do leave a message on her on her answerphone it obviously for some reason didn't get through she didn't get it so i don't quite know what go on there but e mail i think be probably safer
S0018	okay and how long be you on the diet for er how much longer be you do it
S0019	i think i've get another two weeks
S0018	after this one
S0019	after last week i think i've get this week and another week
S0018	oh right be you sure you don't want to postpone the french bakery until
S0019	nope
S0019	i do not
S0019	it's
S0018	well i'll wait until drive instructor
S0019	mm
S0018	give me his availability
S0019	mm
S0018	for next week and
S0019	sort it it's not something that we can't work around whenever
S0018	be dad away again next week
S0019	um not as far as i know at the moment but that could change
S0018	be he work in ireland at all
S0019	no mike and di well he's get to go to ireland at some stage before mike and diane get back
S0018	where be they again
S0019	bahamas
S0018	oo la la
S0019	for two months
S0018	how very nice
S0019	i know
S0018	why have they get friends out there or something
S0019	no they've be there before and they like it
S0018	uh huh
S0019	and the weather in ireland this time of the year you know sort of february march be not the best so they decide to up stick and go
S0018	well if you've get the time and the money why not
S0019	well the problem be they have the time but they're rapidly not have the money so
S0018	well that'll teach them for spend too much
S0019	i don't think it will unfortunately
S0018	isn't diane come into a lot of money for the land in scotland
S0019	well eventually possibly but they've get to survive until then
S0018	well i don't think surviving's the word if they're jet off to the bahamas for two months
S0019	no but the way they spend money um it's when you think of how much money he's go through i mean he's get less than a million now and he do have fourteen million
S0018	blimey
S0019	mhm
S0018	stupid man
S0019	mhm
S0018	um so where be they stay be they stay at a hotel or do they have an apartment
S0019	i think it's an er it's a hotel i think
S0018	mm
S0019	not absolutely sure
S0018	but i bet you he won't be enjoy it like appreciate it like
S0019	pff
S0018	like i would for example
S0019	do do he ever appreciate anything he's although i must admit i've speak to him a couple of time and have say be you have a good time oh yes the weather's lovely and he seem to be enjoy it but
S0018	oh that's good
S0019	who know with i have no idea how that man's mind work
S0018	so why do dad have to go to ireland before
S0019	there he want him to look at various things post have a chat with the make sure the security system's work that everything in the house be alright um he's what be he say no he hasn't get to go to scotland yet he's be in a lot of conversation and correspondence with scotland but it look as though the one who be work for barton willmore who have just be make redundant be go to be able to act continue to act for them cos he's be there right from the word go
S0018	uh huh
S0019	and it's go to be more difficult for somebody just to walk in and pick up the piece so from that point of view it's good
S0018	what be they go to be pay him freelance
S0019	i assume and will pay him and not pay barton willmore who charge an arm and a leg for very little from what i can see er but it's it could be another two three years before they get any money from the sale of the the land so they have to survive on less than a million
S0018	oh he's go to have to make a million pound last two years oh dear
S0019	which will be very difficult for
S0018	poor thing
S0019	would you
S0018	then again i imagine the house in ireland cost a lot to
S0019	oh huh
S0018	upkeep
S0019	why on earth they buy something that size i shall never know they get huh they're so stupid and even they be now say that they want to get rid of it and buy somewhere smaller
S0018	yep
S0019	well hallelujah how come they didn't see that in the first place he have delusions of grandeur that's his problem
S0018	mm
S0019	i mean badgeworth be the same bloody great house well there be only two of them rattle around in it just don't get it do you think he have to be to make sure that everybody can see how much money he's get or hasn't get
S0018	well that's the case
S0019	hasn't get now no it's it's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous the old say a fool and his money be soon part
S0019	too bloody right oh it it give me very great pleasure at the funeral
S0018	you don't hear that often
S0019	well no you don't but it be cos be there
S0018	at which funeral
S0019	's sister's
S0018	why do go to his sister's
S0019	because they and go back a long way the jewish
S0018	really
S0019	yes jewish community
S0018	oh okay mm
S0019	um and it give me the greatest of pleasure to be less than fulsome in my greet of him
S0018	mm what do you what do he greet you
S0019	he say yes he say he go to shake my hand and i say oh hello and that's it
S0019	and i be delight to see that he's go grey he's he's lose his hair
S0019	he's get fat and i be even more delight to see that his wife
S0018	oh you
S0019	look an absolute frump
S0018	oh mum
S0019	well she think the sun shin out of his backside
S0018	mm
S0019	but i just don't understand but it must be ten years ago since i saw her
S0018	mm
S0019	and she's change so much i couldn't believe it when i saw her she look well what she be wear be just and him
S0019	they look as though they'd just come in from the garden
S0019	oh
S0018	have he retire now
S0019	well
S0018	that be a very evil laugh
S0019	yep he be um tut not exactly sack but be encourage to remove himself as senior partner
S0018	hm
S0019	and then he do some work for somebody or other i don't know who but i don't think he have the the reception in retirement that he be expect
S0018	hmm what do you mean
S0019	well he er expect to get pick up work at the drop of a hat from various people um but i think his reputation be such that nobody want to touch him with a barge pole
S0018	well i'm not surprise
S0019	no i'm not either
S0018	you can't go round treat people like that all your
S0019	mm
S0018	life and then expect to
S0019	no but i think he be even more miff that and drop the friendship very very quickly so it's
S0018	but what be the dynamic there he be on the board of directors at 's
S0019	he be
S0018	firm
S0019	he be chairman
S0018	oh okay
S0019	and company solicitor
S0018	okay
S0019	but i think he cos say once the shit hit the fan at everything else collapse as well oh dear what a shame
S0018	and what be dad's reaction when he saw him at the funeral
S0019	oh he he's perfectly happy about it he doesn't hold a grudge you know your father don't burn your boat
S0018	hm
S0019	and he say actually it give him much more satisfaction be in 's inner circle
S0018	mhm
S0019	where be not
S0019	he find that um
S0018	do he
S0019	poetic justice
S0018	do he actually chat to
S0019	very briefly
S0018	do he mention do he slip in that he be oh just off to ireland i'll see you

S0018	oh so he know that dad's work for them
S0019	oh yes yes yes
S0018	mm
S0019	he's know all along er i don't think he's like it particularly oh dear what a shame
S0018	hm
S0019	but then there's the dread as well who be a plan consultant and i can't remember how the contact come about but it be when the time when um and where think of buy something in scotland and be angle to get a job there and he be not subtle at all and he's a an objectionable individual i take an instant dislike to him as do but they've use him where it's he's be useful but er that's where the contact stop cos
S0018	be he there as well
S0019	no
S0018	oh
S0019	no no he doesn't no that's purely and simply he's have no contact with at all er so it be quite satisfy to be able to
S0018	yeah but how do end up leave 's firm be it when he sell it to general electric
S0019	mhm
S0018	ah so that be quite amicable the whole
S0019	oh i'm not sure it be amicable
S0018	why not
S0019	well can't do anything amicably
S0019	no he's an objectionable individual he's when things don't go his way or he feel threaten or under pressure he lose his temper and the solicitor from eversheds that your father have she want to report him to the law society for unprofessional conduct cos they be in a meet and he lose his rag he be shout and thump the table and and she be appal at his behaviour and apparently he behave like that they be negotiate with somebody in germany and he do exactly the same thing and damn near lose them the contract he's deeply unpleasant individual
S0018	it's not particularly a way a good way to win friends and influence people
S0019	no well he hasn't do terribly well cos i don't think anybody at have anything to do with him at all
S0018	hm

S0018	i can't keep up with all these
S0019	mm
S0018	aunts and uncles and
S0019	cousins and wive and
S0018	cos how many do grandad have
S0019	how many what
S0018	brothers and sisters
S0019	two brothers and three sisters
S0018	so he be one of six
S0019	mm
S0018	and nanny be one of
S0019	seven
S0018	seven
S0019	she have one sister and all the others be brothers
S0019	it's amaze to think that by the time she be bear her eldest brother have leave home
S0018	hm
S0019	be out at work and have leave home cos he be twenty twenty one i think cos grandma actually have eight children but one of them be bear dead um and if you think they come along at two to three year intervals
S0019	that's virtually twenty years
S0018	blimey
S0019	mm
S0018	she must've be a baby make she must she's probably spend more time pregnant than she be not pregnant
S0018	why do she have so many
S0019	because in those days you do
S0018	mm
S0019	contraception wasn't as available or as reliable
S0018	yeah but surely i mean how do people afford to have eight kid
S0019	because things weren't as expensive they be prepare to do without more things there weren't things to buy it be bloody hard work
S0018	hm
S0019	and also i suppose when they get marry which be nineteen o one i think it be um there be quite a considerable infant mortality rate
S0018	mm
S0019	but things be very different i mean you have you rent a house you didn't buy a house you have basic furniture there be no mod con um your entertainment be i suppose later on the radio um book grandad have the old harmonium so they use to use to play the harmonium and
S0018	what's a harmonium
S0019	it's like an organ little organ
S0018	ah
S0019	pedal
S0018	ah
S0019	i can remember that
S0019	um
S0018	do you use to play parlour game
S0019	i be try to think no i don't think we do no i don't think we do
S0018	oh i think i'd much prefer a lifestyle like that than one of
S0019	hm
S0018	today where people be push to become
S0019	mm
S0018	little consumerists and that's the only thing that matter
S0019	yes and you see they walk a lot more and nobody have cars only if you be quite wealthy grandad's parent have a car very early um until grandad throw a strop and walk out on the company that he have help to find and then he beetle off up north somewhere and leave nanny with six kid to bring up
S0018	your nanny or my nanny
S0019	my nanny
S0018	oh obviously your nanny cos my nanny doesn't have six kid
S0019	six kid to bring up and she didn't know where he be he didn't send any money so she be take in wash and sew to make end meet
S0018	how long be he away for
S0019	oh that we don't know i don't know
S0018	how old be nanny when that happen
S0019	no grandad
S0018	oh how old be grandad when that happen
S0019	um i imagine that he be very young i don't know exactly when that be but she somehow find out where grandad be so she pawn her wed ring
S0019	go up i think it be leeds
S0018	i bet that speak volumes
S0019	yeah go up to leeds and more or less frog march him home
S0018	do he stay
S0019	yes
S0018	and what have he be do what have have he be do
S0019	he'd be work
S0018	oh right
S0019	he find a job
S0018	uh huh
S0019	um i don't know whether there be another lady involve there's never be any suggestion that there be um but er she be quite a fearsome little lady my nan
S0019	she wasn't as tall as me
S0019	er but you didn't cross her if you know what be good for you
S0019	she be something else
S0018	but how come he just up and leave and not contact
S0019	i have no idea
S0018	it be hardly the do thing
S0019	no but he be a bite of a law unto himself be grandad
S0018	mhm
S0019	he he'd get a terrible temper as well
S0018	really
S0019	oo terrible temper
S0018	what worse than my dad when er i use to read the reader's digest before him
S0019	oh ff no nanny have a go at him the once because he foul temper about something and he kick the cat
S0018	huh no
S0019	yes and nanny go for him how dare you do that
S0018	good on her
S0019	yes
S0018	have the cat actually instigate the bad behaviour
S0019	no no
S0018	the bad
S0019	no he be in a
S0018	oh
S0019	foul mood over something i don't know what it be
S0018	oh right
S0019	but er i always get on very well with my grandad i think because i be the last grandchild um and quite a lot younger than the others and i use to go and stay and i use to sit on the wall wait for him to come round the corner with his little brown suitcase
S0019	come back from work um there be three big tree
S0018	where be this
S0019	in
S0018	oh really
S0019	mm
S0018	uh huh
S0019	and there be three big tree and he'd hide behind one of them and it be a ritual and i use to have to go round to the little shop run by
S0019	and get his woodbines you wouldn't be allow to do it now
S0019	can't sell fag to kid
S0019	but no it be er
S0018	so what do he er what do he work in when he be
S0019	he be a tool maker
S0018	a what
S0019	tool maker
S0018	oh right be that why my grandad become that
S0019	mhm he go first of all uncle who be in insurance get grandad a job when he leave school um
S0018	my grandad or your grandad
S0019	your grandad
S0018	okay
S0019	er it's get confuse um they he couldn't afford to stay on to matriculate which be the equivalent of a level do school cert school certificate which be gcse o level but then couldn't afford to stay on so uncle ernie get him a job virtually as an office boy in an insurance company
S0018	mhm
S0019	and i think he last two weeks
S0018	why
S0019	because he couldn't stand it
S0019	it be just not him at all so grandad my grandad who be work at a firm call setton and durwoods get him um an apprenticeship at setton and durwoods and he go from apprentice to foreman of the tool room and that be all through the war and then he leave to go to as work manager
S0018	mm
S0019	so he progress up the the ladder that be when he use to stick a lump of plasticine on the wall and if he have to go out of the tool room
S0018	oh he'd
S0019	would take his spare false eye stick it on the thing get my eye on you
S0019	oh he be a case
S0018	so what he be in charge of all the
S0019	yes the tool room
S0018	all
S0019	the whole tool room and all the people work in it
S0018	hm
S0019	on the press and the various machine
S0018	and what do they make during during the war i mean sorry
S0019	ah during the war i'm not sure exactly what they they be make during the war but they make do you know the lever arch file
S0018	uh huh
S0019	they make those
S0018	oh really
S0019	mm
S0018	what they be the ones that
S0019	mm
S0018	originally make them
S0019	mm
S0018	really
S0019	mhm yeah
S0018	what they they have the patent for them and everything
S0019	oh no i don't think they have the patent for them but they be the ones that that manufacture them
S0018	oh first
S0019	mm as far as i'm aware
S0018	oh that's interest
S0019	mm
S0018	and do they make arm or tool during the war
S0019	i have no idea i imagine that they be make er spar for military vehicles and things like that um general sort of engineer bits and piece but i don't know exactly
S0018	hm
S0019	no i i couldn't tell you exactly what they be make
S0018	mm
S0019	but that's partly the reason why he wasn't in the force during the war cos he be a reserve occupation tool makers
S0018	ah
S0019	engineer reserve occupation
S0018	okay
S0019	and the fact he'd lose an eye they wouldn't have him
S0018	and be your grandfather in the first world war
S0019	not as far as i know
S0018	cos he be in the same occupation or
S0019	i don't know
S0018	or he
S0019	my other grandfather nanny's father be in the first world war
S0018	really
S0019	yes but he be non combatant because
S0018	what do he do
S0019	his of his health and things i don't know and of course frank be in the force but non combatant because of his health and he be do um oh their tut oh map work and things like that cos of his artistic
S0018	uh huh
S0019	bend
S0018	didn't he draw some propaganda posters and stuff
S0019	mm do all sort of
S0018	cartoon
S0019	things like that yeah all sort of things
S0018	so what do um my nanny's father do
S0019	i think he be just a clerk
S0018	oh
S0019	or a draughtsman cos he be a draughtsman
S0018	what be a draughtsman
S0019	um draw up plan for things detail plan for people to work from like an architect do draw for house
S0018	ah
S0019	draughtsman make plan for machine
S0018	oh okay
S0019	bits of part of things
S0018	interest
S0019	mm
S0018	very interest
S0019	but nanny's oldest brother be reserve occupation
S0018	why what be he
S0019	cos he be engineer as well er her next down brother uncle manage to wangle himself um a job somewhere and i can't remember exactly where it be but again he didn't have to go in the force
S0018	hm
S0019	um uncle be in engineer so he didn't go uncle do
S0018	really
S0019	mm he be part of the first british soldier to go into belsen
S0018	the concentration camp
S0019	mhm
S0018	oh dear
S0019	he would never talk about it
S0018	i'm not surprise
S0019	he have nightmares
S0018	mm
S0019	for years after
S0018	tut
S0019	but would never talk about it
S0018	gosh how long be he away for
S0019	dunno couldn't tell you
S0018	be you bear after
S0019	mhm just after
S0018	mhm
S0019	they'd just drop the atom bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki
S0018	and then they drop the wendy bomb
S0019	the biggest bombshell of the lot
S0019	but grandad's oldest brother join the merchant navy god know why he join the merchant navy cos that be
S0018	what be his name
S0018	mhm
S0019	and wales and uncle have join the navy before the war he'd lie about his age
S0018	oh yeah you tell me
S0019	um that be it really it's strange that so many of the men from both side of the families be reserve occupations because of be in engineer
S0018	mm
S0019	but then i suppose it's not that surprise because of the area the midlands you would expect a lot of men to be involve
S0018	why's that cos it be heavily industrialize
S0019	yeah yeah manufacture be of one thing and another be the big thing in the midlands
S0018	i'm surprise how diverse a like there be so many different type of engineer
S0019	mm
S0018	i didn't realize
S0019	mm well be it uncle and uncle work at the bsa
S0018	what's that
S0019	the um they manufacture cycle and motorcycle but of course switch to war production and military vehicles uncle be in engineer i think he work for amec
S0018	mm
S0019	which be an engineer company er
S0018	but what kind of engineer do they do
S0019	i have no idea absolutely no idea um now i don't quite know what be do cos he run the cycle shop
S0018	oh this be the father of your cousin
S0019	mm
S0018	that whose funeral
S0019	mm
S0018	it be tomorrow that be quite a sentence
S0019	it be so i really don't know what he be do during the war know him he'd make sure he be out of the way and
S0019	not put himself in any sort of risk at all
S0018	well i'm not surprise
S0018	it's a surely that's a human instinct
S0019	yeah but when your country's at war and fight for survival one expect
S0018	no i don't think you'd get that anymore
S0019	oh i'm not sure
S0018	in this day and age
S0019	not sure not sure wouldn't like to say
S0018	well i think the only people that would stand up and say fight for britain would be the bnp lot
S0018	then again bnp and edl they'd probably turn round and put their tail between their legs and run away
S0019	mm
S0018	no i doubt i doubt that
S0019	i i wouldn't like to say
S0018	i don't think they would be able then again nowadays warfare doesn't involve body do it
S0019	you see what's go on in afghanistan
S0018	okay yeah dead body but it doesn't involve manpower it involve more technological
S0019	it's a much more even mix now than it ever be but it still involve manpower i mean
S0018	but i doubt they'd have to to use conscription
S0019	they would
S0018	would they
S0019	our army be so small
S0018	really
S0019	oh yeah they've reduce the size of our armies to such an extent that we would not be able to fight a war as we be at the moment
S0018	hm
S0019	there would have to be massive conscription no they've
S0018	well
S0019	chop and chop and chop we have no aircraft carriers anymore our air force be a fraction of what it be
S0018	yeah but nowadays with a war it would just be one nuclear bomb see you england
S0019	no no no no no i have grave doubt as to whether anybody would use a the nuclear option because of the repercussions
S0018	hm
S0019	i think it's nuclear weapons be a lot of sabre rattle but i think it would have to be a real megalomaniac to actually use them
S0018	well there be plenty of them out there
S0019	there be
S0019	there be but i still think that you know even if you back to the sixties and the bay of pig that come very very close
S0018	be that before pearl harbour what be that one
S0019	oh no no no this be the sixties pearl
S0018	oh sorry i didn't hear you
S0019	yeah um no it be when the russians have missiles on cuba
S0018	ah be that er nixon and
S0019	no that be kennedy
S0018	oh i'm so good at history aren't i
S0019	yes it be er it go very close to the wire but khrushchev draw back because kennedy be absolutely adamant he be not go to turn away and if they push it then he'd push back and the russians retreat
S0018	i'm sure i've see a film huh about that
S0019	possibly
S0018	what what be nixon cos i'm i'm sure i've see
S0019	watergate
S0018	a film call nixon i ah yeah
S0019	watergate
S0018	that's right mhm
S0019	yes there be a film about watergate
S0018	but there be a a i'm sure there be a film about the bay of pig as well
S0019	possibly don't really know
S0019	wait a moment
S0018	um what why what be you do what be you
S0019	i'm just wonder
S0018	what plan have you get
S0019	what time do you want to i can give you a lift into again if you want
S0018	aw you don't have to
S0019	no well i wouldn't have offer if i hadn't want to would i
S0018	bless you what plan have you get oh you just
S0019	i'm just wait i will eat when i need to i don't know what i can't bank on your father be home at any particular time so look at her
S0018	yeah i know she's so
S0019	sit there with her paw

S0018	she's so fluffy
S0019	aw she's lovely
S0018	look how much
S0019	yeah i know
S0018	i've get off her just from brush her once
S0019	yeah mm
S0018	i i'm sure you could make a jumper out of this
S0019	yes but you have to spin it
S0018	i'm sure you wouldn't look how mat it be already well
S0019	yes but you've still get to spin it out and get it into a yarn
S0018	couldn't you just cos the
S0019	no dear you couldn't
S0018	the way these come off
S0019	yes i know but
S0018	tut
S0019	you still couldn't do it like that
S0018	let me speak
S0018	the way these come off surely you could just they come off as rectangles could you not just sew them together
S0019	no they they wouldn't hold together as soon as you put any real pressure on it they would just disintegrate you need to spin them pull them out and spin
S0018	oh well i guess these bits of fur be reserve for the bird in the garden anyway
S0019	yes
S0018	to make their nest with
S0019	yes so you can pull it out and
S0018	yeah
S0019	need a proper spin wheel
S0019	who's that
S0019	oh be it
S0018	yeah with his dog
S0019	with the dog
S0019	aw
S0018	yay so what the bird when how will you tell when they're nest
S0019	i'm not quite sure i think we'll just see them in and out of the ivy particularly and then i'll just have to put some bits out on the lawn
S0018	do the bird still fee off the feeders
S0019	mhm yep
S0018	i wonder whether we'll see the hedgehogs
S0018	this year
S0019	i doubt it what what
S0019	what's the matter
S0018	she want to be brush again come here
S0019	be you talk to me
S0018	i want a cardigan
S0018	come here let me brush you
S0019	soppy girl
S0018	but this actually doesn't weave very well into wool
S0019	well it do you're not do it quite right
S0018	how be you suppose to do it
S0019	you pull it and twist it at the same time
S0018	go on you do it
S0019	hm mm don't know whether i can do it now cos you have to pull it and twist it
S0018	do you have machine that that do that
S0019	well the spin wheel use to be what you use
S0018	and how do you
S0019	the old spin wheel
S0018	but how do you put that hair onto a spin wheel
S0019	hm
S0018	do you have to fee it in
S0019	the yes virtually you fee it in and it spin very fast and it's get a weight on it so it's pull it while it's spin and it go round the spindle and you get this spool of wool
S0018	ah
S0019	cunning but that be a very old method of get yarn
S0018	and that be make with er sheep's wool
S0019	yep
S0018	and what consistency be sheep's wool what be it similar to cat hair
S0019	no it's much thicker than cat hair and they it's longer so it's much more easy to spin aw be that nice oh yes that's
S0018	she do like be brush
S0019	aw
S0019	be that nice aw be that lovely
S0018	crazy cat
S0019	aw aw haw haw haw roly poly so i do your tummy then come on oo oo
S0018	now look how much have come off just
S0019	i know
S0018	from brush
S0019	i know it's terrible
S0018	have she start to
S0019	oh yes
S0018	moult for summer
S0019	yes and how
S0018	be her coat noticeably different in winter than it be in the summer
S0019	huh um no it's just thicker i think the undercoat bite with her be it's so fine
S0018	look at that that be a substantial amount of
S0019	i know
S0018	hair
S0019	yep and you can do this to her as many time as you like and you still get the same amount out because this particular brush be design to get the under hair
S0018	oh
S0019	the under fur out
S0018	okay
S0019	because her fur the top coat be longer and coarser and the undercoat be much finer
S0018	but it's such soft hair
S0019	mm
S0018	oh my gosh look at all the stuff on the carpet
S0019	i know oh yes
S0018	cat
S0019	stuff on the carpet
S0018	come here could you sell it
S0019	no
S0018	i bet nobody's get cat hair cardigan
S0018	maybe it'd be like mohair or we could make them a little scarf for the winter
S0018	she could wear a scarf of her own fluff
S0019	there you be abby abby
S0018	be you go to work on the garden this spring
S0019	who know i sort of lose enthusiasm for garden

S0018	be you even go to put in the dahlias this year
S0019	i don't know i'll see if the ones i've get in come up again
S0018	why be they suppose to
S0019	cos they often do well they're not suppose to you're suppose to take them up each year and dry them and then plant them again but i never do depend on the sort of winter you have if it's if it's a very cold wet winter they usually rot in the grind
S0018	have you get lot of things in the garden that do just come up every year
S0019	most of the things in the garden just come up every year
S0018	well there you go you don't have to do
S0019	because that's my idea of garden
S0018	that's good you don't have to do any garden then
S0019	no i don't like have to plant things every year i find that a bite of a pain look at this
S0018	there's so much
S0019	oh dear well it's so soft and fluffy
S0018	i know
S0019	oh lose my trousers again
S0018	and when do it start get light past seven pm
S0019	well it's get that way now but it will be even more noticeable when we change the clock and we change the clock somewhere around the twenty second twenty second of march ish
S0018	that's next week no gosh it doesn't seem long since we turn the clock forward
S0019	well that's october isn't it
S0018	do we put them back or forward er spring forward
S0019	spring forward
S0018	fall back
S0019	yes fall backwards
S0018	so
S0019	oh here you be
S0018	they'll go forward
S0019	sunday the twenty fifth british summer time
S0018	so not this sunday but next sunday
S0019	mhm
S0018	british summer time blimey
S0019	now now
S0018	so it be really six months ago since we put the clock
S0019	mm october
S0018	that's go so quickly
S0019	mm tell me about it
S0018	cos i remember i be go out at six fifty be it
S0019	something like that
S0018	and it have just get to the point where i be go out in the morning and it be just get light
S0019	mm
S0018	and then we put the clock
S0019	back
S0018	fall back we put the clock back and then i have to
S0019	mm
S0018	put up with another month or so of
S0019	well it's get noticeably much lighter earlier in the mornings now but of course since last summer we've put those um blackout line up so of course er you don't notice um that it have get lighter
S0018	mm
S0019	it's definitely lighter in the mornings
S0018	and be they not talk about abolish the
S0019	oh they've be talk about this for years double summer time so that we put the clock two hours forward and i wish they'd make up their mind the the argument about abolish it be that place like scotland will be dark until sort of ten o'clock in the morning um and that sort of thing so but there's be discussions about change it make us tie in with the rest of europe um be an hour ahead
S0018	be that what the logic be
S0019	i don't know what the logic be but during the war they have double summer time so that they have more light to harvest and do work on the land
S0018	why don't people just get up an hour earlier instead of
S0019	that would be far too logical a solution
S0019	wouldn't it
S0018	well it just seem a bite it's like as if they're purport that it's create more hours of sunlight it's not
S0019	no it's not but it serve a purpose it mean that they be able to carry on work longer in the even cos in the height of summer it be still light at ten eleven o'clock at night so you know farm work could carry on
S0018	hm
S0019	so
S0018	no that be one of the nice things about england even though it's not
S0018	very warm in the summer and you can never tell whether it's go to be rain or cloudy or
S0019	mm
S0018	what not at least it stay light
S0019	mm
S0018	a long time cos in in spain it doesn't
S0019	no
S0018	stay so light
S0019	no
S0018	for so long
S0019	and also i mean we'll find this when we go to greece i mean we get be awake sort of six o'clock in the morning but it's still pitch black at six o'clock in the morning
S0018	yep
S0019	um so that's the frustrate thing but hey we'll survive
S0018	you should just learn to lie in
S0019	can't do that
S0019	can't do that
S0018	you don't read book much anymore
S0019	cos it's too uncomfortable
S0018	tut oh
S0019	i find it really uncomfortable don't read at in bed like i use to
S0018	yeah
S0019	cos it's just not comfortable at all
S0018	hm
S0019	and actually read sit i have to be very careful where the book be and
S0018	have you try dad's kindle
S0019	yes
S0018	and how's that be that better
S0019	the same i just need to find a position that isn't too uncomfortable after a while
S0018	hm but surely that would be easier cos you can do it one hand more easily than you can with a print book
S0019	it be the position of the head that be critical cos if i'm sit with my head down like that after a while it start to get really uncomfortable
S0018	hm
S0019	no i'm sure i find a book on our bookshelves cos we have a use book shelf at work and we just do a fifty p donation and i'm sure i buy one think that it would be interest for you to read but i can't remember what i do with it
